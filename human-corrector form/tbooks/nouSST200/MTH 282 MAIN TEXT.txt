In addition, it advocates some general guidelines for the amount of time you are likely to spend on each unit of the course in order to complete it successfully.
It gives you guidance in respect of Tutor-Marked Assignment which will be made available in the MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II assignment file.
There will be regular tutorial classes that are related to the course.
It is advisable for you to attend these tutorial sessions.
Course Aim The aim of the course is to provide you with an understanding of Mathematical Methods.
It also aims to give you a modern way of solving complex problems in mathematics, make clear distinctions between the ways we handled problems in analysis, and provide you solutions to some problems that may arise in engineering and other areas of human endeavour.
Course Objectives To achieve the aims set out, the course has a set of objectives.
Each unit has specific objectives which are included at the beginning of the unit.
You should read these objectives before you study the unit.
You may wish to refer to them during your study to check on your progress.
You should always look at the unit objectives after completion of each unit.
By doing so, you would have followed the instructions in the unit.
Below are comprehensive objectives of the course as a whole.
By meeting these objectives, you should have achieved the aims of the course as a whole.
In addition to the aims above, this course sets to achieve some objectives.
Thus, after going through the course, you should be able to:  explain vector theory  discuss differential operators  discuss orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates  enumerate the concept of complex variables Working through This Course To complete this course you are required to read each study unit, read the textbooks and read other materials which may be provided by the National Open University of Nigeria.
Each unit contains self-assessment exercises and at certain points in the course you would be required to submit assignments for assessment purposes.
At the end of the course, there is a final examination.
The course should take you about a total of 17 weeks to complete.
Below you will find listed all the components of the course, ii MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II what you have to do and how you should allocate your time to each unit in order to complete the course on time and successfully.
This course entails that you spend a lot of time to read.
You are advised to avail yourself the opportunities of the tutorial classes provided by the University.
Presentation Schedule Your course materials have important dates for the early and timely completion and submission of your TMAs and attending tutorials.
You should remember that you are required to submit all your assignments by the stipulated time and date.
You should guard against falling behind in your work.
Assessment There are three aspects to the assessment of the course.
The first is made up of self-assessment exercises, second consists of the tutor-marked assignments and third is the written examination/end of course examination.
You are advised to do the exercises.
In tackling the assignments, you are expected to apply information, knowledge and technique you gathered during the course.
The assignments must be submitted to your facilitator for formal assessment in accordance with the deadlines stated in the presentation schedule and the assignment file.
The work you submit to your tutor for assessment will count for 30% of your total course work.
At the end of the course you will need to sit for a final or end of course examination of about three hour duration.
This examination will count for 70% of your total course mark.
Tutor-Marked Assignment The TMA is a continuous assessment component of your course.
It accounts for 30% of the total score.
You will be given four (4) TMAs to answer.
Three of these must be answered before you are allowed to sit for the end of course examination.
The TMAs would be given to you by your facilitator and returned after you have done the assignment.
Assignment questions for the units in this course are contained in the assignment file.
You will be able to complete your assignment from the information and material contained in your reading, references and study units.
However, it is desirable in all Degree level of education to demonstrate that you have read and researched more into your references, which will give you a wider view point and may provide you iii MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II with a deeper understanding of the subject.
Make sure that each assignment reaches your facilitator on or before the deadline given in the presentation schedule and assignment file.
If for any reason you cannot complete your work on time, contact your facilitator before the assignment is due to discuss the possibility of an extension.
Extension will not be granted after the due date.
Final Examination and Grading The end of course examination for Mathematical Methods II will be for about 3 hours and it has a value of 70% of the total course work.
The examination will consist of questions, which will reflect the type of self-testing, practice exercise and tutor-marked assignment problems you have previously encountered.
All areas of the course will be assessed.
Use the time between finishing the last unit and sitting for the examination to revise the whole course.
You might find it useful to review your self-test, TMAs and comments on them before the examination.
The end of course examination covers information from all parts of the course.
Course Marking Scheme Assignment Marks Assignments 1-4 Four assignments, best three marks of the four count at 10% each -30% of course marks.
End of course examination 70% of overall course marks.
Total 100% of course materials.
Facilitators/Tutors and Tutorials There are 16 hours of tutorials provided in support of this course.
You will be notified of the dates, times and location of these tutorials as well as the name and phone number of your facilitator, as soon as you are allocated a tutorial group.
Your facilitator will mark and comment on your assignments, keep a close watch on your progress and any difficulties you might face and provide assistance to you during the course.
You are expected to mail your Tutor-Marked Assignment to your facilitator before the schedule date (at least two working days are required).
They will be marked by your tutor and returned to you as soon as possible.
Do not delay to contact your facilitator by telephone or e-mail if you need assistance.
iv MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II The following might be circumstances in which you would find assistance necessary, hence you would have to contact your facilitator if:  You do not understand any part of the study or the assigned readings  You have difficulty with the self-tests  You have a question or problem with an assignment or with the grading of an assignment.
You should endeavour to attend the tutorials.
This is the only chance to have face to face contact with your course facilitator and to ask questions which are answered instantly.
You can raise any problem encountered in the course of your study.
To gain much benefit from course tutorials, prepare a question list before attending them.
You will learn a lot from participating actively in discussions.
Summary MTH282 (Mathematical Methods II) is a course that intends to provide solutions to problems normally encountered by engineers and mathematicians in the course of doing their normal jobs.
It also serves as a tool which often enables the mathematicians to widen the frontiers of their analytical concerns to issues that have significant mathematical implications.
Nevertheless, do not forget to apply the principles you have learnt to your understanding of Mathematical Methods II.
I wish you success in the course and I hope that you will find it comprehensive and interesting.

It is one of the most important concepts that would be studied in this course.
It will be found to recur in a great variety of applications.
A full appreciation of the value of vectors can come only after considerable experience with them.
Two aspect of their usefulness worth emphasising are the following: (1) Vectors enable one to reason about problems in space without use of co-ordinates axes.
This is particularly true because the fundamental laws of physics do not depend on the particular position of co-ordinates axes in space.
For example, the Newton’s second law, that has the form: F ma Where F is the force vector and a is the acceleration vector of a moving particle of mass m. This does not necessarily depend on co-ordinate axis.
1 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II (2) Vector provides an economical “Short hand” for complicated formulas.
For example, the condition that points P,P ,P ,and,P 1 2 3 4 lie in a plane can be written in the concise form as: a.b c =0 Where a , b and c are vectors represented by the directed  segment,PP 1 2   PP and PP respectively.
The significant of the dot (.)
and cross ( ) 1 3 1 4 will be explained later in this unit.
The conciseness of vector formulae makes vector useful both for manipulation and understanding.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  discuss vectors and give its example  define unit vectors, rectangular vectors, and resolve vectors into components  perform algebraic functions on vectors  solve related problems on vectors.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 VECTOR ALGEBRA 3.1.1 Definitions Definition 1: A vector in space is a combination of a magnitude (positive real number) and a direction.
 A vector can be represented by a directed line segment PQ in space.
It is convenient to represent vectors by bold letters such as a, b, c,… Definition 2: Two vectors are said to be equal if their magnitude and directions are the same.
Definition 3: A zero vector is a vector whose magnitude is zero.
We can  represent zero vectors by a degenerated line segment PP 2 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 3.1.2 Addition and Subtraction of Vectors Given two vectors: a, b, then we can obtain a third vector c=a + b and if b = c – a this defines the operation of subtraction.
Addition and subtraction of vectors obey the following laws: (1) a + b = b + a [Commutative law of addition] (2) a + ( b + c) = (a + b) + c [ Associative law] (3) a + b = c if b = c – a (4) a + 0 = a (5) a – a =0 Definition 4: If h is a number and a is a vector then, the expression ha is defined as vector whose magnitude is h .
Thus: ha = h.a Two vectors a, b, are said to be collinear (or linearly dependent) if there are scalars h ,h , not both zero, such that 1 2 h a + h b =0 1 2 This is equivalent to asserting that a and b are represented by parallel line segments.
Definition 5: Three vectors a, b, c are said to be coplanar (or linearly dependent) if there are scalar k ,k ,k not all 0 such that: 1 2 3 k a + k b +k c =0 1 2 3 In this case a, b, c can be represented by segments in the same plane.
Let a and b be no collinear.
Then every vector c coplanar with a and b can be represented in the form c k ak b 1 2 For one and only one, choice of k ,k .
1 2 3 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 3.1.3 Unit Vector Unit vectors are vectors having unit length.
Let a be any vector with a length a 0 then, is a unit vector denoted by aˆ having the same a direction as a Then a=aaˆ 3.1.4 Rectangular Unit Vectors The rectangular unit vectors i.j,and,k are unit vectors having the direction of the positive x,y,and,z axes of a rectangular co- ordinates system.
We use right-handed rectangular co-ordinate system unless otherwise specified.
3.1.5 The Component of a Vector Any vector in 3-dimensions can be represented with initial point at the origin 0 of rectangular co-ordinates systems.
Let (A ,A ,A ) be the rectangular co-ordinates of the terminal point of A 1 2 3 with initial point at 0.
The vectors Ai, A j and A k are called the 1 2 3 rectangular component vectors.
The sum of Ai , A j and A k i.e.
1 2 3 A=Ai A j A k is a vector.
1 2 3 The magnitude of A is A  A2  A2  A2 1 2 3 In particular, if r  xi yj zk Then, r  x2  y2  z2 .
4 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Prove that for every four vectors x,y,z,and,w in space, scalars k ,k ,k ,and,k 1 2 3 4 Not all 0, can be found such that k xk yk zk w  0 1 2 3 4 2.
Let O, A, B be points of space.
Show that the mid-point M of the   1   segment AB is located by the vector OM = (OAOB) 2 3.
Prove that the medians of a triangle intersect in a point which is a trisection point of each median.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about vectors, vector addition and subtraction.
In addition, we also consider component of vectors and unit vectors as a special type of vectors.
You are to read carefully and master every bit of the material in this unit for you to follow the material in the next unit.
5.0 SUMMARY Recall that in this unit, we defined a vector as quantities having magnitude and directions.
Two vectors are said to be equal if the directions and magnitudes are equal.
Also, we defined a unit vector as having magnitude equal to one.
Finally, any vector in 3-dimension can be represented with initial point at the origin 0 of a rectangular co-ordinates systems.
Thus, if (A ,A ,A ) 1 2 3 represent the rectangular co-ordinates of the terminal point of A then: A Ai A j A k is a vector.
1 2 3 Magnitude of this vector A is define as A  A2  A2  A2 in particular if 1 2 3 r  xi yj zk Then, r  x2  y2  z2 5 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT 1.

We shall differentiate between scalar and vector products.
These two concepts are very useful in vector analysis because many physical phenomena can be explained in terms of either scalar or vector products.
For example, work done can be calculated as a scalar product of displacement and the applied force.
This implies that if we let F represent force and d represent the displacement, then work done (W) can be defined as: W=F.d Other physical interpretation of vector product will be discussed in this unit.
You are advised to study this unit very carefully.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be to:  define scalar product of vectors and give examples  define vector product and give examples  solve accurately, all related exercises in this unit.
7 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Types of Vector Products Two types of vector products are recognised, namely: 1) Scalar Product 2) Vector Product In what now follows, we shall define and explain scalar product of vectors.
3.2 Scalar Product Let a and b be vectors then, the scalar product of a and b is defined as a.b  a b cos ……………………………………………………….
(1)  is the angle between them.
The quantity b cos which appears in (1) can be interpreted as the component of b in the direction of a.
We can write it as compb bcos……………………………………………………… (2) a This component is a scalar which measures the length of the projection of b on a line parallel to a.
The notion of component is basic for application of vectors in mechanics.
For example, the velocity vector or force vector can be described by giving its component in three mutually perpendicular directions.
If a constant force F acts on an object moving from A to B  along the segmentAB, the only component of F along AB does work.
The work done is precisely the product of this component by the distance moved, thus: Work= (force component in the direction of motion) .
(distance) Hence Work = Fcos.AB  F.AB.
……………………………… (3) 8 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Scalar product obeys the following laws: (1) a.b = b.a (commutative) (2) a.
(bc) a.ba.c (Distributive law) (3) a.
(kb) (ka).b k(a.b) Where k is a scalar.
We make the following inference from the scalar product of vectors.
(i) If a.b  0 then a is perpendicular to b.
(ii) It is not permitted to cancel in an equation of the form a.b=a.c and conclude that b=c.
For equation a.b=a.c it implies only that a.b = a.c = a.
(b-c) = 0 that is a is perpendicular to b-c We note that: i.i 1, j.j 1,and,k.k 1 and i.j 0, j.k 0,and,k.i 0…………… (4) Given that: a  a ia ja k,and,b bib jb k ………………… (5) 1 2 3 1 2 3 Then, a.b  (a ia ja k).
(bib jb k) 1 2 3 1 2 3 = a b a b a b ………………… (6) 1 1 2 2 3 3 SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Show that: (Ai A j A k).
(Bi B j B k)  A B  A B  A B 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 3.2.1 Direction Cosines Recall from unit1 that if a is a vector of length 1 i.e.
a 1, then a will be termed a unit vector.
In this case we denote a as: 9 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II a  a ia ja k x y z Then, a  a.11.1cos cos.
x Where  is the angle between a,and,i.
This is the angle between a and the positive x direction.
In a similar manner a  cos,a  cos y z Where ,and, are the angles between a and the y,and,z, directions respectively.
From a.b= a b cos then a b a b a b cos x x y y z z …………..….

(ab) (v) a(ab) 3.4 Triple Product In this section, we shall consider (1) The Scalar Triple Product (2) The Vector Triple Product.
3.4.1 The Scalar Triple Product The scalar ab.c is known as the scalar triple product a, b, c, in that order.
We need to remark here that parentheses are not needed since a(b.c) would have no meaning.
The scalar triple product satisfies the following laws: (1) ab.c 0 if and only if a,b,c, are coplanar (2) ab.c  volume of parallelepiped with edges a, b,and c (3) ab.c  a.bc.

(vw)w 3.4.2 The Vector Triple Products The expression (ab)c and a(bc) are known as vector triple products.
Note that the parentheses are necessary because for example; (ii) j 0 while i(i j) ik  j The following identities are to be noted (1) a(bc)(a.c)b(a.b)c (2) (ab)c (c.a)b(c.b)a We can prove the identity stated in (1) i.e.
a(bc)(a.c)b(a.b)c a  a ia ja k x y z Proof: Let b b ib jb k x y z c  c ic jc k x y z 12 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Taking component i , then 1 0 0 i.a(bc)  a a a x y z b b b b b b y z z x x y c c c c c c c z z x x y = a (b c b c )a (b c b c ) y x y y x z z x x z = b (a c a c a c )c (a b a b a b ) x x x y y x z x x x y y z z = i.
[(a.c)b(a.b)c] … (9) We can similarly prove the above for y and z components.
3.5 Axiomatic Approach to Vector Analysis Recall from our previous section (unit 1 section 3.1.5) that we can represent a vector: r  xi yj zk is determined when its components (x,y,z) relative to some co-ordinate system are known.
In adopting an axiomatic approach it is natural for us to make the following: Definition: A 3-dimensional vector is an ordered triplet of real numbers (A ,A ,A ).
1 2 3 With the above definition, we can define equality, vector addition and subtraction, etc.
Let A(A ,A ,A ) and B (B ,B ,B ) then 1 2 3 1 2 3 1.
A= B if and only if A  B ,A  B ,A  B 1 1 2 2 3 3 2.
A+ B = (A  B ,A  B ,A  B ) 1 1 2 2 3 3 3.
A - B = (A B ,A B ,A B ) 1 1 2 2 3 3 4.
0 = (0, 0, 0) 5. mA m(A ,A ,A )  (mA ,mA ,mA ) 1 2 3 1 2 3 13 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 6.
A.B = A.B  A .B  A .B 1 1 2 2 3 3 7.
Length or magnitude of A= A  A.A  A2  A2  A3 1 2 3 From these, we obtain other properties of vectors, such as AB  B A, (AB)C  A(BC),A.
(BC) A.B A.C. By defining the unit vectors: i (1,0,0) j (0,1,0) k (0,0,1) We can show that: A Ai A j A k 1 2 3 In like manner we can define AB  (A B  A B ,A B  AB ,AB  A B ) 2 3 3 2 3 1 1 3 1 2 2 1 After this axiomatic approach has been developed, we can interpret the result geometrically or physically.
For example we can show that A.B= ABcos and AB  ABsin 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about scalar multiplication and cross multiplication of vectors.
We have also considered vector triple products.
The application of these concepts will be apparent as we proceed further in this course.
5.0 SUMMARY In summary, we recap the following about vector products, namely:  Given that A and B are vectors, then the scalar product of A and B is defined as, A.B= A B cos  If A=Ai A j A k , and B= Bi B j B k then 1 2 3 1 2 3 A.B= A B  A B  A B 1 1 2 2 3 3  If A.B=0 and A and B are not null vector, then A and B are perpendicular.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  define limit and continuity of vector functions  examine the derivatives of vector functions  give a geometric interpretation to vector derivatives and be able to determine vector velocity  solve all related problems on vector functions.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Vector Function of One Variable Given an intervalt t t , suppose we assign a vector u in space, then 1 2 u is said to be given a vector function of t over that interval.
For example, u t2it3jsintk 16 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Where i, j,k form a triple of mutually perpendicular unit vectors.
If a co-ordinate system is chosen in space then the vector u can always be expressed in the form u u iu ju k x y z Where u ,u ,and u are the corresponding components.
These x y , z components themselves depend on t. Suppose the axes are fixed and independent of t, then we can write u  f(t), u  g(t) and u h(t), t t t x y z 1 2 Thus, a vector functions of t, determines three scalar functions of t. Conversely, if f(t),g(t) and h(t) are three scalar functions of t defined on the interval, t t t then the vector u is given as 1 2 u  f(t)ig(t)jh(t)k This is a vector function of t. 3.2 Limit and Continuity of Vector Function The vector function u u(t) is said to have a limit v as t approachest .
o This implies that limu(t) v if u(t)v  whenever t t .
o tt o The implication of this is that the difference between u(t) and v can be made arbitrarily small for t sufficiently close to t 0 Continuity: The function u u(t) is said to be continuous at the value t if one has 0 limu(t) u(t ) 0 tt 0 We can establish by prove that u(t) is continuous at a value t , if and o only if its component u ,u ,and,u are all continuous.
x y z Also given two vectors u (t),and,u (t) such that they are both 1 2 continuous functions for t t t then the functions: 1 2 u (t)u (t), u (t).u (t) and u (t)u (t) are continuous functions of t 1 2 1 2 1 2 over the defined interval.
17 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 3.3 Derivative of a Vector Function Velocity Vector: The derivative of the vector function u u(t) is defined as a limit.
du u(t t)u(t) u  lim  lim dt t0 t t0 t We can define the above in terms of component as follows: u(tt)u(t)[f(tt) f(t)]i[g(t t)g(t)]j[h(t t)h(t)]k Hence, on dividing by t and letting t 0 one finds du  f(t)i g(t)jh(t)k dt du du du = x i y j z k dt dt dt Therefore, to differentiate a vector function, each component must be differentiated separately.
3.4 Geometric Interpretation Let S be the distance traversed by P from t t up to time t, then 1 ds  f (t)2  g(t)2 h(t)2 dt dx dy dz = ( )2 ( )2 ( )2 dt dt dt  Let u OP the position vector of the moving point P, then the vector  v  (d/dt)OP is the tangent to the curve traced by P and has at each point a magnitude du v   f(t)2  g(t)2 h()2 dt The conclusion drawn from above is that v is precisely the velocity vector of the moving point P for v is the tangent to the path and has 18 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II magnitude v  ds/dt (speed) and clearly points in the direction of motion.
We then have the following rule: d  OP  velocity of P, where 0 is a fixed reference point.
dt Finally we consider the following differentials: Given that A(x,y,z)  A (x,y,z)i A (x,y,z)j A (x,y,z)k 1 2 3 Then, A A A dA dx dy dz, is the differential of A.

In the next unit, we shall extend these derivatives into partial derivatives and apply the results in the orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates.
5.0 SUMMARY We now recap what you have learnt in this unit as follows:  Given an intervalt t t , a vector function u can be assigned 1 2 such that u u(t).
For example, u(t) t2isintjcos2tk is a vector function of t.  We can define a limit of the vector function as: limu(t) v if u(t)v  whenever t t .

These operations have wide-ranging applications in the physical sciences.
The most important operations are those of finding the gradient of a scalar field and the divergence and curl of a vector field.
Central to all these differential operations is the vector operator  which is called Del (or sometimes, nabla).
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  define the operator Del ()  apply the operator in finding gradient of function (x,y,z)  give physical interpretation to gradient of (x,y,z)  solve correctly, exercises involving the use of gradient.
23 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Operator Del () Consider the operator (del) defined by:      i j k ……………… ……….. (1) x y z Equation (1) is called operator Del.
It has a lot of physical application in vector analysis as we shall see shortly.
If (x,y,z) and A(x,y,z) have continuous first partial derivatives in a region, we can define the gradient of (x,y,z) as: (1) Gradient: The gradient of (x,y,z) is defined by: (x,y,z) (x,y,z) (x,y,z) grad i j k x y z 3.2 Interpretation One interesting application of grad can be view as follows: (x,y,z) c …..................................... (2) Let equation (2) be equation of a surface then,  is normal to this surface.
To see this, let (x,y,z) be a scalar field.
Consider the differential defined by: dr dxidyjdzk …………………….….
(3) The corresponding differential in (x,y,z) is    d dx dy dz ……………………….… (4) x y z = .dr ………………………….
(5) Now if c then d0 therefore, .dr 0 ………………………… (6) 24 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Hence  is normal to the surface given by the equation (x,y,z) c Examples: (1) Find the gradient of the scalar field  xy2z3 Solution:  y2z3i2xyz3j3xy2z3k (2) Given the function (x,y,z)  x2y yz at the point (1, 2,-1) find its rate of change with distance in the direction a i2j3k.
At this same point, what is the greatest possible rate of change with distance and in which direction does it occur?
Solution: Gradient of  is given by (x2y yz) 2xyi(x2  z)j yk Now at the point (1, 2,-1), 4i2k 1 The unit vector in the direction of a is aˆ= (i2j3k),so the rate of 14 change of  with distance s in this direction is d 1 10 .aˆ  (46) ds 14 14 From the above discussion, at the point (1, 2,-1), d/ds will be greatest in the direction of  4i2k and has the value   20 in this direction.
The gradient obeys the following laws: grad(f g)  gradf gradg grad(fg)  fgradg  ggradf In addition to these, we note that the gradient operation also obey the chain rule as in ordinary differential calculus, i.e.
if  and  are scalar fields in region R, then  [()]  …………………………… (7)  25 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about gradient of vector and scalar fields.
In the next unit, we shall examine divergence of a vector field and how it relies on the operator Del.
It is very important for you to learn this operator very well before you make any meaningful progress beyond this point.
5.0 SUMMARY You have learnt the following in this unit:  The operation Del () is defined as      i j k x y z  If (x,y,z) is a scalar field then the gradient of (x,y,z) is defined as    grad i j k .

For example, if we consider the vector field v(x,y,z) describing the local velocity at any point in a fluid then the divergence is equal to the net rate of outflow of fluid per unit volume, evaluated at a point.
We will be exposed to mathematical exposition of this very important concept in this unit.
The prerequisite to our learning this unit is the thorough understanding of the unit 1 of this module.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  explain the divergence of a vector field  explain the Laplacian  solve the exercises at the end of this unit.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Divergence of a Vector Field Suppose we are given a vector field v(x,y,z) in the domain D of space, given three scalar functions v ,v ,v .
suppose these functions possess x y z partial derivatives in D then the divergence is defined as: v v v divv x  y  z …………………………….
(1) x y z 28 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Formula (1) can be written in the symbolic form: divv=.v which implies:    v v v .v ( i j k).
(v iv jv k)= x  y  z .........…… (2) x y z x y z x y z The divergence defined above has a physical significance.
In fluid dynamics, it appears as a measure of the rate of decrease of density at a point.
More precisely, Let u u(x,y,z,t) denote the velocity vector of a fluid motion and let(x,y,z,t) denote the density.
Then vu is a vector whose divergence satisfies the equation.

If fluid is incompressible, this reduce to the simpler equation divu 0 ………………… (4) The divergence also plays an important role in the theory of electromagnetic fields.
To see this, we note that the divergence of the electric force vector E satisfies the equation defined by: divE 4 ………………… (5) Where  is the charge density.
Thus where there is no charge, equation (5) reduces to divE 0 ………………….

(11) In the domain D, the z is said to be harmonic in D. We also used the same term for a function of three variables which has continuous second derivatives in a domain D in space and whose Laplacian is 0 in D. The two equations for harmonic functions: 2z 2z 2w 2w 2w  0,   0 …………………….....….
(12) x2 y2 x2 y2 z2 are known as the Laplacian equations in two and three dimensions respectively.

This concept has a wide range of application in physical phenomenal such as electromagnetic theory.
Those concepts we learnt earlier such as gradient of vector field and divergence theory will be applied later in the theory of orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates systems.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  define curl of vector field correctly  interpret the physical implication of curl of vector field  solve all the associated mathematical problems involving the curl of vector fields.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Curl of a Vector Field We can define the curl of a vector field as follows: Let v(x,y,z) be a vector field then, the curl of vector v(x,y,z) is i j k    Curl v= v  ..…………… (1) x y z v v v x y z 33 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Equation (1) can be expressed as: v v v v v v Curl v = ( z  y)i( x  z )j( y  x)k …………….
(2) y z z x x y This vector field has a meaning independent of the choice of axes.
We shall see this in the treatment of orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates to be considered in the next module.
The curl of vector field is important in the analysis of the velocity field of fluid dynamics and in the analysis of electromagnetic force fields.
For example, curl can be interpreted as measuring angular motion of a fluid and the condition is: Curl v = 0 …………………… (3) For a velocity field v characterises what are termed irrotational flows.
The analogous equation is given as: Curl E = 0 …………………… (4) For the electric force vector E, it holds when only electrostatic forces are present.
Recall that: if V 0 in a region, we say that the flow is irrotational in that region.
The implication of this is that the circulation around a closed curve in a simple region where the flow is irrotational is zero.
If the fluid is incompressible and there is no distribution of sources or sink in the region, we have also .V 0.
since the condition V 0 implies the existence of a potential  such that V  ……………………… (5) We see that if also .V 0 then it follows that .20.
That is, in the flow of an incompressible irrotational fluid without distributed sources or sinks the velocity vector is the gradient of a potential  which satisfies the equation 2 2 2 20 or   0 …….
(6) x2 y2 x2 Equation (6) is known as Laplace’s equation already discussed in (Unit 2, Module 2) 34 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Generally, in any continuously differentiable vector field F with zero divergence and curl in a simple region, the vector F is the gradient of a solution of Laplace’s equation.

In this unit, we will show that it is possible to work in other co-ordinate systems apart from the rectangular co-ordinate if we make the appropriate transformation.
This is what we set to achieve in this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  define the orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates  determine the scale factors of transformation  determine the elemental volume  solve problems in other co-ordinate systems such as circular cylindrical and spherical co-ordinates.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Transformation of Co-Ordinates Given the rectangular co-ordinates x,y,z , we can define a new co- ordinate system by the following equations expressible as: 45 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II x  x(u ,u ,u ), y  y(u ,u ,u ) , z  z(u ,u ,u ) ……………….
(1) 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Conversely, the relations as defined in (1) can be inverted to express u ,u ,u in terms of x,y,z, whenever x,y,z, and are suitably 1 2 3 restricted.
Thus, at least in some region any point with the co-ordinates (x,y,z) has corresponding co-ordinates(u ,u ,u ).
We shall assume that the 1 2 3 correspondence is unique.
Suppose a particle moves from point P in such a way that only u is 1 allowed to vary while u ,u are held constant, then it would generate a 2 3 curve in space which is called u curve .
Other curves u ,and,u are 1 2 3 similarly generated.
3.1.1 Orthogonal Curvilinear Co-Ordinates If one co-ordinate is held constant, we can determine successively three surfaces passing a point of space, these surfaces intersecting in the co- ordinate curves.
When we chose a new co-ordinate in such a way that the co-ordinate curves are mutually perpendicular at each point, such co- ordinates are called Orthogonal Curvilinear co-ordinates.
3.1.2 The Scale Factors Let r  xi yjzk …………….

We now write s 1 U hu ……………… (4) 1 1 1 Whereu , is the unit vector tangent to the u curve in the direction of 1 1 increasing arc length and h ds du is the length ofU .
If we consider 1 1 1 1 the other co-ordinate curves similarly, we thus write 46 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II U hu , U h u , U h u ……………… (5) 1 1 1, 2 2 2 3 3 3 Where u (k 1,2,3) is the unit vector tangent to the u curve, and k k ds r ds r ds r h  1  , h  2  , h  3  ………………… (6) 1 du u 2 du u 3 du u 1 1 2 2 3 3 Putting these equations in the differential forms, we have the following expressions: ds hdu , ds h du , ds h du ………………… (7) 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 h ,h ,and,h are called the scale factors.
1 2 3 The co-ordinates curves are said to be orthogonal if: U .U U .U U .U 0 ………………… (8) 1 2 2 3 3 1 3.1.3 The Elemental Volume The elemental volume is defined as dhh h du du du ………………… (9) 1 2 3 1 2 3 Example: The transformation from rectangular to cylindrical co- ordinates is defined by the transformations x cos,y sin,z  z (a) Prove that the system is orthogonal (b) Find ds2 and the scale factors (c) Find the Jacobian of the transformation and the volume element.

Example: Find the modulus and argument of the complex number (1i)(2i) z  (3i) Solution: (1i)(2i) 22ii1 13i z    (3i) 3i 3i Therefore, 13i (3i) (39ii3 10i z    3i (3i) 10 10  Hence z i therefore z 1 and arg z= 2 54 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II b(1it) 2.
If xiy a where a and b are real constant and x,y,t, (1it) are real variables show that the locus of the point (x,y) as t, varies as a circle.
Solution: b(1it) Let xiy a (1it) b(1it) (1it) = a .
(1it) (1it) b(1t2) 2bit = a  1t2 1t2 Equating the real parts and the imaginary parts in each side of the equation, we have: b(1t2) 2bt x  ,y  1t2 1t2 Thus, (xa)2  y2 b2 Hence, the locus of the point (x,y) is a circle centre (a,0) and radius b.
We may represent complex numbers in the polar form as follows: z  xiy rcosirsin Compare coefficients then x rcos,y rsin We refer to this as the polar representation of the complex numbers.
4.0 CONCLUSION We have shown the way to handle complex numbers in what follows, we shall deal with some problems into detail in complex variables.

The polar form of complex numbers present interesting results which will be examined in this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  express complex numbers in polar form  carry out multiplication and division of complex numbers  recall the Demoivre’s theorem and apply it appropriately  find roots and work with fractional powers of complex numbers  solve correctly the exercises that follows after the unit.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Multiplication and Division of Complex Numbers Let z r (cos isin) and z r (cos isin ) then, 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 z z rr (cos isin)(cos isin ) 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 = rr (cos cos sin sin )i(sin cos cossin ) 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 = rr [cos(  )isin(  )] 1 2 1 2 1 2 57 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II From the above, you could see that z z  z .z 1 2 1 2 We also note that arg(z z )argz argz , and that 1 2 1 2 z r (Cos iSin) 1  1 1 1 z r (Cos iSin ) 2 2 2 2 r = 1[(Cos iSin)(Cos iSin )] r 1 1 2 2 2 r = 1[Cos(  )iSin(  )] r 1 2 1 2 2 Therefore, z z z 1  1 and arg( 1)argz argz z z z 1 2 2 2 2 3.2 Demoivre’s Theorem Recall that: (Cos iSin)(Cos iSin )Cos(  )iSin(  ) 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 Note that, (Cos iSin)(Cos iSin)Cos2 iSin2 1 1 1 1 1 1 This is equivalence to (Cos iSin)2 Cos2 iSin2 1 1 1 1 Also, (Cos iSin)3 Cos3 iSin3 1 1 1 1 If we continue in this way, we find that: Cos iSin)n Cosn iSinn 1 1 1 1 58 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II This is known as the Demoivre’s theorem for positive integer index.
It can be shown that the theorem is true for all rational values of n. Now suppose n is a negative integer and we let n = -m where m is a positive integer then, 1 (CosiSin)m  (CosiSin)m = Cos(m)iSin(m)Cos(n)iSin(n) We can also prove for fractions.
Recall that by Demoivre’s theorem p p (cos isin )q = CospiSinp(CosiSin)p q q p p It follows that Cos iSin  is a qth root of (CosiSin)P q q Demoivre’s theorem has been proved for all rational values of n. p We need to find other values of (CosiSin)q .
To do this, suppose that: p (CosiSin)q (CosiSin) Then, (cosisin)p q(cosisin)q cospisin pq(cosqisinq) Equating the real and imaginary parts, we have cospqcosq;sin psinq By squaring and adding, we obtain 2q 1 and since , the modulus of a complex number is +ve 1 therefore 59 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II coscosq;sinsinq, and these equation are satisfied by q p2k;k 0 or any integer.
Therefore, p2k  q 3.3 Roots and Fractional Power of a Complex Number If n is a positive integer, the nth roots of a complex number are by definition the value ofwhich satisfies the equation n  z If (cosisin) and z r(cosisin) then n(cosnisinn) r(cosisin) where n r and n2k k is an integer or zero.
By definition ,and,r 2k are +ve, such that  n r also,  n Taking in succession the values of k = 0, 1, 2, 3… n, we find that cos2k sin2k i has n distinct values.
Hence there are n n n distinct nth roots of z given by the formula cos2k sin2k   n r[ i ], k=0, 1, 2, 3,…, n-1 k n n p In a situation where n is a rational number say n ,p,and,q are q integers and q is +ve, the value of zn are the values of which satisfy the equation q  zp p Hence if z r(cosisin) then the q values of zq given by the formula 60 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II cos2m sin2m   q rp i , where   m  q q  q rp is the unique positive qth root of rp Example: Find the fifth roots of -1 Solution Recall that: -1=cosisin Now if z5 1cos(2k)isin(2k), k=0,1,2,3,…, Therefore, cos(2k) sin(2k) z  i 5 5 k 0,1,2,3,4, hence the solution are:   z cos isin 5 5 3 3 z cos isin 5 5 5 5 z cos isin 5 5 7 7 z cos isin 5 5 9 9 z cos isin 5 5 61 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II 3.4 The nth Roots of Unity We recall that cos0isin01 this implies that: 1cos2k isin2k, k=0, 1, 2, 3… 2k 2k If  denotes the root cos isin , k=0, 1, 2, 3…, then nth root of n n unity may be written in the form 1,,2,3,...,n1 1n We see that they form a geometric progression whose sum is 1 equal to 0.
We also note that the nth root of unity is represented in the Argand diagram by points which are vertices of a regular polygon of n sides inscribed in the circle.
Example: Solve the equation z6 z5 z4 z3 z2 z10 and deduce that 2 4 6 1 cos cos cos  7 7 7 2 Solution We know that: z7 1 z6 z5 z4 z3 z2 z1 , hence we consider the equation z1 z7 10 We also note that: 1cos0isin0cos2k isin2k, hence cos2k 2k z  isin ,k 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 7 7 62 MTH282 MATHEMATICAL METHODS II Equation z7 10 is satisfied by cos2k sin2k z 1,and,by,z  i , therefore the given equation is 7 7 satisfied by 2k 2k z cos isin ,k 1,2,3,4,.5,.... 7 7 The sum of these roots is  2 4 6 2 cos cos cos    7 7 7  But from the given equation the sum of the roots is also -1.
Therefore, 2 4 6 1 cos cos cos  7 7 7 2 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, we have studied some theorems and determine the roots of equation using complex variables.
