This is one of the great advantages of distance learning; you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suit you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to a lecturer.
In the same way that a lecturer might set you some reading to do, the study units tell you when to read your set books or other material.
Just as a lecturer might give you an in-class exercise, your study units provide exercises for you to do at appropriate points.
Each of the study units follows a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the subject matter of the unit and how a particular unit is integrated with the other units and the course as a whole.
Next is a set of learning objectives.
These objectives enable you know what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
You should use these objectives to guide your study.
When you have finished the units you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If you make a habit of doing this you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.
Remember that your tutor’s job is to assist you.
When you need help, don’t hesitate to call and ask your tutor to provide it.
1 Read this Course Guide thoroughly.
2 Organize a study schedule.
Refer to the ‘Course Overview’ for more details.
Note the time you are expected to spend on each unit and how the assignments relate to the units.
Whatever method you chose to use, you should decide on it and write in your own dates for working on each unit.
xCIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3 Once you have created your own study schedule, do everything you can to stick to it.
The major reason that students fail is that they lag behind in their course work.
4 Turn to Unit 1 and read the introduction and the objectives for the unit.
5 Assemble the study materials.
Information about what you need for a unit is given in the ‘Overview’ at the beginning of each unit.
You will almost always need both the study unit you are working on and one of your set of books on your desk at the same time.
6 Work through the unit.
The content of the unit itself has been arranged to provide a sequence for you to follow.
As you work through the unit you will be instructed to read sections from your set books or other articles.
Use the unit to guide your reading 7 Review the objectives for each study unit to confirm that you have achieved them.
If you feel unsure about any of the objectives, review the study material or consult your tutor.
8 When you are confident that you have achieved a unit’s objectives, you can then start on the next unit.
Proceed unit by unit through the course and try to pace your study so that you keep yourself on schedule.
9 When you have submitted an assignment to your tutor for marking, do not wait for its return before starting on the next unit.
Keep to your schedule.
When the assignment is returned, pay particular attention to your tutor’s comments, both on the tutor- marked assignment form and also written on the assignment.
Consult your tutor as soon as possible if you have any questions or problems.
10 After completing the last unit, review the course and prepare yourself for the final examination.
Check that you have achieved the unit objectives (listed at the beginning of each unit) and the course objectives (listed in this Course Guide).

Amplification consists of magnifying a signal by transferring energy to it from an external source; whereas a transistor switch is a device for controlling a relatively large current between or voltage across two terminals by means of a small control current or voltage applied at a third terminal.
There are two major families of transistors are bipolar junction transistors, or BJTs; and field-effect transistors, or FETs.
As will be shown, the BJT acts essentially as a current-controlled device, while the FET behaves as a voltage-controlled device.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, students should be able to: • be able to IDENTIFY basic transistor amplifier topologies • be able to ANALYZE basic amplifier topologies for gains and resistances • be able to DISCUSS the relative properties of various amplifier topologies • be able to DESIGN basic amplifiers to meet or exceed stated specifications.
1CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) The pn junction forms the basis of a large number of semiconductor devices.
A BJT is formed by joining three sections of semiconductor material, each with a different doping concentration.
The three sections can be either a thin nregion sandwiched between p+ and p layers, or a p region between n and n+ layers, where the superscript “plus” indicates more heavily doped material.
The resulting BJTs are called pnp and npn transistors, respectively: The figure 1.1 below shows the block diagrams and circuit symbols of both the npn ad the pnp transistors.
Figure 1.1 transistor symbols Figure 1.2 electron flows in transistors The operation of the npn BJT can be explained by considering the transistor as consisting of two back-to-back pn junctions.
The base- emitter (BE) junction acts very much like a diode when it is forward- 2CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS biased; thus, the corresponding flow of hole and electron currents from base to emitter when the collector is open and the BE junction is forward-biased, is shown in figure 1.2.Note that the electron current has been shown larger than the hole current, because of the heavier doping of the n side of the junction.
Some of the electron-hole pairs in the base will recombine; the remaining charge carriers will give rise to a net flow of current from base to emitter.
It is also important to observe that the base is much narrower than the emitter section of the transistor.
The flow of electrons in the transistor is represented by the equation below.
I = I + I ……………………………………………………………..1 E B C Since the transistor is biased in the active region a small base current controls the much larger collector current.
Where I = βI …………………………………………………………..2 C B where β is a current amplification factor dependent on the physical properties of the transistor.
Typical values of β range from 20 to 200.
The operation of a pnp transistor is completely similar to that of the npn device, with the roles of the charge carriers (and therefore the signs of the currents) reversed.
I = I + b I …………………………………………………………….3 E B B I = (1+ b )I ………………...………………………………………….4 E B from the equation (4) above I I = E ………………………………………………….…………5 B (1+ b ) (cid:230) b (cid:246) I = (cid:231)(cid:231) (cid:247)(cid:247) I …………….…………………………..……….………6 C Ł 1+ b ł E Equation 6 can be written as I = a I C E (cid:230) b (cid:246) a = (cid:231) (cid:247) a Thus (cid:231) (cid:247) where = common base current gain.
Ł 1+ b ł 3CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.2 Bipolar Junction Transistor Configurations Transistors can be configured in three different modes with one pair of terminals for the input and another pair for the output.
These configurations are: 1.
Common emitter 2.
Common collector 3.
Common base.
• Common Emitter In the common emitter configuration, the input terminal is the base while the output terminal is the collector and the emitter is common to both the input and the output as shown in figure 1.3 below.
Figure 1.3 Common Emitter configurations output_current I The current gain for this configuration is given by = C input_current I B • Common Collector In the common collector configuration, the input terminal is the base while the output terminal is the emitter and the collector is common to both the input and the output as shown in figure 3.4 below.
Figure 1.4 Common collector configurations I The current gain for this configuration is given by E I B 4CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS • Common Base In the common base configuration, the input terminal is the emitter while the output terminal is the collector and the base is common to both the input and the output as shown in figure 1.5 below Figure 1.5 common base configuration I The current gain for this configuration is given by C I E The gain for the CB configuration is always less than 1, so the CB configuration is not used for current amplification .The CC and CE configurations both have a high gain but the input impedance of the CE configuration is higher than that of the CC.
This makes the CE configuration the preferred choice for amplifiers in circuit design.
3.3 Loads Lines The load line is a line drawn based on the DC operating characteristics of the circuit.
It enables the visualization of the transistor characteristics.
It is determined by using the DC equations of the circuit.
The Ic (max) and Vce (max) are used to determine the end points of the line, these points are then joined together and superimposed on the transistor characteristics.
5CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Figure 1.6 Amplifier circuit From the circuit 1.6, the analysis is done below From the output equation V = I R + V cc C C CE The load line is determined by identifying the two endpoints of the line.
The are determined by assuming V = 0 and finding Ic, and the V CE subscribe is determined by assuming Ic= 0.
From the output equation, with Ic = 0, Vcc = V CE With V = 0 CE Vcc = IcRc Vcc Ic(max) = Rc The load line is sketched in the figure 1.7 below 6CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Figure 1.7 load line The curves are generated at different base currents.
The Q point (operating Point) is the intersection of the Ic and the Vce on the load line for any particular base current.
From the graphs, as Ic rises from 0, the mode of operation of the transistor changes from cutoff to active and when the Ic gets to the maximum, the transistor gets to the saturation region of operation.
Example 1 Given the circuit below, determine the load line.
From the output equation V = I R + V cc C C CE With Vce = 0 10 Ic(max) = = 2.5mA 4K With Ic = 0 7CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Vce = 10V 3.4 Bipolar Junction Transistor Biasing The transistor can serve either as a switch or an amplifier.
The mode of operation of each transistor is determined by the bias condition in which it operates.
Biasing can be defined as the setting up of the DC voltages and current in an electronic circuit.
From the output characteristics, the transistor has 3 regions of operation.
(i) Saturation region (ii) Active region (iii) Cutoff region Figure 1.8 Q-point The Q point or dc operating point is that point on the load line where the I and V intercept on the load line.
The transistor when operating as a cq ceq switch is biased in the saturation or cutoff region but for the transistor to be used as an amplifier it is biased in the active region.
With transistor in the forward active region the voltage across the B-E junction is V subscribe (on) is 0.7V for silicon transistors and 0.4V for germanium transistors.
The determination of the q point is through the process of biasing.
8CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Example 2 Calculate the base, collector and emitter currents for the circuit shown below.β =200 From the output equation Vcc = IcRc + V CE From the input equation V = I R + V BB B B BE V - V 4- 0.7 I = BB BE = = 15m A B R 220K B Ic = βI = (200)(15μA) = 3mA B I = (1+β).
I = (200+1) (15μA) = 3.02mA E B V = Vcc – IcRc = 10 – (3mA)(2K) = 4V CE 3.5 Types Common Emitter Biasing There are different types of bias circuit with each having its advantages and disadvantages.

Base Bias This is the simplest type and is also known as fixed bias.
The quiescent base current is established by a single base resistor as shown in figure 1.9 below.
9CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Figure 1.9 base bias Biasing of this circuit will involve the selection of appropriate values for the base resistance and collector resistance.

The beta (β) varies with temperature so any circuit built with too much dependence on β will be very unstable.
• Base Bias with Collector Feedback The base is connected to the collector as shown in the circuit in figure 1.10 below Figure 1.10 Base bias with collector feedback Output equation V = (I + I )R + V …………………………………………………..1 CC C B C CE The collector current and the base currents flow through the collector resistor But I >> I C B Vcc IC(sat) = Rc Since there is no emitter resistor the out put equation becomes V = (I + I )R + V CC C B C C V = Vcc- (I + I )R C C B C Since Vc also forms part of the input equation, the input equation becomes 12CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS V = I R + V C B B BE Vcc- (I + I )R = I R + V C B C B B BE Since I >> I C B Vcc- I R = I R + V C C B B BE Ic But I = B b IcR B + V = Vcc- I R b BE C C The collector current can be derived from the expression below.

Small-signal models for the BJT take advantage of the relative linearity of the base and collector curves in the vicinity of an operating point.
These linear circuit models work very effectively, providing that the transistor voltages and currents remain within some region around the operating point.
This condition is usually satisfied in small-signal amplifiers used to magnify low-level signals (e.g., sensor signals).
For the purpose of our discussion, we use the hybrid-parameter (h- parameter) small-signal model of the BJT, to be discussed presently.
Note that a small-signal model assumes that the DC bias point (Q-point) of the transistor has been established.
The following convention will be used: each voltage and current is assumed to be the superposition of a DC component (the quiescent voltage or current) and a small-signal AC component.
The former is denoted by an uppercase letter and the latter by an uppercase letter preceded by the symbol Δ.
Thus, iB = IBQ + Δ IB iC = ICQ + Δ IC vCE = VCEQ + Δ VCE 19CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, student should be able to: • be able to IDENTIFY the transistor hybrid parameters • be able to ANALYZE amplifier topologies for gains and impedances • be able to DISCUSS the relative properties of various amplifier configurations • be able to DESIGN basic amplifiers to meet or exceed stated specifications.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Transistor Hybrid parameters The Hybrid parameters are specifications used in the analysis of transistor amplifiers there are four h parameters and these are: • The parameter hie which is approximately equal to the ratio Δ VBE/ ΔIB.
Physically, this parameter represents the forward resistance of the BE junction.
• The parameter hre which is representative of the fact that the IB- VBE curve is slightly dependent on the actual value of the collector- emitter voltage, VCE.
However, this effect is virtually negligible in any applications of interest to us.
Thus, we shall assume that hre ≈ 0.
A typical value of hre for VCE ≥ 1 V is around 10-2.
• The parameter hf e is the current ratio Δ IC /ΔIB.
This parameter represents the current gain of the transistor and is approximately equivalent to the parameter β introduced earlier.
For the purpose of our discussion, β and hf e will be interchangeable, although they are not exactly identical.
• The parameter hoe may be calculated as hoe = ΔIC/ Δ VCE From the collector characteristic curves.
This parameter is a physical indication of the fact that the IC-VCE curves in the linear active region are not exactly flat; hoe represents the upward slope of these curves and therefore has units of conductance (S).
Typical values of hoe are around 10-5 S. this parameter is often assumed to be negligible.
20CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.2 Analysis of a Single Stage Transistor Amplifier Small Signal Operation In order to fully analyze a transistor amplifier, the analysis is broken into AC and DC analysis.
In the DC analysis all capacitors are regarded as open circuits, while for the AC analysis, the capacitors are regarded as short circuits and the DC source is replaced by a ground.
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the different specifications of the circuit.
These specifications include the input impedance, output impedance and the circuit gain.
Example 1 Given the circuit below, determine the Q point voltage and current values and AC open-loop voltage gain of the amplifier of Figure 2.1; the amplifier employs a 2N5088 npn transistor.
β=350 Figure 2.1 21CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS • Analysis Q-point calculation We first write the collector circuit equation by applying KVL: VCC = VCE + RCIC + REIE = VCE + RCIC + RE(IB + IC) ≈ VCE + (RC + RE)IC where the emitter current has been approximately set equal to the collector current since the current gain is large and IC >> IB.
Next, we write the base circuit equation, also via KVL: VBB = RBIB + VBE + REIE = (RB + (β + 1)RE)IB + Vbe The above equation can be solved numerically (with hf e = β) to obtain: V - V 6- 0.6 I = BB BE = = 40m A B R + (b + 1)R 100· 103 + 351· 100 B E Then, IC = βIB = 350 X 40 x 10-6 = 14 mA And VCE = VCC − (RC + RE)IC = 12 − 600 x 40 x 10-3 = 3.6 V Thus, the Q point for the amplifier is: IBQ = 40 μA, ICQ = 14 mA and VCEQ = 3.6 V Confirming that the transistor is indeed in the active region.
From previous discussion, it has been verified that the common emitter configuration is the best for signal amplification.
We shall be looking at the single stage common emitter amplifier.
Any amplifier circuit has the following parts: 1) The Bias Circuit 2) The Load Circuit 3) The Coupling Circuit 22CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The bias circuit has been discussed so we focus on the other component parts.
Fig 2.2: CE amplifier circuit From the diagram above, the following are the responsibility of the different components.
C = Coupling capacitor.
it prevents dc signals in the source from upsetting the amplifier’s Q point values.
R and R = potential divider bias resistors 1 2 R = load/collector resistor C R = Emitter resistor E Given a common emitter amplifier circuit, to analyze such a circuit we need to consider its DC and AC characteristics.
Example 2 Given the circuit with the following parameters below, (βdc =150 and βac = 160) Where βdc =DC gain and βac = AC gain.
Determine the circuit specifications given the following component parameters.
RE = 600Ω Rc = 1kΩ R1 = 22kΩ R2= 4.7kΩ 23CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Fig 2.3: CE amplifier circuit In order to understand the operation of the circuit given above, we will have to perform both the DC and AC analysis.
• DC Analysis Before the DC analysis is performed, all coupling capacitors are regarded as open circuit.
This will yield the following representation of the circuit above.
Fig 2.4: 24CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS From Ohms Law, Vin Rin = Iin Vin =Vbe + I R .
Vbe = 0.7 for silicon transistor which is the most E E widely used type.
I R >> Vbe E E Vin = I R E E I R Rin = E E Iin Vin = IinRin = I R but IE » Ic = βIb .
The base current Ib is the input E E current and RIN is the resistance at the base so, Iin = Ib and RIN = RB Vin = b IbR =IbRB E b IbR RB = E canceling Ib from both the numerator and denominator we Ib have the DC input resistance RB to be, RB = b R E Inserting the values of the components, The Dc input resistance of the circuit is give by RIN =RB = b dcR =150 x 600 = 90KΩ E Note: If RB is more than 10 times R2 then the voltage divider rules is used (cid:230) R2 (cid:246) (cid:230) 4.7k (cid:246) VB = (cid:231) (cid:247) Vcc = (cid:231) (cid:247) x12 = 2.11V Ł R1+ R2ł Ł 22k + 4.7kł VE =VB –Vbe =2.11 – 0.7=1.41V VE 1.41 IE = = = 2.4mA RE 600 Since Ic =IE VC = Vcc- IcRC = 12 – 2.4 = 9.6V VCE = VC –VE = 9.6 – 1.41 = 8.19V 25CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS • AC Analysis For the ac analysis the circuit is redrawn with the following assumptions.
1.
All capacitors are short circuit 2.
DC sources are replaced by ground This circuit is further reduced to the circuit shown below Rin (base) is the resistance at the base of the transistor and it is derived with the ac emitter resistance added in series to the RE.
Rin (base) = βac(re + RE) 25mV The ac emitter resistance is given by re = IE 3.3 Input Impedance The total input impedance of the circuit is the parallel combination of R1 ,R2 and Rin(base).Thus the circuit is reduced to the following 26CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Input Impedance = R1//R2//Rin(base).
From the component values of the circuit assuming a source impedance of 300Ω, the input impedance is computed to be Rin(base) = 160(re + 600) 25mV 25mV But re = = =10.4Ω IE 2.4mA IE is the DC emitter current computed to be 2.4mA.
Rin (base) = 160 (10.4 + 600) Rin(base) =160(610.4) = 97664 Ω The voltage at the base of the transistor (Vb) is determined below If RS << Rin(input impedance) then Vb = Vin.
If not then the voltage divider equation is used as shown below.
(cid:230) Rin (cid:246) Vb = (cid:231) (cid:247) Vin Ł RS + Rinł 27CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Compute the input impedance and the voltage at the base of the transistor 3.4 Output Impedance The output resistance looking at the collector is approximately equal to R .
In situations where a load is connected in parallel with the RC, the C output resistance will be equal to the parallel combination of both the Rc and the load resistance.
Thus a load (RL) connected to the output affects the gain.
RC1=RC//RL 3.5 Voltage Gain The voltage gain is the ratio between the output voltage and the input voltage.
(cid:230) Output_voltage(cid:246) AV = (cid:231)(cid:231) (cid:247)(cid:247) Ł Input_voltage ł VC IcRC = Vb IE(re+ RE) IERC IE(re+ RE) RC AV = (re+ RE) This is the voltage gain from the base to the collector of the transistor.
The total circuit gain is made up of the attenuation due to the source resistance and the base to collector gain as shown below.
(cid:230) Rin (cid:246) Vb = (cid:231) (cid:247) Vin Ł RS + Rinł 28CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS RC (cid:230) Vb (cid:246) AVI = (cid:231) (cid:247) (re+ RE)Ł Vinł 3.6 Effects of Emitter Bypass Capacitor on the CE Amplifier When a capacitor is connected across the emitter resistor it bypasses the RE as the capacitor acts as a sort circuit for the AC signals.
Thus the Ac voltage gain becomes RC AV = RE is neglected and the gain increases.
(re) This increase in gain however leads to a reduction in gain stability because the re ( ac emitter resistance varies with temperature) 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you have been introduced to the small signal operation of the BJT amplifier and the transistor hybrid parameters.

Thus, FETs behave as voltage-controlled resistors.
These devices can be grouped into three major categories.
The first two categories are both types of metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistors,or MOSFETs: enhancement-mode MOSFETs and depletion-mode MOSFETs.
The third category consists of junction field-effect transistors, or JFETs.
In addition, each of these devices can be fabricated either as an n-channel device or as a p-channel device, where the n or p designation indicates the nature of the doping in the semiconductor channel.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, students are expected be able to: • be able to IDENTIFY field effect transistor symbols • be able to ANALYZE basic FET amplifier topologies for gains and resistances • be able to DISCUSS the relative properties of various FET configurations • be able to DESIGN basic amplifiers to meet or exceed stated specifications.
31CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Junction Field Effect Transistors There are two general classes of FETs (i) The Metal Oxide Semiconductor FET (MOSFET) (ii) The Junction FET (JFET) 3.2 FET Configurations The FET is similar to the BJT transistor in terms of the number of terminals and configuration.
The FET has three terminals as shown below.
D G S Fig 3.1 FET symbol The configurations include: (i) Common Source V V O IN (ii) Common Drain (iii) Common Gate V V O IN V V O IN Fig 3.2 FET Configurations 32CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The JFET is made up of a Semiconductor region known as the Channel with ohmic contacts at each end.
The Channel material can either be N- type of P-type as shown below: drain drain gate P N P gate N P N source source Fig 3.3 N channel JFET Fig 3.4 P channel JFET The JFET is always operated with the Gate to Source voltage in Reverse Bias as shown below.
source P drain e- N P V DS V GS Fig 3.5 JFET Operation In a P channel JFET, the P and N Junctions are reversed from those of the N Channel.
In the P channel device, the Majority Carriers are holes (Positive Charges) and due to the low mobility of holes.
The N-channel is often times preferred.
When V is increased, more positive ions are injected into the P side GS and this narrows the depletion region there by widening the channel and increasing the current flow.
When V is decreased (made more GS negative), more positive ions are taken from the P side and the depletion region widens leading to a narrowing of the channel, reducing I flow.
D When V becomes more negative to a point where ID=0, the GS conduction known as pinch-off arises.
33CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Drain current at Pinch-Off is essentially zero.
The PN JFET is a normally-On device and its current flow is controlled by the gate and can only be switched off by applying a suitable voltage to the gate terminal For the JFET, 2 Ø V ø I = I Œ1- GS œ D DSSŒ œ V º GS(off)ß Where I = maximum value of I when V = 0 DSS D GS V = value of V when FET will be off GS(off) GS +V -V DD DD R R D D D D I D G G V V DS DS S S R V R R S D R S G G Example 1 Given I = 12mA, V = -5V, determine the value of I at V = 0, DSS GS (off) D GS -1, -4.

It leads to instability in systems and is only used in oscillator design.

From our previous discussion, the gain of an amplifier (Voltage gain) without feedback is higher than the gain with negative feedback while it is lower than the gain of the amplifier with positive feedback.

3.3 Effect of Negative Feedback on Amplifiers 1.
Gain and Gain Stability Typical amplifiers are subject to changes such as temperature, dc supply levels and ageing.
Such change results in variation in amplifier gain.
Negative feedback helps to reduce the variation in gain to acceptable limits (or stabilize the gain).
For a NFB amplifier A ACL = 1+ A01 b A01β>>1 01 A 1 A = 01 = CL A b b 01 The feed back ration β is often determined by the ratio of two resistors.
Example 1 The gain of an amplifier is found to be 750 on test but under conditions of reduced dc supply and external loading, the value reduced to 400.
Compare this percentage variation for the amplifier with the corresponding variation if NFB of 43CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS (a) 0.005 (b) 0.03 (c) 0.1 is used.
Solution Percentage variation of gain without feed back is original- new 100 750- 400 100 · = · = 46.67% original 1 750 1 Using a β of 0.005 A 750 750 The maximum gain =1+ Ab = 1+ (750· 0.005) = 4.75 = 157.9 400 Amin = = 133.3 1+ (400· 0.005) 157.9- 133.3 100 percentagevariation = · = 15.6% 157.9 1 From this we observe that the gain of the amplifier now ranges from 157.9 to 133.3 as against the 750 to 400 and the variation is now 15.6% as against 46.7%.
Using a β of 0.03 750 Amax = = 31.9 1+ (750· 0.03) 400 Amin = = 30.8 1+ (400· 0.03) 31.9- 30.8 100 percentagevariation = · = 3.45% 31.9 1 From the above, as the β increases, the gain reduces and the stability increases.
Thus, negative feedback decreases gain but increases stability.
2.
Decreased Distortion Amplifiers exhibit a measure of non-linearity due to the curvature of the characteristic curve of active (cut off and saturation points).
The non- linearity results in harmonic distortion and Clipping.
Each output without distortion has a harmonic distortion component D. Vout = AVin+ D (1) From the feed back definition (PFB) 44CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Vin = Vi+ b Vo (2) But Vo = AVin+ D (3) \ Vin = Vi+ b AVin+ b D Expanding Vin = Vi+ b AVin+ b D Collecting like terms Vin- b AVin = Vi+ b D ( ) Vin 1- b A = Vi+ b D Vi+ b D Vin = Substitute in equation 3 1- b A (cid:230) Vi+ b D(cid:246) Vo = A(cid:231) (cid:247) + D Taking LCM Ł 1- b A ł AVi+ Ab D + D 1- b A ( ) AVi+ Ab D+ D 1- b A AVi+ Ab D+ D- Ab D = 1- b A 1- b A AVi+ D AVi D Vo = = + 1- b A 1- b A 1- b A AVi D The term = actual amplified signal.

Example 2 In an amplifier without feedback, the gain is 36dB and the harmonic distortion at normal output level is 10%.
Determine.
(a) The gain (b) The distortion When NFB is applied with the feedback factor of 16dB, Feedback factor = loop gain = βA 45CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Solution A Acl = Gain (dB) = 20logA 1+ b A For no feed back 36 = 20logA \ A = 101.8 = 63 Feed back factor = 16 = 20logβA βA = 100.8 = 6.3 βA = 6.3 but A = 63 6.3 \ b = = 0.1 63 Gain using NFB Β = 0.1 63 63 Acl = = = 8.63 1+ 63· 0.1 7.3 20log8.63 = 18.7dB D 0.1 Distortion = = · 100= 1.36% 1- b A 7.3 3.
Increased Bandwidth Amplifiers have a frequency range over which the gain and phase shift are approximately constant.
For frequencies outside the band (mid-band range), the gain falls.
When NFB is applied, the gain drops.
The product of the gain and bandwidth must remain constant; so as the gain drops by a factor, the bandwidth increases by that same factor.
Example 3 An RC coupled amplifier has a frequency gain of 300 and a response from 100Hz to 20KHz.
A negative feedback with β = 0.02 is incorporated into the circuit.
Determine the new system performance.

The introduction of the operational amplifier in integrated circuit form marked the beginning of a new era in modern electronics.
Since the introduction of the first IC op-amp, the trend in electronic instrumentation has been to move away from the discrete (individual-component) design of electronic circuits, toward the use of integrated circuits for a large number of applications.
The majority of op-amps have three stages.
The first stage converts the differential signal into a single-ended one; the second one provides the bulk on the gain and the third one the required output power.
2.0OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, student should be able to: • be able to IDENTIFY op-amp circuit topologies • be able to ANALYZE op-amp circuits • be able to DISCUSS the relative properties of op-amp circuits.
3.0MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Ideal Op-Amp The Ideal Op Amp parameters are derived to simplify circuit analysis.
Op amps depart from the ideal in two ways.
First, dc parameters such as input offset voltage are large enough to cause departure from the ideal.
51CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The ideal assumes that input offset voltage is zero.
Second, ac parameters such as gain are a function of frequency, so they go from large values at dc to small values at high frequencies.
The table below lists the ideal opamp parameters.
Table 5.1 Ideal Opamp assumptions Figure 5.1 ideal Opamp 3.2 Op-Amp Configurations There are two basic configurations of the operational amplifier and these are: (i) The Noninverting Op Amp The noninverting op amp configuration has the input signal connected to its noninverting input.
There is no input offset voltage because VOS = VE = 0, hence the negative input must be at the same voltage as the positive input.
The op amp output drives current into RF until the negative input is at the voltage, VIN.
This action causes VIN to appear across RG.
The voltage divider rule is used to calculate VIN; VOUT is the input to the voltage divider and VIN is the output of the voltage divider.
Since no current can flow into either op amp lead.
52CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Figure 5.2 Non inverting opamp configurations From the circuit shown in the fig above, the gain of the noninverting configuration is derived as: (ii) The Inverting Op Amp In the inverting configuration, the input is fed through the input resistor to the inverting pin and the noninverting input of the inverting op amp circuit is grounded.
One assumption made is that since the opamp has an infinite input resistance, so the feedback keeps inverting the input of the opamp at a virtual ground (not actual ground but acting like ground).
The current flow in the input leads is assumed to be zero, hence the current flowing through RG equals the current flowing through RF.
Using Kirchoff’s law, and the Equation is written with a minus sign inserted because this is the inverting input.
Algebraic manipulation gives.
Figure 5.3 Inverting opamp configurations 53CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS From the inverting Opamp configuration the gain is derived is follows: V V I = IN = - I = - OUT 1 R 2 R G F V R OUT = - F V R IN G Notice that the gain is only a function of the feedback and gain resistors, so the feedback has accomplished its function of making the gain independent of the op amp parameters.
The actual resistor values are determined by the impedance levels that the designer wants to establish.
If RF = 10 k and RG = 10 k the gain is minus one as shown in Equation.
3.3 Applications of Op-Amps The operational amplifier can be configured to perform mathematical operations.
Some of these are listed below: 1.
Adder or Summer The adder circuit of the operational amplifier provides an output voltage proportional to the algebraic sum of the inputs, each multiplied by a constant gain factor.

The most common source of dc power supplies are batteries but they are faced with the following challenges: • Limited life • Reduction in terminal voltage over time • Limited capacity 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, students should be able to: • to introduce the students to the principles of DC power supply systems • to introduce students to the component parts of the DC power supply • to introduce student to the design of Dc power supplies and voltage regulators.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 60CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.1 DC Power Supply There are two types of DC power supply.
These are: • Unregulated Power Supply: This is a power supply whose terminal voltage is affected significantly by the amount of load.
As the load draws more current the DC terminal voltage becomes less.
• Regulated Power Supply: This DC power supply has a terminal voltage which remains constant regardless of the amount of current drawn from it.
A regulated power supply is achieved by the addition of a voltage regulating circuit to an unregulated DC power supply.
Examples of voltage regulators are: 1.
Zener diode voltage regulators 2.
Transistor series voltage regulator 3.
Integrated circuit voltage regulators both adjust able types and the fixed types.
(e.g.
7805, 7808, e.t.c., LM 317, 117) The block diagram of a typical dc power supply system is given below: ACpl yfr osmys te Smoothening Voltage mains Transformer Rectifier Pure dc Circuit regulator Fig 6.1: Components of a DC Power Supply 3.2 Components of a Typical DC Power Supply System (i) The Transformer The transformer is responsible for stepping down the voltage level of incoming ac mains supply.
There are basically two classes of transformers.
These are: • The step-up transformer – This steps up the voltage from the ac mains.
Its output voltage is higher than the input voltage level.
• The step-down transformer – This is a reverse of the step-up transformer and its output voltage level is lower than the input voltage.
The dc power supply utilizes the step down transformer.
(ii) Rectifiers 61CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The purpose of the rectifier is to convert the AC signal from the transformer to DC.
There are also two classes of rectifiers and these are: • The half wave rectification • The full wave rectification Under the full wave rectification we have: • Center tapped transformer full wave rectification • The bridge rectifier full wave rectification 3.3 Half Wave Rectifier The circuit below shows the basic half wave rectifier circuit and the corresponding wave form.
Fig 6.2: Half wave rectifier The rectification is achieved by the use of a single diode due to the diode’s characteristics of conducting in one direction only in forward bias (forward bias).
Mode of Operation During the positive half cycle of the input AC Voltage the diode D is forward biased and it conducts assuming the voltage peak is much grater than 0.6V (diode drop for silicon) the voltage and current of the load flow but during the negative half cycle, the diode is reversed biased and does not conduct thus and 1, are zero thus the output of the half wave rectifier is a pulsating DC voltage which is used only in battery charging.
The frequency of the ripple is the same as that of the input voltage.
When this output is measured by a DC meter we get the average positive value for both voltage and current.
The half wave rectifier converts the sinusoidal wave form with an average value of zero to a unidirectional wave form with a non zero average waveform.
The wave forms for the half wave rectifier is displayed in the figure below.
62CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Fig 6.3: Half wave rectifier wave forms Figure half wave rectifier input/output wave forms.
Instantaneous voltage And being forward resistance and load resistance And are peak values The DC ammeter is connected to indicate the average value of current passing through it.
Mathematically the average current Idc is an integration of the instantaneous current over the half cycle.
The AC meter on the other hand reads the effective or rms value of the current passing through it.
Mathematically, the rms value squared which is the area of one cycle of the curve divided by the base is given by 63CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS For half wave Therefore = = rms value of load current the V (dc) or load L voltage is also derived in as similar manner.
Where 3.4 Efficiency of Rectifiers The efficiency of rectification is given by the ratio of the output DC power to the total amount of input power supplied to the circuit.
It is also called the conversion efficiency.
= transformer secondary winding resistance Dividing up and down by 64CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS If is neglected, the efficiency becomes 40.6%.
This is the maximum possible efficiency of the half wave rectifier.
The frequency of the half wave rectifier output is the same as that of the AC input.
Peak Inverse Voltage It is the maximum voltage the diode has to withstand without failing when it is non conducting.
For the half wave rectifier it is .
Ripple Factor This is a measure of the AC components (fluctuating components) present in the rectifier output.
It is given by: I V r = rms = rms Idc Vdc This shows that the rms ripple exceeds the DC output voltage and thus the half wave rectifier is a poor rectifier circuit.
Voltage Regulation This is the variation of DC output voltage as a result of variation of the DC load current.
When there is no load no output current flows, but when the output current flows there is a drop over Rs and RF.
( = diode forward resistance and = transformer secondary resistance winding.)
65CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Substituting above with the VR equation we have Example 1 A half wave rectifier using a silicon diode has secondary E.M.F of 14.14 Vrms with a resistance of 0.2.
The diode forward resistance is 0.05 and its threshold voltage is 0.7V.
If the load resistance is 10, determine (i) DC load current (ii) DC load voltage (iii) VR (iv) Efficiency i. ii) iii) iv) 3.5 Full Wave Rectifier Center Tapped In this case both half cycles are utilized with the help of two diodes working alternatively.
For full wave rectification the use of a transformer is essential but it is optional in the half wave rectification.
66CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Operation When the input is switched on, the ends of the transformer M and N become positive and negative with the mid point (center tap) at zero potential.
So when is forward biased, conducts through the load back to the center tap.
When the polarities of M and N are interchanged, becomes forward biased and reversed.
then conducts allowing current to flow through the load to the center tap.
From this we realize that and are actually half wave rectifiers but since they conduct alter negatively through the same load, the load sees a full wave rectified output.
Fig 6.4: Full wave rectifier center tapped The rms value of the output voltage .
The average value of the DC voltage is derived from the equation below Remember P = VI = R since V = IR In computing for we make use of the average or DC value of the circuit.
67CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS .
For Pin we make use of the rms value of current.
It is twice the value of the half wave circuit.
This is because both half cycles of the input wave are used.
It can also be seen that the frequency of the output is twice that of the input.
Ripple Factor As derived earlier, ripple factor is the ratio of the rms value of AC components of the output to the DC value of the load voltage: We came to the point where r = This shows that the ripple factor has dropped to 0.482 from 1.21 for the half wave.
Peak Inverse Voltage In the center tap transformer we realize that at the point when is contributing, is not because at that point the N is at a negative potential.
If our transformer is a 9 volt center tap is 9 volts.
If is conducting with the center tap at 0 volts.
The voltage difference between and is from +9V to -9 volts which is 18 volts.
Thus the diode must be able to withstand 18V or 2 times the V peak.
68CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Fig 6.5: Full wave rectifier center tapped wave forms Example 2 From the full wave rectifier shown below determine • The peak, rms values of load voltage • The peak, rms values of load current • The ripple factor • Peak and average diode currents • Total power supplied to the load Solution K = Transformer ratio = 312V From the transformer ratio the peak voltage of secondary = 156 V = V = = 78V MG GN 2 69CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 1.
Peak value of the load voltage = 78V Average value of the load voltage = Rms value of load voltage = 2.
Peak value of load current = 3.
Ripple factor = 4.
Peak diode current = peak load current = 0.78 Average diode current = Since each diode conducts for one load 5.
Total power supplied to the load P = 3.5 Full Wave Bridge Rectifier It is the most frequently used rectifier circuit for electronic DC power supplies.
It requires four diodes but the center tapped transformer is not required.
It comes in 3 distinct physical forms: 1) Four discrete diodes 2) As a part of an array of diodes in an IC 3) One devices inside a four terminal case diagram Mode of Operation During the positive input half cycle the M terminal is positive with this, diode one and diode three become forward biased (conducting) while the diode two and diode four are reversed biased.
The direction of current flow is indicated in diagram A. while when N becomes positive with respect to M, diodes one and three become reversed biased and diodes two and four become forward biased.
The current flow is illustrated in the diagrams below 70CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Fig 6.6: Full wave bridge rectifier The current flow through the load in one direction with point A acting as the anode and point C the cathode the output frequency is twice that of the input wave form because both halves of the input wave form are utilized and each diode has a peak inverse voltage of magnitude equal to the peak of the transformer secondary voltage or current.
The rms and average values are the same as that of the center tap.
The ripple factor is also the same at 0.482.
3.7 Smoothing Circuits The easiest way to smooth a circuit is by adding a capacitor in parallel to the resistive load.
Instantaneous voltage across the capacitor and the load during diode cut off is given by: .
It is much greater than the period of the supply wave form.
The output of the DC consisting .
The bigger the capacitance the better the smoothing.
Capacitor Filter During the positive half, the capacitor charges and when the input voltage begins to drop the capacitor maintains the charge and discharges through the reverse biasing the diode.
The rate the discharge is determined by -time constant.
The larger the time constant, the less the capacitor will discharge and the higher the the lower the ripple.
The variation in the output voltage during charging and discharging is known as the ripple.
Ripple factor is an indication of effectiveness of the filter and it is defined as rms ripple voltage.
71CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The lower the ripple factor the better the filter t From the diagram, Vc = Vp(in)RC exponential decay Since the discharge time for the capacitor from one peak to the next approximately tends to T when reaches its minimum value.
t Vc = Vp(in)RC Since RC tends to T (for improved filtering and reduced ripple becomes less than 1).
Therefore Therefore t t Vc(min)= Vp(in)RC = Vp(min)(1- RC Peak ripple voltage Peak ripple voltage = Since the ripple waveform is a saw tooth diode to convert peak to rms.
72CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Example 3 Determine the ripple factor for the filtered bridge rectifier.
Vrms = 115V V secondary = Filtered Rms ripple voltage = Ripple voltage= r = The average value of the voltage from the full wave rectifiers is twice that of the half wave.
Thus, 2(Vpk - Vd) Vdc = = 0.3185(Vpk - Vd) p The half wave rectifier is the simplest but its average dc voltage output is low and it has a large amount of ripple which has a frequency equal to the input frequency.
The full wave (centre tapped and bridge circuits) have a higher output voltage with reduced ripple.
Its ripple has a frequency that is twice the value of the input voltage frequency.
It requires diodes with twice the PIV (Peak Inverse Voltage) rating.
Thus PIV = 2V for the centre peak tapped arrangement.

The output voltage is controlled by internal circuitry and is relatively independent of the current supplied by the regulator.
9.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, student should be able to: • identify voltage regulator circuits • analyze the different voltage regulator circuits • design voltage regulator circuits with the relevant protection circuits.
10.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Introduction to Voltage Regulators Voltage regulators are circuits incorporated into the unregulated DC power supply circuits and the ensure that the terminal voltage remains unchanged regardless of the variations in the input voltage provided the operational limits are not exceeded There are DC power classified as either: 1. series regulators 2. shunt regulators 3. switching regulators The basic diagram of a voltage regulator is shown below to consist of: 76CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS • A reference voltage circuit • An error amplifier • Current amplifier Io REFERENCE CURRENT Vo VOLTAGE + AMERPRLOIFRIE R AMPLIFIER - RL β 3.2 Voltage Regulators Figure of Merit Variations in the reference voltage can be caused by variations in the power supply voltage and this affects the output voltage.
This parameter known as line regulation is defined as ratio of change in output to a given change in input supply voltage.
D Vo Line regulation = D V+ Output resistance is defined as the rate of change of output voltage with output current.
D Vo R = - of D Io The change in Vo and Io is as a result of change in R with other L parameters remaining constant.
Load Regulation: This is the change in output voltage between no load current condition and full load current condition, expressed in percentage.
Vo(noload)- Vo(full_load) Load regulation = · 100% Vo(noload) 77CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.3 Series Pass Regulators Series regulators control or maintain a constant dc voltage output by continuously adjusting the voltage drop across a power transistor connected in series between the unregulated input and the load.
The transistors are biased in the linear region and as such are also called linear regulators.
They however are inefficient because a large amount of power is wasted in the pass transistor and they require big transformers and capacitors to scale the time voltage and filter it.
The figure below shows a simple series pass voltage regulator Vce IL Vin - Vo + Vz or This circuit can also be redrawn with a Darlington pair as the pass transistor for higher current.
Vi + - Q1 Q2 I0 Vo R2 LOAD R1 The basic building blocks of the voltage regulator include: • The Voltage reference: This provides a scaled version of the input which is stabilized by the Zener diode.
• The Error amplifier: This takes a scaled version of the output and compares it with the reference voltage and adjusts Vo via the series pass transistor.
VoR1 Vn = Vp = Vref (R1+ R2) The error signal Vd= Vp – Vn.
78CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The aim of the error amplifier is to drive the pass transistor in such a way that if the Vo is increasing, the transistor will reduce its amplification and if Vo is decreasing, the transistor will increase its amplification such that Vo is kept constant.
• The feedback network series to scale Vo to a value suitable for comparison against Vref by the error amplifier, (cid:230) R2(cid:246) Vo =(cid:231) 1+ (cid:247) Vref (Non- inverting OP AMP) Ł R1ł But Vref is fixed, so the only way to control Vo is by altering R / 2 R .
1 • The Series Pass element: The function of this is to boost the output current capabilities of the error amplifier.
It transfers large current to the load under the supervision and control of the error amplifier.
NPN transistors are mostly used for this.
From the circuit given below: V+ V+ - RVEOFELRTEANGCEE Vref + Q1 Q2 IO Vo R1 R2 From our equation, VoR2 Vref = Potential divider R1+ R2 Vref(R1+ R2) Vo = Vref R2 The open loop output resistance is the output resistance of the Series Pass transistors operating in the emitter follower configurations.
79CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS From the circuit diagram, The NPN BJT generates a collector circuit β times as large as that entering the base terminal.
Ic = βI B And releases both Ic and I to the Emitter.
B I = Ic + I , therefore IE = (β + 1)I E B B For low Power BJTs, V ~ 0.7 and β ~ 100 or more but BE (ON) For Power Transistors, V ~ 1V and β is in the range of 10s.For this BE (ON) reason, Darlington pairs are used to give β of the range of 1000s or more.
Example 1 From the circuit below: (a) Determine the voltage and current at the OP AMP output (b) Find the minimum value of Vi at which the circuit will still function properly.
Vi 33K Vref + R4 Q1 Vn - 510Ω Q2 2.5V 3.3K R5 IE2 IR5 IL Vo = 5V IR2 10K LOAD 10K RL = 1Ω V = 0.8 V = 1V BE1 BE2 β = 75 β = 15 1 2 Solution a. Vo = OP AMP output voltage A Io = OP AMP output current.
A From Kirchoff’s law, 80CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS I + I – I – I = 0 E2 R5 L R2 Therefore, I = I + I – I E2 L R2 R5 Since Vo = 5V and R = 1Ω, I = 5A L L Therefore, I = 5A, I = (β + 1) Iβ L E2 2 2 (cid:230) (cid:246) I Therefore, Iβ = (cid:231)(cid:231) E2 (cid:247)(cid:247) 2 Ł b + 1ł 2 (cid:230) 5 (cid:246) But I ~ I , therefore I = (cid:231) (cid:247) = 312.5mA E2 L β2 Ł 15+ 1ł I = I + I = 312 + I E1 β2 R5 R5 (cid:230) (cid:246) V I = (cid:231)(cid:231) BE2 (cid:247)(cid:247) R5 Ł R ł 5 I = 312.5mA E1 I = ( I ) = 312.5mA = 4.1mA β1 E1 β + 1 76 1 V = I R = (4.1mA)(510) = 0.0041A (510)=2.1V R4 β1 4 Therefore, the output voltage of the opamp is V = 5V + V + V + V OA BE2 BE1 R4 = 5V + 1 + 0.8 + 2.1 = 8.9V The output current of the opamp is the same as I , B1 I = I = 4.1mA OA β1 b.
For the circuit to work properly the opamp must be within the linear region and the Vi must be at least 2 Volts greater than V .
oA Therefore Vi ≥ 11V.
3.4 Protection Circuits The performance of power transistors is affected by a number of factors such as Power dissipation capabilities, maximum voltage and current rating, maximum junction temperature; etc.
This factor restricts the operation of the transistor to an area on the V & I curves known as the Safe Operating Area (SOA).
The SOA is defined as the area on the V and I curve within which the device can be operated without the risk of failure or degradation.
To ensure reliable operation, regulators are equipped with additional circuits which serves to limit the current or switch off the transistors 81CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS should they be pushed outside the SOA.
These circuits are inactive under normal operating conditions and get activated as soon as the SOA boundary is approached.
Examples of these circuits are: 1.
Overload Protection The purpose of this circuit is to prevent the current through the series pass transistor from exceeding a predetermined value.
This is also known as short circuit protection.
Vi R4 33K + R4 Q1 - Q2 OVERLOAD 2.5V PROTECTION Rsc Vo = 5V LOAD R2 R1 The protection circuit alone is shown below Vi IOA IB1 IC2 IB2 IE1 Q2 Rsc IE2 IO VO 82CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS A single transistor Q and R is used to implement the circuit.
The 2 SC function of R is to sense I (Io) and develop a voltage drop of SC E1 sufficient magnitude to switch on Q when Io reaches the preset value.

Then current in excess of I is 2 be B1max diverted to Q as I .
2 C2 Example Vi 33K 510Ω + Q1 - Q2 2.5V Rsc IRsc IL Vo = 5V IE2 LOAD 10K 10K In the circuit above, β = 75, V = 0.8V, β = 150, V = 0.7V, R = 2.2Ω, V = 12V i BE1 2 BE2 SC i For the overload protection, R = 0.7 SC I (RSC) I = 0.7 = 0.318 = 0.32A RSC 2.2 The maximum current as set by the overload protection is 320mA.
a.
With R = 25Ω, the actual load current becomes – L I = V = V = 5 = 0.2 = 200mA.
I = 200mA, I = 0mA L L o C1 C2 83CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS R R 25 L L V = I = 2.2 x 0.2 = 0.44V.
RSC LRSC The voltage drop across R = 0.44V but a value of 0.7V is SC needed to switch Q on.
So with 0.44V,Q is off and the 2 2 protection circuit is in active.
b.
With R = 10Ω, L I = V = 5 = 0.5 = 500mA L o R 10 L V = I R = 0.5 x 2.2 = 1.1V RSC L SC The voltage across R = 1.1V so the transistor Q is switched on.
SC 2 But I = 320mA, therefore V = 0.32 * 10Ω = 3.2V.
Vo = 3.2 L(max) RL V = V + V + V B1 RL BE1 BE2 V = 3.2 + 0.7 + 0.8 = 4.7V.

o I = ( VOA – V ) = 10 – 4.7 (output current of opamp) B1 R 510 4 I = 10.4mA OA But I = I B1 C1 β Therefore I = βI , I =I B1(max) C1max E1max L(max) I = (75 +1) B1(max) I = I = 320mA = 4.2mA B1(max) E1max (β+1) 76 The balance of I is absorbed by Q .
OA 2 Therefore I = I – I = 10.4 – 4.2 C2 OA B1max I = 6.2mA, I = I = 0.04mA C2 B2 C2 β 2 I + I = I ~ 6.2mA B2 C2 E2 The final current delivered to the load is given by I = I + I …………………………….Kirchoff’s current law.
L RSC E2 I = 320 + 6.2 = 326.2mA.
L 84CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 2.
SOA Protection To restrict the BJT within the SOA,I must be reduced as V rises c CE above a safe level.
This protection is used in circuits with a high possibility of transients or spikes in the unregulated input.
Vi R6 R3 D2 + R4 Q1 - 2.5V Q2 R5 Rsc Vo (5V) LOAD For values of V insufficient to turn on D the protection remains i 2 inactive.
From the zener diode characteristic curve below, when the voltage difference between V and V is beyond V , the zener diode i o Z2 begins to conduct.
This forces Q to also conduct because I will supply 2 Z2 I and when Q begins to conduct, I is reduced and the current output B2 2 B1 of the circuit is limited.
This circuit is achieved by R , R , D R limits 6 5 2.
6 the current through D and R decouples Q base from the Low 2 5 2 Impedance point at Q ’s emitter.
1 3 Thermal Shut down This form of protection which is mostly used in high power regulators due to possibility of damage due to self heating is implemented by sensing the elements junction temperature and reducing the power dissipation until the temperature drops to a tolerable level.
The circuit is shown below: 85CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Vi R3 + R4 Q 1 - R7 Q2 Q 3 R8 LOAD As temperature increases, the value of V reduces to a value set by R BE3 7 & R and Q starts conducting.The protection is achieved by using Q , 8 3 3 R and R .The basis for this operation is that V of a diode varies with 7 8 be temperature.
δV = -2mV/oC BE3 δT At 25oC, V ~ 700mV.
BE3 As temperature increases to 175oC, the value of V = 700mV – (175 – BE3 25)(2)= 400mV.
This value is provided by the R and R .When Q is switched on, it 7 8 3 reduces the I which in turn reduces the output current.
For fast B1 response, Q is usually glued to Q to provide excellent thermal 3 1 coupling.
The three forms of protection can be implemented in one circuit diagram as shown below 86CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Vi R6 5.1K R3 + R4 Q 1 - 510Ω 2.1K R7 Q2 R5 Q 3 2.5V R8 0.4K LOAD R2 10K R1 10K 3.5 Integration Circuit Regulators There are different types of IC voltage regulators.

Three Terminal Fixed Voltage Regulators These regulators come with 3 pins, one each for unregulated input, regulated output and ground.
They are produced to specific voltage values.
Examples of these include the LM 78XX series for positive voltage and the LM 79XX for the negative voltage.
The last two digits specify the output voltage of the chip.

Other examples are the LM 340 (Positive regulator) and the LM 320 negative regulator; etc.
2 Three Terminal Adjustable Regulators These types of regulators rely on external resistors to set the output voltage.
Products in this category include the LM 317 (Positive) and the LM 337 (negative) regulators.

Input IQ 50µA - OPamp + 500 1.25V IQ PRCOITRECCUTITION 0.2Ω Adj Output Once the circuit is powered, the error amp drives Vo to whatever value is needed to make Vn = Vp.
Therefore Vo = V + 1.25V ADJ The purpose of R1 and R2 is the setting of the value of Vo.
From a given formula (from data sheets) Vo = ( 1 + ) ( 1+ ) 1.25V Current through R is given to be 5mA.
1 Therefore, the equation above simplifies to Vo = ( 1 + ) 1.25 89CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS By varying R , Vo can be adjusted to any value in the range of 1.25 ≤ 2 Vo ≤ 35V.
The lower limits correspond to R = 0, (i.e.

91CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS UNIT 3 HEAT SINKS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Heat Sink 3.2 Thermal Resistance 3.3 Free Air Operation 3.4 Heat Sink Operation 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION A heat sink is a metallic material attached to an integrated circuit chip or a high power dissipating transistor.
Its aim is to increase the total surface area of the component thereby increasing the rate of heat dissipation of the component .Its purpose is to ultimately prolong the life of the component.
2.0OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, student should be able to: • identify heat sinks • analyze the Heat sink design • design heat sinks for amplifier circuits.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Heat Sinks The heat dissipated in Integrated circuits and other electronic circuits must be removed or the circuits will be damaged due to excessive temperature rise.
Devices based on P-N junction like transistors, diodes, Integrated circuits are the most affected as all the heat is produced at the P-N junction.
The power dissipated in the transistor increases its temperature above the ambient temperature.
If the device or junction temperature T becomes too high, the transistor may suffer permanent j damage.
92CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The maximum allowable chip temperature referred to as the maximum junction temperature is given in data sheets.
For silicon devices, this is usually in the range of 1500C TO 2000C.
To prevent excessive junction temperature build up, heat must be expelled from the silicon chip to the surrounding package structure and then to the ambient.
Heat transfer is directly proportional to surface area so the larger the surface area of the chip, the faster the heat transfer from the chip.
But design specifications place limits on the chip area, so an approach at increasing the surface area of chips is through the use of heat sinks.
A heat sink is a metal structure usually with fins that is bonded, clipped or clamped to the device package to facilitate heat flow from case to ambient.
3.2 Thermal Resistance As the chip’s temperature increase with respect to the ambient, at thermal equilibrium this increase is proportional to the internally dissipated power.
T – T ~ θ P .
J A JA D where T and T are junction and ambient temperatures respectively.
J A P is the dissipated power and D θ is the junction to ambient thermal resistance in oC/W.
JA The rate of loss of heat is proportional to the temperature difference between the junction and the ambient (case).
θ= The thermal resistance and maximum allowable junction temperature set an upper limit on the power dissipation capabilities of devices such as power amplifiers, voltage regulators e.t.c no heat sink is used, the device will be said to be operating in free air.
3.3 Free Air Operation In free air operation, the thermal resistance consists of two components, θ = θ + θ JA JC CA θ = thermal resistance from junction to case JC 93CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS θ = thermal resistance from core to ambient CA This can be illustrated in the diagram below: Tj θjc PD TC θCA TA The values for θ and θ are usually provided but θ must be JC JA CA calculated.
3.4Heat Sink Operation When a heat sink is used, the equation gets modified T – T = P θ J A D JA Where θ = (θ + θ + θ ) JA JC CS SA θ = thermal resistance between junction and case JC θ = thermal resistance between case and heat sink CS θ = thermal resistance between heat sink and ambient.
SA Therefore, T – T = P (θ + θ + θ ) J A D JC CS SA Where P = Power dissipated in the device.
D The presence of the heat sink alters the thermal resistance between case and ambient.
θ =θ + θ CA CS SA The Electrical diagram for this is shown below 94CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Tj θjc PD TC θCS Tsink θSA TA Example 1 Determine the maximum power dissipation in a MOSFET with the following parameters: θ = 1.75OC/ W , θ = 1OC/ W, θ = 5OC/ W, θ = 50OC/ W, T = JC CS SA CA A 30OC and T = 150OC.
jmax Without Heat Sink T – T = P (θ + θ ) J A D JC CA 150 – 30 = P (1.75 + 50) D Therefore, P = = 2.32W D With Heat Sink T – T = P (θ + θ + θ ) = 150-130=P (175+1+5) J A D JC CS SA D P = = = 15.5W D From the example, the heat sink allows power to be dissipated in the device while keeping the temperature below T J.
Example 2 A given transistor has θ = 200OC/ W, T = 30OC.
JA A Power dissipation of 100mW will give a T of P = 100mW = 0.1W j D Δ T = P θ = 200 * 0.1 = 20OC.
j D JA The new junction temperature T = T Δ T j A + j Therefore T = 30oC + 20oC = 50oC.
j 95CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The thermal contact between the case and the heat sink must be of low thermal resistance and a thermally conducting paste should be used to bond the heat sink to the case.
Heat sinks are made in many shapes and sizes.
They are often painted in black to aid radiative heat transfer.
Cooling fans are also used if the heat sink gets too hot, this is called forced convection.
Fans improve the dissipation of a heat sink by a factor of two or three and this leads to smaller heat sink design.
Aluminium due to its light weight and low resistivity is often used in heat sink construction.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you have been introduced to the basic principles of the Heat sinks, its applications and the design procedure.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have been able to extend knowledge of the theory and applications of the heat sink and have been able to derive the design procedure for each application of the heat sink.

It has one output and one or more inputs.
They are the fundamental blocks with which digital systems are built.
The output is a result of the implementation of the logical algebra known as the Boolean algebra.
16.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, student should be able to: • identify the different logic gates • analyze circuits with logic gates • generate other gates from the universal gates.
17.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Logic Gate One characteristic of this Boolean algebra is that the variables can only assume one of the two values 0 and 1.
Where 0 (zero) can represent off, low, minus or false depending on the convention used while 1 (one) takes the opposite state.
The gates are available in various IC families, popular among them are the transistor- transistor logic (TTL), emitter coupled logic (ECL), metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) and the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS).
Most of these 102CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS families have their unique characteristics and qualities for example, the TTL families consume considerable quiescent current while the CMOS which is factor than the TTL consumes zero quiescent current (though it is more delicate) among other properties.
We shall be considering the following gates and their truth table OR gate, AND gate, NOT gate, NOR and NAND gates.
Another gate we will look at is the exclusive OR gate.
The logic used to determine the state of the variables can either be positive or negative.
In the positive logic, where there are two voltage values, the more positive of the voltage represents the high while if we are operating on the negative logic, the more negative value would represent the high state.
3.2 OR Gate The OR gate is a gate which produces a high output of any or both (all) if its inputs are high.
It symbolizes logic addition.
A B C 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 Figure 2 input OR gate From the diagram (b) we see that so long as any of the switches is closed the bulb will light up.
The OR gate represents the Boolean equation; 103CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS NOTE: a truth table is a table which gives the output state for all the possible input combination.
This OR gate can also be known as an inclusive OR gate because it includes the case when both input are true.
Gates can have any number of inputs but standard packages contain four 2- input gates, three 3- input gates.
The OR gate can also be derived from discrete circuits.
e.g.
diodes and transistors.
3.3 AND Gate The AND gate is a logic gate which will give a high output if and only if all its inputs are high.
It symbolizes logical multiplication.
SYMBOL Figure 2 –input AND gate The AND gate works on the Boolean algebra From the diagram it can be seen that an AND gate can be represented by a series circuit.
For the lamp to come on, the switches A and B must be on.
Below are truth tables for two and three input AND gates.

C = output Three input AND gate.
D = output A B C A B C D 0 0 The AND gate can also be 0 0 0 0 0 realized using the diode and the 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 transistor.
0 1 0 0 1 0 0 3.6 The NOT Gate (Inverse) 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 The NOT gate is also known as an inverter because it inverts the input signal.
It has one input and one output terminal.
The logical symbol for negation or inversion is a bar over whose function is to indicate the opposite state.
The symbol of the NOT gate is shown below.
Truth table for the NOT gate A B 0 1 1 0 Figure NOT gate symbol NAND/NOR GATES The gates (AND/OR) discussed above can be combined with the NOT gate to produce other gates known as the NOR and the NAND gates.
This is achieved by inverting the inputs of the gates.
3.7 The NOR Gate The NOR gate is a combination of the NOT and the OR gate.
The NOT gate function is a reverse of the OR gate function so it will have an output of 1 only when all its inputs are 0.
The output of the NOR gate is fed to the input of the NOT gate to give NOR.
The NOR gate is also referred to as a universal gate because it can be used to simulate OR, AND and NOT gate functions.
The NOR gate 105CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS symbol is an OR gate symbol with a bubble at the output pin as shown below.
Figure 2-input NOR gate Truth table for the 2 input NOR gate A B C 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 OR GATE FUNCTION By placing another inverter at the output of the NOR gate the output is re-inverted giving an OR gate function.
OPERATION A + B = A+ B = C AND GATE FUNCTION In this case, two inverters are used in the input.
The inputs are inverted before going into the NOR gate and thus the output of the NOR gate is: 106CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS NOT GATE FUNCTION In this case the two inputs are tired together and the output is A + A which by demorgan is A. the OR and AND gates can also be derived from using purely NOR gates.
3.8 NAND Gate In this case the circuit of the AND gate is fed to the input of an inverter.
The gate gives an output of 1 if either A or B or both are 0.
The NAND gate is also a universal gate as it can be construed as shown to get either an AND gate or an OR gate operation.
The NAND gate symbol is an AND gate symbol with a bubble at the output pin as shown below.

Conversely, they output a low (0) logic level if the inputs are at the same logic levels.
The Exclusive-OR (sometimes called XOR) gate has both a symbol and a truth table pattern shown below: There are equivalent circuits for an Exclusive-OR gate made up of AND, OR, and NOT gates, just as there were for NAND and NOR gates.
A rather direct approach to simulating an Exclusive-OR gate is to start with a regular OR gate, then add additional gates to inhibit the output from going, high, (1) when both inputs are high.
(1): 3.10 XNOR Gate Exclusive-NOR gate, otherwise known as the XNOR is equivalent to an Exclusive-OR gate but it has an inverted output.
The truth table for this gate is exactly opposite as for the Exclusive-OR gate: Example 1 A digital signal 101011 is applied to a NOT gate what will be the NOT gate output.

110CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS UNIT 3 KARNAUGH MAP CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Introduction to Karnaugh Maps 3.2 Circuit Simplification Using Karnaugh Maps 3.3 Simplifying Logic Circuits Using Karnaugh Maps 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the design of logic functions by means of logic gates, more than one solution is usually available for the implementation of a given logic expression and some combinations of gates can implement a given function more efficiently than others.
The challenge in logic design is the assurance of having chosen the most efficient realization.
A very popular and easy to use procedure for simplifying logic design exists and it utilizes a map, describing all possible combinations of the variables present in the logic function of interest.
This map is called a Karnaugh map, after its inventor.
The karnaugh map consists of row and column assignments for two or more variables arranged so that all adjacent terms change by only one bit.
Each map consists of 2N cells, where N is the number of logic variables.
Karnaugh maps allow us to convert a truth table to a simplified Boolean expression without using Boolean Algebra.
4.0OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, student should be able to: • the understanding of the use of karnaugh maps in logic design • the understanding of the use of karnaugh maps in simplification of logic design • the understanding of conversion of truth tables to Boolean algebra • the generation of digital logic circuits from truth tables.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 111CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 3.1 Introduction to Karnaugh Maps Karnaugh maps are a graphical way of simplifying a Boolean expression and thus simplifying the resulting circuit.
A Karnaugh map is a completely mechanical method of performing this simplification, and so has an advantage over manipulation of expressions using Boolean algebra.
Karnaugh maps are effective for expressions of up to about six variables.
For more complex expressions the more advanced Quine- McKluskey method may be appropriate.
The Karnaugh map uses a rectangle divided into rows and columns in such a way that any product term in the expression to be simplified can be represented as the intersection of a row and a column.
The rows and columns are labeled with each term in the expression and its complement.
The labels must be arranged so that each horizontal or vertical move changes the state of one and only one variable.
The figure 9.1 below shows karnaugh map with 2,3and 4 variables Figure 9.1 Karnaugh maps with 2, 3, 4 variables 3.2 Circuit Simplification Using Karnaugh Maps 112CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The following steps are required to use a Karnaugh map to simplify an expression: 1.
Draw a “map” with one box for each possible product term in the expression.
The boxes must be arranged so that a one-box movement either horizontal or vertical changes one and only one variable.
See Figure 9.1.
2.
For each product term in the expression to be simplified, place a checkmark (or a 1) in the box whose labels are the product's variables and their complements.
3.
Draw loops around adjacent pairs of checkmarks.
Blocks are “adjacent” horizontally and vertically only, not diagonally.
A block may be “in” more than one loop, and a single loop may span multiple rows, multiple columns, or both, so long as the number of checkmarks enclosed is a power of two.
4.
For each loop, write an unduplicated list of the terms which appear; i.e.
no matter how many times A appears, write down only one A.
5.
If a term and its complement both appear in the list, e.g.
both A and A, delete both from the list.
6.
For each list, write the Boolean product of the remaining terms.
7.
Write the Boolean sum of the products from Step 5; this is the simplified expression.
Example 1 Simplify the Boolean expression below using karnaugh maps AB+ AB.
Solution This is an expression of two variables.
A rectangle is drawn and divided so that there is a row or column for each variable and its complement.
Next, we place checks in the boxes that represent each of the product terms of the expression.
Figure 9.2: Karnaugh map for example 1 The first product term is AB, so a check is placed in the upper left block of the diagram, the conjunction of A and B.
113CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS The second is AB , so we place a check in the lower left block.
Finally, we draw a loop around adjacent pairs of checks.
The loop contains A, B, A, and B.
We remove one A so that the list is unduplicated.
The B and B “cancel,” leaving only A, which is the expected result: AB+ AB = A.
Example 2 Simplify AB + AB + AB using K-Maps Solution There are two variables, so the K-Map is the same as in Example 1.
The solution will be derived using the following steps: Place a check in the AB area.
Place a check in the AB area.
Place a check in the AB area.
Draw loops around pairs of adjacent checks.
Figure 9.3: Karnaugh map for example 2 The Vertical loop contains A, B, A,B.
Since A is duplicated, one of it is removed.
B and its complementB both cancel out leaving only A.
From the horizontal loop we have A,B, A,B.The duplicate B is removed and the A cancels out with its complement.
The Boolean sum of the manipulation is now A+ B which is the answer.
3.3 Simplifying Logic Circuits Using Karnaugh Maps The major advantage of Karnaugh maps is its ability to simplify logic design by simplifying the Boolean expression and/or truth table and eliminating unnecessary logic gates in a digital logic design.
Example 3 Given the truth table for a 3 input logic design: 114CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS (1) Generate the Boolean equation and sketch the logic circuit required to implement the truth table (2) Simplify the logic design using K-maps and sketch the resultant logic circuit.
The output is the X column.
Table 9.2 Output of the 3 input logic circuit A B C X 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 Solution (1) From the truth table, the circuit generates an output when X = 1.The product of the terms at which X = 1 is taken out and summed together.
This sum is known as sum of products and it is the Boolean expression that generates the truth table.
Products terms are: ABC , ABC and ABC Sum of products = ABC + ABC + ABC The digital logic circuit based on the Boolean equation is given below.
Note, the inputs are A, B and C and the complements are ABC The complements are generated by the use of inverters or NOT gates.
ABC complements are fed into a 3 input AND gate while ABC is fed into another 3 input AND gate and ABC is fed into the third 3 input AND gate.
The inputs of the three 3-input AND gates are fed together into a 3-input OR gate.
The circuit diagram is shown below.
115CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Figure 9.4: Digital logic circuit for example 3 (2) The truth table generates an expression with three product terms.
A measure of the complexity of a digital logic circuit is the number of gate inputs.
The circuit in Figure 9.4 has 15 gate inputs.
The Karnaugh map for the sum of products expression is shown in Figure 9.5 below.
Figure 9.5 Karnaugh map for example 3 In this Karnaugh map, the large loop surrounds A B C and ABC.It “wraps around” from the left edge of the map to the right edge.
The A and A cancel, so these two terms simplify to BC.
ABC is in a cell all by itself, and so contributes all three of its terms to the final expression.
The simplified expression is B C + ABC and the simplified circuit is shown in Figure 9.6.
In the simplified circuit, one three-input AND gate was removed, a remaining AND gate was changed to two inputs, and the OR gate was changed to two inputs, resulting in a circuit with ten gate inputs.
Figure 9.6: Simplified Circuit in example 3 116CIT 236 ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you have been introduced to the use of the karnaugh map in simplification of digital logic circuits.
The following observations are to be noted in the generation of loops in the K-maps.
For maximum simplification, the loops are to be made as big as possible with big loops being the preferred size.
The restriction is that the loop must be rectangular and enclose a number of checkmarks that is a power of two.
When a map is more than two rows deep, i.e.
when it represents more than three variables, the top and bottom edges can be considered to be adjacent in the same way that the right and left edges are adjacent in the two-by-four maps above.
If all checkmarks in a loop are enclosed within other loops as well, that loop can be ignored because all its terms are accounted for.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have been able to extend knowledge of the theory and applications of the Karnaugh Maps.
