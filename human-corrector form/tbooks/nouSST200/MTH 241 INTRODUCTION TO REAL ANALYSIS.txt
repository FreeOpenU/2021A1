Unit 1.1 consists of a brief survey of set operations and functions, two vitaltools for all of mathematics.
In it we establish the notationand state the basic definitions and properties thatwill be used throughout the book.
We will regard the word "set" as synonymous with thewords "class", "collection", and "family", and we willnot define these terms or give a listof axioms for set theory.
This approach, often referred to as "naive" set theory, is quite adequate for working with sets in the context of real analysis.
Unit1.2 is concerned witha special method of proof calledMathematical Induction.
It is related to the fundamental properties of the natural number system and, though it is restricted to proving particular types of statements, it is important and used frequently.’ Aninformal discussion of the different types of proofs that are used in mathematics,such as contrapositives and proofs by contradiction, can be found in Appendix A.
In Unit 1.3 we apply some of thetools presented in the first two units of this unit to a discussion of what it means for a set to be finite or infinite.
Careful definitions are given and some basic consequences of these definitions are derived.
The important resultthattheset of rational numbers is countably infinite is established.
In additionto introducingbasicconceptsand establishingterminology and notation, thismodulealso provides the reader with some initialexperience in workingwithprecise definitions and writingproofs.
The careful studyof real analysisunavoidablyentailsthe readingand writing of proofs, and likeany skill, it is necessary to practice.Thismodule is a starting point.
Unit 1 Sets and Functions 1.0 INTRODUCTION To the reader: In thisunitwe give a brief reviewof the terminology and notation thatwillbe used in this text.We suggest thatyou look through quickly and come back laterwhen you need to recall the meaning of a term or a symbol.
If an element x is in a set A, we write x˛ A and say that x is a member of A, or thatx belongs to A.
If x is not in A, we write x∉A.
If every element of a set A also belongs to a set B, we say that A is a subset of B and write A ˝ B or B ˚ A We say that a set A is a proper subset of a set B if A ˝ B, but there is at least one element of B that is not in A.
In this case we sometimes write A (cid:204) B.
Introduction to Real Analysis 5 2.0 OBJECTIVES At theend of the Unit, readers should be able to (i) Understand the notation and state the basic definition and properties that will be used throughout the study.
(ii) Understand the background needed in Real Analysis (iii) Understand different axioms use in set theory.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 1.1.1 Definition Two sets A and B are saidto be equal, and we write A = B, if they containthesame elements.
Thus, to prove that the sets A and B are equal, we must show that A ˝ B and B ˝ A.
A set is normally denned by either listing its elements explicitly, or by specifying a property that determines the elements of the set.
If P denotes a property that is meaningful and unambiguous for elements of a set S, then we write (x ˛ S : P(x)} for theset of all elements x in S for which the property P is tine.
If the set S is understood from the context, thenit is often omitted in thisnotation.
Several specialsets are used throughout thisbook, and they are denoted by standard symbols.
(We willuse the symbol := to mean that the symbol on the left is being defined by the symbol on the right.)
• The set of natural numbers NNNN := {1, 2, 3, …………), • The set of integersZZZZ := {0, 1, -1, 2, -2,…), • The set of rational numbers QQQQ := (m/n : m, n˛ ˛˛˛ ZZZZand n „ 0), • The set of real numbersR.
The setR of real numbers is of fundamental importance for us and willbe discussed at length in Module 2.
1.1.2 Examples (a) The set {x ˛ N : .x2– 3x + 2 = 0} consists of those natural numbers satisfying the stated equation.
Since the only solutions of this quadratic equation are x = 1 and x = 2, we can denote this set more simply by {1, 2}.
(b) A natural number n is even if it has the form n = 2k for some k ˛ N. The set of even natural numbers can be written {2k: k˛ N).
which is less cumbersome than {n ˛ N : n = 2k, k ˛ N}.
Similarly, the set of odd natural numbers can be written {2k - 1 : k ˛ N).
□ Set Operations We now define the methods of obtaining new sets from given ones.
Note that these set operations are based on the meaning of the words "or", "and", and "not".
For the union, it is important to be aware of the fact that the word "or" is used in the inclusive sense, allowing the possibilitythat x may belong to both sets.
In legal terminology, this inclusive sense is sometimes indicatedby "and/or".
1.1.3 Definition (a) The union of sets A and B is the set Introduction to Real Analysis 6 A ¨ B : = {x : x ˛ A or x ˛ B}.
(b) The intersection of the sets A and B is the set A ˙ B := {x : x˛ A and x˛ B} (c) The complement of B relative to A is the set A\B := {x : x˛ A and xˇ B} Figure 1.1.1 (a) A ¨ B (b) A˙ B (c) A\B The set that has no elements is called the empty set and is denoted by the symbol .
Two ∅ sets A and B are said to be disjoint if they have no elements in common; this can be expressed by writing A˙ B = ˘ To illustrate the method of proving set equalities, we will next establish one of the DeMorgan laws for three sets.
The proof of the other one is left as an exercise.
1.1.4 Theorem If A, B, C are sets, then (a) A\ (B ¨ C) = (A\ B) ˙ (A\C), (b) A\ (B ˙ C) = (A\ B) ¨ (A\C).
Proof: To prove (a), we will show that every element in A\ (B ¨ C) is contained in both (A\B) and (A\C), and conversely.
If x is in A\(B ¨ C), thenx is in A, but x is not in B ¨ C. Hence x is in A, but x is neither in B nor in C. Therefore, x is in A but not B, and x is in A but not C. Thus, x˛ A\B and x ˛ A\C, which shows that x ˛ (A\B)˙ (A\C).
Conversely, if x ˛ (A\B)˙ (A\C), then x ˛ (A\B) and x ˛ (A\C).
Hence x ˛ A and both x ˇ B and x ˇ C. Therefore, x ˛ A and x ˇ B¨ C), so that x˛ (A\ (B¨ C).
Since the sets (A\B) ˙ (A\C) and A\(B ¨ C) contain the same elements, they are equal by Definition 1.1.1.
Q.E.D There are times when it is desirable to form unions and intersections of more than two sets.
For a finite collection of sets {A , A ,…, A }, their unions is the set A consisting of all elements that 1 2 n belong to at least one of the sets A, and their intersection consists of all elements that belong to all k of the sets A. k This is extended to an infinite collection of sets {A , A ,…, A …} as follows.
Their union 1 2 n, is the set of elements that belong to at least one of the sets A In this case we write n. (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) A := { x : x ˛ A for some n˛ N}.
n n Introduction to Real Analysis 7 Similarly, their intersection is the set of elements that belong to all of these sets A .
In this case we n write (cid:2) (cid:7) A n := { x : x ˛ Anfor alln˛ N}.
(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) Cartesian Products In order to discuss functions, we define the Cartesian product of two sets.
1.1.5 Definition If A and B are nonempty sets, then the Cartesian product A x B of A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) with a A and b B.
That is, A x B : = {(a, b) : a A, b B}.
Thus if A = {1, 2, 3} and B = (1,5), then the set A x B is the set whose elements are the ordered pairs.
(1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5).
We may visualize the set A x B as the set of six points in the plane with the coordinates that we have just listed.
We often draw a diagram (such as Figure 1.1.2) to indicate the Cartesian product of two sets A and B.
However, it should be realized that this diagram may be a simplification.
For example, if A := {x R : 1 £ x £ 2} and B := { y R : 0£ y £1 or 2 £ y £ 3}, then instead of a rectangle, we should have a drawing such as Figure 1.1.3.
We will now discuss the fundamental notion of a function or a mapping.
To the mathematician of the early nineteenth century, the word “function” meant a definite formula, such as f(x) := x2+ 3x – 5, which associates to each real number x another number f(x).
(Here, f (0) = -5, f (1) = -1, f (5) = 35).
This understanding excluded the case of different formulas on different intervals, so that functions could not be defined “in pieces”.
A x B 3 B b (a, b) 2 A x B 1 a 1 2 A Figure 1.1.2 Figure 1.1.3 As mathematics developed, it became clear that a more general definition of "function" would be useful.
It also became evident that it is important to make a clear distinction between the function itselfand the values of the function.
A reviseddefinition might be: A function f from a set A intoa set B is a rule of correspondence that assigns to each element x in A a uniquely determined element f (x )in B.

The notation ƒ :: AAﬁ B is often used to indicate that ƒ iiss aa ffuunnccttiioonn ffrroomm AA intoB.
We willalso say that ƒ iiss aa mappingof A intoB, or that ƒmmaappss AintoB.

FFiigguurree 11..11..44 A function as a graph Introduction to Real Analysis 9 If b = ƒ (a), we often refer to b as the valueof ƒ at a, or as the image of a under ƒ. Transformations and Machines Aside from using graphs, we can visualize a function as a transformation of the set D(ƒ) = A into the set R (ƒ) ˝ B.
In this phraseology, when (a, b) ƒ˛ , we think of ƒ as taking the element a from A and "transforming" or "mapping" it into an element b = f(a) in R(ƒ) ˝ B.
We often draw a diagram, such as Figure 1.1.5, even when the sets A and B are not subsets of the plane.
f b = f(a) Figure 1.1.5 A function as a transformation There is another way of visualizing a function: namely, as a machine that accepts elements of D ( f ) — A as inputs and produces corresponding elements of R(f) C B as outputs.
If we take an element* € D(f) and put it into /.thenoutcomes the corresponding value /(x).If we put a different element y e D(f) into /, then outcomes /(v)which may or may not differ from f(x).
If we try to insert something that does not belong to D(f) into/, we find that it is not accepted, for / can operate only on elements from D(/).
(See Figure 1.1.6.)
This last visualization makes clear the distinction between / and f(x): the first is the machine itself,and the second is the output of the machine / when x is the input.
Whereas no one is likely to confuse a meat grinder with ground meat, enough people have confused functions with their values that it is worth distinguishing between them notationally.
Figure 1.1.6 A function as a machine Introduction to Real Analysis 10 Direct and Inverse Images Let f : A ﬁ B be a function with domain D(f) = A and range R(f)˝ B.
1.1.7 Definition If E is a subset of A, then the direct image of E under f is the subset f(E) of B given by f(E) := {f(x) : x ˛ E}.
If H is a subset of B, then the inverse image of H under f is the subset f-1 (H) of A given by f-1(H) := {x ˛ A : f(x) ˛ H}.
Remark The notation f-l (H) used in this connection has its disadvantages.
However, we will use it since it is the standard notation.
Thus, if we are given a set E ˝ A, then a point y ˛ B is in the direct image f(E) 1 if and only if there exists at least one point x ˛ E such that y =f (x ).
Similarly, given 1 1 1 a set H ˝ B, then a point x is in the inverse image f-l (H) if and only if y := f (x ) 2 2 2 belongs to H. (See Figure 1.1.7.)
1.1.8 Examples (a) Let f : Rﬁ R be defined by f(x) := x2.
Then the direct image of the set E := {x : 0 £ x £ 2} is the set f(E) = {y : 0 £ y £ 4}.
If G := {y : 0 £ y £ 4}, then the inverse image of G is the set f-l(G) = {x : -2 £ x £ 2}.
Thus, in this case, we see that f-l(f(E)) „ E. On the other hand, we have f (f-l(G))= G. But if H := {y : -1 £ y £ : 1}, thenwe have f (f- l (H))= {y: 0£ y£ 1} „ H. A sketchof the graphof f mayhelp to visualizethese sets.
(b) Let f : Aﬁ B, and let G, H be subsetsof B. Wewill show that ƒ-l(G ˙ H) ƒ˝ -l(G) ƒ˙ -l(H).
For, if x ƒ˛ -l(G ˙ H), then f(x) ˛ G ˙ H, so that f(x) ˛ G and f(x) ˛ H. But this implies that x E ƒ-l(G) and x ƒ˛ -l(H),whencex ƒ˛ -l(G)˙ ƒ-l(H).Thusthestated implication is proved.
[The opposite inclusion is also true, so that we actually have set equality between these sets; see Exercise 13.]
Further facts about direct and inverse images are given in the exercises.

Toshow that .f isinjective,wetakex1andx2in Aandassume that f(x =f(x ).Thuswe have 1) 2 2x = 2x 1 2 x – 1 x - 1 1 2 which implies that x(x - 1) = x (x- 1), and hence x = x .
Therefore ƒis injective.
l 2 2 l l 2 To determine the range of ƒ, we solve the equation y =2x/(x - 1) for x in terms 0: y.
We obtain x =y/(y- 2), which is meaningful for y„2.
Thus the range of ƒis the se B := {y ˛ R: y„2}.
Thus, ƒis a bijection of A onto B.

We can also express the connection between f and its inverse f-1 by noting that D(f) = R(f-1) and R(f) = D(f-1) and that b = f(a) if and only if a = f -1(b) For example, we saw in Example 1.1.10 that the function 2x f(x) := x - 1 is a bijection of A := {x ˛ R : x 1} onto the set B := { y ˛ R : y 2}.
The function inverse to f ≠ ≠ is given by y f -1 (y) := for y ˛ B. y - 2 Remark We introduced the notation f -1(H) in Definition 1.1.7.
It makes sense even if f does not have an inverse function.
However, if the inverse function f -1 does exist, then f -1(H) is the direct image of the set H ˝ B under f -1 Composition of Functions It often happens that we want to “compose” two functions f, g by first finding f(x) and then applying g to get g(f(x)); however, this is possible only when f(x) belongs to the domain of g, In order to be able to do this for all f(x), we must assume that the range of f is contained in the domain of g. (See Figure 1.1.8).
1.1.12 Definition If f : A B and g : B C, and if R(f) ˝ D(g) = B, then the composite → → function g o f (note the order!)
is the function from A into C defined by (g o f)(x) := g(f(x)) for all x ˛ A.
1.1.13 Examples (a) The order of the composition must be carefully noted.
For, let f and g be the functions whose values at x ˛ R are given by f(x) := 2x and g(x) := 3x2– 1.
Since D(g) = R and R(f) ˝ R = D(g), then the domain D(g o f) is also equal to R , and the composite function g o f is given by (g o f)(x) = 3(2x)2 – 1 = 12x2-1.
Introduction to Real Analysis 13 Figure 1.1.8 The composition of f and g On the other hand, the domain of the composite function f o g is, also R, but (ƒo g)(x) =2(3x2- 1) =6x2- 2.
Thus, in thiscase, we have g o f „ f o g. (b) In considering g o ƒ , some care must be exercised to be sure that the range of ƒ is contained in the domain of g. For example, if f(x) :=1 –x2 and g(x):= √(cid:13) then, since D(g) = {x : x 0), the composite function g o ƒ is given by the formula (g o ƒ) (x) =√(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:15) only for x ˛ D(f) that satisfy f(x) 0; that is, for x satisfying -1 x 1.
(cid:16) (cid:16) We note that if we reverse the order, then the composition ƒ o g is given by the formula (ƒog)(x) = 1 - x, but only for those x in the domain D(g) = {x : x 0}.
We now give the relationship between composite functions and inverse images.
The proof is left as an instructive exercise.
1.1.14 Theorem Let ƒ : A ﬁ B andg : B ﬁ C be functions and JetH be a subset of C .
Then we have (g o f )-1 (H) = ƒ-1(g-1(H)) Note the reversal in the order of the functions.
5.0 SUMMARY Restrictions of Functions If ƒ : Aﬁ B is a function and if A A , we can define a function ƒ , : A ﬁ B by 1 1 1 ƒ (x) : = ƒ(x) for x˛ A 1 1 Introduction to Real Analysis 14 The function ƒ is called the restriction of ƒto A Sometimes it is denoted byƒ =ƒ /A 1 1.
1 1 It may seem strange to the reader that one would ever choose to throw away a part of a function, but there are some good reasons for doing so.
For example, if ƒ : Rﬁ R is the squaring function: ƒ(x) :=x2 for x˛ R then ƒ is not injective, so it cannot have an inverse function.
However, if we restrict ƒ to thesetA ,:= (x : x 0), then the restriction ƒ|A is a bijection of A onto A .Therefore, this 1 ≥ 1 1 1 restriction has an inverse function, which is the positive square root function.
(Sketch a graph.)
Similarly, the trigonometric functions S(x) := sin xand C(x) : = cos xare not injective on all of R. However, by making suitable restrictions of these functions, one can obtain the inverse sineand the inverse cosinefunctions that the reader has undoubtedly already encountered.

Introduction to Real Analysis 16 Unit 2 Mathematical Induction 1.0 INTRODUCTION Mathematical Induction is a powerful method of proof that is frequently used to establish thevalidityof statements that are given in terms of the natural numbers.
Although its utility is restricted to this rather special context, Mathematical Induction is an indispensable tool in all branches of mathematics.
Since many inductionproofs follow the same formal lines of argument, we will often state only that a result follows from Mathematical Induction and leave it to the reader to provide the necessary details.
In this section, we will state the principle and give several examples to illustratehow inductive proofs proceed.
We shallassume familiarity withthe set of natural numbers: N := {1,2,3, }.
⋯ withthe usual arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication, and with the meaning of a natural number being less than another one.
We will also assume thefollowing fundamental property of N. 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, readers should be able to (i) understand special method of proof called “Mathematical Induction” (ii) understand that the course is related to the fundamental properties of the natural number system (iii) Understand different types of proof that are used in mathematics such as contrapositives and proof by contradiction.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 1.2.1 Well-Ordering Property of NNNN Every nonempty subset of Nhas a least element.
A more detailedstatement of thisproperty is as follows: If S is a subset of N and if S „0, then there exists m ˛ S such that m £ k for all k˛ .
S. On the basis of the Well-Ordering Property, we shall derive a version of the Principle of Mathematical Induction that is expressed in terms of subsets of N. 1.2.2 Principle of Mathematical Induction Let S be a subset of Nthat possesses the two properties: (1) The number 1˛ S. (2) For every k ˛ N, if k ˛ S, then k + 1 ˛ S. Then we have S =N.
Proof.
Suppose to the contrary that S „N.
Then the set N\ S is not empty, so by the Well- Ordering Principle it has a least element m. Since 1 ˛ S by hypothesis (1), we know that m > 1.
But this implies that m >1 is also a natural number.
Since m -1 <m and since m is the least element in N such that m ˇ S, we conclude that m - 1 ˛ S. We now apply hypothesis (2) to the element k := m - 1in S, to infer that k + 1 = (m -1) + 1 = m belongs to S. But this statement contradicts the fact that m ˇ S. Since mwas obtained from the assumption that S\ Nis not empty, we have obtained a contradiction.
Introduction to Real Analysis 17 Therefore we must have S = N. Q.E.D.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction is often set forth in the framework of proper- ties or statements about natural numbers.
If P(n)is a meaningful statement about n ˛ N, thenP(n)may be true for some values of n and false for others.
For example, if P (n)is 1 the statement: “n2= n”then P1(1)is true while P (n) is false for all n >1, n ˛ N,.
On the 1 otherhand, if P (n)is thestatement: “n2>1", then P (l)is false, while P (n) is true for 2 2 2 alln>1, n ˛ N. In this context, the Principle of Mathematical Induction can be formulated as follows.
For each n ˛ N,, let P(n)be a statement about n. Suppose that: (1) P(l)is true, (2) For every k˛ N, if P(k}is true, then P(k+ 1) is true.
Then P(n)is true for alln ˛ N. The connection with the preceding version of Mathematical Induction, given in 1.2.2, is made by lettingS := (n ˛ N: P(n)is true).
Then the conditions (1) and (2) of 1.2.2 correspond exactlyto the conditions (1') and (2'), respectively.
The conclusion that S =Nin 1.2.2corresponds to theconclusionthat P(n)is true for all n ˛ N. In (2')the assumption "ifP(k)is true1' is calledthe induction hypothesis.
In establishing(2'),we are not concerned withthe actual truth or falsityof P(k'), but only with thevalidityof theimplication"ifP(k),then P(k+ 1)".For example, if we consider the statements P(n): "n = n + 5", then (2') is logically correct, for we can simply add 1 to bothsidesof P(k)to obtainP(k+ 1).However, since thestatement P(l):"1 — 6" is false, we cannot useMathematical Inductionto concludethatn = n + 5 for alln ˛ N. It may happen thatstatementsP(n)are false for certainnaturalnumbers but then are true for alln n for some particular n .The Principleof Mathematical Inductioncanbe modified to deal ≥ o 0 withthissituation.We willformulate the modified principle,but leave its verificationas an exercise.
(See Exercise 12.)
1.2.3 Principleof Mathematical Induction(second version) Letn ˛ Nand let P(n) 0 be a statement for each natural number n n .Suppose that: ≥ 0 (1) The statement P(n )is true.
0 (2) For all k n ,the truth of P(k)implies the truth of P(k+ I).
≥ 0 ThenP(n)is true for all n n 0 Sometimes the number nin (1)is calledthe base, since it serves as the starting point, and 0 the implicationin (2),which canbe written P(k)⇒P(k+1), is calledthe bridge, sinceit connects the case k to thecase k + 1.
The following examples illustratehow Mathematical Inductionis usedto prove assertionsabout natural numbers.
1.2.4 Examples (a)For each n ˛ N, the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by 1 +2 + + n= ½ (n + 1).
n To prove thisformula, we let S be the set of all n ˛ N for which the formula is true.
We must verify that conditions (1) and (2) of 1.2.2 are satisfied.
If n =1, then we have 1 =1 .1 .
(1 /2 + 1) so that 1 ˛ S, and (1) is satisfied.
Next, we assume that k ˛ S and wishto infer from thisassumption that k + 1 ˛ S. Indeed, if k ˛ S, then 1 + 2 + + k = ½k (k + 1).
⋯ Introduction to Real Analysis 18 If we add k + 1 to both sides of the assumed equality,we obtain 1 + 2 + + k + (k + 1) = ½k(k + 1)+ (k + 1) ⋯ = ½(k + 1)(k + 2).
Since this is the stated formula for n = k + 1, we conclude that k + 1 S. Therefore, condition (cid:23) (2) of 1.2.2 is satisfied.
Consequently, by thePrinciple of Mathematical Induction, we infer that S = N, so the formula holds for all n N. (cid:23) (b) For each n N, the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is givenby (cid:23) l2 + 22 + +n2 = 1/ n(n + 1)(2n + 1).
⋯ 6 To establish this formula, we note that it is true for n = 1, since 12 = 1/ 1.
2.
3.
If we 6 assume it is true for k, then adding (k+1)2to both sides of the assumed formula gives 12 + 22 + +k2 + (k + I)2 = 1/ k(k + l)(2k + 1) + (k + I)2 ⋯ 6 = 1/ (k+ 1)(2k2 + k + 6k + 6) 6 = 1/ (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3).
6 Consequently, the formula is valid for all n N. (cid:23) (c) Given two real numbers a and b, we will prove that a — b is a factor of a" — b" for all n N. (cid:23) First we see that the statement is clearly true for n = 1.
If we now assume that a - b is a factor of ak – bk, then ak+1 –bk+1 = ak+1– abk + abk – bk+1 = a(ak-bk) + bk (a-b).
By the inductionhypothesis, a — b is a factor ofa(ak- bk)and it is plainlya factor of bk(a- b).Therefore, a — b is a factor of ak+1- bk+l, and it follows from Mathematical Induction that a — b is a factor of an — bnfor alln N. (cid:23) A variety of divisibility results can be derived from this fact.
For example, since 11- 7 = 4, we see that 11n–7nis divisible by 4 for all n N. (cid:23) (d) The inequality 2 n>2k + 1 is false for n = 1, 2, but it is true for n = 3.
If we assume that 2k>2k + 1, then multiplication by 2 gives, when 2k + 2 > 3, the inequality 2k+1>2(2k + 1) = 4k + 2 = 2k + (2k + 2) > 2k + 3 = 2(k + 1) + 1.
Since 2k + 2 > 3 for all k ≥1, the bridge is validfor all k ≥ 1 (even though the statement is false for k = 1,2).Hence, with the base n = 3, we can apply Mathematical Induction to conclude 0 that the inequality holds for alln≥ 3.
(e) The inequality 2n≤(n + 1)!
can be established by Mathematical Induction.
We first observe that it is true for n =1, since 21=2 = 1 + 1.If we assume that 2k≤(k + 1)!, it follows from the fact that 2 ≤k + 2 that 2k+l = 2-2k 2(k+ 1)!≤ (k + 2)(k+ 1)!
= (k+ 2)!.
(cid:16) Introduction to Real Analysis 19 Thus, if the inequality holds for k, then it also holds for k + 1.
Therefore, Mathematical Induction implies that the inequality is true for all n N. (cid:23) (f) If r R, r 1, and n N., then (cid:23) ≠ (cid:23) 1 + r + r2 + + rn= 1-rn+1 ⋯ 1 – r This is the formula for the sum of the terms in a "geometric progression".
It can be established using Mathematical Induction as follows.
First, if n =1, then 1 + r = (1 - r2)/(l - r).If we assume the truth of the formula for n = k and add the term rk+1 to both sides, we get (after a littlealgebra) 1 + r + rk + + rk+1 = 1 – rk+1 + rk+1= 1-rk+2 ⋯ 1 – r 1 - r which is the formula for n = k + 1 .
Therefore, Mathematical Inductionimplies the validity of the formula for all n N. (cid:23) [This result can also be proved without using Mathematical Induction.
If we let S : = 1 + r + r2 + + rn, thenrs = r + r2 + + rn+ 1, so that n ⋯ n ⋯ (I – r) s = s - rs = 1 – rn+1 n n n If we divide by 1 — r. we obtain the statedformula.]
(g) Careless use of the Principle of Mathematical Inductioncanlead to obviously absurd conclusions.The reader is invited to find the error in the "proof of the following assertion.
4.0 CONCLUSION Claim: If n Nand if the maximum of thenatural numbers p and q is n, then p = q.
(cid:23) “Proof."
Let S be the subsetof N for which the claimis true.
Evidently, 1 S since if p, (cid:23) q N and their maximum is 1 , then both equal 1 and so p = q, Now assume that k e S and (cid:23) thatthemaximum of p and q is k +1.
Then the maximum of p — 1 and q - 1 is k. But sincek S, (cid:23) thenp – 1 = q - 1 and therefore p = q.
Thus, k + 1 S, and we conclude thattheassertionis (cid:23) true for alln N. (cid:23) (h) There are statementsthatare true for many natural numbers but that are not truefor allof them.
For example, the formula p(n):= n2 - n +41givesa prime number for n = 1, 2, 40.
⋯ However, p(41)is obviously divisible by 41, so it is not a prime number.
5.0 SUMMARY Another version of the Principle of Mathematical Inductionis sometimes quite useful.
It is calledthe" Principleof Strong Induction", even though it is in fact equivalent to 1,2.2.
1.2.5 Principle of Strong Induction Let S be a subset ofN such that (1") 1 S (cid:23) (2") For every k N, if { 1 , 2, , k} S, then k + 1 S. (cid:23) ⋯ ⊆ (cid:23) Introduction to Real Analysis 20 Then S = N. We will leave it to the reader to establish the equivalence of 1.2.2 and 1 .2.5.

From a mathematical perspective, what we are doing is defining a bijective mapping between sheset and a portion of the set of natural numbers.
If the set is such that the counting does not terminate, such as the set of natural numbers itself, then we describe the set as being infinite.
The notions of "finite" and "infinite" are extremely primitive, and it is very likely that the reader has never examined these notions very carefully.
In this section we will define these terms precisely and establish a few basic results and state some other important results that seem obvious but whose proofs are a bittricky.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the Unit, readers should be able to: (i) Understand the differences ans similarities of a finite and infinite set (ii) Understand carefully some definitions and some basic consequences of these definition and their desired (iii) Understand that the set of rational numbers is countably infinite.
It is established.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 1.3.1 Definition (a) The empty set 0 is said to have 0 elements.
(b) If n ˛ N, a set S is said to have n elements if there exists a bijection from the set N := [1,2, , n)onto 5. n ⋯ (c) A set S is said to be finite if it is either empty or it has n elements for some n ˛ N (d) A set 5 is said to be infinite if it is not finite.
Since the inverse of a bijection is a bijection, it is easy to see that a set S has n elements if and only if there is a bijection from S onto the set {1,2, n}.Also, since the ⋯ composition of two bijections is a bijection, we see that a set S , has n elements if and only 1 if there is a bijectionfrom S onto another set S that has n elements.
Further, a set T , is finite 1 2 1 if and only if there is a bijection from T , onto another set T , that is finite.
1 2 It is now necessary to establish some basic properties of finite sets to be sure that the definitionsdo not lead to conclusionsthat conflict withour experience of counting.
From the definitions, it is not entirelyclear that a finite set might not have n elements for more than one value of n. Also it is conceivably possiblethat the set N := {1, 2, 3, might be a finite set ⋯ according to this definition.
The reader will be relieved that these possibilities do not occur, as the next two theorems state.
The proofs of these assertions, which use the fundamental properties of N described in Unit 1.2, are given in Appendix B.
Introduction to Real Analysis 22 1.3.2 Uniqueness Theorem If S is a finite set, then the number of elements in S is a. uniquenumber in N. 1.3.3 Theorem The setN of natural numbers is an infinite set.
The next result gives some elementary properties of finite and infinite sets.
1.3.4 Theorem (a) If A is a set with m elements and B is a set with n elements and if A ∩B = , then A ¨ B has m + n elements.
∅ (b) If A is a set with m˛ Nelements and C ˝ A is a set with 1 element, then A\C is a setwith m — 1 elements.
(c) If C is an infinite set and B is a finite set, then C\Bis an infinite set.
Proof.
(a) Let ƒ be a bijection of N onto A, and let g be a bijection of N onto B.
We m n define h on N by h(i) :=ƒ(i) for I =1, , m and h(i) :=g(i-m} for i = m + 1, , m+n ⋯ ⋯ m + n. We leave it as an exercise to show thath is a bijection from N onto A B. m+n ∪ The proofs of parts (b) and (c) are left to the reader, see Exercise 2.
Q.E.D.
It may seem "obvious" that a subset of a finite set is also finite, but the assertion must be deduced from the definitions.
This and the corresponding statement for infinite sets are established next.
1.3.5 Theorem Suppose that S and T are sets andthat T ⊆S.
(a) If Sis a finite set, then T is a finite set.
(b) IfT is an infinite set, then S is an infinite set.
Proof.
(a) If T = , we already know that T is a finite set.
Thus we may suppose that T .
∅ ≠ ∅ The proof is by induction on the number of elements in S. If S has 1 element, then the only nonempty subset T of S must coincide withS, so T is a finite set.
Suppose that every nonempty subset of a set with k elements is finite.
Now let S be a set having k + 1 elements (so there exists a bijection ƒ of N onto S), and let T ˝ S. If f(k + 1) ˛ T, k+1 we can consider T to be a subset of S := S\{f(k + 1)}, which has k elements by Theorem 1 1.3.4(b).
Hence, by the induction hypothesis, T is a finite set.
On the other hand, if f ( k + 1)˛ T, then T := T\{f(k+ 1)} is a subset of S .
Since S has k 1 1 1 elements, the induction hypothesis implies that T is a finite set.
But this implies that T = 1 T { f ( k + 1)} is also a finite set.
1∪ (b) This assertion is the contrapositive of the assertion in (a).
(See Appendix A for adiscussion of the contrapositive.)
Q.E.D.
Countable Sets We now introduce an important type of infinite set.
1.3.6 Definition (a) A set S is said to be denumerable (or countably infinite) if there exists a bijection of NontoS.
(b) A set S is said to be countable if it is either finite or denumerable.
(c) A set S is said to be uncountable if it is not countable.
Introduction to Real Analysis 23 From the properties of bijections, it is clear that S is denumerable if and only if there exists a bijection of S onto N. Also a set S is denumerable if and only if there exists a 1 bijection from S onto a set S that is denumerable.
Further, a set T is countable if and only if 1 2 1 there exists a bijection from T onto a set T that is countable.
Finally, an infinite countable 1 2 set is denumerable.
1.3.7Examples (a) The set E:= [2n : n N} of even natural numbers is (cid:28) denumerable,since the mapping ƒ : Nﬁ E defined by ƒ(n) := 2n for n N, is a bijection of N (cid:28) onto E. Similarly, the set 0 :={2n — 1 :n N} of odd natural numbers is denumerable.
(cid:28) (b) The set Z of all integers is denumerable.
To construct a bijection of N onto Z , we map 1 onto 0, we map the set of even natural 1 numbers onto the set N of positive integers, and we map the set of odd natural numbers onto the negative integers.
This mapping can be displayed by the enumeration: N = (0, 1, -1,2.-2,3, -3, }.
⋯ (c) The union of two disjoint denumerable sets is denumerable.
Indeed, if A ={a ,a , a , and B = {b, b, b, }, we can enumerate the elements of 1 2 3 ⋯ 1 2 3 ⋯ A B as: ∪ a ,b a ,b a , b , 1 1, 2 2, 3 3⋯ 1.3.8 Theorem The set N x N is denumerable.
Informal Proof.
Recall that N x Nconsists of all ordered pairs (m, n),where m,n N. (cid:28) We can enumerate these pairs as: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3, 1), (1,4), , ⋯ according to increasing sum m + n, and increasing m. (See Figure 1.3.1.)
Q.E.D.
The enumeration just described is an instance of a "diagonal procedure", since we move along diagonals that each contain finitely many terms as illustratedin Figure i.3.1.
While this argument is satisfying in that it shows exactly what the bijection of N x Nﬁ Nshould do, it is not a "formal proof, since it doesn't define this bijection precisely.
(See Appendix B for a more formal proof.)
As we have remarked, the construction of an explicit bijection between sets is often complicated.
The next two results are useful in establishing the countability of sets, since they do not involve showing that certain mappings are bijections.
The first result may seem intuitively clear, but its proof is rather technical; it will be given in Appendix B.
Introduction to Real Analysis 24 1.3.9 Theorem Suppose that Sand T are sets and that T ⊆S.
(a) If S is a countable, set.
then T is a countable set.
(b) If T is an uncountable set, then S is an uncountable set.
1.3.10 Theorem The following statements are equivalent: (a) Sis a countable set.
(b) There exists a surjection of N onto S. (c) There exists an injection of S intoN.
Proof.
(a)⇒(b)If S is finite, there exists a bijection h of some set N onto S and we define H on N n by {h(k) for k = 1, , n, H(k) := ⋯ {h(n) for k > n. Then H is a surjection of NontoS.
If S is denumerable, there exists a bijection H of N onto S, which is also a surjection of NontoS (b)⇒ (c) If H is a surjectionof NontoS, we define H : S⇒N by letting/H (S) be the least 1 1 element in the set H-1(s):= {n˛ N : H(n] = s}.
To see that H is an injection of SintoN,note that 1 if s,t˛ S and n := H (s)= H (t), then s = H(n )= t. st 1 1 st (c) ⇒ (a) If H is an injection of S into N, then it is a bijection of S onto H (S) ˝ N. 1 l By Theorem 1.3.9(a), Hl(S)is countable, whence the set S is countable.
Q.E.D.
1.3.11 Theorem The set Q of all rational numbers is denumerable.
Proof.
The idea of the proof is to observe that the set Q+ of positiverational numbers iscontained in the enumeration: 1/ , ½, 2/ , 1/ , 2/ , 3/ , ¼, , 1 1 3 2 1 ⋯ which is another "diagonal mapping" (see Figure 1.3.2).
However, this mapping is not an injection, since the different fractions 1/ and 2/ represent the same rational number.
2 4 To proceed more formally, note that sinceNx Nis countable (by Theorem 1.3.8), it follows from Theorem 1.3.10(b) that there exists a surjection / of Nonto N x N. If Introduction to Real Analysis 25 Figure 1.3.2The setQ+ g : N x Nﬁ Q+ is the mapping that sends the ordered pair (m, n) intothe rational number having a representation m/n thengis a surjection onto Q+.
Therefore, the compositiong o f is a surjection 1 of N onto Q+, and Theorem 1.3.10 implies that Q+ is a countable set.
Similarly, the set Q-of all negative rational numbers is countable.
It follows as inExample 1.3.7(b)that the set Q = Q-¨ {0} Q+ is countable.
Since Q contains N, itmust be a ∪ denumerable set.
Q.E.D.
The next result is concerned with unions of sets, In view of Theorem 1.3.10, we need not be womed about possible overlapping of the sets.
Also, we do not have to construct a bijection.
1.3.12 Theorem If A is a countable set for each m ˛ N, then the union A := (cid:2) A m (cid:29) m (cid:30)(cid:4)(cid:5) is countable.
Proof.
For each m˛ N, let be a surjection of N onto A .
We define ψ : N x Nﬁ A (cid:31)m m( by y (m, n) : = j (n).
m We claim that ^ is a surjection.
Indeed, if a ˛ A, then there exists a least m˛ N such that a ˛ A , whence there exists a least n ˛ N such that a = j (n).Therefore, a = y (m, n).
m m Since N x N is countable, it follows from Theorem 1.3.
10 that there exists a surjection ƒ : Nﬁ Nx Nwhence y o ƒis a surjection of N onto A.
Now apply Theorem 1.3.10again to conclude that A is countable.

4.0 CONCLUSION Remark A less formal (but more intuitive) way to see the truth of Theorem 1.3.12 is to enumerate the elements of A ,m˛ N, as: m A = {a , a , a , }, 1 11 12 13⋯ A = {a , a , a , }, 2 21 22 23⋯ A = {a , a , a , }.
3 31 32 33⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ We then enumerate this array using the "diagonal procedure" a , a , a , a , a , a , a , , 11 12 21 13 22 31 14 ⋯ as was displayed in Figure 1.3.1.
The argument that the set Q of rational numbers is countable was first given in 1874 by Georg Cantor (1845-1918).
He was the first mathematician to examine the concept of Introduction to Real Analysis 26 infinite set in rigorous detail.
In contrast to the countability of Q, he also proved the set Rof real numbers is an uncountable set.
(This result willbe established in Section 2.5.)
In a series of important papers, Cantor developed an extensive theory of infinite sets and transfinite arithmetic.
Some of hisresults were quite surprising and generated considerable controversy among mathematicians of that era.
In a 1877 letter to his colleague Richard Dedekind, he wrote, after proving an unexpected theorem, "I see it,but I do not believe it", We close this section with one of Cantor's more remarkable theorems.
5.0 SUMMARY 1.3.13 Cantor's Theorem If A is any set, then there is no surjection of A onto the set P(A)of allsubsets of A.
Proof.
Suppose thatj : A ﬁ P(A) is a surjection.
Since j(a) is a subset of A, either a belongs to <p(a) or it does not belong to this set.
We let D : = {a ˛ A : a jˇ (a)}.
Since D is a subset of A, if $ is a surjection, then D = j(a )for some a ˛ A. o O We must have eithera ˛ D or a ˇ D. If a ˛ D, then since D = j (a ), we must have 0 o o 0 a ˛ j (a ),contrary to the definition of D. Similarly, if a ˇ D, then a jˇ (a ) so that a ˛ D, o 0 0 o o o which is also a contradiction.
Therefore, jcannot be a surjection.
Q.E.D.
Cantor's Theorem implies that there is an unending progression of larger and larger sets.
In particular, it implies that the collection P(N) of all subsets of the natural numbers N is uncountable.

7.0 BIBLOGRAPHY/REFERENCES MODULE 2 THE REAL NUMBERS In this chapter we will discuss the essential properties of the real number system R. Although it is possible to give a formal construction of this systemon the basis of a more primitive set (such as the set N of natural numbers or the set Q of rational numbers), we have chosen not to do so.
Instead, we exhibit a list of fundamental properties associated with the real numbers and show how further properties can be deduced from them.
This kind of activityis much more useful in learning the tools of analysis than examining the logicaldifficulties of constructing a model for R. The real number system can be described as a "complete ordered field", and we will discuss that description in considerable detail.
In Unit2.1,we first introduce the "algebraic" properties—often called the "field" properties in abstract algebra—that are based on the two operations of addition and multiplication.We continue the section with theintroductionof the "order" properties of R and we derive some consequences of these properties and illustrate their use in working with inequalities.
The notion of absolute value, which is based on the order properties, is discussed in Unit 2.2.
In Unit 2.3, we make the final step by adding the crucial "completeness" property to the algebraic and order properties of R. It is thisproperty, which was not fully understood untilthe late nineteenth century that underlies the theory of limits and continuity and essentially all that follows in this book.
The rigorous development of real analysis would not be possible without thisessential property.
In Unit2.4, we apply the Completeness Property to derive several fundamental resultsconcerning R, includingthe Archimedean Property, the existence of square roots, and the density of rational numbers in R. We establish, in Unit 2.5, the Nested Interval Property and use it to prove the uncountability of K. We also discuss its relation to binary and decimal representations of real numbers.
Part of the purpose of Unit 2.1 and 2.2 is to provide examples of proofs of elementary theorems from explicitly stated assumptions.
Students can thus gain experience in writing formal proofs before encountering the more subtle and complicated arguments relatedto the Completeness Property and its consequences, However, students who have previously studied theaxiomatic method and the technique of proofs (perhaps in a course on abstract algebra) can move to Unit 2.3 after a cursory look at the earlier sections.
A brief discussion of logic and types of proofs can be found in Appendix A at the back of the book.
Introduction to Real Analysis 28 Unit1 The Algebraic and Order Properties ofR 1.0 INTRODUCTION We begin with a brief discussion of the "algebraic structure" of the real number system.
We will give a short list of basic properties of addition and multiplication from which all other algebraic properties can be derived as theorems.
In the terminology of abstract algebra, the system of real numbers is a "field" with respect to addition and multiplication.
The basic properties listed in 2.
1.1 are known as {he field axioms.
A binary operation associates with each pair (a, b) a unique element B(a, b"), but we will use the conventional notations of a + b and a .
b when discussing the properties of addition and multiplication.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the Unit, reader should be able to (i) familiar with the essential properties of real numbers system R (ii) exhibt a list of fundamental properties associated with the real numbers (iii) show how further properties can be deducted from them.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 2.1.1 Algebraic Properties of RRRR On the set R of real numbers there are two binary operations, denoted by + and and calledaddition and multiplication, respectively.
These operations satisfy the following properties: (Al) a + b = b + a for all a, b in R(commutative property of addition); (A2) (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in R(associative property of addition); (A3) there exists an element 0 in R such that 0 + a = a and a + 0 = a for all a in R (existence of a zero element); (A4) for each a in R there exists an element -a in R such that a + (-a) = 0 and(-a) + a = 0 (existence of negative elements); (Ml) a .b = b .
a for all a, b in R(commutative property of multiplication); (M2) (a • b) • c =a • (b • c) for all a, b, c) in R(associative property of multiplication); (M3) there exists an element 1 in Rdistinct from 0 such that 1 • a = a and a • 1 = a for all a in R(existence of a unit element); (M4) for each a„0 in R there exists an element I/a in R such that a • (1/a) = 1 and (1/a) .a = 1 (existenceof reciprocals); (D) a .
(b + c) = (a • b) + (a • c) and (b + c) • a = (b • a) + (c • a) for all a, b, c in R (distributive property of multiplication over addition).
These properties should be familiar to the reader.
The first four are concerned with addition,the next four with multiplication,and the lastone connects the two operations.
The point of the list is that all the familiar techniques of algebra can be derived from these nine properties, in much the same spirit that the theorems of Euclidean geometry can be deduced from the five basic axioms statedby Euclid in his Elements.
Sincethis taskmore properly belongs to a course in abstract algebra, we will not carry it out here.
However, to exhibit the spirit of the endeavor, we will sample a few results and their proofs.
We first establishthe basic fact that the elements 0 and 1, whose existence were asserted in (A3) and (M3), are in fact unique.We also show thatmultiplicationby 0 always results in 0, 2.1.2 Theorem (a) If z and a are elements in R with 2 + a = a, then z = 0.
Introduction to Real Analysis 29 (b) I f u and b „0 are elements in Rwith u • b = b, then u = 1 .
(c) If a ˛ R, then a • 0 = 0.
Proof (a) Using (A3), (A4), (A2), the hypothesis z + a = a, and (A4), we get z=z+ 0 = z+(a+ (-a))= (z + a)+(-a)= a + (-a)=0.
(b) Using (M3), (M4), (M2), the assumed equality u • b = b, and (M4) again, we get u = u.1=u.(b.
(1/b))= (u • b) • (1/b)= b • (1/b)= 1.
(c) We have (why?)
a + a.
0 = a.
0 = a.
(1+0) = a .1 = a Therefore, we conclude from (a) that a .0 = 0.
Q.E.D.
We next establish two important properties of multiplication: the uniqueness of reciprocals and the fact that a product of two numbers is zero only when one of the factors is zero.
2.1.3 Theorem (a) If a „0 and b in R are such that a • b = 1, then b = 1/a.
(b) If a .b = 0, then either a = 0 orb = 0.
Proof.
(a) Using (M3), (M4), (M2), the hypothesis a • b = 1, and (M3), we have b = l .
b = ((1/a).
a) .
b = (I/a).
(a .
b) = (1/a).
1 = 1/a.
(b) It suffices to assume a 0 and prove that b = 0.
(Why?)
We multiplya - b by I/aand apply ≠ (M2), (M4) and (M3) to get (1/a).
(a .b) = ((I/a).
a) .
b = 1 .b = b.
Since a • b = 0, by 2.
1 .2(c) this also equals (1/a) .
(a.b) = ((1/a) .
0 = 0.
Thus we have b =0.
Q.E.D.
These theorems represent a small sample of the algebraic properties of the real number system.
Some additional consequences of the field properties are given in the exercises.
The operation of subtraction is defined by a — b := a + (- b) for a , b in R. Similarly, division is defined for a, b in R with b „ 0 by a/b :„ a • (l/b).In the following, we willuse this customary notation for subtraction and division, and we will use all the familiar properties of these operations.
We will ordinarily drop the use of the dot to indicate multiplication and write ab for a • b.
Similarly, we willuse the usual notation for exponents and write a2 for aa,a3 for (a2)a;and, in general, we define an+1:= (an)afor n ˛ N. We agree to adopt the convention that a1 = a.
Further, if a „ 0, we write a° = 1 and a-1 for 1/a,and if n˛ N, we will write a-nfor (1/a)n when it is convenient to do so.
In general, we willfreely apply all the usual techniques of algebra without further elaboration.
Rational and Irrational Numbers ______________________________________________ We regard the setN of natural numbers as a subset of R, by identifying the natural number n ˛ Nwiththe n-fold sum of the unit element 1 ˛ R. Similarly, we identify 0 ˛ Z with the zero element of 0 ˛ R, and we identify the n-fold sum of —1 with the integer —n.Thus, we consider Nand Z to be subsets of R. Elements of R that can be written in the form b/a where a, b ˛ Z and a „0 are called rational numbers.
The set of all rational numbers in R will be denoted by the standard notation Q.
The sum and product of two rational numbers is again a rational number (prove this), Introduction to Real Analysis 30 and moreover, the field properties listed at the beginning of this section can be shown to hold for Q.
The fact that there are elements in R that are not in Q is not immediately apparent.
In the sixth century B.C.
the ancient Greek society of Pythagoreans discovered that the diagonal of a square with unit sides could not be expressed as a ratio of integers.
In view of the Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles, this implies that the square of no rational number can equal 2.
This discovery had a profound impact on the development of Greek mathematics.
One consequence is that elements of R that are not in Q became known as irrational numbers, meaning that they are not ratios of integers.
Although the word "irrational" in modern English usage has a quite different meaning, we shall adopt the standard mathematical usage of this term.
We willnow prove that there does not exist a rational number whose square is 2.
In the proof we use the notions of even and odd numbers.
Recall that a natural number is even if it has the form 2n for some n ˛ N, and it is odd if it has the form 2n — 1 for some n ˛ N. Every natural number is either even or odd, and no natural number is both even and odd.
2.1.4 Theorem There does not exist a rational number r such that r2 = 2.
Proof.Suppose, on the contrary, that p and q are integers such that (p/q)2= 2.
We may assume that p and q are positive and have no common integer factors other than 1.
(Why?)
Since p2 — 2q2,we see that p2is even.
This implies that p is also even (because if p = 2n - 1 is odd, then its square p2= 2(2n2 - 2n + 1) — 1 is also odd).
Therefore, sincep and q do not have 2 as a common factor, then q must be an odd natural number.
Since p is even, then p = 2m for some m˛ N, and hence 4m2=2q2, so that 2m2=q2.
Therefore, q2is even, and it follows from the argument in the preceding paragraph thatq is an even natural number.
Since the hypothesis that (p/q)2= 2 leads to the contradictory conclusion that q isboth even and odd, it must be false.
Q.E.D.
The Order Properties of R __________________________________________________ The "order properties" of R refer to the notions of positivityand inequalitiesbetween real numbers.
As with the algebraic structure of the system of real numbers, we proceed by isolatingthree basic properties from which allother order properties and calculationswith inequalitiescan be deduced.
The simplest way to do this is to identify a special subset of R by usingthe notion of "positivity".
2.1.5 The Order Properties ofR There is a nonempty subset P of R, called the set of positive real numbers, that satisfies the following properties: (i) l f a , b belong to P, then a + b belongs to P. (ii) If a, b belong to P, then ab belongs to P. (iii) If a belongs to R, then exactly one of the following holds: a ˛ P, a = 0, -a ˛ P. The first two conditions ensure the compatibility of order with the operations of additionand multiplication, respectively.
Condition 2.1.5(iii) is usually called the Trichotomy Property, since it divides R into three distinct types of elements.
It states that the set {— a : a ˛ P} of negative real numbers has no elements in common with the set P of positive real numbers, and, moreover, the set R is the union of three disjoint sets.
Introduction to Real Analysis 31 If a ˛ P, we write a >0 and say that a is a positive (ora strictly positive) real number.
If a˛ P (0), we write a 0 and say that a is a nonnegative real number.
Similarly, if ∪ ≥ —a ˛ P we write a <0 and say that a is a negative (or a strictly negative) real number.
If -a ˛ P (0),we write a 0 and say that a is a nonpositive real number.
∪ (cid:16) The notion of inequality between two real numbers will now be defined in terms of the set P of positive elements.
2.1.6 Definition Let a, b be elements of.
R. (a) If a - b˛ P, then we write a >b or b < a.
(b) If a - b˛ P {0}, then we write a b or b a.
∪ ≥ (cid:16) The Trichotomy Property 2.1.5(iii)impliesthat for a, b ˛ R exactly one of the followingwillhold: a >b, a = b, a <b.
Therefore, if both a b and b a, then a = b.
(cid:16) (cid:16) For notational convenience, we will write a < b < c to mean that both a < b and b < c are satisfied.
The other "double" inequalities a b < c, a b (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) c, anda < b c are defined in a similarmanner.
(cid:16) To illustratehow the baste Order Properties are used to derive the "rules of inequalities", we willnow establishseveral resultsthat the reader has used in earlier mathematics courses.
2.1.7 Theorem Let a, b, c be any elements of R. (a) If a > b and b >c.
then a >c.
(b) If a > b, then a + c > b + c. (c) If a > b and c > 0, then ca > cb.
If a > b and c < 0. then ca < cb.
Proof.
(a) If a - b ˛ F and b - c ˛ P, then 2.1.5(1) implies that (a - b)+(b - c) = a — c belongs to P. Hence a >c.
(b)I f a - b ˛ P, then (a + c) - (b + c)= a - b is in P. Thus a + c> b +c.
(c) If a - b ˛ P and c˛ P, then ca - cb = c(a - b} is in P by 2.1.5(ii).
Thus ca > cb when c >0.
On the other hand, if c <0, then -c ˛ P, so that cb - ca = (-c)(a- b) is in P. Thus cb >ca when c <0.
Q.E.D.
It is natural to expect that thenatural numbers are positivereal numbers.
This property is derived from thebasic properties of order.
The key observation is that the square of any nonzero real number is positive.
2.1.8 Theorem (a) If a ˛ Rand a „ 0, then a2> 0.
(b) 1 > 0, (c) Ifn˛ N,thenn>0.
Introduction to Real Analysis 32 Proof.
(a)By the Trichotomy Property, if a „0, then either a˛ P or -a˛ P. If a˛ P, thenby 2.1.5(ii),a2 = a • a˛ P. Also, if -a ˛ P, then a2 = (-a)(-a) ˛ P. We conclude that if a „0, then a2> 0.
(b) Since 1=I2,it follows from (a) that 1 > 0.
(c) We use Mathematical Induction.
The assertion for n = 1 is true by (b).
If we suppose the assertion is true for the natural number k, then k˛ P, and since 1˛ P, we have k + 1 ˛ Pby 2.1.5(i).Therefore, theassertion is true for all natural numbers.
Q.E.D.
It is worth noting that no smallest positive real number can exist.
This follows by observing that if a > 0, then since ½ > 0 (why?
), we have that 0 <½ a < a.
Thus if it is claimed that a is the smallest positive real number, we can exhibit a smaller positivenumber 1/ a.
2 This observation leads to the next result, which will be used frequently as a method of proof.
For instance, to prove that a number a 0 is actually equal to zero, we see that it ≥ suffices to show that a is smaller than an arbitrary positive number.
2.1.9 Theorem If a ˛ R is such that 0< a < for every >0, then a =0.
Proof.
Suppose to the contrary that a > 0.
Then if we take := ½a, we have 0 0 < <a.Therefore, it is falsethat a < for every > 0 and we conclude that a = 0.
0 Q.E.D.
Remark It is an exercise to show that if a ˛ R is such that 0 a for every >0, (cid:16) (cid:16) then a = 0, The product of two positivenumbers is positive.However, the positivity of a productof two numbers does not imply that each factor is positive.
The correct conclusion is givenin the next theorem.
It is an important tool in working with inequalities.
2.1.10 Theorem If ab >0, then either (i) a > 0 and b >0, or (ii) a<0 andb< 0.
Proof.
First we note that ab >0 implies that a 0 and b „ 0.
(Why?)
From the Trichotomy ≠ Property, eithera >0 or a <0.
If a > 0, then 1/a> 0 (why?
), and therefore b=(1/a)(ab)>0.
Similarly,if a < 0, then 1 / a <0, so that b =(1/a)(ab)<0.
Q.E.D.
2.1.11 Corollary Ifab <0, then either (i) a <0 and b >0, or (ii) a >0 and b < 0.
Inequalities _________________________________________ ______________________ We now show how the Order Properties presented in this section can be used to "solve" certain inequalities.
The reader should justify each of the steps.
Introduction to Real Analysis 33 2.1.12 Examples (a) Determine the set A of all real numbers x such that 2x + 3 6.
(cid:16) We notethat we have+ x ˛ A 2x + 3 6 2x £3 x £3/ .
!
(cid:16) !
!
2 Therefore A = {x ˛ R : x2<3/ ).
2 (b) Determine the set B := {x ˛ R : x2 + x>2).
We rewrite the inequality so that Theorem 2.1.10 can be applied.
Note that Therefore, we either have (i) x — 1 > 0 and x + 2>0, or we have (ii) x — 1 < 0 and x + 2 <0.
In case (i) we must have both x >1 and x >—2, which is satisfied if and only The symbol shouldbe read “ifandonlyif”.
!
if x > 1.
In case (ii) we must have both x <1 and x < -2, which is satisfied if and only if x < -2.
We conclude that B = {x ˛ R : x > 1} ¨ {x ˛ R : x <-2}.
(c) Determine the set 2x + 1 C:=x ˛ R : < 1 x + 2 We note that 2x + 1 x - 1 x ˛ C -1 < 0 < 0. !
x + 2 !
x + 2 Therefore we have either (i) x - 1 < 0 and x + 2 > 0, or (ii) x — I > 0 and x + 2 < 0.
(Why?)
In case (i) we must have both x < 1 and x >-2, which is satisfied if and only if - 2 <x < 1 .
In case (ii), we must have both x >1 and x < - 2, which is never satisfied.
We conclude that C = {x ˛ R : —2 < x < 1}.
4.0 CONCLUSION The following examples illustrate the use of the Order Properties of R in establishing certain inequalities.
The reader should verify the steps in the arguments by identifying the properties that are employed.
It should be noted that the existence of square roots of positivenumbers has not yet been established; however, we assume the existence of these roots for the purpose of these examples.
(The existence of square roots willbe discussed in Unit 2.4.)
2.1.13 Examples (a) Let a 0 and b 0.
Then ≥ ≥ (1) a < b a2< b2 !
!√" < √$ We consider the case where a > 0 and b > 0, leaving the case a =0 to the reader.
It follows from 2.1.5(i)thata + b >0.
Since b2 - a2=(b - a)(b+ a),it follows from 2.1.
7(c) that b — a >0 implies that b2 - a2> 0.
Also, it follows from 2.1.10 that b2– a2> 0 implies that b — a > 0.
If a >0 and b > 0, then > 0 and > 0.
Since a = ( 2and b = ( )2 , the second √" √$ √") √$ implication is a consequence of the first one when a and b are replaced by and , √" √$ respectively.
We also leave it to the reader to show that if a 0 and b 0, then ≥ ≥ (1) a b a2 b2 (cid:16) !
(cid:16) !√" (cid:16) √$ Introduction to Real Analysis 34 (b) If a and b are positive real numbers, then their arithmetic mean is ½ (a+ b) and their geometric mean is .
The Arithmetic- Geometric Mean Inequality for a, b is √"$ (2) ½ (a+ b) √"$ (cid:16) with equality occurring if and only i f a = b.
To prove this, note that if a > 0, b > 0, and a „ b, then >0, >0 and „ .
√" √$ √" √$ (Why?)
Therefore it follows from 2.1.8(a) that ( 2> 0.
Expanding this square, we √"(cid:14) √$) obtain a - 2 + b >0, √"$ whence it follows that < ½ (a +b).
√"$ Therefore (2) holds (with strict inequality) when a „ b.
Moreover, if a = b (>0), then both sides of (2) equal a, so (2) becomes an equality.
This proves that (2) holds for a >0, b >0.
On the other hand, suppose that a >0, b > 0 and that = ½ (a + b} .
Then, squaring √"$ both sides and multiplying by 4, we obtain 4ab = (a + b)2= a1 + 2ab + b2, whence it follows that 0 = a2 - 2ab + b2 = (a - b)2 But this equality implies that a = b.
(Why?)
Thus, equality m (2) implies that a = b.
5.0 SUMMARY Remark The general Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality for the positive real numbers a , a , , a is 1 2⋯ n (3) (a , a , , a )1/n a + a + + a 1 2⋯ n (cid:16) 1 2 ⋯ n n with equality occurring if and only if a= a, = = a .It is possible to prove this more general l ⋯ n statement using Mathematical Induction, but the proof is somewhat intricate.

7.0 REFERENCES / TEXTBOOK Unit 2 Absolute Value and the Real Line 1.0 INTRODUCTION From the Trichotomy Property 2.1.5(iii), we are assured that if a ˛ R and a „ 0, then exactlyone of the numbers a and —a is positive.The absolute value of a „ 0 is defined to be the positiveone of these two numbers.
The absolute value of 0 is defined to be 0.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the Unit, the readers should be able to: (i) understand and define the concept of “Absolute Value” (ii) understand the concept of “Field” properties (iii) understand and farmiliar with the “Order” properties in Real Analysis 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 2.2.1 Definition The absolute value of a real number a, denoted by \a\,is defined by Introduction to Real Analysis 37 a if a >0, \a\ := 0 if a = 0, -a if a < 0.
For example, |5\ = 5 and \ — 8| = 8.
We see from the definition that |a| 0 for all a ˛ R, ≥ and that \a\ = 0 if and only if a = 0.
Also | — a\ = \a\ for all a ˛ R. Some additional properties are as follows.
2.2.2 Theorem (a) \ab\= \a\\b\for all a,b ˛ R. (b) \a\2=a2for all a ˛ R (c) If c 0, then \a\ c if and only if - c a c, ≥ (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) (d) -\a\ a \a\for all a R. (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:28) Proof.
(a) If eithera or b is 0, then both sides are equal to 0.
There are four other cases to consider.If a >0, b >0, then ab > 0, so that \ab\= ab =\a\\b\.If a > 0, b <0, then ab <0, so that \ab\ = —ab = a( - b) =\a\\b\.The remaining cases are treated similarly.
(b) Since a2> 0, we have a2 = \a2\ = \aa\ = \a\\a\ = \a\2.
(c) If |a| < c, then we have both a < c and — a c (why?
), which is equivalent to —c (cid:16) (cid:16) a c. Conversely, if — c a c, then we have both a < c and — a c (why?
), so that (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) \a\ c. (cid:16) (d) Take c = |a| in part (c).
Q.E.D.
The following important inequality willbe used frequently.
2.2.3 Triangle Inequality If a, b˛ ˛˛˛ R, then\a + b£\ £££ \a\ + \b\.
Proof.
From 2.2.2(d), we have -\a\ £ a £ \a\ and —\b\£ b£ \b\.On adding these inequalities,we obtain -(/a/ + /b/) £ a + b £/a/ + /b/.
Hence, by 2.2.2(c) we have /a + b\ \a\ + \b\.
Q.E.D.
(cid:16) It can be shown that equality occurs in the Triangle Inequality if and only if ab > 0, which is equivalent to saying that a and b have the same sign.
(See Exercise 2.)
There are many useful variations of the Triangle Inequality.
Here are two.
2.2.4 Corollary If a, b˛ R, then (a) //a/ - \b\/ \a - b\, (cid:16) (b) \a-b\ \a\ + \b\.
(cid:16) Proof, (a) We write a = a - b + b and then apply the Triangle Inequality to get \a\ =\(a– b) + \b\ \a- b\ + \b\.
Now subtract \b\ to get \a\ - \b\ \a - b\.
Similarly, from (cid:16) (cid:16) \b\ = \b - a +a\ \b - a\ + \a\,we obtain -\a - b\ = -\b = -\b- a\ \a\ - \b\.
If we (cid:16) (cid:16) combinethese two inequalities,using2.2.2(c), we get the inequality in (a).
(b) Replaced in the Triangle Inequalityby-b to get \a - b\ \a\ + 1 - b\.
Since | - b\ = \b\ we (cid:16) obtaintheinequalityin (b).
Q.E.D.
A straightforward application of Mathematical Induction extends theTriangle Inequalityto any finite number of elementsof R. Introduction to Real Analysis 38 2.2.5 Corollary If a , a a are anyreal numbers, then 1 2⋯, n |a + a + + a | |a | + |a | + + |a |.
1 2 ⋯ n (cid:16) 1 2 ⋯ n The following examples illustrate how the propenies of absolute value can be used.
2.2.6 Examples (a) Determine the set A of x ˛ R such that |2x + 3| < 7.
From a modification of 2.2.2(c)for thecase of strict inequality,we see that x ˛ A ifand only if — 7 <2x + 3 < 7, which is satisfied if and only if — 10 <2x < 4.
Dividing by 2, we conclude that A = {x ˛ R: -5 <x <2).
(b) Determine the set B := {x ˛ R: |.x– 1|<\x\}.
One method is to consider cases so that the absolute value symbols can be removed.
Here we take the cases (i) x 1, (ii) 0 x < 1 (iii) x <0 ≥ (cid:16) (Why did we choose these three cases?)
In case (i) the inequality becomes x -1 <x, which is satisfied without further restnction.
Therefore all x such that x 1 belong to the setB .
In ≥ case(ii), the inequality becomes —(x — 1) < x, which requires that x>½ .
Thus, this case contributes allx such that ½ <x <1 to the set B.
In case (iii), the inequality becomes — (.x — 1) <-x, which is equivalent to 1 < 0.
Since this statement is false, no value ofxfrom case (iii)satisfies the inequality.
Forming the union of the three cases, we conclude thatB = { x ˛ R: x > 1 / } .
2 There is a second method of determining the set B based on the fact that a < b if and only if a2< b2when both a 0 and b 0.
(See 2.1.13(a).)
Thus, the inequality |x- 1| < |x | is ≥ ≥ equivalent to theinequality|x-1||2<\x\2.Since |a|2= a2for any a by 2.2.2(b), we can expand the square to obtain x2 — 2x + 1 <x2, which simplifies to x >½.
Thus, we again find that B = {x ˛ R: > 1 / } This method of squaring can sometimes be used to advantage, but 2 often a case analysis cannot be avoided when dealing with absolute values.
(c) Let the function ƒ be defined by f(x) := (2x2 + 3x + l)/(2x - 1) for 2 x 3.
(cid:16) (cid:16) Find a constant M such that |ƒ(x)| M for all x satisfying 2 x 3.
We consider separately the (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) numerator and denominator of |ƒ(x)| = |2x2 + 3x + 1| |2x – 1| From the Triangle Inequality, we obtain |2x2 + 3x + 1| 2|x|2 + 3|x| + 1 2.32 + 3.3 + 1 = 28 (cid:16) (cid:16) since |x| 3 for the x under consideration.
Also, |2x– 1| 2\x\ - 1 2.2- 1 = 3 (cid:16) ≥ ≥ since |x| 2 for the x under consideration.
Thus, l/\2x- 1| 1/3 for x 2.
(Why?)
(cid:16) (cid:16) ≥ Therefore, for 2 x 3 we have |ƒ(x)| 28/3.
Hence we can take M = 28/3.
(Notethat we have (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) found one such constant M; evidently any number H > 28/3 will also satisfy |ƒ(x)| H.It is (cid:16) also possible that 28/3 is not the smallest possible choice for M.) □ 4.0 CONCLUSION The Real Line _____________________________________________________________ A convenient and familiar geometric interpretation of thereal number system is the real line.In this interpretation, the absolute value \a\ of an element a in R is regarded as the Introduction to Real Analysis 39 distance from a to the origin 0.
More generally, the distance between elements a and b in Ris |a-b\.
(See Figure 2.2.1.)
We will later need precise language to discuss the notion of one real number being "close to" another.
If a is a given real number, then sayingthat a real number* is "close to" ashould mean that the distance |x - a | between them is "small".
A context in which this idea can be discussed is provided by the terminology of neighborhoods, which we now define.

Then the '- neighborhood of a is the set V(a ) : = ε {x a˛ R|x–a|< }.

Ifx belongs to the neighborhood V (a) for every >0, ε then .x = a.
Proof.
If a particular x satisfies |x – a|< for every > 0, then it follows from 2.1.9 that |x — a\ = 0, and hence x = a. Q.E.D.

If a˛ U, then let be the smaller of the two numbers a and 1 — a.
Then it is an exercise to show that V(a) is contained in U.
Thus each ε element of U has some -neighborhood of it contained in U.
(b) If I := {x : 0 x 1), then for any > 0, the -neighborhood V(0) of 0 contains points not (cid:16) (cid:16) in I, and so V (0) is not contained in 1.

Figure 2.3.1 inf S and sup S Introduction to Real Analysis 42 2.3.2 Definition Let S be a nonempty subset ofR.
(a) If S is bounded above, then a number u is said to be a supremum (or a least upper bound) of S if it satisfies the conditions: (1) u is an upper bound of S, and (2) if is any upper bound of S, then u v. 0 (cid:16) (b) IfS is bounded below, then a number is said to be an infimum (or a greatest lower / bound) of S if ii satisfies the conditions: (1') is a lower bound of S, and / (2') if is any lower bound of S, then t .
1 (cid:16) / Itisnotdifficulttosee thattherecanbeonlyonesupremum ofagivensubsetSofR(Then wecan refer tothesupremumofaset insteadofasupremum.
)For,supposethat u and 1 u areboth supremaof S. Ifu <u ,then thehypothesisthat u isasupremum implies that 2 1 2 2 u cannot be an upper bound of S. similarly, we see that u <u is notpossible.
1 2 1 Therefore, we must have u = u .
A similar argument can be given to show that the infimum 1 2 of a set is uniquely determined.
If the supremum or the infimum of a set S exists, we will denote them by sup S and infS.
We also observe that if u1is an arbitrary upper bound of a nonempty set S, then sup S u’.
(cid:16) This is because sup S is the least of the upper bounds of S. First of all, it needs to be emphasized that in order for a nonempty set S in R to have a supremum, it must have an upper bound.
Thus, not every subset of R has a supremum; similarly, not every subset ofR has an infimum.
Indeed, there are four possibilities for a nonempty subset S of R: it can (i) have botha supremum and an infimum, (ii) have a supremum but no infimum, (iii) have a infimum but no supremum, (iv) have neithera supremum nor an infimum.
We also wish to stress thatin order to show that u =sup S for some nonempty subset Sof R, we need to show that both (1) and (2) of Definition 2.3.2(a) hold.
It willbe instructive to reformulate these statements.
First the reader should see that the following two statements about a number u and a set S are equivalent: (1) u is an upper bound of S, (1') s u for alls S. (cid:16) (cid:28) Also, the following statements about an upper bound u of a set S are equivalent: (2) ifvisanyupperbound ofS,thenu: v, (cid:16) (2') ifz<u,then zisnotanupper bound ofS, (2") ifz<u,then thereexists s Ssuch that z<s , z(cid:28) z (2"') if >0,thenthere exists s (cid:28)Ssu ch thatu- <s.

7.0 REFERENCES/TEXTBOOK Unit 4 Applications of the Supremum Property 1.0 INTRODUCTION We will now discuss how to work with suprema and infima.
We willalso give some very important applications of these concepts to derive fundamental properties of R. We begin with examples that illustrate useful techniques in applying the ideas of supremum and infimum.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, readers should be able to (i) apply the concept of “Completeness” properties to derive several fundamental results concerning R (ii) understand the conception of Archimedean Property, the existence of square root and the density of rational numbers in R 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 2.4.1 Example (a) It is an important fact that taking suprema and infima of sets is compatible with the algebraic properties of R. As an example, we present here the compatibility of taking suprema and addition.
Let S be a nonempty subset of R that is bounded above, and let a be any number in R. Define the set a + S := (a +s : s ˛ S}.
We will prove that sup(a+S) = a + sup S. If we let u := sup S, then x u for all x ˛ S, so that a + x a + u.
Therefore, a + u is (cid:16) (cid:16) an upper bound for the set a + S; consequently, we have sup(a+S) a + u.
(cid:16) Now if u is any upper bound of the set a + S, then a + x v for all x ˛ S. (cid:16) Consequently x v — a for all x ˛ S, so that v — a is an upper bound of S. Therefore, u = sup (cid:16) S v — a, which gives us a +u <v .
Since v is any upper bound of a + S, we can replace v by (cid:16) sup(a+ S) to get a + u sup(a + S).
(cid:16) Combining these inequalities,we conclude that sup(a+ S) = a + u = a + sup S. For similar relationships between the suprema and infima of sets and the operations of addition and multiplication, see the exercises.
(b) If the suprema or infima of two sets are involved, it is often necessary to establish results in two stages, working with one set at a time.
Here is an example, Introduction to Real Analysis 46 Suppose that A and B are nonempty subsets of R that satisfy the property: a b for alla ˛ A and allb ˛ B.
(cid:16) We will prove that sup A infB .
(cid:16) For, givenb ˛ B, we have a b for all a ˛ A.
(cid:16) -Thismeansthatb is an upper bound of A, sothatsupA b.
Next, sincethe lastinequalityholds for all (cid:16) b ˛ B , we see that the numbersupA is a lower bound for the set B.
Therefore, we conclude that sup A infB.
v□ (cid:16) Functions __________________________________________________________________ The idea of upper bound and lower bound is applied to functions by considering the range of a function.
Given a function ƒ : D ﬁ R, we say thatƒis bounded above if the set ƒ(D) = {ƒ(x) : x ˛ D) is bounded above in R; that is, there exists B ˛ R such that/(;c) < B for all x ˛ D. Similarly, the function / is bounded below if the set f ( D ) is bounded below.
We say that ƒ is bounded if it is bounded above and below; this is equivalent to saying that there exists B ˛ R such that|ƒ(x)| B for all x ˛ D. (cid:16) The following example illustrateshow to work with suprema and infima of functions.
2.4.2 Example Suppose that / and g are real-valued functions with common domain D ˝ R. We assume that ƒand g are bounded, (a) If f (x ) g(x)for allx˛ D, then sup ƒ(D) sup g(D),which is sometimes written: (cid:16) (cid:16) Sup ƒ(x) sup g (D) (cid:16) x ˛ D x ˛ D We first note that ƒ(x) g(x) supg(D),which implies that the number supg(D) is an (cid:16) (cid:16) upper bound forƒD).Therefore, supƒ(D) supg(D).
(cid:16) (b) We note that the hypothesis f ( x ) g(x)for all x ˛ D in part (a) does not imply any relation (cid:16) between sup f(D) and inf g(D), For example, if f(x) := x2and g(x) := x with D = {x : 0 x 1}, then f(x) g(x)for (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) all .x˛ D. However, we see that supƒ (D) = landinfg(D) = 0.
Since sup g(D) = 1, the conclusion of (a) holds.
(c) If ƒ(A) g(y) for allx, y ˛ D, then we may conclude that supƒ(D) infg(D), (cid:16) (cid:16) which we may write as: supƒ(x) mf g(y).
(cid:16) x˛ D y˛ D (Note that the functions in (b) do not satisfythis hypothesis.)
The proof proceeds in two stages as in Example 2.4. l(b).
The reader should write outthedetailsof the argument, Further relationships between suprema and infima of functions are given in the exercises.
Introduction to Real Analysis 47 The Archimedean Property Because of your familiarity with the set R and the customary picture of the real line, it may seem obvious that the set N of natural numbers is not bounded in R. How can we prove this "obvious" fact?
In fact, we cannot do so by using only the Algebraic and Order Properties given in Unit2.1.
Indeed, we must use the Completeness Property of R as well as the Inductive Property of N(that is, if n˛ N, then n + 1 ˛ N").
The absence of upper bounds for N means that given any real number x there exists a naturalnumber n (depending on x) such thatx < n. 2.4.3 Archimedean Property If x ˛ R, then there exists n ˛ Nsuch that x<n x x Proof.
If the assertion is false, then n x for all n ˛ N; therefore, x is an upper bound ofN.
(cid:16) Therefore, by the Completeness Property, the nonempty set N has a supremum u ˛ R.Subtracting 1 from u gives a number u — 1 which is smaller than the supremum u of N.Therefore u — 1 is not an upper bound of N, so there exists m ˛Nwith u — 1 < m. Adding 1 gives u < m + 1, and since m + 1 ˛ .
N, this inequality contradicts the fact that u is an upper bound of N, Q.E.D.
2.4.4 Corollary If S := {l/n: n ˛ N}.
then inf S = 0.
Proof.
SinceS „ 0 is bounded below by 0, it has an infimum and we let := inf S. It is clear / that 0.
For any > 0, the Archimedean Property implies that there existsn˛ Nsuchthat 1/ < / ≥ n, which implies l/n< .
Therefore we have 0 l/n< .
(cid:16) / (cid:16) But since >0 is arbitrary, it follows from Theorem 2.1.9 that = 0.
Q.E.D.
/ 2.4.5 Corollary Ift >0, there exists n˛ N such that 0<l/n < t. t t Proof.
Since inf{l/n : n ˛ N} = 0 and t >0, then t is not a lower bound for the set {l/n: n ˛ N}.
Thus there exists n˛ N such that 0 <l/n <t.
Q.E.D.
t t 2.4.6 Corollary If y >0, there exists n ˛ N such that n — 1 y < n y y (cid:16) y.
Proof.
The Archimedean Property ensures that the subset E := (m ˛ N : y < m} of Nis not y empty.
By the Well-Ordering Property 1.2,1,Ehas a leastelement, which we denote by n .Then y y ny — 1 does not belong to Ey, and hence we have ny — 1 (cid:16)y <ny.
Q.E.D.
Collectively, the Corollaries 2.4.4-2.4.6 are sometimes referred to as the Archimedean Property of R. The Existence of _________________________________________________________ √2 The importance of the Supremum Property lies in the fact that it guarantees the existence of real numbers under certain hypotheses.
We shall make use of it in this way many times.
At the moment, we shall illustrate this useby proving the existence of a positive real number x Introduction to Real Analysis 48 suchthat x2= 2; that is, the positive square root of 2.
It was shown earlier (see Theorem 2,1.4)that such an x cannot be a rational number; thus, we will be deriving the existence of at leastone irrational number.
2.4.7 Theorem There exists a positive real number x such that x2 = 2.
Proof.
Let S := {s˛ R: 0 s, s2<2}.
Since 1 ˛ S, the set is not empty.
Also, S is bounded (cid:16) above by 2, because if t >2, then t2> 4 so that t ˇ S. Therefore the Supremum Property implies that the set S has a supremum inR, and we let x := sup S. Note that x > 1.
We willprove that x2 = 2by ruling out the other two possibilities: x2< 2 and x2> 2.
Firstassume that x2<2.
We will show that thisassumption contradicts the fact that x =sup S by findingan n ˛ N such that x + 1/n˛ S, thus implying that x is not an upper boundforS.
To see how to choose n, note that 1/n2 1/nso that (cid:16) 2 x + 1 = x2+ 2x+1 x2 + 1 (2x + 1) (cid:16) n n n2n Hence if we can choose n so that 1 (2x + 1) <2 –x2 n thenwe get (x + 1/n)2< x2 + (2 — x2) = 2.
By assumption we have 2 - x2> 0, so that (2 — x2)/(2x+ 1) > 0.
Hence the Archimedean Property (Corollary 2.4.5) can be used to obtainn ˛ N such that 1 2-x2 n (cid:16)2x + 1 These steps can be reversed to show that for this choice of n we have x + l/n∈S, which contradicts the fact thatxis an upper bound of S. Therefore we cannot have x2< 2.
Now assume that x2> 2.
We will show that it is then possible to find m ∈Nsuch that x — 1/m is also an upper bound of S. contradicting the fact that x — sup S. To do this, note that 2 x - 1 = x2- 2x+1 x2 - 2 2 m m m2m Hence if we can choose m so that 2x x2-2 m < then (x — l/m)2>x2— (x2 — 2) = 2.
Now by assumption we have x2 — 2 >0, so that (x2 - 2)/2x> 0.
Hence, by the Archimedean Property, there exists m ˛ N such that 1 x2-2 m2x(cid:16) These steps can be reversed to show that for this choice of m we have (x - 1/m)2> 2.
Now if s˛ S, then s2< 2 < (x — l/m)2,whence it follows from 2.1.13(a) that s < x — l/m.
This implies that x — l/mis an upper bound for S, which contradicts the fact that x = sup S. Therefore we cannot have x2> 2.
Sincethe possibilities x2< 2 and .x2> 2 have been excluded, we must have x2 = 2.
Q.E.D.
Introduction to Real Analysis 49 By slightly modifying the preceding argument, the reader can show that if a > 0, then there is a unique b > 0 such that b2 = a.
We call b the positive square root of a and denote it by b = or b = a1/2.
A slightly more complicated argument involving the √" binomial theorem can be formulated to establish the existence of a unique positive nth root of a, denoted by or a1/n, for each n ˛ N. √" 4.0 CONCLUSION Remark If in the proof of Theorem 2.4.7 we replace the set S by the set of rational numbers T := {r ˛ Q :0 <r, r2<2}, the argument then gives the conclusion that y : = sup T satisfies y2= 2.
Since we have seen in Theorem 2.1.4 that y cannot be a rational number, it follows that the set T that consists of rational numbers does not have a supremum belonging to the set Q.
Thus the ordered field Q of rational numbers does not possess the Completeness Property.
Density of Rational Numbers in RRRR _____________________________________________ We now know that there exists at least one irrational real number, namely .
Actually there √"2 are "more" irrational numbers than rational numbers in the sense that the set of rational numbers is countable (as shown in Section 1.3), while the set of irrational numbers is uncountable (see Unit 2.5).
However, we next show that in spite of this apparent disparity, the set of rational numbers is "dense" in R in the sense that given any two real numbers there is a rational number between them (in fact, there are infinitely many such rational numbers).
2.4.8 The Density Theorem If x and y are any real numbers with x < y, then there exists a rational number r˛ Q such thatx<r<y.
Proof.It is no loss of generality (why?)
to assume that x > 0.
Since y - x> 0, itfollows from Corollary 2.4.5 that there exists n˛ N such that 1/n<y - x. Therefore,we have nx + 1<ny.If we apply Corollary 2.4.6 to nx > 0, we obtain m ˛ N withm — 1 <nx < m. Therefore, m nx + 1 <ny, whence nx < m < ny.
Thus, the rationalnumber r := m/n satisfies x <r < y.
(cid:16) Q.E.D.
5.0 SUMMARY To round out the discussion of the interlacing of rational and irrational numbers, we have the same "betweenness property" for the set of irrational numbers.
2.4.9 CorollaryIf x and y are real numbers with x <y, then there exists an irrational number z such thatx< z < y.
Proof.
If we apply the Density Theorem 2.4.8 to the real numbers x/ and y/ , we obtain a √2 √2 rational number r„ 0 (why?)
such that x y < 3 < √2 √2 Then z :=r √2 is irrational (why?)
and satisfies x <z < y. Q.E.D.

2.0 OBJECTIVE At the end of this Unit, readers should be able to (i) understand the “Nested Interval” property and its uses in proving the unaccountability of R (ii) understand its relation to binary and decimal representation of real numbers.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT Characterization of Intervals _________________________________________________ An obvious property of intervals is that if two pointsx,y with x <y belong to an intervalI, then any point lyingbetween them also belongs to I.
That is, if x < t < y, then the point t belongs to the same interval as x and y.
In other words, ifxand y belong to an interval I, thenthe interval [x,y] is contained in I.
We now show that a subset of R possessing this property must be an interval.
2.5.1 Characterization Theorem If S is a subset of Rthatcontains at least two points and has the property (1) if x ,y ˛ S and x < y, then[x,y]⊆S,then S is an interval.
Proof.
There are four cases to consider: (i) S is bounded, (ii)S is bounded above but not below, (iii)S is bounded below but not above, and (iv) S is neither bounded above nor below.
Case (i): Let a := infS and b := sup 5.
Then 5 c [a, b] and we will show that (a,b)˝ S. Introduction to Real Analysis 53 If a <z <b, then z is not a lower bound of S, so there exists a˛ S with x < z.
Also, z is not an upper bound of S, so there exists y ˛ S with z <y.
Therefore z ˛ [x,y], so property (1) implies that z˛ S. Since z is an arbitrary element of (a,b)we conclude that(a, b) ˝ S Now if a ˛ S and b ˛ S, then S = [a,b],(Why?)
Ifaˇ Sandbˇ S,then S =(a,b).
The other possibilities lead to either S = (a,b] or S = [a, b).
Case(ii): Letb := sup S. Then S˝ ˝˝˝ (- , b] and we will show that (— , b) ˝ S. For, if z< b, ∞ ∞ then there exist x,y ˛ Ssuchthat˛z˛˛˛ [x,y]˝ S.
(Why?)
Therefore (- , b) ˝ S. If b˛ S, then S = ∞ (- , b],and if b ˇ S, then S = (- , b).
∞ ∞ Cases (iii)and (iv) are left as exercises.
Q.E.D.
Nested Intervals ____________________________________________________________ We say that a sequence of intervals I ,n˛ N, is nested if the following chain of inclusions holds (see n Figure 2.5.
1): I ˚ I ˚ ˚ I ˚ I ˚ 1 2 ⋯ n n+1 ⋯ Figure 2.5.1 Nested intervals For example, if I := [0, 1/n] for n ˛ N, then I ˚ I for each n ˛ N so that this n n n+1 sequence of intervals is nested.
In this case, the element 0 belongs to all I and the n Archimedean Property 2.4.5 can be used to show that 0 is the only such common point.
(Prove this.)
We denote this by writing 5(cid:2) In = {0}, (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) It is important to realize that, in general, a nested sequence of intervals need not have a common point.
For example, if J := (0, l/n) for n ˛ N, then this sequence of intervalsis n nested, but there is no common point, since for every given x > 0, there exists (why?)
m˛ N such that 1/m<x so that x ˇ J .
Similarly, the sequence of intervals K :=(n, ), n ˛ N, is m n ∞ nested but has no common point.
(Why?)
However, it is an important property of R that every nested sequence of closed, hounded intervals does have a common point,as we willnow prove.
Notice that the completeness of R plays an essential role in establishing thisproperty.
2.5.2 Nested Intervals Property IfI =[a .b ], n ˛ N, is a nested sequence of closed n n n bounded intervals, then there exists a number ξ˛ Rsuch thatξ˛ 1 for all n˛ N. n Proof.
Since the intervals are nested, we have I ˝ I for all n˛ N, so that a b for all n 1 n(cid:16) 1 n˛ N. Hence, the nonempty set {a : n˛ N) is bounded above, and we let ξ be its supremum.
n Clearly a ξ for all n˛ N. n(cid:16) We claimalso that ξ b for all n. This is established by showing that for any particular (cid:16) n Introduction to Real Analysis 54 n, thenumber b is an upper bound for the set {a .k ˛ N).We consider two cases, (i) If k n k, then since I ˚ I , we have a b b .
(ii) If k < n, then since I ˚ I , we have (cid:16) n k k(cid:16) k(cid:16) n k n a a b .
(See Figure 2.5.2.)
Thus, we conclude that a b for all k, so that b is an k(cid:16) n(cid:16) n k(cid:16) n upper bound of the set (a .k ˛ N}.
Hence, x b for each n˛ N. Since a x b for k (cid:16) n n(cid:16) (cid:16) n all n, we have ˛x In for all n˛ N. Q.E.D.
Figure 2.5.2 If k < n, then I˝ ˝˝˝ I n k 2.5.3 Theorem If I : =[a ,b ] n˛ N, is a nested sequence ofclosed, bounded intervals such that the n n n , lengths b — a of I satisfy n n n inf{b - a : n ˛ N} = 0, n n then the number x contained in l for all n ˛ N is unique.
n Proof.
If η:=inf{b : n ˛ N),then an argument similar to the proof of 2.5.2 can be used n to show that a hfor all n, and hence that x h .In fact, it is an exercise (see Exercise n(cid:16) (cid:16) 10) to show that x.
˛ Ifor all n˛ N if and only if x x h. If we have inf(b — a : n ˛ n (cid:16) (cid:16) n n N) = 0, then for any >0, there exists an m ˛ N such that0 h - x b — a < .
(cid:16) (cid:16) m m Since thisholds for all > 0, it follows from Theorem 2.1.9 that h -x = 0.
Therefore, we conclude that x = his the only point that belongs to Infor every n ˛ N. Q.E.D.
The Uncountability of R The concept of a countable set was discussed in Unit 1.3 and the countability of the set Q of rational numbers was established there.
We willnow use theNested Interval Property to prove that the set R is an uncountable set.
The proof was given by Georg Cantor in 1874 in the first of his papers on infinite sets.
He later published a proof that used decimal representations of real numbers, and that proof willbe given later in this section.
2.5.4 Theorem The set R of real numbers isnot countable.
Proof.
We will prove that the unitinterval 1 := [0, 1] is an uncountable set.
This implies that theset R is an uncountable set, for if R were countable, then the subset / would also be countable, (See Theorem 1.3.9(a).)
The proof is by contradiction.If we assume that I is countable, then we can enumerate the set as I = {x , x , , x }.We first select a closedsubinterval I , of I such that x ˇ I ,.
then select 1 2 ⋯ n,⋯ 1 1 1 Introduction to Real Analysis 55 a closed subinterval I of I such that x ˇ I , and so on.
In this waywe obtain nonempty closed 2 1 2 2 intervals I ˚ I ˚ ˚ I ˚ 1 2 ⋯ n ⋯ such that I ˝ I and x ˇ .1 for all n. The Nested Intervals Property 2.5.2 implies thatthere exists n n n a point ˛x I such that ˛x I for all n. Therefore x „ x for alt n ˛ N, so the n n enumeration of I is not a complete listing of the elements of I, as claimed.
Hence, I is an uncountable set.
Q.E.D.
The fact that the set R of real numbers is uncountable can be combined with the fact that the set Q of rational numbers is countable to conclude that the set M\Q of irrational numbers is uncountable.
Indeed, since the union of two countable sets is countable (see 1.3.7(c)), if R\Q is countable, then since R = Q (R\Q), we conclude that R is also a countable set, which is a ∪ contradiction.
Therefore, the set of irrational numbers R\Q is an uncountable set.
Binary Representations ———————————————————————— We will digress briefly to discuss informally the binary (and decimal) representations of real numbers.
It will suffice to consider real numbers between 0 and 1, since the representations for other real numbers can then be obtained by adding a positive or negative number.
The remainder of this section can be omitted on a first reading.
If x ˛ [0, 1], we willuse a repeated bisectionprocedure to associate a sequence (a ) of 0s and 1s n as follows.
If x„ ½ belongs to the left subinterval [0, 1/ ]we take a := 0, while ifx belongs to 2 1 the right subinterval [1/ , l] we take a = 1.
If x = ½ , then we may take a, to be either 0 or 1.
In 2 1 any case, we have a a + 1 1 1 x 2 (cid:16) (cid:16) 2 We now bisect the interval {1/ a , 1/ (a + 1)}.
If x is not the bisection point and belongs to 2 1 2 1 the left subinterval we take a := 0, and ifx belongs to the right subinterval we take a := 1 .
2 2 If x =¼ or x =¾ , we can take a , to be either 0 or 1 .
In any case, we have 2 a a a a1 + 1 1 2 1 2 + 22 (cid:16)x (cid:16) 2 + 22 We continue thisbisection procedure, assigning at the nth stage the value a := 0 if x is not the n bisectionpoint and lies in the left subinterval, and assigning the value a := 1if x. lies in the n right subinterval.
In thisway we obtain a sequence (a ) of 0s or 1s that correspond to a nested n sequence of intervals containing the point x.
For each n, we have the inequality (2) a a a a a a + 1 21 + 2 2 2 + ⋯ + n 2n (cid:16) x (cid:16) 21 + 222 +⋯ + n 2n If x is the bisection point at the nthstage, then x = m/2nwith m odd.
In this case, we may choose either the left or the right subinterval; however, once this subinterval is chosen, then allsubsequent subintervals Introduction to Real Analysis 56 in the bisection procedure are determined.
[For instance, if we choose the left subinterval so that a = n 0, then x is the right endpoint of all subsequent subintervals, and hence a=1 for all k k n + 1 .
On the other hand, if we choose the right subinterval so that a = I, then x is the left ≥ n endpoint of all subsequent subintervals, and hence a= 0 for all k n + 1 .
For example, ifx= ¾ , k ≥ then the two possible sequences for x are 1,0,1, 1, 1, and 1, 1,0,0,0, .]
⋯ ⋯ To summarize: If x ˛ [0, 1], then there exists a sequence (a ] of 0s and 1s such that n inequality (2) holds for all n ˛ N. In this case we write (3) x = (.aa a ) 1 2⋯ n⋯ 2 andcall (3) a binary representation of x.
This representation is unique except when x = m/2nfor m odd, in which case x has the two representations x = (.aa a 1000 ) = (.aa a 0111 ) 1 2⋯ n-1 ⋯ 2 1 2⋯ n-1 ⋯ 2 one endingin Os and theother ending in 1s.
Conversely, each sequence of 0s and 1s is the binary representation of a unique real number in [0, 1].
The inequality corresponding to (2) determines a closed interval with length1/2n and the sequence of these intervals is nested.
Therefore, Theorem 2.5.3 implies thatthereexists a unique real number x satisfying (2) for every n ˛ N. Consequently, x has thebinary representation (.aa a ) 1 2⋯ n⋯ 2 4.0 CONCLUSION Remark The concept of binary representation is extremely important in this era of digital computers.
A number is entered in a digital computer on "bits", and each bit can be put in one of two states—either it will pass current or it will not.
These two states correspond to the values 1 and 0, respectively.
Thus, the binary representation of a number can be stored in a digital computer on a string of bits.
Of course, in actual practice, since only finitely many bits can be stored, the binary representations must be truncated.
If n binary digitsare used for a number x ˛ [0, 1], then the accuracy is at most 1/2n.
For example, to assure four-decimal accuracy, it is necessary to use at least 15 binary digits(or 15 bits).
Decimal Representations _____________________________________________________ Decimal representations of real numbers are similar to binary representations, except that we subdivideintervals intoten equal subintervals instead of two.
Thus, given x˛ [0, 1], if we subdivide [0, 1] into ten equal subintervals, then x belongs to a subinterval [b ,/10,(b + 1)/10] for some integer b, in (0, 1, .
9}.
Proceeding as in thebinary 1 1 1 ⋯ case, we obtain a sequence (b ) of integers with 0 b 9 for all n ˛ N such thatx satisfies n (cid:16) n(cid:16) (4) b b b b b b + 1 1 + 2 + + n x 1 + 2 + + n 10 102 ⋯ 10n (cid:16) (cid:16) 10 102 ⋯ 10n In thiscase we say that x has a decimal representation given by x = b b b 1 2 ⋯ n⋯ If x 1 and if B ˛ N is such that B x B + 1, then x =B.b b b where the decimal ≥ (cid:16) < 1 2⋯ n⋯ representation of x — B ˛ [0, 1] is as above.
Negative numbers are treated similarly.
Introduction to Real Analysis 57 The fact that each decimal determines a unique real number follows from Theorem 2.5.3, since each decimal specifies a nested sequence of intervals with lengths 1/10n.
The decimal representation of x ˛ [0, 1] is unique except when x is a subdivision pointat some stage,which can be seen to occur when x = m/10n for some m, n ˛ N, 1 m 10".
(cid:16) (cid:16) (We may also assume that m is not divisible by 10.)
When x is a subdivision pointat the «thstage, one choice for b corresponds to selecting the left subinterval, which n causesallsubsequent digitsto be 9, and the other choice corresponds to selectingthe right subinterval, which causes all subsequent digits to be 0.
[For example, if x = ½ then x = .4999 = .5000 , and if y = 38/100 then y = .37999 = .38000 .]
⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ Periodic Decimals_________________________________________________________ A decimal B.b b b is said to be periodic (or to be repeating), if there exist k, n ˛ Nsuch thatb = 1 2⋯ n⋯ n b for all n k. In this case, the block of digits bb b is repeated once the kthdigitis n+m ≥ k k+l⋯ k+m-1 reached.
The smallest number m with this property is called theperiod of the decimal.
For example, 19/88 = .2159090 90 has period m = 2with repeating block 90 starting at k = 4.
⋯ ⋯ A terminating decimal is a periodic decimal where the repeated block is simply the digit 0.
We will give an informal proof of the assertion: A positive real number is rational if and only if its decimal representation is periodic.
For, suppose that x = p/q where p,q˛ N have no common integer factors.
For convenience we will also suppose that 0 <p < q.
We note that the process of "long division" of q into p gives the decimal representation of p/q.
Each step in the division process produces a remainder that is an integer from 0 to q — 1.
Therefore, after at most q steps, some remainder will occur a second time and, at that point, the digitsin the quotient will begin to repeat themselves in cycles.
Hence, the decimal representation of such a rational number is periodic.
Conversely, if a decimal is periodic, then it represents a rational number.
The idea of the proof is best illustrated by an example.
Suppose that x =7.31414 14 We multiply by a power ⋯ ⋯ of 10 to move the decimal point to the first repeating block; here obtaining 10x = 73,1414 We now multiply by a power of 10 to move one block to the left of the decimal point; here ⋯.
getting 1000x = 7314.1414 We now subtract to obtain aninteger; here getting 1000x– 10x = ⋯.
7314 - 73 = 7241, whencex = 7241/990, a rational number.
5.0 SUMMARY Cantor's Second Proof ______________________________________________________ We will now give Cantor's second proof of the uncountability of R. This is the elegant "diagonal" argument based on decimal representations of real numbers.
2.5.5 Theorem The unit interval [0, 1] := {x ˛ R : 0 x 1} is not countable.
(cid:16) (cid:16) Proof.
The proof is by contradiction.
We willusethe fact that every real number x˛ [0, 1] has a decimal representation x = 0.b b b , where b = 0, 1 , 9.
Suppose that there is an 1 2 3⋯ i ⋯ enumeration x , x ,x of all numbers in [0, 1], which we display as: 1 2 3⋯ x = 0.b b b b , 1 11 12 13⋯ 1n⋯ x = 0.b b b b , 2 21 22 23⋯ 2n⋯ x = 0.b b b b , 3 31 32 33⋯ 3n⋯ ⋯ ⋯ x = 0.b b b b .
n n1 n2 n3⋯ nn⋯ ⋯ ⋯ Introduction to Real Analysis 58 We now define a real number y :=0.y y y y by setting y :=2 if b 5and y .
:= 7 if 1 2 3⋯ n⋯ 1 11≥ 1 b , 4; in general, we let 11 (cid:16) 2 if b 5 y := nn≥ n 7 if b 4 nn(cid:16) Then y˛ [0, 1].
Note that the number y is not equal to any of the numbers with twodecimal representations, since.
y „ 0, 9 for all n ˛ N. Further, sincey and x differ inthe nth decimal n n place, then y „ x for any n ˛ N. Therefore, y is not included in theenumeration of n [0, 1], contradicting the hypothesis.

Introduction to Real Analysis 61 3.0 MAIN CONTENT A sequence in a set S is a function whose domain is the set N of natural numbers, and whose range is contained in the set S. In this chapter, we will he concerned with sequences in R and will discuss what we mean by the convergence of these sequences.
3.1.1 Definition A sequence of real numbers (or a sequence in R) is a function defined on the set N={1, 2, } of natural numbers whose range is contained in the set R of realnumbers.
⋯ In other words, a sequence in R assigns to each natural number n = 1, 2, a uniquely ⋯ determined real number.
If X : Nﬁ R is a sequence, we will usually denote the value of X at n by the symbol x rather than using the function notation X(n).The values x are also called the n n terms or the elements of the sequence.
We will denote this sequence by the notations X, (x ), (x : n ˛ N).
n n Of course, we willoften use other letters, such as Y = (y ),Z=(z.
),and so on, to denote sequences.
k i We purposely use parentheses to emphasize that the ordering induced by the natural order of N is a matter of importance.
Thus, we distinguish notationally between the sequence (x : n ˛ N), whose infinitely many terms have an ordering, and theset of values {x : n ˛ N) in n n the range of the sequence which are not ordered.
For example, thesequence X := ((-1)n : n ˛ N) has infinitely many terms that alternate between —1 and 1, whereas the set of values {( — 1)n : n ˛ N} is equal to theset { —1, 1),which has only two elements.
Sequences are often defined by givinga formula for the nth term x .
Frequently, it is n convenient to listthe terms of a sequence in order, stopping when the rule of formation seems evident.
For example, we may define the sequence of reciprocals of the even numbers by writing 1111 X := 2, 4, 6, 8, ⋯ though a more satisfactory method is to specify the formula for the general term and write 1 : n X := 2n ˛ or more simply X = (l/2n) Another way of defining a sequence is to specify the value of x and give a formula for 1 x .
(n 1) in terms of x .
More generally, we may specify x and give a formula for n+1 ≥ n } obtaining x from x ,.x , ,x Sequences denned in this manner are said to be inductively (or n+1 1 2 ⋯ n. recursively) defined.
3.1.2 Examples (a) If b ˛ R, the sequence B := (b,b2, b3, ),all of whose terms equal b, is ⋯ called the constant sequence b.
Thus the constant sequence 1 is the sequence (1, 1, 1, ),and ⋯ the constant sequence 0 is the sequence (0, 0, 0, ).
⋯ (b) If b ˛ M, then B := (bn)is the sequence B =(b,b2,b3, ,bn, ).In particular, if ⋯ ⋯ b =1/ then we obtain the sequence 2 Introduction to Real Analysis 62 1 1111 : n = X := 2n 2, 4, 8,2 n⋯, , ⋯ ˛ (c) The sequence of (2n : n ˛ N) of even natural numbers can be defined inductively by x := 2, x := x +2, 1 n+1 n or by the definition y := 2, y := y +y .
1 n+1 1 2 (d) The celebrated Fibonacci sequence F := (f ) is given by the inductive definition n ƒ :=1.ƒ :=1, ƒ := ƒ + ƒ (n 2).
1 2 n+1 n-1 n ≥ Thus each term pastthe second is the sum of its two immediate predecessors.
The first ten terms of F are seen tobe(l,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55, ).
⋯ The Limit of a Sequence _____________________________________________________ There are a number of different limit concepts in real analysis.
The notion of limit of a sequence is themost basic, and it willbe thefocus of this module.
3.1.3 Definition A sequence X = (x )in R is said to converge to x ˛ R, or x is said to n be a limit of (x ), if for every >0 there exists a natural number K( )such that for all n n K( ),theterms x satisfy|x — x\ < .
≥ n n If a sequence has a limit, we say that the sequence is convergent; if it has no limit,we say that the sequence is divergent.
Note The notation K(f.) is used to emphasize that the choice of K depends on the value of .
However, it is often convenient to write K insteadof K( ),In most cases, a "small" value offwill usuallyrequire a "large" value of K to guarantee that the distance |x — x\ between n x and x is less than for all n K = K( ).
n ≥ When a sequence has limit x, we will use the notation lim X = x or lim(x ) = x. n We willsometimes use the symbolism x ﬁ x, which indicates the intuitive idea that the values n x"approach" the number x as n ﬁ .
n ∞ 3.1.4 Uniqueness of Limits A sequence in Rcan have, at most one limit.
Proof.
Suppose that x' and x" are both limits of (x ).
For each .
>0 there exist K' such that \x n n — x'\< /2 for all n ≥K',and there exists K" such that \xn - x"\ < /2for all n ≥K".
We let K be the larger of K' and K".
Then for n K we apply the Triangle Inequality to get ≥ \x' - x"\ = \x' - x +x - x"\ n n \x'– x \ + \ x - x"\< |2 + |2 = |2 (cid:16) n n Since > 0 is an arbitrary positive number, we conclude that x' — x" — 0.
Q.E.D.
Introduction to Real Analysis 63 For x ˛ R and > 0, recall that the -neighborhood of x is the set Vε( O) := [u ˛ R : |u-x\< }.
(See Unit 2.2.)
Since u ˛ V (x) is equivalent to \u — x\ < , the definition of convergence of a ε sequence can be formulated in terms of neighborhoods.
We give several different ways of saying that a sequence x converges to x in.
the following theorem.
n 3.1.5 Theorem LetX = (x ) beasequenceof real numbers, andletx ˛ R. Thefollowing n statements are equivalent.
(a) X converges to x.
(b) For every > 0, there exists a natural number K such that for all n K, the terms x satisfy ≥ n \x - x\ < .
n (c) For every > 0, there exists a natural number K such that for all n >K, the terms x satisfy n x — < x<x+ .
n (d) For every -neighborhood V(εx ) of x, there exists a natural number K such that for alln ≥K, the terms x belong to V(x).
n ε Proof.
The equivalence of (a) and (b) is just the definition.
The equivalence of (b), (c), and (d) follows from the following implications: |u-x| < !- < u- x < !
x - <u < x + !
u ˛ V (x).
ε With the language of neighborhoods, one can describe the convergence of the sequence X = (x )to the number x by saying: for each -neighborhood V(x) of x, all but a finite number of terms n ε ofX belong to V(x).
Thεe finite number of terms that may not belong to the -neighborhood are the terms x x, , x 1, 2 ⋯ k-1 Remark The definition of the limit of a sequence of real numbers is used to verify that a proposed value x is indeed the limit.
It does not provide a means for initially determining what that value of x might be.
Later results will contribute to this end, but quite often it is necessary in practice to arrive at a conjectured value of the limit by direct calculation of a number of terms of the sequence.
Computers can be helpful in this respect, but since they can calculate only a finite number of terms of a sequence, such computations do not in any way constitute a proof of the value of the Limit.
The following examples illustrate how the definition is applied to prove that a sequence has a particular limit.
In each case, a positive is given and we are required to find a K, depending on , as required by the definition.
3.1.6 Examples (a) Iim(l/n)=0.
If > 0 is given, then 1/ > 0.
By the Archimedean Property 2.4.5, there is a natural number K = K( ) such that 1/K< .
Then, if n K, we have l/n 1/K < .
Consequently, if ≥ (cid:16) n K, then ≥ 1 1 - 0 = < n ε n Therefore, we can assert that the sequence (l/n) converges to 0.
Introduction to Real Analysis 64 (b) lim(1/(n2+1)) = 0 Let >0 be given.
To find K, we first note that if n ˛ N, then ε 1 1 1 < n2 + 1 n2 n (cid:16) Now choose K such that 1/K< , as in (a) above.
Then n K implies that 1/n < , and therefore ≥ 1 1 1 n2 + 1 - 0 n2 += 1 n < <ε Hence, we have shown that the limit of the sequence is zero.
Given s > 0, we want to obtain the inequality 3n + 2 (c) lim = 3 n + 1 Give > 0, we want to obtain the inequality ε (1) 3n + 2 - 3 < n +1 ε when n is sufficiently large.
We first simplify the expression on the left: 3n + 2 3n + 2 - 3n - 3 -1 1 1 - 3 = = = < n + 1 n + 1 n+ 1 n + 1 n Now if the inequality l/n < is satisfied, then the inequality (1)holds.
Thus if 1/K< , then for ε ε any n K, we also have 1/n< andhence (1)holds.Therefore the limit of the sequence is 3.
≥ ε (d) If 0 < b <1, then lim(bn) = 0.
We willuse elementary properties of the natural logarithm function.
If > 0 is given, we ε see that bn< nIn b <In n > In / In b. ε!
ε!
ε (The last inequality is reversed because In b< 0.)
Thus if we choose K to be a number such that K > In / In b, then we willhave 0 <bn< for alln K. Thus we have lim (bn) = 0. ε ε ≥ For example, if b = .
8, and if = .01 is given, then we would need K > In .01/ln.8 20.6377. ε ≈ Thus K=21 would be an appropriate choice for = .01. ε 4.0 CONCLUSION Remark The K( ) Game In the notion of convergence of a sequence, one way to keep in ε mind the connection between the and the K is to think of it as a game called the K( ) Game.
In ε ε this game, Player A asserts that a certain number x is the limit of a sequence (x ).
Player B n challenges this assertion by giving Player A a specific value for > 0.
Player A must respond to ε the challenge by coming up with a value of K such that \x — x\ < for all n >K.
If Player A can n ε always find a value of K that works, then he wins, and the sequence is convergent.
However, if Player B can give a specific value of > 0 for which Player A cannot respond adequately, then ε Player B wins, and we conclude that the sequence does not converge to x.
In order to show that a sequence X = (x ) does no!
converge to the number x, it is n enough to produce one number > 0 such that no matter what natural number K ischosen, ε 0 k 0 Introduction to Real Analysis 65 one can find a particular n satisfying n K such that |x -x | (This will be discussed in more K K≥ n ≥ ε detail in Unit 3.4.)
3.1.7 Example Thesequence(0, 2, 0, 2, , 0, 2, )doesnotconvergetothenumber 0.
⋯ ⋯ If Player A asserts that 0 is the limit of the sequence, he willlose the K( )Game ε when Player B gives him a value of <2.
To be definite, let Player B give Player A ε the value = 1.
Then no matter what value Player A chooses for K, his response will ε0 not be adequate, for Player B will respond by selecting an even number n > K. Then the corresponding value is x = 2 so that |x - 0| = 2 > 1 = .Thus the number 0 is not the n n ε0 limitof the sequence.
□ 4.0 CONCLUSION Tails of Sequences __________________________________________________________ It is important to realize that the convergence (or divergence) of a sequence K — (x ) depends n onlyon the "ultimate behavior" of the terms.
By this we mean that if, for any natural number m, we drop the first m terms of the sequence, then the resulting sequence X converges if and m onlyif the originalsequence converges, and in thiscase, the limitsare thesame.
We willstatethisformally after we introduce the idea of a "tail” of a sequence.
3.1.8 Definition If X =(x ,x , , x , ) is a sequence of real numbers and if m is a given 1 2 ⋯ n ⋯ natural number, then the 'm -tail of X is the sequence X : = (x : n ˛ N) = (x .,x , ) m m+n m+n m+2 ⋯ For example, the 3-tailof thesequenceX =(2,4, 6, 8, 10, , 2n, ).is the sequence X= (8, ⋯ ⋯ 3 10, 12, , 2n + 6, ).
⋯ ⋯ 3.1.9 Theorem LetX= (x : n ˛ N) be a sequence of real numbers and let m ˛ N. Then n the m-tailX = (x : n ˛ N) of X converges if and only if X converges.
In this case, limX = m m+n m lim X.
Proof.
We note that for any p ˛ N, thepth term of X is the (p + m)th term of X.
Similarly, m if q > m, then the qthterm of X is the (q — m)th term of X .
m Assume X converges to x.
Then given any .
>0, if the terms of X for n >K( ) ε ε satisfy\x - x\ < then the terms of X fork K( )- msatisfy \x - x\ < .Thus we can take n ε m ≥ ε k ε K ( ) = K( )–m, so that X also converges to x. m ε ε m Conversely, if the terms of X for k K ( satisfy |x – x\< , then the terms of X for n m ≥ m ε) k ε K ( + m satisfy |x – x| < .
Thus we can take K ( = K ( + m. ≥ ε) n ε ε) m ε) Therefore, X converges to x if and only if Xm converges to x. Q.E.D We shallsometimes say that a sequence X ultimately has a certain property if some tail of X has this property.
For example, we say that the sequence (3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, ) is ⋯ ⋯ "ultimatelyconstant".
On the other hand, the sequence (3, 5, 3, 5, , 3, 5, ) is not ultimately ⋯ ⋯ constant.
The notion of convergence can be stated using this terminology: A sequence X converges to x if and only if the terms of X are ultimately in every -neighborhood of x.
Other instances of this "ultimate ε terminology" willbe noted below.
Introduction to Real Analysis 66 5.0 SUMMARY Further Examples ___________________________________________________________ In establishing that a number x is the limit of a sequence (x ),we often try to simplifythe difference n \x — x\ before considering an >0 and finding a K( ) as required by the definition of limit.
This was n ε ε done in some of the earlier examples.
The next result is a more formal statement of this idea, and the examples that follow make use of this approach.
3.1.10 Theorem Let (x ) be a sequence of real numbers and let x ˛ R. If (a )is a n n sequence of positive real numbers with lim(a ) = 0 and if for some constant C >0 and some n m˛ N we have \x – x| Ca for all n m, n (cid:16) n ≥ then it follows that lim(x ) = x. n Proof.
If >0 is given, then since lim(a ) = 0, we know there exists K = K( /C)such that ε n ε n K implies ≥ a = |a -0|< /C.
n n ε Therefore it follows that if both n K and n m, then ≥ ≥ |x -x\<Ca <C( /C)= .
n n ε ε Since ε> 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that x = lim(xn).
Q.E.D.
1 3.1.11 Examples (a) If a > 0, then lim = 0 1 + na Since a >0, then 0 <na <1 + na, and therefore 0 <1/(1 + na)<1/(na).Thus we have 1 -0 1 1 for all n ˛ N 1 + na (cid:16) a n Since lim(l/n) = 0, we may invoke Theorem 3.1.10 with C =1/aand m = 1to infer that lim(1/(l+na))=0.
(b) If 0<b <1, then lim(bn) = 0.
This limit was obtained earlier in Example 3.1.6(d).
We will give a second proof that illustrates the use of Bernoulli's Inequality (see Example 2.1.13(c)).
Since 0 <b < 1, we can write b = 1/(1 + a),where a := (1/b) — 1 so that a > 0.
By Bernoulli's Inequality, we have (1 + a)n 1 + na.Hence ≥ 1 1 1 0 <bn = (1 + a)n (cid:16) 1 + na < na Thus from Theorem 3.1.10 we conclude that lim(bn) =0.
In particular, if b =.8, so that a =.25, and if we are given = .01, then the preceding ε inequality gives us K( ) = 4/(.01) = 400.
Comparing with Example 3.1.6(d), where we obtained ε K = 25, we see this method of estimation does not give us the "best" value of K. However, for the purpose of establishing the limit, the size of K is immaterial.
(c) Ifc >0 thenlim(c1/n)=1.
, The case c = 1 is trivial, since then (c1//n)is the constant sequence (1, 1, ),which evidently ⋯ converges to 1.
If c > 1, then c1/n= 1 + d for some d > 0.
Hence by Bernoulli's Inequality 2.1.13(c), n n Introduction to Real Analysis 67 c = (1 + d )n 1 + nd for n ˛ N. n ≥ n Therefore we have c — 1 nd , so that d < (c — l)/n.
Consequently we have ≥ n n |c1/n – 1| = d (c – 1)1/ for n ˛ N. n n We now invoke Theorem 3.1.10 to infer that lim(c1/n) = 1 when c >1.
Now suppose that 0 <c <1; then c1/n= 1/(1 + h )for some h >0.
Hence Bernoulli's n n Inequality implies that 1 1 1 c = (1 + h )n (cid:16) 1 + nh < nh n n n From which it follows that 0 <h < 1/nc for n ˛ N. Therefore we have n h 1 0 <1 – c1/n = (1n + h )n <hn< nc n so that 1 1 | 1/n – 1| < for all n ˛ N c c n We now apply Theorem 3.1.10 to infer that lim(c1/n) = 1 when 0 <c < 1.
(d)lim(n1/n)= 1 Since n1/n > 1 for n > 1, we can write n1/n= I + k for some k > 0 when n >1.
Hence n n n = (1 + k )n for n >1.
By the Binomial Theorem, if n >1 we have n n = 1 +nk + 1/ n(n -1)k2 + 1 + ½n(n – 1)k2 n 2 n ⋯ ≥ n whence it follows that n – 1 ½ n (n – 1) k2 n Hence k2 2/n for n >I.If >0 is given, it follows from the Archimedean Property that there n(cid:16) ε exists a natural number Nsuch that 2/N< 2.
It follows that if n sup{2, N } then 2/n< 2, whence ε ≥ ε ε ε ε 0<n1/n- 1 = k (2/n)l/2 < n(cid:16) ε Since > 0 is arbitrary, we deduce that lim(n1/n)= 1. ε 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT Exercises for Unit3.1 1.

n 7.0 REFERENCES/FUTHER READINGS Unit 2 Limit Theorems 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this unit we will obtain some results that enable us to evaluate the limits of certain sequences of real numbers.
These results will expand our collection of convergent sequences rather extensively.
We begin by establishing an important property of convergent sequence that will be needed in this and later units.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, readers should be able to (i) understand common Limit theorems and Proofs (ii) show with example squeeze theorem and divergent sequence 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.2.1 Definition A sequence X = (x ) of real numbers is said to be bounded if there exists n a real number M > 0 such that |x | M for all n ˛ N. n (cid:16) Thus, the sequence (x ) is bounded if and only if the set {x : n˛ N} of its values is a n n bounded subset of R. 3.2.2 Theorem A convergent sequence of real numbers is bounded.
Proof,Suppose that lim(x ) = x and let : =1.
Then there exists a natural number K = n K(l)such that \x – x|<1for all n K. If we apply the Triangle Inequality with n K we n ≥ ≥ obtain |x | = |x – x + x| |x – x| + |x| <1 + |x|.
n n (cid:16) n If we set M := [|x|, |x|, , |x |, 1 + |x|] 1 2 ⋯ k-1 then it follows that \xn|(cid:16) M for all n ˛ N. Q.E.D.
We will now examine how the limit process interacts with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of sequences.
If X =(x )and Y = (y ) are sequences n n of real numbers, then we define their sum to be the sequence X +Y : = (x + y ), n n theirdifference to be the sequence X — Y := (x — y ).and their product to be the sequence n n X .Y := (x y ).
If c ˛ R, we define the multiple of X by c to be the sequence cX : n n =(cx ),Finally, if Z =(z ) is a sequence of real numbers with z 0 for alln ˛ N, then we n n n≠ define the quotient of X and Z to be the sequence X/Z := (x /z ).
n n For example, if X and Y are the sequences X := (2, 4, 6, 2n, ), Y := (1/ , ½, 1/ , , 1/ , ) ⋯ ⋯ 1 3 ⋯ n ⋯ Introduction to Real Analysis 70 then we have 3919 2n2 + 1 X + Y = , , , , 1 2 3 ⋯ n ⋯ 1717 2n2 – 1 X - Y = , , , 1 2 3 ⋯ n ⋯ X .
Y = (2, 2, 2, , 2, ), ⋯ ⋯ 3X = (6, 12, 18, , 6n ), ⋯ ⋯ X/Y = (2, 8, 18, , 2n2, ) ⋯ ⋯ We note that if Z is the sequence Z := (0, 2, 0, , 1 + (-1)n, , ⋯ ⋯) then we can define X + Z, X – Z and X .
Z, but X/Z is not defined since some of the terms of Z are zero.
We now show that sequences obtained by applying these operation s to convergent sequences give rise to new sequences whose limits can be predicted.
3.2.3 Theorem (a) Let X = (x )and Y = (y ) be sequences of real numbers that n n converge to x and y, respectively, and let c ˛ R .
Then the sequence X + Y, X – Y, X.Y, and cX converges to x + y, x – y, xy, and cx, respectively.
(b) If X = (x ) converges to x and Z = (z ) is a sequence of nonzero real numbers that n n converges to z and if z „0, then the quotient sequence X/Z converges to x/z.
Proof (a) To show that lim(x + y )| = x + y, we need to estimate the magnitude of |(xn + yn) – n n (x + y)|.
To do this we use the Triangle Inequality 2.2.3 to obtain |(x +y ) – (x + y)| = |(x – x) + (y – y)| n n n n |x – x| + |y - y|.
(cid:16) n n By hypothesis, if > 0 there exists a natural number K such that if n K ,then \x — x\ 1 ≥ 1 n < /2; also there exists a natural number K such that if n K , then \y - y\ < /2, Hence if 2 ≥ 2 n K( ):= sup{K ,K },it follows that if n K( )then 1 2 ≥ |(x +y ) – (x + y)| |x – x| + |y – y| n n (cid:16) n n < ½ + ½ = Since >0 is arbitrary, we infer that X + Y = (x + y ) converges to x + y. n n Precisely the same argument can be used to show that X — Y = (x — y ) converges to n n x - y.
To show that X .
Y = (x y ) converges to xy,we make the estimate n n \x y –xy|= \(x y - x y)+ (x y – xy)| n n n n n n |x (y – y)| + |(x – x)y| (cid:16) n n n = |x ||y – y| + |x – x||y|.
n n n According to Theorem 3.2.2 there exists a real number M > 0 such that |x | M for all n 1 n (cid:16) 1 ˛ Nand we set M := sup{M , |y|}.
Hence we have the estimate 1 Introduction to Real Analysis 71 \x y - xy\ M\y - y\ + M\x - x\.
n n (cid:16) n n From the convergence of X and Y we conclude that if > 0 is given, then there exist natural numbers K and K such that if n K then \x — x\ < /2M, and if n K then \y - y< /2M.
1 2 ≥ 1 n ≥ 2 n Now let K( ) = sup{K ,K };then, if n K( )we infer that 1 2 ≥ \x y - xy\ M\y –y| +M\x - x\ n n (cid:16) n n < M( /2M) + M( /2M) = .
Since > 0 is arbitrary, thisproves that the sequence X.Y = (x y ) converges to xy.
n n The fact that cX = (cx )converges to ex can be proved in the same way; it can also be n deduced by taking Y to be the constant sequence (c, c, c, ).We leave the details to thereader.
⋯ (b) We next show that if Z = (z ) is a sequence of nonzero numbers that converges to a n nonzero limit z, then die sequence (1/z ) of reciprocals converges to 1/z.
First let := ½|z| so n 9 that 9>0.
Since lim(zn) = z, there exists a natural number K1such that if n >K1then \zn — z|<9.
It follows from Corollary 2.2.4(a) of the Triangle Inequality that - -|z — z\ \z \—|z\ for n 9 (cid:16) n (cid:16) n K ,whence it follows that ½|z| = \z\ - \z \ for n K .Therefore l/|z | 2/|z| for n ≥ 1 9 (cid:16) n ≥ 1 n (cid:16) ≥ K so we have the estimate 1 1 1 z – z 1 - = n = |z – z | z z z z |z z| n n n 2 (cid:16) |z|2 |z – zn| For all n ≥K1 Now, if > 0 is given, there exists a natural number K , such that if n K then \z — z\ <1/ |z\2.
2 ≥ 2 n 2 Therefore, it follows that if K( ) =sup{K ,K },then 1 2 1 1 - For all n K z z <( ) 2 ( ) n Since >0 is arbitrary, it follows that 1 1 lim = z z n The proof of (b) is now completed by taking Y to be the sequence (l/z ) and using the n factthat X .
Y = (xn/zn}converges to x(l/z)= x/z.
Q.E.D.
Some of the results of Theorem 3.2.3 can be extended, by Mathematical Induction, to a finite number of convergent sequences.
For example, if A = (a ),B = (b ), , Z = (z ) are n n ⋯ n convergent sequences of real numbers, then their sum A + B + + Z =(a + b + + z ) is a ⋯ n n ⋯ convergent sequence and (1) lim(a + b + + z ) = lim(bn) + + lim(z ) n n ⋯ n ⋯ n Also their product A .
B Z := (a b z ) is a convergent sequence and ⋯ n n⋯ n (2) lim(a b z ) = (lim(a )) (lim(b )) (lim(z )).
n n⋯ n n n ⋯ n Hence, if k ˛ N and if A = (a ) is a convergent sequence, then n (3) lim(ak) = (lim(a))k n n Introduction to Real Analysis 72 We leavethe proofs of these assertions to the reader.
3.2.4 Theorem If X = (x ) is a convergent sequence of real numbers and ifx 0 for n n≥ all n ˛ N, then x = lim(x ) 0. n ≥ Proof.
Suppose the conclusionis not true and that x <0; then := — x is positive.
Since X converges to x, there is a natural number K such that x - < xn < x + for all n K ≥ In particular, we have X <x + = x + (-x) = 0.
But this contradicts the hypothesis K that xn≥0 for alln ˛ N. Therefore, thiscontradiction implies that x ≥0.
Q.E.D.
We now give a useful result that is formally stronger than Theorem 3.2.4.
3.2.5 TheoremIf X =(x )and Y = (y )are convergent sequences of real numbers and ifx y n n n(cid:16) n for all n ˛ N, then lim(x ) lim(y ).
n (cid:16) n Proof.Let z := y - x so that Z := (z ) =Y - X and z 0 for all n ˛ N. It follows from n n n n n≥ Theorems 3.2.4 and 3,2.3 that 0 lim Z = lim(y ) – lim (x ), (cid:16) n n so that lim(xn) (cid:16)lim(yn).
Q.E.D.
The next result asserts that if allthe terms of a convergent sequence satisfy an inequality of the form a x b, then the limit of the sequence satisfies the same inequality.
Thus if the (cid:16) n(cid:16) sequence is convergent, one may "pass to the limit" in an inequality of this type.
3.2.6 TheoremIf X = (x ) is a convergent sequence and if a x b for all n ˛ N, then a n (cid:16) n(cid:16) lim(x) b.
(cid:16) n (cid:16) Proof.Let Y be the constant sequence (b,b, b, )•Theorem 3.2.5 implies that limX ⋯ (cid:16) lim Y=b.
Similarly one shows that a lim X. Q.E.D.
(cid:16) The next result asserts that if a sequence Y is squeezed between two sequences that converge to the same limit, then it must also converge to this limit.
3.2.7Squeeze Theorem Suppose that X = (x ),Y = (y ), and Z = (z ) are sequences of n n n real numbers such that x y z for all n ˛ N < n(cid:16) n(cid:16) n and that lim(x ) = lim(z ).
Then Y = (y ) is convergent and n n n lim(x ) = lim(y ) = lim(z ) n n n Proof.Let := lim(x ) = lim(z ).If >0 isgiven, then it followsfrom the convergence of X and Z to / n n that there exists a natural number K such that if n K then / ≥ |x – | and |z - | < n / < n / Since the hypothesis implies that Introduction to Real Analysis 73 x – y - z - for all n ˛ N n / (cid:16) n / (cid:16) n / it follows (why?)
that - <y - < n / for all n ≥K.
Since > 0 is arbitrary, this implies that lim(yn ) = /.
Q.E.D.
4.0 CONCLUSION Remark Since any tail of a convergent sequence has the same limit, the hypotheses of Theorems 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.2.6, and 3.2.7 can be weakened to apply to the tail of a sequence.
For example, in Theorem 3.2.4, if X = (x ) is "ultimately positive" in the sense that there exists m ˛ N n such thatxn≥ 0 for alln ≥ m, thenthe same conclusionthat X≥ 0 willhold.
Similar modifications are validfor theother theorems, as the reader should verify.
3.2.8Examples (a) The sequence (n)is divergent.
It follows from Theorem 3.2.2 that if the sequence X := (n)is convergent, then there exists a real number M> 0 such thatn = |n|< M for all n ˛ N. But this violates the Archimedean Property 2.4.3.
(b) The sequence ((-!)")
is divergent.
This sequence X = ((—1)n)is bounded (take M := 1),so we cannot invoke Theorem 3.2.2.
However, assume that a := lim X exists.
Let := 1so that there exists a naturalnumber K such 1 that |(-l)–a|<1 for all n K ≥ 1 If n is an odd natural number with n K ,this gives | — 1 — a|<1, so that -2 <a <0.
≥ 1 (Why?)
On the other hand, if n is an even natural number with n K this inequality gives |1 ≥ 1, — a|< 1 so that 0 <a <2.
Since a cannot satisfy both of these inequalities, the hypothesis that X is convergent leads to a contradiction.
Therefore the sequence X is divergent.
2n + 1 lim = 2 (c) n If we let X := (2) and Y := (1/n), then ((2n + l)/n) = X + Y.
Hence it follows from Theorem 3.2.3(a) that lim(X + Y) = lim X + lim Y = 2 + 0 = 2.
2n + 1 lim = 2 (d) n + 5 Since the sequences (2n + 1) and (n + 5) are not convergent (why?
), it is not possible to use Theorem 3.2.3(b) directly.
However, if we write 2n + 1 2 + 1/n = n + 5 1 + 5/n we can obtain the given sequence as one to which Theorem 3,2.3(b) applies when we take X := (2 + 1/n) and Z := (1 + 5/n).
(Check that all hypotheses are satisfied.)
Since lim X =2andlimZ=1 0. we deduce thatlim((2n + l)/(n+ 5)) = 2/1 = 2.
≠ 2n (e) lim n =2 + 0 1 Theorem 3.2.3(b) does not apply directly.
(Why?)
We note that Introduction to Real Analysis 74 2n 2 n2 + 1 = n + 1/n but Theorem 3.2.3(b) does not apply here either, because (n + 1/n) is not a convergemt sequence, (Why not?)
However, if we write 2n 2/n n2 + 1 = 1 + 1/n2 then we can apply Theorem 3.2.3(b), since lim(2/n) =0 and lim(l+l/n2)= 1 0 ≠ Therefore lim(2n/(n2+ 1)) =0/1 = 0.
Sin n lim = 0 (f) n We cannot apply Theorem 3.2.3(b) directly, since the sequence (n) is not convergent [neither is the sequence (sinn)].
It does not appear that a simple algebraic manipulation willenable us to reduce the sequence intoone to which Theorem 3.2.3 will apply.
However, if we note that — 1 sinn 1. then it follows that (cid:16) (cid:16) 1 sin n 1 - for all n (cid:16)(cid:16)n n Hence we can apply the Squeeze Theorem 3.2.T7y tpoe ienqfeura ttihoant hliemre(n. -1 sin n) = 0.

5.0 SUMMARY 3.2.9 Theorem Let the sequence X = (x ) converge to x.
Then the sequence (|x |) of n n absolute values converges to |x|.That is, if x =lim(x ), then \x\ = lim(|x |).
n n Proof.
It follows from the Triangle Inequality (see Corollary 2.2.4(a) that |x | - |x|| |x – x| for all n ˛ N n (cid:16) n The convergence of (x |) to |x| is then an immediate consequence of the convergence of (x ) to x. n n Introduction to Real Analysis 75 3.2.10 Theorem Let X = (x )be a sequence of real numbers that converges to x and n suppose that xn≥ 0.
Then the sequence ((cid:19) x n )of positive square roots converges and lim ((cid:19) x n ) = √(cid:13).
Proof.
It follows from Theorem 3.2.4 that x= lim(x ) 0 so the assertion makes sense.
We n ≥ now consider the two cases: (i) x = 0 and (ii) x> 0.
Case (i) If x = 0, let > 0 be given.
Since x 0 there exists a natural number K such n→ that if n K then ≥ 0 xn = xn – 0 < 2.
(cid:16) Therefore [see Example 2.1.13(a)], 0 < for n K. Since > 0 is arbitrary, this implies (cid:16) √(cid:13)n ≥ that 0.
√(cid:13)n→ Case (ii) If x > 0, then > 0 and we note that √(cid:13) - = ( - ) ( + ) = x - x √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) n + + √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) Since + > 0, it follows that √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) ≥ √(cid:13) 1 - | |x - x| √(cid:13)n √(cid:13) (cid:16) n √(cid:13) The convergence of √(cid:13)n→ √(cid:13) follows from the fact that xn →x.

By 3.2.4 it follows that L 0.
Let r be a number such that L < r <1, and let := r – L ≥ >0.
There exists a number K ˛ N such that if n K then ≥ x n + 1 - L< x n It follows from this (why?)
that if n K, then ≥ <Lx+n+ 1 = L + (r – L) = r xn Therefore, if n K, we obtain ≥ 0 <x <x r < x r2< <x rn-k+1 n+1 n n-1 ⋯ k If we set C := x /rK, we see that 0 <x <Crn+1 for all n K. Since 0 <r <1, it follows from K n+1 ≥ 3.3.11(b) that lim(rn) = 0 and therefore from Theorem 3.1.10 that lim(xn) = 0.

n n n n 7.0 REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS Unit 3.3 Monotone Sequences 1.0 INTRODUCTION Until now, we have obtained several methods of showing that a sequence X = (x ) of real n numbers is convergent: Introduction to Real Analysis 78 (i) We can use Definition 3.1.3 or Theorem 3.1.5 directly.
This is often (but not always) difficult to do.
(ii) We can dominate \x — x\ by a multiple of the terms in a sequence (a ) known n n to converge to 0, and employ Theorem 3.1.10.
(iii) We can identify X as a sequence obtained from other sequences that are known to be convergent by taking tails, algebraic combinations, absolute values, or square roots, and employ Theorems 3.1.9, 3.2.3, 3.2.9, or 3.2.10.
(iv) We can "squeeze" X between two sequences that converge to the same limit and use Theorem 3.2.7.
(v) We can use the "ratio test" of Theorem 3.2.11.
Except for (iii), all of these methods require that we already know (or at least suspect) the value of the limit, and we then verify that our suspicion is correct.
There are many instances, however, in which there is no obvious candidate for the limit of a sequence, even though a preliminary analysis may suggest that convergence is likely.
In this and the next two sections,we shall establish results that can be used to show a sequence is convergent even though the value of the limit is not known.
The method we introduce in thissectionis more restricted in scope than the methods we give in the next two, but it is much easier to employ.
It applies to sequences that are monotone in the following sense.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit readers should be able to (i) understand monotone increasing and decreasing (ii) state monotone Convergence Theorem (iii) understand Euler’s number with example.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.3.1 Definition Let X = (x ) be a sequence of real numbers, We say thatX is increasing if it n satisfies the inequalities x x x x 1(cid:16) 2(cid:16) ⋯ (cid:16) n(cid:16) n+1(cid:16) ⋯ We say that X is decreasing if it satisfies the inequalities x x x x 1≥ 2≥ ⋯ ≥ n≥ n+1≥ ⋯ We saythat X is monotone if it is either increasing or decreasing.
The following sequences are increasing: (1,2,3,4, ,n, ), (1,2,2,3,3,3, ), ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (a,a2,a3, , an, ) if a > 1.
⋯ ⋯ The following sequences are decreasing: (1, 1/2, 1/3, , l/n, ), (1, 1/2, 1/22, , 1/2n-1, ), ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (b, b2,b3, ,bn, ) if 0 <b <1.
⋯ ⋯ The following sequences are not monotone: (+1, -1, +1, , (-l)n+1, ) , (-1, +2, -3, , (-l)nn ) ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ The following sequences are not monotone, but they are "ultimately" monotone: (7, 6, 2.
1, 2.
3, 4, ), (-2, 0.
1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ).
⋯ ⋯ Introduction to Real Analysis 79 3.3.2 Monotone Convergence Theorem A monotone sequence of real numbers is con- vergent if and only if it is bounded.
Further: (a) If X = (x ) is abounded increasing sequence, then n lim(x ) = sup{x : n ˛ N).
n n (b) I f Y = (y )is a bounded decreasing sequence, then n lim(y ) = inf{y : n ˛N}.
n n Proof.
It was seen in Theorem 3.2.2 that a convergent sequence must be bounded.
Conversely, let X be a bounded monotone sequence.
Then X is either increasing or decreasing.
(a) We first treat thecase where X = (x )is a bounded, increasing sequence.
Since X is n bounded, there exists a real number M such that x M for all n˛ N. According to the n(cid:16) Completeness Property 2.3.6, the supremum x*= sup{x : n ˛ N} exists in R; we will show that n x* = lim(x ).
n If > 0 is given, then x* — is not an upper bound of the set {x : n ˛ N}, and hence there n exists a member of set X such that x* — <X .The fact that X is an increasing sequence implies K K that XK(cid:16) xnwhenever n ≥ K, so that x* — <x , x x*< x* + for all n K. k (cid:16) n(cid:16) ≥ Therefore we have \x –x*|< for all n K. n ≥ Since >0 is arbitrary, we conclude that (x ) converges to x*.
n (b) If Y = (y ) is a bounded decreasing sequence, then it is clear that X := — Y =(—y )is a n n bounded increasing sequence.
It was shown in pan (a) that lim X =— sup{-y : n ˛ N}.
Now n lim X = — lim Y and also, by Exercise 2.4.4(b), we have Sup{-y : n ˛ N} n Therefore lim Y = -lim X = inf{y : n ˛ N} n The Monotone Convergence Theorem establishes the existence of the limit of a bounded monotone sequence, It also gives us a way of calculating the limit of the sequence provided we can evaluate the supremum in case (a), or the infimum in case (b).
Sometimes it is difficult to evaluate this supremum (or infimum), but once we know that it exists, it is often possible to evaluate the limit by other methods.
3.3.3 Examples (a) lim(l/ ) = 0.
√(cid:26) It is possible to handle this sequence by using Theorem 3.2.10; however, we shall use the Monotone Convergence Theorem.
Clearly 0 is a lower bound for the set (l/ : n ˛ N),and it is not √(cid:26) difficult to show that 0 is the infimum of the set {l/ : n˛ N};hence 0 = lim(l/ ).
√(cid:26) √(cid:26) On the other hand, once we know that X := (l/ ) is bounded and decreasing, we know that it √(cid:26) converges to some real number x.
Since X = (l/ ) converges to x, it follows from Theorem 3.2.3 that X .
X √(cid:26) = (l/n)converges to x2.Therefore x2 = 0, whencex = 0.
(b) Let.x := 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + + l/nfor n ˛ N. n ⋯ Since x = x + 1/(n+ 1) >x ,we see that (x) is an increasing sequence.
By the Monotone n+1 n n n Convergence Theorem 3.3.2, the question of whether the sequence is convergeni or not is reduced to the question of whether the sequence is bounded or not.
Attempts to use direct numerical calculations to arrive at a conjecture concerning the possible boundedness of the sequence (x ) lead to inconclusive frustration.
n Introduction to Real Analysis 80 A computer run will reveal the approximate values x 11.4 for n =50,000,and x 12.1 for n = n≈ n≈ 100,000.
Such numerical facts may lead the casual observer to conclude that the sequence is bounded.
However, the sequence is in fact divergent, which is established by noting that x n = 1 + 1 + 1 1 + + + 1 + +1 2 2 3 4 ⋯ 2n-1 + 1 ⋯ 2n 1 11 1 1 > = 1 + + + + + + + 2 4 4 ⋯ 2n ⋯ 2n 1 11 = 1 + + + + 2 2 ⋯ 2 n = 1 + 2 Since (xn) is unbounded, Theorem 3.2.2 implies thatit is divergent.
The terms x increase extremely slowly.
For example, it can be shown that to achieve n x >50 would entail approximately 5.2 x 1021 additions, and a normal computer performing 400 n million additions a second would require more than 400,000 years to performthe calculation (there are 31,536,000 seconds in a year).
Even a supercomputer that canperform more than a trillion additions a second, would take more than 164 years to reachthat modest goal.
Sequences that are defined inductively must be treated differently.
If such a sequence is known to converge, then the value of the limit can sometimes be determined by using the inductive relation.
For example, suppose that convergence has been established for the sequence (x ) n defined by 1 x = 2, x = 2 + , n˛ N 1 n+1 x If we let x = lim(x ) then we also have x =lim(x ) since the 1-tail (x ) converges to the same n n+1 n+1 limit.
Further, we see thatx 2, so that x 0 and x 0 for all n˛ N. Therefore, we may apply n≥ ≠ n≠ the limit theorems for sequences to obtain 1 1 x = lim(x ) = 2 + = 2 + n+1 lim(x ) x n Thus, the limit x is a solution of the quadratic equation x2 - 2x — 1 = 0, and since x must be positive, we find that the limit of the sequence is x = 1 + .
√2 Of course, the issue of convergence must not be ignored or casually assumed.
For example, if we assumed the sequence (y ) defined by y := 1, y := 2y + 1 is convergent with n 1 n+1 n limity, then we would obtain y = 2y + I, so that y = — 1.
Of course, thisis absurd.
In the following examples, we employ thus method of evaluating limits, but only after carefully establishing convergence using the Monotone Convergence Theorem.
Additional examples of this type will be given in Unit 3.5.
3.3.4 Examples (a) Let Y =(y ) be defined inductively by y := 1, y := ¼ (2y + 3) for n 1 n+1 n n 1 .
We shall show that lim Y = 3/2.
≥ Introduction to Real Analysis 81 Direct calculation shows that y = 5/4.
Hence we have y, < y < 2.
We show, by 2 2 Induction,that y < 2 for all n ˛ N. Indeed, this is true for n =1, 2.
If y < 2 holds for some n k k ˛ N, then y = ¼ (2y +3) < ¼ (4 + 3) = 7/ < 2, k+1 k 4 so that y <2.
Therefore y <2for all n ˛ N. k+1 n for some k\ then 2^ + 3 <2y + 3, k+l We now show, by Induction, that y < y for all n ˛ N. The truth of this assertion has n n+l been verified for n = 1.
Now suppose that y <y for some k; then 2y + 3 < 2y+1 + 3, whence it k k+1 k k follows that y = ¼ (2y +3) < ¼ (2y + 3) = y < 2, k+1 k k+1 k Thus y < y implies that y < y .
Therefore y <y for all n ˛ N. k k+l k+1 k+2 n n+1 We have shown that the sequence Y = (y )is increasing and bounded above by 2.
It n follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem that Y converges to a limit that is at most 2, In this case it is not so easy to evaluate lim(y ) by calculating sup{y : n ˛ N}.
However, there is n n another way to evaluate its limit.
Since y =¼ (2y + 3) for all n ˛ N, the nthterm in the 1-tail n+l n Y , of Y has a simple algebraic relation to the nthterm of Y.
Since, by Theorem 3.
.1.9, we have y 1 := lim Y = lim Y, it therefore follows from Theorem 3.2.3 (why?)
that 1 y = ¼ (2y + 3) from which it follows that y =3/2.
(b) Let Z = (z ) be the sequence of real numbers defined by z := 1, z := for n ˛ N. We n 1 n+l √2Gn will show that lim(zn) = 2.
Note that z=1 andz = ; hence 1 <z<z <2.
We claim that the sequenceZ is l 2 √2 l 2 increasing and bounded above by 2.
To show this we will show, by Induction, that 1 z <zn+1 < 2for all n ˛ N. This fact has been verified for n = 1.
Suppose that it is true for n (cid:16) n = k; then 2 2z <2z <4, whence it follows (why?)
that (cid:16) k k+1 1 < zk+1 = <z = < = 2 √2 (cid:16) √2Gk k+2 √2Gk+1 √4 [In thus laststep we have used Example 2.1.13(a).]
Hence the validity of the inequality 1 z<z < (cid:16) k k+1 2 implies the validity of 1 z < < 2.
Therefore 1 z <z < 2 for all n ˛ N. (cid:16) k+1 zk+2 (cid:16) n n+1 Since Z = (z ) is a bounded increasing sequence, it follows from the Monotone n Convergence Theorem that it converges to a number z := sup{z }.
It may be shown directly n that sup{z } = 2, so that z = 2.
Alternatively we may use the method employed in part (a).
The n relation z = gives a relation between the nth term of the 1-tail Z of Z and the nth term n+1 √2Gn 1 of Z.
By Theorem 3.1.9, we have limZ = z =lim Z.
Moreover, by Theorems 3.2.3 and 3.2.10, 1 it follows that the limit z must satisfy the relation z = √2z Hence z must satisfy the equationz2= 2z which has theroots z =0, 2.
Since the terms of z = (z ) all satisfy 1 z 2, it follows from Theorem 3.2.6 that we must have 1 z 2. n (cid:16) n(cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:16) Therefore z = 2.
□ Introduction to Real Analysis 82 The Calculation of Square Roots We now give an application of the Monotone Convergence Theorem to the calculation of square roots of positive numbers.
3.3.5 Example Let a >0; we will construct a sequence (s ) of real numbers that n converges to .
√" Let s > 0 he arbitrary and define sn+1 := 1/ (s + a/s ) for n ˛ N. We now show that 1 2 n n the sequence (s )converges to .
(This process for calculating square roots was known in n √" Mesopotamia before 1500 B.C.)
We first show that s2 a for n 2.
Since s satisfies the quadratic equation s2 — n≥ ≥ n n 2s s + a = 0, this equation has a real root.
Hence the discriminant 4s2 — 4a must be n+1 n n+1 nonnegative; thatis, s2 a for n 1. n+1≥ ≥ To see that (s ) is ultimately decreasing, we note that for n 2we have n ≥ 1 a 1s2 – a s – s = s - s + = n = 0 n n+1 n 2 n s 2 s ≥ n n Hence, s s for all n 2.
The Monotone Convergence Theorem implies that s : = n+1(cid:16) n ≥ lim(s )exists.
Moreover, from Theorem 3.2.3, the limit s must satisfy the relation n 1 a s= s+ 2 s whence it follows (why?)
that s = a/s or s2= a.
Thus s = .
√" For the purposes of calculation, it is often important to have an estimate of how rapidly thesequence (s )converges to .
As above, we have s for all n 2, whence it follows n √" √" (cid:16) n ≥ that a/s s .Thus we have n(cid:16) √" (cid:16) n 0 s - s – a/s = (s2 – a)/s forn 2 (cid:16) n √" (cid:16) n n n n ≥ Using this inequality we can calculate to any desired degree of accuracy.
√" 4.0 CONCLUSION Euler's Number We conclude this section by introducing a sequence that converges to one of the most important "transcendental" numbers in mathematics, second in importance only to .
I 3.3.6 Example Let :=(1 + 1/n)nforn ˛ N. We will now show that the sequence E = Jn ( )is bounded and increasing; hence it is convergent.
The limit of this sequence is the famous Jn Euler number e, whose approximate value is 2.718281828459045 , which is taken as the base ⋯ of the "natural" logarithm.

In 1727, Euler went to Russia to join Johann's son, Daniel, at the new St. Petersburg Academy.
There he met and married Katharina Gsell, the daughter of a Swiss artist.
During their long marriage they had 13 children, but only five survived childhood.
In 1741, Euler accepted an offer from Frederick the Great tojointhe Berlin Academy, where he stayed for 25 years.
During this period he wrote landmark books on calculus and a steady stream of papers.
In response to a request for instruction in science from the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau.
ha wrote a multt-volume work on science that became famous under the title Letters to a German Princess.
In 1766, he returned to Russiaat the invitationof Catherine the Great.
His eyesight had deteriorated over the years, and soon after his return to Russia he became totally blind.
Incredibly, his blindness made little impact on his mathematical output, for he wrote several books and over 400 papers whileblind.He remained busy and active until the day of his death.
Euler's productivity was remarkable: he wrote textbooks on physics, algebra, calculus, real and complex analysis, analytic and differential geometry, and the calculus of variations.
He also wrote hundreds of original papers, many of which won prizes.
A current edition of his collected works consists of 74 volumes.

(ii) prove important existence theorem known as the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.4.1 Definition Let X = (x ) be a sequence of real numbers and let n <n < <n < be a n 1 2 ⋯ k ⋯ strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers.
Then the sequence X’ = (x ) given by n k (x , x , , x , ) n1 n2 ⋯ nk ⋯ Introduction to Real Analysis 86 is called a subsequence of X.
For example, if X := (1/ , ½, 1/ , ), then the selection of even indexed terms produces 1 3 ⋯ the subsequence 111 1 X = , , , , , 2 4 6 ⋯ 2k ⋯ where n = 2, n = 4, , n = 2k, .
Other subsequences of X = (1/n) are the following: 1 2 ⋯ k ⋯ 11, 1 , , , 1 , 111 , 1 , , , , ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 1 3 5 2k-1 2!

The following sequences are not subsequences of X = (1/n) 111111 111 ,, , , , , , , 0, , 0, , 0, .
2 1 4 3 6 ⋯5 1 3 5 ⋯ A tail of a sequence (see 3,1.8) is a special type of subsequence.
In fact, the m-tail corresponds to the sequence of indices n = m + 1, n = m + 2, , n = m + k, , 1 2 ⋯ k ⋯ But,clearly, not every subsequence of a given sequence need be a tail of the sequence.
Subsequences of convergent sequences also converge to the same limit, as we now show.
3.4.2 Theorem If a sequence X =(x )of real numbers converges to a real number x, n then any subsequence X' =(x ) of X also converges to x .
n k Proof: Let >0 be given and let K( ) be such that if n ≥ K( ),then |xn– x| < .
Since n <n < <n < is an increasing sequence of natural numbers, it is easilyproved (by 1 2 ⋯ k ⋯ Induction) that n k. Hence, if k K( ),we also have n k K( ) sothat \x — x\ k≥ ≥ k≥ ≥ n k < Therefore the subsequence (x ) also converges to x. n Q.E.D k 3.4.3 Example (a) lim(bn) = 0 if 0 <'b< 1.
We have already seen, in Example 3.1.1l(b), that if 0 <b <1 and if x := bn, then it n follows from Bernoulli's Inequality that lim(x ) = 0.
Alternatively, we see that since 0 <b <1, n then x = bn+l< bn= x so that the sequence (x ) is decreasing.
It is also clear that 0 x 1, n+l n n (cid:16) n(cid:16) so it follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2 that the sequence is convergent.
Let x :=limx .
Since (x ) is a subsequence of (x ) it follows from Theorem 3.4.2 that x = n 2n n lim(x ).Moreover, it follows from the relationx = b2n = (bn)2 = x2 and Theorem 3.2.3 that 2n 2n n x = lim(x ) = (lim(x ))2 = x2 2n n Therefore we must either have x =0 or x = 1.
Since the sequence (x ) is decreasing and bounded n above by b <1, we deduce that x = 0.
(b) lim(c1/n) = 1 forc > 1.
This limit has been obtained in Example 3.1.11(c) for c >0, using a rather ingenious argument.
We give here an alternative approach for the case c > 1.
Note that if z :=c1/n, then z >1 n n Introduction to Real Analysis 87 and z < z for all n ∈N.
(Why?)
Thus by the Monotone ConvergenceTheorem, the limit z := n+1 n lim(z ) exists.
By Theorem 3.4.2, it follows that z = Iim(z ).
In addition, it follows from the relation n 2n Z = c1/2n = (c1/n)1/2 = z1/2 2n n and Theorem 3.2.10 that z = lim(z ) = (lim(z ))1/2 = z1/2 2n n Therefore we have z2=.
z whence it follows that either z = 0 or z = 1.
Since z >1 for all n ˛ N, we n deduce that z = 1.
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to consider the case 0 <c <1.
□ The following result is based on a careful negation of the definition of lim(x ) =x.
It leads to n a convenient way to establish the divergence of a sequence.
3.4.4 Theorem Let X = (x ) be a sequence of real numbers.
Then the following are equivalent: n (i) The sequence X = (x ) does not converge to x ˛ R. n (ii) There, exists an > 0 such that for any k˛ N, there exists n ˛ N such that n k 0 k k≥ and |x – x| .
n ≥ 0 k (iii) There exists an > 0 and a subsequence X' ~ (x ) of X such that \x - x\ for all 0 n n ≥ 0 k˛ N k k Proof: (i) (ii) If (x ) does not converge to x, then for some > 0 it is impossible ⇒ n 0 to find a natural number k such that for all n k the terms x satisfy \x — x| .
That is,for ≥ n n ≥ 0 each k˛ N it is not true that for all n k the inequality |x - x| < holds.
In other words, for ≥ n 0 each k˛ Nthere exists a natural number n .
k such that |x – x| .
k ≥ n ≥k 0 (ii) (iii) Let be as in (ii) and let n ˛ Nbe such that n1 1 and \x – x| .
Now let ⇒ 0 1 ≥ n ≥ 0 1 n ˛ Nbe such that n > n and \x - x\ ; let n ˛ Nbe such that n >n and \x — x\ .
2 2 1 n ≥2 0 3 3 2 n 3 ≥ 0 Continue in this way to obtain a subsequence X' = (x ) of X such that \x - x\ for all k n k n k ≥ 0 ˛ N. (iii) (i) Suppose X = (x ) has a subsequence X' = (x ) satisfying the condition ⇒ n n k in (iii).
Then X cannot converge to x;for if it did, then, by Theorem 3.4.2, the subsequence X' would also converge to x.
But this is impossible, since none of the terms of X' belongs to the 0-neighborhood of x Q.E.D.
Since all subsequences of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we have part (i) in the following result.
Part (ii) follows from the fact that a convergent sequence is bounded.
3.4.5 DivergenceCriteria If a sequence X = (x ) of real numbers has either of the n following properties, then X is divergent.
(i) X has two convergent subsequences X' = (x ) and X" = (x ) whose limits are not n r equal.
k k (ii) X is unbounded.
3.4.6 Examples (a) The sequence X := ((—1n))is divergent.
Introduction to Real Analysis 88 The subsequence X' := ((—l)2n)= (1, 1, ) converges to 1, and the subsequence X" := ⋯ ((—1)2n-1) = (-1, — 1, ) converges to —1.
Therefore, we conclude from Theorem 3.4.5(i) that X ⋯ is divergent.
(b) The sequence (l,½ , 3, ¼ , ) is divergent.
⋯ This is the sequence Y =(y ),where y = n if n is odd, and y — 1/nif n is even.
It can n n n easily be seen that Y is not bounded, Hence, by Theorem 3.4.5(ii), the sequence is divergent.
(c) The sequence S := (sinn) is divergent.
This sequence is not so easy to handle.
In discussing it we must, of course, make use of elementary properties of the sine function.
We recall that sin( /6) = ½ = sin(5 /6) and that I I sinx>½ for x in the interval1 := /6, 5 /6).
Since the length of 1 is 5 /6– /6 = 2 /3 >2, 1 I I 1 I I I there are at least two natural numbers lying inside 1 ; we let n be the first such number.
1 1 Similarly, for each k ˛ N, sin x > ½ for x in the interval.
1 := ( /6 + 2 (k – 1), 5 /6 + 2 (k - 1)).
k I I I I Since the length of l is greater than 2, there are at least two natural numbers lying inside 1 ; we k k let nbe the first one.
The subsequence S` := (sinn )of S obtained in this way has the property k k that all of its values lie in the interval [1/ ,l].
2 Similarly, if k ˛ N and J is the interval k J := (7 /6 + 2 (k – 1), 11 /6 + 2 (k – 1).
k I I I I then it is seen that sinx < - ½ for all x˛ J and the length of J is greater than 2.
Let m be the first k k k natural number lying in J.
Then the subsequence S" :=(sin m} of S has the property that all of its k k values lie in the interval [- 1,- ½ ].
Given any real number c, it is readily seen that at least one of the subsequences S'and S" lies entirely outside of the ½-neighborhood of c. Therefore c cannot be a limit of S. Since ˛c ˛˛˛ R. is arbitrary, we deduce that S is divergent.
□ The Existence of Monotone Subsequences While not every sequence is a monotone sequence, we will now show that every sequence has a monotone subsequence.
3.4.7Monotone Subsequence Theorem IfX = (x )is a sequence of real numbers, then n there is a subsequence of X that is monotone.
Proof.
For the purpose of this proof, we will say that the mth term x is a "peak" if x x for m m≥ n all n such that n m. (That is, x is never exceeded by any term that follows it in the ≥ m sequence.)
Note that, in a decreasing sequence, every term is a peak, while in an increasingsequence, no term is a peak.
We will consider two cases, depending on whether X has infinitely many, or finitely many, peaks.
Case 1: X has infinitely many peaks.
In this case, we list the peaks by increasing subscripts: x , x , , x , .Since each term is a peak, we have m1 m2 ⋯ mk ⋯ x x x .
m1≥ m≥2⋯ ≥ m≥ ⋯ k Therefore, the subsequence (x )of peaks is a decreasing subsequence of X. m k Introduction to Real Analysis 89 Case 2: X has a finite number (possibly zero) of peaks.
Let these peaks be listed by increasing subscripts: x , x , , x , .Let s: = m+ 1 be the first index beyond the lastpeak.
Since m1 m2 ⋯ mk l r xis not a peak, there exists x>s such that x< x .
Since xis not a peak, there exists s >s such s1 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 3 2 that xs< xs.Continuing in this way, we obtain an increasing (xs) of X. Q.E.D.
3 2 k It is not difficult to see that a given sequence may have one subsequence that is increasing, and another subsequence that is decreasing.
The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem We will now use the Monotone Subsequence Theorem to prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, which states that every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
Because of the importance of this theorem we will also give a second proof of it based on the Nested Interval Property.
3.4.8 The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem A bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.
First Proof: It follows from the Monotone Subsequence Theorem that if X = (x ) is a n bounded sequence, then it has a subsequence X' = (x ) that is monotone.
Since n k thissubsequence is also bounded, it follows from theMonotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2 that the subsequence is convergent.
Q.E.D.
Second Proof.Since the set of values {x : n ˛ N) is bounded, this set is contained in an interval n I:=[a,b].We take n : = 1.
1 1 We now bisect I , intotwo equal subintervals 1'and I", and divide the set of indices {n 1 1 1 ˛ N: n > 1} into two parts: A := {n ˛ N: n >n ,x ˛ I'} B := {n ˛ N: n >n ,x ˛ I"} l 1 n 1 2 1 n 1 If A is infinite, we take I := I' and let n be the smallest natural number in A .
(See 1.2.1.)
1 2 1 2 2 If A is a finite set, then B must be infinite, and we take I :=I' and letn be the smallest 1 1 2 1 2 natural number in B .
l We now bisect I into two equal subintervals I' and I'' and divide the set [n ˛ N: n 2 2 2 >n )intotwo parts: 2 A := {n ˛ N: n >n ,x ˛ I' }, B := {n ˛ N: n >n ,x ˛ I'' } 2 2 n 2 2 2 n 2 If A is infinite, we take I := I' and let n be the smallest natural number in A .If A is a finite 2 3 2 3 2 2 set, then B must be infinite, arid we take I := I'' and letn be the smallest natural number in B , 2 3 2 3 2 We continue in this way to obtain a sequence of nested intervals I ⊇I ˚ ˚ I ˚ and a 1 2 ⋯ k subsequence (x ) of X such that x ˛ I for k˛ N. Since the length of I isequal to (b-a)/2k-1, it n k n k k k follows from Theorem 2.5.3 that there is a (unique) common point ˛x I for all k˛ N. Moreover, k since x and x both belongto I ,we have n k k |x - x | (b – a)/2k-1 n (cid:16) k whence it follows that the subsequence (xn)k of X converges tox Q.E.D.
Theorem 3.4.8 is sometimes calledthe Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem for sequences, because there is another version of it that deals with bounded sets in R (see Exercise 11.2.6).
Introduction to Real Analysis 90 4.0 CONCLUSION It is readily seen that a bounded sequence can have various subsequences that converge to different limits or even diverge.
For example, the sequence ((—1)")has subsequences that converge to -1, other subsequences that converge to +1, and it has subsequences that diverge.
Let X be a sequence of real numbers and let X' be a subsequence of X.
Then X' is a sequence in its own right, and so it has subsequences.
We note that if X" is a subsequence of X',then it is also a subsequence of X.
5.0 SUMMARY 3.4.9 Theorem LetX = (x ) be a bounded sequence of real numbers and letx ˛ n Rhavethe property that every convergent subsequence ofX converges to x.
Then the sequence X converges to x.
Proof.
Suppose M > 0 is a bound for the sequence X so that |x \ M for all n ˛ N. If X does n (cid:16) not converge to x, then Theorem 3.4.4 implies that there exist > 0 and a subsequence X' = 0 (x ) of X such that n k (1) |x – x| for all k˛ N n ≥ 0 k Since X' is a subsequence of X, the number M is also a bound for X'.
Hence the Bolzano- Weierstrass Theorem implies that X' has a convergent subsequence X".
Since X" is also a subsequence of X, it converges to x by hypothesis.
Thus, itsterms ultimately belong to the 0-neighborhood of x, contradicting (1).

7.0 REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS Unit 5 The Cauchy Criterion 1.0 INTRODUCTION The Monotone Convergence Theorem is extraordinarily useful and important, but it has the significant drawback that it applies only to sequences that are monotone.
It is important for us to have a condition implying the convergence of a sequence that does not require us to know the value of the limit in advance, and is not restricted to monotone sequences.
The Cauchy Criterion, which will be established in this section, is such a condition.
2.0 OBJECTIVES Introduction to Real Analysis 92 At the end of the Unit, readers should be able to (i) know the usefulness of the Monotone Convergence Theorem (ii) understand the Cauchy Criterion and its conditionality.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.5.1 Definition A sequence X = (x ) of real numbers is said to be a Cauchy sequence n if for every > 0 there exists a natural number H( ) such that for all natural numbers n, m H( ),the terms x .x satisfy|x — x |< .
≥ n m n m The significance of the concept of Cauchy sequence lies in the main theorem of this section, which asserts that a sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
This will give us a method of proving a sequence converges without knowing the limit of the sequence.
However, we will first highlight the definition of Cauchy sequence in the following examples.
3.5.2 Examples (a) The sequence (1/n)is a Cauchy sequence.
If >0 is given, we choose a natural number H = H( )such that H >2/ .
Then if m, n H, ≥ we have 1/n 1/H< /2 and similarly 1/m< /2.Therefore, it follows that if m, H H, then (cid:16) ≥ 1 1 1 1 n - m (cid:16) n + m + 2 < 2 = Since > 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that (1/n)is a Cauchy sequence.
(b) The sequence (1 + ( — 1)n) is not a Cauchy sequence.
The negation of the definition of Cauchy sequence is: There exists >0 such that for 0 every H there existat leastone n > H and at least one m > H such that |x — x \ .
n m ≥ 0 For theterms x := 1+ ( — 1)n,we observe that if n is even, then x — 2and x = 0, If we take n n n+l = 2, then for any H we can choose an even number n > H and let m :.= n + 1to get 0 |x – x | = 2 = n n+1 0 We conclude that (x )is not a Cauchy sequence.
□ n Remark We emphasize thatto prove a sequence (x )is a Cauchy sequence, we may n not assume a relationship between m and n, since the required inequality \x — x \ < must n m hold foralln, m H( ).But to prove a sequence is not a Cauchy sequence, we may specify a ≥ relation between n and m as long as arbitrarily large values of n and m can be chosen so that |x — x | .
n m ≥ 0 Our goal is to show that the Cauchy sequences are precisely the convergent sequences.
We first prove that a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
3.5.3Lemma If X — (x ) is a convergent sequence of real numbers, then X is a Cauchy n sequence.
Proof.
If x :=limX, then given > 0 there is a natural number K( /2) such that if n ≥ K( /2) then |x -x |< /2.
Thus, if H( ) := K( /2) and if n, m H( ),then we have n m 0 ≥ |x – x | = |(x – x) + (x – x )| n m n m |x – x| + |(x – x) + |x – x < | /2 + /2 = (cid:16) n n m Introduction to Real Analysis 93 Since > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that (xn) is a Cauchy sequence.
Q.E.D In order to establish that a Cauchy sequence is convergent, we will need the following result.
(See Theorem 3.2.2.)
3.5.4 Lemma A Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded.
Proof: Let X := (x ) be a Cauchy sequence and let := 1.
If H := H(1) and n H, then |x – n ≥ n x | < 1.
Hence, by the Triangle Inequality, we have |x | |x | + 1 for all n H. If we set H n (cid:16) H ≥ M := sup{|x |, |x |, |x |, |x | + 1}, 1 2 ⋯ H-1 H then it follows that |xn| M for all n ˛ N. Q.E.D (cid:16) We now present the important Cauchy Convergence Criterion.
4.0 CONCLUSION 3.5.5 Cauchy Convergence Criterion A sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof: We have seen, in Lemma 3.5.3, that a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
Conversely, let X = (x ) be a Cauchy sequence, we will show that X is convergent to n some real number.
First we observe from Lemma 3.5.4 that sequence X is bounded.
Therefore, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 3.4.8, there is a subsequence X′ = (x ) of X that converges to nk some real number x*.
We shall complete the proof by showing that X converges to x*.
Since X= (x ) is a Cauchy sequence, given > 0 there is a natural number H( /2) such n that if n, m H( /2) then ≥ (1) |x – x | < /2 n m Since the subsequence X′ = (x ) converges to x*, there is a natural number K H ( /2) nk ≥ belonging to the set {n , n , } such that 1 2 ⋯ |x – x*| < /2.
k Since K H( /2), it follows from (1) with m = K that ≥ |x – x | < /2 for n H ( /2) n k ≥ Therefore, if n H( /2), we have ≥ |x –x*| = |(x - x ) + (x – x*)| n n K K |x – x | + |x – x*| (cid:16) n K K < /2 + /2 = Since > 0 is arbitrary, we infer that lim(x ) = x*.
Therefore the sequence X is convergent.
n Q.E.D.
We will now give some examples of applications of the Cauchy Criterion.
3.5.6 Examples (a) Let X = (x ) be defined by n x := 1, x := 2, and x := ½ (x + x ) for n >2.
1 2 n n-2 n-1 Introduction to Real Analysis 94 Can be shown by Induction that 1 x 2 for all ˛ N. (Do So.)
Some calculation shows that (cid:16) n(cid:16) the sequence X is not monotone.
However, since the terms are formed by averaging, it readily seen that 1 |xn – xn+1| = 2n -1 for n ˛ N Prove this by Induction.)
Thus, if m > n, we may employ the Triangle Inequality to obtain |x – x | |x - x | + |x – x | + + |x – x | n m (cid:16) n n+1 n+1 n+2 m-1 m 1 1 1 = + + + 2n-1 2n 2m-2 1 1 1 1 = 1 + + + < 2n-1 2 2m-n-1 2n-2 Therefore, given > 0, if n is chosen so large that 1/2n< /4and if m n, then it follows ≥ that\x - x \< .
Therefore, X is a Cauchy sequence in R. By the Cauchy Criterion 3.5.5 we n m infer that the sequence X converges to a number x.
To evaluate the limit x, we might first "pass to the limit" in the rule of definition = ½ (x + x ) to conclude that x must satisfy the relation x =½(x+ x),which is true, but not n-1 n-2 informative.
Hence we must try something else.
Since X converges to x, so does the subsequence X' with odd indices.
By Induction, we reader can establish that [see 1.2.4(f)] 1 1 1 x = 1 + + + + 2n+1 2 23 22n-1 2 1 = 1 + 1 - 3 4n It follows from this (how?)
that x = lim X = lim X’ = 1 + 2/ = 5/ 3 3 (b) Let Y = (y ) be the sequence of real numbers given by n 1 1 1 1 1 (-1)n+1 y := , y := -, ,y := - + + , 1 1!
2 1!
⋯2!
n 1⋯!

⋯ n!
Clearly, Y is not a monotone sequence.
However, if m > n, then (-1)n+2 (-1)n+3 (-1)m+1 y y = + + + m - n (n+1)!
(n+2)!
⋯ m!
Since 2r-1 r!
[see 1.2.4(e)], it follows that if m > n, then (why?)

(n+2)!
m!
1 1 1 1 + + +< (cid:16) 2n 2n+1 ⋯ 2m-1 2n-1 Therefore, it follows that (y ) is a Cauchy sequence.
Hence it converges to a limit y.
At the n present moment we cannot evaluate y directly; however, passing to the limit (with respect to m) in the above inequality, we obtain.
|yn – y| 1/2n-1 (cid:16) Hence we can calculate y to any desired accuracy by calculating the terms y for sufficiently n Introduction to Real Analysis 95 large n. The reader should do this and show that y is approximately equal to 0.632120559.
( The exact value of y is 1 – 1/e.)
1 1 1 (c) The sequence + + + diverges 1 2 ⋯ n Let H := (h ) be the sequence defined by n 1 1 1 h := + + + for n ˛ N, n 1 2 ⋯ n which was considered in 3.3.3(b).
If m > n, then 1 1 h = h = + + m n n-1 ⋯ m Since each of these m — n terms exceeds 1/m,then h — h > (m — n)/m = 1 — n/m.In m n particular, if m = 2n we have h — h >½.
This shows that His not a Cauchy sequence 2n n (why?
); therefore H is not a convergent sequence.
(In terms that will be introduced in Unit 3.7, we have justproved that the "harmonic series" ∑(cid:2) 1/nis divergent.)
(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) □ 3.5.7 Definition We say that a sequence X = (x ) of real numbers is contractive If there n existsa constant C, 0 <C <1, such that |x – x | C|x – x| n+2 n+1 (cid:16) n+1 n for all n ˛ N. The number C is called the constant of the contractive sequence.
3.5.8 Theorem Every contractive sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and therefore is convergent.
Proof.
If we successively apply the defining condition for a contractive sequence, we can work our way back to the beginning of the sequence as follows: |x – x | C|x – x| C2|x – x | n+2 n+1 (cid:16) n+1 n (cid:16) n n-1 C3|x – x | Cn|x – x| (cid:16) n-1 n-2 (cid:16) ⋯ (cid:16) 2 1 For m >n, we estimate \x — x \ by first applying the Triangle Inequality and then using the m n formula for the sum of a geometric progression (see 1.2.4(f)) This gives |x – x| |x – x | + |x – x |+ + |x – x | m n (cid:16) m m-1 m-1 m-2 ⋯ n+1 n (Cm-2 + Cm-3+ + Cn-1) |x – x| (cid:16) ⋯ 2 1 1- Cm-n = Cn-1| x – x| 2 1 1- C 1 Cn-1 | x – x|.
(cid:16) 1 - C 2 1 Introduction to Real Analysis 96 Since 0 <C< 1, we know lim(Cn)= 0 [see 3.1.11(b)].Therefore, we infer that (x ) is aCauchy n sequence.
It now follows from the Cauchy Convergence Criterion 3.5.5. that (x )is a convergent n sequence.
Q.E.D.
5.0 SUMMARY In the process of calculating the limit of a contractive sequence, it is often very important to have an estimate of the error at the nth stage.
In the next result we give two such estimates: the first one involves the first two terms in the sequence and n; the second one involves the difference x — x n n-1 3.5.9 Corollary IfX := (x ) is a contractive sequence with constantC, 0 <C< 1, and if x*:= n lim X, then Cn-1 (i) |x* - x | |x – x| n (cid:16) 2 1 -1 C C (ii) |x* - x| | x – x |.
n (cid:16) 1 - C n n-1 Proof.From the preceding proof, if m > n, then \x - x | (Cn-1/(1— C))\x –x |.
m n (cid:16) 2 1 If we let m in this inequality, we obtain (i).
→ ∞ To prove (ii), recall that if m >n, then |x – x| |x – x | + + |x – x | m n (cid:16) m m-1 ⋯ n+1 n Since it is readily established, using Induction, that |x – x | Ck|x– x | n+k n+k-1 (cid:16) n n-1 we infer that |x – x| (Cm-n+ + C2 + C|x – x | m n (cid:16) ⋯ n n-1 C | x – x |.
(cid:16) 1 - C n n-1 We now let m in this inequality to obtain assertion (ii).
Q.E.D → ∞ 3.5.10 Example We are told that the cubic equation x3 — 7x + 2 = 0 has a solution between 0 and 1 and we wish to approximate this solution.
This can be accomplished by means of an iteration procedure as follows.
We first rewrite the equation as x = (x3+ 2)/7 and use this to define a sequence.
We assign to x an arbitrary value between 0 and 1, and then define 1 x := 1/ (x3 + 2) for n N n+1 7 n (cid:28) Because 0 <x < 1, it follows that 0 < x <1 for all n N.
(Why?)
Moreover, we have 1 n (cid:28) x – x |= 1/ (x3 + 2) – 1/ (x3 + 2)| = 1/ |x3 – x3 | n+2 n+1 7 n+1 7 n 7 n+1 n = 1/ |x2 + x x + x2 ||x –x | 3/ |x – x|.
7 n+1 n+1 n n n+1 n (cid:16) 7 n+1 n Therefore, (x) is a contractive sequence and hence there exists r such that lim(x) =r .
If we pass to the limit n n on both sides of the equality x = (x3 + 2)/7, we obtain r = (r3 + 2)/7 and hence r3-7r + 2 = 0.
Thus r n+l n is a solution of the equation.
We can approximate r by choosing x1, and calculatingx2,x3,⋯successively.
For example, if we take x= 0.5, we obtain (to nine decimal places): l x = 0.303571429, x = 0.289710830, 2 3 Introduction to Real Analysis 97 x=0,289188016, x = 0.289 169244, 4 5 x = 0.289168571, etc.
6 To estimate the accuracy, we note that \x–x|<0.2.
Thus, after n steps it follows from Corollary 3.5.9(i) 2 1 that we are sure that |x* - x \ 3n-1/(7n-2 20).
Thus, when n = 6, we are sure that n (cid:16) ∙ |x* - x 35/(74 20) = 243/48020 < 0.0051.
6(cid:16) ∙ Actually the approximation is substantially better than this.
In fact, since |x — x \ < 6 5 0.0000005, it follows from 3.5.9(ii) that \x*- x | ¾ |x - x | < 0.0000004.
Hence the 6 (cid:16) 6 5 first five decimal places of xare correct.

n n +∞ 7.0 REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS Unit 7 Introduction to Infinite Series Introduction to Real Analysis 101 1.0 INTRODUCTION We will now give a brief introduction to infinite series of real numbers.
We will establish a few results here.
These results will be seen to be immediate consequences of theorems we have met in thisModule.
MAIN CONTENT In elementary texts, an infinite series is sometimes "defined" to be "an expression of the form" (1)x + x + + x + .
1 2 ⋯ n ⋯ However, this"definition" lacks clarity, sincethere is a priori no particular value that we can attach to this array of symbols, which calls for an infinite number of additions to be performed.
3.7.1 Definition If X := (x )is a sequence in R, then the infinite series (orsimply the n series) generated by X is thesequence S := (s )defined by k s := x 1 1 s := s + x (= x + x ) 2 1 2 1 2 ⋯ s := s + x (= x + x + + x ) k k-1 k 1 2 ⋯ k The numbers x are called the terms of the series and the numbers s. are called the partial n sums of thisseries.
If limS exists, we say that thisseries is convergent and call this limit the sum or the value of thisseries.
If this limit does not exist, we say that the series S is divergent.
It is convenient to use symbols such as ∞ (2) (x ) or x or x ∑ n ∑ n ∑ n n=1 to denote both the infinite series S generated by the sequence X = (x ) and also to denote the n value lim S, in case this limit exists.
Thus the symbols in (2) may be regarded merely as a way of exhibiting an infinite series whose convergence or divergence is to be investigated.
In practice, this double use of these notations does not lead to any confusion, provided it is understood that the convergence (or divergence) of the series must be established.
Just as a sequence may be indexed such that its first element is not x ,but is x , or x 1 0 5 or x , we will denote the series having these numbers as their first element by the symbols 99 ∞ ∞ ∞ x or x or x ∑ n ∑ n ∑ n n=0 n=5 n=99 It should be noted that when the first term in the series is x ,then the first partial sum is N denoted by s .
N Warning The reader should guard against confusing the words "sequence" and "series".
In nonmathematical language, these words are interchangeable; however, in mathematics, these words are not synonyms.
Indeed, a series is a sequence S = (s ) obtained from a given sequence k X = (x ) according to the special procedure given in Definition 3.7.1. n ∞ Introduction to Real Analysis 102 3.7.2 Examples (a) Consider the sequence X := (rn) where r ˛ R, which generates n=0 the geometric series: ∞ (3) rn = 1 + r + r2 + + rn + ∑ ⋯ ⋯ n=0 We will show that if |r| < 1, then this series converges to 1/(1-r).
(See also Example 1.2.4(f).)
Indeed, if s := 1 + r + r2for n 0, and if we multiply s by r and subtract the result n ≥ n from s , we obtain (after some simplification): n s (1 – r) = 1 – rn+1 n Therefore, we have s - 1 = - rn+1 n 1-r 1-r from which it follows that 1 |r|n+1 |s - | n 1-r (cid:16) 1-r Since |r|n+1 0 where |r| < 1, it follows that the geometric series (3) converges to 1/(1 - r) → when |r| < 1.
(b) Consider the series generated by ((-1)n)∞ that is, the series: n=0 ∞ (4) (-1)n = (+1) + (-1) + (+1) + (-1)+ ∑ ⋯ n=0 It is easily seen (by Mathematical Induction) that s – 1 if n 0 is even and sn = 0 if n is n ≥ odd; therefore, the sequence of partial sums is (1,0,1,0, ).
Since this sequence is not ⋯ convergent, the series (4) is divergent.
(c) Consider the series.
∞ 1 1 1 1 (5) = + + + ∑ n(n+1) 1.2 2.3⋯ .3.4 n=1 By a stroke of insight, we note that 1 1 1 = - .
k(k+1) k k+1 Hence, on adding these terms from k = 1 to k = n and noting the telescoping that takes place, we obtain 1 1 s = - n 1 n+1 Whence it follows that s 1.
Therefore the series (5) converges to 1. n→ We now present a very useful and simple necessary condition for the convergence of a series.
It is far from being sufficient, however.
3.7.3The nth Term Test If the series x converges, then lim(x ) = 0.
∑ n n Introduction to Real Analysis 103 Proof.
By Definition 3.7.1, the convergence of x requires that lim(s ) exists.
Sincex = ∑ n k n sn — sn-1,then lim(xn) = lim(sn) — lim(sn-1)= 0.

Since the following Cauchy Criterion is precisely a reformulation of Theorem 3.5.5, we will omit its proof.
3.7.4Cauchy Criterion for Series The series x converges if and only if for every > 0 ∑ n there exists M( ) ˛ N such that ifm > n M( ), then ≥ (6) |s — s | = \x + x + + x |< … m n n+l n+2 ⋯ m The next result, although limited in scope, is of great importance and utility.
3.7.5Theorem Let (x ) be a sequence of nonnegative real numbers.
Then the series n x converges if and only if the sequence S = (s ) of partial .sums is bounded.
In thiscase, ∑ n k ∞ x = lim(s ) = sup{s : k˛ N} ∑ n k k n=1 Proof.Since x >0, the sequence S of partial sums is monotone increasing: n s s s .
1(cid:16) 2(cid:16) ⋯ (cid:16) k(cid:16) ⋯ By the Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2, the sequence S = (s ) converges if andonly if it k is bounded, in which case itslimit equals sup{sk} Q.E.D.
3.7.6Examples (a) The geometric series (3) diverges if |r| 1.
≥ This follows from the fact that the terms rndo not approach 0 when |r| 1.
≥ ∞ 1 (b) The harmonic series x = diverges ∑ n n=1 n Since the terms 1/n 0, we cannot use the nth Term Test 3.7.3 to establishthis → divergence.
However, it was seen in Examples 3.3.3(b) and 3.5.6(c) that the sequence (s ) of n partial sums is not bounded.
Therefore, it follows from Theorem 3.7.5 that the harmonic series is divergent.
(c) The 2-series ∞ x1i s convergent.
∑ n n=1 n2 Since the partial sums are monotone, it suffices (why?)
to show that some subsequence of (s )is bounded.
If k :=21 - 1 = l, thens = l.Ifk := 22 - 1 = 3, then k l k1 2 1 1 1 2 1 s = + < 1 + = 1 + k2 1 22 32 22 2 and if k := 23 – 1 = 7, then we have 3 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 s = s + + + + <sk2 + < 1 + + k3 k2 42 52 62 72 42 2 22 By Mathematical Induction, we find that if k := 2 – 1, then j j Introduction to Real Analysis 104 0 <s < 1 + ½ + (½)2 + + (½)j-1 kj ⋯ Since the term on the right is a partial sum of a geometric series with r = ½ , it is dominated by 1/(I— ½) = 2, and Theorem 3.7.5 implies mat the 2-series converges.
∞ 1 (d) The p-series converges when p> 1.
∑ np n=1 Since the argument is very similar to the special case considered in part (c), we will leave some of the details to the reader.
As before, if k := 21 — 1 = 1, then s = 1.
If 1 k1 K := 22 - 1 = 3, then since 2P<3P, we have 2 1 1 1 2 1 s = ++< 1 + = 1 + k2 1p 2p 3p 2p 2p-1 Further, if k := 23 - 1, then (how?)
it is seen that 3 4 1 1 s <s + < 1 + + k3 k2 4p 2p-1 4p-1 Finally, we let r := 1/2P-1; since p > 1, we have 0 <r< 1.
Using Mathematical Induction, we show that if k:= 2j — 1, then j 1 0 <s < 1 + r + r2 + + rj-1 < kj ⋯ 1-r Therefore, Theorem 3.7.5 implies that the p-series converges when p > 1.
∞ 1 (e) The p-series diverges when 0 < p 1.
∑ np (cid:16) n=1 We willuse the elementary inequality np n when n˛ N and 0 <p < 1.
It follows (cid:16) that 1 1 (cid:16) n for n˛npN Since the partial sums of the harmonic series are not bounded, this inequality shows that the partial sums of thep-series are not bounded when 0 <p 1.
Hence the p-series diverges for these values (cid:16) of p. (f) The alternating harmonic series, given by (7) ∞ (=-1-)+n-+1 + 1 1 + 1 (-1)n+1 n∑=1 n ⋯ 1 2 ⋯3 n is convergent.
The reader should compare this series with the harmonic series in (b), which is divergent.
Thus, the subtraction of some of the terms in (7) is essential if this series is to converge.
Since we have 1 1 1 1 1 1 s = -+- + +- 2n 1 2 3⋯ 4 2n-1 2n Introduction to Real Analysis 105 it is clear that the "even" subsequence (s ) is increasing.
Similarly, the "odd" subsequence (s ) 2n 2n+1 is decreasing since 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 s = - - --- - - 2n+1 1 2 3 ⋯4 5 2n 2n+1 Since 0 <s <s + l/(2n+ 1) = s 1, both of these subsequences are bounded below by 0 and 2n 2n 2n+1(cid:16) above by 1.
Therefore they are both convergent and to the same value.
Thusthe sequence (s )of n partial sums converges, proving that the alternating harmonic series(7) converges.
(It is far from obvious that the limit of this series is equal to In 2.)
□ 4.0 CONCLUSION Comparison Tests Our first testshows that if the terms of a nonnegative series are dominated by the corresponding terms of a convergent series, then the first series is convergent.

5.0 SUMMARY Remark The Comparison Tests 3.7.7 and 3.7.8 depend on having a stock of series that one knows to be convergent (or divergent).
The reader will find that the p-series is often useful for this purpose.
∞ 1 3.7.9 Examples (a) The series converges.
n∑=1 n2 + n It is clear that the inequality 1 1 0 <<n 2 +fo nr n ˛ N n2 is valid.
Since the series 1/n2 is convergent (by Example 3.7.6(c)), we can apply the ∑ Comparison Test 3.7.7 to obtain the convergence of the given series.
1 ∞ (b) The series is convergent.
n∑=1 n2 – n + 1 If the inequality 1 1 (10) n(cid:16)2 – n + 1 n2 were true, we could argue as in (a).
However, (10) is false for all n ˛ N. The reader can probably show that the inequality 1 1 0 < (cid:16)n2 – n + 1 n2 Is valid for all n ˛ N, and this equality will work just as well.
However, it might take some experimentation to think of such an inequality and then establish it.
Instead, if we take x := 1/(n2 – n + 1) and y := 1/n2, then we have n n x n2 1 n = = 1. y n2 – n + 1 1 – (1/n) + (1/n2) → n Therefore, the convergence of the given series follows from the Limit Comparison Test 3.7.8(a).
1 ∞ (c) The series is divergent.
∑ n=1 (cid:19)(cid:26) +1 This series closely resembles the series 1/ which is a p-series with p = ½ ; by ∑ √n Example 3.7.6(e), it is divergent.
If we let x := 1/ and y := 1/ , then we have n √ (cid:26)+1 n √(cid:26) x 1 n = √ (cid:26) = 1. yn √ (cid:26)+1 (cid:19)1+1/(cid:26) → Introduction to Real Analysis 107 Therefore the Limit Comparison Test 3.7.8(a) applies.
∞ 1 (d) The series is convergent.
n∑=1 n!
It would be possible to establish this convergence by showing (by Induction) that n2<n!
for n 4, whence it follows that ≥ 1 1 0 << for n 4. n!
n2≥ Alternative, if we let x := 1/n!
and y := 1/n2, then (when n 4) we have n ≥ x n2 n 1 0 n = = < 0.
(cid:16) y n!
1.2 (n-1) →n-2 n ⋯ Therefore the Limit Comparison Test 3.7.8(b) applies.
(Note that this test was a bit troublesome to apply since we do not presently know the convergence of any series for which the limit of x /y is really easy to determine.)

In the preceding chapter we studied one of these basic limiting concepts: the limit of a sequence of real numbers.
In this chapter we will encounter the notion of the limit of a function.
The rudimentary notion of a limiting process emerges in the 1680s as Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) struggled with the creation of the Calculus.
Though each person’s work was initially unknown to the other and their creative insights were quite different, both realized the need to formulate a notion of function and the idea of quantities being “close to” one another.
Newton used the word “fluent” to denote a relationshipbetween variables, and in his major work Principia in 1687 he discussed limits “to which they approach nearer than by any given difference, but never go beyond, nor in effect attain to, till the quantities are diminished infinitum”.
Leibniz introduced the term “function” to indicate a quantity that depended on a variable, and he invented “infinitesimally small” numbers as a way of handling the concept of a limit.The term “function” soon became standard technology, and Leibniz also introduced the term “calculus” for this new method of calculation.
In 1748, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) published his two-volume treatise Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, in which he discussed power series, the exponential and logarithmic functions, Calculi Differentalis in 1755 and the three-volume Institutiones Calculi Integralis in 1780-70.
These works remained the standard textbooks on calculus for many years.
But the concept of limit was very intuitive and its looseness led to a number of problems.
Verbal descriptions of the limit concept were proposed by other mathematicians of the era, but none was adequate to provide the basis for rigorous proofs.
In 1821, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) published his lecture on analysis in his Cours d’Analyse, which set standard for mathematical exposition for many years.
He was concerned with rigor and in many ways raised the level of precision in mathematical discourse.
He formulate definitions and presented arguments with greater than his predecessor, but the concept of limit still remained elusive.
In an early chapter he gave the following definition: If the successive values attributed to the same variable approach indefinitely a fixed value, such that they finally differ from it by as little as one wishes, this latter is called the limit of all the others.
The final steps in formulating a precise definition of limit were taken by Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897).
He insisted on precise language and rigorous proofs, and his definition of limit is the one we use today.
Introduction to Real Analysis 110 Gottfried Leibniz Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) was born in Leipzig, Germany.
He was six years old when his father, a professor of philosophy, died and left his son the key to his library and a life of books and learning.
Leibniz entered the University of Leipzig at age 15, graduate at age 17, and received a Doctor of law degree from the University of Altdorf four years later.
He wrote on legal matters, but was more interested in philosophy.
He also developed original theories about language and the nature of the universe.
In 1672, he went to Paris as a diplomat for four years.
While there he began to study mathematics with the Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens.
His travels to London to visit the Royal Academy further stimulated his interest in mathematics.
His background in philosophy led him to very original, though not always rigorous, results.
Unaware of Newton’s unpublished work, Leibniz published papers in the 1680s that presented a method of finding areas that is known today as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
He coined the term “calculus” and invented the dy/dx and elongated S notations that are used today.
Unfortunately, some followers of Newton accused Leibniz of plagiarism, resulting in a dispute that lasted until Leibniz’s death.
Their approaches to calculus were quite different and it is now evident that their discoveries were made independently.
Leibniz is now renowned for his work in philosophy, but his mathematical fame rests on his creation of the calculus.
Unit 1 Limits of Functions 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this section we will introduced the important notion of the limit of a function.
The intuitive idea of the function f having a limit L at the point c is that the values f (x) are close to L when xis close to (but different from) c. But it is necessary to have a technical way of working with the idea of “close to” and this is accomplished in the in the ε-δ definition given below.
In order for the idea of the limit of a function f at a point c to be meaningful, It is necessary that f be defined at points near c. It need not be defined at the point c, but it should be defined at enough point s close to cmake the study interesting.
This is the reason for the following definition.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, readers should be able to:- (i) Understand the limit of a function.
(ii) Understand sequential criterion for limits.
(iii) Understand Divergence Criteria with examples.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT Introduction to Real Analysis 111 4.1.1Definition Let A⊆R.
A point c ˛ Ris a cluster pointof Aif for every δ > 0 there exists at least one point x˛ A, x ≠ c such that │x – c│ < δ.
This definition is rephrase in the language of neighborhoods as follows: A point c is a cluster point of the set A if every δ-neighborhood V (c) = (c – δ, c + δ) of a c contains at least δ one point of A distinct from c. Note: The point c may or may not be a member of A, but even it is in A, it is ignored when deciding whether it is a cluster point of A or not, since we explicitly require that there be points in V (c) ∩ A distinct from c in order for c to be a cluster point A. δ For example, if A := {1, 2}, then the point 1 is not a cluster point of A, since choosing δ := 1/ gives a neighborhood of 1 that contains no points of A distinct from 1.
The same is true for 2 the point 2, so we see that A has no cluster points.
4.1.2 Theorem A number c˛ R is a cluster point of a subset A of R if and only if there exists a sequence (a ) in A such that lim(a )= c and a c for all n˛ N. n n n≠ Proof.
If c is a cluster point of A, then for any n˛ N the (1/n)- neighborhood V (c) contains 1/n at least one point a in A distinct from c. Then a ˛ A,a c, and │a – c│ < 1/nimplies lim(a ) n n n ≠ n n = c. Conversely, if there exists a sequence (a ) in A \{c} with lim(a ) = c, then for any δ > 0 n n there exists Ksuch that if n ≥ K, than a є V (c).Therefore the δ-neighborhood V (c) of c n δ δ contains the points an, for n ≥ K, which belong to A and are distinct from c. Q.E.D.
The next examples emphasize that a cluster point of a set may or may not belong to the set.
4.1.3 Examples (a) For the open interval A := (0, 1), every point of the closed 1 interval [0, 1] is a cluster point of A .
Note that the points 0, 1 are cluster points of A , but do 1 1 not belong to A .
All the points of A are cluster points of A .
1 1 1 (b) A finite set has no cluster points.
(c) The infinite set N has no cluster points.
(d) The set A := {1/n : n˛ N} has only the point 0 as a cluster point.
None of the points in 4 A is a cluster point of A .
4 4 (e) If I :=[0, 1], then the set A := I ∩ Q consists of all the rational numbers in I.
It follows 5 from the Density Theorem 2.4.8 that every point in 1 is a cluster point of A .
 5 Having made this brief detour, we now return to the concept of the concept of the limit of a function at a cluster point of its domain.
The Definition of the Limit We now state the precise definition of the limit of a function f at a point c. it is important to note that in this definition, it is immaterial whether f is defined at c or not.
In any case, we exclude c from consideration in the determination of the limit.
Introduction to Real Analysis 112 4.1.4 Definition Let A⊆⊆⊆⊆R, and let c be a cluster point of A. for a function f : A → R, a real number L is said to be a limit of f atc if, given any ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that if x ˛ A and 0 < │x – c│ <δ, then │ f(x) – L │ <ε.
Remarks (a) Since the value of δ usually depends on ε, we will sometimes write δ (ε) instead of δ to emphasize this dependence.
(b) The inequality 0 < │x - c│is equivalent to saying x c. ≠ If L is a limit of f at c, then we also say thatf converges toL atc.
We often write L = lim f (x) or L = lim f. x→c x→c We also say that “f (x) approaches L as x approaches c”.
(But it should be noted that the points do not actually move anywhere.)
The symbolism f (x) → L as x → c is also used sometimes to express the fact that f has limit L at c. If the limit of f at c does not exist, we say that f diverges at c. Our first result is that the value L of the limit is uniquely determined.
This uniqueness is not part of the definition of limit, but must be deduced.
4.1.5 Theorem If f : A → R and if c is a cluster point of A, then f can have only one limit at c. Proof.
Suppose that numbers L and L1satisfy4.1.4 For any ε > 0, there exists δ (ε/2) > 0 such that if x є A and 0 < │ x – c │ <δ (ε/2), then │(x) –L │ <ε/2.
Also there exists δ1 (ε/2) such that if xє A and 0 < │ x – c │ <δ1 (ε/2), then │ f (x) –L1│ <ε/2.
Now let δ := inf {δ (ε/2), δ1 (ε/2)}.
Then if x є A and 0 < │ x – c │ <δ, the Triangle Inequality implies that │ L – L’ │ ≤ │ L –f (x)│ + │ f(x) – L’│ > ε/2 + ε/2 = ε.
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that L – L’ = 0, so that L = L’.
Q.E.D.
The definition of limit can be very nicely described in terms of neighborhoods.
(See Figure 4.1.1.)
We observe that because V (c) = (c – δ, c + δ){x : │x –c│<δ}, δ The inequality 0 < │x – c│ < δ is equivalent to saying that x ≠ c and x belong to the δ- neighborhood V (c) of c. Similarly, the inequality │ f (x) - L │ < ε is equivalent to saying δ that f (x) belongs to the ε-neighborhood V (L) of L. In this way, we obtain the following ε result.
The reader should write out a detailed argument to establish the theorem.
Introduction to Real Analysis 113 Figure 4.1.1 The limit of f at c is L. 4.1.6 Theorem Let f A → R and let c be a cluster point of A.
Then the following statements are equivalent.
(i) lim f (x) = L. x→c (ii) Given any ε-neighborhood V (L) of L, there exists a δ-neighborhood V (c) of c such ε δ that if x ≠ c is any point in V (c) ∩ A, then f (x) belongs V (L).
δ ε We now give some examples that illustrate how the definition of limit is applied.
4.1.7 Examples (a) limb = b x→c To be more explicit, let f (x) := b for all x є R. We want to show that lim f (x) = b. x → c If ε > 0 is given, we let δ := 1.
(in fact, any strictly positive δ will serve the purpose.)
Then if 0 < │ x – c │ <1, we have │ f (x) – b │ b - b │ = 0 < ε.
Since ε > is arbitrary, we conclude from Definition 4.1.4 that lim f (x) = b. x → c (b) limx = c. x→c Let g(x) := x for all x ˛ R. If ε> 0, we choose δ (ε) := ε.
Then if 0 < │ x – c │ < δ (ε), we have │ g (x) – c │ = │ x – c │ < ε.
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, we deduce that limg = c. x→c (c) limx2 = c2.
x→c Let h (x) := x2for all x˛ R. We have to make the deference │h (x) – c2 │ = │ x2– c2│ Less than a perassigned ε > 0 by taking x sufficiently close to c. To do so, we note that x2 – c2 = (x + c) (x - c).
Moreover, if │ x – c │ <1, then │x│ ≤ │c│ +1 so that │x + c│ ≤ │x│ + │c│ ≤ 2 │c│ +1.
Therefore, if │x - c│ <1, we have (1) │x2- c2│ = │x +c│ │x - c│ ≤ (2 │c│ +1) │x2- c2│.
Moreover this last term will be less than ε provided we take │x - c│ < ε / (2 │c│ +1).
Consequently, if we choose Introduction to Real Analysis 114 δ (ε) := inf 1, V (cid:15) │X│Y(cid:5) then if 0 < │ x – c │ <δ(ε), it will follow first that │x – c│ <1 so that (1) is valid, and therefore, since │ x – c │ < ε/(2│c│ + 1) that │ x2 – c2 │ ≤ (2│c│ + 1) │ x – c │ < ε.
Since w have a way of choosing δ (ε) > 0 for an arbitrary choice of ε > 0, we infer that lim h(x) = lim x2 = c2.
x → c x → c 1 1 (d) lim = if c> 0. x c x → c Let φ(x) := 1/x for x > 0 and let c > 0.
To show that lim φ= 1/cwe wish to make the difference x → c 1 1 1 (x) - = - (cid:31) c x c less than a preassigned ε > 0 by taking x sufficiently close to c > 0.
We first note that 1 1 1 1 - = (c – x) |x – c| x c cx cx for x > 0.
It is useful to get an upper bound for the term 1/(cx) that holds in some neighborhood of c. In particular, if │x – c│ <1/ c, then ½c<x <3/ c (why?
), so that 2 2 1 1 0 < < for │x - c│ <½c cx c2 .
Therefore, for these values of x we have 1 2 (2) (x) - |x - c|< (cid:31) c (cid:16) c2 In order to make this last term than ε it suffices to take│x – c│<(cid:5) c2 ε. Consequently, if we (cid:15) choose δ (ε) := inf { 1/ c, 1/ c2 } 2 2 then if 0 <│x - c│ <δ (ε), it will follow first that │x - c│ <Z so that (2) is valid, and therefore, \ since │x - c│ <(Zc2) ε, that [ [ 1 1 1 Introduction to Real Analysis 115 φ (x) – = - < ε. c x c Since we have a way of choosing δ (ε) > 0 for an arbitrary choice of ε > 0, we infer that lim x → c φ = 1 /c.
(e) lim x3 – 4 4 x→ 2x2+ 1 5 Let ψ(x) := (x3 - 4) / (x2 + 1) for x є R. Then a little algebraic manipulation gives us Ψ(x) - ] = │^_`a ]_[a (cid:15)]│ ^ ^(_[Y (cid:5)) = │^_[Y b_ Y (cid:5)(cid:15)│ │x – 2 │.

4.0 CONCLUSION Sequential Criterion for Limits The following important formulation of limit of a function is in terms of limits of sequences.
This characterization permits the theory of chapter 3 to be applied to the study of limits of functions.
4.1.8 Theorem(Sequential Criterion) Let f: A → R and let c be a cluster point of A.
Then the following are equivalent.
(i) lim f = L. x → c (ii) For every sequence (x ) in A that converges to c such that x ≠ c for all n є N, the n n sequence (f (x )) converges to L. n Proof.
(i)⇒⇒⇒⇒(i).
Assume f has limit L at c, and suppose (x ) is a sequence in A with lim(x ) = c n n and x ≠ c for all n. We must prove that the sequence (f (x )) converges to L. Let ε > 0 be n n given.
Then by Definition 4.1.4, there exists δ > 0 such that if x є A satisfies 0 < < δ, │ (cid:13)(cid:14)\ │ then f (x) satisfies │ f (x) = L │ <ε.
We now apply the definition of convergent sequence for the given δ to obtain a natural number K (δ) such that if n >K (δ) then < δ.
But for │ (cid:13)(cid:14)\│ each such x we have │ f (x ) – L │ < ε.
This if n >K (δ), then │ f (x ) – L │ < ε.
Therefore, n n n the sequence (f (x )) converges to L. n (ii) ⇒ (i).
[The proof is a contrapositive argument.]
If (i) is not true, then there exists an ε -heighborhood V (L) such that no matter what δ-neighborhood of c we pick, there will be at 0 ε Introduction to Real Analysis 116 least one number x in A ∩ V (c) with x ≠ c such that f (x ) є V (L).
Hence for every n є N, the δ δ δ δ ε0 (1 / n)-neighborhood of c contains a number x such that n 0 < │ x – c │ <1 / n and x єA, n n but such that │ x (x ) – L │ ≥ ε for all n є N. n 0 We conclude that the sequence (x ) in A \{c} converges to c, but the sequence (f (x )) does not n n converge to L. Therefore we have shown that if (i) is not true, then (ii) is not true.
We conclude that (ii) implied (i).
Q.E.D.
We shall in the next unit that many of the basic limit properties of functions can be established by using corresponding properties for convergent sequences.
For example, we know from our work with sequences that if (x ) is any sequence that converges to a number c, n then (x2 ) converges to c2.
Therefore, by the sequential criterion, we can conclude that the n function h (x) :=x2has limit lim h (x) = c2.
x → c 5.0 SUMMARY Divergence Criteria It is often important to be able to show (i) that a certain number is not the limit of a function at a point, or (ii) that the function does not have a limit at a point.
The following result is a consequence of (the proof of) Theorem 4.1.8.
We leave the details of its proof as an important exercise.
4.1.9 Divergence Criteria Let A˝ R, letf :A → R and let c ˛ R be a cluster point of A (a) If L˛ R, then f does not have limit L atc if and only if there exists a sequence (x ) in A n with x ≠ c for all n є N such that the sequence (x ) converges to c but the sequence (f(x )) n n n does not converge to L. (b) The function f does not have a limit at c if and only if there exists a sequence (x ) in A n with x ≠ c for all n є N such that the sequence (x ) converges to c but the sequence (f(x )) n n n does not converge in R. We now give some applications of this result to show how it can be used.
4.1.10 Example (a) lim (1/x) does not exists in R. x → 0 As in Example 4.1.7 (d), let φ(x) :=1/x for x > 0.
However, here we consider c =0.
The argument given Example 4.1.7 (d) break down if c = 0 since we cannot obtain a bound such as that in (2) of that example.
Indeed, if we take the sequence (x ) with x := 1/n for n є n n N, then lim(x ) = 0, but φ(x ) = n. As we know, the sequence (φ(x )) = (n) is not convergent n n n in R, since it is not bounded.
Hence, by Theorem 4.1.9(b), lim(1/x) does not exist in R. x →0 (b) lim sgn(x) does not exist.
x → 0 Let the signum function sgn be defined by +1 for x > 0, Sgn(x) := 0 for x = 0, Introduction to Real Analysis 117 -1 for x < 0.
Note that sgn(x) = x / │x│ for x ≠ 0.
(See Figure 4.1.2.)
We shall show the sgn does not have a limit at x = 0.
We shall do this by showing that there is a sequence (x ) such that lim(x ) = 0, n n but such that (sgn(x )) does not converge.
n 1(‹ • › - 1 Figure 4.1.2 The signum function.
Indeed, let x := (-1)n /n for n є N so that lim(x ) = 0.
However, since n n Sgn(x ) = (-1)n for n є N, n if follows from Example 3.4.6 (a) that (sgn(x )) does not converge.
Therefore lim sgn(x) n x → 0 does not exist.
(c) lim sgn(1/x) does not exist in R. x → 0 Let g(x) := sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0.
(See Figure 4.1.3.)
We shall show that g does not have limit at c = 0, by exhibiting two sequences (x ) (y ) with x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 for all n є N and n n n n such that lim(x ) = 0 and lim(x ) = 0, but such that lim(g(x )) ≠ lim(g(y )).
In view of theorem n n n n 4.1.9 this implies that lim g cannot exist.
(Example why.)
Figure 4.1.3 The function g(x) = sin(1/x) (x ≠ 0).
Indeed, we recall from calculus that sin t= 0 if t = nπ for n є Z, and that sin t = + 1 if t =Zπ [ + 2πn for n ∈Z.
Now let x := 1/nπ for n∈N; then lim(x ) = 0 and g(x ) = sin nπ = 0 for all n n n n ∈N, so that lim(g(xn)) = 0.
On the other hand, Let yn:= (ZI+2I(cid:26))-1 for n ∈N; then lim(yn) = [ Introduction to Real Analysis 118 0 and g(yn) = sin (ZI+2I(cid:26)) = 1 for all n∈N, so that lim(g(yn)) = 1.
We conclude that lim sin(1/x) does not e[xist.
x x → 0 _________ In order to have some interesting applications in this and later examples, we shall make use of well-known properties of trigonometric and exponential that will be established in Module 8.

These results are parallel to the limits theorems established in Unit 3.2 for sequences.
In fact, in most cases these results can be proved by using Theorem 4.1.8 and results from Unit 3.2.
Alternatively, the results in this section can be proved by using ε-δ arguments that are very similar to the ones employed in Unit 3.2.
2.0 OBJECTIVE At the end of the unit, readers should be able to: (i) Understand the concept of f is bounded on a neighborhood.
(ii) Define squeeze Theorem of a Cluster Point.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 4.2.1 Definition Let A ˝ R, let f : A→R, and let c ∈R be a cluster point of A.
We say that f is bounded on a neighborhood of c if there exists a δ-neighborhood V (c) of c and a δ constant M >0 such that we have │ f (x) │ ≤ M for all x є A∩ V (c).
δ 4.2.2 TheoremIf A ˝ R and f : A → R has a limit at c ∈R, then f is bounded on some neighborhood of c. Introduction to Real Analysis 120 Proof.
If L:= lim f, then for ε = 1, there exists δ > 0 such that if 0 < │ x – c │ < δ, then x→ c │ f(x) – L │ 1; hence (by Corollary 2.2.4 (a)), │ f (x) │ - │L│ ≤ │ f(x) – L │ <1.
Therefore, if x є A ∩ V (c), x ≠ c, then │ f(x) │ ≤ │L│ + 1.
If c ˇ A, we take M = │L│ + 1, δ while if c є A we take M := sup {│ f(c) │, │L│ + 1}}.
If follows that if x ∈A ∩ V (c), then │f δ (x)│ ≤ M. This shows that f is bounded on the neighborhood V (c) of c. Q.E.D.
δ The next definition is similar to the definition for sums, differences, products, and quotients of sequences given in Unit 3.2.
4.2.3 Definition Let A˝ R and let f and g be functions defined on A to R. We define the sum f + g, the difference f – g, and the product f g on A to R to be the functions given by (f + g) (x) := f(x) + g(x), (f - g) (x) := f(x) - g(x), (fg) (x) := f(x) g(x) for all x ∈A.
Further, if b ∈R, we define the multiple b f to be the function given by (bf) (x) := bf(x) for all x ∈ A.
Finally, if h (x) ≠ 0 for x∈A, we define the quotientf / h to be the function given by i (x) := i(_) for all x ∈ A. h k j j(_) 4.2.4 Theorem Let A ˝ R, let fand g be functions on A to R, and let c є R be a cluster point of A.
Further, let b ∈R.
(a) lim f = L and lim g = M, then: x→ c x→ c lim (f + g) = L + M, lim(f - g) = L – M, x→ c x→ c lim (fg) = LM, lim (bf) = bL.
x→ c x→ c (b) IF h: A → R, if h(x) ≠ 0 for all x є A, and if lim h = H ≠ 0, then x → c ( ) = lim l n. x → c m o Proof.
One proof to this theorem is exactly similar to that of Theorem 3.2.3.
Alternatively, it can be proof by making use of Theorems 3.2.3 and 4.1.8.
For example, let (x ) be any n sequence in A such that x ≠ c for n ∈N, and c = lim(x ).
It follows from Theorem 4.1.8 that n n Lim(f(x )) = L, lim(g(x )) = M. n n Introduction to Real Analysis 121 On the other hand, Definition 4.2.3 implies that (fg) (x ) = f(x ) g(x ) for n∈N.
n n n Therefore an application of Theorem 3.2.3 yields Lim((fg) (x )) = lim(f(x ) g(x )) n n n = [lim(f(x ))] [lim(g(x ))] = LM.
n n Consequently, it follows from Theorem 4.1.8 that Lim(fg) = lim((fg) (x )) = LM.
n x → c The other parts of this theorem are proved in a similar manner.
We leave the details to the reader.
Q.E.D.
Remarks (1) We note that, in part (b), the additional assumption that H = lim h ≠ 0 is made.
If this assumption is not satisfied, then the limit x → c limi(_) j(_) x → c may or may not exist.
But even if this limit does exist, we cannot use Theorem 4.2.4 (b) to evaluate it.
(2) Let A ˝ R, and let f , f ,···, f be functions on A to R, and let c be a cluster point of A.
If 1 2 n L := lim f for k = 1,···, n, k k x → c then it follows from Theorem 4.2.4 by an Induction argument that L + L + ··· + L = lim(f +f + ··· + f ), 1 2 n 1 2 n x → c and L · L ··· L = lim(f · f ··· f ).
1 2 n 1 2 n In particular, we deduce that if L = lim f and n ∈N, then x → c Ln= lim(f(x))n. x → c 4.2.5 Examples (a)Some of the limits that were established in Unit 4.1 can be proved by using Theorem 4.2.4.
For example, it follows from this result that since lim x = c, x → c then lim x2 = c2, and that if c> 0, then x→c Introduction to Real Analysis 122 lim (cid:5) = (cid:5) = (cid:5) .
x→c _ x→pqrc _ X (b) lim (x2 + 1)(x3 - 4) = 20. x→2 It follows from theorem 4.2.4 that Lim (x2 + 1) (x3 - 4) = (lim(x2 + 1)) (lim (x3 - 4)) x→2 x→2 x→2 = 5.4 = 20.

x→2 _[ Y (cid:5) pqr(_[Y(cid:5)) ^ _→(cid:15) Note that since the limit in the denominator [i.e., lim (x2+ 1) = 5] is not equal to 0, then Theorem 4.2.4 (b) is applicable.
x→2 (d) lim=_[a ] = ].
x→2g _ a b g If we let f (x) := x2- 4 and h (x) := 3x – 6 for x є R, then we cannot use Theorem 4.2.4 (b) to evaluate lim (f(x)/h(x)) because x→2 H = lim h(x) = lim (3x - 6) x→2 x→ 2 = 3 lim x – 6 = 3·2 – 6 = 0. x→2 However, if x 2, then it follows that ≠ _[a] = (_Y(cid:15))(_a(cid:15)) = (cid:5) (x + 2).

x→2 g_abx→2 g x → 2 g g Note that the function g(x) = (x2 - 4) / (3x - 6) has a limit at x = 2 even though it is not defined there.
(e) lim (cid:5) does not exist in R. x→0 _ Of course lim 1 = 1 and H := lim x = 0.
However, since H = 0, we cannot use Introduction to Real Analysis 123 x→0 x → 0 Theorem 4.2.4 (b) to evaluate lim (1/x).
In fact, as was seen in Example 4.1.10 (a), the x→0 function φ(x) = 1/x does not have limit at x = 0.
This conclusion also follows from Theorem 4.2.2 since the function φ(x) = 1/x is not bounded on a neighborhood of x = 0.
(Why?)
(f) If p is a polynomial function, then lim p (x)= p(c).
x→c Let p be a polynomial function on R so that p (x) = a xn + a xn-1 + ··· + a x + n n-1 1 a for all x ˛ R. It follows from Theorem 4.2.4 and the fact that lim xk = ck, that 0 x→c lim p (x)= lim [a xn + a xn-1 + ··· + a x +a ] n n-1 1 0 x→c x→c = lim (a xn) + lim (a xn-1) + ···+ lim (a x) + lim a n n-1 1 0 x→c x→c x→c x→c = a cn + a cn-1 + ···+ a c + a n n-1 1 0 = p (c).
Hence lim p (x) = p (c) for any polynomial function p. x→c (g) If p and q are polynomial function on R and if q (c) ≠ 0, then lim s(_) = s(X).
t(_) t(X) x→c Since q (x) is a polynomial function, it follows from a theorem in algebra in algebra that there are at most a finite number of real numbers α , …, α [the real zeroes of q(x)] such that q (α) 1 m j = 0 and such that if xˇ {α , ···, α }, then q (x) ≠ 0.
Hence, if x є [α , ···, α ], we can define 1 m 1 m r(x) := s(_).
t(_) If c is not a zero of q(x), then q (c) ≠ 0, and it follows from part (f) that lim q (x) =q (c) ≠ 0.
Therefore we can apply Theorem 4.2.4 (b) to conclude that x→ c lim p(x) p(x) p(c) lim = x→c= x→c q(x) lim q(x) q(c) x→c The next result is a direct analogue of Theorem 3.2.6.

TheoremLet A˝ R, let f : A → Rand let c є R be a cluster point of A.
If Introduction to Real Analysis 124 a ≤ f (x)≤b for all x ˛ A, x ≠ c, and if lim f exists, then a ≤ lim f ≤ b. x→c x→c Proof.
Indeed, if L = lim f, then it follows from Theorem 4.1.8 that if (x ) is any sequence n x→c of real numbers such that c ≠ x є A for all n˛ N and if the sequence (x ) converges to c, then n n the sequence(f (x )) converges to L. Since a ≤ f (x ) ≤ b for all n˛ N, it follows from Theorem n n 3.2.6 that a ≤ L ≤ b. Q.E.D.
We now state an analogue of the squeeze Theorem 3.2.7.
We leave its proof to the reader.
4.0 CONCLUSION 4.2.7 Squeeze Theorem Let A ˝ R, let f, g, h : A → R, and let c ˛ Rbe a cluster point of A.

x→0 Let f (x) := x3/2 for x > 0.
Since the inequality x <x1/2≤ 1 holds for 0 <x ≤ 1 (Why?
), it follows that x2 ≤ f (x) = x3/2≤ x for 0 <x ≤ 1.
Since lim x2 = 0 and lim x = 0, x→0 x → 0 it follows from the Squeeze Theorem 4.2.7 that lim x3/2 = 0. x→0 (b) lim sin x = 0. x→0 It will be proved later (See Theorem 8.4.8), that - x ≤ sin x ≤ x for all x ≥ 0.
Since lim (±x) = 0, it follows from the squeeze Theorem that lim sin x = 0. x→0 x→ 0 (c) lim cos x = 1. x→ 0 It will be proved later (see Theorem 8.4.8) that Introduction to Real Analysis 125 (1) 1 - (cid:5)x2 ≤ cos x ≤ 1 fro all x ˛ R.

(Why not?)
However, it follows from the inequality (1) in part (c) that -(cid:5)x ≤ (cos x - 1) / x ≤ 0 for x > 0 (cid:15) and that 0 ≤ (cos x – 1) / x ≤ - (cid:5)x for x< 0.
(cid:15) Now let f (x) := -x/2 for x ≥ 0 and f (x) := 0 for x < 0, and let h (x) := 0 for x ≥ 0 and h (x) := - x/2for x < 0.
Then we have f (x) ≤ (cos x - 1)/x ≤ h (x) for x ≠ 0.
Since it is readily seen that lim f = 0 = lim h, it follows from the squeeze theorem that lim x→0 x → 0 x → 0 (cos x -1) /x = 0.
( ) (e) lim xyz{ = 1. x→ 0 { Again we cannot use Theorem 4.2.4 (b) to evaluate this limit.
However, it will be proved later (see Theorem 8.4.8) that x - (cid:5)x3 ≤ sin x ≤ x forx ≥ 0 b and that x ≤ sin x ≤ x - (cid:5) x3 for x ≤ 0. b Therefore it follows (why?)
that 1 - (cid:5)x2 ≤ (sin x) /x ≤ 1 for x ≠ 0. b But since lim (1 - (cid:5)x2) = 1 - (cid:5) .
lim x2 = 1, we infer the Squeeze Theorem that lim (sin x) /x =1 x→0 b b x→0 x→0 (f)lim (x sin(1/x)) = 0 x → 0 Letf (x) = x sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0.
Since – 1 ≤ sin z ≤ 1 for all z є R, we have the inequality - │x│≤ f(x) = x sin(1/x) ≤ │x│ Introduction to Real Analysis 126 for all x˛ R, x ≠ 0.
Since lim │x│ = 0, it follows from the squeeze Theorem that lim f = 0.

Since all the ideals here are closely parallel to the ones we have already encountered, this unit can be read easily.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the Unit, readers should be able to: (i) know three types of extensions of the notion of a limit of a function Introduction to Real Analysis 128 One-sided Limits ____________________________________________________________ There are times when a function f may not possess a limit at a point c, yet a limit does exist when the function is restricted to an interval on one side of the cluster point c. For example, the signum function considered in Example 4.1.10 (b), and illustrated in Figure 4.1.2, has no limit at c = 0.
However, if we restrict the signum function to the interval (0, ∞), the resulting function has a limit of 1 at c = 0.
Similarly, if we restrict the signum function to the interval (-∞, 0), the resulting function has a limit of – 1 at c = 0.
These are elementary examples of right-hand and left-hand limits at c = 0.
4.3.1 Definition Let A ˛ R and let f : A → R. (i) If c є R is a cluster point of the set A ∩ (c, ∞) = {x ˛ A : x >c}, then we say that L ˛ R is a right-hand limit of f at c and we write Lim f = L or lim f(x) = L x → c+ x → c+ ↑This unit can be largely omitted on a first reading of this chapter if given any є > 0 there exists a δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that for all x є A with 0 <x – c < δ, then │f(x) - L│ < ε.
(ii) If c ˛ R is a cluster point of the set A ∩ (- ∞, c) = (x є A : x<c), then we say that L є R is aleft-hand limit of f at c and we write Lim f = L or lim f(x) = L x → c- x → c- if given any ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x є A with 0 <c – x < δ, then │ f(x) – L │ <ε.
Notes (1) The limits lim f and lim f are called one-sided limits of fat c. It is possible that x → c+ x → c- neither one-sided limit may exist.
Also, one of them may exist without the other existing.
Similarly, as is the case for f(x) := sgn(x) at c = 0, they may both exist and be different.
(2) If A is an interval with left endpoint c, then it is readily such that f : A → R has a limit at c if and only if it has a right-hand limit at c. Moreover, in this case the limit lim f and the x → c right-hand limit lim f are equal.
(A similar situation occurs for the left-hand limit when A is x → c+ an interval with right endpoint c.) the reader can show that f can have only one right-hand (respectively, left-hand) limit at a point.
There are results analogous to those established in Units 4.1 and 4.2 for two-sided limits.
In particular, the existence of one-sided limits can be reduced to sequential considerations.
4.3.2 Theorem Let A˝ R, let f : A → R, and let c ˛ R be a cluster of A ∩ (c, ∞).
Then the following statements are equivalent: Introduction to Real Analysis 129 (i) lim f = L. x → c+ (ii) For every sequence (x ) that converges to c such that x є A and x >c for all n є N, the n n n sequence (f(x )) converges to L. n We leave the proof of this result (and the formulation and proof of the analogous result for left-hand limits) to the reader.
We will not take the space to write out the formulations of the one-sided version of the other results in Units 4.2 and 4.2.
The following result relates the notion of the limit of a function to one-sided limits.
We leave its proof as an exercise.
4.3.3 Theorem Let A ˝ R, let f : A → R, and let c є R be a cluster point of both of the sets A ∩ (c, ∞) and A ∩ (- ∞, c).
Then lim f = L if and only if lim f = L lim f. x → c x → c+ x → c+ 4.3.4 Examples (a) Let f(x) := sgn(x).
We have seen in Example 4.1.10 (b) that sgn does not have a limit at 0.
It is clear that lim x → c+ sgn(x) = + 1 and that lim sgn(x) = - 1.
Since these one-sided limits are different, it also x →0- follows from Theorem 4.3.3 that sgn(x) does not have a limit at 0.
(b) Let g(x) := e1/xfor x ≠ 0.
(See Figure 4.3.1.)
Figure 4.3.1 Graph of g(x) = e1/x(x ≠ 0).
We first show that g does not have a finite right-hand limit at c = 0 since it is not bounded on any right-hand neighborhood (0, δ) of 0.
We shall make use of the inequality (1) 0 <t <e1 for t > 0, which will be proved later (see Corollary 8.3.3).
It follows from (10 that if x > 0, then 0 < 1/x <e1/x.
Hence, if we take x = 1/n, then g(x ) >n for all n ˛ N. Therefore lim e1/xdoes not exist n n in R. x → 0+ Introduction to Real Analysis 130 However, lime1/x= 0.
Indeed, if x < 0 and we take t = - 1/x in (1) we obtain 0 < - 1/x e-1/x, x → 0- Since x < 0, this implies that 0 <e1/x< - x for all x < 0.
It follows from this inequality that lim e1/x = 0. x→0- (c) Let h(x) := 1/(e1/x + 1) for x ≠ 0.
(See Figure 4.3.2.)
We have seen in part (b) that 0 < 1/x e1/x for x > 0, whence 0 < (cid:5) < (cid:5) <x, ƒZ/{Y (cid:5) ƒZ/{ Which implies that lim h = 0. x → 0+ Figure 4.3.2 Graph of h(x) = 1/(e1/x + 1) (x ≠ 0).
Since we have in part (b) that lim e1/x = 0, it follows from the analogue of Theorem 4.2.4 (b) for left-hand limits that x → 0- ( ) lim (cid:5) (cid:15) = (cid:5) = 1. x → 0- ƒZ/{Y (cid:5) 1 dY(cid:5) x → 0- pqr„(cid:13)Y (cid:5) Note that for this function, both one-sided l9mits exist in R, but they are unequal.
Infinite Limits ______________________________________________________________ The function f(x) := 1/x2for x ≠ 0 (see Figure 4.3.3) is not bounded on a neighborhood of 0, so it cannot have a limit in the sense of Definition 4.1.4.
While the symbols ∞ (= + ∞) and -∞ do not represent real numbers, it is sometimes useful to be able to say that “f(x) = 1/x2 tends to ∞ as x → 0”.
This use of ±∞ will not cause any difficulties, provided we exercise caution and never interpret ∞ or as being real numbers.
(cid:14)∞ Introduction to Real Analysis 131 Figure 4.3.3 Graph of Figure 4.3.4 Graph of f(x) = 1/x2 (x ≠ 0) g(x) = 1/x (x ≠ 0) 4.3.5 Definition Let A˝ R, let f : A → R, and let c ˛ R be a cluster point of A.
(i) We say that f tends to ∞ as x → c, and write lim f = ∞, x → c if for every α ˛ R there exists δ = δ(α) > 0 such that for all x є A with 0 < │x - c│ < δ, then f(x) > α.
(ii) We say that f tends to -∞ as x → c, and write lim f = -∞ x → c if for every β˛ R there exists δ = δ(β) > 0 such that for all x ˛ A with 0 │x - c│ < δ, then f(x) <β.
4.3.6 Examples (a) lim (1/x2) = ∞.
For, if α > 0 is given, let δ := 1/ .
It follows that if 0 < │x│ < δ, then x2> 1/α so that √9 1/x2> α.
(b) Let g(x) := 1/x for x ≠ 0.
(See Figure 4.3.4.)
The function g does notto either ∞ or as x → 0.
For, if α > 0 then g(x) < α for all x < (cid:14)∞ o, so that g does not tend to ∞ as x → 0.
Similarly, if β< 0 then g(x) >β for all x > 0, so that g does not tend to -∞ as x → 0.
Where many of the results in Units 4.1 and 4.2 have extensions to this limiting notion, not all of them do since are not real numbers.
The following result is an analogue of the ±∞ Squeeze Theorem 4.2.7.
(See also Theorem 3.6.4.)
4.3.7 Theorem Let A ˝ R, let f, g : A → R, and let c ˛ R be a cluster point of A.
Suppose that f(x) ≤ g(x) for all x є A, x ≠ c. (a) If lim f = ∞, then lim g = .
∞ x → c x → c (b) If lim g = -∞ then lim f = .
(cid:14)∞ x → c x → c proof.
(a) If lim f = ∞ and α ˛ R is given, then there exists δ(α) > 0 such that if 0 < │x - c│ x → c Introduction to Real Analysis 132 <δ(α) and x ˛ A, thenf(x)>a.
But since f(x) ≤ g(x) for all x ˛ A, x ≠ c, it follows that if 0 < │x - c│ < δ(α) and x ˛ A, then g(x) > α.
Therefore lim g = ∞.
x → c The proof of (b) is similar.
Q.E.D.
The function g(x) = 1/xconsidered in Example 4.3.6 (b) suggests that it might be useful to consider one-sided infinite limits.
We will define only right-hand infinite limits.
4.3.8 Definition Let A ˝ R and let f : A → R. If c ˛ R is a cluster point of the set A ∩ (c, ∞) = {x ˛ A: x > c}, then we say that f tends to ∞ [respectively, ] as x → c+,and we write (cid:14)∞ [ ] lim f = ∞ respectively, lim f = , (cid:14)∞ x → c+ x → c+ if for every α ˛ R there is δ = δ(α) > 0 such that for all x ˛ A with 0 <x – c < δ, then f(x) > α [respectively, f(x) < α].
4.3.9 Examples (a) Let g(x) := 1/x ≠ 0.
We have noted in Example 4.3.6 (b) that lim g does not exist.
However, it is an easy exercise to show that.
x → 0 lim (1/x) = ∞ and lim (1/x) = -∞ x → 0+ x → 0- (b) It was seen Example 4.3.4 (b) that the function g(x) := e1/xfor x ≠ 0 is not bounded on any interval (0, δ), δ > 0.
Hence the right-hand limit of e1/xas x → 0+ does not exist in the sense of Definition 4.3.1 (i).
However, since 1/x< e1/x for x > 0, It is readily seen that lim e1/x= ∞ in the sense of Definition 4.3.8 x → 0+ Limits at Infinity ____________________________________________________________ It is also desirable to define the notion of the limit of a function as x → The definition as ∞ x→ is similar.
(cid:14)∞ 4.0 CONCLUSION 4.3.10 Definition Let A ˝ R and let f : A → R. Suppose that (a, ∞) ˝ Afor some a ˛ R. We say that L ˛ R is a limit of f as x → ∞, and write lim f = L or lim f(c) = L, x → ∞ x → ∞ if given any ε > 0 there exists K = K(ε) >a such that for any x >K, then │f(x) - L│ <ε.
The reader should note the close resemblance between 4.3.10 and the definition of a limit of a sequence.
Introduction to Real Analysis 133 We leave it to the reader to show that the limits of f as x → ±∞ are unique whenever they exist.
We also have sequential criteria for these limits; we shall only state the criterion as x → ∞.
This uses the notion of the limit of a properly divergent sequence (see Definition 3.6.1).
4.3.11 Theorem Let A ˝ R, let f : A → R, and suppose that (a, ∞) ˝ A for some a ˛ R. Then the following statements are equivalent: (i) L = lim f. x → ∞ (ii) For every sequence (x ) in A ∩ (a, ∞) such that lim(x ) = ∞, the sequence (f(x )) n n n converges to L. We leave it to the reader to prove this theorem and to formulate and prove the companion result concerning the limit as x → .
(cid:14)∞ 4.3.12 Examples (a) Let g(x) := 1/xfor x ≠ 0.
It is an elementary exercise to show that lim(1/x) = 0 = lim(1/x).
(See Figure 4.3.4.)
x → ∞ x → -∞ (b) Let f(x) := 1/x2 for x ≠ 0.
The reader may show that lim(1/x) = 0 = lim(1/x2) .
(See Figure 4.3.3.)
One way to do x → ∞ x → -∞ this is to show that if x ≥ 1 then 0 ≤ 1/x2 ≤ 1/x.
In view of part (a), this implies that lim (1/x2) = .0 x → ∞ Just as it is convenient to be able to say that f(x) → ±∞ as x → c for c ˛ R, it is convenient to have the corresponding notion as x → ±∞.
We will treat the case where x → ∞.
4.3.13 Definition Let A ˝ R and let f : A → R. Suppose that (a, ∞) CA for some a ˛ A.
We say that f tends to ∞ [respectively, -∞] as x → ∞, and write [ ] Lim f = ∞ respectively, lim f = -∞ x → ∞ x → ∞ if given any α ˛ R there exists K = K(α) >a such that for any x >K, then f(x) > α [respectively, f(x) < α].
As before there is a sequential criterion for this limit.
4.3.14 Theorem Let A ˛ R, let f : A → R, and suppose that (a, ∞) ˝ A for some a ˛ R. Then the following statements are equivalent: (i) lim f = ∞ [respectively, lim f = ].
(cid:14)∞ x → ∞ x → ∞ (ii) For every sequence (x ) in (a, ∞) such that lim(x ) = ∞, then lim(f(x )) = ∞ [respectively, n n n lim(f(x )) = ].

5.0 SUMMARY Introduction to Real Analysis 134 4.3.15 Theorem Let A ˝ R, let f, g : A →R, and suppose that (a, ∞) ˝ A for some a ˛ R. Suppose further that g(x) > 0 for all x >a and that for some L ˛ R, L ≠ 0, we have limi(_) = L. …(_) x → ∞ (i) If L > 0, then lim f = ∞ if and only if lim g = ∞.

Given α ˛ R, let K := sup{1, α}.
Then for all x > K, we have g(x) = xn≤ x > α.
Since α ˛ R is arbitrary, it follows that lim g = ∞.
x → ∞ (b) lim xn = ∞ for n ˛ N, n even, and lim xn= -∞ for n ˛ N, n odd.
x → -∞ x → -∞ We will treat the case n odd, say n = 2k + 1 with k = 0, 1, ···.
Given α ˛ R, let K := inf{α, -1}.
For any x < K, then since (x2)k≥ 1, we have xn= (x2)k x ≤ x < α.
Since α ˛ R is arbitrary, it follows that lim xn = -∞.
