rich atmosphere - have combined to create conditions suitable for life to develop on it.
The earth exists in the form of three states of matter-the solid rocks on which we stand, being the SOLID, ocean is the LIQUID and atmosphere depicts the GAS.
Understanding of the structure, origin and nature of the solid earth is imperative for a meaningful study of the solid part of the earth.
This unit deals with the formation theories of the earth, differentiating characteristics of the earth as well as causes and effects of earth zoning.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: (a) Relate cold and hot theories of the earth formation.
(b) State at least three characteristic that differentiates the earth from other planets (c) Enumerate at least three conditions that make the earth a congenial place for life to develop (d) Explain the cause and after mat effects of IRON CATASTROPHE.
(e) Explain the formation of the three states of matter components of the earth.
3.1 Early Theories on the Origin of the Earth The theories explained the formation of the planet including the earth.
- 14 -3.1.1 Cold Origin Theory Nebula hypothesized that a primeval rotating cloud of dust and gas filled the universe initially.
Kant explained further that the denser centre of the rotating dust in the Nebula’s hypothesis formed the sun.
The less dense side portion of the rotating dust broke into pieces to form the planets which the earth is one of them.
However, this theory failed to explain angular momentum observation in the solar system whereby sun alone constitutes 99.9% mass of the solar system but 99% of the angular momentum of the solar system is concentrated in the large farther planets from the sun.
3.1.2 Hot Origin Theory The theory holds that gravitational attraction between the sun and the preexisting passing stars caused violent collisions and materials were turn off from the colliding stars.
The turn off particles joined in parts and formed the planets in which the earth is a part.
The weaknesses of this theory are: - Angular momentum observation about the solar system was not explained.
- Why has the collisions happened once, is ambiguous.
- Why the collision is perfectly elastic?
The materials could have scattered.
3.2 Peculiar Features of the Earth The planet earth possesses some distinguishing features that differentiated it from other planets.
Some of the features suit the development of lives in it.
Some of the characteristics are: - 15 -- High gravitation field, that keeps objects on its surface - Uniform motion such as rotation, revolution and wobbling that causes day and night and seasonal changes.
- Presence of enough water for activities such as agriculture.
- Balanced distance from the sun, not too short nor too far - Presence of rich atmosphere in gaseous form and contains ozone layer.
3.3 Sources of Earth’s Zoning About 4.7 billion years ago there was an accretion of conglomeration of unsorted particles scattered in the universe forming the earth as one of the planets.
The earth became warmed up as a result of the following processes: - Particle acceleration :The kinetic energy of the particles coming together turned To heat energy - Gravitational pull between the particles: The pulls resulted in high pressure which raised the heat energy.
- Radioactivity: Heat evolved during disintegrations of radioactive elemental components of the earth’s particles.
The heat from the above sources raised the temperature of the earth to the melting point of iron which melted the whole earth – the event called IRON CATASTROPHE.
3.3.1 Zoning of the Solid Earth The molten earth that resulted during Iron catastrophe settled such that lighter particles like silicon etc floated, cooled and formed the outer crust and mantle.
The heavier particles like iron etc settled beneath the crust forming the core.
Hence, iron - 16 -1 formed of the earth mass (Fig.1) Water containing particle in the earth went through 3 chemical changes and released water which settled on the surface to form the ocean.
Gas containing particles also went through chemical changes releasing gasses to form the lightest atmosphere which is located on top of the liquid and parts of the earth.
Crust (Dense) Mantle (Denser) Core (Densest) Fig.1: Simplified Model of the Solid Earth 3.4 Self Assessment Exercise (a) The earth is formed from the remnant particles of what heavily bodies, according to the hot origin theory?
(b) List the source of the heat that caused iron catastrophe.
(c) Which part of the solid earth is densest?
(d) Why is the ocean located on the surface of the earth?

The internal and external parts of the earth are in a regular zone that conformed to scientific reasoning.
5.0 Summary I this unit you have learnt the following: (i) Cold and hot origin theories of the earth (ii) The characteristics of the earth that suit the development of life on it.

This unit examines the various modes of motion like rotation, revolution, wobbling and their effect such as centrifugal sorting and oblate nature of the earth.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit you should be able to: (a) Describe the three main types of motion of the earth (b) State the effect of each of the three motions.
(c) Show diagrammatically the two hypotheses of earth’s rotation (d) Explain the cause of the density variation of the solid earth (e) Relate the centrifugal sorting to the density variation of the solid earth 3.1 Types of motion of the earth The earth, in order to maintain celestial dynamic equilibrium with other planets and other heavenly bodies, is under going series of complex motions.
The three major types of the motion whose effects are observable in our daily life are discussed ahead.
- 21 -3.1.1 Revolution Polar B Axis F2 Earth A Su F 1 Elliptical Orbit Fig.1: Revolutionary motion of the The earetha rtmho ve s along an elliptical orbit whose plane is fairly perpendicular to the polar axis of the earth.
F and F are the foci of the orbit with sun at one of the foci.
1 2 This motion has a periodicity of 31557600 seconds (i.e.
a year) and determines the global season.
The seasonal change is brought about as a result of earth distance from the sun at each location on its orbit.
For instance, at location B the earth is far from the sun, so the sun’s heat may not be much to cause enough evaporation for much rain.
At location A the earth experiences much heat of the sun rays.
This causes intense evaporation, leading to rain possibility.
Left flip 3.1.2 Wobble A Sun Right flip B Fig.
2: Flip-flop Motion of the Earth - 22 -The earth exhibits Flip-flop (wobble) motion about its equator as it is revolving round the sun.
It should be noted that northern hemisphere is closer to the sun than southern hemisphere.
Thus, northern hemisphere experiences longer day and shorter night at this time; But reverse is the case at the location B.
3.1.3 Rotation This is a rotation about polar axis from west to east in an anticlockwise direction, viewing from the tip of the northern pole.
The average period of earth’s rotation is 86400 seconds.
(i.e.
a day).
Hence, rotation of the earth: - determines the length of the day and night - causes its ellipsoidal/oblate shape i.e.
equatorial radius being longer than the Polar radius -results in density variation from the surface to the centre of the earth 3.2 Hypotheses about the Rotation of the Earth 3.2.1 Cassini’s hypothesis He proposed that the earth is rotating about the equator with the polar axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
If this is true then the earth will assume prolate ellipsoid shape and one side of it would be experiencing permanent day light while the other side would be in darkness permanently.
- 23 - Polar axis Sun Axis of rotation Permanent Permanent day-light zone night zone Fig.3: Cassini’s Prolate Ellipsoidal earth 3.2.2 Newtonian Hypothesis Newton hypothesised that the earth is rotating about the polar axis which lead to the oblate ellipsoidal shape of the earth.
Fig.4: Newtonian Oblate Ellipsoidal Earth - 24 -The geophysical evidence such as longer equatorial radius than the polar radius, centrifugal sorting of the earth into its density regimes in which the density increases from the surface towards the centre and occurrence of day and night support Newtonian hypothesis.
3.3 Self-Assessment Exercise1 (i) Draw a wobbling earth with its poles in a vertical position.
(ii) What would be the length of days and nights when the earth wobbles to the position you draw above?
(iii) List the practical experiences on the earth that negate Cassini’s hypothesis on the rotation of the earth (iv) Mention the practical experiences on the earth that supports Newtonian hypothesis about the rotation of the earth.
3.4 Effect of rotation on the internal structure Given the fact that the earth was initially melted, a state attained during Iron Catastrophe, as the earth rotates it behaves like a centrifuge, sending the lighter materials of crust to the flanks while the denser and homogeneous mantle and core materials remain closer to the centre of the earth.
Geophysical studies have confirmed the inhomogeneous crust, denser and homogenous mantle (Fig.5) - 25 - Homogeneous layers B C A Inhomogeneous layer Fig.5: Centrifugal Sorting of the Earth Interior 3.5 Earth Shaping due to its Rotation C C C f Equator R e R p Fig.6: Deviation of the Earth Shape from a Perfect Sphere - 26 -The earth rotates about its pole with angular velocity of 7.292 10-5rad /s.As the earth rotates centrifugal and centripetal forces (C and C ) cancelled out and net force is F P zero.
Thus, no deformation is caused along the equator.
The centrifugal force decreases towards the pole from the equator.
Thus there is net force towards the centre of the earth which increases in magnitude as we move further from the equator.
C decreases to zero F at the equators and a maximum centripetal, i.e.
net force, directed to the centre is obtained at the poles.
Consequently the Polar Regions are flattened and the equatorial region bulges outwards.
Hence, the earth assumes the oblate spheroidal nature.
Geophysical studies have confirmed this when the equatorial radius is longer than polar radius.
R R Earth flattening f = e p .
R e 3.6 Factors Responsible for the Sculpture of the Earth Surface The surface of the solid part of the earth is not smooth; it exists with wrinkles of hills, valleys, plateaus etc.
Some of the causes of the surface shapes are: (a) Gravitational pulls: After iron catastrophe side particles experiences gravitational pulls from the interior of the earth.
Since the pull is from all the directions round the solid earth.
Hence, the earth appears fairly spherical (Fig.7).
However the in homogeneity of the crustal layer varies the magnitude of the gravitational pulls from place to place depending on the density of the area concerned.
Hence, areas with denser crust appear lower (i.e.
low land like valley) than those areas that have light crusts beneath.
- 27 - Denser crust G A b G and G are gravitational pulls.
G >G a b a b G a G b Gb Fig.7: Earth’s surface sculpture by the gravitational pull.
(b) Volcanic eruption: Sporadic volcanic eruption from the interior of the earth sometimes protrudes to the surface and form high-rise land such as continental platform and mountain.
(c) Interaction between lithosphere and the two fluid envelops (i.e.
atmosphere and hydrosphere).
The fluids wear down the volcanic (igneous) rocks.
Wind and water erosions transport the loose rock materials to another place to form sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.
(d) Plate tectonics: This refers to the significant movements noticeable on earth’s layer called Plates.
Some of the processes of plate tectonics are: Sea-floor spreading, earth quake, continental drift, fault etc.
3.7 Self-assessment Exercise 2 i Given that equatorial and polar radii to be 6378.388 km and 6356.912 determine the flattening of the earth - 28 -ii Give a condition for gravitational pull to give rise to a valley on the earth’s surface iii Explain the cause of the oblate spheroid shape of the earth 4.0 Conclusion The earth experiences three main motions whose effects are observable on earth.
Most of the internal structure and constitution the geophysical studies have direct links with the rotation of the earth.
5.0 Summary In this unit we have learnt that: (i) The earth experiences three types of motion (ii) Rotation f the earth is responsible for the internal density distribution and oblate spheroidal shape of the earth.
(iii) Newtonian hypothesis is most acceptable about the rotation of the earth (iv) The four factors that is responsible for the shape of the earth’s surface.

--------------------------------------------------11 1.0 Introduction - 31 -The internal structures of the solid earth are probed using some geophysical methods.
The information obtained are utilised to draw model of the pictures about the interiors of the solid earth.
Further, most of the features existing on the earth surface are consequences of the events which either took place around the time of formation of the earth or after mat effects of other event taking place with time.
This unit deals with the models of the interior structure of the earth based on the scientific facts.
The causes and structure of the external features of the solid earth are treated.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit you would learn the following: (a) Earth models based on the chemical composition and ability of the material to flow.
(b) Evidence of in homogeneity of the earth crust (c) Formation of three states of the earth.
(d) Global distribution and surface sequences of the ocean and continent.
3.1 Evidences of the Inhomogeneity of the Solid Earth The crust is the layer closest to the surface of the solid earth.
It is the layer that shows high level of structural variations within the rock layers.
The inhomogeneity of the earth is shown in the following.
(1) Density variation: The surface density of the solid earth has been found to be about 2.67g/cm3, but the average density of the earth is 5.5g/cm3.
This implies that deep beneath the earth’s surface is denser, i.e.
density increases with depth.
- 32 -(2) Rotational Analogous of mass is Moment of inertia (I).
That is, as I is a measure  of resistance of a rotating body to changing its angular velocity ( ) mass is the measure of resistance of a body to change its initial states.
So, I depends on mass and the distribution of mass in a body.
So, for a sphere with uniform density, I = bma2, where b = 2/ Now, for earth model I = b = ma2, If b is greater than 2/ 5, 5, density decreases with depth and if b is less than 2/ densityincreases with depth.
5, But for planet earth b has been found to be 0.3308 which is less than 2/5; hence density increases with depth in the earth.
3.2 Internal Models of the Solid Earth The nature of the solid earth’s interior is obtained using various criteria, based on the available scientific information.
Two models are discussed below.
3.2.1 Earth’s Model based on chemical composition The solid earth is oblate with equatorial and polar radii approximately equal to 637.8388 km and 6356.912 km respectively.
Based on the chemical compositions seismological evidence gave the following subdivisions (a) Crust: There is continental and oceanic crust and it is a solid layer.
Continental crust is basically solid, 30 – 40 km thick, mostly granite rocks and Gabbro with seismic primary wave velocity of 6 – 7 km/s.
It is basically in three forms based on their geologic history of formation over the last 100 million years - 33 -(i) Stable region (cratons) - Little evidences of vertical or horizontal movement but with evidences of close warping of few minor faults (ii) Semi-mobile region - Characterised by differential vertical movement and formation of Sedimentary basin (iii) Mobile belts - Characterised by young mountain ranges - Strong deformation - Strong vertical and horizontal movements Oceanic crusts are mostly basalts and Gabbro, 5 – 11 km thick and they mostly exist in three layers namely: (i) Layer 1 - It is a non consolidated sediment - It has seismic velocity of between 1.5 – 1.8 km/s - It is 0.3 to 0.8 km thick (ii) Layer 2 - It is 1 – 2 km thick - It has seismic velocity of 2.1 – 5.5 km/s (iii) Layer 3 - It is a basaltic layer - It has seismic velocity of between 6.5 and 7.0 km/s - 34 -- It is 5 km thick (b) Mohorovicic Boundary: It is chemical boundary separating silicic crustal rock with high Feldspar content from underlying Ultramafic rocks of mantle.
(c) Mantle: It is a solid layer and is about 2900 km thick.
It is the largest of all the subdivisions, 84% by volume and 69% mass of the entire earth and divided into 3 zones namely: (i) Upper mantle - Mineralization of upper mantle is approximately 40% Olivine, 50% Pyroxene and 10% Garnet (ii) Transition layer - It is characterised by abrupt increase in seismic velocity which is attributed to phase change - It is iron rich (iii) Lower Mantle - Seismic velocity and density increase steadily with depth - It has velocity homogeneity (b) Gutenberg Boundary: It is a discontinuity between the mantle an the core (c) Core: It is 16% and 13% by volume and mass of the earth.
It is about 3470 km thick extended to the centre of the earth and is in 3 zones namely: (1) Outer core - It is about 2080 km thick - 35 -- It is believed to be in liquid form because seismic S – Wave cannot pass through it - Earth’s magnetic field originates from it - The response of the earth to tidal forces which affects axis of rotation and the centrifugal force that counter the centripetal force along the equator, which is responsible for the bulginess of the earth at the equator, are associated with the liquid nature of the outer core (ii) Transition zone It is a slightly rigid shell (140 km thick) surrounding the solid inner core with temperature of about 3000 kelvins which is about the melting point of iron.
(iii) Inner core It is 1250 km thick, solid and with P – wave velocity increase inward, which implies density increase.
3.2.2 Earth’s Model based on Ability to flow Earth model can be drawn based on the ability of its layer to flow.
The layers are: 1 Lithosphere- cold and brittle.
2 Asthonosphere capableto flow 3 Rheonosphere  It was reported that towards the centre it becomes hardened again as a result of pressure.
3.3 Self – Assessment exercise 1 - 36 -(i) What is the source of the centrifugal force that is responsible for the bulginess of the earth?
(ii) How does the density vary from the crust to the core?
(iii) Briefly discuss the evidences to confirm that the earth crust is density in homogenous 3.4 Surface Structure of the Solid Earth The surface of the solid earth witnessed series of features such as oceans and continents which are consequences of geological events that took place over a long period of time; some of the features are explained below.
3.4.1 Formation of Continents, Ocean and Atmosphere (i) Continents: Lava flows as a result of volcanism from the interior to the outer layer cooled and became continent.
(ii) Oceans: From the interior of the solid earth as a product of the Process of heating up and differentiation, some water bearing elements released their water molecules which accumulate on the surface to form the oceanic water.
(iii) Atmosphere: Out-gassing , resulting from differentiation and some gas releasing chemical reactions brought about much gasses that accumulated above the solid earth.
3.4.2 Global distribution of continents and oceans - 37 -About 45% of the earth surface has sea-sea antipodal and 1.4% has land-land antipodal.
Northern hemisphere has 60% land and 40% water, while southern hemisphere has 61% water and 39% land.
In general, earth’s surface has 29% continent and 71% is covered by ocean.
The total world area is approximately510106km2.
3.4.3 Significant Surface Features of Oceans.
Continental platform Elevation h Ocean Surface (sea level) Continental self Continental slope Ocean water Mid -Ocean ridge Ocean floor Elevation h is the height relative to see surface on the continent.
Average elevation of continents is 0.88 km.
Average depth or ocean floor is 3.8 km.
Continental rocks are lighter than oceanic rocks.
There is world wide mountain range that crosses the ocean basin 1000 km wide and 65,000 km long across the world.
3.5 Sequence of the Solid Earth’s Surface Top surface - 38 - h = elevation Sea level Geoids (sea level)  The earth’s surface is basically viewed in three forms: (i) The top surface is the continental platform wrinkled in nature.
(ii) Geoids is the sea level, where sea water will flow to if the continent were to be tunnelled.
In other word, geoid is the equipotential surface to which direction of gravity field is everywhere perpendicular.
The vertical separation between the geoids and a point on the earth’s surface is the elevation.
(iv) Ellipsoid is the ideal smooth surface of the earth in its oblate form.
It sometimes coincides with geoids, but sometimes not.

radius of earth).Measurement of these on the surface gives due to the structure of the underlying interior of the earth.
The deals with variation of density pressure, gravitational field, Velocity and temperature with depth within the earth’s rocks.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: (1) describe the trend of variation of pressure, density, gravitational field, and seismic velocity as well and with depth in the solid earth.
(2) derive the mathematical relations for the variation of parameter itemised in (1) (3) Apply the mathematical formula to real life events 3.1 Variation of Density with depth Consider density dependent on pressure P and temperature T.

It shows uniform density increase (Fig.1) Where  = adiabatic incompressibility (i.e.
bulk modulus) M = Mass of the region of the earth with the earth less by the mass of the crust r = radius of the earth’s region with uniform composition G = Gravitational constant - 44 -3.2 Variation of Pressure P with Depth This has to do with the pressure distribution and variation of acceleration due to gravity.

as r decreases (Fig.1) Also; it shows that pressure has direct relation with the density.
3.3 Variation of Acceleration due to gravity with depth GM Recall that g .
So, variation of g with depth can be calculated using the r2 relation above.
Its value does not differ by more than 1% from 990 km until a depth of 2400 km is reached where it decreases to zero (Fig.1) 3.4 Variation of Pressure P and S waves with Depth In seismology P and S waves are used to study the interior of the solid earth.
P- Wave is a longitudinal wave that can pass through liquid, solid and gas.
S- Wave is a transverse wave that can travel vertically and horizontally and can not pass through fluids.
P and S- waves are called body waves because they can pass through the earth’s interior.
They however possess different velocities while passing through an earth - 45 -material.
usually P- wave is always faster than S- wave.
Let  and β be the P and S waves Velocities.

The models developed are easily applicable to layer below the crust where there is some element of homogeneity than in the crust that is characterised by inhomogeneity.
