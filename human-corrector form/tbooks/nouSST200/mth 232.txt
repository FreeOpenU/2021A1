In fact, it is the source of most of the ideas and theories which constitute higher analysis.
In physics, engineering, chemistry and many other disciplines it has become necessary to build a mathematical model to represent certain problems.
These mathematical models often involve the search for an unknown function that satisfies an equation in which derivatives of the unknown function play an important role.
Such equations are called differential equations.
The primary purpose of differential equations is to serve as a tool for studying change in the physical world.
dy You may recall that if y = f(x) is a given function then its derivation can be dx interpreted as the rate of change of y respect to x .
sir Isaac Newton observed that certain important laws of natural sciences can be phrased in terms of equations involving rates of change.
The most famous example of such a natural law is Newton’s second law of motion.
Newton was able to model the motion of a particle by an equation involving an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives.
1MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION As early as the 1690s, scientists such as Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, Jacques Bernoulli, Jean Bernoulli and Christian Huygens were engaged in solving differential equations.
Many of the methods which they developed are in use till today.
In the eighteenth century the mathematicians Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, Joseph Lagrange and others contributed generously to the development of the subject.
The pioneering work that led to the development of ordinary differential equations as a branch of modern mathematics is due to Cauchy, Riemann, Picard, Poincare, Lyapunov, Birkhoff and others.
Not only are differential equations applied y physicists and engineers, but they are being used more and more in certain biological problems such as the study of animal populations and the study of epidemics.
Differential equations have also proved useful in economics and other social sciences.
Besides its uses, the theory of differential equations involving the interplay of functions and their derivatives, is interesting in itself.
2.0 OBJECTIVES In this unit, we introduce the basic concepts and definitions related to differential equations.
We also express some of the problems of physical and engineering interest in terms of differential equations in this unit.
We shall give the methods of solving differential equations of various types in Units 2 and 3.
The physical problems formulated in this unit will be solved in units 2 and 3.
The physical problems formulated in unit will be solved in unit 3 after we have learnt the various methods of solving the first order equations.
• Distinguish between the order and degree of a differential equation; • Define the solution of an ordinary differential equation; • Identify an initial value problem; • State and use the conditions for existence and uniqueness of first order ordinary different equations; • Derive differential equations for some physical problems.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Basic Concepts In this section we shall define and explain the basic concepts in the theory of differential equations and illustrate them through examples.
2MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION In unit 1 of MTH 112 Differentialcalculus, you have learnt that if a relation y = y(x) involving two variables x and y exist then we call x the independent variable and y the dependent variable.
Further, suppose we are given a relation of the type f(x,t , t , ……., t ) = 0 1 2 n involving (n + 1) variables (x and t , t , ………., t ,); where the value of x depends 1 2 n on the values of the variables t , t , ..…., t are called independent variables and x 1 2 n is called the dependent variable and y is dependent variable.
Similarly, if z = x2 + y2 +2xy, the x and y are independent variables and z is a dependent variable.
Any equation which gives the relation between the independent and dependent variables and the derivatives of dependent variables is called a differential equation .
In general, we have the following definition.
Definition: An equation involving one (or more) dependent variable derivatives with respect to one or more independent variables in called a differential equation.
dy For example, = cosx …(1) dx dy a Y = x + dx dy/dx ….
(2) ¶ z ¶ z y2 + xy = nzx ¶ x ¶ y ….
(3) are all differential equations.
¶ z ¶ z In Eqn.
(3), and are partial derivatives of z w.r.t.x and y respectively.
The ¶ x ¶ y partial derivatives of a function of two variables z = f(x, y) w.r.t to one of the independent variables, can be defined as ¶ z ¶ f lim f(x+ Δx,y)- f(x,y) = = f (x, y) = ¶ x ¶ x x Δy ﬁ 0 Δx 3MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION ¶ z when the limit exist and is independent of the path of approach.
is the first ¶ x order partial derivatives of z w.r.t.x and is obtained by differentiating z w.r.t.x treating y as a constant.
It is read as ‘del z by del x’.
similarly, first order partial ¶ z ¶ f derivative of z w.r.t.
y is denoted by (or or f (x, y), so that ¶ y ¶ y y ¶ z ¶ f lim f(x,y+ Δy)- f(x,y) = = f (x, y) = ¶ x ¶ x y Δy ﬁ 0 Δy Note that equations of the type d dy (xy) = y + x dx dx are not differential equations.
In this equation, if you expand the left hand side then you will find that the left hand side is the same as the right hand side.
Such equations are called identities.
Moreover, a differential equation may have more than one dependent variable.
For instance, d2x dy + + = y dt2 dt is a differential equation with dependent variable x and y and the independent variable t. Differential equations are classified into various types.
The most obvious classification of differential equations is based on the nature of the dependent variable and its derivatives (or derivatives) in the equation.
Accordingly, we divide differential equations into three classes: ordinary, partial and total.
The following definitions give these three types of equations.
Definition: A differential equation involving only ordinary derivatives (that is, derivatives with respect to a single independent variable) is called an ordinary differential equation (abbreviated as ODE).
Equations d2y + y = x2, dx2 4MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (cid:230) dy(cid:246) 2 (cid:231) (cid:247) = [sin (xy) + 2]2, and Ł dxł dy (cid:230) dy(cid:246) 2 y = x + r 1+ (cid:231) (cid:247) dx Ł dxł are all ordinary differentia equations.
The typical form of such equations is Ø dy(x) d2y(x) dny(x)ø gŒ x,y(x), , ,......, œ = 0 …(4) º dx dx2 dxn ß whenever we talk of Eqn.
(4) we assume that g is known real valued function and the unknown to be determined is y. secondly, in an ordinary differential equation, y and its derivatives are evaluated at x.
It may be noted that the equation (cid:230) dy(cid:246) (cid:231) (cid:247) = (y) Ł dxł x+1 x dy is not a differential equation.
This is because y is evaluated at (x + 1) whereas dx is evaluated at x.
Similarly, the equation dy(x) x = (cid:242) exsy(s)ds dx 0 is not a differential equation since the unknown y is appearing inside an integral.
Also, in this case the values of y on the right hand side of the equation depends on the interval 0 to x, whereas, in a differential equation, the unknown y has to be evaluated only at x.
Let us now define partial equation.
Definition: Differential equation containing partial derivatives of one ( or more) dependent variable with respect to two or more independent variable is called a partial differential equation.
(abbreviated AS PDE) 5MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION The examples of differential equations are ¶ 2v ¶ 2v ¶ 2v + + = 0 ¶ x2 ¶ y2 ¶ z2 ¶ z ¶ z x + y - z = 0, ¶ x ¶ y ¶ 3u ¶ u ¶ 2u + + xtu = 0.
¶ x3 ¶ x ¶ t2 You may also note that Eqns.
(1`) and (2) given earlier are ordinary differential equations, whereas, Eqn.
(3) is a partial differential equation.
And now an exercise for you.
Besides ordinary and partial differential equations, namely, total differential equations.
Before giving you the definition of total differential equations, we ascribe a meaning to the symbols dx and dy which permit us to manipulate the dy derivative as a quotient of two function y = f(x), we define, the differential of dx y, by Dy = f’ (x) dx If u = f(x,y) be a function of two independent variables x and y, then we know that ¶ u lim f(xΔ+x,y) f- (x,y) = ¶ x Δx ﬁ 0 Δx and ¶ u lim f(x,y+ Δy)- f(x,y) = ¶ y Δy ﬁ 0 Δy Let D u be the change in u when both x and y change by the amounts D x and D y lim D respectively, so that u = du.
Here du is called the total differential.
D xD, ﬁ y 0 The total differential du of a function u (x, y) is defined as 6MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION ¶ u ¶ u du = dx + dy …(5) ¶ x ¶ y or du = u dx + u dy x y For instance, If u = x2y – 3y then Du = 2xy dx + (x2 – 3) dy Now consider the relation u (x, y, z) = c where x, y, z are variables and c is a constant.
Then Du = 0 ¶ u ¶ u ¶ u (cid:222) dx + dy + dz = 0 ¶ x ¶ y ¶ z ¶ u ¶ u ¶ u Here, , , are known functions of x, y and z, and therefore the above ¶ x ¶ y ¶ z equation can be put in the form P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0 Which is called the total differential equation in three variables.
In this equation any one of the variables x, y, z can be treated as independent and the remaining two are then the dependent variables.
Similarly, if u = u(x, y, z, t) then corresponding total differential equation will be of the form P dx + Q dy + R dz + T dt = 0.
Remember that a total differential equation always involves three or more variables.
We now give the following definition.
7MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Definition: A total differential equation contains two or more dependent variables together with their derivatives with respect to a single independent variable which may, or may not, exist explicitly into the equation.
For example, equations Yz (1 + 4 xz) dx – xz (1 + 2 xz) dy – xydz = 0, and xdx+ ydy = zdz zdx- xdz + + 2ax2dx + 3by2dy + 3cz2dz = 0. x2 + y2 + z2 x2 - z2 are total differential equations.
We shall be dealing with only ordinary differential equations in Modules 1ansd 2 and devote Modules 3 and 4 study total and partial differential equations.
We next consider the concepts of order and degree of a differential equation on the basis of which differential equations can be further classified.
We all know that the nth derivative of a dependent variable with respect to one or more independent variables is called a derivative of order n, or simply an nth order derivative.
d2y ¶ 2z ¶ 2z d3z ¶ 2z For example, , , are second order derivatives and , are dx2 ¶ x2 ¶ x¶ y dx3 ¶ x¶2 y third order derivatives.
Definition: The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative appearing in the equation.
For instance, the equation d2y + y = x2 is of second order …(6) dx2 d2y (because the highest order derivative is , which is of second order), whereas dx2 (cid:230) dy(cid:246) 2 (x + y) (cid:231) (cid:247) - 1, is of first order …(7) Ł dxł 8MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy (highest order derivative is ).
dx Similarly, equation Ø d3yø 2 d2y dy Ø dyø 3 Œ œ + 2 - + x2 Œ œ = 0 is of third order …(8) º dx3ß dx2 dx º dxß ¶ 2z ¶ 2z ¶ z whereas, + + = 0 is of second order.
…(9) ¶ x2 ¶ y2 ¶ x Note that the order of a differential equation is a positive integer.
Also, if the order of a differential equation is ‘n’ then it is not necessary that the equation contains some or all lower order derivatives or independent variables d4y explicitly.
For instance, equation = 0, is a fourth order differential equation.
dx4 Definition: The degree of a differential equation is the highest exponent of the highest order derivative appearing in it after the equation has been expressed in the form free from radicals and any fractional power of the derivatives or negative power.
For example Equations.
(6) and (9) are of first degree and Equations.
(7) and (8) are of second degree.
Equation dy (cid:230) dy(cid:246) 3 y – x = r 1+ (cid:231) (cid:247) ….
(10) dx Ł dxł is of degree three for, in order to make the equation free from radicals, we need to square both the sides, so that Ø dyø 2 Ø (cid:230) dy(cid:246) 3ø Œ y-x œ = r2 Œ 1+ (cid:231) (cid:247) œ º dxß Œº Ł dxł œß dy since the highest exponent of the highest derivative, that is, is three, thus by dx definition the degree of Equation.
(10) is three.
9MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Similarly, Equation.
(2), that is, dy a y – x + is of degree two.
dx dy/dx dy dy This is because we multiplied through by to remove negative power of dx dx and get dy Ø dyø 2 Y = x Œ œ + a. dx º dxß You may now try the following exercise.
We now classify the differential equations depending upon the degree of dependent variables and its derivatives into two classes, namely, linear and non- linear.
Definition: When, in an ordinary or partial differential equation, the dependent variables and its derivatives occur to the degree only, and not as higher powers or products, we call the equation linear.
The coefficients of a linear equation are therefore either constants or functions of the independent variable or variables.
If an ordinary differential equation is not linear, we call it non-linear.
For example, the equation d2y + y = x2 , is an ordinary linear differential equation.. dx2 dy However (x + y)2 = 1 is an ordinary non-linear equation, because of the dx dy dy presence of terms like y2 and 2xy .
dx dx Similar, equation ¶ 2z ¶ 2z (cid:230) ¶ 2z (cid:246) 2 + - (cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 , is a non-linear partial differential equation.
¶ x2 ¶ y2 Ł ¶ x¶ ył 10MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Further, if a partial differential equation is not linear, it can be quasi-linear, semi- linear or non-liner.
We will discuss conditions for these classifications in the later part of this course.
You may now try this exercise.
Normally when we encounter an equation, our natural curiosity is to enquire about its solution.
But, then it is natural for you to ask as to what exactly is the meaning of a solution of a differential equation.
In the next section you will find an answer to this question.
There, we also answer many more questions like i) Under what conditions does the solution of a given ordinary differential equation exists?
ii) If the solution exists, then is it a unique solution?
3.2 Solution of a Differential Equation You have seen that the general ordinary differential equation of the nth order as given by Equation (4) is (cid:230) dy d2y dny(cid:246) g(cid:231) x,y, , ,...., (cid:247) = 0 Ł dx dx2 dxnł dy d2y dny using the prime notation for derivatives (y’ = , y” = ,….
Yn = ) we dx dx2 dxn can rewrite Equation .
(4) in the form y(n) = f(x, y, y’, y”, ….. y((n- 1)) …(11) Let us assume that we can solve Eqn.
(11) for y(n), that is, Eqn.
(11) can be written in the form Y(n) = f(x, y, y’, y”, ……., y(n-1)) ….
(12) It is normally a simple task to verify that a given function = ø(x) satisfies an equation like (11) or (12).
All that is necessary is to compute the derivatives of y and to show that y = ø(x) and its derivatives, when substituted in the equation, reduce it to an identity in x. if such a function y exists, we call it a solution of the Eqn.
(11) or (12).
However, usually we assume that 11MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION i) y = ø(x) is defined on some interval [a, b]; ii) y is n times differentiable on [a, b]; iii) We assume that y has a right derivative at point a and a left derivative at b; iv) y = ø(x) can be real valued function or complex valued function (range is a subset of C) of x.
We now give the definition of the solution of an ordinary differential equation.
Definition: A real or complex valued function y = ø(x) defined on an interval I is called a solution or an integral of the differential equation g(x, y, y’,…., y(n)) = 0 if ø(x) is n time differentiable and if x, ø(x), ø’(x), ….., ø(n) (x) satisfy this equation for all x in I.
For example, the first-order differential equation dy = 2x – 4x dx Note: I could represent any interval ]a,b[, [a, b] ]0, ¥ [,-]¥ ¥ , ] and so on has the solution y = 2x + 1 in the interval I = {x:-¥ < <x¥ } .
This can be checked by computing y’ = 2 and 2y - 4x = 2(1 + 2x) – 4x In the same way you can check that y = 1 + 2x + ce2x, in the interval -¥ < <x¥ , is also a solution of this equation for any constant c. In the above definition you might have noticed that a solution of (11) is real valued or complex valued.
In case y is real value it is called a real solution.
If y is complex valued, it is called complex solution.
We are usually interested in real solution of Eqn.
(11).
To help you clarify what we have just said let us take some more examples.
˛ Example 1: Show that for any constant c, the function y(x) = cex, x R is a solution of dy ˛ = y, x R …(13) dx ˛ Solution: Here I is R itself.
For any x R, we know that dy d dy = (cex) = c (ex) = cex = y dx dx dx which shows that y satisfies equation(13).
12MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Example 2: show that for real constants a and b the functions y (x) = a cos 2x and z(x) = b sin 2x are solutions of the equation bolow; d2y ˛ + 4y = 0, x R …(14) dx2 ˛ solution: We will first show that z (x), x R is a solution of Equation.
(14).
d d Now [z(x)] = (b sin 2x) = 2bcos 2x.
dx dx d2 \ d [z(x)] = (2bcos 2x) = - 4b sin 2x = - 4z(x).
dx2 dx thus, d2y + 4z(x) = 0, x R. ˛ dx2 That is, z satisfies Equation (14).
By now you must have understood the meaning of z satisfiying Equation (14)._.
It means that Equation (14).
holds when y is replaced by z. similarly, you can check that y(x) = a cos 2x is also a solution of Equation (14).
.
You may observe here that the sum y(x) + z(x) that is, a cos 2x + b sin 2x is again a solution of.
Equation (14).
Let us consider another example.
Example 3: Shown that y(x) = eix, x R is a solution of ˛ d2y + y = 0, x R ˛ dx2 Solution: We have, dy d = (eix)\ = i eix dx dx and 13MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION d2y d = (ieix) = i2 eix = -eix = - y(x) dx2 dx d2y thus, + y = 0 dx2 In the examples taken so far, you have seen that the solution(s)differential equation exist.
In Example (1) and (2) the solutions were real valued whereas, the solution in Example (3) was a complex valued function.
But, there are equations for which real solution does not exist.
Suppose that we are looking for real roots of the equation x2 + 1 = 0.
We know that it does not exist.
Likewise, the equation dy + y2 + 1 = 0 dx does not admit a real solution.
(cid:230) dy(cid:246) Similarly, the equation sin (cid:231) (cid:247) = 2 does not admit a real solution, because real Ł dxł value of the sin of a real function lies between – 1 and + 1.
You may now try the following exercises.
In the above discussion you must note that a differential equation may have more than one solution.
It may even have infinitely many solutions.
For instance, each 4 of the functions y = sin x, y = sin x + 3, y = sin x - is a solution of the 5 differential equation y’ = cosx.
but from your knowledge of calculus you also know that any solution of the equation is of the form.
Y = sin x + c …(15) Where c is a constant.
If we regard c as arbitrary then relation (15) represents the totality of all solutions of the equation.
Thus, we can represents even the infinitely many solutions by a simple formula involving arbitrary constants.
Accordingly, we classify various types of solutions of an ordinary differential equation as follows.
Definition: The solution of the nth order differential equation with arbitrary ‘n’nconstants is called its general solution.
14MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Definition: Any solution which is obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution.
For example, y = a cos 2x + b sin 2x, involving two arbitrary constants a and b, is d2y the general solution of the second order equation + 4y = 0 (ref.
Example 2) dx2 whereas, y = 2 sin 2x + cos 2x is its particular solution (taking a = 1 and b = 2).
In some cases there may be further solutions of given equation which cannot be obtained by assigning a definite value to the constant in the general solution.
Such a solution is called a singular solution of the equation.
For example, the equation y'2- xy’ + y = 0 …(16) x2 has the general solution y = cx – c2.
A futher solution of Eqn.
(16) is y = .
4 Since this solution cannot be obtained by assigning a definite value to c in the general solution, it is a singular solution of Eqn.
(16).
Thus, we have seen the various types of solution of an ordinary differential equation.
We have also seen that a solution of a differential equation may or may not exist.
Even if a solution exists, it may or may not be unique.
We now try to find the conditions under which the solution of a given ordinary differential equation exists and is unique.
Here, we shall confine our attention to the first order ordinary differential equations only.
Let us consider the general first order equation.
dy = f(x, y) …(17) dx In Eqn.
(17) we assume that f is known to us.
You may be surprised to know that, though this equation looks simple, it is very difficult to get its explicit solution.
For clearity, let us look at the following examples.
Example 4: Does the solution y(x) of an ordinary differential equation dy = f(x), where f(x) = 0 for x < 0 dx ‡ = 1 for x 0 " exist x R?
˛ 15MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The function defined by (cid:236) cforx < 0 Y(x) = (cid:237) (cid:238) x+ c for x ‡ 0 Satisfies this equation.
at the same time this function has no derivative at x = 0, because of the discontinuity of y(x) at x = 0.
Thus, this differential equation has no valid solution for x = 0.
However, y(x) defined above is the solution of the given differential equation at all points other than x = 0.
Let us look at another example.
dy Example 5: Does the equation = - e-y x have a unique solution?
dx Solution: Rewrite the above equation in the form dy (ey) = - x dx Integrating, we get the solution of given equation as x2 ey =- + A, 2 (cid:230) x2 (cid:246) or y = In (cid:231) - + A(cid:247) Ł 2 ł where A is an arbitrary constant.
You know that in x is defined for positive values of x only.
So, the solution of the (cid:230) x2 (cid:246) given differential equation will exists as long as (cid:231) - + A(cid:247) > 0.
Clearly A > 0.
Ł 2 ł Also, for different values of A we get different solutions.
Moreover these solutions have different intervals of existence.
Thus, the solution of a given differential equation is not unique.
16MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION As regards the non-unique solutions, it is obvious that the cause for the non- uniqueness is the arbitrariness of A, (but for A > 0).
Thus, we would like to impose some condition on the solution which might determine A. one such condition is to specify the value of y at some point x where x is in the interval of 0 0 existence of y. such a condition is called initial condition and the problem of solving a differential equation together with the initial conditions is called the initial value problem (IVP).
In other words, initial value problem is the problem in which we look for the solution of a given differential equation which satisfies certain conditions at a single of the independent variable.
Thus, the first order initial value problem s dy (cid:252) = f(x,y),(cid:239) dx (cid:253) …(18) y(x ) = y (cid:239)(cid:254) 0 0 From Example 4 and 5 mainly two questions arise: 1) Under what conditions does an initial value problem of the form (18) have at least one solution?
2) Under what conditions does that problem have a unique solution, that is, only one solution?
The above questions are answered by a theorem, known as Existence Uniqueness Theorem 1.
We shall now state this theorem for the first order differential equation.
Theorem 1: (Existence – Uniqueness): If f(x, y) is continuous at all points (x, y) in some rectangle (see Fig.
1.
Y y + b o R y o y –b o x-a x x+a x o o o Fig.

For example.
F = x2 + y2 is bounded, with K = 2 if |x| < 1 and |y| < 1.
We shall not be proving this theorem.
The proof of this theorem requires familiarity with many other concepts which are beyond the scope of this course.
However, we which, we give some remarks which may be helpful for a good understanding of the theorem.
Remark: Since y’ = f(, y), the condition (19) implies that |y’| £ k, that is, the slope of any solution curve y(x) in R is at least – k and atmost k. Hence a solution curve which passes through the point (x , y) must lie in the shaded region in Fig.

Therefore, h = a, which asserts that the solution exists k for all x between x – a and x + a (see Fig.

Since we have not assumed anything about f outside R, nothing can be concluded about the solution for those corresponding value of x.
The condition stated in Theorem 1 are sufficient but not necessary and can be relaxed.
For example, by the mean value theorem of differential calculus, we have (ref.
Theorem 1).
¶ f f(x, y ) – f(x, y ) = (y – y ) 2 1 2 1 ¶ y where (x, y ) and (x, y ) are assumed to be in R. From condition (20) then it 1 2 follows that |f(x, y ) – f(x, y ) | £ M| (y –y ) | 2 1 2 1 condition (20) may be replaced by the condition (21) which is known as a Lipschitx condition, named after the German mathematician, Rudolf Lipschitz (1831 – 1903).
Thus, we can say that for the existence of the solution of the IVP (18), we must have i) f continuous in T. ii) f bounded in T. Further the solution is unique if in addition to (i) and (ii), we have ¶f iii) continuous in T. ¶y ¶f iv) bounded in T (or, Lipschitx condition) ¶y 19MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION However, if the above conditions do not hold, then the IVP (18) may still have either (a) no solution (b) more than one solution (c) a unique solution.
This is because theorem provides only sufficient conditions and not necessary.
For instance, consider dy = 3y2/3, y (0) = 0. dx Here, f(x, y) = 3y2/3, ¶f = 3.2 y-1/3 for y „ 0.
¶f does not exists at y = 0. so ¶f ¶y 3 ¶y ¶y is not bounded but, the solutions y = x3 and y = 0 exist.
Let us examine conditions (i) – (iv) for a few differential equations through examples.
dy Example 6: Examine = y ,with y (0) = 1 for existence and uniqueness of the dx solution.
Solution: Here f(x, y) =y, f (x, y) = 1.
Also x = 0 and y = 1. y 0 0 In this case consider a rectangle T defined by T: |x – 0 |<a, |y – 1)<b Where a and b are positive numbers.
In any rectangle T (containing the point (0, 1)) the function f(x, y) is continuous and bounded.
Hence the solution exists.
Further f (x, y) is also continuous and y bounded in any such rectangle T. Therefore, the solution is unique.
You may verify that y = ex is a solution of the given equation satisfying the initial condition y (0) = 1.
Hence, it is the unique solution.
However, if the initial condition is changed to y(0) = 0 then rectangle T will be of the form T: |x – 0| < a, |y – 0| <b And in that case y = 0 will be the unique solution for all x and y in any rectangle T containing (0, 0).
20MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy Example 7: Examine = | y| when y (0) = 0, for existence and uniqueness of dx solutions.
Solution: Here f(x, y) = |y| , x = 0 and y = 0.
In this case consider the region 0 0 T with |x| < a, |y| < b, a and b positive numbers.
Function f(x,y) is continuous and bounded in any rectangle T, containing the point (0,0).
Hence solution exists.
In order to test the uniqueness of the solution, consider the Lipschitz condition.
|f(x,y )- f(x,y )| | |y |- |y || 2 1 = 2 1 |y - y | |y - y 2 1 2 1 for any region containing the line y = 0, Lipschitz condition is violated.
Because for y = 0 and y > 0, we have 1 2 |f(x,y )- f(x,y )| y 1 2 1 = 2 = ,( y > 0) | y - y | y y 2 2 1 2 2 and this can be made as large as we please by choosing y sufficiently small, 2 whereas condition (21) requires that the quotient on the left-hand side of (21) does not exceed a fixed constant M. therefore, the solution is not unique.
Further, it can be checked that the given problem has the following solutins i) y = 0 " x Ø 1 Œ x2for x ‡ 0 4 ii) y = Œ 1 Œ - x2for x £ 0 º 4 (cid:236) y(1- 2x)for x > 0 Example 8: Examine dy = f(x, y) = (cid:237) with y(1) = 1 dx (cid:238) y(2x- 1)for x < 0 for existence and uniqueness of solution.
Solution: Here x = 1 and y = 1.
Rectangle T can be any rectangle containing 0 0 point (1, 1).
You may note that the function is not defined at x = 0.
It is 21MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION discontinuous at x = 0.
Thus, at x = 0 the solution does not exist.
At all other points the function (cid:236) y(1- 2x)for x > 0 f(x, y) = (cid:237) (cid:238) y(2x- 1)for x < 0 is continuous and bounded in T with (x) = 1.
Hence, the solution, exists and is unique for all x other than x = 0. further, you may verify that y = xx- x2 for x > = 0 and y = ex2- xfor x < 0 is the unique solution of the given problem for all x other than x = 0 you may now try the following exercise.
From the definitions given in page 14, you may have realized that the general solution of a first order differential equation normally contains one arbitrary constant which is called a parameter.
When this paratmeter is various values, we obtain a one parameter family of curves.
Each of these curves is a particular solution or integral curve of the given differential equation, and all of them together constitute its general solution.
On the other hand, we expect that the curve of any one-parameter family are integral curves of some first order differential equation.
In general we pose a problem: given an n-parameter family of curves, can thus say that differential equations arise from a family of curves.
In the next section we shall take up this.
3.3 Family of Curves and Differential Equations Let us consider a family of straight lines Y = mx + c …(22) Which is a two-parameter family of curves, parameters being m and c. It is clear from Eqn.
(22) that y can be treated as a function of x, x ˛ R. Differentiating Eqn.
(22) w.r.t.x, we have y' = m …(23) Again, differentiating (23) we get y" = 0 …(24) 22MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Equation (23) and (24) are differential equations of order one and two respectively.
The way in which we have arrived at Eqn.
(23) or (24) is clear.
We have actually tried to eliminate the parameters, or constants, m and c and the result is Eqn.
(23) or (24).
In general, we represent one-parameter family of curves by an equation F(x, y, a) = 0 …(25) where a is a constant.
In Eqn.
(25), let us regard y as a function of x and differentiate if w.r.t.x.
Suppose we get G(x, y, y’, a) = 0 …(26) In case, we are able to eliminate the constant a between Eqn.
(25) and (26), then we have a relation connecting x, y and y', say h (x, y, y',) = 0 …(27) Equation (27) is an ODE of order one.
In particular, if Eqn.
(25) has the form y (x, y) = a ...(28) then the elimination of the constant a from Eqn.
(28) leads us to the differential equation ¶ ψ ¶ ψ + y' = 0 …(29) ¶ x ¶ y for example, x2 + y2 = a2 …(30) is the equation of the family of all concentric circles with centre at the origin (fig.
3) Fig.
3 23MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION For different values of a , we get different circles of the family.
Differentiating Eqn.
(30) with respect to x, we get dy 2x + 2y = 0. dx dy Or x + y = 0, as the differential equation of the given family of circles.
dx Continuing with equation y = mx + c, if we regard only c as an arbitrary constant to be eliminated, then y' = m, represents the required differential equation.
Geometrically, for a fixed m, y' = m represents a family or straight lines(in the plane) whose slope is m (see fig.
4).
1 1 1 = = M= M M =1 M 1 = M 45o 45o 45o 45o 45o O Fig.
4 On the other hand, if we assume that in equation y = mx + c both m and c are constants to be eliminated, then equation y" = 0 represents the required differential equation.
Geometrically, it is the family of the straight lines in the plane (see Fig.
5) Y 0 = C 2 1, =- M = C 1, = M 45o 45o (-2, 0) O (1, 0) x M = 1, C = 1 Fig.
5 24MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION You may now try the following exercise.
In the introduction of this unit we mentioned that there are many problems of physical and engineering interest which give rise to differential equations.
In other words, we can say that some problems have representations through the use of differential equations.
In the next section we shall take up such problems.
3.4 Differential Equations Arising From Physical Situations In this section we shall show that differential equations arise not only out of consideration of families of geometric curves, but an attempt to describe physical problems, in mathematical terms, also result in differential equations.
The initial-value problem dy (cid:252) = ky (cid:239) dx (cid:253) …(31) y(t ) = t (cid:239)(cid:254) 0 0 where k is a constant of proportionality, occurs in many physical theories involving either grow or decay.
For example, in biology it is often observed that the rate at which certain bacteria grow is proportional to the number of bacterial present at any time.
In physics an IVP such as Eqn.
(31) provides a model for approximating the remaining amount of a substance that is disintegrating, or decaying, through radioactivity.
The differential Eqn.
(31) could also determine the temperature of a cooling body.
In chemistry, the amount of a substance remaining during certain reactions is also described by Eqn.
(31).
Let us now see the formulation of some of these problems.
I: Population Model Let N(t) = denote the number or amount of a certain species at time t. then the d growth of N(t) is given by its derivative N(t).
Thus, if N(t) is growing at a dt d b constant rate, N(t) = , a constant.
It is sometimes more appropriate to dt consider the relative rate of growth defined by actual rate of growth N'(t) dN(t)/dt = relative rate of growth = = size of N(t) N(t) N(t) 25MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION The relative rate of growth indicates the percentage increase in N(t) or decrease in N(t).
For example, an increase of 100 individuals for a species with a population size of 500 would probably have a significant impact being an increase of 20 percent.
On the other hand, if the population were 1,000,000 then the addition of 100 would hardly be noticed, being an increase of 0.01 percent.
If we assume that the rate of change of N at time t is proportional to population N(t), present at the time t then, d (cid:181) N(t) N(t) dt which is written as d N(t) = k N(t), …(32) dt where k is a constant if N increases with t, then k > 0 in Eqn.
(32) If N decreases with t, k £ 0 in Eqn.
(32).
Normally, we have the knowledge of the population, say N , at some initial time t .
0 0 so along with Eqn.
(32) we have N(t ) = N .
…(33) 0 0 Thus, the population N(t) at time t can be found by solving Eqn.
(32) with condition (33).
We shall reconsider this problem with some modifications later in unit 3.
II: Newton’s Law of Cooling Here we deal with the temperature variations of a hot object kept in a surrounding which is kept at a constant temperature, say T .
Under certain conditions, a good 0 approximation to the temperature of an object can be obtained by using Newton’s law of cooling.
Let the temperature of the object be T. If T ‡ T , we know that the 0 object radiates heat to the surrounding resulting in the reduction of its (object’s) temperature.
Newton’s law of cooling states that the rate at which the temperature T(t) changes in a cooling body is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body and the constant temperature T of the surrounding 0 medium.
That is 26MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION d T(t) T(t) – T dt (cid:181) 0 d or T(t) = k (T(t) – T ), …(34) dt 0 where k is a constant of proportionality.
Constant k < 0, because the temperature of the body is reducing (we have assume that T(t) T ).
We observe that that Eqn.
(34) is a differential equation of order ‡ 0 one.
III: Radioactive Decay Many substances are radioactive.
This means that the atoms of such a substance break down into atoms of other substances.
In Physic, is has been noticed that the radioactive material, at time t, decays at rate proportional to its amount y(t).
in other words, d y(t) = ky(t) …(35) dt where k < 0, is a constant.
If the mass of the substance at some initial time, say t = 0, is A, then y(t) also satisfies the initial condition y(0) = A.
Thus, the physical problem of radioactive decay is modeled by the IVP.
d y(t) = ky(t), Y(0) = A …(36) dt where k is a constant.
Remark: I, II and III above indicate situations where differential equations occur naturally.
In unit 3 we shall give the methods of solving these equations.
You may now try the following exercise.

We discussed various types of solutions of an ordinary differential equation.
We also stated the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the first order ordinary differential equation.
However, we do not seem to have paid any attention to the methods of finding these solutions.
Accordingly, in this unit we shall confine our attention to the same.
In general, it may not be feasible to solve even the apparently simple equation dy dy = f(x, y) or g(x, y, ) = 0 where f and g are arbitrary functions.
This is dx dx because no systematic; procedure exists for obtaining its solution for arbitrary forms of f and g. However, there are certain standard types of first order equations for which methods of solution are available.
In this unit we shall discuss a few of them with special reference to their applications.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to • Define separable equations and solve them; 33MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION • Define homogeneous equations and solve them; • Obtain the solution of equations which are reducible to homogenous equations; • identify exact equations; • Obtain an integrating factor which may reduce a given differential equation into an exact one and eventually provide its solution.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Separation of Variables You know that the problem of finding the tangent to a given curve at a point was solved by Leibniz.
The search for the solution to the inverse problem of tangents, that is, given the equation of the tangent to a curve at any point to find the equation of the curve led Leibniz to many important developments.
A particular mention may be made of the method of separation of variables which was discovered by Leibniz in 1691 by providing that a differential equation of the form dy = X (x) Y (y) dx is integrable quadratures.
However, it is John Bernoulli (1694) who is credited with the introduction of the terminology and the process of separation of variables.
In short, it is a method for solving a class of differential equations that arises quite frequently and is defined as follows: Note: The process of finding the areas of plane regions if called quadrature Definition: An equation of the form dy = f(x, y) …(1) dx is called a separable equation or equation in variable separable form if f(x, y) can be put in the form f(x, y) = X(x) Y(y), …(2) where X and Y are given functions of x and y respectively.
In other words, Eqn.
(1) is a separable equation if f is a product of two functions, one of which is a function of x and the other is a function of y.
Here X (x) and Y(y) are real value functions of x and y respectively.
34MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy For instance, equation = ex+y is a separable equation, since ex+y = ex.ey (here dx dy X(x) = ex and Y(y) = ey).
The equation = x2(y2 + y3) is also a separable dx dy equation.
But the equation = exy is not a separable equation, because it is not dx possible to express exy as a product of two functions in which one is a function of x dy only and the other is a function of only.
Similarly, equation = x + y is not a dx separable equation.
In order to solve Eqn.
(1), when it is in variable separable form, we write it as dy a(y) + b (x) = 0 …(3) dx where a(y) and b(x) are each functions of only one variable let us assume that there exist functions A and B such that A’(y) = a(y) and B’(x) = b(x).
With this hypothesis, Eqn.
(3) can be rewritten as d A (y(x)) + B’(x) = 0 …(43) dx d dy dy [by chain rule A (y(x)) = A’ (y(x)) = a (y(x)) ] dx dx dx Integrating Eqn.
(4) with respect to x, we get A (y(x)) + B(x) = c …(5) Where c is a constant.
Thus, any solution y of (3) is implicitly given by (5).
We now take up a few examples to illustrate this method.
dy Example 1: Solve = ex-y dx Solution: This equation may be written as dy = ex e-y dx 35MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy or ey = ex dx d or (ey) = ex dx which, on integration, gives ey = ex+ c, where c is a constant.
In case ex + c ‡ 0, then y(x) = In (ex + c).
Example 2: Solve the equation (1 + y2) dx + (1 + x2) dy = 0 with y (0) = - 1.
Solution: The given equation can be rewritten as dx dy + = 0.
1+ x2 1+ x2 Integrating, we get Tan-1x + tan-1y = c. The initial condition that y = -1 when x = 0 permits us to determine the value of c that must be used to obtain the particular solution desired here.
Since tan-10 = 0 p p and tan-1(- 1) = - , c = 0 - .
Thus, the solution of the initial value problem is 4 4 p tan-1x + tan-1y = - .
4 Let us look at another example.
dy Example 3: Solve = ky – my2, where k > 0 and m > 0 are real constants.
dx Solution: Let us write the given equation as 1 dy = 1. ky- my2 dx dy Now we will try do decompose the coefficient of into partial fractions.
dx 36MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 A B = + Let …(6) y(k- my) y k- my Where A and B are constants to be determined.
From (6), we get 1 = A (k – my) + By Bk which gives 1 = Ak and 1 = m 1 m or A = and B = k k 1 1 m 1 Hence = + y(k- my) ky k (k- my) Thus the given differential equation can be rewritten as (cid:230) (cid:246) 1 m 1 dy (cid:231) + .
(cid:247) = 1, …(7) Ł ky k k- mył dx „ „ for y 0 and k-my 0.
In the integration of Eqn.
(7) the sign of y and k –my play a important role.
We now discuss the following possible cases: k Case 1: y > 0 and k-my > 0 (0 < y < ).
m For the case under consideration, Eqn.
(7) can be exdpressed as d Ø (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) 1 ø Œ (cid:231) Iny(cid:247) - In(k- my)œ = 1 dx º Ł k ł k ß which on integrating, yields 1 1 INy - In (k-my) = x + c, k k where c is a constant of integration.
The above equation can be further express as In (y)1/k – In (k – my)1/k = x + c Ø ø 1/k y or Œ œ = exp(x + c) º k- myß Case II: y < 0 When y < 0 then k – my > 0 because m > 0,.
In this case, Eqn.
(7) on integration can be written as 37MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 1 – - In (- y) In (k – my) = x + c k k 1 or = ex +c (- y)1/k(k- my)– 1/k k Cases III: y> 0 and k – my < 0 (y > ).
m In this case Eqn.
(7) after integration gives 1 1 In(y) - In( - k + my) = x + c k k Ø ø 1/k y or Œ œ = ex +c º - k+ myß You may now try the following exercises.
Many differential equations that are not separable can be reduced to the separable form by a suitable substitution.
In the next section we shall study one classof such equations.
3.2 Homogeneous Equations In this section we shall study equations like dy x2 + xy+ y2 = dx 3x2 + y2 This is an example of homogenous differential equations.
In 16921 Leibniz made known to the world the method of solving homogeneous equation differential equations of the first order.
Before we discuss the method of solving a homogeneous equation, we define homogeneuous functions of two variables x and y.
Definition: A real-value function h(x, y) of two variables x and y is called a homogeneous function of degree n, where n is a real number, if we have h(l xl, y) = l nh(x, y) for " x, y and any constant l > 0.
38MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION For example, h(x,y) = x3 + 2x2y + 3xy2 + 4y3 is homogeneous of degree three because h(l xl, y) = l 3h(x, y) (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:231) (cid:247) Ł xł Also, h(x,y) = x2 + (In|x| - In|y|) xy is homogeneous function of degree 2 cos x2 and is homogeneous of degree 0. x2 + 2xy+ y2 But, the function h(x, y) = x2 + 2xy + 4 is not homogeneous because h(l xl, y)„ l n(x+2 x+y 4) for any value of n. if h(x, y) is a homogeneous function of degree n, that is, h(l x, l y) = l nh(x,y), 1 1 l then a useful relation is obtained by letting = .
This gives h(x,y) = h x xn (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:231) 1, (cid:247) = ˘ (cid:231) (cid:247) (say) or , h(x,y) = xn˘ (cid:231) (cid:247) .
Ł xł Ł xł Ł xł We shall be particularly interested in the case where h(x,y) is homogeneous of degree 0 that is, if h(l x, l y) = l 0h(x,y) = h(x,y).
We now give the following definition.
Definition: A differential equation y' = f(x,y) …(8) is called a homogenous differential equation when f is a homogeneous function of degree 0.
For instance, the following equations are homogeneous differential equations: dy 2y = i) , dx x dy 2x+ 3y 2+ 3(y/x) = = ii) dx 4x 4 dy x3 + x2y+ y3 1+ (y/x)+ (y/x)3 = = iii) dx 3x2y+ y3 3(y/x)+ (y/x)3 from the above equations, you may have noticed that if an equation can be put in the form 39MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy f (x,y) = f(x, y) = 1 , dx f (x,y) 2 where f and f are homogeneous expressions of the same degree in x and y, then f 1 2 is a homogeneous function of degree 0.
1 l Further, if in Eqn.
(8) we let = , the we have x (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:230) y(cid:246) y' = f(cid:231) 1, (cid:247) = F(cid:231) (cid:247) …(9) Ł xł Ł xł y This suggests making the substitution v = to solve this equation.
since we seek x y as a function of x this substitution means y(x) V(x) = or y(x) = xv(x) x dy dv and = v + x dx dx with this substitution Eqn, (9) reduces to dv v + x = f(v) dx dv F(v)- v or = …(10) dx x which shows that Eqn.
(10) is a separable equation in v and x. if we can solve Eqn.
(10) for v in term of x, using the technique of Sec.
2.2 then the solution of Eqn.
(9) is y = vx and hence we can solve equations of the type (9).
We now illustrate this method with the help of the following examples.
dy 2y2 + 3xy Example 4: Solve = dx x2 Solution: You can easily check that the given equation is homogeneous of degree 0. it can be rewritten as dy (cid:230) y(cid:246) 2 (cid:230) y(cid:246) = 2 (cid:231) (cid:247) + 3 (cid:231) (cid:247) …(11) dx Ł xł Ł xł 40MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION y By making the substitution, v = , Eqn.
(11) reduces to x dv x + v = 2v2 + 3v dx dv or x = 2v2 + 2v = 2v(v + 1) dx dv 2dx = or v(v+1) x which is in variable separable form.
1 Resolving into partial fractions, we have v(v+1) (cid:230) 1 1 (cid:246) 2 - (cid:231) (cid:247) dv = dx Ł v v+1ł x which on integration, gives In |v| - In|v+1| = Inx2 + In |c| …(12) Where c is an arbitrary constant.
From Eqn.
(12), we have v = cx2 v+1 y replacing v by , we get x y/x Y = cx2 = (y/x)+1 X+ Y cx3 or y = , 1- cx2 which is the general solution of the given eqution.
dy y3 y Example 5: Solve = + , x > 0. dx x3 x Solution: With the substitution y = vx, we have 41MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dv V + x = v3 + v dx 1 dv 1 or = …(13) v3 dx x Integration of Eqn.
(13) yields 1 - = Inx + In |c|, 2v2 y where c is a real constant.
On replacing v = , the general solution of the given x equation can be expressed as x2 x2 1 y2 = - 2[Inx+ In|c|] or y2 = - 2 In(x|c|) Let us consider another example.
Example 6: Solve (x2 + y2) dx – 2xy dy = 0.
Solution: The given equation can be written as dy x2 + y2 = …(14) dx 2xy Putting y = vx, in Eqn.
(14), we get dv 1+ v2 V + x = , dx 2v dv 1+ v2 or x = - v dx 2v 1+ v2 - 2v2 1- v2 = = 2v 2v 2v dv 1 or = 1- v2 dx x Integrating, we get, In |x| |(1 – v2)| = In |c|, where c is a constant of ingration or X (1- v2) = c 42MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION On substituting for v, we can write the solution of Eqn.
(14) in the form; x2 – y2 = cx.
How about trying some exercise now?
Sometimes it may happen that a given equation is not homogeneous but cann be reduced to a homogeneous form by considering a transformation of the variables.
We now consider such equations.
Equations reducible to homogeneous form Consider the wquation of the form dy ax+ by+ c = …(15) dx a'x+ b'y+ c' where a, b, c, a', b' and c' are all constants.
Eqn.
(15) can be reduced to a homogeneous form by using the substitution X = x' + h and y = y' + k, Where h and k are constants to be so chosen as to make the given equation homogeneous.
In terms of these new variables, Eqn.
(15) becomes dy dy' ax'+ by'+ (ah+ bk+ c = = , …(16) dx dx' a'x'+ b'y'+ (a'h+ b'k+ c') which will be homogeneous provided h and k are so chosen that ah + bk + c = 0 a'h + b'k + c' = 0 …(17) Consequently Eqn.
(16) reduces to dy' ax'+ by' = …(18) dx' a'x'+ b'y' which can be solved by means of the substitution y' = vx'.
If the solution of the Eqn.
(18) is of the form g(x', y') = 0, then the solution of Eqn.
(15) is 43MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION g(x – h, y – k) = 0, where h and k are obtained by solving the simultaneous Eqns.
(17) Solving Eqns.
(17) for h and k, we get, bc'- bc' a'c- ac' h = , k = ab'- a'b ab'- a'b which are defined except when a b = ab' – a'b = 0 that is, when .
a' b' a b = If , then h and k have either infinite values or are indeterminate.
But then a' b' a b = the question is what happens if ?
a' b' a b 1 = In such cases, we let = (say) a' b' m Then Eqn.
(15) can be written as dy ax+ by+ c = …(19) dx m(ax+ ny)+ c' On putting ax to by = v, Eqn (19) reduces to 1Ø dv ø v+ c Œ - aœ = bº dx ß mv+ c' so that the variables are separated and hence the equation can be solved by the method given in the Sec 2.2.
We now take up some examples to illustrate the above discussion.
dy y- x+ 1 Example 7: Solve = …(20) dx y+ x+ 5 Solution: Comparing the given equation with Eqn.
(15), we have a = 1, b = -1, a' = 1, b' = 1.
44MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION a b a b \ =1, = - |1and „ a' b' a' b' Putting x = x' + h and y = y' + k in Eqn.
(20), we get dy' y'- x+' k- +h 1 = …(21) dx' y'x'+ k+ h+ 5 we choose h and k such that k- h + 1 = 0 k + h + 5 = 0 …(22) on solving Eqn.
(22), we get h = - 2 and k = -3 .
with these values of h and k, Eqn.
(21) reduces to dy' y'- x' = …(23) dx' y'+ x' which is a homogeneous equation.
on putting y' = vx' in Eqn.
(23) and simplifying the resulting equation, we get 1+ v dv 1 - = 1+ v2 dx' x' (cid:230) 1 v (cid:246) dv 1 + = - or (cid:231) (cid:247) …(24) Ł 1+ v2 1+ v2ł dx' x' Integration of Eqn.

Thus, a b = .
Therefore, we put 2x + 3y = v, and Eqn.
(25) reduces to, a' b' 1(cid:230) dv (cid:246) v+ 5 (cid:230) dy dv(cid:246) (cid:231) - 2(cid:247) = (cid:231) here 2+ 3 = (cid:247) 3Ł dx ł 2v+ 5 Ł dx dxł dv 3(v+ 5) 3v+15+ 4v+10 7v+ 25 or = + 2 = = dx 2v+ 5 2v+ 5 2v+ 5 Now variables are separated and we get 2v+ 5 dv = 1 7v+ 25 dx Ø ø 2 15 dv - or Œ œ = 1. º 7 7(7v+ 25)ß dx Integrating, we get 2 15 (cid:230) 25(cid:246) v - In (cid:231) v+ (cid:247) = x + c, where c is a constant of integration, substituting 7 49 Ł 7ł v = 2x+ 3y, we get 2 15 (cid:230) 25(cid:246) (2x + 3y) - In (cid:231) 2x+ 3x+ (cid:247) = x + c, 7 49 Ł 7ł 25 or, 14(2x + 3y) – 15 In (2x + 3y + ) = 49 (x + c) 7 46MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION or, 42y – 21x – 15 In (14x + 21y + 25) = 49c – 15 In 7 = c , say, which is the 1 required solution.
You may now try the following exercise.
In each of the equations in this exercise a b = you should first see whether and then decide on the method.
a' b' In Unit 1, we defined the total differential of a given function.
In the next section we shall make use of this to define and solve exact differential equations.
3.3 Exact Equations Let us start with a family of curves h(x, y) = c. Then its differential equation can be written in terms of its total differential as dh = 0, or ¶ h ¶ h dx + dy = 0.
¶ x ¶ y For example, the family x2y3 = c has 2xy3dx + 3x2y3dy = 0 as its differential equation.
suppose we now consider the reverse situation and begin with the differential equation a(x, y)dy + b(x,y)dx = 0 If there exists a function h(x,y) such that ¶ h ¶ h = b(x, y) and = a(x, y), ¶ x ¶ y then Eqn.
(26) can be written in the form ¶ h ¶ h dx + dy = 0 or dh = 0 ¶ x ¶ y that is, h(x, y) = constant represents a solution of Eqn.
(26).
In this case we call the expression a(x, y)dy + b(x, y)dx an exact differential and (26) is called an exact differential equation.
For instance, equation x2y3 dx + x (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) +3y+2 dy = 0 is exact, since we have d(cid:231) x3y3(cid:247) = x2y3 dx + x+3y2dy.
Ł 3 ł Thus, an exact differential equation is formed by equating an exact differential to zero.
47MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION It is sometimes possible to determine exactness and find the function h by merer inspection.
Consider, for example, the equations.
3x2y4dx + 4x3y3 dy = 0 and xexy dy + (yexy – 2x) dx = 0.
These two equations can be alternatively written as d(x3y4) = 0 and d(exy – x2) = 0, respectively.
Thus, the general solution of these equations are give by x3y4 = c and exy = x2 + c, where c is constant.
However except for some cases, this technique of “solution by insight” is clearly impractical.
Consequently we seek an answer to the following question: when does a function h(x, y) exist such that Eqn.
(26) is exact?
An answer to this question is given by the following theorem.
¶ a ¶ b Theorem 1: If the functions a(x, y), b(x, y), a and b = are continuous x ¶ x y ¶ y functions of x and y, then Eqn.
(26), namely, a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 is exact if and only if ¶ ¶ b(x, y) = a(x, y) …(27) ¶ y ¶ x Indeed condition (27) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a function h(x, y) to be such that ¶ ¶ h(x, y) = b(x, y) and h(x, y) = a(x, y) …(28) ¶ y ¶ y you may note here that if relation (28) is satisfied, then ¶ ¶ d[h(x, y (x))] = h(x,y (x)) dx + h(x,y(x)) dy ¶ x ¶ y = b(x, y(x))dx + a(x, y(x)) dy and hence Eqn.
(26) can be rewritten as d[h(x, y(x))] = 0 or that the solution of Eqn.
(26) is given by h (x, y) = c, where c is a constant.
We now give the proof of Theorem 1.
Proof: The condition is necessary 48MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Let the equation dy A(x, y) + b(x, y) = 0 dx Or, a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 Be exact.
Then there exists a function h(x, y) such that Dh = b(x, y) dx + a(x, y) dy ¶ h ¶ h But dh = dx + dy.
¶ x ¶ y ¶ h ¶ h \ dx + dy = b(x, y) dx + a(x, y) dy ¶ x ¶ y Thus, necessarily, ¶ h ¶ h = b(x, y) and = a(x, y) …(29) ¶ x ¶ y Since a(x, y) and b(x, y) have continuous first order partial derivatives, h possess ¶ 2h ¶ 2h continuous second order partial derivatives namely, and .
Refer Unit ¶ y¶ x ¶ y¶ y 6, Block 2 of MTE-07 for second and higher order partial derivatives.
Now, ¶ (cid:230) ¶ h(cid:246) ¶ 2h ¶ b (cid:231) (cid:247) = = (x, y) …(30) ¶ yŁ ¶ xł ¶ y¶ x ¶ y ¶ (cid:230) ¶ h(cid:246) ¶ 2h ¶ a (cid:231) (cid:247) = = and (cid:231) (cid:247) (x, y) …(31) ¶ yŁ ¶ ył ¶ x¶ y ¶ x ¶ b ¶ a Since and are continuous, ¶ y ¶ x ¶ 2h ¶ 2h = (ref.
Unit 6, Block 2 of MTE-07).
¶ y¶ x ¶ x¶ y There, from Eqn.
(30) and (31), we get ¶ a ¶ b (x, y) = (x, y) ¶ x ¶ y The condition is sufficient: Now suppose that ¶ a ¶ b (x, y) = (x, y) ¶ x ¶ y and we shall show that a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx is an exact differential 49MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION ¶ V Let (cid:242) b(x, y) = dx = V, then = b(x, y) ¶ x and ¶ 2V ¶ b = (x, y) ¶ y¶ x ¶ y ¶ a = (x, y) (using given condition) ¶ x ¶ a ¶ (cid:230) ¶ V (cid:246) \ (x, y) = (cid:231) (cid:247) …(32) ¶ x ¶ y Ł ¶ x ł Integration of Eqn.
(32) with respect to x, holding y fixed, yields ¶ V a(x, y) = + ø (y) ¶ y where ø, a function of y only, is therefore a constant of integration, when y is held fixed.
Thus, ¶ V ¶ V a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = dy + ø(y) dy + dx ¶ y ¶ x = d[V(x, y) + ø(y) dy] which establishes that a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx is an exact differential implying thereby that, a(x, y) dy + b(x, y)dx = 0 is an exact differential equation.
This completes the proof of Theorem 1.
We shall now illustrate this theorem with the help of the following examples.
Example 9: Solve the differential equation Sin(y) + x cos (y)y' = 0.
Solution: For the case under consideration, a(x, y) = xcos(y) and b(x, y) = sin(y).
also ¶ ¶ a(x, y) = cos(y) = b(x, y) ¶ x ¶ y which shows that the given equation is an exact equation.
50MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION ¶ h ¶ h Therefore, there exists a function h(x, y) = constant such that, = b(x, y) and ¶ x ¶ y = a(x, y) Then we have ¶h = sin y …(33) ¶x and ¶ h = x cos y …(34) ¶ y Integrating Eqn.
(33) with respect to x, treating y as a constant, we get H(x, y) = x sin y + ø (y) …(35) Where ø(y) is a constant of integration.
Differentiating Eqn.
(35) partially w.r.t.y, we get ¶ h(x, y) = x cos y + ø'(y) …(36) ¶y from Eqns.
(34) and (36), we get x cos y = x cos y + ø'(y) (cid:222) which shows that ø'(y) = 0 ø(y) = constant = c .
Hence from Eqn.
(35), we can 1 write h(x, y) = xsin y + c 1 so the required solution, h(x, y) = constant, is x sin y + c = c , where c is a constant or, 1 2 2 x sin y = c, where c = c – c is a constant.
2 1 Example 10: Solve ex sin y + ex cosy y' + 2x = 0.
Solution: Comparing with Eqn.
(26), we have a(x, y) = excos y and b(x, y) = exsin y + 2x.
Therefore, ¶ a(x, y) = excos y ¶x ¶ ¶ and b(x, y) = excos y = a(x, y).
¶y ¶x 51MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Hence the given equation is exact and can be written in the form dh(x, y(x) = 0 where ¶ h(x, y) = excos y + 2x …(37) ¶x ¶ and h(x, y) = ex cos y …(38) ¶y Integrating Eqn.
(37) w.r.t.x, we get h(x, y) = ex sin y + x2 + ø(y) …(39) Where ø, a function of y only, is a constant of integration From Eqns.
(38) and (39), we get ¶ h(x, y) = excos y + ø' (y) = ex cos y ¶y So we have ø' (y) = 0 or ø (y) = c where c is a constant.
1 1 Hence from Eqn.
(39) we have the required solution as h(x, y) = ex sin y + x2 = - c = c 1 where c is a constant.
On the basis of Theorem 1 and Example (9) and (10) we can say that various steps involved in solving an exact differential equation b(x, y) dx + a(x, y) dy = 0 are as follows: Step 1: Integrate b(x, y) w.r.t.x, regarding y as a constant.
Step 2: Integrate, with respect to y, those terms in a(x, y) which do not involve x.
Step 3: The sum of the two expressions obtained in steps 1 and 2 equated to a constant is the required solution.
We now illustrate these various steps with the help of an example.
Example 11: Solve (x2 – 4xy – 2y2) dx + (y2 – 2x2) dy = 0.
Solution: Here a(x, y) = y2 – 4xy – 2x2 and b(x, y) = x2 – 4xy – 2y2 52MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION ¶ a ¶ b \ = - 4y – 4x and = - 4x – 4y ¶ x ¶ y ¶ a ¶ b \ = ; hence it is an exact equation.
¶ x ¶ y Step1: Integrating b(x, y) w.r.t.x.
regarding y as a constant, we have x3 (cid:242) (x2 – 4xy – 2y2) dx = - 2xxy – 2xy2.
3 Step 2: We integrate those terms in a(x, y) w.r.t.y, which do not involve x. there is only one such term namely, y2.
y3 \ (cid:242) y2 dy = .
3 Step 3: The required solution is the sum of expressions obtained from Steps 1 and 2 equated to a constant, that is.
x3 y3 - 2x2y – 2xy2 + = c , 1 3 3 or x3 – 6x2y – 6xy2 + y3 = c. where c and c are constants.
1 Note that the test for an exact differential equation and the general procedure for finding the solution can sometimes be simplified.
We can pick out those terms of a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 that obviously form an exact differential or can take the form f(u) du.
The remaining, expression which is less cumbersome than the original can then be tested and integrated.
This is illustrated by the following example.
xdy- ydx Example 12: Solve xdx +ydy + = 0. x2 + y2 Solution: Note that the first two terms on the left hand side of the given equation are exact differentials and hence need not be touched.
Dividing the numerator and denominator of the last term by x2, we get d(y/x) Xdx + ydy + = 0 1+ (y/x)2 53MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Now each term of the above equation is an exact differential.
Integrating, we get x2 y2 y + + tan-1 = c 2 2 x as the required solution with c as a constant.
You may now try the following exercises.
In practice the differential equations of the form a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 are rarely exact, since the condition in Theorem 1 requires a precies balance of the functions a(x, y) and b(x, y).
but they can often be transformed into exact equatins on multiplication by a suitable function F(x, y) „ 0.
This function is then called an integrating factor.
The question we, now, must ask is: if a(x, y( dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 is not exact, then how to find a function „ F(x, y) 0 so that F(x, y) [a dy + b dx] = 0 Is exact?
In the next section we shall give an answer to this question.
3.4 Integrating Factor We begin with a very simple equation, namely, y' + y = 0 …(40) ¶ In this case a(x, y) = 1 and b(x, y) = y.
Here a(x, y) = 0 ¶ x ¶ and b(x, y) = 1 and hence the given equation is not exact.
Let us multiply Eqn.
¶ y (40) by e to get x exy' + exy = 0 …(41) you may now check that Eqn.
(41) is an exact equation.
Thus Eqn.
(40) is not exact whereas when we multiply EQn.
(40) by ex the resulting equation becomes an exact one.
Here ex is termed as integrating factor for Eqn.
(40).
We now give the following definition.
54MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Definition: A factor, which when multiplied with a non-exact differential equation makes it exact, is known as an integrating factor (abbreviated as I.F.).
The term I.F., to solve a differential equation, was first introduced by Fatio de Duillier in 1687.
For a given equation, there may not be a unique integrating factor.
Consider, for example, the equation ydx – xdy = 0 …(42) 1 You can check that Eqn.
(42) is not exact, but when multiplied by , it becomes y2 ydx- xdy = 0 y2 (cid:230) x(cid:246) (cid:231) (cid:247) which is exact.
This can now be written as d (cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 and thus has for its solution Ł ył x = c with c being an arbitrary constant.
y 1 Further, when Eqn.
(42) is multiplied by , it becomes xy dx dy - = 0, x y which is given exact and has its solution as Inx –Iny = c. you may notice that this solution can be transformed into the earlier solution 1 1 obtained through the I.F.
.
Also Eqn.
(42) when multiplied by reduces to y2 x2 y dy (cid:230) y(cid:246) y an exact equation dx - = 0 or, - d(cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 with | - = c as its solution.
x2 x Ł xł x 55MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 1 Thus, we have seen that some of the integrating factors for Eqn.
(42) are , y2 xy 1 and x2 Now the question arises: Is this the case only with Eqn.
(42) or, in general, does an equation of the form a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 have infinitely many integrating factors?
An answer to this question is given in Theorem 2.
Before we give you this theorem, here is an exercise for you.
Theorem 2: The number of integrating factors for the equation A(x, y) dy + b)x, y) dx = 0 9s infinite proof: Let g(x, y) be an integrating factor of the given equation.
Then, by definition Ø dy ø g(x, y) Œ a(x,y) + b(x,y)œ = 0 …(43) º dx ß is an exact differential equation.
Therefore, there exist a function h(x, y) such that Ø dy ø dh = g(x, y) Œ a(x,y) + b(x,y)œ = f(h)dh = d [(cid:242) f(h) dh] …(44) º dx ß since the term on the right hand side of Eqn (44) is an exact differential, the term in the left must also be an exact differential.
Therefore, g(x, y).f(h) is an integrating factors of the given differential equation.
Since f(h) is an arbitrary function of h, hence the number of integrating factors for equation a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 0 is infinite.
This fact is, however, of no special assistance in solving the differential equations.
So far, in our discussion we have not paid any attention to the problem of finding the integrating factors.
In general, it is quite difficult to obtain an integrating factor for a given equation.
However, rules for finding the integrating factors do exist, we shall now take up these rules one by one.
56MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Rules for finding integrating factors.
Rule 1: Integrating factors of obtainable inspection: Sometime integrating fators of a differential equation can be seen at a glance, as in the case of EQn.
(42) abve.
We give below some more examples in this regard.
Example 13: Solve (1 + xy) ydx + (1 – xy)xdy = 0, x>0, y > 0.
…(45) Solution: Rearranging the terms of Eqn.
(45), we get ydx + xdy + xy2dx – x2ydy = 0 (cid:222) d(xy) + xy2dx – x2ydy = 0 …(46) 1 It is immediately seen that multiplication by makes Eqn.
(46) eact and the x2y2 equation becomes d(xy) dx dy + - = 0 x2y2 x y integrating, we get 1 - + Inx – Iny = Inc, xy or x = cy e1/(xy) (where c is a constant).
Example 14: Solve (x4ex – 2my2x) dx + 2mx2y dy = 0.
Solution: We can write the given equation as x4ex dx + 2m (x+2ydy – xy2dx) = 0 (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:222) x4ex dx + 2mx3y d(cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 Ł xł Dividing by x4, we get y (cid:230) y(cid:246) dx + 2m d(cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 x Ł xł Ø (cid:230) y(cid:246) 2ø (cid:222) dŒ ex+ m(cid:231) (cid:247) œ = 0 Œº Ł xł œß 1 thus has served the role of an integrating factor in this case.

Ł xł We would like to mention that determination of an integrating factor by inspection is a skill and can be developed through practice only.
At this stage you may try the following exercises by finding an integrating factor through inspection.
Rule II: For a homogeneous equation a(x, y)dy + b(x, y) dx -= 0, when bx + ay 1 „ 0, then is an integrating factor.

Ł ył Ł ył 1 Since right hand side of Eqn.
(47) is an exact differential, it shows that is ay+ bx an integrating factor for the homogeneous equation a(x, y)dy + b(x, y)dx = 0.
We illustrate this rule by the following example.
Example 15: Solve (x2y – 2xy2) dx – (x3 – dx2+y) dy = 0.
Solution: Here the given equation is homogeneous and a(x, y) = x3 + 3x2y and b(x, y) = x2y – 2xy2 \ bx + ay = x(x2y – 2xy2) + y( - x3 + 3x2y) = x2y2 „ 0, 1 \ is an integrating factor.
x2y2 1 Multiplying the given differential equation by , we get x2y2 (cid:230) 1 2(cid:246) (cid:230) x 3(cid:246) (cid:231) - (cid:247) (cid:231) - (cid:247) (cid:231) (cid:247) dx - (cid:231) (cid:247) dy = 0, Ł y xł Ł y2 ył dx dy dx x or + 3 - 2 - dy = 0, y y x y2 (cid:230) dx x (cid:246) dy dx or (cid:231)(cid:231) - dy(cid:247)(cid:247) + 3 - 2 = 0, Ł y y2 ł y x (cid:230) x(cid:246) (cid:231) (cid:247) or d(cid:231) (cid:247) + d(3 Iny + 2 Inx) = 0.
Ł ył Therefore, the solution is x + 2 Iny – 2 Inx = c and c are constants.
y 1 a y dy y Note: In case bx + ay = 0, then = - and the given equation reduces to = b x dx x , Whose solution is straightaway obtained as x = cy.
You may now try this exercise.
59MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION „ Rule III: when bx – ay 0 and the different equation a(x, y) dy + b(x, y) dx = 1 0 can be written in the form yf (x y) dx + xf (xy) dy = 0 then is an 1 2 bx- ay integrating factor.

And now an exercise for you.
Rule VI: If the differential equation is of the form xαyβ (mydx + nxdy) = 0, where α,β, m and n are certain constants, then xkm-I- αykn-I-β is an integrating factor, where k can assume any value.
Proof: Multiplying the given equation by I.F., we get Xkm-1 ykn-1 (mydx + nxdy) = 0, or km xkm-1 ykn dx + kn xkmykn-1 dy = 0 or (xkm-1ykn) = 0, which is an exact differential.
It may be noted that if the given differential equation is of the form xαyβ(mydx + nxdy) + xα1yβ1(m ydx + n xdy) = 0 1 1 then also I.F.
can be determined.
By Rule VI, xkm- 1- αykn- 1- β will make the first term exact, while xk1m1- 1- α1 yk1n1- 1- β will make the second term exact, where k and k can have any value.
1 Now these two factors will be identical if a kn-1- = k m – 1- 1 1 a 1 and kn -1-β= k1n1-1- β 1.
Values of k and k can be found tp satisfy these two algebraic equations.
Then 1 either factor is an integrating factor of the above equation.
We now consider an example to illustrate this rule.
Example 19: Solve (y3 – 2yx2) dx + (2xy2 – x3) dy = 0.
Solution: On rearranging the term of the given equation, we can write Y2(ydx + 2xdy) – x2(2ydx + xdy) = 0 …(50) For the first term, a = 0, β = 2, m = 1 and n = 2 and hence its I.F.is xk-1y2k-1-2 For the second term α = 2, β = 0, m = 2, n = 1 and hence for the second term 1 1 1 1 I.F.
is 64MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION x2k1- 1- 2yk1- 1 these two integrating factors will be identical if k-1 = 2k -1-2 1 and 2k-1-2 = k – 1 …(51) 1 solving the system fo Eqn.
(51) for k and k , we get k = 2 and k = 2 and, 1 1 therefore, integrating factor for Eqn.
(50) is x2-1 y4-1-2, i.e., xy.
Multiplying Eqn.
(50) by xy, we get xy3 (ydx + 2xdy) – x3y (2ydx + xdy) = 0 (cid:222) xy4dx + x2y3dy – (2x3y2dx + x4ydy = 0 1 1 (cid:222) (2xy4dx + 4x2y3dx) – (4x3y2dx + 2x4y4dy) = 0 2 2 1 1 (cid:222) d[2x2y4] - d[x4y2] = 0 …(52) 2 2 Integrating Eqn.
(52), we get the required solution as x2y4- x4y2 = c (a constant) 1 2 or x2y2(y2 – x2) = 2c = c ( a constant).

These includes homogeneous equations, equations reducible to homogeneous form and equations that become exact when multiplied by an I.F.
in this unit, we focus our attention on another very important type of first order first degree differential equations known as linear equations.
These equations are important because of their wide range of applications, for example, the physical 71MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION situations we gave in Sec.
1.5 of unit 1 are all governed by linear differential equations.
In this unit, we shall solve some of these physical problems.
The problem of integrating a linear differential equation was reduced to quadrature by Leibniz in 1692.
In December, 1695, James Bernoulli proposed a solution of a non-linear differential equation of the first order, now known as Bernoulli’s equation.
In 1696, Leibniz pointed out Bernoulli’s equation may be reduced to a linear differential equation by changing the dependent variable.
We shall discuss this equation in the later part of this unit along with some other equations, which may not be of first order or first degree but which can be reduced to linear to linear differential equations.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Classification of First Order Differential Equations We begin by giving some definitions in this section.
You may recall that in Unit 1 we defined the general form of first order differential equation to be (cid:230) dy(cid:246) g(cid:231) x,y (cid:247) = 0 Ł dxł and if the equation is of first degree, then it can be expressed as dy = f(x, y) dx 72MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION In the above equation if the function f(x, y) be such that it contains dependent variable y in the first degree only, then it is called a linear differential equation.
Formally, we have the following definition.
Definition: We say that a differential equation is linear if the dependent variable and all its derivatives appear only in the first degree and also there is no term involving the product of the derivatives or any derivative and the dependent variable.
dy 2y d2y dy For example, equation + = x3 and + = x sin x are linear dx x dx2 dx dy differential equations.
However + x2 = 10 is not linear equation of the presence dx dy of the term y .
dx The general form of the linear differential equation of the first order is dy a(x) = b(x)y + c(x) …(1) dx ˝ where a(x), b(x) and c(x) are continuous real valued functions in some interval I R. If c(x) is identically zero, then Eqn.
(1) reduces to dy a(x) = b(x)y …(2) dx Eqn.
(2) is called a linear homogeneous differential equation.
When c(x) is zero, Eqn.
(1) is called non-homogeneous (or inhomogeneous) linear differential equation Note: You may note that the word homogeneous as it is used here has a very different meaning from that used in Sec.
2.3, unit 2.
Any differential equation of order one which is not of type (1) or (2) is called a non-linear differential equation.
On dividing Eqn.
(1) by a(x) for x s.t a(x) „ 0, it can be put in the more useful form dy + P(x) y = Q(x), …(3) dx where P a. I Q are functions of x alone or are constants.
Consider, for instance, the dy equation = y dx 73MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION It is a linear homogeneous equation.
Here a(x) = 1 and b(x) = 1.
Similarly, dy dy = 0, = exy are also linear homogeneous equation of order one with dx dx a(x) = 1, b(x) = ex and c(x) = x. dy Next consider the differential equation = |y|.
dx You know that |y| = y for 0 and |y| = - y for y < 0.
Hence, in order to solve this ‡ equation, we will have to square it and the resulting equation is neither of type (1) dy nor of (2).
It is a case of non-linear equation.
Similarly, = y is a non-linear dx dy dy equation because of the term .
Again = cos y is a non-linear equation (as dx dx cos y can be expressed as an infinite series in powers of y).
You may now try this exercise.
You will realize the need for classification of linear differential equation into homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations when we discuss some properties involving the solution of linear homogeneous differential equations.
But first let us talk about the general solution of linear non-homogeneous equation of type (1) or (3).
3.2 General Solution of Linear Non-Homogeneous Equation Consider Eqn.
(3) , viz., dy + P(x)y = Q(x) dx In the discussion that follows, we assume that Eqn.
(3) has a solution.
You can see that in general, Eqn (3) is not exact.
But we will show that we can always find an integrating factor μ(x), which makes this equation exact – a useful property of linear equations.
Let us suppose that Eqn.
(3) is written in the differential form dy + [P(x)y – Q(x)] dx = 0 …(4) Suppose that (x) is an I.F.
of Eqn.
(4).
Then μ 74MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (x) dy + (x) [P(x)y – Q(x)] dx = 0 …(5) μ μ is an exact differential equation.
By Theorem 1 of Unit 2, we know that Eqn.
(5) will be an exact differential if ¶ ¶ ( (x) = ( (x)[P(x)y – Q(x)]} …(6) ¶ x μ ¶ y μ dμ or = P(x) μ dx This is a separable equation from which we can determine (x).
we have μ dμ = P(x)dx μ or In | | = (cid:242) P(x) dx …(7) μ so that μ (x) = e (cid:242) P(x)dx is an integrating factor for Eqn.
(4).
Note that we need not use a constant of integration in relation (7) since Eqn.
(5) is unaffected by a constant multiple.
Also, you may note that Eqn.
(4) is still an exact differential equation even when Q9x) = 0. in fact Q(x) plays no part in determining ¶ (x) since we see from (6), that (x) Q(x) = 0.
Thus both μ ¶y μ e (cid:242) P(x)dxdy + e (cid:242) P(x)dx [P(x)y – Q(x)] dx and e (cid:242) P(x)dxdy + e (cid:242) P(x)dx P(x)y dx are exact differentials.
We, now, write Eqn.
(3) in the form (cid:230) dy (cid:246) e (cid:242) Pdx (cid:231) + + y(cid:247) = Q e (cid:242) Pdx Ł dx ł This can also be written as d (y e (cid:242) Pdx) = Q e (cid:242) Pdx dx Integrating the above equation, we get y e(cid:242) Pdx (cid:242) Q e(cid:242)Pdx dx + α, where α is a constant of integration or y = e(cid:242)Pdx (cid:242) Q e(cid:242)Pdx dx + α e(cid:242)Pdx …(8) 75MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION For initial value problem, the constant in Eqn.
(8) can be determined by using α initial conditions.
Relation (8) gives the general solution of Eqn.
(3) and can be used as a formula for obtaining the solution of equation of the form (3).
As a matter of advice we may put it that one need not try to learn the formula (8) and apply it mechanically for solving linear equations.
Instead, one should use the procedure by which (8) is derived: multiply by e(cid:242)Pdx and integrate.
In case of linear homogeneous equation, the general solution can be obtained by putting Q = 0 in Eqn.
(8) as y = α e- (cid:242) Pdx Note that the first term on the right hand side of Eqn.
(8) is due to non- homogeneous term Q of Eqn.
(3).
It is termed as the particular integral of the linear non-homogeneous differential equation, that is, particular integral of Eqn.
(3) is e- (cid:242) Pdx (cid:242) Q e(cid:242)Pdx dx.
The particular integral does not contain any arbitrary constant.
The solution of linear non-homogeneous equation and its corresponding linear homogeneous equation are nicely interrelated.
We give the first result, in this direction, in the form of the following theorem: ˝ Theorem 1: In I R, if y be a solution of linear non-homogeneous differential 1 Eq.
(3), that is, dy + P(x)y = Q(x) dx and if z be a solution of corresponding linear homogeneous differential equation dy + +(x)y = 0, …(9) dx then the function y = y + z is a solution of Eqn.
(3) on I.
1 dy dz \ dy = 1 + ..(10) dx dx dx Since y P(x)y = Q(x) 1 1 dy 1 + P(x)y = Q(x) …(11) 1 dx 76MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Also since z is a solution of (9), therefore dz + P(x)z = 0 …(12) dx On combining Eqns.
(10) – (12), we get dy = [Q(x) – P(x)y ] + [-P(x)z] dx 1 = Q(x) – P(x) [y + z] 1 = Q(x) – yP(x) as ( y + z = y), 1 dy i.e., + P(x)y = Q(x).
dx Hence y = y + z is a solution of Eqn.
(3) and this completes the proof of the 1 theorem.
From this theorem, it should be clear that any solution of Eqn.
(3) must contain solution of Eqn.
(9) (corresponding linear homogeneous equation).
In case, the function Q(x) on the right-hand side of Eqn.
(3) is a linear combination of functions, then we can make use of the following theorem: Theorem 2: Let y be a particular solution of i dy + P(x)y = Q(x), dx i where Q(x) are continuous functions defined on an interval I for I = 1, 2,…., n. i then the function y = y + y +…+ y , defined on I, is a particular solution of p 1 2 n dy + P(x)y = Q(x), dx where Q(x) = Q (x) + Q (x) +….+ Q (x), " x˛ I.
1 2 n The proof of this theorem is simple and is left as an exercise for you.
We now take up some examples and illustrate the method of finding the solution of linear non-homogeneous differential equations.
dy Example 1: Solve x + y = x3 dx 77MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The given differential equation can be written as 1 dy + y = x2 …(13) dx x it is a linear equation.
Comparing it with Eqn (3), we have P = 1 .
So I.F.
= e(cid:242)Pdx = e(cid:242)(1/x)dx = eInx = x x Multiplying Eqn.
(13) by x, we get dy x + y = x3 dx d i.e., (xy) = x3, which is exact.
dx Integrating, we get x4 xy = + c, 4 c being a constant, as the required solution.
dy Example 2: Solve x - ay = x + 1 dx Solution: Clearly the given equation is linear and can be written in the form a x+1 dy - y = dx x x 1 \ I.F.
= e(cid:242)(- a/x)dx= e-aInx = eInx- a = xa 1 Multiplying the given equation by , we get xa 1 a x+1 dy - y = , xa dx xa+1 xa+1 d (cid:230) y (cid:246) x+1 i.e., (cid:231) (cid:247) = dx Ł xa ł xa+1 Integrating the above equation w.r.t.x, we get y x+1 (cid:242) xa = xa+1 dx + c (c is constant) 78MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION x- a+1 x- a = + +c.
- a+1 - a x 1 Thus y = - + cxa is the required solution.
1- a a Let us look at another example in which the role of x and y has been interchanged.
dx Example 3: Solve y Iny + x – Iny = 0. dy dx Solution: This equation is of first degree in x and .
Hence it is a linear dy equation with y as independent variable and x as dependent variable.
Then given equation can be written as dx x 1 = + , …(14) dy yIny y \ I.F.
= e (cid:242) 1/(y in y) dy = eIn(Iny) = Iny Multiplying Eqn.
(14) by Iny, we get 1 dx 1 Iny + x = Iny, dy y y d 1 i.e., (x Iny) = Iny.
dy y Integrating the above equation w.r.t.y, we get 1 xIny = (cid:242) Iny dy + c, y (Iny)2 = + c, c is a constant, 2 or 2x Iny = (Iny)2 + c , is the required solution where c = 2c.
1 1 let us consider another example.
Example 4: solve the equation ydx + (3x – xy + 2) dy = 0 79MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: Since the product y dy occurs here, the equation is not linear in dependent variable y. it is, however, linear if we treat variable y as independent variable and x as dependent variable.
Therefore, we arrange the terms as y dx + (3 – y) x dy = - 2 dy, and write it in the standard form (cid:230) 3 (cid:246) 2 dx + (cid:231)(cid:231) - 1(cid:247)(cid:247) x = - , for y „ 0 …(15) dy Ł y ł y (cid:230) 3 (cid:246) Now, (cid:242) (cid:231)(cid:231) - 1(cid:247)(cid:247) dy = 3 In|y|, Ł y ł So that an integrating factor for Eqn.
(15) is e(3In|y|-y) = e-y e3In|y| = eIn|y|3e- y = |y|3e-y If follows that for y > 0, y3e-y is an integrating factor and for y > 0, -y3 e-y serves as an integrating factor for the given equation.
In either case, we are led to the exact equation Y3 e-y dx + y2 (3 – y e-y x dy = - 2y2e-y dy, i.e., d(xy3y-y) = - 2y2e-y dy.
Integrating the above equation w.r.t.y, we get Xy3e-y = - 2 (cid:242) y2 e-y dy = 2y2 e-y + 4y e-y + c (Integrating by parts) Thus, we can express the required solution as xy3 = 2y3 + 4y + 4 + cey, where c is an arbitrary constant.
You may try the following exercises.
We have seen that general solution of a linear non-homogeneous differential Eqn.
(3) is given by Eqn.
(8), which involves integrals.
We remark that an equation y' = f(x, y) is said to be solve when its solution is reduced to the expression of the form (cid:242) h(x) dx or (cid:242) ø(y) dy for some h(x) and ø(y) even if it is impossible to evaluate these integrals in terms of known functions.
Further, the reduction of the solutions from one form to a simpler form may require as much labour as the solving of the equations.
In solution (8) of Eqn.
(3), e- (cid:242) Pdx (cid:242) Q(x)e(cid:242) Pdx dx is the particular integral of Eqn.
(3) and the evaluation of this integral will depend on the form of Q(x).
this evaluation may sometimes turn out to be a tedious task.
But, there are other methods by which particular integral in some scases can be obtained without carrying rigorous integration.
We shall briefly disucss these methods now.
As 80MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION these methods are more helpful for higher order differential equations, we shall discuss them in greater detail in Block 2.
3.2.1 Method of Undetermined Coefficients This method is applicable when in Eqn.
(3), i.e., dy + P(x)y = Q(x), dx P(x) is a constant and Q(x) is any of the following forms: i) an exponential ii) A polynomial in x iii) of the form cos b x or sin bx iv) a linear combination of i), ii) and iii) above.
The general procedure is to assume the particular solution with arbitrary or unknown constants and then determine the constants.
We know that on differentiating functions such as eαx(α constant), xr (r > 0 is an integer), sin bx or cos bx (βconstant), we again obtain an exponential, a polynomial or a function which is a linear combination of sine or cosine function.
Hence if the non-homogeneous term Q(x) in Eqn.
(3) is in any of the forms (i) – (iv), above, then we can choose the particular integral accordingly to be a suitable combination of the terms n(i) – (iv).
We now take up different cases according to the forms of Q(x).
Case 1: Q(x) = k emx, k and m are real constants, that is, Q(x) is an exponential function.
In this case, we prove the result in the form of the following theorem.
Theorem 3: If a, k and m are real constants, then a partuclar solution of dy + ay = k emx dx is given by (cid:236) k (cid:239) emxif m „ - a y (x) = (cid:237) (a+ m) p (cid:239)(cid:238) kxemxif m = - a 81MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Proof: in this case, since Q(x) is an exponential function, we assume y (x) = remx p to be a particular solution of Eqn.
(16), where r is some constant to be determined.
Now y (x) must satisfy Eqn.
(16).
p Thus, we get Rm emx + ar emx = kemx 1 „ Or r = if m - a. a+ m 1 Therefore, y (x) = emx if m „ - a. p a+ m In case m + a = 0, i.e., m = - a, then you may verify that y (x) = kx emx satisfies p Eqn.
(16).
The reasoning for this sort solution will be given when we discuss this method in detail in Block 2.
However, we illustrate this case by the following example.
Example 5: Solve y' – y = 2ex Solution: On comparing the given equation with Eqn.
(16), we find that a = - 1, k = 2, and m = 1 (cid:222) Also, m + a = -1 + 1 = 0 m = -a.
\ By Theorem 3, a particular integral is 2xex.
Further, I.F.
= e- (cid:242) Pdx = e- (cid:242) dx = e= x.
(\ P = - 1) Therefore, required solution, following relation (8), is y = P.I + c ex, i.e., y = 2xex + c ex.
You may now try this exercise.
(cid:229) n Case II: Q(x) = a xi i i=0 That is, Q(x) is a polynomial of degree n. In this Eqn.
(3) reduces to dy (cid:229)n + ay = axi …(17) dx i i=0 If a = 0 in Eqn.
(17), then particular solution is Y (x) = (cid:229) n ai xi+1 , which follows by direct integration.
p i+1 i=0 If in Eqn.
(17), a „ 0, then we assume (cid:229) n y (x) = Pxi (Q(x) being a polynomial in this case), p i i=0 82MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION And determine real numbers P , P , …., P so that particular solution y (x) satisfies 0 1 n p Eqn.
(17).
Substituting this value of y (x) in Eqn.
(17) (with y replaced by y (x)), we have p p (cid:229) n iPxi- 1 + (cid:229) n aPxi = (cid:229) n a xi (a „ 0) …(18) i i i i=1 i=0 i=0 Equating the coefficients of like power of x on both sides of Eqn.
(18), we get Coeff.
Of xi: (I +1)P + aP = a for I = 0, 1, 2, …., (n-1) i+1 i i Coeff.
Of xn: aP = a …(19) n a Since Q(x) is a polynomial of degree n, thus a „ 0 and we can solve EQn.
(19) n for P P ,….P .
from Eqn.
(19), we get 0 1 n P = a /a n n (cid:230) na (cid:246) 1 P = (cid:231) a - n (cid:247) , n-1 Ł n- 1 a ł a n- 1 n 1 P = a - (a - a ) , and so on.
n-2 n-2 n-1 n a a a We illustrate this method with the help of following example.
dy Example 6: Find the particular solution of + 2y = 2x2 + 3. dx Solution: We note that, in this case, Q(x) is a polynomial of degree 2.
Assume a particular solution of the form (cid:229) n y (x) = Pxi = P + P x + P x2.
p i 0 1 1 i=0 Substitution of y (x) in the given equation yields P (P + 2P x) + 2(P +P x+P x2) = 2x2 + 3.
…(20) 1 2 0 1 2 Equating the coefficients of like powers of x on both side of Eqn.
(20), we get Coeff.
of x2: 2P = 2 or P = 1.
2 2 Coeff.
of x2: 2P = 2 or P = 1.
2 2 Coeff.
of x0: P + 2P = 3 or P = 2.
1 0 0 Hence, required particular solution is y (x) = x2 –x + 2.
P And now an exercise for you.
Case III: Q(x) = sin βx or cos βx or a βx + b cos βx 83MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Where β, a and b are real constants.
In all these cases, we assume a particular solution of the form c sin βx + d cos βx .
On substituting this solution in the given equation and equating the coefficients of sin βx and cos βx on both sides, we determine the constants c and d. Let us illustrate this case by an example.
Example 7: Find the particular integral of dy + y = cos 3x dx solution: Here Q(x) = cos 3x.
Hence, any particular solution of the given differential equation must be a combination of sin 3x and cos 3x.
let the particular solution be y (x) = c cos 3x + d sin 3x P On substituting this value of y (x) in the given equation, we get P (-3c sin 3x + 3x cos 3x) + (c cos 3x + d sin 3x) = cos 3x …(21) comparing the coefficients of cos 3x and sin 3x on both sides of Eqn.
(21), we get c + 3d = 1 and d – 3c = 0 1 3 or c = and d = 10 10 Hence, the particular solution is 1 y (x) = (3 sin 3x + cos 3x) p 10 we now take up an example which is a combination of all the three cases discussed above.
Example 8: Compute the general solution of dy + y = ex + x + sin x …(22) dx Solution: Here Q(x) = Q (x) + Q (x) + Q (x), 1 2 3 With Q (x) = ex, Q (x) = x and Q (x) = sin x.
1 2 3 You may recall Theorem 2; if y , y and y are particular solutions of 1 2 3 dy + y = ex …(23) dx dy + y = x …(24) dx and 84MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy + y = sin x …(25) dx respectively, then y = y + y + y is a particular solution of the given equation.
p 1 2 3 Consider Eqn.
(23).
Let the particular solution be Y = rex.
1 Substituting this in Eqn.
(23), we get 1 rex +rex = ex (cid:222) r = 2 \ y = 1 ex …(26) 1 2 For Eqn.
(24) we assume the particular solution as y = a x + a .
2 1 0 Substituting this in Eqn.
(24), we get a + a x + a = x …(27) 1 1 0 comparing coefficients of like powers of x on both side of Eqn.
(27), we get a + a = 0 0 1 a = 1, a = -1, a = 1 1 (cid:222) 0 1 Hence y = x-1 …(28) 2 In the case of Eqn (25), assume particular solutions as y = c sin x + d cos x.
3 Substituting this in Eqn.
(25), we get c cos x – d sin x + c sin x + d cos x = sin x …(29) On equating the coefficients of sin x and cos c on both sides of Eqn.
(29), we get c – d = 1 1 1 c + d = 0 c = and d = - (cid:222) 2 2 1 y3 = (sin x – cos x) …(30) \ 2 Hence, particular solution of Eqn.
(22) can be obtained from Eqn.
(26), (28) and (30) as 1 1 y (x) = y + y + y = ex + x -1 + (sin x – cos x) p 1 2 3 2 2 The solution of homogeneous pat of Eqn.
(22), i.e.
dy + y = 0 dx is given by 85MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 dy + 1 = 0 y dx Integrating the above equation, we get In y + x = In α, for some constant , α y i.e., = e-x α or y = e-x α Hence complete solution of Eqn.
(22) is given by 1 1 y = e-x + ex + x-1 + (sin x – cos x) α 2 2 How about trying an exercise now?
We thus studied the method of undetermined coefficients for finding the particular integral of the non-homogeneous linear differential EQn.
(3).
We saw that this method would be applicable only for a certain class of differential equations – those for which P(x) is a constant and Q(x) assumes either of the forms eαx, xr, sin βx or cos βx , or their combinations.
We shall, now, study a method that carries no such restrictions.
3.2.2 Method of Variation of Parameters Consider the non-homogeneous linear Eqn.
(3), namely, dy + P(x)y(x) = Q(x).
dx the homogeneous equation corresponding to the above linear equation is dy + P(x) y(x) = 0. dx Further we know , from Eqn.
(8), that the solution y (x) of the homogeneous linear h equation is given by yh(x) = α e- (cid:242) Pdx, ..(31) where is a constant.
α In tis method we assume that , in Eqn.
(31), is not a constant but a function of α x. that is, we vary with x and assume that the resulting function α y(x) = α (x) e-(cid:242)Pdx …(32) is a solution of Eqn.
(3).
That is, we try to determine (x) such that y given by α Eqn.
(32) solves Eqn.
(3).
In other words, we determine a necessary condition on (x) so that y defined by relation (32), is a solution of Eqn.

(3) and (32), we get d [ α (x) e- (cid:242) P(x)dx] + P(x) [ α (x) e- (cid:242) P(x)dx] = Q(x).

Substituting the value of (x) from eQn.
(33) in relation (32), the solution to α Eqn.

(8) that has been obtained directly.
Further, the method of variation of parameter neither simplifies any integration/solution nor provides any other form of the solution for first order first degree differential equation.
It only provides an alternative approache to arrive at the general solution in this case.
However, as we shall see later in Block 2, this method turns out to be quite powerful in discussing equations of higher order.
Using the method of undetermined coefficients/variation of parameters or otherwise you may now try this exercise.
Now let us discuss some properties of linear homogeneous differential equations, which give us some insight into qualitative theorem rather than|quantitative solutions.
3.3 Properties of the Solution of Linear Homogeneous Differential Equation In this section we shall discuss certain properties enjoyed by linear homogeneous differential equation.
We start with a very important property called superposition principle.
Theorem 4: (Superposition Principle) If y and y are any two solution of the linear homogeneous Eqn.
(9), i.e., 1 2 dy + P(x) y(x) = 0. dx Then y1 + y2 and cy are also solutions of Eqn.
(9), where c is a constant.
1 Proof: Since y and y are both solutions of Eqn.
(9), therefore 1 2 87MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy 1 + P(x)y = 0 …(34) 1 dx and dy 2 + P(x)y = 0, …(35) 2 dx Let h(x) = y + y 1 2 dh dy dy = 1 + 2 , \ dx dx dx = - P(x)y – P(x)y , (using Eqn.
(34) and (35)) 1 2 = - P(x) (y + y ), 1 2 = - P(x) h(x), dh i.e., + P(x) h(x) = 0, which shows that h(x) = y + y is indeed a solution of 1 2 dx Eqn.
(9).
Next, multiplying Eqn.
(34) by c (a constant), we get dy c 1 + cP(x)y = 0, 1 dx d i.e.
(cy ) + P(x).
(cy ) = 0, dx 1 1 which shows that (cy ) is also a solution of Eqn.
(9).
1 In many branches of sciences, y + y is called superposition of y and y and hence 1 2 1 2 the name superposition principle for Theorem 4.
The conclusions of Theorem 4 can be reframed as – the set of real (or complex) solution of Eqn.
(9) forms a ral (or complec) vector space (ref.
Block 1, MTE-02, acourse on linear algebra).
Do you think Theorem 4, holds for non-homogeneous linear equation?
Consider the non-homogeneous equation y' = 2x.
The functions (1 + x2) and (2 + x2), x ˛ R are two solution of y' = 2x …(36) d their sum (2+x2) + (2+x2) = 3 + 2x2, x does not satisfy Eqn.
(36) since (3 ˛R dx + 2x2) = 4x „ 2x, " x .
˛R Thus, Theorem 4 need not be true for a non-homogeneous linear equation does it work for a non-linear equation?
Let us look at y' = - y2 …(37) 88MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 1 which has solutions y (x) = and y = on an interval 1 (1+ x) 2 1+ 2x ¥ I = [0, [.
This is true because 1 y '(x) = - = - y1 , 1 (1+ x)2 2 and 2.2 y '(x) = - = -y2, 2 (1+ 2x)2 2 Let y = y + y .
Here y is well defined on I.
Also, by simple computation, we have 1 2 1 2.2 (8x2+12x+ 5) y'(x) = - - = - …(38) (1+ x)2 (1+ 2x)2 (1+ x)2(1+ 2x)2 on the other hand, (16x2+ 24x+ 9) - y2(x) = - …(39) (1+ x)2(1+ 2x)2 from relations (38) and (39), it is clear that y = y + y is not a solution of (37).
1 2 In the next exercise we ask you to show an example of a non-linear equation whose solution is y but cy is not a solution, i.e., the later part of Theorem 4 need 1 1 not be true for a non-linear equation.
Mostly we study the real solutions of Eqn.
(1).
You may recall that the functions a and b in Eqn.
(1) (defined on I) are assume to be valued.
The reason for restricting the study to real solutions will be clear from the following theorem.
Theorem 5: If y = p + iq is a complex valued function defined on I, which dy satisfies Eqn.
(2), that is, a(x) = b(x)y(x), then the real part p of y and the dx imaginary part q of y are also solutions of Eqn.
(2) on I.
(recall here that a and b are ral valued continuous functions) proof: By definition y = p+iq and so y' = p' + iq'.
Since y satisfies Eqn.s (2), we have a(x) {p'(x) + iq'(x)} = b(x) {p(x) + iq(x)} …(40) since a and b are real valued, on equating the ral and imaginary parts in Eqn.
(4), we get a(x)p (x) = b(x)p(x), and a(x)q' (x) = b(x)q(x), which show s that p and q are solution of Eqn.
(2) on I.
89MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Theorem 5 is also true for higher order linear homogeneous equations which will be discussed in our later blocks and the proof is virtually on the same lines.
But the theorem may fail if we replace Eqn.
(2) by an arbitrary non-linear equation or a linear non-homogeneous equation.
for instance, consider the first order non-linear equation yy' = -2x3 …(41) the function y(x) = ix2, x is a complex valued solution of Eqn.
(41), since ˛R y'(x) = 2ix and y(x)y'(x) = (ix) (ix2 = -2x3.
The real par p of y is the zero function.
i.e., p(x) = 0.
But p is not a solution of Eqn.
(41) (since 2x3 0 for all x ).
„ ˛R The following exercise shows that Theorem 5 may fail in the case of non- homogeneous linear equations.
We shall now be giving another interesting result concerning linear homogeneous dy equation a(x) = b(x)y(x), which can also be written as dx y' = g(x)y, …(42) b(x) where g(x) = , is a real valued continuous function defined on I.
Result a(x) which we are going to state is a consequence of the uniqueness of solutions of initial value problem for linear equations.
Theorem 6: Let y be a solution of the Eqn.
(42) on the interval such that y(x ) = 0 1 for some x in I.
Then y = 0 on I.
1 Proof: Consider the initial value problem y' = g(x) y, y(x ) = 0 1 By hypothesis, y is a solution of Eqn.
(42).
But the function z, defined by z9x) = 0 for all x I), also satisfies Eqn.
(42) (because z'(x) = 0, g(x)z(x) = 0 and z(x ) = 0).
1 By the uniqueness theorem for the initial value problem for linear equation (refer Theorem 1, Unit 1), we have z = y or in other words, y(x) = 0 for x˛ I.
This completes the proof.
Just as we have seen in the case of Theorem 4 and 5, Theorem 6 may not be true for non-linear or linear non-homogeneous equations.
Consider, for instance, the following non-linear differential equation.
˛ y' = 2√y, x [0, [ …(43) ¥ 90MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Let c>0.
we define the function y on [0, [ by ¥ (cid:236) 0 if 0£ x < c y(x) = (cid:237) (cid:238) 2(x- c)2if c£ |x < ¥ from the definition of y, we have (cid:236) 0 if 0£ x < c y'(x) = (cid:237) (cid:238) 2(x- c) = 2 y(x),if c£ |x < ¥ (Note that y is differentiable at x = c and, in fact, its right as well as left derivative is zero at x = c).
(cid:239)(cid:236) 0= 2 y(x),0£ |x < c y'(x) = (cid:237) (cid:239)(cid:238) 2(x- c) = 2 y(x)if c£ |x < ¥ which shows that y satisfies Eqn (43) for all x > 0.
We notice, here, that y vanishes on the interval [0, c[ and yet y is a non zero function on [0, [; which ¥ shows that the conclusions.
For example, y(x) = cos x + sin, x is a solution of ˛R Theorem 6 may not be true for non-linear equations.
similarly, we can show that Teorem 6 is not valid for linear non-homogeneous equation.
for example, y(x) = cos x + sin x, x is a solution of ˛R y' = y – 2sin x, x .
…(44) ˛R p p But, y(x) is zero at many points (like x = - , - + 2 , …) p 4 4 and assume both negative and positive values.
Yet y is a non-linear function which solves Eqn.
(44).
Did you notice that in Theorem 6 we did not take a general linear homogeneous equation?
we only considered linear homogeneous initial value problem.
Why?
Well, consider the linear homogeneous equation sin x y'(x) = cos x y(x) …(45) The function y(x) = sin x, x is a non-zer solution of Eqn.
(45), which vanishes ˛R at many points of R (like x = 0, – π, – 2π,…..) and also changes sign.
You may now try this exercise.
In Theorem 4 to 6, we have given some properties of linear homogeneous equations and corresponding initial value problems.
But, none of the results stated asserts the existence of solutions of linear equations or corresponding initial value 91MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION problem.
Such results are called qualitative properties of solution of linear equations and their corresponding initial value problems.
Sometimes equations which are not linear can be reduced to the linear form by suitable transformations of the variables.
In the next section we shall take up such equations.
3.4 Equations Reducible to Linear Equations Let us consider an equation of the form dy f'(y) + P(x), f(y) = Q(x) …(46) dx where f'(y) is the differential coefficient of f(y).
an interesting feature of Eqn.
(46) is that it is a non-linear differential equation of the first order that can be reduced to the linear form by putting v = f(y).
with this substitution Eqn.
(46) reduced to (cid:230) dy dy(cid:246) dy + P(x)v = Q(x), (cid:231)  = f'(y) (cid:247) , dx Ł dx dxł which is a linear equation with v as dependent variable and x as independent variable.
A very important and famous equation of this form, about which we have already mentioned in Sec 3.2, is known as Bernoulli’s Equation, named after James Bernoulli, who studied it in 1695 for finding its solution.
The equation is or the form.
dy + Py = Qy", …(47) dx where P an Q are functions of x above and n is neither zero nor one.
Dividing Eqn (47) by yn, we get dy y-n + P y1-n = Q …(48) dx in the year 1696, Leibniz pointed out that Eqn.
(48) can be reduced to a linear equation by takeny1-n as the new dependent variable.
On putting v = y1-n in Eqn.
(48), it reduces to 1 dy + P v = 0.
…(49) 1- n dx 92MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION which is a linear differential in v and x. Eqn.
(49) can now be solve by the known methods.
Note that when n= 0 Eqn.
(47)is a linear non-homogeneous equation and when n = 1, Eqn.
(47) is a linear homogeneous equation.
we now illustrate this method with the help of a few examples.
tany dy Example 9: Solve - = (1 + x)ex sec y …(50) dx 1+ x Solution: Dividing Eqn.
(50) by sec y, we get siny dy cos y = = (1+x)ex …(51) dx 1+ x If we put sin y = f(y), then f'(y) = cos y and hence Eqn.
(51) is of the form 1 dy f'(y) - f(y) = (1+x+ex …(52) dx 1+ x which is of the type (46).
To reduce it to linear from, we put v = f(y) = sin y Then Eqn (52) reduces to dv 1 - v = (1+x)ex dx 1+ x 1 it is a linear equation with I.F.
= - (cid:242) 1 dx = e-In(1+x) = e 1+ x 1+ x Multiplying the above equation by I.F., we get d (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) 1 (cid:231) v. (cid:247) = (1+x) ex.
dx Ł 1+ xł 1+ x Integrating w.r.t.x, we have 1 v = ex + c , c being a constant 1+ x i.e., v = )1+x)ex + c(1+x).
Substituting sin y for v, the required solution of the given Eqn.
(50) is sin y = (1+x)ex + c(1+x) Let us look at another example in which n is neither 0 nor 1.
Example 10: Solve y(axy + ex) dx – ex dy = 0 Solution: The given equation can be rearranged as dy ex = exy + axy2, dx 93MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy i.e., - y = axy-xy2 …(53) dx it is a Bernoulli’s equation with n = 2.
1 To solve it, let y1-2 = v, i.e., v = .
y dv 1 \ = - dy dx y2 dx Consequently, Eqn.
(53) reduces to dv - - v = axe-x …(54) dx it is a linear equation with I.F.
= e(cid:242)1dx = ex Multiplying both sides of Eqn.
(54) by I.F., we get d (vex) = - ax dx Integrating w.r.t.x, we get V ex = - (cid:242) ax dx + c. ax2 = - + c 2 (cid:230) 1(cid:246) (cid:231) (cid:247) Replacing v by (cid:231) (cid:247) , the required solution can be expressed as Ł ył (cid:230) ax2 (cid:246) Ex = y (cid:231)(cid:231) c- (cid:247)(cid:247) , Ł 2 ł Remark: There are many second or higher order linear equations which can be solved easily by reducing them to linear first order equations by making some transformation of the variables.
We shall take up such equations later in Block 2 when we discuss second order equations.
You may now try the following exercises.
You may recall that in Unit 1, we discussed some physical situations expressed in terms of differential equations.
In the following section we have attempted to solve some of them.
94MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Applications of Linear Differential Equations Let us consider the problem discussed in Unit 1 one by one.
I.
Population model You may recall that while studying the equation for population problem we had arrived at the initial value problem.
(ref.
Eqns.
(32) and (33) of unit 1) d N(t) = k N(t) dt N(t ) = N …(55) 0 0 Since k is a constant in Eqn.
(55), the first of the equations in (55) is a linear differential equation of order one.
From Sec.
3.3 we know that its solution is N(t) = N(t ) exp (k(t-t )) …(56) 0 0 In Eqn.
(56), we normally assume that N(t ) is specified.
If k is known then we 0 can find the solution using relation (56).
In reality, it is too hard to measure k (which gives the rate of growth).
In a particular case, we can actually find the exact value of k if we know the value of N at t (t „ t ).
The details are shown in 1 1 0 the following example.
Example 11: Assuming that the rate of growth of a species is proportional to the amount N(t) present at time t, find the value of N(t) given that N(0) = 100 and after one unit of time, the size of the specie has grown to 200.
Solution: In this case t = 0, N(0) = 100. the solution of the problem is given by 0 N(t) = 100 exp (kt), t ‡ 0 We determine k from the additional condition N(1) = 200 (N(1) = size of population at time t = 1).
(cid:222) Thus 200 = 100 exp (k) k = In2 Hence the solution is N(t) = 100 exp (t In2) = 100 exp (In2t) Or N(t) = (100) 2t In this problem the constant k has been determined from the given date.
In the following exercise we ask you to solve a similar problem.
Let us now discuss the problem of decay of radioactive material.
95MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION II.
Radioactive Decay In unit 1, (Ref.
Eqn.
(35)), we have seen that equation which governs the radioactive decay of a given radioactive material is y'(t) = k y(t) …(57) Note: Half-life is the time needed for the material to reduce itself to half of its original mass.
Where y(t) is the mass of the radioactive material at time t and k < 0 is a real constant.
Eqn.
(57) can be used to find the half-life of the radioactive material.
In the following example we consider this problem in detail.
Example 12: A radioactive substance with a mass of 50 gms.
Was found to have a mass of 40 gms.
After 30 years.
Find its half-life.
Solution: The mass y(t) of the material satisfies d y(t)= k y(t) dt y(0)= 50 gms., y(30= 40 gms.
...(58) The solution of the first two equations in Eqns.
(58) can be expressed as y(t) = 50 exp (kt), Using the third equation in Eqn.
(58), we can write.
y(30) = 40 = 50 exp (30k), or exp (30k) = 4/5, 1 (cid:230) 4(cid:246) i.e., k = In (cid:231) (cid:247) 30 Ł 5ł thus, the mass y(t) satisfies (cid:230) t 4(cid:246) y(t) = 50 exp (cid:231) In (cid:247) …(59) Ł 30 5ł 50 Let t be its half-life, i.e., after time t the mass reduces to = 25 gms.
1 1 2 Then y(t ) = 25 …(60) 1 We are required to find t .
using condition (60), Eqn.
(59) reduces to 1 96MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (cid:230) t (cid:246) 25 = 50 exp (cid:231) 1 In 4/5(cid:247) Ł 30 ł or t In (4/5) = 30 In (1/2) 1 i.e.
t = 30 (In (1/2))/In (4/5) …(61) 1 so after t years (t defined by Eqn.
(61)), the mass of the material will be 25 gms.
1 1 Let us now deal with the temperature variations of a hot object.

Newton’s Law of Cooling The temperature of a hot a hot body kept in a surrounding of constant temperature T has been discussed in Unit 1 and the governing equation of the temperature T of 0 the body is T'(t) = k(T(t) – T ) …(62) 0 (Ref.
Eqn.
(34) of Unit 1) we illustrate this by the following example.
Example 13: A rod of temperature 100oC is kept in a surrounding of temperature 20oC.
If the temperature of the rod was found to be 80oC after 10 minutes, find the temperature T(t) of the rod.
Solution: We are required to solve d T(t) = k(T(t) – 20) …(63) dt Let us put y(t) = T(t) – 20.
Then y'(t) = T'(t) and Eqn.
(63) reduces to d y(t) = k y(t) ..(64) dt Eqn.
(63) is not a linear homogeneous equation whereas Eqn.
(64) is which explains the reason for introducing y) Along with Eqn.
(64), we have a) y(0) = T(0) – 20 = 100 – 20 = 80oC, b) y(10) = T(10) – 20 = 80 – 20 = 60oC …(65) the solution of Eqn.
(64), with the condition 65(a), is y(t) = 80 exp (kt) with this value of y and condition (65b), we have y(10) = 60 = 80 exp (k. 10) 1 1 or, k = In (6/8) = In (3/4) 10 10 97MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Hence the value of y is determined by (cid:230) t (cid:246) y(t) = 80 exp (cid:231) In(.75)(cid:247) , Ł 10 ł and the temperature T is given by (cid:230) t (cid:246) T(t) = 80 exp (cid:231) In(.75)(cid:247) + 20 Ł 10 ł And now an exercise for you.

In Unit 2 and 3, we have given you the methods of solving different types of differential equations of first order and first degree.
In this unit we shall consider those differential equations which are of first order but not of first degree.
dy If we denote by P, then the most general form of a differential equation of the dx first order and nth degree can be expressed in the form Pn + P pn-1 + P pn-2 + …..+ P p + P = 0, …(1) 1 2 n-1 n Where P , P ,….., P are functions of x and y.
1 2 n It is difficult to solve Eqn.
(1) in its most general form.
In this unit we shall consider only those forms of Eqn.
(1) which can be easily solved and discuss the methods of solving such equations.
103MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION It was Isaac Newton (1642 – 1727), the English mathematician and scientist, who classified differential equations of the first order (then known as fluxional equations) in “Methodus Fluxionum et serierum infinitarum”, written around 1671 and published in1736.
count Jacopo Riccati (1676-1754), an Italian mathematician, was mainly responsible for introducing the ideal of Newton to Italy.
Riccati was destined to play an important part in further advancing the theory of differential equations.
In 1712, he reduced an equation of the second order in y to an equation of first order in p. in 1723, he exhibited that under some restricted hypotheses, the particular equation to which the name of Riccati is attached, can be solved.
Later the French mathematician Alexis Claude Clairaut (1713-1765) introduced the idea of differentiating the given differential equations in order to solve them.
He applied it to the equations that now bear his name and published the method in 1734. we shall also be discussing the equations introduced by Riccati and Clairaut in this unit.
Clairaut (1713-1765) 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to • Find the solution of the differential equations which can be resolved into rational linear factors of the first degree; • Obtain the solution of equations solvable for y, x or p; • Obtain the solution of the differential equations in which x or y is absent; • Solve the equations which may be homogeneous in x and y; 104MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION • Identify and obtain the solution of Clairaut’s equation; • Identify and obtain the solution of Riccati’s equation.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Equations which can be factorized Let us consider the general form of differential equation of the first order and nth degree given by Eqn.
(1) namely, Pn + P pn-1 + P pn-2 + …..+ P p + P = 0, 1 2 n-1 n Where P , P ,….., P are functions of x and y.
1 2 n For this equation, we shall consider two possibilities: a) When the left-hand side of Eqn.
(1) can be resolved into rational factors of the first degree.
b) When the left-hand side of Eqn.
(1) cannot be factorized.
In this section we shall take up the first possibility.
When Eqn.
91) can be factorized into rational factors of the degree, then it can take the form (p – R ) (p – R )……(p – R ) = 0 …(2) 1 2 n for some R , R , …., R , which are functions of x and y.
1 2 n Eqn.
91) will be satisfied by a value of y that will make any of the factors in Eqn (2) equal to zero.
Hence, to obtain the solution of Eqn.
(1), we equate each of the factors in Eqn.
(2) equal to zero.
Thus, we get P – R = 0, p – R = 0, …, p – R = 0 …(3) 1 2 n There are n equations of first degree.
Using the methods given in Unit 2 and 3 we can now obtain the solution of the above n equations of first order and first degree.
Let us suppose that the solutions desired for Eqn.
(3) are f (x,y,c ) = 0(cid:252) 1 1 (cid:239) f (x,y,c = 0(cid:239) 2 2 (cid:253) …(4) ;; (cid:239) f (x,y,c ) = 0(cid:239)(cid:254) n n where c , c ,…., c are the arbitrary constants of integration.
1 2 n 105MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Since each of the constants c , c ,….., c can take any one of an infinite number of 1 2 n values, thus these solutions remain general even if C = c = ….= c = c, say.
1 2 n In that case, the n solutions will be f (x, y, c) = 0 1 f (x, y, c) = 0 2 f (x, y, c) = 0 3 ….
….
F (x, y, c) = 0 n These n solutions can be left distinct or we can combine them into one equation, namely, F (x, y, c).
f (x, y, c) ….f (x, y, c) = 1 2 n The reason of taking all c , c ,…., c equal in Eqn.
(4) is the fact that Eqn.
(2) 1 2 n being of first order, its general solution can contain only one arbitrary constant.
We illustrate this method by the following examples: Example 1: Solve p2 +px + py+xy = 0 Solution: The given equation is equivalent to (p+x) (p+y) = 0 that is, either p+x = 0 or, p+y = 0 In other words, dy dy + x = 0, or + y = 0 dx dx the solutions of the factors are 2y = -x2 + c and x = -In |y| + c, for c being an arbitrary sonstant.
Therefore, the general solution of the given equation is (2y + x2 – c).
(x+In |y| - c) = 0.
Let us look at another example.
Example 2: Solve p3 (x + 2y) + 3p2(x + y) + (y + 2x)p = 0 106MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The given equation is equivalent to p[p2(x + 2y) + 3p(x + y) + (y + 2x)] = 0 (cid:222) p[p2(x + 2y) + p{(y + 2x) + (x + 2y)} + (y + 2x)] = 0 (cid:222) p(p + 1) [(x + 2y)p + (y + 2y)] = 0 its component equations are p = 0, p + 1 = 0, (x + 2y)p + (y + 2x) = 0 dy (cid:222) Now p = 0 = 0, which has the solution dx y = c …(5) dy (cid:222) Now p+1 = 0 + 1 = 0 dx i.e., dy + dx = 0 which has the solution y+x =c …(6) Further, (x + 2y)p + (y + 2x) = 0 (cid:222) (x + 2y)dy + (y + 2x)dx = 0 (cid:222) d(xy + x2 + y2) = 0.
Which has the solution xy + 2 + y2 = c …(7) Therefore, the general solution of the given equation, from Eqns.
(5), (6) and (7), is (y –c).
(y+x – c).
(xy + x2 + y2 – c) = 0.
You may now try the following exercise.
As you know from algebra, every equation over Q need not have all its roots in Q, i.e., it need not be factorizable in Q.
We now take up those equations of form (1) which cannot be factorized into rational factors of the first degree.
3.2 Equations which cannot be Factorized in this case, let the form of Eqn.
(1) be f(x, y, p) = 0 ….
(8) eqn.
(8) is not solvable in its most general form we shall discuss only those equations of type (8) which possess one or more of the following properties.
107MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION i) It may be solvable for y. ii) It may be solvable for x. iii) It may solvable for p. iv) Either it may not contain y or it may not contain x, that is, either x or y is absent from the differential equation.
v) It may be homogeneous in x and y. vi) It may be of first degree in x and y. vii) It may be Riccati’s equation.
We now discuss these cases one by one.
3.2.1 Equation Solvable for y Consider an equation xp2 – yp – y = 0 …(9) we can write Eqn.
(9) in the form y(p+1) = xp2, xp2 (cid:222) y = p+1 That is, Eqn.
(9) can be solvable for y in terms of x and p. Similarly when Eqn.
(8), i.e., f(x, y, p) = 0 is solvable for y, then it can be pt in the form y = F(x, p) …(10) Differentiating Eqn.
(10) w.r. to x, we get an equation of the form (cid:230) dp(cid:246) P= ø (cid:231) x,p, (cid:247) …(11) Ł dxł Eqn.
(11) is in two variables x and p; and we may possibly solve and get a relation of the type y (x, p, c) = 0 …(12) for some constant c. It we now eliminate p between Eqns.
(8) and (12), we get a relation involving x, y and c, which is the required solution.
In the cases when the elimination of p between Eqns.
(8) and (12) is not possible, we then obtain the values of x and y in terms of p as a parameter and these together give us the required solution.
108MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION We now illustrate this method with the help of a few examples.
Example 3: The given equation is solvable for y.
Solving it for y, we get x y = p + …(13) p Differentiating Eqn.
(13) w.r. to x, we get (cid:230) (cid:246) dp 1 1 dp p = + + x(cid:231)(cid:231) - (cid:247)(cid:247) dx p Ł p2 ł dx (cid:230) 1(cid:246) dx 1 i.e., (cid:231)(cid:231) p- (cid:247)(cid:247) + x = 1 …(14) Ł pł dp p2 this is linear equation of the first order if we consider p as independent variable and x as dependent variable.
We can write Eqn (14) as, dx 1 p + x = …(15) dp p(p- 1)(p+1) p2- 1 1 For Eqn.
(15) (cid:242) dpis an integrating factor.
e p(p2- 1) Now, (cid:242) 1 dp= (cid:242) ŒØ 1 + 1 - 1œø dp e p(p2- 1) e º 2(p- 1) 2(p+1) pß (p2- 1)1/2 (p2- 1)1/2 = In = e p p the, the solution of Eqn.
(15) is obtained as (p2- 1)1/2 p (p2- 1)1/2 1 x = (cid:242) dp = (cid:242) dp = c + cos h-1p, p p2- 1 p p2- 1 or x = p(c + cos h-1p) (p2 -1)-1/2 …(16) you may notice that elimination of p between Eqns.
(13) and (16) is not easy.
However, by substituting for x from Eqn.
(16) in Eqn.
(13), we get y = p+(c + cosh-1p) (p2 -1)-1/2 …(17) Eqns.
(16) and (17) are two equations for x and y in terms of p. These are the parametric equations of the solution of the given differential equat.
Let us look at another example.
Example 4: Solve y = 2px + p4x2, x > 0.
109MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The given equation y = 2px + p4x2 …(18) is in itself solvable for y. differentiating it w.r. to x, we get dp dp p = 2p + 2x + 2xp4 + 4x2p3 dx dx (cid:222) p(1 + 2xp3) + 2x dp (1+2xp3) = 0, dx dp (1+2xp3) + (p+2x ) = 0 ...(19) (cid:222) dx dp Eqn.
(19) holds when either of the factors (1+2xp3) or (p + 2x ) is zero.
dx First consider the factor dp P+ 2x = 0 dx 2dp 1 + = 0 (cid:222) pdx x Integrating the above equation w.r.t.x, we get 2 In |p| + In |x| = constant.
p2x = c, (c an arbitrary constant) (cid:222) c or p = .
x Substituting this value of p in the given Eqn.
(18), we get Y = 2 cx+ c2 Which is the required solution.
If we consider the factor 1 + 2xp3 = 0 in Eqn.
(19), then by eliminating p between this factor and given Eqn.
(18), we get another solution.
This solution will not contain any arbitrary constant and is the singular solution of the given equation.
How about trying an exercise now?
We next consider the case when Eqn.
(8) is solvable for x.
3.2.2 Equations Solvable for x Consider an equation of the form 110MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION P3 – 4xyp + 8y2 = 0 ...(20) It is difficult to solve Eqn.
(20) for y whereas it is easy to solve it for x as a function of y and p and write p3+ 8y2 x = .
4yp In such cases when equation of the form (8) is solvable for x, and can be put in the form x = g(y,p) …(21) then to solve it, we differentiate Eqn.
(21) w.r. to y, and get an equation of the form 1 (cid:230) dp(cid:246) = ø (cid:231) y,p, (cid:247) p Ł dxł on solving this equation we obtain a relation between p and y in the form f(y,p,c) = 0, …(22) where c is an arbitrary constant.
Now, we may eliminate p between Eqn (21) and (22) to obtain the solution or, x and y may be expressed in terms of p as we have done in Sec.
4.3.1.
Remark: Note that when Eqn.
(8) is solvable for y, we differentiate it w.r. to x, whereas, when it is solvable for x, we differentiate it w.r. to y.
We illustrate this method by the following examples.
(cid:230) p (cid:246) Example 5: Solve p = tan (cid:231)(cid:231) x- (cid:247)(cid:247) .
Ł 1+ p2 ł Solution: The given equation can be written as p X = tan-1p + ...(23) 1+ p2 Differentiating Eqn.
(23) w.r. y, we get p dp (1+ p2)- p(2p) 1 dp = + p 1+ p2 dy (1+ p2)2 dy 1+ p2+1+ p2- 2p2 = (1+ p2)2 111MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 2 dp = (1+ p2)2 dy 2p dy = dp (cid:222) (1+ p2)2 …(24) Note that Eqn.
(24) is in variable separable form.
Integrating Eqn.
(24), we get 1 y = c - , …(25) 1+ p2 c being an arbitrary constant.
It is not possible to eliminate p between Eqns.
(23) and (25).
Thus, Eqns.
(23) and (25) together constitute the solution of the given equation in terms of parameter p. Let us look at another example.
Example 6: Solve p2y + 2px = " x, y and p > 0 Solution: We can write the given equation in the form y py - X = ...(26) 2p 2 Differentiating Eqn.
(26) w.r. to y, we get 1 y(cid:230) 1 (cid:246) dp p y dp 1 (cid:231) - (cid:247) - + = + (cid:231) (cid:247) , p 2p 2Ł p2 ł dy 2 2 dy 1 p y dp (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) (cid:222) + + (cid:231)(cid:231) 1+ (cid:247)(cid:247) = 0 2p 2 2 dy Ł p2 ł 1+ p2 y (cid:230) 1+ p2 (cid:246) dp (cid:231) (cid:247) (cid:222) + (cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 2p 2 Ł p2 ł dy 1+ p2 (cid:230) y dp(cid:246) (cid:222) (cid:231)(cid:231) 1+ (cid:247)(cid:247) = 0 …(27) 2p Ł p dył In Eqn.
(27), we may have 1+ p2 = 0 2p 112MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (cid:230) y dp(cid:246) or (cid:231)(cid:231) 1+ (cid:247)(cid:247) = 0.
Ł p dył If we have first factor equals zero, then p2 = -1.
Thus real solution of the given problem is obtained when 1 1 dp + = 0 y p dy Here variables are separable.
Integrating, we get Iny + Inp = Inc py = c (cid:222) c or p = …(28) y Eliminating p between Eqn.s (26) and (28), we get y2 c y X = - 2c y 2 y2 c or x = - , 2c 2 which is the required solution.
2p Note that you could also have solved Example 6 by taking y = and then 1- p2 proceeding as in sec.
4.3.1.
You may now try the following exercise.
We now consider Eqn.
(8) with the property that Eqn.
(8) may be solvable for p. in that case Eqn.
(8) which is of nt degree in p, in general, is reduced to n equations of the first degree and this case has been considered in Section 4.2.
We next take up the case when Eqn.
(8) may not contain either independent variable x, or, dependent variable y explicitly.
3.2.3 Equations in which Independent Variable or Dependent Variable is Absent We shall consider the two cases separately.
113MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Case 1: Equations not containing the independent variable: When Eqn.
(8) does not contain independent variable explicitly then the equation has the form f(y,p) = 0 …(29) For instance, consider the equation 1 y - = 0.
1+ p2 This equation does not contain x explicitly.
Also, it is readily solvable for y, since it can be written in the form 1 y = …(30) 1+ p2 Eqn.
(30) can, now, be solved by the method discussed in Sec.
4.3.1.
In case Eqn.
(29) is solvable for p, then we can write it in the form dy p = = ø(y) …(31) dx The integral of Eqn.
(31) will, then, give us the solution of Eqn.
(29).
To be more clear, let us consider the following example.
Example7: Solve y = 2p + 3p2 Solution: We have y = 2p + 3p2 which is already in the form y = F(p).
following the method discussed in sec.
4.3.1, we differentiate it w.r.t.x, so that dp dp p = 2 + 6p dx dx p dp or = 2+ 6p dx Here variable are separable and we have 114MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (cid:230) 2 (cid:246) dx = (cid:231)(cid:231) + 6(cid:247)(cid:247) dp Ł p ł Integrating, we get x = 6p + 2In |p| + c. …(33) c being an arbitrary constant.
Since it is not possible to eliminate p from Eqns.
(32) and (33), these equations together yield the required solution in terms of the parameter p. Let us look at another example Example 8: Solve y2 = a2 (1 + p2) …(34) Solution: The given equation is an equation in y and p only.
It can be written as y2 P2 = - 1 a2 Solving for p, we get y2 p= – a2- 1 y2 y2 \ Either p = or p = - , a2- 1 a2- 1 y2 Now p - 1+ gives a2 a dy = dx.
y2- a2 Integrating the above equation, we get A In |y + y2- a2 | = x + c, c being an arbitrary constant.
y2 Similarly, p = - - 1+ , on integration, yields a2 a In |y + y2- a2 | = -x + c (c being a constant).
Hence, the general solution of the given equation is [a In |y + y2- a2 | - x – c] [a In |y + y2- a2 | + x – c] = 0 115MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Note that we solve Eqn.
(34) for p. You could also have integrated it by solving it for y.
We next consider the equations in which the dependent variable is absent.
Case II: Equations not containing the dependent variable: In this case Eqn.
(8) has the form g(x, p) = 0 or x = F(p) …(35) As in case 1, Eqn.
(35) is either solvable for p or solvable for x. if it is solvable for p, then it can be written as p = ψ(x) which, on integration, gives the solution of Eqn.
(35) If Eqn.
(35) is solvable for x, then it corresponds to the case discussed in Section 4.3.2.
We give below examples to illustrate the theory.
Example 9: Solve x(1+p2) = 1 Solution: The given equation can be written as 1 x = …(36) 1+ p2 Differentiating Eqn.
(36) w.r. to y, we get - 2p 1 dp = , p (1+ p2)2 dy - 2p2 i.e., dy dp (1+ p2)2 Ø - 1 1 ø + i.e., dy = 2Œ œ dp º 1+ p2 (1+ p2)2ß Here variables are separable.
Integrating, we get dp (cid:242) y = - 2 tan-1p + 1 + c …(37) (1+ p2)2 c is a constant.
116MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Eqns.
(36) and (37) together yield the required solution with p as parameter.
Note that problem in example 9 could have also been done by solving it for p. we illustrate this method in the next example.
Example 10: Solve p2 – 2xp + 1 = 0 Solution: The given equation is P2 – 2xp + 1 = 0 Solving for p, we get 2x– 4x2- 4 p = = x – x2- 1 2 \ Either p = x + x2- 1 or p = x - x2- 1 Now p = x + x2- 1, on integration yields x2 x x2- 1 1 y = + - In |x + x2- 1| + c, 2 2 2 c being an arbitrary constant.
Similarly, p = x - x2- 1 yields x2 1 1 y = - x x2- 1+ In |x + x2- 1| + c, 2 2 2 Hence, the general solution of the given equation is [x2 + x x2- 1 - In |x + x2- 1| - 2y + c ] [x2 – x x2- 1 + In|x + x2- 1|-2y + c ] 1 1 = 0.
Where c = 2c is an arbitrary constant.
1 And now some exercise for you.
We next discuss the case when Eqn.
(8) may be homogeneous in x and y 3.2.4 Equations Homogeneous in x and y In this case, Eqn.
(8) can be expressed in the form (cid:230) y(cid:246) Ø (cid:231) p, (cid:247) = 0 …(38) Ł xł 117MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION For solving Eqn.
(38), we can proceed in two ways.
In case Eqn.
(38) is solvable for p then it can be expressed as dy (cid:230) y(cid:246) P = = f(cid:231) (cid:247) …(39) dx Ł xł We already know from our knowledge of unit 2 that equations of the type (39) can be solved by using the substitution y = vx.
The second possibility, that is, when Eqn.
(38) is solvable for y/x, then it can be put in the form y = ψ(p) or y = x (p).
ψ x In this case we can proceed as in Sec.
4.3.1.
Differentiating the above equation w.r. to x, we get dp p = (p) + x '(p) ψ ψ dx dx ψ'(p)dp = …(40) (cid:222) x p- ψ(p) Eqn.
(40 is in variable separable form.
On integrating, it yields ψ'(p) (cid:242) In|x| = c + dp p- ψ(p) = c + ø(p), say.
The elimination of p between this equation and y = x (p) will give us the ψ required solution.
But it is not always easy to eliminate p, so it may be retained as the parameter.
To understand the theory, we take an example.
Example 11: Solve y2 + xyp – x2p2 = 0 x, y, p > 0. "
Solution: The given equation is homogeneous in y and x and it may be written as (cid:230) y(cid:246) (cid:230) y(cid:246) 2 p2 - (cid:231) (cid:247) p - (cid:231) (cid:247) = 0 …(41) Ł xł Ł xł 118MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solving Eqn.

[y-x(xc) -(√5+1)/2] = 0 i.e., y2 – xy [(xc) (√5-1)/2 + (xc) -(√5+1)/2] + x2 (xc)-1 = 0 Now you may try the following exercise.
We next discuss the case when Eqn.
(8) may be of first degree in x and y.
3.2.5 Equations of the First Degree in x and y – Clairaut’s equation When Eqn.
(8) is of first degree in x and y, it is solvable for x and y both and hence can be put in either of the following forms.
y = xf (p) + f (p) …(42) 1 2 or x = yg (p) + g (p) …(43) 1 2 119MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Hence, we can use the methods discussed in Sec.
4.3.1 and 4.3.2 to solve equations of the for (42) and (43), respectively.
However, if in Eqn.
(42), f (p) = p, then we get one particular form of this equation 1 known as Clairaut’s Equation and about which we have already mentioned in sec.
4.1.
Thus the Clairaut’s equation is of the form y = px + f(p) …(44) In Eqn.
(44), f(p) is a known function which contains neither x nor y explicitly.
also, note, that Eqn.
(44) can be non-linear.
For instance, y = px + p2 and y = x + ep are examples of Caliraut equation.
But equations y = xy + p2 or y = xp + yp2 are not of the Clairaut’s form.
On differentiating Eqn.
(44) w.r. to x, we have p = p + p'x + f'(p)p' …(45) p' [x + f'(p)] = 0 (cid:222) dp Then either p' = = 0 …(46) dx Or, x + f'(p) = 0 …(47) The solution of Eqn.
(46) is p = c, where c is an arbitrary constant.
Thus, we can write the general solution of Eqn.
(44) as y = cx + f(c) …(48) Note that Eqn.
(48) is an equation of a family of straight lines.
Now consider Eqn.
(47).
Since f(p) and f'(p) are known functions of p, Eqns.
(47) and (44) together constitute a set of parametric equations giving x and y in terms of the parameter p. If we can eliminate p from Eqn.
(44) and (47) and if the resulting equation satisfies Eqn.
(44), we get another solution of Eqn.
(44) (could be an implicit solution).
This solution does not contain an arbitrary constant and is a singular solution of Eqn.
(44).
We give you some examples to help you understand this method.
Example 12: Solve (y')2 + 4xy' – 4y = 0 …(49) Solution: With p = y', Eqn.
*49) can be written as 120MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 y = px + p2, …(50) 4 which is in the Clairaut’s form.
Differentiating Eqn.
(50) w.r. to x, we get p p = p + p'x + p' 2 p p'(x + ) = 0 (cid:222) 2 then either p = 0 which gives p = c ( a constant) …(51) p or x + = 0 …(52) 2 From Eqns.
(50) and (51), we obtain c2 y = cx + 4 as the solution of Eqn.
(50).
Eliminating p from Eqns.
(50) and (52), we get 1 y = x(-2x) + ( -2x)2, 4 i.e., y(x) = - x2, which contains no arbitrary constant.
Since this value of y satisfies Eqn.
(50), it is the singular solution of Eqn.
(50).
Let us look at another example.
1 Example 13: Solve y = xp + p Solution: If we compare the given equation with Eqn.
(44) we notice that in the 1 1 case f(p) = and f'(p) .
From Eqn.
(48) then the solution is given by p p2 1 y = ax + a „ where a ( 0) is an arbitrary constant.
Also in this case, equation corresponding to Eqn.
(47) is 1 0 = x p2 The elimination of p between the above equation and the given equation yields y2 = 4x, 121MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION which is a singular solution of the given equation.
You may, now, try the following exercises.
Finally, we take up in the next solution, another non-linear equation known as Riccati’s equation, which we mentioned in Sec.
4.1 3.2.6 Riccati’s Equation Originally, this name was given to the first order differential equation dy + by2 = cmm, …(53) dx where b, c and m are constants.
This is known as the special Riccati equation.
Eqn.
(53) is solvable in finite terms only if the exponent m is – 2 or, of the form - 4k for some integer k. Riccati merely discussed special cases of this equation (2k+1) without offering any solutions.
Now a days Riccati’s equation is usually understood by an equation of the form.
y' = a(x) + b(x) y + c(x)y2 …(54) where a, b and c are given functions of x on an interval 1 (of R).
Equations y' = 1 + xy + exy2 and y' = x + x2y + sin (x)y2 are example of Riccati’s equations whereas, equations y' = 1 + y + y3, and y' = 1 + y + 2y2 are not of Riccati’s type.
It is difficult to obtain a solution of Riccati’s Eqn.
(54) containing an arbitrary constant.
But, the general solution of Eqn.
(53) can be obtained if we have the knowledge of a particular solution of Eqn.
(53).
This can be done as follows: Let y be a solution of Eqn (53) Then we determine a function v so that y defined 1 bu the relation 1 y = y + …(55) 1 v is a solution of Eqn.
(54).
Differentiating Eqn.
(55) w.r. to x, we get (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) y' = y + v (cid:231) - (cid:247) 1 Ł v2 ł Since y and y satisfy eqn.
(54), we have 1 y ' = a(x) + b(x)y + c(x)y 2 1 1 1 122MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION v' and y ' - = a(x) + b(x)y + c(x) y2 1 v2 subtracting the second equation from the first, we have (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) v' (cid:231) (cid:247) = b(x) (y -y) + c(x) (y 2 – y2) Ł v2 ł 1 1 or v' = b(x) v2(y – y) + c(x) (y –y) (y + y)v2 …(56) 1 1 1 From Eqn.
(55), we have (y – y ) v = 1 or (y – y) v = - 1 …(57) 1 1 Also, (y + y)v = (2y + y – y )v = 2y v + 1 (y – y )v = 2y v+1 (using Eqn (57)) 1 1 1 1 1 1 Now (y 2 – y2)v2 = (y – y)v.(y + y)v 1 1 1 = ( - 1) (2y v + 1) = - 1- 2y v …(58) 1 1 Substituting from Eqn (58) in Eqn (55), we get v' = - (b(x) + 2c(x)y )v – c(x), …(59) 1 which is a linear (non-homogeneous) equation for determining a function v. the general solution of Eqn.
(59) contains an arbitrary constant and the substitution of this general solution in Eqn.
(54 gives us the solution of Eqn.
(53) containing an arbitrary constant.
Let us now go through some examples to understand the above theory.
Example 14: Solve y' = - y + x2y2 Solution: On comparing this equation with Eqn (53) we find that in this case a = 0, b = -1 and c = x2 (1 = R).
The given equation is a Riccati’s Equation which has a (particular) solution y = 0. by using the substitution 1 1 1 1 y = y + = 0 + = 1 v v v in Eqn (58), we have v' = v – x2 …(60) Eqn.
(60) is a linear first order equation with I.F.
= e(cid:242) - 1dx = e-x Hence, the general solution of Eqn.
(60) is v = - ex (cid:242) e-x x2+ dx + Aex = (x2 + 2x + 2) + Aex and the solution of the given equation is 123MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 y = , Aex+ x2+ 2x+ 2 which contains an arbitrary constant.
Let us look at another example.
Example 15: Solve y' = - 1- x2 + y2.
Solution: By inspection, we see that y (x) = - x is a solution of the given 1 equation.
Comparing the given equation with Eqn.
(53), we get a = -1- x2, b = 0 and c = = 1.
1 1 We look for a function v, so that y = y + = - x + .
1 v v In this case Eqn.
(58) reduces to v' = 2xv – 1 dv - 2xv = -1 (cid:222) dx The integrating factor for this equation is e-x2, and so it can be written as d [e-x2v] = - e-x2 dx Thus, on integration, we write e-x2v = -(cid:242) e- x2 dx + c or, v = ex2 [- (cid:242) e-x2 dx + c] where c is an arbitrary constant.
So, the required solution is e- x2 y(x) = - x + - (cid:242) e- x2+ c Now the integral (cid:242) e-x2 dx cannot be evaluated in terms of elementary functions.
x When an initial condition is specified, then integral of the form (cid:242) e- t2 dt can be x 0 used.
You may now try the following exercises: 3.3 Bernoulli Equation 124MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Reduction of non-linear equation to linear form.
Here, we shall illustrate that certain non-linear first order differential equations may be reduced to linear form by a suitable change of the dependent variable.
The differential equation y' + p(x)y = g(x)ya where ‘a’ is a real number is call the “Bernoulli Equation”.
For a = 0 and a= 1 the equation is linear, and otherwise it is non-linear.
Set {y(x)}1-a = u(x) and show that the equation assume the linear form.

Matheus’s law states that the time rate of change of a population y(t) is proportional to x(t).
this holds for many populations as they are not too large.
A more refined model is the logistic law given by dy = ay – by2……… (a > 0, b> 0) dt where the “breaking term” = by2 has the effect that the population cannot grow indefinitely.

MODULE 3 129MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION UNIT 1 FAMILIES OF CURVES ORTHOGONAL AND OBLIYUE TRAYECTORIES.
APPLICATION TO MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Orthogonal Trajectories 3.2 Application to Orthogonal Trajectories 3.3 Approximate Solutions: Direction fields, Iteration 3.3.1 Method of Direct Fields 3.3.2 Picards iteration method 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this section we shall learn how to use differential equations for finding curve that intersect given curves at right angles, a task that arises rather often in applications.
If for each fixed real value of c the equation (1) F(x, y, c) = 0 represents a curve in the xy-plane and if for variable c it represents infinitely many curves, then the totality of these curves is called a one- parameter family of curves, and c is called the parameter of the family.
2.0 OBJECTIVES • To find family of curves • To be able to solve differential equation of family of curves • One should be able to apply orthogonal trajectories to (i) Electrical field.
(2) Mechanical field.
(3) Temperature • Also to be able to find approximate solutions to directions fields iteration.
Example 1: Families of curves The equation 130MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (2) F(x, y, c) = x + y + c = 0 represents a family of parallel straight lines; each line corresponds to precisely one value of the parameter c. The equation (3) F(x, y, c) = x2 + y2 – x2 = 0 Represents a family of concentric circles of radius c with center at the origin.
The general solution of a first-order differential equation involves a parameter c and thus represents a family of curves.
This yields a possibility for representing many one-parameter families of curves by first-order differential equations.
The practical use of such representations will become obvious from our further considerations.
Example 2: Differential equations of families of curves By differentiating (2) we see that y' + 1 = 0 is the differential equation of that family of straight lines.
Similarly, the differential equation of the family (3) is obtained by differentiation, 2x + 2yy' = 0, that is, y' = x/y.
if the equation obtained by differentiating (1) still contains the parameter c, then we have to eliminate c from this equation by using (1).
Let us illustrate this by a simple example.
Example 3: eliminate of the parameter of a family The differential equation of the family of parabolas (4) y = cx2 is obtained by differentiating (4), (5) y' = 2cx, and by eliminating x from (5).
From (4) we have c = y/x2, and by substituting this into (5) we find the desired result (6) y' = 2y/x.
131MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION note that we may also proceed as follows.
We solve (4) for c, finding c = y/ x2, and differentiate 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Orthogonal Trajectories In many engineering and other applications, a family of curves is given, and it is required to find another family whose curves intersect each of the given curves at right angles.14 The curves of the two families are said to be mutually orthogonal, they form an orthogonal net, and the curves of the family to be obtained are called the orthogonal trajectories of the given curves (and conversely); cf.
fig.
1.
Let us mention some familiar examples.
The meridians on the earth’s surface are the orthogonal trajectories of the parallels.
On a map the curves of steepest descent are the orthogonal trajectories of the contour lines.
In electrostatics the equipotential lines and the lines of electric force are orthogonal trajectories of each other.
An illustrative example is shown in Fig.
2.
We shall see later that orthogonal trajectories are important in various fields of physics, for example, in pydrodynamics and heat conduction.
Given a family of curves F(x, y, c) = 0 that can be represented by a differential equation (7) y' = f(x, y) we may find the corresponding orthogonal trajectories as follows.
From (7) we see that a curve of the given family that passes through a point (x , y ) has the slop 0 0 f(x , y ) at this point.
The slop of the orthogonal trajectory through (x , y ) at this 0 0 0 0 point should be the negative reciprocal of (x , y ), that is, - 1/f(x , y ), because this 0 0 0 0 is the condition for the tangents of the two curves at x , y ) to be perpendicular.
0 0 Consequently, the differential equation of the orthogonal trajectories is (8) 1 - y' = f(x,y) and the trajectories are obtained by solving this new differential equation.

Solution: we first determine the differential equation of the given family, by differentiating (9) with respect to x we obtain 133MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 10) 2x + 2(y – c)y' = 0.
We must eliminate c. solving (9) fir x, we have x2+ y2 11) c = 2y By inserting this into (10) and simplifying we get y2- x2 2xy x + y' = 0 or y' = .
2y x2- y2 From this and (8) we see that the differential equation of the orthogonal trajectories is x2- y2 y' = - or 2xyy' – y2 + x2 = 0.

4: Circle and their orthogonal trajectories in Example 4 trajectories (dashed) in Example 5 In the next section we motivate and discuss two methods of obtaining approximate solutions without actually solving a given differential equation.
The first method, called the method of direction fields, can relatively easily produce a general picture of the solutions (with limited accuracy) and is of great practical interest.
The second method, Picard’s iteration, is more theoretical; its practical value is limited, since it involved integrations.

Indeed, there are various differential equations, even of the first order, for which one cannot obtain formulas for solutions.
15 There are other differential equations for which such formulas can be derived, but they are so complicated that they are practically useless.
Finally, since a differential equation is a model of a physical or other system, and in modeling we disregard factors of minor influence in order to keep the model simple, the differential equation will describe the given situation only approximately, and an approximate solution will often be practically as informative as an exact solution.
Approximate solutions of differential equations can be obtained by numerical methods.
These are discussed in sec 20.1 and 20.2. at present we shall consider the method of direction field, which is a geometric procedure, and then the so- called Picard iteration, which gives formulas for approximate solutions.
3.3.1 Method of Direction Fields In this method we get a rough picture of all solutions of a given differential equation 1) y' = f(x, y) without actually solving the equation.
The idea is quite natural and simple, as follows.
136MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION We assume that the function f is defined in some region of the xy-plane, so that at each point in that region it has one (and only one) value.
The 15Reference [All] in Appendix 1 includes more than 1500 important differential equations and their solutions, arranged in systematic order and accompanied by numbers references to original literature.
Solutions of (1) can be plotted as curves in the xy-plane.
We do not know the solutions, but we see from (1) that a solution passing through a point (x , y ) must 0 0 have the slope f(x , y ) at this point.
This suggests the following method.
0 0 Ist Step (Isoclines).
We graph some of the curves in the xy-plane along which f(x, y) is constant.
These curves f(x, y) = k = const are called curves of constant slope or isoclines.
Here the value of k differs from isoclines to isocline.
So these are not yet the solution curves of (1), but just auxiliary curves.
2nd Step (Direction field).
Along the isocline f(x, y) = k we draw a number of parallel short line segments (lineal elements) with slope k, which is the slop of solution curves of (1) at any point of that isocline.
This we do for all isoclines which we graphed before.
In this way we obtain a field of lineal elements, called the direction field of (1).
3rd Step (Approximate solution curves).
With the help of the lineal elements we can now easily graph approximation curves to the (unknown) solution curves of the given equation (1) and thus obtain a qualitatively correct picture of these solution curves.
It suffices to illustrate the method by a simple equation that can be solved exactly, so that we get a feeling for the accuracy of the method.
Example 1: Isoclines, direction field Graph the direction field of the first-order differential equation 2) y' = xy and an approximation to the solution curve through the point (1, 2).
Compare with the exact solution.
137MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The isoclines are the equilateral hyperbolas xy = k together with the coordinate axes.
We graph some of them.
Then we draw lineal elements by sliding a triangle along a fixed ruler.
The result is shown in Fig.
6, which also shows an approximation to the solution curve passing through the point (1, 2).
By separating variables, y = cex2/2.
The initial condition is y(1) = 2.
Hence 2 = ce1/2, and the exact solution is y = 2e(x2- 1)/2.
Fig.
7: Direction field of the differential equation (2) 3.3.2 Picard’s Iteration method16 This method gives approximate solutions of an initial value problem 3) y' = f(x, y), y(x ) = y 0 0 Which is assume to have a unique solution in some interval on the x-axist containing x .
Picard’s existence and uniqueness theorem, which we shall discuss 0 in the next section.
Its practical value is limited because it involves integrations that may be complicated.
The basic idea of Picard’s method is very simple.
By integration we see that (3) may be written in the form 138MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 4) (cid:242) x y(x) = y + f[t,y(t)] dt 0 x 0 Where t denotes the variable of integration.
In fact, when x = x the integral is 0 zero and y = y , so that (4) satisfies the initial condition in (3); furthermore, by 0 differentiating (4) we obtain the differential equation in (3).
To find approximations to the solution y(x) of (4) we proceed as follows.
We substitute the crude approximation y = y = const on the right; this yields the 0 presumably better approximation (cid:242) x y (x) = y + f(t,y ) dt.
1 0 0 x 0 In the next step we substitute the function y (x) in the same way to get 1 (cid:242) x y (x) = y + f[t,y (t)] dt 2 0 1 x 0 etc.
The nth step of this iteration gives an approximating function 5) (cid:242) x y (x) = y + f[t,y (t()] dt.
n 0 n- 1 x 0 In this way we obtain a sequence of approximations.
y (x), y (x),……….. y (x),………, 1 2 n and we shall see in the next section that the conditions under which this sequence converges to the solution y(x) of (3) are relatively general.
16EMILE PICARD (1856 – 1941), French mathematician, professor in Paris since 1881, also known for his important contributions to complex analysis (see Sec 14.10 for his famous theorem).
An iteration method is a method that yields a sequence of approximations to an (unknown) function, say, y , y …., where the nth approximation, y , is obtained in 1 2 n the nth step by using one (or several) of the previous approximations, and the operation performed in each step is the same.
This is a practical advantage, for instance in programming for numerical work.
139MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION In the simplest case, y is obtained from y ; denoting the operation by T, we may n n-1 write y = T(y ).
n n-1 Picard’s method is of this type, because (5) may be written (cid:242) x Y )x) = T(y (x)) = y + f(t,y (t)) dt.
n n-1 0 n- 1 x 0 To illustrate the method, let us apply it to an equation we can readily solve exactly, so that we may compare the approximations with the exact solution.
The example to be discussed will also illustrate that the question of the convergence of the method is of practical interest.
Example 2: Picard iteration Find approximate solution to the initial value problem y' = 1 + y2, y(0) = 0 Solution: In this case, x = 0, f(x, y) = 1 + y2, and (5) becomes 0 y (x) = (cid:242) x[1+ y2 (t)]= x+ (cid:242) xy2 (t) dt.
n n- 1 n- 1 0 0 Starting from y = 0, we thus obtain (cf.
Fig.
8) 0 y (x) = x + (cid:242) x0 dt = x 1 0 y (x) = x + (cid:242) xt2dt = x+ 1x3 2 0 3 y (x) = x + (cid:242) x(cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:230) t+ t3(cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:246) 2dt = x+ 1x3+ 2 x5+ 1 x7 3 0 Ł 3 ł 3 15 63 etc.
of course, we can obtain the exact solution of our present problem by separating variables (see Example 2 in Sec 1.2), finding 1 2 17 (cid:230) π π(cid:246) 6) y(x) = tan x = x + x3+ x5+ x7+... (cid:231) - < x < (cid:247) .
3 15 315 Ł 2 2ł 140MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION The first three terms of y (x) and the series in (6) are the same.
The series in (6) 3 p converges for |x| < /2.
This illustrates that the study of convergence is of practical importance.
The next section, the last of Chap.
1, concerns the problems of existence and uniqueness of solutions of first-order differential equations.
These problems are of greater relevance to engineering applications than one would at first be inclined to believe.
This is so because modeling involves the discarding of minor factors, and in more complicated situations it is often difficult to see whether some physical factor will have a minor or major effect, so that one may not be sure whether a model is faithful and does have a solution, or a unique solution, even though the physical system can be expected to behave reasonably.
The matter becomes even more crycial in connection with numerical methods: make sure that the solution exists before you try to compute it.

Further in the introduction to Block 2, we have mentioned that the governing differential equations in many physical or biological problems are not necessarily of first order.
Besides the differential equations arrived at, in discussing the above said models may be linear or non-linear.
Even among linear differential equations, the coefficients of the differentials may be constants or a function of an independent variable.
In this unit we classify the general linear differential equations into two broad categories: i) homogeneous and non-homogeneous ii) equations with constant coefficients and variable coefficients.
For a general linear differential equation with variable coefficients, we shall state the conditions under which a unique solution can be found.
Further, we shall learn 144MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION methods of finding the complete solutions of homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit, you should be able to • Identify linear differential equations with constant as well as with variable coefficients.
• Identify homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear differential equations.
• Describe the conditions under which a unique solution of a linear differential equation exists.
• Write the complete primitive of a given differential equation when its various independent integrals are known.
• Classify solutions of non-homogeneous equations into complementary function and particular integral.
• Obtain a solution for a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 General Equation We begin our discussion by considering the most general linear differential equation which is of the form dny dn- 1y dy a (x) + a (x) + ….+ a (x) + a (x) y = b (x) …(1) 0 dxn 1 dxn- 1 n-1 dx n For, a (x) = 0, the differential equation is of nth order.
The coefficients a (x), 0 0 a (x), …., a (x) are functions of independent variable x. Eqn.
(1) is called general 1 n linear differential equation of nth order with variable coefficients.
In case coefficients a (x), a (x),….a (x) are all constants and do not depend on x, 0 1 n then Eqn.
(1) will be termed as general linear differential equation of nth order d3y d2y with constant coefficients.
For example, equation + 3 + y = x2 is a dx3 dx2 third order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.
Further, the right hand side of Eqn.
(1), i.e., b(x) may assume one of the following forms: 145MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION i) b(x) = 0 ii) b(x) = constant iii) b9x) a function of x. when b(x) = 0, Eqn.
(1) is classified as the general homogeneous linear differential equation.
This is also known as the reduced equation of Eqn.
(1).
For example, equation d3y d2y dy - 4 + + 6y = 0 dx3 dx2 dx is a third order linear differential equation.
But if b(x) in Eqn.
(1) is a constant or a function of x, then Eqn.
(1) is called general non-homogeneous linear differential equation.
d4y d3y Equation + + 3y = x2 + 1 is a linear non-homogeneous equation of 4th dx4 dx3 d2y dy order with constant coefficients; where equation x3 + x2 + xy = 2 is a dx2 dx second order non-homogeneous linear differential equation with variable coefficient.
Now suppose that we are required to find the solution of Eqn.
(1) on some interval ˛ 1 which also satisfy, at some point x = 1 the conditions, 0 y(x ) = y , y'(x ) =,…., y(n-1) (x ) = y(n- 1) …(2) 0 0 0 0 0 Note: Depending on the context, i could represent ]a, b[ ]0, ¥ [, ] -¥ ¥ , [ and so on.
Where y , y' , …., y(n- 1) are arbitrary constants, then Eqns.
(1) and (2) together 0 0 0 constitute an initial-value problem (IVP).
The values y(x ) = y y'(x ) = y' ,….., 0 0 0 0 y(n- 1) (x ) = y(n- 1) are called initial conditions.
0 0 0 In the case of a linear second order equation, we can interpret geometrically a solution to the initial value problem d2y dy a (x) + a (x) + a (x) y = b(x) n-2 dx2 n-1 dx n y(x ) = y , y'( ) = y' 0 0 0 0 146MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION as a function defined on I whose graph passes through (x , y ) such that the slope 0 0 of the curve at the point is the number y' .
0 You may note here that an equation of the form (1) may not always have a solution.
Moreover, even if its solution exists it may not be unique.
Let us now study the conditions under which the solution of Eqn.
(1), if it exists shall be unique.
3.1.1 Conditions for the Existence of a unique solution We may write the general non-homogeneous linear differential Eqn.
(1) in the form L(y) = [a (x) Dn+ + a (x) Dn-1 + … + a (x) D + a (x)] y = b(x) …(3) 0 1 n-1 n dy d2 dn Where D = , D2 = , …, Dn = .
dx dx2 dxn The expression in the parentheses in Eqn.
(3) is termed as a symbolic polynomial or operator polynomial or simply a differential operator.
Thus we have herein introduced linear differential operator L of order n given by the expression L = a (x) Dn + a (x)Dn-1 + … + a (x) D + a (x) …(4) 0 1 n-1 n In unit 8, we shall learn, in more details, about the differential operators and their properties.
We now choose an interval I = [a b, ] for a b, real and assume that the coefficients a (x), a (x), …., a (x) and the function are continuous one-valued functions of x 0 1 n throughout the interval and that a (x) does not vanish at any point of the interval.
0 We know that the complete solution of Eqn.
(3) shall involve arbitrary constants whose number is equal to the order of the highest derivative involved in it, i.e., n in this case.
In order to obtain a unique solution of Eqn.
(3), it is necessary to specify n initial conditions in terms of constant values of dn- 1y dy y, , …., dx dxn- 1 at any point x of the interval [a b, ].
0 147MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION We now state a theorem which gives the conditions whose fulfillment guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution of Eqn.
(3).
Theorem 1: If the functions a (x), a (x), …., a (x) and b(x) are continuous 0 1 n function of x in the interval [a b, ] and a (x) does not vanish at any point of that 0 interval, then the initial Eqn.
(3) admits of a unique solution of the form y = f(x), which together with its first (n-1_ derivatives, is continuous in [a b, ] and satisfies the following initial conditions: (cid:230) dy(cid:246) (cid:230) dn- 1y(cid:246) y(x0) = y0 (cid:231)Ł dx(cid:247)ł = y'0 ,…., (cid:231)Ł dxn- 1(cid:247)ł = y(0n-1) , x= x0 x= x0 where x is a point of the interval [a b, ].
0 We shall not be proving this theorem here as it is beyond the scope of the present course.
However, if the functions a (x), a (x),…., a (x) are constants, we shall 0 1 n give the solution of the corresponding equation in Sec.
5.4 when b(x) = 0 and in „ units 6, 7 and 8 when b(x) 0.
We now illustrate this theorem with the help of a few examples.
Example 1: Show that y = 3e2x + e-2x – 3x is a unique solution of the initial value problem y" – 4y = 12x y(0) = 4 h'(0) = 1.
Solution: We have y = 3e2x + e-2x – 3x, therefore, y' = 6e2x – 2e-2x 3 and y" = 12e2x + 4e-2x Now y" = 4y = 12e2x + 4e-2x – 4(3e2x + e-2x – 3x) = 12e2x + 4e-2x – 12e2x – 4e-2x + 12x = 12x Also, y(0) = 3e2.0 + e-2.0 – 3.0 = 4 Y'(0) = 6e2.0 – 2e-2.0 – 3 = 1.
Thus, y = 3e2x + e-2x – 3x is a solution of the given initial value problem.
Moreover, the given differential equation is linear and the coefficients as well as b(x) = 12x are continuous on any interval containing x = 0. we conclude from Theorem 1 that the given function is the unique solution of the given initial vlue problem.
Remember that both the requirements in Theorem 1, that is a(x), i = 0, 1, …., n i be continuous and a (x) 0 for every x in some interval say I are important.
0 „ 148MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Specifically, if a (x) = 0 for some x in the interval then the solution of a liner 0 initial value problem may not be unique or may not even exist.
We now illustrate this through an example.
Example 2: Obtain the value of c for which the function y = cx2 + x + 3 is a unique solution of the initial value problem x2y" – 2xy' + 2y = 6, y(0) = 3, y'(0) = 1 On the interval ]- , [.
¥ ¥ Solution: Since y' = 2cx + 1 and y" = 2c, it follows that X2y" – 2xy' + 2y = x2(2c) – 2x(2cx + 1) + 2(cx2 + x + 3) = 2cx2 – 4cx2 – 2x + 2cx2 + 2x + 6 = 6 Also, y(0) = c.(0)2 + 0 + 3 = 3 and y' (0) = 2c.0 + 1 = 1 Thus, y = cx2 + x + 3 is a solution of the given problem for all values of c in the given interval.
The problem does not have a unique solution.
In this case although the given equation is liner and its coefficients and b(x) = 6 are continuous everywhere but the coefficient of y" i.e., x2 is zero at x = 0.
You may now try the following exercise.
You might be familiar with the liner dependence and independence of a set of functions on an interval.
Before we study some elementary properties of the solution of linear differential equations, ;et us recall these two concepts which are basic to the study of linear differential equations.
3.1.2 Linear Dependence and Independence We begin with the following two definitions.
Definition: A set of function y (x), y (x),…., y (x) is said to be linearly 1 2 n independent on an interval I if there exist constants.
C , c , …., c (x) not all zero, 1 2 n such that C y (x) + c y (x) +….+ c y (x) = 0 1 1 2 2 n n 149MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION For every x in the interval.
Definition: A set of functions y1(x), y (x),…., y (x) is said to be linear 2 n independent on an interval I, if it is not linearly dependent on the interval.
In other words, a set of functions is linearly independent on an interval if the only constant for which c y (x) + c y (x) + ….. + c y (x) = 0, 1 1 2 2 n n For every x in the interval, are c = c = ….
= c = 0.
1 2 n It is easy to understand these definitions in the case of two functions y (x) and 1 y (x).
if the functions are linearly dependent on an interval, then there exists 2 constants c and c , both are not zero, such that for every x in the interval 1 2 c y (x) + c y (x) = 0 1 1 2 2 Since c 0, it follows that 1 „ c y (x) = - 2 y (x), 1 c 1 1 That is, if two functions are linearly dependent, then one is a constant multiple of the other.
Conversely, if y (x) = c y (x) for some constant c , then 1 2 2 2 (- 1) y (x) + c y (x) = 0 1 2 2 for every x on some interval.
Hence the functions are linearly dependent, at least one of the constants (namely, c = -1) is not zero.
We thus conclude that two 1 functions are linearly independent when neither is a constant multiple of the other on an interval.
Functions, y (x) = sin2x and y (x) = sinx cosx are linearly dependent on the 1 2 interval ]- , [ since c sin2x + c sinx cosx = 0 is satisfied for every real x ¥ ¥ 1 2 with 1 C = and c = - 1.
1 2 2 In the consideration of linear dependence or linear independence, the interval on which the functions are defined is important.
We now illustrate it through an example.
Example3: Show that the function y (x) = x and y (x) = |x| are 1 2 150MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION i) linearly independent on the interval ] - , [.
¥ ¥ ii) linearly dependent on the interval ]0, [.
¥ Solution: (i) it is clear that in the interval ] - , [ neither function is a constant ¥ ¥ multiple of the other (see Fig.
1) Y Y y = |x | y = x 1 1 o x o x Fig.
1 Thus in order to have c y (x) + c y (x) = 0 for every real x, we must have c = 0 1 1 2 2 1 and c = 0.
2 (ii) For y (x) = x and y (x) = |x| in the interval ]0, [ 1 2 ¥ c x + c |x| = c x + c x = 0 1 2 1 2 is satisfied for any non zero choice of c and c for which c = - c .
1 2 1 2 Thus y (x) ands y (x) are linearly dependent on the interval ]0, [.
1 2 ¥ You may try the following exercises: The procedure given for examining the linear dependence or independence of a set of functions appears to be quite involved.
We, therefore, outline below sufficient condition of examining the linear independence of a set of n functions.
Suppose that y (x), y (x),…., y (x) are n functions on an interval I possessing 1 2 n derivative upto (n – I)th order.
If the determinant.
151MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION y y ⋯ y 1 2 n y' y' ⋯ y' 1 2 n W(y (x), y (x), …., y (x)) = .
.
⋯ .
1 2 n .
.
⋯ .
y(n- 1) y(n- 1) ⋯ y(n- 1) 1 2 n Is not zero for at least one point in the interval I, then the functions y (x), …., y (x) 1 n are linearly independent on the interval.
This provides a sufficient condition for the linear independence of n functions on an interval.
The determinant W(y (x), y (x),…., y (x)) is called the Wronskian of 1 2 n the functions.
It is named after a Polish mathematician Josef Maria Hosene Wornski (1778 – 1853).
The functions y (x) = sin2x and y (x) = 1-cos 2x, for instance are linearly 1 2 dependent on ] , [ because ¥ ¥ sun2x 1- cos2x = 2sin2x sin 2x – 2sin x cos x + 2sin x cos x 2x 2sinx cox 2sin2x = sin 2x [2sin2x – 1 + cos 2x] = sin 2x [2sin2x – 1 + cos2x – sin2x] = sin 2x [sin2x + cos2x – 1] = 0 in example 3 we saw that y (x) = x and y (x) = |x| are linearly independent on ] - 1 2 , [.
However, we cannot compute the Wronskian as y is not differentiable at ¥ ¥ 2 x = 0.
Remember that in the above condition the non-vanishing of the Wronskian at a point in the interval provides only a sufficient condition.
In other words, if W(y y ,…., y ) = 0 for x in an interval, it does necessarily mean that the functions 1 2 n are linearly dependent on the interval.
We leave it for you to verify it yourself.
With above background in mind we are now set to study the elementary properties of the solutions of linear differential equations.
3.2 Elementary Properties of the Solutions The general homogeneous linear differential equation corresponding to Eqn.
(3) is L(y) = [a (x)Dn + a (x)Dn-1 + …+ a (x)] y = 0 0 1 n-1 152MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION i.e., L(y) = (cid:229) n a (x) Dn- r y = 0 …(5) r r=0 We can clearly think of the form of the solutions of linear differential equations by making use of the following elementary theorems: Theorem 2: If y = y is a solution of Eqn.
(5) on an interval 1, then y = cy is also 1 1 its solution on I, where c is any arbitrary constant.
Proof: We know that Dr (cy1) = cDry1 Also, L(cy1) = (cid:229) n a (x) Dn- r (cy ) r 1 r=0 = c (cid:229) n a (x) Dn- s y s 1 s=0 = c L(y ).
1 \ = 0 ( L(y ) = 0) 1 Thus, if y = y is a solution of Eqn (5), so y = cy .
for instance, the function y = x2 1 1 is a solution of the homogeneous linear equation.
X2y" – 3xy' + 4y = 0 on ]0, [.
¥ Hence y = cx2 is also solutions.
For various of c, we see that y = 3x2, y = ex2, y = 0 … are all solutions of the equation on the given interval.
Have you notice that a homogeneous linear differential equation always possesses the trivial solution y = 0?
If not, you can check it now.
Now let us look at another property of the solutions of linear differential equations.
Theorem 3: If y = y , y , …, y are m solutions of homogeneous linear 1 2 m differential Eqn.
(5) on an interval 1, then y = c y + c y + ….
+ c y is also a 1 1 2 2 m m solution of Eqn.
(5) on 1, where c , …., c are arbitrary constants.
1 m Proof: If y (i = I, …, m) are solutions of Eqn.
(5) then 1 L(y = 0 (for i = 1, 2, …., m) …(6) 1 We know that Dr [c y ) + c y + …+ c y ] 1 1 2 2 m m = Dr (c y ) + Dr (c y ) + …+ Dr (c y ) 1 1 2 2 m m = c Dr (y ) + c Dr (y ) + …+ c Dr (y ) 1 1 2 2 m m now, L(c y + c y + …+ c y ) 1 1 2 2 m m 153MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION n = (cid:229) a(x) Dn-r (c y + c y + … + c y ) r 1 1 2 2 m m r= 0 n n n = c (cid:229) a(x) Dn-r y + c (cid:229) a(x) Dn-r y + … + c (cid:229) a(x) Dn-ry 1 r 1 2 r 2 m r m r= 0 r= 0 r= 0 = c L(y ) + c L(y ) + … + c L(y ) (using Eqn.
(5)) 1 1 2 2 m m = c .0 + c .0 +… + c .0 (using Eqn.
(6)) 1 2 m = 0 Hence if y , y ….
y are solutions of Eqn.
(5), then y = c y + c y + … + c y is 1 2 m 1 1 2 2 m m also a solution of Eqn.
(5).
Theorem 3 is known as the superposition principle.
Let us now consider an example.
Example 4: Show that if y = x2 and y = x2 Inx are both solutions of the equation 1 2 x3y" = 2xy' + 4y = 0 on the interval ]0, ¥ [.
Then c x2 + c x2 Inx is also a solution 1 2 of the equation on the given interval.
Solution: We have y = c x2 + c x2 Inx 1 2 Now y' = 2c x + 2c x Inx + c x 1 2 2 y" = 2c + 2c x Inx + 3c 1 2 2 2c y" = 2 x therefore, x3y" – 2xy' + 4y (cid:230) 2c (cid:246) = x3 (cid:231) 2 (cid:247) - 2x (2c x + 2c x Inx + c x) + 4c x2 + 4c x2 Inx Ł x ł 1 2 2 1 2 = 2c x2 – 4c x2 – 4c x2 Inx – 2c x2 + 4c x2 + 4c x2 Inx 2 1 2 2 1 2 = 0 Thus, y = c x2 + c x2 Inx is also a solution of the equation on the interval.
1 2 Theorem 2 and 3 represent properties that non-linear differential equations, in general, do not possess.
This will become more clear to you after you have done the following exercises.
Let us now consider the following definition which involves a linear combination of solutions.
Definition: Let y , y , …, y be n linearly independent solutions of homogeneous 1 2 n linear differential Eqn.
(5) of degree n on an interval I.
Then y = c y (x) + c y (x) + … + c y (x), 1 1 2 2 n n 154MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION where c , i = 1, 2, …, n are arbitrary constants is defined to be the general 1 solution or the complete primitive of Eqn.
(5) on I.
The above definition automatically generates our interest in knowing when n solutions, y y , …, y of the homogeneous differential Eqn.
(5) are linearly 1, 2 n independent.
Surprisingly, the nonvanishing of the Wronskian of a set of n such solutions on an interval I is both necessary and sufficient for linear independence.
That is, If y , y , …, y ) be n solutions of homogeneous linear nth order differential EQn.
1 2 n (5) on an interval I, then the set of solutions is linearly independent on I if and only if „ W(y , y , …, y ) 0 1 2 n For every x in the interval.
Such a set y , …., y of n linearly independent 1 n solutions of Eqn.
(5) on I is said to be a fundamental set of solutions on the interval.
For instance, the second order equation y" – 9y = 0 possesses two solutions y = e3x and y = 3-3x 1 2 e3x e- 3x Since W (33x, e-3x) = = -6 „ 0 3e3x - 3e- 3x ¥ ¥ For every value of x, y and y form a fundamental set of solution on ]- , [.
1 2 The general solution of the differential equation on the interval is y = c e3x + c2 e-3x 1 so far we have discussed the properties pertaining to the solution of homogeneous linear equations.
We now turn our attention to the non-homogeneous linear equation.
To this effect, we consider a theorem due to D’ Alembert (1762 – 1765) which defines the general solution of a non-homogeneous linear equation.
Theorem 4: If y = Y (x) is any solution of the non-homogeneous linear 0 differential Eqn.
(3) on an interval I and if y = Y(x) is te complete primitive of the corresponding homogeneous linear differential Eqn.
(5) on the interval, then Y (x) + Y(x) 0 155MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Is the general solution of Eqn.
(3) on the given interval.
Proof: Since Y (x) is a solution of Eqn.
(3), 0 \ L[Y (x)] = b(x) ...(7) 0 also, Y(x) is the complete primitive of Eqn.
(5), L[Y (x)] = 0 …(8) \ 0 further, in Theorem 2 and 3 above, we have seen that the operator Dr and linear differential operator L are distributive.
Thus, using relations (7) and (8), we get L(y) = L[Y (x) + Y(x)], 0 = L[Y (x)] + L[Y(x)] 0 = B(x) + 0 Thus, y = Y (x) + Y(x) is a solution of Eqn.
(3).
0 Since y(x) = Y (x) + Y(x) involves n arbitrary constants (due to presence of n 0 arbitrary constants in Y(x)), it is, therefore, the general solution of Eqn.
(3).
If Y(x) is chosen as to satisfy the condition (2) and if Y (x), for some point x of 0 0 the interval I, is such that (cid:230) dY (cid:246) (cid:230) d2Y (cid:246) (cid:230) d=- 1Y (cid:246) Y (x ) = 0 = (cid:231) 0 (cid:247) = (cid:231)(cid:231) 0 (cid:247)(cid:247) = … = (cid:231)(cid:231) 0 (cid:247)(cid:247) , 0 0 Ł dx ł Ł dx2 ł Ł dxn- 1 ł x= x0 x= x0 x= x0 Which is possible provided that b(x) is not identically zero, then the solution y = Y (x) + Y(x) …(9) 0 also satisfies the conditions.
(cid:230) dy(cid:246) (cid:230) dn- 1y(cid:246) y(x ) = y , (cid:231) (cid:247) = y' ,…., (cid:231)(cid:231) (cid:247)(cid:247) = y n-1 0 0 Ł dxł 0 Ł dxn- 1 ł 0 x= x0 x= x0 we usually refer the solution of Eqn.
(5) in the form (9) as the general solution of the non-homogeneous linear differential Eqn.
(3) and it consist of two parts: i) The complete primitive of Eqn.
(5) (the corresponding homogeneous part of Eqn.
(3)) in the form Y(x) = c y (x) + c y (x) + ….
+ c y (x).
1 1 2 2 n n 156MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Which contains n arbitrary constants.
The solution y = Y(x) of Eqn.
(5) is known as complementary function of Eqn (3).
We denote the complementary function Y)x) by y (x).
c ii) Any solution y = Y (x) of Eqn.
(3), (which cannot be obtained by assigning 0 any particular value to the arbitrary constants in y (x) is known as c particular integral of Eqn.
(3).
We denote Y (x) by y (x).
0 p Thus, we may write Eqn.
(9) in the form y(x) = y (x) + y (x).
p c You may then ask the natural question – how to find the solution y(x) of Eqn.
(3)?
In the next section we give you the methods of finding the complementary function y (x) of the given linear equation with constant coefficients.
Since the c complementary function refer to the solution of the homogeneous equation corresponding o the given equation, we consider the general nth order homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients.
You may recall that in Sec.
5.2, we had mentioned that if the coefficients of y and its derivatives in Eqn (1) are constants and a „ 0, then Eqn (1) is termed as linear 0 differential equation of nth order with constant coefficients.
Further, we had mentioned that if the right hand side of Eqn.
(1) is zero, then it will be classified as homogeneous linear differential equation for this reason Eqn.
(1) i.e.
the function b(x) is also called non-homogeneous term of Eqn.
(1).
Thus, the general nth order homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients may be expressed as dny dn- 1y dy + a + ….
+ a + a y = 0 …(10) dxn 1 dxn- 1 n-1 dx n where the coefficients a , a , …., a are constants.
1 2 n we would like to mention here that in writing Eqn.
(10) we have taken the dny coefficient of as unity.
Even if it is not so, dividing throughout by the dxn dny coefficient of (which is also assumed to be constant), the equation can be dxn reduced to the form (10).
Let us now discuss the methods of solving EQn.
(10).
157MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 3.3 Method of Solving Homogeneous Equation with Constant Coefficients The method of solving Eqn.
(10) was given in the year 1739 by Leonhard Euler (1707 – 1783) who was born in Basel, Switzerland and was one of the most distinguished mathematicians of the eighteenth century.
The method is as follows: Assume that y = emx is a solution of Eqn.
(10).
On replacing y and its derivatives upto order n by emx and mn emx in Eqn.
(10), we get (mn + a mn-1 + … + a m + a ) emx = 0 …(11) 1 n-1 n since emx „ 0 for real values of x, Eqn.
(11) is satisfied if mn + a mn-1 + … + a m + a = 0 …(12) 1 n-1 n Eqn.
(12) is called an auxiliary equation or characteristic equation corresponding to differential Eqn (10).
You might have observed that an auxiliary equation of a homogeneous or non- homogeneous linear differential operator on replacing D by some finite constant m and equating it to zero.
You may wonder why we assumed the solution of Eqn.
(10) in the exponential dy form.
This is because we know that the linear first order equation + ay = 0. dx Where a is a constant, has the exponential solution y = c e-ax on ] -¥ , ¥ [.
1 ¥ ¥ Therefore, it is natural to determine whether exponential solution exist on ] - , [.
For higher order equations of the form (10).
In the discussion to follow, you will be surprised to see that all solutions of Eqn.
(10) are exponential functions or constructed out of exponential functions.
Let us now consider the following examples: Example 5: Write auxiliary equation corresponding to the differential equation (D6 + 12D4 + 482 + 64) y = 0 Solution: Replacing D by m in the linear differential operator of the given equation, the auxiliary equation becomes m6 + 12m4 +48m2 + 64 = 0 Example 6: Write the characteristic equation corresponding to the differential equation (D2 + 2aD + b2) y = c sinwx.
158MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: On replacing D by m in the homogeneous part of the given equation and equating it to zero, we arrive at the following characteristic equation m1 + 2am + b2 = 0 remember that while writing the auxiliary equation for non-homogeneous differential equation, he non-homogeneous part is neglected.
Auxiliary Eqn.
(12) is a polynomial in m of degree n and, it can have at the most n roots.
Let m , m , …, m be the n roots.
Then the following three possibilities arises; 1 2 n I) Roots of auxiliary equation may be all real and distinct, II) Roots of auxiliary equation may be all real, but some of the roots may be repeated.
III) Auxiliary equation may have complex roots.
We now proceed to find the solution of Eqn.
(10) for these three cases one by one.
Case 1: Auxiliary equation has real and distinct roots: Let the roots m , m , …, m of auxiliary Eqn.
(12) be real and distinct.
1 2 n Now suppose m = m1.
Since m1 is a root of auxiliary Eqn.
912), clearly em1xis an ¥ ¥ integral of Eqn.
(10) and satisfies it on the interval ]- , [.
Similarly, for m = m2, em2xis a solution of Eqn.
(10) and em1x and em2x are also linearly independent on the interval since em1x em2x W(em1x,em2x) = m em1x m em2x 1 2 = (m2 – m1) e(m1+ m2)x „ 0 for m1 „ m2.
Now, the n roots of Eqn (12), namely m , m , …, m are real and distinct solutions, 1 2 n em1x , em2x , …, emnx are all distinct and linearly independent solutions of Eqn.
910).
Sin Eqn.
(10) is of nth ordr and we have n distinct and linearly independent solutions, therefore, we can express the complete solution of Eqn (10) as y = c1 em1x + c2 em2x + … + cn emnx , …(13) where c , c , …, c are arbitrary constants.
1 2 n We now illustrate this case with the help of a few examples.
d2y dy Example 7: Solve 2 + 5 - 12y = 0 dx2 dx 159MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The given equation can be written as (2D2 + 5D – 12) y = 0 the auxiliary equation is 2m2 + 5m – 12 = 0 (cid:222) (2m – 3) (m + 4) = 0 m = 3/2, - 4 (cid:222) here the roots are real and distinct.
Hence complete solution of the given differential equation is y = c e(3/2)x + c e-4x, 1 2 where c and c are arbitrary constants.
1 2 Let us look at another example.
Example 8: If d2y - a2y = 0, show that y = Acosh ax + Bsinh ax is the complete dx2 solution.
Solution: The auxiliary equation corresponding to the given differential equation is m2 – a2 = 0 (m – a) (m + a) = 0 (cid:222) m = a, - a.
(cid:222) roots being real and distinct, the general solution of the given equation is y = c eax + c e-ax 1 2 From the definition of hyperbolic functions, we know that 1 Cosh ax = (eax + e-ax …(14) 2 1 and sinh ax = (eax – e-ax) …(15) 2 adding relations (14) and (15), we get eax = cosh ax + sinh ax Substrating relation (15) from (14), we get e-ax = coshax – sinhax the general solution of given differential equation can thus be written as y = c (cosh ax + sinh ax) c (cosh ax – sinh ax) 1 2 y = (c + c ) cosh ax +(c – c ) sinh ax (cid:222) 1 2 1 2 A cosh ax + B sinh ax, (cid:222) where A = c + c and B = c – c are two arbitrary constants.
1 2 1 2 160MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION We now consider an initial value problem.
Example 9: Solve the equation d2x - 4x = 0 dx2 dx with the conditions that when t = 0, x = 0 and = 3. dt Solution: The auxiliary equation corresponding to the given equation is m2 – 4 = 0 (cid:222) (m – 2) (m + 2) = 0 (cid:222) m = 2, -2 hence the general solution of the differential equation is x = c e-2t.
1 we now apply the given conditions at t = 0.we have dx = 2c e-2t dt 1 Condition that x = 0 when t = 0 gives 0 = c + c , 1 2 dx and the condition that = 3 when t = 0 gives dt 3 = 2c – 2c 1 2 From the two equations for c and c , we conclude tht 1 2 3 3 C = and c = - .
Therefore, 1 4 2 4 3 X = (e2t – e-2t) 4 Which can also be put in the form x = sinh 2t.
Now you may try the following exercises.
We now take up the case when the roots of auxiliary equation are all real but some of them are repeated.
161MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Case II: Auxiliary Equation has real and repeat roots: Let two roots of auxiliary Eqn.
(12) be equal, say m = m .
then solution (13) of `1 2 Eqn.
(10) becomes y = (c1 + c2) em1x + c3 3m3x + … + cn emnx Since (c + c ) can be replaced by a single constant, this solution will have (n -1) 1 2 arbitrary constants.
We know that the general or complete solution of an nth order linear differential equation must contain n arbitary constants; hence the above solution having (n -1 ) arbitrary constants is not the general solution.
To obtain general solution in this case let us reqrite Eqn.
(10) in the form L (y) = (Dn + a D.. + a D + a 0 y = 0 …(16) 1 1 n-1 n d dn Where D = and Dn = and L is a linear differential operator.
1 dx dxn If m , m , …, m are the roots of auxiliary equation corresponding to, Eqn.
(16), 1 2 n then Eqn.
(16) can be written as D – m ) (D – m ) … (D – m ) y = 0 (17) 1 2 n It is clear that when all the n roots m , m , …, m are real and distinct the 1 2 n complete solution of Eqns.
(16) or (17) is constituted by the solutions of the n equations.
(D – m ) y = 0, (D – m ) y =0 ….
(D – m ) y = 0 1 2 n in case the two roots are equal say m = m , then Eqn.
(17) takes the form 1 2 (D =- m )2 (D – m ) … (D - m ) y = 0 1 3 n and then solutions corresponding to two equatl roots are the solutions of (D – m )2 y = 0 1 (cid:222) (D – m1) [(D – m1) y] = 0 …(18) Let (D – m ) y = v …(19) 1 Then Eqn.
(18) reduces to (D – m ) V = 0 1 dV (cid:222) - m1V = 0 dx it is a linear differential equation of the first order and its solution (ref.
Sec.
3.3 of unit 3) is V = c1 em1x 162MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION With this value of V, Eqn.
(19) becomes (D – m1) y = c1 em1x which is again a linear differential equation of the first order and is solution is y = em1x (c + c1x), c , c being constants.
1 2 Similarly, the solution of Eqn.
(17) corresponding to three equal roots say m = m 1 2 = m , are the solutions of 3 (D – m )3y = 0 1 (cid:222) (D – m1) [(D = m1)2y] = 0 te (D – m )2 y = z in the above equation.
solving the equation for z and putting the 1 value of z obtained in the above equation, we have (D – m1)2y = c1 em1x Substituting gain (D – m ) y = t and proceeding as before, we get 1 (D – m1) y = em1x (c2 + c1x) The solution of above linear differential equation of first order is (cid:230) c (cid:246) y = em1x (cid:231) 1 x2 + c x+ c(cid:247) Ł 2 2 3ł thus, it is clear that if a root m of Eqn.
(16) is repeated r times, then solution 1 corresponding to this root will be of the form y = em1x (A1 + A2x + A3x2 + … + Arxr-1) and the general solution of Eqn.
(16) will then be y = em1x(A + A x + A x2 + … + Axr-1) + A emr+1x + … + A emnx …(20) 1 2 3 r r+1 n We now illustrate the above discussion with the help of a few examples.
d4y d3y d2y dy Example 10: Solve - - 9 - 11 - 4 y = 0 dx4 dx3 dx2 dx Solution: The given differential equation can be written as (D4 – m3 – 9D2 – 11D – 4) y = 0 Auxiliary equation of the given equation is M4 – m3 – 9m2 – 11m – 4 = 0 (cid:222) (m + 1)3 (m – 4) = 0 (cid:222) m = - 1, - 1, - 1, 4 163MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION here the root – 1 is repeatred three times and root 4 is distinct.
Hence, using Eqn.
(20), the general solution of the given differential equation is y = (A + Bx + Cx2) e-x + De4x, where A, B, C and D are arbitrary constants.
Let us consider another example.
Example 11: Find the complete solution of (D4 – 8D2 + 16) y = 0 Solution: In this case the auxiliary equation is m4 – 8m2 + 16 = 0 (cid:222) (m2 – 4)2 = 0 (cid:222) (m- 2)2 (m + 2)2 = 0 (cid:222) m = 2,2, - 2, - 2 here 2 and -2 are both repeated.
Therefore, the method of repeated real roots will be separately applied to each repeated root.
Hence the complete solution of the given differential equation is y = (A + Bx) e2x + (C + Dx) e-2x.
and now some exercises for you.
Now we shall discuss the case when the auxiliary equation may have complex roots.
Case III: Auxiliary Equation has complex roots: If the roots of auxiliary Eqn.
(12) are not all real, then some or, may be, all the roots are complex.
We know from the theory of equations that if all the coefficients of a polynomial equation are real, then its complex roots occur in conjugate pairs.
In Eqn.
(12), all the coefficients are assumed to be real constants and hence complex roots, if any, must occur in conjugate pairs.
a b Let one such pair of complex roots of Eqn 912) be m1 = - i , where a and b are real and i2 = - 1.
Formally, there is no difference between this case and case I, and hence the corresponding terms of solution are y = c e(a + ib )x + c e(a - bi )x 1 2 = ea x [c [eib x + c2e- bi x] …(21) 1 164MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION however, in practice we would prefer to work with real functions instead pf complex exponentials.
To achieve this, we make use of the Euler’s formula, namely, eiq = cosq i sinq and e- iq = cos q - i sin q , where q is any real number.
Using these results, the expression (21), which is the part pf the solution corresponding to complex roots, becomes ea x [c (cos b x + i sin b x) + c (cos b x – i sin b x)] 1 2 = ea x [(c + c ) cos b x + (c – c ) i sin b x] 1 2 1 2 Since c + c are arbitrary constants, we may write 1 2 A = c + c2 and B = i(c – c ), 1 1 2 So that A and B are again arbitrary constants, though not real.
Expression (21) now takes the form ea x [Acos b x + Bsin b x] …(22) Further, if the complex root is repeated, then the complex conjugate root will also be repeated and the corresponding terms in the solution can be written, using the form (20), as ex(a + ib ) (c + c x) + ex(a - bi ) (c + c x) 1 2 3 4 Proceeding as above and writing A = c + c B = i(c – c ) C = c + c D = i(c – c ), 1 3 1 3 2 4 2 4 The above expression can be written as ea x [(A + Cx) cos b x + (B + Dx) sin b x] …(23) in the case of multiple repetition of complex roots, the results are obtained analogous to those in the case of multiple repetition of real roots.
We now illustrate this case of complex roots with the help of a dew examples.
Example 12: For the differential equation d4y - m4y = 0, show that its solution can be expressed in the form dx4 y = c cos mx + c sin mx + c cosh mx + c sinh mx.
1 2 3 4 165MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: The given differential equation can be expressed as (D4 – m4) y = 0 In this case since m is used as a constant in the given differential equation, we can l replace D by some other letter, say.
So, the auxiliary equation is ( l 4 – m4) = 0 (cid:222) ( l 2 – m2) ( l 2 + m2) = 0 (cid:222) l = m, - m, – im Now the solution corresponding to roots + m and – m can be obtained as we have done in Example 8 and write it as C cosh mx + c sinh mx 3 4 Solution corresponding to imaginary roots + im and –im will be Aeimx + Be-imx Which can be written as A(cos mx + i sin mx + B(cos mx – i sin mx) = (A + B) cos mx + i (A – B) sin mx = c cosmx + c sinmx 1 2 where c = (A + B) and c = i(A – B) are constants.
1 2 Hence the general solution of the given differential equation is Y = c cos mx + c sin mx + c cosh mx + c sinh mx 1 2 3 4 Let us look at another example.

(1).
In Sec.
S.3 we discussed the methods of determining complementary function of linear differential equations with constant coefficients having auxiliary equations with different types of roots.
But how do we find a particular solution of these equations?
We shall now be considering this problem in this unit.
Variety of methods exist for finding particular integral of a non-homogeneous linear differential equations.
The simplest of these methods is the method of undetermined coefficients.
Basically, this method consists in making a guess as to the form of trial solution and then determine the coefficients involved in the trial 171MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION solution so that it actually satisfies the given equation.
You may recall that we had touched upon this method in Sec.
3.3 of Unit 3 for finding the particular integral of non-homogeneous linear differential equations of the first order having constant coefficients.
In this unit we shall be discussing this method in general for finding the particular integral of second and higher order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to • identify the types of non-homogeneous terms for which method of undetermined coefficients can be successfully applied.
• write the form of trial solutions when non-homogeneous terms are polynomials, exponential functions or their combinations.
• describe the constraints of this method.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Types of Non-Homogeneous Terms for Which the Method is Applicable The method of undetermined coefficients, as we have already mentioned in Sec.
6.1, is a procedure for finding particular integral y^ in a general solution y(x) = yc(x) °f equations of the form (1).
The success of this method is based on our ability to guess the probable form of particular solutions.
We know that the result of differentiating functions such as xr (r > 0, an integer) an exponential function ea x(a constant) or sinmx or cosmx (m constant) is again a polynomial, an exponential or a linear combination of sine or cosine functions respectively.
Hence, if the non-homogeneous term b(x) in Eqn.
(1) is a polynomial an exponential function, or a sine or cosine function then we can choose the particular integral to be a suitable combination of polynomial, an exponential.
I sinusoidal function with a number of undetermined constants.
These constant!
I then be determined so that the trial solution satisfies the given equation.
Note: A function which is a combination of a sine function (or cosine function) with an exponential function and/or a polynomial is a sinusoidal function.
Thus the types of non-homogeneous term for which the method of undetermined coefficients is successfully applicable are 172MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION i) polynomials ii) exponential functions iii) sine or cosine functions iv) a combination of the terms of types (i), (ii) and (iii) above.
We shall now discuss the method of undetermined coefficients to find the particular integral for these various types of non-homogeneous terms one by one.
3.1.2 Non-homogeneous term is an Exponential Function: Let us suppose that the non-homogeneous term b(x) in Eqn.
(1) is an exponential function of the form ea x(a a constant).
In other words, suppose we have to solve an equation.
dny dn- 1y dy L(y) = a + a + … + a + a y = ea x …(6) 0 dxn 1 dxn- 1 n-1 dx n The appropriate form of the trial solution can be taken as y (x) = Aea x …(7) p provided ea xis not a solution of the homogeneous differential equation a corresponding to Eqn.
(1) (i.e., is not a root of the auxiliary equation).
a If is a root of Eqn.
(6), then the choice (7) would not give us any information for determining the value of A. in that case, we can take y (x) = Axea xas the trial p a solution.
If is r-times repeated root of the auxiliary equation, then the suitable form of the trial solution for determining particular integral will be y (x) = Axrea x …(8) p substituting this value of y in Eqn.
(6) and equating coefficients of ea xon both p sides, we can find the value of undermined coefficient A and thus find the particular integral (8).
For a better understanding of whatever we have discussed above let us take up a few examples.
Example 3: Find the general solution of the differential equation d2y dy + 3 + 2y = 3ex.
dx2 dx 173MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION solution: Auxiliary equation is (m + 1) (m + 2) = 0 (cid:222) m = -1, -2, \ C.F.
= c e-x + c e-2x 1 2 Since ex is not a part of the complementary function, hence trial solution for finding a particular integral can be taken as y (x) = Aex p Substituting this value of y in the given differential equation, p we get 2Aex + 3Aex + Aex = 3ex (cid:222) 6Aex = 3ex Equating coefficient of ex on both sides, we get 1 6A = 3, (cid:222) A = 2 hence 1 P. I = ex 2 \ The general solution fo the given differential equation is y = c e-x + c e-2x + ---- ex 1 2 let us consider another example which illustrate the case of repeated roots of an auxiliary equation.
d3y d2y dy Example 4: solve - 3 + 3 - y = 12ex dx3 dx2 dx Solution: Auxiliary equation is (m – 1)3 = 0 (cid:222) m = 1, 1, 1.
\ C.F.
= (c + c x + c x2) ex 1 2 3 since non-homogeneous term of the given differential equation is ex which is present in the complementary function and moreover I is 3-times repeated root of the auxiliary equation, we take the form of trial solution to be y (x) = Ax3ex.
p Note that in the selection of the trial solution y (x) no smaller power of x will give p us the particular integral.
Moreover, it is not similar to any term of complementary function of the given equation.
On substituting this value pf y in the given differential equation, we get p - Ax33x + 3A [x3ex + 3x2ex] – 3A [x3ex + 6x2ex 6xex] + A [x3ex + 9x2ex + 18xex + 6ex] = 12ex 174MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Equating coefficients of ex on both sides, we get 6A = 12, (cid:222) a = 2.
Thus, P.I.
= 2x3ex \ The general solution of the given differential equation is y = (c + c x + c x2) ex + 2x3ex 1 2 3 And now an exercise for you.
You may also come across the situation when b(x) in Eqn.
(1) is a sum of two or more functions.
Suppose b(x) = b (x) + b (x); then from the superposition 1 2 principle we have the P.I.
y (x) of L(y) = b(x) to the equal to y = y + y , p p p1 p2 where y is a P.I.
of L(y) = b (x) and y is a P.I.
of L(y) = b (x).
This enables us p1 1 p2 2 to decompose the problem of solving linear equation L(y) = b(x) into simpler problem an example.
Example 5: find a general solution of d2y dy - 2 - + y = ex + 4. dx2 dx Solution: Auxiliary equation is M2 – 2m + 1 = 0 (cid:222) (m – 1)2 = 0 (cid:222) m = 1, 1.
\ C.F.
= (c + xc ) ex 1 2 To find the particular solution we first consider equation + y = ex …(9) 1 is a repeated root of the auxiliary equation, we consider the trial solution y = Ax2ex p1 on substituting y in Eqn.
(9), we find that p1 (2Aex + 4xAex + x2Aex) – 2(2xAex + x2Aex) + Ax2ex = ex comparing the coefficient of ex on both sides, we have 2Aex = ex 1 (cid:222) A = 2 x2 \ y ex p1 2 Now consider the equation 175MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION d2y dy - 2 y = 4 ...(10) dx2 dx Since no-homogeneous term is a constant, we try y = A and find that A = 4 p2 satisfies (10).
Hence a particular solution of the given equation is x2 y = y + y = ex = 4 p p1 p2 2 A general solution will them be x2 y = c ex + c xex + 4 + ex 1 2 2 The term b(x) can be a combination of many more terms like this.
We may have b(x) = x + ex, b(x) = x + x3, b(x) = 3 + x2 etc.
In these cases, we can obtain particular integral using I and II discussed above and by finding y and y as we p1 p2 have done in Example 5.
We shall give you the general method of finding P.I.
when we discuss cases IV and V. You may try these exercises.
We can now take up the case when b(x) in Eqn.
(1) is either a sine or a cosine function.
3.1.3 Non-homogeneous Term is a Sine or a Cosine Function After going through I and II above and attempting the exercises given so far, you know how to handle b(x) when it is polynomial, an exponential function or a combination of both.
Now can you say how this case is handled when b(x) is a sine or a cosine function?
b b We know that the linear differential operator when applied to sin x or cos x will b b yield a linear combination of sin x and cos x .
Therefore, if the non- homogeneous term b(x) of differential Eqn.
(1) is of the form a b a b a b a b B(x) = sin x or cos x or sin x + cos x 1 2 1 2 We can take the trial solution in the form b b y (x) = Acos x + Bsin x …(11) p 176MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION provide – bi are not roots of the auxiliary equation corresponding to the given differential equation.
If – bi are r-times repeated roots of the auxiliary equation, then we can take the form of trial solution to be b b y (x) = xr(Acos x + Bsin x ) …(12) p We then substitute the value of y (x) in the form (11) or (12), whichever is p b b applicable in Eqn.
(1) and equate the coefficients of sin x and cos x on both sides of the resulting equation.
This gives us equations for obtaining the values of A and B in terms of known quantities.
Knowing the values of A and B, particular integral of Eqn.
(1) is obtained from relations (11) or (12).
We now illustrate this theory with the help of a few examples.
Example 6: Find the general solution of d4y d2y - 2 + y = sinx dx4 dx2 Solution: Auxiliary Equation is (m4 – 2m2 + 1) = 0 (cid:222) (m2 – 1)2 = 0 (cid:222) m = 1, 1, - 1, -1 \ C.F.
= (c + c x) ex + (c + c x) e-x 1 2 3 4 Since ------ i is not a root of the auxiliary equation, that is, term sinx does not appear in the complementary function, we can take the trial solution in the form y (x) = Asinx + Bcosx.
p Substituting this value of y in the given differential equation, we get p (Asinx + Bcosx) – 2(-Asinx – Bcosx) + (Asinx + Bcosx) = sinx (cid:222) 4Asinx + 4Bcosx = sinx Equating coefficients of sinx and cosx on both sides, we get 1 4A = 1 (cid:222) A = 4 and 4B = 0 (cid:222) B = 0 1 Thus, y (x) = sinx p 4 and the complete solution of the differential equation is 177MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 y =(c + c x) ex + (c + c x) e-x + sinx.
1 2 3 4 4 Let us look at another example.
Example 7: Solve the initial value problem d2y + y = 2cosx, y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0 dx2 Solution: The auxiliary equation is m2 + 1 = 0 (cid:222) m = – i (cid:222) C.F.
= c cosx + c sinx 1 2 – Now since i is a root of the auxiliary equation i.e., cosx itself appears in the complementary function, we take the form of the trial solution as y (x) = x (Asinx + Bcosx) p Substituting the value of y (x) in the equation, we get p 2(Acosx – Bsinx) + x( - Asinx – Bcosx) + x(Asinx + Bcosx) = 2cosx (cid:222) 2Acosx – 2Bsinx = 2cosx Comparing the coefficients of sinx and cosx on both sides, we get 2A = 2 (cid:222) A = 1 and B = 0.
Therefore, y (x) = xsinx p and the general solution is y(x) = c cosx + c sinx + xsinx 1 2 we now use initial conditions to determine c and c 1 2 Now y(0) = 1 gives c = 1 1 And y'(0) = 0 gives c = 0 2 Thus, y(0) = cosx + xsinx You may now try the following exercises.
In the example considered so far, did you notice that the function b(x) itself suggested the form of the particular solution y (x)?
in fact, we can expand the list p of functions b(x) for which the method of undetermined coefficients can be applied to include products of these functions as well.
We now discuss such cases.
3.1.4 Non-homogeneous Term is a Product of an Exponential and a Polynomial 178MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Let us suppose that b(x) is of the form b(x) = ea x[b xk + b xk-1 + ….
+ b x + b ] = ea xP (x) 0 1 k-1 k k with this form of b(x), Eqn.
(1) reduces to dny dn- 1y dy a + a +….
+ a + a = ea x [b xk + b xk-1 + 0 dxn 1 dxn- 1 n-1 dx n 0 1 … + b x + b ] …(13) k-1 k We now take the trial solution in the form y (x) = ea x [A xk + A xk-1 +….+ A x + A ] …(14) p 0 1 k-1 k a a provide is not a root of the auxiliary equation corresponding to Eqn.
(13).
If is a root of the auxiliary equation, say, it is r-times repeated root of the auxiliary equation then we modify the trial solution as y (x) = xrea x [A xk + A xk-1 +…+ A x + A ] …(15) p 0 1 k-1 k Remember that in Eqn.
(15) no smaller power of x will yield a particular integral.
Here r is the smallest positive integer for which every term in the trial solution (15) will differ from every term occurring in the complementary function corresponding to Equ (13).
In order to determine the constants A , A ,…., A we substitute y (x) in the form 0 1 k p (14) or (15) as the case may be in eqn.
(13) and then compare the coefficients of ea xon both sides.
For a better understanding of whatever we have discussed above, let us consider an example.
d3y dy Example 8: Solve - = xe-x dx3 dx Solution: Auxiliary equation is m3 – m = 0 (cid:222) m(m2 –1) = 0 (cid:222) m = 0, - 1, 1 \ C.F.
= c + c e-x + c ex 1 2 3 Here the non-homogeneous term is xe-x appears in the complementary function.
Further, ( -1) is a non-repeated root of the auxiliary equation.
Thus, we take the form of trial solution as y (x) = x [B + Ax] e-x = Ax2e-x = Ax2e-x + Bxe-x p substituting this value of y in the given differential equation, we get p - A [-x2ex + 2xe-x] + A [-x2e-x + 6xe-x – 6e-x] – B (-xe-x + e-x) + B(-xe-x + 3e-x) = xe-x Comparing the coefficients of xe-x and e-x on both sides, we get 179MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION 1 4A = 1 (cid:222) A = 4 3 and –6A + 2B = 0 (cid:222) B = 4 1 3 e- x Hence y (x) = x2e-x + xe-x = (x2 + ex) p 4 4 4 And the general solution is e- x y = c + c e-x + (x2 + 3x).
1 2 4 You may now try the following exercise.
Lastly, we take up the case when b(x) is a product of a polynomial, an exponential function and a sinusoidal function.
3.1.5 Non-homogeneous Term is a Product of a Polynomial, an Exponential and a Sinusoidal function Let us suppose that the non-homogeneous term b9x) in Eqn.
(1) has one of the following two forms: b(x) = ea xP (x) sinb x or b(x) ea x P (x) cosb x, …(16) k k a b where P (x), as given by Eqn.
(2), is apolynomial of degree k or less and and k are any real numbers.
You may recall Euler’s formula and write e(a + ib )x = ea x cosb x + iea x sinb x or, equivalently, we have ea x cosb x = Real (e(a + ib )x) e(a + ib )x + e(a - b i )x = 2 and ea x sinb x = Imaginary (e(a + ib )x) e(a + ib )x - e(a - b i )x = 2i Hence b(x) in Eqn.
(16) reduces to (cid:236) e(a + ib )x - e(a - b i )x(cid:252) b(x) = (b xk + b xk-i +….+ b ) (cid:237) (cid:253) 0 1 k (cid:238) 2i (cid:254) 180MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (cid:236) e(a + ib )x + e(a - b i )x(cid:252) or b(x) = (b xk + b xk-1 + … + b ) (cid:237) (cid:253) 0 1 k (cid:238) 2 (cid:254) In either of the above two cases, we take the trial solution in the form y (x) = (A xk + A xk-1 + …+ A ) (e(a + ib )x) p 0 1 k (B xk + B xk-1 + …+ B ) (e(a - bi )x) 0 1 k or, equivalently, y (x) = (A xk + A xk-1+ …+ A ) ea x cosb x + p 0 1 k (B xk + B xk-1 + …+ B ) ea x sinb x, 0 1 k provided a – b i is not a root of the auxiliary equation.
If (a – b i ) is r-times repeated root of the auxiliary equation, we can then modify the trial solution by multiplying it by xr.
We then substitute the trial solution in Eqn.
(1) and equate the coefficients of like terms on both sides to determine A , 0 A , …., A and B , B , …., B .
Substituting these values of undetermined 1 k 0 1 k coefficients in the trial solution, we get the particular integral.
Let us now illustrate the above case with the help of a few examples.
Example 9: find the appropriate form of trial solution for the differential equation d4y d3y d2y + 2 + 2 = 3ex + 2xe-x + e-x sinx dx4 dx3 dx2 Solution: Auxiliary equation is m4 + 2m3 + 2m2 = 0 (cid:222) m2(m2 + 2m + 2) = 0 (cid:222) m = 0, 0, - 1 – i \ C.F.
= c + c x + e-x (c sinx + c cosx) 1 2 3 4 Here the non-homogeneous term is 3ex + 2xe-x + e-x sinx Since the term e-x sinx also appear in C.F., the appropriate form of the trial solution is y = Aex + (Bx + C) e-x + xe-x (Dcosx + Esinx).
p We now take up an example in which b(x) is a product of a polynomial an exponential and a sinusoidal function.
Example 10: Write down the form of the trial solution for the equation 181MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION d2y dy + 2 5y = x2e-x sinx dx2 dx Solution: the auxiliary equation is m2 + 2m + 5 = 0 (cid:222) m = - 1 – 2i – The roots are not equal to –1 i.
Hence the for of trial solution is y = (A x2 + A x + A ) e-xcosx + (B x2 + B x + B ) e-xsinx p 0 1 2 0 1 2 Note that the form of trial solution taken in Case v above is the most general form.
This is because the trial solutions taken in Cases I –IV are particular forms of Case V. And now some exercise for you.
After going through the Cases I – V above and attempting the exercises given, you must have understood the method of undetermined coefficient quite well.
Did you make certain observations about the method?
Let us now summarize the observations and constraints of this method.
3.2 Observations and Constraints of the Method 1) Method is straight forward in application.
2) It can be used by any learner who is not familiar with more elegant techniques of finding the solutions f the differential equations such as inverse operators and variation of parameters, which involve integrations and which we shall be discussing in the subsequent units.
3) Success of this method depends to a certain extent on the ability to guess an appropriate form of the trial solution.
4) If the non-homogeneous term is complicated and the trial solution involves a large number of terms, then determination of coefficients in the trial solution becomes laborious.
5) This method is not a general method of finding the particular solution of differential equations.
It is applicable to linear non-homogeneous equations with constant coefficients and with restricted forms of the no- homogeneous terms.

In this unit we familiarize you with an alternative approach fir determining a particular solution that can be applied even when the coefficients of the differential Equation are functions of the independent variable and the non- homogeneous term may not be of a particular form.
Such an approach is due to Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 – 1813) and is termed as variation of parameters.
Even though the approach is quite general bit is limited in its scope in the sense that it can be utilized in situations where the fundamental solution set for the reduced equation is known.
Also, it can be used for first and higher order equations alike though its appreciation can be well understood for the later set of equations.
The method requires for its applicability the complete knowledge of fundamental solution set of the reduced equation and for equations with variable coefficients the determination of this set may be extremely difficult.
In the case of linear differential equations with variable coefficients, at times, it may not be possible to find all linearly independent solutions of the reduced but at least one or more may be obtainable.
For such situations Jean le Rond d’Alembert (1717 – 1783), a French mathematician and a physicist, developed a method that is often called the method of reduction of order.
When one or more solutions of reduced equation are known that D’Alembert’s method can be used to derive an equation of order lower than that of a given equation and obtain the rest of the solutions of a reduced equation as well as the particular integral of the non-homogeneous term.
We shall be discussing the method of reduction of order in Sec.
7.3 of the unit.
For some particular forms of the second order linear differential equations with variable coefficients, we have also listed some rule by which one integral of the homogeneous equation an be guessed.
186MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION However, there exist linear differential equation with variable coefficients if second and higher order for which we may not be able to guess any integral of its complementary function.
But, among such equations is a class of equations known as Euler’s equation or homogeneous linear differential equations, where, by certain substitution, it is possible to find all the integrals of its complementary function.
In Sec.
7.4, we shall be discussing the method of solving Euler’s equations and those equations which are reducible to Euler’s form.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you should be able to • Use the method of variation of parameters to find particular integral of non- homogeneous linear differential equations with constant or variable coefficients.
• Use the method of reduction of order to find the complete integral of the linear non-homogeneous equation of second order when one integral of the corresponding homogeneous equation is known.
• Write down one integral for second order linear homogeneous differential equation with variable coefficients in certain cases merely through inspection.
• Solve Euler’s equations.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Variation of Parameters Let us not discuss the details of the method by considering the non-homogeneous second order linear equation.
L[y] = y" + a (x) y' +a (x)y = b(x), …(1) 1 2 Where we have taken the coefficients of y" to be 1 and a (x), a (x), and b(x) are 1 2 defined and continuous on some interval J.
Let [y (x), y (x)] be a fundamental 1 2 solution set for the corresponding homogeneous equation L[y] = 0 …(2) Then we know that the general solution of (2) is given by Y (x) = c y (x) + c y (x), …(3) c 1 1 2 2 Where c and c are constants.
To find a particular solution of the non- 1 2 homogeneous equation, the idea associated with the method of variation of 187MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION parameters is to replace the constants in Eqn.
(3) by function of x.
That is, we seek a solution of Eqn.
(1) of the form y (x) = u (x)y (x) + u (x)y (x), …(4) p 1 1 2 2 where u (x) and u (x) are unknown functions to be determined.
Since we have 1 2 introduced two unknowns, we need two equation involving these functions for their determination.
In other words, we impose two conditions which the functions u and u must 1 2 satisy in order that relation (4) is a solution of Eqn.
(1).
We call these conditions the auxiliary conditions.
These conditions are imposed in such a way that the calculations are simplified.
Let us see how this is done.
Now if relation (4) is a solution of Eqn.
(1), then it must satisfy it.
Thus, first we compute y' (x) and y" (x) from Eqn.
(4).
p p y' = (u' y + u' y ) + (u y' +u y' ) …(5) p 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 To simplified the computation and to avoid second order derivatives for the unknown u , u in the expression for y" , let us choose the first auxiliary condition 1 2 p as u' y + u ' y = 0 …(6) 1 1 2 2 Thus relation (5) becomes y ' = u y ' + u y ' p 1 1 2 2 …(7) and y ' = u ' y ' + u ' y" + u ' y ' +u y" p 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 …(8) Substituting in Eqn (1), the expressions for y , y ' and y " as given b Eqn.
(4), p p p (7) and (8), respectively, we get b(x) = L[y ] p = (u ' y ' + u y" + u ' y ' + u y " ) + a (u y' +u y' ) + a ( u y + u y ) 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 = (u1' y1' + u'2y'2) + u1 (y1"+ a1 y1' +a2y1) + u2(y"2+ a1y'2 + a2y2) u' y' + u'y' ) + u L[y ] + u L[y ] …(9) = ( 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 since y and y are the solution of the homogeneous equation, we have 1 2 L[y ] = L[y ] = 0 1 2 Thus Eqn.
(9) becomes + = b(x) u' y' u'y' 1 1 2 2 …(10) 188MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION whicg is the seond auxiliary condition.
Now if we can find u and y satisfying Eqns.
(16) and (10), viz., 1 2 y u' + y u' = 0 ø 1 1 2 2 œ …(11) y'u' + y'u' = b(x)ß 1 1 2 2 then y given by Eqn.
(4) will be a particular solution of Eqn.
(1).
In order to p determined u , u we first solve the linear system of Eqns (11) for u' and u' .
1 2 1 2 Algebraic manipulations yield - b(x)y (x) b(x) y (x) u' (x) = 2 , u' (x) = 1 , …(12) 1 W(y ,y ) 2 W(y ,y ) 1 2 1 2 where y y W(y , y ) = 1 2 = y y' - y y' 1 2 y' y' 1 2 2 1 1 2 is the Wronskian of y (x) and y (x).
1 2 Note that this Wronskian is never zero on J, because {y , y } is a fundamental 1 2 solution set.
On integrating u' (x) and u' given by Eqn.
(12), we obtain 1 2 - b(x) y (x) b(x) y (x) (cid:242) (cid:242) y (x) = 2 dx, u (x) = 1 dx …(13) p W(y ,y ) 2 W(y ,y ) 1 2 1 2 Hence - b(x) y (x) b(x) y (x) (cid:242) (cid:242) y (x) = y (x) 2 dx + y (x) 1 dx ...(14) p 1 W(y ,y ) 2 W(y ,y ) 1 2 1 2 is a particular integral of Eqn.
(1).
We now sum up the various steps involved in determining a particular solution of Eqn.
(1).
Step 1: Find a fundamental solution set {y (x), y (x)} for the corresponding 1 2 homogeneous equation.
Step II: Assume the particular integral of Eqn (1) in the form y (x) = u (x) y (x) + u (x) y (x) p 1 1 2 2 and determine u (x) and u (x) by using the formula (13) directly or by first solving 1 2 the system of Eqns.
(11) for ------- and then integrating.
189MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Setp III: Substitute u (x) and u (x) into the expression for y (x) to obtain a 1 2 p particular solution.
We now illustrate these steps with the help of the following examples.
Example 1: Determine the general solution of the differential equation d2y p + y = secx, 0 < x < dx2 2 Solution: Step I: The auxiliary equation corresponding to the given equation is m2 + 1 = 0 (cid:222) m = – i and the two solutions of the reduced equation are y (x) = cosx 1 and y (x) = sinx.
2 Hence the complementary function is given by Y (x) = c cosx + c sinx.
c 1 2 Step II: To find particular integral, we write y (x) = u (x) cosx + u (x)sinx …(15) p 1 2 dy du du \ p = [-u (x)sinx + u (x)cosx] + 1 cosx + 2 sinx 1 2 dx dx dx Let us take the first auxiliary condition as du du 1 cosx + 2 sinx = 0 …(16) dx dx So that dy p = - u (x)sinx + u (x)cosx 1 2 dx Differentiating the above equation once again, we get dy du du p = - u (x)cosx = u (x)sinx – sin 1 + cosx 2 …(17) 1 2 dx dx dx Since y (x) must satisfy the given equation, we substitute in the given equatin the p expression for y and ----- fom Eqns.
(15) and (17), respectively, and obtain p du du - sinx 1 + xosx 2 = secx …(18) dx dx 190MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION du du On solving Eqns.
(16) and (18) for 1 and 2 , we get dx dx du du 1 = - tanx, 2 = 1, dx dx which on integration yields u (x) = In(cosx) and u (x) = x 1 2 Step III: Substituting the values of u (x) and u (x) in Eqn.
(15) we obtain a 1 2 particular solution of the given equation in the form y (x) = cosx In(cosx) + xsinx p and the general solution is y = c cosx + c sinx + xsinx + cosxIn(cosx) 1 2 Note that in Eqn.
(1) we have taken the coefficients of y" to be 1. if the given equation is of the form a (x)y" + a (x)y' + a (x)y = b(x), then before applying the 0 1 2 method it must be put in the form y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)y = g(x) as we have done in the following example.
Example 2: Find the general solution of d2y 1 dy (1 – x2) - = f(x) …(19) dx2 x dx Solution: Step 1: We first rewrite the given equation in the form 1 f(x) d2y dy - = dx2 x(1- x2) dx (1- x2) The corresponding homogeneous equation is 1 d2y dy - = 0 …(20) dx2 x(1- x2) dx dy dy This is a first order equation in .
To solve this we put = p. Then Eqn.
(20) dx dx reduces to dp 1 - p = 0 dx x(1- x2) 1 dx or dp = …(21) p x(1- x2) Now Eq.
(21) is in variable separable form and can be expressed as dp Ø 1 x ø + = Œ œ dx p º x 1- x2ß Integrating we get 191MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION c x P = 1 1- x2 c x or dy = 1 …(22) dx 1- x2 Integrating Eqn.
(22), once again, we get the solution of Eqn.
(20) in the form Y (x) = - 1- x2 + c …(23) c 2 where c and c are arbitrary constants.
1 2 Step II: For the given differential equation, assume a particular solution in the form yp(x) = u1(x) 1- x2 + u2(x) - x Ø du du ø \ dyp = u + Œ 1- x2 1+ 2œ dx 1- x2 1 º dx dxß We choose the first auxiliary condition as du du 1- x2 1 + 2 = 0 …(24) dx dx Then - x dy p = u dx 1- x2 1 d2y 1 1 du and p = - u - 1 dx2 (1- x2)3/2 1 1- x2 dx Substituting, from above, the expressions for y' and y" in Eqn.
(19), we get p p du - x 1- x2 1 = f(x) …(25) dx as our second auxiliary condition.
Solving Eqns.
924) and (25) for u' and u' and integrating, we get 1 2 (cid:242) f(x) (cid:242) f(x) U (x) = - dx and u (x) = dx 1 x 1- x2 2 x Step III: The expressions for u (x) and u (x) when substituted in y (x) gives a 1 2 p particular integral in the form (cid:242) f(x) (cid:242) f(x) Yp(x) = - 1- x2 x 1- x2 dx + x dx Hence a general integral o fthe given differential equation is 192MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (cid:242) f(x) (cid:242) f(x) Y = - c1 1- x2 + c2 - 1- x2 x 1- x2 dx + x dx You may now try the following exercises.
If you have carefully gone through Example 1 and 2 above, and also attempted 1. and 2., you will find that the results of second order non-homogeneous linear differential equations can be put in the form of the following theorem.
Theorem 1: If the functions a (x), a (x), a (x) and b(x) are continuous on some 0 1 2 interval J and if y and y are the linearly independent solutions of the 1 2 homogeneous equations associated with the differential equation d2y dy A (x) + a (x) + a (x)y = b(x), …(26) 0 dx2 1 dx 2 then a particular solution of Eqn.
(26) is given by y (x) b(x) y (x) b(x) (cid:242) (cid:242) y (x) = -y (x) 2 dx + y (x) 1 dx ...(27) p 1 a (x) W(y ,y ) 2 a (x) W(y ,y ) 0 1 2 0 1 2 where w(y , y ) is the Wronskian of y (x) and y (x).
1 2 1 2 Remark: In using the method of variation of parameters for finding a particular integral of a given equation, it is advisable to choose a particular integral y (x) = p u (x) y (x) + u (x) y (x), and then proceed to find u (x) and u (x) as we have done 1 1 2 2 1 2 in Examples 1 and 2 above.
It is usually avoided to memorise formulas given by Eqns.
(13) or (27).
But since the procedure involved is somewhat long and complicated and moreover, it may not always be easy or even possible to evaluate the integrals involved, these formulas turn out to be useful.
In such cases, the formulas for y (x) provide a starting point for the numerical evaluation of y (x).
p p The method of variation of parameters which we have discussed for non- homogeneous second order equations can be easily generalized to nth order equations of the form dny dn- 1y A (x) + a (x) + …+ a (x)y = b(x) 0 dxn 1 dxn- 1 n where a (x), a (x),……, a (x), b(x) are continuous in some interval J.
The learner 0 1 n interested into the details of the method for a higher order equation may refer to the Appendix at the end of the Unit.
We shall not be giving the details at this stage but, however, illustrate it through an example.
Example 3: Find the general solution of d3y d2y dy - 6 + 11 - 6y = e2x dx3 dx2 dx 193MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: Step I: The auxiliary equation corresponding to the given equation is m3 – 6m2 + 11m – 6 = 0 (cid:222) (m – 1) (m2 – 5m + 6) = 0 (cid:222) (m – 1) (m – 2) (m – 1) = 0 thus the linearly independent solutions are y (x) = ex, y (x) = e2x , y (x) = e3x 1 2 3 , and the complementary function is given by y (x) = c ex + c e2x + c e3x …(28) c 1 2 3 Step II: To find particular integral, we write y (x) = u (x)ex + u (x)e2x + u (x)e3x …(29) p 1 2 3 dy + ( ex + e2x + e3x) + (u ex + 2u e2x + 3u e3x) \ p u' u' u' 1 2 3 dx 1 2 3 Let the first auxiliary condition be u' ex + u' e2x + u' e3x) = 0 …(30) 1 2 3 Thus y' = u ex + 2u e2x + 3u e3x p 1 2 3 and y" = u' ex + 2 u' e2x + 3u' e3x) + (u ex + 4u e2x + 9u e3x) p 1 2 3 1 2 3 Let us choose the second condition as u' ex + 2 u' e2x + 3u' e3x = 0 …(31) 1 2 3 Then y" = u ex + 4u e2x + 9u e3x p 1 2 3 \ y" = (u u' ex + 4 u' e2x + 9 u' e3x) + (u1ex + 8u2e2x + 27u3e3x) p 1 2 3 Substituting the values of y ,y' ,y" and y"' in the given equation, we get p p p p ( u' ex + 4 u' e2x + 9 u' e3x) + (u ex + 8u e2x + 27u e3x) 1 2 3 1 2 3 - 6(u ex + 4u e2x + 9u e3x) + 11(u ex + 2u ex + 2u e2x + 3u e3x) 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 - 6(u ex + u e2x + u e3x) = e2x …(32) 1 2 3 (cid:222) ex + 4 e2x + 9 e3x = e2x, u' u' u' 1 2 3 which is our third auxiliary condition Thus, we get the system of equations 194MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION u'ex + u'e2x + u'e3x = 0 ø 1 2 3 œ u'ex + 2u'e2x + 3u'e3x = 0 œ …(33) 1 2 3 u'ex + 4u'e2x + 9u'e3x = e2xœß 1 2 3 Solving Eqns.
(33) for u' , u' and u' , we get 1 2 3 1 1 u' = ex, u' = - 1 and u' = e-x 1 2 2 3 2 Integrating, we get 1 1 u = ex, u = - x and u = e-x 1 2 3 2 3 Step III: We get a particular integral in the form 1 1 y (x) = e2x – xe2x - e2x = - xe2x, p 2 2 and the general solution is y = c ex + c e2x + c e2x – c e3x – xe2x, 1 2 3 3 You may now try this exercise.
Clearly the method of variation of parameters has an advantage over the method of undermined coefficients in the sense that it always yields a particular solution y p provided all the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation are known.
Moreover, its application is not restricted to particular forms of the non- homogeneous term.
In the next section we will discuss a technique which is very similar to the method of variation of parameter.
3.2 Reduction of Order For a given nth order linear homogeneous differential equation, if one nontrivial solution is known, then the method of reduction of order, as the name suggests, reduces the equation to an (n- 1)th order equation.
Thus, if we can find in some way, one or more linearly independent solutions of the reduced equation, we can accordingly reduce the order of the given differential equation.
In other words, if p independent solutions of a homogeneous linear corresponding to an nth order equation are known, where p < n, then the technique can be used to obtain a linear equation of order (n- p).
This fact is particularly interesting when n = 2, since the resulting first order equation ca always be solved by the methods we have done in Block 1.
That is, if we know one solution of the homogeneous linear differential equation of the second order, we can solve the non-homogeneous equation by the method of reduction of order and obtain both a particular solution and a second 195MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION linearly independent solution of the homogeneous equation.
Let us now see how method works for a second order linear equation.
Consider a second order non-homogeneous equation of the form (1), viz., d2y dy + a (x) + a (x) y = b(x), 1 2 dx2 dx where a (x), a (x) and b(x) are continuous on some interval J.
Suppose that y = 1 2 y (x) is a nontrivial solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation 1 d2y dy + a (x) + a (x)y = 0 …(34) 1 2 dx2 dx Then y = cy (x) is also a solution of Eqn.
(34) for some constant c. We now 1 replace the constant c by an unknown function v(x) and take a second trial solution in the form y = v(x)y (x) 1 Now, y' = v'y + vy' 1 1 y" = v"y + 2v' y' + vy" 1 1 1 substituting from above the expression for y, y' and y" in the given equation, we get (v"y + 2v'y' + vy") + a (v'y + vy' ) + a vy = b(x) 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 (cid:222) v"y + v' (2y' + a y ) + v(y" + a y' + a y ) = b(x) …(35) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 Since y is a solution of Eqn.
934), the last term on the l.h.s.
of Eqn.
(35) is zero.
1 Therefore Eqn.
(35) reduces to v"y + v'(2y' + a y ) = b(x) …(36) 1 1 1 1 dv Let = p(x), so that Eqn.

of Eqn.
(38), 1 y2h(x) 1 is the 2nd linearly independent solution of Eqn.
(34) and the last term on the r.h.s.
is a particular integral of the given non-homogeneous equation.
We now take up an example to illustrate the theory.
Example 4: Find the general solution of x2y" – xy' + y = x1/2, 0 < x < ¥ , Given that y = x is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
1 Solution: The given equation is x2y" – xy' + y = x1/2 …(39) Let us take y = xv(x) as a trial solution for Eqn.
(39).
So that y' = v + xv' v" = 2v' + xv" Substituting for y, y' and y" from above in Eqn.
(39), we obtain x2(2v' + xv") – x(v + xv') + xv = x1/2 (cid:222) x3v" + x2v' = x1/2 (cid:222) v" + ----- v' = x-5/2 …(40) Eqn.
(40) is a linear differential equation in v'.
ts integrating factor is 197MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION I.F.

(40) yields V' x = (cid:242) x.x-5/2 dx + c 1 (cid:222) v' = c x-1 – 2x-3/2 1 Integrating once again, we have v = c Inx + 4x-1/2 + c 1 2 Thus, y = xv = c x Inx + c x + 4x1/2 1 2 is the general solution of Eqn.

And now some exercise for you.
From that above it is seen that if one solution of the second order linear homogeneous Eqn.
(34) is known, then the second linearly independent solution and a particular integral of the associated non-homogeneous equation can be determined.
We now give some rules, which will help you to find one integral included in the complementary function merely by inspection.
For a homogeneous equation of the form (34) if Rule I: 1 + a (x) + a (x) = 0, then y = ex is an integral of the Eqn.
(34).
1 2 For instance, consider an equation xy" – y' + (1 – x) y = x2e-x …(41) To bring it to the form (34), we write it a 1 (cid:230) 1- x(cid:246) y" - y' + (cid:231) (cid:247) y = xe-x x Ł x ł 1 1 Thus, a (x) = - and a (x) = - 1 1 2 x x 1 1 Now 1 + a (x) + a (x) = 1 - + - 1 = 0 1 2 x x Thus, according to Rule 1, y = ex is an integral of the equation.
You can verify your result by substituting y = ex in the given equation and check if it satisfies the given equation.
Rule II: a (x) + xa (x) = 0 then y = x is an integral of the Eqn.
(34) 1 2 Consider the equation, 91 – x2) y" + xy' – y = x((1 – x2)3/2 This equation can be written as 198MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION x 1 y" + y' - y = x 1- x2 1- x2 1- x2 Comparing the above equation with Eqn.
(34), we have x 1 a (x) = and a (x) = - .
1 1- x2 2 1- x2 Here a (x) + xa (x) = 0, hence by the above rule y = x is an integral of the 1 2 homogeneous equation corresponding to the equation.
Rule III: 1 – a (x) + a (x) = 0, then y = e-x is an integral of the Eqn.
(34) 1 2 Rule IV: 2 + 2xa (x) + x2 a (x) = 0, then y = x2 is an integral of the Eqn.
(34).
1 2 a (x) a (x) Rule V: 1 + 1 + 2 = 0, a > 0, then y = ea x is an integral of the Eqn.
(34).
a a 2 Note that in applying Rules I – V the given equation should be first put in the form of Eqn.
(34).
You may now try the following exercise.
So far you have seen that the method of variation of parameters can be used only for those differential equation for which we know all the linearly independent solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
Method of reduction of order is helpful for finding complete solution of the second order non- homogeneous linear equations even if one solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation is known.
There exists certain rules which, at once, give one solution merely through an inspection, included in the complementary function of the second order linear equations with constant coefficients.
But, no rules exist which may help to guess one or more integrals included in the complementary function when the equation is or order higher than two and is having variable coefficients.
However, there exists a class of linear differential equations with variable coefficients known as Euler’s equations for which it is possible to find all the linearly independent integrals of the complementary function.
In the next section we take up the method of solving Euler’s Equations.
3.3 Euler’s Equations Consider the following differential equations d3y d2y x3 + x2 + 4x + 2y = ex …(42) dx3 dx2 199MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION d2y dy x + 2x + 2y = ex …(43) dx2 dx d3y dy (2x – 1)3 + (2x – 1) - 2y = sinx …(44) dx3 dx All the three equations given above are linear as the dependent variable y and its derivative appear in their first degree and moreover there is no term involving the product of the two.
Out of the three equations, only Eqn.
(42) is such that the powers of x in the coefficients are equal to the orders of the derivatives associated with them.
This type of equation known as homogeneous linear differential equation or Euler’s Equation.
Eqn (43) is linear but not homogeneous.
Eqn.
(44) is not of Euler’s from form but can be reduced to Euler’s form by the substitution X = 2x – 1.
Here we shall consider only equations of the form (42) and (44).
The general form of Euler’s equation of nth order is dny dn- 1y dn- 2y dy xn + P xn-1 + P xn-2 + ….+ P + P y = f(x), ...(45) dxn 1 dxn- 1 2 dxn- 2 n-1dx n where P , P , …, P are constants and right hand side is a constant or a function of 1 2 n x alone.
Eqn.
(45) can be transformed to an equation with constant coefficients by changing the independent variable through the transformation z = Inx or x = ez with this substitution, we have dy dy dz 1 dy = .
= dx dz dx x dz dy dy d (cid:222) x = = D y, where D = 1 1 dx dz dz d2y d (cid:230) 1 dy(cid:246) 1 dy 1 d2y dz Also = (cid:231) (cid:247) = - + dx2 dx Ł x dzł x2 dz x dx2 dx 1 (cid:230) d2y dy(cid:246) - = (cid:231) (cid:247) x2 Ł dz2 dzł d2y d2y dy (cid:222) x2 = - = (D2 - D ) y = D (D – 1) y dx2 dz2 dz 1 1 1 1 Proceeding as above, we shall, in general, get dny xn = D (D – 1) (D – 2) ….
(D - n- 1) y 1 1 1 1 dxn 200MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Thus, Eqn (45) is transformed to the equation [D (D – 1) – (D - n- 1) + P D (D – 1) ….
( D n- 2) + … 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 … + P D (D – 1) + P D + P ] y = f(ez) …(46) n-2 1 1 n-1 1 n Eqn.
(46) is an equation with constant coefficients and its complementary function can be determined by the methods given in Unit 5. for obtaining its particular integral either the method of undetermined coefficients (as given in Unit 6 subject to the form of f(ez)), or the method of variation of parameters can be utilized if the solution of Eqn.
(46) is y = g(z), then the solution of Eqn.
(45) will be y = g(Inx) we illustrate this method by the following examples d2y dy Example 5: Solve x2 - x + y = Inx dx2 dx Solution: It is Euler’s equation of order 2.
To solve it, let x = ez or z = Inx dy dy dz 1 dy dy dy d \ = .

is m2 – 2m + 1 0 (cid:222) m = 1, 1 \ C.F.
= (c + cz) ez 1 To find P.I.
of Eqn.
(47), let us assume that y = u (z) ez + u (z) zez …(48) p 1 2 dy \ p = u' ez + u' zez +u ez + u (zez + ez) dz 1 2 1 2 As first auxiliary condition, assume that 201MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION u' ez + u' zez = 0, …(49) 1 2 so that dy p = u ez + u (z + 1) ez …(50) 1 2 dz Differentiating once again, we have dy p = u' ez + u' (z + 1) ez + u ez + u ez (z + 1) + u ez …(51) dz 1 2 1 2 2 If y (z) is a solution of Eqn.
(47), it must satisfy it.
Hence substituting the p expression for y , and --- and --- from Eqn.
(48), (50) and (51), respectively, in p Eqn.
(47), we obtain the second auxiliary condition as u' ez + (z + 1) ez = z …(52) 1 Solving Eqn.
(49) and (52) for-------, we get u' ez = z and ez u' = - z2 2 1 (cid:222) u' = - z2 e-z and --- = ze-z 1 Integrating the above equation, we get u = - (cid:242) z2 e-z dz 1 Ø e- z ø = - Œ z2 + 2(cid:242) z e- zdzœ º - 1 ß Ø e- z ø = + z2 e-z – 2 Œ z2 + (cid:242) e- zdzœ º - 1 ß = z2 e-2 + 2z e-z + 2e-z and u = (cid:242) z e-z dz = - ze-z + (cid:242) e-z dz = - z e-z e-z 2 Substituting the values of u (z) and u (z) in Eqn.
(48), a particular integral of Eqn.
1 2 (47) can be expressed in the form y (z) = (z2 + 2z + 2) e-z.
ez + ( - z – 1) e-z zez p = (z2 + 2z + 2) – z(z + 1) = z2 + 2z + 2 – z2 – z = z + 2 and the general solution of Eqn.
(47) is y = (c + c z) ez + z z + 2 1 2 202MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Replacing z by In x, the general solution f the given equation is y = (c + c Inx).
X + Inx + 2 1 2 The complementary function of Euler’s Eqn.
(45) can also be found by assuming y = xm in the homogeneous part of the equation and then finding the values of m. we illustrate it through the following example.
d3y d2y dy Example 6: Solve x3 - x2 - 6x + 18y = 0 dx3 dx2 dx Solution: Let y = xm dy \ = m xm-1 dx d2y = m (m – 1) (m – 2) xm-3 dx2 Substituting the above values in the given equation, we get [m (m – 1) (m – 2) … m(m – 1) – 6m + 18] xm = 0 (cid:222) (m3 – 4m2 – 3m + 18) xm = 0 thus, if m3 – 4m2 = 3m + 18 = 0, …(53) then y = xm satisfies the given equation.
Equ.
(53) is an algebraic equation of 3rd degree in m and its root are M = - 2, 3, 3.
Thus, y = x-2, y = x3 and y = x3 are the solutions of the given equation.
hence the general solution of the given equation is Y = c x-2 + x3(c + c (Inx)) 1 2 3 Note: Had all the roots of Eqn.
(53) been real and different, the solutions corresponding to these roots would have been independent solutions and the general solution would have been pf the form y = c xm1+ c xm2 + c xm3 1 2 3 In the case of repeadted real roots of Eqn.
(53), if a root m is repeated r times, the 1 integral corresponding to root m is 1 [c + c2Inx + c3 (Inx)2 +…+ cr (Inx)r-1] xm1 1 Further, if Eqn.
(53) had a pair of complex roots, say a – b i , then the corresponding part of the complementary function would have been b b xa [c cos ( Inx) + c sin ( Inx)] 1 2 we illustrate the case of complex roots by the following example.
Example 7: Solve x2y" + xy' + 4y = 0 203MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION Solution: Substituting y = xm in the given equation, we get [m(m – 1) + m + 4] xm = 0 Thus y = xm satisfies the given equation if m(m – 1) + m + 4 = 0 (cid:222) m2 + 4 = 0 (cid:222) m = – 2i Hence, the general solution of the given equation is y = c cos (2Inx) + c sin(2Inx) 1 2 You may now try the following exercises.
Earlier we mentioned that Eqn.
(44) is not Euler’s equation, but can be reduced to Euler’s form by the substitution X = 2x – 1.
We now consider such equations which are reducible to Euler’s form.
Equations Reducible to Euler’s form Consider the general nth order equation dny dn- 1y dy (ax + b)ndxn + (ax +b)n-1P dxn- 1 +…+(ax + b) P dx +P y = f(x), ...(54) 1 n-1 n where a, b, P , …, P are all constants.
1 n Equations of the form (54) can be reduced to Euler’s equations by substituting X = ax + b.
With this substitution dy dy d2y d2y dny dny dx = a dX dx2 = a2 dx2 , …, dxn = an dXn , and Eqn.
(54) reduces to the equation, dny dn- 1y dy an Xn dxn + an-1 Xn-1 dxn- 1 + …+ aX P dx + P y = g(X), …(55) n-1 n where g is transformed form of the function f. Eqn.
(55) is now in Euler’s form and can solved by the methods given earlier.
However, Eqn.
(54) can be directly reduced to an equation with constant coefficients by substituting ax + b = ez, instead of first substituting ax + b = X and then X = ez.
204MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION We illustrate the above theory with the help of following example.
d2y dy Example 8: Solve (3x + 2)2 + 3 (3x + 2) - 36y =3x2 + 4x + 1 dx2 dx Solution: The given equation is an equation reducible to Euler’s equation.
We can, however, reduce it to an equation with constant coefficients by a single substitution.

(59) once again, we get 205MTH 232 ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION dy p = 2(u' e2z - u' e-2z) + 4u e-2z + 4u e-2z …(60) dz 1 2 1 2 Since y (z) must satisfy Eqn.
(56), hence on combining Eqn.
(57), (59) and (60) p we get the second auxiliary condition as 1 2(u' e2z - u' e-2z) = (e2z – 1) 1 2 27 1 (cid:222) u' e2z - u' e-2z = (e2z – 1) …(61) 1 2 54 Solving Eqns.
