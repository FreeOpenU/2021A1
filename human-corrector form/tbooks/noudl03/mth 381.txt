For instance, the area of solid depends on its length and breath.
Potential energy of a body depends on gravity, density and height of the body etc.
moreover, the strength of a material depends upon temperature, density, isotropy softness etc.
2.0 OBJECTIVES To be able to identify function of two or more variables.
The ideal of Jacobian to be extended to three variables.
At the end of this unit, the student ought to be able to use Jacobian to change variables in multiple integral.
Lastly to be able to determine whether two or more functions are linearly dependent or independent 1MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Function of Several Variables In this regards, it would be necessary to define factor (function) of several variables.
If a variablesudepends uponxandy, we say thatuis a function ofxand y, and we can writeu = f(x,y).
It is worth mentioning here that function of one variable can be extended to function of several variables.
For instance; the values of a function f(x,y)at (x ,y )is given by f(x ,y ).
0 0 0 0 Example 1 u(x)(cid:222) a function of a single variable u(x ,x )(cid:222) a function of two variables 1 2 u(x ,x ,x (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) x )(cid:222) a function of several variables 1 2 3 n 3.2 Jacobian Given thatu = u(x,y)andv = v(x,y)are two continuous function of the independence variablesxandysuch that ¶ u ¶ u ¶ v ¶ v , , and ¶ x ¶ y ¶ x ¶ y are also continuous in xandy, then the expression ¶ u ¶ v ¶ u ¶ v - ¶ u ¶ v = ¶ x ¶ x ¶ x ¶ y ¶ y ¶ x ¶ u ¶ v is called ¶ y ¶ y the Jacobian or functional determinant of uand vwith respect toxandy.
It could be written as (cid:230) u v(cid:246) ¶ (u,v) J(cid:231)(cid:231) (cid:247)(cid:247) = Ł x ył ¶ (x,y) 2MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III The idea can be easily extended to three or several variables thus: ¶ u ¶ v ¶ w ¶ x ¶ x ¶ x (cid:230) u,v,w(cid:246) ¶ u ¶ v ¶ w J(cid:231)(cid:231) (cid:247)(cid:247) = Ł x,y,zł ¶ y ¶ y ¶ y ¶ u ¶ v ¶ w ¶ z ¶ z ¶ z Jacobian can be used to change the variables in multiple integrals (cid:242) (cid:242) f(u,v)dudv =(cid:242) (cid:242) f[u(x,y),v(x,y)] ¶ (u,v) dxdy ¶ (x,y) Example 2 Jacobian can be applied to polar coordinaterandq , thus,x = rCosq and y = rSinq .
Then, ¶ x ¶ x J = ¶ (x,y) = ¶ r ¶ q (1) ¶ (r,q ) ¶ y ¶ y ¶ r ¶ q ¶ x ¶ x But = Cosq , = - rCosq (2) ¶ r ¶ q ¶ y ¶ y = Sinq and = rCosq ¶ r ¶ q Substituting equation (2) into (1) gives Cosq - rSinq J = Sinq rCosq = rCos2q - (- rSin2q ) [ ] = r Coc2q + Sin2q = r Since Coc2q + Sin2q =1 ¶ (x,y) \ J = = r ¶ (r,q ) 3.3Function Dependence and Independence Two functionsu(x)and v(x)defined on an interval0< x <1are said to be functionally (linearly) dependent on0< x <1if there exist ‘$ ’ two 3MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III constantsk andk where not both zero, such that‘$ ’ 1 2 k u(x)+ k v(x) = 0forx," xall.
1 2 However, the two functionu(x)and v(x)defined on interval 0< x <1are said to be functionally (linearly) independent on0< x <1an if the only constantsk andk such that‘$ ’ for allxin the interval where both 1 2 constantsk andk are zeros i.e k = k = 0.
1 2 1 2 Example 3 The functionsv(x) = eaxandu(x) = ebxare linearly dependent on the interval0< x <1.
Suppose k eax + k ebx = 0 " xin 0< x <1 (1) 1 2 multiplying equation (1) bye- ax, we obtain k eaxe- ax + k ebxe- ax = 0 (2) 1 2 k + k e(b- a)x = 0 (3) 1 2 differentiating equation (3) we obtain (b- a)k e(b- a)x = 0 (4) 2 (b- a)e(b- a)x „ 0 sinceb- a „ 0 then it implies that b = 0 (5) Substituting (5) into (1), we obtain k aeax = 0 (6) 1 (cid:222) a= 0, since eax „ 0.
Example 4 In similar vein the functionsv(x) = eaxandu(x) = ebxare linearly independent on the interval0< x <1.If k eax + k ebx = 0 (1) 1 2 (k + k x)eax = 0 (2) 1 2 Since eax „ 0, (cid:222) k + k x = 0 (3) 1 2 differentiating equation (3) we obtain k = 0 (4) 1 Substituting (5) into (1), however k eax = 0 (cid:222) k = 0 since eax „ 0 (5) 1 1 4MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 3.3.1 Testing For Linear Dependence or Otherwise A method called Wronskian of the function are used thus consider the ¢ ¢ functions u(x)and v(x)and the first derivatives u (x)andv (x).
This involves the determinant thus: ( ) v(x) u(x) Wronskian = W v(x).u(x) = ¢ ¢ v (x) u (x) = v(x)u¢(x)- u(x)v¢(x) SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Determine whether the following pair of functions are linearly dependent as the case may be i.

(a) Show that the function u(x)and v(x) defined by are linearly u(x) = x2, v(x) = xx independent for the interval0< x <1 .
(b) Compute the Wronskian of these functions 3.4 Multiple Integral 3.4.1 Line Integral Definition: Let f(x)be a single real valued function in the interval a£ x£ b.
Thus we can define line integral as (cid:242) b f(x)dx a 3.4.2 Evaluation of Line Integral (cid:242) b Evaluation of line integral f(x)dxcan be accomplished by two a methods.

Let f(x,y) be a single valued continuous function within a region R bounded by a close curveC.
Then the regionRis called The region of integration.

The basic concepts of differential calculus can be extended to vector function in a simple and natural fashion.
Vector functions are useful for representing and investigating curses and application in mechanics as path of moving bodies.
Integral theorems will be considered in the later path of this unit’s i.e Gauss, Stokes and Greens theorems.
2.0 OBJECTIVES The objectives of this unit is vector field and vector function together.
• understanding of the vector field theory, using vector function to investigate curves and their applications in mechanics; and • further objective is to use integral theorem to solve some physical problems.
Study of Gauss, Stokes and Greens theorems and their applications.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Vector Field Theory A scalar function is a function that is defined at each point of a certain set of points in space and whose values are real numbers depending only 13MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III on the points in real space but not on the particular choice of the coordinate system.
Furthermore, the distance of f(x,y,z)of any point pfrom a fixed point p in space I s a scalar function whose domain of definitionDis the 0 whole space.
f(x,y,z)defines a scalar field in space.
Introducing a Cartesian coordinate x ,y ,z .
Then the distance 0 0 0 f(x,y,z) = (x- x )2 + (y- y )2 + (z- z )2 0 0 0 3.2 Relations between Vector Field and Functions A vector v(p)is a function that is defined on some point setDin space i.e.
the set of points of a curve, a surface or a three dimensional region and associates with each point pinDa vectorv(p).
While a vector field is given in D. We introduce Cartesian coordinates x,y,zthen we may write our vector function in terms of compound function.
[ ] v(x,y,z) = v (x,y,z),v (x,y,z),v (x,y,z) 1 2 3 or using i, j,k,.
Thus v(x,y,z) = v (x,y,z)i+ v (x,y,z)j+ v (x,y,z)k 1 2 3 But we should keep in mind thatv depend only on that points of its domain of definition, and at the point defines the same vector for every choice of the coordinate system.
Our notation in simple scalar and vector quantities in the perquisite course Mathematical methods I and II are the same with that under discussion.
The only difference is that the components v ,v ,v of vnow 1 2 3 becomes functions ofx,y,zsincevis a function ofx,y,z.
3.2.1 Example of Vector Field (Velocity Field) At any instant, the velocity vectorsv(p)of a rotating body Bconstitute a vector field, the so called velocity field of the rotation.
If we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system having the origin on the axis of rotations then [ ] v(x,y,z) = w· z,y,z = w· (xi+ yj+ zk) 14MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Field of tangent vectors of a Gravitational field curve.

If the coordinate are such the z-axis of rotation and w points in the positive direction, then w = wk and i j k [ ] v = 0 0 w = w(- yi+ xj) = w- y,x,0 x y z An example of a rotating body and the corresponding velocity field are shown in Fig 3 Example of Vector Field (Field of Force) Let a particle Aof massM be fixed at a point p and let a particle Bof mass 0 M to be free to take up various positions pin space.
Then A attracts B.
According to Newton’s Law of gravitation, the corresponding gravitational force pis directed from pto p , and its magnitude is 0 proportional to 1 whereris the distance between pand p say.
r2 0 GM M p = A B r2 where G is the gravitational constant 15MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Hence pdefines a vector field in space.
If we introduce Cartesian coordinate such that p has the coordinates x ,y ,z and phas the 0 0 0 0 coordinatesx,y,z, then by Pythagoras theorem.
r = (x- x )2 + (y- y )2 + (z- z )2 (2) 0 0 0 Introducing the vector assumingr > 0then r = (x- x )i+ (y- y )j+ (z- z )k (3) 0 0 0 ( ) we have r = r and - 1 is a unit vector in the direction of p; the minus r sign indicates that pis directed from p+ p .Fig2.
0 Hence substituting (1) into (3) we obtain (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) GM M p = p(cid:231) - r(cid:247) = - A B r Ł r ł r3 GM M [ ] = - A B (x- x )i+ (y- y )j+ (z- z )k (4) r3 0 0 0 Hence, this vector function describes then gravitational force acting on B.
Derivative of a Vector Function A vector function v(t)is said to be differentiable at a point tif the limit exists.
The vector is called the derivative ov(t).
v(t + D t)+ v(t) v¢(t) = lim D ﬁ 0 D t ) pt V1(t) + (t V V (t) Partial Derivates of a Vector Function The way of introducing partial derivation to vector analysis is obvious.
Indeed, let the components of a vector function.

This is obvious because surface integral is simpler and easier to handle compare to triple integral.
Therefore, let T be a closed bounded in a region space whose boundary is a piecewise smooth orienlatable surface S. Let f(x,y,z) be a vector function that is continuous and has continuous first partial derivative in some domain containing T. However, the transformation is done by the so called divergence theorem which involves the divergence of a vector function F. Where divergence of F (cid:230) ¶ F ¶ F ¶ F (cid:246) (cid:222) divF = (cid:231)(cid:231) 1 + 2 + 3 (cid:247)(cid:247) dv = (cid:242) F(cid:242) (cid:215) ndA (2) Ł ¶ x ¶ y ¶ z ł s (cid:242) F(cid:242) (cid:215) ndA=(cid:242) ((cid:242) Fdydz+ F dxdz+ F dxdy) But 1 2 3 (3) s s Where 'n'is the outer unit normal vector of S. but F = Fi+ F j+ F k (4) 1 2 3 17MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III and n = Cosa i+ Cosb j+ Cosgk (5) where a ,b ,and g are the angle between'n'and the positive x,y,andz axes respectively.

Hence D nF (cid:215) nis simply the component of ( ) curl D nF in the positivez-direction.

Examples: the points on a line, the solution of quadratic equation and the points in the interior of a circle made up of sets respectively.
A set is called open if every point of S has a neighborhood consisting entirely of points that belongs to S. that is the points in the interior of a circle or a square from an open set, and so do the points of the “right half – plane”Rez = 0> 0.
An open set S is to be connected if any two of its points can be joined by a broken line of finitely many straight line segments all of where points belong to S. Likewise, an open connected set is called a domain.
Thus an open disk annulus is domains.
An open square with a diagonal removed is not a domain since this set is not connected.
The complement of a set S in the complex plane is defined to be the set of all points of the complex plane that do not belong to S. a set is said to be closed if its complements is open.
Example: the point on and inside the unit circle form a closed set.
A boundary point of a set S is a point every neighbourhood of which contains both points that belong to S and points that do not belong to S. Example: if a set S is open, then no boundary point belongs to S, if S is closed, then every boundary point belongs to S. A region is a set of consisting of a domain plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points.
Next we shall consider function of complex variable but before this we introduce complex functions first.
Complex functions Definition: A real function F defined on a set S of real numbers is a rule that assigns to every X in S a real number f(x), called the value of f at x.
Now in complex, S is a set of complex numbers and a function f r defined on S is a rule that assigns to every Z in a complex number w, called the value of f at z. we write 25MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III w= f (z) Here z varies in S and is called a Complex Variable.
The set S is called the domain of definition of f. Example 1 w= f(z)= z2 +3z in a complex function defined for all z; that is, its domain S is the whole complex plane.
The set of all values of a function f is called the range of f. w is a complex, and we write w=u+iv,where u and v are the real and the imaginary parts, respectively.
Now w is depends on z= x+iy.Hence, u becomes a real function of x and y. and so does v. we may thus write: ( ) w= f(z)=u x,y +iv(x,y).
This shows that a complex function f(z) is equivalent to a pair of real functions u(x,y) and v(x,y), each depending on the two real variable x and y.
Example 2 Function of a complex variable.
Let w= z2 +3z.
Find u and v and calculate the values of f at z = 1 + 3i and z = 2 – i.
Let the real part of w be defined thus u= x2 - y2 +3xand the imaginary part of w i.e.
v=2xy+3y.
\ f (1+3i)=(1+3i)2 +3(1+3i)=- 5+15i Recall that i2 = -1.

26MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 3.0 MAIN CONTENT It was observed early in history that there are equations which are not satisfied y any real number.
Examples are: x2 =- 3 or x2 - 10x+ 40=0 This led to the invention of complex numbers.
Definition A complex number z is an ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers x, y and we write z=(x,y).
We call x the real part of z and y the imaginary part of z and write Rez= x, lmz= y Example 3 Re (4, -3) = 4 and lm (4, -3) = -3, furthermore, we defined two complex numbers z = (x , y ) and z = (x , y ) to be equal if and only if their real 1 1 1 2 2 2 parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.
Z = z if and only if x = x and y = y .
1 2 1 2 1 2 Addition of complex number = (x , y ) and z = (x , y ) is defined by 1 1 1 2 2 2 ( ) ( ) 1. z + z =(x ,y )+ x ,y = x + x ,y + y 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 Multiplication is defined by ( ) ( ) 2. z z =(x ,y ) x ,y = x x - y y ,x y + x y 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 We shall say more about these arithmetic operations and discuss examples below, but we first want to introduce a much more convenient form of writing them as points in the plane.
3.1.1 Representation in the Form z = x + iy A complex number whose imaginary part is zero is of the form (x, 0).
For such numbers we simply have from (1) and (2) 27MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III ( ) ( ) ( ) x ,0 + x ,0 = x + x ,0 1 2 1 2 and ( )( ) ( ) x ,0 x ,0 = x x ,0 1 2 1 2 as for the real numbers.
This suggests that we identify (x, 0) with the real number x. hence the complex number system is an extension of the real number system.
The complex number (0,1) is denoted by i. i=(o,1) and is called the imaginary unit.
We show that it has the property.
3. i2 =- 1 Indeed, from (2) we have i2 =(0.1)(0.1)=(- 1,0)=- 1futheremore, for everyreal ywe obtain from(2) ( )( ) ( ) iy= 0,1 y,0 = 0,y Combining this with the above x = (x, 0) and using (1), that is, ( ) ( ) ( ) x,y = x,0 + 0,y , We see that we can write every complex number z = (x, y) in the form z= x+iy or z = x + yi.
This is done in practice almost exclusively.

It is of great importance in applications.
This idea is quite simple and natural.
We choose two perpendicular coordinate axes, the horizontal x – axis, called the real axis, and the vertical y – axis called 28MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III the imaginary axis.
On both axes we choose the same unit of length (Fig.
295).
This is called a Cartesian coordinate system.
We now plot z = (x, y) = x + iy as the point P with coordinates x, y.
The xy – plane in which the complex numbers are represented in this way is called the complex plane or Argand diagram.
Figure 296 shows an example.
Instead of staying “the point represented by z in the complex plane” we say briefly and simply “the point z in the complex plane” this will cause no misunderstandings.

Addition the sum of z = x + iy and z = x + iy can now be written 1 1 1 2 2 2 ( ) ( ) 4. z + z = x + x +i y + y .
1 2 1 2 1 2 Example 5 ( ) ( ) 5+i + 1+3i = 6+4i.
We see that addition of complex numbers is in accordance with the “parallelogram law” by which forces are added in mechanics (Fig.
297).
Subtraction is defined to be the inverse operation of addition.
That is the difference z= z - z is the complex number z for whichz= z + z .

1 2 1 2 1 2 29MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Example 6 ( ) ( ) 5+i - 1+3i =4- 2i Multiplication: The Product z z in (2) can now be written 1 2 ( )( ) ( ) ( ) 6. z z = x +iy x +iy = x x - y y + i x y + x y .
1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 This is easy to remember since it is obtained formally by the rules of arithmetic for real numbers and using (3), that is i2 = - 1 Example 7 ( )( ) 5+i 1+3i =5+15i + i+3i2 =2+16i Division is defined to be the inverse operation of multiplication.
That is, the quotient z = z z is the complex number z = x + iy for which 1 2 ( )( ) ( ) 7. z = zz = x+iy x +iy z „ 0.
1 2 2 2 2 We show that for z „ 0thequtotientz = x + iy = z z is given by 2 1 2 x x + y y x y - x y ( ) (8*) x = 1 2 1 2 , y = 2 1 1 2 z „ 0. x2 + y2 x2 + y2 2 2 2 2 2 The practical rule for getting (8*) is the implication of both the numerator and the denominator of the quotient z /z by x – iy and 1 2 2 2 simplification: ( )( ) x +iy x +iy x - iy 8. z = 1 1 = ( 1 1 )( 2 2) x + iy x +iy x - iy 2 2 1 2 2 2 x x + y y x y - x y = 1 2 1 2 + i 2 1 1 2 x2 + y2 x2 + y2 2 2 2 2 Example 8 If z = 9 – 8i and z = 5 + 2i, then 1 2 ( )( ) 9 - 8i 9 - 8i 5 - 2i 1 = ( )( ) 5 + 2i 5 +2i 5 - 2i 1 45 - 18i - 40i - 16 = =1- 2i.
25 + 4 The reader may check this result by showing that 30MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III ( )( ) zz = 1 - 2i 5 + 2i = 9 - 8i = z .
2 1 A proof of (8*) runs as follows, from (6) we see that (7) can be written ( ) ( ) x + iy = x x - y y + i y x + x y .
1 1 2 2 2 2 By the definition of equality the real parts and he imaginary parts on both sides must be equal: x = x x - y y 1 2 2 y = y x - x y 1 2 2 This is a system of two linear equation in the unknown x and y, assuming that x and y are both zero (briefly written z ≠ 0), we obtain 2 2 2 the unique solution (8*).
3.1.4 Properties of the Arithmetic Operations From the familiar laws for real numbers we obtain for any complex numbers z , z , z , z the following laws (where – z = x – iy): 1 2 3 z + z = z + z (cid:252) 1 2 2 1(cid:253) (Commutative laws) z z = z z (cid:254) 1 2 2 1 ( ) ( ) z + z + z = z + z + z (cid:252) ( 1 ) 2 3( ) 1 2 3 (cid:253) (Associative laws) z z z = z z z (cid:254) 1 2 3 1 2 3 ( ) 9. z z + z = z z + z z (Distributive) 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 0 + z = z + 0 = z ( ) ( ) z + - z = - z + z = 0 z .
1 = z 3.1.5 Complex Conjugate Numbers Let z = x + iy be any complex number.
Then x – iy is called the conjugate of z and is denoted byz , thus, z = x + iy, z = x - iy.
Example 9 The conjugate of z=5 +2i z = 5 - 2i(Fig.

299: Complex Conjugate Numbers Conjugates are useful since zz = x2 + y2is real, a property we used we used the above division.
Moreover, addition and subtraction yields z + z = 2x, z - z = 2iy,so that we can express the real part and the imaginary part of z by the important formulas.

z is said to be pure imaginary if and only if x = 0, hence z = -z.

3.2 Polar Form of Complex Number Powers and Roots 32MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III It is often practical to express complex numbers z = x + iy in terms of polar coordinates r, θ, these are defined by: 1. x = rcosq , y = rsinq By substituting this we obtain the polar form of z, ( ) 2. z =rcosq +irsinq = r cosq + isinq R is called the absolute value or modulus of z and is denoted by z .Hence 3. z = r = x2 + y2 = zz Geometrically, z is the distance of he point z from the origin (Fig.
300).
Similarly, z - z is the distance between z and z (Fig.
301).
1 2 1 2 θ is called the argument of z and is denoted by arg z. thus (Fig.

Here, as in calculus, all angles are measured in radians and positive in the counterclockwise series.

(Why?)
For given z ≠ 0 it is determined only up to integer multiples of 2π.
The value of θ that lies 33MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III in the interval – π < θ ≤ π is called the principal value of the argument of z (≠ 0) and is denoted by Arg.

Thus θ = Arg z satisfies by definition.
- p < Arg z ≤ π.
Example 11 Polar Form of Complex Numbers Principal Value Let z = 1 + I (cf.
Fig.
302).
Then (cid:230) p p (cid:246) p z = 2(cid:231) cos + isin (cid:247) , z = 2, argz = – 2np (n = 0,1,........0.)
Ł 4 4ł 4 The principal value of the argument is arg z = π/4, other values are - 7π/ 4, 9π/4, etc.
Example 12 Polar Form of Complex Numbers Principal Value.
(cid:230) p p (cid:246) Let z = 3 + 3 i,then z=6(cid:231) cos + isin (cid:247) , the absolute value of z is z = 6, Ł 3 3ł and the principal value of arg z is Arg z = π/3.
Caution!
In using (4), we must pay attention to the quadrant in which z lies, since tan θ has period π, so that the arguments of z and –z have the same tangent.
Example: for θ = arg (1+i) and θ = arg (-1 – i) 1 2 we have tan θ = tan θ = 1.
1 2 Triangle Inequality For any complex numbers we have the importance triangle inequality 5. z + z £ z + z (Fig.303) 1 2 1 2 Which we shall use quite frequently, this inequality follows by nothing that y z + z 1 2 z 2 z 1 x 34 Fig 303: Triangle Inequality MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III The three points 0, z and z + z are the vertices of a triangle (fig.
3030) 1 1 2 with sides z , z and z + z ,and the side cannot exceed the sum of the 1 2 1 2 other two sides.
A formal proof is left to the reader (Prob.45) Example 13 If z = 1 + i and z = -2 + 3i, then (sketch a figure!)
1 2 z + z = - 1+ 4i = 17 = 4.123— 2 + 13 = 5.020.
1 2 By induction the triangle inequality can be extended to arbitrary sums: 6. z + z + .....+ z £ z + z + ...+ z ; 1 2 n 1 2 n That is, the absolute value of a sum cannot exceed the sum of the absolute values of the terms.
3.2.1 Multiplication and Division in Polar Form This will give us a better understanding of multiplication and division.
Let: ( ) ( ) z = r cosq + isinq and z = r cosq +isinq .
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 Then, by (6), sec.
12.1, the product is at first [( ) ( )] z z =rr cosq cosq - sinq sinq + i sinq cosq + cosq sinq 2 .
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 The addition rules for the sine and cosine (6) in appendix 3.1) now yield [ ( ) ( )] 7. z z = rr cos q + q + isin q + q 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 Taking absolute values and arguments on both sides, we thus obtain the important rules 8. z z = z z 1 2 1 2 and ( ) 9. arg z z =argz + arg z (uptomultiplesof 2p ).
1 2 1 2 We now turn to division.
The quotient z = z z is the number z satisfying 1 2 ( ) zz = z .
Hence zz = z z = z ,arg zz = argz+ arg z = arg z .
2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 This yield 35MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III z z ( ) 10.
1 = 1 z „ 0 z z 2 2 2 and z ( ) 11. arg 1 = arg z - arg z uptomultiplesof 2p .
z 1 2 2 By combining these two formulas (10) and (11) we also have z r [ ( ) ( )] 12.
1 = 1 cos q - q + isin q - q .
z r 1 2 1 2 2 2 Example 13 Illustration of formulas (8) – (11) Let z = - 2 + 2i and z = 3i.Then z z 1 2 1 2 =- 6 - 6i, z /z = 2/3 + (2/3) = z / z .
1 2 1 2 and for the arguments we obtain Arg z = 3π/4, Arg z = π/2.
1 2 - 3p Arg z z = = Arg z + Arg z - 2p 1 2 4 1 2 p ( ) Arg z /z = = Argz - Arg z 1 2 4 1 2 Integer power of z From (7) and (12) we have ( ) z2 = r2 cos2q + isin2q , [ ( ) ( )] z- 2 = r- 2 cos - 2q + isin - 2q and more generally, for any integer n, ( ) 13. zn = rn cos nq + isinnq .
Example 14 Formula of De Moivre For z = r = 1, formula (3) yields the so – called formula of De Moivre ( ) (13*) cosq +isinq n = cos nq + isinnq .
36MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III This formula is useful for expressing cos nθ in terms of cos θ and sin θ.
For instance when n = 2 and we take the real and imaginary parts on both sides of (13*), we get the familiar formulas.
cos2q = cos2q - sin2, sin2q = 2cosq sinq .
This illustrates the general fact that complex methods often simply the deviation of real formulas.
3.2.2 Roots ( ) If z= wn n= 1,2,...,then to each value of w there corresponds one value of z, we shall immediately see that to a given z ≠ 0 there correspond precisely n distinct values of w. each of these values is called an nth root of z, and we write: 14. w=n z.
Hence this symbol is multivalued, namely, n – valued, in contrast to the usual conventions made in real calculus.
The n value of n z can easily be determined as follows.
In terms of polar forms for z and ( ) w = R cosf + isin f , The equation wn = z becomes ( ) ( ) wn = Rn cosnf + isinnf = z=r cosf + isinq By equating the absolute values on both sides we have Rn = r, thus R =n r Where the root is real positive and thus uniquely determined.
By equating the arguments we obtain q 2kp nf = q + 2kp , thus f = + n n Where k is an integer.
For k = 0,1, …, n – 1 we get n distinct values of w. further integers of k would give values already obtained.
For instance, k = n gives 2kπ/n = 2π, hence the w corresponding to k = 0, etc.
consequently,n z , for z ≠ 0, has the n distinct values (cid:230) q + 2kp q + 2kp (cid:246) 15. n z = n r(cid:231) cos + isin (cid:247) k = 0,1,...n- 1.
Ł n n ł These n values lie on a circle of radius n r with center at the origin and constitute the vertices of a regular polygon of n sides.
37MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III The value of n z obtained by taking the principal value of arg z and k = 0 in (15) is called the principal value of w = n z Example 15 Square Root From (15) it follows that w = z has the two values (cid:230) q q (cid:246) 16a.
w = r(cid:231) cos + isin (cid:247) 1 Ł 2 2ł and Ø (cid:230) q (cid:246) (cid:230) q (cid:246) ø 16b.

For instance, the square (cid:230) p p (cid:246) ( ) root of 4i has the values 4i – 2(cid:231) cos + isin (cid:247) = – 2 + i 2 .
Ł 4 4ł From (16) we can obtain the much more practical formula 17. z = – ŒØ (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:230) 1( z) + x(cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:246) +(signy)i 1( z - x)œø Œº Ł 2 ł 2 œß Where sign y = 1 if y ≥0, sign y = - 1 if y < 0, and all square toots of positive numbers are taken with the positive sign.

These values are the vertices of a regular polygon of n sides inscribed in the unit circle, with one vertex at the point 1.
Each of these n values is called an nth root of unity.
For instance, 4 1 has the value 1, i, -1 and –i (Fig.

The student should be the problems related to the polar representation with particular care, since we shall need this representation quite often in our work.
In the next section we discuss some curves and regions in the complex plane which we shall also need in the chapters on complex analysis.
3.3 Curves an Regions in the Complex Plane In this section we consider some important curves and regions and some related concepts we shall frequently need.
This will also help us to become more familiar with the complex plane.
The distance between two points z and a is z - a .
Hence a circle C of radius p and center at a (fig.
307) can be represented by 1. z - a = ρ.
In particular, the so-called unit, that is the circle of radius 1 and center at the origin a = 0 (fig.
308), is given by 40MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III z = 1.
Furthermore, the inequality 2. z - a < ρ Holds for every point z inside C: that is, (2) represents the interior of C. Such a region is called a circular disk or, more precisely, an open circular disk, in contrast to the closed circular disk.
z - a ≤ ρ.
This consists of the interior of C and C itself.
The open disk (2) is also called a neighbourhood of the point a. obviously, a has infinitely many such neighbourhoods, each of which corresponds to a certain value of p (> 0); and a belongs to each of these neighbourhoods, that is a, is a point of each of them.

(b) The unit circle and its interior.
This is called the closed ad disk (c) The exterior of the unit circle By the (open) upper half we mean the set of all points z = x + iy such thaty > 0.
Similarly, the condition y < 0 defines the lower half – plane, x > 0the right half – plane and x < 0 the left half – plane.
3.3.1 Some Concepts Related to Sets in the Complex Plane We finally list a few concepts that are of general interest and will be used in our further work.
The term set of points in the complex plane means any sort of collection of a quadratic equation.
The points on a line, and the points in the interior of a circle are sets.
A set S is called open if every point of S has a neighbourhood consisting entirely of points that belong to S. for example, the neighbourhood consisting entirely of points that belong to S. for example, the points in the interior of a circle or a square form an open set, and so do the points of the “right half – plane” Re z = x > 0.
An open set S is said to be connected if any two of its points can be joined by a broken line of finitely many straight line segments all of whose points belong to S. an open connected set is called a domain.
42MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Thus an open disk (2) and an open annulus (3) are domains.
An open square with a diagonal removed is not a domain since this set is not connected.
(Why?).
The complement of a set S in the complex plane is defined to be the set of all points of the complex plane that do not belong to S. a set is called closed if its complement is open.
For example, the points on and inside the unit circle form a closed set (“closed unit disk” cf.
example 2) since its complement z > is open.
A boundary point of a set S is points every neighbourhood of which contains both points that belong to S and points that do not belong to S and points that do not belong to S. for example; the boundary points of an annulus are the points on the two bounding circles.
Clearly, if a set S is open, then no boundary point belongs to S; is S is closed, and then every boundary point belongs to S. A region is a set of a domain plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points.
(The reader is warned that some authors use the term “region” for what we call a domain (following the modern standard terminology) and others make no distinction between the two terms.)
So far we have been concerned with complex numbers and the complex plane (just as at the beginning of calculus, one talks about real numbers and the real line).
In the next section we start doing complex calculus: we introduce complex functions and derivatives.
This will generalize familiar concepts of calculus.

Hence, we should first say what we mean by a complex function and then define the concepts of limit and derivative in complex.
This discussion will be quite similar to that in calculus.
3.4.1 Complex Function Recall from the calculus that a real function f defined on a set S of real numbers (usually an interval) is a rule that assigns to every x in S a real number f(x) called the value of f at x.
Now in complex, S is set of complex numbers.
And a function f defined on S is a rule that assigns to every z in S a complex number w, called the value of f at z. write w= f(z) Here z varies in S and is called a complex variable.
The set S is called the domain of definition of f. Example 21 w= f(z)= Z2 + 3z is a complex function defined for all z; that is, its domain S is the whole complex plane.
The set of all values of a function f is called the range of f. W is complex, and we write w = u + iv, where u and v are the real and imaginary parts, respectively.
Now w depends on z = x + iy.
Hence u becomes a real function; of x and y, and so does v. We may thus write: ( ) ( ) ( ) w = f z =u x,y + iv x,y .
This shows that a complex function f(z) is equivalent to a pair of real functions u(x,y) and depending on the two real variables x and y.
Example 22 Function of a Complex Variable Let w = f(z) = z2 = 3z.
Find u and v and z = 2 –i.
44MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Solution u = Re f(z) = x2 + y2 +3xandv=2xy + 3y , also, ( ) ( ) ( ) f 1+ 3i = 1+ 3i 2 + 31+ 3i = 1- 9 + 6i + 3 + 9i = - 5 + 15i This shows that u(1,3) = -5 and v (1,3) = 15, similarly.
( ) ( ) ( ) f 2 - i = 2 - i 2 + 3 2 - i = 4i + 6 - 3i = 9 - 7i.
Example 23 Function of a Complex Variable Let w= f(z) = 2iz +6z..Find u and v and the value for f at z = 1 + 4i 2 Solution f (z) = 2i(x +iy) + 6(x- iy) gives u(x,y)= 6x- 2y andv(x,y) = 2x - 6y.
Also (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) (cid:230) 1 (cid:246) f(cid:231) + 4i(cid:247) = 2i(cid:231) + 4i(cid:247) + 6(cid:231)(cid:231) - 4i(cid:247)(cid:247) = i - 8 +3- 24i = - 5 - 23i.
Ł 2 ł Ł 2 ł Ł 2 ł Limit, Continuity A function f(z) is said to be limit l as z approaches a point z written 0, 1. lim (f (z) = l y v z 0 ∂ z 0 f(z) θ l x u Fig 310: Limit z If f is defined in a neighbouhood of 0 (except itself) and if the values of z f are “close” to l for all z “close” to 0 that is, in precise terms, for every ; positive real ˛ we can find a positive real ∂ such that for z„ z in the 0 disk z- z < ¶ (Fig.310)we have 0 2. f (z) - l < ˛ ; 45MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III That is, for every z„ z in that the value of f lies inn the disk (2).
0 Formally, this definition is similar to that in calculus, but there is a big difference.
Whereas in the real line, here, by definition, z may approach z from any direction inn the complex plane.
This will be quite essential 0 in what follows.
If a limit exists, it is unique.
(Cf.

30) A function f(z) is said to be continuous at z = z if f(z ) is defined and 0 0 lim f(z) = f(z ).
3. zﬁ z 0 0 Note that by the definition of a limit this implies that f(z) is defined in some neighbourhood of z .
0 F(z) is said to be continuous in a domain if it is continuous at each point of this domain.
3.4.3 Derivative The derivative of a complex function f at a point z is written f '(z ) 0 0 and is defined by ( ) f z + D z - f(z ) 4. f '(z ) = lim 0 0 0 D zﬁ 0 D z Provided this limit exists.
Then f is said to be differentiable at z .
if we 0 write D z = z - z we also have, since D z = z + z 0 0 f (z) - f (z ) (4’) f ' lim 0 zﬁ z z - z 0 0 Remember that this definition of a limit implies that f(z) is defined (at least) in a neighbourhood of z .
Also by that definition, z may approach 0 z from any direction.
Hence differentially at z means that, along 0 0 whatever path z approaches z , the quotient in (4’) always approaches a 0 certain value and all these values are equal.
This is important and should be kept in mind.
Example 24 46MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Differentiability Derivatives The function f(z) = z is differentiate for all z and has the derivatives f’ 2 (z) = 2z because ( ) z + D z 2 - z2 f '(z) lim = 2z.

It is continuo s at z .

311:Paths in (5) 47MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III These are the functions that are differentiable in some domain, so that we can do “calculus in complex.” They are the main concern of complex analysis.
Their introduction is our main goal in this section; Definition (Analyticity) A function f(z) is said to be analytical in a domain D is f(z) is defined and differentiable at all points of D. the function f(z) is said to be analytic at a pointz = z in D if f(z) is analytic in a neighborhood (cf.
0 sec.
12.3) of z .
0 Also, by analytical function we mean a function that is analytical in some domain.
Hence, analytical of f(z) at z means that f (z) has a derivative at every 0 point in some neighbourhood of z (including z itself since, by 0 0 definition, z is a point of all its neighbourhood).
This concept is 0 motivated by the fact that it is of no practical interest when a function is differentiable merely at a single point z but not throughout some 0 neighbourhood of z .
Problem 28 gives an example.
0 An older term for analytical in D is regular in D, and a more modern term is holomorphic in D. Example 26 Polynomids Rational Functions The integer power 1, z, z2, … and more generally, polynomials, that is functions of the form f (z)=c +c z+c z2 + ...c zn 0 1 2 n Where c … are complex constants, are analytical in the entire complex 0 plane.

it is algebra every rational function can be 0 written as a sum of a polynomial (which may be 0) and finitely partial fractions.
The concepts discussed in this section extend familiar concepts of calculus.
Most important is the concept of an analytic function.
Indeed, .complex analysis is concerned exclusively with analytic functions and although many will yield a branch of mathematics, that is most beautiful from the theoretical point of view and most useful for practical purposes.
Before we consider special analytic functions (exponential functions, cosine, sine etc.)
let us give equations by means of which we can readily decide whether a function is analytic or not.
These are the famous Cauchy–Riemann equation, which we discuss in the next section.
3.5 Cauchy – Riemann Equations We shall now derive a very important criterion (a test) for the analyticity of a complex function.
w= f(z)=u(x,y)+i(x,y).
Roughly, f is analytic in a domain D if and only if the first partial derivatives of u and v satisfy the two equations 1. u = u u = - v .
2 y, y 2 Everywhere in D, here ux = ¶ u¶ x and uy = ¶ u¶ y(and similarity for x() are the usual notations for partial derivatives.
The precise formulation of this statement is given in Theorem 1 and 2 below.
The equation (1) is called the Cauchy – Riemann equations.
They are the most important equation in the whole chapter.
Example 27 f (z) = z2 = x2 - y2 + 2ixy is analytic for all z, and u= x2 - y2 and v=2xy Satisfy (1), namely, u =2x=v and u = - 2y= - v more examples will x y y x follow.
3.5.1 Theorem 1 (Cauchy Riemann Equations) Let f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) be defined and continuous in some neighborhood of a point z = x + iy and differentiable at z itself.
Then at 49MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III the point, the first – order partial derivatives of u and v exist and satisfy the Cauchy Riemann equations (1).
Hence if f(z) is analytic in a domain f’ (z) at z exists.
It is given by satisfy (1) at all points of D. Proof By assumption, the derivative f’ (z) at z exists.
It given by ( ) f z+D z - f(z) 2. f '(z)= lim D zﬁ 0 D z The idea of the proof is very simple, by the definition of a limit in complex (cf.
sec.
12.4) we can let ∆z approaches zero along any path in a neighborhood of z.
Thus we may choose the two paths I and II in fig.
312 and equate the results.
By comparing the real parts we shall obtain the first Cauchy Riemann equation and by comparing the imaginary parts the other equation in (1).
The technical details are as follows.
We write ∆z = ∆x + ∆y.
In terms of u an v, the derivative in (2) becomes [ ( ) ( )] [ ( ) ( )] ( ) u x+ D x,y+ D y +iv x+D x,y+ D y - u x,y +iv x,y 3. f ' z = lim D zﬁ 0 D x+iD y We first choose path I in fig.
312.
Thus we let D yﬁ 0 first andthenD x ﬁ 0. y II z +∆z z I x Fig.
312: Paths in (2) After ∆y becomes zero, ∆z = ∆x.
then (3) becomes, if we first write the two u – terms and then two v-terms.
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) u x+ D x,y - u x,y v x+ D x,y - v x,y f '(z)= lim +i lim D xﬁ 0 D x D xﬁ 0 D x Since f’(z) exists, the two real limits on the right exist.
By definition, they are the partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x. hence the derivative f’ (z) of f(z) can be written 50MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 4. f '(z) = u +iv x x Similarly, if we choose path II in fig 312, we let D xﬁ 0first and then D yﬁ 0.
After ∆x becomes zero, ∆z = i∆y, so that from (3) we now obtain ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) u x ,y+D y - u x,y v x,y+D y - v x,y f '(z)= lim +i lim D yﬁ 0 iD y D yﬁ 0 iD y Since f’(z) exists, the limits on the right exist and yield partial derivatives with respect to y; noting that 1/i = -i, we obtain: 5. f '(z) =- iu +v y y The existence of the derivatives f '(z) thus implies the existence of the four partial derivatives in (4) and (5).
By equating the real parts u and x v in (4) and (5) we obtain the first Cauchy – Riemann equation (1).
y Equating the imaginary parts yields the other.
This proves the first statements of the theorem and implies the second because of the definition of analyticity.
Formulas (4) and (5) are also quite practical for calculating derivatives f '(z), as we shall see.
Examples 28 Cauchy – Riemann equations f (z)= z2is analytic for all z. it follows that the Cauchy – Riemann equations must be satisfied (as we have verified above).
For f (z)= z = x- iy we have u = x, v = -y and see that the second Cauchy Riemann equation is satisfied, u = - v = 0, but the first is not: y x u =1„ v =- 1.we conclude that f (z)= zis not analytic, confirming x y example 4 of sec.
12.4.
Note the savings in calculation!
The Cauchy – Riemann equations are fundamental because they are not only necessary but also sufficient for a function to be analytic.
More precisely, the following holds.
Theorem 2 (Cauchy – Riemann Equations) If two real – valued continuous functions u(x,y) and v(x,y) of two real variables x and y have continuous first partial derivatives that satisfy the 51MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Cauchy – Riemann equations in some domain D, then the complex function f(z) =u(x,y) + iv(x,y)is analytic in D. The proof of this theorem is more involved that the previous proof; we leave it optional and include it on P. 762 near the end of the chapter.
Theorems 1 and 2 are of great practical importance, since by using the Cauchy – Riemann equations we can now easily find out whether or not a given complex function is analytic.
Example 29 Cauchy – Riemann Equations Is f(z) = z2 analytic?
Solution We find u = x3 – 3xy and v = 3x2y and v = 3x2y – y3.
next we calculate U = 3x – 3y , v = 3x2 – 3y2 x 2 2 y U = -6xy, v = 6xy y x We see that the Cauchy – Riemann equations are satisfied for every z, hence f (z) = z3 is analytic for every z, by theorem 2.
Example 30 Determination of an Analytic Function with given Real Part We illustrate another class of practical; that can be solved by the Cauchy – Riemann equations.
Find the most general analytic function f(z) whose real part is u = x3 – y2 – x.
Solution We have u = 2x – 1 = v by the first Cauchy – Riemann equation.
This z y we integrate with respect to y; v=2xy- y+k(x).
As an important point, since we integrated a partial derivative with respect to y, the “constant” of integration k may depend on the other variable, x.
(To understand this, calculate v from the v.) from v and the y second Cauchy – Riemann equation.
52MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III dk u = - v = - 2y + y x dx On the other hand, from the given u = x2 – y2 – x we have u = -2y.
By y comparison, dy/dx = 0.
Hence k = constant, which must be real.
(Why?).
The result is f (z) =u+iv= x2 - y2 - x+i(2xy- y+ k).
We can express in terms of z, namely, f(z) = z2 – z + ik.
Example 31 An Analytic Function of Constant Absolute Value is Constant The Cauchy – Riemann equations also help to establish general properties of analytic functions.
For example, show that if f (z) is analytic in a domain D and f (z) =k= constant in D, then f(z) = constant in D. Solution By assumption, u2 +v2 =k2by differentiation.
uu - vu = 0. uu + vv = 0. x x y y From this and the Cauchy – Riemann equations.
6.
(a) uu - uu = 0.
(b) uu + uu = 0 x y y x To get rid of u multiply (6a) by u and (6b) by v and add.
Similarly to y eliminate u , multiply (6a) by – v and (6b) by u and add.
This yield.
x ( ) ( ) u2 + v2 u = 0. u2 + v2 u = 0. x y If K2 = u2 + v2 = 0, then u = v, hence f = 0. if k „ 0, then u = u =0, x y hence by the Cauchy – Riemann equations, also v = v = 0.together, x y u = constant and v = constant, hence f = constant.
We mention that if we use polar form z = r(cos θ + isin θ) and set f(z) = u(r, θ), then the Cauchy – Riemann equations are 1 - 1 7. u = vq and v = uq r r r r 53MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III The derivative can then be calculated from ( )( ) 8a.
f '(z)= u +iv cosq - isinq r r or from ( )( ) 8b.
f '(z)= v - iu cosq - isinq /r .
q q Example 32 Cauchy – Riemann equations in polar form ( ) let f '(z)= z3=r3 cos3q +isin3q .Thenu=r3cos3q ,v=r3sin3q .
By definition, u =3r2 cos3q , v =3r3cos3q , r q v 3r2sin3q , u =3r3sin3q r q We see that (7) holds for all z „ 0.this confirms that z3 is analytic for all z „ 0.
(and we know that it is also analytic at (z = 0).
From (8b) we obtain the derivative as expected.
f '(z)=3r2(cos3q +isin3q )(cosq - isinq )=3z2.
Laplace’s Equation: Harmonic functions One of the main reasons for the great practical importance of complex analysis in engineering mathematics results form the fact that the real part of an analytic function f = u + iv satisfies the so – called Laplace’s equation.
9.
V2u=u +u =0.
xx yy (V2 read “nabla squared”) and the same holds fort the imaginary part 10.
V2v=v +v =0.
xx yy Laplace’s equation is one of the most equations in physics, occurring in gravitation, electrostatics, fluid flow, etc.
(cf.
chaps.
11, 17) let us discover why this equation arises in complex analysis.
Theorem 3 (Laplace’s Equation) If f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) is analytic in a domain d, then u and v satisfy Laplace’s equation (9) and (10) in d and have continuous second partial derivatives in D. 54MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Proof: Differntiating u = v with respect to x and u = v with respect to y, we x y y x obtain 11. u = v u =- v .
xx yx yy xy Now the derivative of an analytic function is itself analytic, as we shall prove later (in sec.
13.6).
This implies that u and v have continuous partial derivatives of all orders; in particular, the mixed second derivatives are equal; v = v .
By adding (11) we this obtain (9).
yx xy Similarly, (10), is obtained by differentiating u = v with respect to y x y and u = -v with respect to x and subtracting, suing u = u .
y x xy yx Solutions of Laplace’s equation having continuous second – order partial derivatives are called harmonic functions and their theory is called potential theory (cf.
also sec.
11.11).
Hence the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic functions.
If two harmonic functions u and v satisfy the Cauchy – Riemann equations in a domain d, they are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function f in d. Then v is said to be a conjugate harmonic function of u in d. (of course this use of the word “conjugate” has nothing to do with that employed in definingz , the conjugate of a complex number z).
A conjugate of a given harmonic function can be obtained from the Cauchy – Riemann equations, as may be illustrated by the following example.
Example 33 Conjugate Harmonic Function Verify that u= x2 - y2 - yis harmonic in the complex plane and find a conjugate harmonic function of v of u.
Solution V2u=0 by direct calculation.
Now u =2xandu =- 2y- 1.hence a x y conjugate v of u must satisfy v=u =2x, v =- u =2y+1.
x x y Integrating the first equation with respect to y and differentiating the result with respect to x, we obtain.
55MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III dh v=2xy+h(x), v =2y+ x dx A comparison with the second shows that dh/dx = 1.
This gives h(x) = x + c. hence v=2xy+ x+c(canyrealconstant)is the most general conjugate harmonic of the given u.
The corresponding analytic function is f (z)=u+iv= x2 - y2 - y+i(2xy+ x+c)= z2 +iz+ic.
The Cauchy – Riemann equations are the most important equations in this chapter.
Their relation to Laplace’s equation opens wide ranges of engineering and physical applications, as we shown in chapter 17.
In the remainder of this chapter we discuss elementary functions, one after the other, beginning with ez in the next section.
Without knowing these functions and their properties we would not be able to do any useful practical work.
This is just as in calculus.
3.6 Exponential Function The remaining sections of this chapter will be devoted to the most important elementary complex function, logarithm, trigonometric functions, etc we shall see that these complex function can easily be defined in such a way that, for real values of the independent variable, the function become identical with the familiar real functions.
Some of the complex functions have interesting properties.
Which do not show when the independent variable is restricted to real values.
The student should follow the consideration with great care, because these elementary functions will be frequently needed in applications.
We begin with the complex exponential function also written one of most important analytic functions.
The definition of ez terms of the real function ex cos y and sine y is ez = ex(cos y + sin y).
This definition 10 is motivated by requirement that make ez a natural extension of the real exponential function ex, namely.
(a) ez should reduce to the latter when z = x is real; (b) ez should be an entire function, that is analytic for all z, and resembling calculus, its derivative should be 2.
(ez)1 = ez from (1) we see that (a) holds, since cos 0 = 1 and sin 0 = 0. that ez is entire is easily verified by the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
Formula (2) then follows from (4) in sec 12.5.
(ez)1 = (ez cos y) + i(ex sin y) = ez cos y + iez sin y = ez.
z x 56MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III ez.
has further interesting properties.
Let us first show that, as in real, we have the functional relations 3. ez1=Z2 = ez1eZ2 For any z1= x1+iy1a(nd z2 = x2 +iy2, indeed, by (1). )
ez1ez2 = ex1 cosy +isin y )ex2(cosy +isin y .
1 1 2 2 Since ex1ex2 =ex1 +ex2 for these real functions, by an application of the addition formulas for the cosine and sine functions (similar to that in sec.
12.2) we find that this equals ( ( ) ) ez1ez2 = ex1 cos y + y +isin(y + y ) =ez1+ z2 1 2 1 2 As asserted.
An 7. eiy = cos y + isin y = cos2 y + sin2 y =1.
That is, for pure imaginary exponents the exponential function has absolute value one, a result the student should remember.
From (7) and (1), 8. ez = ex.Hence arg ez = y+ 2np (n= 0,1,2,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) )(cid:215) since ez = ex.shows that (1) is actuallyexin polar form.
Example 34 Illustration of Some Properties of the Exponential Function Computation of values from (1) provides no problem.
For instance, verify that e1.4- 0.6i = e1.4(cos0.6- isin0.6)= 4.055(0.825- 0.565i)= 3.347- 2.290i, e1.4- 0.6i = e1.4 = 4.055, Arge1.4- 0.6i = - 0.6.
Since cos2p =1and sin2p = 0, we have from (5) 9. e2p i =1 Furthermore use (1), (5) or (6) to verify these important special values: 57MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 10. ep i2 = i, ep i = - 1, e- p i2 = - i, e- p i = - 1.
To illustrate (3), take the product of e2+i = e2(cosi + isin1)= e4- ie4(cos1- isin1) and verify that equals e2e4(cos21+ sin21)= e6 = e(2+i)- (4- i).
Finally, conclude from ez = ex „ 0in (8)that 11. ex „ 0for all z So here we have an entire function that never vanishes, in contrast to (non-constant) polynomials, which are also entire (Example 5 in Sec.
2.4) but always have zero, as is proved in algebra.
[Can you obtain (11) from (3) ?]
Periodicity of exwith period2p i, 12. ez+ 2p i = ez all z is a basic property that follows from (1) and the periodicity of cosy and siny.
[It also follows from (3) and (9).]
Hence all the values that w= ez can assume are already assumed in the horizontal strip of widt2p 13.
- p < y£ p This infinite strip is called a fundamental region of ex.
Example 35 Solution of an Equation Find all solution of ex = 3+ 4i Solution ex = ex = 5, x= In 5=1.609is a real part of all solutions.
Furthermore, sinceex = 5, ex cos y = 3, ex sin y = 4, cosy = 0.6, siny = 0.8, y = 0.927. y π x - 58MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Fig.

13: Fundamental Region of the Exponential Function ez I in the z-plane Ans.z =1.609+ 0.927i – 2np i (n= 0,1,2,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215)).
These are infinitely many solutions (due to the periodicity ofez).
They lie on the vertical line x=1.609 at a distance 2p from their neighbors.
To summarize: many properties of ez = expzparallel to those of ex; an exception is the periodicity of exwith2p i, which suggested the concept of a fundamental region and causes the periodicity of cosz and sinz with the real period2p , as we shall see in the next section.
Keep in mind that ez is an entire function.
(Do you still remember what that means?)
3.7 Trigonometric Functions, Hyperbolic Function Just as ez extendsexto complex, we want the complex trigonometric functions to extend the familiar teal trigonometric functions.
The idea of making the connection is the use of the Euler formulas (Sec.2.6) eix = cosx+ isinx, e- ix = cosx- isinx.
By addition and subtraction we obtain 1 1 cosx= (eiz + e- iz), sinx= (eiz - e- iz) x real 2 2i This suggests the following definitions for complex values z = x+ iy 1 1 1. cosz = (eiz + e- iz), sinz = (eiz - e- iz).
2 2i Furthermore, in agreement with the definition from the real calculus we define sinz cosz 2. tanz = , cotz = cosz sinz and 1 1 3. secz = , cosecz = .
cosz sinz Sinceez is entire, cosz and sinz are entire functions.
tanz and secz are not entire; they are analytic except at the point where cosz is zero; and cotz 59MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III and cscz are analytic except, where sin z = 0.
Formulas for the derivatives follows readily from (ez)¢ = ezand (1)-(3); as in calculus, 4.
(cosz)¢ = - sinz, (sinz)¢ = cosz, (tanz)¢ = sec2 z, etc.
Equation (1) also shows that Euler’s formula is valid in complex: 5. eiz = cosz+ isinz for all z.
Real and imaginary parts of cosz and sinz are needed in computing values, and they also help in displaying properties of our functions.
We illustrate this by typical example.
Example 36 Real and Imaginary Parts.
Absolute Value.
Periodicity Show that (a) cosz = cosxcosh y - isinxsinh y 6.
(b) sinz = sinxcosh y+ icosxsinh y and 7.
(a) cos2 = cos2 x+ sinh2 y (b) sin 2 = sin2 x+ sinh2 y And give some application of these formulas.
Solution From (1) 1 cosz = (ei()x+iy + e- i(x+iy)) 2 1 1 = e- y(cosx+ isin y)+ ey(cosx- isin y) 2 2 1 1 = (ey + e- y)cosx- i(ey - e- y)sinx.
2 2 This yields (6a) since, as is known from calculus, 1 1 8. cosh y = (ey + e- y), sinhy = (ey - e- y); 2 2 60MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (6b) is obtained similarly.
From and cosh2 y =1+sin2 y we obtain cos2 = cos2 x(1+ sinh2 y)+ sin2 x+ sinh2 y. Sincesin2 x+ cos2 x=1, this gives (7a), and (7b) is obtained similarly.
For instance,cos(2+ 3icos2cosh3- isin2sinh3= - 4.190- 9.109i.
From (6) we see that cosz and sinz are periodic with period 2p , just as p in real.
Periodicity of tan z and cot z with period now follows.
Formula (7) points to an essential difference between the real and the complex cosine and sine: whereas cosx £ 1 and sinx £ 1, the complex cosine and sine function are no longer bounded but approach infinity in absolute value as yﬁ ¥ ,since tensinh yﬁ ¥ .
Example 37 Solution of Equations.
Zeros Solve (a) cosz = 5(which has no real solution), (b) cosz = 0 (c) sin z = 0 Solution (a) e2iz - 10eiz +1= 0from (1) by multiplication by eiz.
This is a quadratic equation in eiz, with solution (3D-values) eiz = e- y+ ix5– 25- 1= 9.899 and 0.101.
Thus e- y = 9.899 or 0.101, eix =1,y = – 2.292, x= 2np = – p – = (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) Ans.
z 2n 2.292i(n 0,1,2, ), can you obtain this by using (6a)?
(b) cosx= 0, sinh y = 0,by (7a), y = 0.
Ans.
z = – 1(2n+1)p (n= 0,1,2,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) )(cid:215).
2 (c) sinsx= 0, sinh y = 0,by (7b), y = 0.
Ans.
z = 2np (n= 0,1,2,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) )(cid:215).
Hence the only zeros of cosz and sinz are those of the real cosine and sine functions.
61MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III From the definition it follows immediately that all the familiar formulas for the real trigonometric functions continue to hold for complex values.
We mention in particular the addition rules cos(z – z )= cosz cosz – sinz sinz 9.
1 2 1 2 1 2 sin(z – z )= sinz cosz – sinz cosz 1 2 1 2 2 1 and the formula 10. cos2 z+sin2 z =1.
Some further useful formulas are inclined in the problem set.
HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS The complex hyperbolic cosine and sine are define by the formulas 11. coshz = 1(ez + e- z), sinhz = 1(ez - e- z).
2 2 This suggested by the familiar definition for the real variable.
These function are entire, with derivatives 12.
(coshz)¢ = sinhz, sinhz = coshz, as in calculus.
The other hyperbolic functions are defined by sinhz coshz tanz = , cothz = , coshz sinhz 1 1 13. sechz = , cschz = , coshz sinzh Complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are related.
If in (11), we replace z by iz and use (1), we obtain 14. coshiz = cosz, sinhiz = isinz, From this, since cosh is even and sinh is odd, conversely 15. cosiz = coshz, siniz = isinhz, Apart from their practical importance, these formulas are remarkable in principle.
Whereas in real calculus, the trigonometric and hyperbolic 62MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III functions are of a different character, in complex these functions are intimately related.
Moreover the Euler formula relates them to the exponential function.
This situation illustrates that by working in complex, rather than in real, one can often gain a deeper understanding of special functions.
This is one of the three main reasons of the practical importance of complex analysis, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
In the next section we discus the complex logarithms, which differ substantially from the real logarithm (which is simpler), and the student should work the next section with particular care.
4.0 CONCLUSION To this end, we conclude by giving a summary of what we have covered.

The most fundamental result in the whole unit is Cauchy’s integral theorem.
It implies, the importance of Cauchy integral formula.
We prove that if a function is analytic, it has derivatives of all orders.
Hence, in this respect, complex analytic functions behave much more simply than real-valued functions of real variables.
Interpretation by means of residues and applications to real integrals will be considered in Module 3.
2.0 OBJECTIVES Integration of complex plane is important for these two reasons which must be accomplished.
66MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III • in applications there occur real integrals that can be evaluated by complex integration, whereas the usual methods of real integral calculus are not successful; and • some basic properties of analytic function can be established by integration, but would be different to prove by other methods.
The existence of higher derivatives of analytic functions is a striking property of this type.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Line Integral in the Complex Plane As in real calculus, we distinguish between definite integrals, and indefinite integrals or antiderivatives.
An indefinite integral is a function whose derivative equals a given analytic function in a region.
By inverting known differentiation formulas we may find many types of indefinite integrals.
We shall now define definite integrals, or line integrals, of complex function f(z),wherez = x+iy.
This is needs a short preparation on curves in the complex plane, as follows Path of Integration In real calculus, a definite integral is taken over an interval (a segment) of the real line.
In the case of a complex definite integral we integrate along a curveC in the complex plane, which will be called the path of integration.
Now a curveCin the complex plane can be represented in the form z(t) = x(t)+ iy(t) (a £ t £ b) (1) wheretis a real parameter.
For example, z(t) = t + 3it (0£ t £ 2) represent a portion of the line y = 3x (sketch it!
), z(t) = 4cost + 4isint (-p £ t £ p ) represent the circle z = 4, etc.
(More example below) Cis called a smooth curve if Chas a derivative 67MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III dz z˙(t) = = x˙(t)+ iy˙(t) dt at each of its points which is continuous and nowhere zero.
Geometrically this means thatChas a continuous turning tangent.
This follow directly from the definition z(t+ D t)- z(t) z˙(t) = lim D tﬁ 0 D t Fig.
321: Tangent vector z(f) of a curve C in the complex plane given by z(f).
The arrow on the curve indicates the positive sense (sense of increasing f).
3.1.1 Definition of the Complex Line Integral This will be similar to the method used in calculus.
LetCbe a smooth curve in thez -plane represented in the form (1).
Let f(z)be a continuous function defined (least) at each point ofC.
We subdivided (“partition”) the interval (a £ t £ b)in (1) by points of Fig.
322: Complex Line Integral t (= a),t ,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) .t ,t (= b) 0 1 n- 1 n Where t < t < (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215)t .
To do this subdivision there corresponds a 0 1 n subdivision of Cby points 68MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III z ,z ,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) .z ,z (= z), 0 1 n- 1 n wherez = z(t ).
On each portion of subdivision ofCwe choose an j j arbitrary point, say, a pointx between z andz (that is, x = z(t) ) where 1 0 1 1 t satisfiest £ t £ t , a pointx betweenz andz (that is, x = z(t) ) where 0 1 1 0 1 1 t satisfiest £ t £ t , a pointx between z andz etc.
Then we form the 0 1 2 1 2 sum (cid:229) n S = f(x ) (2) n m m=1 where D z = z - z - 1. m m m This we do for each n =1,2,3,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) in a completely independent manner, but in such a way that the greatest D z approaches zero as n approaches m infinity.
This gives a sequence of complex numbersS ,S ,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) .
The limit 2 3 of these sequence is called the line integral (or simply the integral) of f(z),along the oriented curve Cand is denoted by (cid:242) f(z)dz (3) C The curveCis called the path of integration.Cis called a closed path if Z = z , that is, if its terminal point coincides with its initial point.
0 (Example: a circle, a curve shaped like an 8, etc.)
Then also writes (cid:242) (cid:242) instead of C C Examples follow in the next section.
General Assumption All path of integration for complex line integral will be assumed to be piecewise smooth, that is, to consist of finitely many smooth curves joined end to end.
3.1.2 Existence of the Line Integral From our assumption that f(z)is continuous andCis piecewise smooth, the existence of the line integral (3) follows, as in the previous chapter let us write f(z) = u(x,y)+ iv(x,y).
We also set x = x + ih and D z + iD y m m m m m then (2) may be written 69MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (cid:229) S = (u+ iv)(D x + iD y ) (4) n m m Where u = u(x ,h )andv = v(x ,h )we sum over m from1 to n. We m m m m may now split upS into four sums: n [ ] (cid:229) (cid:229) (cid:229) (cid:229) S = uD x - vD y + i uD y + vD x n m m m m These sums are real.
Since f is continuous, uandvare continuous.
Hence, if we letnapproach infinity in the aforementioned way, then the greatest D x and D y will approach zero and each sum on the right m m becomes a real line integral: [ ] limS = (cid:242) f(z)dz = (cid:242) udx- (cid:242) vdy+ i (cid:242) udy+ (cid:242) vdx (5) nﬁ ¥ n C C C C C This shows that under our assumption ( f continuous onCandC piecewise smooth) the line integral (3) exist and its value is independent x of the choice of subdivisions and intermediate points .
m 3.1.3 Three Basic Properties of Complex Line Integrals We list three properties of complex line integrals that are quite similar to those of real definite integrals (and real line integrals) and follow immediately from the definition.

Integration is a linear operation, that is, a sum of two (or more) functions can be integrated term by term, and constant factors can be taken out from under the integral sign: (cid:242) [k f (z)+ k f (z)]dz = k (cid:242) f (z)dz+ k (cid:242) f (z)dz (6) 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 C C C FIG.

Reversing the sense of integration, we get the negative of the original value: 70MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (cid:242) z f(z)dz = - (cid:242) z0 f(z)dz (8) z z 0 here the pathCwith endpointz andZ is the same; on the left we 0 integrate from z toZ , on the right fromz toZ .
0 0 Applications follow in the next section and problems at the end of it.
3.2 Two Integration Method Complex integration is rich in methods for evaluating integrals.
We discuss first two of them, and others will follow later in this chapter.
3.2.2 First Method: Use of Representation of the Path This method applies to any continuous complex function.
Theorem 1 (Integration by the use of the path) Let C be a piecewise smooth path, represented by z = z(t), where a £ t £ b Let f(z) be a continuous function on C. Then (cid:242) f(z) = (cid:242) b f[z(t)]z˙(t)dt (cid:231)(cid:230) i = dz(cid:247)(cid:246) (1) C a Ł dt ł Proof The left-hand side of (1) is given by (5), Sec, 13.1, in terms of real integrals, and we show that the right-hand side of (1) also equals (5).
[ ] We havez = x+iy, hencez˙ = x˙ + iy˙ .
We simply write u for u x(t),y(t) [ ] andvfor v x(t),y(t) .We also havedx = x˙dtanddy = y˙dt.
Consequently, in (1), (cid:242) b f[z(t)]z˙(t)dt = (cid:242) b(u+ iv)(x˙ + iy˙)dt a a = (cid:242) [udx- vdy+ i(udy+ vdx)], C Which is the right-hand side of (5), as claimed.
Steps in applying Theorem 1 A.
Represent the pathCin the formz(t) a £ t £ b B.
Calculate the derivative z˙(t) = dz dt C. Substitute z(t)for everyz in f(z)(hence x(t)for x andy(t)for y) 71MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III [ ] D. Integrate f z(t) z˙(t)overtfrom atob Example 1 A Basic Result: Integral of1 zaround the unit circle Show that (cid:242) dz = 2p i (Cthe unit circle, clockwise) (2) C z The important result will be frequently needed.
Solution We may represent the unit circle Cin the form z(˙t) = cost + isintz (0£ t £ 2p ).
So that the counterclockwise integration correspond to an increase oft from 0 to 2p .
By differentiation, z˙(t) = - sint + icost [ ] 1 Also f z(t) = .
Formula (1) now yields the desired result z(t) (cid:242) dz = (cid:242) 2p 1 (- sint + icost)dt C z 0 cost + isint = i(cid:242) 2p dt 0 = 2p i The Euler formula helps us to save work by representing the unit circle simply in the form z(t) = eit Then 1 e- it, dz = ieitdt.
z(t) As before, we now get more quickly (cid:242) dz = (cid:242) 2p e- itieit = i(cid:242) 2p dt C z 0 0 72MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III = 2p i.
Example 2 Integral of Integer Powers Let f(z) = (z- z )m where mis an integer and z is a constant.
0 0 r Integrate in the clockwise sense around the circleCof radius with centre atz 0 Solution We may represent the unit circle Cin the form z(t) = z + r (cost + isint) = z + r eitz (0£ t £ 2p ).
0 0 Then we have (z- z )m = r meimt, dz = ir eitdt, 0 and we obtain (cid:242) (z- z )mdz = (cid:242) 2p r meimtdt 0 0 C = (cid:242) 2p ei(m+1)tdt.
0 By the Euler formula (5), the right-hand side equals ir m+1Ø (cid:242) 2p cos(m+1)t + i(cid:242) 2p sin(m+1)tø .
Œº œß 0 0 When m = - 1,we haver m+1 =1,cos0=1,sin0= 0and thus obtain 2p i.
For integerm „ 1each of the two integer is zero because we integrate over an interval of length2p i, equal to a period of sine and cosine.
Hence the result is (cid:236) 2p i (m = -1) (cid:242) (z- z )mdz = (cid:237) C 0 (cid:238) 0 (m „ -1 and integer).
(3) Let us now illustrate the following important fact.
If we integrate a function f(z),from a pointz to a pointz along different path, we 0 1 generally get the values of the integral.
In other words, a complex line integral generally depends not only on the end point of the path but also on the geometric shape of the path.

1 2 Solution a.
C*can be represented byz(t) = t + it (0£ t £ 1).
Hence [ ] z˙(t)= +i and f z(t) = x(t) =1 (onC*).
We now calculate (cid:242) Rezdz = (cid:242) 1t(1+ i)dt C 0 1 = (1+ i).
2 b.
C can be represented byz(t) = t (0£ t £ 1).
Hence 1 [ ] z˙(t) =1 and f z(t) = x(t) =1 (onC ).
1 C can be represented byz(t) = t + it (0£ t £ 1).
Hence 2 [ ] z˙(t) =1 and f z(t) = x(t) =1 (onC ).

3.2.2 Second Method: Indefinite Integration 74MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III In real calculus, if for given f(x) we know anF(x)such that F¢(x) = f(x), then we can apply the formula (cid:242) b f(x)dx = F(b)- F(a) [F¢(x) = f(x).]
a This method extends to complex functions.
We shall see that it is simpler than the previous method, but, of course, we have to find an ¢ F(z)whose derivativeF (z)equals the given function f(z)that we want to integrate.
Clearly, differentiation formulas will often helps us in finding such anF(z), so that this method becomes of great practical importance.
Theorem 2 (Indefinite Integration of Analytic Functions) Let f(z)be analytic in a simply connected domainD.
Then there exists an indefinite integral of f(z)in the domainD, that is, an analytic function F(z)such that F¢(z)= f(z)inD, and for all path in Djoining two pointz andz in Dwe have 0 1 [ ] 4.
(cid:242) z1 f(x)dz = F(z )- F(z ) F¢(z)= f(z).
1 0 z 0 (Note that we can writez andz instead ofC, since we get the same value 0 1 for all thoseCfromz andz ).
0 1 This theorem will be proved by using Cauchy’s integral theorem which we discuss in the next section… Example 4 (cid:242) 1+iz3dz = 1z31+ i 0 3 0 1 2 2 = (1+i)3 = - + i 3 3 3 Example 5 (cid:242) p icoszdz =sinzp i - p i - p i = 2sinp i= 2isinhp = 23.097i Example 6 75MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (cid:242) 8- 3piez2dz =2ez2 8- 3p 8+3p i 8+ 3p = 2(e4- 3p i2 - e4+3p i2) = 0 Since ez is periodic with period 2p i.
Example 7 z2 Choosing F(z) = kz = ,we obtain from theorem 2 for any path fromz 0 2 andz .
1 3.2.3 Bound for Absolute Value of Integrals There will be a frequent need for estimating the absolute value of complex line integrals.
The basic formula is 6.
(cid:242) f(z)dz £ ML (ML-inequality); C here L is the length of C and M a constant such that f(z) £ M everywhere on C. Proof: We considerS as given by (2).
By the generalized triangle inequality n (6), we obtain (cid:229) n (cid:229) m S = f(x )D z £ f(x ) D z n m m m m m=1 m=1 (cid:229) n £ M D z .
m m=1 NowD z is the length of the chord whose endpoints arez andz .
m m- 1 m Hence the sum on the right represents the length L*of the broken line of the chord whose endpoints arez ,z ,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215),z (n= Z).
If n approaches 0 1 n infinity in such a way that the greatest D z approaches zero, then L* m approaches the length L of the curve C , by the definition of the length of a curve.
From this the inequality (6) follows.
We cannot see for (6) how close to the bound ML the actual absolute value of the integral is, but this will be no hardship in applying (6).
For the time being we explain the practical use of (6) by a simple example.
Example 8 76MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Find a upper bound for the absolute value of the integral (cid:242) z2dz, C the straight-line segment from 0 to 1+i C Solution L = 2 and f(z) = z2 £ 2on C gives by (6) (cid:242) z2dz £ 2 2 = 2.8284 C The absolute value of the integral is 2 2 2 - + i = 2 = 0.9428 3 3 3 In the next section we discuss the most important theorem of the whole chapter, Cauchy’s integral theorem, which is the basic in itself and has far reaching consequences which we shall explore, above all the existence of all higher derivatives of an analytic function, which are themselves analytic functions.
3.3 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem Cauchy’s integral theorem is very important in complex analysis and has various theoretical and practical co sequences.
To state this theorem, we shall need the following concepts.
A closed path C is called a simple close path if C does not intersect or touch itself (see diagram below).
For example a circle is simple, an eight- shaped curve is not.
A domain D in the complex plane is called a simply connected domain if every closed path in D encloses only points of D. A domain that is not simply connected is called multiply connected.
For instance, the interior of a circle (“circular disk”), ellipse or square is simply connected.
More generally, the interior of a simple closed curve is simply connected.
A circular ring or annulus is multiply connected 77MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (more precisely: doubly connected).
The figure below shows further examples.
Fig.
327: Simply and Multiply Connected Domain Recalling that, by definition, a function is a single-valued relation, we can now state Cauchy’s integral theorem as follows.
This theorem is sometimes also called the Cauchy-Gaursat theorem.
3.3.1 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem If f(z)be analytic in a simply connected domainD, then for every simple close path C in D, 1.
(cid:242) f(z)dz = 0 C Proof ¢ If we make assumption –as Cauchy did- that the derivative f (z)of f(z) ¢ is continuous in D (existence of f (z)in D being a consequences of analyticity), then Cauchy’s theorem follows from a basic theorem on real Fig.
328: Cauchy’s Integral Theorem line integrals (proof below).
Goursat finally proved Cauchy’s theorem ¢ without the assumption that f (z)is continuous (optional proof at the end 78MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III of this chapter).
Before we go into details, let us consider some example in order to really understand what is going on.
We mention that a closed path is sometimes called a contour and an integral over such a path a contour integral.
Example 9 (cid:242) ezdz = 0, (cid:242) coszdz = 0 (cid:242) zndz = 0 (n= 0,1,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) )(cid:215) C C C For any close path, since these functions are (analytic for all z).
Example 10 (cid:242) seczdz = 0, (cid:242) dz = 0 C C z2 + 4 1 where C is the unit circle.secz = is not analytic at cosz z = – p 2,– 3p 2,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) ,(cid:215) but all these point lie outside C ; none lie on C. Similarly for the second integral, whose integrand is not analytic at z = – 2p ioutside C. Example 11 (cid:242) zdz = 2p i C (C the unit circle, counterclockwise) does not contradict Cauchy’s theorem, since f(z)= z is not analytic, so that the theorem does not apply.
(Verify this result!)
Example 12 dz (cid:242) = 0, C z2 where C is the unit circle.
This result does not follow from the Cauchy’s 1 theorem, because f(z)= is not analytic atz = 0.
Hence the condition z2 that f be analytic in D is sufficient rather than necessary for (1) to be true.
Example 13 79MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III dz (cid:242) = 2p i, C z2 The integration being taken around the unit circle in the clockwise 1 3 1 sense.
C lies in the annulus < z < where is analytic, but this 2 2 z domain is not simply connected, so that Cauchy’s theorem cannot be applied.
Hence the condition that the domain D be simply connected is quite essential.
Example 14 7z- 6 3 4 (cid:242) dz = (cid:242) dz+ (cid:242) dz = 3(cid:215) 2p i+ 0 C z2 - 2z C z C z- 2 = 6p i (C the unit circle, counterclockwise) by partial fraction reduction.
¢ Cauchy’s proof under the condition that f (z)I continuous From (5) we have (cid:242) f(z)dz =(cid:242) (udx- vdy)+ (cid:242) (udy+ vdx).
C C C ¢ ¢ Since f(z)is analytic in D, its derivativeF (z)exists in D. Since F (z)is assume to be continuous, (4) and (5) in previous section imply that u and v have continuous partial derivatives in D. Hence Green’s theorem with u and –v instead ofF and F is applicable and gives 1 2 (cid:230) ¶ v ¶ u(cid:246) (cid:242) (udx- vdy) = (cid:242) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:242) - - (cid:247)(cid:247) dxdy C Ł ¶ x ¶ ył R where R is the region bounded by C. The second Cauchy-Rieman integration shows that the integrand on the right is identically zero.
Hence the integral on the left is zero.
In the same fashion it follows by the use of the first Cauchy-Rieman equation that the last integral in the above formula is zero.
This complete Cauchy’s proof.
3.3.2 Independence of Path, Deformation of Path We shall now discuss an important consequence of Cauchy’s integral theorem that has great practical interest, proceedings as follows.
If we subdivided the path, C in Cauchy’s theorem into two arcs C*and C , 1 2 then (1) takes the form 80MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (2¢) (cid:242) fdz+(cid:242) fdz = 0.
C C 1 2 Fig.
329: Formula (2’) Fig.
330: Formula (2) If we now reverse the sense of integration alongC*, then the integral 1 over C*is multiplied by -1.
Denoting C*with its new orientation byC 1 1 2 ¢ , we thus obtain from(6).
(cid:242) f(z)dz =(cid:242) f(z)dz.
2.
C C 2 1 Hence, if f is analytic in D, C*and C are any path in D joining two 1 2 points in D and having no further points in common, then (2) holds.
If those paths C*and C have finitely many points in common, then (2) 1 2 continues to hold.
This follow by apply previous result to the portion of C andC between each pair of consecutives point of intersection.
1 2 If it even true that (2) holds for any paths that join ant points z andz 1 2 and lie entirely in the simply connected domain D in which f(z)is analytic.
To express this we may say that the integral of f(z)is independent of path in D. (Of course the value of the integral depends on the choice of z andz .)
1 2 The proof may require additional consideration of the case in which C 1 andC have infinitely many points of intersection, and is not presented 2 here.
We may imagine that the pathC in (2) was obtained fromC by a 2 1 continuous deformation.
It follows that in a given integral we may impose a continuous deformation on the path of integration (keeping the endpoint fixed); as long as we do not pass through a point where 81MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III f(z)is not analytic, the value of the integral will not change under such deformation.
This is often called the principle of deformation of path.

The heavy curve in the figure shows the resulting deformed ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ path.
Then deformEEGAA andEGA .
There is more general systemic approach to problem of this kind, as we shall now see.
3.3.3 Cauchy Theorem for Multiple Connected Domains 82MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III A multiply connected domain D* can be cut so that so the resulting domain (that is, D* without the point of the cut or cuts) become simply connected.
~ For doubly connected domain D* we need one cut C(figure below).If f(z)is analytic in D* and at each point ofC andC then, sinceC ,C and C 1 2 1 2 bound a simply connected domain, it follows from Cauchy’s theorem ~ that the integral of f taken overC ,C,C in the sense indicated by the 1 2 ~ arrows in the figure has the value zero.
Since we integrate along Cin both directions, the corresponding integrals cancel out, and we obtain (3*) (cid:242) f(z)dz+(cid:242) f(z)dz = 0 C C 1 2 where one of the curve is traversed in the counterclockwise sense and the other in the opposite sense.
Reversing the sense of integration on one of the curves, we may write this Fig 334: Doubly Connected Domain Fig.
335: Paths in (3) 3.
(cid:242) f(z)dz+(cid:242) f(z)dz C C 1 2 where care now traversed in the same sense (the figure above).
We remember that (3) holds under the assumption that f(z)is analytic in the domain bounded byC andC and at each point of C andC .
1 2 1 2 Can you see how the result in Example (7) now follows immediately from our present consideration?
For more complicated domains we may need more than one cuts, but the basic idea remains the same as before.
For instance, for the triply connected domain in figure below, (cid:242) f(z)dz+(cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:242) f(z)dz = 0 C C C 1 2 3 whereC andC are traversed in the same sense and C is traversed in the 2 3 1 opposite sense.

0 In the next section, using Cauchy integral theorem, we prove the existence of indefinite integrals of analytic functions.
This will also justify our earlier method of indefinite integration.

It relates to Theorem 2 in section 3.2 on the evaluation of line integrals by indefinite integration and substitution of the limits of integration: 1.
(cid:242) z1 f(z)dz = F(z )- F(z ) [F¢(z) = f(z)], 1 0 z 0 WhereF(z)is an indefinite integral of f(z), that is F¢(z)= f(z), as indicated.
In most applications, such aF(z)can be found from differentiation formulas.
84MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Theorem 1 (Existence of an Indefinite Integral) If f(z)is analytic in a simply connected domain D, then there exists an indefinite integral F(z)of f(z)in D, which is analytic in D joining two points z andz in D, the integral of f(z) fromz andz can be evaluated 0 1 0 1 by formula (1).
Proof The conditions of Cauchy’s integral theorem are satisfied.
Hence the line integral of f(z)from z in D to any z in D is independent of path in 0 D. We keepz fixed.
Then this integral becomes a function of z, which 0 we denote byF(z): 2.
F(z) = (cid:242) z1 f(z*)dz*.
z 0 We show that thisF(z)is analytic in D and that F¢(z)= f(z).
The idea of doing this is as follows.
We form the differential quotient F(z+ D z)- F(z) = 1 Ø (cid:242) z+ D z f(z*)dz* - (cid:242) z+ D z f(z*)dz*ø D z D z Œº z z œß 0 0 = 1 (cid:242) z+ D z f(z*)dz*, D z z 0 Subtract f(z)from it and show that expression obtained approaches zero asD z ﬁ 0;this is done by using the continuity of f(z).
We now give the details.
Fig.
340: Path of Integration We keep z fixed.
Then we choosez+ D z in D. This is possible since D is a domain; hence D contains a neighborhood of z.
See figure above.
The segment we use as the path of integration in the previous formula.
We now subtract f(z).
This is a constant, since z is kept fixed.
Hence 85MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (cid:242) z+ D z f(z)dz* = f(z)(cid:242) z+ D zdz* = f(z)D z. z z Thus f(z) = 1 (cid:242) z+ D z f(z)dz* D z z This trick permits us to write a single integral: F(z+ D z)- F(z) - f(z) = 1 (cid:242) z+ D z[f(z*)- f(z)]dz* D z D z z 0 f(z)is analytic, hence continuous.
An є>0 being given, we can thus find a d > 0such that f(z*)- f(z) < є when z* - z < d Consequently, letting D z < d , we see that the ML-inequality yields F(z+ D z)- F(z) - f(z) = 1 (cid:242) z+ D z[f(z*)- f(z)]dz* £ 1 є D z = є; D z D z z D z 0 that is, by the definition of a limit and of the derivative, F(z+ D z)- F(z) F¢(z) = lim = f(z).
D z D z Since z is any point in D, this proves thatF(z)is analytic in D and is an indefinite integral or antiderivative of f(z)in D, written F(z) = (cid:242) f(z)dz.
Also, if G¢(z) = f(z), thenF¢(z)- G¢(z)” 0in D; henceF(z)- G(z)is constant in D. That is, two indefinite integrals of f(z).
This proves the theorem.
See section 3.2 for examples and problems on indefinite integration.
The theorem in this section followed from Cauchy’s integral theorem.
A much more fundamental consequence is Cauchy’s integral formula for evaluating integrals over close curves, which we discuss in the next section.
3.5 Cauchy’s Integral Formula The most important consequences of Cauchy’s integral theorem is Cauchy’s integral formula this formula is useful for evaluating integrals 86MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (example below).
More importantly, it plays a key role in providing the surprising fact that analytic function have derivative of all orders (see section 3.6), In establishing Taylor series representations and so on.
Cauchy’s integral formula and its conditions of validity may be stated as follows.
Theorem 1 (Cauchy’s Integral Formula) Let f(z)is analytic in a simply connected domain D. Then for any point z in D and any simple closed path C in D which encloses z (fig.
0 0 below), 1.
(cid:242) f(z) dz = 2p if(z ) (Cauchy’s integral formula) C z- z 0 0 The integration being taken in the counterclockwise sense.
Proof [ ] By addition and subtraction, f(z) = f(z )+ f(z)- f(z ).. We insert this 0 0 into (1) on the left and can take constant factor f(z )out from under the 0 integral sign.
Then f(z) dz f(z)- f(z ) 2.
(cid:242) dz = f(z )(cid:242) + (cid:242) 0 dz.
C z- z 0 C z- z C z- z 0 0 0 The first on the right hand equals f(z )(cid:215) 2p i(see Example 8 in sec.
3.3, 0 with m=-1).
This proves this theorem, provided the second integral on the right is zero.
This is what we are now going to show.
It’s integrand is analytic, except atz .
Hence by the principle of deformation of path 0 r (sec.
3.3) we replace C by a small circle K of radius and centre z 0 (figure below), without altering the value of the integral.
Since f(z)is analytic, it is continuous.
Hence, an є>0 being given, we can find a d > 0 such that f(z)- f(z ) < є for all z in the disk z- z < d 0 0 87MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Fig.
341: Cauchy’s Integral Fig.
342: Proof of Formula Cauchy’s Integral Formula Choosing the radiusr of k smaller thand , we thus have the inequality f(z)- f(z ) e 0 dz < z- z r 0 At each point of k. The length of k is 2pr .Hence by ML-inequality in sec.
3.2, f(z)- f(z ) e (cid:242) 0 dz < 2pr = 2pe .
K z- z r 0 Since є(>0) can be choosing arbitrarily small, it follows that the last integral on the right-hand side of (2) has the value zero, and the theorem is proved.
Example 17 Cauchy’s Integral Formula ez (cid:242) dz = 2p ez = 2p e2 C z- 2 z = 2 For any contour enclosing z = 2(sinceezis entire), and zero for any 0 contour for whichz = 2lies outside (by Cauchy’s integral theorem).

2 2i Solution To see what is going on, locate the point where g(z) is not analytic and sketch them along with the contours (figure below) .
These points are -1 and1.
We see that (b) will give the same result as (a), by the principle of deformation of path.
And (d) gives zero, By Cauchy’s integral theorem.
We consider (a) and afterward (c).

343: Example 3 Looking back, we point to a chain of basic results.
The beginning was Cauchy’s integral theorem in sec.
3.3.
From it followed Cauchy’s 89MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III integral formula (1) in this section.
From it follows the existence of all higher derivatives of an analytic function, in the next section.
This is the probably the most exciting link of our chain.
From it follows in the Taylor series for analytic functions.
3.6 Derivative of Analytic Functions From the assumption that a real function of a real variable is once differentiable, nothing follows about the existence of derivatives of higher order.
We shall now se that from the assumption that a complex function has a first derivative in a domain D, there follows the existence of derivative of all orders in D. This means that in this respect complex analytic functions behave much more simply than real functions that are once differentiable.
Theorem 1 (Derivative of Analytic Function) If f(z)is analytic in a domain D, then it has derivatives of all orders in D, which are then also analytic function in D. The value of these derivatives at a pointz in D are given by the formulas 0 1 f(z) (1¢) f¢(z ) = (cid:242) dz 0 2p i C (z- z )2 0 2!
f(z) (1¢¢) f¢¢(z ) = (cid:242) dz 0 2p i C (z- z )3 0 and in general n!
f(z) (1) f n(z ) = (cid:242) dz (n=1,2,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) )(cid:215); 0 2p i C (z- z )n+1 0 here C is any simple closed path in D that enclosesz and whose full interior 0 belongs to D; And we integrate counterclockwise around C(figure below).
Comment For memorizing (1), it is useful to observe that these formulas are obtained formally by differentiating the Cauchy formula (1), Sec.
3.5, under the integral sign with respect toz .
0 Proof of Theorem 90MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III ¢ We prove(1).
We start from the definition f(z + D z)- f(z ) f¢(z ) = lim 0 0 0 D zﬁ 0 D z On the right we represent f(z + D z)and f(z )by Cauchy’s integral 0 0 formula (1), sec.
3.5; the two integral we can combine into a single integral by taking the common denominator and simplifying the numerator (where z- z drops out and only f(z)D zremains): 0 f(z + D z)- f(z ) 1 Ø f(z) f(z) ø 0 0 = Œ (cid:242) dz- (cid:242) dzœ D z 2p iD z º C z- (z + D z) C z- z ß 0 0 1 f(z) = (cid:242) dz(cid:215) 2p iD z C(z- z - D z)(z- z ) 0 0 Fig.
345: Theorem 1 and its Proof Clearly, we can now establish(1¢) by showing that, as D z ﬁ 0,the integral ¢ on the right approaches the integral in (1).
To do this, we consider the difference between these two integrals.
We can write this difference as a single integral by taking the common denominator and simplifying.
This gives f(z) f(z) (cid:242) dz- (cid:242) dz C (z- z - D z)(z- z ) C (z- z )2 0 0 0 f(z) = (cid:242) dz C(z- z - D z)(z- z ) 0 0 We show by ML-inequality (Sec.
3.2) that this difference approaches zero asD z ﬁ 0,.
91MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Being analytic, the function f(z)is continuous on C , hence bounded in absolute value, say, f(z) £ K. Let d be the smallest distance fromz to 0 the points of C(see fig.
below).
Then for all z on C, z- z 2 ‡ d2, 0 hence 1 1 £ (cid:215) z- z 2 d2 0 Furthermore, if D z £ d 2,then for all z on C we also have d 1 2 z- z - D z ‡ , hence £ (cid:215) 0 2 z- z - D z d 0 Let L be the length of C. Then by ML-inequality, if D z £ d 2, f(z) 2 1 (cid:242) dz £ K D z (cid:215) (cid:215) C (z- z - D z)(z- z )2 d d2 0 0 This approaches zero as D z ﬁ 0,Formula(1¢)is proved.
Note that we used Cauchy’s integral formula (1), Sec.
3.5, but if all we had known about f(z )is the fact that it can be represented by (1), 0 Sec.
3.5, our argument would have established the existence of the ¢ derivative f (z )of f(z).This is essential to continuation and 0 ¢¢ completion of this proof, because it implies that(1 )can be proved by ¢ similar argument, with f replaced by f , and that the general formula (1) then follows by induction.

25 3.6.1 Moreras’s Theorem If f(z)is continuous in a simply connected domain D and if 2.
(cid:242) f(z)dz = 0 C for every closed path in D, then f(z)is analytic in D. Proof In sec.3.4 it was shown that if f(z) F(z)= (cid:242) z f(z*)dz* z 0 is analytic in D and F¢(z) = f(z).
In the proof we use only the continuity of f(z)and the property that its integral around every close path in D is zero; from the assumptions we concluded that F(z)is analytic.
By theorem 1, the derivative of F(z)is analytic, that is f(z)is analytic in D, and Morera’s theorem is proved.
Theorem 1 also yields a basic inequality that has many applications.
To get it, all we have to do is to choose for C in (1) a circle of radius r and centrez and apply ML-inequality (Sec.
3.2); with f(z)£ M on C we 0 obtain from (1) 93MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III n!

0 rn To gain first impression of the importance of this inequality, let us prove a famous theorem on entire functions (functions that are analytic for all z; cf.Sec.
2.6) 3.6.2 Liouville’s Theorem If an entire function f(z)is bounded in absolute value for all z, then f(z) must be a constant.
Proof By assumption, f(z) is bounded, say, f(z) < K for all z. Usind (3), we see that f¢(z ) < K /r.Since this is true for every r, we can take r as 0 large as we please and conclude that f ¢(z )= 0.
Sincez is arbitrary, 0 0 f ¢(z)= 0for all z, and f(z)is a constant.
This completes the proof.
This is the end of section on complex integration, which gave us a first impression of the methods that have no counterpart in real integral calculus.
We have seen that these methods result directly or indirectly from Cauchy’s integral theorem (Sec.3..3) More on integration follows in the next section.
In the next section, we consider power series, which play a great role in complex analysis, and we shall see that the Taylor series of calculus have a complex counterpart, so thatez, cosz,sinzetc.
have Maclaurin series that are quite similar to those in calculus.

We intend (may) use the formula for b for evaluating complex integrals in a very elegant and 1 simple fashion.b will be called the residue or f(z)at z = z .The 1 0 powerful method may also be applied for evaluation certain real integrals, as we shall see in section 3.3 and3.4 of Module 3 and unit 1 2.0 OBJECTIVES • to be able to determine and explain Residue; • to be able to use Residue to evaluate integrals; and • to show that the Residue integration method can be extended to the case of several singular points of f(z)inside C 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 97MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 3.1 Residues Let us first explain what a residue is and how it can be used for evaluating Integrals (cid:242) f(z)dz.
C There will be counter integral taken around a simple closed path C. If f(z)is analytic everywhere on C and inside C, such an integral is zero by Cauchy’s integral theorem and we are done.
If f(z)has a singularity at a pointz = z inside C, but is otherwise 0 analytic on C and inside, then f(z)has a Laurent series (cid:229) ¥ b b f(z) = a (z- z )n + 1 + 2 + (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) n 0 z- z (z- z )2 n=0 0 0 That converges for all points near z =z (except at z = z itself), 0 0 in some domain of the form 0< z = z < R.Snow comes the key idea.
0 1 The coefficient b of the first negative power of this Laurent 1 (z = z ) 0 series is given by the integral formula, with n=1, that is, 1 b = (cid:242) f(z)dz, 1 2p i C Since we can obtain Laurent series by various methods, without using the integral formulas for the coefficients, we can find b by one of these 1 methods and then use the formula for b for evaluating the integral: 1 1.
(cid:242) f(z)dz = 2p ib .
1 C Here we integrate in the counterclockwise sense around the simple closed path that contains z = z in its interior.
0 The coefficient b is called the residue of f(z)at z = z and we shall 1 0 denote it by 2. b = Res f(z) 1 z= z 0 98MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Example1 Evaluation of an Integral by Means of a Residue Integrate the function f(z) = z- 4around the unit circle C in the counterclockwise sense.

This series shows that f(z) has a pole of third order atz = 0and the residue of f(z)at z = 0is b = 1 !.
1 3 From (1) we thus obtain the answer sinz p i (cid:242) dz = 2p ib = - .
C z4 1 3 Example 2 Be Careful to use the right Laurent Series!
Integrate f(z) =1 (z3 - z4)around the circle C: z =1 2 in the clockwise sense.
Solution z3 - z4 = z3(1- z)Shows f(z) thatz = 0andz =1.
Nowz =1lies outside C. Hence it is of no interest here.
So we need the residue of f(z)at 0.
We find it from the Laurent series that converges for 0< z <1that 1 1 1 1 = + + +1+ z+ (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) 0< z <1 z3 - z4 z3 z2 z We see it from this residue is 1.
Clockwise integration thus yields dz (cid:242) = - 2p iRes f(z) = - 2p i C z3 - z4 z=0 Caution!

Explain!
3.1.1 Two Formulas for Residues at Simple Poles Before we continue the integration, we ask the following: To get a residue, a single coefficient of a Laurent series, must we divide the whole series or is there a more economical way?
For poles, there is.
We shall derive, once and for all, some formulas for residues at poles, so that in this case we no longer need the whole series.
Let f(z) have a simple pole atz = z 0 b f(z) = 1 + a + a (z- z )+ a (z- z )2 + (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) 0< z- z < R z- z 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 Here b = 0(why?)
Multiply both sides byz- z we have 1 0 [ ] (z- z )f(z) = b + (z- z )a0 + a (z- z )+ (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) 0 1 0 1 0 We now letz ﬁ z .
The right hand side approachesb .
This gives 0 1 Res f(z) = b = lim(z- z )f(z) (3) z= z 1 z= z 0 0 0 Example 3 Residue at a Simple Pole 9i+1 9i+1 Ø 9z+1 ø Res = lim(z- i) = Œ œ z= z z(z2 +1) z=i z(z+ i) º z(z+ i)ß 0 z=1 10i = = - 5i - 2 Another, sometimes simpler formula for the residue at a simple pole is obtained by starting from p(z) f(z) = q(z) with analytic p(z)andq(z)where we assume that p(z ) „ 0andq(z)has a 0 simple zero at z- z (so that f(z)has a simple pole at z- z ad wanted.
By 0 0 the definition of a simple zero, q(z) has a Taylor series of the form (z- z )2 q(z) = (z- z )q¢(z )+ 0 q¢¢(z )+ (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) 0 0 2!

Hence our second formula for the 0 residue at a pole is p(z) p(z ) Res f(z) = Res = 0 .

Hence f(z)has a simple pole at these points (and no further poles).

Multiplying both sides by(z- z )m, we have m 0 (z- z0)m f(z) =bm +bm- 1(z- z0)+(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) b2(z- z0)m- 2 +b1(z- z0)m- 1 + a (z- z )m + +a (z- z )m+1+(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) .

(z+ 4)(z- 12) z+ 4 z- 1 (z- 1)2 This shows that the residue t z = 1is 8 (as before),and at z=-4 (simple pole) it is -8.
Why is this so?
Considerz = 1.
There the Laurent has two fractions as its principal part and the first fraction as the sum of the other part.
This first fraction is analytic at z = 1, so that it has a Taylor series with centre z = 1, as it should be.
Similarly, at z=4 the first fraction is the principal part of the Laurent series.

In the next section we show that the residue integration method can be readily extended to the case of several singular points of f(z)insideC.
3.2 Residue Theorem So far we are in a position to evaluate contour integrals whose integrands have only a single isolated singularity inside the contour of integration.
We shall now see that our simple method may be extended to the case when the integrand has several isolated singularity inside the contour.
This extension is surprisingly simple, as follows Residue Theorem Let f(z)be a function that is analytic inside a simple closed pathCand on C, except for finitely many singular pointz ,z ,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) ,(cid:215)z insideC.

From the Cauchy’s integral 1 n theorem we have (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) +(cid:242) f(z)dz = 0 (2) C C C C 1 2 k the integral alongCbeing taken in the counterclockwise sense and the other integrals in the clockwise sense.
We now reverse the sense of integration alongC (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) C .
Then the signs of the values of these 1 n integrals change, and we obtain from (2) (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) +(cid:242) f(z)dz (3) C C C C 1 2 k All these integrals are now taken in the clockwise sense.
By (1) in the previous section (cid:242) f(z)dz = Res f(z), Cj z= zj So that (3) yields (1), and the theorem is proved.
This important theorem has various applications with complex and real integrals.
We shall first consider some complex integrals.

In the next section we discuss two methods for accomplishing this goal.
3.3 Evaluation of Real Integral We want to show that residue theorem also yields a very elegant and simple method for evaluating certain classes of complicated real integrals.
Integrals of Rational fractions of Cosq and Sinq We first consider integrals of the type I = (cid:242) 2p F(cosq ,sinq )dq (1) 0 106MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III where F(cosq ,sinq )is a real rational fraction ofCosq and Sinq [for example, (sin2q ) (5- 4cosq )and is finite on the interval of integration.
Settingeiq = z,we obtain 1 1(cid:230) 1(cid:246) cosq = (eiq + e- iq ) = (cid:231) z+ (cid:247) (2) 2 2Ł 2ł 1 1 (cid:230) 1(cid:246) sinq = (eiq - e- iq ) = (cid:231) z- (cid:247) 2i 2iŁ 2ł and we see that the integrand becomes a rational function of z, say, f(z) .
Asq ranges from0 to 2p , the variable z ranges once around the unit circle z =1in the counterclockwise sense.
Since we havedq = dz iz, and the given integral takes the form dz I = (cid:242) f(z) , (3) C iz The integration being taken counterclockwise around the unit circle.
Example 11 An Integral of the Type (1) Show by the present method that 0(cid:242) 2p dq = 2p 2 - cosq Solution dz We use cosq = (z+ 1 )anddq = .
Then the integral becomes z iz dz iz dz 2 dz (cid:242) = (cid:242) = (cid:242) C 2 + 1(cid:231)(cid:230) z+ 1(cid:247)(cid:246) Cc+ i (z2 + 2 2z +1) i C (z- 2 - 1)(z- 2 +1) 2Ł zł 2 We see that the integrand has two simple poles, one at z = 2+1,which 1 lies outside the unit circle.
C: z =1 and is thus of no interest, and the other at z = 2- 1inside C, where the residue is 2 107MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 1 Ø 1 ø 1 Res = Œ œ = - .
z= (z- 2 - 1)(z- 2 +1) º z- 2 - 1ß 2 z2 z= 2- 1 Together with the factor- 2 iin front of the integral this yields the desired result2p i(- 2/i)(- 1/2) = 2p 3.3.1 Improper Integrals of Rational Function We now consider the real integral of the type (cid:242) ¥ f(x)dx (4) - ¥ Such an integral, for which the interval of integration is not finite, is called an improper integral, and it has the meaning (cid:242) ¥ f(x)dx = lim (cid:242) 0 f(x)dx+ lim (cid:242) b f(x)dx.
(5a) - ¥ aﬁ -¥ a bﬁ -¥ 0 - ¥ If both limit exist, we may couple the two independent passages to ¥ and , and write (cid:242) ¥ f(x)dx = lim(cid:242) R f(x)dx (5b) - ¥ Rﬁ ¥ - R We assume that the function f(x)in (4) ia a real rational function whose denominator is different from zero for all real x and is of degree at least two units higher than the degree of denominator.
Then the limit in (5a) exists, and we may start from (5b).
We may consider the corresponding contour integral (cid:242) f(z)dz (5c) C Around a path C on the diagram below.
Since f(x)is rational, f(z)has finitely many poles in the upper-half plane, and if we choose R large enough, then Fig.
363: Path C of the Contour Integral in (5*) Cencloses all these poles .By the residue theorem we then obtain 108MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (cid:242) f(z)dz = (cid:242) f(z)dz+ (cid:242) R f(x)dx = 2p i(cid:229) Resf(z) C S - R When the sun consists of all the residues, of f(z)at the point in the upper half-plane at which f(z)has a pole.
From this we have (6) (cid:242) R f(x)dx = 2p i(cid:229) Res f(z)- (cid:242) f(z)dz - R S We prove thatRﬁ ¥ ,the value of the integral over the semicircle S approaches zero.
If we setz = R eiq ,then S is represented by R = const,and as z ranges along S, the variableq ranges from0 to p .Since, by assumption, the degree of the denominator of f(z)is at least two units higher than the degree of the numerator, we have k f(z) < (z = R> R ) z 2 0 for sufficiently large constantskandR .
By the ML-inequality 0 k kp (cid:242) f(z)dz < p R = (R> R ) S R2 R 0 Hence, asRapproaches infinity, the value of the integral over S approaches zero, and (5) and (6) yield the result (7) (cid:242) ¥ f(x)dx = 2p i(cid:229) Res f(z) - ¥ the sum being extended over the residues of f(z)corresponding to the poles of f(z)in the upper half-plane.
Example 12 ¥ An Improper Integral from 0 to Using (7), show that (cid:242) ¥ dx = p 0 1+ x4 2 2 Solution 1 Indeed, f(z) = has four simple poles at the points (1+ z4) 109MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III z ep i4, z e3p i4, z e- 3p i4, z e- p i4 1 2 3 4 The first two of these poles lie in the upper-half plane.

6 Looking back, we realize that the key ideas of our present methods were these.
In the first method we mapped the interval of integration on the real axis onto a closed curved in the complex plane (the unit circle).
In the second method we attached to an interval on the real axis a semi circle such that we got a closed curve in the complex plane, which we then “blew up.” This second method can be applied to further types of integrals, as we show in the next section, the last in the chapter.
3.4 Further Types of Real Integrals There are further classes of integrals that can be evaluated by applying the residue theorem to suitable complex integrals.
In application suchintegral may arise in connection with integral transformations or representation of special functions.
In the present section we shall consider two such classes of integrals.
One of them is important in the problems involving the Fourier integral representation.
The other class consists of real integral whose integrand is finite at some point in the interval of integration.
3.4.1 Fourier Integral Real integral of the form 1.
(cid:242) ¥ f(x) = cossxdx and (cid:242) ¥ f(x)= sinsxdx (s real) - ¥ - ¥ occur in connection with the Fourier integral.
If f(x)is a rational function satisfying the assumptions on the degree stated in connection with (4), then the integral (1) may be evaluated in a 111MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III similar to that used for the integral in (4) of the previous section.
In fact, we may then consider the corresponding integral (cid:242) f(z)eiszdz (s real and positive) C Over the contourCin sec 3.3 instead of (7), sec.
3.3, we get [ ] (cid:242) ¥ f(z)eiszdz = 2p i(cid:229) Res f(z)eisz (s > 0) (2) - ¥ where the sum consists of the residue of f(z)eiszas its pole in the upper half-plane.
Equating the and imaginary parts on both sides of (2), we have [ ] (cid:242) ¥ f(x)cossxdx = - 2p i(cid:229) ImRes f(z)eisz , (s > 0) (3) - ¥ [ ] (cid:242) ¥ f(x)sinsxdx = 2p i(cid:229) ReRes f(z)eisz - ¥ We remember that (7), was established by proving that the value of the integral over the semicircle S in fig.
approaches zero as R ﬁ ¥ .
To establish (2) we should now prove the same fact for our present contour integral.
This can be done as follows, Since S lies in the upper half-plane y‡ 0and s > 0, we see that eisz = eisx e- isy = e- sy £ 1 (s > 0, y‡ 0) From this obtain the inequality f(z)eisz =) = f(z eisz £ f(z (s > 0, y‡ 0) which reduces our present problem to that in previous section.
Continuing as before, we see that the value of the integral under consideration approaches zero as R approaches infinity.
This establishes (2), which implies (3).
Example 14 An Application of (3) Show that (cid:242) ¥ cossx dx = p eks, (cid:242) ¥ sinsx dx = 0 (s > 0, k > 0) - ¥ k2 + x2 k - ¥ k2 + x2 Solution 112MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III eisz In fact, has only one pole in the upper plane, namely, a simple k2 + x2 pole at z = ik , and from (4) we obtain eisz Ø eisz ø Ø e- ks ø Res = Œ œ = Œ œ .
z=ik k2 + z2 º 2z ß º 2ik ß z=ik Therefore, (cid:242) ¥ eisz dx = 2p ie- ks = p eks.
- ¥ k2 + z2 2ik k Since eisx = cossx+ isinsx,this yields the above results 3.4.2 Types of Real Improper Integrals Another kind of improper integral is a definite integral (cid:242) B f(x)dx (4) A whose integral becomes infinite at a point ain the interval of integration, lim f(x) = ¥ xﬁ a Then the integral (4) means (cid:242) Bf(x)dx = lim(cid:242) a- t f(x)dx+ lim(cid:242) B f(x)dx (5) A t ﬁ a A h ﬁ 0 a+h t h where and approaches zero independently and through positive values.
It may happen that neither of these limits exists, if t ,h ﬁ 0 independently, but limØ (cid:242) a- t f(x)dx+ (cid:242) B f(x)dxø (6) Œº œß t ﬁ 0 A a+h exists.
This is called the Cauchy principal value of the integral.
It is written (cid:242) B pv.v.
f(x)dx.
A For example, pv.v.
(cid:242) 1 dx = limŒØ (cid:242) - t dx + (cid:242) 1dxœø = 0 - 1x3 t ﬁ 0º - 1 x3 t x3ß 113MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III the principal value exists although the integral itself has no meaning.
The whole situation is quite similar to that discussed in the second part of the previous section.
To evaluate improper integral whose integrands have poles on the real axis, we use a part that avoids these singularities by following small semi-circles at the singular points; the procedure maybe illustrated by the following example.
Example 15 An Application Show that (cid:242) ¥ sinxdx = p .
0 x 2 (This is the limit of sine integral Si(x) as xﬁ ¥ ) Solution (sinz) a.
We do not consider because this function does not behave z eiz suitably at infinity.
We consider , which has a simple pole at z=0, z eiz and integrate around the contour in figure below.
Since is analytic z inside and on C Cauchy’s integral theorem gives eiz (cid:242) dz = 0 (7) C z b.
We prove that the value of the integral over the large semicircleC 1 approachesRas approaches infinity.
Setting dz z = R eiq .dz = iR eiq dq , and therefore z = idq (cid:242) eiz dz = (cid:242) p eizidq £ (cid:242) p eiz dq (z = R eiq ) C z 0 0 In the integrant on the right, eiz = eiR(cosq +isinq ) = eiRcosq e- Rsinq = e- Rsinq .
114MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III We insert this, sin(p - q ) = sinq to get an integral from0 to p 2, and then v ‡ 2q p (when0£ q £ p 2); to get an integral that we can evaluate: Fig.
365: Contour in Example 2 Fig.
366: Inequality in Example 2 (cid:242) p eiz dq = (cid:242) p e- Rsinq dq = (cid:242) p 2e- Rsinqdq dq 0 0 0 p < 2(cid:242) p 2e- 2Rq p dq = (1- e- R)ﬁ 0 as R ﬁ ¥ C 0 R 1 Hence the value of the integral over C approaches as R ﬁ ¥ 1 c. For the integral over small semicircle C in figure above , we have 2 eiz dz eiz - 1 (cid:242) dz = (cid:242) + (cid:242) dz C z C z C z 2 2 2 The first integral on the right equals- p i.
The integral of the second integral is analytic and thus bounded, say, less than some constant M in absolute value for all z onC and between C and 2 2 the x-axis.
Hence by the ML- inequality, the absolute value of this integral cannot exceedMp r .
This approachesr ﬁ 0.
Because of part (b), from (7) we thus obtain 115MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III (cid:242) eizdz = pv.v.
(cid:242) ¥ eix dx+ lim(cid:242) eizdz C2 z - ¥ x rﬁ 0 C2 z = pv.v.
(cid:242) ¥ eix dx- p i = 0 - ¥ x Hence this principal value equalsp i; its real part is 0 and its imaginary part is pv.v.
(cid:242) ¥ sinxdx = p (8) - ¥ x d. Now the integrand in (8) is not singular at x = 0.
Furthermore, Since for positive xthe function 1 x decreases, the area under the curve of the integrand between two consecutive positive zeros decreases in a monotone fashion, that is, the absolute value of the integrals I = (cid:242) np +p sinxdx n = 0,1,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) n np x From a monotone decreasing sequence, I , I ,(cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) and I ﬁ 0as nﬁ ¥ .
1 2 n Since these integrals have alternating sign (why?
), it follows from the Leibniz test that the infinite seriesI + I + I + (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) converges.
Clearly, 0 1 2 the sum of the series is the integral (cid:242) ¥ sinxdx = lim(cid:242) bsinxdx 0 x bﬁ ¥ 0 x - ¥ which therefore exists.
Similarly the integral from 0 to exists.
Hence we need not take the principal value in (8), and (cid:242) ¥ sinxdx = p - ¥ x Since the integrand is an even function, the desired result follows.
In part (c) of example 2 we avoided the simple pole by integrating along a small semicircleC , and then we let C shrink to a point.
This process 2 2 suggests the following.
3.4.3 Simple Poles on the Real Axis If (z) has a simple pole at z = a on the real axis, then lim(cid:242) f(z)dz = p iResf(z).
rﬁ 0 C2 z= a 116MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Fig.
367: Theorem 1 Proof By the definition of a simple pole the integrand f(z)has at z = athe Laurent series b f(z) = 1 + g(z), b = Res f(z) z- a 1 z=a where g(z)is analytic on the semicircle of integration C :z = a+ reiq , 0£ q = p 2 and for allz between C and the x-axis.
By integration, 2 (cid:242) f(z)dz = (cid:242) p b1 ireiq dq + (cid:242) g(z)dz C 0 reiq C 2 2 The first integral on the right equals- bp i.The second cannot exceed 1 Mp r in absolute value, by the ML-inequality and Mp r ﬁ 0as r ﬁ 0.
We may combine this theorem with (7) or (3) in this section.
Thus, pv.v.

This is the end of unit 1, which added another powerful general integration method to the methods discussed in the chapter on integration.
Remember that our present residue method is based on Laurent series, which we therefore had to discuss first.
In the next chapter we present a systemic discussion of mapping by analytic functions (“conformal mapping”) .Conformal mapping will then be applied to potential theory, our last chapter on complex analysis.
4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, haven run through this unit we have seen that our simple method have been extended to the case when the integrand has several 117MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III isolated singularities inside the contour.
We also proof the Residue theorem.

The integral transform method is given by F(p) = (cid:242) b f(x)k(x,r )dx a With the inverse, (cid:229) b f(x) = F(p)H(x,r ) p=a F(r )is the integral transform of f(x)and k(x,r ) is called the kernel of the transformation 121MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 2.0 OBJECTIVES • to be able to state various form of integral transform; • state Fourier Sine series and Fourier Cosine series; • apply Fourier transform to solve some fourth, third and second order differential equations; and • to develop techniques and methods through transformation or along with transform to be able to solve physical and mechanical problems (vibrations).
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Integral Transform Let f(x) be a function defined in the intervala£ x£ b i.e.
f(x) is defined onx-space.
Letk(x,r )be a functionxof and some parameterr .
Then the integral transform method is given by, F(p) = (cid:242) b f(x)k(x,r )dx (1) a F(r )is called an integral transform of f(x)andk(x,r )is called the kernel of the transform Symbolically, F = Tf (2) whereT is an integral operator which means multiply what followsT by k(x,p)and integrate the product with respect toxbetween the limit of 'a' and'b'.The new functionF(r )can be regarded as the image of f(x) produced byT .
F(p)is defined on p-space/image-space.
For integral transform to be a useful concept, it is necessary that there should exist an inverse operatorT- 1which yields a uniqueF(t) from a givenF(r ).
From equation (2) we have that: f = T- 1(F) (3) Finding the operatorT- 1is equivalent to solving equation (1) regardless an integral equation for f(t) f(t) = (cid:242) b F(r )H(r ,x)dr (4) a 122MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III i.e.
F(t)is an integral transform ofF(r )with kernelH(r ,x).
A specification of theT- 1 operator ass in equation (4) is know as Inversion Theorem.

We say a function y = g(x) is said to be even if g(- x)= g(x) for all x.
(26) While a function h(x)is said to be odd if h(- x) = - h(x) for all x.
(27) However, it worth mentioning here that the functioncosnxis even, while the function sinnxis odd.
If g(x)is an even function, then (cid:242) L g(xdx) = 2(cid:242) Lg(x)dx.

(34) Similarly, the Fourier series of an odd function f(x)of period2p is a Fourier sine series.

The process of solution consists of three main steps: In this way the laplace transformation reduces the problem of solving a differential equation to an algebraic problem.
The laplace transform is the most important method used – solving engineering mathematics.
2.0 OBJECTIVES Our objective is to undergo the three main steps of solving initial and boundary value problem.
• the given hard problem is to be transformed into a simple equation; • the simple equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations; and • the solution of the simple equation t be transformed back to obtain the solution to the given hard problem.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 141MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 3.1 The Classical Laplace Transform Let f be a function of the real variable t which is defined for all t ‡ 0 and which is either continuous or at least sectionally continuous.
The classical Laplace Transform † of f is the function F (s) defined by the formula 0 ¥ F (s) ” ℓ{f(t)} = ∫ e-st f(t) dt.
(1) 0 0 This definition of F (s) clearly makes sense only for those values of s for 0 which the infinite integral is convergent.
For many applications it is enough to regard s as a real parameter, but in general it should be taken s as complex, say s = +iω.
Thus F (s) is really a function of a complex 0 variable defined over a certain region of the complex plane; the region of definition comprises just those values of s for which the infinite integral exists.
3.1.1 Elementary Applications of the Laplace Transform Depend Essentially on Three Basic Properties i. Linearity.
If the Laplace Transforms of f and g are F (s) and 0 G (s) respectively, and if a and a are any (real) constants, then 0 1 2 the Laplace Transform of the function h defined by is h(t) = a f(t) + a g(t) 1 2 H (s) = a F (s) + a G (s).

Transform of a Derivative.
If f is differentiable (and therefore continuous) for f ‡ 0, then = sF0(s) – f(0).
(3) Proof Using integration by parts we have ¥ [ ] ℓ[f'(t)] = (cid:242) e- st f(t)dt = e- st f(t) ¥ se- st f(t)dt 0 0 ¥ = - f(0) + s (cid:242) e- st f(t)dt 0 Since lim e-stf(t) = 0 Corollary.
If f is n-times differentiable for t ‡ 0, then 142MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III ℓ [f(n)(t)] = snF (s) – sn – 1f(0) – sn – 2 f'(0) …….. – f(n- 1)(0).
0 iii.
The Convelution Theorem.
Let f and g have Laplace Transforms F (s) and G (s) respectively, and define h as follows: 0 0 t H(t) = (cid:242) f(t )g(t - t )dt , t‡ 0.
0 Then, ℓ [h(t)] = F (s)G (s).
(4) 0 0 (Recall that h, as defined here, is the convolution of the functions u(t)f(t) and u(t)g(t).
If f and g happen to be functions which vanish identically for all negative values of t then the above result can be expressed in the form: The Laplace transform of the convolution of f and g is the product of the individual Laplace Transform.
Proof The Laplace Transform of h is given by Ø t ø H (s) = (cid:242) ¥ e- stŒ (cid:242) f(t )g(t - t )dt œ dt.
0 0 º 0 ß Now, t ¥ (cid:242) f(t )g(t - t )dt = (cid:242) f(t )g(t - t )u(t - t )dt 0 0 t t t because u(t - ) = 1 for all such that < t t t t and u(t - ) = 0 for all such that > t. Hence ¥ Ø ¥ ø H (s) = (cid:242) e- stŒ (cid:242) f(t )g(t- t )u(t - t )dt œ dt.

Thus, ¥ Ø ¥ ø H (s) = (cid:242) f(t )Œ (cid:242) g(t - t )e- stdtœ dt .

0 0 º 0 ß t Since T = 0 when t = .
That is, ¥ ¥ H (s) = (cid:242) f(t )e- stdt (cid:242) g(T)e- sTdT = F (s)D (s).
0 0 0 0 0 Remark The change in the order of integration in the proof given above is justified by the absolute convergence of the integrals concerned.
3.1.2 Applications of Laplace The most immediate application of these properties is in the solution of ordinary differential equations with constants.
Consider the case of the general second-order equation d2y dy a + 2b + cy = f(t) (5) dt2 dt a b Where y(0) = and d'(0) = .
If ℓ[y(t)] = Y (s) then 0 (cid:236) dy(cid:252) (cid:236) d2y(cid:252) ℓ(cid:237) (cid:253) = sY (s) - a , and ℓ(cid:237) (cid:253) = 2Y0(s) - a s - b .
(cid:238) dt(cid:254) 0 (cid:238) dt2 (cid:254) Taking Laplace Transforms of both sides of (5.5) therefore gives a[s2Y (s) - a s - b ] + 2b [sY (s) - a ] + cY (s) = F (s).
0 0 0 0 That is, F (s) aa s+ (ab + 2ba ) Y (s) = 0 + (6) 0 as2 + 2bs+ c as2 + 2bs+ c Y (s) is thus given explicitly as a function of s, and what remains is an 0 inversion problem; that is to say we need to determine a function y(t) whose Laplace Transform is Y (s).
The question of uniqueness which 0 naturally arises at this point is not, in practice, a serious problem.
In brief, if y and y are any two functions which have the same Laplace 1 2 Transform Y (s), then they can differ in value only on a set of points 0 which is (in a sense which can be made precise) a negligibly small set.
In fact we have the following situation: ¥ (cid:242) if ℓ[y (t)] = ℓ[y (t)] then |y (t) – y (t)| dt = 0.
1 2 0 1 2 144MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III With this proviso in mind, we admit the slight abuse of notation involved, and write: (cid:236) F (s) (cid:252) (cid:236) aa s+ (ab + 2ba (cid:252) y(t) ” ℓ- 1[Y (s)]= ℓ- 1(cid:237) 0 (cid:253) + ℓ- 1(cid:237) (cid:253) (7) 0 (cid:238) as2 + 2bs+ c(cid:254) (cid:238) as2 + 2bs+ c (cid:254) where y is define for all t > 0.
A more serious problem from the practical point of view is that of implementing the required inversion; that is, of division effective procedures which allow us to recover a function f(t) given its Laplace Transform F (s).
in a large number of commonly occurring cases this 0 can be done by expressing F (s) as a combination of standard functions 0 of s whose inverse transforms are known .
Note that with zero initial conditions, (y(0) = y'(0) = 0), the differential equation (5) can be regarded as representing a linear time-invariant system which transforms a given input signal f into a corresponding output y.
This output function y is the particular integral associated with f and, using the Convolution Theorem, it can be expressed in terms of the appropriate impulse response function characterizing the system: t Y(t) = (cid:242) f(t )h (t - t )dt = ℓ- 1[F (s)H 0 1 0 0 Where ¥ (cid:242) 1 H (s) = e-sth(t) dt = 0 0 as2 + 2bs+ c Non-zero initial conditions correspond to the presence of stored energy in the system at time t = 0. the response of the system to this stored energy is independent of the particular input f and is given by the complementary function.
The complete solution (valid for all t > 0) of the equation (5) can be written in the form.
Y(t) = ℓ- 1[F (s)H (s)]+ ℓ- 1[aa s+ (ab + 2ba )]H (s)].
(8) 0 0 0 In applying the classical Laplace transform technique to (5) we are tacitly assuming that the system which it is being taken to represent is unforced for t < 0; that is, that the response which we compute from (5) is actually the response to the excitation f(t)u(t).
This is sometimes expressed by saying that the input is suddenly applied at time t = 0.
3.2 Laplace Transforms Of Generalized Functions If a is any positive number then there is no specialty in extending the definition of the classical, one-sided, Laplace Transform to apply to the case of a delta function located at t = a, or to any of its 145MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III derivatives located there; for a direct application of the appropriate sampling property gives immediately ¥ ℓ{d (t)}= ℓ{d (t - a)}= (cid:242) e- std (t - a)dt = e- sa (9) a 0 ¥ Ø d ø ℓ{d '(t- a)}= (cid:242) e- std '(t - a)dt = - Œ (e- st)œ = se- sa (10) 0 º dt ß t= a and so on Now take the case of a function f defined by a relation of the form f f f(t) = (t)u(a-t) + (t)u(t – a) (11) 1 2 f f where a > 0, and and are continuously differentiable functions.
1 2 Using the notation f'(t) = f '(t)u(a – t) + f '(t)u(t – a) (for all t „ a) 1 2 and Df(t) = f ' (t)u(a – t) + f '(t)u(a – t) + [f (a) - f (a)]d (t – a) 1 2 2 1 ” f '(t)+[f(a+)- f(a- )]d (t- a).
(12) Using integration by parts to evaluate the Laplace integral we have ¥ a ¥ (cid:242) e-stf'(t)dt = (cid:242) f '(t)e-stdt + (cid:242) f '(t)e-stdt 0 0 1 0 2 ¥ ¥ Ø ø Ø ø = Œ e- stf (t)œ + s(cid:242) a f 19t)e-stdt + Œ e- stf (t)œ (cid:242) ¥ f (t)e-stdt Œ 1 œ 0 Œ 2 œ a 2 Œ œ Œ œ º ß º ß a a = sŒØ (cid:242) af (t)e- stdt + (cid:242) ¥ f (t)e- stdtœø - e- as[f (a)- f (a)]- f (0) º 0 1 a 2 ß 2 1 1 [ ] ” sF (s)- f(0)- e- as f(a+)- f(a- ) (13) o so that a modification of the derivative rule is required when we adhere to the classical meaning of the term “derivative” in the case of discontinuous functions.
On the other hand, form (12) we get ¥ ¥ (cid:242) (cid:242) e-st[Df(t)]dt = e-stf'(t)dt + [f(a+) – f(a-)] e-as 0 0 = sF (s) – f(0) (14) 0 and the usual form of the derivative rule continues to apply.
146MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III The result (13) makes sense even when we allow a to tend to zero, for then we get ¥ ¥ ℓ[f'(t)] = (cid:242) f '(t)e-stdt = s(cid:242) f (t)e-stdt - f (0) 0 2 0 2 2 = sF (s) – f(0+).
(15) 0 However, a complication arises with regard to ℓ[Df(t)] when a = 0.
If we have f f then f(t) = (t)u(-t) + (t)u(t) 1 2 Df(t) = f '(t)u(-t)+ [f (0) - f (0)]d (t) 1 2 1 and so, ℓ[Df(t)] = ℓ[f '(t)] + [f (0) - f (0)] ℓ[d (t)] 2 2 1 = sℓ[f (t)] - f (0) + [f (0) - f (0)] D (s) 2 2 2 1 ” sF (s) – f(0 +) + [f(0+)– f(0 -)] D (s).
(16) 0 The difficulty is that, as remarked in Sec.
4.5, the Laplace Transform of the delta function (which we have denoted by D (s)) is not defined by the Laplace integral ¥ + ¥ (cid:242) e-std (t)dt = (cid:242) e-stu(t) d (t)dt.
0 - ¥ The role of the delta function as a (generalized) impulse response function suggests that we should have D (s) = 1 for all s, and this is the definition most usually adopted.
However the discussion on the significance of the formal product u(t)d (t) shows that there are grounds 1 for taking D (s) = , for all s; other values for D (s) have also at the 2 issue cannot be resolved simply by an appeal to the definition of d as a limit, nor by means of the formulation as a (Riemann) Stieltjes integral.
In the latter case, for example, we have for an arbitrary continuous integrand f ¥ (cid:242) f(t)du (t) = (1 – c)f(0) (17) 0 c We could therefore obtain D (s) ” 1 by choosing c = 0 or, equally well, 1 1 D (s) ” by choosing c = .
Whatever value we choose for D (s) the 2 2 relation (16) is bond to be consistent with the behaviour of d as the derivative of the unit step function u. for, since 147MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III ¥ (cid:242) ℓ[u(t)] = e-stdt = 1/s, 0 We have (cid:230) 1(cid:246) ℓ[u'(t)] = [s(cid:231) (cid:247) - u(0 + )] + D (s)[u(0+) – u(0-)] Ł sł = (1 – 1) + D (s) (1 – 0) = D (s).
On the other hand care must be taken to ensure that the correct form of (16) is used when a specific definition of D (s) has been decided on.
Thus, for D (s) = 1 we get ℓ[Df(t)] = sF (s) – f(0 - ) 0 = sF (s) (18) 0 Whenever f(t) = 0 for all t < 0.
1 But for D (s) = the result becomes 2 1 ℓ[Df(t)] = sF (s) - [f(0+) + f(0 -)].
0 2 In what follows we shall adopt the majority view and define D (s) to be 1 for all values of s. Similarly we shall take the Laplace Transform of d ' to be s; the analogue of (19) then becomes ℓ[D2f(t)] = s2F (s) – sf(0-) – f'(0-) (19) 0 = s2F (s) 0 whenever f(t) = 0 for all t < 0.
The convenience of these definitions is readily illustrated by the following derivation of the Laplace Transform of a periodic function: Let f be a function which vanishes identically outside the finite interval (0,T).
The periodic extension of f, of period T, is the function obtained by summing the translates, f(t – kT), for k = 0, – 1, – 2,…., (see fig.
5.1) +¥ (cid:229) f (t) = f(t - kT) (20) T k= -¥ 148MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Fig.
5.1 We can write f as a convolution: T +¥ +¥ (cid:229) (cid:229) f (t) = [f(t)* d (t- kT)]= f(t)* d (t - kT).
(21) T k= -¥ k= -¥ further, using he above definition of D (s), we obtain Ø +¥ ø Ø ¥ ø (cid:229) (cid:229) ℓŒ d (t - kT).œ = ℓŒ d (t - kT).œ º ß º ß k= -¥ k=¥ 1 = 1 + e-sT + e-2sT + e-3sT + … = (22) 1- e- sT The summation being valid provided that |e-sT| = |e-(e- a + iw )T | e- a T< 1, That is, for all s such that Re(s) > 0.
Hence, appealing to the Conclusion Theorem for the Laplace transform, (21) and (22) together yield Ø (cid:229)+¥ ø F (s) ℓŒ d (t - kT).œ = 0 (23) º ß 1- e- sT k= -¥ 149MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III 3.3 Computation of Laplace Transforms If f is an ordinary function whose Laplace Transform exists (for some values of s) then we should be able to find that transform, in principle at least, by evaluating directly the integral which defines F (s).
It is usually simpler in practice to make use of certain 0 appropriate properties of the Laplace integral and to derive specific transforms from them.
The following results are easy to establish and are particularly useful in this respect: (L.T.I) The first Translation Property.
If ℓ[f(t)] = F (s), and if a is any 0 real constant, then ℓ[eatf(t)] = F (s – a).
0 L.T.2) The Second Translation Property.
If ℓ[f(t)] = F (s), and if a is 0 any positive constant, then ℓ[u(t – a)f(t – a)] = e-asF (s).
0 (L.T.3) Change of Scale.
If ℓ[f(t)] = F (s), nd if a is any positive 0 constant, then 1 (cid:230) s(cid:246) ℓ[f(at)] = F (cid:231) (cid:247) .
a 0Ł ał (L.T.4) Multiplication t. If ℓ[f(t)] = F (s), then 0 d ℓ[tf(t)] = - F (s) ” - F'(s).
ds 0 0 (L.T.5) Transform of an Integral.
If ℓ[f(t)] = F (s), and if the function 0 g is defined by t (cid:242) t t g(t) = f( )d 0 then 1 ℓ[g(t)] = F (s).
0 s The fist three of the above properties follow immediately on making suitable changes of variable in the Laplace integrals concerned.
For (L.T.4) we have only to differentiate with respect to s under the integral sign, while in the case of (L.T.5) it is enough to note that g'(t) = f(t) and that g(0) = 0; the result then follows from the rule for finding the 150MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL METHODS III Laplace Transform of a derivative.
Using these properties, an elementary basic table of standard transforms can be constructed without difficulty (Table 1).
This list can be extended by using various special techniques.
In particular the results for the transforms of delta functions derived in the preceding section are of considerable value in this connection.
