Called ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ in Arabic, the course is compulsory for the NOUN Diploma students.
As a beginner, you should take note of the development and the importance of ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ.
In the first and second centuries of Islam, ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ was developed amongst the series of subjects developed by Muslims to preserve and understand the language of the Qur’an – Arabic.
Mu’adh bn Muslim al –Ħarrāī is recognized as the exponent of ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ.
Another school of thought attributes its development to ‘Alī bn Abī Tālib.
So far, ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ has proven to be an extraordinary mechanism of enriching Arabic language as you will see it practically as we enter into the nitty-grity of ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ Course Aims ARA012 aims at ensuring your ability to: • comprehend the position of ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ in the entire Arabic Studies; • identify the scope ofٌﻑْﺮَﺻ ; • employ the available mechanism to conjugate verbs and nouns; • state the relationship between ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ and ٌﻮـْﺤَﻧ and • employ various available patterns in ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ to enrich your language acquisition skill.
Course Objectives To accomplish the above aims, you have a golden opportunity in the series of objectives which are divided into two, namely short term and long term.
While short term objectives revolve around immediate accomplishment i.e.
what you are able to attain at the end of each unit, the long term objectives indicate your demonstration of mastery of ٌٌﻑْﺮَﺻ.
In technical terms, your short term objectives are called behavioural objectives.
Such objectives are meant to measure the extent to which you have benefited from the unit lesson just taught.
In other words the extent you can recall, state, comprehend, or perform any prescribed task on just concluded lesson.
On the other hand, the long term objectives are futuristic i.e.
they revolve around your ability to permanently retain the conjugation of verbs from ٍﺽﺎَﻣ to ِﺮْﻣَﺃ or noun from َﺩَﺮْﻔُﻣ to ﻊﻤﺟ, or the extent you can derive fresh words from their roots such as ﺔﻟﻵﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻥﺎﻣﺰﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ etc.
based on the skills acquired during the course.
You are hereby expected to be able to: • describe the scope of ٌٌﻑْﺮَﺻ; • state what ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ and ٌﻮـْﺤَﻧ have in common; • conjugate verbs; • enrich and enlarge your vocabulary base through derivatives known as ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ ; and • use in sentences the newly acquired words ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ 1 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Working Through this Course ARA012 is made up of 12 units, carefully packaged to enable you to learn ٌﻑْﺮَﺻ without tears.
Basically, you are expected to study all units in addition to any other books as may be recommended by NOUN.
As you progress in this course, you will find Assessment exercise specially designed to enable you to gage your level of attainment of the behavioural objectives.
Further more, at the end of every unit, you will required to submit written assignments for assessment purposes.
You will also write a final examination at the end of this course.
Course Materials Major components of course materials are: 1.
Course Guide 2.
Study Units 3.
Textbooks 4.
Assignment Files 5.
Presentation Schedules You are expected to obtain the materials which are available in NOUN offices.
You can approach either the facilitator in your Study Centre or the Study Centre Manager to obtain your copies.
Study Units In this course, there are 12 study units broken into four modules.
They are as follows: Module 1 Unit 1 ﻑﺮﺼﻟﺍ ﻒﻳﺮﻌﺗ Unit 2 ءﺎﻤﺳﻷﺍﻭ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ ﻦـﻣ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ Unit 3 ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ Module 2 Unit 1 ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ Unit 2 ﻪﻋﻭﺮﻓﻭ ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ Unit 3 ﻪﻋﻭﺮﻓﻭ ﻯﺪﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ Unit 4 ﻪﻋﻭﺮﻓﻭ ﻡﺯﻼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ 2 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Module 3 Unit 1 ﻢﺳﻹﺍ ﻉﺍﻮﻧﺃ Unit 2 ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ Unit 3 ﻰﺿﺎﻤﻟﺍ ﻡﺯﻼﻤﻟﺍ ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ Module 4 Unit 1 ﺎﻬﻴﻧﻮﻤﺘﻟﺄﺳ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ Unit 2 ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ Each Unit contains a number of self – tests.
In general terms, these self-test questions on the lessons you have just covered are meant to help you to evaluate your progress and to reinforce your understanding of the lessons.
Along with your Tutor – Marked Assignments, these exercises will assist you in achieving the stated learning objectives of the individual units and of the lessons.
References and Textbooks Every unit contains a list of references and further reading.
Try to get as many as possible of those textbooks and materials listed.

This is because you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suit you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to the lecturer.
In the same way a lecturer might give you some reading to do, the study units tell you when to read, and which are your text materials or set books.
You are provided exercises to do at appropriate points, just as a lecturer might give you an in – class exercise.
Each of the study units follows a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the other units and the course as a whole.
Next to this is a set of learning objectives.
These objectives let you know what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
These learning objectives are meant to guide your study.
The moment a unit is finished, you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If this is made a habit, then you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.
The main body of the 5 ARA012: Arabic Morphology unit guides you through the required reading from other sources.
This will usually be either from your set books or from Reading section.
The following is a practical strategy for working through the course.
If you run into any trouble, telephone your tutor.
Remember that your tutor’s job is to help you.
When you need assistance, do not hesitate to call and ask your tutor to provide it.
1.
Read this Course Guide thoroughly, it is your first assignment 2.
Organize a study schedule.
Design a “Course Overview” to guide you through the course.
Note the time you are expected to spend on each unit and how the assignments relate to the unit.
Important information, e.g.
details of your tutorials, and the date of the first day of the semester is available from the study centre.
You need to gather all the information into one place, such as your diary or a wall calendar.
Whatever method you choose to use, you should decide on and write your own date’s schedule of work for each unit.
3.
Once you have created your own schedule, do everything to stay faithful to it.
The major reason that students fail is that they get behind with their course work.
If you get into difficulties with your schedule, please, let your tutor know before it is too late for help.
4.
Turn to unit 1, and read the introduction and the objectives for the unit.
5.
Assemble the study materials.
You will need your set books and the unit you are studying at any point in time.
6.
Work through the unit.
As you work through the unit, you will know what sources to consult for further information.
7.
Keep in touch with your study centre.
Up – to – date course information will be continuously available there.
8.
Well before the relevant due dates (about 4 weeks before due dates); keep in mind that you will learn a lot by doing the assignment carefully.
They have been designed to help you meet the objectives of the course and, therefore, will help you pass the examination.
Submit all assignments not later than the due date.
9. Review the objectives for each study unit to confirm that you have achieved them.
If you feel unsure about any of the objectives, review the study materials or consult your tutor.
6 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 10.
When you are confident that you have achieved a unit’s objectives, you can start on the next unit proceed unit by unit through the course and try to pace your study so that you keep yourself on schedule.
11.
When you have submitted an assignment to your tutor for marking, do not wait for its return before starting on the next unit.
Keep to your schedule.
When the assignment returned, pay particular attention to your tutor’s comments, both on the tutor-marked assignment form and also the written comments on the ordinary assignments.
12.
After completing the last unit, review the course and prepare yourself for the final examination.
Check that you have achieved the unit objectives (listed at the beginning of each unit) and the course objectives (listed in the course guide).
Facilitators/Tutors and Tutorials The dates; times and locations of these will be made available to you, together with the name, telephone number and the address of your tutor.
Each assignment will be marked by your tutor.
Pay close attention too the comments your tutor might make on your assignments as these will help in your progress make sure that assignments reach your tutor on or before the due date.
Your tutorials are important; therefore try not to skip any.
It is an opportunity to meet your tutor and your fellow students.
It is also an opportunity to get the help of your tutor and discuss any difficulties encountered on your reading.
Summary In ARA012: Arabic Morphology, you are taken through different aspects ofٌٌٌﻑْﺮَﺻ .
To a large extent, ٌٌٌﻑْﺮَﺻ is simplified for you.
It is made easy.
Words/terms such as ﺦـﻟﺇ ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ،ﻝﻮـﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ، ﻞـﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ، ﻢـﺳﺇ ،ﻞـﻌـﻓ ، ﺔﻤﻠﻛ etc.
are defined.
Where necessary, terms with technical connotation are described with illustrations.
For example, terms such ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ , (derivatives) where they are derived from, common ground betweenٌٌٌﻑْﺮَﺻ and ﻮﺤـﻧ are explained with illustrations.
Conjugation as the core ofٌٌٌﻑْﺮَﺻ is extensively explained across the units of the course.
However, your ability to conjugate, define, describe, and illustrate in sentences depends on your taking maximum advantage of the Course Guide which accompanies this Course Material.

The main motivation for the development/introduction of these language studies was the preservation of the Qur’ān – which was revealed in Arabic – in terms of its ensuring its correct reading and accurate understanding of its message.
It should be noted that the language studies of which ﻑﺮﺻ formed a part came within the context of the complete change brought by Islam to the life of the Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula.
It was a total transformation of life which means a sharp shift from the prevailing Jahiliyyah culture to civilization and urbanization spanning across social, commercial, judicial and religious aspects of life in the first and second centuries of Hijrah corresponding with seventh and eighth centuries of the Christian Era (CE).
Since ﻑﺮﺻ came as a branch of language studies, little wonder that it shares a lot with other branches especially ﻮﺤـﻧ (Grammar) which is explained below.
Against this background, our attention in this unit is focused on definition of ﻑﺮﺻ, its scope and what it shares in common with ﻮﺤـﻧ.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • defineﻑﺮﺻ ; • describe the scope ofﻑﺮﺻ ; and • state similarities and dissimilarities between ﻑﺮﺻ and Nahw.
3.0 Main Content 3.1 Definition of ﻑﺮﺻ For the purpose of illustration, let’s consider the following text: 1 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ٍﺮْﻜُﺷ َﺔَﻟﺎَﺳِﺭ َﺐَﺘَﻛ ﻭُﺮْﺘِﻫ ِﺭﺎَﻄَﻣ ﻰِﻓ َﻝَﺰَﻧﺎَﻣ َﻥﺎَﻋْﺮُﺳَﻭ .ْﻥَﺪْﻨَﻟ ِﺔَﻌِﻣﺎَﺟ ﻰِﻓ ِﺩﺎَﺼِﺘْﻗِﻹْﺍ َﺱُﺭْﺪَﻴَﻟ ﺍَﺮِﺘﻴِﻠِﻜْﻧِﺇ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ٌﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ َﺮَﻓﺎَﺳ ِﺔَﻌِﻣﺎَﺟ ﻰِﻓ ّﺐﱢﻄْﻟﺍ ُﺱُﺭْﺪَﺗ ﻰِﺘﱠﻟﺍ َﺔَﻤِﻃﺎَﻓ ِﻪِﺘْﺧُﺃ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ًﺔَﻟﺎَﺳِﺭ َﺐَﺘَﻛ ِﺔَﻌِﻣﺎَﺠْﻟﺍ ﻰِﻓ ِﻝﱠﻭَﻷْﺍ ِﻪِﻋﻮُﺒْﺳُﺃ ﻰِﻓَﻭ .ِﻩِﺪِﻟﺍَﻭ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ٌﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ َﺐَﺗﺎَﻛ َﻚِﻟَﺬَﻛَﻭ .ْﻥَﺩﺎَﺑِﺇ ِﺔَﻌِﻣﺎَﺟ ﻰِﻓ ْﺮَﺗﻮُﺒْﻤَﻜْﻟﺍ ُﺱُﺭْﺪَﻳ ﻯِﺬﱠﻟﺍ ﻥﺎَﻤْﻠَﺳ ِﻪﻴِﺧَﺃ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ﻯَﺮْﺧُﺃ ًﺔَﻟﺎَﺳِﺭَﻭ ﺎَﻳِﺮﻴِﺠْﻴَﻧ ِﺱﻮُﻏَﻻ .ْﺐُﺘْﻜَﻳ ْﻢَﻟ َﻥﺎَﻀَﻣَﺭ ﱠﻻِﺇ َﻥﻮُﺘَﺑﺎَﻜَﺘَﻳ ْﻢُﻬُﻌﻴِﻤَﺟ َﺃَﺪَﺑَﻭ ِﺱﻮُﻏَﻼِﺑ ِﺕَﻻﺎَﺼْﺗِﻹْﺍ ِﺔَﻛْﺮَﺷ ﻰِﻓ ُﻞِﻐَﺘْﺸَﻳ ﻯِﺬﱠﻟﺍ ﻥﺎَﻀَﻣَﺭ ُﻪَﻘﻳِﺪَﺻ َﺐﱢﺘَﻜُﺗ ْﻥَﺃ ِﻪِﺗَﺪِﻟﺍَﻭ ْﻦِﻣ َﺐَﻠَﻃ ،ْﻥَﺪْﻨَﻟ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ُﻩِﺮَﻔَﺳ َﻞْﺒَﻗ ًﻼْﻔِﻃ َﺐَﺠْﻧَﺃ ْﺪَﻗ ﺍًﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ ﱠﻥَﺃ ﺎَﻤِﺑَﻭ .ﺍًﺭِﺬَﺘْﻌُﻣ َﺐَﺘَﻛ ﱠﻢُﺛ ُﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ ُﻪَﺒَﺘْﻜَﺘْﺳﺍَﻭ ُﺮَﺸْﻨُﺗ ﻰِﺘﱠﻟﺍ ِﺩﺎَﺼِﺘْﻗِﻹْﺍ ِﺔﱠﻠَﺠَﻣ ﻰِﻓ ِﺔَﻴِﻧﺎﱠﺜﻟﺍ ِﺔَﻠَﺣْﺮَﻤْﻟﺍ ﻰِﻓ ْﺐِﺘَﺘْﻜَﻳ َﺃَﺪَﺑ ْﺪَﻗ ﺎًﺒﻴِﺠَﻧ ﺎًﺒِﻟﺎَﻃ ِﻪِﺘَﻔِﺼِﺑ ﺪِﻟﺎَﺧَﻭ .
ﺮﻴِﻐﱠﺼﻟﺍ ُﻪَﻨْﺑِﺇ .ِﻪِﺘَﻌِﻣﺎَﺟ ﻰِﻓ ﺎﻳِﺭْﻭَﺩ By definition, Morphology, simply called ﻑﺮﺻ in Arabic is the study of the structural formation of words and the cases that affect the formation.
The literal meaning of ﻑﺮﺻ is indicative of what Morphology is all about.
Literally, ﻑﺮﺻ means to change i.e.
to change from one form to another form.
Technically, ﻑﺮﺻ means a structural change affecting a word called ﺔﻤﻠﻛ from one form to another form or to several forms.
For instance, you will observe in the above text how the word َﺐَﺘَﻛ changed from one form to several forms.
The word َﺐَﺘَﻛ (to write) has structurally changed severally e.g.
ٌﺐَﺘْﻜَﻣ ْﺐُﺘْﻜَﺗ َﻻ ْﺐُﺘْﻛُﺃ ٌﺏﻮُﺘْﻜَﻣ ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ ًﺔَﺑﺎَﺘِﻛ ُﺐُﺘْﻜَﻳ َﺐَﺘَﻛ ٌﺔَﺒَﺘْﻜَﻣ In the same text, the word changed from (َﺐَﺘَﻛ) to (َﺐَﺗﺎَﻛ) i.e.
to correspond with e.g.
َﻻ ْﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ ٌﺐَﺗﺎَﻜُﻣ ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻜُﻣ ًﺔَﺒَﺗﺎَﻜُﻣ ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻜُﻳ َﺐَﺗﺎَﻛ ْﺐِﺗﺎَﻜُﺗ It can further change to َﺐﱠﺘَﻛ (meaning to make one write) ْﺐﱢﺘَﻜُﺗ َﻻ ٌﺐﱢﺘَﻛ ٌﺐﱢﺘَﻜُﻣ ٌﺐﱠﺘَﻜُﻣ ﺎًﺒﻴِﺘْﻜَﺗ ُﺐﱢﺘَﻜُﻳ َﺐﱠﺘَﻛ It can change to َﺐَﺘَﺘْﻛِﺇ (meaning to subscribe to a paper or a journal) ْﺐَﺘِﺘْﻜَﺗ َﻻ ﺐْﺘَﺘِْﻛِﺇ ٌﺐِﺘَﺘْﻜُﻣ ﺎًﺑﺎَﺘِﺘْﻛِﺇ ُﺐِﺘَﺘْﻜَﻳ َﺐَﺘَﺘْﻛِﺇ It can also change to َﺐَﺘْﻜَﺘْﺳِﺇ i.e.
to ask one to write.
ْﺐِﺘْﻜَﺘْﺴَﺗ َﻻ ْﺐِﺘْﻜَﺘْﺳِﺇ ُﺐَﺘْﻜَﺘْﺴُﻣ ُﺐِﺘْﻜَﺘْﺴُﻣ ﺎًﺑﺎَﺘْﻜِﺘْﺳِﺇ ُﺐِﺘْﻜَﺘْﺴَﻳ َﺐَﺘْﻜَﺘْﺳِﺇ It can change to َﺐَﺗﺎَﻜَﺗ ْﺐِﺗﺎَﻜَﺘَﺗ َﻻ ْﺐِﺗﺎَﻜَﺗ ُﺐَﺗﺎَﻜَﺘُﻣ ُﺐِﺗﺎَﻜَﺘُﻣ ﺎًﺒُﺗﺎَﻜَﺗ َﺐُﺗﺎَﻜَﺘَﻳ َﺐَﺗﺎَﻜَﺗ Further, some of its derivatives are: ٌﺏﺎَﺘِﻛ a book ُﺏﺎَﺘِﻜْﻟﺍ holy book (ُﺐﻴِﺗﺎَﺘَﻜْﻟﺍ) ُﺏﺎﱠﺘُﻜْﻟﺍ the children’s school Self Assessment Exercise Give definition of ﻑﺮﺻ with illustration 3.2 The Scope of ﻑﺮﺻ The word ٌﺔَﻤْﻠَﻛ precisely defines the scope ofﻑﺮﺻ .
Kalmah which means a word is of three types; namely ٌﻞْﻌِﻓ (verb) ٌﻢْﺳِﺇ (noun) ٌﻑْﺮَﺣ (particle) Examples: ٌﻞْﻌِﻓ ٌﻢْﺳِﺇ ٌﻑْﺮَﺣ 2 ARA012: Arabic Morphology َﺏَﺮَﺿ to beat ٌﺪَﻟَﻭ a boy ْﻦِﻣ from َﺲَﻠَﺟ to seat ٌﺰْﺒُﺧ bread ﻰَﻟِﺇ to َﺱَﺭَﺩ to study ٌﺏﺎَﺘِﻛ a book ﻰِﻓ in Of all the three types of Kalmah listed above, ﻑﺮﺻ covers verbs and nouns to the exclusion of particles.
The question you may ask then is: what does ﻑﺮﺻ do to verbs and nouns?
The answer is, simply put, ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ which means structural transformation of verbs and nouns into various shapes and forms.
It should be quickly noted that the structural transformation we are talking about is for a purpose which is the reflection of different meanings and situations sometimes tied up to periodization.
When ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ takes its toll on verbs and nouns, they (verbs and nouns) are called ﺔﻓﺮﺼﺘﻣ i.e.
ﺔﻓﺮﺼﺘﻣ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﺃ and ﺔﻓﺮﺼﺘﻣ ءﺎﻤﺳﺃ.
This is a situation when a verb is conjugated such as conjugating a verb from past tense (ٍﺽﺎَﻣ), present tense (ٌﻉِﺭﺎَﻀُﻣ), and command i.e.
future tense (ُﺮْﻣَﺃ).
When noun is taken through the same process of ﻒﻳﺮﺼﺗ i.e.

3 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.3 Between Ṣarf and Nahw ﻑﺮﺻ and Nahw in terms of their functions are like a pair of scissors in which one tongue cannot function alone without the other tongue.
Both ﻑﺮﺻ and Nahw complement each other in preserving the Arabic language and ultimately guide the learner towards making correct and intelligible sentences.
So, what they both share in common is the role of preserving the language through application of their rules and regulations.
However, in terms of the scope of operation, they differ significantly as illustrated in the text below.

For example, verbs such as: َﺐَﻫَﺫ ،َﺢَﺘَﻓ ،َﻲِﻘَﺑ ،ﻲَﻀَﻣ ،ﻲَﻀَﻗ ،َﺮَﻣَﺃ ،َﺭﺍَﺯ ،َﺩﺍَﺭَﺃ change from one form to another to reflect different periods.
In the same token, nouns such as: ﱡﻡُﻷْﺍ ،ُﻥﺎﱠﻛﱡﺪﻟﺍ ،ُﺔَﻨﻳِﺪَﻤْﻟﺍ ،ﱡﻢَﻌْﻟﺍ ،ُﺔﱠﻤَﻌْﻟﺍ ،ُﺔَﻳْﺮَﻘْﻟﺍ ،ُﺐﻳِﺮَﻘْﻟﺍ ،ُﻉﻮﺒْﺳُﻷْﺍ ،ُﺔَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻤْﻟﺍ change from one form to another to reflect number.
This constant change is known as ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ (deletion) and it applies to both ٌﻝﺎَﻌْﻓَﺃ and ٌءﺎَﻤْﺳَﺃ.
Let us consider the following two tables which are loaded with ﺕﺎـﻤﻠﻛ extracted from the text above.

The English term declension is used to denote both ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ and ُﺏﺍَﺮْﻋِﺇ.
While ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ 4 ARA012: Arabic Morphology means structural transformation of a verb or noun as illustrated in the two tables above, ُﺏﺍَﺮْﻋِﺇ means changes that occur in the vowels at the end of a word be it verb or noun.
The vowels that are amenable to changes are Dammah ـُــ Fathah ـَــ Kasrah ـِــ and Sukun ـْــ.
The following sentences give examples of ُﺏﺍَﺮْﻋِﺇ in action.
ِﻪِﺗَﺭِﺩﺎَﻐُﻣ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ِﻥﺎَﻋﻮُﺒْﺳُﺃ ﻰَﻀَﻣ ْﺪَﻗ .1 ِﻪِﺘْﺧُﺃ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ُﺐَﻫْﺬَﻴَﺳ .2 ِﺔَﻳْﺮَﻘْﻟﺍ ﻰِﻓ .3 ِﻪِﺑِﺭﺎَﻗَﺃ َﻊﻴِﻤَﺟ ُﺭﻭُﺰَﻴَﺳ .4 ِﻪِﺘَﻓْﺮُﻏ َﺏﺎَﺑ َﺢَﺘْﻓَﻷ .5 ٌﻒَﻠَﺳ ِﻦْﻳَﺪِﻟﺍَﻮْﻟﺍ ﱠﺮِﺑ ﱠﻥِﺇ .6 ِﺓَﺭﺎَﺠﱢﺘﻟﺍ ﻰَﻠَﻋ َﻦﻳِﺮْﻤﱠﺘﻟﺍ ُﻞﱢﻀَﻓُﺃ .7 .ٍﻡْﻮَﻳ ﱠﻞُﻛ ِﻥﺎﱠﻛﱡﺪﻟﺍ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ْﺐَﻫْﺫِﺇ .8 In the first sentence, ﻥﺎﻋﻮﺒﺳﺃ is in the nominative case which is known as ﻉﻮﻓﺮﻣ with alf (ﺍ) representing dammat.
In the word ﻪﺗﺭﺩﺎﻐﻣ , ﺓ takes kasrah due to the influence of the article ﻰﻠﻋ .
ﻪﺘﺧﺃ in the second sentence takes kasrah due to the influence of ﻰﻟﺇ.
the end of ﺔﻳﺮﻘﻟﺍ also takes kasrah due to the influence of ﻲﻓ.
ﺭﻭﺰﻳ in the fourth sentence takes fat-hah because it is in the accusative case under the influence of ﻥﺇ.
the word ﻊﻴﻤﺟ as ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ (also accusative) takes fat-hah.
The word ﻪﺑﺭﺎﻗﺃ takes kasrah as you can see it in (ﺏ).
This is called genitive case ﻪﻴﻟﺇ ﻑﺎﻀﻣ.
The verb ﺢﺘﻓﺃ takes fat-hah due to the influence of what is known as ﻲﻛ ﻡﻻ.
ﺏﺎﺑ takes fat-hah because it is ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ while ﺔﻓﺮﻏ takes kasrah becase it is in genitive case ﻪﻴﻟﺇ ﻑﺎﻀﻣ.
ﻦﻳﺪﻟﺍﻮﻟﺍ ﱠﺮﺑ.
while ﺮﺑ takes fat-hah due to the influence of ﻥﺇ, ﻦﻳﺪﻟﺍﻮﻟﺍ is in genitive case ﻑﺎﻀﻣ ﻪﻴﻟﺇ and so it takes kasrah which is represented in yaa.
In the last sentence, ﺐﻫﺫﺍ known as ﺮﻣﻷﺍ ﻞﻌﻓ takes sukun as the sign of jazm.
By now, the distinction between ﻑﺮﺻ and ﻮﺤﻧ must have been crystal clear to you.
For example, while ﻑﺮﺻ with its rules governs the act of changing the words (i.e ﻞﻌـﻓ ﻭﺃ ،ﻢـﺳﺇ :ﺔﻤﻠﻛ,) from one form to another, ﻮﺤﻧ takes the control of alteration of vowel at the end of words in accordance with the prevailing case.
Basically, both ﻮﺤﻧ and ﻑﺮﺻare supposed to guide you to make correct statement with a view to accurately reflecting the intended meaning and situations correctly.
One point of observation, you should recall that ﻑﺮﺤﻟﺍ the particle is the third member of the ﺔﻤﻠﻛ family.
But it is not governed by any regulation that will make it change its form.
It has a lone structure that never changes.
Unlike the nature of ﻞﻌـﻓ and ﻢـﺳﺇ the particle such as ﻰَﻠَﻋ ،ﻰَﻟِﺇ ،ﻲِﻓ ،ﱠﻥِﺇ ،ﱠﻥَﺃ are free fron any rule that could either change their forms or their vowels.
Self Assessment Exercise What is the difference between ﻑﺮﺻ and ﻮﺤﻧ ?
Illustrate your answer with examples.
5 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 6 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 4.0 Conclusion ﻑﺮﺻ and ﻮﺤﻧ have one thing in common; namely preservation of Arabic Language through provision of rules and regulations that guide the learner of the language to make flawless and intelligible expressions.
Further more, both of them have ﺔﻤﻠﻜﻟﺍ (word) as the area of operation.
But while ﻑﺮﺻ deals with the structural transformation of the words into various shapes and forms, ﻮﺤﻧ deals with the changes that occur in the vowels especially at the end of the word ( ﺔﻤﻠﻜﻟﺍ ﺮﺧﺍﻭﺃ ) 5.0 Summary This Unit introduced Ṣarf (Arabic Morphology) to you as the study of the structural changes taking place in words with a view to creating various meanings from one single root.
It showed how both ﻑﺮﺻ and ﻮﺤﻧ take the ﺔﻤﻠﻛ as their area of oppration.
It gives coupious examples as illustration and provides you with self assessment exercises so that you will be able to know your level of understanding.
The conclusion highlights the main point discussed.

Also treated was the scope of ﻑﺮـﺻ which is ﺕﺎﻤﻠﻛ be it ٌﻞْﻌِﻓ or ٌﻢْﺳِﺇ.
In this Unit, the status of ٌﻞْﻌِﻓ is explained as well as that of ٌﻢْﺳِﺇ..
In other words, you will learn that in the unit different technical descriptions of each of them.
And as usual, this will be loaded with illustrations.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to describe: - ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ - ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍﻭ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ - ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ is so called when it is pure.
The purity of the ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ is when all its letters are free of any form of defect.
Such letters are called Radicals to the extent that they are all original to that verb and each of them is indispensable for the verb will be rendered meaningless, should any of the letters be omitted e.g.
: ﺐﻛﺭ.
Take the verb ﺐﻛﺭ which means he took a ride, should letter ﺭ be omitted the rest two letters ﺐﻛ becomes meaningless or at least the remaining two letters cannot mean to take a ride.
So, ﺐﻛﺭ is ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻞﻌﻓ because each of the three letters is basic.
Essentially, we must take note of the fact that ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ i.e.
a three-lettered verb is the smallest verb in size as far as Arabic is concerned.
And the longest in size is the one called ﻰِﺳﺍَﺪُﺳ i.e.
a six-lettered verb treated below in details.
Let us consider the following sentences.
Ahmad rode a camel – ًﻼَﻤَﺟ ُﺪَﻤْﺣَﺃ َﺐِﻛَﺭ The seeker and the sought are weak – ُﺏﻮُﻠْﻄَﻤْﻟﺍَﻭ ُﺐِﻟﺎﱠﻄﻟﺍ َﻒْﻌَﺿ 8 ARA012: Arabic Morphology God always assists the wronged – ﻡﻮُﻠْﻈَﻤْﻟﺍ ﺎَﻤِﺋﺍَﺩ ُﷲﺍ َﺮَﺼَﻧ Whatever the mighty does is beautiful – ُﻞﻴِﻤَﺠْﻟﺍ َﻮُﻬَﻟ ُﻞﻴِﻠَﺠْﻟﺍ ُﻪَﻠَﻌَﻓ ﺎَﻣ ﱠﻞُﻛ Hearing about Muaydi is better than seeing him – ُﻩﺍَﺮَﺗ ْﻥَﺃ ْﻦِﻣ ُﺮْﻴَﺧ ﻯِﺪْﻴَﻌُﻣ ْﻦَﻋ ْﻊَﻤْﺴَﺗ Noha’s ark did not capsize in the flood – ِﻥﺎَﻓﻮﱡﻄﻟﺍ ﻰِﻓ َﺡﻮُﻧ ُﺔَﻨﻴِﻔَﺳ ْﺖَﻗِﺮَﻏ ﺎَﻣ God saved Noah’s ark from capsizing – ِﻕْﺮَﻐْﻟﺍ َﻦِﻣ ﺡﻮُﻧ َﺔَﻨﻴِﻔَﺳ ُﷲﺍ َﻆِﻔَﺣ The hardworking student passed with distinction – ٍﺯﺎَﻴِﺘْﻣِﺈِﺑ ِﻥﺎَﺤِﺘْﻣﻻْﺍ ﻰِﻓ ﱡﺪِﺠُﻤْﻟﺍ ُﺐِﻟﺎﱠﻄﻟﺍ َﺢَﺠَﻧ 3.1.1 Analysis In the above sentences, the following verb features: ،َﻕِﺮَﻏ ،َﻊِﻤَﺳ ،َﻞَﻌَﻓ ،َﺮَﺼَﻧ ،َﺐِﻛَﺭ ،َﻒَﻌَﺿ َﺢَﺠَﻧ ،َﻆَﻔَﺣ.
Each of the verbs is ﺩﺮﺠﻣ.
They are so called because their foundation letters do not suffer any form of deficiency.
Each of the letters is called radical.
It should be noted quickly that the opposite of ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ is ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ which is simply defined as a verb with additional letters – i.e.
additional to the foundation radicals.
For example, take note of the verbs in the following excerpt: Celebrate the praises of thy Lord ُﻩْﺮِﻔْﻐَﺘْﺳﺍَﻭ َﻚﱢﺑَﺭ ِﺪْﻤَﺤِﺑ ْﺢﱢﺒَﺴَﻓ And remember Moses prayed for water for his people ﻰَﺳﻮُﻣ ﻰَﻘْﺴَﺘْﺳﺍ ِﺫِﺇَﻭ ِﻪِﻣْﻮَﻘِﻟ Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs َﺓَﺮَﺸَﻋ ﺎَﺘَﻨْﺛﺍ ُﻪْﻨِﻣ ْﺕَﺮَﺠَﻔْﻧﺎَﻓ ﺎًﻨْﻴَﻋ The verb َﺮَﺠَﻔْﻧﺍ ﻰَﻘْﺴَﺘْﺳِﺇ ،َﺮَﻔْﻐَﺘْﺳﺍ ،َﺢﱢﺒَﺳ have, to their foundation radicals, additional letters such as ﺏ in َﺢﱢﺒَﺳ ﺕ ﺱ ﺍ in َﺮَﻔْﻐَﺘْﺳﺍ ﺕ ﺱﺇ in ﻰَﻘْﺴَﺘْﺳِﺇ ﻥ ﺇ in َﺮَﺠَﻔْﻧِﺇ The meaning of ْﺢﱢﺒَﺳ with the additional ﺏ i.e.
ُﻒﻴِﻌْﻀَﺗ is to glorify your Lord.
But in case that additional ﺏ is removed, you are left with َﺢَﺒَﺳ which is still meaningful albeit a different meaning.
In other words, its removal can only alter the meaning of the remaining letters but not to render them meaningless.
And when the additional letters ﺕ ﺱ ﺇ are removed, the remaining ﺮﻔﻏ is meaningful.
It means to forgive i.e.
granted forgiveness.
ﻰَﻘْﺴَﺘْﺳِﺇ is to seek drinking water.
And with the removal of ﺕ ﺱ ﺇ, the remaining ﻰﻘﺳ is meaningful.
It means he granted drinking water.
The case of ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ is mentioned here only in passing for illustration purpose.
It will be treated in details in 3.2 below.
Meanwhile, we return to ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ.

9 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.2 ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍﻭ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ By now, you should be able to describe what Mujarrad is with illustration.
You can even state its opposite which is Mazīd.
But you should recognize the two types of Mujarrad that do co-exist; namely ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ and ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ.
They are the two types and each of them with its own branches which are not treated in this unit.
Suffice it to say that ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ is the three lettered verb with the three radicals, as already explained and illustrated, all of which are basic, pure and indispensable.
You should be able to explain what indispensability of a basic radical means in a verb – Mujarrad verb.
Any of the verbs we have come across above will be good enough as example of ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ.
َﻕِﺮَﻏ ،َﺮَﺼَﻧ ،َﻒُﻌَﺿ etc.
3.2.1 ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ may require more attention because you are coming in contact with it for the first time in this material.
ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ can be defined as a four lettered verb or quadratic.
Like the description of the three lettered verb, ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ is the four-lettered verb whose four letters are basic, original and indispensable.
Should any of the four letters be omitted, the meaning of three letters become meaningless.
َﻞَﻤْﺴَﺑ means he said ﻢﻴﺣﺮﻟﺍ ﻦﻤﺣﺮﻟﺍ ﷲﺍ ﻢﺴﺑ, َﻞَﻗْﻮَﺣ means he said ﻢﻴﻈﻌﻟﺍ ﻲﻠﻌﻟﺍ ﷲﺎﺑ ﻻﺇ ﺓﻮﻗ ﻻﻭ ﻝﻮﺣ ﻻ, َﻢَﺟْﺮَﺣ means he gathered or assembled something.
Each of these verbs is ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ because all the radicals in them are basic and indispensable.
Read the following text: ﱠﻥَﺃ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ًءﺎَﻨِﺑَﻭ .ﺓَﺭﻮﱡﺴﻟﺍ َﺃَﺮَﻗَﻭ ُﺪَﻤْﺣَﺃ َﻞَﻤْﺴَﺑ .ِﺪﻳِﻮْﺠﱠﺘﻟﺍ ِﺓﱠﺩﺎَﻣ ِﺔَﻳﺍَﺪِﺑ ﻰِﻓ ِﻖَﻠَﻌْﻟﺍ َﺓَﺭﻮُﺳ َﺃَﺮْﻘَﻳ ْﻥَﺃ َﺪَﻤْﺣَﺃ ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ َﺮَﻣَﺃ ُﻪَﻟ َﻥَﺫْﺄَﻳ ْﻥَﺃ َﻞْﺒَﻗ َﻡﺎَﻗَﻭ َﺃَﺮْﻘَﻴِﻟ َﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ ٌﺪْﻳَﺯ َﻥَﺫْﺄَﺘْﺳُﺃ َﻙﺎَﻨُﻫ .َﺪَﻤْﺣَﻷ َﻙَﺭﺎَﺑَﻭ ﺎًﺒَﺠْﻌُﻣ ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ َﻞَﻗْﻮَﺣ ًﺓَﺩﱠﻮَﺠُﻣ ْﺖَﻧﺎَﻛ ُﻪَﺗَءﺍَﺮِﻗ ٍﺕﺎَﻄْﺨَﻟ َﺪْﻌَﺑَﻭ .ُﻪَﻤَﻨَﻏ ﻰِﻋﺍﱠﺮﻟﺍ َﻙَﺮْﺑَﺃ ﺎَﻤَﻛ ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ ُﻪَﺴَﻠْﺟَﺃَﻭ ِﺏَﺩَﻷْﺍ ِءﻮُﺴِﻟ ﺍًﺪﻳِﺪَﺷ ﺎًﺒْﻀَﻏ ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ َﺐِﻀَﻐَﻓ .ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ ِﺓَءﺍَﺮِﻘْﻠِﻟ َﻚَﺴْﻔَﻧ َﺖْﻣﱠﺪَﻗ ﺍَﺫﺎَﻤِﻟَﻭ .ﱡﻖَﺤْﻟﺍ َﺺَﺤْﺼَﺣ َﻥﻵْﺍ ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ َﻝﺎَﻗَﻭ ًﺓَﺩﱠﻮَﺠُﻣ َﺮْﻴَﻏ ًﺓَءﺍَﺮِﻗ َﺃَﺮَﻗَﻭ َﻡﺎَﻗَﻭ َﺃَﺮْﻘَﻴِﻟ ٍﺪْﻳَﺰِﻟ َﻥِﺫُﺃ .َﺄَﻄْﺧَﺃ ْﻥِﺇ ُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﻷْﺍ ُﻪَﻣﱢﻮَﻘُﻳ ْﻰَﻜِﻟ ِﺓَءﺍَﺮِﻘْﻠِﻟ ِﻪِﺴْﻔَﻧ ِﻢﻳِﺪْﻘَﺗ ﻰَﻠَﻋ َﻊﱠﺠَﺸَﺗ ُﻪﱠﻧَﺃ ٌﺪْﻳَﺯ َﺭَﺬَﺘْﻋﺍ ؟ِﺓَءﺍَﺮِﻘْﻟﺍ ﻰَﻠَﻋ َﻚِﺗَﺭْﺪُﻗ ﻡَﺪَﻋ َﻢْﻏَﺭ .ُﻩُﺫﺎَﺘْﺳُﺃ ُﻪَﻣﱠﻮَﻗَﻭ ٌﺪْﻳَﺯ َﺄَﻄْﺧَﺃ ،ًﻼْﻌِﻓَﻭ 3.2.2 Analysis The four-lettered (quadratic) verbs in the excerpt are: ﻞﻤﺴﺑ… He recited ﻢﻴﺣﺮﻟﺍ ﻦﻤﺣﺮﻟﺍ ﷲﺍ ﻢﺴﺑ ﻞﻗﻮﺣ… He says ﻢﻴﻈﻌﻟﺍ ﻲﻠﻌﻟﺍ ﷲﺎﺑ ﻻﺇ ﺓﻮﻗ ﻻﻭ ﻝﻮﺣ ﻻ ﻙﺮﺑﺃ… The Shepard forced his camel down.
ﺺﺤﺼﺣ… Truthfulness is manifest.
These are pure four-lettered verbs, the letters are foundation radicals.
And should any of the letters drop, the remaining letters lose meaning and effectiveness.
In the same excerpt, there are other four-lettered verbs such as ﺄَﻄْﺧَﺃ – َﻙَﺭﺎَﺑ – َﻡﱠﺪَﻗ – َﻡﱠﻮَﻗ.
Though they are four-lettered, they are not ٌﺩﱠﺮَﺠُﻣ because they have in their foundation letters additional letter that can be removed without rendering the 10 ARA012: Arabic Morphology remaining letters meaningless.
The verbs of this nature are known as ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ which is treated in 3.3 below.
Self Assignment Exercise Give each of the following verbs its appropriate descriptive terms and use it in a sentence.
َﺏَﺮَﺿ - َﻞَﺳْﺭَﺃ - َﺢَﺘَﻓ - َﻉَﺰْﻋَﺯ - َﺢﱠﺘَﻓ 3.3 ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ as alluded to in passing above is the opposite of Mujarrad.
A verb is described as al-Mazid feehi if it contains one or more additional letters to the original component ones which are known as foundation radicals.
Both ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ and ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ can take additional letters to become ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ.
An example of al-Mazeed thulaathiyy is َﻞَﺗﺎَﻗ with the additional ﺓﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ to َﻞَﺘَﻗ.
It can also become َﻞَﺗﺎَﻘَﺗ as ﺕ and ﺓﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ are added.
Or َﺮَﻔْﻐَﺘْﺳِﺇ as ﺕ ﺱ ﺇ are added to ﺮﻔﻏ.
Or َﻢَﺠْﻧَﺮْﺣِﺇ as ﻥ ﺇ are added to ﻢﺟﺮﺣ.
3.3.1 ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ In order to make formation of ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ easy, there are specific letters used.
The letters are known as additional letters ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ.
Again, for easy reference, the letters contained in a statement designated in ﺎَﻬﻴِﻧﻮُﻤُﺘْﻟَﺄَﺳ.
You can see that they are ten: i.e.
ﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ ﺍ ـﻫ ﻱ ﻥ ﻭ ﻡ ﺕ ﻝ ﺃ ﺱ.
However, there is also what is known as ُﻒﻴِﻌْﻀَﺗ.
This is a case in which ـّــ serves as an additional letter.
For example, in َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ, letter ﺭ is doubled with ـّــ.
In such a case, which is one of the foundation radicals also becomes an additional letter.
ﺱﺭﺩ means to study.
But when another ﺭ is added, we have َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ which means to teach.
The following table gives classification of various ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ.

ﱠﻥَﺄَﻤْﻃِﺇ ،َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ ،ﱠﻞَﺤَﻤْﺿِﺇ ،َﺐَﺷْﻮَﺸْﻋِﺇ.
This is to emphasize that apart from the 10 letters which are specifically designated as ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ in ﺎﻬﻴﻧﻮﻤﺘﻟﺄﺳ, any other letter can assume the position of additional letter through ﻒﻴِﻌْﻀَﺗ i.e.
َﺓﱠﺪَﺷ.
12 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.3.2 Distinction between ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ and ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ By now, you must have been able to state the characteristics of ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ be it ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ or ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ.
By means of revision, ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ is a three-lettered or four-lettered verb which has all its component letters original and pure.
It is so described because should any of the letters drop, the remaining letters can no longer qualify as a verb.
In contrast, we have ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ as described in 3.3 above.
Both ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ and ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ are capable of being increased by one, two or three letters or by what is called ﻒﻴﻌﻀﺗ i.e.
ﺓﱠﺪﱠﺸﻟﺍ It should be noted that the purpose of increasing letter of a verb is to change the meaning.
For example: َﺱَﺭَﺩ (he) studied َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ (he) taught َﻢِﻠَﻋ (he) knew َﻢَﻠْﻋَﺃ (he) informed َﺲَﻠَﺟ (he) sat َﺲَﻠْﺟَﺃ (he) caused some one to sit َﻞَﺳَﺭ (he) moved slowly َﻞَﺳْﺭَﺃ (he) sent some one forward َﻞَﺘَﻗ (he) killed َﻞَﺗﺎَﻘَﺗ (to) fight each other َﺮَﻔَﻏ (he) forgave َﺮَﻔْﻐَﺘْﺳِﺇ (he) sought forgiveness َﻝﺎَﻗ (he) said َﻝﺎَﻘَﺘْﺳِﺇ (he) resigned You should also note that the increased verbs (ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ) are given appropriate terms as they take additional letters.
These include: ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ (four-lettered) َﻙَﺮْﺑَﺃ ،َﻙَﺭﺎَﺑ ،َﻢﱠﻠَﻋ ،َﻞَﺗﺎَﻗ ،َﻞَﺳْﺭَﺃ ﻰﺳﺎﻤﺨﻟﺍ (five-lettered) َﺾﱠﻤَﻐَﺗ ،َﻒَﺴْﻠَﻔَﺗ ،َﻢﱠﻄَﺤَﺗ ،َﺮَﺼْﻴَﻤَﺗ ،َﻞَﺗﺎَﻘَﺗ َﻢﱠﻠَﻌَﺗ ﻰﺳﺍﺪﺴﻟﺍ (six-lettered) َﺐَﺷْﻮَﺸْﻋِﺇ ،َﺫﱠﻮَﻠْﺟِﺇ ،َﻢﱠﻠْﻌَﺘْﺳِﺇ ،َﺮَﺴْﻔَﺘْﺳِﺇ َﻢَﺠْﻧَﺮْﺣِﺇ Self Assessment Exercise What is the purpose of ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ?
Give four complete sentences in Arabic for illustration of your answer.
13 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 4.0 Conclusion It has been clarified in this unit that the ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ are ten as contained in ﺎﻬﻴﻧﻮﻤﺘﻟﺄﺳ.
But it should be noted that shaddah known as ﻒﻴﻌﻀﺗ can also serve as an additional letter as reflected in َﻢﱠﻠَﻋ ،َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ ،َﻞﱠﻀَﻓ ،َﺮﱠﺴَﻗ etc.
Furthermore, you should note that ﺔﻋﺭﺎﻀﻤﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ are also among ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ.
These are called ﺖﻴﻧﺃ they are illustrated in ُﺲِﻠْﺟَﺃ ،ُﺲِﻠْﺠَﻧ ،ُﺲِﻠْﺠَﺗ ،ُﺲِﻠْﺠَﻳ.
5.0 Summary The distinction between ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ and ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ is that every letter in the ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ is original and cannot be dropped without disrupting the meaning of the verb.
For example, if a letter is removed from ﺲﻠﺟ e.g.
ﺝ the remaining ﺲﻟ have no meaning.
In case of ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ removing a letter or more can only change the meaning but not to render the verb meaningless e.g.
if ﻒﻟﺃ is removed from ﻞﺗﺎﻗ you still have ﻞﺘﻗ which is meaningful i.e.
he killed though it is different from the meaning of ﻞﺗﺎﻗ.
Generally, ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ is advantageous in terms of widening the scope if verbs as a verb through ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺯ can produce various meaning.

The function of ٌﻥﺯَﻭ is to categorise the Arabic verbs by way of putting each verb in its appropriate context.
In this unit, therefore, you will be introduced to the six known measures called ﻝﺎَﻌَﻓﻷﺍ ُﻥﺍَﺯﻭَﺃ for the ﺩﱠﺮَﺠُﻤْﻟَﺍ ﻰِﺛﻼﱡﺜﻟﺍ as well as others for ﺩﱠﺮَﺠُﻤْﻟَﺍ ﻰِﻋﺎَﺑﱡﺮﻟﺍ.
Also to be treated are the ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ for ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ.

These verbs represent ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ in its six ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ which are encompassed in َﻞَﻌَﻓ.
It is the middle letter of َﻞَﻌَﻓ that changes to give birth to all six ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ.
This is graphically illustrated as follows: َﻞَﻌَﻓ 15 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞُﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞِﻌَﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞِﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ Application of the representation produces the following: ُﻒُﻌْﻀَﻳ َﻒُﻌَﺿ ُﺐَﺴْﺤَﻳ َﺐِﺴَﺣ ُﺡَﺮْﺸَﻳ َﺡَﺮَﺷ ُﺚَﺒْﻠَﻳ َﺚِﺒَﻟ ُﺲِﻠْﺠَﻳ َﺲَﻠَﺟ ُﺐُﺘْﻜَﻳ َﺐَﺘَﻛ Every letter in ﻞﻌﻓ is technically analysed as follows for easy application to the target verbs: َﻒـــُﻌــَﺿ َﺡ َﺮـــــَﺷ َﻞـــَﻌـــَﻓ ﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻡﻻ ﻦﻴﻋ ءﺎﻓ ﻡﻻ ﻦﻴﻋ ءﺎﻓ ﻞﻌﻔ ﻞﻌﻔ ﻞﻌﻔ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻞ ﻞ ﻞ ﻞ ﻞ ﻞ َﺲـــَﻠـــَﺟ َﺚـــَﺒـــﻟ َﺐـــَﺴـــَﺣ َﺐـــَﺘـــَﻛ So, you can see that ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻦْﻴَﻋ plays a crucial role in all the ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ.
Furthermore, it is ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ that determines the ﺔﻛﺮﺣ taken by the ﺓﺰﻤﻫ in ﺮﻣﺃ ﻞﻌﻓ e.g.
ْﺐُﺘْﻛُﺃ ،ْﺲِﻠْﺟِﺇ ،ْﺐَﻫْﺫِﺇ.
The principle is simply applied thus: whichever ﺔﻛﺮﺣ taken by the ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ in ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ determines the ﺔﻛﺮﺣ given to ﺓﺰﻤﻫ in ﺮﻣﺃ ﻞﻌﻓ.
If, for example, ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ takes ﺔﺤﺘﻓ or ﺓﺮﺴﻛ in ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ of any verb, the ﺓﺰﻤﻫ of ﺮﻣﺃ ﻞﻌﻓ of such a verb will take ﺓﺮﺴﻛ e.g.
ُﺐَﻫْﺬَﻳ ْﺐَﻫْﺫِﺇ ُﺲِﻠْﺠَﻳ ْﺲِﻠْﺟِﺇ But the ﺓﺰﻤﻫ of ﺮﻣﺃ ﻞﻌﻓ will take dammah whenever the ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ in ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ of any verb takes ﺔﱠﻤَﺿ e.g.
: ُﻒُﻌْﻀَﻳ ْﻒُﻌْﺿُﺃ ُﺐُﺘْﻜَﻳ ْﺐُﺘْﻛُﺃ 3.1.1 Conjugation of Verbs (ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ ﻒﻳﺮﺼﺗ) This section is devoted to the full illustration of the principles highlighted above i.e.

a verb that does not have ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ.
This will be treated fully in unit 1 of Module 2 below.
17 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.1.2 ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ Meanwhile, you should take note of the fact that ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ has its own wazn which is used in conjugation.
The main difference is that while ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ has six ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ, there is only one wazn for ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ which is َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻓ.
It is analysed thus: َﻞـــَﻠـــْﻌـــَﻓ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻﻧﺎﺜﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻷﺍ ﻞ ﻭ ﻝ Unlike ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ which has six ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ, there is only one ﻥﺯﻭ for ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ which is َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻓ and it is conjugated as follows: ْﻞِﻠْﻌَﻔُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﻠْﻌَﻓ ٌﻞَﻠْﻌَﻔُﻣ ٌﻞِﻠْﻌَﻔُﻣ ٌﺔَﻠَﻠْﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻠْﻌَﻔُﻳ َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻓ For example: َﻢَﺟْﺮَﺣ (to assemble) َﻞَﻤْﺴَﺑ (to say ﻢﻴﺣﺮﻟﺍ ﻦﻤﺣﺮﻟﺍ ﷲﺍ ﻢﺴﺑ) َﻞَﻗْﺮَﻋ (to inhibit) ْﻢِﺟْﺮَﺤُﺗ َﻻ ْﻢِﺟْﺮَﺣ ٌﻢَﺟْﺮَﺤُﻣ ٌﻢِﺟْﺮَﺤُﻣ ًﺔَﻤَﺟْﺮَﺣ ُﻢِﺟْﺮَﺤُﻳ َﻢَﺟْﺮَﺣ ْﻞِﻤْﺴَﺒُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﻤْﺴَﺑ _____ ٌﻞِﻤْﺴَﺒُﻣ ًﺔَﻠَﻤْﺴَﺑ ُﻞِﻤْﺴَﺒُﻳ َﻞَﻤْﺴَﺑ ْﻞِﻗْﺮَﻌُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﻗْﺮَﻋ ٌﻞَﻗْﺮَﻌُﻣ ٌﻞِﻗْﺮَﻌُﻣ ًﺔَﻠَﻗْﺮَﻋ ُﻞِﻗْﺮَﻌُﻳ َﻞَﻗْﺮَﻋ It is noteworthy at this juncture to draw your attention to the fact that there are some ﻰﻋﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ (four lettered verbs) which are not ﺩﺮﺠﻣ but ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻣ ﻰﺛﻼﺛ.
For example, we have َﻞﱠﻌَﻓ, َﻞَﻌْﻓَﺃ, َﻞَﻋﺎَﻓ which are conjugated as follows: ْﻞﱢﻌْﻔُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞﱢﻌَﻓ ٌﻞﱠﻌَﻔُﻣ ٌﻞﱢﻌَﻔُﻣ ًﻼﻴِﻌْﻔَﺗ ُﻞﱢﻌَﻔُﻳ َﻞﱠﻌَﻓ ْﻞِﻌْﻔُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﻌْﻓَﺃ ٌﻞَﻌْﻔُﻣ ٌﻞِﻌْﻔُﻣ ًﻻﺎَﻌْﻓِﺇ ُﻞِﻌْﻔُﻳ َﻞَﻌْﻓَﺃ ْﻞِﻋﺎَﻔُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ٌﻞَﻋﺎَﻔُﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻔُﻣ ًﺔَﻠَﻋﺎَﻔُﻣ ُﻞِﻋﺎَﻔُﻳ َﻞَﻋﺎَﻓ Examples are َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ (to teach) from ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻰﺛﻼﺛ َﺱَﺭَﺩ to learn/to study َﻞَﺳْﺭَﺃ (to send) from ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻰﺛﻼﺛ َﻞَﺳَﺭ to be long or send off َﻞَﺗﺎَﻗ (to fight) from ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻰﺛﻼﺛ َﻞَﺘَﻗ to kill ْﺱﱢﺭَﺪُﺗ َﻻ ْﺱﱢﺭَﺩ ٌﺱﱠﺭَﺪُﻣ ٌﺱﱢﺭَﺪُﻣ ﺎًﺴﻳِﺭْﺪَﺗ ُﺱﱢﺭَﺪُﻳ َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ ْﻞِﺳْﺮُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﺳْﺭَﺃ ٌﻞَﺳْﺮُﻣ ٌﻞِﺳْﺮُﻣ ًﻻﺎَﺳْﺭِﺇ ُﻞِﺳْﺮُﻳ َﻞَﺳْﺭَﺃ ْﻞِﺗﺎَﻘُﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﺗﺎَﻗ ٌﻞَﺗﺎَﻘُﻣ ٌﻞِﺗﺎَﻘُﻣ ًﺔَﻠَﺗﺎَﻘُﻣ ُﻞِﺗﺎَﻘُﻳ َﻞَﺗﺎَﻗ You must appreciate the significance of ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻣ.
It is to create fresh deals/meanings e.g.
: َﻞَﺘَﻗ means (he) killed …ُﻪَﻠَﺘَﻗ َﻞَﺗﺎَﻗ means (he) fought …ُﻪَﻠَﺗﺎَﻗ َﻞَﺳْﺭَﺃ means (he) sent him …ُﻪَﻠَﺳْﺭَﺃ َﺱَﺭَﺩ means (he) studied/leant …ُﻪَﺳَﺭَﺩ 18 ARA012: Arabic Morphology َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ means (he) taught him …َﻮْﺤﱠﻨﻟﺍ ُﻪَﺳﱠﺭَﺩ Self Assessment Exercise Conjugate the following verbs fully vowelized َﻝَﺰْﻟَﺯ ،َﻙَﺮْﺷَﺃ ،َﻊﱠﻄَﻗ ،َﻕَﺮَﺳ 3.2 ﻰﺳﺎﻤﺨﻟﺍ ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ ﻰﺳﺎﻤﺨﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ i.e.
Five lettered verb has, coincidentally, five ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ.
But you should pay attention to the following points: (1) All the various types of ﻰﺳﺎﻤﺨﻟﺍ are ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻣ; none of them is ﺩﺮﺠﻣ.
In other words, there is no ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻰﺳﺎﻤﺧ .

4.0 Conclusion You will observe that in the conjugation ofﻰﺳﺍﺪﺴﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ , it is only verbs of ﻞﻌﻔﺘﺳﺍ scale that have ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ.
Others do not have ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ.
But how do you know the verb with ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ and those that do not have?
The surest mechanism is through the meaning.
For example, if you say ‘I laughed and I drank’.
In the first sentence, you just laugh and the action of laughter ends with you.
Whereas, in the second sentence, you drank; you must have drunk some liquid, water, tea or milk.
So, to drink ُﺏَﺮْﺸَﻳ needs ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ while to laugh َﻚِﺤَﺿ does not require ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ.
5.0 Summary In this unit, you have been taken through ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ from three lettered to six lettered ones.
And the mechanism of conjugation has been sufficiently treated.
However, your ability to navigate conveniently in the aspects of ﻑﺮﺻ we have treated so far requires extensive reading because some aspects of ﻑﺮﺻ are based on what is known as ﻰﻋﺎﻤﺳ i.e.
oral tradition which does not follow clearly defined patterns or rules.

The beauty of this classification is that the learner can navigate across the various categories with minimum assistance and guidance because every category is distinct and easy to grasp with illustrations that are lucid and handy.
What makes this classification more interesting is the examples that can be easily drawn from materials in unit 3 module 1 above.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define with illustration ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ • define with illustration ﻒﻌﻀﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﺯﻮﻤﻬﻤﻟﺍ ,ﻢﻟﺎﺴﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ • define with illustration ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ 3.0 Main Content 1.1 ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ Simply defined, ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ means the verb that is sound and free of any form of defect.
The verb is sound when it is particularly free from the ﻑﻭﺮﺣ ﺔ�ﻠﻋwhich are .ﻯﺍﻭ Verbs like ﺐ�ﻫﺫ or ﺲ�ﻠﺟ which you have come across in the ﺩﺮ��ﺠﻣ ﻞ��ﻌﻓ segment provide appropriate illustrations.
The difference between ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻞﻌﻓ and ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ ﻞﻌﻓ is in ﺓﺭﺎ�ﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ i.e ﺎَﻬﻴِﻧﻮُﻤ ُﺘْﻟَﺄ�َﺳ and ﺔ�ﻠﻌﻟ ﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ i.e ﻱﺍﻭ.
As already explained, a verb is declared ﺩﺮ�ﺠﻣ when it is free from ﺓﺩﺎ�ﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ such as ﻞ�ﻌﺟ , ﻕﺯﺭ and it is ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ if it is free of ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ.
So while ﻰ�ﻀﻗ is qualified for ﺩﺮ�ﺠﻣ, it (i.e.
ﻰ�ﻀﻗ) is not qualified for ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ because of the ﺔ��ﻠﻋ ﻑﺮ��ﺣ in its ﻞ��ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ.
Let us consider the following sentences: Then Imam rode on a camel to the ﺪﺠﺴﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻟﺇ ﻼﻤﺟ ﻡﺎﻣﻹﺍ ﺐﻛﺭ mosque Zaynab laughed for her success in ﺎَﻬِﺣﺎَﺠَﻨِﻟ ُﺐَﻨْﻳَﺯ ْﺖَﻜِﺤَﺿ 22 ARA012: Arabic Morphology school certificate Examination ﱢﻱِﻮَﻧﺎﱠﺜﻟﺍ ِﻥﺎَﺤِﺘْﻣِﻹﺍ ﻲِﻓ I thanked God for the favour of Islam ِﻡَﻼْﺳِﻹﺍ ِﺔَﻤْﻌِﻧ ﻰَﻠَﻋ َﻪﻠﱠﻟﺍ ُﺕْﺪِﻤَﺣ God sent forth examples for people ِﺱﺎﱠﻨﻠِﻟ َﻝﺎَﺜْﻣَﻷﺍ ُﻪﻠﱠﻟﺍ َﺏَﺮَﺿ Mobile phone is made in Nigeria ﺎَﻳِﺮﻴِﺠْﻴَﻧ ﻲِﻓ ُﻊَﻨْﺼُﺗ ُﺔَﻟﺍﱠﻮَﺠْﻟَﺍ God assisted Muslims at Badr ِﺭْﺪَﺑ َﻡْﻮَﻳ َﻦﻴِﻤِﻠْﺴُﻤْﻟﺍ ُﻪﱠﻠﻟﺍ َﺮَﺼَﻧ Muslims learnt their life lesson at َﻡْﻮَﻳ ُﻩﻮَﺴْﻨَﻳ ْﻦَﻟ ﺎًﺳْﺭَﺩ َﻥﻮُﻤِﻠْﺴُﻤْﻟﺍ َﺱَﺭَﺩ Hunayn ِﻦْﻴَﻨُﺣ Your Lord has decreed that you ُﻩﺎﱠﻳِﺇ ﱠﻻِﺇ ﺍﻭُﺪُﺒْﻌَﺗ َﻻ ْﻥَﺃ َﻚﱡﺑَﺭ ﻰَﻀَﻗَﻭ worship none but Him.
3.1.1 Analysis You will notice that in the sentences above, all the verbs except ﻰ�ﻀﻗ are sound.
They include .
ﺱﺭﺩ ،ﺮ�ﺼﻧ ( ﻊﻨ�ﺻ) ﻊﻨ�ﺼﺗ ( ﺏﺮ�ﺿ) ﺏﺮ�ﻀﻳ ،ﺪ�ﻤﺣ ،ﻚﺤ�ﺿ ،ﺐﻛﺭ.
All of them are free of any defect i.e ﺔ�ﻠﻌﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ.
Therefore, it should be very easy for you to identify ﺢﻴﺤﺻ ﻞﻌﻓ.
Regarding the conjugation of ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ you can use all examples already used in ﺩﺮﺠﻣ above Self Assessment Exercise Identify from Suratul 'A'la five sound and healthy verbs ( ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ ﻞﻌﻓ ) and conjugate them.
3.2 ﻢﻟﺎﺳ ﻞﻌﻓ Fi'lun Saalim is known as a safe and regular verb.
It is so called because it is, like ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ, free of ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ.
It is also free of ﺓﺰ�ﻤﻫ and ﻒﻴﻌ�ﻀﺗ e.g ﺮ�ﺼﻧ, ﺲ�ﻠﺟ ، ﺐ�ﻛﺭ.
You can use them as follows: Ahmad assisted his brother ُﻩﺎَﺧَﺃ ُﺪَﻤْﺣَﺃ َﺮَﺼَﻧ The guest sat on the chair ﱢﻲِﺳْﺮُﻜْﻟﺍ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ُﻒْﻴﱠﻀﻟﺍ َﺲَﻠَﺟ Sulaiman rode his horse ُﻪَﻧﺎَﺼِﺣ ُﻥﺎَﻤْﻴَﻠُﺳ َﺐِﻛَﺭ It should be noted that ﺯﻮ�ﻤﻬﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ like ﻞ�ﻛﺃ and ُﻒﱠﻌ�َﻀُﻣ like ﱠﺮ�ﻓ are not ﻢِﻟﺎ�َﺳ but they are ﺢﻴﺤـﺻ .
This concept can be graphically illustrated as follows: 23 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ﺢﻴﺤﺻ ﺯﻮـﻤـﻬﻣ ﻞــــﻛﺃ ﻝﺄــﺳ ﺃﺮـــﻗ ﻒﻌﻀﻣ ﻢــﻟﺎــﺳ ﱠﺮــــﻓ ﺪــﻌـــﻗ ﱠﺮـــﻣ ﺡﺮـــﻓ ﱠﻚـــﻓ ﺪـﻌـﺻ Like ﻢﻟﺎ�ﺳ, ﺯﻮ�ﻤﻬﻣ does not contain any ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﺮ�ﺣ.
It is defined as the verb that has hamzah as its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ e.g.
َﺮَﻣَﺃ or its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ e.g ﻝﺄﺳ or as its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ e.g ﺃﺮﻗ Abdul Razaq ate rice ﺯﺮﻟﺍ ﻕﺍﺯﺮﻟﺍ ﺪﺒﻋ ﻞﻛﺃ Zayd asked the teacher about interest ﺎﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﻦﻋ ﺫﺎﺘﺳﻷﺍ ﺪﻳﺯ ﻝﺄﺳ The broadcaster read the news bulletine ﺭﺎﺒﺧﻷﺍ ﻊﻳﺬﻤﻟﺍ ﺃﺮﻗ Don't you see ﺯﻮ�ﻤﻬﻣ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ really working like a typical ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ with all its radicals taking fat-hah.
You should be able to identify ﺯﻮﻤﻬﻣ ﻞﻌﻓ from among hundreds of verbs.
Regarding ﻒﻌ�ﻀﻤﻟﺍ, it is like ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ because it has its three radicals like ( َﺩَﺪ�َﻣ) but the two identical radicals i.e.
ﺩﺩ are integrated into one known as ﻒﻌ�ﻀﻣ.
Again, you should be able to identify ٌﻒﱠﻌَﻀُﻣ with ease.
Example of ُﻒﱠﻌَﻀُﻣ :ﱠﺮَﻓ ﱠﺮَﻣ ﱠﻝَﺩ 24 ARA012: Arabic Morphology The thief fled from prison ِﻦْﺠﱢﺴﻟﺍ ْﻦِﻣ ُﻕِﺭﺎﱠﺴﻟﺍ ﱠﺮَﻓ The week passed like a flash ِﺮَﺼَﺒْﻟﺍ ِﺢْﻤَﻠَﻛ ُﻉﻮُﺒْﺳُﻷﺍ ﱠﺮَﻣ The parent guided his son on the way ِﻖﻳِﺮﱠﻄﻟﺍ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ﻪَﻨْﺑِﺍ ُﺪِﻟﺍَﻮْﻟﺍ ﱠﻝَﺩ It should be noted that there are ﻲﺛﻼﺛ ﻒﻌﻀﻣ and ﻲﻋﺎﺑﺭ ﻒﻌﻀﻣ.
ﻲ�ﺛﻼﺜﻟﺍ ﻒﻌﻀﻤﻟﺍ has been explained/illustrated above.
Regarding ﻲﻋﺎ�ﺑﺮﻟﺍ ﻒﻌﻀﻤﻟﺍ, is the ﻲﻋﺎ�ﺑﺭ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ that has ﻦﻴ�ﻋ ﻪ�ﻠﻌﻓ and ﻲﻧﺎ�ﺜﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ from the same radical and ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎ�ﻓ and ﻝﻭﻷ ﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ from the same radical Example: َﻕ َﺮــــْﻗ َﺭ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻﻧﺎﺜﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻷﺍ ﻞ ﻭ ﻝ َﺺــَﺤـــْﺼـــَﺣ َﻡ َﺩ ْﻡ َﺩ The water spred ءﺎﻤﻟﺍ ﻕﺮﻗﺭ The truth is manifest ﻖﺤﻟﺍ ﺺﺤﺼﺣ Their Lord punished them for their sin ﻢﻬﺒﻧﺬﺑ ﻢﻬﺑﺭ ﻢﻬﻴﻠﻋ ﻲﻠﻋ ﻡﺪﻣﺩ Self Assessment Exercise Give two examples for each of ﻢﻟﺎﺳ ﻞﻌﻓ , ﺯﻮﻤﻬﻣ , ﻒﻌﻀﻣ and use them in sentences.
3.2 (ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ) This is the verb that is weak or deficient as a result of having ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﺮ�ﺣ as one or two of its radicals.
You will recall that ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﻭ ﺮ�ﺣ are three.
They are ﻱ ﺍ ﻭ.
However, ﻞ�ﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ is of four types: these are ﺺﻗﺎ�ﻧ , ﻑﻮ�ﺟﺃ , ﻒ�ﻴﻔﻟ and ﻝﺎ�ﺜﻣ.
We can express it graphically as follows: ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﺺـﻗﺎﻧ ﻑﻮـﺟﺃ ﻒﻴﻔـﻟ ﺺـﻗﺎﻧ ﻕﻭﺮﻔﻣ ﻥﻭﺮﻘﻣ 25 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ﺺﻗﺎﻨﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ is the verb that has ﻱ or ﻒﻟﺃ as its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ e.g ﻰﻀﻗ , ﻰﻣﺭ , ﻰﻋﺩ , ﺍﺪﺑ , ﻰﻔﺟ.
Your Lord has decreed that you worship ﻩﺎﻳﺇ ﻻﺇ ﺍﻭﺪﺒﻌﺗ ﻻ ﻥﺃ ﻚﺑﺭ ﻰﻀﻗﻭ none but Him You threw not when you did throw, but ﻰﻣﺭ ﷲﺍ ﻦﻜﻟﻭ ﺖﻴﻣﺭ ﺫﺇ ﺖﻴﻣﺭ ﺎﻣﻭ Allah threw And Noah called his son who had ﻝﺰﻌﻣ ﻲﻓ ﻮﻫﻭ ﻪﻨﺑﺍ ﺡﻮﻧ ﺎﻋﺩﻭ separated himself It appeared to me that the winter season ﺏﺮﺘﻗﺍ ﺪﻗ ءﺎﺘﺸﻟﺍ ﺖﻗﻭ ﻥﺃ ﻲﻟ ﺍﺪﺑ is near.
ﺺﻗﺎﻨﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ means the hollow verb i.e the verb that has ﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ as its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ e.g ﻝﺎﻗ ،ﺭﺎﺳ ،ﻡﺎﻧ ،ﻡﺎﻗ ،ﺏﺎﺗ 26 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Muhammad said that resurrection is real ﱞﻖَﺣ َﺚْﻌَﺒْﻟﺍ ﱠﻥِﺇ ُﺪﱠﻤَﺤُﻣ َﻝﺎَﻗ Yusuf walked to the school quickly ﺎًﻋِﺮْﺴُﻣ ِﺔَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻤْﻟﺍ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ُﻒُﺳﻮُﻳ َﺭﺎَﺳ Khalid slept during the lesson in the class ِﻞْﺼَﻔْﻟﺍ ﻲِﻓ ِﺱْﺭﱠﺪﻟﺍ َءﺎَﻨْﺛَﺃ ُﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ َﻡﺎَﻧ Sa'd rose from his sleep early ﺍًﺮﱢﻜَﺒُﻣ ِﻪِﻣْﻮَﻧ ْﻦِﻣ ُﺪْﻌَﺳ َﻡﺎَﻗ The sinner repented to him Lord ِﻪﱢﺑَﺭ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ُﺐِﻧْﺬُﻤْﻟﺍ َﺏﺎَﺗ ﻒ�ﻴﻔﻠﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ This is the verb that has two ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﺎ�ﻓﺮﺣ in its foundation radicals (i.e the foundation letters).
It is of two types: namely ﻥﻭﺮ�ﻘﻣ i.e ﻒ�ﻴﻔﻠﻟﺍ which has its two weak radicals follow each other e.g ،ﻯﻭﺭ ،ﻯﻮﻧ ،ﻯﻮﻏ He who toys with knowledge has goofed ﻯَﻮَﻏ ْﺪَﻘَﻓ ِﻢْﻠِﻌْﻟﺎِﺑ َﻥﺎَﻬَﺘْﺳﺍ ِﻦَﻣ Ahmad intended to perform pilgrimage ُﻡﺎَﻌْﻟﺍ ﺍَﺬَﻫ َﻡﺍَﺮَﺤْﻟﺍ ِﷲﺍ َﺖْﻴَﺑ ﱠﺞُﺤَﻳ ْﻥَﺃ ُﺪَﻤْﺣَﺃ ﻯَﻮَﻧ this year Abu Hurayrah narrated more than a ِﺚﻳِﺪَﺣ ِﻒْﻟَﺃ ْﻦِﻣ َﺮَﺜْﻛَﺃ َﺓَﺮْﻳَﺮُﻫ ﻮُﺑَﺃ ﻯَﻭَﺭ thousand Hadith The second type of ﻒ�ﻴﻔﻟ is the one called ﻕﻭﺮ�ﻔﻣ i.e the one in which the two week letters are separated by a sound letter e.g ﻰَﻓَﻭ ،ﻰَﻋَﻭ ,ﻰَﻗَﻭ The father saved his noble son from ِﻙَﻼَﻬْﻟﺍ َﻦِﻣ ﱠﺭﺎَﺒْﻟﺍ ُﻪَﻨْﺑِﺇ ﱡﺏَﻷْﺍ ﻰَﻗَﻭ destruction Abdulkarim learnt by heart the entire ﺎَﻬﱠﻠُﻛ َﺔﱠﻳِﻮْﺤﱠﻨﻟﺍ َﺪِﻋﺍَﻮَﻘْﻟﺍ ِﻢﻳِﺮَﻜْﻟﺍ ُﺪْﺒَﻋ ﻰَﻋَﻭ Nahw rules A muslim fullfils his promise َﺪْﻋَﻭ ﺍَﺫِﺇ ﻰَﻓَﻭ ُﻢِﻠْﺴُﻤْﻟﺍ ﻝﺎ�ﺜﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ This is so called because it looks like ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ for having all its radicals given ﺔﺤﺘﻓ like ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻓ despite its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ been ﺔﻠﻋ ﻑﺮﺣ e.g.

4.0 Conclusion You must have noticed that both ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ and ﻞ�ﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ have branches ( ﻡﺎ�ﺴﻗﺃ).
I would like to believe that each of them has been clearly defined and sufficiently 27 ARA012: Arabic Morphology illustrated for you in a manner that enables you to easily identify each with its characteristics 5.0 Summary As a matter of tradition, every verb has the appropriate measure (ﻥﺯﻭ) that goes with it.

They were all backed up with considerable illustrations.
In this unit, you will be taken through conjugation of the verbs just referred to above.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • conjugate ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ with all its branches; • conjugate ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ with all its branches; and • conjugate ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Conjugation of ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ As a reminder, ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ is the verb that is free from ﺔ�ﻠﻌﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ which are three; namely ﻯﺍﻭ.
But ﻢﻟﺎ�ﺴﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ is the verb that is free of ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ like Saheeh.
The difference, however, is in ﺓﺰﻤﻫ and ﻒﻴﻌ�ﻀﺗ.
While ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ accommodates ﺓﺰ�ﻤﻫ as in َﻞَﻛَﺃ and ﻒﻴﻌﻀﺗ as in ﱠﺮ �َﺳ, ﻢﻟﺎ�ﺴﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ does not.
In other words, ﻢﻟﺎ�ﺴﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ constitutes a branch of ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ while ﺯﻮ�ﻤﻬﻤﻟﺍ and ﻒﻌ�ﻀﻤﻟﺍ are other branches of ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ.
But then, each of them is conjugated as follows.
3.1.1 Since ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ with all its branches is like ﺩﺮ�ﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ which has been extensively conjugated in Module 1, Unit 3 all that is necessary here is provision of one or two samples of ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ e.g ﺮﺳ -ﻞﻛﺃ -ﺪﻌﺳ -ﻂﻘﺳ ﻞﻌﻔﻳ - ﻞﻌﻓ - ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ - ُﻂُﻘْﺴَﻳ - َﻂَﻘَﺳ ﻂﻘﺴﺗ ﻻ - ﻂﻘﺳﺃ - ﻁﻮﻘﺴﻣ - ﻂﻗﺎﺳ - ﺎﻃﻮﻘﺳ - ﻂﻘﺴﻳ - ﻂﻘﺳ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ - َﻞِﻌَﻓ - ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ - ُﺪَﻌْﺴَﻳ - َﺪِﻌَﺳ 29 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ْﺪَﻌْﺴَﺗ َﻻ ْﺪَﻌْﺳِﺇ ٌﺩﻮُﻌْﺴَﻣ ٌﺪﻴِﻌَﺳ ٌﺪِﻋﺎَﺳ ًﺓَﺩﺎَﻌَﺳ ُﺪَﻌْﺴَﻳ َﺪِﻌَﺳ ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ُﻞُﻛْﺄَﻳ َﻞَﻛَﺃ ُﻞُﻛْﺄَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞُﻛ ٌﻝﻮُﻛْﺄَﻣ ٌﻞِﻛﺁ ًﻼْﻛَﺃ ُﻞُﻛْﺄَﻳ َﻞَﻛَﺃ ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ﱡﺮُﺴَﻳ ﱠﺮَﺳ ﱠﺮُﺴَﺗ َﻻ ﱠﺮَﺳ ُﺭﻭُﺮْﺴَﻣ ٌﺭﺎَﺳ ﺍًﺭﻭُﺮُﺳ ﱡﺮُﺴَﻳ ﱠﺮَﺳ You should note that ﺭﺪ�ﺼﻣ of ﺪﻌ�ﺳ is both ﺍﺪﻌ�ﺳ and ﺓﺩﺎﻌ�ﺳ which puts its ﻥﺯﻭ at ًﻼ �ْﻌَﻓ and ًﺔَﻟﺎَﻌَﻓ.
In the same token, the ﺭﺪﺼﻣ of ﺮﺳ which is ﺭﻭﺮﺳ puts its ﻥﺯﻭ at ُﻝﻮُﻌُﻓ and its ﺮﻣﻷﺍ ﻞﻌﻓ at ﱠﻊَﻓ Self Assessment Exercise Conjugate the following verbs with their appropriate ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ: َﺃَﺮَﻗ ،ﱠﺮَﻓ ،َﺪَﺠَﺳ ،َﺰَﻛَﺭ ،َﻊَﻤَﻃ ،َﻊَﻄَﻗ 3.2 ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ To be conjugated in this segment are the branches of ﻞ�ﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ which include , ﻑﻮ�ﺟﺃ ﻝﺎﺜﻣ and ﺺﻗﺎﻧ First, ﻝﺎﺜﻤﻟﺍ which is in the category ﻞ�ﺘﻌﻣ for having ﻭ , which is a ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﺮ�ﺣ as one of its radicals i.e the constituent letters.
But it is called ﻝﺎ�ﺜﻣ because it appears like ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺻ for having all its radicals including ﻭ vowelized like sound verb ( ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ).
In other branches of ﻞ�ﺘﻌﻣsuch as ﻑﻮ�ﺟﺃ , ﺺﻗﺎ�ﻧ and ﻒ�ﻴﻔﻟ either the middle or the last letter is not vowelized e. g. ﻞﺟﻭ ،ﻊﻗﻭ ،ﻊﺿﻭ ،ﻡﺭﻭ ،ﻖﻣﻭ ،ﺪﺟﻭ ،ﻒﺻﻭ I have selected these ﻝﺎﺜﻣ verbs because they present different patterns of ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴ�ﻋ.
For example: َﺪَﺟَﻭ ُﻖِﻤَﻳ َﻖِﻣَﻭ ُﻊَﻀَﻳ َﻊَﺿَﻭ ُﻞَﺟْﻮَﻳ َﻞِﺟَﻭ ُﻒِﺼَﻳ َﻒَﺻَﻭ ُﺙِﺮَﻳ َﺙِﺭَﻭ ُﻊَﻘَﻳ َﻊَﻗَﻭ ُﺪِﺠَﻳ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ْﻊَﻘَﺗ َﻻ ْﻊَﻗ ٌﻊِﻗﺍَﻭ ﺎًﻌْﻗَﻭ ﺎًﻋﻮُﻗُﻭ ُﻊَﻘَﻳ َﻊَﻗَﻭ ْﻞَﻌَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞَﻋ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ًﻻﻮُﻌُﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ْﺙِﺮَﺗ َﻻ ْﺙِﺭ ٌﺙﻭُﺭْﻮَﻣ ٌﺙِﺭﺍَﻭ ﺎًﺛﺍَﺭِﻭ ًﺔَﺛﺍَﺭِﻭ ُﺙِﺮَﻳ َﺙِﺭَﻭ ْﻞِﻌَﺗ َﻻ ﻞﻋ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ ﻞﻋﺎﻓ ﻼﻌﻓ ﺔﻟﺎﻌﻓ ﻞﻌﻔﻳ ﻞﻌﻓ ْﺪِﺠَﺗ َﻻ ْﺪِﺟ ٌﺩﻮُﺟْﻮَﻣ ٌﺪِﺟﺍَﻭ ﺍًﺩﻮُﺟُﻭ ُﺪِﺠَﻳ َﺪَﺟَﻭ ْﻞِﺟْﻮَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﺟْﻭَﺃ ٌﻞِﺟﺍَﻭ ًﻼْﺟَﻭ ُﻞَﺟْﻮَﻳ َﻞِﺟَﻭ 30 ARA012: Arabic Morphology There are three patterns in ﻝﺎ�ﺜﻤﻟﺍ as far as ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴ�ﻋ is concerned.
They include ﻊ�ﻗﻭ ﻊﻘﻳ based on ُﺪ �ِﺠَﻳ َﺪَﺟَﻭ based on ُﻞ �ِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞ �َﻌَﻓ, ُﻞ �َﺟْﻮَﻳ َﻞ �ِﺟَﻭ which presents a unique pattern as it retains its ﻭ at ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ while all others lost their ﻭ at ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ.
Secondly, ﻑﻮ�ﺟﻷﺍ which is so called because it is hollow i.e a hole-like case at the middle e.g ﻡﺎﻨﻳ ﻡﺎﻧ ﺮﻴﺴﻳ ﺭﺎﺳ ﻝﻮﻘﻳ ﻝﺎﻗ You will notice that ﻑﻮﺟﻷﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ presents three patterns of ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ.
These are: ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ْﻞُﻘَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞُﻗ ٌﻝﻮُﻘَﻣ ٌﻞِﺋﺎَﻗ ًﻻْﻮَﻗ ُﻝﻮُﻘَﻳ َﻝﺎَﻗ ْﻞُﻔَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞُﻓ ٌﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ْﺮِﺴَﺗ َﻻ ْﺮِﺳ ٌﺮِﺋﺎَﺳ ﺍًﺮْﻴَﺳ ُﺮﻴِﺴَﻳ َﺭﺎَﺳ ْﻞِﻔَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞِﻓ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ْﻢَﻨَﺗ َﻻ ْﻢَﻧ ٌﻢِﺋﺎَﻧ ﺎًﻣْﻮَﻧ ُﻡﺎَﻨَﻳ َﻡﺎَﻧ ْﻞَﻔَﺗ َﻻ ْﻞَﻓ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ What you do with ﻥﺯﻭ in this case is to reduce the main verb e.g ﻝﺎﻗ to ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ and what happens to ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ in the main verb will be replicated to ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴ�ﻋ of the ﻥﺯﻭ .
So ْﻞُﻗ ْﻞُﻓ, ْﻢَﻧ ْﻞَﻓ, ْﺮِﺳ ْﻞِﻓ Self Assessment Exercise Conjugate the following verbs with their appropriate ﻥﺍﺯﻭﺃ َﻡﺎَﻗ - َﺡﺎَﺻ - َﻝﺎَﺟ - َﺐَﺛَﻭ - َﻖِﻣَﻭ - َﺪَﻋَﻭ 3.3 Next, we take on ﺺﻗﺎﻨﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ which has ﺔﻠﻋ ﻑﺮﺣ in its ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ e.g ﻰَﻠَﺻ - ﻰَﻤَﻧ - ﺍَﺪَﻏ - ﻰَﻌَﺳ - ﻰَﻀَﻗ - ﻰَﻣَﺭ ﺎَﻤَﻧ ﻭُﺪْﻐَﻳ ﺍَﺪَﻏ ﻰَﻠْﺼَﻳ ﻰَﻠَﺻ ﻰَﻌْﺴَﻳ ﻰَﻌَﺳ ﻰِﻀْﻘَﻳ ﻰَﻀَﻗ ﻰِﻣْﺮَﻳ ﻰَﻣَﺭ ﻮُﻤْﻨَﻳ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻡْﺮَﺗ َﻻ ِﻡْﺭِﺇ ﱞﻰِﻣْﺮَﻣ ﻰِﻣﺍَﺭ ﺎًﻴْﻣَﺭ ﻰِﻣْﺮَﻳ ﻰَﻣَﺭ ِﻊْﻔَﺗ َﻻ ِﻊْﻓِﺇ ٌﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ِﺾْﻘَﺗ َﻻ ِﺾْﻗِﺇ ﱞﻰِﻀْﻘَﻣ ﻰِﺿﺎَﻗ ًءﺎَﻀَﻗ ﻰِﻀْﻘَﻳ ﻰَﻀَﻗ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ َﻊْﺴَﺗ َﻻ َﻊْﺳِﺇ ____ ﻰِﻋﺎَﺳ ﺎًﻴْﻌَﺳ ﻰَﻌْﺴَﻳ ﻰَﻌَﺳ َﻊْﻔَﺗ َﻻ َﻊْﻓِﺇ ____ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ 31 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ُﺪْﻐَﺗ َﻻ ُﺪْﻏُﺃ ًﺓَﻭﺍَﺪَﻏ ﻭُﺪْﻐَﻳ ﺍَﺪَﻏ You will notice that ﺺﻗﺎﻧ ﻞﻌﻓ presents three patterns of ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ in its ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ which are ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ - ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ - ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ 3.3.1 ﻒﻴﻔﻠﻟﺍ is the verb that harbours two ﺔﻠﻋ ﻑﺮﺣ.
It is called ﻥﻭﺮﻘﻤﻟﺍ ﻒﻴﻔﻠﻟﺍ if the two ﺔﻠﻋ ﻑﺮﺣ follow each other e.g.
ﻯَﻭَﺭ - ﻯَﻮَﻏ - ﻯَﻮَﻧ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻮْﻨَﺗ َﻻ ِﻮْﻧِﺇ ﱞﻯِﻮْﻨَﻣ ﻯِﻭﺎَﻧ ًﺔﱠﻴِﻧ ﻯِﻮْﻨَﻳ ﻯَﻮَﻧ ِﻊْﻔَﺗ َﻻ ِﻊْﻓِﺇ ُﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ُﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﺔَﻠْﻌِﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻮْﻐَﺗ َﻻ ِﻮْﻏِﺇ ___ َﻯِﻭﺎَﻏ ًﺔَﻳﺍَﻮَﻏ ﻯِﻮْﻐَﻳ ﻯَﻮَﻏ ِﻊْﻔَﺗ َﻻ ِﻊْﻓِﺇ ___ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﺔَﻟﺎَﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻭْﺮَﺗ َﻻ ِﻭْﺭِﺇ ﱞﻯِﻭْﺮَﻣ ﻯِﻭﺍَﺭ ًﺔَﻳﺍَﻭِﺭ ﻯِﻭْﺮَﻳ ﻯَﻭَﺭ ِﻊْﻔَﺗ َﻻ ِﻊْﻓِﺇ ٌﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﺔَﻟﺎَﻌِﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ It is called ﻕﻭﺮﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻒﻴﻔﻠﻟﺍ if the two ﺔﻠﻋ ﻑﺮﺣ are separated by a regular radical e.g ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻒَﺗ َﻻ ِﻑ ﱞﻲِﻓْﻮَﻣ ﻰِﻓﺍَﻭ ًءﺎَﻓَﻭ ﻰِﻔَﻳ ﻰَﻓَﻭ ِﻊَﺗ َﻻ ِﻉ ٌﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻻﺎَﻌِﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻖَﺗ َﻻ ِﻕ ﱞﻲِﻗْﻮَﻣ ﻰِﻗﺍَﻭ ًﺔَﻳﺎَﻗِﻭ ﻰِﻘَﻳ ﻰَﻗَﻭ ِﻊَﺗ َﻻ ِﻉ ٌﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﺔَﻟﺎَﻌِﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ﻥﺯﻭ ﻰﻠﻋ ِﻊَﺗ َﻻ ِﻉ ﱞﻲِﻋْﻮَﻣ ﻰِﻋﺍَﻭ ﺎًﻴْﻋَﻭ ﻰِﻌَﻳ ﻰَﻋَﻭ ِﻊَﺗ َﻻ ِﻉ ٌﻝﻮُﻌْﻔَﻣ ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ ًﻼْﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ What is peculiar in ﻕ ﻭﺮ�ﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻒ�ﻴﻔﻠﻟﺍ is that it loses its two ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﺮ�ﺣ in its ﺮ�ﻣﺇ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ.
Correspondingly, in its wazn, it also loses both of them.
Self Assessment Exercise ﻯﺮﺒﻜﻟﺍ ﻪﺑﺭ ﺕﺎﻳﺍ ﻦﻣ ﻯﺃﺭ ﺪﻗﻭ.......ﻯﻮﻏ ﺎﻣﻭ ﻢﻜﺒﺣﺎﺻ ﻞﺿ ﺎﻣ ﻯﻮﻫ ﺍﺫﺇ ﻢﺠﻨﻟﺍﻭ Conjugate the underlined verbs in the above verses of the Qur'an and explain the status of each verb.
4.0 Conclusion It is interesting to note that ﻞ�ﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ in all its branches has ﻪ�ﻴﻓ ﺪ�ﻳﺰﻣ just the way ﺢﻴﺤ�ﺼﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ has.
However, that has to be taken on separately in another unit for explicit explanation.
5.0 Summary 32 ARA012: Arabic Morphology One peculiarity posed in this segment is that ﻥﺯﻮ�ﻟﺍ or ﻥﺍﺯﻭﻻﺍ (in its plural form) take shape and status of the ﻥﻭﺯﻮ�ﻤﻟﺍ i.e the target verb, For example, if the ﻥﻭﺯﻮ�ﻣ (target verb) is ﻰ�ﻋﻭ which loses its two ﺔ�ﻠﻋ ﻑﺮ�ﺣ in its ﺮ�ﻣﻷﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ , the two letters will similarly be lost in the ﺮ�ﻣﻷﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻓ of the ﻥﺯﻭ.
You must have noticed, therefore, that ﻥﺯﻭ becomes a follower following the target verb in any situation or case.
6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment Explain the status of each of the following verbs and conjugate them citing the appropriate ﻥﺯﻭ to each.

We have also treated ﺢﻴﺤ��ﺻ and ﻞ��ﺘﻌﻣ.
In this unit, we shall focus on the classification of ﻞﻌﻓ into ﻯﺪﻌﺘﻣ and ﻡﺯﻻ.
First, we examine ﻯﺪﻌﺘﻣ 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the meaning of ﻯﺪﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ with illustrations; • identify ﻯﺪﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ that governs two ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ; and • conjugate all the verbs used 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ﻯّﺪ�ﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ is the verb that requires an object known as ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮ�ﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ in a sentence.
This is the verb that can not stand with its subject ﻞ�ﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ alone without an object i.e ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮ�ﻌﻔﻣ.
It is known as transitive verb i.e.
it transits or governs an object.
Transitive verb are in categories.
There is a category that governs only one object ( ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ) and it is the commonest.
And there is another category that governs more than one object.
ﻯﺪ�ﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ is better appreciated when it is learnt in a text.

It is the practice in our town that every Muslim intends giving his children Arabic and Islamic education at a very early age.
I was fortunate to attend a school where the provost finds leisure and joy in training young ones.
I studied the Qur'ān at the age of nine and a half years.
Oh!
I studied it in reading and not in memorization.
I have seen on the television screen young children who were not more than ten years old, reading the verses and chapters from memory.
As for me, naturally, I memorized some short chapters which I recite during the five daily obligatory prayers.
I wish I could memorise the Qur'ān as a whole one day and read it excellently well like the young children I saw on the television screen.

Again, in column three you will notice that some nouns in the position of ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮ�ﻌﻔﻣ such as ﺎ�ﻬﻴﻧﺎﻌﻣ and ﺕﺎ�ﻳﻻﺍ which ought to have taken fat-hah, did not, because of certain ﻮ�ﺤﻧ considerations which could be explained to you in details in a ﻮﺤﻧ class.
Let it be reiterated that the transitive verbs in this text are the ones that govern or require only one object ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ.

Intransitive verb known as ﻡﺯﻼ�ﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ which is the direct opposite of ﻯﺪ�ﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ is treated in this unit.
Also to be treated is how intransitive verb can change to transitive.
You will be taken through the mechanism of achieving that.
2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • identify ﻡﺯﻼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ • utilize the mechanism of changing it to transitive; • conjugate all verbs used for illustration 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ﻡﺯﻼﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ This is the direct opposite of ﻯﺪ�ﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ with which you are already familiar.
ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﺯ ﻼ�ﻟﺍ is the verb that does not require ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮ�ﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ in a sentence.
Taste is the main facilitator that assists you to identify ﻡﺯﻼ�ﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ.
For example, if Bilqis is reading and Fatimah is running.
Your taste must tell you that Bilqis must be reading something: a textbook, a news paper, a novel or a letter.
Whatever she is reading is ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮ�ﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ which means that the verb read is transitive; ﻯﺪ�ﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ.
On the other hand, running in the second sentence does not require an object of running as your taste will inform you.
Running begings and ends with the runner.
Therefore, to the extent that the verb run is intransitive ﻡﺯﻼﻟﺍ in Arabic, you say: Bilqis is reading the Qur’an ﻥﺍﺮﻘﻟﺍ ﺲﻴﻘﻠﺑ ﺃﺮﻘﺗ Fatimah is running ﻯﺮﺠﺗ ﺔﻤﻃﺎﻓ A text for illustration: 40 ARA012: Arabic Morphology The pilgrims returned to the country ﺲﻣﺃ ﻦﻃﻮﻟﺍ ﻰﻟﺇ ﺝﺎﺠﺤﻟﺍ ﻊﺟﺭ yesterday Khalid traveled to the USA ﺓﺪﺤﻤﻟﺍ ﺕﺎﻳﻻﻮﻟﺍ ﻰﻟﺇ ﺪﻟﺎﺧ ﺮﻓﺎﺳ Ahmad was happy for his success ﻪﺣﺎﺠﻨﺑ ﺪﻤﺣﺃ ﺮﺳ The News spreds ﺮﺒﺨﻟﺍ ﻉﺍﺫ The revelation came down ﻰﺣﻮﻟﺍ ﻝﺰﻧ Zayd stood up as a respect for his ﻩﺫﺎﺘﺳﻷ ﺎﻣﺍﺮﺘﺣﺍ ﺪﻳﺯ ﻡﺎﻗ teacher The Imam went to the mosque ﺪﺠﺴﻤﻟﺍ ﻰﻟﺇ ﻡﺎﻣﻹﺍ ﺐﻫﺫ The Prophet Nuh (AS) had a long life (ﻡﻼﺴﻟﺍ ﻪﻴﻠﻋ) ﺡﻮﻧ ﻰﺒﻨﻟﺍ ﺮﻤﻋ ﻝﺎﻃ 3.1.1 Analysis In all the eight sentences listed above, you will note that each of them contains the verb ﻞ�ﻌﻓ and the doer ﻞ�ﻋﺎﻓ without an object ﻪ�ﺑ ﻝﻮ�ﻌﻔﻣ.
That is ﻡﺯﻼ�ﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ in action.
The verbs are: Returned َﻊَﺟَﺭ Traveled َﺮَﻓﺎَﺳ Returned َﺩﺎَﻋ Felt happy ﱠﺮَﺳ Spread َﻉﺍَﺫ Descended َﻝَﺰَﻧ Stood up َﻡﺎَﻗ Went َﺐَﻫَﺫ (stayed) long َﻝﺎَﻃ From the forms and shapes of the verbs; it is clear that ﻡﺯﻼ�ﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ cuts across all categories of ﻞﻌﻓ i.e.
ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ ،ﻞﺘﻌﻤﻟﺍ ،ﺢﻴﺤﺼﻟﺍ ،ُﺩﱠﺮَﺠُﻤْﻟﺍ But whenever it may occur, its hallmark is the needlessness of ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻣ Self Assessment Exercise Which of the following verbs are ﻡﺯﻼﻟﺍ?

َﺢُﻠَﺻ - َﻞَﺧَﺩ - َﺝَﺮَﺧ - َﺺَﻗَﺭ - َﺐَﻀَﻏ 4.0 Conclusion You should note that ﻯﺪ�ﻌﺘﻤﻟﺍ ﻞ�ﻌﻔﻟﺍ can become ﻡﺯﻼ�ﻟﺍ through the aid of ﺓﺩﺎ�ﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ.
For example, َﺢَﺘَﻓ to open is ﻯﱢﺪَﻌَﺘُﻣ e.g َﺏﺎ �َﺒْﻟﺍ ِﻥﺎَﻤْﺣﱠﺮﻟﺍ ُﺪْﺒَﻋ َﺢَﺘَﻓ i.e Abdul-Rahman opened the door.
But with ﻒﻴﻌ�ﻀﺘﻟﺍ/ ﺓﺩﺎ�ﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ, َﺢَﺘ �َﻓ can become ُﺏﺎ �َﺒْﻟﺍ َﺢﱠﺘ �َﻔَﺗ i.e the door opened.
Furthermore, with the aid of ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ a noun i.e.
ٌﻢْﺳِﺇ like َﺮْﺼِﻣ Egypt can become verb e.g.
ِﺪْﻳَﺯ ﻮُﺑَﺃ َﺮَﺼْﻴَﻤَﺗ or ْﻦِﻔﻴِﺘ �َﺳ َﺮ �َﺠْﻴَﻨَﺗ i.e Abu Zayd became an Egyptian and Stephen became a Nigerian 5.0 Summary So far, you would have noticed that the skill of how to change transitive verb to intransitive and vice-verser is very advantages.
It can enhance for the learner acquisition of vocabulary.
Once you master how to use ﻒﻴﻌ�ﻀﺘﻟﺍ / ﺓﺩﺎ�ﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮ�ﺣ, you are on top of vocabulary acquisition.
6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment (TMA) What is the significance of the use of ﻒﻴﻌﻀﺗ /ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ in changing intransitive verbs to transitive?
Illustrate with four intransitive verbs in sentences.

She was brought up on Islamic ethics and traditions.
She always puts on dresses distinguished with courtesy.
When she got admission to the University, Fatima used to shuttle between lecture hall, Library and the hostel.
Actually, she spends most of her times in the library 45 ARA012: Arabic Morphology where she read essential books in Medicine that she studies.
No wonder why her father loves her so much.
On every annual vacation, her father takes her to Britain as a reward for her excellent conduct.
In Britain, nothing less than medical books, journals and other materials could cash Fatima’s fancy.
Certainly, Fatima is the apple of her father’s eyes.
Khalid, her brother, attempts to imitate Fatima in her good conduct.

46 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.2 ّﻖﺘﺸﻣ ﻭ ﺪﻣﺎﺟ ﻰﻟﺇ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ ﻢﻴﺴﻘﺗ Basically, ﻢﺳﻹﺍ can be ﺪﻣﺎﺟ or ﻖﺘﺸﻣ.
ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ means solid or hard noun in terms of its structure.
For example, ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ is so called because it is not derived from another source, and all its letters are basic and original.
The minimum original letters of ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ cannot be less than three e.g.
ٌﻢَﻠَﻗ ،ٌﺪَﻟَﻭ ،ٌﺪَﺳَﺃ ،ٌﺩْﺮِﻗ ،ٌﻞْﺟِﺭ ،ٌﻞَﺟَﺭ.
It can be of four letters, e.g.
ُﺮَﻔْﻌَﺟ.
ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ is also similar to what is known as ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ which means it is void of any additional letters.
On the other hand, ﱞﻖَﺘْﺸُﻤْﻟَﺍ is the (ﻢﺳﺇ) which is derived from a source e.g.
ٌﻢِﻟﺎَﻋ which is from ٌﻢْﻠِﻋ or ٌﺏﻮُﺘْﻜَﻣ which is derived from ُﺔَﺑﺎَﺘِﻛ/ٌﺐْﺘَﻛ.
To the extent that ﻖﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ is not independent of additional letter, it is qualified for ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ.
This is to say that while ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ is similar to ﺩﺮﺠﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ, there is such a similarity between ﻖﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ and ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻤﻟﺍ.

47 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.3 ِءﺎَﻤْﺳَﻷْﺍ ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ ﻑﺮﺻ impacts on ِﻢْﺳِﺇ in a variety of ways; these include classification of ﻢﺳﺇ into ﺩﺮﺠﻣ/ﺪﻣﺎﺟ and ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻣ/ﻖﺘﺸﻣ as illustrated above.
Secondly, ﻑﺮﺻ impacts on ﻢﺳﺇ through ﻒﻳﺮﺼﺘﻟﺍ.
This is by way of conjugating ﻢﺳﺇ from ُﺩَﺮْﻔُﻣ (singular) to ﻰﱠﻨَﺜُﻣ (dual) and ُﻊْﻤَﺟ (plural).
For example: Sulayman is an brilliant boy – ُﺪَﻟَﻭ ُﻥﺎَﻤْﻴَﻠُﺳ ٌﺐﻴِﺠَﻧ Two students from Abuja attended the party – ﺎَﺟﻮْﺑَﺃ ْﻦِﻣ ِﻥﺎَﺒِﻟﺎَﻃ َﺮَﻀَﺣ َﺔَﻠْﻔَﺤْﻟﺍ There is only one school in our village – ٌﺔَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻣ ﺎَﻨِﺘَﻳْﺮَﻗ ﻰَﻓ ٌﺓَﺪِﺣﺍَﻭ On the University campus, there are two schools – ﻰِﻌِﻣﺎَﺠْﻟﺍ ِﻡَﺮَﺤْﻟﺍ ﻰِﻓ ِﻥﺎَﺘَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻣ The Lagos schools are built on modern pattern – ِﺯﺍَﺮﱢﻄﻟﺍ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ٌﺔﱠﻴِﻨْﺒَﻣ ِﺱﻮُﻏَﻻ َﺱِﺭﺍَﺪَﻣ ﱠﻥِﺇ ِﺚﻳِﺪَﺤْﻟﺍ They have eyes with which they cannot see - َﻥﻭُﺮِﺼْﺒُﻳ َﻻ ٌﻦُﻴْﻋَﺃ ْﻢُﻬَﻟ ﺎَﻬِﺑ The secretaries are happy with their new position - ُﻢِﻬِﺒِﺼْﻨَﻤِﺑ َﻥﻮُﺒِﺗﺎَﻜْﻟﺍ َﺡِﺮَﻓ ِﺪﻳِﺪَﺠْﻟﺍ 48 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Analysis In the above sentences, you will see how it is easy to formulate ﻰﻨﺜﻣ from ﺩﺮﻔﻣ.
The mechanism is to add ﺍ + ﻥ to ﺩﺮﻔﻣ e.g.
: ٌﺪَﻟَﻭ with ﺍ + ﻥ = ﻥﺍَﺪَﻟَﻭ (2 boys).
The same mechanism is applicable to all single words that are known as ٌﺔَﻨﱢﻜَﻤَﺘُﻣ i.e.
the ones that can be conjugated from ﺩﺮﻔﻣ to ﻰﻨﺜﻣ to ﻊﻤﺟ.
e.g.
: ٌﺔـَﻗَﺭَﻭ + ﺍ + ﻥ = ِﻥﺎَﺘَﻗَﺭَﻭ ٌﺔَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻣ + ﺍ + ﻥ = ِﻥﺎَﺘَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻣ ٌﺪِﺠْﺴَﻣ + ﺍ + ﻥ = ِﻥﺍَﺪِﺠْﺴَﻣ ٌﻞُﺟَﺭ + ﺍ + ﻥ = ِﻥَﻼُﺟَﺭ ٌﺔَﺣﺎﱠﻔُﺗ + ﺍ + ﻥ = ِﻥﺎَﺘَﺣﺎﱠﻔُﺗ Regarding plural (ُﻊْﻤَﺟ), the situation changes i.e.
the mechanism differs slightly because there are different types of ُﻊْﻤَﺟ Jam‘.
These include: Sound masculine plural – ٌﻢِﻟﺎَﺳ ُﺮﱠﻛَﺬُﻣ ُﻊْﻤَﺟ Sound feminine plural – ٌﻢِﻟﺎَﺳ ُﺚﱠﻧَﺆُﻣ ُﻊْﻤَﺟ Broken plural – ِﺮﻴِﺴْﻜَﺗ ُﻊْﻤَﺟ The mechanism for the ﻢﻟﺎﺳ ﺮﻛﺬﻣ ﻊﻤﺟ is similar to that of ﻰﻨﺜﻣ which is by simply adding ﻭ + ﻥ to ﺩﺮﻔﻣ e.g.
: ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ + ﻭ + ﻥ = َﻥﻮُﺒِﺗﺎَﻛ ٌﺢِﺗﺎَﻓ + ﻭ + ﻥ = َﻥﻮُﺤِﺗﺎَﻓ ٌﻢِﻟﺎَﺳ + ﻭ + ﻥ = َﻥﻮُﻤِﻟﺎَﺳ ٌﻊِﻣﺎَﺟ + ﻭ + ﻥ = َﻥﻮُﻌِﻣﺎَﺟ ٌﺐِﻛﺍَﺭ + ﻭ + ﻥ = َﻥﻮُﺒِﻛﺍَﺭ ٌﻡِﺩﺎَﻗ + ﻭ + ﻥ = َﻥﻮُﻣِﺩﺎَﻗ Regarding the sound feminine plural, the formula is different.
The first step is to remove ﺔﻃﻮﺑﺮﻣ ءﺎﺗ at the end of the word in question e.g.
ٌ ﺔﺒِﻟﺎَﻃ.
Step two is to add ﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ + ﺕ to the ﺩﺮﻔﻣ i.e.
ٌﺐِﻟﺎَﻃ ﺍ + ﺕ = ﺕﺎَﺒِﻟﺎَﻃ ٌﺔـَﺒِﻛﺍَﺭ ﺍ + ﺕ = ٌﺕﺎَﺒِﻛﺍَﺭ ٌﺔَﻤِﻠْﺴُﻣ ﺍ + ﺕ = ٌﺕﺎَﻤَﻠْﺴُﻣ ٌﺓَﺪِﺟﺎَﺳ ﺍ + ﺕ = ٌﺕﺍَﺪِﺟﺎَﺳ ٌﺔَﻤِﺋﺎَﺻ ﺍ + ﺕ = ٌﺕﺎَﻤِﺋﺎَﺻ From the above, you can note that you have no difficulty in formulating ﺮﻛﺬﻣ ﻊﻤﺟ ﻰﻨﺜﻣ ﻢﻟﺎﺳ and ﻢﻟﺎﺳ ﺚﻧﺆﻣ ﻊﻤﺟ because in these three cases, the constituent letters are not disrupted.
Incidentally, the ِﺮﻴِﺴْﻜَﺗ ُﻊْﻤَﺟ (broken plural) poses a unique case.
There is no formula or mechanism to follow or a process to adopt.
Everything is based on oral tradition called ﻰِﻋﺎَﻤَﺳ.
In this case, the original constituent letters are disrupted and sometimes with additional letters interwoven with the original ones.

That is the surest way to get acquainted with broken plural given the fact that there is no clear formula to use in constructing it (broken plural).
5.0 Summary Two exercises have been carried out for you in this unit; namely classification of words into Jaamid/Mujarrad and Mushtaqq/Mazid feehi.

51 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Module 3: ﻢﺳﻻﺍ Unit 2: ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ (Derived Nouns) 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ءﺎﻤﺳﻷﺍ ﻦﻣ ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ 3.2 ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ continued 3.3 ﻼﻌﻓ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ ﺓﺭﻭﺮﻴﺻ 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 Introduction As already explained in unit one of Module 3 above, ﺕﺎﻘﺘﺸﻤﻟﺍ which means derivatives or the derived words play a crucial role in the enrichment of Arabic language.
This is an aspect of ﻑﺮﺻ which is activity packed.
It empowers the learner to source appropriate words to express his/her thoughts.
This is manifest in ﻢﻟﻵﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﺲﻨﺠﻟﺍ – ﺮﻴﻐﺼﺘﻟﺍ – ﻼﻌﻓ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ ﺐﻠﻗ – ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻥﺎﻣﺰﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ 2.0 Objectives.
At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • derive ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﻥﺎﻣﺰﻟﺍﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ • derive ﺔﻟﻵﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ – ﺐﺴﻨﻟﺍ – ﺮﻴﻐﺼﺘﻟﺍ • Make a verb out of ﻢﺳﺇ 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ﻩﺮﻴﻏﻭ ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ In English language, you will observe that a person who teaches is a teacher and a person who sweeps is a sweeper.
In Arabic, both the teacher and sweeper are called ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ i.e.
a derivative emanating from teaching and sweeping.
Further more, the object that is being taught or being swept is known in Arabic as ﻢﺳﺇ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ which is derived from the same root.
This could be seen as a plus for Arabic because while English has the word teacher for the person teaching which is ﻢﺳﺇ ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ there is no other derivative in English to be taken out of teaching that can be used for the recipient of teaching.
You will note that the word student or learner is the object of teaching.
For example ُﺱﱢﺭَﺪُﻤْﻟَﺃ the teacher and ُﺱﱠﺭَﺪُﻤْﻟَﺃ the learner are both derived from ُﺲْﻳِﺭْﺪَﺗ in the case of Arabic.
Let us consider the following table: ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ﺭﺪﺼﻤﻟﺍ / ٌﺏﻭُﺮْﺸَﻣ ٌﺏِﺮْﺸَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺏِﺭﺎَﺷ ٌﺏْﺮُﺷ 52 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ٌﺏَﺮْﺸَﺘْﺴُﻣ ٌﺐَﺘْﻜَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺏﻮُﺘْﻜَﻣ ٌﺐِﺘْﻜَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ ٌﺐْﺘَﻛ ٌﺲَﻨْﻜَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺱﻮُﻨْﻜَﻣ ٌﺲِﻨْﻜَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺲِﻧﺎَﻛ ٌﺲْﻨَﻛ ٌﺢَﺘْﻔَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺡﻮَﺘْﻔَﻣ ٌﺢِﺘْﻔَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﺢِﺗﺎَﻓ ٌﺢْﺘَﻓ / ٌﺏﻭُﺮْﻀَﻣ ٌﺏِﺮْﻀَﺘْﺴٌﻣ / ٌﺏِﺭﺎَﺿ ٌﺏْﺮَﺿ ٌﺏَﺮْﻀَﺘْﺴٌﻣ ٌﻕَﺯْﺮَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﻕﻭُﺯْﺮَﻣ ٌﻕِﺯْﺮَﺘْﺴُﻣ / ٌﻕِﺯﺍَﺭ ٌﻕْﺯِﺭ You note in the table that the person drinking is ٌﺏِﺭﺎَﺷ and the liquid being drunk is ٌﺏﻭُﺮْﺸَﻣ.
The person writing is ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ and what is being written is ٌﺏﻮُﺘْﻜَﻣ.
The person opening is ٌﺢِﺗﺎَﻓ and what is being opened is ٌﺡﻮَﺘْﻔَﻣ.
The person giving fortune is ٌﻕِﺯﺍَﺭ and the recipient is ٌﻕﻭُﺯْﺮَﻣ etc.
what makes the concept of derivation ُﻕﺎَﻘِﺘْﺷِﺇ interesting in Arabic is its elasticity that is, it is very broad and dynamic.
For example, from the same rout where you have derived ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ and ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ , you can also derive the place of action which is called ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ the time of action which is called ﻥﺎﻣﺰﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ the instrument of action which is called ﺔﻟﻵﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ.
If this is applied to ٌﺢْﺘَﻓ we shall have the following: ٌﺡﺎَﺘْﻔِﻣ ٌﺢَﺘْﻔَﻣ ٌﺡﻮُﺘْﻔَﻣ ٌﺢِﺗﺎَﻓ ٌﺢْﺘَﻓ Key the place the opened opener opening instrument where opening of opening takes place ٌﺔَﺒَﺘْﻜَﻣ ٌﺐَﺘْﻜَﻣ ٌﺏﻮُﺘْﻜَﻣ ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ ٌﺐْﺘَﻛ Library desk written document writer writing ٌﺔَﺒَﻌْﻠِﻣ ٌﺐَﻌْﻠَﻣ ٌﺏﻮُﻌْﻠَﻣ ٌﺐِﻋَﻻ ٌﺐْﻌَﻟ play thing field/ driveller player play playground 53 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ٌﺔَﻘَﻌْﻠِﻣ ٌﻖَﻌْﻠَﻣ ٌﻕﻮُﻌْﻠَﻣ ٌﻖِﻋَﻻ َﻖِﻌَﻟ spoon something to someone lick e.g.
ice licking lick cream The interesting aspect of this derivation exercise is when you derive words such as key, library, playground and desk from the rout called ﺭﺪﺼﻣ in Arabic e.g.
: ٌﺡﺎَﺘْﻔِﻣ ٌﺢْﺘَﻓ ٌﺐَﻌْﻠَﻣ ٌﺐْﻌَﻟ ٌﺔَﺒَﺘْﻜَﻣ ،ٌﺐَﺘْﻜَﻣ ٌﺐْﺘَﻛ Examples: .ﻡﺪﻘﻟﺍ ﺓﺮﻛ ﻰﻓ ﺓﺍﺭﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﺓﺪﻫﺎﺸَﻤِﻟ ِﺐَﻌْﻠَﻤْﻟﺍ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ُﺐَﻫْﺫَﺃ ﺎَﻧَﺃ I am going to the playing ground to watch football match.

ُﺔَﻫْﺰﱡﻨﻠِﻟ ِﺩِﺭْﻮَﻤْﻟﺍ ﻰَﻟِﺇ ُﺪﻴِﻤَﻌْﻟﺍ َﺐَﻫَﺫ The Dean went to the resort for relaxation.
Take note of words such as ُﺐَﻌْﻠَﻤْﻟَﺍ (playing ground), ُﺔَﻘَﻌْﻠِﻤْﻟَﺍ (spoon), ُﺔَﺒَﺘْﻜَﻤْﻟَﺍ (library), ُﺓﺎَﺘْﺸَﻤْﻟَﺍ (winter resort) and ُﺩِﺭْﻮَﻤْﻟَﺍ (a resort) in the sentences above.
They are derived from ٌﺐْﻌَﻟ, ٌﻖْﻌَﻟ, ٌءﺎَﺘِﺷ, ُﺩْﺭَﻭ.
Self Assessment Exercise Derive from the following routs ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ, ﻪﺑ ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ, ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ and ﺔﻟﻵﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ and use them in sentences: ٌﺮْﻄَﺳ ،ٌﺲْﻨَﻛ ،ٌﺐْﻫَﺫ ،ٌﻊْﺒَﻃ 3.2 ﺔﺒﺴﻨﻟﺍﻭ ﺮﻴﻐﺼﺘﻟﺍ With ﺔﺒﺴﻨﻟﺍ and ﺮﻴﻐﺼﺘﻟﺍ, you are given an opportunity to manipulate words to express smallness and attribute/ascribe a word to something.
In other words, ﺮﻴﻐﺼﺘﻟﺍ is used when you want to show how small a thing or person is in the host of his or its pairs.
Similarly, you use ﺔﺒﺴﻨﻟﺍ when you want to attribute something or a person to something else.
There is a pattern i.e.
a type of ﻥﺯﻭ you use in both cases.
In a three lettered word like ٌﺪَﻟَﻭ, the appropriate ﻥﺯﻭ is ٌﻞْﻴَﻌُﻓ which gives you ٌﺪْﻴَﻟُﻭ and in the case of a four lettered word, the pattern i.e.
ٌﻥْﺯَﻭ is ٌﻞَﻌْﻴَﻌُﻓ in which ٌﺮَﻔْﻌَﺟ becomes ٌﺮَﻔْﻴَﻌُﺟ.
In case of ﺔﺒﺴﻨﻟﺍ, you simply add a duplicated ya‘ at the end of the word which you want to attribute.
For example, if you intend attributing a person 54 ARA012: Arabic Morphology to a town like َﺮْﺼِﻣ (Egypt), you simply add a duplicated ya‘ and the word becomes ﱞﻯِﺮْﺼِﻣ i.e.
an Egyptian.
Or you intend attributing an action or a dress to a ٌﺪَﻟَﻭ, you add duplicated ya‘ and it becomes ﱞﻯِﺪَﻟَﻭ i.e.
the action or dress which is that of a boy (ﺪﻟﻭ).
Let us consider the following sentences: Khalid is an Egyptian student – ٌﺐِﻟﺎَﻃ ُﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ ﱞﻱِﺮْﺼِﻣ Fawzi reads the Qur’an in an Egyptian voice – ٍﺕْﻮَﺼِﺑ ﻯِﺯْﻮَﻓ ُﺅَﺮْﻘَﻳ ﱞﻯِﺮْﺼِﻣ Yusuf has Nigerian behaviour – ٌﺕﺎَﻓﱡﺮَﺼَﺗ ُﻪَﻟ ُﻒُﺳﻮُﻳ ٌﺔﱠﻳِﺮﻴِﺠْﻴَﻧ Balqis wears a male dress – ﺎًﺴَﺒْﻠَﻣ ﻯِﺪَﺗْﺮَﺗ ُﺲﻴِﻘْﻠِﺑ ﺎﻳِﺪَﻟَﻭ ٍﺔﱠﻴِﻣَﻼْﺳِﺇ ِﺪﻴِﻟﺎَﻘَﺗَﻭ ِﺕﺍَﺩﺎَﻌِﺑ ﺔﱠﻳِﺩﻮُﻌﱠﺴﻟﺍ ﻰِﻓ ُﺮُﻌْﺸَﺘَﺳ َﻚﱠﻧِﺇ You will feel in Saudi Arabia Islamic ethics and traditions.

Q 41:44 3.2.1 Analysis In the sentences above, you will note in the first sentence Khalid being attributed to Egypt, Fawzi’s voice in the second sentence being attributed to Egypt again, Yusuf’s behaviour in the third sentence being attributed to Nigeria, Balqis’ dress in four being attributed to a boy’s, Saudi’s ethics and traditions in five being attributed to Islam, entry to the country without a visa in six being attributed to illegality, Sibaway in seven being attributed to Grammar.
In sentence eight, a smallish loaf of bread is preferred.
Ismail in sentence nine bought a smallish ﻑﺮﺻ book.
in sentence ten, the Qur’ān is attributed to Arab.
In the final sentence, the Qur’ān is attributed to non-Arabibc language.
Self Assessment Exercise Make ُﺮﻴِﻐْﺼَﺗ and َﺔَﺒْﺴِﻧ of the following words and use them in sentence: ٌﺔَﺳَﺭْﺪَﻣ - ٌﺏﺎَﺘِﻛ - ٌﺏﺎَﺑ - ٌﻦَﻃَﻭ - ٌﺪَﻠَﺑ 55 ARA012: Arabic Morphology 3.3 ﻼﻌﻓ ﻢﺳﻹﺍ ﺭﻭﺮﻴﺻ In Arabic, ﻑﺮﺻ can assist you to construct verbs out of noun.
This is common especially with names of cities or countries such as َﺮْﺼِﻣ (Egypt), America and Nigeria.
For example, if you intend saying that someone has become an Egyptian or a Nigerian or any town or country for that matter, you can coin a verb out of the intended town or country.
In the case of ﺮْﺼِﻣ for example, you could say: Abdul Wakil became an Egyptian – ِﺪْﺒَﻋ َﺮَﺼْﻴَﻤَﺗ ِﻞﻴِﻛَﻮْﻟﺍ Incase of USA, you first of all transliterate USA thus ﺎﻜﻳﺮﻣﺃ.
Then you can say َﻙَﺮْﻣَﺄَﺗ.
Nigeria can be transliterated thus ﺎﻳﺮﻴﺠﻴﻧ and you have َﺮَﺠْﻴَﻨَﺗ.
Khalid became an Egyptian – ْﻭَﺃ ٌﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ َﺮَﺼْﻴَﻤَﺗ َﺮﱠﺼَﻤَﺗ Sharif became an American – َﻙَﺮْﻣَﺄَﺗ ُﻒﻳِﺮَﺷ Muslim became a Nigerian – ُﻢِﻠْﺴُﻣ َﺮَﺠْﻴَﻨَﺗ You should note that the ability to coin verbs out of names of towns, cities or countries depends largely on a very wide reading since the mechanism of the exercise is purely oral tradition known as ّﻰِﻋﺎَﻤَﺳ.
Self Assessment Exercise Attempt making verb our of the following names of towns and places and use them in sentences: ِﺱﻮُﻏَﻻ – ﺍَﺪَﻨَﻛ – ْﻦِﻄْﻨِﺷﺍَﻭ – ْﻥَﺪْﻨَﻟ 4.0 Conclusion Forming verbs out of towns and places should not give you sleepless nights since you do not have a definite formula to work with.
This aspect of ﻑﺮﺻ is to show how flexible Arabic language is and indeed how dynamic and interesting ﻑﺮﺻ is.
5.0 Summary If you take a critical look at َﺔَﺒْﺴﱢﻨﻟﺍ, it becomes clear to you that ﻑﺮﺻ is not presenting a unique formula because in English, there is the same formula as you can see in adding n to Nigeria to become Nigerian (e.g.
the Nigerian character)or to America to become American (e.g.
the American embassy).
So, duplicated ya‘ is doing in Arabic what n or ish does in English.
However, there are cases when n cannot apply e.g.
Britain or England, it is ish that is added while the last three letters are removed i.e.
and in England and you have English and ain in Britain and you have British.
You will have similar cases in Arabic where you will need more than duplicated ya‘.

These are verbs that can transform i.e.
change from one form or shape to another with a view to creating fresh meanings, ideas or impressions.
This transformation is known as conjugation ﻒﻳﺮﺼﺗ as you have seen so far.
In contrast, however, there are other verbs that constitute the subject of this unit.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should able to: • define ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ • State ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻉﺍﻮﻧﺃ • Give illustrations 3.0 Main Content 3.1 By definition, ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ means verbs that are not amenable to conjugation.
They are not inclined to ﻒﻳﺮﺼﺗ.
ﺪﻣﺎﺟ literally means solid or impenetrable.
These are the verbs that you cannot change from ﺽﺎﻣ to ﻉﺭﺎﺼﻣ and ﺮﻣﺃ.
You cannot derive out of them ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ،ﻝﻮﻌﻔﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ،ﻥﺎﻜﻤﻟﺎﻤﺳﺇ ،ﻥﺎﻣﺮﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ،ﻪﻟﻻﺍ ﻢﺳﺍ.
Though, it is a verb, it remains in one form.
But then, it should be observed quickly the sign of it’s being a verb is the acceptance of ﺚﻴﻧﺄﺘﻟﺍ ءﺎﺗ such as ْﺕ in ْﺖَﺴْﻴَﻟ or ﻢﻠﻜﺘﻤﻟﺍ ءﺎﺗ such as ُﺕ in ُﺖْﺴَﻟ.
ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ is of two types.
The first group is permanently structured on past tense (ﻰﺿﺎﻣ) while the second group is permanently structured on command (ﺮﻣﺃ).
Members of the first group include: ،ﻰَﺴَﻋ ،ﺄَﺸْﻧَﺃ ،َﻖِﻔَﻃ ،َﻢْﻌِﻧ ،َﺲْﺌِﺑ ،ﺍﺬﱠﺒَﺣ ،َﺬﱠﺒَﺣَﻻ َﺲْﻴَﻟ.
58 ARA012: Arabic Morphology It should be stated that these verbs (ﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ) are meant for creating special impressions.
They are like what we can call occasional verbs.
Each of them has a special meaning to render.
ﺲﻴﻟ for example is one of ﻥﺎﻛ ﺕﺍﻮﺧﺃ.
It is permanently structured on ﻰﺿﺎﻣ and cannot be conjugated as already explained in the general introduction above.
Interestingly though, its sisters like ﻥﺎﻛ can be conjugated.
ﺲﻴﻟ is to negate occurrence of an action, e.g.
: I have no fruits to break fast with – ﺎَﻬِﺑ ُﺮِﻄْﻓَﺃ ٌﺕﺍَﺮَﻤَﺛ ﻰِﻟ َﺲْﻴَﻟ The male is not like the female (Q 3:36) – ﻰَﺜْﻧُﻷْﺎَﻛ ُﺮَﻛﱠﺬﻟﺍ َﺲْﻴَﻟ Layla is not in hijab – ﺔﺒﺠﺣ ﻰﻠﻴﻟ ﺖَﺴْﻴَﻟ I don’t know either rich or poor he is – َﻮُﻫ ٌﺮﻴِﻘَﻓ ْﻡَﺃ ﱞﻲِﻨْﻏَﺃ ﻯِﺭْﺩَﺃ ُﺖْﺴَﻟ The Christians have naught to stand upon (Q 2:113) – ٍءْﻲَﺷ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ُﺩﻮُﻬَﻴْﻟﺍ ِﺖَﺴْﻴَﻟ The Jews have naught to stand upon (Q 2:117) – ٍءْﻲَﺷ ﻰَﻠَﻋ ﻯَﺭﺎَﺼﱠﻨﻟﺍ ِﺖَﺴْﻴَﻟَﻭ Not all of them are alike (Q 3:113) – ًﺩﺍَﻮَﺳ ﺍﻮُﺴْﻴَﻟ In the above sentences, you will note that َﺲْﻴَﻟ take a characteristic of a normal verb with ﺚﻴﻧﺄﺘﻟﺍ ءﺎﺗ in the 3rd, 5th and 6th sentences, ﻢﻠﻜﺘﻤﻟﺍ ءﺎﺗ in the 4th sentence and ﺔﻋﺎﻤﺠﻟﺍ ﻭﺍﻭ in the 7th sentence.
You may recall that َﺲْﻴَﻟ cannot be conjugated (ُﻒﻳِﺮْﺼَﺗ) from ﻰِﺿﺎَﻣ, ٌﻉِﺭﺎَﻀُﻣ and ٌﺮْﻣَﺃ being ُﺪِﻣﺎَﺟ ُﻞْﻌِﻓ.
3.1.1 • ﻰَﺴَﻋ connotes hope/expectation of occurrence of an action or an event.
Examples: It may be that Allah will bring a solution – ﷲﺍ ﻰﺗﺄﻳ ﻥﺃ ﻰﺴﻋ ﺝﺮﻔﺑ ﺍﺩﻮﻤﺤﻣ ﺎﻣﺎﻘﻣ ﻚﺑﺭ ﻚﺜﻌﺒﻳ ﻥﺃ ﻰﺴﻋ It may be that your Lord will raise you to a station of glory You may dislike a thing which is good for you – ﻢﻜﻟ ﺮﻴﺧ ﻮﻫﻭ ﺎﺌﻴﺷ ﺍﻮﻫﺮﻜﺗ ﻥﺃ ﻰﺴﻋ You may like a thing which is an evil for you – ﻢﻜﻟ ﺮﺷ ﻮﻫﻭ ﺎﺌﻴﺷ ﺍﻮﺒﺤﺗ ﻥﺃ ﻰﺴﻋﻭ If you were to be placed in a position of authority – ﻢﺘﻴﻟﻮﺗ ﻥﺇ ﻢﺘﻴﺴﻋ ﻞﻬﻓ • Just like in ﺲﻴﻟ, you will observe that ﻰﺴﻋ also takes one of the characteristics of a normal verb for taking ﻊﻤﺠﻟﺍ ﻢﻴﻣ ﻊﻣ ﻢﻠﻜﺘﻤﻟﺍ ﺉﺎﺗ.
Again, you cannot conjugate ﻰﺴﻋ into ﻰﺿﺎﻣ, ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻣ and ﺮﻣﺃ being ﺪﻣﺎﺟ ﻞﻌﻓ.
• ﻢﻌﻧ connotes appreciation and praise when someone or something has performed wonderfully well.
Examples: The best to protect, the best to help (Allah) (Q 22:78) – َﻢْﻌِﻧَﻭ ﻰَﻟْﻮَﻤْﻟﺍ َﻢْﻌِﻧ ُﺮﻴِﺼﱠﻨﻟﺍ How excellent is the servant ever turning to (Allah) (Q 38:44) - ٌﺏﺍﱠﻭَﺃ ُﻪﱠﻧِﺇ ُﺪْﺒَﻌْﻟﺍ َﻢْﻌِﻧ 59 ARA012: Arabic Morphology How excellent is the hero Khalid b. Walid – ِﻦُﺑ ُﻝِﺩﺎَﺧ ُﻞَﻄَﺒْﻟﺍ َﻢْﻌِﻧ ِﺪﻴِﻟَﻮْﻟﺍ How excellent is the philanthropist Uthman b. Affan – ْﻦُﺑ ُﻥﺎَﻤْﺜُﻋ ُﻦِﺴْﺤُﻤْﻟﺍ َﻢْﻌِﻧ ِﻥﺎﱠﻔَﻋ How excellent is the hardworking student Abdul Karim – ُﺪْﺒَﻋ ُﺪِﻬَﺘْﺠُﻤْﻟﺍ ُﺐِﻟﺎََﻄْﻟﺍ َﻢْﻌِﻧ ِﻢﻳِﺮَﻜْﻟﺍ ﺔﻌﺑﺍﺮﻟﺍ ﺔﻨﻳﺪَﺘُﻤْﻟﺍ ِﺖَﻤْﻌِﻧ ﺔﻳﻭﺪﻌﻟﺍ How excellent is the (female) devotee Rabi‘ah al-Adawiyyah َﺲْﺌِﺑ is the direct opposite of ﻢﻌﻧ.
It is to express disgust and blame.
When something or an action is distasteful and disgusting or a person does something blameworthy we use َﺲْﺌِﺑ.
For example, you can say: How disgusting what invited inviting me to – ِﻪْﻴَﻟِﺇ ﻰِﻧَﻮُﻤُﺗْﻮَﻋَﺩ ﺎَﻤَﺴْﺌِﺑ What a bad/evil behaviour telling lies – ﺏْﺬَﻜْﻟﺍ ُﺊﱢﻴﱠﺴﻟﺍ ُﻖﻠُﺨْﻟﺍ َﺲْﺌِﺑ What a morally bankrupt person a slanderer – ُﻡﺎﱠﻤﱠﻨﻟﺍ ِﻖُﻠُﺨْﻟﺍ ُﺊﱢﻴﱠﺴﻟﺍ َﺲْﺌِﺑ What a bad evil name after faith – ِﻥﺎَﻤﻳِﻹْﺍ َﺪْﻌَﺑ ُﻡﻮُﺴُﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻢْﺳِﻹْﺍ َﺲْﺌِﺑ Terrible is the drink and an evil dwelling place – ﺎَﻘَﻔَﺗْﺮُﻣ ْﺕءﺎَﺳَﻭ ُﺏﺍَﺮﱠﺸﻟﺍ َﺲْﺌِﺑ In the Qur’an we have the following examples: َﺲْﺌِﺑَﻭ ﺎَﻬَﻧْﻮَﻠْﺼَﻳ َﻢﱠﻨْﻬَﺟ ُﺭﺍَﺮَﻘْﻟﺍ Hell, in which they will burn, and what an evil place to settle in (Q 14:29) َﺲْﺌِﺑَﻭ ِﻦْﻴَﻗِﺮْﺸَﻤْﻟﺍ َﺪﱠﻌُﺑ َﻚَﻨْﻴَﺑَﻭ ﻰِﻨْﻴَﺑ َﺖْﻴَﻟﺎَﻳ ُﻦﻳِﺮَﻘْﻟﺍ Would that between me and you were the distance of the two eats – what a worst companion (Q 43:28) Self Assessment Exercise Use the following ﺓﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ each in 2 sentences: ﻢﻌﻧ ،ﻰﺴﻋ ،ﺲﺌﺑ ،ﺲﻴﻟ 3.2 ﺓﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ continued 3.2.1 ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣَﻻ ،ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ ،َﺵﺎَﺣ The three ﺓﺪﻣﺎﺟ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﺃ listed above are distinct from those that are treated in 3.1.
The distinction is in timing.
While the ones treated in 3.1 are exclusively for the past tense, the latter ones are of ﺮﻣﺃ type i.e.
futuristic.
ﺵﺎﺣ for example means except but as ﺮﻣﺃ ﺪﻣﺎﺟ ﻞﻌﻓ it connotes forbid.
The impression being created with ﺵﺎﺣ is no!
It cannot happen!
Or prevent it from happening!
ﺵﺎﺣ came up twice in Surat Yusuf: ٌﻢﻳِﺮَﻛ ٌﻚَﻠَﻣ ﱠﻻِﺇ ﺍَﺬَﻫ ﱠﻥِﺇ ﺍًﺮَﺸَﺑ ﺍَﺬَﻫ ﺎَﻣ ِﷲ َﺵﺎَﺣ 60 ARA012: Arabic Morphology How perfect is Allah (or Allah forbid)!
No man is this!
This is none other than a noble angel!
(Q 12:31).
Allah forbids!
No evil know we against him!
(Q 12:51) - ْﻦِﻣ ِﻪْﻴَﻠَﻋ ﺎَﻨْﻤِﻠَﻋ ﺎَﻣ ِﷲ َﺵﺎَﺣ ٍءﻮُﺳ In an ordinary context: A scholar cannot be in want – َﺮِﻘَﺘْﻔَﻳ ْﻥَﺃ ِﻢِﻟﺎَﻌْﻠِﻟ َﺵﺎَﺣ An Imam cannot commit evil as must not commit evil – َﻖُﺴْﻔَﻳ ْﻭَﺃ َﺮُﺠْﻔَﻳ ْﻥَﺃ ِﻡﺎَﻣِﻺِﻟ َﺵﺎَﺣ The sky cannot drop gold – ﺎًﺒَﻫَﺫ َﺮِﻄْﻤُﺗ ْﻥَﺃ ُءﺎَﻤﱠﺴﻟﺍ َﺵﺎَﺣ A camel cannot enter the eye of the needle (Q 7:40) – ِﻁﺎَﻴِﺨْﻟﺍ ﱢﻢَﺳ ﻰِﻓ َﺞِﻠَﻳ ْﻥَﺃ ُﻞَﻤَﺠْﻟﺍ َﺵﺎَﺣ In the case of ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ or ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ َﻻ, we also have a ﺪﻣﺎﺟ which connotes a future event that is of utmost demand.
In other words, something fondly desirable.
This is to express expectation of occurrence of something very pleasant like yearning for a cool weather in summer.
Examples: What a brilliant boy (love him) – ُﺐﻴِﺠﱠﻨﻟﺍ ُﺪَﻟَﻮْﻟﺍ ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ ﺎَﻳ What a beautiful autumn weather (you love it) – ُﻞﻴِﻤَﺠْﻟﺍ ِﻒﻳِﺮَﺨْﻟﺍ ﱡﻮَﺟ ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ ﺎَﻳ What a terrible heat (hate summer weather) – ِﻒْﻴﱠﺼﻟﺍ ﱡﻮَﺟ ُﺔَﺤْﻴَﻔْﻟﺍ ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ َﻻ Corruption!
What a dirty social system – ُﻞﻳِﺫﱠﺮﻟﺍ ﱡﻰِﻋﺎَﻤِﺘْﺟِﻹْﺍ ُﻡﺎَﻈﱢﻨﻟﺍ ُﺩﺎَﺴَﻔْﻟﺍ ﺍَﺬﱠﺒَﺣ َﻻ Self Assessment Exercise Identify from the Qur’an or Arabic poems the usage of and use them in your own sentences.
4.0 Conclusion You should note that what ﺵﺎﺣ and ﺍﺬﺒﺣ have in common is the issue of timing; both of them connote a feature occurrence of an event.
However, their difference is in negative and positive meanings; while ﺵﺎﺣ connotes never to happen ﺍﺬﺒﺣ connotes excitement and love for the event or thing to happen.
5.0 Summary ﻑﺮﺻ presents to us in ﺓﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ an interesting case.
What makes them ﺓﺪﻣﺎﺟ is the fact that they cannot: (a) be conjugated: (b) attract ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ i.e.
they cannot become ﻪﻴﻓ ﺪﻳﺰﻣ.
(c) Reflect ُﺩَﺮْﻔُﻣ – ﻰﱠﻨَﺜُﻣ – ُﻊْﻤَﺟ like َﻥﻮُﺒَﻫْﺬَﻳ ِﻥﺎَﺒَﻫْﺬَﻳ ُﺐَﻫْﺬَﻳ 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment (TMA) State definition of ﺓﺪﻣﺎﺠﻟﺍ ﻝﺎﻌﻓﻷﺍ and their characteristics.

Introduction ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ is a cluster of letters commonly referred to as in a statement which reads thus: ﺎَﻬْﻴَﻧﻮُﻤُﺘْﻟَﺄَﺳ i.e.
you asked me of them.
They are treated in this unit for further classification.
2.
Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • list ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ; • Identify ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ in verb and nouns.
• Illustrate with ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ in verbs and nouns.
3.0 Main Content 3.1 Huruufuz-ziyaadah are so called because of the role they play in verbs and nouns.
They provide additional letters to what is known in a verb or noun as foundation letters or constituent letters/radicals.
For example, َﺲَﻠَﺟ is known as ﻞﻌﻓ ﺩﺮﺠﻣ as already explained to you in the previous modules.
If you add ﺓﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ to ﺲﻠﺟ, you have َﺲَﻟﺎَﺟ while ﺲﻠﺟ means (he) sat e.g.
ٌﻦِﻣْﺆُﻣ َﺲَﻠَﺟ (Mu’min sat), َﺲَﻟﺎَﺟ means (he) sat with e.g.
ﺍًﺪِﻟﺎَﺧ ٌﻦِﻣْﺆُﻣ َﺲَﻟﺎَﺟ (Mu’min sat with Khalid) in the same token, ٌﻢَﻠَﻗ (a pen) is a ﺩﺮﺠﻣ ﻢﺳﺇ because all the letters therein are foundation radicals.
But in ُﻡَﻼْﻗَﺃ we have ﺓﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ which is an additional letter.
It should be noted that ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ are not used for mere aesthetics.
They are employed to create fresh meanings and effects.
As you can see in ٌﻢَﻠَﻗ above, with ﺓﺪﻣ ﻒﻟﺃ added, ٌﻢَﻠَﻗ changed to ٌﻡَﻼْﻗَﺃ i.e.
from ﺩﺮﻔﻣ to ﻊﻤﺟ.
In the case of َﺲَﻠَﺟ and َﺲَﻟﺎَﺟ, you will note that the effect of sitting alone changed to sitting with someone else.
With the use of ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ therefore, ﻑﺮﺻ provides a mechanic for creating numerous verbs and nouns in response to fresh meanings and effects.
The letters are ten.
Take note of the following illustration.

Take a close look at every word you will see in it one or two ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﺮﺣ.
The sentences are either taken from the verses of the Qur’an or from common daily usages.
The variety is to make its learning easy for you.

These are known as ﻑﻭﺮﺣ ﺔﻋﺭﺎﻀﻤﻟﺍ i.e.
the letters of the present tense.
You will take note that these four letters called ُﺖْﻴَﻧَﺃ are already listed among ﺎَﻬﻴِﻧﻮُﻤُﺘْﻟَﺄَﺳ.
But, for emphasis and clarification, they are repeated.
This is to remove doubt for should you come across them in another text book or reference material.

4.0 Conclusion You should take note of the fact that the ﺖﻴﻧﺃ letters are basically part and parcel of ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ known as ﺎﻬﻴﻧﻮﻤﺘﻟﺄﺳ.
Their designation as ُﺖْﻴَﻧَﺃ letters is for their specific usage as ﻉﺭﺎﻀﻤﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ.
5.0 Summary It is necessary to note shaddah when ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﻭﺮﺣ are discussed.
Shaddah means a duplicated letter.
For example, َﻦﻴِﻤَﻟﺎَﻌْﻟﺍ ﱢﺏَﺭ ِﷲ ُﺪْﻤَﺤْﻟَﺍ.
The shaddah sign on baa mean that letter baa is doubled or duplicated.
In that case, it serves as ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺰﻟﺍ ﻑﺮﺣ.
If, for example, َﺱَﺭَﺩ to study become َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ to teach, letter raa’ is duplicated and the additional raa assumes the position of ﺓﺩﺎﻳﺯ ﻑﺮﺣ.
So, any other letter can play that role whenever it is duplicated.
6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment What is the difference between ﺎﻬﻴﻧﻮﻤﺘﻟﺄﺳ set and ﺖﻴﻧﺃ set?
Illustrate with six sentences.

68 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Module 4: ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ Unit 2: ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ 3.2 ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ 3.3 Illustrations 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 5.0 Introduction ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ In this unit, my intention is to do what I call a mob up presentation.
This is to recap some of the topics we have treated to give it a fresh treatment.
It is for emphasis and reinforcement.
I am particularly inclined to treating ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ as two terms that occupy a special position in ﻑﺮﺻ generally.
The two terms actually deserve this special mention.
Also to be treated specially is ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • correctly use the terms ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ.
• state the differences between ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ and ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ; and • give illustration.
3.0 ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ 3.1 ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻤﻟﺍﻭ ﻥﺯﻮﻟﺍ is the hup of ﻑﺮﺻ.
It cuts across all aspects of Ṣarf.
Every word (ﺔﻤﻠﻛ) has a Wazn and every Wazn has mawzuun.
It is important that you know how to use the two terms appropriately.
The Wazn means the scale i.e.
the measure used in determining the status of every ﺔﻤﻠﻛ.
For example, ٌﻞْﻌَﻓ is a wazn and the mawzuun is ٌﺪْﻋَﻭ.
You can therefore, ask a question: what is the wazn of ٌﺪْﻋَﻭ?
Your answer is: ٌﻞْﻌَﻓ is the wazn of ٌﺪْﻋَﻭ.
Furthermore, you can as well ask: what is the mawzuun of ٌﻞْﻌَﻓ?
Its mawzuun is ٌﺪْﻋَﻭ.
The method of determining wazn of a kalmah or mawzuun of a wazn is very simple.
The smallest size of a word in Arabic is the three lettered.
This is called thulaathi.
In other words, no Arabic word is less than three letters.
In case you see a word of two letters or one such as ْﻞُﻗ (say) or ِﻕ (save), certainly, such a word must have 69 ARA012: Arabic Morphology been subjected to some structural adjournment exercise by means of elimination of one or two letters for morphological reasons which are explainable.
3.1.1 The starting point of mastering of the technique is through labeling the constituent letters.
You will recall what we term the foundation radicals.
One must reiterate, foundation radicals or constituent letters are the original letters in a verb or noun each of which cannot be removed or else, the word is rendered meaningless.
If, for example you remove a letter from ُﺐْﻠَﻛ, say ﻙ, the remaining ﺐﻟ will be meaningless.
Or you remove a letter from َﻊِﻤَﺳ, say ﻡ, the remaining َﻊِﻣ will be meaningless.
So, labelling is the game.
The wazn َﻞَﻌَﻓ or ُﻞْﻌَﻓ is labelled as follows: َﻞــــَﻌـــَﻓ.
ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻡَﻻ ﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻦْﻴَﻋ ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُءﺎَﻓ ِ That of ٌﻞْﻌَﻓ follows the same pattern i.e.
ُﻞـــْﻌـــَﻓ ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻡَﻻ ُﻦْﻴَﻋﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُءﺎَﻓ ِ When the same pattern is applied to mawzuun, we have the following: َﺲـــَﻠـــَﺟ ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻡَﻻ ﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُﻦْﻴَﻋ ِﻞْﻌِﻔْﻟﺍ ُءﺎَﻓ ِ By now, you must have been able to distinguish wazn from mawzuun.
3.1.2 It should be recalled that we have wazn thulaathi and wazn rubaa‘i.
Wazn thulaathi is of six types while wazn rubaa‘i is only one.
But both of them are of mujarrad structure.
These are: ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞُﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞِﻌَﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞِﻌَﻓ ُﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ُﻞِﻌْﻔَﻳ َﻞَﻌَﻓ ُﻞَﻌْﻔﻳَ َﻞَﻌَﻓ Regarding Rubaa‘I al-mujarrad, its wazn is َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻓ i.e.
ُﻞِﻠْﻌَﻔُﻳ َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻓ.
But wazn rubaa‘i will also be given the same labelling as that of thulaathi.
It reads thus: َﻞـــَﻠـــْﻌـــَﻓ 70 ARA012: Arabic Morphology ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻﻧﺎﺜﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻷﺍ ﻞ ﻭ ﻝ To apply this to mawzuun, we have the following: َﻉ ﺰــــُﻋ َﺯ َﺢـــَﺘـــَﻓ َﺪـــَﻌـــَﻗ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻﻧﺎﺜﻟﺍ ﻵﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻡﻻ ﻦﻴﻋ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ءﺎﻓ ﺩ ﻝ As you move from thulaathi mujarrad and rubaa‘i mujarrad to thulaathi mazeed and rubaa‘i mazeed feehi, you follow the same pattern.
Whatever increment that may occur in mawzuun, its equivalent in wazn will be created.
In the same vein, if there is any reduction in mawzuun, the wazn is taken through the same reduction.
For example: َﺱﱠﺭَﺩ - َﺱَﺭﺍَﺪَﺗ - َﺢَﺘْﻔَﺘْﺳِﺇ - َﻉَﺰْﻋَﺰَﺗ - َﻢَﺠْﻧَﺮْﺣِﺇ َﻞﱠﻌَﻓ - َﻞَﻋﺎَﻔَﺗ - َﻞَﻌْﻔَﺘْﺳِﺇ - َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻔَﺗ - َﻞَﻠْﻨَﻌْﻓِﺇ You should be ready to approach it either way.
In other words, you be given wazn e.g.
َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻓ and be asked to supply the appropriate ٌﻥﻭُﺯْﻮَﻣ which in this instance will be َﻒَﺴْﻠَﻓ.
Suppose, you are given the ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻣ e.g.
َﻒَﺴْﻠَﻔَﺗ and be asked to supply the appropriate ﻥﺯﻭ.
In this instance, the appropriate wazn is َﻞَﻠْﻌَﻔَﺗ.
In case of reduction in the mawzuun e.g.
ْﻞُﻗ – ُﻝﻮُﻘَﻳ – َﻝﺎَﻗ the wazn is ْﻞُﻓ – ْﻞُﻌْﻔَﻳ – َﻞَﻌَﻓ since ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ has been eliminated in the mawzuun, so also in the wazn, ﻞﻌﻔﻟﺍ ﻦﻴﻋ will disappear and that’s why we have ْﻞُﻓ as wazn to correspond with ﻞﻗ in mawzuun.
Self Assessment Exercise What is the relationship between wazn and mawzuun?
Given illustration in four wazn and four mawzuun.
3.2 ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ This is another language structure designed to create an effect; a special effect.
Literally, ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ means exaggeration.
Technically though, ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ is a special structure meant for creating a special meaning.
In this case, ﻢﺳﺇ is attributed to it as we say ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ which means a noun structured to connote a higher degree of ﻢﺳﺇ ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ i.e.
the doer e.g.
ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ or ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ.
While ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ means a writer, ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ means a worker 71 ARA012: Arabic Morphology or a doer.
But when a particular writer (ٌﺐِﺗﺎَﻛ) writes at a rate faster, better more intense than an ordinary writer or when a worker (ٌﻞِﻋﺎَﻓ) works more devotedly, more diligently with an exceeding commitment, the ﻑﺮﺻ comes up with a structure to express that higher level of handling the craft.
Then, you have ٌﻝﺎﱠﻌَﻓ or ٌﺏﺎﱠﺘَﻛ.
So ٌﻝﺎﱠﻌَﻓ or ٌﺏﺎﱠﺘَﻛ is called ِﺔَﻐَﻟﺎَﺒُﻤْﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ.
3.2.1 As usual in Ṣarf, every structure has a wazn and mawzuun.
The wazn of ﻢﺳﺇ ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ is numerous.
Some of the popular ones are ٌﻝﺎﱠﻌَﻓ – ْﻝﻮُﻌَﻓ – ٌﻞﻴِﻌَﻓ – ٌﻞِﻌَﻓ.
Examples: ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻣ ﻥﺯﻭ Fortune giver: ٌﻕِﺯﺍَﺭ The providence: ٌﻕﺍﱠﺯَﺭ ٌﻝﺎﱠﻌَﻓ The knower: ٌﻢِﻟﺎَﻋ The all knowing: ٌﻡﱠﻼَﻋ The eater: ٌﻞِﻛﺁ The great ٌﻝﺎﱠﻛَﺃ Repentant ٌﺐِﺋﺎَﺗ oft-forgiving ٌﺏﺍﱠﻮَﺗ Forgiver ٌﺮِﻓﺎَﻏ oft-forgiving ٌﺭﺎﱠﻔَﻏ Forgiver ٌﺮِﻓﺎَﻏ Oft-forgiving ٌﺭﻮُﻔَﻏ ٌﻝﻮُﻌَﻓ player ٌﺐِﻋَﻻ fond of play ٌﺏﻮٌﻌَﻟ Merciful ٌﻢِﺣﺍَﺭ The all-Merciful ٌﻡﻮٌﺣَﺭ Merciful ٌﻢِﺣﺍَﺭ Exceedingly merciful ٌﻢﻴِﺣَﺭ ٌﻞﻴِﻌَﻓ Conscious ٌﺪِﺷﺍَﺭ exceedingly intelligent ٌﺪﻴِﺷَﺭ God is Oft-forgiving ٌﺭﺎﱠﻔَﻏ َﷲﺍ ﱠﻥِﺇ In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful ِﻢﻴِﺣﱠﺮﻟﺍ ِﻦَﻤْﺣﱠﺮﻟﺍ ِﷲﺍ ِﻢْﺴِﺑ For Abraham is most tender hearted, forbearing ٌﻢﻴِﻠَﺣ ُﻩﺍﱠﻭَﻷ ﻢﻴِﻫﺍَﺮْﺑِﺇ ﱠﻥِﺇ Musaylimah is a pathological liar ٌﺏﺍﱠﺬَﻛ ﺔَﻤِﻠْﻴَﺴُﻤْﻟﺍ ﱠﻥِﺇ Zayd is a glutton (eating too much) ٌﻝﺎﱠﻛَﺃ ﺍًﺪْﻳَﺯ ﱠﻥِﺇ Your brother is a rover ٌﻝﺍﱠﻮَﺟ َﻙﺎَﺧَﺃ ﱠﻥِﺇ You are very intelligent ٌﺪﻴِﺷَﺭ َﻚﱠﻧِﺇ A playful baby ٌﺏﻮُﻌَﻟ ٌﺔَﻠْﻔِﻃ You may take note from the examples given above that ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ is a special morphological structure to appropriately describe some one who is involved or indulge with an action in an extraordinary manner.
Self Assessment Exercise Give any five ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ and use them in sentences.
4.0 Conclusion Two factors can assist you to accumulate as many ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ as possible as well as mastering of their usage in sentences.
The two are the wazn given to you above and reading of the Holy Qur’an.
ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ is very common in the Qur’an.
5.0 Summary 72 ARA012: Arabic Morphology Your attention has been drown in this concluding unit to the terms ﻥﺯﻭ – ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻣ and ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ due to their effect on different aspects of Ṣarf.
For example, whenever you are to do conjugation, the terms ﻥﺯﻭ and ﻥﻭﺯﻮﻣ come handy.
In any conjugation exercise, ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ normally features and that will remind you of ﻢﺳﺇ ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ.
You can see the interconnectedness between the terms treated in this unit and other aspects of Ṣarf.
It is like revising the whole Ṣarf note.
6.0 Tutor marked Assignment By means of conjugation, bring out ﻞﻋﺎﻔﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ and ﺔﻐﻟﺎﺒﻤﻟﺍ ﻢﺳﺇ from the following verbs: َﺢَﻔَﺳ - َﺢَﺘَﻓ - َﻊِﻤَﺳ - َﺏِﺮَﺷ - َﻊَﻛَﺭ.
