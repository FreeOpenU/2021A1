6 Summary…………………………………….……………….. 7 Introduction ARA 183: Arabic Conversation is a two- unit course taught in the first semester of the first year of B.A.
Islamic Studies programmes.
It is available for Islamic major students and also for the non-majors since it is especially packaged to suit both levels of major and non-major students.
This course exposes you to Arabic language as a vehicle of communication and expression of ideas and feelings.
It allows you to acquire oral and conversational competence that will empower you to engage others in the spoken Arabic.
vARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION To help you attain this feat, we have broken the course into fourteen units.
In the first unit we will adequately introduce you to the Arabic language consonants and vowels as well as other issues relating to them.
We have in a simple and clear style treated these issues so that the unit will serve as an effective key with which you will be able to open discussions in the language.
After this, we have in the other 13 units brought simplified conversations on varieties of issues.
Hence, after this course you will be very familiar with Arabic expressions and conversational methods.
Course Aims This course contains 14 units with each unit stating clearly its objectives.
However, the course has its overall aims which include: 3 To introduce you to Arabic language as a functional tool of communication.
4 To teach you the way native speakers of Arabic express their thoughts and feelings 5 To expose you to the language culture and civilization of the Arabs.
6 To give you words and expressions that are in use in different contexts.
7 To encourage you to learn further the language of the Arabs.
Course Objectives We have packaged this course in such a way that it will give you the potency and the will to do certain things.
It is our hope that after a thorough study of this course, you should be able to: 3 Read smoothly any text written in Arabic 4 Comprehend speeches delivered in Arabic 5 Speak fluently in Arabic language 6 Engage colleagues in the speaking of Arabic 7 Partake in discussions based on Arabic 8 Describe objects and events happening around you in good Arabic.
Working through this Course viARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION There are fourteen study units compartmentalized in three Modules in this course.
All of them are mandatory on you to work through if you wish to have a good standing in interactions with Arabic language.
Course Materials The main components of this course are: 1.0 Course Guide 2.0 Unit Components of Study Modules 3.0 Text-books 4.0 Assignments File 5.0 Presentation Schedule Study Units Module 1 Unit 1 The Arabic Alphabets and Related Issues Unit 2 Conversation on Greetings and Introduction Unit 3 Conversation on the Family Membership Unit 4 Conversation on Postal Services Unit 5 Conversation on Medical Services Module 2 Unit 1 Conversation on the School Unit 2 Conversation with School Mate Unit 3 Conversation on Transportation Unit 4 Conversation on Communication Module 3 Unit 1 Conversation on Religion Unit 2 Conversation on Good Morals Unit 3 Conversation on Business Transactions Unit 4 Conversation on Manual Unit 5 Military Services and Sports viiARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION Textbooks and References The conversations here are a result of our age-long interactions in Arabic and field experience.
However, some reading materials have actually provided light for us.
These books and reading materials are contained in the reference sections at the end of each unit.
Try to get these books and read them so that you can widen your horizon.
Assignments File In this file, you will find all the details of the work you must submit to your tutor for marking.
The marks you obtain from these assignments will count towards the final marks you obtain for this course.
Further information on assignments will be found in the Assignments File itself and later in this Course Guide in the section on assessment.
Tutor-Marked Assignment Every study unit has its assignments.
You are advised to work through all the assignments and submit them for assessment.
Your tutor will assess the assignments and select four which will constitute the 30% of your final grade.
The tutor-marked assignments may be presented to you in a separate file.
Just know that at the end of every unit there are some tutor-marked assignments for you.
It is important you do and submit them for assessment.
Final Examination and Grading The final examination will be a test of three hours.
All areas of the course will be examined.
Find time to read the unit all over before your examination.
The final examination will attract 70% of the total course grade.
The examination will consist of questions, which reflect the kinds of self assessment exercises and tutor marked assignment you have previously encountered.
And all aspects of the course will be assessed.
You should use the time between completing the last unit, and taking the examination to revise the entire course.
Course Marking Scheme The following table lays out how the actual course mark allocation is broken down.
Assessment Marks Assignments (Best Three Assignments out of Four Marked) = 30% viiiARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION Final Examination = 70% Total 100% Course Overview and Presentation Schedule The dates for submission of all assignments will be communicated to you.
You will also be told the date of completing the study units and dates for examinations.
Unit Title of Work Weeks Activity Course Guide Module 1 1 The Arabic Alphabets and related issues Week 1 2 Greetings and Introduction.
Week 2 3 The Family Week 3 Assignment 1 4 Postal Services Week 4 5 Medical Services Week 5 Module 2 1 The School I Week 6 2 The School II Week 7 3 Transportation Week 8 Assignment 2 4 Communication Week 9 Module 3 1 Religion Week 10 2 Good Morals Week 11 3 Business Transaction Week 12 Assignment 3 4 Manual Labour Week 13 5 Military Services and Sports Week 14 Revision 1 Examination 1 Assignment 4 Total 14 How to Get the Most from the Course Since you will have minimal contact with the lecturer of this course, you are expected to do a lot of independent studying.
As you study independently, take notes about points that you do not understand and endeavour to clear up such points at the various tutorials and discussions organised on the course.
Each unit is interspersed with self-tests which are meant to enable you to evaluate yourself against the set objectives in the units as you progress.
You are advised to take the unit objectives seriously since they will guide you in your reading of the unit contents.
ixARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION In distance learning, the study units replace the university lecture.
This is one of the great advantages of distance learning; you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suits you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to the lecturer.
In the same way a lecturer might give you some reading to do, the study units tell you where to read, and which are your text materials or set books.
You are provided exercises to do at appropriate points, just as a lecturer might give you an in-class exercise.
Each of the study units follows a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the subject matter of the unit, and how a particular unit is integrated with the other units and the course as a whole.
Next to this is a set of learning objectives.
These objectives let you know what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
These learning objectives are meant to guide your study.
The moment a unit is finished, you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If this is made a habit, then you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.
The main body of the unit guides you through the required reading from other sources.
This will usually be either from your set books or from a Reading section.
The following is a practical strategy for working through the course.
If you run into any trouble, telephone your tutor.
Remember that your tutor’s job is to help you.
When you need assistance, do not hesitate to call and ask your tutor to provide it: 1.
Read this Course Guide thoroughly, it is your first assignment.
2.
Organize a Study Schedule.
Design a ‘Course Overview’ to guide you through the course.
Note the time you are expected to spend on each unit and how the assignments relate to the units.
Important information, e.g.
details of your tutorials, and the date of the first day of the Semester is available from the study centre.
You need to gather all the information into one place, such as your diary or a wall calendar.
Whatever method you choose to use, you should decide on and write in your own dates and schedule of work for each unit.
3.
Once you have created your own study schedule, do everything to stay faithful to it.
The major reason why students fail is that they get behind in their course work if you get into difficulties with your schedule, please, let your tutor know before it is too late for help.
4.
Turn to Unit I, and read the introduction and the objectives for the unit.
xARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION 5.
Assemble the study materials.
You will need your set books and the unit you are studying at any point in time.
6.
Work through the unit.
As you work through the unit, you will know what sources to consult for further information.
7.
Keep in touch with your study centre.
Up-to-date course information will be continuously available there.
8.
Well before the relevant due dates (about 4 weeks before due dates), keep in mind that you will learn a lot by doing the assignment carefully.
They have been designed to help you meet the objectives of the course and, therefore, will help you pass the examination.
Submit all assignments not later than the due date.
• Review the objectives for each study unit to confirm that you have achieved them.
if you feel unsure about any of the objectives, review the study materials or consult your tutor.
• When you are confident that you have achieved a unit’s objectives, you can start on the next unit.
Proceed unit by unit through the course and try to pace your study so that you keep yourself on schedule.
• When you have submitted an assignment to your tutor for marking, do not wait for its return before stating on the next unit.
Keep to your schedule.
When the assignment is returned, pay particular attention to your tutor’s comments, both on the tutor-marked assignment form and also the written comments on the ordinary assignments.
• After completing the last unit, review the course and prepare yourself for the final examination.
Check that you have achieved the unit objectives (listed at the beginning of each unit) and the course objectives (listed in the Course Guide).
Facilitators/Tutors and Tutorials Information relating to the tutorials will be provided at the appropriate time.
Your tutor will mark and comment on your assignments, keep a close watch on your progress and on any difficulties you might encounter and provide assistance to you during the course.
You must take your tutor-marked assignments to the study centre well before the xiARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION due date (at least two working days are required).
They will be marked by your tutor and returned to you as soon as possible.
Do not hesitate to contact your tutor if you need help.
Contact your tutor if: 1. you do not understand any part of the study units or the assigned readings 2. you have difficulty with the exercises 3. you have a question or problem with an assignment or with your tutor’s comments on an assignment or with the grading of an assignment.
You should try your best to attend the tutorials.
This is the only chance to have face-to-face contact with your tutor and ask questions which are answered instantly.
You can raise any problem encountered in the course of your study.
To gain the maximum benefit from course tutorials, prepare a question list before attending them.
You will learn a lot from participating in discussion actively.
Summary Arabic Conversation is a course that sets to provide you with the required conversational competence in Arabic language.
xiiARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION This is why it teaches you how to identify Arabic letters and word, pronounce them and make speeches with them.
The various topics under which we have composed the conversations are life issues which have direct relevance to your environment.
After studying this course you will discover that you have attained a certain progress level different from what you were before this course.
We wish you success in your study and hope that you will find it both interesting and useful.

Like few other world languages, it enjoys relevance in international discourse on both secular and religious matters.
But like any other language, to attain proficiency in conversations with Arabic, knowledge of basics such as its consonants and vowels, pronunciation and writing of the letters and words as well as other related facts must be mastered.
In this unit, therefore, we will treat these basics in a simple and clear style that will make it easy for you to acquire the required solid and enabling background in the language.
1ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • identify Arabic vowels and consonants • pronounce Arabic letters and words correctly write • Arabic letters and words correctly.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Arabic Alphabet The Arabic alphabet consists of 29 letters.
With the exception of the first letter, Arabic letters are all consonants.
Arabs start writing their language from the right hand side to the left and there are no capital letters in Arabic.
3.2 Identification of Arabic Letters To facilitate your easy identification of these letters, we will present the letters in a tabular form that will show their shape while standing alone, their name in Arabic and their transliteration.
Letter Name Translite Letter Name Translitera - ration tion ا Alif - ض Đaad D ب Baa’ B ط Taa’ T ت Taa’ T ظ Zaa’ Z ث Thaa’ Th ع cayn C ج Jiim J غ Ghayn Gh ح Haa’ H ف Faa’ F خ Khaa’ Kh ق Qaaf Q د Daal D ك Kaaf K ذ Dhaal Dh ل Laam L ر Raa’ R م Miim M ز Zaay Z ن Nuun N س Siin S ه Haa’ H ش Shiin Sh و Waaw W ص Saad S ي Yaa’ Y ء Hamzah , 2ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION Observations 1.
(’alif) has two uses, viz: (a) it serves as a tool to elongate the /a/ vowel; as in با[ب baabun لا[ق qaala ى[ت[أ [ل[أ[س (b) it carries the Hamza, as in , ه 2.
Letter (Haa’) serves in two ways: [ه[ز[ن [م[ره[ (a) as a substantive letter, as in , (b) as a sign of feminine, as in ة[مmطاف[ ,ة[ر[ج[ش, here, it must have two dots on top.
3.3 Pronunciation of Arabic Consonants The following letters have almost the same pronunciation with their English equivalents.
The table below shows this: Arabic letter English equivalent ب B, as in boy ت t, as in ten ث th, as in think ج j, as in joy د d, as in day ذ dh, as in that ر r, as in ram ز z, as in zeal س S, as in so ش sh, as in show ف f, as in fan ك k, as in keep ل l, as in lad م m, as in Mother: ن n, as in nurse ه h, as in ha و w, as in one ي y, as in yes However, there are some letters in Arabic that have special pronunciations.
These letters and how they are produced can be seen in the table below: 3ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION Letter Place and Manner of articulation ح h = Pronounced with a strong and sustained explosion of the breath, as in ‘house’.
خ kh = Pronounced with a deep rasping, guttural sound.
The Scots ‘Loch’ is pronounced nearly like it .
ص s = Pronounced with the teeth slightly apart, pressing the tip of the tongue against the lower teeth and raising the tongue to press also against the upper teeth and palate, the English ‘soft’ is near to it.
ض d = Pronounced with the tongue pressing hard against the edge of the upper teeth with the lip protruding.
The tongue and upper teeth part company rather violently to allow a following vowel sound to come through or another consonant to be articulated.
ط t = Pronounced with tongue and teeth in the same position as for ض ظ z = Pronourced with tongue and teeth in the same position as for ص ع c = Is a guttural stop pronounced with constriction of the larynx.
غ gh = This is the sound you make while gargling.
ق q = Is a guttural ‘K’ pronounced from the back of the throat ء= ‘ It is a glottal stop.
3.4 Shapes of Arabic Letters in the Word Characteristically, Arabic letters assume different forms at different positions in the word.
The form of the letter may be different at the middle of the word from what it is at the initial position of the word.
Letter Initial Medial Final ا ا as in حتفا ا/اـ as in لاق اـ as in اعد ب ـب as in ردب ـبـ as in ربص بـ as in بلك ت ـت as in رمت ـتـ as in حتف تـ as in تحت ث ـث as in جلث ـثـ as in لثم ثـ as in ثيل ج ـج as in دلج ـجـ as in لجن جـ as in جلب ح ـح as in رسح ـحـ as in رحس حـ as in حير خ ـخ as in رمخ ـخـ as in لخب خـ as in خم د د as in رهد دـ as in ردب دـ as in دلج ذ ذ as in نهذ ذـ as in رذح ذـ as in ذتلا ر ر as in لمر رـ as in بارت رـ as in ريخ / راد ز ز as in نمز زـ as in بزح زـ as in زمر 4ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION س ـس as in لاس ـسـ as in رسح سـ as in سم ش ـش as in سمش ـشـ as in رشب شـ as in شبك ص ـص as in ربص ـصـ as in رصب صـ as in صم ض ـض as in ررض ـضـ as in رضح ضـ as in ضح ط ـط as in لبط ـطـ as in لطب طـ as in طبر ظ ـظ as in رفظ ـظـ as in لظنح ظـ as in ظح ع ـع as in رذع ـعـ as in رعس عـ as in عمس غ ـغ as in ريغ ـغـ as in رغص غـ as in غلب ف ـف as in قلف ـفـ as in رفغ فـ as in فتلا ق ـق as in رمق ـقـ as in سقط قـ as in قلف ك ـك as in بلك ـكـ as in بكس كـ as in كيد ل ـل as in سبل ـلـ as in دلب لـ as in لجن م ـم as in رم ـمـ as in رمت مـ as in ملظ ن ـن as in رمن ـنـ as in تنب نـ as in نمأ ـه ـه as in ةره ـهـ as in رهن هـ as in هيت و و as in لبو وـ as in زوف وـ as in ولد ي ـي as in نمي ـيـ as in تيب يـ as in يبظ ء أ as in رمأ ؤ ,أ ,ـئـ ئ ,ؤ ,أ as in مؤل ,بأد ,رئظ as in ئيش ,ؤلؤل ,لم Observations Note that the following six letters: ا ,د ,ذ ر ,ز, and و cannot be joined to the letters following them as you can see from the Table above.
Note also that the letters ت ,ث ,د ,ذ ,ر ,ز ,س ,ش ,ص ,ض ,ط ,ظ ,ل, and ن are called sun letters and they assimilate the ‘ا’ of the definite article ل ا (al).
The Doubled Consonants (shaddah) If two identical consonants co-occur unseparated by a vowel, only one is physically written and the sign (w) is put on it in lieu of the second consonant.
Note that the one physically written is the second letter while the first is the one assimilated and represented with a (w).
This sign is called shaddah.
For example, the word ج[ل was originally م»لع , ج جل was formerly مللع and ب»رد was previously بررد .
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Write out Arabic consonants and show how they look like in the medial and final positions of the word.
5ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION The Arabic Vowels Arabic has two types of vowels: short and long vowels The Short Vowels There are three short vowels in Arabic, viz: fat-hah ( َ), kesrah ( ) and dummah ( ).
These symbols, called vowels, are written either on top or underneath the Arabic consonant not beside it like the English writing.
Fat-hah ( ) is pronounced as /a/ sound, Kesrah ( ) as /i/ sound and dummah ( ) as /u/ sound.
Sukun ( ) on the other hand signifies vowellessness.
That is, the consonant that carries a sukun has no vowel and should be pronounced as such e.g.
ب is pronounced /b/, تis pronounced /t/ etc.
Sukun is also used to indicate a resting on the consonant in question if it occurs at the end of the word.

The Long Vowels Three of the Arabic letters are used as signs of elongation.
The letters ,و ,ي are ا .
Let me inform you that when these three letters of elongation in certain ways follow the three short vowels discussed above, they become long vowels.
How will these letters follow the short vowels to change them to long vowels?
Before that, know that in this context these letters are called huruf madd i.e.
Letters of elongation.
ا When the vowel fat-hah ( ) is followed by , it becomes a long fat-hah, لا[ق را[ص e.g qaala and saara.
When the vowel Kasrah ( ) is followed ي هيmف نيmد by it becomes long kasrah, e.g fiihi and diinu.
When the و نو`د vowel dummah ( ) is followed by it becomes long dummah, e.g قو`س duuna and suuqun.
7ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION Doubled Vowels (Nunation) Know that all three short vowels of Arabic can be doubled at the end of the word to indicate that the word is indefinite.
When this happens, the doubled vowel is not pronounced twice.
The first is pronounced normally while the second is pronounced as a nasal sound /n/.
Hence, the doubled fat-hah called fat-hataan e.g اد´[ل[و is pronounced ‘waladan’, not waladaa and ة[قر[و is pronounced ‘waraqatan’ not waraqataa.
Note that the ا in ا´د[لو[ is not alif madd (alif of elongation).
It is rather there to serve as a prop for the doubled fat-hah.
And the doubled kasrah called kasrataan e.g د[لو[ is pronounced ‘waladin’ not waladii and ة[ق[رو[ is pronounced ‘waraqatin’ not warawatii.
Also, the doubled dummah called dummataan e.g د[ل[و and ة[ق[رو[ is pronounced ‘waladun’ and ‘waraqatun’ respectively not waladuu and waraqatuu.
Note on Hamza.
David Cowan writes thus: “There are two kinds of hamza: عˆط[قلˆا ة`[زˆم[ه Hamzat-al-qatc ‘the cutting hamza’ and mلˆص[ولا ة`[زˆم[ه hamzat-al-wasl ‘the joining hamza’.
“Example of hamzat-al-qatc is: ل[ك[أ ’akala, ل[أ[س sa’ala ل[م mala’ and that of hamzat-al-wasl is با[ب mتي[بˆلا baabu-l-bayt”.
Discussion on hamzah will consume a whole unit on its own.
Suffice it is to know here that we have two types of hamzah and (2) how to pronounce them.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Write twenty Arabic words and vocalize them 2.
Discuss the short and long vowels of Arabic and bring enough examples for them 3.
Discuss nunation, doubled consonants and hamza.
4.0 CONCLUSION It is nice to conclude that a knowledge of Arabic alphabet will assist the learner to have a firm grip on the language and a strong conversational confidence when it is time to perform or part take in any discussion using the medium of the language.
Words and expressions of any language will not come from vacuum; it is he who can identify the sounds and letters of the language that will be able to produce its words and expressions.
8ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have treated the Arabic consonants and their related issues as well as vowels and their related issues.
Consonant issues such as shapes, pronounciation, strengthening, doubling and vowel issues such as shortness, longness, doubling, hamzah related issues are all discussed here.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT 1.
Discuss the Arabic consonants and the issues relating to them.
2.
Write out the Arabic consonants, vocalize them with short vowels, then write another set of consonants and apply the long vowels in them.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
With correct transliteration, write out ten Arabic words that centre on greeting.
2.
Compose a good Arabic conversation between two people who are meeting for the first time.
12ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION 4.0 CONCLUSION It is part of the cultures of all peoples that one must greet.
This is a prelude to any interaction whatsoever.
This implies that all languages of the world must have formulae or patterns of greeting.
Hence, Arabic language, being a language in regular use has its own formulas, which are followed by its speakers.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have brought in conversations some of the Arabic formulae for greeting and introduction.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Jaamiu and cUmar are now your friends.
Could you recollect how your meeting with each of them for the first time looked like?
Let us see in Arabic the conversations that took place.

22ARA 183 ARABIC CONVERSATION 4.0 CONCLUSION You would agree with me that it will be very difficult to speak a language whose words-at least the routine ones-have not been mastered.
This unit, therefore, has strived to put before you words in Arabic which you can easily memorize and put into immediate use.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have centered discussions on family.
Terms used for members of the family ranging from the nuclear to the most extended have been put forward for your consumption.
We have also deliberately treated in the conversations here other matters so that you can benefit from those ones too.
