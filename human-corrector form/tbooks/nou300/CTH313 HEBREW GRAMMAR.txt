Assignment 21 REVISION 16 EXAMINATION 17 TOTAL 17 Weeks Table 2: Course Overview How to get the best from this course In distance learning the study units replace the university lecturer.
This is one of the great advantages of distance learning; you can read and work through specially xii designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suit you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to a lecturer.
In the same way that a lecturer might set you some reading to do, the study units tell you when to read your set books or other material.
Just as a lecturer might give you an in-class exercise, your study units provide exercises for you to do at appropriate points.
Each of the study units follows a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the subject matter of the unit and how a particular unit is integrated with the other units and the course as a whole.
Next is a set of learning objectives.
These objectives enable you know what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
You should use these objectives to guide your study.
When you have finished the units you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If you make a habit of doing this you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.
The main body of the unit guides you through the required reading from other sources.
This will usually be either from your set books or from a Reading section.
Remember that your tutor’s job is to assist you.
When you need help, don’t hesitate to call and ask your tutor to provide it.
1.
Read this Course Guide thoroughly.
2.
Organize a study schedule.
Refer to the ‘Course overview’ for more details.
Note the time you are expected to spend on each unit and how the assignments relate to the units.
Whatever method you chose to use, you should decide on it and write in your own dates for working on each unit.
3.
Once you have created your own study schedule, do everything you can to stick to it.
The major reason that students fail is that they lag behind in their course work.
4.
Turn to Unit 1 and read the introduction and the objectives for the unit.
5.
Assemble the study materials.
Information about what you need for a unit is given in the ‘Overview’ at the beginning of each unit.
You will almost always need both the study unit you are working on and one of your set books on your desk at the same time.
6.
Work through the unit.
The content of the unit itself has been arranged to provide a sequence for you to follow.
As you work through the unit you will be instructed to read sections from your set books or other articles.
Use the unit to guide your reading.
7. Review the objectives for each study unit to confirm that you have achieved them.
If you feel unsure about any of the objectives, review the study material or consult your tutor.
xiii 8.
When you are confident that you have achieved a unit’s objectives, you can then start on the next unit.
Proceed unit by unit through the course and try to pace your study so that you keep yourself on schedule.
9.
When you have submitted an assignment to your tutor for marking, do not wait for its return before starting on the next unit.
Keep to your schedule.
When the assignment is returned, pay particular attention to your tutor’s comments, both on the tutor-marked assignment form and also written on the assignment.
Consult your tutor as soon as possible if you have any questions or problems.
10.
After completing the last unit, review the course and prepare yourself for the final examination.
Check that you have achieved the unit objectives (listed at the beginning of each unit) and the course objectives (listed in this Course Guide).
Tutors and Tutorials There are 8 hours of tutorials provided in support of this course.
You will be notified of the dates, times and location of these tutorials, together with the name and phone number of your tutor, as soon as you are allocated a tutorial group.
Your tutor will mark and comment on your assignments, keep a close watch on your progress and on any difficulties you might encounter and provide assistance to you during the course.
You must mail your tutor-marked assignments to your tutor well before the due date (at least two working days are required).
They will be marked by your tutor and returned to you as soon as possible.
Do not hesitate to contact your tutor by telephone, e-mail, or discussion board if you need help.
The following might be circumstances in which you would find help necessary.
Contact your tutor if: • you do not understand any part of the study units or the assigned readings, • you have difficulty with the self-tests or exercises, • You have a question or problem with an assignment, with your tutor’s comments on an assignment or with the grading of an assignment.
You should try your best to attend the tutorials.
This is the only chance to have face to face contact with your tutor and to ask questions which are answered instantly.
You can raise any problem encountered in the course of your study.
To gain the maximum benefit from course tutorials, prepare a question list before attending them.
You will learn a lot from participating in discussions actively.

3.2 Some Tips in Mastering Hebrew Grammar 3.3 The Future of Biblical Scholarship in Africa 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Hebrew is the original language of the Old Testament.
Every other version of the Old Testament you see today is an offshoot or a translation from the original language.
For one to work with the original manuscript of the Bible and make a meaningful interpretation of the texts, one needs to have a good working knowledge of the language of the original manuscript, which was Hebrew.
This Unit 1 sets off the study of the Hebrew Grammar by showing the reasons for the study of Biblical Hebrew, and why it is relevant to comtemporary biblical scholarship.
Subsequently, the elements of Hebrew Grammar are studied from Units 2 to 21, grouped under three modules.
1 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Discuss the importance of studying Hebrew Grammar in contemporary biblical scholarship.
• Appreciate the role of language and culture in understanding the history of a people.
• Access different tips in mastering biblical Hebrew.
• Analyze the relationship between studying Hebrew Grammar and the future of biblical scholarship in Africa.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Why Study Biblical Hebrew?
A good knowledge of Hebrew, which was the original language of the Old Testament, will facilitate a better translation and interpretation of its message.
The Old Testament was written by Hebrews centuries before the birth of Christ, whose culture and lifestyle were different from our own.
A people’s language is much related to their culture, without an understanding of the Hebrew culture we cannot fully understand their language.
To cross this cultural bridge, those who impart knowledge to others need to understand the ancient Hebrew culture, lifestyle and language.
Our focus in this course is to obtain a working knowledge of the Hebrew grammar, which is one step to grasping the soul of the Old Testament.
Even Martin Luther recognized the importance of Hebrew when he said, “If I were younger, I would want to learn this language, because no one can really understand the scriptures without it” (www.
Familybible.org/articles/messianic/whystudyhebrew.htm – 27/06/2011).
On the basis of this, pastors, priests, theological students and scholars are encouraged to get proficiency in the language in order to communicate the message of the scripture effectively.
In fact, one cannot major in Old Testament or New Testament studies without exhibiting a good working knowledge of the biblical languages.
Hebrew is the language of modern Israel, one of the world’s fastest-growing high-tech economies and a country of constant importance on world stage.
If you are interested in research on the Middle East or in working there, knowledge of Hebrew is invaluable.
The Lord Jesus knew Hebrew (Matt.
5:18, Luk 4:16-20, Acts 26:14).
Hebrew is the foundation of the New Testament: in fact all of the original authors of the New Testament were Jews who spoke and read Hebrew (Acts 21:40; 22:2; John 5:2; Luke 23:28; Acts 15:13-21).
Studying Hebrew will give you new insight into the meaning of the New Testament writings (www.hebrew4christians.com/grammar - 27/06/2011).
2 3.2 Some Tips in Mastering Hebrew Grammar This study manual is divided into 21 units, which concentrate on introductory grammar with progressive exercises in reading and writing.
Every unit contains the Unit Exercises; Practice Grid or Vocabulary.
The student is encouraged to follow the outline of study presented in the units sequentially, in order to promote learning.
Other useful tips that will promote learning of Hebrew Grammar is to maintain constancy in learning (not necessarily spending long hours, but a daily practice is recommended); study and practice with unit exercises, which will facilitate acquaintance to the lessons studied; regular writing practice with the grids provided is highly encouraged; and the vocabularies were provided for memorizing.
Students are encouraged to make an improvised vocabulary cards they can carry about for casual references.
Online sources with visual aids and audio are recommended in some units.
The student will find these resources helpful in studying Hebrew.
3.3 The Future of Biblical Scholarship in Africa To a great extent, biblical study in Africa is still reliant on secondary materials because of its continuous dependence on translated versions of the scripture.
The great contributions of bible translators notwithstanding, undue reliance on a translated version could tantamount into building a castle on a faulty foundation.
In one Nigerian Church, one zealous youth was interpreting in Igbo for his minister who was preaching in English.
The minister said, “Who will bell the cat in Nigeria?” and the zealous youth interpreted, “Onye ga-atopu nwamba n’ulo mkporo na Nigeria?”- {who will bail the cat from prison in Nigeria?}
Definitely, many simple minds may not have understood what transpired in that translation.
But it was certain that the interpreter deviated from what the preacher intended to communicate.
Relying on a secondary text for biblical interpretation is like building a tower on an unknown foundation.
Whether or not the foundation suits the tower is left to fate or luck.
A number of reasons contributed to the lack of interest in the Hebrew Grammar in many Universities and Theological Seminaries in Africa.
Some of the reasons being that available textbooks in Hebrew Grammar were not simplified enough to suit the African context, and stimulate a deep rooted interest among the students.
Another being that Hebrew Textbooks were not readily available in bookshops and School Libraries.
Even when a few of them were ordered or procured from far away places, it did not usher in the needed enthusiasm expected from the students.
This outcome was obvious because some of the books were very expensive; and even when you own a copy, it was usually difficult to make a private study with them.
This study manual is an attempt to provide a simplified and a contextualized Hebrew textbook for the African context.
Though it may not eradicate the fear some students 3 have for Hebrew Grammar; it has been structured and simplified for either a private study, or learning in a classroom setting.
4 CONCLUSION This unit discussed why the study of Hebrew Grammar is necessary for biblical scholarship.
It presented regular study in progressive writing and reading as a way of mastering it.
Also, it argued that the future of biblical scholarship in Africa is dependent on the type of attidute adopted towards Hebrew grammar.
5 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt that understanding biblical Hebrew Grammar will equip you for a strong bible translation and interpretation.
Next unit will present the Hebrew Alphabet.
6 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENTS • Give five reasons why we should study Hebrew Grammar today.
• How is Hebrew Grammar relevant to biblical scholarship in Africa?

In English Language, vocalization is impossible without the vowel.
A tradition of pronunciation of Hebrew consonants was in vogue before the vowel marks were developed to assist the younger generations.
Scholars believe that the Tiberian scribes added the vowel marks in order to retain the memory of original vocalization.
There is no distinction of capitals (upper case or lower case), italics, etc.
The Hebrew is written from right to left.
2.0 OBJECTIVE By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Identify Hebrew Alphabet, read and write them.
• Recite the entire Hebrew Alphabet in print.
• Transliterate (or give the equivalence of) Hebrew letters to English letters.
5 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Alphabet Listed below are the character sets of Hebrew letters.
Observe the English word that is associated with each Hebrew letter.
It is provided to aid your pronunciation of the Hebrew letter.
Start studying from right to left, from Aleph to Beth, in that order to the end.

The student is asked to note the guttural letters because special rules follow in their usage.
This will be studied in full later.
They are: ר ע ח ה א Resh Ayin Chet Hey Aleph 16 3.5 BeGaDKeFaT There are six letters with double pronunciation.
They may either appear with or without a dot placed in them.
When any of them begins a word or a syllable, it will appear with a dot which hardens the pronunciation.
The dot is referred to as a dagesh lene in Hebrew.
The acronym for remembering the six letters is BeGaDKeFaT.
Examples: תּ פּ כּ דּ גּ בּ Tav Pey Kaf Dalet Gimel Bet Without a dot, their pronunciation is soft.
The change in sound is particularly noticed פ כ ב in three letters, , , .
Examples: Book Name Pronounced Print בּ Bet b as in a boy ב Vet v as in vine כּ Kaf k as in kite כ Khaf ch as in bach פּ Pey p as in park פ Fey ph as in phone 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed how you can master the Hebrew Alphabet.
Without practice, it is impossible for anyone to just master them by memorizing.
The student should practice writing the Hebrew letters with the practice grids given above and below.
The alphabet should be read aloud as you write them.

Originally, Hebrew words lacked vowel letters.
A tradition of pronunciation of Hebrew consonants was in vogue before the vowel marks were developed to assist the younger generations.
א ה ו י Before the introduction of vowel signs in Hebrew, certain weak consonants were sometimes used to indicate the vowel sounds, and hence were called vowel א ה י ו letters.
and were used to indicate “a”, to indicate “e” and “i” and to indicate “o” and “u” class vowels.
Later on, the vowel signs were designed so that they could be inserted into a consonantal text without actually lengthening the text.
In other words, a pointed text (one supplied with vowels) of a given book of the Hebrew Bible should be exactly the same length as the un-pointed text of the same book.
Most of the vowels stand directly below the consonants with which they are to be pronounced.
The exceptions are cholem, cholem-vav, and shureq.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this Unit, you should be able to: • Able to read, write, and recite the Hebrew vowel system.
26 • Transliterate Hebrew words with much ease.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 A-Type Vowel In this section, א is used as a hypothetical letter where the vowel marks are attached.

Learn Hebrew online free (http:\\ www.Hebrew4Christians.com) English to Hebrew Translation (http:\\translation.babylon.com/English/to-hebrew) 29 UNIT 5 HALF-VOWEL SIGNS ( Sheva אא א אְְְְ ) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Simple Sheva 3.2 Compound Sheva 3.3 Transliteration 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Practice Grid 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Under normal circumstances, every Hebrew consonant should have a vowel sign under it or after it, unless it is standing at the end of the word.
In absence of that, Hebrew makes use of other vowels signs that could best be described as reduced vowels or half vowels.
They represent full vowels that have been abbreviated for phonetic purposes.
דיַבּ וֹמשׁלִ Thus, instead of writing: ... (lishmo … byad) One writes דיַבְּ …וֹמשְׁ לִ (lishmo … beyad) Sheva is of two kinds: (a) simple sheva and (b) compound sheva.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be to: • Identify Hebrew half-vowels and differentiate them from full vowels.
• Do a transliteration of Hebrew half-vowels and know how to read them in a word.
• Differentiate between the simple shevas and the compound sheva.
30 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Simple Sheva ( אא א אְְְְ ) Simple sheva is a neutral sound which may arise from any of the short vowels and אְ represents the minimum vowel sound.
Sheva ( ) is transliterated superscript ‘e’, אְ written this way (e).
Example, sheva ( ) is a very quickly uttered sound, as e in below, when the word is pronounced rapidly, so as to slur over the e and run the b and l almost (but not quite) together; thus b’low, not below, nor blow; p’lice, not י רִפְּ police, nor plice.
( is transliterated perî).
3.2 Compound Sheva ר עחהא אְ Guttural letters do not accept simple sheva ( ), but a compound sheva, אֲ אֱ אֳ namely: , , , Compound sheva is a combination of a sheva and the three short vowels.
אְ אַ אֲ Plus equals called chatef-patach אְ אֶ אֱ Plus equals called chatef- segol אְ אָ אֳ Plus equals called chatef-qamets ינִאֲ As in: (i) - ’anî, translated ‘I’ (ii) שׁוֹנאֱ - ’enôsh, translated ‘man, mankind’ (iii) ילִ חֳ - cholî, translated ‘sickness’ Notes: 1.
A sheva can be either vocal or silent.
It is vocal when it stands beneath a consonant that begins a syllable.
The silent sheva may be regarded as a syllable breaker because it always stands beneath a consonant that ends a תירִבְּ ךְלֶ מ֣ ֶ syllable.
Thus: (berît) is vocal, while (me-lekh) is silent.
2.
When two shevas occur together in the middle of a word, the first is silent and the second vocal.
The first marks the end of a syllable therefore a syllable breaker, while the second stands at the beginning of a new syllable therefore vocal.
Thus: וּלשְׁ מְ יִ (yîm-šelû), ( מְ ) is silent, while ( שְׁ ) is vocal.
31 3.
A sheva under a letter doubled by a dot (dagesh forte) is vocal.
Thus: וּלטְּ קִ is transliterated (qiṭ-ṭelû).
4.
A sheva is vocal when it is following a long vowel.
Example: התָ יְהָ is translitered (hā-yetāh) 3.3 Transliteration This section will provide the English equivalence of the Hebrew vowel letters in א their different types.
The letter is used hypothetically.
The vowel marks are placed under, above or beside the Hebrew consonant.
The chart below reviews the English transliteration for Hebrew full vowel points.

The student would get aquainted with their usage through regular practice.
5.0 SUMMARY The student should remark the main points made in the unit as follows: • We can classify the Hebrew vowels according to the basic sound they make (A, E, I, O, and U).
Compound shevas are formed by adding simple shevas to three short vowels (a, e, o).
The following table summarizes the vowel types: U O I E A Type וּא אֻ וֹא אָ אֹ יא ִ אִ יא ֵ אֶ אֵ אַ אָ Mark û U ô o ō î i ê e ē a ā Transliteration vl S vl s l vl s vl s l s l Class Sheva Mark אֳ אֱ אֲ אְ o e a e Transliteration r r r r Class Class key: long = l; short = s; very long = vl; reduced = r • There are four cases when the Sheva is vocal: 1.
When it begins a word (or syllable) 2.
When it is the second of two shevas in a row 3.
When it appears under a letter with a Dagesh Forte 4.
When it follows a syllable that contains a long vowel.
• Correlatively, there are four cases when the Sheva is silent: 1.
When it ends a word (or syllable) 33 2.
When it is the first of two shevas in a row 3.
When it closes a syllable 4.
When it follows a syllable that contains a short vowel.

That implies a syllable contains a single vowel sound in a word.
A good understanding of how Hebrew word is divided into syllables (i.e.
units of dinstinct sound), will facilitate a proper pronunciation of the words.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, the student should be able to: • Divide Hebrew words into syllables to facilitate proper reading, writing and reciting.
• Learn other basic particles associated with Hebrew syllables.
37 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Syllables Two rules There are two basic rules for dividing a Hebrew word into syllables, as explained below.
Rule 1: Determine the number of vowel sounds in the word.
Since there is one vowel per syllable, the number of syllables in a word is the same number of vowels.
Examples: דיָ (yād): One syllable (one vowel sound) רמַ שָׁ (shā-mar): Two syllables (two vowels sound) Rule 2: Syllables can be “open” or “closed”.
Open syllables end with a vowel sound and closed syllables end with a letter without a vowel: Examples: Consonant + Vowel = Open syllable יכִ (kî) Consonant + Vowel + Consonant = Closed syllable תבַּ (bat) 3.2 Syllables Classification Hebrew syllables can be classified as either: 1.
Open or Closed 2.
Long or Short (or Reduced) Note: i.
Whereas open syllables favour long vowels normally, closed syllables usually have short vowels.
ii.
Syllables which end in a vowel sound are called open syllables.
As in: וּהֹבוַ = va – bō – hû iii.
Syllables which end in a consonant are called closed.
As in: בוֹט = tôv ןיבֵּ = bên 38 לידִּ ־בְ מַ = mav – dîl iv.
A word contains as many syllables as it has vowels; but patach-furtive and sheva do not form syllables v. Syllables must begin with a consonant, the only exception being the prefixed conjunction וּ; they may begin with two consonants, the first always having under it a vocal sheva.
As in תירִבְּ (berît) vi.
Syllables may end in two consonants, but only when these are strong.
The harshness resulting from this combination is generally avoided by the insertion of a helping vowel.
vii.
The vowel of an unaccented open syllable must be long.
viii.
The vowel of a closed syllable must be short, unless it has the tone; when it has the tone, it may be long.
ix.
The vowel of an open accented syllable may be short.
3.3 Dagesh The word dagesh is from a root word which possibly expressed the idea of hardness.
The sign of dagesh is a dot in the bosom of a letter, and this dot was used to indicate both a lighter and a heavier kind of hardness.
When it indicates the lighter hardness it is called dagesh lene, when the stronger, it is called dagesh forte.
(a) Dagesh lene: There are six letters which have each a hard and a soft pronunciation – indicated in writing with or without a dot.
They are: בּ גּ דּ כּ פּ תּ (b) (g) (d) (k) (p) (t) ב ג ד כ פ ת (v) (g) (d) (kh) (f) (t) For more information on BeGaDKeFaT letters, refer to section 1.5 (b) Dagesh forte: Hebrew does not write a double consonant.
To indicate that a consonant has that kind of hardness which is duplication, it inserts in it a dot, as וּלּקַ in (qal-lû) when so used the dot is called dagesh forte.
לטֵּ קִ לטֵ טְ קִ Examples: = (qiṭ-ṭēl) 39 רשָּׂ הַ רשָׂ שְׂ הַ = (haś-śār) רשָּׂ מִ רשָׂ שְׂ מִ = (miś-śār) The dagesh forte can appear n ANY Hebrew consonant, including the Begadkefat letters except a guttural letter: ת שׁ שׂ ר ק צ פ ע ס נ מ ל כ י ט ח ז ו ה ד ג ב א Letter תּ שּׁ שּׂ קּ צּ פּ סּ נּ מּ לּ כּ יּ טּ זּ וּ דּ גּ בּ Dagesh In the list above, notice that every Hebrew letter (except the gutturals: Aleph, Hey, Chet, Ayin, and Resh) can appear with a dot inside - a dagesh forte.
(c) Note: 1.
Degesh lene is peculiar to the six BeGaDKeFaT letters (תפכדגב) 2.
Dagesh forte can appear in all letters (including the six letters – ר עחהא BeGaDKeFaT), with the exception of the guttural letters ( ).
3.4 Gutturals (ר עחהא) עחהא ר The guttural letters are and sometimes .
They are guttural letters because they are pronounced from the throat.
The following features should be noted about guttural letters: (a) Gutturals do not admit dagesh forte or lene since they cannot be doubled; but the preceding vowel is lengthened as compensation.
In this case a preceding… אַ אָ Patach ( ) lengthens to qamets ( ) אִ אֵ chireq ( ) lengthens to tsere ( ) אֻ ֹ א Qibbuts ( ) lengthens to cholem ( ) (b) Gutturals do not take a simple sheva ( אְ ) but a compound sheva, as in רשֶׁ אֲ ’asher, who, which, what םיהִ לֹאֱ ’elōhîm, God ילִ חֳ cholî, sickness 40 (c) Gutturals prefer the vowel patach ( אַ ) before them, and sometimes after them.
This preference is especially noticeable with the strong gutturals עחה.
When one of these gutturals occur at the end of a word and is preceded by an unchangeably long vowel that is not of the ‘a’ class, then another short ‘a’ sound must be inserted between this vowel and the guttural.
This short ‘a’ sound is called a patach furtive, because of its hurried pronunciation.
Patach furtive is not a full vowel and must not be regarded as increasing the number of syllables in a word.
It is represented in transliteration by a raised ‘a’, just as in the case of the chatef-patach, as in, חַוּרוְ Verûach עַיקִ רָ Rāqîa‘ חַנֹ Nōach הַֹבגָ gāvōah (d) A guttural letter points itself and the consonant preceding: that is a guttural with a chatef turns a preceding simple sheva (vocal) into the short vowel corresponding to the chatef; as in: דבֹ עֲ לְ דבֹ עֲ לַ becomes 3.5 Quiescent Letters (יוהא) ייייווווההההאאאא The letters are so feeble (in pronunciation) that, under certain conditions, they lose their consonantal character and quiesce (i.e.
they become silent).
Hence they are called quiescent letters.
Note: i.
א loses its consonantal power and is said to quiesce (or to be silent), when it stands at the end of a word; as in: ארָבָּ ארָקְ יִ אצֵ וֹתּ 41 ii.
א quiesces when it stands in the middle of a word; then (a) a preceding vowelless consonant receives its vowel, as in: תישִׁ ארַ תישִׁ אַ רְ for םישִׁ ארָ םישִׁ אָ רְ for תארַקְ לִ תאַ רְקִ לְ for Or (b) it loses its compound sheva after a preceding vowel.
The sheva disappears א as soon as quiesces and the preceding short vowel is strengthened in א compensation for the loss of the ; as in: םיהִ לֹאכֵּ םיהִ לֹאֱ כּֽ ֶ for רמֶ אֹ י רמֵ אֳ יַֽ for iii.
The consonant ה at the end of a word is always distinguished from the ה הּ. vowel-letter by the presence of a mappik But on account of its weakness it is often entirely lost, (1) In the case of the article after an inseparable preposition, as in רוֹאלָ רוֹאהָ לְ for ךְשֶׁ חלַ ךְשֶׁ חהַ לִ for (2) In Hif‘il , Hof‘al, and Hithpael forms after a preformative of gender or person, as in: לדֵּבְ יַ לדֵּבְ הַ יְ for האֶ רָתֵ האֶ רָהֵ תְ for (3) From between two vowels, which then contract, as in: וּנימִ לְ וּהנָ ימִ לְ for וֹבּ וּה בָּ for iv.
When the preposition ל (to) is prefixed to the word הדָוּהיְ (yehûdāh, הדָוּהיְלְ הדָוּהיְלִ Judah), the combination ( , leyehûdāh) first becomes 42 י (liyehûdāh), but the quiesces and loses its consonantal status, the word הדָוּהילִ becoming (lîhûdāh).
v. The word for ‘death’ is תוֶמָ (māvet) which, when taken together with a following word (e.g.
death of Moses) is spoken hurriedly and (becomes first תוְמָ ו a hypothetical māvt and then) the quiescs, producing the form השֶׁ מֹ ־תוֹמ .
3.6 Sign of the Direct Object (תאֵ ) A direct object is a word representing a person or thing upon which the action of a verb is performed.
The direct object may be either definite or indefinite.
If תאֵ definite, it is usually preceded by the article .
The particle serves merely as תאֵ the sign of the direct object and is therefore not to be translated.
may be written alone, or it may be joined by a maqqef to the following word.
In the latter אֵ אֶ םי ִמַ שָּׁ הַ תאֵ case tsere ( ) is shortened to segol ( ).
Thus we find in Gen.1:1, רוֹאהָ ־תאֶ but in Gen.1:4.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit has shown that a good understanding of Hebrew syllables will facilitate transliteration and reading.
Other important features like dagesh, gutturals, quiescient letters and sign of the direct object play vital roles in Hebrew grammar.
5.0 SUMMARY (a).
There are two basic rules for dividing a Hebrew word into syllables: 1.
The Number of Syllables in a word is determined by the number of Vowels in that word.
Since there is one vowel per syllable, the number of syllables in a word is the same as the number of vowels.
2.
Syllables can be "Open" or "Closed.” Open syllables end with a vowel sound and closed syllables end with a letter without a vowel.
43 (b).
Dagesh and Word Division.
A dagesh forte “emphasizes” a letter and thereby affects a word's syllabification by doubling the value of the consonant.
A letter with a dagesh forte always causes the previous syllable (if any) to be closed and in effect "divides" the syllable at the letter.
The dagesh in a Begedkephat letter is forte only if it is preceded by a vowel (otherwise it is lene).
The general rule for dotted letters is this: If there is a "dot" inside a letter, "double" its value; but if it is a Begedkephat letter, double the value only if it is preceded by a vowel.
(c).
Quiescent Letters The letters: Aleph, Hey, Vav, and Yod can sometimes be “quiescent,” that is, silent under certain circumstances.

Write the Hebrew on one side of the card and the English translation on the reverse side; glance at these cards whenever you have a spare moment, (e.g.
when travelling, or waiting for someone at the top shop).
Practice pronouncing the Hebrew words aloud.

The New Hebrew student is encouraged to study the symbols in Hebrew in order not to confuse them with the vowel signs.
1.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Differentiate between vowel marks and other accent symbols in Hebrew.
• Identify their presence in a Hebrew text, and understand the roles they play.
2.0 MAIN CONTENT 2.1 Accents An accent is a mark or symbol, above or under a letter, used in writing and printing to indicate the quality of a vowel sound or a syllabic stress.
The accents have three uses: 46 a) To mark the tone-syllable, i.e.
to indicate the syllable to be stressed in pronunciation.
Usually the last syllable and sometimes the last but one syllable is stressed.
b) As punctuation marks, i.e.
they divide the verse into its logical constituent parts: stops and continuation marks.
c) As musical signs for chanting the scriptures in the synagogues.
Note: Hebrew accent signs are not printed in this grammar.
However, words accented on any syllable other than the final syllable are marked with a munah א֣ ( ).
ףלֶ א ֣ ָ תלֶ דּ֣ ָ ןיִ ז֣ ַ ךְלֶ מ֣ ֶ Examples: If a word appears without a munah, it can be assumed that it is accented on the final syllable.
התָּ אַ דוִדָּ השֶׁ מֹ לאֵ רָשְׂ יִ Examples: 2.2 Meteg (גתֶ מֽ ֶ ) Meteg (or a bridle) is a vertical line placed on the left side of a vowel point, to indicate that the syllable to which it belongs has a secondary accent.
Note: (a) Used on the second syllable before the tone, but generally on the third, if רוֹא־יהִ יְ וַֽ עַיקִ רָ הָֽ האֶ רָ תּֽ ֵ the second is closed.
As in: (b) Used with a long vowel followed by a vocal sheva.
As in: ה תָ יְ חָֽ וּצרְ שָֽׁ םאָ רְ בָּֽ הִ בְּ (c) Used with all vowels before compound sheva.
As in: המָ דָאֲ הָֽ השׂעֲ נַֽ תוֹשׂעֲ לַֽ (d) Used with a long vowel in a closed syllable, before maqqef.
As in: רהָ נָּ הַ ־ם שֽׁ ֵ וְ ןגָּ הַ ־ץ עֽ ֵ ה חָ ֹכּ־ת תֽ ֵ (e) Used with first syllable of all forms of היָהָ and היָחָ in which the ה and ח היֶהְ יִֽ היֶחְ יִֽ have simple (silent) sheva.
As in : (Gen 1.29) (Gen 17:18) 47 (f) Used with an unaccented אֵ in a final syllable; and to insure the distinct enunciation of a vowel which otherwise might be neglected.
As in: א צֽ ֵ יֽ ֵוַ וֹלעבַֽ שָׁ יִּוַ 2.3 Maqqef (Binder) (־) It is a horizontal stroke placed between two words to indicate that they are to be pronounced together and accented as if they formed but a single word.
As in: ינֵפְ ־לעַ רוֹא־יהִ יְ ברֶעֶ ־יהִ יוַֽ If the former of two words, joined by maqqef, should contain a long vowel in a closed syllable, such a vowel gives way to a short vowel or receives meteg.
As in: אהָ ־תאֶ רהָ נָּ הַ ־ם שֽׁ ֵ וְ שׁפֶ נֶ ־לכָּ 2.4 Mappiq (Extender) (הּ) ה Mappiq is a dot placed in final , when this letter is used as a consonant, and not as a vowel-letter.
As in: הּנָ ימִ ל ְ הּדָבְ עָ לְ (lemînāh) (le‘ābdāh) ה If the was used as a vowel-letter and not as a consonant, there will be no הרָוֹת mappiq and the transliteration will differ.
As i: (tôrāh) 2.5 Rafe (Rest) ( אֿ ) Rafe is a horizontal stroke placed over a letter, to call particular attention to the םיִמ ֽֿ לָ תגַ דְבֿ ח חָ קֿ לֻ absence of dagesh or mappiq.
As in: ; ; 2.6 Silluq ( אֽ ) Silluq is one of the major punctuation marks, which always appear under the last ץ רֶ אָֽ הָ word of a verse, as under at the end of Gen.1:1).
The silluq is generally the ׃ greatest stop in a verse and regularly followed by the sign ( ) called soph pasuq (end of verse).
Since silluq always stands on the last tone syllable of a verse, while the meteg never stands on a tone syllable; they are easily distinguished.
48 2.7 ‘Athnah (^) ‘Athna is an accent that marks the end of the first half of the verse.
It is placed below the accented syllable of the last word in the first half of the verse, as in םיהִ לֹאֱ In Gen.1:1; namely: ‘In the beginning he created God’ – first half of verse ends with ‘Athnah.
‘The heavens and the earth’ – second half of verse, ends with silluqs followed by the soph pasuq sign.
2.8 Pause A word is said to be in pause when its accent is a major stop, i.e.
a silluq or ‘Athnah; in either case the word being at the end of a clause.
A word in pause must have a long vowel in its accented or tone syllable.
If the vowel of the tone syllable is regularly short, it must be lengthened when placed in a pause.
As in: םיִמַ םי ִמ ָֽ םיִמָ (mayim – not paused) - (mayim – paused) 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit introduced important particles in Hebrew apart from vowel marks.
It has facilitated differentiating between vowel marks and other accent symbols in Hebrew, including the roles they play in a Hebrew text.
5.0 SUMMARY Basic particles in Hebrew discussed in this unit are: Accents, Meteg, Maqqef, Mappiq, Rafe, Silluq, Athnah, and Pause.
These particles, if not carefully identified may be confused with Hebrew vowel marks.
So the student should be acquainted with their forms and functions as discussed in this unit.
Next unit will examine the definite article in Hebrew.

The absence of the definite article is used to determine when an indefinite article is used.
To make a Hebrew word ה (of either gender) definite, you add a Hey ( ) before the noun.
Sometimes the vowel under the Hey changes, depending on whether the noun begins with a regular letter or a guttural letter.
51 2.0 OBJECTIVE At the end of this unit you will learn how to: • Prefix the definite article with guttural and non-guttural letters.
• Determine the indefinite article in Hebrew grammar.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Before All Non-Gutturals ◌ּ הַ ה The usual form of the article in Hebrew before all non-gutturals is (hey ( ) plus ◌ַ ◌ּ patach ( ), plus dagesh forte ( ) in the first consonant of the noun; as in: the day/ today םוֹיּהַ (hay-yôm) = םוֹי + ◌ּ הַ ךְלֶ מֶּ הַ ךְלֶ מֶ ◌ּ הַ the king (ham-melekh) = + ןבֵּ הַ ןבֵּ ◌ּ הַ the son (hab-ben) = + 3.2 Before Strong Gutturals ה ח Before the strong or harsh gutturals and which may be doubled by הַ implication, the form of the article is without a dagesh forte in the following letter.
As in: ךְלֵ ֹההַ (ha-hǒlēk) = ךְלֵ ֹה + הַ the darkness ךְשֶׁ ֹחהַ (ha-chōshēk) = ךְשֶׁ ֹח + הַ 3.3 Before Weak Gutturals א ע ר Before the weak guttural , and before , which cannot be doubled, the patach הַ הָ under Hey ( ) lengthens to a qamets ( ).
As in: the man שׁיאִ הָ (ha-’îsh) = שׁיאִ + הַ the bird ףוֹעהָ (hā-‘ôf) = ףוֹע + הַ 52 עַיקִ רָהָ עַיקִ רָ הַ (hā- rāqia‘) = + 3.4 Before עָ הָ חָ חָ הָ עָ הַ Before and before an unaccented , , the patach under Hey ( ) is הֶ deflected to a segôl ( ) for the sake of dissimilarity.
As in: קזָחָ הֶ קזָחָ הַ (he-chāzāq) = + םירִהָ הֶ םירִהָ הַ (he-hārîm) = + ןוֹעָ הֶ ןוֹעָ הַ (he-‘āvōn) = + 3.5 Before a noun with initial ( יְ) יְ Before a noun whose initial consonant is yod, followed by a sheva ( ) and sometimes before a noun whose initial consonant is mem, followed by a sheva מְ הַ ( ), the form of the article is without a dagesh forte in the following letter.
As in: the children םידִ לָ יְהַ (ha- yelādîm) = םידִ לָ יְ + הַ הלָּ סִ מְ הַ (ha-mesillâ) = הלָּ סִ מְ + הַ 3.6 Other rules A few nouns in their singular form undergo internal changes when the definite article is prefixed to them.
Common ones are the following: ץרֶאֶ ץרֶאָ הָ (’erets) = (hā-’ārets) the earth רהַ רהָ הָ (har) = (hā-hār) the mountain םעַ םעָ הָ (‘am) = (hā-‘ām) the people 53 ןגּ ַ ןגָּ הַ (gan) = (hag-gān) the garden רפַּ רפָּ הַ (par) = (hap-pār) the bull גחַ גחָ הֶ (chag) = (he-chāg) the festival ןוֹראֲ ןוֹראָ הָ (’arôn) = (hā-’arôn) the ark 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit has shown the different uses of definite article in Hebrew.
The student should pay particular attention to guttural letters, which exhibits most of the variant usages.
However the regular prefix of hey plus patach and forte remains the regular form of Hebrew definite article.

56 UNIT 9 PREPOSITIONS AND VAV CONJUNCTION CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Inseparable Prepositions 3.2 The Preposition min 3.3 Independent Prepositions 3.4 Vav Conjunction 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION A preposition is a word or group of words (e.g.
in, from, to, out of, on behalf of, etc) often placed before a noun or pronoun to indicate place, direction, source, method, etc.
The vav is a conjunctive word translated as ‘and’ in English.
The vav conjunction, inseparable prepositions and min function as a prefix to Hebrew words just like the definite article.
Sometimes the vowel under them changes, depending on the consonant that appears at the beginning of the word.
The Vav conjunction is pointed like the inseparable prepositions with few exceptions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Understand the basic grammar of the preposition and Vav conjunction in Biblical Hebrew 2.
Begin identifying various prepositional phrases and constructions in the Scriptures.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Inseparable Prepositions In Hebrew, few prepositions are inseparable and are prefixed to nouns, like the definite article.
Others are independent and function more like English prepositions.
The inseparable prepositions in Hebrew are: 57 בְּ בּ אְ in, by, with (i.e.
plus a sheva ) כְּ כּ אְ as, like, according to (i.e.
plus a sheva ) לְ ל אְ to, for, at (i.e.
plus a sheva ) Note: i.
The usual pointing of the inseparable prepositions before consonants that have full vowels is with a simple sheva.
As in: ךְלֶ מֶ בְּ ךְלֶ מֶ בְּ in a king bemelekh = + ךְלֶ מֶ כְּ ךְלֶ מֶ כְּ as a king kemelekh = + ךְלֶ מֶ ל ְ ךְלֶ מֶ לְ to a king lemelekh = + ii.
Before consonants having a simple sheva, the inseparable preposition is pointed with a chireq.
As in: תירִבְ בִּ תרִבְּ בְּ in a covenant biv-rîth = + תירִבְ כִּ תרִבְּ כְּ as a covenant kiv-rîth = + תירִבְ ל ִ תרִבְּ לְ to a covenant liv-rîth = + iii.
Before a consonantal yod with a simple sheva ( יְ), the inseparable preposition is pointed with a chireq.
Then the chireq combines with the yod to form a chireq- yod.
This causes the yod to lose its consonantal value, and the sheva under it drops out.
As in: הדָ וּהיבִּ הדָ וּהיְ בְּ in Judah bîhûdāh = + הדָ וּהיכּ ִ הדָ וּהיְ כְּ as Judah kîhûdāh = + הדָ וּהי לִ הדָ וּהיְ לְ to Judah lîhûdāh = + iv.
Before a guttural with a compound sheva ( אֳ , אֱ , אֲ ), the inseparable preposition is pointed with the corresponding short vowel.
As in: 58 in a lion ירִאֲ בַּ ba’arî = ירִאֲ + בְּ as a lion ירִאֲ כַּ ka’arî = ירִאֲ + כְּ to a lion ירִאֲ לַ la’arî = ירִאֲ + לְ v. Occasionally before an ’alef (א) that has a chatef-segol ( אֱ ), the preposition א receives a tsere, the chatef-segol drops, while the quiesces or becomes silent.
As in: םיהִ לֹאבֵּ םיהִ לֹאֱ בְּ in God bē’lôhîm = + םיהִ לֹא כֵּ םיהִ לֹאֱ כְּ as God kē’lôhîm = + םיהִ לֹא לֵ םיהִ לֹאֱ לְ to God lē’lôhîm = + vi.
Before a definite article, the ה of the article drops out, and the preposition ה receives the vowel pointing under As in: שׁיאִ בָּ שׁיאִ הָ בְּ in the man bā-’îsh = + שׁיאִ בָּ שׁיאִ הָ כְּ as the man kā-’îsh = + שׁיאִ בָּ שׁיאִ הָ לְ to the man lā-’îsh = + --------------------------------------------------------------------------- תיִבַּ בַּ תיִבַּ הַ בְּ in the house bab-bayit = + תיִבַּ כַּ תיִבַּ הַ כְּ as the house kab-bayit = + תיִבַּ ל ַ תיִבַּ הַ לְ to the house lab-bayit = + vii.
Sometimes immediately before the tone-syllable (accented syllable) the אָ inseparable preposition assumes the vowel qamets ( ).
As in: in waters םיִמָ בָּ bāmāyim = םיִמַ + בְּ 59 as waters םיִמָ כָּ kāmāyim = םיִמַ + כְּ to waters םיִמָ לָ lāmāyim = םיִמַ + לְ 3.2 The preposition ןמִ (min), from, out of ןמִ The preposition (min) can perform a dual role, namely: (a) when it is prefixed to a word that has not the definite article.
It becomes inseparable, but (b) it is somehow separable with a maqqef if it has a definite article.
Note: i.
When the preposition ןמִ is before ordinary letters (i.e.
excluding gutturals עחהא ר נ and ) the vowelless is assimilated and the following letter is doubled by daghes forte as compensation.
As in: from David דוִדָּמִ mid-dāvid = דוִדָּ + ןמִ from a day םוֹיּמִ miy-yôm = םוֹי + ןמִ from a king ךְלֶ מֶּ מִ mim-melekh = ךְלֶ מֶ + ןמִ ii.
Before gutturals or ר, the preceding chireq under מ lengthens to tsere.
As in: from a human-kind םדָאָ מֵ mē’ādām = םדָאָ + ןמִ from a man שׁיאִ מֵ mē’îsh = שׁיאִ + ןמִ from a mountain רהַ מֵ mēhar = רהַ + ןמִ iii.
Before a yod pointed with a simple sheva ( יְ) the preposition contracts to ימִ .
As in: from Judah הדָ וּהימִ mîhûdāh = הדָ וּהיְ + ןמִ 60 from Jerusalem םיִלַ שָׁ וּרימִ mîrûshālayim = םיִלַ שָׁ וּריְ + ןמִ iv.
Before the definite article, the preposition may remain separated by a maqqef.
As in: from the king ךלֶ מֶּ הַ ־ןמִ min-ham-melekh = ךְלֶ מֶּ הַ + ןמִ from the house תיִבַּ הַ ־ןמִ min-hab-bayit = תיִבַּ הַ + ןמִ Or the preposition becomes inseparable.
As in: ןמִ ךְלֶ מֶּ הַ ךְ לֶ מֶּ הַ מֽ ֵ before becomes , from the king ןמִ תיִבַּ הַ תיִבַּ הַ מֽ ֵ before becomes from the house 3.3 Unattached or Independent Prepositions Unattached or Independent prepositions more or less function like the English prepositions.
Some of them are: לאֶ To, into, toward ינֵפְ לִ before, in front of 1.
2.
םעִ With לעַ upon, above, about 3.
4.
ןיבֵּ between דחַ תּֽ ַ under, instead of 5.
6.
דעַ Until, unto ירֵחֲ אַ behind, after 7.
8.
לצֶ אֵ Beside, near 9.
3.4 The vav conjunction (((( וְ)))), and וְ The vav conjunction ( ), is translated ‘and’.
It is pointed like the inseparable prepositions with few exceptions.
Note: i. Ordinarily before a consonant with full vowel (except labials פ, מ, ב) it is וְ pointed with a sheva ( ).
As in: and a horse סוּסוְ vesûs = סוּס + וְ 61 and a human-kind םדָאָ וְ ve’ādām = םדָאָ + וְ ii.
Before a labial with a full vowel it takes the form וּ As in: and a between ןיבֵ וּ ûvēn = ןיבֵּ + וְ and a king ךְלֶ מֶ וּ ûmelekh = ךְלֶ מֶ + וְ and here הפֹ וּ ûfôh = הפֹּ + וְ iii.
Before יְ , the וְ contracts with יְ to form יוִ , As in: and Judah הדָ וּהיוִ vîhûdāh = הדָ וּהיְ + וְ let there be יהִ יוִ vîhî = יהִ יְ + וְ iiiivvvv.... Before a compound sheva, it takes the corresponding short vowel.
As in: and I אֲ וֽ ַ ינִ va’anî = ינִאֲ + וְ and truth תמֶ אֱ וֽ ֶ ve’emet = תמֶ אֱ + וְ and sickness ילִ חֳ וֽ ָ vocholî = ילִ חֳ + וְ v. Before the tone-syllable (or accented syllable), the vav conjunction is often וָ ,As in: and a night הלָ יְ ל֣ ַ וָ vālayelāh = הלָ יְ ל֣ ַ + וְ and evil ערָוָ vārā‘ = ערָ + וְ 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed the dynamics of Hebrew prepositions and conjunctions.

66 UNIT 10 NOUNS: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Noun Properties 3.2 Derivation 3.3 Gender 3.4 Number 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION A Hebrew noun is a name given to a person, place, or thing.
This unit will introduce you to the Hebrew noun: its morphology and basic usage.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Know the general characteristics of Hebrew nouns.
• Understand how Hebrew nouns are derived, which can constitute a good aid in using Hebrew lexicon in learning common noun forms found in the Hebrew Bible.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Noun Properties Nouns have the following properties: gender, number, person, and case.
1.
Gender Hebrew respects two gender formations: Masculine and feminine (male and female he created cf.
Genesis 1:27).
Unlike Greek, there is no ‘neuter’ gender in Hebrew.
2.
Number There are three numbers in Hebrew: singular, dual and plural.
For plural nouns, there are regular plurals, irregular plurals, dual plurals, and plurals functioning as singular nouns.
67 3.
Person Hebrew nouns could be first person (referring to me), second person (you), and third person (he; e.g.
John came).
Normally these distinctions apply to the study of pronouns, but they are implicit in the grammar of the noun as well.
4.
Case Case indicates the grammatical function of the noun in a sentence.
The noun can be a subject of a sentence, an object in a sentence, or in a possessive relationship with an object (a “construct state”).
Examples: Obi kicked the ball – (Obi is the subject, while the ball is the object) It is Tolu’s ball – (Tolu’s ball or ball of Tolu is the construct state) In general Hebrew uses endings to indicate these various properties of nouns.
By learning the root of the noun and its endings, you will begin to understand the way nouns function in Hebrew sentences.
3.2 Derivation The vast majority of Hebrew nouns are derived from verbs; a few Hebrew nouns are derived from other nouns, while those for which no known derivation exists are called primitive nouns.
1.1 Nouns derived from verbs include: רבָ דָּ רבֵּ דִּ word from he spoke ערַזֶ ערַזָ seed from he sowed ךְלֶ מֶ ךְלַ מָ king from he reignd דבֶ עֶ דבַ עָ servant from he served 2.2 Nouns derived from other nouns include: רקֵ וֹבּ רקָ בָּ a herdsman from a herd םרֶֹכּ םרֶכֶּ a vinedresser from a vineyard ילִ אֵ רְשְׂ יִ לאֵ רָשְׂ יִ Israelite from Israel 3.3 Primitive nouns include: באָ םאֵ דיָ Father mother hand ןבֵּ םוֹי הלָ יְ ל֣ ַ son day night 68 3.3 Gender In Hebrew there are two genders: masculine and feminine.
There is no special termination for the masculine, but the feminine singular noun is recognized by ה◌ָ the accented termination.
Here are few examples of masculine and feminine nouns: Masculine Feminine סוּס הסָ וּס a horse a mare שׁיאִ השָּׁ אִ a man a woman איבִ נָ האָ יבִ נְ a prophet a prophetess Classes of feminine nouns i.
Words ending in the ה◌ָ or ת as in הסָ וּס, mare; תוֹחא, sister; תבַּ , daughter.
ii.
Words of any termination that are names of feminine creatures, as םאֵ , mother iii.
Names of cities, countries which may be considered mothers of their םיִלַ שָׁ וּריְ הדָ וּהיְ לאֵ רָשְׂ יִ inhabitants.
As: , Jerusalem; , Judah; , Israel; etc.
iv.
Names of organs of the body of men or animals, especially such organs as are דיָ לגֶרֶ double, as , hand; , foot; also of other utensils or instruments used by ברֶחֶ man as: , sword.
v. Names of things productive, the elements and unseen things as: שׁמֶ שֶׁ , sun; שׁפֶ ֣נֶ שׁאֵ ץרֶאֶ , soul; , fire; , earth In all these classes however, there are numerous exceptions; and many words are of both genders, though in general where this is the case one gender is largely predominant in usage over the other.
vi.
Feminine words usually assume the distinctive feminine termination in the plural.
Many feminine nouns however have the masculine plural ending; and on the contrary many masculine words have the feminine termination in the plural, especially if they incline a feminine sense as in iv) or v) above.
69 3.4 Number There are three numbers in Hebrew: singular, dual and plural.
The dual is now very much in disuse, being employed mostly to express things that occur naturally or by use in pairs, as hands, feet, and shoes.
(i) The feminine singular is formed by adding ה◌ָ to the masculine.
The plural םי◌ִ masculine is formed by adding to the singular; and the plural feminine by ה◌ָ תוֹ תוֹ changing into , or by adding to the singular if it has no feminine termination.
(ii) The dual is formed by adding םיִ◌ַ to the masculine singular for the masculine, and to the original feminine singular for the feminine.
Example: Singular Masculine Feminine בוֹט הבָ וֹט good good סוּס הסָ וּס horse mare Plural םיבִ וֹט תוֹבִ וֹט good good םיסִ וּס תוֹסוּס horses, mares Dual םיִסַ וּס םיִתַ סָ וּס pair of horses pair of mares (iii) A few masculine nouns have plurals that end in תוֹ, which is the ending normally used for feminine plurals.
Example: Singular Plural באָ תוֹבאָ father fathers םשֵׁ תוֹמשֵׁ name names םוֹקמָ תוֹמוֹקמָ place places לוֹק תוֹלוֹק voice voices 70 (iv) A few feminine nouns have plurals that end in םי◌ִ , which is the ending normally used for the masculine plurals.
Example: Singular Plural השָּׁ אִ םישִׁ נָ woman women ריעִ םירִעָ city cities (v) Nouns with both masculine and feminine plural endings include: Singular Plural רוֹדּ םירִוֹדּ תוֹרוֹדּ generation or generations הנָ שָׁ םינִשָׁ תוֹנשְׁ year or years 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed Noun properties, namly: Gender, Number, Person and Case; including how Hebrew are derived, namely: Nouns derived from verbs, Noun derived from other Nouns, and Primitive Nouns, which are Nouns that have no known derivation.

73 UNIT 11 ADJECTIVE CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Adjective Properties 3.2 Adjective Usage 3.3 Patterns of Inflection 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION An adjective is a word that names a quality, or that defines or limits a noun.
The adjective follows the noun it qualifies and agrees with it in number and gender.
Hebrew adjectives function similarly to English adjectives with some variations.
In English, adjectives appear before the noun they modify, but in Hebrew adjectives often appear after the noun they modify.
Example: Translation Adjective Noun A good son בוֹט ןבֵּ A wise father םכ ַ חָ באַ 2.0 OBJECTIVE At the end of this unit you should be able to: • Identify adjectival phrases and contructions in biblical Hebrew.
• Apply the different usages of Hebrew adjectives.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Adjective Properties Like the nouns they modify, adjectives have the following properties: 74 • Gender Hebrew adjectives have masculine and feminine gender, just like the noun they modify.
While masculine nouns go with masculine adjectives, feminine nouns go with feminine adjectives.
• Number Hebrew adjectives agree with their noun numbers.
Singular nouns require singular adjectives; plural nouns require plural adjectives, and dual nouns with dual adjectives.
• Definiteness Nouns can either be definite (either by taking the definite article or by being a proper noun) or indefinite.
Attributive adjectives must agree with their nouns in definiteness, and therefore may appear with the article.
3.2 Adjective Usage There are four basic ways adjectives are used: 1) Attribute Usage (a) Attributively, adjective follows the noun it qualifies and agrees with it in number, gender and definiteness.
Examples: בוֹט שׁיאִ , a good man (expressed in Hebrew as ‘a man, a good one’) הבָ וֹט השָּׁ אִ , a good woman (expressed in Hebrew as “a woman, a good one”) (b) When the noun is definite the adjective which qualifies it has the article.
Examples: בוֹטּהַ שׁיאִ הָ , the good man (expressed in Hebrew as ‘the man, the good (one)’) הבָ וֹטהַ השָּׁ אִ הָ , the good woman (expressed in Hebrew as ‘the woman, the good (one)’) (c) Agreement of noun and adjective must be carefully watched in those cases where masculine nouns have feminine endings in the plural, and feminine nouns have masculine endings in the plural.
Example: םיבִ וֹט תוֹבאָ , good fathers; תוֹבוֹט תוֹבאָ and not תוֹלוֹדגְ םישִׁ נָ , great women; םילִ וֹדגְ םישִׁ נָ and not 75 2) Predicate Usage Predicatively, the adjective precedes the noun.
In Hebrew, predicate adjectives appear before the noun and agree in gender and number (but not definiteness).
Note that predicate adjectives never take the definite article.Example: שׁיאִ הָ בוֹט , the man is good (expressed in Hebrew as ‘good (is) the man’) השָּׁ אִ הָ הבָ וֹט , the woman is good (expressed in Hebrew as ‘good (is) the woman) 3) Substantive Usage An adjective can stand alone and function as a noun.
When it does so, it may function as the subject or object of a verb and it always appears with the definite article.
When you encounter a definite adjective that does not seem to modify a noun within a sentence, it may be a substantive adjective.
Translate the adjective with an implied “one” (for singular forms) or “ones” for plural forms.
Examples: Feminine Masculine הבָ וֹטּהַ בוֹטּהַ The good (one) The good (one) Singular תוֹבוֹטּהַ םיבִ וֹטּהַ The good (ones) The good (ones) Plural 4) Comparative/Superlative Usage (a) In English, when we say, “The boys are stronger than the girls”, it is a comparative statement because of the word “stronger”.
To make a comparative statements, Hebrew adjectives combines with the preposition “from” (min) to complete the construction by adding it to the word that acts as the object of the comparison.
Examples: להֶ אֹ הָ ןמִ לוֹדגָּ תיִבַּ הַ The house big from the tent (meaning: The house is bigger than the tent) (b) When we say “Obi is the strongest boy in the class”, the word “strongest” depicts a superlative understanding.
The Superlative Usage of the Adjective in Hebrew can be formed by placing the adverb meod (“very”) after an adjective.
Examples: דאֹ מְ בוֹט Very good (or the best) 76 3.3 Patterns of Inflection of Adjectives (a) Adjectives must agree with the Noun they modify in gender and number.
So the inflections of adjectives follow basically with that of Noun.
That is, the endings of Adjectives (suffixes) are similar to that of Noun.
Examples: Feminine Masculine האָ … Singular תוֹא םיאִ Plural Feminine Masculine ה בָ וֹט בוֹט Singular תוֹבוֹט םיב ִ וֹט Plural (b) Adjectives must agree with the nouns they modify in gender and number.
For example, consider the following adjective phrases.
Examples: A good daughter הבָ וֹט תבַּ A good son בוֹט ןבֵּ Good daughters תוֹבוֹט תוֹנבָּ Good sons םיבִ וֹט םינִבָּ 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit confirms that Hebrew adjectives function similarly to English adjectives with some variations.
Adjectival properties and usages and patterns of inflection of adjectives were also studied.
5.0 SUMMARY (a) General properties of adjectives include: i.
Gender (masculine or feminine) ii.
Number (singular, plural or dual) iii.
Definiteness 77 (b) Adjectival usage include: i. Attributive usage.
Adjectives that directly modify a noun are called “attributive” because they attribute a certain characteristic to a noun.
Attributive adjectives have the following properties: (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) They follow the noun they modify (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) They agree with the noun they modify in: 1.
Gender (masc / fem) 2.
Number (sing / pl) 3.
Definiteness (if the noun is definite, the adjective must be, too) ii.
Predicative usage.
In Hebrew, predicate adjectives can appear before or after the noun and agree in gender and number -- but not definiteness.
Predicate adjectives use the word “is” with the adjective to form the predicate of a complete clause (subject+verb).
Predicate adjectives have the following properties: (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) They appear before or after the noun they modify (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) They agree with the noun they modify in: 1.
Gender (masc / fem) 2.
Number (sing / pl) 3. but not in definiteness iii.
Substantive usage.
An adjective can stand alone and function as a noun.
When it does so, it may function as the subject or object of a verb, and it always appears with the definite article.
When you encounter a definite adjective that does not seem to modify a noun within a sentence, it may be a substantive adjective.
Translate the adjective with an implied “one” (for singular forms) or “ones” for plural forms.
iv.
Comparative/superlative usage.
Adjectives may be used to make comparative statements.
In Hebrew, comparisons are formed by adding the preposition (min) to the word that functions as the object of the comparison.
Superlatives are formed by adding the adverb (meod) to the adjective.
78 (c) Pattern of Inflection.
Since adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in gender and number, every adjective can take four possible forms: two for masculine nouns (singular and plural), and two for feminine nouns (singular and plural).
These forms are changed by means of adding endings to the stem of the word, much in the same manner as endings are attached to nouns.

81 UNIT 12 THE PRONOUN CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Properties of Pronoun 3.2 Types of Pronouns 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION A pronoun is a word that stands in place of (“pro”) a noun.
The word for which a pronoun stands (or refers back to) is called the antecedent of the pronoun.
This unit studies the properties and types of Hebrew pronoun.
2.0 OBJECTIVE This unit will equip the student to understand the different dynamics of pronouns in biblical Hebrew, ranging from pronoun properties, types of pronouns to pronominal endings.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Properties of Pronoun Pronouns function more or less like Nouns.
So they possess the same properties, namely: 1.
Gender Gender refers to whether the pronoun is masculine or feminine.
The gender of the pronoun is determined by the gender of the noun, which is its antecedent.
2.
Number Singular or Plural pronouns agree with the singular or plural of the antecedent nouns.
Examples: Paul went to University where he got his first degree.
The soldiers fought gallantly, and they received the crown.
(“Paul” is the antecedent noun of the pronoun “he” – singular; while the pronoun “they” corresponds with the antecedent noun “soldiers” – plural).
82 3.
Person A pronoun can be in the first person (I, We), second person (you – singular, you – plural), or third person (he/she/they).
4.
Case A pronoun can be a subject of a sentence (he is a king), an object in a phrase or clause (John loves her), or in a possessive relationship with an object (his Hebrew book).
3.2 Types of Pronouns Types of Hebrew pronouns include: Personal pronouns, Demonstrative pronouns, Interrogative pronouns, and Relative pronouns.
(a) Personal Pronouns The following are the forms of the independent personal pronoun יכִ נֹ אָ , ינִאֲ וּנאֲ , וּנחְ נ֣ ַ, וּנחְ נ֣ ַאֲ 1 cs I 1 cp We התָּ אַ םתֶּ אַ 2 ms You 2 mp You תְּ אַ הנָ ת֣ ֵ אַ , ןתֶּ אַ 2 fs You 2 fp You אוּה המָּ ה֣ ֵ , םהֵ 3 ms He/it 3 mp They איהִ הנָּ ה֣ ֵ , ןהֵ 3 fs She/it 3 fp They Notes: (i) The above forms of the personal pronouns are used only to express the nominative or a subject: they must not be put as oblique cases after a verb or preposition.
(ii) When not expressing the subject, the personal pronouns become attracted in a fragmentary form to the end of other words.
The fragments are named pronominal suffixes (to be studied later) (iii) Sentences that employ independent personal pronouns as subjects will often be verbless sentences (with the verb “to be” understood).
Examples: הוָהיְ ינִאֲ I (am) the LORD שׁיאִ הָ התָּ אַ You are the man רפָ עָ ־יכִּ For you are dust םיהִ לֹאֱ הָ אוּה הוָהיְ The LORD, he is God 83 (b) Demonstrative Pronoun The forms of the demonstrative pronouns are as follows: Singular Plural הזֶ הלֶּ א֣ ֵ Masc.
this Masc.
these תאֹ ז הלֶּ א֣ ֵ Fem.
this Fem.
these אוּה םהֵ המָּ ה֣ ֵ Masc.
that Masc.
( ) those איהִ ןהֵ הנָּ ה֣ ֵ Fem.
that Fem.
( ) those Note: (i) Like adjectives, demonstrative pronoun may be used attributively.
They agree in gender, number and article with the nouns to which they refer.
Examples: הזֶּהַ םוֹקמָּ הַ This place תאֹ זּהַ ץרֶא֣ ָ הָ This land אוּההַ םוֹיּבַּ On that day איהִ הַ ריעִ בָּ In that city הלֶּ א֣ ֵ הָ םירִבָ דְּהַּ These words הלֶּ א֣ ֵ הַ םירִעָ הֶ These cities םהֵ הָ םימִ יָּבַּ In those days (ii)Demonstrative pronouns may also be predicatively.
They agree in gender, number with the nouns to which they are linked, but they never take the article.
Examples: םוֹיּהַ הזֶ This (is) the day ץרֶא֣ ָ הָ תאֹ ז This (is) the land רבָ דָּהַ אוּה That (is) the word הלָ ֹדגּהַ ריעִ הָ אוהִ That (is) the great city םירִבָ דְּהַ הלֶּ א֣ ֵ These (are) the words 84 (c) Interrogative Pronouns The following are the Hebrew Interrogative pronouns: ימִ המָ Who?
What?
עַוּדּמַ המָּ לָ Why?
Why?
יתַ מָ הפֹ יאֵ When?
Where?
הכָ יאֵ / ךְיאֵ ןיִאַ מֵ How?
From Where?
הנָ אָ / ןאָ ־הֲ Where?
Interrogative particle יאֵ היֵאַ Where?
Where?
(c) Relative Pronouns A relative pronoun (who, that, which) connects a modifying clause to an antecedent.
This clause is called a relative clause since it “relates” the clause to the antecedent and modifies it adjectivally.
For example: 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit shows that Hebrew pronouns function more like Nouns, so they possess same properties like gender, number, person and case.
The student should get aquainted with how they function for effective learning of the grammar.
5.0 SUMMARY 1) General Properties of Pronouns include: a) Gender: Gender is a property that indicates the sex of the antecedent (masculine or feminine).
b) Number: Number is the property that indicates whether the antecedent represents one (singular) or more than one (plural) object.
c) Person: Person refers to the relationship between the antecedent and the speaker.
A pronoun can be in the first person, second person, or third person.
85 d) Case: Case indicates the grammatical function of the pronoun in a sentence.
A pronoun can be a subject of a sentence (He is a king), an object in a phrase or clause (John loves her), or in a possessive relationship with an object (his Hebrew book).
2) Types of Pronouns include: Personal, Demonstrative, Interrogative, and Relative pronouns.

87 UNIT 13 VERBS: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Roots 3.2 Classes of Verbs 3.3 Tenses 3.4 Verb Stems 3.5 Triliteral verb-stems 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION A verb is a word or phrase that indicates what somebody or something does; what state somebody or something is in; what is becoming of somebody or something.
The action word in a sentence is the verb.
The general characteristics of the Hebrew verb include: roots, classes of verbs, tenses and verb stems.
2.0 OBJECTIVE At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Have a complete overview of Hebrew verbal system before an elaborate study is made on each of them.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Roots All words (verbs and nouns) are derived from the roots.
While there are a very few roots of four letters, most Hebrew roots consist of three or two letters, called radicals.
Examples, ארָבָּ ארב from לידִּבְ מַ לדב .
from ךְלֵ הַ תְ מִ ךְלה from יתִ מֹ יקִ הֲ םק from 88 The root is generally pronounced with the vowels of the third person singular masculine of the perfect tense, this being the simplest of all verbal forms.
The root ארב is not in itself a word; it exists solely in the mind of the linguists.
Example: ארָבָּ is a root, but the word is - he created.
Many of the roots now appearing to triliteral, were once biliteral; their triliteral forms are a later development.
Biliteral roots of the middle –vowel classes are תוּמ commonly pronounced with the vowel of the infinitive construct.
Example: תמֵ םישִׁ to die, he died, to put.
For many words, the roots are difficult to locate.
3.2 Classes of verbs (i) Triliteral.
The Hebrew verb is normally triliteral (i.e.
when the root has three letters or consonants).
This class is subdivided into three classes: a.
Strong verbs (or regular verbs).
These refer to those containing a consonant which will in any way affect the vowels usually employed in a given inflection.
Example: תבַ שָׁ קבַ דּ ָ לשַׁ מָ b. Laryngeal (or guttural) verbs.
These are the verbs whose roots contain one or more gutturals, which involve certain variations in vocalization from the strong verb.
Example: בזַעָ גרַהָ ףחַ רָ c. Weak verbs.
These refer to those containing one or more consonants נ ו י which may suffer assimilations ( ), contraction and elision ( and ), or א quiescence ( ).
Such changes in the consonants affect the vowels seriously.
Example: ןתַ נָ רצַ יָ ארָבָּ 1) Biliteral.
This refers to verbs composed of two consonants in their roots.
It is subdivided into two classes: (a) ayin-doubled verbs, and (b) middle-vowel verbs.
89 a. Ayin-doubled verbs (ע״ע).
These are verbs in which the second root consonant has been duplicated.
They are also known as ‘Geminate verbs’.
Example: בבס; ללח; ןנַ הָ b.
The middle-vowel verbs.
Here the vowel element is emphasized.
Example: תוּמ; ןיבִּ ; םוּק; םישִׂ יָ 3.3 Tenses The Hebrew verbs have no tenses strictly speaking.
It has two forms, which express not time but action.
The one expresses a finished action, and is called PERFECT, the other an unfinished action, and is called the IMPERFECT.
We shall reflect these as we progress in our study of Hebrew verbs.
3.4 The verb stems The verb stems are the major conjugation patterns of Hebrew verbs.
Hebrew uses mainly seven verb-stems, each representing a different aspect or development of the primary meaning of the verb.
The simple verb-stem is generally identical with the root.
The seven verb-stems are: Qal, Nif‘al, Pi‘el (or pôlēl), Pu‘al, Hif‘il, Hǒf‘al, and Hithpa‘el.
(i) Qal (לקַ ).
It presents the verb in its simplest form, not encumbered with the additions (affixes or prefixes) characteristics of the other stems.
Example: He killed.
(ii) Nif‘al (לעַ פְ נִ ).
This is the passive of the Qal stem.
In all stems other than the qal, the stem name is formed from the paradigm-verb used by the Arabic and לעַ פָּ the Jewish grammarians, namely, (pa‘al) – did, performed.
Thus the לעַ פְ נִ name of the stem is .
Example: He was killed.
(iii) Pi‘el (or Pôlēl) לעֵ פִּ .
The intensive active stem is called Pi‘el.
The formal characteristic of this stem is the doubling or repetition of the second radical of לטֵּ קִ the root.
Example: (qit-tēl).
Example: He desrtroyed.
(iv) Pu‘al (לעַ פֻ ).
The intensive passive stem is called Pu‘al.
the formal characteristic of this root is the doubling or repetition of the second radical, לטַּ קֻ with ǔ or o under the first radical.
Example: (qǔt-tal).
Example: He was destroyed.
90 (v) Hif‘il (לעִ פְ הִ ).
It is the causative stem of qal.
The formal characteristic of this הִ stem is the prefix which undergoes modification in inflection.
Example: ליטִ קְ הִ (hiq-tîl).
Example: He caused death.
(vi) Hǒf‘al (לעַ פְ הָ ).
The passive causative stem is called Hof‘al.
the formal הָ characteristic is the prefix , which undergoes change in inflection.
Example: (hǒq-tal).
Example: He was caused to kill.
(vii) Hithpa‘al (לעֵ פַ תְ הִ ).
The intensive reflexive stem is called hithpa‘el.
תְ הִ The formal characteristic of this stem is the prefix Joined to the pi‘el stem.
Example: He killed himself.
3.5 General view of the triliteral verb-stems S/N Name Original Form in the Force Characteristics form perfect לטַ קַ לטַ קָ Simple root None 1 Qal meaning לטַ קְ נַ לטַ קְ נִ Reflexive, נ 2 Nif‘al reciprocal, passive Dagesh forte in לטַּ קַ לטֵּ קִ Intensive 3 Pi‘ēl second radical active לטַּ קֻ לטַּ קֻ Intensive ◌ֻ 4 Pu‘al Qibbus ( ) passive and Dagesh forte לטַ קְ הַ ליטִ קְ הִ Causative הִ 5 Hif‘il active לטַ קְ הֻ לטַ קְ הָ Causative הָ 6 Hǒf‘al passive 7 Hith- לטַּ קַ תְ הִ לטֵּ קַ תְ הִ Reflexive, תהִ and dagesh reciprocal pa‘el forte 91 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit studies the general characteristics of verbs in Hebrew, namely: roots, classes of verbs, tenses, verb stems and inflection.

94 UNIT 14 THE QAL PERFECT INFLECTION (REGULAR VERBS) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Qal Perfect Inflection 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Inflection is a change in the form of a word (typically the ending) to express a grammatical function or attribute such as tense, mood and person.
In Hebrew verbs, there are two main inflections: Perfect and Imperfect.
Perfect inflection is used to reflect a completed action, which is somehow similar to simple past tense in English grammar.
While imperfect inflection reflects an incomplete action, otherwise future or continuing tense in English.
This unit will focus on qal perfect inflection.
2.0 OBJECTIVE By the end of this unit, you should be able to: •••• Understand the basic grammar of the qal verbal stem in expressing a simple past or completed action.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Qal Perfect Inflection (Regular verbs) Example 1 Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 m.s בתַ כָּ He wrote וּבתְ כָּ 3 c.p They wrote 3 f.s הבָ תְ כָּ She wrote 2 m.s תָּ בְ תַ כָּ You wrote 2 m.p םתֶּ בְ תַ כְּ You wrote 2 f.s תְּ בְ תַ כָּ You wrote 2 f.p ןתֶּ בְ תַ כְּ You wrote 1 c.s יתִּ בְ תַ כָּ I wrote 1 c.p וּנבְ תַ כָּ We wrote 95 Example 2 Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 m.s רמַ שָׁ He kept וּרמְ שָׁ 3 c.p They kept She kept 3 f.s הרָמְ שָׁ You kept 2 m.s תָּ רְמַ שָׁ 2 m.p םתֶּ רְמַ שְׁ You kept You kept 2 f.s תְּ רְמַ שָׁ 2 f.p ןתֶּ רְמַ שְׁ You kept We kept 1 c.s יתִּ רמַ שָׁ I kept 1 c.p וּנרְמַ שָׁ Note: i.
The suffixes for the Qal perfect are as follows: 3 m.s He וּ 3 c.p They 3 f.s ה◌ָ She 2 m.s תָּ You 2 m.p םתֶּ You 2 f.s תְּ You 2 f.p ןתֶּ You 1 c.s יתִּ I 1 c.p וּנ We The abbreviations ‘c’ indicates a common gender, one that covers both masculine and feminine subjects; ‘ms’ = masculine singular; ‘fs’ = feminine singular; ‘mp’ = masculine plural; ‘fp’ = feminine singular.
The number ‘3’, ‘2’, ‘1’ indicate whether it is third, second or first persons.
ii.
The standard table of Hebrew verbs usually begins with the 3ms (as בתַ כָּ , רמַ שָׁ ), since this is the simplest form of the verb and conveniently serves as the basis for others.
iii.
The persons of the perfect are formed by taking the stem of the verb (3ms) בתַ כָּ רמַ שָׁ בתכ רמשׁ , or ( , ), and appending the suffixes to denote the person, gender and number.
iv.
Note the changes of pointing as the inflection progresses from 3ms to other forms.
96 v. There is agreement in person, gender, and number between Hebrew verbs and their subjects.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed the qal perfect inflection of the strong or regular verbs.
The suffixes for qal perfect represent the letters attached at the end of verb-stems that expresses different grammatical function in terms of gender and number.
The student should study carefully the suffixes, which maintains the same order in all regular verbs.

Available Hebrew lexicons include: Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew Lexicon (BDB); Strong’s Concordance; Cline’s Concise Dictionary of Classical Hebrew; etc.
The student should learn to make an analysis of every Hebrew verb forms; in this way, the use of Hebrew lexicon in translation will be fun.
This unit will discuss tips on how to use the Hebrew lexicon for translation purposes.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: •••• Learn how to isolate and identify all prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew verbal forms •••• Reconstruct the root of a word.
99 •••• Learn how to find the root form in a reliable lexicon in order to determine its meaning.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Use of the Lexicon in the Location and Translation of Verbs The following guidelines will help in the use of Hebrew lexicons for translation: 1) Identify and isolate all prefixes and suffixes (if any) on the verb form under consideration.
For example, the word: הרָמְ שָׁ וְ וְ ה◌ָ (and she kept), has the prefix and the suffix If we remove the prefix and the suffix, we now have three consonants רמשׁ from which we can make a tentative reconstruction of the verb root.
Qal, Pi‘el and Pu‘aldo not carry prefixes in the perfect.
The vav conjunction, though a prefix has no consequence on the verbal form.
2) In the absence of a prefix on the perfect (excluding the vav conjuction), the verbal form could likely be Qal, Pi‘el, or Pu‘al.
Once it has been determined that the form is not prefixed, the verb is considered a Qal if there is no dagesh forte in the middle consonant.
But if it does, the verb could either be Pi‘el or Pu‘al.
Example, the verb root: רמּשׁ which has a dagesh forte in the middle letter is either a Pi‘el or Pu‘al; רמשׁ But the verb root which has no dagesh forte is a Qal.
3) Pay close attention to the prefix of different verbal stems which must be clearly isolated in determining the root of the perfect form, namely: 1.
נִ is the prefix for the Nif’al perfect 2.
תְ הִ is the prefix for the Hitpa’el perfect 3.
הִ is the prefix for the Hif’il perfect 4.
הָ is the prefix for the Hof’al perfect 100  4) Having identified and isolated all prefixes and suffixes, you should focus on the suffixes to determine the person, gender, and number of the form.
Recall the table of Qal suffixes here: 3 m.s He וּ 3 c.p They ה◌ָ 3 f.s She תָּ םתֶּ 2 m.s You 2 m.p You תְּ ןתֶּ 2 f.s You 2 f.p You יתִּ וּנ 1 c.s I 1 c.p We 5) Then reconstruct the verb root from the remaining consonants.
In the רמשׁ.
example used in 1) above, the remaining consonants are: 6) Finally, use the Hebrew lexicon (e.g.
BDB) to locate the verb root (e.g.
רמשׁ ) to determine its meaning.
It is advisable to use the verbal root in the 3rd person masculine singular Qal perfect form: רמַ שָׁ .
7) Translating the sentence: רבָ דָּ הַ הרָמְ שָׁ וְ will be as follows: We must note that the verb is the first word in the sentence.
וְ ה◌ָ Isolating the prefixed vav conjunction ( ), and the suffix ( ), רמשׁ.
we are left with three consonants Using the BDB to locate the 3rd person masculine singular Qal perfect form, which is רמַ שָׁ , which means he kept; the suffix ה◌ָ is 3rd person וְ feminie singular, while is a conjunction.
So the full meaning of רבָ דָּ הַ הרָמְ שָׁ וְ the sentence is “and she kept the word”.
4.0 CONCLUSION The units discussed the importance of Hebrew lexicon in the work of identifying, isolating and determining the meaning of a word in Hebrew.
A good understanding of the Hebrew verbal forms will facilitate an effective usge of the lexicon in the work of translation of Hebrew texts.
101  5.0 SUMMARY This unit has shown that the first step in translating a word using Hebrew lexicon is to identify and isolate all prefixes and suffixes.
The remaining consonants, which is usually two or three in number is regarded as the root word.
It is this form that is looked up in the lexicon, paying attention to the gender, number and person of the suffixes.
6.0 SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE • Discuss the steps to the location and translation of verbs with the Hebrew lexicon.

102  UNIT 16 THE QAL IMPERFECT INFLECTION (REGULAR VERBS) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Qal Imperfect Inflection 3.2 Important features to note 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION We have noted earlier that Perfect inflection is used to reflect a completed action, which is somehow similar to simple past tense in English grammar; while Imperfect inflection reflects an incomplete action, otherwise future or continuing tense in English.
This unit will focus on Qal Imperfect inflection.
One of the distinguishing marks of the Imperfect Inflection is the use of prefixes, which is not common with Perfects, which uses more of suffixes.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Identify and isolate prefixes and suffixes from Hebrew imperfect verbs • Distinguish between perfect and imperfect verbs.
• Understand the function of imperfect verb inflections in Hebrew.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Qal Imperfect Inflection Our basis for the formation of Qal Imperfect Inflection is the use of Qal Perfect בתַ כָּ inflection form in the third person singular masculine verbal form.
Example: (He wrote).
This implies that Qal imperfect will be formed using the similar word in בתַ כָּ the perfect.
The table below shows the prefixes and suffixes in the Qal imperfect of the regular or strong verb 103  בתַ כָּ Example 1: (he wrote) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English בתֹּ כְ יִ וּבתְּ כְ יִ 3 ms He shall write 3 mp They shall write בתֹּ כְ תִּ הנָ בְ תֹּ כְ תִּ 3 fs She shall write 3 fp They (f) shall write בתֹּ כְ תִּ וּבתְּ כְ תִּ 2 ms You shall write 2 mp You shall write יבִ תְּ כְ תִ הנָ בְ תֹּ כְ תִּ 2 fs You (f) shall write 2 fp You (f) shall write בתֹּ כְ אֶ בתֹּ כְ נִ 1 cs I shall write 1 cp We shall write ךלַ מָ Example 2: (he reigned) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms ךלֹמְ יִ He shall reign 3 mp וּכלְ מְ יִ They (m) shall reign 3 fs ךלֹמְ תִּ She shall reign 3 fp הנָ כְ לֹמְ תִּ They (f) shall reign 2 ms ךלֹמְ תִּ You (m) shall reign 2 mp וּכלְ מְ תִּ You (m) shall reign 2 fs יכִ לְ מְ תִּ You (f) shall reign 2 fp הנָ כְ לֹמְ תִּ You (f) shall reign 1 cs ךלֹמְ אֶ I shal reign 1 cp ךלֹמְ נִ We shall reign 3.2 Important features to note 1) The singular prefixes for Qal imperfect are yod, three tavs, and ‘alef 2) The plural prefixes are yod, three tavs, and nun.
3) The vowel hireq appears in all the prefixes except in the ‘alef of (1 cs), because ‘alef is a guttural that requires a segol rather than a hireq.
104  4) There is only one suffix in the singular, which is hireq-yod (י◌ִ ) found in the second person feminine singular.
5) The plural inflections have suffixes in the first four forms namely: וּ, הנָ וּ הנָ , , .
The first person common plural form (1 cp) has no suffix.
6) The forms for the third person feminine singular and the second person masculine singular are identical.
The same is true for the third person feminine plural and the second person feminine plural.
The context will almost always determine how to distinguish between these identical forms.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit has shown that Qal Imperfect inflection is mainly used to express a simple future action or an action which has not been completed or has been repeated.
This early understanding of the Qal imperfect is preparatory to understanding other meanings of the imperfect verbs in Hebrew, which the student will be acquainted with in due course.
5.0 SUMMARY The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Qal Imperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: Singular Plural 3ms _ _ _ יִ 3 mp וּ _ _ _ יִ 3 fs _ _ _ תִּ 3fp הנָ _ _ _ תִּ 2 ms _ _ _ תִּ 2 mp וּ _ _ _ תִּ 2 fs י◌ִ _ _ תִּ 2 fp הנָ _ _ _ תִּ 1 cs _ _ _ אֶ 1 cp _ _ _ נִ 6.0 SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISES • Without looking at the examples in the study manual, write the full Qal בתַ כָּ ךְלַ מָ Imperfect inflection of (he wrote), and (he reigned), translating each of the forms.

106  UNIT 17 PERFECT OF THE REMAINING VERB STEMS (I) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Nif‘al Perfect Inflection 3.2 Pi‘el Perfect Inflection 3.3 Pu‘alPerfect Inflection 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION The different verbal stems in Hebrew represent the different tenses, moods and expressions found in the language or the functions performed by Hebrew verbs, which do not exactly follow the pattern of English verbal inflections.
Recall the study on the study of general characteristics of Hebrew verbs.
The verbal stems are Qal, Nif‘al, Pi‘el, Pu‘al, Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il , and Hof‘al.
Earlier, we studied the verb: Qal, which forms the basis for the inflection of other verb stems.
This unit will study Nif‘al, Pi‘el, and Pu‘alverbs stems.
The key to mastering all other inflections of Hebrew verbs is mastering the Qal perfect inflection of the strong verb.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Translate the perfect forms of Nif‘al, Pi‘el, and Pu‘alverbs.
• Identify the functions of these verb stems 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Nif‘al Perfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Nif‘al perfect inflections of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: לעַ פְ נִ Nif‘al Perfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) 107  Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשַׁ מְ נִ He was ruled 3 cp וּלשְׁ מְ נִ They were ruled 3 fs הלָ שְׁ מְ נִ She was ruled 2 ms תָּ לְ שַׁ מְ נִ You were ruled 2 mp םתֶּ לְ שַׁ מְ נִ You were ruled 2 fs תְּ לְ שַׁ מְ נִ You were ruled 2 fp ןתֶּ לְ שַׁ מְ נִ You were ruled 1 cs יתִּ לְ שַׁ מְ נִ I was ruled 1 cp וּנלְ שַׁ מְ נִ We were ruled Note: 1) The Nif‘al functions as the simple passive, in contrast to Qal, which functions as the simple active.
2) The Nif‘al perfect third masculine singular form has the same vowels as לעַ פְ נִ לשַׁ מְ נִ found in the name of the stem ( – ).
3) The prefix נ combines with the first root consonant to form a closed מְ נִ syllable (e.g. )
and this continues unchanged throughout the Nif‘al לשַׁ מָ perfect inflection of 4) In all respects Nif‘al forms are identical to Qal perfect forms.
3.2 Pi‘el Perfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Pi‘el perfect inflections of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: לעֵ פִּ Pi‘el Perfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשֵּׁ מִ He ruled (with force) 3 cp וּלשְּׁ מִ They ruled (with force) 3 fs הלָ שְּׁ מִ She ruled (with force) 108  2 ms תָּ לְ שַּׁ מִ You ruled (with force) 2 mp םתֶּ לְ שַּׁ מִ You ruled (with force) 2 fs תְּ לְ שַּׁ מִ You ruled (with force) 2 fp ןתֶּ לְ שַּׁ מִ You ruled (with force) 1 cs יתִּ לְ שַּׁ מִ ruled (with force) 1 cp וּנלְ שַּׁ מִ We ruled (with force) Note: 1) Pi‘el is an intensive active stem, which is causative in nature (e.g.
לשֵּׁ מִ he ruled with force).
2) The middle consonant of the verb root is doubled as in לשֵּׁ מִ .
3) Shares the doubling of middle consonant in common with Pu‘al and Hitpa‘el.
4) Pi‘el has no prefix in the perfect, just like Qal and Pu‘al.
3.3 Pu‘al Perfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Pu‘al perfect inflection of Hebrew verbs is summarized in the table below: ל עַ פֻּ Pu‘al Perfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשַּׁ מֻ He was ruled (with force) 3 cp וּלשְּׁ מ ֻ They were ruled (with force) 3 fs הלָ שְּׁ מ ֻ She was ruled (with force) 2 ms תָּ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ You were ruled (with 2 mp םתֶּ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ You were ruled (with force) force) 2 fs תְּ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ You were ruled (with 2 fp ןתֶּ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ You were ruled (with force) force) 1 cs יתִּ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ I was ruled (with force) 1 cp וּנלְ שַּׁ מ ֻ We were ruled (with force) Note: 1) Pu‘al is the intensive passive of Pi‘el.
2) It has no prefix in the perfect.
109  3) Qibbuts appears under the first root consonant in all forms of the Pu‘al perfect.
4) The middle root consonant is doubled as in לשַּׁ מֻ 5) Pu‘al perfect is patterned after the Qal perfect 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed other Hebrew perfect stems apart from Qal, namely: Nif‘al, Pi‘el and Pu‘al.
Whereas Nif‘al functions as a simple passive, Pi‘el and Pu‘alfunction as intensive active, and intensive passive respectively.
The basis for forming the perfect inflection of the remaining verb stems is the Qal perfect third person masculine singular.
5.0 SUMMARY The tables below summarize our study of Nif‘al, Pi‘el, and Pu‘alperfect verbs ..

112  UNIT 18 PERFECT OF THE REMAINING VERB STEMS (II) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Hitpa‘el Perfect Inflection 3.2 Hif‘il Perfect Inflection 3.3 Hof‘al Perfect Inflection 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION This unit is a continuation of the study on the perfect of the remaining verb stems in Hebrew.
Recall that the different verbal stems in Hebrew represent the different tenses, moods and expressions found in the language or the functions performed by Hebrew verbs, which do not exactly follow the pattern of English verbal inflections.
The verbal stems are Qal, Nif‘al, Pi‘el, Pu‘al, Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il , and Hof‘al.
The verb stem: Qal, forms the basis for the inflection of other verb stems.
This unit will study Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il , and Hof‘al verbs stems.
The key to mastering all other inflections of Hebrew verbs is mastering the Qal perfect inflection of the strong verb.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Translate the perfect forms of Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il , and Hof‘al verbs stems.
• Identify the functions of these verb stems 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Hitpa‘el Perfect Inflection 113  The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Hitpa‘el perfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: לעֵ פַּ תְ הִ Hitpa‘el Perfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשֵּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ He ruled himself 3 cp וּלשְּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ They ruled themselves 3 fs הלָ שְּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ She ruled herself 2 ms תָּ לְ שַּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ You ruled yourself 2 mp םתֶּ לְ שַּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ You ruled yorself 2 fs תְּ לְ שַּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ You ruled yourself 2 fp ןתֶּ לְ שַּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ You ruled yourself 1 cs יתִּ לְ שַּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ ruled myself 1 cp וּנלְ שַּׁ מ ַ תְ הִ We ruled ourselves Note: 1) Hitpa‘el verb forms normally express a reflexive action, that is an action performed by the subject upon himself/herself.
2) All Hitpa‘el perfect froms are prefixed with תְ הִ which is a closed syllable.
3) The patach under the first root consonant of the third masculine singular form is continued in all other forms of the Hitpa‘el.
4) The middle root consonant is doubled in all Hitpa‘el forms.
3.2 Hif‘il Perfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Hif‘il perfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: ליעִ פְ הִ Hif‘il Perfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לישִׁ מְ הִ He caused to rule 3 cp וּלי שַׁ מ ְ הִ They caused to rule 114  3 fs הלָ י שִׁ מ ְ הִ She caused to rule 2 ms תָּ לְ שַׁ מ ְ הִ You caused to rule 2 mp םתֶּ לְ שַׁ מ ְ הִ You caused to rule 2 fs תְּ לְ שַׁ מ ְ הִ You caused to rule 2 fp ןתֶּ לְ שַׁ מ ְ הִ You caused to rule 1 cs יתִּ לְ שַׁ מ ְ הִ I caused to rule 1 cp וּנלְ שַׁ מ ְ הִ We caused to rule Note: 1) Hif‘il verbs normally serve as the causative active of the Qal.
2) The Hif‘il stem is prefixed with הִ throughout the perfect inflection.
3) Hif‘il perfects are patterned after Qal perfects 3.3 Hof‘al Perfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Hof‘al perfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: ל עַ פְ הָ Hof‘al Perfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms ל שַׁ מְ הָ He was caused to rule 3 cp וּל שְׁ מְ הָ They were caused to rule 3 fs הלָ שְׁ מ ְ הָ She was caused to rule 2 ms תָּ לְ שַׁ מְ הָ You were caused to 2 mp םתֶּ לְ שַׁ מְ הָ You were caused to rule rule 2 fs תְּ לְ שַׁ מְ הָ You were caused to 2 fp ןתֶּ לְ שַׁ מְ הָ You were caused to rule rule 1 cs יתִּ לְ שַׁ מְ הָ I was caused to rule 1 cp וּנלְ שַׁ מְ הָ We were caused to rule Note: 1) Hof‘al is the passive of Hif‘il .
2) All Hof‘al perfects are prefixed with הָ 115  3) In all other respects, Hof‘al perfects are patterned after Qal perfects.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit continued the discussion on other Hebrew stems apart from Qal, namely: Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il and Hof‘al.
Whereas Hitpa‘el functions as a reflexive action, Hif‘il and Hof‘al function as causative active, and causative passive respectively.

118  UNIT 19 IMPERFECT OF THE REMAINING VERB STEMS (I) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Nif‘al Imperfect Inflection 3.2 Pi‘el Imperfect Inflection 3.3 Pu‘alImperfect Inflection 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Whereas Perfect inflection is used to reflect a completed action, Imperfect inflection reflects an incomplete action.
An earlier unit studied Qal Imperfect inflection.
The Imperfects of the remaining verb stems will be studied in this unit and the next.
The imperfect prefixes and suffixes have the same consonants in all stems of the verb.
The vowels of the suffixes are the same for all stems.
However, the vowels of the prefixes differ from stem to stem.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Identify and isolate prefixes and suffixes from Hebrew imperfect verbs • Distinguish between perfect and imperfect verbs.
• Understand the function of imperfect verb inflections in Nif‘al, Pi‘el and Pu‘al.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Nif‘al Imperfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Nif‘al imperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: 119  לעַ פְ נִ Nif‘al Imperfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשֵׁ מָּ יִ He shall be ruled 3 mp וּלשְׁ מָּ י ִ They shall be ruled 3 fs לשֵׁ מָּ תִּ She shall be ruled 3 fp הנָ לְ שַׁ מָּ תִּ They shall be ruled 2 ms לשֵׁ מָּ תִּ You shall be ruled 2 mp וּלשְׁ מָּ תִּ You shall be ruled 2 fs ילִ שְׁ מָּ תִּ You shall be ruled 2 fp הנָ לְ שַׁ מָּ תִּ You shall be ruled 1 cs לשֵׁ מָּ אֶ I shall be ruled 1 cp לשֵׁ מָּ נִ We shall be ruled Note: 1) The Nif‘al imperfect functions as the simple passive action in the future time.
2) The prefix vowel for the Nif‘al imperfect is hireq in all forms except first person common singular, where it is segol.
3) A dagesh forte is placed in the first consonant of the verb root in the Nif‘al נִ imperfect to compensate for the original that dropped out.
For instance: לשֵׁ מָ נְ יִ לשֵׁ מָּ יִ has become .
3.2 Pi‘el Imperfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Pi‘el imperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: Pi‘el Imperfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשֵּׁ מַ יְ He shall rule 3 mp וּלשְּׁ מַ יְ They shall rule (intensive) (intensive) 120  3 fs לשֵּׁ מַ תְּ She shall rule 3 fp הנָ לְ שֵּׁ מַ תְּ They shall rule (intensive) (intensive) 2 ms לשֵּׁ מַ תְּ You shall rule 2 mp וּלשְּׁ מַ תְּ You shall rule (intensive) (intensive) 2 fs ילִ שְּׁ מַ תְּ You shall rule 2 fp הנָ לְ שֵּׁ מַ תְּ You shall rule (intensive) (intensive) 1 cs לשֵּׁ מַ אֲ I shall rule 1 cp לשֵּׁ מַ נְ We shall rule (intensive) (intensive) Note: 1) Pi‘el imperfect may be translated as a simple intensive action in the future time.
2) The two distinguishing characteristics of the Pi‘el imperfect are the sheva under the first prefixed consonant, and the doubling of the middle consonant of the verb root.
3) The simple sheva in the first prefixed consonant changes to hatef-patach in the first person common singular because of the guttural alef.
3.3 Pu‘al Imperfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Pu‘alimperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs is summarized in the table below: Pu‘al Imperfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשַּׁ מֻ יְ He shall be ruled 3 mp וּלשְּׁ מ ֻ י ְ They shall be ruled (intensive) (intensive) 3 fs לשַּׁ מֻ תְּ She shall be ruled 3 fp הנָ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ תְּ They shall be ruled (intensive) (intensive) 2 ms לשַּׁ מֻ תְּ You shall be ruled 2 mp וּלשְּׁ מ ֻ תְּ You shall be ruled (intensive) (intensive) 2 fs ילִ שְּׁ מֻ תְּ You shall be ruled 2 fp הנָ לְ שַּׁ מ ֻ תְּ You shall be ruled (intensive) (intensive) 1 cs ל שַּׁ מ ֻ אֲ I shall be ruled 1 cp ל שַּׁ מ ֻ נְ We shall be ruled (intensive) (intensive) 121  Note: 1) The distinguishing characteristics of the Pu‘alimperfect are the sheva after the prefix consonant, the qibbuts after the first root consonant, and the doubling of the middle root consonant.
2) The Pu‘alimperfect is the passive of the Pi‘el imperfect, translated as the simple intensive in the future time.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed other Hebrew imperfect stems apart from Qal, namely: Nif‘al, Pi‘el and Pu‘al.
Whereas Nif‘al functions as a simple passive in the future time, Pi‘el and Pu‘alfunction as future intensive active, and future intensive passive respectively.
The basis for forming the perfect inflection of the remaining verb stems is the Qal perfect third person masculine singular.
5.0 SUMMARY The tables below summarize our study of Nif‘al, Pi‘el, and Pu‘alimperfect verbs ..

124  UNIT 20 IMPERFECT OF THE REMAINING VERB STEMS (II) CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Hitpa‘el Imperfect Inflection 3.2 Hif‘il Imperfect Inflection 3.3 Hof‘al Imperfect Inflection 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION This unit continues the study on the remaining verb stems imperfect inflection.
Recall, whereas Perfect inflection is used to reflect a completed action, Imperfect inflection reflects an incomplete action.
The imperfect prefixes and suffixes have the same consonants in all stems of the verb.
The vowels of the suffixes are the same for all stems.
However, the vowels of the prefixes differ from stem to stem.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Identify and isolate prefixes and suffixes from Hebrew imperfect verbs • Distinguish between perfect and imperfect verbs.
• Understand the function of imperfect verb inflections in Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il and Hof‘al.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Hitpa‘el Imperfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Hitpa‘el imperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: Hitpa‘el imperfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) 125  Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשֵּׁ מַ תְ יִ He shall rule 3 mp וּלשְּׁ מַ תְ יִ They shall rule himself themselves 3 fs לשֵּׁ מַ תְ תִּ She shall rule 3 fp הנָ לְ שֵּׁ מַ תְ תִּ They shall rule herself themselves 2 ms לשֵּׁ מַ תְ תִּ You shall rule 2 mp וּלשְּׁ מַ תְ תִּ You shall rule yourself yourselves 2 fs ילִ שְּׁ מַ תְ תִּ You shall rule 2 fp הנָ לְ שֵּׁ מַ תְ תִּ You shall rule yourself yourselves 1 cs לשֵּׁ מַ תְ אֶ I shall rule myself 1 cp לשֵּׁ מַ תְ נִ We shall rule ourselves Note: 1) Hitpa‘el imperfect is normally reflexive in meaning, expressing a simple action in the active voice.
2) Hitpa‘el imperfect verb has longer prefix ( תת ת תְְְְ ייייִִִִ, תת ת תְְְְ תּתּתּתִִִִּ , תת ת תְְְְ אאאאֶֶֶֶ , תת תתְְְְ ננננִִִִ ), and the doubling of the middle consonant of the verb root.
3.2 Hif‘il Imperfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Hif‘il imperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: Hif‘il imperfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לישִׁ מְ יַ He shall cause to 3 mp וּלישִׁ מְ יַ They shall cause rule to rule 3 fs לישִׁ מְ תַּ She shall cause to 3 fp הנָ לְ שֵׁ מְ תַּ They shall cause rule to rule 2 ms לישִׁ מְ תַּ You shall cause to 2 mp וּלישִׁ מְ תַּ You shall cause to rule rule 2 fs ילִ ישִׁ מְ תַּ You shall cause to 2 fp הנָ לְ שֵׁ מְ תַּ You shall cause to rule rule 1 cs לישִׁ מְ אַ I shall cause to 1 cp לישִׁ מְ נַ We shall cause to rule rule 126  Note: 1) The Hif‘il imperfect is characterized by patach in the prefix syllable and hireq-yod in the second syllable.
2) The Hif‘il imperfect normally serves as the causative of Qal imperfect, a simple action in the future time.
3.3 Hof‘al Imperfect Inflection The prefixes (preformatives) and suffixes (afformatives) of Hof‘al imperfect inflection of Hebrew verbs are summarized in the table below: Hof‘al imperfect Inflection לשַׁ מָ Qal perfect form (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew English Person Hebrew English 3 ms לשַׁ מְ יָ He shall be 3 mp וּלשְׁ מְ יָ They shall be caused to rule caused to rule 3 fs לשַׁ מְ תָּ She shall be 3 fp הנָ לְ שַׁ מְ תָּ They shall be caused to rule caused to rule 2 ms לשַׁ מְ תָּ You shall be 2 mp וּלשְׁ מְ תָּ You shall be caused to rule caused to rule 2 fs ילִ שְׁ מְ תָּ You shall be 2 fp הנָ לְ שַׁ מְ תָּ You shall be caused to rule caused to rule 1 cs לשַׁ מְ אָ I shall be caused 1 cp לשַׁ מְ נָ We shall be to rule caused to rule Note: 1) The Hof‘al imperfect is the passive of the Hif‘il imperfect, that is a causative passive in the future time.
2) The distinguishing characteristics of the Hof‘al imperfect are qamets-chatuf as the prefix vowel and patach as the vowel between the second and third consonants of the verb root.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit discussed other Hebrew imperfect stems, namely: Hitpa‘el, Hif‘il and Hof‘al.
Whereas Hitpa‘el functions as a reflexive in the future time, Hif‘il and Hof‘al function as future causative active, and future causative passive respectively.
The basis for forming the perfect inflection of the remaining verb stems is the Qal perfect third person masculine singular.

130  UNIT 21 PRONOMINAL SUFFIXES CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Pronominal suffixes with Prepositions 3.2 Pronominal suffixes with perfect verbs 3.3 Pronominal suffixes with imperfect verbs 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Self-Assessment Exercises 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 8.0 Vocabulary 9.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Pronominal suffixes were originally independent personal pronouns that became attached to the noun or preposition they followed.
When appearing on nouns, they are possessive; example: his book.
When appearing on prepositions or the definite direct object marker, they are objective; example: to him.
When attached to verbs, they normally serve as direct objects of the verb; when attached to particles, they may express a variety of relationships, depending on the function of the particles.
This unit studies the functions of the pronominal suffixes with prepositions, and verbs.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Mark out the direct objects of verbs and prepositions.
• Identify possessive nouns • Define other functions of pronominal suffixes.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 1) Pronominal suffixes with Prepositions בְּ לְּ The normal pronominal suffixes for the inseparable prepositions and are as כְּ follows ( is irregular): 131  Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וֹ_ Him 3 mp םהֶ ◌ָ _ them 3 fs הּ◌ָ _ Her 3 fp ןהֶ ◌ָ _ them 2 ms ךָ◌ְ _ You 2 mp םכֶ ◌ָ _ you 2 fs ךְ◌ָ _ You 2 fp ןכֶ ◌ָ _ you 1 cs י◌ִ _ Me 1 cp וּנ◌ָ _ us בְּ Example: (in, by, with) Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וֹבּ with him 3 mp םהֶ בָּ with them 3 fs הּ בָּ with her 3 fp ןהֶ בָּ with them 2 ms ךָבּ ְ with you 2 mp םכֶ בּ ָ with you 2 fs ךְבּ ָ with you 2 fp ןכֶ בּ ָ with you 1 cs יבּ ִ with me 1 cp וּנ בָּ with us 2) Pronominal suffixes with perfect verbs Pronominal suffixes attached to the verb may expressed in two ways: (1) it may be תאֵ joined to , the sign of the direct object, and placed either before or after the verb; (2) it may be joined directly to the end of the verb to which it serves as object.
• The pronominal suffixes for perfects that end in vowels are the same for all stems of the verb; as in: 132  Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms ו וּה_ Him 3 mp ם םהֶ _ them , , 3 fs הָ _ Her 3 fp ן_ them 2 ms ךָ_ You 2 mp םכֶ _ you 2 fs ךְ_ You 2 fp ןכֶ _ you 1 cs ינ ִ_ Me 1 cp וּנ_ us וּלשְׁ מָ Example: (they ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וּהוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled him 3 mp םוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled them 3 fs הָ וּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled her 3 fp ןוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled them 2 ms ךָוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled you 2 mp םכֶ וּ ל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled you 2 fs ךְוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled you 2 fp ןכֶ וּ ל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled you 1 cs ינִוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled me 1 cp וּנוּל שָׁ מ ְ they ruled us • The pronominal suffixes for perfects that end in consonants are also the same for all stems of the verb; as in: Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וֹ וּה ◌ָ _ him 3 mp ם ◌ָ _ them , 3 fs הּ ◌ָ _ her 3 fp ן ◌ָ _ them 2 ms ךָ ◌ְ _ you 2 mp םכֶ ◌ְ _ you 2 fs ךְ ◌ֶ _ you 2 fp ןכֶ ◌ְ _ you 1 cs ינִ ◌ַ _ me 1 cp וּנ ◌ָ _ us 133  ל שַׁ מ ָ Example: (he ruled) Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וֹל שָׁ מ ְ he ruled him 3 mp םל ָ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled them 3 fs הּל ָ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled her 3 fp ן לָ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled them 2 ms ךָ לְ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled you 2 mp םכֶ ל ְ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled you 2 fs ךְ לֵ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled you 2 fp ןכֶ ל ְ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled you 1 cs ינִ לַ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled me 1 cp וּנ לָ שָׁ מ ְ he ruled us 3) Pronominal suffixes with imperfect verbs • The pronominal suffixes for imperfects that end in vowels are the same as those of perfects ending in vowels for all stems of the verb; as in: Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms ו וּה_ Him 3 mp ם_ them , 3 fs הָ _ Her 3 fp ן_ them 2 ms ךָ_ You 2 mp םכֶ _ you 2 fs ךְ_ You 2 fp ןכֶ _ you 1 cs ינִ_ Me 1 cp וּנ_ us וּלשְׁ מ ְ י ִ Example: (they will rule) Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וּהוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule him 3 mp םוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule them 3 fs הָ וּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule her 3 fp ןוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule them 134  2 ms ךָוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule you 2 mp םכֶ וּ ל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule you 2 fs ךְוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule you 2 fp ןכֶ וּ ל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule you 1 cs ינִוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule me 1 cp וּנוּל שְׁ מ ְ י ִ they will rule us • The pronominal suffixes for imperfects that end in consonants are also the same for all stems of the verb; as in: Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וּה ◌ֵ _ Him 3 mp ם ◌ֵ _ them 3 fs הָ ◌ֶ הּ◌ָ _ Her 3 fp ן ◌ֵ _ them , 2 ms ךָ◌ְ _ You 2 mp םכֶ ◌ְ _ you 2 fs ךְ ◌ֵ _ You 2 fp ןכֶ ◌ְ _ you 1 cs ינִ ◌ֵ _ Me 1 cp וּנ ◌ֵ _ us לֹ שׁמ ְ י ִ Example: (he will rule) Singular Plural Person Hebrew Person Hebrew 3 ms וּהל ֵ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule him 3 mp םל ֵ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule them 3 fs הָ ל ֶ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule her 3 fp ן לֵ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule them 2 ms ךָ לְ שָׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule you 2 mp םכֶ ל ְ שָׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule you 2 fs ךְ לֵ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule you 2 fp ןכֶ ל ְ שָׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule you 1 cs ינִ לֵ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule me 1 cp וּנ לֵ שְׁ מ ְ י ִ he will rule us 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit studied pronominal suffixes in relation to prepositions and perfect and imperfect verbs.
Even though it did not cover all the aspects to include nouns and particles, what is represented is able to prepare the student for a remarkable progress in Hebrew Grammar.
The student is encouraged to seek for further studies in this subject.
135  5.0 SUMMARY 1) The pronominal suffixes for perfects that end in vowels are the same for all stems of the verb.
2) The pronominal suffixes for perfects that end in consonants are also the same for all stems of the verb.
3) The pronominal suffixes for imperfects that end in vowels are the same as those of perfects ending in vowels for all stems of the verb.
4) The pronominal suffixes for imperfects that end in consonants are also the same for all stems of the verb.
