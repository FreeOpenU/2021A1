is a first semester course and consists of 28 Units.
It covers the general introduction to Law of Evidence and a conceptual clarification of the technical terms that are of common usage in the Law of Evidence.
The material has been developed with local examples and case law with occasional references to very important foreign judicial decisions.
This Course Guide is intended to help you study evidence in the Nigerian Legal System.
It informs you albeit in a nutshell, what the course is about, what materials you require, how to work your way through theCourse Material.
It highlights important aspects of the Evidence while it provides a general guideline to help you in building up a workable time table for yourself, specifying the amount of time you may likely spend on each unit of the course.
Within each unit, there are Self Assessment Exercises and Tutor-Marked Assignments, and other activities that may be required of you.
It is advisable that you attend to them as they assigned to help to moniour understanding of the subject as well as your progress.
The Tutorial Class, wherever it is available, is also to assist you in that direction.
It is important that you participate in the discussions and do not hesitate to share your experiences, difficulties or challenges with tutors and other students of proven academic excellence.
The key to a successful study of the Law of Evidence is understanding it.
You have to understand it, study it, manage your study time effectively and strengthen your command of English Language.
The Law of Evidence you are about to study cannot be found in any one Book or one statute.
It is contained in several statutory laws, various courts laws and codes of practice made under statutory powers and judicial precedents.
Students are warned to avoid the decided cases and textbooks that aolete.
A lawyer must be curre Course Aims This Course aims at giving you an overview of the Law of Evidence.
Its goals are: • Introduce you to the Law of Evidence • Point to you, the direction where the Law of Evidence in the Nigerian Legal System comes from.
• Assist you to identify different types of Evidence • Define and conceptualise important terms, principles and rules in the Law of Evidence, which may constitute pitfalls if you do not first understand them.
• Equip you to differentiate between principles, and rules of evidence, guidelines and judicial discretion.
• Empower you to understand how to prove your case in the court and which evidence may be admissible or inadmissible.
• Prepare you for further research.
4 Learning Objectives Each of the Units in the Course Material is intended to isolate a particular item of the Law of Evidence and to achieve specific objectives.
When you shall have studied the Course Material, you should be able to: • Explain the basic concepts of the Law of Evidence • Define, explain or describe certain important terms in the Law of Evidence such as: the Law of Evidence, Evidence, facts in issue, evidential material, court, etc.
• Explain, in a nutshell, legal rules and principles governing admissibility of Evidence.
• Differentiate between the classes of Law of Evidence, and Identify each class of evidence when you see one.
• Differentiate between facts in issue and relevant facts.
• Demonstrate an understanding of what similar facts and 'res gestae' mean • Explain the extent to which the Law of Evidence is home-grown or foreign • Discuss in and speak the language of Law of Evidence.
It is important that you read, first, the objectives of each unit before studying the unit itself.
Working Through This Course In order to have a solid grip of the Law of Evidence, you must study the Course Material carefully.
Students, who aspire towards distinctions, may require to readMaterials recommended for further reading.
In each unit, you will find Activities and Self Assessment exercises.
At specific points during the course, you shall be required to attempt and to submit Tutor Marked Assignments for assessment purpose.
You will be required to write an examination at the end of the course.
It is expected that an average student will complete this Course Material in 16 weeks.
You are advised to allocate your time to each Unit and ensure you complete the course successfully and on time.
The major components of the Course are listed below: Course Materials • The Study Units • Textbooks • Assignment File • Presentation Schedule The components of a study unit are: • Quality • Quantity • .Test 5  Study Modules and Unit The Course is arranged into modules and units.
There are 3 modules and 12 Units and they are: MODULE I Definition and Sources of Law of Evidence UNIT 1 Introduction to Law of Evidence 2 Sources of Law of Evidence (I) 3 Sources of Law of Evidence (II) MODULE 2 Classification d Types of Evidence UNIT 1 Classification 2 Direct Circumstantial Evidence 3 Primary and Secondary Evidence 4 Documentary Evidence MODULE 3 UNIT 1 Relevant Facts (1) 2 Relevant Facts (2) 3 Similar Facts 4 Res Gestae 5 Complaints The Units follow the same basic structure, namely: • Title • Content: The List of main section heading • Introduction: telling you what the Unit deals with • Objectives: the learning outcomes; that is to say, the things you should be able to do after completing the Unit successfully.
• Main Body: this is the main text sub-divided into sections, Conclusion .Summary References/Further Reading There are Self Assessment Exercises, Activities and Tutor Marked Assignments.
Units There are 12 Units in this course.
Each Unit isolates a topic within the Law of Evidence with a specific objectives, indicates to you its most significant features as well as the directions of study, reading materials, self assessment exercises and in some cases Activities, and Tutor Marked Assignments.
These exercises are designed to assist you in achieving the stated learning objectives of each of the units and of the Course as a whole.
6 Textbooks Your main textbook for this course are indicated in your Course Material.
Your starting point is thisCourse Guide.
This is to establish the basic foundations, which are considered vitally necessary to understanding particular topics later in the Unit.
You may need to complement your reading with any of the textbooks indicated in the References at the end of each Unit.
Statute The Law of Evidence comprises; principles, rules, guidelines and discretion.
The Evidence Act is the primary statute book.
You find this in the Appendix to your Course Material.
Read up the statutory provision whenever there is any reference to them.
Other rules can be found in the Rules and Practice of the different courts or other sources.
Case Law Judicial precedent is a source of law of evidence and guidelines.
It informs you about important judicial decisions and how judges exercise their discretion in relation to the admissibility of any item of evidence.
You should develop the habits of making references to the decided cases where they are cited.
After you have studied a decided case, you are advised to make in your casebook, extracts from the reports; so that you do not go on repeatedly searching for a frequently cited case in the Library.
You may find references to official reports e.g.
Reports of the Law Reform Commission, or Legal Journals an added advantage.
Cases have been referred to without full citation.
This is deliberate.
It is a distinguishing mark of Lawyers that they know where to find cases and the law.
Besides, it is not intended to impose any particular law report.
It also assures that you will read the full text and have a better grip of the rules and principles enunciated in the particular cases.
Assessment There are two aspects of the assessment of this work: the Tutor Marked Assignment (TMA) and the written examination.
Tutor Marked Assignment There is a Tutor Marked Assignment at the end of each Unit, which you are required to attempt and submit with a Tutor Marked Assignment Form to your Tutorial Facilitator for formal assessment.
Each assignment must be submitted within the period specified in the Presentation schedule and the Assignment file.
It is your responsibility to ensure that your assignments get to the tutorial facilitator on time.
If, for any reason, you are unable to do so, you must inform your Tutorial Facilitator before the assignment is due and discuss the possibility of an extension.
You will be assessed on all of the Assignments; but only the best three performances 7 will be used for your continuous assessment.
Each assignment carries 10.0 per cent and all three together will account for 30.0 per cent of your total course work.
Final Examination and Grading The final examination for Law of Evidence will be of three hours.
It carries 70.0 per-cent of the total course grade.
The examination will consists of the questions which reflect the kinds of Activities, Self Assessment Exercises (SAE) and the Tutor Marked problems, which you possibly have already encountered.
All areas of the Course are expected to be covered.
You may therefore find it useful to review your Self Assessment Exercises, Tutor Marked Assignments and Activities for your examination.
You should meaningfully use the time between the time you finish the last unit and the date of examination to revise the entire Course.
Course Marking Scheme The following table lays out how the actual course marking is broken down SIN Assessment Marks 1.

8 How to Get the Most from Course Studying the Law of Evidence is important for: • Persons who may be concerned with criminal investigation • Anyone, who may bear responsibility for conducting court trials in criminal or civil matters • Persons interested in law generally and to distinguish between rules of Evidence applicable in Civil litigation from those applicable in a Criminal process.
The Law of Evidence is concerned principally with what and how facts or materials are admissible in order to prove something that is in dispute.
For this purpose, your study is concentrated on what obtains in the Magistrates courts where 80.0 per cent of crimes are tried.
In civil matters, several aspects of the Law of Evidence have been relaxed.
Many restrictions on admissibility of evidence, which apply in Criminal proceedings have been removed in civil proceedings.
As between Civil and Criminal proceedings, the rules of evidence are different to certain extent in practice.
In Administrative Tribunals and Arbitration, the rules of evidence have little or no application at all.
In distance learning, study units play the role of the University Lecturer.
You have the advantage of reading and working through the study materials at your pace, and at a time and place that suit you best.
As you read the Course Material, perceive that a lecturer is talking to you and you are listening to him.
Just as a lecturer might give you in'-class exercise, so your study units provide you exercises to do at appropriate times.
In addition you have access to facilitation facilities.
You get the most from your study if you follow the following procedure: First, read this Course Guide, then read the units one after another.
Do not skip any.
Note the Content Outline.
Read the Introduction Look at the objectives or learning outcomes; keep the list in mind as you proceed with the study.
Remind yourself of the learning outcomes from time to time.
Read this Course Material carefully and in detail.
Make Notes of anything you do not understand Note the new words and phrases you have come across, add them to your vocabulary Notebook.
Attempt the Assessment exercises and activities as you come across them.
At the end of the Unit, ask yourself what you have read.
Measure your understanding by reference to the learning outcomes or objectives.
Self Assessment Exercise are interpersed throughout the Units.
Working through them will help you to achieve the objectives of the Unit and prepare you for assignments and the examination.
You are advised to Work through them.
9 Activities You may come across a number of Activities in the course.
They are to help you to learn, think, devise a response and in the process help you to understand the matter in issue.
Facilitators and Tutorials A total of 8 hours of tutorial is required to be provided in support of this course.
Your Study Centre Director will notify you of the dates, time and location of these tutorials, together with the name and telephone numbers of your tutorial facilitators, as soon as you are allocated a tutorial group.
Your tutorial facilitator will mark and comment on your assignments, keep a close watch on your progress.He or she will solve any difficulties you might encounter as well as provide assistance to you during the course your tutor marked assignments.
You are expected to submit your assignments to your tutorial facilitators before the due date.
They will be marked by your tutors and returned to you as soon as possible.
Do not hesitate to contact your facilitator by telephone or e-mail should you need help.
Contact him or her if : • You do not understand any part of the study Unit or the assigned readings.
• You have difficulty with the Self Assessment Exercises or Activities • You have a question or a problem with your facilitators comments on an assignment or with the grading of an assignment.
You should do your best to attend the tutorials.
This is the only chance you have face to face contact with your facilitator and ask questions, which are answered instantly.
You can raise any problemsencountered in the course of your study.
To gain the maximum benefit from the course tutorials, you need to prepare a question list before attending any.
You will gain a lot from participating actively.
Dr. Christopher Allen and Professor Stephen Guest have suggested Ten golden rules for studying the Law of Evidence.
You may find the rules helpful.
They are: 1. learn each topic as you study it and frequently revise 2.
Read each unit in your course material at least twice.
3.
Read as many of the important decided cases as you can 4.
Read as much of the textbooks you find under "Reference" as you can 5 Take full notes of what is said in any tutorials that you attend 6 Read with a book of statutes at hand for reference (The Evidence Act is your major concern in this course and it is an appendix to your course material).
7.
Condense your own fill notes into a skeleton set of notes.
8.
Practice answering the Self Assessment Exercises, Activities and Tutor Marked Assessments.
9.
Keep up to date 10.
Try to see the law in action.
10 Summary The Law of Evidence aims at equipping you with the knowledge and skills of the principles and rules of Evidence.
Upon completing the course, you should be able to define, identify, explain, and then describe important term such as facts, relevant facts, evidential facts etc.
The law of Evidence is interesting; topical, dynamic and challenging.
It is relevant to all branches of law and in both Civil and Crimina1 processes.
You will write an Examination at the end of the Course.
The Examination gives you opportunity to demonstrate to the examiner that you have an understanding of the law of Evidence to the required standard.
If you work conscientiously through the Course Material and do not skip any Unit, you will experience no difficulty in passing your examination.
Best of luck.

SUMMARY 6.
TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT 7.
REFERENCES 1.0 INTRODUCTION You may be familiar with the word “Evidence” in English language but remember you are not an English student, neither is the present Course “English”.
You are in the business of Law and the Law of Evidence in its technical meaning.
In this unit, you shall examine what the Law of Evidence is and, the courts which apply it.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Define or explain what Law of Evidence is about 2.
Critique the legal definition of ‘Evidence’ , and the ‘Law of Evidence’ 3.
Identify the courts which must apply the Law of Evidence 3.0 LAW OF EVIDENCE AND COURTS THAT APPLY IT 3.1 Definition of Law of evidence The Law of Evidence relates to: -proof of facts before the court - who may prove - how facts may be proved, and -what facts may not be proved in a court of law.
12 Stephen says that the Law of Evidence is “that part of the Law of Procedure which, with a view to ascertain individual rights and liabilities in particular cases, decides.
(1) What facts may, and what may not be proved in such cases (2) What sort of evidence must be given of a fact, which may be proved (3) By whom and in what manner the evidence must be produced by which any fact is to be proved.
“That part of the Law of Procedure” can be found in judicial decisions, statute Law and Text- Books, among others.
What is Evidence Evidence is the foundation of proof.
If the court believes and accepts the facts presented before it, it may result in proof.
Otherwise it is not proven.
Evidence has been defined in different ways.
Examples are; (a) Taylor defines evidence as: “All legal means, exclusive of mere argument, which tend to prove or disprove any matter of fact; the truth of which is submitted to judicial investigation” (b) In his own definition of evidence, McKelvey States: Evidence is any matter of fact from which an inference may be drawn as to another matter of fact; the former fact is called the evidential fact; the latter, the ultimate, main or principal.
(c ) Nokes’ definition is that Evidence means “Judicial evidence consisting of 1.
Facts which are legally admissible, and 2.
The legal means of attempting to prove such facts.
(d) Philpson states that evidence means the testimony, whether oral, documentary or real, which may be legally received in order to prove or disprove some facts is dispute.
(e) According to Cross, evidence is the testimony, hearsay, documents, things, and facts, which a court will accept as evidence of the facts in issue in a given case.
(f) To Best, evidence is “any matter of fact, the effect, tendency or design of which is , to produce in the mind, a persuasion, affirmative or disaffirmative, of the existence, of some other matter of facts” 13 Best distinguished Judicial evidence as “evidence received by courts of justice in proof or disproof of facts, the existence of which comes in question before them.
(g) Aguda adds that Evidence is the means by which facts are proved but excluding inferences and arguments.
3.2 Critique of definitions of Evidence.
There are other definitions: but what you have learned suffices to give you an insight into the different perspectives from which you may reflect on the definition, dimension and scope of Evidence and the Law of Evidence.
The various definitions provide you with a broad range of definitions.
Each of the definitions is open to one criticism or the other.
None of them attains the status of universal acceptance.
Let us look at a few of the definitions again.
1.
Aguda States that Evidence does not include “inferences and arguments” But is this correct?
Is “Confession” not Evidence?
A “confession’ suggests “an inference” that the accused has committed an offence.
It is admissible evidence when it is voluntarily made.
2.
Taylors’ definition is incomplete.
While his definition includes methods of proof, it excludes “actual facts proved”.
It is silent on the evidence, which is tendered but rejected which also is evidence.
The definition emphasized some terms, which themselves required to be first defined e.g.
“facts” 3.
McKelvey’sdefinition is the reverse of Taylor’s definition.
McKelvey excludes methods of proof; He admits only the actual facts proved.
4.
Look at Phipson’s definition; and the use of the conjuction “and”.
The truth is that the court may be satisfied by oral or documentary or real evidenceor by a combination of any of them or all of them together.
Phipson’s definition is restricted to oral, documentary and real evidence.
What about “presumption”.
A “presumption” is a conclusion which may or must be drawn until the contrary is proved.
Presumption is part of evidence in law and in fact as we shall see later.
The Law of Evidence is dynamic; its development has been casuistic, afflicted by a number of statutory rules and exceptions which do not seem to have any logical connection.
This may tend to make the law of Evidence somewhat difficult.
For the moment, bear in mind that any discussion of Law of Evidence devolves on the following questions: 14 1.
Is the fact or material relevant?
2.
Is it admissible to prove something that is in controversy?
3.
Has the correct method of proof been adopted?
4.
Methods of proof includes: a.
Exercise of judicial discretion in relation to admissibility of a fact or material in evidence b.
How the judge directs himself in assessing the weight to attach to items of evidence.
c. Oral, real and documentary This leads us to the choice of Taylor’s definition (subject to the inadequacy earlier pointed out).
In Taylors definition, Evidence covers: 1.
All the classes of evidence – oral, documentary or real evidence 2.
Facts proved 3.
Facts disproved.
His reference to “fact which are the subject matter of judicial investigations” answers the description of “relevancy” As Professor Adesanya has explained, evidence is a means to an end, the end-product being “proof” or “disproof”.
Self Assessment Exercise Taylor defines Evidence Law as:__________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ In your own view, evidence may mean: ____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________ The grounds upon which you base your definition are: 1.
________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________ 2.____________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________ 15 3.____________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________ In both civil and criminal trials in the Court, the Law of Evidence directs how this may be done and the issues usually involve: - Calling witnesses - Which witness or witnesses to call - Which questions may be asked - Which questions may not be asked and if asked may not be answered - Statements of person who are not called, which may or may not be excluded - Exhibits: documents or other tangible things, which may or may not be tendered - Which fact or facts require proof by proving some other facts and how to prove it.
- Inference that may be legitimate from given fact(s) and situation(s).
- What facts may not be proved e.g.
state secrets, accused’s bad character, facts forbidden by exclusionary rules of evidence - What evidence is relevant.
3.3 Judicial Evidence Judicial evidence, according to Nokes, consists of: 1.
Facts which are legally admissible, and 2.
The legal means whereby such facts may be proved Facts that are legally Admissible Legally admissible facts include - Facts in issue - Hearsay, except where it is forbidden or excluded - Opinion of experts - Character, except where it is excluded or forbidden - Privilege where it is applicable.
Legal Proof: The Legal means of attempt to prove such facts include: - Witness(es) - Oaths or affirmation - Documents - Formal admissions or confession - Corroboration 16 Special means of proving facts also exist.
These are: - Judicial Notice - Presumption of facts Self Assessment Exercise.
1.
Five categories of facts, which are legally admissible in the law of evidence are: a.
______________________________________________________ b.______________________________________________________ c._______________________________________________________ d. ______________________________________________________ e.______________________________________________________ 2.
The Law of Evidence has laid down two special means of proving certain facts.
The two ways are: 1.
________________________________________________________ 2.
________________________________________________________ 3.4 The Courts that apply the Law of Evidence The main courts in Nigeria are: 1.
Superior Courts These are courts of record or courts of unlimited jurisdiction.
Examples are: The Supreme Court of Nigeria The Court of Appeal The High Court (Federal and States) The Sharia Court of Appeal (Federal and States) The Customary Court of Appeal (Federal and State) Other Courts that may be so designated by the National or State Houses of Assembly 2.
Inferior Courts These are Courts other than Superior Courts.
Examples are: The Magistrates Courts The Coroner’s Courts Juvenile Welfare Courts 3.
Special Courts These are specialist courts established for specific and specialised purpose with spelt - out jurisdiction.
Examples are: The Judicial Tribunals.
The Court Martial 17 The National Industrial Court.etc.
This list of courts is not exhaustive.
The courts named are examples only.
One important question you need to answer at this juncture is whether the Evidence Act applies in all the courts?
For example should the customary courts or the Area or native courts including District Courts be bound to comply with the Evidence Act in the proceedings before them?
Similarly does the Evidence Act bind the Court Martial or the Police Orderly Room Proceedings?
4.
Meaning of Court: Section 1, Evidence Act states that the term“Court” includes all judges and magistrates and except arbitrators,and all persons legally authorised to take evidence.
In Section 228 it states that the “court” means a High Court or a “Magistrate Court” Sometimes, the Court, the Judge or the Magistrate are used interchangeably.
Self Assessment Exercise Enumerate as many inferior Courts as you know there are in your State?
Activity You may find it extremely rewarding to visit the Magistrate Court, the District court, the Area and Customary Courts, one after the other.
Observe the structure of the Court, judicial and non-judicial officers and their roles in the respective Courts.
Assess in each Court, the level of application of Law of Evidence.
Based on your assessment of the level of application of the principles and rules of evidence in each particular court, attempt to visualise what happens in the event of an appeal from the decisions of these courts to Superior Courts.
Share your experience with your study group and your Tutorial Facilitator.
3.5 Application of Evidence Act: a.
Court The Evidence Act applies to all judicial proceedings in or before any court established in the Federal Republic of Nigeria but it shall not apply to:- - Proceedings before an arbitrator; or - Field General Court Maritial.
- (Evidence Act, 2004, S. 1 (2)) b. Offences 18 A person charged under the Road Traffic Law of a state with driving at a speed greater than the allowed maximum shall not be convicted solely on the evidence of one witness that in his opinion he was driving at such speed.
The Road Traffic Act thus provides for the application of Evidence Act as well as the sufficiency of such applicable evidence.
Similarly a person shall not be convicted upon the uncorroborated testimony of one witness for the following offences under the Criminal Code: Uttering any seditions words section 51 (j) (b) Defilement of girls under 13 (under 11 in the South Western and EasternStates).
(Section 218) Defilement of girls under 16 and above13 and of idiots (section 221).
Procuration (Section 223) Procurement of defilement of women by threats, or fraud, or administering drugs.
(Section 224) For more details, read Evidence Act, Section 179 The foregoing analysis may be summarised as follows: 1) The Evidence Act applies to all Judicial proceedings in or before any court established by Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
2) In every other case, judicial proceeding must be strictly guided in accordance with the Evidence Act or the statute or law establishing the Court and Procedural rules.
For examples; Rules as to burden of proof and standard of proof are mandatory in all judicial proceedings, where the Evidence Act applies.
4.0 CONCLUSION Evidence includes questions about what facts may or may not be proved, what sort of evidence must be given of a fact which may be proved, by whom, in what manner evidence must be produced by which any fact is to be proved.
It is all about admissibility of evidence in courts.
5.0 SUMMARY You have learned about the definitions of Evidence.
A few of them were examined and criticised.
You can carry out similar exercise with regard to the rest of the definitions.
Taylor’s definition is inadequate but it is preferred 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASIGNMENT 1.
There is no definition of Evidence of universal acceptance.
Discuss 2.
Evidence deals with facts and proof of facts.
Enumerate and critique the legal means whereby such facts may be proved.

REFERENCES 20  1.0 INTRODUCTION Knowledge of the source or origin of the Law of Evidence impacts on its validity or legitimacy.
Hence its importance.
In this unit, you will learn where the Evidence Law started, assess where we are and be able to visualise possible challenges.
Again what you require is to adopt a critical attitude towards the Study Material.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this unit, you should be able to: • Outline the process of development of the modern Law of Evidence in Nigeria.
• Explain the main theories of and sources of Law of Evidence.
• Critique the theories of and sources of Evidence Law.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT: SOURCES OF LAW OF EVIDENCE Legal writers have classified law into: 3.1 (a) Substantive and (b) Procedural law for the purpose of legal proceedings a.
Substantive Law This is a generic term, which covers such areas of law as tort, contract; crime etc.
It is the law that defines legal rights, duties and liabilities.
Examples are : The Criminal Code The Penal code.
b.
Procedural Law Also called Adjectival Law; it is the law which prescribes the process by which substantive law is lifted from the statute book and applied in practice.
It regulates the prosecution of offenders or civil litigation and how the facts upon which rights, duties, liabilities may be founded are established in the courts.
Examples are: Criminal Procedure Code Criminal Procedure Act Evidence Act 3.2 SOURCES OF LAW OF EVIDENCE 21 Law of Evidence is a type of the Public Law, like the Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Revenue Law.
The Law of Evidence is unique in that it applies to all branches of law.
Generally, you can say that the Law of Evidence derives from the following: a.
Informal (Traditional) or non-formal source.
The rules from this source may be legal but they are not authoritative.
There are persuasive only.
b.
Formal source of law.
A formal source give validity to the law.
It is also in the nature of the ill and common consciousness of the people of Nigeria; - c. Material Source.
This may be i.
Historical : Writings of distinguished learned writers.
They are of persuasive authority.
ii.
Legal; the laws which the law per serecognises.
Examples are statutes,judicial precedents, etc d.Authoritative and binding sources.
This refers to the origin of legal rules and principles, namely: • The legislature, which through legislations, brings into existence, received and local statutes, • The courts which through authoritative judicial decisions, create judicial precedents eg common law, doctrines of Equity and local precedents • Customs, the origin of customary laws.
3.3 Historical development of Law of Evidence It can be said that Law of Evidence in Nigeria originates as well as derivesits authority from the following: local laws and custom Received English Law, to wit; a. the English Common Law b. the doctrines of Equity c. The statutes of general application in force in England as at January 1, 1900 d Local legislations and the judicial interpretation based on them 22 e. The Law Reports f. Text Books and Monographs on Nigerian Law g. Judicial Precedents.
Activity Let’s stop here for a moment.
Reflect on the sources of law you have just learnt; and relate each one of them to the reality of the comtemporary Nigerian Society and attempt to proffer answers to the following issues: Who makes laws as a matter of fact i.e.
the de facto law makers Who makes laws as a matter of law, i.e.
the de jure law- makers What is the relationship between de-facto and de-jure law makers Is an enactment by one person or group the act or omission of the other or is it not?
In Customary Law, the ultimate question is; What does the “The Bible”, “The Quaran” or “The Oracle” say, depending on whether you are a Christian, Muslim or traditionalist.
Most laws in modern Nigeria are contained in the statutes, made by the legislatures.
Like any other citizen, you are deemed to know every statute, including the Evidence Act, because ignorance of law is no excuse.
In passing a statute into law, do the legislators carry you along, before, during and/or after the enactment?
- Assess the freedom of expression at the floor of the National Assembly when passing a Bill.
- How real or apparent is the idea that the wealthy and the elite dictate the laws.
- Compare law making and execution of the law vis-à-vis the role of the wealthy and powerful - Whose interests does the law protect - In trying to resolve these knotty issue, let us examine theories of sources of Law.
3.4 Theories of Sources of Law The theories of Sources of Law range from the Consensus, to the Conflict and middle of the Road theories.
23 a.
Consensus theory This theory argues that Laws are a product of unanimous agreement – a consensus ad idem – of the society.
This idea functions as an integrated structure, which the members of the pertinent society mutually and voluntarily agree to and accept as their norms, rules, and values, which should be uniformly respected.
b.
Conflict Theory The conflict theory is in dissonance with the Consensus theories.
It denies that the society is ever consensual, but conflict and competitive.
Accordingly, conflict theory argues that laws are a dictate of the wealthy and powerful elite, and they make laws only to perpetuate their positions and class interests.
C. Middle-of-the Road Course Theory The proponents of the Middle Course theory argue that the laws are definitions by the privileged group, of the dominant values, notions and morals.
The better view is that the Laws are the handiwork of the legislators who are your elected representatives.
Theyexercise the political and legal powers of the state but not necessarily to protect their positions, statues or class interests None of the theories is completely valid or wholly invalid.
Each has its merit and deficiencies.
The same conclusion is true of any legal system in any part of the world.
3.5 Origin of the Law of Evidence 3.5.1.
Pre-Colonial Era.
The pre-colonial rules of evidence, applied in pre-colonial settlements, Empires and Kingdoms which now constitute Nigeria they were: 1.
The Moslem Law of the MalikiSchool.
This law applied in Islamic areas and Courts in those areas.
It is a written law.
2.
The Customary Law.
This applied in non-Islamic areas and courts.
It is either wholly unwritten or part- written.
3.5.2 Colonial Law of Evidence By Ordinance, No 3, of 1863, Her majesty, the Queen of England, introduced into the Colony of Lagos, the following Laws: 1.
Common Law of England 2.
Doctrines of Equity 3.
Statutes of General Application 4.
Laws specifically enacted for the Colony of Lagos.
24 The English –type courts, were set up to enforce and administer these laws.
Example of such courts are: The Consular Court and The Equity Court.
The Supreme Court The Supreme Court metamorphosed into the Court of Civil and Criminal Justice; it resurrected as the Supreme Court of Lagos colony.
The Supreme Court Proclamation, 1900 also created a Supreme Court for the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria.
The Native Court Proclamation 1900-1901 established the statutory Native Courts.
Prior to 1900, the Received Law and native laws and customs co-existed, and were Sources of Nigerian law including the Law of Evidence.
The ordinance 3, 1863 as modified by the Supreme Court Ordinance, No.
4, 1876, applied the Received Laws, the Statutes of General Application in force as at the 24 July, 1874 (later varied to 1st January 1900) subject to local circumstances.
They permitted local laws and customs, which were not repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience norincompatible with local statutes.
In the North, the Native Court Proclamation, 1900 similarly permitted customary laws that were not repugnant to natural justice and humanity.
After 1900 and more particularly after the amalgamation of the colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and the Protectorate of the Northern Nigeria (1914), the local laws and ustoms declined and the eceived English law and the established English Courts prevailed.
The Native courts Proclamation, 1900 as amended by the Native Courts Proclamation No.
12, 1901 established the statutory Native Courts with exclusive civil and riminal jurisdiction.
The traditional authority of indigenous courts as well as the customary laws and customs of the Local communities disappeared, or were swept under ground.
The following Ordinance further entrenched the Common Law of England in the Nigerian legal system: The Protectorate Courts ordinance, 1933.Section 12.
The Provincial Court Ordinance 1914 as amended, section 10.
The Magistrates Court Ordinance, 1943, Section 30.
The Native Courts Ordinance, 1933.
The West African Court of Appeal Ordinance 1933.
The Supreme Court Ordinance 1943, section 12.
Evidence Ordinance No.
27, 1943.
25 By Official Gazette No.
33 of 1945, Notice No.
618, the Evidence Ordinance, No.
27, 1943 became effective on 1st June, 1945.Thus the evidence law, which applied in Nigerian up to 1945, was the Received Law and more particularly, the Common Law.
3.5.3 Judicial Precedent In the early law there was no organised system of Law reporting.
Records of Courts proceedings were contained in Private Reports and the Year Book.
They contained little about rules of evidence.
The reason was that early Judges resented such rules.
Even Lord Manslfield in Lowe v. Jollifee (1762) was heard to say: “We don’t now sit here to take our rules of evidence from Siderfin and Keble” At the close of the 18th Century, however, private reporting had grown enormously and there was a gradual decline in resenting “rules of evidence from Siderfin andKeble” (with apology to Lord Mansfield).
Case Law and the rules of evidence began to acquire prominence.
Soon there was a conscious and deliberate effort to codify the common law rules of evidence in the form of a digest.
An example is Sir James Fitzergerald Stephen’s Digest of Law of Evidence.
Sir Stephen’s vision was to codify the common law for the use of English Courts, but the British Parliament rejected it and refused to adopt it.
Rather the Parliament adopted and constituted the Digest into the Indian Law of Evidence, 1872 and subsequently adopted it as Law of Evidence for Pakistan, Sri- Lanka, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
In 1943, the British Parliament passed into law, the Evidence Ordinance of Nigeria, introducing into Nigeria, a modification of Sir Stephen’s Digest.
The modification was to incorporate contemporary English decisions e.g.
Duncan v. Cammell Laird (1942) and Hollington v. Hewthorne& Co Ltd. (1943).
In addition to the Evidence Act, there are a number of other statutes which contain specific aspects of Law of Evidence.
Example are as follows: 1.
The Road Traffic Act.
This Act provides the rule of evidence that in a charge of exceeding speed limit, the opinion of a witness as to the speed of vehicle require corroboration.
2.
Indian Hemp Act.
The burden of proof shifted from the prosecution to the accused.
3.
The Companies and Allied Matters Act The existence of a company became provable by the production of a certificate of incorporation 4.
Marriage Act.
Proof a marriage can now be established on presentation of a marriage certificate 26 5.
Foreign Statute English statute may be a source of the Law of Evidence – those in particular which are of general application as at 1 January, 1900.
6.
The Evidence Act, 1938 (UK) The Act remains the source of the Rule of Evidence on “Admissibility of documentary Evidence as to the fact in issue”, which is now part of the operative law of Evidence in force in Nigeria.
3.6 Textbooks Text Books Writers, as Source of Law of Evidence There are a number of legal literature on the Law of Evidence.
Examples are: Jeremy Bentham (1827) Rationale of Judicial Evidence Taylor’s Law of Evidence Stephen’s Digest (1876) Phipson’s Evidence (1891) Aguda : The Law of Evidence Nwadialo F. : Modern Nigerian Law of Evidence Babalola, Afe: Law and Practice of Evidence in Nigeria Activity Other Sources of Law of Evidence Summarise in one paragraph each, the gist of the following cases: (1) Duncan v iCammell Laird (1942) (2) Hollington v Hutton & Co. (1943) 4.0 CONCLUSION This diagram will remind you of the location of Law of Evidence in the Nigerian Legal System Law Substantive Procedural Law Law (Also called Adjectival Law) 27  Procedural Law Law of Evidence (properly so called) Law of Evidence resides in Public Law but it applies to Private and Business Law as in deed all categories of Law.
The Law of Evidence derive from the Common Law, Sir James Fitzgerald Stephen’s Digest of law of Evidence, judicial precedents, statutes, and text book writers, among others.
The principal source today is the Evidence Act as amended.

SUMMARY In this unit, you have learned about the sources of the Law of Evidence in Nigeria.
The Law of Evidence applicable in pre-colonial settlements, kingdoms and Empires (which became Nigeria in 1914) were customary law and the Moslem Law.
By Ordinance No.
3 of 1863, No.
4 of 1876 and other ordinances, the Common Law of England was extended to Nigeria.
The Evidence Ordinance which was enacted in 1943 and became effective on 1s January 1945 has substantially been re-enacted to form the present day Law of Evidence in force in Nigeria.
In the next unit, you shall learn about the Constitution as a source of Evidence Law, the application of Common Law and what happens in the face of conflicts in matters that are not expressly dealt with in the Evidence Act.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this Unit, you should be able to; 1.
Discuss or explain the Nigeria Constitution as a Source of Law of Evidence 2.
Indicate the extent to which the Law of Evidence is alien or home grown 29 3.
Critique the Law of Evidence within the context of its source or historical evolution 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Independence Constitution, 1960 The Nigerian (Constitution) Order-in-Council, 1960 provided as follows: Section 3: Existing Laws (1) Subject to the provision of this section, the existing laws shall have effect after the commencement of this order as if they has been made in pursuance of this order and shall be read and construed with such modification, adaptation, qualifications, and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with this order.
Both the Exclusive ad Concurrent legislative lists were silent on the issues of Law of Evidence in 1960 except that: Items 44, Exclusive legislative list gave the central government sole legislative authority on (a) any matter that is incidental or supplementary to any matter mentioned elsewhere in this list; or to the discharge by the Government of the Federation or any officer, court or authority of the Federation of any function conferred by this Constitution.
Item 28: the Concurrent Legislative List empowered both the Central and Regional (states) Governments to legislate on“any matter that is incidental or supplementary to any matter mentioned elsewhere in this list” Section 64: Powers of Parliament to make Laws; Subsection (4): If any law enacted by the legislature of a Region is inconsistent with any law validly made by Parliament, the law made by Parliament shall prevail and the Regional law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.
(5): Subject to the provision of subsection (4) of this section, nothing in this section shall preclude the legislature of a Region from making laws with respect ot any matter that is not included in the Exclusive Legislative List.
30 Section 77; Evidence Act Parliament may make laws for Nigeria or any part thereof, with respect to evidence in regard to matters not included I the legislative lists.
Provided that an Act of Parliament enacted in pursuance of this section shall have effect in relation to any Region only to the extent that provision in that behalf is not made by the legislature of that Region.
3.2 The Republican Constitution, 1963.
The provisions in the 1960 Constitution was reproduced verbatim in the Constitution of the Federation 1963 but in different sections as follows: 1960 1963 Exclusive List 44 45 Concurrent List 28 9 Power of Parliament 64 69 Evidence 77 83 Summary of the 1960 and 1963 Constitutions: The implication of the Constitutional provision was the multiplicity of laws of Evidence.
The Evidence Act applied throughout the Federation over federal matters.
The Regions also had their respective laws of Evidence applicable within the Regional boundaries in matters within the competence of the Regional governments.
However, the Law of Evidence of the Regions were mere replication of the Law of Evidence of the Federation in respect of matters outside the Exclusive Legislative List.
3.3 Military Dispensation The Constitution in force during the Military Dispensation in 1966 – 1979 and 1983 – 1999 was a combination of the unsuspended part of the Republican Constitution and the rest of 31 the provisions as amended by Decrees.
The Laws of Evidence remained as it was prior to 1966.
3.4 The 1979 and 199 Constitutions 3.4.1 The Constitutions of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1979 – 1999.
Both Constitutions by Section 4: Legislative Powers, provides as follows: (2) The National Assembly shall have power to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of the Federation or nay part thereof with respect to any matter included in the Exclusive Legislative List.
(Also Section 4 (2) of the 1999 Constitution) (3) The power of the National Assembly to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of the federation with respect to any matter included in the Exclusive Legislative List shall, save as otherwise provided in this Constitution, be as to the exclusion of the House of Assembly of States.
Also see: Section 4(3) of the 1999 Constitution, Second schedule: schedule: Legislative powers Part 1, Exclusive legislative Powers Items 23: Evidence (This is contained in both 1979 and 1999 Constitution) Few states of the Federation re-enacted into law their Evidence Law, and they were a repetition of the Evidence Act passed by the National Assembly.
The only difference was that the Evidence law of the state contained rules of Evidence on Residuary Matters.
3.4.2 The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 For the purpose of law of Evidence, you need to refer to section 36 of the 1999 Constitution.
The 1999 Constitution, Section 36, Fair Haring States: 36:-(1) In the determination of his civil rights, obligations, including any question or determination by or against any government or authority, a person shall be entitled to a fair 32 hearing within a reasonable time by a court or other tribunal established by law and constituted in such manner as to secure independence and impartiality.
(2.)
Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of section, a law shall not be invalidated by reason only that confers on any government or authority power to determined questions arising in the administration of a law that affects or affect her civil rights and obligations of any person if such law; a) provides for an opportunity for the person whose rights and obligations may be affected to make representation the administering authority before that authority makes decision affecting that person; and b) contains no provisions making the determination of administering authority final and conclusive.
(3.)
The proceedings of a court or the proceedings of any tribunal relating to the matters mentioned in subsection (1) of this section (including the announcement of the decisions of the court or tribunal) shall be held in public.
(4.)
Whenever any person is charged with a criminal offence, he shall, unless the charge is withdrawn, be entitled to a fair hearing in public within a reasonable time by a court or tribunal: Provided that: a) A court or such a tribunal may exclude from its proceedings, persons other than the parties thereto or their legal practitioners in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality, the welfare of persons who have not attained the age of eighteen years, the protection of the private lives of the parties or to such extent ad it may consider necessary by reason of special circumstances in which publicity would be contrary to the interests of justice.
b) If in any proceedings before a court or such a tribunal, a Minister of the Government of the Federation or a Commissioner of the Government of a State satisfies the court or tribunal that it would not be in the public interest for any matter to be publicly disclosed, the court or tribunal shall make arrangements for evidence relating to that 33 matter to be heard in private and shall take such other action as may b e necessary or expedient to prevent the disclosure of the matter.
(5.)
Every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.
Provided that nothing in this section shall invalidate any by reason only that, the law imposes upon any such person the burden of providing particular facts.
(6.)
Every person who is charged with a criminal offence will be entitled to:- a) Be informed promptly in the language that understands and in detail of the nature of the offence: b) Be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; c) Defend himself in person or by legal practitioners of own choice; d) Examine, in person or by his legal practitioners, witnesses called by the prosecution before any court tribunal and obtain the attendance and carry out examination of witnesses to testify on his behalf before court or tribunal on the same conditions as those apply to the witnesses called by the prosecution; and e) Have, without payment, the assistance of an interprete if he cannot understand the language used at the trial of offence.
(7.)
When any person is tried for any criminal offence, court or tribunal shall keep a record of the proceedings and accused person or any person authorized by him in that behalf be entitled to obtain copies of the judgment in the case with seven days of the conclusion of the cases.
(8.)
No person shall be held to be guilty of a criminal offence on account of any act or omission that did not, at the it took place, constitute such an offence, and no penalty shall imposed for any criminal offence heavier than the penalty in full at the time the offence was committed.
34 (9.)
No person who shows that he has been tried by court ofcompetent jurisdiction and either convicted or acquitted shall again be tried for offence or for a criminal offence having the same ingredient as that offence save upon the order of a superior court.
(10.)
No person who shows that the has been pardoned as a criminal offence shall again be said for that offence (11.)
No person who is tried for a criminal offence shall be compelled to give evidence at the trial (12.)
Subject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted on a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed in written law; and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act, the National Assembly or a Law of a State, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of a law.
You need to note however that all the Constitutions of Nigeria, 1990 – 1999 recognized the competency of the National Assembly alone to legislate on matters of Evidence.
Matters of Evidence are now listed in the Exclusive Legislative List.
You should remember that the Constitution is supreme law and has a binding force on all authorities.
Any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency.
It provides various categories of rights, duties rules and imposes obligations and liabilities.
See especially chapters II and IV of the 1999 Constitution.
Activity What is the gist of the following cases a) Duncan v Cammell Laird (1942) b) Hollington v Hewthorne& Co Ltd. (1943) 1.7 Autochthony of Evidence of Law 1.7.1 How autochthous is the Law of Evidence 3.5.
Is the Law of Evidence Home-grown or Common Law 35 It is an exciting area of controversy whether or not common law of England is still operative as the source of the Nigerian Law of Evidence.
To what extent is the Law of Evidence home-grown or foreign?
- Autochthony or autochthonism refers to the nativity or foreigness of the Law of Evidence.
- An Act is autochthorious if it does not trace its validity to a foreign legislature, or if it is homegrown and rooted in its domicile.
- Autochthony therefore implies; -a kind of Africanism - a kind of rebirth or a break in legal continuity - an enactment by virtue of an authority that is native to it.
Activity With the mindset, consider: 1.
Origin of the Law 2.
Where the court derives its authority 3.
Contents of the legislation in issues Autochthony has two parts 1.
Formal autochthony – the origin of source 2.
Substantive (formal autochthony – content of Legislations).
3.7.2 Further Exposition Read Section 5 of the Evidence Act especially 5 (a) Attempt to summarise what this section says in your own words and language Can you visualize the scope and extent of the provision?
36  This provision permits the reception of evidence - Which is admissible under any other statutory enactment in force in Nigeria.
- Which would have even admissible, had the Evidence Act not being passed.
In essence, the Act allows the admission of evidence, which would be admissible under pre- existing rules as if the Evidence Act has not been passed The question arises whether pre-existing law refers to the immediate past Evidence Act, or to Common Law or any other claim of evidence for the matter; since no evidence can now be excluded at common law.
One school of thought is that the pre-existing law referred to the rules which existed on June 1, 1945.
Another School of thought is that the pre-existing law is the common law.
What happens if the statutes are silent and do not cover the issue at hand?
The general opinion is that the Common Law applies.
Most of the High Court Rules expressly provide for the application of the common law to fill the gap.
Look at the following cases; R v Itule (1961) Held: the matter was not dealt with expressly and therefore common law applied.
JimohAmoo v R (1959) Held: where an English judicial precedent conflicts with the provision of the Act, the Courts must follow the Act.
R v Agwuna Held: that there is no provision in the Act which allows evidence to be rejected save as provided in the Act, itself.
37 You should not forget that the Common Law rules of Evidence applied in Nigeria before 1st June, 1945 when it was supplanted by the Evidence Ordinance (Now Evidence Act) The Evidence Ordinance (Now Evidence Act) was based largely on Sir James Stephens Digest of Laws of Evidence (12th Edition), and this Digest itself was a deliberate effort to codify the Common Law Rules of Evidence in form of digest.
Stephens Digest ultimately became the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which itself inspired the Laws of Evidence operating in Sri Lanka, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria.
One thing distinguishes Nigeria’s edition from Sir James Stephens Digest.
Nigeria’s Evidence Act incorporated contemporary judicial decisions.
Examples of such English decision engrafted into the Evidence Act are: - Duncan v CammellLaird (1942).
See also Conway v Rimmer (1968) which subse overruled Duncan v Cammell Laird.
It is hoped that when the Evidence Act is amended, this position in the UK will be reflected, that is, amending section 220 of the Evidence Act in line with the mndecision in Conway v Rimmer.
This is reflected on Evidence Act, Section 220 - Hollington v Hewthorne& Co Ltd. (1943) The ratio decidendi in this case is reflected in section 51 of the Evidence Act Apart from the Case Law: some provisions of English Evidence Acts 1895 – 1938 were incorporated into Nigerian Evidence Act.
Examples are: Section 90: Admissibility of documents Evidence as fact in issue Section 159: Competency of person charged to give evidence 4.0.
CONCLUSION The Constitution of Nigeria, 1960 and 1963 were silent on law of Evidence.
The result was a multiplicity of Law of Evidence – regional and federal.
Since 1979, it has become an item under the Exclusive Legislative List.
38 5.0.
SUMMARY Law of Evidence was not in the Exclusive or Concurrent Legislative List in both the Independence and Republican Constitutions (1960-1963).
The Regions and the Central Governments legislated on “any matters; that is incidental or supplementary matters”.
The Regions also Legislated on “any matter that is not included in the Exclusive legislature List e.g.
Law of Evidence.
In both 1979 and 1999 Constitution, “Evidence” became item 23 in the Exclusive Legislative List.
The provisions of the Evidence Act (particularly Section 5), and of the various state High Court Rules permit the application of Common Law rules of Evidence where there is a lacuna.

It may be classified into various types on different bases.
In this unit you shall learn some of the more important classifications and types.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Enumerate the more important classification of Law of Evidence 2.
Explain and illustrate with examples, the different classes or types of Evidence.
3.
Critique the types of Evidence learned.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Different writers have classified Evidence in different ways.
Let us look at some of them.
a.
Gross and Williams These authors classified Evidence into: - Direct and circumstantial - Primary and Secondary - Insufficient, Prima Facie and Conclusive b. Nwadialo’s classification of Evidence is into: - Direct and Circumstantial Evidence 41 - Direct and hearsay Evidence - Oral and Documentary - Real Evidence - Primary and Secondary Evidence Other classifications are into: - Direct and Circumstantial - Direct and hearsay or Original and Hearsay - Oral and Documentary - Primary and Secondary - Prima facie and Conclusive - Personal and Real - Pre-appointed and Casual - Best Evidence Evidence may also be classified into:- Direct and Indirect Evidence Direct and Hearsay Evidence Oral and Documentary Evidence Primary and Secondary Evidence Personnal and Real Evidence Per-appointed (or Pre-Constituted) Best Evidence.
42 No one classification is better than the other.
In a conflict situation, it is incumbent that you must, (whether consciously or not,) determine the nature of evidence, whether or not the piece of evidence before you belongs to any of the categories classified.
From there, you proceed further to determine rules of law you should apply to the case.
The important thing therefore is that you are able to identify each type of evidence and understand which rule to apply to the particular case.
Types of Evidence From the various classifications mentioned above, you are able to enumerate the following “types” of evidence: that some what common; From Con and Wilikins 1.
Direct 2.
Circumstantial 3.
Primary 4.
Secondary 5.
Insufficient 6.
Prima facie 7.
Conclusive 8.
Hearsay 9.
Oral 10.
Documentary 11.
Real 43 12.
Original 13.
Indirect 14.
Personal 15.
Pre-appointed 16.
Causal 17.
Best Evidence But it may not be correct to assert that there are 18,19,or 20 types of evidence.
It is a problem of nature of an evidence being called different names.
For example: Best Evidence may be primary, direct, oral, pre-constituted, Perusal etc.
You may want to learn in nutshell how to define or describe these evidence types.
Some of them will be discussed in depth later.
1.
Direct Evidence Your evidence is direct if it is based on your personal knowledge or observation and if true to believed, proves a fact out of inference or presumptions.
It a testimony of What you hear with your ears What you see with your eyes What you smell with your nose What you touch with your hand or body What you taste with your mouth or tongue The term ‘direct’ relates to the source of your knowledge, being deposed to.
It is also called “positive evidence”.
2.
Circumstantial Evidence 44 Also called indirect evidence or oblique evidence because it is based on inference rather than personal knowledge or observation.
It is evidence of some collateral fact from which the existence or non-existence of some fact in question may be inferred as a probable consequence.
3.
Primary Evidence (section 94 EA) The best evidence, original evidence, that particular means of proof, which under any probable circumstances affords the greatest certainty of the fact in issue – specific and definite and carrying on its surface no indication that a better evidence lurks behind.
4.
Secondary Evidence (section 95 EA) Evidence of hearsay; Testimony of Contents of a lost document; mediate evidence, substitutionary evidence.
5.
Insufficient Evidence Evidence that is inadequate to prove something such that no presumption can safely be raised.
6.
Prima Facie Evidence Evidence that, on the surface, is significant to prove something, establish a fact or sustain a judgment unless the opponent produces contrary evidence.
It is the minimum evidence which the law requires in any given case – just the evidence that is sufficient to establish a fact in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
7.
Conclusive Evidence Also called irrebuttable presumption of law, when the law forbids evidence to be contrary.
Conclusive evidence or conclusive proof is that evidence, though not irrebuttable, is so strong as to oblige the court to come to a certain conclusion or to overbear any other evidence to the contrary, even though it is not irrebuttable, like prima facie evidence, a conclusive evidence is the sum total of the evidence adduced by a party indicating that, that party has met the requirements of the law and the burden of proof as required of him or her.
8.
Hearsay Evidence 45 Hearsay is statement other than one made by the declarant, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
Double hearsay is that statement which contains further hearsay statements within it.
9.
Oral Evidence Also called “panel evidence”, means evidence given orally – a verbal testimony of a witness 10.
Documentary Evidence A documentary evidence is that evidence which is supplied by a writing or other document.
It is a requirement before the court can admit it in evidence.
11.
Real Evidence This is the physical evidence that plays a direct part in the incident in question.
Salmon describes it as “anything which is believed for any other reason than that someone have said so, is believed on real evidence”.
Real evidence consists of production of any object used in committing a crime, e.g.
gun, knife, pen.
12.
Original Evidence This is a direct or best evidence.
It is a witness’s statement that he or she perceived a fact in issue by hearing, seeing, smelling, touching or tasting or that the witness was in a particular physical or mental state.
13.
Personal Evidence This is the evidence which a competent witness under oath or affirmation gives a trial or in an affidavit or deposition 14.
Pre-appointed Evidence A pre-appointed evidence is pre-constitutional evidence, prescribed or procured advance for the proof of certain facts.
Example is the testimony of a witness who had hidden in cupboard to hear the conversation of other.
By operation of the law, there must be two witnesses to the execution of a will.
Evidence that is not pre-appointed or pre-constituted is causal evidence.
46 15.
Best Evidence Rule In best evidence rule is that which the nature of the thing will afford.
It is evidence which is more specific and definite as opposed to that, which is merely general and indefinite or descriptive.
The best evidence is that kind of proof, which under any possible circumstances affords the greatest certainity of the facts in question or evidence which comes on its surface, no suggestion of better evidence behind .
Thus a direct evidence is superior to a circumstantial evidence.
Evidence of consent or hand-writing is best given by the person consenting or the writer respectively.
Although these were the types of evidence indicated in your discourse of classification of evidence, there are a lot more types of evidence.
Examples are admissible and non admissible evidence, expert evidence.
Dubious classes of Evidence The classes of evidence you have learned are not exhaustive.
There are some types of evidence that are incapable of classification.
Examples are: a nod a sigh sky writing you may note the following: silence: This may amount to admission Visit to Locus in quo the class of evidence to which it belongs is not certain.
But see Guold v Evans and Co. (1957) where Lord Denning expressed the view that a visit to locus in quo should be regarded as real evidence, character evidence, rebuttable and irrebutable evidence, evidence in chief, etc.
Indeed classes or types of evidence cannot be exhausted.
They include all the means by which any alleged matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted to investigation, is established or disproved – all species of proof legally presented at trial.
47 4.0.
CONCLUSION You have learned about the classification of evidence.
These are no one way of classification.
It is important you are able to identify any specie of evidence whenever you come across it.
Without such knowledge, you may not known what rule to apply.
5.0.
SUMMARY Evidence may be classified in various ways.
You learned how cross and Wilkins, Nwadialo and other legal writers have attempted to do so.
Attempts have been made to define briefly a number of types of Evidence as were classified by the writers.
In the next Unit you will learn in greater detail, some of the important types of Evidence which you will commonly come across.
Activity Reading over the definition of the Evidence types you have learned.
Attempt to compare and contrast one with another.

UNIT 2: DIRECT AND CIRCUMSTANCES EVIDENCE CONTENT 1.0 INTRODUCTION 2.0 OBJECTIVES 48 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 DIRECT EVIDENCE AND QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE 3.2 DIRECT EVIDENCE 3.3 CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 4.0 CONCLUSION 5.0 SUMMARY 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT 7.0 REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the last Unit, you learned about different types of evidence, and defined a number of them.
In this unit, you will learn in greater depth, two of the important classes of evidence – direct evidence and circumstantial evidence’.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Attempt to explain the term “direct” in relation to Evidence 2.
Identify a direct evidence as it occurs 3.
Differentiate between direct evidence and other types of evidence 4.
Demonstrate an understanding of the rules of evidence as they relate to ‘direct evidence’ 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Direct Evidence and Circumstantial Evidence 49 Thayer says that evidence is any matter of fact which is furnished in a legal tribunal, otherwise than by reasoning or a reference to what is noticed without proof, as the basis of inference in ascertaining some other matter of fact.
Two of the ways of presenting that testimony, documents, or tangible objects that tend to prove or dispose the existence of an alleged fact or by direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.
As John Wigmore as said, there is no disputed case that will ordinarily be proved solely by circumstantial or solely by direct evidence.
Ordinarily, there is evidence of both kinds.
3.2 Direct Evidence A direct evidence is a statement of personal knowledge or observations, which tend to prove a fact without inference or presumption.
The word “direct” relates to the source of knowledge being disposed to.
A direct evidence is the testimony of a witness who perceived the fact in dispute with one of his/her own senses, or the production of the document which constitutes the fact.
Your evidence is ‘direct’ if it is a testimony of a fact which you perceive with one of your senses – hearing, sight, smell, touch or taste.
That is to say it is the testimony as to the perception of a fact in issue.
SeeEvidence Act section 77 and summarise it in 2 or three sentences ones.
Examples of Direct Evidence: .
production in cost of the material thing eg weapon of offence, article .
inspection of the Locus in quo – the place where subject matter is located .evidence of the fact in issue itself e.g.
the evidence of an eye-witness.
.
evidence of a witness speaking for his/her personal knowledge of a fact, the existence by which is required to be proved.
Illustration 50 A,B, and C went to the Public House, and while they drank, a violent quarrel broke out among them.
A and C challenge each other; they both angrily rush out.
T followed trying to stop them.
Soon after leaving the hall, C suddenly drew out a knife, stabbed A twice.
A slumped and died.
Police has arrested C for suspected murder of A; and obtained statements form C, B, and T among other.
‘T’ in his statement wrote: “I was in the Public house, I got on a table next to where A, B, and C sat.
At a point, A, B, and C had bitter alteration with one another.
They spoke in high tones; A said to the other, let’s go down if you’ll live to tell your story tomorrow”.
Both rushed down.
I rushed down with them to try and stop them, but it was no use C pulled out a dagger, stabbed A two times and A fell down.
He bled profusely and efforts to revive him failed”.
C has been charged with the murder of ‘A’ and the Police seeks to tender T’s statement.
In this case, the fact in issue is: Whether it was C who killed A. T witnessed C perpetuating the act of killing A. T’s testimony of what she heard with her ears, and saw with her eyes is a direct evidence of it – evidence of the fact in issue T’s testimony relates directly on the very issue before the court.
The problem with direct evidence is that it is seldom available and there may be no witness(es) in most cases when crime is committed.
Where direct testimony of eye witnesses is not available, the court is permitted to infer from the facts proved, the existence of other facts that may be logically inferred (I’udo-debia& others v The State (1976)).
Where it is available, direct evidence is the best evidence.
3.3 Circumstantial Evidence Circumstantial evidence is an indirect evidence – evidence other than a direct evidence.
when the evidence available does not consist of the fact in issue but of evidential facts, such evidence is circumstantial.
It is neither evidence of the fact in issue nor a detailed account of what 51 happened.
It is evidence facts.
It is also – evidence of a number of items pointing to the same direction -evidence of other facts from which the fact in dispute can be inferred, either directly or indirectly with more or less certainty.
-also described as presumptive or indirect evidence.
Examples of Circumstantial Evidence .
finger-prints at the scene of crime leading to the presumption that the person who made the prints was there .
possession of a murder weapons or of stolen, goods Illustration It is arraigned before the court for the murder of Z.
There was no direct evidence as to who killed Z.
But there are before the court:# Fact W which may prove fact X Fact X which may prove fact Y Fact Y which may prove fact Z Fact W is a direct evidence of fact X but a circumstantial evidence of fact Z.
Illustration 2: AB is being tried for the murder of XY before a court.
The prosecutor’s evidence is as follows: Busola: My name is Busola.
XY was my husband.
AB said I have jilted and married AB and he is aggrieved.
He vowed to take my life.
I know AB for over 5 years, he owns the gun and cartridges.
Keys are in the house of Haruna, his friends for safe keeping.
On Friday October 15, my husband XY left the house at 12.00 noon for a party.
I did not see him again until the next day when the Public showed the dead body .
52 2.Haruna said: I am Haruna Allan, am a friend to AB and XY and Busola.
In 2009, AB bought a double barrel gun; and cartridges; and kept them in my house or safe keeping.
On Thursday 14 October, AB met me.
He said he needed to service and clean up the gun and he withdrew the gun and cartridges.
3.
The police investigating officer’s testimony before the court: I am detective constable John.
In the course of investigation the allegation of murder levied against AB; I conducted a search in his person and home; I found a gun in his house.
It was concealed in the chimney.
I also got some cartridges.
They are the type commonly fired from the type of gun.
I searched the body of the deceased.
I found injuries and pellets in the body of the deceased.
The pellets corresponded with the cartridges.
The injuries were fresh.
I inspected the place where the body of the deceased was found.
There were foot prints.
The foot prints corresponded with the impressions made at the accussed house.
There were flakes of paints in the clothing found with the accused.
The flakes of paints corresponds with the paints at the scene of murder.
AB also made sentences saying: I am not guilty of murder.
I did not kill Deji.
He was my friend.
I bought a double barrel for hunting, not to kill any person.
I am being framed up by the Police.
I am innocent of the charge.
The Pathologist wrote: I performed autopsy on the deceased.
I found bullet injuries on the chest which caused excessive bleeding from which Deji died.
Deji died of gun shoot.
I extracted pullets from the body deposited by the gun sht the deceased received.
Received some shooting with blood stains.
Here are they.
I examined the blood.
It is of the same blood group AA with that of the deceased.
The Ballistic Expert says: 53 The investigatory office sent me some pellets and a double barrel guns.
These are the pellets and the gun.
I examined them scientifically.
The pellets corresponded with the bullets/cartridges commonly fired from the type of the double barrel.
Both are lethal.
Remember that the subject of inquiry is Murder.
The fact in issue is whether it was AB who killed XY There is no direct evidence of any person to the effect he saw, Chukwu when he killed XY, if at all.
What you have are different items of evidence of Busola, Haruna, Constable John, Pathologist and Ballistocian.
The testimonies of each of these witnesses are indirect, presumptive or circumstantial evidence.
How do you describe this type of evidence.
Can it be liken to a chain?
“It has been said’, say Pellock that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain and each pieces of evidence as a link in the chain, but that is not so, for then, if any one link breaks, the chin would fall.
It is more like the case of rope comprises of several cords.
On strand of the cord might be insignificant to sustain the weight but three stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength.
Thus it may be in circumstantial evidence, there may be a combination of circumstances, no one of which would raise a reasonable conviction or more than a mere suspicion, but there (no more) taken largely may create a conclusion of guilt with as much certainty as human appears can require or admit of”.
Nwadialo has explained that in order to support or sustain a conviction, circumstantial evidence must: .
be cogent and compelling .
point irresistibly to the accused and to no other else as one culprit .
be incompatible with the innocence of the accused 54 .
be incapable of explanation on the basis of other reasonable hypothesis than one of guilt Take illustrations from a civil cause.
W alleged that H has committed adultery.
Direct evidence in this type of case is hardly obtainable.
Circumstantial evidence may be evidence of .
familiarity .
Opportunity .
Birth Registration of a child of a woman other than that of the woman’s husband .
Birth of a child after a long absence of the woman’s husband .
visit to brothel .
Veneral disease .
Blood test Circumstantial evidence is subject to some infirmities: 1.
There is a possibility that the witness may be telling a lie 2.
The witness may be mistaking 3.
The inference may be erroneous in the particular case.
4.0 CONCLUSION Direct evidence consists of testimony of empirical observer – what he or she presumed with his or her own senses.
Conversely, a circumstantial evidence is evidence of an inference form which that fact in issue may be drawn.
5.0 SUMMARY Direct evidence is evidence of the fact in issue itself.
E.g.
evidence of an eye witness.
Evidence is an indirect evidence.
It is presumptive.
Circumstantial evidence may be a chain.
Thus, fact Z 55 prove fact Y which may prove Fact X which may prove fact A. in this example, Z is a direct evidence of Y; but a circumstantial evidence A.
The oral testimony of a witness to murder is direct.
The evidence that broken glass from the headlamp of a defendants’ car was found on the wrong side of the road is circumstantial evidence from which a disputed fact can be inferred.

UNIT 3: PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EVIDENCE CONTENT 1.0 INTRODUTION 2.0 OBJECTIVE 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 PRIMARY EVIDENCE 3.2 BEST EVIDENCE RULE 3.3 SECONDARY EVIDENCE 4.0 CONCLUSION 5.0 SUMMARY 56 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT 7.0 REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the last Unit, you learned some types of evidence, particularly direct and circumstantial evidence, and their infirmities.
In this /Unit, you shall learn more classes, namely; primary and secondary evidence.
It is important that you are able to identify each class when you find it.
Therefore you need to develop as usual a critical attitude towards each class you learn, understand it and practice the application of its rules.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have read this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Identify the following classes of Evidence a.
Primary Evidence b.
Secondary Evidence 2.
Explains the rules of Secondary Evidence 3.
Critique each class of evidence 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Primary Evidence (section 94 EA) The word ‘primary’ derives from the latin word “Primo” meaning ‘first’ – original.
Primary evidence means the productions in court of the original document itself that contains the facts to be proved or for inspection of the court.
Thus an original document or thing for instance, is the primary evidence itself.
Primary Evidence includes: 57 • Production of original document or thing as evidence of itself or its contents.
The real document itself produced for inspection is a primary evidence.
This includes a duplicate original document when it seeks to acquaint the court with the contents.
A number of documents made by a single act by use of carbon papers, for this purpose, is original.
Consequently, documents forming part of a number made by one uniform process, for example by photography, lithography or printing, not being mere common copies of the original are original and primary.
So also each part of a document executed in several parts or the counterpart of a document • Evidence, which does not by its nature suggest the existence of a better evidence.
This is evidence of highest quality available, as measured by the nature of the case rather than the thing being offered as evidence.
Be that as it may, the court, today accepts any relevant evidence whether or not there is a better evidence available.
Activity Read Evidence Act, Section 94.
Best Evidence Rule.
Primary evidence is also termed ‘Best Evidence’ which requires the production in court of the best evidence of which the nature of the case would permit.
The best evidence rule excludes: • Testimony concerning the condition of a thing unless the ting itself can be produced • Circumstantial evidence if a direct evidence is available.
3.2 Best Evidence Rule The Best Evidence Rule presupposes that no better evidence could have existed than what is adduced.
Illustrations: .
Dike swears as to what he saw.
That is original, direct; Better than indirect or circumstantial, like Fatima; narration of what Dike told her that she (Dike) saw.
58 Production of original document e.g.
The Will is primary, Better than oral testimony of its contents or secondary evidence of Dambaba who had seen and read it.
Conversely, proof of admission of the contents of a document of the party against whom it is sought to be tendered is a primary evidence.
If there be two or more ways of proving a fact, the method most cogent, tha others is to be adopted.
Lord Hardwiche confirmed that the judges and usages of the Law have laid it down that there is but one general rule of evidence: the best that the nature of the case will allow.
Omichund v Baker, 1744.
However, good this best evidence rule may have been it has ceased to be a fixed rule of law it is no more than a mere counsel of prudence to adduce the best evidence available rather than a rule of law excluding inferior evidence merely because a superior evidence is available.
Thus where the handwriting of document is disputed, the Best evidence rule excludes every other evidence except the production of its writer.
Now, however, that seeking to tender the document may elect to prove his or her case by evidence of handwriting through testimony of a witness who knows it or saw him/her write it.
If two methods are available to prove a matter, the party whom the burden of proof lies, may select the less cogent method.
It is no more than a matter for comment that the more cogent method was not adopted.
The case of Garton v Hunter (1994) illustrates the modern attitude to the Best Evidence Rule.
In that case, the Lands Tribunal, in assessing rates, excluded the calculations proffered by expert based on profits and on a contractor’s basis, quoting well known dicta that where a particular hereditament was let at a rock-rent, than “that evidence is the best evidence and for that reason alone is admissible.” The Court of Appeal held that the Tribunal had erred in law; the evidence on the profits or contractor’s basis should have been admitted, and the tribunal had rejected relevant and admissible evidence on a dictum no longer applicable.
Sir Lord Denning: 59 “The Best Evidence Rule has gone by the board long ago.
We admit all relevant evidence.
The goodness or badness of it goes to weight and not to admissibility.
Also R v Stevenson (1971) Nonetheless, it can be said that the Best Evidence Rule still subsists and evidence can still be excluded altogether on the ground that it is not the best evidence available.
Take a transaction by a written document, e.g.
a lease, or Mortgage Deed.
Although sensual methods of proof are available, the court would demand that if you have the original document, you must produce it, unless non-production is excused.
However, such instances are not to be misconstrued as anything in the nature of the Bet Evidence Rule as a fixed rule of Law.
Rather, they are suggestive only that the secondary evidence or other evidence adduced is so unreliable that is would be unsafe to admit it.
Self Assessment Exercise How valid is the statement that the Best Evidence Rule is certainly not applicable in Nigeria where the exclusion of evidence is governed entirely by the Evidence Act.
3.3 Secondary Evidence (section 95 EA) Secondary evidence is evidence other than a primary evidence.
It consists of the repetition or reproduction in court of oral or written statements previously made out of court.
It is inferior previously made out of court.
It is inferior to the primary evidence and it becomes, subject to certain conditions, admissible when the primary evidence is lost or inaccessible.
Examples of Secondary evidence are: .
a copy of original documents, produced by a different mechanical process than the original .
a copy of the document .
a verbal narration of the content of an original documents by a person who has seen it .
a copy of a document made by a different process than the original .
a certified copy of the original documents 60 From these examples, you can see that a secondary evidence may be oral or in writing.
Perhaps for this reason, legal writers have described a secondary evidence as a residue rather than as a class of evidence.
Furthermore, a secondary evidence does suggest the existence of a primary evidence or at least a better evidence – the existence of the original document which the archaic best evidence rule demands should be produced as evidence of its contents.
Generally however, the court will be inclined to exclude a secondary evidence if the purpose of rendering it is to prove the truth of the statements.
However, it would admit it to prove not the truthfulness or falsity of the statements but the fact of such statements having been made, regardless of the truth or falsity.
4.0.
CONCLUSION Primary Evidence includes: .
the original document or thing .
the counterpart of a document which was executed together with it .
the printed, lithographic, Photostat or photographic copy of document produced in one uniform process Secondary evidence may be: A copy of the document Oral testimony of the contents of a document Secondary Evidence is more of unclassified residue.
5.0 SUMMARY Primary evidence means – ‘first’ or ‘original’ evidence – Production in court of original document itself as evidence is itself or its contents.
The best evidence rule presupposes that there is no better evidence that could have been adduced but this rule is said to have “gone by he board long ago”.
Secondary Evidence is evidence other than primary evidence – the residue 61 of evidence beyond primary evidence.
It is excluded from evidence if its object is to prove the truthfulness of what it states .it is admissible evidence that it was made, regardless of its truth or falsity.

Unit 4: DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE CONTENT 1.0 INTRODUCTION 2.0 OBJECTIVES 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 62 3.1 MEANING OF ‘DOCUMENT’ 3.2 TYPES OF A DOCUMENT 3.3 PROOF OF CONTENTS OF A DOUCMENT 4.0 CONCLUSION 5.0 SUMMARY 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT 7.0 REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS 1.0 INTRODUCTION Documentary evidence is one of the important ways of proving the facts of a case in the court.
It is evidence by way of a document and its arises where a party informs himself by reading some permanent visible document as when you write a Law Report like All Nigeria Law Report, All England Report etc.
In this Unit, you shall learn about the provisions which the Evidence Act has made regarding it.
2.0 OBJECTIVE When you have studied this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Understand the concept of documentary evidence 2.
Define the term document and describe its different types 3.
Understand the modes of proof.
3.0 MIAN CONTENTS 3.1 Meaning of document 63 The New English dictionary (2000) defines ‘document’ as a paper, containing performance or proof of anything.
Documentary evidence then, is providing or proving with documents.
The Black’s Law Dictionary describes document as something tangible on which words, symbols, or marks are recorded.
Examples are the deeds, agreements, title papers, letters, receipts and other written instruments used to prove a fact.
Technical Meaning Technically, the term ‘document’ includes carvings on words stones, or other materials, and tombstones, plagues, engravings, road signs or posters and every permanent forms of communicating visual messages from some human being to another.
A Will or testament is a document.
In essence a document is everything that contains the written or pictorial proof of something (Seccombe v Attorney General (1919)).
Evidence Act Under this Act, document includes books, maps, plans, drawings, photographs and also includes any mater expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures, or marks or by more than one of these means, intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording that matter.
(Section 2(1)).
It probably also would include Wills (or testament), contacts, letters pictures, accounting records, births or deaths certificates, a device which stores and records the evidence.
You would observe that the term “document” is much wider in the law of evidence.
Even the Evidence Act definition is not exhaustive: For instance a computer printout a document; it is the printout that is a document or the apparatus that produces the printout?
3.2 Types of Documents Documents are of two types, namely; Public documents 64 Private documents Public Document.
This refers to a document of public interest issued or published by a public body or otherwise connected with public business.
It is a record that a government unit is required by law to keep.
Public document is generally open to view by the public.
Examples of Public Documents are: a.
Documents forming the acts or records of the acts of: i.
The Sovereign Authority ii.
Official bodies and tribunals, and iii.
Public officers, legislative, judicial and executive whether of Nigeria or elsewhere b.
Public records kept in Nigeria of private documents See Evidence Act S. 109.
Examples of Public Documents a.
Statute: The Courts in Nigeria take judicial notice of statutes of the federation and the Laws of the States.
See section 74 EA).
It is proven also by production of a copy printed the Federal Government Printing Press.
A By-Law is proven by a copy of the by-law made by the Local Government and duly certified.
b.
Public Registers.
Entries in Public Registers may be proved by the production of the relevant certificate.
E.g.
Births Certificates, Death Certificates, Marriages Certificates e.t.c.
c. Certificate of Incorporation Official Maps, Histories, Surveys and Records Proof of these types of public document is by the production of official copies issued by the official surveyor.
d. Judgments 65 Judgments of courts are public records.
They may be proved by the production of an official copy or a certified copy A document of a foreign court is a public record and may be proven by examined copy or by a copy bearing foreign courts seal.
These are illustration only and do not exhaust the list of public documents.
Prerequisites of a Public Document To qualify as a public document, certain conditions must be fulfilled.
These are: 1.
The document must have been drawn-up by a public official in the course of his or her official duty.
2.
There must have been a public inquiry 3.
The document must be the purpose of public use or intended for public use 4.
The document must be accessible as of right to the public.
3.3 Proof of Contents of Documents The contents of documents may be proved either by: Primary evidence or by Secondary Evidence (section 93 EA) Primary Evidence (section 94 EA) The primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the court.
– the original and physical embodiment of information or ideas such as a letter, contract, receipt, account book, blue-print, X-ray plate etc.
Where a document has been executed in several parts, each part is a primary evidence of the document.
Where a document has been executed in counterpart, each counterpart being executed by one or some of the parties only, each counterpart is a primary evidence as against the parties executing it.
66 Where a number of documents have all been made by one uniform process, as in the case of printing, lithography or photography, each shall be primary evidence of the contents of the rest; but where they are all copies by a common original, they are not primary evidence of the contents of the original.
For purpose of clarity, a secondary evidence includes: a.
Certified copies given under the provision of the Evidence Act b.
Copies made from the original by mechanical processes, which in themselves ensure the accuracy of the copy and copies compared with such copies.
c. Copies made from or compared with the original d. Counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them e. Oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has himself seen it.
Secondary Evidence (section 95 EA) Generally, documents must be proved by the primary evidence (section 96) .
However, secondary evidence may be permitted in the following circumstances (section 97): (a).
When the original is tiem possession of the adverse party or other: When the original is shown to or appears to be in the possession or power i).
of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved ii).
of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice to produce it, such person does not produce it.
In such a case, the court may receive a secondary evidence of the content of the document.
The notice to produce the original document may be served on the party in whose possession or power the document is.
You may also give it to a legal practitioner employed by such party.
67 The notice must be such as is prescribed by law or such notice as the court considers reasonable in the circumstance of the case.
You need to note that there are cases when the court may dispense with notice (section 98).
On the other words, a secondary evidence may be given in certain case without the requirement of notice.
The Court, without notice to the adverse person or person in possession of an original document permit a secondary evidence in the following cases: a.
When the document to be proved is itself a notice b.
When from the nature of the case the adverse party must know that he will be required to produce it c. When it appears or is proved that the adverse party has obtained possession of the original by fraud or force d. When the adverse party or his agent has the original in court e. When the adverse or his agent has admitted the loss of the document The Court may also dispense with the notice in any other case in which it thinks fit to do so.
Other circumstances, in which the court would admit secondary evidence include (b).
When the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest (Here, the written admission is admissible).
(c ).
When the original has been destroyed or lost and in the latter case all possible search has been made for it.
(where this is the case, you are permitted to give a secondary evidence of the contents of the document) (d).
When the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable.
(e).
When the original is a public document within the meaning of section 108 of the Evidence Act.
Here also, any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible.
68 (f).
when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by the Evidence Act or by any other law in force in Nigeria to be given.
(Here, the court may admit a certified copy of the documents, it may require any other kind of secondary evidence) (g).
When the original consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collections.
In these circumstances, also a certified copy of the document, but no other kind of secondary evidence is admissible.
Evidence may also be given as to the general result of the documents by any person, who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.
(h).
When the document is an entry in a banker’s book.
In all other cases, documents must be proved by primary evidence – that is to say, by producing the original document.
If a document is in the possession of the prosecution or plaintiff (Complainant) who wishes to prove ithe or she must make the document available in the court and accessible to the other party.
On the other hand if the document is in the hand of the opposite party; The document must be disclosed to the other party If it has not been so discovered, the party wishing to prove it shall give the adversary party notice to produce it is provided by law as the court may consider reasonable.
Proof of Document (Proof of Execution of Documents – ss 100-108) Contents by a document may be proved by any of the following: .
the maker or author of the document .
the executor of or signatory to the document .
the person who signed the document as a witness 69 .
a person who can identify the signature on the document or attesting witness .
the person who has lawful custody or content of the document .
the person who procures the certified time copy of a public document.
A little more evidence is required where the document is private.
In such a case it requires also to be proved: .
that the person who claims to be the maker or author is in fact the maker or author .
that the signature or handwriting on the document belongs to the person claiming it.
The Evidence Act lays down how to prove the identify of a person or an handwriting as you shall see later.
But note that any statement made by a person interested at a time when a proceeding is pending or anticipated involving a dispute or any fact which the statement may tend to establish is not admissible as evidence.
Private document (section 110) All documents other than public documents are private documents.
They include: .
documents emanating from private persons .
documents emanating from a public official in his private capacity The letters you write are private documents, not public Documentary and Real evidence compared.
You will recall that real evidence derives from “res” meaning “a thing”.
A document is of course a ‘a thing’.
Both are physical objects, but they serve different purposes.
A physical objects, is a real evidence if it is brought before the court for purpose of viewing it.
70 X is charged for wounding Y with a sharp knife.
Having laid the necessary foundation, the Police tenders a knife purporting that it is the instrument by which the wound was inflicted on Y.
The purpose of showing the knife in court is for the court to view it for itself.
It is a primary evidence and its admissibility in evidence depends on relevancy.
H and W are disputing the ownership of a parcel of land.
W brings before the court a certificate of occupancy for the court to see.
The certificate of occupancy speaks of itself and evidence of its validity but not of its contents.
If a divorce suit, W seeks to tender in evidence a letter which H had one time written to her; the letter is document it tells of itself that H is the writer, but it is still necessary for W to prove that the contents are done.
Sometimes it is different to distinguish whether an object as a real evidence or a documentary evidence.
It may turn out to e both depending on the purpose it is intended to serve.
HK forges the signature of a customer of the Fortune Bank on one leaf for N1 million and the prosecutor seeks to tender the forged cheque in evidence.
If the cheque leaf is being tendered as an instrument of fraud, it is a real evidence.
If the purpose is to dispose to the fact that it tells a lie of itself eg that it was the customer who signed it, it is documentary evidence.
Presumption (sections 4, 114-131 EA) An ancient document is said to prove its own validity.
It is presumed to be what it purports to be An ancient document is a document that is produced from the proper custody and proved or purported to be at least 20 years old.
Such documents do not require proof of validity.
But note the following important factors 1.
Despite the age of the document and presumption as to validity, proof of the truthfulness of the contents of the document is still desirable.
71 2.
The ancient document which attracts the presumption of validity must be produced from ‘proper custody’.
The test of “proper custody is: Whether it is reasonable and natural under the circumstance of the particular case to expect that they should have been in the place where they were actually found.
4.0 CONCLUSION The word “document” has a wider connotation in law than in normal every day speech.
In law, carvings on wood, stones or other materials like tom stones are documents.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you learned what document manes in law.
It includes engravings and road signs.
Documents may be public or private; and may be proved by primary, secondary evidence and presumptions.

Each class has its rule and method of proof or disproof.
Hence it is important that you are able to distinguish one from the other.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Explain the terms: Fact Fact in issue Fact relevant to fact in issue Fact relevant to fact relevant to fact in issue 2.
Distinguish one from the other 3.
Explain Relevant facts and classes or types 73 4.
Illustrates irrelevant fact 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 Fact A fact includes: a.
Anything, state of things, or relations of things, capable of being perceived by the senses b.
Any mental condition of which any person is conscious Section 2, Evidence Act A fact is: .
something that actually exists, an aspect of reality .
an actual or alleged event or circumstance, as distinguished from its legal effect, consequence or interpretation Black Law Dictionary .
any act or condition or thing, assumed (for the moment) as happening or existing –(Wigmore) A fact may be: .
be the result of one or more fact .
consist of a series of facts in which case, Fact may: Either be a part of the transaction (Constituent fact) or Accompany and explain it (Accompany fact) Neither definition helps you to identify or distinguish fact(s).
suffice to say a fact is a thing known to a piece of verifiable information.
It may be an event (Actual or alleged), an occurrence or circumstances as distinguished from its legal effect, consequences or interpretation.
74 “All men and Women are mortal” is a fact 3.2 Fact in Issue (section 2(1) EA) This is the fact that the plaintiff, (or claimant) or prosecutor alleges which the defendant or accused person controverts.
In other words ‘fact in issue’ are those facts which the party on whom lies the burden of proof must prove to establish his or her claim or facts which the other party must prove to establish his or her defence BUT which are not admitted by the other party.
The Evidence Act states that fact in issue include any fact, which either by itself or in connection with other facts the existence, non-existence nature or extent of any right, liability asserted or denied in any suit or proceedings necessarily follows.
3.2.1 How do you identify ‘Facts in Issue’ Facts in Issue are determined by; 1.
Substantive Law 2.
The Pleadings.
a.
Substantive Law Criminal cases: In Criminal Cases, facts in issue may be determined by reference to the definition of crime charged and the defence.
Judas is charged with Murder (or culpable homicide punishable with death).
Applying the definition, the facts in Issue is the killing by Judas of the deceased with the requisite intention, to which charge Judas has pleased not guilty.
When in the course of trial, the accused gives evidence suggestive of defences of say: self defence, provocation, intoxication insanity or insane delusion, which the prosecution does not accept, additional facts in Issue arise.
75 b.
Pleading Facts in Issue arise from pleadings in civil causes; but the definition of Tort or other wrong on which the claim is based is a matter of substantive law.
Sophia claims from damages for personal injuries she received when Daramola negligently drove a motor car across her near Eagle Square, Abuja.
The facts in Issue going by the definition of the law of Tort and which Daramola denies are: Negligence Duty of care Amount of damage Whether Daramola inflicted the injury as the pleadings may or may not raise further facts in issue, depending on the nature of defence.
Consider an action for slander.
The fact in issue would be whether or not the defendant spoke the words complained of.
Consider the tort of Negligence.
The fact in issue is whether the Defendant was negligent.
You can see that the fact in issue is that fact which the respective parties must prove in order to establish their claims or defences as the case may be.
3.3 Facts Relevant to the Fact in Issue In some cases the fact in issue may be proved by direct evidence.
In a majority of cases, it is matter of inferences to be drawn by the judges or Magistrates either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact.
In that case, witness tend to refer to other incidents or facts or claims of facts as evidence amounting to the main fact.
All these other facts, which are “in the eyes of the facts in issue that they render the latter probable or improbable” 76 are referred to as facts relevant to the fact in issue.
A fact relevant to the fact in issue is that fact (other than the fact in issue), showing the probability of the fact in issue.
It is crucially important that you understand the term “relevance”, “relevancy”.
You need to understand that: • All relevant evidence is prima facie, admissible unless excluded by law • No irrelevant evidence is ever admissible except only in exceptional • Evidence which tends to exonerate an accused may always be given and admissible Relevancy: Sir James Fitziames Stephens said that the word “relevant” means: that any two facts to which it is applied are so related to each other that according to the common cause of events, one either taken by itself or in connection with other facts proved or renders probable, the past, present, or future existence or non-existence of the other.
Lord Simon has explained further that: Evidence is relevant if ti is logically probative or disprobative of some matter, which requires proof (DPP v Kelborne(1973)) Allen and Guest have added that Evidence is probative of a proposition of a proposition if it tends to show that proposition to be true, evidence is disprobative if it tends to show that proposition to be false.
In essence, relevant evidence must be: - A fact tending to prove or disprove a matter in issue - Probative 77 - Material - Admissible, unless excluded by a specific statute or rule.
A fact is relevant if:- 1.
- It applies to the matter in hand or pertinent to a pint - It is logically connected and tending to prove or disprove a matter in issue, or having appreciable probative value.
- It tends rationally to persuade you some alleged fact (See 7).
2, Facts which are occasion, cause, effect all under section 8, Evidence Act, a fact is relevant if it performs any of the following functions in relation to the fact in issue, or relevant fact.
- If it shows or tends to show the occasion - If it shows or tends to show the cause - If it shows or tends to show the effect.
- If it shows or tens to show opportunity - If it shows or tends to show the fact in issue, relevant fact or transaction Circumstances under which the fact in issue occurred.
In this section, there the evidence might to be adduced and the fact in issue or relevant fact need not be contemporaneous.
Illustration Ishyiaku is charged with culpable homicide punishable with death for allegedly killing Baku by shooting.
The prosecution may lead evidence to show: (a).
That shooting took place on 1st October in Garki during Bankole birthday party.
78 This evidence tends to show the occasion; it is relevant, and admissible (b).
That Ishyiaku knew that Ramatu was found of parties and in all probability would be present.
This would be evidence of opportunity.
That Ishyiaku shot Bako after Bako had teased him; and Marks on the ground showing struggle at the locus in quo are relevant, showing the circumstances That immediately after the shooting Bako bled profusely and collapsed When there is an occurrence, the first natural step is to consider whether there ae facts on hand calculated of producing, causing, effecting, affording the various items of evidence considered relevant and may on grounds of expediency be admissible.
Activity Adebayo brings an action for compensation against Dan Fulani on the death of his son Tunde.
Tunde was found dead with a halter in his hand and under a cow, property of Dan Fulani.
Dan Fulani seek to lead evidence that Tunde is fond of teasing cows and had previously teased the offending cow with a halter; and Tunde’s death is self-induced.
Would you say Dan Fulani is competent to testify - That Tunde is fond of teasing cows - That Tunde has previously liased the offending cow - That Tunde’s death is self-induced When you shall have completed that exercise, read the case of Joy v Phillips and Mills & Co. Ltd. (1916) for the answers.
3.4 Motive and Preparation (section 9 EA) An evidence is relevant which shows or constitutes motive or preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact.
Similarly the evidence is relevant which tends to show the conduct of any party or of any agent to any party to any proceeding in reference to such suit or proceeding or 79 in reference to any fact in issue therein or relevant thereto and the conduct of any person, an offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, if the conduct influences or is influenced by the fact in issue or relevant facts.
It is not material whether the conduct is pronoun or subsequent.
Note the meaning of the word “conduct” in this context.
The word conduct does not include any statement simpliciter unless the statement accompanies and explains acts other than statements.
When the conduct of any person is relevant, any statement made to him or in his presence and hearings which affects such conduct is also relevant.
Activity Uchena is charged with the murder of Sophia by poisoning.
Consider the relevancy and admissibility of the following items of evidence, with reasons: 1.
The fact that Sophia knew that Uchena has earlier committed a crime Sophia has threatened to reveal it.
2.
The fact that two days before the killing, Uchena had bought some quantity of arsenic, similar to that which was administered to Sophia 3.
The fact that Uchena has had two previous police records for violence 4.
The fact that Uchena absconded after Sophia’s death 5.
That Uchena attempted to bribe the Police detective who carried out initial investigation 6.
That ten minutes after taking some brandy in Uchena’s house, Sophia complained bitterly of stomach upset, was rolling on the ground and shouting that she was in serious pain.
4.0 CONCLUSION 80 A fact is a thing known to have happened.
The fact in issue refers to the truth of the matter, the mensrea and the overt act constituting the crime or claim, it is ascertained by reference to substantive law and pleadings.
It is the central crux of the whole proceedings - that thing which you must prove for you to succeed in the mater.
Fact relevant to the fact in issue is that fact which is in extricable connected to the fact in issue.
Evidence which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for a fact in issue or relevant fact is also relevant.
5.0 CONCLUSION You have learned to define fact, fact in issue, relevancy, and relevant fact and you can differentiate one form the other.
You also learned about relevant facts especially those which show the occasion, case, opportunity, circumstances, motive, preparation, introductory explanation etc.
Attention was drawn to the circumstances where facts, otherwise irrelevant become relevant e.g.
fact relating to amount of damage, particular circumstance, state of mind or body etc.
This Unit, dealt with part II of the Evidence Act.

TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT 7.
REFERENCES/FURTHER READINGS INTRODUCTION In the last Unit, you learnt about relevant facts particularly a fact, a fact in issue, a fact relevant to the fact in issue or relevant fact.
In this unit, you shall learn more of relevant facts.
They are important in the Law of Evidence because the man or woman’s mind is very complex and eye witness to crimes or wrongful acts are rare to come by.
At times when accused persons plead not guilty, the Court may yet be inclined to enter a plea of Not guilty and require the persecution to prove his/her case and the defence to rebut or discredit the evidence adduced by relevant facts and law.
Objectives 82  At the end of this Unit, you should be able to: 1.
Determine its given situation, facts that are necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts 2.
Explain the admissibility or inadmissibility of things said, done or written by accomplices 3.
Explain circumstances when an irrelevant fact becomes relevant 4.
Classify facts relevant to facts in issue.
MAIN CONTENT 4.
Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts (Sec.
10) Section 10 , the Evidence Acts permits the reception of the following facts a - Facts that are introductory - Fact that establish identity of a party or person whose identity is necessary - Fact that support an inference - Facts in rebuttal of an inference Illustration Agu is charged with culpable homicide punishable with death for alleged killing of Winifred Dr Chime testifies as to the cause of death.
The following items of evidence may be admissible: - Questions as to Dr. Chime’s qualifications and experience - To introduce the fact that Dr. Chime is an expert 83 - The fact that Agu left Koko Town few minutes after shooting - To support an inference that Agu might have been implicated in the crime - Unrefuted evidence of Agu that he left Koko unexpectedly because his mother was at point of death and he had to be at her side is admissible to rebut the inference that he absconded after killing Winifred - To rebut the inference he absconded after killing Winifred.
- Evidence that Agu were the same dress, carried the same gun as that of the alleged esculent – to show identity.
- The fact fixing the time and place at which the relevant fact occur.
Consider this case.
There is a contract between Jegede and Faruk.
Jegede has sued Dangana for inciting Faruk to breach his contract.
At the time of departure from the service of Jegede, Faruk was heard to say: “I am leaving your services because Dangana has offered me a better job” Question: Is this statement relevant; Can the Court receive it?
Read Section 10, Evidence Act.
At Common Law, a statement is irrelevant and inadmissible against a party if such statements is made behind his back.
Read Section 10 again.
There is no limitation.
In other words such a statement as one made by Faruk is admissible and it is immaterial that it was made in the presence or absence of the accused.
Sec.
10 is innovative and its aim is to let an introductory or explanatory note to corroborate a relevant fact.
It is not to prove any fact in issue.
But in practice, however, it may weigh just as heavily as facts designed to prove the fact in issue or relevant fact.
84 3.
A fact is relevant, if it fixes the time or place at which the fact in issue or relevant fact happened or shows the relation of parties by whom such fact was transacted.
4.
Things said, done, or written by a conspirator (Sec.
11) where there is a reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done or written y any on3e of such persons in execution or furtherance of their common intention after the time when such intention was first entertained by anyone of them is a relevant fact as against each of them believed to be so conspiring as will for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.
But statement made by individual conspirators as to measures taken in the execution or furtherance of any such common intention are not deemed to be relevant as such as against any conspirators except those by whom or in whose presence such statements are made.
In this context, evidence of acts or statements deemed to be relevant may only be received after the court is satisfied, prima facie, that evidence of conspiracy already exists.
Look at the case of Police v Balogun (1953), A, B and C were charged with conspiracy to steal some bags of cement.
B and C made statements to the Police implicating A and in A’s absence.
There was other evidence that A was a party to the conspiracy.
Held: (1) The statements made by B and C in A’s absence was not admissible against A but against B and C. (2) The other acts or things done by B and C are admissible against all three if they were done in furtherance of their common intention.
This is a confirmation that a fact is relevant if it is a thing said or done or written by way f the conspirators’ execution or furtherance of a common intention.
3.2 A fact, which is not otherwise relevant may be relevant.
Facts, not otherwise relevant are relevant if: (a) It is inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact 85 (b) It is by itself or in connection with others facts, it makes the existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact probable or improbable (section 12 EA).
Illustration Giwa is charged with murder of Bolarinwa at Ibadan on July 12, between 9a.m.
and 12 noon.
The following items of evidence may be relevant.
- The fact that Giwa was at Ibadan on the relevant day.
To show opportunity.
- The fact that although Giwa was in deed at Ibadan on the relevant day, he did not arrive there until 5 p.m. : To show improbability that Giwa murdered Bolarinwa that day between 9 a.m. and 12 noon.
5.
Other circumstances when a fact, not otherwise relevant becomes relevant( section 13 EA).
(a) Where the fact will enable the court to determine the amount of damages, which it ought to award in a proceeding in which damages are claimed.
(b) Where the fact tends t show how in particular instances, a matter alleged to be a custom in understood and acted upon by persons interested.
6.
Fact showing existence of state of mind (section 16 EA) .
Evidence showing the existence of a states of mind or of the body or bodily feelings is relevant.
Examples are facts tending to show an intention, knowledge, good faith (or bad fault), negligence, rashness, ill-will or good will towards any particular person.
To be relevant, the existence of any such states, mind, body, or bodily feeling must either be in issue or relevant Furthermore, the fact must show that the state of mind exists not generally but in reference to the particular matter in question.
Quare, what is “state of mind” 86 State of mind probably refers to ones mental process and this can be of various shapes depicting: intention, knowledge, good faith, bad faith, ill-will, good will, rashness or negligence.
Illustration Boniface attempts to break into a house; sees policemen on patrol; he withdraw.
A week later, he returns breaks in, arrested and charged.
Question, can the persecution adduce evidence of the first attempt and the trial of his subsequent crime.
Yes, he can.
Illustration II Abu is charged with killing Dick, by shooting, Abu’s defence was accident.
Parties may proceed to call in evidence, - The fact that Abu had earlier attempted to kill Dick: To show intention to kill, - To prove knowledge that the shooting would lead to death, or to show evidence of ill-will towards Dick The Fact that an Accounts Clerk knowingly utters a forged cheque is evidence form which an intention to defraud may be inferred just as complaints of pains evidences bodily feeling.
What about the fact that Moyo could not gave any answer to a simple question?
What does that show or tend to show?
Illustration of Facts relevant to the Issue.
The court may admit the following evidence of facts relevant to the issue.
Evidence of: Pharmacist: Evidence that Judas, bought poison from him, Witness: Production in court of Receipt issued by Kato (deceased) acknowledge the receipt of a fee for instructing Judas on use of Poison (exception to Hearsay).
87 Dogo’s letter, showing motive.
Police evidence that Poison was found on him Attempt to explain (1) The type of evidence in each case (2) Jurisdiction for reception of the evidence 3.3 Classes of facts relevant to facts in issue.
The following are examples of facts relevant to prove circumstantially another fact:- 1.
Previous and Subsequent existence of fact Existence of a fact in issue may be shown by proving its previous existence at a reasonable proximate date, there being a probability that certain conditions and relations continue.
This is a presumption of fact (praesumptioneshominis) – provisional presumptions – which guides the court in deciding whether or not it should infer the fact in issue from it section 149 EA).
Examples.
Presumption of continuance; That things, circumstances or position, once proved to have existed at a certain date, continues to exist in such a state on condition for a reasonable time e.g.
human life, sanity, insanity, marriage, partnership.
Presumption of continuance may operate retroactively.
For example, the fact that a ship is lost within a short time of sailing may lead to the influence that the ship was at initio unseaworthy Res ipsa loquitur (the things speaks for itself).
The fact that D had control of the thing being caused the accident may lead to an influence of negligence.
Evidence of Scienter.
88 A person found in possession of recently stolen goods may either be the thief or the receiver.
2.
Other classes of relevant facts includes - Course of Business - Habits - Standard of Comparison - Acting in a capacity - Title - State of mind Knowledge Intention Bona fide; Mala fide - Complaint - Conduct and statement of third persons You should consult any standard text book for illustration of each of the above.
Activity Look at this ease: In September, Judas went to a pharmacy and bought some poison.
In December, Judas took lessons of instruction on a flee from Kato on how to use different kinds of poison.
Kato issued a receipt and has since died.
Harrison, who is Judas uncle has just written his Will bequeathing part of his vast property to Judas.
Dogo got a wind of it and wrote to Judas what he stands to 89 gain on Harrison’s death.
Few days later, Harrison died of poison and Judas is arrested and when searched, poison was found in him.
Judas charged with murder of Harrison, by poisoning.
Dick out (1) Judas denies the charge in its entirety.
Facts in issue (2) Facts relevant to issue.
Fact in issue - Whether Judas killed Harrison by poisoning - Whether Judas had requisite interest at the material time.
- Other facts arising from the nature of defence, if any 3.4 Irrelevant Evidence Generally Irrelevant evidence are inadmissible.
Examples are: - Statement made out of court and in the absence of a party - Things done behind a party - the character of the parties (sections 68-69 EA) - Opinion evidence (section 66 EA) - A party’s conduct in other transaction or on other occasion.
In exceptional cases, however, such irrelevant evidence may be admitted.
The reason why irrelevant evidence are excluded are: - To discourse protracted litigation - Public Policy 4.0 CONCLUSION A fact is a thing known to have happened.
The fact in issue refer to the truth of the matter, the mensrea and the overt act constituting the crime or claim, it is ascertained by reference to 90 substantial land and pleadings.
It is the central crux of the whole proceedings - that thing which you must prove for you to succeed in the mater.
Fact relevant to the fact in issue is that fact which is in extricable connected to the fact in issue.
It is that from which the inference of fact in issue can be drawn.
Evidence that parties stayed in an hotel as man and wife and had exclusive possession of a room undisturbed may give rise to an inference of adultery.
Notice a of fact – fact relevant to a fact which is relevant to the fact in issue and fact, through and forth categories through not in issue, and are of relevant to the act in issue may become relevant.
Example is the fact which do affect the weight of legal reception, the qualification of expert witness, duress in relation to the of statement.
Irrelevant fact is itself a fact.
It does not assist the court to assess the weight, validity or admissibility of other items evidence.
Statutory definitions of ‘fact’ or fact in issue, appear vague and may not intelligently assist you to differentiate one form another.
The illustrations and case law have been provided to help you overcome the problem.
5.0 SUMMARY You have learnt about relevant facts especially those which show the occasion, case, opportunity, circumstances, motive, preparation, introductory explanation etc.
Attention was drawn to the circumstances where facts, otherwise irrelevant become relevant e.g.
fact relating to amount of damage, particular circumstance, state of mind or body etc.
More about this Unit can be found in part II of the Evidence Act.

They are admissible if they show not only a general resemblance but also such a particular resemblance as to fix the accursed as the actor on the particular case.
Prior to the 19th Century, similar fact evidence was excluded unless it had a particular function.
In the 19th Century, the reverse situation prevailed and similar fact evidence because, prim facie, admissible unless it showed only propensity.
In 1894, exclusionary rule was restored and fact was confirmed by the Privy council in the case of Markin v Attorney General of New South Wales.
In 1946, the Criminal Court of Appeal reverted to the rule of general admission (R. v Sims).
Three years later, 1949, reinterated the general rule of exclusion in NOOrMohammed V R. The House of Lords confirmed this in Harris V DPP.
However, the rules of exclusion of similar evidence is well established and enacted into law in section 7 of the Evidence Act, but the rule is subject of a number of exceptions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this important unit, you should be able to: 1.
Demonstrate an understanding of the similar facts Evidence Rule 93 2.
Enumerate the reasons for exclusion 3.
Indicate the exceptions to the rule 4.
Enumerate the functions of similar facts Evidence 5.
Critique the similar facts Evidence Rule.
3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 The Exclusionary Aspect of Similar Facts See the following provisions:- Section 6: Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as declared to be relevant and of no others.
Provided that a) The court may exclude evidence of facts which through relevant or deemed to be relevant to the issue, appears to it to be too remote to be maternal in all the circumstances of the case: and b) This section shall non enable any person to give evidence of a facts, which he is disentitled to prove by the provision of the law for the time being in force.
Section 68: Evidence of character of the accused in criminal proceedings 1.)
Except as provided in this section, the fact that an accused person is of bad character is irrelevant in criminal proceedings 2.)
The fact that an accused person is of bad character is relevant:- a.)
When the bad character of the accused person is a fact in issue.
b.)
When the accused person has given evidence of his good character 94 3.)
An accused person may be asked questions to show that he is of bad character in the circumstances mentioned in section 159 (d) 4.)
Whenever evidence of bad character is relevant evidence of a previous conviction is also relevant.
Section 159: Competency of Accursed person to give evidence Every person charged with a defence shall be a competent witness for the defence at every stage of the proceedings, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person.
(a) A person charged and called as a witness shall not be asked, and if asked, shall not be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed or been convicted of or been charged with any offence other than that wherewith he is then charged or is of bad character unless.
1) The proof that he has committed or been convicted of such other offence is admissible evidence to show that he is guilty of the offence wherewith he is then charged; or 2) He has personally or by his legal practitioner asked questions of the witnesses for the prosecution with a view to establish his own good character or has given evidence of his good character, it the nature or conduct of the defence in such as to involve imputation on the character o the prosecutor or the witnesses for the prosecution or 3) He has given evidence against any other person charged with the same offered Section 17: Facts bearing on questions whether act was accidental or intentional.
When there is a question whether an act was accidental or done with a particular knowledge or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences in each of which the person doing he act was concerned is relevant.
Section 471: Evidence of Scienter 95 Whenever any person is being proceeded against for receiving any property, knowing I to have been stolen or for having in his possession stolen property for the purpose of proving guilty knowledge there may be given in evidence at any stage of the proceedings: a).
The fact that other property stolen within the period of twelve months proceedings the date of the offence charged was found or had been in his possession.
b).
the fact that within the five years proceeding the date of the offence charged, he was convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty The last mentioned fact may not be roved unless:- i).
seven days’ notice in writing has been given to the offenders that proof of such previous conviction is intended to be given, and ii) evidence has been given that the property in respect of which the offends is being tried was found or had been in his possession.
Activity Read the passages above again.
Attempt to say in your own words what the passages talk about.
Note the following: (i) Section 6 represents the general rule (i) Section 17 is one of the most important exceptions to the general rule (ii) Section 46 is material only for the purpose of proving guilty knowledge and for the fact of receiving the goods to which the charge relates must be proved.
3.2 The General Rule The general rule specifies the facts of which evidence may be given.
The Evidence Act stipulates that evidence may be given facts in issue and relevant facts and “ of no others”.
96 The court, in exercise of its discretionary proved exclude an otherwise relevant fact, if it considers (i) That the prejudicial tendency outweighs its probative value (ii) Evidence is obtained illegally or by some tricks (iii) Strict rules of admissibility would opsate unfairly against an accused General evidence of similar facts is NOT admissible to prove the facts in issue.
Koyo, a brewer supplies beer.
He supplied beer to Haruna.
No complaint.
It was good beer.
He supplied beer to Dogo who complained that the beer which Kodgo supplied was bad.
Kodjo denies and seek to put in evidence that the beer he supplied are good beer and had supplied good beer to Haruna.
Ado obtained N50,000.00 by false pretence (4-1-9-) from Folashade in 2009.
Ado also obtained N20,000.00 by false pretence from Chukwu in 2010.
Again in has been arrested for obtaining N150,000.00 from Fatima by false pretence.
He is charged to court.
Ado denies the charge.
The prosecution seeks to calFolashade and Chukwu to testify to previous fraud or to tender evidence of previous conviction for obtaining by false pretence.
What the brewer and Ado seek to do is to give evidence of facts similar to a fact in issue.
Lord Herschell stated the general rule when he said: “it is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused had been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment; for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely form his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried.” See Mekan v AG (NSW) 1894 Lord Goddard held a contrary view, arguing 97 “if one starts with the assumption that all evidence tending to show a disposition towards a particular issue must be excluded unless justified, then the justification of evidence of this kind is that it tends to rebut a defence otherwise open to the adduced; but if one starts with the general proposition that all evidence that is logically probative is admissible unless excluded, when evidence of this kind does not have to seek a justification but is admissible irrespective of the issues raised by the defence and this we think is the correct view”.
The Privy Council overruled Lord Goddeard and confirmed the exclusionary rule.
In NOOR Mohammed v R, appellants wife was alleged to have died from cyanide poison.
Mohammed was charged with the murder.
There was evidence that his paramour also died of cyanide poisoning.
Held, on appeal, that such evidence was improperly admitted since the possession of cyanide was consistent with Mohammed trade of Goldsmitting.
In Hams v DPP, the accused was a policeman.
On the 7th occasion, the authorities were enraged and planned a trap to arrest him.
An alarm went off; Hams was seen on the 8th occasion, moving away from the scene of the breaking at the approach of detectives.

Harms had concealed it in the interval.
He was charged with theft and convicted.
The House of Lord, held that the evidence of the previous seven breakings were wrongly admitted.
The reason was that Harm’s has not been specifically connected with the theft on the previous occasions but merely suspected and therefore entitled to acquittal.
Kate stole office property, Sule murdered the Accountant, Yusuf burgled the Pilots house and robbed.
Kate, Sule and Yusuf have a general resemblance: each of them is a criminal and a gad man.
The Police have arrested Duru and charged him to court for obtaining money under false practice (4-1-9).
Three years also Duru, by false pretence deprived Adamu of ear which went to prison for 6 months.
Kene stole a box of trinket.
Last year, Kene committed house breaking.
Three examples are similar facts evidence.
Each of them shows 1.
Resemblance 98 2.
Propensity that accused either form past or future cause of conduct was likely to commit the defence charged 3.
The bad side of the accused, and therefore likely prejudice and bias the mind of the judge 4.
Irrelevance – merely showing that the accused committed other crimes.
5.
Admission of such evidence would infringe the legal maxism; “Res interaliosacta” meaning: a man (or woman) should not be prejudiced by thing done behind his back.
The corollary of this is that the prosecution should not benefit in point of proof by reliance on crimes committed on other occasions.
If Ado is charged with obtaining money by false pretence (419) from Fatima, it is not open to this prosecutor to show that Ado had obtained money under false pretence form Folashade and/or Chukwu or has obtained money by other false pretence.
3.3 Exception to the Exception The general rule is that Facts in Issue and relevant acts and no others are admissible.
An exception is that evidence of similar facts is not admissible to prove the facts in issue.
An exception to this exception is that similar Facts Evidence may be admissible if: “there is a special connection (i.e.
a nexus), between the facts in issue and the similar facts This special connection or nexus may arise from: 1.
Modus operandi, or system 2.
Common origin 3.
Abnormal propensities Thus, if Kodjo had sought to adduce evidence that the beer he supplied to Haruna and Dogo were brewed together.
That would be evidence of common source or origin.
99 If in Ado’s case the prosecution sought to bring evidence that Ado obtained money from Folashade, Chukwu and Fatima by similar false pretence, this would be evidence system or evidence of modus operandi.
Suppose A is charged when obtaining N50,000.00 by false pretence that his ring is made of gold.
Six months earlier he has obtained N35,000.00 by representing that he had a ring made of gold to sess.
The inference are: 1.
That A is a bad man, a criminal 2.
Conduct shows particular resemblance 3.
That A adopt a particular mode of obtaining by false practice 4.
Resemblance via modus operandi in each case On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to show the commission of other crimes does not render it in admissible.
If it be relevant to the crime before the jury and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut a defence which would otherwise be open to the accuses.
3.4 When Similar Facts Evidence is Relevant and Admissible Evidence of similar facts are generally irrelevant and inadmissible.
There are exceptions, which may be subject to the discretion of the judge to reject it where its judicial effect outweigh its relevance similar facts evidence as we shall see in the next unit is relevant to:- 1.
Evidence which tents to rebut a defence of accident or mistake were the fact in issue is alleged crime or tort involving guilty knowledge or intention.
In R v Geering (1849), G was charged with murder of her husband by administering arsenic poison.
The prosecution to call evidence showing that: - G cover for him and gave him his food.
Her two sons who lived with her hand died of arsenic poisoning - Her third son had taken ill form the same arsenic substance 100 The defence substance objected but the court overruled.
Admitting the evidence, the court explained that it tended to show that the death of accused’s husband had not occurred by mere accident but by deliberate design.
Zakari advertises falsely that he carries on trade as a dairyman and famer and obtains eggs on credit from Aremu.
Subsequently by the same devices, Zakari also defrauds Kuku; and Danjuma on different occasions.
The three different incidents are evidence of similar facts, and are admission to prove intention.
2.
Evidence which tend to prove the main fact in issue.
Eg.
When the similar facts are intermixed with the fact in issue as to form one transaction – when the similar facts and the fact in issue form a series of acts done in pursuance of some one design, constituting a continuous course of action.
Usman is charged with stealing Gas from PHCN in February 2011.
There was evidence that he had taken the Gas from the Gas Main, by means of a pipe, for use in his own factory.
The evidence that Usman has been doing so over a number of years is evidence of similar facts admissible on the ground that it tends to show one continuous transaction 3.
Evidence which tend to Establish Identity Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing in issue.
Fact which fix the time and place connecting fact in issue to relevant fact or a party with some transaction.
Evidence of similarity of characteristics, age, photographs, handwriting, opportunity, finger prints possession of stolen goods, special knowledge or skill etc.
Kunle is indicted for murder of Mr. Rich.
Evidence of Kunle’s pecuniary embarrassment is relevant to show that his motive was to obtain deceased’s property.
4.
Evidence which tends to show that a conduct, which may be lawful or unlawful, depending on the intent with which it was done was, in fact, unlawful.
101 5.
Evidence which tends to show that the material found in possession of the accused was possessed for an unlawful rather than a lawful purpose.
6.
Evidence which tends to show a design, or systematic conduct 7.
Evidence which tends to prove knowledge 8.
Evidence which tends to corroborate the evidence of a prosecution witness Similar Facts Evidence in Civil Matters Similar Facts Evidence Rule applies also in Civil causes.
In Hollingham v Head (1858) the issue was whether plaintiff contracted with the defendant subject to special terms.
Evidence sought to be adduced was the fact of similar contracts with other persons, subject to these special terms.
Held inadmissible; the fact that a man (or a woman) has once or more in his life acted in a particular way does not make it probable that he or she so acted on a given occasion.
Suppose P made the same contract D, Y, Z.
The claim would probably have succeeded.
In an action for negligence for performing a surgical operation carelessly evidence that in other such operation, he had been negligent or skillful is inadmissible.
Evidence of identity of name and handwriting may be admissible also to prove execution of a document.
4.0 CONCLUSION Evidence of general resemblance or of general similar facts are inadmissible.
They merely shows propensity, bias and prejudice, is irrelevant and conflictual with the maxim resinteraliasacta.
However, there are exception to this general exclusionary, rule.
Hence similar fact evidence is admissible, when it shows evidence system - when it shows not merely a general resemblance but also such a particular resemblance as to fix the other party as the actor in each case.
102 5.0 SUMMARY You must have been thrilled with the ebb and flew of similar fact evidence.
It is contained in Section 17 of the Evidence Act.
Reference was also made to Section 6, 46, 48 and 159.
The current rule is exclusionary as formulated in Makin’s case.

A fact may also be the result of one or more facts.
It may consist of a series of facts (as in a transaction), part of a the transaction accompany and explain it (accompanying facts).
Res gesta refers to the central transaction whilst the constituent or accompany facts are parts of it – other acts, omissions, incidents and declarations which accompany, constitute or explain a fact in issue.

Define or explain what the term “res gesta” or “res gestae” 2.
Identify res gaesta or res gestae in any fact situation 3.
Apply the rule of evidence which governs res gesta or res gestae 4.

Critique res gesta/res gestae.
104  3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 This antiquated/ catch word, Res Gesta (singular) or res geatae (plural) is Latin expression meaning “thing done”.
The term refers to: – events in issue - events contemporaneous with the events at issue.
- Facts which accompany and explain facts in issue The Evidence Law permits the court to admit words and statements about res gestae.
This res gestae embraces not only the actual facts of the transaction and the circumstances surrounding it but also the matters immediately antecedent to and having a direct causal connection with it; as well as acts immediately following it and so closely connected with it as to form in reality a part of the occurrence.
The Evidence Act did not use the term ‘res gesta or res gestae’.ut seeection 7: Relevancy of facts forming part of same transaction: Facts which though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant, whether they occurred at the same time and place or at different times and places.
3.2 Criteria for admitting res gestae in Evidence Ordinarily res gesta is a hearsay and prima facie irrelevant and inadmissible.
However as an exception to hearsay rule, the things said, written or done which accompany and explain a relevant act – res gestae – is relevant and admissible.
Before it can be admitted as res gestae the fact must satisfy the following criteria: 1.
It must be contemporaneous, directly concerned and explain an event in issue 2.
Accompanying fact must relate to the fact in issue 3.
The statement must be made by the victim actor.
105 1.
Contemporaneity As Lord Normad said in Taper v R. (1952): “It is essential that the words sought to be proved by hearsay should be; if not absolutely contemporaneous with the action or event, at least so clearly associated with it in time, place and circumstances that they are part of the thing being done, and so an item or part of real evidence and not merely a reported statement.” Lord Atkin explained that the statement admissible under the head of res gestae is not admissible as rebutting the accuser’s own evidence of the facts stated, but as evidence of facts within the knowledge or belief of the person making the statement.
(R v Christie, 1914).
For a fact o be contemporaneous therefore, it must be; - Inexplicably intertwined with the fact in issue ad to form part of the same transaction.
- It must occur at the same time as or about the same time as the fact in issue.
- It must be proximate to it and there must be no time lapse between making of the statement and occurrence of fact in issue.
Civil Matters Because transactions in civil matters are long drawn, the requirement of contemporaneity is less strict than in criminal matters.
In Rawson v Hough, (1824) the question for determination was whether the debtor had left the realm with a view of avoiding payment.
A letter written by him during his absence from the United Kingdom was held admissible as part of res gestae.
The reasoning was that his absence is a continuing ingredients of the alleged wrong and the letter written during the continuance of the said absence is regarded as part of the res gestae.
In Homa v Newman (1931), a title deed was deposited.
A memoranda was made more than eighteen months thereafter.
On the question as to the nature of transaction envisaged by the deposit of title deed, the court held that the memorandum was admissible to show that deposit was for a mortgage.
The memorandum was also admissible as part of the res gestaesince it was made during the continuance of the deposit.
106 Similarly in Bryce v Bryce (1933) the question is one of acquisition of domicile of choice.
The acts done and the property acquired at different times and places by the propositions were admitted as part of res gestae.
Criminal Proceedings In criminal cases, the requirement of contemporaneity is strict.
The statements made must be practicably contemporaneous with the act in question unfortunately, decided cases have not been particularly, helpful as well be seen shortly.
R v Beddingfield (1879).
The accused was charged with the murder of X. X ran out of the room with her throat particularly cut saying: “See what Beddingfield has done to me”.
Held: that the statement was not part of the res gestae and therefore not admissible as it was not contemporaneous, it was made in the absence of the accused.
R. v Bang Wegekan (1943) BW was charged with murder.
The principal evidence against him was that the deceased, after he had been stabbed, said: “Bang has shot me”.
There was no evidence that: 1.
BW was present 2.
BW believed himself to be in danger of death The other evidence against BW was not conclusive.
The trial judge held it was admissible.
On appeal, WACA, following Beddingfield, held that the evidence was inadmissible whether as a dying declaration or as part of res gestae.
The appellant court found that the statement was made “an appreciable time” after the wound had been inflicted.
Also See R v Christie (1914): where C was charged with assaulting a small boy and the House of Lords held that what the boy said to his mother a few minutes later describing the offence was not part of the res gestae and therefore inadmissible.
Tepper v R. (1952) The accused was charged with maliciously setting fire to a shop with intent to defraud.
One of the witnesses called for the prosecution, swore that after hearing the fire alarm he heard a woman shouting; “Your place burning and you going away from the fire”.
The witness also swore that immediately after this, he saw a man driving a car away, and that, that man 107 resembled the accused.
The woman had shouted when some two hundred and twenty yards away from the shop, and did no twenty-six minutes after the fire had first started.
On appeal to the Privy Council, the evidence was held inadmissible, not being part o the res gestae.
It is essential that the words sought to be proved by hearsay (e.g.
the words heard by the witness) should be, if not absolutely contemporaneous with the action or event, at least so clearly associated with it that they formed part of the thing being done, and so were an item or part of the real evidence, out with merely a reported statement.
Where the words are sought to be proved for the purpose for identification in criminal trial, the action or event with which the words are associated must be the commission of the crime itself.
This was certainly not so in the present case.
The accused, if he did set fire to the shop, had already done so.
The Woman’s shouts were not associated with the commission of the crime and therefore the witness who heard her shout should not have given evidence as to what she shouted.
You may contrast the above cases with the following: R v. Forster (1846) The deceased had been run over.
What he said immediately after the accident to the witness, who picked him up, that she had been knocked down by defendant carriage was held admissible in evidence when the accused was tried for manslaughter.
You may distinguish this case from Tustin v Arnold& Sons (1915) where a written account of a collision was made shortly after it occurred was held to be inadmissible.
R. v Fowkes (1856) In a case of murder of X by shooting; evidence was admitted of a witness who was in X’s room when he was shot, who said he saw a man with a gun pass the window and exclaimed “There’s Butcher” (a name by which Fowkes was known) Mortimer v McCallan (1840) 108 Z, a jobber, sold stock to M, a broker on account of K, (Ms’ client).
By stock Exchange usages, M would be responsible to Z for payment.
Evidence of a request by Z to M after the transfer had been affected to give him K’s cheque was admitted as part of the transaction of sale.
Accompanying statement and declarations must explain and relate to the fact in issue which they accompany and such that they regarded as forming part of it – not to any previous or subsequent fact.
They are pars reigestae or as often described: part of the res gestae.
Such statements and declaration are not: - Proof of the fact which they accompany - Evidence of the truth of the matter stated - Exceptions to the hearsay rule The statements and declarations are original evidence and must be established independently.
See the case of Agassiz v London Trainway Ltd.
Defendants were sued for negligence and the fact in issue in this case was whether a collision had been caused by the driver of a train car.
A few moments after the collision a conductor said to one of the passengers: “He (the driver) has already been reported for he has been off the rail five or six times today – he is a nar driver”.
The statement was held not part of res gestae and was inadmissible, the reason being that it did not relate to the collision which was the fact in issue.
It merely related to past disconnected acts of the driver.
Milner v Leister (1862) The question before the court was whether C had sold certain goods to B formally or only to B acting as agents for A.
The sale was conditional upon the result of an enquiry made to B who was upon the result of an enquiry made to B who was to give a reference.
There was produced in court a letter written by C to his own agent requesting him to enquire of T as to the credit of C and also of B.
The letter stated: 109 “B is making large purchases for A”.
Held: the letter is admissible as part of the transaction in corroboration of other evidence; but was of itself no proof that B’s purchase of the goods was on behalf of A.
Also in Davies v Fortior Ltd (1952).
H died as a result of falling into a bath of Acid.
Two minutes of being dragged out, he was heard to say “I shouldn’t have done it”.
In an action for Negligence by H’s widow, it was held that this statement was admissible as forming part of res gestae to support an inference that H had been guilty of some negligence misconduct.
In R. v Hunt, exclamations of those present at the meeting and the inscriptions on the flags and banners displayed, were admitted to prove that an assembly was unlawful and seditious.
Sometimes the central transaction is referred to a s res gestae while the constituent or accompanying facts are regarded as “parts of the Res Gestae.
But it is sometimes not easy to determine whether a declaration is part of the res gestae because it accompanies and explains some fact in issue.
Activity Romeo and Juliet are on.
Romeo promised to marry Juliet.
He has broken his promise, and married another.
Juliet is aggrieved.
Romeo denies he broke any promise as there was, according to him, no promise at all but a puff.
Juliet cannot be heard to say there was a promise of marriage.
That is a conclusion of law for this court to decide.
Juliet can only relied on what Romeo said and/or wrote to her.
Constituent facts You would have notice that in a vast majority of cases, central transaction can be established only by proof of: a.
A series of acts or of similar facts e.g.
b.
A continuing fact c. Acts which form one continuous transaction 110 Self Assessment Exercise Distinguish, in the context of res gestae, the following a.
Facts constituting the matter in issue b.
Accompanying facts c. Statements and declarations d. Relevant facts e. Media of Proof 2.1 The traditional view is that statements and declarations which form past of res gestae are admissible to explain or corroborate the fact in issue which they accompany.
They do not prove the truth of what they assert.
In reality, statements or declarations would be explanatory only if they are prima facie time (Nokes).
In such a case, they are actually admitted as proof of the truth of what they assert.
Isn’t that a naked admission of hearsay?
The Schwalbe (1859) is a case of collision between two ships.
In order prove that one of the ship was to blame, evidence was admitted that her Pilot, immediately after the collision, stamped his fool and exclaimed; “The dammed helm is still a – star boarded.” This exclamation was admitted to prove that the helm was a-starboard and to prove it by the assertion of a person not called as a witness i.e.
by hearsay evidence (Philipson).
2.2 Subject to certain conditions the court may permit a witness to testify as to: .
his or her own health and feelings at a given time coupled with the facts from which the condition may be inferred .
any statement made by a person whose health is in issue The condition for admissibility of such evidence of health and feelings are .
they must relate to contemporaneous symptoms 111 .
there are not the cause of health failure or feelings .
they are not past conditions See the following two contrasting cases: R. v Johnson (1846) J was charged with the murder of D by poison shortly after administration of the poison, J appears to be and said he was in good health.
Afterward he appeared to be and said he was suffering.
Held: evidence of his health and feelings are admissible.
R. v Gloster (1888) G was charged with murder of F by an illegal operation.
F made a statement during her illness that G had operated on her, that her illness was caused thereby and what here symptoms had been some days before such statements.
Held: the statements relate to cause of illness and the past and were accordingly rejected.
3.
The person by whom the statement or declaration is made.
Legal writers have argued that it is a requirement of res gestae that the statement or declaration must be made by the victim or actor.
But there judicial authorizes of statements made by non-actors and non-victims that have been admitted as part of the gestae.
In R. v Fowkes (supra).
The statements “Here is Butcher” was made b y the victim’s son but was admitted as part of res gestae.
In Wilner v Leister, an exclamation in the form o “shame” by bystanders in a running down case was held as part of res gestae.
Perhaps it is safe to say as a matter of practice, the court would receive statements and declarations of victims as well as those of assailants, non-victims or non-actors.
Then rationale for admissibility of these statements and declarations in evidence may be explained on the ground that; .
human utterance is both a fact and a means of communication, and 112 .
human action may be so interwoven with words that the disassociation of the words form the action would impede the discovery of the truth: per Lord Normand in Tepper v R (1952).
3.3 Res Gesta: Common Law and Evidence Act.
Res gestae is a common law doctrine and it has consequently been argued that it is not directly applicable under the Evidence Act.
At common law, res gestae are statements and declarations (oral or written) contemporaneously and tends to accompany or explain a fact in issue or relevant fact.
There is tendency to misconstrue contemporaneity as synonymous with facts occurring at the same time and place.
The requirement of contemporaneity may be strict in criminal law but it is less so in civil matters.
Evidence Act Section 7 permits the court to admit facts which form part of the same transaction whether they occur at the same time and place or at different times and places.
The phrase ‘at the same time and place answers the description of contemporaniety.
The other phrase “or at different times and places” permits the admission of facts which may not be substantially contemporaneous as res gestae.
This was the case of Rawson v Heigh and Bryce v Bryce.
In Uzowalu&Nwadialor v Onyia the litigations occurring with different parties at different.
4.0 CONCLUSION Res gestae (thing done) are the event in issue, constituent and accompanying facts which tend to explain the event or fact in issue.
To be admissible, it must be contemporaneous, accompany and explain the event they accompany and perhaps also made by the actor or victim.
The doctrine serves as cloak for admitting evidence which borders in hearsay, and self corroboration which should not be admitted, sane that they have met the criteria for admitting res gestae.
5.0 SUMMARY 113 Res gestae is a common law rule for evidence.
It applies in Nigeria to the extent that it is contained in the Evidence Act.
Section 7.
The decline applies, as you have seen in both criminal and civil matters.

INTRODUCTION 114 It is a general rule that hearsay is no evidence not only because what the other person said is not on oath but also because that other party who is to be affected by it has had no opportunity of cross examining him or her.
But in certain circumstances, evidence of a recent or fresh complaint may be admissible upon the time of an indictment for rape or other related sexual offences.
In this unit, you shall learn of the admissibility criteria of compliant.
2.0 OBJECTIVES When you have studied this Unit, you should be able to: 1.
Explain the term “complaint” 2.
Enumerate the criteria for admissibility of evidence of complaint 3.
Illustrate when evidence of complaint may be admissible 4.
Illustrate when evidence of complaint may not be admissible.
3.0.
MAIN CONTENT The rule as to fresh complaint has been held to apply in trial of an indictment for rape, indecent assault on a boy under sixteen years of age, indecent assault on girl under thirteen, sexual intercourse with a females between 13 and 16 among other.
But it is not in every such cases that evidence of complaint is admissible.
The court exercises considerable discretion.
It is important therefore to examined how the court has exercised this judicial discretion through cases.
3.2 Complaint Ramatu was seen running out of a house, crying.
She ran to her mother, Jumai screaming: “See what Harn’s did to me” and showed her mother smells of semen all out her private part.
Harris is charged with the offence of having unlawful carnal knowledge of Ramatu, a woman without her consent by force, or threat or intimidation.
115 In this case, Ramatu is the victim; also called the prosecuting the accused or defendant; Jumai is a stranger, or a third party.
At the trial, the prosecution seeks to call as a witness, Jumai (a stranger) to testify as to what the prosecutrix (Ramatu) said or did to her.
What Ramatu said to Jumai was a “complaint” – see what Harris did to me......” So a complaint is a statement made by a party to a stranger in the absence of the other party.
How relevant is this item of evidence?
Is it admissible?
Is a complaint receivable in evidence?
What Jumai is being asked to narrate is what Ramatu told her is not that a hearsay ?
- Testimony by a witness who relates not what he or she knows personally but what others have seen that a witness is not allowed to repeat in court any statement (Oral or written) made by a third party who is not called as a witness for the purpose of proving the truth of the facts stated.
Thus if the purpose of the hearsay is to demonstrates the truth of the facts in issue, it is irrelevant and inadmissible.
That is to say if the purpose of Jumai’s narration is to show the Harn’s in fact raped Ramatu, it is hearsay irrelevant, and inadmissible.
Remember Ramatu’s complaint is not also sufficient contemporaneous with the fact in issue.
Therefore it is no res geata.
But if the purpose of Jumai testimony is to prove that such a complaint was laid statement was ion fact made, it ceases to be hearsay.
Ti is then an original and a direct evidence and as such is admissible.
3.2.
Complaint in Sexual Offences.
In the early times, there was the requirement that before a person could be convicted of rape, there must be evidence that the prosecutors raised a “hue and cry”.
In modern times what is required is no longer hue and cry but evidence of a complaint.
This applies in cases of sexual assault, e.g.
Rape, indecent assault and similar offences on females and, indecent assault on and indecency with young males.
116 Since the close of the 19th Century, the Court began to emphasize that the words of the complaint are not to be accepted as evidence of the facts stated.
The purpose of admitting the complaint is merely to prove “consistency of the conduct of the prosecution with the story told by her in the witness box, and as being inconsistent with her consent to that of which she complains.
In an old case of R v Lillyman(1896) the court had the opportunity to consider earlier authorities on complaint in rape and other kindred offences against women and children (including indecent assault and sexual intercourse with girls under thirteen and between thirteen and sixteen).
It then came to this conclusion that the fact that a complaint was made by the prosecutor shortly after the alleged occurrence and the particular of such complaints may so far as they relate to the charge against the prisoner to be given in evidence by the prosecution.
According to the court such evidence of complaints are not evidence of the facts complained of but evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the prosecution with the story told by her in the witness box and as negative consent on her part.
The admissibility depends, however, on proof of the facts by sworn or other legalized testimony.
3.3.
Criteria for Admissibility of Recent Complaint To be admissible in evidence, the complaint must: 1.
Be made at the earliest reasonable opportunity after the assault is committed.
It may not necessarily be made at the very first opportunity.
It may be made as soon as the child could speak to its mother.
In R v Cummings (1948), a land |Army girl was raped.
She returned to the camp in which he lived with other girl.
She made no complaint to the Warden or to other girls.
The next morning, she went two miles to visit an older woman whom she knew and made her complaint to that woman.
Held: complaint was made at the first reasonable opportunity.
Whenever the complaint was made on the first opportunity which reasonably offers itself after that offence is a matter for the court to decide.
Complaint is inadmissible if it was made after a considerable time her elapsed between the offence and the complaint.
117 2.
Have been made spontaneously and not in response to leading, intimidating or suggestive questions.
Such as: who beat you?
Why are you crying?
Or what’s the matter?
R v Osborne (1905) was a case of indecent assault on a girl of 12 years of age.
The questions put to the victim merely sought the reasons for her sudden decision to go home and did not in any way prompt the victim to say that she had been assaulted.
The court and that evidence of fresh complaint is admissible “whether non-consent is legally necessary part of the issue or whether on the other hand, it is what may be called a collateral issue of fact” in consequence of story told by the complainant in the witness box and the complaint I not admissible merely as negativing consent but as being consistent with sworn evidence of the complainant.
3.3.1 Scope of Application of the Rule of Complaint In R.vCamelleri (1922), a boy had complained to his parents of an indecent assault made on him.
The evidence by his parents of the complaint was allowed at the criminal trial.
The Rules of complaint are available irrespective of gender.
3.3.2 the Rules of complaints probably also apply to: - complaints of cruelty in the matrimonial causes matters.
See Fromhold v Fromhold (1952) - charges of violence: See Jones v S.E.
& Chatham Ry (1918) per Bankes, LJ.
- Charges of indecent assault upon a boy under 16 years of age.
- Charges of bagger, with a youth of 19 The court has refused as inadmissible the following complaints - Complaint made on a Tuesday following, the offence having been committed on Monday - Complaint on the day of occurrence as to something alleged to have been done by the Prisoner three weeks earlier.
- Complaint made after a day had elapsed between the assault and the complaint of the girls mother.
118 - Complaint by prosecutrix who has given no evidence and the complaint not being part if res gestae, is confirmatory only - Complaint by a five year old prosecutrix, narrated by her grandmother was admitted by trial judge and jettisoned by the appellate court in circumstances where the client was placed in the witness but by the prosecution but was unable to give evidence.
- Compliant by the prosecutrix, not her own initiative but in answers to questions of a leading and inducing or intimidating chancily.
It is important that you note that evidence of complaint is admissible where: - The prosecutrix does not so into the witness box or give evidence - The consent of the victim is not in issue.
- Complaint and Corroboration In all sexual matters, the courtey must require: a.
Corroboration, or b.
Warn itself of the danger of convicting without corroboration Whether the victims are children and their evidence is unsworn, the law requires corroboration In this regards, evidence of complaint is not to be regarded as corroboration.
The corroboration must come from an independence source.
For example, in R. v. Flack (1969) with his sister was received as corroboration on a charge of incent.
It is for the judge to decide whether or not an evidence of a complaint is admissible: it is admissible: .
to prove the conduct of the prosecutrix at the time was constituent with the story which has been told by her in the witness box.
.
to negative consent to that of which she complains.
.
to prove that the story is not a recent invention.
119 The purpose of admissibility of evidence of fresh complaint is not to prove: .
the facts asserted in it .
corroboration of the facts It is probable that the court may admit evidence as to the fact of the complaint and of the subsequent conduct of the witness.
Thus the fact of a complaint and the conduct of the addressee in causing the suspect to be arrested and charged may be admissible to enable the court to infer the terms of the complaint.
See R. v Wall Work (1928) Contra R. v White head (1928) Generally, however, the court admits the actual terms of the statements in issue.
This is to enable the court determine whether or not it is in the nature of a complaint.
The complaint of a prosecution made not on her own initiative, but in answer to questions in generally inadmission, the mere fact that the statement is made in answer to question, is not in itself sufficient to make it inadmissible as a complaint.
As Archbold explains, the decision in each case is within the discretion of the judge; guided by - Relationship between the questions and - Te complainant (Prosecutrix) - Other circumstances 4.0.
CONCLUSION Evidence of complaint may be relevant in rape and indecent assault.
To be admissible, complaint must be made at the earliest reasonable opportunity.
It must be spontaneous.
The prosecutrix must herself give testimony in the witness box.
Evidence of a complaint is not 120 evidence of facts complained of but evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the victim (rosecutrix) with the story told by her in the witness box and to negative consent on her part.
5.0.
SUMMARY Complaint is a statement made by the Prosecutrix to a stranger in the absence of the accused.
You learnt about the circumstances when such evidence is admissible or inadmissible.
You also learned a number of illustrations extracted form decided cases over the years and the purpose of its admissibility.
Even when all the conditions for admissibility of evidence of complaint are met; the judge in exercising his judicial discretion, may still declare it inadmissible if it its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.
