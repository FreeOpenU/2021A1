1.0 INTRODUCTION Number is one of the foundation concepts in mathematics and it is quite different in concept with numerals.
Numerals are signs that serve as a means of representing numbers.
Number system generally is a technique of representing numbers by means of symbols.
Modern number systems are value systems which an individual number value is determined in daily activities of life.
The history of number and numeration is as old as human history and civilization.
At early civilization people used strokes, pebbles, or notches as a means of measuring the number of goods.
This is done by making strokes on walls, trees, stones or the notches made on a piece of wood to show the number.
The process in which objects of one group are represented and compared with that of another group is called matching.
The process of matching is also known as tallying.
This tallying system of counting is still in use today.
There are different ways that people in different communities use in counting, but what is common to every community is number.
Number measures quantity and value and this remain the same all over the world.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to  explain the term number  discuss natural numbers.
 Convert numbers to other bases 4  Explain whole numbers  Explain integers  Discuss rational numbers  Explain irrational numbers 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 NATURAL NUMBERS All natural numbers are counting numbers that have definite beginning but no ending.
The nature of natural numbers is said to be discrete.
They are usually referred to as ordinal numbers.
When they denote order, the order should be in magnitude, showing a unique pattern of increase or decrease in arrangement at any given time.
Anytime the natural numbers are used to show quantities such as 5 students, 4 cows, 17 cups, they are known as cardinal numbers.
Natural numbers have some properties that make it unique.
Some of the properties include 3.1.1 COUNTING NUMBERS.
They are used for counting in any community and any language.
The process of counting is often done in various groups, example in group of 2 , s 5 , 10 12 or 20 .
Those number group form the number bases used for s s s s calculations.
Some of the groups include, even numbers; they are natural numbers divisible by 2,4,6,8,10,12.
Odd numbers are natural numbers that are not divisible by two, example 1,3,5,7,9,11,13 etc.
Prime Numbers are natural numbers with no factor other than, unity or itself, example 3,5,7,11,13,15 square numbers are squares of natural numbers raised to the second power examples are 4,9,16,25.
Cubic numbers are numbers that are third power of natural numbers, example 8,27,64.
3.1.2.
CONVERSION OF NUMBERS TO OTHER BASES Traditionally numbers can be converted from one base to another using different methods and techniques.
The most common conversion is usually from base 10 to other bases through continuous division with the base in question and expressing the remainder as the digits of the required base in some definite order.
Example, change 86 to base 2.
5 2 86 2 43 R 0 2 21 R 1 2 10 R 1 2 5 R 0 2 2 R 1 2 1 R 0 86 = 10110 10 2 The rule is to start expressing the digits from the remainders, beginning from the bottom to the first one i.e.
10110 .
2 3.2 Whole Numbers Given that natural number is a set of counting numbers beginning from one and the numbers continues without any limit.
Originally zero was not a natural number so there were problems that became unresolved such as 2 minus 2, 3-3, 9-9.
The discovery of zero in 600 AD help resolved the problem in numbers.
This expanded the operation of number system.
When zero is included to the set of natural numbers we have what is called whole numbers.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Explain the term whole number.
3.3 Integers Integer is a whole numbers that do not have any form of fraction associated with it.
An integer is a combination of positive, negative numbers together with zero.
The positive numbers are usually called positive integers, the negative numbers are called negative integers, While the positive and negative numbers are called direct numbers.
In mathematical analysis direct numbers can be represented on a number line.
- 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 -3 – 2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Conventionally positive integers are a set of natural numbers that are written without attaching the positive sign before any of the numbers.
However, negative integers are written with the negative sign attached before then or on top of each number distinguishing the negative integers 6 from the positive integers.
The only integer that is neither positive or negative is zero.
3.3.1 NUMBER LINE A number line is a straight line that shows the ordering property and position of integers.
The line is made up of arrows ending at one or both sides of the line indicating continuity in the numbers or integers.
The number line is divided into equal parts to indicate the position of the integers.
Usually only a small section of the integers can be represented on the line at a time.
There are two strategies of drawing the number line.
It can be drawn horizontally or vertically.
The ordering property of integers is that numbers to the right of the line are always greater than those on the left, equally those to the left of zero are always less than those to the right of zero.
The numbers are usually written in ascending order or descending.
When they are in ascending order they increase from left to right.
The signs used to show “greater than or less than” are “>” = greater than “<” = “less than” 5 is greater than 4, 6 < 7 “6 is less than 7”.
- 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 horizontal number line 3.3.2 ADDITION, SUBTRACTION AND MULTIPLICATION OF INTEGERS In the addition of integers we count the positive numbers by moving to the right hand side or upwards, while the counting of negative numbers is by moving to the left of zero or downwards.
When subtracting numbers the following points should be noted.
a) if we subtract or take away a positive integer from a smaller positive integer the answer is always a negative number.
Example 1, 4 – 6 = - 2, 13 – 17 =- 4 etc.
b) In order to subtract a negative integer from another integer, we add the absolute value of the negative integer to the other integer.
Example 2, 10 – (- 6) = 16 or – 10 - -15 = 5.
Example 3, Evaluate the following (a) – 20 – (- 24) b) 12 – (- 12) c) – 13 – 16 7 SOLUTION a) – 20 – (- 24) = - (20) + 24 = 4 b) 12 – (- 12) = 12 + 12 = 24 c) - 13 - 16 = - 29 In the division of integers, when integers are divided together two like sings give a positive result, while two unlike signs give a negative result.
Example 4.
(+ 15) ÷ (+ 3) = +5 (- 15) ÷ (- 3) = +5 (- 15) ÷ (+3) = -5 (+ 15) ÷ ( -3) = -3 It should be noted that any number that is multiplied by zero equals zero, similarly a zero multiplied by any integer equals zero.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Evaluate the followings.
a) – 9 – (- 12) b) 28 - (- 28) (c) + 14 ÷ (-2) d) – 8 ÷ (-4).
3.4 RATIONAL NUMBERS A rational number is an expression of a ratio of two whole numbers.
It can take the form of V/ or V ÷ Z where V and Z are integers and Z is not equal Z to zero at any time.
A set of rational numbers X include the set of integers as well as positive and negative fractions.
Therefore, the set of integers is a proper subset of the rational numbers.
Example 2/4, 1/5, 12/3, 7, 81/8, - 1/3 etc The scope of rational numbers has no end in both positive and negative numbers and also within each numbers gap.
Example between 0 and1, 1and 2, 2and 3, 0 and -1, -3 and -4 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1. a) What is a rational numbers b) illustrate examples of rational numbers.
1. express the following rational numbers in a) Ascending order – ½, - 3, 4, 2, - ¾ b) Descending order – 11, 9, - 4 – 17, 12, 3 8 3.5 IRRATIONAL NUMBERS They are numbers that cannot be written as exact fractions nor expressed as terminating decimals.
Irrational numbers usually do not have exact values, usually irrational numbers which are expressed in the form of roots are known as surds.
Example 5 √2, √ 3, √7 It should be noted that some numbers are expressed in form of roots and have exact terminating decimals are rational numbers and do not fall in the category of irrational numbers, example √4 √9 etc.
When two or more surds are to be multiplied together they should first be simplified.
Whole numbers should be taken with whole number and surds with surds.
Example 6. simplify √27 x √50 = √(9 x 3) x √(25 x 2) = 3 √3 x 5 √2 = 15√6 Example 7. multiply the irrational numbers (surd) √12 x 3 √ 60 x √ 45 = √(4 x3) x 3√(4 x 15) x √(9 x 5) = 2 √ (3) x 3 x 2√15 x 3√5 = 36 √(3 x 15 x 5) = 36 x 15 = 540.
Example 8.
Simplify 3√50 - 5√32 + 4√8 =3√(25x 2) - 5√(16 x 2) + 4√(4 x 2) = 3 x 5√2 - 5 x 4√2 + 4 x 2√2 = 15√2 - 20√2 + 8√2 = 3√2 4.0 CONCLUSION The above analysis shows that number system is the foundation of any mathematical analysis.
It cut across all discipline, it is used daily by every individual in daily life be it in the home, office, or business.
It is very essential to know the basics of numbers as a means of evaluation of any transaction; this is because numbers help us to measure quantity, price and other variables of life.
9 5.0 SUMMARY The unit has thrown some light on the meaning and scope of numbers, even though the scope is wide and inexhaustive the basic foundational knowledge of numbers will help you cope with the challenges of other courses.
The unit therefore examined the basic concepts of numbers as a means of launching you to study other units effectively.

1.0 INTRODUCTION A fraction is a part of a whole number.
A whole number is called an integer, such as 1, 2, 3 - - - - 100.
A fraction is a combination of pieces of a whole number.
Example a thirty centimeter ruler can be cut into six equal parts, each part will be five centimeter long.
Each of the pieces is a fraction of the whole ruler.
The piece is called one – sixth and can be denoted 1/ .
6 Equally, each centimeter of the ruler is one – thirtieth( 1/ ).
In this fraction 30 one (1) is called the numerator and thirty (30) is called the denominator.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to  define a fraction  identify and discuss the concepts of fraction  work some fractions involving addition, subtraction and multiplication  work applications involving fractions.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 TYPES OF FRACTIONS There are three basic types of fraction in mathematical analysis.
They are proper fraction, improper fraction and mixed numbers.
11  3.1.1 Proper Fraction A fraction is classified as proper fraction when the numerator of a fraction is smaller than the denominator e.g.
½, 2/ , Therefore anywhere you come 3 across a fraction and the numerator is smaller than the denominator it is a proper fraction.
In other words the denominator should be bigger than the numerator.
3.1.2 Improper Fraction An improper fraction exist when the numerator of a fraction is greater than the denominator e.g.
3/ , 5/ , 8/ 2 4 2 3.13 Mixed Number If a number consists partly of an integer and partly of a fraction, this is called a mixed number e.g.
3 + 1/ may be written as 3 1/ .
10 10 3.2 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF FRACTIONS The addition and subtraction of fractions comes in different ways addition and subtraction of fraction with the same denominator and fractions with different denomination.
3 .2.1 Addition and Subtraction of Fraction with the same denominators.
Example addition of fraction 2/ + 3/ 7 7 = 2 + 3 7 = 5/ 7 Example 2 subtraction of fraction with the same denominator 4y - 2y 5 5 = 4y - 2y 5 = 2y 5 12 Example 3 3x - 8y 5 5 = 3x - 8y 5 Addition and Subtraction with different denominators.
3.2.2 Addition of fractions with different denominators.
Once the fractions have different denominators, find a common factor as the lowest common multiple (LCM) as the common denominator.
The lowest common multiple is the smallest number that can be divided without remainder by all the numbers of the given set of fractions.
Example 4.
5/ + 3/ 6 8 Find the lowest common factor, which equals 24.
It is the lowest number that constitute the exact multiple of 6 and 8.
= 20 + 9 = 20 + 9 = 29 = 15/ 24 24 24 24 24 Example 5.
Simplify the following fractions 7/ - 2/ 10 15 The lowest common factor of 10 and 15 is 30 Therefore we have 21 - 4 = 21 - 4 = 17 30 30 30 30 Example 6.
Simplify the following 5y - y = 5y - 2y = 5y - 2y = 3y = y 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Simplify the following fraction a) 2x - 3y 3 5 b) 5m - 3n 12 8 c) 3y + y 4 6 3.3 MULTIPLICATIONS OF FRACTIONS In the multiplication of fractions the numerators are multiplied together and the denominators are also multiplied together to form a common whole fraction.
13 Example 7.
Multiply the following fraction 4/ x 8/ = 32/ 6 10 60 If the fractions that would be multiplied have numerator and denominator that have common factors, it is more ideal to reduce them through division before the multiplication.
Example 8.
Multiply the fraction below.
4/ x 8/ 6 10 The fractions can be reduced since they have a common factor of 2.
4/ x 8/ = 2/ x 4/ = 8/ 6 10 3 5 15 Example 9.
Multiply the fraction below 14/ x 6/ x 8/ 10 7 9 = 2/ x 2/ x 4/ = 16/ = 11/ 5 1 3 15 15 When mixed numbers are given as part of a fraction, they should be all converted into improper fraction before multiplication is carried out.
Example 10.
Solve the mixed numbers below 5½ x 22/ x 5/ .
7 33 The 5½ and 22/ should be converted to improper fraction.
They 7 become 11/ and 16/ 2 7 Collect the fraction together for multiplication 11 x 16 x 5 2 7 33 11/ x 16/ x 5/ = 1/ x 8/ x 5/ = 40/ = 119/ 2 7 33 1 7 3 21 21 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Solve the following fractions 1).

4y/ x 3/ , 6 9 12 8 10 15 5 9 2 5.)
5y/ x 9/ 6 y 3.4 FRACTIONS INVOLVING BRACKETS Fractions involving bracket is usually mixed equations.
This is because it is made up of fractions and integers (whole numbers).
Example 11.
Solve the following fractions with bracket 3/ (y + 7) + 5/ (2y – 3) 8 6 = 3/ (y + 7) + 5/ (2y -3) 8 6 = 3 (y – 7) + 5 (2y – 3) 8 6 14 Find a lower common multiple of 8 and 6 which is 24 the lower common multiple becomes a means of forming a common denominator as follows 9 (y + 7) + 20(2y – 3) 24 = 9y + 63 + 40y - 60 24 = 49y + 3 24 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE.
Solve the following fractions 1.
3/ (4x - 5) – 5/ (3x - 5) = 1/ 8 12 6 2.
4/ (2y + 5) = 2/ (2y +7) – 2/ 5 3 15 3.5 APPLICATION OF FRACTIONS The application of fractions is an illustration of circumstances in real life that the knowledge of fractions can be used to solve daily problems.
Example 12.
A cyclist made a journey of 152km in a total time of 31/ hours.
He went part of the way at an average speed of 40km/h and for 2 the rest of the journey the cyclist average 48km/h.
How many kilometers did the cyclist cover at 40km/h and 48km/h.
Solution Assume the cyclist traveled y kilometers at 40km/h the time taken is y/ hours ………… (1) 40 The remaining part of the journey was (152 - y) kilometers and he traveled this at 48km/hour.
The time taken for this journey = 152-y/ hours …..(2) 48 The total time for the cycling was 3½ hours.
Therefore: y + 152 - y = 3½ 40 48 :.
y x 240 + 152 - y x 240 = 3½ x 240 40 48 6y + 5 (152 - y) = 7/ x 240 2 6y + 760 – 5y = 840 6y – 5y + 760 = 840 y = 840 – 760 y = 80 15 The cyclist went 80km at 40km/hour the rest of the journey can also be determined (152 – y)km (152 – 80)km = 72km The cyclist covered 72km at 48km/hour 4.0 CONCLUSION The above analyses show that fractions are vital in business and daily life applications and should be encouraged.
Therefore it is very essential for you to get involved in solving problems relating to fractions as it can be practically applied in your business transactions and daily living.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we examined simple fractions, proper and improper fractions, addition, subtraction and multiplication of fractions.
Fractions with bracket were also examined to give the you a broad knowledge of the topic.
The application of fractions was also examined for the you to appreciate the fact that this arithmetic can be applied daily in life and business.

EXPONENTS AND ROOTS CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Laws of exponents and examples 3.2 Multiplication of exponents 3.3 Division of exponents 3.4 Roots of Exponents 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading.
1.0 INTRODUCTION Exponential functions are commonly used in business and economics in growth theories.
Exponential functions are applied to solve optimization equations and problems that use time as part of the choice variable.
Therefore, they are used to express functions that grow overtime and the time is measurable through the application of the knowledge exponents and roots.
Exponential functions can also be used to express and find solution to variables involving compound interest, annuities and sinking fund as it relate to business and economics.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  apply the laws of exponents  explain the multiplication of exponents  explain the division of exponent  explain exponents involving roots.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 THE LAWS OF EXPONENTS The laws of the exponents can be expressed by the different use of exponents in different ways such as 1.
When multiplication of two exponents are given, the exponents are added.
ym yn = ym+n 18  Example 1.
52 x 54 = 52+4 = 56= 15625 2.
When a number has an exponent and it is multiplied by another exponent then the product of it is multiplication of the two exponents.
(ym)n = ymn Example 2.
(32)3 = 32x3 = 36=729 3.
When an exponent is to be divided by another exponent the result is the subtraction of the exponential numerator from the denominator.
ym = ym-n yn Example 3.
46 = 46-2 = 44= 256 42 4.
Any variable that is raised to a zero exponent the product of it is one y0 = 1.
Example 4.
880 = 1 5.
An exponent that is a product of two variables it is converted to the first variable multiplied by the second variable each raised to the same exponent (xy)n = xn yn Example 5.
(2x5)2 = 22 x 52 = 4 x 25 = 100.
6.
When two variables that divide each other are raised to a common exponent it is converted to the two independent variable raised to the exponent (x/y)n = xn/yn where y ≠ 0 ; Example 6 solve the exponent (2/5)5 = 25/55 = 32/ 243 7 A negative exponent is the reciprocal of the number to be determined.
Example y-n = 1/ n, y ≠ 0 Example 7, solve 4-2 = 1/42 = 1/ y 16 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Discuss and illustrate the laws of exponents.
3.2 MULTIPLICATION OF EXPONENTS When variables are raised to a given exponent that should be multiplied, the result is the sum of the given exponents.
Example 8.
Solve the equation x4 x x7 = x4+7 = x11 Example 9.
Solve the equation 43 x 42 = 43+2 = 45= 1024 19 Example 10.
Multiply 3c3e2 by 2c2e2 = 6c3+2e2+2 = 6c5e4 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Given the following variables, find the solution with respect to the exponents.
a) y4 x y2 b) 63 x 62 3.3 DIVISION OF EXPONENTS Example 11.
Simplify the following, divide – 12x4y3z2 by – 4x3y = - 12x4y3z2 - 4x3y = + 12x x x x yyyzz 4 xxxy 3xy2z2 Example 12.
Divide the following exponents y5 by y2 y5 = y y y y y y2 y y = y3 Example 13.
Divide the exponent 64 by 62 = 64 = 64-2 = 62 = 36 62 3.4 EXPONENTS AND ROOTS Sometimes exponents are expressed as roots or a product of some root.
This can be solved using the same laws of exponents.
Example 14.
Simplify √y10 = y10 ÷ 2 = y5 Example 15.
Simplify 3√y21 = y21 ÷3 = y7 Example 16.
Solve 3 √(– 8y15n3) 20  = - 2y15 ÷3 n3 ÷3 = - 2y5 n1 = - 2y5n Notice that 3√8 = 2 or (- 2)3 = 8 Example 17.
Simplify 10 x 2y + 6 x y2 – 8 x2y2 2xy = 10x2y x 6 xy2 = 8x2y2 2xy 2xy 2xy = 5x + 3y - 4xy SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Simplify a) 4√ (81x8y4 ) c) 3√(27y12) b) 5√(w15 ) d) 3√(125R6) 3.5 FRACTIONAL EXPONENTS There are circumstances in which the exponents can be in fractions.
The solution follows the same rules of working exponents.
Example 18. y¾ = y¼ x y¼ x y¼ = (y¼)3 = (4√y )3 16¾ = 4√(163) = 4√(24 x 24 x 24) = 4√212 = 23 Alternatively 16¼ = 4√16 = 2 16¾ = 23 Example 19.
Simplify 10¾ = 4√103 = 4√1000 = √31.62 = 5.623 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Simplify a) 161/2 b) 82/3 c) 813/4 d) 1002/3 4.0 CONCLUSION Exponential functions are applied both in business arithmetic, economics and other social sciences.
A good knowledge of exponents and roots can assist tremendously in enhancing your knowledge.
21 5.0 SUMMARY The unit examined exponents and roots.
We began by introducing the concept using simple symbols to assist the you and gradually we illustrated exponents using multiplication, addition and division.
Ample examples were illustrated to drive home the context of the unit.

Here the comparison is made in the form of a ratio that is the fraction which the first quantity is of the second.
Suppose a company has 150 men and 200 women, then the number of men is ¾ of the number of women and we say that the ratio of the number of men to the number of women is 3 to 4, written 3:4 and this ratio can be represented by the fraction ¾.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to  Explain the term ratio  Discuss the increase and decrease in ratio  Explain and discuss comparison of ratio 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Explanation of the term and concept of ratio.
Ratio being a relationship between two amounts of quantity in which one relates to another.
Ratios should be expressed as simply as possible, just as the fraction 8/ can be reduce to 2/ , so the ratio 8:36 is equivalent to 2:9.
36 9 Therefore a ratio is unaltered if the two numbers or quantities of the ratio are both multiplied, or both divided by the same number.
Example, the ratio 5/ : 3/ equals the ratio 5/ x 12 : ¾ x 12 that is 10:9 6 4 6 When we want to express the prices of two books x and y are N720, N960 respectively.
23 Price of x = 720 = 4/3 Price of y 960 Similarly Price of y = 960 = 4 Price of x 720 3 We write price of x : price of y as equal to 3:4 and the price of y : price of x as 4:3.
Conversely, the statement that the ratio of the price of x to the price of y is 3:4 means that the price of x is ¾ of the price of y and that the price of y is 4/ of the price of x.
3 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Explain the term ratio and illustrate it with examples.
3.2 INCREASE AND DECREASE IN RATIOS Ratio can depict an increase and decrease in the occurrence of a given event, or numbers.
If the daily price of a ticket is raised from N60 to N80, the ratio of the new price to the old price of ticket equals 80:60 = 4:3 we can say that the price of the ticket has been increase in the ratio 4:3.
In other words, the new ticket price is 4/ times the old ticket price.
If the daily price 3 per ticket for entering a cinema is lowered fromN60 to N48, the ratio of the new ticket to the old ticket price would be 48:60 = 4:5, and we say that the ticket price has been reduced in the ratio of 4:5.
In other words the new ticket price is 4/ times the old price.
5 The fraction 4/ by which the old ticket price N60 must be multiplied to 5 give the new ticket price of N48 is called a multiplying factor.
New quantity = Multiplying factor Old quantity The multiplying factor is less than one if the new quantity is less than the old quantity, it is greater than one if the new quantity is greater than the old quantity.
Example 1: Umenemi Nig Ltd water wants to increase its water rate of 56k in the ratio 10:7.
Determine the new water rate.
Increased value = 56k x 10/ 7 = 56 x 10 7 = 80k Example 2.
Okewa bread wants to reduce the time taken for baking, of 2 hours in the ratio 5:6.
What is the decreased time for baking?
24 Decreased time = 2hrs x 5/ 6 = 2 x 5 6 = 5/ hours 3 = 1 hour 40 minutes Example 3.
In what ratio should N75 be increased to become N100?
The ratio 100/ = 100:75 = 4:3 75 3.3 COMPARISON OF RATIOS We have stated that a ratio is a relationship, a ratio may be expressed in the form n:1, where n is a whole number, a fraction, or a decimal calculated to any required degree of accuracy.
This is particularly important when comparing ratios.
Example 4.
Express the ratio of 4.10:1.90 in the form n:1 4.10 = 4.1 1.90 1.9 = 41 ÷ 19 dividing the numerator and denominator by 19 1 = 2.16 1 :- The ratio is 2.16:1 Example 5: Find which ratio is greater 7:13 or 8:15 7/ = 0.538 therefore 7:13 = 0.538:1 13 8/ = 0.533 therefore 8:15 = 0.533:1 15 The first ratio is greater than the second.
The first gives the value 0.538 while the second has the value 0.533.
Self assessment exercise Find which ratio is greater from the following 9:16 or 7:1 3.4 APPLICATIONS OF RATIOS.
Ratio system is used by planners, geographers and geographical information system and other forms of surveys.
For map and plans the ratio is usually in the form 1:n. For example if the scale on a map is 5cm to the kilometer, 5cm on the map represents one kilometre on the ground based on survey specifications.
5cm:1km = 5cm:100000cm 25 = 1:20000 Therefore the scale of the map is 1:20000 The fraction 1/ is called the representative fraction.
Note that a scale of 20000 1:16 is greater than a scale of 1:17 since 1/ is greater than 1/ .
16 17 Example 6: Express the ratio 8:13 in the form 1:n 8/ = 1/ dividing numerator and denominator y 8 13 (13 ÷ 8) = 1/ 1.625 :- The ratio is 1:1.625.
Example 7.
If 5 people dig the foundation of a house in 14 days, how long would 7 people take to dig the foundation.
Solution.
Since the number of men have increased it will take them less days to dig the foundation.
This can be expressed in a ratio The number of men increased in ratio 7:5 Therefore the time taken is decreased in the ratio 5:7 What is to be calculated is the time 5 men = 14 days 7 men = 14 x 5/ days 7 = 10 days Example 8.
In a market 2¼kg of coffee cost N1.17 what quantity of coffee can be bought for N1.95 in the market?
Solution It is given that N1.17 is the cost of 2¼ kg.
and N1.19 is the cost of 2¼ x 1.19/ 1.17 9/4 x 195/117kg 3¾ kg SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE (1) If 10 people dig the foundation of a house in 28 days, how long would 16 people take to dig the foundation.
(2) In a market 4¼kg of coffee cost N118 what quantity of coffee can be bought for N295 in the market?
4.0 CONCLUSION Analysis of ratio shows that it is important in all work of life where we need to make comparison of events.
This range from daily comparison of sales, cost, work output to measurement of geographical area, and 26 presentation of such data for human use.
It is therefore important for you to learn about ratio practice the applications of ratios as well.

Variation could be direct, inverse, joint or partial variation.
Variation as a unit embraces all aspects of daily life, as one activity depend on another.
The ability to work depends on our health, energy and other utilities.
The ability to drive depends on expertise, or experience, the type of vehicle and the nature of the road, the degree of concentration.
This unit will attempt to examine some of these interrelationships and their applications.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to  Explain the term variation  Discuss direct variation  Discuss inverse variation  Discuss joint variation 28 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 DIRECT VARIATION If two variable quantities x and y are so related that the ratio of simultaneous values of x and y is constant than either quantity varies directly as the other quantity.
Steps in solving variation problems.
a.
Change the given statement into a mathematical expression involving , where  is the proportionality symbols.
b.
Replace  by k in the new mathematical expression, where k is a constant.
c. Find the value k using the initial values and substitute into the equation in step b d. Solve the problem using equation in step b free of k. Example 1 If y varies directly as the square root of x and y = 12 when x = 4.
Find y when x = 9.
Y  √X …..(1) Y = k √X …..(2) When y = 12, x = 4 substitute into equation (2) 12 = K√4 12 = 2K Find K by divide through by 2 12/ = 2k/ 2 2 K = 6 Substitute for k in equation 2 where x = 9 Y = 6 √X Y = 6√9 = 6 x 3 Y = 18.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE If W varies directly as the square root of V and w = 24 when v = 8 find w when v = 18.
3.2 INVERSE VARIATION When two variables quantities x and y are related in such a way that the quotient obtained on dividing x by the corresponding value of 1/ is a y constant, then x is said to vary inversely as y.
Therefore if y varies inversely as x, y varies directly as 1/ .
x 29 Example 2.
The electrical resistance of a wire varies inversely as the square of its radius.
Give that the resistance is 0.4 ohms when the radius is 0.3cm, find the resistance when radius is 0.45cm.
Let R be the resistance in ohms and r the radius in cm Therefore R  1/r2 ….. (1) R = K/r2 …… (2) where r is a constant When R = 0.4, r= 0.3 substitute into equation (2) 0.4 = k/ 2 (0.3) K = (0.4) (0.3)2 = 0.036 R = 0.036 r2 When r = 0.45 substitute into equation (2) R = 0.036 (0.45)2 = 0.18 Example 3.
If y is inversely proportional to Z2 and if y = 4 when Z = 3.
(i) Find the value of y when Z = 4 and the positive value of Z in terms of y Y = K/ 2 when K is a constant Z Since y = 4, when Z = 3.
K = 4 x 32 = 36 :- y = 36/ 2 Z When Z = 4, y = 26/ = 2¼ 16 Since Z2 y = 36/ y Z2 = 36/ , :- Z = 6 / √y y SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE If y varies inversely as √x and if y = 5 when x = 16, find y if x = 100 and find x if y = 60.
Find also y in terms of x.
3.3 JOINT VARIATION When one quantity varies as the product of two or more quantities, then it is called joint variation.
Example 4, if v values directly as the square of x and inversely as y and if v = 18 when x = 3 and y = 4.
Find v when x = 5 and y = 2 V  x2 /y……… (1) :- V = (Kx2 )/y ……(2) where K is a constant When v = 18, x = 3 and y = 4 then substitute into equation (2) 18 = K(3)2 4 30 18 = 9k 4 K = 18 x 4 = 8 9 Therefore V = 8x2 Y When x = 5, y = 2 V = 8 x (5)2 = 8 x 25 = 4 x 25 = 100 2 2 V = 100 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.

If w = 15 when h = 3 and r = 2½, find w when h=1 and r = 10; find also w terms of h, r. 3.4 PARTIAL VARIATION This is a situation where a function varies partly as the sum or difference of two quantities.
For partial variation there are at least two constants.
These constants have to be found first before solving the question.
For the computation of partial variation the procedures are slightly modified as follows: a.
Change the statement to a mathematical expression b.
The values given together with the mathematical expression formulate two equations, with two unknowns c. Solve the two equations in step (b) simultaneously to obtain the values of the constants.
d. The problem can now be solved with the mathematical expression free of the constrains.
Example 5.
Given that y is the sum of two quantities, one of which varies as x and the other of which varies inversely as x.
If y = 20 when x = 1 and y = 12 when x = 3, find the values of y when x = 6.
Let y = a + b ………….. (1) Then a  x, a = cx where c is a constant Also b  1/c Then b = n/x, where n is a constant (n = c) 31 Substituting for a and b in equation (1) Y = cx + n/x ……….
(2) Substitute when y = 20, x = 1 into equation (2) 20 = c + n ……………(3) Substitute when y = 12, x = 3 into equation (2) 12 = 3c + n/3 36 = 9c + n……………… (4) Now solve equation (3) and (4) simultaneously when c = 2 and n = 18 substitute into (2) Y = 2x + 18/x …………….
(5) Therefore when x = 6 substitute for x in equation (5) Y = 2(6) + 18/6 = 12 + 3 = 15 When x 6, y = 15.

Solve the simultaneous equations x - 2y = 27 7x + y = 9 3.2 SOLUTION BY ELIMINATION USING ADDITION When the method by substitution involves awkward fractions, it is easier to use the method of elimination by addition or subtraction.
Example 3.
Solve the simultaneous equations 3x – 2y = 11 - - - (1) 5x + 2y = 29 - - - (2) Elimination by addition involves adding equation (1) and equation (2) together.
When this is done the term y will disappear leaving only the x 3x – 2y = 11 5x + 2y = 29 8x + 0 = 40 - - - - (3) What is left from the equation after elimination by addition is 8x = 40 the value of the unknown variable x can now be determined.
x = 40 8 = 5 Substitute x = 5 into equation (1) so that the y unknown can be calculated gives 3x - 2y = 11 3 (5) – 2y = 11 15 – 2y = 11 - 2y = 11 – 15 - 2y = - 4 y = - 4 - 2 = 2 43 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Solve the following simultaneous equation by elimination using addition.
1. x + y = 11 x - y = 5 2 Solve the simultaneous equation by addition x - 4y = 2 x + 4y = 28 3.3 SOLUTION BY ELIMINATION USING SUBTRACTION This method involves determining the value of the unknown in a simultaneous equation by subtracting one equation from the other, then determine the unknown variables.
Example 4.
Solve the simultaneous equation by elimination using subtraction.
2x + 5y = 28 - - - (1) 2x + 3y = 3 - - - (2) When equation (1) is subtracted from equation (2) the term x will become zero and therefore disappears from the equation system.
2x + 5y = 28 - - (1) - 2x + 3y = 3 - - (2) 0 2y =26 2y = 26 y = 26 2 = 13 Substitute y = 13 in equation (2) to determine the value of x, then we have 2x + 3y = 3 2x + 3 (13) = 3 2x + 39 = 3 Collect like terms 2x = 3 – 39 2x = - 36 X = - 36 2 = - 18 The process of getting ride of one of the unknown variable is known as elimination.
It does not matter which unknown is eliminated, the student should always start with the variable that is easy.

However at Rayfield 8 exercise books and 10 biros cost N132.
Determine the price of a biro and an exercise book.
Solution: let exercise book be represented by x and biro by y we then have 6x + 12y = 144 - - - (1) 8x + 10y = 132 - - - (2) Determine the value of exercise book and a biro multiply equation (1) by 8 and equation (2) by 6 to bring x variable to the same unit 6x + 12y = 144 - - - (1) x 8 8x + 10y = 132 - - - (2) x 6 48x + 96y = 1152 - - (3) 48 x + 60y = 792 - - (4) Subtract equation (4) from equation (3) 48x + 96y = 1152 - 48 x + 60y = 792 0 36y = 360 36y = 360 - - - - (5) y = 360 36 = 10 Put the value of y into equation (1) 6x + 12y = 144 6x + 12 (10) = 144 6x + 120 = 144 Collect like terms 45 6x = 144 -120 6x = 24 X = 24 6 = 4 Example 6.

QUADRATIC EQUATION CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Solution by factorization 3.2 Solution by completing the square 3.3 Solution by formula 3.4 Solution by graphical analysis 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION A quadratic equation is an equation of second degree, that is an equation in which 2 is the highest power of the letter or letter in the equation.
There are different methods of determining the solution to quadratic equation.
Some of the method includes factorization, completing the square, solution by formula and solution by graphical methods which is first worked in a table.
The student is required to study each of the method so as to have adequate exposure in quantitative reasoning.
2.0 OBJECTIVE At the end of this unit, you should be able to † Solve the quadratic equation by factorization † Solve quadratic equation by completing the square † Solve quadratic equation by the formula † Solve quadratic equation by graphical method 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 SOLUTION BY FACTORS The method of finding solution to quadratic equation by factors requires looking for appropriate factors for the unknown and the integers within the equation.
Example 1. x2 – 25 = 0 The factors of x2 and 25 are x and 5 :- x2 – 25; 48 (x + 5) (x – 5) = 0 :- either x + 5 = 0 or x – 5 = 0 :- x = -5 or 5 x2 = 25 The second take the square root of each side; the square root of 25 which is either 5 or – 5 because (+5) (+5) = 25 and (-5) (-5) = 25 Therefore x = 5 or -5. the answer is usually written as x = ± 5.
Example 2.
Solve the following quadratic equation (x + 3) (x – 5) = 20 Multiply out the equation to form the quadratic equation as follow x2 – 2x – 15 = 20 :- 22 – 2x – 35 = 0 (x – 7 ( x + 5) = 0 either x – 7 = 0 or x + 5 = 0 x = 7 or x = -5 Example 3.
Solve the following quadratic equation 8x2 + 6x = 9 8x2 + 6x – 9 = 0 Find the factors (2x + 3) (4x – 3) = 0 :- either 2x + 3 = 0 or 4x – 3 = 0 :- 2x = -3 or 4x = 3 :- x = 3/ or ¾ 2 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Solve the following equations a) x2 – 6x + 9 = 0, (b) x2 – 5x – 6 = 0, (c) x2 + 9x + 14 = 0 3.2 SOLUTION BY COMPLETING THE SQUARE This involves a process of converting the equation into perfect square and taking the root of each side.
Example to convert x2 + 6x into a perfect square we add to it (½ of 6)2 = 32 because x2 + 6x + 32 = (x + 3)2 similarly to convert y2 – 7y into a perfect square, we add to it (½ of 7)2 = (7/ )2, 2 because y2 – 7y + (7/ )2 = (y – 7/ )2 2 2 Generally y2 + bx becomes a perfect square if we add (½b)2 to the equation y2 + by + (½b)2 = (y + ½)2 Example 4.
Solve the following equation by completing the square y2 - 6y = 27.
Add 32 to each side of the equation y2 + 6y + 32 = 27 + 9 49  :- (y + 3)2 = 36.
Take the square root of each side: the square root of 36 is either + 6 or -6. :- y + 3 = +6 or y + 3 = -6 :- y = 3 or -9.
Example 5.
What should be added to y2 + 6y to make the expression a perfect square?
Suppose y2 + 6y + k is a perfect, and that it is equal to (y + a)2.
It is known by expansion that (y + a)2 = y2 + 2ay + a2 therefore y2 + 2ay +a2 and y2 + 6y + k are identically equal.
If we compare the coefficient of y.
2a = 6 :- a = 3.
Therefore y2 + 6y + k = (y + 3)2 = y2 + 6y + 9.
This shows that 9 should be added and k equals 9.
Then the equation is y2 + 6y + 9 (y + 3)2.
In practice the quantity to be added is the square of half of the coefficient of y (or any other letter that may be involved in example 5 above the coefficient of y is 6, half of 6 is 3, and the square of 3 is 9 that is why 9 should be used to make it a perfect square.
Example 6.
Solve the equation by completing the square y2 – 8y + 3 = 0.
The left hand side of the equation does not factorise, therefore the equation is first rearranged to make the left hand side a perfect square.
y2 – 8y + 3 = 0 Subtract 3 form both sides y2 – 8y = -3 Add 16 to both sides of the equation y2 – 8y + 16 = -3 + 16 y2 -8y + 6 = 13 (y – 4)2 = 13 :- y – 4 = ± √13 :- y = 4 ± √13 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
From the following add the term that will make each expression a perfect square.
(a) w2 – 4w (b) y2 – 7y (c) x2 + 5x 2.
Solve the equation below (a) x2 + 18 = 9x (b) x2 + 10x + 21 = 0 (c) 9y2 + 6y + 1 = 0 50 3.3 SOLUTION TO QUADRATIC EQUATION BY FORMULA Mathematically, any quadratic equation can be reduced to the form of expression as ax2 + bx + c = 0.
The formula for the values of x is often called almighty formula or the formula.
It can be expressed as follows -b± √(b2 – 4ac) 2a Example 7.
Solve the quadratic equation 5x2 = 9x _ 6. the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 is equivalent to 5x2 – 9x – 6 = 0 through rearrangement.
Therefore a=5, b=-9, c=-6.
It can now be substituted into the formula as follows: x = -(-9) ± √{(-9)2 – 4 (5) (- 6)} 2 (5) = 9 ± √(81 + 120) 10 9 ± √201 10 x= 9 ± 14.8 10 x = – 23.18 or -5.18 10 10 = 2.318 or -0.518 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Solve the following equation (a) x2 + 7x = 5 (b) 5x2 – 7x – 4 = 0 (c) 2x2 – 5x = 4 3.4 SOLUTION BY GRAPH Quadratic equation can be solved using graphical method.
In this method the equation and the range for the graph would be given.
Example 8.
Given the following quadratic equation y = 2x2 – 7x – 2, draw a graph for values of x range from -1 to +4.
51 The first step is to make a table, work by rows y = 2x2 – 7x – 2 X -1 0 1 2 3 4 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 2x2 2 0 2 8 18 32 -7x 7 0 -7 -14 -21 -28 Y=2x2-7x-2 7 -2 -7 -8 -5 2 Y = 2x2 – 7x - 2 10 – 5 – -1 1 2 3 4 –5 – –10 – Scale 2cm on x-axis represents 1 unit.
5cm on y a-axis represent 1 unit The solution are at point ‘A’ and ‘B’ It can be read to determine the actual points that are optimal.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Draw the graph of y where y = 4x2 + 6x – 7 for values of x range from – 3 to + 2 52  4.0 CONCLUSION Quadratic equation from the above analysis can be solved using different methods so as to enrich our knowledge of algebra in business and planning.
It is important to use different options in solving the same problem.
It could be in your business or daily transactions.
5.0 SUMMARY The unit has thrown some light on the operations of quadratic equation using completing the square method, factorization.

PROGRESSIONS CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main content 3.1 Arithmetic Progression concepts 3.2 Computation of the nth term and common difference 3.3 Computation of the sum of Arithmetic progression 3.4 Geometric Progression 3.5 Applications of progression 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION A progression is a set of numbers in some definite order in successive terms or numbers of a sequence formed according to a given number of rules or conditions.
The progression at any given time is an integer, a real number.
The number could be positive or negative depending on the circumstance and the question that would be solved.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Explain arithmetic progression  Discuss geometric progression  Discuss the application of progressions 3.0 Main Content 3.1 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION CONCEPTS An arithmetic progression is a sequence in which quantities increase or decrease by a common difference.
The sequence 5, 7, 9, 11 … n is an arithmetic progression since the difference between any two consecutive terms is 2.
The sequence 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23 … n is an arithmetic progression where the difference between any two consecutive terms is 4.
Arithmetic progression can occur in the form of negative integers such as - 2, -5, -8, -11 … n, as the difference between any two consecutive term is - 54 3.
An arithmetic progression can also have a combination of positive and negative integers such as 14, 8, 2, -4, -10, -16.
Given the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, …n the you would observe that there is a rule governing the sequence as each number other than the first can be obtained from the preceding one by adding a fixed number 2.
Each number or quantity in a progression is called a term, the difference between one term and the preceding one is called common difference denoted ‘d’.
The first term in a progression is conventionally denoted by ‘a’.
The terms generally of an arithmetic sequence can be written as, a, a + b, a + 2d, a + 3d … a + (n–1)d. Therefore the nth term of an arithmetic progression is given by t = a + (n–1)d The sum of an arithmetic progression (ap) is given by Sn = n/ {2a + (n–1)d} 2 Or Sn = n/ (a + L) 2 Here L is the last term in the arithmetic progression.
3.2 FINDING THE NTH TERM OF ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION Based on the introduction we stated that the nth term of an arithmetic progression can be computed S = a + (n – 1)d. where ‘a’ is the first term, n ‘d’ = common difference.
Example 1.
Find which term is 383 from the following series, 5 + 8+ 11 + … n. Solution Based on the series the first term ‘a’ = 5, the common difference ‘d’ = 3, the nth term = 383 t = a + (n – 1)d Substitute the variables t = 5 + (n – 1)3 = 383 5 + 3n – 3 = 383 5 – 3 + 3n = 383 2 + 3n = 383 3n = 383 – 2 3n – 381 Divide through by 3 3n = 381 3 3 n = 127.
55 Example 2.
In an arithmetic progression the third term is 10 the 7th term of this progression is 34.
Find the first term and the common difference.
Solution The first term = a, the common difference = d Therefore the 3rd term equation is = a + 2d = 10 ….
(1) The 7th term equation is = a + 6d = 34 …….. (2) Solve the equations simultaneously a + 2d = 10 a + 6d = 34 4d = 24 4d = 24 4d = 24 4 4 d = 6 Substitute d = 6 in equation (1) we have a + 2 (6) = 10 a + 12 = 10 a = 10 – 12 a = -2.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE How many terms of the series 24, 20, 16 should be so that the sum may be 72?
3.3 COMPUTATION OF THE SUM OF ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS.
Example 3.
Find the sum of the first 28 terms of an arithmetic progression whose series is give as 3 + 10 + 17 + … n Sn = n/ {2a + (n – 1)d} 2 = 14 {6 +(27)7} = 14 {6 + 189} = 14 (195) = 2730.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE a.
Find the sum of the first 42 terms of an arithmetic progression whose first term is 3, and the common difference is 7.
3.4 GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION If the consecutive terms of a sequence differs by a common ratio, the term are said to form a geometric progression.
In other words, this is a type of 56 progression in which one term other than the first can be obtained from the preceding on by multiplying or dividing by a constant quantity known as the common ratio denoted by ‘r’ The first term of a geometric progression is conventionally denoted by ‘a’.
The general form of geometric progression is given by as, a, ar, ar2, ar3 ….arn – 1 The nth term of a geometric progression is given by the formula GP = arn – 1 n Example 4.
The third term of a geometric progression is 20 and the seventh term is 320.
What is the first term and the common ratio.
The Third Term = Gp is ar3–1 = 20 3 = ar2 = 20 …… (1) The Seventh Term = is ar7-1 = 320 Ar6 = 320…… (2) Divide equation (2) by equation (1) ar6 = 320 ar2 20 r4 = 16 r = 4/ 16 r = 2 Substitute for r in equation (1) ar2 = 20 a22 = 20 a4 = 20 a = 20/4 = 5 The sum of a geometric progression give that the geometric progression series Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + … arn–1 ….
(1) Multiply through by r the common ratio rsr = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + … + arn ….
(2) Subtract (1) from (2) Sn = rsn = a - arn S (1 – r) = a (a – rn) Sn = a(1 – rn) Used when r < 1 1 – r Sn a(rn – 1) Used when r > 1 r – 1 Example 5.

Ap = 14,000 + (2 – 1) 480 2 = 1400 + (1) 480 = 1400 + (1) 480 1400 + 480 58 14480.
Ap = 1400 + (3 – 1) 480 3 = 1400 + (2) 480 1400 + 960 14960.
Ap = 1400 + (4 – 1) 480 4 1400 + (3) 480 1400 + 1440 = 15440 The total amount for the first four years will be 1400 + 14480 + 14960 + 15440 = 58880 b.

4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Statistics is a process of factual data collection and analysis of the data.
It involves collection of numerical facts in a systematic way.
Statistics also involves the careful analysis of the data collected in form of tables and the interpretation of such data.
It also involves the use of scientific method of collecting, organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing data as well as drawing conclusions so as to take reasonable decision concerning a given phenomenon.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Explain the basic concept of descriptive and inferential statistics.
 Discuss strategies of statistical enquiries.
 Discuss and apply the data collection method in statistics.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICS.
(1) Descriptive Statistics: In descriptive statistics, the data collected describes the situation that existed at the point in time when the census was taken.
It provides a step by step detail of data available and collected at any given period.
The important characteristics of descriptive statistics is that population to be 61 studied are included.
If the University of Jos for example is taken as a point of discussion, the Vice Chancellor should know the number of Deans of faculties, the Heads of departments, the heads of units which are regarded as administrative instruments in the institution.
The Deans should know the number of Heads of departments and other staff.
The knowledge of the categories of staff is also important.
So also does it apply to the Head of department and lecturers who need to know the number of students and the score of each student in each course.
Events are described as they happen and these could be presented in; i.
Bar charts ii.
Pie charts or in pictorial form.
Supposing in the faculty of social sciences, each student is allocated a file and all information required of them is included in these files, a lot of things can be done with the information; If we want to consider the scores of female and male students on statistics, we can draw graphs to represent the information.
If we are concerned with the relationship of individual scores to the averages that have been computed we can change the raw scores to standard score, all of the foregoing operations are included in what is referred to as descriptive statistics.
Descriptive statistics presents information in a convenient format usable and understandable form in words with little numeric included in the description of the data.
(2) Inferential Statistics This is a data collected and used to make inference as related to the occurrence of events.
Inferential statistics which is mostly linked with probability theory, it involves estimate outcomes of events.
According to “Philips (1980) “it is that measure you have gotten that could have occurred by chance”.
Therefore statistics of inference essentially has to do with the measurement of chance.
We usually start with setting up a hypothesis or a number of hypotheses specifying our assumption(s) at the beginning of a study.
For e.g.
we can say that most members of the PDP are conservative in respect of economic policies while ANPP members take a liberal approach to economic policies.
We are able to make these assumptions from selected samples of members of the two parties.
Sometimes this hypothesis may turn out to be true but it may also be false when this happens, it is not possible to generalise because we may not be correct and a problem might arise.
62 This problem has been acknowledged in statistics long time ago and what to do is to make sure we use the most appropriate method and measurement/analytical procedure so that the result we get will approximate the real population characteristic.
Making inferences is a question of chance, however there are methods available for us to determine whether the results we obtain from a statistical investigation could be attributed to a chance occurrence even if its opposite were generally true.
On the other hand we could also measure the odds that the result of our investigation is false.
This will place us in a position to make right conclusion on a particular social or political phenomenon when we do this there is to a certain measure the possibility of the truth or the possibility of falsehood of our result ; we accept to measure or test, the statistical significance of our result.
Inferential statistics can be divided into two namely:  Deductive statistics  Inductive statistics (A) Deductive Statistics: Is the act of drawing inference about a sample using our knowledge of the population.
The process involves arguing from the general (the population) to specific (the sample).
It is deductive inference when probability of an event within a population context is obtained from a prior knowledge of the parameters of the distribution.
(B) Inductive Statistics: Is the process of drawing inference about the population from the sample.
It is arguing from the specific to the general.
Reason of cost, time factor, accuracy and other constraints may make a complete enumeration (census) of the population impossible.
The alternative is the use of concepts in probability to draw a sample from the population obtain estimate of the population parameters and test statements (hypothesis) about the parameters.
(C) Correlation Statistics This is a statistical method that involves a comparison between two events.
Example the first Semester test scores in statistics can be compared with the second semester statistics scores in year two.
In statistics, this study of prediction is referred to as “Regression Analysis” the results of correlation analysis are used to study the reliability and validity of the test.
Correlation analysis is a major part of statistical methodology.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Carefully expain the inductive and deductive statistics.
63 3.2 STATISTICAL INQUIRIES The businessman and indeed anyone who has to administer any organization is concerned with inquiries of many kinds.
Some of these are capable of being treated and tested statistically and statistical evidence can be provided in respect of the information desired in any given situation.
The steps in a statistical inquiry are as follows: 1.
The Problem should be clearly stated It is necessary to know the purpose of the investigation as this will influence the type of information to be obtained.
Suppose the problem concerns wages in a factory, is it about wages earned or wage grade?, does the statistics concern all employees or only (women or men)?, Should lost time, overtime, piece work and bonus payments be included or allowed for?, Should receipts in kind be included in the wage?
The purpose of the investigation will provide guidance as to the exact information that ought to be obtained.
2.
Selection of the Sample In most problems concerning the administration of business, governmental or personal affairs or in making scientific generalization complete information cannot be obtained hence incomplete information must be used and these means taking the sample.
The size of the sample and the sampling method will have to be determined.
The best example of a sample inquiry in business is market research.
3.
Drafting the Questionnaire This is quite a difficult job if answers are to be of value.
Usually a number of questions have to be drafted to get the exact information needed for a given time.
A pilot survey is useful to enable a satisfactory questionnaire to be obtained.
A great deal of information in business, however is already available in form of accounting records, costing and administrative information about personnel, questionnaires apart from market research are therefore useful only for special inquiries.
4.
Data Collection Where not available as administrative published records, the most satisfactory way to obtain information is by means of enumerators or postal questionnaires.
The types of questions to be asked depends on whether postal questionnaires are going to be used or enumerators are to be sent out.
Questions for postal questionnaires are usually simple and easy to understand but those question given to enumerators may be complex: 64 Because enumerators would be there themselves and would be able to explain it clearly.
Enumerators are usually trained on how to ask the questions before they are sent to the field.
They also understand the objective of the research so that they work with a clear vision and focus.
5.
Editing the Schedule Questionnaires require to be checked sometimes coded and calculations made before conclusion can be drawn to picking relevant information from the study.
6.
Organization of Data The items required to be counted or the value summed either in quota or in various categories before they can be calculated.
7.
Analysis and Interpretation Before the information acquired can be used, it is analysed and then interpreted, this requires a sound knowledge of statistical methods and also a sound knowledge of the subject for which statistical evidence has been obtained.
8.
Presentation This might take the form of tables, charts and graphs that will give a picture of the data under study.
The presentation of statistical data helps to give an idea of the outcome of the study.
9.
Writing of the Report This gives the result of the investigation and where required or necessary we make recommendations.
Tables and charts usually play an important part in biz reports such reports are sent to government department, business (biz) organization and private bodies to be used for planning.
3.2.1 USES OF STATISTICS AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION Although statistics is a powerful tool for analyzing numerical data, its application is widely seen in all fields of human Endeavour.
For instance we apply statistics to; A.
Physical Science: It can be used to determine whether or not experimental results should be incorporated into the general body of knowledge.
B.
Biological and medical science: Statistics guides the researchers in determining which experimental findings are significant enough to demand further study, or to be tested more to meet human needs.
65 Thus the physician uses statistics to access the effectiveness of a particular treatment and statistics also helps the pharmacologists to evaluate a proposed drug.
In some fields such as genetics statistics is thoroughly integrated into the field to study the multiplication of cells and other variables.
C. Social Sciences: The role of statistics in the social sciences cannot be ignored especially in business administration.
Accounting, political science, psychology, sociology and economics.
The behavior of individuals and organizations can be monitored through “numerical data” to lend credence to models and theories that are applicable to man.
D. Engineering, Education and Business: The professional fields of engineering education and business all employ statistics in planning establishing policies and setting standards.
The headmasters or principal of a school may use statistics to write the curriculum, the school enrolment, teachers required, the civil engineer can use statistics to determine the properties of various materials and perform some durability test.
The company manager may employ statistics to forecast sales, design products and produce goods more efficiently.
E. Meteorology: Statistical information is also used in meteorology i.e.
the science of weather prediction.
In fact the application of statistical techniques is so wide spread and the influence of statistics in our lives and habits is so great that the importance of statistics can hardly be over emphasized.
There can be a little doubt then on the effect of statistics and statistical techniques on each of us.
The result of statistical studies are seen but perhaps not realized.
In scientific and behavioral research, statistical tools enable success of research results.
In business and economic situations, it’s use is highly appreciated.
Below is the summary of some of the uses of statistics in every day life.
1.
For summarizing large mass of data into concise and meaningful form leading to a better understanding of condensed data.
2.
Giving visual impact on data especially when presented in diagrams and charts.
3.
Enables comparison to be made among various types of data 4.
Making conclusions from data generated in pure experimental, social and behavioural research.
5.
Enabling a business establishment to make accurate, reasonable and reliable policies based on statistical data.
6.
Predicting future events in daily life and business.
7.
For the formation as well as testing of hypothesis.
66 8.
For prediction of Gross National Product (comparing it with that of other countries) input-output analyses, public finance and consumer finance.
9.
For budgeting and planning 10.
Widely used in industrial and commercial dealings as well as government establishment.
11.
It’s knowledge enables one to understand relevant articles in scientific journals and books.
3.2.2 Problems of Data Collection Data collection can be difficult or inaccurate sometimes.
The absence and unavailability of accurate statistical data may be due to all or some of the following reasons; 1.
Lack of proper communication between users and producers of statistical data.
2.
Difficulty in estimating variables which are of interest to planners.
3.
Ignorance and illiteracy of the respondent.
4.
High proportion of non response due to suspicion on the part of respondent.
5.
Lack of proper framework from which samples can be selected.
6.
The wrong ordering of priorities including misdirection of emphasis and bad utilization of human and material resources.
3.2.3 Limitations of statistics 1.
Statistical data or result is only an approximation of the total and therefore not entirely accurate in some cases.
This is because not all the population will be covered for any sample study.
2.
Statistics if not carefully used can establish wrong conclusion and therefore it should only be handled by expert.
Where experts are not available some form of training should be conducted for those that may be required to carry out any statistical research.
3.
Statistics deals only with aggregate of fact as no importance is attached to individual items.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE (1) List and explain the steps of statistical enquiry.
(2) List the uses of statistics and statistical information 3.
3 METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION Business data are collected in the normal cause of administration and not specifically for statistical purpose, however, there is no reason why records 67 should not serve the two purposes and in such cases, care should be taken to ensure that the record is accurate statistically as well as administratively.
The following list covers some of the important methods of collecting data; 1.
Postal Questionnaire This takes the list of questions sent by post, unless of course the respondent has an interest in answering it or is under legal compulsion.
The postal questionnaire is generally unsatisfactory producing few replies and those of a bias nature, the postal questionnaire is also satisfactory when sent by trade associations to the members, since the members have interest in answering it.
Some firms have tired to get answers by offering small gift, this is not a very good idea, since it will produce bias answers that is the respondent tires to please the donor.
2.
Questionnaire to be filled by the enumerator This is the most satisfactory method.
The enumerator or field workers can be briefed so that they understand exactly what the questions mean.
They get the right “answers” and they fill in the questionnaire more accurately than would be the respondent themselves.
3.
Telephone This involve asking question by phones call to the respondent.
Asking questions by telephone is not usually a very good method.
People who posses telephones, form a biased sample.
Telephone interviews are useful for certain kinds of radio research.
4.
Direct Observation This method entails sending observers to record what actually happens while it is happening at the current period, an example of these method being suitable is in the case of traffic census.
Actual measurement or counting also comes under the heading of direct observation, examples occur in statistical quality control.
It can either be participatory or non participatory.
5.
Reports This is method that may be based on observations or informal conversations.
These are usually incomplete and biased but in certain cases it may be useful.
6 Results of Experiments This method is of interest to the production manger, engineer, the agronomist and other applied scientist.
It require carrying out experiments, 68 sample test, laboratory examination to determine the behaviour of certain events.
7.
Interview The researcher asks the respondent the questions listed.
The listed questions provide a guide to what is being investigated.
He or she also fills in the answers.
The researcher now has the duty of obtaining accurate information form the respondent.
The interviewer must barely records facts accurately, all the answers as given.
The interviewer must be sure of interviewing the right person or sample.
8.
Personal Investigation The personal investigation involves the researcher using direct contact with the respondent.
These tends to be time consuming, expensive and limited in size of field, but the data collected will be complete and reliable.
It is useful for pilot survey.
9.
Team of Investigation It is the same as the personal investigation method.
The only difference is that the investigators go to the respondents in a group.
The group can cover a large field than the personal investigation, but it will be more expensive.
The members of the team should obviously be carefully briefed to ensure that the data they collect is satisfactory.
This method is sometimes called “delegated personal investigation”.
10.
Registration Method This method involves the recording of vital events as they are taking place within a given time, vital events include statistics on births, deaths, migration immigration, separation and adoption.
11.
Panel Method This method is commonly used in interviewing job seekers in Nigeria.
Under this method, certain groups of people that are specifically trained interview certain people.
This is to determine the true position of events under study.
Self assessment Exercise List and explain the various methods of statistical data collection.
3.4 SAMPLING PROCESS IN DATA COLLECTION Instead of obtaining data from the whole of the material being investigated, sampling methods are often used, in which only the sample selected from 69 the whole is dealt with and from these samples conclusions are drawn relating to the whole population.
If conclusions are to be valid, the sample should be the representative of the whole, the selection of these sample should therefore be made with great care.
3.4.1 Reasons for Using Samples 1.
It is used in collecting data based on certain characteristics of a group of individuals or objects it is often impossible or impracticable to observe the entire group, especially if it is large.
Instead of examining the entire group called the population or universe, one examines a small part of the group called “a sample” 2.
Even where complete inspection is possible, sampling may have economic advantages.
Resources such as materials, time, personnel and equipments, constitute a limitation in any investigation.
It is then necessary to use the available resources to get necessary information by selecting a sample instead of the entire population.
3.
Another reason for using sample is that for making data, the population is inaccessible.
In any case, the sample chosen must be representative of the whole population as the sample would provide information about the population characteristics, which are being examined.
The population refers to the whole of the material from which the sample is taken.
The frame will consist of a list of all the items in the population or some means of identifying any particular item in the population.
This frame is necessary so that any item in the population can be part of the sample.
The frame must be complete, i.e.
no item of the population should be left out and it should not be defective, because of being out of date or contain inaccurate, duplicate items or inadequate because it does not cover all the categories required to be included in the investigation.
3.4.2 Sampling Techniques.
Some of the basic techniques used in statistical sampling include the following, 1.Random Sampling The word “random” does not mean haphazard it refers to a definite method of selection.
A random sample therefore is one in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected in the sample.
A technique for obtaining a random sample is to assign numbers or names to each member of the population.
Write these numbers on small pieces of paper, place them in a box, and after mixing thoroughly, draw from the box in lottery fashion.
Another method is to use a table of random sampling 70 numbers when the random sample of names have been drawn, interviews or enumerators would be sent to the people to collect all the necessary information.
Although random sampling is a long, expensive operation, it does give a reliable, unbiased picture of the whole population.
This method is suitable where the population is relatively small and where the sampling frame is complete.
2.
Systematic Sampling.
For practical work, it is easier to select every earned item in a list of the population.
This method is termed “systematic sampling”.
The 1st of the sample unit being selected by some random process for instance if the list comprises a population of say 25,000 and the sample required is 500, then the selection of every 50th item will yield the required sample.
Systematic sampling is not random because once the initial starting point has been determined, it follows that the remainder of the item selected for the sample are predetermined by the constant interval (i.e.
50).
In Random/systematic, the samples are believed to be homogenous 3.
Stratified Sampling.
So far we assume that the population to be sampled consist of a single homogenous groups, i.e.
people with the same characteristics where the population is heterogeneous i.e.
comprises men and women in different age groups, in different social circumstances or of different backgrounds, a stratified sample is taken, this is because people in different social groups will think differently from other groups.
In stratified sampling the population is divided into strata, groups or blocks of units in such a way that each group is as homogenous as possible (hence, same characteristics).
Each group, block or stratum is then sampled at random.
The stratified sample would be representative of the whole population.
4.
Multi-stage Sampling.
This is where a series of samples are taken at successive stages.
For instance in the case of a national sample, the 1st stage will be to breakdown the sample into the main geographical areas.
In the 2nd stage a limited number of towns and rural districts in each of the states will be selected.
In the 3rd stage within the selected towns and rural districts, a sample of respondents allocated to each state is drawn.
This may also involve the list in which certain households are selected and many more stages may be added.
5.
Quota Sampling.
To economist and business managers, time and cost is taken into consideration in sample data, for this reason a method of sampling known as quota sampling is extensively employed by many organizations.
The essence of quota sampling is that the final choice of the 71 respondents to be interviewed lies with the interviewer, this of course introduces bias.
The quotas are chosen so that the sample is representative of the population in a number of respects according to the controls chosen.
The interviewer is instructed to carry out a number of interviews with individuals who conforms to certain requirements.
Some of the requirements often used are age, sex and social class.
6.
Cluster Sampling.
In this technique, the country is divided into small areas almost similar like multi-level sampling method.
The interviewers are sent to the areas with instruction to interview every person they can find those who fits the definition given.
Generally, cluster sampling is used when it is the only way a sample can be found.
3.4.2 Errors in sample Data Collection It is believed that the larger the sample the smaller the error.
There could be sampling bias because the sample is too small.
In order to reduce bias, it is being approved that the sample should be large enough to provide a clear information on the topic to be studied.
1.
Errors due to bias Deliberate selection can introduce bias in a sample, Substitution also introduces bias, Failure to cover the sample (not being consistent) introduce errors, Haphazard selection is also prone to errors.
2.
The Questionnaires: In drafting questionnaires, direct answers like “yes” or “No” should be minimal and the respondent given an opportunity to view out his or her understanding.
3.
Memory Error: The respondent may give a wrong information when the event being investigated has taken a long time.
To minimize such errors, interviews should prevent asking questions on events that happened long ago, bringing events that will help the respondent recall would be of help in providing accurate information.
4.
Coding Error: There are circumstances where we may use a wrong code in the process of carrying out a statistical survey.
This give rise to errors in statistical data collection.
5.
Editing error: Some times errors emerge during coding, it entails writing the wrong thing when compiling the result e.g.
writing “1997” instead of “1977” 6.
Error due to tabulation.
Sometimes errors emerge as a result ofwrong tabulation of statistical information.
72  7.
Respondents error: Due to poor education background and illiteracy, the respondent may give a wrong information.
Also because of ignorance or lack of understanding of the context of the questionnaire and sample questions the respondent may give a wrong information.
Error in the sharing of questionnaires.
There are situations where the individual carrying out the statistical survey may administer the questionnaire wrongly.
Example a questionnaire meant for the working class and it is given to the student.
The student may not provide the work experience aspect to the questionnaire.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE List and explain the various methods of sampling in data collection.
4.0 CONCLUSION The analysis shows that statistics is a vital course that we should take seriously due to the wide application of the subject in all areas of life.
It is therefore important for every body to get involved in learning the subject.
The reason being that it will help us in the studies of other course that are quantitative.
5.0 SUMMARY The unit has thrown more light on the meaning and scope of statistics.
The concept of gathering statistical information, the merit of such a process was also analysed.
Sampling as a major strategy for data collection and the likely errors associated with it were highlight and discussed.
In the next study unit, you will be taken through the discussion on statistical data presentation.

DATA PRESENTATION IN STATISTICS.
Content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main content 3.1 Data presentation in tables 3.2 Data presentation using pie charts 3.3 Data presentation using bar charts 3.4 Data presentation in frequency table and graphs.
4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION In statistical analysis information gathered can be presented in the form of tables, pie chart, bar charts and frequency distribution.
The presentation in the tabular form gives an idea of the distribution of the information gathered for further evaluation.
The pie chart and the bar chart are pictograms that give a quick understanding of the statistical information obtained.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Explain the basic statistical concepts with table  Discuss and present data in pie charts  Discuss present data in bar charts  Discuss and present data in frequency table and graphs 3.0 Main Content 3.1 THE PRESENTATION OF STATISTICAL DATA USING TABLES.
In statistical analysis, it is often simpler and quicker to illustrate ideas with tables, charts and graph than with endless written pages.
Statistical tables, graphs and diagrams are visual aids to a quick understanding of information.
Such visuals aid are condensed ideas are more meaningful and comprehensive to readers who have difficulty in interpreting statistics from printed words or who have less time to read volumes.
Visual 75 comparison become important in economic and business analysis, it is also an acceptable norm in modern writing.
It is an orderly arrangement of information showing the relationship between variables.
Consider the following marks obtained by students in an entrance examination.
Example1.
- A’s scores: English 40%, Maths 60%, General Knowledge 80% - B’s scores: English 80%, Maths 60%, Gen.
Knowledge 60% - C’s scores: English 80%, Maths 40% Gen.
Knowledge 60% - D’s scores: English 60%, Maths 50% General Knowledge 80% The piece of information does not make for easy comprehension, however, we can prepare a table to show each students marks under each subject as shown in the table below; Performances of four students in an entrance examination Students Subjects Students Maths % English % Gen. Know % Total marks A 60 40 80 180 B 60 80 60 200 C 40 80 60 180 D 50 60 80 190 Total Score 210 260 280 750 From the table, we can see at a glance the relative performance of the four students, we can also interpret the relative performance in the 3 subjects.
Based on the table we can draw some inferences.
The aggregate marks in the last column shows that “student B” has the highest total marks (200%) while those for the subject shows that the General knowledge has the highest total score (280 marks).
We can state that the students performed better in the general studies among the three courses, and the students’ performance is lowest in maths.
We could not have seen this easily without the table.
IMPORTANCE OF TABLES - It is used to interpret data as shown in the table.
- Data in the table can be used for comparative analysis.
- Quick decisions can be taken based on information derived from the table.
- Information from tables occupies less space.
- It reveals to us at a glance, the information conveyed on the data.
- The data given can be used in forecasting the future performance of events.
76  SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Consider the following information on the performance of some students in the post ume examination.
Matta, English 57%, maths 50%, Current Affairs 81%.
Idoko, English 87%, Maths 79%, Current Affairs 67%.
Dawang, English 69%, Maths 62%, Current Affairs 61%.
Present the performance of the students in a table.
Interpret your findings.
3.2 PIE CHARTS It is a circular representation of data and it is based on the fact that the sum of angles about a point is 3600.
That means a pie chart is a pictograph drawn in a circle to represent relative performance of a given variable in relation to the total value.
We know a circle has a total angle of 3600, the pie chart is constructed by dividing 3600 proportionately.
The information collected for analysis is converted in the 3600 proportionally.
Example 2.
1.
A pure water company awarded contracts to various contractors for constructing a factory house as follows: Carpenter 25,000 Bricklayer 20,000 Painter 5,000 Decorator 10,000 Total 60,000 Represent the above information on a pie chart Solution The first step is to find the total spent on the contract award, the divide each by the total and multiplied by 3600 as follows.
Carpenter = 25000 x 360 = 1500 60000 Bricklayer = 20000 x 360 = 1200 60000 Painter = 5000 x 360 = 300 60000 Decorator = 10,000 x 360 = 600 60,000 77  pie chart showing the proportion of contract awarded to the various contractors decorator 17% carpenter painter decorator 42% 8% painter bricklayer carpenter bricklayer 33% The pie chart shows that the carpenter received the highest allocation from the contract, this is followed by the bricklayer, the decorator and the painter had the lowest allocation.
Example 3.
The following information shows the contribution of a family in the upkeep of their school child in the first and second term at school.
2.
Contributions to a students pocket money Contributors 1st term(N) 2nd term(N) Father 15 25 Mother 20 20 Friends 10 5 Total 45 50 Present the information on a pie chart.
1st Term Father = 15 x 360 = 1200 45 Mother = 20 x 360 = 1600 45 Friends = 10 x 360 = 800 45 78  friends, 80 father, 120 friends mother father mother, 160 The pie chart shows graphically the contribution by the three individuals in the upkeep of the student.
We can see from the diagram that the mother contributes more toward the upkeep than the father while the friends made the least contribution in the first semester.
2nd term Father = 25 x 360 = 1800 50 Mother = 20 x 360 = 1440 50 Friends = 5 x 360 = 360 50 friends, 36 friends father, 180 mother mother, 144 father 79 Using the pie chart, in the second semester the father contributed more toward the upkeep of the student than the mother and friends.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Given the following information on the performance of a student in five courses registered in the university in the first year.
Business admin 86, Economics 72, Political science 52, General studies 49, Accounting 57.
Use a pie chart show the performance of the student in the first year.
3.3 THE BAR CHART It is a chart in which data is presented in the form of a bar and it is used to show magnitude, usually there are three types of bar charts namely: 1.
Simple Bar Chart 2.
Component, Bar Chart 3.
Compound or multiple Barr Chart A bar chart can also be defined as a series of rectangles whose heights are plotted proportionally to the values that are being represented or assessed.
The height of the bars should be plotted to scale to show relative measurement.
The width of the rectangle could be of any size but all the bars must have the same width.
1.
Simple Bar Chart The simple bar chart is the chart of one or more bars in which the length of the bars indicate the magnitude of the data.
Each shows the magnitude of the occurrence of the situation under study.
Example 4: Peace House have the following 6 years projection for those that will attend its annual teachers conference.
Present the data in a bar chart.
Year Attendance Year Attendance 1981 800 1984 1400 1982 1200 1985 1600 1983 1100 1986 1700 80  Representation on the bar chart.
1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 A-1981 B-1982 C -1983 D-1984 E-1985 F-1986 Using the bar chart it can easily be inferred that the highest attendance for the conference is 1986 and the lowest is 1981.
2.
Component Bar Charts A component bar chart shows the breakdown of the total values for a given information into their component parts.
There are three types of component bar charts.
a.
Multiple bar charts b.
Bar charts studying relative value c. Percentage component bar chart Example 5 Sam and Sam Ltd have the following sales of 3 products in the market.
Present the information on a component bar chart 1997 1998 1999 (sales) (sales) (sales) Product A N1000 N1200 N1700 Product B N900 N1000 N1000 Product C N500 N600 N700 Total N2400 N2800 N3400 81  Sam and Sam Ltd company component bar charts for products A,B, and C 3500 Product C 3000 Product B Product A 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 3.
MULTIPLE BAR CHART They are charts in which the component part are represented separately to show the total values.
Example 6, suppose your father, mother and friends gave you N15, N20 and N10 respectively for your pocket money for the first term in school.
The multiple bar chart of this sum is shown below.
Contributions to 1st Term Pocket Money 25 20 father's contribution 15 mother's contribution 10 friends 5 contribution 0 1 82  Here, the total sum contributed by the father, mother and friends is the sum of the height of the rectangle, each portion is represented separately.
4 Percentage multiple Bar Chart This mainly shows relatively the values that are expressed as percentages of the totals.
Although the total contribution for the two terms are different, to construct a percentage component bar chart the information would be represented as 100% their component therefore will add up to 100%.
Example 7.
Given the following information on the contribution for a student upkeep, Father = N25, Mother = N20, Friends = N5.
Present the data on percentage multiple bar charts.
The first step is to add the total contribution, then divide each contribution by the total and multiply by 100% as follows.
25 x 100 = 50% 50 20 x 100 = 40% 50 5 x 100 = 10% 50 30 25 20 father's contribution 15 mother's contribution friends contribution 10 5 0 1 5 Percentage Component Bar Chart This mainly shows the values expressed as percentages of the totals.

3.4 FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION.
A frequency distribution is an array of numbers.
The unorganized data collected during investigation is known as “raw data” You can also arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
The data that is arranged in such order is called an array of data.
Example 7.
Given the following data on the number of vehicles that are parked daily in a parking lot.
92, 78, 68, 58, 45, 89, 75, 68, 58,45, 43, 57, 67, 75, 87, 42, 57, 65, 74, 87, 85, 73, 65, 56, 41, 36, 56, 61, 69,84,32, 55, 61, 69, 84, 81, 69, 60, 52, 32, 25, 49, 58, 69, 79, 15, 49, 58, 69, 79.
Arrange the data in an ascending order 84 Solution is as follows.
15 25 32 32 36 41 42 43 45 45 49 49 52 55 56 56 57 57 58 58 58 58 60 61 61 65 65 67 68 68 69 69 69 69 69 73 74 75 75 78 79 79 81 84 84 85 87 87 89 92 From the array, we can easily identify the highest number as 92 and the lowest as 15.
The difference between these numbers is known as the range i.e 92 – 15 = 77 (The range is the highest value minus the lowest value).
We can still organize the data further because it is not in categories or groups or classes, normally we expect that the classes should be between 5 & 20 or 11 & 20.
In this case we are using 11 – 20, 21 – 30, 31 – 40 etc.
We use tallies to form the frequency table.
Tallies are strokes used for counting and value for 5 tallies is denoted by four vertical strokes and one diagonal stroke (||||) this is to facilitate the counting.
So for the strokes score, we obtain the following frequency table.
Classes Tally Frequency Cum.
F 11 – 20 | 1 1 21 – 30 | 1 2 31 – 40 ||| 3 5 41 – 50 |||| || 7 12 51 – 60 |||| |||| | 11 23 61 – 70 |||| |||| | 11 34 71 – 80 |||| ||| 8 42 81 – 90 |||| || 7 49 91 – 100 | 1 50 50 85 Relative freq.

The graph that results as shown above is called a frequency polygon.
A frequency polygon is a line graph of class frequencies obtained by connecting the midpoints of the tops of the rectangles forming the histogram (the graph of the cumulative frequency distribution is called an “Ogive”.

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main content 3.1 The mean 3.2 The median 3.3 The mode 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION The mean, median and mode are measures of central tendency, showing the average, the central number and the most frequent occurrence variable.
Therefore the relationship between these three statistical variables is very important in the understanding of the unit.
The descriptive statistics is aimed at describing data through summarizing the values in the data set.
One method of doing this is by finding a single value that will describe the general notation of the data.
This single value which is the central point of the distribution is known as a measure of central tendency or location.
Measures of central tendency are typical and representative of a data set.
Every value in the distribution clusters around the measures of location.
The population average which in statistics is called the arithmetic mean is of such measure.
Others are the median and the mode.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Explain the basic statistical concept of the mean and its illustrations  Discuss the median  Discuss the mode 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 THE MEAN The measure of central tendency most widely used is the ‘Arithmetic mean’ usually shortened to the mean.
For raw data, i.e.
ungrouped data, the mean 89 is the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values.
To find the mean for example, we use the following formula; Sample mean ( X ) = sum of all values in the sample No.
of values in the sample Symbolically, it is X = x/ n Where X = sample mean read as ‘x bar’ X = a particular value  = sigma indicating addition x’s = the sum of all the x’s N = total number of values in the sample The mean of a sample or any other measure based on sample data is called ‘A statistic i.e.
A measurable characteristics of a sample.
Example 1 1.
The net weight of the contents of 5 coke bottles selected 85.4,84.9,85.3,85.4,85.0. from the production.
What is the arithmetic mean weight of the sample observation?
solution X = X/ n X = 85.4+84.9+85.3+85.4+85.0 5 X = 426/5 = 85.2 X = 85.2kg The mean weight is 85.2kg Many studies involve all the population values.
The mean of the population in terms of symbols is μ = x/ where n μ = x/ = population mean n N = total number of observations in the population As noted earlier, a measurable characteristic of a sample is called the statistic.
Any measurable characteristics of a population.
Such as the mean is called a parameter.
A sample statistics is used to estimate a population parameter.
PROPERTIES OF THE ARITHMETIC MEAN As noted earlier, the arithmetic mean is a widely used measure of central tendency.
It has several properties which includes 1.
Every set of interval level and ratio level data has a mean.
2.
All the values are included in computing the mean.
3.
A set of data has only one mean: It is unique 90 4.
The mean is a very useful measure for comparing 2 or more populations.
5.
They arithmetic mean is the only measure of central tendency where the sums of the deviation of each value from the mean will always be zero (0).
Expressed, symbolically  (x – X ) = 0 Example 2 Find the Mean of 3, 8, 4 X = 3 + 8 + 4 = 15 = 5 3 3 Deviation = (3 – 5) + 8 – 5) + (4 – 5) = -2 + 3 + (-1) = 0 = -2 + 3 – 1 = 0 WEIGHTED MEAN Masco company pays its sales people either N6.50k, N7.50K or N8.50k an hour it might be concluded that the arithmetic mean hourly wage is N7.50k, found by the sum of X give us the following.
N6.50k + N7.50k + N8.50k = 7.50k 3 However, this is true only if there are the same number of sales people, earning N6.50k, N7.50k and N8.50k an hour.
However, suppose 24 sales persons earn N6.50k an hour, 10 are paid N7.50k and 2 get N8.50k.
To find the mean, N6.50k is weighted or multiplied by 14 (6.50 x 15); N7.50 is weighted by 10(7.50x10); N8.50 is weighted by 2 (8.50 x 2).
The resulting average is called the weighted mean.
In general, the weighted mean of a set of numbers designated x , x , x , 1 2 3 …… x with corresponding weighted, w , w , w ….. w is computed by n 1 2 3, n X = w x + w x + w x ….. + w x w 1 1 2 2 3 3 n n W + w + w ….. + w 1 2 3 n This may be shortened to X w = (w.x) ∑w Example 3 Masco company pays its sales people either N6.50k, N7.50K or N8.50k.
The corresponding weight is 14,10 and 2 respectively.
Determine the weighted mean?.
X w = 14 x N6.50k + 10 x N7.50k + 2 x N8.50k 14 + 10 + 2 = 41 + 75 + 17 = 183 91  26 26 X w = N7.038 = N7.04K SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Bata nig Ltd pay the following to its workers 2000, 3789, 4302, 2118, 5002.
Determine the mean wage for the workers.
3.2 MEDIAN When the data contains one or two very large or very small values, the arithmetic mean may not be representative.
The centre point for such problems can be better described using a measure of central tendency called “A median”.
For ungrouped data, the median is the midpoint of the values after they have been ordered from the smallest to the largest.
There are as many values above the median as there are below it in the data array.
Example 4 Given the following set of numbers 60, 65, 70, 80, 275.
The median is 70.
In this example, there is an odd number observation “5”.
For an even number of observations, the observations are ordered.
Then the usual practice is to find the arithmetic mean of the two middle observations.
Note that for an even number of observations, the median may not be one of the given values.
Example 5 A sample of a paramedical fees charged by U.J’s clinic revealed these amounts; N35, N29, N30, N25, N32, N35.
What is the mean charge.
Solution Arrange the paramedical fees from lowest to highest charge.
25, 29, 30, 32, 35, 35 The median fee is N31, found by determining by the arithmetic mean of the a centre observation i.e.
30 + 32 = 62 = 31 2 2 An easy way to locate the position of the middle items for raw ungrouped data is by the formula; Location of the median value = n+1/ 2 Where n = total no.
of items 92  For example above, there are 6 items, so n+1/ = 6+1/ = 7/ = 3.5. after 2 2 2 arranging the data from the lowest – highest, we locate the middle item by counting to the 3.5th item and then determine its values.
PROPERTIES OF THE MEDIAN 1.
It is unique i.e.
like the mean, there is only one median for set of data.
2.
To determine the median, arrange the data from lowest to highest and find the value of the middle observation.
3.
The median is not affected by extremely large or small values, therefore a valuable measure of central tendency.
4.
It can be computed for ratio, interval level and ordinal level data.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE A sample of fees paid by commuters from Ikeja to Ogba are as follows.
N150, N120, N130, N120, N100.
Find the median values for the fees.
3.3 MODE It is another measure of central tendency.
It is the value of the observation that appears most frequency.
Example 5 Given the following set of data; 35, 49, 50, 50, 40, 58, 50, 60, 50, 65, 50, 71, 50, 55, what is the mode?
Solution A look at the values reveals that 50 appears more than any other.
The mode is therefore 50.
We can determine the mode for all levels of data whether they are nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio.
1).The mode also has the advantage of not being affected by extremely high or low values like the median.
2).
It can be used as a measure of central tendency for open-ended distributions.
The mode has a number of disadvantages however, that causes it to be used less frequently than the mean or median.
For many sets of data, there is no mode if no value appears more than once.
93 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE The following information represent the distribution of pencils in a market 40, 51, 39, 53, 51, 85, 75, 53, 44, 53, 90, 53.
Find the mode of pencil distribution.
3.4 THE MEAN, MEDIAN AND MODE OF GROUPED DATA In a grouped data the information is presented in the form of a frequency distribution.
It is usually impossible to secure the mean at face value using the original raw data.
Thus if we are interested in estimating the mean value to represent the data, we must estimate it based on a frequency distribution.
1.
THE ARITHMETIC MEAN OF GROUPED DATA To approximate the arithmetic mean of data organized into a frequency distribution, the observations in each class are represented by the midpoints of the class.
The mean of a sample of data organized in a frequency distribution is computed by: X = fx/ where X = mean n X = mid value or midpoint of each class, F = frequency in each class Fx = frequency in each class midpoints of class.
fx = sum of these products n = number of frequencies Example 6 Given the data group into a frequency distribution below Monthly Rentals of Halls No.
of units 600-799 3 800-999 7 1000-1199 11 1200-1399 22 1400-1599 49 1600-1799 24 1800-1999 9 2000-2199 4 120 What is the mean monthly rental for the group data?
94  Solution Monthly rentals No.
of units F X (midpoints) Fx of halls 600-799 3 699.5 2098.5 800-999 7 899.5 6296.5 1000-1199 11 1099.5 12094.5 1200-1399 22 1299.5 28589 1400-1599 40 1499.5 59980 1600-1799 24 1699.5 40788 1800-1999 9 1899.5 17095.5 200-2199 4 2099.5 8398 120 175340 X = fx/ n = 175340 120 = 1461.16667 2.
THE MEDIAN OF GROUPED DATA Recall that the median is defined as the value below which half of the value lie and above which the other half of the values lie.
Since the raw data has been organized into a frequency distribution, some of the information is not identifiable.
As a result, we cannot determine an exact median it can be estimated however by i.
Locating the class in which the median lies ii.
Interpolating within that class to arrive at the median The rationale for this approach is that the members of the median class are assumed to be evenly spaced throughout the class.
The formula is Median = L+ n/ – cfi 2 f where, L = lower true limit of the class containing the median N = total number of frequencies, F = frequency of the median class Cf = cumulative no of frequencies in all classes immediately, proceeding the class containing the median, I = width of the class in which the median lies 95 Example 7 Using the frequency in question 6 determine the median Solution Monthly rentals F Cumulative frequency 600-799 3 3 800-999 7 10 1000-1199 11 21 1200-1399 22 43 1400-1599 40 83 1600-1799 24 107 1800-1999 9 116 2000-2199 4 120 The monthly rentals have already been arranged in ascending order from 600-2199.
It is common practice to locate the middle observation by dividing the total number of observations by 2.
In this case, n/ = 120/ = 60.
2 2 The class containing the 60th unit is located by referring to the cumulative frequency column in the table above.
The 60th rental is in the 1400-1599 class.
Recall that the lower unit of the class is really 1399.50 and the upper limit is 1599.50.
To interpolate in the 1399.50 to 1599.50 class, recall that the monthly rentals are assumed to be evenly distribution between the lower and upper true limits, there are 17 rentals between the 43rd and 60th units.
And there are median is therefore 17/ .
The distance between 1399.50 and 1599.50, 40 that distance is 200, thus 17/ of 200 or 85 is added to the lower true limit 40 1399.50 to give ‘1484.50’.
The estimated median rental.
To summarize Median = 1399.50 + 60 – 43 (200) 40 = 1399.50 + 17 (200) 40 = 1399.50 + 85 = 1484.50 Using the median formula, we have Median = L1 + n/ – CF i 2 F = 1399.50 + 120/ – 43 (200) 2 40 = 1399.50 + 17/ (200) 40 40 96  = 1399.50 + 85 = 1484.50 3.
THE MODE OF GROUPED DATA Recall that the mode is defined as the value that occurs most frequently.
For data grouped into a frequency distribution, the mode can be approximated by the midpoint of the class containing the largest number of frequencies.
Using the table in example 5 the class with the highest number of frequency has the mode.
Therefore the mode is 40 in the class 1400 – 1599.
4.0 CONCLUSION The above analysis shows that the mean, median and the mode are crucial in statistical analysis.
It cut across all discipline, it is used daily by every individual in daily life be it in the home, office, or business.
It is very essential to know the basics of the measures of central tendency as a source of evaluation of many activities in business and other variables of life.
5.0 SUMMARY The unit has thrown some light on the meaning and scope of the mean, median, and mode, even though the scope is wide and in exhaustive the basic foundational knowledge of the measures of central tendency will help you cope with the challenges of other courses.

98 UNIT 13 MEASURES OF DISPERSION CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main content 3.1 Range 3.2 Average deviation 3.3 Variance 3.4 Standard deviation.
4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this section, we will examine several measure that describe the dispersion, variability or spread of the data.
The measures include; the range, average, deviation, variance, standard deviation among others.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Explain the range  Explain variance  Discuss the standard deviation 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 RANGE: This is the simplest of the measures of dispersion, it is the different between the highest and the lowest values in a set of data, in the form of equation.
Range = highest values – lowest value Example 1 The capacities of metal drum container are 38, 20, 37, 64 and 27 litres respectively.
What is the range?
Solution.
Find the difference between the highest and the lowest numbers in the data.
Range = 64 – 20 = 44 Mid range: It is the middle of the range.
[Highest value – lowest value  2] = 44/2 = 22 99  SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Find the range and the mid range from the following data, 2004, 1988, 2030, 2011,1981.
3.2 AVERAGE DEVIATION: A serious defect of the range is that it is based only on two values; the highest and the lowest.
It does not take into consideration all of the values.
The average deviation does often referred to as the mean deviation, it measures the average amount by which the values in the population or sample vary from their mean, in terms of definition, average deviation(A.
D) is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the deviation from the arithmetic mean.
In terms of the formula, the A.D is computed for a sample by A.D = |X – X | n Where; X = value of each observation, X = the arithmetic mean of the values n = number of observation in the sample, || = the absolute value i.e.
the signs of the deviations from the mean are disregarded.
Because, we use absolute deviation, the mean deviation is often called the Mean Absolute deviation (M.A.D).
Example 2.
The height of sample of carton of sweets is given as follows.
103, 97, 101, 106, 103.
What is the mean deviation.
How it is interpreted?
Solution The arithmetic mean weight is 102, found by the sum of all observations divided by 5.
To find the A.D, take the following steps i.
The mean is subtracted from each value ii.
The absolute deviation are summed iii.
The sum of A.D is divided by the number of values Weights X-X A.D |X-X | 103 1 1 97 -5 5 101 -1 1 106 4 4 103 1 1 |x-x| = 12 100  A.D = |x- x n = 12/ 5 = 2.4 The average deviation of the sample is 2.4, the interpretation is that the height of the carton deviate on the average 2.4 from the mean weight of 102.
The A.D does have 2 advantages i.
It uses the value of every item in a set of data, in its compilation.
ii.
It is easy to understand However, absolute values are difficult to work with, so the average deviation is not frequently used.
3.3 THE VARIANCE The variance is the arithmetic mean of the squared deviation from the mean.
1.
Population variance The formula for the population variance and a sample variance are slightly different.
The population variance is found by; F2 = (x-U)2 or x2 – (x)2 N N N Where; F2 = population variance, X = the value of the observation in the population, U = the mean of the population, N = total number of observations in the population.
Example 3.
The ages of all patients in ward A in Abuja clinic are 38, 26, 13, 41, 22 years.
What is the population variance?

3.4 SAMPLE STANDARD DEVIATION A sample S.|D is used as an estimator of the population standard deviation.
The sample deviation is the square root of the sample variance.
It is found by the formula; S = (x-x)2 n-1 or using the more direct formula the standard deviation can be given as S = x2 – (x)2 N _____________ n – 1 Using the previous example 5 the standard deviation can be determined as the square root of the variance as follows.
S = 10 = 3.16 4.0 CONCLUSION The above analysis shows that the measures of dispersion determine the rate at which the data spread.
It is of importance to know the rate of variability of any given data, this help us to ensure that there is even distribution in data collection as it is used daily by every individual in life be it in the home, office, or business.
Example it is very essential to know the rate of spread of customers, consumer for a business man.

This relationship could be positive or negative or zero.
The method of establishing this relationship is also known as scatter diagram.
In this unit you will learn how to determine correlation using statistical equations.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Explain the basic concept of correlation  Discuss rank correlation  Explain correlation coefficient 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Correlation is a statistical method used to define or establish a relation that exists between 2 or more variables.
This relationship could be positive or negative or zero.
The method of establishing this relationship is also known as scatter diagram.
A scatter diagram measures the closeness of variable among themselves and vice-versa.
The formula for correlation coefficient is as follows.
r = ∑xy ∑x2 ∑y2 104  _ Y X Y x = X – Y = Y – XY X2 Y2 X Y 1 6 30 -6 11 -66 36 21 2 9 15 -3 -4 12 9 16 3 15 16 3 -3 -9 9 9 4 18 15 6 -4 -24 36 16 Calculate the correlation co-efficient for the above data and interpret your result.
_ _ X = 48 = 12, Y = 19 r = -84 = r = -84 = -0.70 90 x 162 120.74 The above shows that there is negative correlation.
r > 0.5 = Strong correlation r < 0.5 = Weak correlation r = 0 – No correlation If r = 1 there is Perfect correlation between the variables r = negative = There is inverse relationship SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE The following data represent the performance of some students in some courses Mr Abo.56,67,46,80,52,48,68,74.
