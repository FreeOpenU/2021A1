Onwe School of Business and Human Resource Management National Open University of Nigeria Victoria Island, Lagos 12UNIT 1: COST OF CAPITAL CONTENTS: 1.0 Introduction 131.1 Objectives 2.1 Cost of Equity Capital (Ke) 2.2 Cost of Retained Earnings (Kr) 2.3 Cost of Preferred Capital (Kp) 2.4 Cost of Debt (Kd) 2.5 Weighted Average Cost of Capital 2.6 Convertible Loan Stocks 3.0 Conclusion 4.0 Summary 5.0 Tutor Marked Assignment (TMA) 6.0 Further Reading/References 1.1 INTRODUCTION The management of a company has the paramount responsibility of directing and controlling the company in the best interest of the owners (shareholders) and the investors.
The main objective of a business firm is to maximize the wealth of its shareholders in the long run.
The management is therefore expected to invest only in those projects which give a return in excess of cost of funds invested in the projects of the business.
This cost of funds committed to the projects of the business is what is called Cost of Capital.
The cost of capital refers to the rate of return the company has to pay to various suppliers of funds in the company.
It can be described as the minimum rate of return that a firm must earn on its investments so that market value per share remains unchanged.
In other words, it is the minimum required rate of return on the investment project that keeps the present wealth of shareholders unchanged.
There are variations in the costs of capital due to the fact that different kinds of investment assume different levels of risk which is compensated for by different levels of return.
Because different sources are opened to a business firm when raising funds, basically equity and debt, the determination of cost of funds becomes a phenomenon.
Cost of capital is also referred to as cut-off rate, target rate, hurdle rate, minimum required rate of return and standard return.
It consists of risk-free return plus premium for risk associated with the particular business.
Risk premium represents the additional return paid to the providers of capital and debt in regards of the associated business and financial risks.
In the NPV (Net Present Value) method, an investment project is accepted if it has positive NPV.
The projects NPV is calculated discounting its cashflows by the cost of capital referred to as discounting rate.
However, in the IRR (Internal Rate of Return) method, the investment project is accepted if it has an IRR that is higher/greater than the cost of capital.
14Meanwhile, the capital composition of a company is very essential.
The capital structure of a typical company will include the following types of long term capital: a) Ordinary (Equity) Share Capital b) Preference Share Capital c) Retained Earnings d) Debentures and Bonds e) Term Loans from Financial Institutions and Banks.
In determining the optimal finance combination of a company, we will need to calculate the cost of each particular finance being used and also the combined cost of capital i.e.
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
1.2 Learning Objectives - What cost of capital is - Distinctions among Equity Capital, Preference Share Capital and Debt Capital - Cost of Equity Capital considering Dividend Growth Model, Dividend Yield Model, Price Earning Model and Capital Asset Pricing Model - Cost of retained earnings - Cost of Redeemable and Irredeemable Preference Share Capital - Cost of Redeemable and Irredeemable Debentures - Convertible Loan Stocks - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of various sources of finance 1.3 COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL (KE) This is the ordinary shareholders required rate of return which equates the present value of the expected dividends with the market value of the share.
It can also be defined as the minimum rate of return that a company must earn on the equity share capital financial portion of an investment project to maintain the market price of the shares.
Different methods are used in calculating cost of equity.
These include: a) Dividend Yield Method b) Dividend Growth Model c) Price Earning Method d) Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 15Dividend Yield Method Under this method, cost of equity is seen as the discounting rate that equates the present value of all expected future dividends per share with the current market price or the net proceeds of the sale of a share.
Dividend valuation model states that: ex-dividend share price = do + d1 + d2 + dn (1 + Ke)1 (1 + Ke)2 (1 + Ke) n Where, d = the constant dividend per share Ke = Cost of equity share capital n = year (time period) Since this method assumes constant future dividend per equity share then MVe = d Ke Therefore Ke = d MVe Where MVe = ex-dividend market share price.
This method does not allow for any growth rate in dividend but rather emphasizes on future equity dividend expected to be constant.
Illustration 1.1 Ajegbe Ltd is expected to disburse a dividend of 300k on each equity share of 100k.
The current market price of share is 800k.
Calculate the cost of equity capital as per dividend yield method.
Solution Ke = d d = 300k or MVe = 800k MVe Ke = 300/800 = 0.375 = 37.5% Illustration 1.2 Odidere Ltd issued 10,000 equity shares of 10k each at a premium of 2k each.
The company has incurred issue expenses of N50.
The equity shareholders expect the rate of dividend to 18% p.a.
Calculate the cost of equity share capital.
16Solution Since the equity shares are newly issued Ke = di NP NP = Net proceeds of each equity share di = 10 x 0.18 = 1.8 NP = (10,000 x 12) – 5000k = 11.50 10,000 equity shares Ke = 1.80 = 0.1565 or 15.65% 11.00 Note that the Market value per equity share is ex-div.
Where the market value given is cum-div it should not be used.
The amount of the dividend should be ascertained and deducted from the figure given to become ex-div.
Dividend Growth Model In practice, growth in dividend yearly is expected.
Dividend is not expected to remain unchanged in perpetuity.
This method therefore makes provision for dividend growth.
Hence, Ke = d1 + g MVe where d1 = Expected dividend payable in year one per equity share g = growth rate MVe = Market d1 which is the expected dividend payable in year one incorporates elements of growth.
It is equal to the Latest/Current dividend paid plus growth in dividend.
di = do (1 + g) where, do = Latest / Current dividend paid g = growth rate Therefore: Ke = d1 + g OR do(1+ g) + g MVe MVe Illustration 1.3 OSU Nig Plc has an authorized share capital of 450m of N1 each.
80% of the share capital had been issued and each share is currently valued at 320k.
Dividend 17amounting to N16m was recently paid.
The estimated growth rate is 18%.
Calculate the cost of equity capital.
Solution Issues share capital = 80% of 50m = 40m shares = 40k DPS = 16m / 40m shares Ke = do(1+ g) + g MVe Ke = 40k (1.18) + 0.18 320k Ke = 32.75% Illustration 1.4 The equity of Dangote Ltd are traded in the market at 90k each.
The expected current year dividend per share is 18k.
The growth in dividend is expected at the rate of 6%.
Calculate the cost of equity capital.
Solution Ke = d1 + g 18 + 0.06 = 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.26 or 26% MVe 90 Estimating the Growth Rate There are two methods of estimating the growth rate a) Dividend growth valuation method b) Gordon’s growth method/investment on earnings model.
Under Dividend growth valuation method: n do – 1 dB where g = growth rate dL = latest dividend dB = Base dividend n = number of years under Gordon’s growth method g = r x b 18where g = growth rate r = return on investment b = retention ratio/rate i.e.
proportion of earnings retained.
Illustration 1.5 Given the following information about Obasanjo PLC.
Issued shares of N1 each N150,000 Current dividend 6,158 Market value per share 3.42 Current earnings 62,858 Net assets 315,000 Dividend – 5 years ago 2,473 Estimate the dividend growth rate using 1) dividend growth valuation method 2) Gordon’s growth method Solution g = n dL – 1 dB r = 5, dL = 6,158 dB = 2,473 g = 5 6,158 - 1 2,473 g = 5 2.4900 - 1 = 20% NOTE: Where the dividend for the years are given year by year, then use n-1 (number of years data provided) 2) Gordon’s g = r x b r = 62,858 x 100 = 20% 315,000 b = 62,858 – 6158 = 90% 62,858 g = 0.20 x 0.90 = 18% Price Earning Method 19This method incorporates the earnings per share (EPS) and the market price of the share.
This is based in the assuring firm that the future earnings whether disbursed to the shareholders or ploughed back into the business will cause future growth in the earnings of the company as well as the increase in market prices of the share.
Therefore; Ke = E M where E = Current earnings per share M = Market price per share Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM divides the required rate of return into two parts: i) Risk free return ii) Risk Premium The risk premium is calculated by applying the project’s beta factor (B) to the difference between the market return and the risk free rates of the return.
Ke = Rf + B (Rm – Rf) Where Rf = Risk free rate of return Rm = Market portfolio’s expected rate of return B = Risk measurement (Beta factor) (Rm – Rf) = Market premium for risk B(Rm – Rf) = Risk premium 1.4 COST OF RETAINED EARNINGS (KR) Retained earnings represent the funds accumulated over years of the company by keeping part of the funds generated without distribution.
It is the proportion of the total earnings of a company distributable to the equity shareholders but which is ploughed back into the business for further profitable investment opportunities.
If the retained earnings are distributed among equity shareholders, the amount would have been reinvested to earn return on it.
The cost of retained earnings therefore is the return forgone by the equity shareholders and it is the opportunity cost of funds not available for reinvestment by the individual shareholders.
The cost of retained earnings is therefore equivalent to opportunity rate of earnings forgone by the equity shareholders.
Hence, cost of equity includes retained earnings.
1.5 COST OF PREFERRED CAPITAL (KP) The preference share capital represents the fixed dividend capital.
It is easier to estimate because the interest received by the holder of the security is fixed by 20contract and will not fluctuate in amount.
It may be redeemable or irredeemable.
Redeemable preference shares are shares the holders of which are refunded due sum at redemption in accordance with the terms under which the shares were issued and retained of the shares by the company.
Cost of Irredeemable Preference Shares This is calculated as follows: Kp = d MVp where Kp = Cost of preference share capital d = Latest/Current dividend paid/payable MVp = Market Value of preference shares ex-div Cost of Redeemable Preference Shares The cost of redeemable preference shares is the rate of interest (IRR) which equates the current market value with the discounted future cash receipts of the share.
MVp= d1 + d2 +d3+---- dn (1+kp)1 (1+kp)12 (1+kp)3 (1+kp)n 1.6 COST OF DEBENTURES CAPITAL This is the minimum rate of return required by debenture holders in order to maintain their existing market value.
Cost of Irredeemable Debentures: It is given as: Kd = I (1 – t) MVd Where, Kd = Cost of debt capital I = Latest / Current interest paid/payable MVd = Market value of debt ex-int t = Corporation tax rate Cost of Redeemable debt MVd= Io(1-t) + I (1-t) + I (1-t) + ---- I (1-t) 1 2 n (1+kd)1 (1+kd)2 (1+kd)n Illustration 1.6 XYZ Plc is financed by N10m, 10% redeemable debentures currently quoted at N100 each.
The debentures would be redeemed in 10 years time at par Corporation tax is at 30%.
Calculate the cost of the debentures.

Using WACC, the proportion of total capital coming from each source of finance is weighted.
The weighted costs are then added to give the overall cost of capital that is known as the WACC.
WACC derives its importance from the argument that it is not appropriate to use the cost of specific fund as the cost for a project, particularly where such projects are to be financed from the internal resources of the company.

The cost of equity capital is estimated by using different methods which include Dividend Yield Method, Dividend Growth Model, Price Earnings Method and Capital Asset Pricing Model.
Dividend growth rate can be ascertained either by using dividend growth valuation model or Gordon’s growth model.
Cost of preference shares, cost of debts, cost of convertible loan stocks and weighted average cost of capital are also deal with.

Fundamentals of Financial Management (1996) UNIT 2: CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORY Learning Objectives At the end of this unit, students should have understood: - The meaning of capital structure and different components of capital structure - Relationship of cost of capital and risk 25- Gearing and financial risk - Optimum capital structure - Factors influencing capital structure decisions - Net income and net operating income approaches of capital structuring - Modigliani and Miller’s view on capital structuring without taxation - Arbitrage process under MM theory CONTENTS 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Factors Determining Capital Structure Decisions 2.3 Optimum Capital Structure 2.4 Gearing and Financial Risk 2.5 Capital Structure Approaches 2.6 M-M Theory (Modern View) 2.7 Arbitrage 2.8 Summary 2.9 Self Review Questions 2.1 INTRODUCTION Capital structure ordinarily implies the proportion of debt and equity in the total capital of a company.
In other words, capital structure of a company is made up of equity and debt.
Capital structure borders on how a company finances its operations and it is usually made up of ordinary share capital, preference share capital and debt capital.
Equity consists of the following: equity share capital, share premium, surplus profits, and reserves and so on.
On the other hand, debt of a company may consist of all borrowings from the government statutory financial corporations and other agencies, term loans from banks and other financial institutions, debentures and all deferred payment liabilities.
Ordinarily, increase in debt in the capital structure implies greater amount of interest payment.
Therefore, capital structure theory becomes a topic of interest because the introduction of fixed interest debt in a company’s capital structure increases its financial risk.
This is partly due to the fact that interest must be paid whatever happens to earnings.
Since acceptance of more debt means payment of greater amount of interest, the company must have to think twice about its effects on profitability.
2.2.
FACTORS DETERMINING CAPITAL STRUCTURE DECISIONS 26Control: The number of equity shares held by an individual shareholder determines his level of control and voting rights in the company.
When the shareholders do not wish to dilute their control, the company will rely more on debt funds.
This is because by funding through equity the control of the existing shareholders will be threatened.
Growth: Companies with high growth rate will require more funds for its expansion schemes which will be met through raising debt.
The company will have to rely on debt than on equity and internal earnings.
Profitability: A company with higher profitability will have low reliance on outside debt and it will meet its additional requirement through internal generation.
Government Policy: Government policies and regulations play a major role in a company’s capital structure.
Monetary and fiscal policies of government have strong implication on the capital structure decisions of a company.
Legal Provisions: In raising equity capital, a company has to fulfill some certain legal terms and conditions which make equity capital funds more complicated than raising debt.
A company may opt for debt in an attempt to sideline the cumbersome process.
Company Size: The companies with small capital base will rely more on owners’ funds and internal earnings.
Large companies have to depend on capital market.
2.3 OPTIMUM CAPITAL STRUCTURE The optimum capital structure is that capital structure or combination of equity and debt that leads to the maximization of the value of the firm.
The optimum capital structure minimizes the overall cost of the firm and maximizes the value of the firm.
The introduction of debt to capital structure increases the earnings per share as the interest on debt is tax deductible, which results in increase in share price.
However higher levels of debt funds in capital structure result in greater financial risk and leads to higher cost of capital and depress the market price of company’s share.
The firm must therefore endeavour to achieve and maintain the optimum capital structure not dispensing with the value maximization objective of the firm.
2.4 GEARING AND FINANCIAL RISK A company is a geared company if there is debt in its capital structure and when fixed interest debt is introduced into a company’s capital structure, the financial 27risk is increased.
Financial risk is the increased risk of equity holders due to financial gearing.
It does not arise from a company’s investment; it is due solely to the capital structure or more specifically to the level of gearing.
The financial risk of a company’s capital structure can be measured by a gearing ratio.
Gearing ratio shows the proportionate relationship between fixed interest and equity capital in the finance of a business.
Forms of Gearing 1st Gearing Ratio = Fixed interest capital + Pref.
Share Capital Shareholders funds 2nd Gearing Ratio = Fixed interest capital + Pref.
Share Capital Capital Employed 3rd Gearing Ratio = Total Debt Shareholders funds Total debt includes all liabilities of the company.
It does not however include preference share which for this ratio is taken as part of the shareholders funds.
4th Gearing Ratio = Interest on debt EBIT Advantages of Debt Capital 1.
The administrative and issuing costs are normally lower than raising equity capital.
2.
It has cost advantage due to the ability to set debt interest against profit for tax purposes.
3.
The pre-tax rate of interest is invariably lower than the return required by the equity capital suppliers.
2.5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORIES There are two main theories about the effect of changes in gearing on the WACC and share value.
These are: 1.
The Net Income Approach (Traditional view).
2.
The Net Operating Income Approach.
Basic Assumptions of the Theory of Capital Structure 1.
The gearing of a company is changed immediately by issuing debt to purchase shares or by issuing shares to purchase debt.
2.
The company pays out all its earnings as dividends.
3. Business risk is constant regardless of how the company invests its funds.
284.
Taxation and its effect on cost capital are ignored.
5.
There are no transaction costs and a company can alter its capital structure without any transaction costs.
Net Income Approach A decision about capital structure, according to this approach, is relevant to the valuation of the firm.
This approach views that an alteration in the capital structure of a firm causes change in the overall cost of capital (WACC) and also in the total value of the firm.
This approach states that debt capital is cheaper than equity and that as such a company can increase its value by borrowing up to a reasonable limit.
According to this approach, the value of the firm is equal to the market value of equity plus the market value of debt.
Cost of capital Ke Kw Kd p Level of gearing Under this approach, the following assumptions hold: 1.
The cost of debt will remain constant until a significant point is reached when it would start to rise.
2.
The WACC will fall immediately an external source of finance is introduced and will be rising thereafter as the level of gearing increases.
3.
The company’s market value and the market per share will be maximized where WACC is at the lowest point (p).
Net Operating Income Approach 29According to this approach, value of the firm is independent of its capital structure.
It states that the way a company finances its operations is irrelevant in the determination of the company’s market value.
It assumes that the weighted average cost of capital remains unchanged irrespective of the level of gearing.
It derives its strength from the assumption that increase in debt capital increases the expected rate of return by the stockholders and the benefit of using relatively cheaper debt funds is offset by the loss arising out of the increase in cost of equity.
Under this approach, optimal capital structure does not exist as WACC remains constant.
Ke Kw Kd 1.
Cost of debt will remain constant regardless of the level of gearing.
2.
The WACC will remain unchanged as the gearing increases.
3.
The cost of equity will rise in such a way as to keep the WACC constant.
The value of firm = EBIT Ko Value of Equity share = Value of firm – Value of debt Where EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Tax Ko = Overall cost of capital.
Illustration 2.1 A company has N10, 000 debts at 10% interest and earns N10, 000 a year before interest is paid.
There are 4,500 issued shares and weighted average cost of capital of the company is 20%.
a) (i) What is the company’s market value?
(ii) What is the cost of its equity capital?
30 (iii) What is the market value per share of its equity?
(b) Suppose the company issues N10, 000 additional debt at 10% interest to repurchase shares at the price calculated in (iii) above.

Miller (MM) in 1958.
MM argues that a company’s WACC remains unchanged at all levels of gearing, which implies that no optimal capital structure exists for a particular company.
By using Arbitrage theory, they supported their argument that capital structure is irrelevant in determining the market value of a company.
A change in debt-equity has no influence on the cost of capital and the market value of the firm.
Assumptions of the M-M Theory - The capital market is perfect.
The implication is that cost of insolvency is nil, information is freely available to all investors, there are no limits of borrowing, for every transaction there is a seller and a buyer.
- All securities are infinitely divisible.
- There are no transaction costs.
- Homogenous expectations.
The investors have the same expectations, which are the same with that of the company.
- The debt is cheaper that equity.
Increase in debt level will increase the cost of debt.
The increased debt will increase the financial risk and expectations of the equity holders will be more.
Thus, the WACC will remain constant for all levels of leverage.
- There are no personal taxes and corporate income taxes.
- All investors are only price takers.
- The stock markets are perfectly competitive.
33M-M Theory: No Taxation By MM Theory, the increase in cost of equity is just enough to offset the benefit of low cost debt when there is increase in the level of debt.
Then average cost of capital is constant for all levels of leverage.
From the assumptions of the M-M theory, three propositions are set out: Proposition I This states that the market value of any firm is independent of its capital structure, altering the gearing ratio cannot have any effect on the company annual cash flow.
Company’s value is determined by the assets in which the company has invested and not how those assets are financed.
The value of the geared company is as follows: MVg = MVu MVg = Profit before interest WACC MVu = MVg = Earnings in ungeared company Ku Where: MVg = Market value of a geared company MVu = Market value of ungeared company Ku = Cost of equity in an ungeared company Proposition II The rate of return required by shareholders increases in proportion to the debt- equity ratio increase.
The cost of equity rises exactly in line with any increase in gearing to offset any benefits conferred by the use of cheap debt.
The cost of equity of a geared firm is calculated as follows: Kg = Ku + [(Ku – Kd) x D] MVeg Where: Kg = Cost of capital in a geared company 34 Kd = Cost of debt D = Value of Debt MVeg = Market value of a geared company Proposition III The cut-off rate for new investment will in all cases be average cost of capital and will be unaffected by the type of security used to finance the investment.
ARBITRAGE The process of buying an asset or security in one market and selling the same in another market to derive benefit from the price differential is referred to as arbitrage.
The arbitrage procedure involves that an investor will sell his shares in the company having the higher market value and move to the company having the lower market value lending or borrowing in order to carry out the arbitrage transaction.
The word arbitrage is a technical term that refers to a situation where two identical commodities are selling in the same market for different prices.
At equilibrium, the increase in demand will force up the price of the lower priced goods and increase in supply will force down the price of the high priced goods.
If two firms with same level of business risk but different levels of gearing sold for different values, then shareholders would move from over-valued firm to under valued firm to maintain financial risk at the same level.
The process of arbitrage would drive the price of the two firms to a common equilibrium total value.
Illustration: The capital structure of XYZ ltd and PQR ltd are given below: Particulars XYZ PQR Equity capital 3,000,000 4,000,000 Debt 16% 3,000,000 Total 6,000,000 4,000,000 Both companies are in the same class of business risk with earnings before interest of N1, 800,000.
Mr. X is holding equity of 5% in XYZ ltd.
He sold his shares and borrowed on interest at 16% p.a.
Explain how Mr. X will be better off in switching his holding to PQR ltd under MM theory.
Solution XYZ Ltd profits available for distribution N 35Profit before interest 1,800,000 Less: interest @ 16% 480,000 1,320,000 Mr. X’s share of profit 1,320,000 x 5 = N66,000 100 Value of shares sold = 5 x 3,000,000 = N150,000 100 Value of shares to be bought in PQR = 5 x 4,000,000 = N200,000 100 Amount borrowed = 200,000 – 150,000 = N50,000 Mr. X’s Net Gain N Total earnings in PQR ltd 1,800,000 Mr. X’s share in PQR (1,800,000 x 5) 90,000 100 Less: interest on personal loan (80,000 x 16) 8,000 100 Net earnings of X in PQR ltd 82,000 Net Gain = N82,000 – N66,000 = N16,000 Mr. X could increase his income by N16,000 while maintaining total risk at the same level.

SUMMARY Capital structure of a company consists of debt and equity components raised from long-term sources.
The significant advantage of debt funds is fixed interest obligation and tax deductible.
The debt equity ratio is a commonly used determinant of capital structure.
In traditional approach, the optimum capital structure is determined at a profit where WACC is minimum and at this point the value of firm is maximised.
The net operating income approach on the other hand, states that the value of firm is independent of its capital structure.
MM theory is considered as modern approach to capital structure.
MM argue that the process of arbitrage will prevent the different market values for equivalent firms.

3.1.
INTRODUCTION Leverage refers to the ability of a firm to enhance returns to the owners in introducing long-term funds having a fixed cost.
In other words, leverage is the employment of fixed assets or funds for which a firm had to meet fixed costs or fixed ratio of interest obligation, irrespective of the level of activities attained or the level of operating profit earned.
Leverage ratios can be classified into two groups (a) Activity Leverage and (b) Structural Leverage.
3.2.
LEVERAGE RATIOS a) Activity Leverage.
This includes three ratios i.
Operating Leverage.
ii.
Financial Leverage.
iii.
Total Leverage.
i.
Operating Leverage.
This has to do with the normal operation of a firm.
It arises from the operating activity of the firm.
It relates to the sales and profit variations.
Operating leverage is the responsiveness of firm’s EBIT to the changes in sales value.
i.e.
Operating Leverage = Contribution EBIT OR Contribution Operating Profit.
Operating leverage of a firm is determined by the fixed cost and variable cost mix of the firm.
If the firm has high level of fixed cost and low variable cost, the 38operating leverage would be higher.
The low operating leverage is dictated by high variable cost and low fixed cost.
The percentage change in EBIT resulting from a percentage change in sales can be measured and this is called degree of operating leverage.
Degree of Operating leverage = Percentage change in EBIT Percentage change in sales Or = %ΔEBIT %ΔQ Or = Q (P – V) Q (P – V) – F Where, Q = Quantity produced and sold P = Selling price per unit V = Variable cost per unit F = Operating fixed costs Operating Leverage is present in the firm if %Δ EBIT > 1 %Δ Q Illustration 3.1 Firms A and B manufactures the same product and their cost sheets are given below A B Units manufactured and sold 20,000 20,000 N N Direct material 10 10 Direct labour 5 5 Variable overheads 5 5 20 20 Contribution 10 10 Selling price 30 30 Assuming the fixed overheads of 100,000 150,000 Calculate the operating leverages for the two firms.
Solution A B N N Contribution for 20,000 units 200,000 200,000 Less: Fixed overheads 100,000 150,000 EBIT 100,000 50,000 Contribution 200,000 200,000 39EBIT 100,000 50,000 Operating leverage 2 4 Firm A’s operating leverage is twice of B as the fixed overheads are higher.
The higher the operating leverage ratio the more risky the situation.
(ii) Financial Leverage This has to do with the financing activities of a firm.
It refers to the use of debt in the capital structure.
The financial leverage is an indicator of responsiveness of firm’s EPS to the changes in its profit before interest and tax.
When this ratio is considered along with the operating ratio, it gives a fair idea about the firm’s earning, its fixed costs and the fixed interest expenses.
The degree of financial leverage is an attribute of the firm’s exposure to financial risk.
Financial Leverage = EBIT EBT Where EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBT = Earnings Before Tax The degree of financial leverage is expressed as follows: DFL = Percentage change in EPS Percentage change in EBIT Or = %Δ EPS or Δ EPS/EPS %Δ EBIT Δ EBIT/EBIT EPS is estimated as below: EPS = (EBIT – I) (1 – t) - Dp N Thus Degree of financial leverage can also be expressed as follows: DFL = EBIT (EBIT – I) (1 – t) – Dp Where I = Interest on long-term debt t = Corporate tax rate Dp = preference dividend.
Illustration 3.2 The following information is available for Orimogunje Ltd for the year ended 31st March, 2005.
Interest on debt N400,000 Preference dividend N200,000 Corporate tax 40% 40Calculate the degree of financial leverage.
(i) if EBIT is N1,000,000 (ii) if EBIT is N1,500,000 Solution DFL = EBIT = EBIT EPS (EBIT – I) (1 – t) – Dp (i) DFL = 1,000,000 (1,000,000 – 400,000) (1 – 0.4) – 200,000 = 1,000,000 600,000 (0.6) – 200,000 = 1,000,000 = 6.25 160,000 (ii) DFL = 1,500,000 1,100,000 (0.6) – 200,000 Favourable or unfavourable financial leverage can arise depending on the firm’s earnings on the assets and fixed financing cost paid.
It is favourable when the firm earns more on the assets purchased than the fixed financing cost paid.
On the contrary, excess of financing costs over profits results in unfavourable or negative leverage.
Higher financial leverage means higher EBIT resulting in higher EPS, if other things (variables) remain the same.
Financial leverage generally raises expected EPS, but it also increases the riskiness of securities as the debt-asset ratio rises.
Financial leverage has its impending effect on a firm’s WACC and value.
Increase in financial leverage will reduce WACC and bring about increase in the market price of equity shares and value of the firm.
On the contrary, decrease in financial leverage will cause increase in WACC and decline in the value of the firm.
(iii) Total Leverage Total leverage may be defined as the potential use of fixed costs, both operating and financial which magnifies the effect of sales volume change on the EPS of the firm.
The total leverage is also called “Combined Leverage”.
Total leverage degree can be calculated as follows: 41DTL = Operating Leverage x Financial Leverage Or = Contribution x EBIT EBIT EBT Or = Contribution or = ΔEPS/EPS EBT Δ Q /Q Substituting the value EPS: QTL = Q (P – V) Q (P – V) – F – I – (Dp) 1 – t (b) Structural Leverage This encompasses ratios that express the relationship between owner’s capital and outsider’s stake in the firm.
These ratios are also called capital gearing ratios.
They are: 1.
Debt-Equity ratio 2.
Total debt-equity ratio 3.
Debt-Net worth ratio.
1.
Debt-Equity Ratio.
This ratio is the most significant of leverage ratios as it gives the composition of the long-term funds of the firm in terms of the stake of the owners and outsiders in the business.
Long term Debt Shareholder funds Shareholder funds include equity capital and free reserves.
A high ratio indicates large outside stake in the business.
The preference capital is usually excluded from long term debt but if the ratio is to show effect of use of fixed interest sources on earnings available to the shareholders then, it is to be included.
On the other hand, if the ratio is to examine financial solvency, then preference shares shall form part of the capital.
2.
Total Debt-Equity Ratio Here, total debt includes not only long-term debt but also current liabilities.
Long-term Debt + Short-term liabilities Shareholders Funds 42The inclusion of current liabilities in debt-equity ratio is justified by the fact that the sundry creditors can exert pressure on the management.
3.
Debt-Net worth Ratio.
This ratio relates the long-term debt with the network of the firm that is, the capital and free reserves less intangible assets.
Long-term Debt Net worth This ratio is justified on the basis that it excludes invested capital in fictitious assets like deferred expenditure.
3.3 INTEREST COVER AND INCOME GEARING This ratio is calculated to analyse the company’s ability to meet interest obligations.
It is measured as a ratio of profit before interest and tax to interest charges.
Profit Before Interest and Tax Interest Charges The inverse of the interest cover is called income gearing indicating the proportion of pre-tax earnings committed to prior interest charges.
Interest charges x 100 Profit Before Interest and Tax Capital Gearing Ratio This ratio is the proportion of the fixed return capital to the total capital.
It is given as: Fixed Return capital Total Capital = Long-term debt + Preference Capital Long-term debt + Preference Capital + Equity Capital +Reserves Illustration 3.3 Busayo and Papa Ltd’s balance sheet shows the following structure of finance for the year ended 31st March, 2009.
N 43Equity share capital (5,000,000 of N1 each) 5,000,000 Pref.
Share capital (12%) (100,000 share of N10 each) 1,000,000 Share premium 2,000,000 General Reserve 1,500,000 Non-Convertible Debentures (14%) 4,000,000 Current Liabilities 500,000 Total assets 14,000,000 The profit earned during the year before interest payments and tax at 40% amounted to N3,400,000.
Board of Directors recommends a dividend at 18% on equity shares.
You are required to calculate (a) Capital gearing ratio (b) Income gearing ratio Solution (a) Capital gearing ratio = Long-term debt + Pref.
Capital Long-term debt + Pref.
Capital + Equity Capital + Reserves = 40 + 10 x 100 = 50 x 40 + 10 + 50 +20 +15 135 The gearing ratio is small and the company’s financial risk is lesser.
(b) Income Gearing ratio = EBIT = 34 = 6.07 times Fixed Interest 5.60 3.4 SUMMARY The fixed interest debt component is used in total capital structure to enhance the return to the equity shareholders.
But the risk will increase in times of unfavourable business condition.
Leverage refers to the ability of a firm in employing long-term funds having a fixed interest to enhance returns to the owners.
It is expressed as Contribution/Net Profit.
If the operating leverage is higher the company is subject to greater degree of business risk.
Financial leverage refers to the use of debt component in capital structure and the effect of payment of fixed interest on firm’s profitability.
It is EBIT / EBT.
44The higher the combined leverage, the firm is subject to greater risk which includes both business risk and financial risk.

Taxmann allied Services (P.) Ltd. (2007) UNIT 4: CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND VALUE OF THE FIRM Learning Objectives: At the end of this study, students must have understood: 45- M-M Theory with taxation.
- Application of Pecking Order Theory in capital structuring - Modified Pecking Order suggested by Myers CONTENTS 4.1 Introduction 4.2 MM Theory with corporate taxation 4.3 MM Theory with personal taxation 4.4 Pecking Order Theory 4.5 Summary 4.6 Self Review Questions 4.1 INTRODUCTION In unit 2, MM theory has been treated with the tax relief being ignored.
The assumption that there is no corporate tax is unrealistic for a corporate firm.
From this perspective, MM has modified their theory by considering tax relief available to a geared company when the debt component is existing in the capital structure.
4.2 MM THEORY WITH CORPORATE TAXATION Here, the MM theory demonstrates a situation of a firm where corporate taxation is put under consideration.
The tax burden on the company will lessen to the extent of relief available on interest payable on the debt, which makes the cost of debt cheaper and reduces the WACC of the firm to the lower where capital structure of a company has debt component.
Cost of equity Cost of capital 46WACC Cost of Debt (After tax) Gearing As the level of gearing increases the WACC will be reducing and the company’s market value will be maximized at 100% level of gearing.
The increase in the value of the company is the present value of further tax relief referred to as a tax shield.
They assumed that the value of the geared company will always be greater than an ungeared company with similar business risk, but only by the amount of debt-associated tax saving of the geared company.
So, at equilibrium price the market value of a geared company is equal to the market value of its ungeared counterpart plus the debt assisted tax shield.
At equilibrium MVg = MVu + Dt Where, MVg = Market value of the geared company MVu = Market value of an ungeared company D = Market value of debt capital t = Corporation tax rate Cost of Capital of a Geared Company Kg = (Ke x % of Equity) + (1 – t) (Kd x % of Debt) Where Kg = WACC Ke = Cost of Equity capital Kd = Cost of debt capital (Pre-tax) Cost of Equity Capital of a Geared Company Keg = Ku + (1 – t) (Ku – Kd) x D Veg Where, Keg = Cost of Equity capital in a geared company Ku = Cost of capital of an ungeared company Kd = Cost of debt capital (Pre-tax) D = Debt capital t = Corporation tax 47Illustration 4.1 Mr. Fash Ltd has the following capital structure: N Equity Capital 3,000,000 Debt (16%) 6,000,000 9,000,000 Corporate tax rate is 40%.
The cost of equity is assumed to be 24%.
Calculate the WACC of the company.
Solution Kg = (24% x 30) + (1 – 0.4) (16% x 60) = 8% + 6.4% 90 90 = 14.4% WACC of a geared company in a tax world is also given as: Kw(g) = Kw(u) [ 1 – Dt ] MVe + MVd Kw(g) = WACC of ageared company Kw(u) = WACC of an ungeared company Vd = Market value debt Ve = Market value of Equity t = Corporation tax rate Illustration 4.2 Yar’Adua owns 1% of the equity of Atiku Plc a geared company with 1m N1 ordinary shares having a market value of N1.10 per share and N600,000 10% debentures valued at N80.
Yar’adua transfers his funds to Obasanjo Plc, an ungeared company.
Both firms are in the same type of business susceptible to the same degree of business risk and both firm generate income before debenture interest of N200,000.
Obasanjo Plc is financed by 1.2 million N1 ordinary shares with a market value of N1.05 per share.
Yar’adua on selling his shares in Atiku Plc would have to borrow sufficient funds in order to buy 1% of Obasanjo Plc.
You are required to calculate: a) Yar’adua’s present income from Atiku Plc.
b) His income on switching funds to Obasanjo Plc.
c) The gain to Yar’adua on switching d) The equilibrium position (Assume only Obasanjo plc’s equity changes in value).

Kd = I as against MVd Kd = I (1 –t) MVd Kd = 10 = 12.5% 80 (c)Gain on switching funds Net income after switching 1,000 Income before switching 840 160 (d) Equilibrium position MVg = MVu + Dt Since it is Obasanjo plc’s market value that must change MVu = MVg – Dt MVu = 1,580,000 – (480,000 x 0.4) 49 = 1,580,000 – 192,000 = 1,388,000 4.3 MM THEORY WITH PERSONAL TAXATION MM theory considered only corporate taxes.
However, Miller (1977) included the effect of personal as well as corporate taxes in capital structure theory.
He argued that the existence of tax relief on debt interest but not on equity dividends would make debt capital more attractive than equity capital to companies.
Companies must be ready to offer a higher return on debt in order to attract greater supply of debt.
When the company offers an after-personal-tax return on debt at least equal to the after-personal-tax return on equity, equity supply will switch over to debt supply to the company.
This is based on the assumption that interest payments on debt are allowed as a tax deduction whereas dividends on equity capital are not allowed for tax deduction.
4.4 PECKING ORDER THEORY This theory was proposed by Donaldson in 1961 and modified by Meyers in 1984.
The theory asserts that a company’s capital structure is more dependent on internal cashflows, cash dividend payment and acceptable investment opportunities (NPV > 0).
This theory states that when a company wants to finance its long-term investments, it selects by following a well defined order of preference with respect to the sources of finance it uses.
At the initial stage, the firm will prefer to use internally generated funds.
If the internal funds are insufficient to meet its investment requirements then it will prefer raising external funds in the form of term loans and then non-convertible debentures and bonds and then convertible debt instruments.
The last to be considered is in the form of new equity capital.
This theory says therefore that: (i) Firms prefer internal financing to external financing (ii) If firms choose external financing, they will issue the safest security first i.e they will choose debt before equity financing.
(iii) As a firm sources for external funds, it will follow the pecking order of securities.
Pecking Order Assumptions - There are no costs involved in using internally generated funds.
- It is expensive to raise external funds.
- Raising of debt is relatively cheaper than raising of equity funds.
50- Raising of term loans from banks and financial institutions is cheaper than issuing debt securities for raising finances.
- Issue of equity capital involves relatively high issue cost.
- Servicing of debt funds is cheaper than servicing of equity funds.
4.5 SUMMARY Originally, MM theory has ignored the corporate and personal taxation, but later Miller modified the theory by considering tax relief available to a geared firm.
As per Pecking order theory, if the firms do require external financing they will issue the safest security first in order of term loans, unsecured debentures, secured debentures, convertible debentures, preference shares, convertible preference shares and finally in the form of new equity shares.
4.6 SELF REVIEW QUESTIONS - How are corporate taxation and personal taxation incorporated in MM theory?
- Write short notes on Pecking Order theory of capital structure.
- Sango Ltd has earning before interest and tax (EBIT) of N3,000,000 and a 40% tax rate.
Its required rate of return on equity in the absence of borrowing is 18%.
In the absence of personal taxes, what is the value of the company in an MM world (a) With no leverage.
(b)With N4,000,000 in debt.
(c) With N7,000,000 in debt.

This unit further discusses the degree of leverage especially how it affects the return to the equity shareholders.
Before further discussions, distinction between debt and equity should be made.
5.2 DISTINCTION BETWEEN DEBT AND EQUITY Debt and equity are different on the following grounds: 1.
Debt capital is repayable to the providers while equity capital is not repayable 2.
The interest on debt is mandatory but dividends on equity are not compulsory.
3.
Interest on debt is tax deductible while dividend on equity is not.
4.
Introduction of debt in a firm’s capital structure increases the financial risk.
However, equity cannot increase a firm’s financial risk.
5.
Debt has a relatively cheaper issuing cost.
6.
With the issue of debt, there is no control dilution whereas; new issue of equity may lead to control dilution.
7.
Debt has a less future financing flexibility compared to equity.
8.
It is often easier to issue debt to financial institutions than equity.
5.3 TRADING ON EQUITY Trading on equity refers to the practices by which a firm uses borrowed funds and preference capital carrying a fixed change in a way to obtain a higher return to the equity shareholders.
The concept of trading on equity has direct impact on 52shareholders wealth because all investing, financing and dividend decisions are taken in view of maximization of wealth of the owners.
The debt funds are less risk bearing compared to equity funds since the providers of debt have prior claims on income and assets of the firm over equity holders.
While the financial leverage explains the impact of EPS, trading on equity shows the impact on equity capital.
It is calculated by taking difference of rate of return on equity capital by having equity and debt components in capital structure to rate of return on equity by having only equity share capital in the capital structure.

In B, by having debt component, the return on equity increases.
In C, it rises further but it is important to note that if the debt component exceeds the desired level, the firm is prone to financial risk and bankruptcy risk.
5.4 GEARING This term refers to the amount of debt finance a company uses relative to its equity finance.
A company is highly geared where there is high level of debt component in its capital structure.
It can be calculated with the help of debt-equity ratio or capital gearing ratio i.e.
(long-term debt/capital employed).
There are some problems associated with high level of gearing: 1.
A highly geared company is subject to financial risk.
2.
There is an increased possibility of bankruptcy risk.
533.
Due to high levels of financial and bankruptcy risk a firm is exposed to, its equity shares stock market prices will be quoted less.
4.
The profitability and earnings of the company will be threatened due to changes in interest rates of different debt components.
If the level of gearing increases, the expected return of equity shareholders will also increase along with the increase in financial risk and bankruptcy risk.
The expectation of providers will also be more to compensate for taking higher levels of financial risk and bankruptcy risks.
Gearing and Cost of Capital Empirically, the proportion of debt in a firm’s capital structure has relatively little impact on the cost of capital.
Graphically WACC (%) 30 20 10 0 25 50 75 100 Level of Gearing (%) So long as the existing gearing of the company is within the optimum range say 30% and 60%, the proportion of debt in a company’s capital structure has little effect on a company’s cost of capital.
Gearing and EPS 54Gearing has considerable effect on the earnings attributable to the equity shareholders.
A highly geared firm must earn enough profits to cover the interest on debt before any profits available for distribution to the equity holders.
Illustration 5.1 Dauda Ltd is setting a project with a cost of N5,000,000.
It is considering the following three alternatives for financing project: Alternatives 1 2 3 Equity 5,000,000 4,000,000 2,000,000 Debt (15%) - 1,000,000 3,000,000 5,000,000 5,000,000 5,000,000 The company estimated earnings per year N2,000,000, the corporate tax is 40%.
Calculate the earnings per share in the three different alternatives.
Solution 1 2 3 N N N Earnings before interest and tax 2,000,000 2,000,000 2,000,000 Less: Interest 15% - 150,000 450,000 2,000,000 1,850,000 1,550,000 Less: Corporate tax 40% 800,000 740,000 620,000 Net profit after interest and tax 1,200,000 1,110,000 930,000 EPS 2.4 2.8 4.65 From the above illustration, high levels of gearing leads to an increase in EPS for equity shareholders.
Meanwhile, the debt in capital structure increases the risk of equity shareholders.
5.5 SUMMARY The debt component should be used in capital structure to enhance the return to the equity shareholders which is termed trading on equity.
Also, gearing represents the ratio which shows the proportion of debt capital in a firm’s capital structure relative to its equity finance.

6.1 INTRODUCTION Dividend theory (Policy) tries to provide answer to the questions; which is better “the payment of dividend now or the retention of earnings for capital gain?” This theory explores the possibility of attaining an optimum dividend payout ratio that maximizes the combined value of dividends paid plus capital gain.
Dividend policy has been considered very important in the firm’s objective of maximizing shareholders wealth.
Dividends paid out to the shareholders represents cash outflow which depletes the available cash resources.
The reduction in the available cash will have implication on the investment opportunities of the firm because investment projects of the firm also heavily depend on the available cash resources.
The financial manager of a company therefore has a role of striking a balance between dividend payout and retention of earnings, though the two serve the same purpose of maximizing the shareholders’ wealth.
While retained earnings are used to finance expansion, dividends payment increases the purchasing power of the shareholders.
Although dividend and retained profits move in opposite directions they still go hand in hand.
It is impossible to formulate one without having an effect on the other.
A company must watch the profit distributed to the shareholders (dividends) to satisfy the minimum required internally generated funds to take care of investment opportunities and also it must restrict it self- financing through retained profits at least to the extent that it must satisfy a minimum requirement for dividends.
576.2 FACTORS DETERMINING THE DIVIDEND DECISIONS 1.
Legal Provisions : Company law allows the payment of dividend only out of distributable profits, calculated on conventional accounting principles.
(a) profits arising from the use of the company properly although it is a wasting asset; (b)revenue reserves; (c) realized profit on a fixed assed sold These are distributable profits to the shareholders, it is forbidden to distribute dividend out of capital (Section 379 – 382 of CAMD).
As per the provisions, a company must transfer a certain percentage of profits of current year to reserves before declaring a dividend.
2.
Liquidity: A company will be unable to pay a dividend if cash is not available to do so.
A company requires cash in order to pay dividend.
The liquidity position of the company will influence the dividend payout of a particular year.
It is noteworthy that the availability of cash only induces dividend payout, a company may borrow e.g.
by bank overdraft to meet up with dividend requirements if cash is not available.
3.
Government: Government through some guidelines restricts the amount of dividend payable to shareholders by restricting dividend payment to a certain percentage of the profits after tax.
However, from 1988 dividend payment has been deregulated.
4.
Internal Re-investment Opportunities : When a company is faced with viable investment opportunities to be financed by only external funds which is not available or only available by submitting strict business terms on conditions or by incurring high transaction costs, then the company may have to fore-go the payment of dividend.
Dividend may have to be restricted to provide financing for such investments.
5.
Loan Redemption : If debentures or preference share capital are due for redemption, it will require funds and might cause a reduction in the level of dividend payout.
6.
The Risk Factor : Where a company is high business and financial risk inherent, it may have to offer higher dividend rates in order to encourage investors to undertake the risk involved.
587.
Taxation: Shareholders in high income bracket will require to receive their returns in the form of capital profit because of the high tax rate their high incomes may be subjected to but shareholders in low income bracket will be pleased to receive annual returns as high as expected since they are indifferent.
8.
Level of Inflation : As the level of inflation rises, shareholders would expect commensurate increase in dividends.
9.
Control : If a high level of dividend is paid, a company might be forced to issue new share capital to raise finance.
This can have the effect of reducing the control of the company by existing shareholders.
If control is a significant factor, dividend payouts are liable to be relatively low.
10. Dividend Policy of Similar Companies : In dividend decisions, companies tend to follow the policy of a similar company.
6.3 DIVIDEND SUPREMACY OR RELEVANCY THEORY The proponents of this theory, Professor James E. Walter and M.J. Gordon (1959) argued that dividends were all that mattered in the determination of share prices.
It is based on the fundamental theory of share values.
(a) the market value of a company’s shares depends on (i) the size of dividends paid (ii) the growth rate in dividends (iii) the shareholders’ required rate of return.
(b) the growth rate in dividends depends on return on investment and the rate of earnings retained.
(c) Shareholders will want their company to pursue a retention policy that maximizes the value of their shares.
Assumptions of Dividend Relevance Theory 1.
The firm finances all investments through retained earnings.
2.
The firm maintains constant IRR and WACC.
593.
All earnings are either distributed as dividends or reinvested internally immediately.
4.
The corporate tax does not exist.
6.4 DIVIDEND IRRELEVANCY THEORY In 1961, Franco Modigliani and Melton H. Miller (M-M) argued against the claim that an active dividend policy should be pursued as a means of maximizing shareholders wealth.
Their argument is that the value of a firm is unaffected by dividend policy and that in a tax-free world, shareholders are indifferent between dividends and capital gains.
They presented the following points to strengthen their arguments: 1.
If earnings were distributed as dividends, each existing shareholders would gain the exact amount paid to him in terms of income but would suffer a proportionate loss in the form of reduction in his relative share of the company.
This is so because the absence of retained earnings implied that new shares or loan stocks would have to be issued to finance an internal investment programme.
On the other hand, earning retention will cause the value of existing shares to appreciate since new investment would be financed without resulting to supplementary issues.
So, shareholders should be indifferent between payment of dividend and retained earnings.
2.
When a firm adopts a dividend policy, it may be to the detriment of the shareholders by way of jeopardizing their consumption preference.
If a firm pays more cash dividends than an investor needed for immediate consumption, he would return the surplus by buying extra shares with the fund.
If fewer dividends are declared, he could attain his consumption level by selling a proportionate fraction of his total shares in the market.
Therefore, shareholders should be indifferent between payment of dividend and retained earnings.
3.
MM pointed out that investors are indifferent as to the manner in which the returns are obtained, dividends or capital gains.
The changes in dividend payments represent a signal to investors concerning management’s assessment of the future earnings and cash flows of the company.
4.
They argued that if a company with investment opportunities decides to pay a dividend, so that retained earnings are insufficient to finance all the investments, obtaining additional funds from outside sources would make up the shortfall in funds.
The consequent loss of value in the existing shares, as a result of obtaining finance instead of using retained earnings is 60exactly equal to the amount of the dividend paid.
A company should therefore be indifferent between paying a dividend and retained earnings.
Assumptions of the MM Theory 18.There is perfect capital market where investors act rationally and have access to perfect and costless information.
19.
No floatation cost on securities issued by a company.
20.
Risks of uncertainty do not exist.
21.
No taxation.
Or if there is taxation, the same tax rate is applicable to capital gain and dividend income.
22.The company will maintain a fixed investment policy.
6.5 OTHER THEORIES OF DIVIDEND (a)Active Theory of Dividends Under this theory dividends are accorded priority before the company will commit itself to its capital needs.
It follows therefore that viable projects can be undertaken only after the payment of dividends.
(b)Residual Theory of Dividends According to this theory, a firm should execute all positive NPV projects before giving consideration to the payment of dividends.
Before funds could be used in dividend payment, the firm must ensure that all viable projects have been undertaken.
(c) 100% payout Theory Rubner (1966) registered his opinion through this theory.
This theory advocates a policy of 100% payout: The argument is that shareholders prefer dividends and that 100% payout should be made to individuals.
(d)100% Retention Theory Clarkson and Elliot (1969) put forth their argument that given taxation and transaction costs, dividends are a luxury that neither shareholders nor companies can afford and hence the firm can follow a dividend policy of 100% retention.
(e) Investor Rationality Theory This theory is based on the psychological preferences of individual investor.
The investor can select dividend payout ratio that conforms to his/ her desired consumption level.
61(f) Tax Differential Theory According to this theory, dividends are effectively taxed at higher rates than capital gains.
Investors therefore require higher rates of return on stocks with high dividend yields.
A firm should pay a low (or zero) dividend in order to minimize its cost of capital and maximize its value.
6.6 SUMMARY Dividend depletes the cash resources which can otherwise be available for the investment in profitable projects.
Dividend policy determines the distribution of net cashflows generated from successful trading between dividend payments and corporate retentions.
Before a company determines its dividend policy, it should consider certain factors.
MM argued that share value is a function of the level of corporate earnings.
If there is a higher dividend pay out, the firm should issue new shares which will depress the stock market price of the share.
The reduction in value of share is just equal to the dividend distributed per share.

63- Impact of dividend policies on value of firm - Various Dividend Policies - Gordon Growth Valuation Model - Walter’s Valuation Model - Dividend Payment Procedure CONTENTS 7.1 Introduction 7.2 Dividend Policies 7.3 Dividend Relevancy Theory – Gordon Growth Valuation Model and Walters Valuation Model 7.4 Dividend Payment Procedure 7.5 Summary 7.6 Self Review Questions 7.1 INTRODUCTION The dividend policy of a firm has been given ample recognition that different theories emanated to prove its relevancy in the determination of the value of firm.
M-M by their theory, dividend irrelevancy theory decried the important role entrusted with dividend policy by dividend Relevancy Theory.
They argued that whatever dividend decisions taken by a firm will have no influence on its share value.
However, we are now much concerned with the dividend relevancy theory.
This theory claims that a company can increase its value by determining and attaining an optimum dividend value of dividends paid plus capital gain.
The dividend relevancy theory applies two models: 1) Gordon Growth Valuation Model 2) Walter’s Valuation Model The important dividend policies generally followed by corporate firms as discussed below.
7.2 DIVIDEND POLICIES Constant Dividend Payout Policy 64This policy is also known as ‘Constant payout ratio method’.
By this method, a fixed percentage of the net earnings is paid every year.
If earning vary, the amount of dividends also varies from year to year.
The company follows a regular practice of retained earnings because there is always a constant gap between earnings per share and dividend per share.
Constant Dividend Rate Policy This advocates the payment of dividend at constant rate even when earnings vary from year to year.
This may be possible only when the earnings pattern of the company does not show wide fluctuation.
Multiple Dividend Increase Policy This is a policy of very consistent but very small dividend increases to give the illusion of movement and growth.
This policy gives a sense of hope to the investors as the market reward consistently increases.
Regular Dividend plus Extra Dividend Policy This policy favours the division of the announced dividends of a firm into a regular and extra dividend.
The regular dividend is the dividend that will continue at the announced level.
The extra dividend payment will be made as circumstances permit.
Uniform Cash Dividend plus Bonus Shares Policy Under this policy, a minimum rate of dividend per share is paid in cash plus bonus shares issued out of accumulated reserves.
However, the issue of bonuses shares depends upon the amount kept in reserves over a period say 3 or 5 years.
7.3 DIVIDEND RELEVANCY THEORY This theory incorporates two models: 1) Gordon’s Growth Valuation Model 2) Walter’s Valuation Model Gordon’s Growth Valuation Model This model stems out of dividend situation with growth.
Dividend relevancy theory takes cognizance of a situation where it is assumed that there is no growth 65in dividend.
Here the market value of a firm is given by the present value of the future dividends paid out to shareholders.
Ideally, dividend is expected to grow.
The Gordon growth model is a theoretical model used to value ordinary equity shares.
The main proposition of the model is that the value of a share reflects the value of future dividends accruing to that share.
Hence, the dividend payments and its growth are relevant in valuation of shares.
Assumptions of Gordon Growth Model 1.
The firm is an all equity firm i.e the firm is not geared.
2.
Retained earnings is the only source of financing 3.
Future annual growth rate dividend is expected to be constant 4.
The growth rate of the firm is the product of retention rate and its return on investment 5.
Corporate taxes do not exist 6.
The retention rate to remain constant.
In valuation of share, MVe = Do (1+g) = D1 Ke – g Ke-g where MVe = Current ex-dividend market price of share Do = Current years dividend D1 = Expected dividend Ke = Cost of equity, capital g = Expected future growth rate of dividends Meanwhile, the model has been criticized on the following grounds: 1.
The constant dividend growth and earnings growth is a fallacy 2.
The model implies that if Do is zero, the value of share is zero 3.
The model ignores the allowance for corporate taxation 4.
The capital gains are ignored by the model Illustration 7.1 Baba Ijebu Ltd is an established company having its share quoted in the major stocks exchanges.
Its share current market price after dividend distributed at the 6621% p.a having a paid up capital of 500,000 of 10k each.
Annual growth rate in dividend expected is 3%.
The expected rate of return on its equity capital is 16%.
Calculate the value of Baba Ijebu Ltd’s share based on divided growth model.
Solution MVe = Do (1+g) Ke - g Dividend distributed = 5000,000k x 21 = 1,050,000 100 MVe = 1,050,000 (1 + 0.03) = 8,319,231k 0.16 – 0.03 Value per share = 8,319,231 = 16.64k 500,000 Illustration 7.2 The shares of a gas company are selling at N20 per share.
The firm had paid dividend @ N2 per share last year.
i) Determine the cost equity capital of the company ii) Determine the estimated market price of the equity share if the anticipated growth rate of the firm (a) rises to 8% (b) fall to 3% Solution i) Ke = Do (1 + g) + g MVe Ke = 2(1 + 0.05) + 0.05 = 15.5% 20 ii)a.
If the growth rate raises to 8% MVe = 2(1 + 0.08) = N28.8 0.155 – 0.08 b.
If growth rate falls to 3% 2(1 + 0.03) = 2.06 = 16.48 0.155 – 0.03 0.155 – 0.03 67Illustration 7.3 Ogbogbon Ltd is foreseeing a growth rate of 12% per annum in the next 2 years.
The growth rate is likely to fall to 10% for the third year and fourth year.
After that the growth rate is expected to stabilize at 8% per annum.
If the last dividend paid was N1.50 per share and the investor’s required rate of return is 16%, find out the intrinsic value per share of Ogbogbon Ltd as of date.
Solution Years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Discount factor @ 16% 1 0.86 0.74 0.64 0.55 0.48 Calculation of Present Value of Dividend i) @ 12% p.a in the first 2 years = [1.88 (1.1) x 0.64] + [1.88 (1.1)2 x 0.55] = 1.32 + 1.25 = 2.57 ii)Market value of equity share at the end of 4th year P4 = Ds Ke – g Where P4 = Market price of equity share at the end of 4th year Ds = Dividend in 5th year g = Growth rate Ke = required rate of return P4= 2.28(1+0.08) = N30.75 0.16 – 0.08 Present value of P4 = 30.75 x 0.55 = N16.91 Intrinsic value of equity share = 2.83 + 2.57 + 16.91 = N22.31 Illustration 7.4 PS Plc expects to achieve earnings next year of N2.4m and these will continue in perpetuity without any growth at all, unless a proportion of earnings are retained.
If the company retains Y3 of its earnings an annual growth rate in earning and dividends of 9% p.a in perpetuity could be achieved.
Alternatively, if the company were to retain 2/3 of its earnings an annual growth rate in earnings and dividends of 12% p.a in perpetuity could be achieved.
The return currently required by PS Plc shareholders is 16%.
If retentions of 1/3 were 68made, the required return would rise to 19% and if retentions were 2/3 of earnings, the return required would be 24%.
Required a) No retention Ke = d MVe MVe = d Ke MVe = 2,400,000 = N15m 0.16 b) Retention 1/3 Growth 9% p.a Ke = do (1+g) + g MVe MVe = do (1+g) Ke-g MVe = 1,6000,000 = N16m 0.19 – 0.09 c) Retention 2/3 growth 12% p.a MVc = 800,000 = N6,666,667 0.24 - 0.12 Walter’s Valuation Model Walter argued that retention influence stock price only through their effect on future dividends.
The model recognizes the importance of internal rate of return and cost of capital for valuation of shares and dividend decisions.
The optimum dividend policy of a firm by this model is determined by the relationship of rate of return on firm’s investment and cost of equity capital.
Under this model, the determination of expected market price on a share is given as: Mr = D + r (E – D) a r c where Mr = current market price of equity share E = Earnings per share D = Dividend per share (E – D) = Retained earnings per share ra = rate of return on firm’s investment 69rc = cost of equity capital.
Walter’s model implies that: a) If ra > rc i.e if the firm can earn higher IRR then cost of capital, the firm can return the earnings.
When ra > rc, the price per share increases as the dividend payout ratio decreases.
The optimal payout ratio when ra>rc is nil (zero) because shareholders would accept low dividends.
b) When ra<rc i.e.
the cost of capital is more than firm’s IRR, the optimum dividend policy would be to distribute the entire earnings as dividend.
When ra < rc, the price per share increases and the dividend payout ratio increases.
Shareholders would vote for higher dividend so that they can utilize the more profitable investment opportunities.
c) If ra = rc i.e.
If IRR of the firm is equal to its cost of capital, the price per share does not vary with changes in dividend payout ratio.
The optimal payout ratio is irrelevant and it does not matter whether the earning is retained or distributed.
Assumptions of Walter’s Valuation Model 1) Retained earning is the only source of finance 2) Business risk is constant 3) Return on investment is constant 4) The firm is a going-concern 5) All earnings are either distributed as dividends or invested internally immediately.
Illustration 7.5 The earnings per share of a company is N8 and the rate of capitalisation applicable is 10%.
The company has before if an option of adopting (i) 50% (ii) 75% and (iii) 100% dividend payout ratio.
Compute the market price of the company’s quoted shares if it can earn a return of (a) 15% (b) 10% and (c) 5% on its retained earnings.

Declaration Date : It is the date in which the forthcoming dividend is announced Date of Record: This designates when share transfer book are to be closed Ex-div date: This is the date when the shareholders register is closed for the transfer of shares.
Purchase of shares after this date confers collection of dividend on the old owner or seller.
Dividend Notice : This shows the amount of dividend payable after deducting appropriate withholding taxes.
Payment date: this is the day dividend cheques are mailed out.
7.5 SUMMARY Gordon Growth Valuation Model progress that the value of a share reflects the value of future dividends accruing to that share and the market price of the share is equal to the sum of its discounted future dividend payments.
Walter’s Model Assets that in the long-run the share prices reflect only the present value of expected dividends and the retentions influence share price only through their effect on future dividends.
According to Walter, the optimum dividend policy of a firm is determined by the relationship of firm’s IRR and its cost of capital.
7.6 SELF REVIEW QUESTIONS 72- Dividend growth valuation Model’s proposition is that value of a share reflects the value of future dividends accruing to that share.

Projects are basically capital investments.
Capital investment decisions border on capital expenditures which involve large some of money, have long time spans and carry some degree of risk and uncertainty.
The planning and control of capital expenditure is termed capital budgeting.
Capital budgeting is the art of finding assets that are worth more than they cost to optimize the wealth of a business enterprise.
For making a radical decision regarding the capital investment proposals at hand, the decision maker needs some techniques to convert the cash outflows and cash inflows of a project into meaningful yardsticks which can measure the economic worthiness of projects.
8.2 TYPES OF PROJECTS Classification of project has been done based on the following criteria: 74(i)Purpose (ii) Size (iii) Ownership (i) Depending on the purpose, the projects can be classified as follows: (a) Balancing Project Balancing equipment is installed when there is imbalanced capacity utilization of the plant and machinery due to unutilized capacity in some units.
(b) Replacement Project If any equipment is deteriorated due to obsolescence or is no longer economically useful, it is replaced with a new equipment which may be equivalent to old machine or it may also be more efficient than the old one.
Replacement project is considered in respect of individual machine.
(c) Expansion Project When the current production levels of existing plant could not meet the growing demand for the product in the market, and such growth is of permanent nature, the management would decide to increase the capacity of the plant by installing additional equipment and facilitator thereby the total production in increased.
(d) Diversification Project When a firm invest in project which is not connected with the existing line of business but to entirely setup a new project.
Such a project is called a diversification project.
(e) Due to technological development, wear and tear, the old plant and machinery that was installed several years back, would require modernization.
8.3 CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROCESS The strategic capital investment process is discussed below: 75- Search for Investment Opportunities : This first thing to do is recognizing the investment opportunities.
This involves a continuous search for investment opportunities which are compatible with the firm’s objectives.
Although business may pursue many goods, survival and profitability are two most important objectives.
- Screening the Alternatives : Each proposal is then subjected to screening process in order t assess whether it is technically feasible, resources required are available and the expected returns are adequate to compensate for the risks involved.
The alternatives will be screened and it is neither feasible nor desirable to conduct a full scale evaluation of opportunities.
- Analysis of Feasible Alternatives: If a proposal satisfies the screening process, it is then analysed in more detail by gathering technical, economic and other data.
Projects are also classified into new projects, expansions or improvements and ranked within each classification with respect of probability, risk and degree of urgency.
- Evaluation of Alternatives : This stage will involve the determination of proposal and its investments, inflows and outflows.
The technique selected should be the one which enables a manager to make the best decision in the light of prevailing circumstances.
- Authorization: One evaluation is completed then proposal will be forwarded to a higher level of management for authorization to take up the project.
- Implementation and Control: The project will be implemented and its progress is monitored with the aid of feedback reports.
These reports will include critical path analysis, capital expenditure progress reports, performance reports, conquering actual performance against plans set.
8.4 NEW CONCEPTS IN FINANCING AND EXECUTION OF PROJECTS - Build, Own and Operate (B.O.O): Here, the entrepreneur will build the project from his own resources and he will own the project subsequent to its commercial launching.
- Build, Operate and Transfer (B.O.T): When the government is unable to finance a project due to scarcity of funds, the private sector is invited by the government to undertake the project and the government allows them to 76operate for certain period after which the project is transferred to the government.
- Lease, Rehabilitate, Operate and Transfer (L.R.O.T): Here, the government will give a running plant for rehabilitation to put the plant on profitability track or for increasing its production capacity.
- Engineering, Procurement and Construct (E.P.C): Here, the contractor takes the complete responsibility to construct, erect, commission and supply the plant and keeps it ready to operate by the owners.
The contractor carries the responsibility of providing engineering designs, procurement of materials, erection and commissioning the project and handing over to the owner.
- Turnkey Contract : When a project is handled and completed by a single contractor so that the owner merely turns the key and operates the plant, it is called turnkey contract.
Turnkey contract may help in cutting down the number of responsibility centres to the extent of one.
If reduces the number of agencies the owner is required to coordinate.
8.5 SUMMARY Capital investment involves a cash outflow in the immediate future in anticipation of returns at future date.
It involves huge amounts of money and having a long span of time for cash inflow and carry some degrees of risk and uncertainty with the cashflows.
The capital investment process involves search for investment opportunities, screening and evaluation of alternatives and selection of right alternative for implementation.

The matrix organisation seeks to achieve twin objective of official use of resources and effective realization of project objectives.
Task Force Organisation Structure: A task force is created by drawing personnel from various functional departments and putting them under the project manager.
10.3 BENEFITS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT Project management is essentially involved in executing the project and thereby accomplish the goals of the organisation in time.
The benefits of project management are given below.
1) Project management provides techniques for making trade-offs between conflicting goals and enterprises priorities, besides enabling better control and coordination.
2) It helps in minimizing surprises and conflicts 3) It helps in reducing time, lowering costs and producing higher order results 814) It reduces the need for continuous reporting 5) It helps in expressing problems in advance 10.4 SELECTION OF PROJECT LOCATION The following are the factors considered for the selection of location for setting up a project.
1) Proximity of Inputs: In some industries, bulky raw materials are used as inputs in the process and such industries will come up near their input source.
2) Proximity of Market: Market may be a determining factor of a project’s location because setting of such a project may be very important.
Project Market may be a determining factor of a project’s location because setting of such a project may be very important.
Project which manufacture perishable products are located near the places of consumption.
3) Availability of Power: Before deciding the location of a project, it is to verified about the adequate power supply.
The cost of power will play a major role in selection of location for a project 4) Availability of Transport: Adequate transport facilities are required for movement of input and output.
The project site should be well connected my rail, road sea and air transport facilities.
5) Communication facilities: The project site must be located where all modern communication facilities like telephone, telex, fax, internet, etc are available 6) Manpower availability 10.5 CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY The following factors will influence in the choice of technology 1) Plant capacity: To meet a given capacity requirement perhaps only a certain production technology may be viable.
822) Principal Inputs: The choice of technology depends on the principal inputs available for the project.
3) Investment Outlay and Production Costs: The effect of alternative technologies on investment outlay and production cost over a period of time should be carefully assessed.
4) Inlay by other units: The technology adopted must be proven by successful use by other units 5) Production mix: The technology chosen must be judged in terms of the total product-mix generated by it, including saleable by-products 6) Latest Developments: The technology adopted must be based on latest developments in order to ensure that the likelihood of technological obsolescence in the near future is minimized.
7) Ease of absorption – appropriateness: The ease with which a particular technology can be absorbed, can influence the choice of technology.
10.5 SWOT ANALYSIS ‘SWOT’ stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
By conducting SWOT analyses, the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed project is highlighted.
While strength and weaknesses constitute variables of factors which are internal to the proposed project, opportunities and threats constitute those external factors which are usually imposed by the environment with either direct or indirect influence on the project.
Some of the aspects considered in SWOT analysis are as follows: 1.
Internal financial resources 2.
Availability of funds in the capital market 3.
Extent of support from banks and financial institutions 4.
Existing and proposed level of investments and its impact on ROI, EPS and market value of the firm.
5.
The business and financial risk attached to the firm.
6.
Technology developed internally or possibility to obtain reliable technical know-how at cheaper cost.
7.
Brand loyalty of existing products 8.
Source of raw material and other infrastructural facilities.
9.
Market share, distribution network 10.
Severity of completion 8311.
Cost of production and managerial competence 12.
Cost of capital 13.
Governmental clearances and permission 14.
Macro and Micro-economic environment in which the business operates.
10.7 PROJECT VISIBILITY The project activities starts prior to the zero data.
Zero data of a project means a date is fixed up from which the implementation of the projects begins.
A project cannot be seen by the public most of its life time.
A project can be seen by the public only at the end of its implementation stage and recognizes the fact of coming up of a project.
A project becomes visible slowly as it grows, bringing the idea into reality, by using men, machines, money and managerial skill.
10.8 VARIANCE AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 1) Variance analysis: The traditional analysis involves comparison of actual costs with budgeted costs to determine the variance.
This approach is inadequate for project control, because it tells only what happened in the past and does not answer what will happen in future and does not give indications about the rate of work.
2) Performance analysis: This is a modern approach where analysis is done for the project as a whole projects on schedule, behind and ahead of schedule.
It also indicates whether cost of a project as a whole is as per budget.
Illustration 10:1 The following information has been gathered on an on-going project Budgeted cost of work schedule (BCWS) 50 Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) 40 Actual cost of work performed (ACWP) 44 Budgeted cost of total work (BCTW) 100 Additional cost of completion (ACC) 66 Determine: (a) Performance variance (b) Efficiency variance (c) Performance index (d) Efficiency index (e) Estimated cost performance index 84Solution (a) Performance variance = BCWP – BCWS = 40-50 = -10 (b) Efficiency variance = BCWP – ACWP = 40-44 = - 4 (c) Performance index = BCWP/BCWS = 40/50 = 0.80 (d) Efficiency Index = BCWP/ACWP = 40/44 = 0.9091 (e) Estimated cost performance index = BCTW/(ACWPT ACC) = 100/(44+66) = 0.9091 10.9 SUMMARY The capital investment process involves search for investment opportunities, screening and evaluation of alternatives and selection of right alternative for implementation.

Fundamentals of Financial Management (1996) UNIT 11: PROJECT APPRAISAL Learning Objectives After studying this unit, students should have understood: - Need for capital investment appraisal 85- Cashflows associated with the project - Payback period and its reciprocal - Accounting rate of return - Distinction between NPV and IRR - Discounted payback period - Terminal value method CONTENTS 11.1 Introduction 11.2 Investment Appraisal Techniques 11.3 Traditional Techniques 11.4 Discounted Cashflow Techniques 11.5 Summary 11.6 Self-Review Questions 11.1 INTRODUCTION Our major concern here has to do with investment decision and which is called capital expenditure decision and which is under the umbrella of capital budgeting.
Capital budgeting involves all investments in long-term projects.
It is the process of selecting alternatives long-term investment opportunities.
This decision entails scrutiny that tends to find out whether or not money should be invested in long- term projects.
In capital investment decisions, a firm is faced with different alternatives out of which the firm must select these ones that optimize its shareholders’ wealth.
This is done by examining cash generation of the project which is called investment appraisal.
In appraising a project, various techniques have been developed ranging from the traditional to discounted cashflow techniques.
Meanwhile, to permit realistic appraisal, the value of cash payment or receipt, must be related to the time when the transfer takes place.
The process of converting future sums into their present equivalent is known as discounting which is used to determine the present value of future cashflows.
11.2 INVESTMENT APPRAISAL TECHNIQUES There are two method of appraisal i) The traditional technique ii)Discounted cash flow technique 8611.3 THE TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES There are two method, under this technique: a) Payback Period Method b) Accounting Rate of Return Payback Period Method This refers to the length of time which it takes the cash inflows from a capital investment project to equate the cash outflows.
It is usually expressed in years.
It concentrates on how quickly a project repays its outlay.
When deciding between two or more competing projects, the usual decision is to accept the one with the shortest payback.
The basic element of payback period method is a calculation of recovery time by accumulation of the cash inflows year by year until the cash inflows equate the amount of the original investment.
Payback period can be calculated in two ways depending on whether the cashflows are constant or non – constant.
Illustration 11.1 Adamawa Plc is to undertake a project requiring N1,000,000 outlay.
What is Payback period if a) the project generates N250,000 annually b) the project has the following cashflow profile Yr Cashflow 1 200,000 2 220,000 3 230,000 4 220,000 5 195,000 Solution a) Payback period Outlay Annual cashflow = N1,000,000 = 4 years N250,000 87b) Yr Outlay CF Balance 0 (1,000,000) - (1,000,000) 1 200,000(800,000) 2 220,000(580,000) 3 230,000(350,000) 4 220,000(130,000) 5 195,000 - PBP = 4years + 130,000 x 12 195,000 = 4 years, 8 months Decision Rules When it is an independent project: 1) Accept the project if the project ahs a PBP that is equal to or less than that set by the management 2) Reject if the project has a PBP that is greater than that set by the management.
When there are mutually exclusive projects: 1) Choose the project with the least PBP 2) The PBP should be equal to or less than that set by the management Advantages of PBP 1) It is simple to calculate and understand 2) It does not involve assumptions about future interest rates 3) Unlike ARR, it uses cash profit instead of accounting profit 4) It is the most suitable when the future is very uncertain.
Disadvantages 1) It ignores the time value of money 2) There are no rules for setting the maximum accepted PBP by the management 3) It ignores the cashflows after the payback period 884) It makes no attempt to measure a percentage return on the capital invested and is often used in conjunction with other methods.
Payback Period Reciprocal Payback Period Reciprocal = 1 x 100 Payback Period If a project has a payback period of 2.5years i.e.
Payback Period Reciprocal = 1 x 100 = 40% 2.5 The higher the PBP reciprocal, the more worthwhile the project.
Bailout Payback Period If necessary, a machine may have to be scrapped before its payback period.
In this case, the cashflow and the salvage value of the machine is taking together in bailout decision.
Illustration 11.2 Project A costs N200,000 and Project B costs N300,000 both have a ten year life.
Uniform cash receipts expected are A N40,000 p.a.
and B N80,000 p.a.
Salvage values expected are A N140,000 declining at an annual rate of N20,000 and B N160,000 declining at an annual rate of N40,000.
Solution The bail-out payback period is reached when the cumulative cash receipts plus the salvage value at the end of a particular year is equal to the initial investment.
Project A initial investment = N200,000 Cumulative Cashflow + Salvage value End of yr 1 40,000 + 140,000= 180,000 2 80,000 + 120,000= 200,000 Bailout Payback period for A is 2 years Project B initial investment = N300,000 Cumulative Cashflow + Salvage value End of yr 1 80,000 + 160,000= 240,000 2 160,000+ 120,000= 280,000 3 240,000+ 80,000 = 320,000 89Bailout PBP for B is 3 years :.
Therefore Project A is chosen Accounting Rate of Return This technique is assessed by calculating the return on investment (ROI).
It is based on return on capital employed.
It makes use of the accounting concepts of accounting profits and capital employed.
IT can be calculated as follows: ARR = Average Annual Profit After Tax X 100 Average or Initial Investment Average Investment = Initial Investment + Salvage values 2 Sometimes, initial investment is used in place of average investment.
Illustration 11.3 Omotola Plc is to undertake a project requiring an investment of N100,000 on necessary plant and machinery.
The project is to last for 5 years at the end of which the plant and machinery will have net book value of N20,000.
Profit before depreciation are as follows: Yr Profit (N) 1 40,000 2 44,000 3 48,000 4 52,000 5 58,000 1.

Accept if the project ahs an ARR that is equal to or greater than that set by the management 91 2.
Reject if the project has an ATT that is less than that set by the management b) When more than one project is involved Select the project with the highest ARR Advantages of ARR 1.
It is simple to calculate and understand 2.
It considers the profit over the entire life of the project 3.
IT uses ready available accounting date.
4.
It could be used to compare performance for many companies Disadvantages of ARR 1.
It takes no account of the time value of money 2.
It uses accounting profit rather than cash as the measure of benefit 3.
There are no rules for setting the minimum acceptable ARR by the management 4.
There is no clear definition in accounting of profit and capital employed.
11.4 DISCOUNTED CASHFLOW TECHNIQUES These are investment appraisal techniques which use discounted cashflows to evaluate projects.
These techniques involve: a) Net Present Value Method b) Internal Rate of Return Method c) Discounted Payback Period Method d) Terminal Value Method Net Present Value The Net Present Value (NPV) technique recognizes that different naira arising at different time period will not command the same value.
It is obtained by discounting all cash outflows and inflows attributable to a capital investment project by a chosen percentage.
By this method, the net cashflows from the investment is discounted by the minimum required rate of return and the initial investment is deducted to arrive at the NPV.
If the NPV is positive, the project is acceptable but unacceptable is the NPV is negative.
In the discounting process, discounting factor is used: Dcf = 1 (1 + r)n Where dcf = discounting factor r = minimum rate of return 92 n = number of years over which we discounts Illustration 11.4 Semijeje is to undertake a project worth N10m having the following cashflow profile: Yr Cashflows 1 5,000,000 2 6,000,000 3 8,000,000 However, if the discount rate of 25% is applied in order to account for the time value of money, should the project be accepted?
i) Calculation of discounting factor Yr D.F 1 1 = 0.800 (1+0.25) 2 1 = 0.640 (1+0.25)2 3 1 = 0.512 (1+0.25)3 ii)Calculate of NPV Yr CF DCF@25% PV 0 (10,000,000) 1 (10,000,000) 1 5,000,000 0.800 4,000,000 2 6,000,000 0.640 3,840,000 3 8,000,000 0.512 4,096,000 NPV 1,936,000 The project should be accepted.
Decision rules a) For only one project 1) Accept if the project has a positive NPV 2) Reject if the project has a negative NPV b) For more than one project, select the project with the highest NPV 93Advantages of NPV 1.
It recognizes the time value of money 2.
It uses all the cashflows over a project’s lifespan 3.
It gives a clear accept/reject recommendation 4.
It gives absolute measure of profitability Disadvantages of NPV 1.
It is relatively more difficult to calculate and understand 2.
It may not give dependable results 3.
The selection of discounting rate is subjective.
Internal Rate of Return Method (IRR) IRR is the percentage discount rate used in capital investment appraisals which brings the cost of a project and its future cash inflows into equality.
It is the rate of return which equates the present value of anticipated net cashflows with the initial outlay.
It is also known as the cut-off rate, the hurdle rate, the target rate, the marginal efficiently cost of capital etc.
It is the rate at which NPV is equal to zero.
IRR is calculated using a two-step approach.
Step 1: Trial and Error Here, two different rates that will produce two opposing NPVs (one positive and the other negative) are applied.
Step 2: Interpolation From step 1, relevant figures relating to the formula below are applied to generate the IRR.
IRR = R + N x (R – R ) 1 1 2 1 N – (N ) 1 2 where R1 = Lower rate R2 = Higher rate N1 = the NPV of the lower rate N2 = the NPV of the higher rate Illustration 11.5 Calculate the IRR of a project having the following cashflows: Yr NCF 0 (3,610) 941 1,000 2 2,000 3 3,000 Solution Trial and Error YrNCF DCF@15% PV DCF@26% PV 0 (3,610) 1 (3,610) 1 (3,610) 1 1000 0.87 870 0.79 790 2 2000 0.76 1520 0.63 1,260 3 3000 0.66 1980 0.50 1,500 760 (60) Interpolation IRR = R + N x (R – R ) 1 1 2 1 N – (N ) 1 2 R1 = 15, R2 = 26, N1 = 760, (N2) = (60) :.
Irr = 15 + 760 x (26-15) 760 – (-60) = 15 + 760 x 11 820 = 15 + 10.2 = 25.20% Decision rules a) In a case of only one project: to accept a project, if it has an IRR that is greater than the cut-off rate stipulated by the management or if its IRR is higher than the cost of borrowing.
b) In a case of more than one project.
Select the projects that have an IRR that is greater than the cut-off rate indicated.
Discounted Payback Period Method In this method, the cashflows generated from a project are discounted back to present value term.
The discounted cash inflows are then matched with the original investment in order to identify the period taken to payback the outlay.
This method overcomes the shortcoming of not accounting for the time value of money but it 95still does not take into account those cashflows which occur subsequent to the payback period.
Illustration 11.6 Gateway Ltd is implementing a project with an initial capital outlay of N7,600.
Its cash inflows are as follows Yr 1 2 3 4 Cashflows (N) 6,000 2,000 1,000 5,000 The expected rate of return on the capital invested is 12% p.a.
Calculate the discounted payback period of the project Yr Cash inflow Discount factor Present value N N 1 6,000 0.893 5,358 2 2,000 0.797 1,594 3 1,000 0.712 712 4 5,000 0.636 3180 NPV 10,844 The discounted PBP is 3 years i.e 5358 + 1594 = 712 Terminal Value Method Under this method it is assumed that each cashflow is re-invested in another project at a predetermined rate of interest.
It is also assumed that each cash inflow is reinvested elsewhere immediately until the termination of the project.
The present value of the sum total of the compounded reinvested cashflows is greater compared with the values of the original outlay.
Illustration 11.7 Original outlay N8,000 Life of the project 3 years Cash inflows N4000 p.a for 3 years Cost of capital 10% p.a.

11.5 SUMMARY In appraising a project, various techniques have been developed ranging from the traditional to the discounted cashflows techniques.
The traditional techniques do not take into account the time value of money.
However, under the discounted cashflow techniques, the future net cashflows generated by a capital project are discounted to ascertain their present values.

The term risk is used to describe an option where the outcome is not known with certainty in advance but the probability of its occurrence ranges between 0 and 1.
It implies the possibility of receiving lower than expected return on investment or not receiving any return at all or even not getting the principal amount back.
The difference between risk and uncertainty has been that, uncertainty cannot be quantified while risk can be quantified of the likelihood of future outcomes.
Risk denotes a positive probability of something bad happening while uncertainty does not necessarily imply a value judgment or ranking of the possible outcomes.
Therefore, risk is present when future events occur with measurable probability.
On the other hand, uncertainty is present when the likelihood of future events is indefinite or incalculable.
12.2 RISK AND RETURN OF A SINGLE ASSET Return of an Asset A firm’s investment’s should earn reasonable and expected rate of return.
Certain investments like bank deposits, debentures, bonds etc carry a fixed rate of return payable periodically.
In case of investments in shares of companies, the 99periodically payments in the form of dividends are not assured, though it may ensure higher returns than fixed income investments.
The rate of return of a particular investment is calculate as follows: R = D + P1 – P2 Po Po where R = Annual rate of return of a share D = Dividend paid at the end of the year Po = Market price of share at the beginning of the year P1 = Market price of share at the end of the year In the above formula, D/Po represents dividend yield and (P1 – Po) represents capital gain or loss Po Illustration 12.1 Mr Ororun has purchased 100 shares of N10 each of Kinetic Ltd in 2001 at N78 per share.
The company has declared a dividend @ 40% for the year 2008-9.
The market price of share as at 1-4-2008 was N104 and on 31-3-2009 was N128.
Calculate the annual return on the investment for the year 2008-9.
Solution Dividend received = N10 x 40/100 = N4 R = D + P1 – Po = 4 + 4 (128-104) = 0.2692 or 26.92% Po Po 104 104 Risk of an Asset Risk has been statistically express in terms of standard deviation of return.
The mean of the probable returns gives the expected rate of return and the standard deviation or variance measures risk.
Low standard deviation means low risk and a risk averse investor will look for return where the range is low.
Risk is therefore equaled with volatility in expected returns.

Expected return is the ate of return on investment attached with associated probabilities.
E(R) = PR = probability X returns Illustration 12.3 The possible returns and associated probabilities of securities X and Y are given below: Security X Security Y Probability Return (%) Probability Return(%)0.05 0.10 5 6 1010.15 10 0.20 8 0.40 15 0.30 12 0.25 18 0.25 15 0.10 20 0.10 18 0.05 24 0.05 20 Calculate the expected return and standard deviation of security X and Y.

Security A has higher expected return and lower level of risk as compared to security Y.
12.3 RISK AND RETURN OF A PORTFOLIO A portfolio is a collection of securities 1) Two-Asset Portfolio Return The expected return from a portfolio of two or more securities is equal to the sum of the weighted returns from the individual securities.
E(Rp) = W (R ) + W (B ) A A B B where (E(Rp) = Expected return from a portfolio W = Proportion of wealth/funds invested in security A A W = Proportion of funds invested in security B B R = Expected return of security A A R = Expected return of security B B W + W = 1 or 100% A B Illustration 12.4 A company’s share gives a return of 20% and B company’s share gives 32% return.
Mr Otunba invested 25% in A’s shares and 75% of B’s shares.
What would be the expected return of the portfolio.
Portfolio Return Hp = E(Rp) = W (R ) + W (B ) A A B B = 0.25 (20) + 0.75 (32) = 29% Risk of Two-Asset Portfolio The securities consisting in a portfolio are associated with each other.
So, in determining the portfolio risk, the covariance between the returns of the investments is considered.
Covariance of two securities is a measure of their co- movement.
It is the degree to which the securities vary together.
The risk of two-asset portfolio is given them σp = W 2 σ 2 + W σ 2 + 2 W W R σ σ A A B A A B AB A B where σp = Standard deviation of the portfolio W = Proportion of funds invested in security A A 103W = Proportion of funds invested in security B B σ = Standard deviation of security A A σ = Standard deviation of security B B r = correlation coefficient between A and B AB The correlation coefficient is given as r = Cov AB AB R R A B where Cov = NEAB – (EA) (EB) = P(A-A) (B – B) AB where N = number of observation E = summation The degree of correlation between securities is very important in portfolio selection because it dictates how possible it is to diversify risk (unsystematic).

Minimization of portfolio risk is attainable by selecting negatively correlated securities.
The diversification of unsystematic risk using two security portfolio depends upon the correlation that exists between the returns of those two securities.
Optimal portfolio can be achieved where: WA = σ 2 - Cov B AB σ 2 + σ 2 – 2 Cov A B AB Note that where W is the proportion of funds invested in security A, then the A proportion invested in B is 1 – W = W A B 12.4 PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION AND RISK Diversification can be regarded as a strategy adopted by rational investors by spreading and committing their funds in several investments in such a way that if a given line goes bad such an investor, a portfolio is held by an investor in order to diversify risk.
And in order to diversify risk for the creation of an efficient portfolio (one that allow the firm to achieve the maximum return for a given level of risk or to minimize risk for a given level of return) the concept of correlation must be understood.
In a portfolio consisting of two securities, if the two securities move together, they are positively correlated.
If they move in opposite directions, they are negatively correlated.
The existence of perfectly correlated (where r = 1 or -1) is rare.
In order to diversify risk and thereby reduce the firm’s overall risk, the projects that are best combined or added to the existing portfolio of projects are those that have negative correlation of A and B.
If R = 1 No unsystematic risk can be diversified AB R = -1 All systematic risk can be diversified AB R = 0 No correlation between the returns of A and B. AB Note that r -1 ≤ r ≤1 Ab Also, combining projects with correlations falling between perfect positive correlation (r = 1) and perfect negative correlation (r = -1) can reduce the AB AB overall risk of a portfolio.
10612.5 INDIFFERENCE CURVES AND INVESTOR’S ATTITUDE The indifference curve is the curve which shows the combination of expected return and risk that the individual investor will find to be of equal benefit.
It shows the different combinations of risk and return which will leave individual equally satisfied.
All the points lying on a given indifference curve offer the same level of satisfaction.
Return A B C Efficient Frontier Available portfolios Risk Fig A. Indifference Curve Compared Np A B 107 σp Fig B The indifference curves shows here are typical in that every point on each curve has a higher expected return or a lower risk than other points on the curve.
Also, an investor would choose combination of risk and expected return on one curve with equal indifference, but he would prefer combination of return and risk on indifference curve A than on B because curve A offers higher returns for the same degree or risk and less risk for the same amount of expected returns).
In Fig A, An investor would prefer a portfolio of investments on indifference curve A to a portfolio on curve B, which in turn is preferable to a portfolio on curve C. 12.6 RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP The risk and return constitute the framework for taking investment decision.
Dealing with the return to be achieved requires estimate of the return on investment over the time period.
Risk denotes deviation of actual return from the estimated return, This deviation of actual return from expected return may be on either side.
However investor’s are concerned with the downside risk.
The risk under consideration is made up of two parts.
1.
Unsystematic risk 2.
Systematic risk 1.
Unsystematic risk is also known as diversifiable, unique, specific, residual and non-market risk.
It is caused by events such as: i.
Quality of management ii.
Location iii.Nature of products This part of risk is internal and is related to the firm and industry.
2.
Systematic risk is also known as non-diversifiable, non-specific, general and market risk.
It is caused by events such as: i.
Inflation ii.
Economic problems iii.Political problems iv.War v. Death of the president 108This is also known as unavoidable risk and it is external to the firm and industry.
The risk and return tends to be positively related.
Risk assures exogenous position in risk-return function while return depends on risk level for its determination.
It is generally believed that there is consistently risk-return trade-off i.e.
the greater the risk accepted, the greater must be the potential return as reward for committing ones funds to an uncertain outcome.
12.7 SUMMARY Uncertainty means it is not known exactly what will happen in future and it cannot be quantified, while risk means future happening can be assumed under probability and the likelihood of future outcomes can be quantified.
The risk of an asset is expressed in terms of standard deviation.
The mean of the probable return gives the expected rate of return and the standard deviation measures the risk.
The expected return from a portfolio of two or more securities is equal to the weighted average of the expected returns from the individual securities.

Fundamentals of Financial Management (1996) 109UNIT 13: CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL Learning Objectives In the end of this unit, students must have understood: - The meaning of Capital Asset pricing Model (CAPM) - Classification of risks into systematic and unsystematic risks - Distinction between Security Market Line and Characteristics Line - Determination of Beta coefficient 110- Risk – return trade - off using CAPM - Use of Arbitrage Pricing Model in ascertainment of expected return CONTENTS 13.1 Introduction 13.2 Classification of Risks 13.3 Assumptions of CAPM 13.4 Beta Factor 13.5 Security Market Line 13.6 Capital Market Line 13.7 Efficient Frontier 13.8 Limitations of CAPM 13.9 Arbitrage Pricing Model 13.10 Summary 13.11 Self Review Questions 13.1 INTRODUCTION The Capital Asset Pricing Model was developed by three economists W.F Sharpe, J.N Linter and Jack Treynor between 1965 and 11966 in an attempt to simplify the assumption of portfolio theory as they relate to investment in securities.
The model is based on the portfolio theory developed by Harry Markowitz.
It emphasizes that the risk factor in portfolio theory is a combination of two risks i.e systematic risk and unsystematic risk.
And that the combination of both types of risk provides total risk.
.
: Total risk = systematic risk + unsystematic risk This model also suggests that a security’s return is directly related to its systematic risk which cannot be neutralized through diversification.
So, the total variance (risk) is equal to market related variance plus company’s specific variance.
The model employs beta coefficient (B).
A risk free security has a B of O, while the risk premium is also O. the market portfolio has a B of 1 and a risk premium of ( Rm – Rf ).
A problem arises as regards the risk premium if a security does not have a B of O or 1. this is what the CAPM attempts to solve.
13.2 CLASSIFICATION OF RISKS According to the CAPM’s theorists, the risk associated with portfolio rate of return can be decomposed into two: i) Systematic risk 111ii) Unsystematic risk i) Systematic Risk Systematic risk arises out of external and uncontrollable factors.
It is the portion of total variation in return caused by factors that affect the price of all securities.
The movement or variation is generally due to the response to economic, social and political changes.
This risk cannot be avoided because it relates to economic trends which affect the whole market.
During economic boom, prices of all stocks indicate rising trend and in recession, the prices of all stocks will be falling.
This type of risk is associated with the following factors: a) Market Risk: This is in connection with changes in demand and supply, expectations of the investors, information flow, investor’s risk perception, variation in price caused by social, political and economic events is referred to as market risk.
b) Interest Rate Risk: Generally price of securities tend to move universally with changes in the rate of interest.
The return on investment depends on the market rate of interest.
Also, the cost of corporate debt depends on the interest rates prevailing, maturing periods e.t.c.
The uncertainty of future market value caused by fluctuations in the general level of interest is known as interest rate risk.
c) Purchasing Power Risk: This is a risk due to inflation.
The risk in prices due to inflation will cause increase in cost of production and reduction in profit due to lower margins.
The investor’s expectations will also change with the changes in the levels of purchasing power.
This risk is inherent in all securities and it is uncontrollable by the individual investors.
ii) Unsystematic Risk This is that portion of total risk which results from known and controllable factors.
All the factors responsible for this risk are related to the firm or industry.
Unsystematic risk is specific to individual stocks and can be diversified as the investor increases the number of stocks in his or her portfolio.
Investors are not compensated for unsystematic risk because they are expected to be rational in holding diversified portfolio to diversify away risk.
While systematic risk attributable to broad macro factors affecting securities, unsystematic risk is attributable to factors unique to a security.
The following factors are possible for unsystematic risk: a) Business Risk: Business risk is associated with volatility of revenue and profits of a particular company due to its market conditions, product mix, labour 112supply e.t.c.
It has to do with the efficiency with which a firm conducts its operations within the broader environment.
b) Financial Risk: This risk is associated with the financing activities of the firm.
It is associated with the capital structure of the firm.
An ungeared company has no financial risk.
Financial risk will also arise due to short – term liquidity problems, shortage of working capital, bad debt e.t.c.
c) Default Risk: The default risk arises due to default in meeting the financial obligations as and when due for payment.
13.3 ASSUMPTION OF CAPM 1.
Investors are rational and risk averse.
2.
Investors seek to maximize utility which is a function of risk and expected return.
3.
Risk is measured by the standard deviation of returns.
4.
There is a linear relationship between the return obtained from an individual security and the average rate of return from all securities in market.
5.
The stock market is efficient ( i.e security values reflect all known information, which is available to all investors at no cost).
No individual investor dominates the market.
6.
All investors can borrow and lend infinitely large sum of money at the same risk free rate.
7.
There is no taxation.
8.
There are no transaction costs.
9.
All investors view securities in the same way with respect to return, risk and correlation with other securities.
Investor’s expectations are homogeneous.
10.The CAPM is a one – period model.
Though it is not useless in multi – period situation.
13.4 BETA FACTOR CAPM states that an investor shall: 1. not be rewarded if he accepts alpha (unsystematic) risk because it is avoidable 2. be rewarded if he undertakes beta (systematic) risk because it is unavoidable.
113Beta is a measure of the systematic risk of a security that cannot be avoided through diversification.
It is a measure of risk of an individual stock relative to the market portfolio of all stocks.
The formula for beta (b ) is made of two parts; • The risk free rate • The risk premium So, E (Ri) = Rf + Bi [E (Rm) – Rf] Where, E (Ri) = the expected return on security i Rf = the risk free rate E (Rm) = the expected return on the market portfolio Bi = the beta of security i E (Rm) – Rf = the market risk premium Formulae for beta i) where b is made the subject of the above formulae b i = E(Ri) - Ri E(Rm) - Rf ii) where regression analysis is used b i = nΣxy - Σx Σy nΣx2 – (Σx)2 where x =Σ(Rm) – Rf y = Σ(Ri) – Rf n = the number of period’s data in the question iii) where expected returns are known with probability (p) Bi = Σp (Ri – Ri) (R – R ) m m Σp (R – R )2 m m where, Ri = Forecast return from security i Ri = Expected return from security i Rm = Forecast return from the market Rm = Expected return from the market P = Probability distribution iv) where from formulae iii 114Po = Cov (r, r ) i p Var ( rp) where ri = the rate of return of security i rp = the rate of return of the portfolio Cov (ri, rp) = the covariance between the rates of return 13.5 SECURITY MARKET LINE The SML is the line representing the relationship between expected return of a security and market risk (B).
The expected return of a security increases linearly with the market risk.
The SML is an upward sloping straight line with an intercept at the risk free return securities and passes through the market portfolio.
Graphically it is explained thus: Expected Return SML E (Ri) E(Rm) Risk Premium Rf Risk Free Return 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Bi This linear relationship is derived from the formulae: E(Ri) = Rf + Bi (Rm – Rf) The market itself has an underlying beta (B) of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the macro market.
A stock that swings more than the market (more volatile) overtime has a beta whose absolute value is above 1.0.
If a stock moves less than the market, the absolute value of the stock’s beta is less than 1.0.
More specifically, a stock that has a beta of 1.5 follows the market in an overall decline or growth but does so by a factor of 1.5; meaning when the market has an overall decline of 3%, a stock with a beta of 1.5 will fall by 4.5%.
Betas can also be negative, meaning the stock moves in the opposite direction of the market.
A stock with a beta of -3 would decline 9% when the market goes up by 3% and vice versa.
11513.6 CAPITAL MARKET LINE The CML represents the trade off between risk and return available in the capital market.
It defines the linear relationship that exists between expected return on a portfolio and that portfolio risk.
The slope of the CML is the rate of exchange between expected return and risk and is given by: Np CML Rm Rm - Rf Rf a m 13.7 EFFICIENT FRONTIER In selection of a portfolio, comparisons between combinations of portfolios are essential.
As a rule, a portfolio is not efficient if there is another portfolio with: a) a higher expected value of return and a lower standard deviation (risk) b) a higher expected value on return and the same standard deviation (risk) c) the same expected value of return but a lower standard deviation (risk) If an investor’s portfolio is not efficient he may through diversification” a) increase the expected value of return without increasing risk b) decrease the risk without decreasing the expected value of return c) obtain some combination of increase of expected return and decrease risk.
This is possible by switching to a portfolio on the efficient frontier.

The above graph depicts efficient frontier and the different levels of indifference curves for an investor.
The individual investor will want to hold that portfolio of securities that places him on the highest indifference curves, choosing from the set of available portfolios.
A, B, C, and D define the boundary of all possible investments which are the efficient proposals lying on the efficient frontier.
The optimal portfolio is achieved at a point where the indifference curve is at tangent to the efficient frontier.
13.8 LIMITATIONS OF CAPM 1 Beta is difficult to measure accurately for an individual company.
2 Beta values may be unstable overtime.
3 CAPM is a theoretically one period model.
As one period model, it should be used with caution for the appraisal of multi period projects.
4 There might be problems in determining the appropriate risk free rate of return.
5 In the real world, a perfect market does not exist and thus, calculating expected return on market portfolio will not be visible.
6 The model only considers systematic risk.
It assumes that investors always hold balanced portfolio which eliminate unsystematic risk.
7 There are possibilities of conflicts in the decision reached with WACC.
8 In practice, the cost of insolvency cannot be ignored.
Also, the possibility of insolvency is related to a firm’s total risk rather than its systematic risk.
13.9 ARBITRAGE PRICING MODEL The arbitrage pricing model (APM) is similar to the CAPM with their origins being significantly different.
While CAPM is a single – factor model, the APM is a multi – factor model with a whole set of beta values one for each factor unlike CAPM that uses a single beta value.
Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) out of which the APM arises, states that the expected return on an investment is dependent upon how that investment reacts to 117a set of individual macro – economic factors and the risk premium associated WITH EACH OF those macro – economic factors.
In the case of APM, the expected return on a particular investment is given by: E(Ri) = R + B (R – R) + B (R – RF) + ......B (R – RF) f fi fi f FL F2 FN FN Where f1 and f2 e.t.c individual macro – economic factor n = the number of identified factors.
A major problem with the use of APM is that the identity of those macro – economic factors is unclear.
13.10 SUMMARY Markowitz mean variance model suggests that investors are basically concerned with risk and return relating to the investment and company diversification of portfolio, the trade off is possible between risk and return.
The optimal investment is achieved at a point where the indifference curve of an investor is at tangent to the efficient factor.

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) concentrates on portfolio management which is concerned with efficient management of investment in the securities.
A portfolio is the collection of several securities on behalf of an investor.
Portfolio management deals with the process of selection of securities from the number of opportunities available with different expected returns and carrying different levels of risk and the selection of securities is made with a view to provide the investors the maximum yield for a given level of risk or ensure minimized risk for a given level of returns.
14.2 MARKOWITZ MEAN – VARIANCE MODEL According to Harry Markowitz, investors are mainly concerned with two properties of an asset that is, risk and return.
Though, it is possible to trade off between risk and return through diversification.
By this theory, the risk of individual asset is not really important; what is very important is the contribution of each individual asset to the investor’s total risk.
For selecting the right portfolio from different assets, he developed Mean Variance Analysis.
The portfolio selection problem can be divided into two stages: • Calculate the mean – variance of the efficient portfolios.
• Select one such portfolio.
The idea behind the mean – variance analysis is to ascertain the expected return and risk of portfolios for comparison.
The mean of the forecast value of returns is the expected returns while the variance or standard deviation represents the risk.
As we know: 120Np = W (R ) + W (R ) A A B B Variance = σp2 = W 2 σ 2 + W σ 2 + 2 W W R σ σ A A B A A B AB A B where, WA = Proportion of funds invested in A WB = Proportion of funds invested in B σ = Standard deviation of A A σ = Standard deviation of B B RA = Forecast returns of A RB = Forecast returns of B r = Correlation co-efficient AB Np = Expected returns on the portfolio 14.3 CONCEPT OF EFFICIENT FRONTIER In practice, a rational investor will seek to minimize risk and maximize return.
He will therefore prefer the project having the higher return at the same level of risk with another and where two securities have the same return, he will select the one with the lower risk.
Graphically, Efficient Frontier Return D A E Risk 0 Investment A will be preferred to investment E because it has the lower level of risk at the same level of return with investment E. Security D will be preferred to security E because it has the same level of risk with E but higher return.
Both securities A and D dominate security e and where all shareholders o investors prefer a particular security based on the same criterion or criteria, the preferred security is said to have a stochastic dominance over the less preferred security.
The choice between security A and security D depends on the attitude of the investors in that there is no clear choice not only between A and D but also all securities that fall along the curve that is known as the efficient frontier.
So, a risk – taker will prefer security D which has the higher return and higher risk.
A risk averse investor will select A which has both lower risk return to security D. 14.4 SEPERATION THEOREM 121The attitude of individual investors towards bearing risk affects only the amount that is loaned or borrowed.
It does not affect the optimal portfolio of risky assets.
Investors would select portfolio of risky assets no mater what the nature of their indifference curves is.
The reason is that when a risk – free security exists, and borrowing and lending are possible at the rate, the market portfolio dominates all others.
As long as they can freely borrow and lend at the risk – free rate, two investors with very different preferences will both choose portfolio of risky assets.
Thus, the individual utility preferences are independent of or separate from the optimal portfolio of risky assets.
This condition is known as the separation theorem.
It states that the determination of an optimal portfolio of risky assets is independent of the individual’s risk preferences.
Such a determination depends only on the expected returns and standard deviations for the various possible portfolios of risky assets.
In essence, the individual’s approach to investing is in two phase: 1.
Determination of an optimal portfolio of risky assets.
2.
Determination of the most desirable combinations of the risk – free security and the portfolio.
14.5 APPLICATION OF CAPM AND APM Recalling the Capital Asset Pricing Model E(Ri) = Rf + Bi (Rm – Rf) Illustration 14.1 Oreoluwa ltd an investment company has invested in equity shares of a chip company.
Its Risk free return (Rf) = 10% Expected total return (Rm) = 16% Market sensitivity index (Bi) = 1.5 Calculate the expected rate of return on the investment made in the security E(Ri) = Rf + Bi (Rm – Rf) = 10 + 1.5 (16 – 10) = 10 + 1.5 (6) = 19% Implications of Beta Values 1221.
A portfolio with beta greater than one is more volatile than the market and will have a higher return than the market.
2.
A portfolio with beta less than one is not as risky as the market and will have a lower return than the market.
3.
A portfolio with beta equal to one has the same risk with the market and will have the same return with the market.
4.
A portfolio with beta equal to zero is risk free.
Asset Beta An asset beta reflects a company’s business risk.
It is the weighted average beta of equity and beta of debt including any relevant tax effects.
The difference between a company’s asset beta and equity beta reflects the financial risk.
Only systematic risk cannot be diversified away is considered in an asset beta.
Thus: ßa = ße (MVe) + ßd [MVd (1+t)] MVe + MVd (1-t) MVe + MVd (1-t) :.
ßa = ßa + (ßa – ßd) MVd (1-t) MVe where ßE = Beta of Equity ßa = Asset of beta ßd = Beta of debt MVe = Market value of debt (ex-int) MVe = Market value of equity (ex-div) t = Corporation tax rate Illustration 14.2 The most recent balance sheet of Olekoko Plc shows the following: N Net Assets 67,500 Represented by: Ordinary shares of 50k 52,500 10% debentures 15,000 67,500 123The beta of the company’s asset is 0.85 while that of the debt is 0.20.
Return on government bond is currently 12% while the return on the market securities is 17%.
The ordinary shares are currently quoted at N2.10 per share while the market value of the debentures is 89%.
Using the capital asset pricing model, determine the company’s appropriate cost of capital assuming the rate of company tax is 30%.

Fundamentals of Financial Management (1996) 128UNIT 15: FINANCING SMEs Learning Objectives After this study, students must have understood: • The meaning of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises • Features of Small Scale Enterprises • Problems of small Scale Industries 129• Sources and Finance of SMEs • Government Measures to Enhance The Status of SMIs CONTENTS 15.1 Introduction 15.2 Features of Small Scale Industries 15.3 Problems of Small Scale Industries 15.4 Sources of Finance For SMEs 15.5 Government Measures To Enhance The Status Of SMEs 15.6 Small And Medium Industries Equity Investment Scheme 15.1 INTRODUCTION Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) can be defined as having three characteristics: • Firms are likely to be unquoted • Ownership of the business is restricted tom a few individual • They are not micro business that are normally regarded as those very small business that act as a medium for self – employment of the owners The economy of any country depends on the contributions of all sectors of the economy particularly the small and medium scale enterprises.
15.2 FEATURES OF SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES 1.
They usually have low set up cost.
2.
They rely on local raw materials.
3.
Employment operation.
4.
They accelerate rural development and contribution to stemming urban migration and problems of congestion in large cities.
1305.
They provide links between agriculture and industries.
6.
They mobilize private savings and harness them for productive purposes.
7.
They supply parts and components for large – scale industries.
8.
They contribute to domestic capital formation.
15.3 PROBLEMS OF SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES The small scale industries are based with many problems among which are: 1.
Management problems: all important entrepreneurial and operational decisions are taken by one person and there is lack of formal training in management and production skills.
2. Financing problems: this constitutes major problem.
Their low business credibility, poor management, inefficiencies, limited collateral security, high risk of failure make it difficult for them to raise capital from usual sources and often force them to secure loans at higher interest rates from their lenders.
3.
Most of them tend to initiate rather than innovative.
4.
They engage in production of non – standardized products.
5.
Most of them are concentrated in urban centres and could therefore not tap the local advantages e.g cheap labour, access to primary products e.t.c.
6.
Little access to or inability to apply new technologies.
15.4 SOURCES OF FINANCE FOR SMEs At one time or another in the life of an enterprise, the owners of SMEs would need money.
Generation of funds for the successful operation of these enterprises involves the following: 1.
Owner financing 2.
Loans 3.
Trade credit 1314.
Equity financing 5. venture capital 6.
Leasing 7.
Factoring Owner Financing: This comes in the form of owners contribution in the case of a sole proprietor.
This money is needed as pointed out to provide working capital to acquire fixed assets and to pay for promotional expenses.
This is the same as equity financing.
15.5 GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO ENHANCE THE STATUS OF SMIs The government has introduced schemes and policies to encourage more lending to small firms and special sectors of the economy and these are: • Central Bank of Nigeria guidelines on sectoral allocation of loans and advances.
• The loan scheme of National Directorate of Employment.
• The Agricultural Credit Guarantee Schemes.
• Establishment of Development Banks such as BOI and NACRDB.
• Establishment of SMEDAN.
• Establishment of small and medium scale equity investment scheme.
• Establishment of ADB Export stimulation fund scheme, IDA and IFC.
15.6 SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRIES EQUITY INVESTMENT SCHEME 132The Bankers Committee on December 21, 1999,at its 264th meeting resolved that all banks in Nigeria should set aside 10% of their profit before tax for equity investments in small and medium industries.
Consequently, the scheme SMIEIS was launched and on August 2001, the Small and medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria SMEDAN was established to address the problems associated with the SMEs.
THE OBJECTIVES The objectives of the SMIEIS scheme among others are to: • Facilitate the flow of funds for the establishment of new Small and medium Industries (SMI) projects reactivation, expansion and modernization or restructuring of on – going projects.
• Stimulate economic growth, develop local technology and generate employment for capable and suitable Nigerians.
• Eliminate the burden of interest and other financial charges for the entrepreneurs.
• Provide financial advisory, technical and managerial support to the entrepreneurs.

Fundamentals of Financial Management (1996) UNIT 16: INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT Learning Objectives 133After this study, students must have understood: • Foreign exchange management • Determinants of Exchange rates • Hedging the Foreign Exchange risk • Theories of Foreign Exchange determination • Calculation of Exchange Rate CONTENTS 16.1 Introduction 16.2 Foreign Exchange Management 16.3 Factors Affecting Fluctuations in Exchange Rates 16.4 Methods of Hedging Against Foreign Currency Risk 16.5 Foreign Exchange Market Participants 16.6 Exchange Rate 16.7 Theories of Foreign Exchange Determination 16.8 Currency Forecasting 16.9 Exchange Risk 16.10 Foreign Exchange Management Techniques 16.1 INTRODUCTION Due to the fact that all countries are not equally endowed with the different natural resources, no country is self-sufficient in its demand and supply of goods and services and that is why factors of production such as labour and capital are seen moving freely across the national frontiers.
All the countries trade in goods and services, borrow and lend, invest and accept investments with other countries with nominal or full control to govern the currency flow and trade.
Since different countries have their own currencies, with different purchasing power, the settlement of payments cannot be made with the currency of any one country.
It is from this that the concept of foreign exchange rate emerges.
16.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGES MANAGEMENT It is clear that no country can produce all that she needs.
Countries individually, produce such goods in which such a country has comparative advantage and sells those goods to other countries while also buying the goods the other countries have comparative advantage in.
Although exchange rate fluctuation may result in a gain (positive) or a loss (adverse).
It is often considered undesirable because it introduces an element of 134uncertainty.
Because of the risk involved, it can be said that foreign exchange management imposes can extra burden on a company’s finance manager.
Meanwhile the following should be considered: a) Balance of Trade b) Invisible Balance c) Balance of Payment on current account.
Balance of Trade Visible goods are goods that have physical existence such as cars, machinery which are traded and exchanged in international trade.
When a country produces such goods and sells them abroad they are referred to as visible export.
When she buys such goods abroad for home consumption it is known as visible imports.
The difference in the value of visible exports and visible imports is known as the balance of trade and it may be favourable or unfavourable.
Invisible Balance Countries also buy and sell services such as banking services, shipping services etc.
When a country sells or renders such services to another country such transactions is called invisible exports, when the opposite is the case, i.e.
services are provided for the country by other countries, they are called invisible imports and the difference between invisible imports and invisible items which may either be favourable or unfavourable for any particular year.
The Balance of Payment on Current Account This is the record of all transactions between one country and the rest of the world, for all visible goods and invisible services in the course of the year.
When the total payments made for both visible goods and invisible services in the course of one year exceed the total receipt from visible and invisible services.
The balance of payments on current account is said to be unfavourable.
A country in this position is said to experience a deficit on the account.
In a reversed case, the balance of payment is favourable.
16.3 FACTORS AFFECTING FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES 1351) The supply and demand for the foreign currency 2) The supply and demand for the local currency 3) Global inflation rates and its effect on the domestic rate of inflation 4) Local economic conditions including local production of goods for export and local interest rates 5) The political environment in Nigeria and in the foreign country 6) Volume of trade 7) Speculation: Speculators influence movements in exchange rates by buying and selling in the expectation of making positive returns.
8) Interest rate 9) International confidence in the naira reflecting international confidence in the domestic economic management policies.
16.4 METHODS OF HEDGING AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 1) Forward Countries: This is a contract to buy or sell a specified quantity of foreign currency at an agreed future date or within a specified future time period.
The contract could be fixed if the future date is fixed.
It could be floating, if the future date falls within a range.
2) Foreign Currency Invoicing: One way of avoiding exchange risk is for an exporter to invoice a foreign customer in domestic currency.
In this way only the exporter will be able to avoid exchange risk, the burden of the risk will now be passed on to the importer.
3) Matching: If a Nigerian Company expects to receive some earnings in foreign currency and at the same time expects to incur certain expenses in the same foreign currency, it may plan to offset its payments against receipts in the currency.
In this way, movements in exchange rates between the naira and the currency in question would be irrelevant to the extent that matching can take place as there will be no need to purchase or sell foreign currency.
4) Borrowing in a Foreign Currency: An exporter who invoices foreign customers in a foreign currency can hedge against the exchange risk by: i) borrowing an amount in the foreign currency now ii) converting the foreign currency into domestic currency at the sport rate 136iii) repaying the loan with interest out of the eventual foreign currency receipts 5) Protection Clauses: An export or import context might be given a protection clause, whereby sales prices in the foreign currency or the adjusted exchange rate moves outside a defined range.
6) Netting: This is a technique which involves the head office and its foreign subsidiary netting off the intra-organizational debts due at the end of each period.
Only the balance exposed to currency risk needs to be hedged.
7) Pricing Policy: A company can anticipate adverse exchange rate movements by building an extra profit margin into the selling price to act as a cushion in the event that exchange rates do move adversely.
Protection clause is another aspect of pricing policy.
8) Leading and Lagging: Accelerating (leading) and delaying (lagging) international payments by modifying credit terms normally on credit 16.5 FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET PARTICIPANTS 1) Arbitrageurs The seek to earn risks-free profits by taking advantage of differences in exchange rates arising countries.
They buy currencies that are under priced at one centre and simultaneously sell the same set of currencies at the centres where they are overpriced, thereby making a risk free arbitrage profit.
2) Speculators The reason for their action is profit making.
They trade in foreign currencies by profiting from the exchange rate fluctuations.
They take risks in the hope of making profits by buying a particular currency when the price is low and selling the same currency when the price is high.
3) Hedgers These are mainly multinational companies.
They operate in several countries and their assets and liabilities are designated in foreign currencies.
The foreign exchange rate fluctuation can cause diminution in the home currency value of their assets and liabilities.
16.6 Exchange Rate 137Exchange rate is the equivalent of the foreign currency that is obtainable from a unit of home currency.
It is the rate at which one currency exchanges for another currency.
DIRECT AND INDIRECT QUOTES Direct Quote Since the advent of SAP in 1986, Nigeria adopted direct quote of exchange.
Exchange is quoted directly when the number of units of home currency to deal in one unit of foreign currency is given.
E.g.
$1 = N128.
Indirect Quote It is indirect when the number of units of foreign currency to deal in one unit of home currency is given.
E.g.
N1 = $0.0078.
Indirect quote is the reciprocal of direct quote and vice versa.
Types of Exchange Rate 1) Fixed Exchange Rate: with a fixed exchange rate the government of a country maintains its currency at a particular exchange rate against a specified foreign currency.
When the level can no longer be maintained due to market pressure devaluation takes place.
2) Floating Exchange Rate: With this system, the market determines the exchange rate of that currency with other currencies and these rates will constantly fluctuate.
3) Spot Rate: This is the rate at which foreign exchange can be bought or sold with payment set for the same day.
It the rate ruling at the conversion date.
4) Forward Rate: It is the currency rate quoted now for delivery at some future specified date.
16.7 THEORIES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGES DETERMINATION 1) Purchasing Power Parity Theorem This theorem predicts that the exchange value of foreign currency depends on the relative purchasing power of each currency in its own country and that spot exchange rates will vary over time according to relative price changes.
It follows therefore that if the rate of inflation of country.
A is greater than the rate of inflation in country B, the rate of exchange of currency of country 138A will fall against the currency of Country B.
The exact relative purchasing power purity relationship is expressed as follows.
S1 – So = Pn – Pf So 1 + Pf where So = Current (direct quote) spot rate Si = Expected future (direct quote) spot rate at time 1 Pn = Inflation rate of home country Pf = Inflation rate of foreign country The above formula can be simplified Si= 1 + Pn So 1 + Pf Illustration 16.1 It is expected the inflation rates in Nigeria and US are 6% and 3% respectively.
The present spot rate of 1 US $ is N45.36.
What will be the expected spot rate in twelve months time.
S1 = 1 + Pn So 1 + Pf S1 = 1 + 0.06 45.36 1 + 0.03 S1 x 1.03 = 45.36 x 1.06 S1 = 48.0816 = N46.68 1.03 Fisher Effect The term fisher effect is used in looking at the relationship between interest rates and expected rates of inflation.
The rate of interest can be seen as made up of two parts.
The real required rate of return plus a premium for inflation.
The real and nominal interest rates are connected by Fisher Effect as follows: (1 + R) (1 + 1) = (1 + M) when R = Real interest rate I = Expected rate of inflation M = Market (nominal) interest rate Then, (1 + R) = (1 + M) (1 + I) 139The difference is interest rates between two countries is equal, in equilibrium, to the expected difference in inflation rate between these countries.
This hypothesis is called fisher effect.
If real interest rate are equal in all countries, then 1 + i = 1 + Pn n 1 + i 1 + Pf f where i = nominal interest rate of home country n i = Nominal interest rate of foreign country f Pn = Rate of inflation of home country Pf = Rate of inflation of foreign country INTERNATIONAL FISHER EFFECT This is also called “Open Fisher Theory”.
If assets that countries with higher rates of inflation will have higher nominal interest rates to provide adequate return to investors to combat inflation.
The international fisher effect relationship is expressed as: S1 – So = i – i n f So 1 + i f where, S1 = Expected future spot rate at time period 1 So = Current spot rate In = Nominal interest rate of home country If = Nominal interest rate of foreign country The formula can be simplified as follows: S1 = i – i n f So 1 + i f S1 = 1 + 0.08 45.36 1 + 0.05 S1 = 48.99/1.05 = 46.66 S1 = N46.6 2) Interest Rate Parity Theorem 140This theorem states that the differential between the forward exchange rate and the spot exchange rate is equal to the differential between the foreign and domestic interest rates.
Its condition is that the forward premium of discount for a currency quoted in terms of another currency is approximately equal to the difference in interest rates prevailing between the two countries.
So, F – So = i – i n f So 1 + i f where, F = Direct quote for forward rate So = Direct quote spot rate in = Interest rate of home country if = Interest rate of foreign country simply, F = i – i n n So 1 + i t Illustration 16.3 The current bank interest rate of U.S. and Nigeria are 4.5% and 8.5% respectively.
The present spot market rate of exchange in 1 US $ is N45.36.
What would be the twelve month forward rate?
F = i – i n n So 1 + i t F 1 + 0.085 45.36 1 + 0.045 F (1.045) = 45.36 x 1.085 F = 49.2156/1.045 = N47.096 16.8 CURRENCY FORECASTING a) Market Based Forecast: The currency forecast is obtained by extracting the prediction embodied in interest and forward rate.
b) Model Based Forecast: i.
Fundamental Analysis: It relies painstakingly on the examination of macro-economic variables and policies that are likely to influence a currency prospect.
The variables examined include relative inflation, interest rates, national income growth and changes in money supply.
141 ii.
Technical Analysis: It focuses exclusively on past price and volume movements while totally ignoring economic and political factors.
16.9 EXCHANGE RISK This is the variability of a firm’s value that is due to uncertain exchange rate.
Currency Exposure to Risk 1) Accounting or Translation Exposure : Risk of adverse effects on a firm’s financial statements that may arise from changes in exchange rates.
It is the change in the value of a firm’s foreign currency denominated account due to a change in the exchange rate.
2) Economic Exposure: Risk that arises from changes in real exchange rate.
It is the extent to which the value of a firm will change due to exchange rate movement.
3) Transaction Exposure: Risk to a firm with known future cashflows in a foreign currency that arises from possible changes in the exchange rate.
It is the extent to which a given exchange rate will change the value of foreign currency dominated transactions already entered into.
16.10 FOREIGN EXCHANGES MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES 1.
Currency Options : This gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell (put) or buy (call) the contract currency at a set price and at a given date.
2.
Currency Future: This is a contract for future delivery of a specific quantity of a given currency with the exchange rate fixed at the time the contract is entered into.
3.
Currency Forward Contract: This is similar to future contracts except that they are not traded on organized market.
They are non-standardized private deals.
4.
Interest Rate Swaps : This is an agreement between two parties to exchange interest rate payments for a specific maturity on an agreed principal.
The most common interest rate swap involves exchanging fixed interest payments for floating interest payments.
1425) Currency Swap : This is a simultaneous borrowing and lending operation whereby two parties exchange specific amount of two currencies at the outset at the spot rate.
The parties undertake to reverse the exchange rate after a fixed term at a fixed exchange rate.
6) Debt Swap : This is a set of transactions (also called debt-equity swap) in which a firm buys a country’s dollar debt and swap this debt with Central Bank for local currency that can be used to acquire a local enterprise.
