The marks you obtain for this assignment will count towards the final mark you will obtain for this course.
Any further information on assignment will be found in the assignment file.
Assessment Your performance in this course will be based on two major approaches.
First is the Tutor-Marked Assignments (TMAs).
The second method is through a written examination.
Tutor-Marked Assignments (TMAs) With respect to TMAs, you are expected to apply the information, knowledge and techniques gathered during the course.
The assignments must be submitted to your tutor for formal assessment in accordance with the laid down rules.
The total score obtained in the TMAs will account for 30% of your overall course marks.
There are many TMAs in the course.
You should submit any four to your tutor for assessment.
The highest three of the four assessments will be counted and these will be credited to your overall course marks.
Final Examination and Grading At the end of the course, you will need to sit for a final written examination of three hours(cid:8217) duration.
This examination will also count for 70% of your overall course marks.
The examination will consist of questions, which reflect the types of self-testing, practice exercise and TMAs you have previously encountered.
You are advised to prepare adequately for the examination; since the general broad area of the course will be assessed.
Course Marking Scheme The following table lays out how the actual course marking is broken down: Assessment MARKS Four assignments submitted Best 3 of the four count @ 10% each = 30% of course marks Final examination 70% of overall course marks Total 100% of course marks iv MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS How to Get the Most from this Course The distance learning system of education is quite different from the traditional university system.
Here, the study units replace the university lecturer, thus conferring a unique advantage on you.
For instance, you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suit you best.
Hence, instead of listening to a lecturer, all you need do is reading.
You should understand right from the on-set that the contents of the course are to be worked at and understood step by step, and not to be read like a novel.
The best way is to read a unit quickly in order to see the general run of the content and then to re-read it carefully, making sure that the content is understood step by step.
You should be prepared at this stage to spend useful time with your reading.
Facilitators/Tutors and Tutorials Detailed information about the number of tutorial contact hours provided in support of this course will be communicated to you.
You will also be notified of the dates, times, and location of these tutorials, together with the name and phone number of your tutor, as soon as you are allocated to a tutorial group.
Your tutor will mark and comment on your assignments, keep a close watch on your progress and on any difficulties you might encounter, and provide assistance to you during the course.
Please do not hesitate to contact your tutor by telephone or e-mail if you need help.
The following might be circumstances in which you would find help necessary: if you do not understand any part of the study units.
if you have difficulty with the self-test or exercises if you have a question or problem with an assignment or with the grading of an assignment.
You should endeavour to attend tutorial classes, since this is the only opportunity at your disposal to experience a physical and personal contact with your tutor and to ask questions, which are promptly answered.
Before attending tutorial classes, you are advised to thoroughly go through the study units and then prepare a question list.
This will afford you the opportunity of participating very actively in the discussions.
Summary v MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Marketing is the business function that identifies customer needs and wants, determines which target markets the organisation can serve best and designs appropriate products, services, and programme to serve these markets.
However, marketing is much more than just an isolated business function-it is a philosophy that guides the entire organisation.
Actually, the goal of marketing is to create customer satisfaction profitably by building value-laden relationships with important customers.
The marketing department cannot accomplish this goal by itself.
It must team up closely with other departments in the company and partner with other organisations throughout its entire value-delivery system to provide superior value to customers.
Hence, marketing calls upon everyone in the organisation to (cid:8220)think customer(cid:8221), and to do all they can to help create and deliver superior customer value and satisfaction.

3.2 Need for International Business 3.3 History of International Business 3.4 Differences in International Business 3.4.1 Forces in Environment 3.4.2 Domestic Environments 3.4.3 International Environment 3.4.4 Decision Making More Complex 3.5 Globalisation 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Doing business between two countries is international business.
A lot of students are always confused as to what international business is.
The belief that doing business between a black nation (Nigeria) and a European country (Britain) is what we only refer to as international business is not correct.
Business between Nigeria and Ghana is an international business.
So, international business is business between one country and another country or countries.
There are so many reasons why countries are involved in business and various factors affect their activities.
This unit examines international business and its environment.
1 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain international business • give reasons for international business • trace the origin of international business • explain the forces in business environment and international environment • explain decision making process in international business.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What is International Business?
International business consists of transactions that are devised and carried out across national borders to satisfy the objectives of individuals, companies and organisations as well as countries.
Czinkota et al (2002) says international business could be and is always interrelated; it involves export and import trade or direct foreign investment.
International business could take the form of owning a subsidiary company fully, joint ventures, licensing, and franchising or management contract.
Definition of international business borders on two issues, namely: • National boundaries • Transactions Nations have borders; it therefore means that transacting business across borders is an international business, whether the business is among nations in the same region or across two different regions.
3.2 Need for International Business International business as a course of study is necessary for students of business management and others because every businessman needs to take advantage of the following: • you need international experience to equally manage your business at home, because the whole world is now a global village.
2 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS • the chief executive officers and managing directors need courses in international business to cope with human resources management.
• international business is needed for managers to become familiar with other markets, culture and customs of other business markets.
• it will equally increase the involvement of the firm in international business, thus its procedures and practices need to be studied.
3.3 History of International Business Ball et al (2002), believe that international business as a discipline is relatively new but international business practice is not.
It is believed that international business practice started before Christ.
Phoenician and Greek merchants used to send their representatives abroad to sell their goods.
In 1960, British East India Company had established branches in Asia; within this same period, American traders were involved in international trade in Asia.
Dutch companies later joined British East Company at the same period and were involved in international business.
In 1868, Singer sewing machine built its foreign factory in Scotland and its branches grew in other countries.
J and P Coats (UK) and Ford followed suit with companies in other foreign countries; since then foreign businesses started springing up.
In Nigeria, foreign business can be traced to the period of slave trade.
However, Europeans traded in Nigeria with their business even before independence.
Some of the noticeable companies that were present in Nigeria in early 1970s include UAC, John Holt and host of others.
Today, Nigeria too has established business in other foreign countries.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Name five foreign businesses in Nigeria.
2.
Name five Nigerian businesses abroad.
3.4 Differences in International Business International business and domestic business differ for the fact that international business has three forces to contend with once it operates outside the shores of its country.
They include: • domestic • foreign • international 3 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS While domestic business contends only majorly with domestic issues, it sometimes faces foreign or external business issues.
The international business environments are critically examined below.
3.4.1 Forces in Business Environment Environment could be classified into two, i.e.
internal and external environment or controllable and uncontrollable environment, Ball et al (2002), reported that environment is the sum of all forces surrounding and influencing life and development of the firm.
The external environment is composed of these elements.
i.
Competition ii.
Distribution iii.
Economy iv.
Socio economic v. Financial vi.
Legal vii.
Physical viii.
Political ix.
Socio cultural x. Labour and xi.
Technology.
The controllable factors as observed by Ball et al (2002) are elements over which management do have some control, such as factors of production (capital, raw materials, and people) and the activities of the organisation (personnel, finance, production and marketing).
3.4.2 Domestic Environment This comprises of uncontrollable forces that have their roots in the home country and these influence the cycle and development of the firm.
For instance, Nigeria could be suffering from shortage of foreign currency flow.
It is possible that Nigerian government will place a restriction on overseas investments to reduce inflow.
4 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.4.3 The Foreign Environment This environment is the same with that of the above 3.4.2; the difference is that the foreign environment is emanating from the foreign country.
However they operate differently for several reasons which include: • Different force values Some forces may look identical in the two environments yet they may be opposed to each other.
• Change difficult to assess Forces like political and legal forces are difficult to assess.
Some laws may be passed to appease a section of the population.
• Forces interrelated All forces are interrelated.
An example could be the combination of high cost capital and abundance of unskilled labour in many developing countries which may lead to the use of a lower level of technology than would be employed in the more industrialised nations.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Pick one factor which affects international business each from domestic and foreign and show how they are interrelated 3.4.4 International Environment Ball et al (2002) opined that international environment is the interactions: • between the domestic environmental forces and the foreign environmental forces • between the foreign environmental forces of two countries where an affiliate in one country does business with customers in another.
3.4.5 Decision-Making More Complex There is no doubt that a decision involving business that is international is more complex than business that is domestic.
A good example is that if management accepts a salary increase demand in a subsidiary, it is 5 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS possible because of change of information idea, another subsidiary will demand for increase equally.
3.5 Globalisation It is believed that it is difficult to come to agreement as to what actually is globalisation.
In fact, it is interesting in the sense that every day on television shows, internet chat rooms, practical demonstrations, parliaments, management boardrooms and labour union meetings, people discuss globalisation; the definition that is acceptable is elusive.
Social scientists discuss globalisation according to area of interest i.e.
political globalisation, technological globalisation etc.
All the same, politics, society, environment, history, geography, and culture have some implications in globalisation.
Ball et al (2002) are of the opinion that globalisation is that aspect of economic globalisation, the international integration of goods, technology, labour, and capital; that is, firms implement global strategies which link and coordinate their international activities on a worldwide basis.
Globalisation forces have five major kinds of elements, they include: i.
Politics It is a trend toward the unification and socialisation of the global community.
ii.
Technology Advances in computers and communications technology have permitted increased flow of ideas and information across borders, enabling customers to learn about foreign goods.
iii.
Markets As companies globalise, they also become global customers.
Example could be seen in Nigerian banking industry, Zenith Bank, First Bank, Intercontinental Bank, have gone global with global customers.
iv.
Cost Economics of scale which seek to reduce costs are always a management goal; you could achieve this through global product lines so as to reduce development, production and investing costs.
6 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS v. Competitiveness Competition in the international market is keener than home markets, because of diverse products/services and as well as different marketing strategies in entering international market.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 What are the effects of globalisation on Nigerian economy?
4.0 CONCLUSION International business and global business have some characteristics in common, yet they are different.
The international business is affected by some factors such as domestic, foreign and international variables, while domestic business is affected only by domestic variables.
International business studies are essential for managers and stake holders in the international environment for competition, efficient and effective management.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you studied: • International business • Reasons for international business • Factors that affect international business • International business environment.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Discuss globalisation and five major devices that affect business in Nigeria.

The activity of buying and selling or of exchanging goods or services among people or countries.
2.
A particular type of business.
3.
A particular area of business and the people or companies that are connected with it.
4.
The amount of goods or services that you sell.
5.
A job, especially one that involved working with your hands and that requires special training and skills.
(b) Verb 1.
To buy and sell things.
2.
To exist and operate as a business or company.
3.
To be bought and sold or to buy and sell something.
4.
To exchange something that you have for something that somebody else has.
8 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS However, trade could compose of almost all of the above.
But the first definition fits our purpose.
When (cid:8220)international(cid:8221) is added to it, it becomes the stated activity in definition noun (a) that cuts across boundaries.
Is there any difference between business and trade?
As we progress along, you should be able to provide correct answer to the question.
Business trade has some principles.
For instance mercantilism, absolute advantage, environment factors have some impact on business transactions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define international trade • explain various theories of trade • explain international product life cycle.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Trade International trade in Nigeria includes exports and imports.
In 1990, some achievements were made; international trade on goods and services were measured in dollars which surpassed $4 million.
After the year, it reached $6.8 billion.
Since then the world trade has been increasing.
In Nigeria, we have been witnessing trade deficits mostly because we have been importing refined fuel from other countries.
Therefore, international trade is the exchange of goods and services across international boundaries or territories.
In most countries, it represents a significant share of gross domestic product.
International trades as seen presently, although based on historical records, in economic and political importance, have been in the rise in recent times.
Industrialisation, advanced transportation, globalisation, multinational corporations and outsourcing are all having a major impact on the international trade.
International trade is crucial to the continuance of globalisation.
International trade is a major source of economic revenue for any nation that is considered a world super power.
Without international trade, nations would be limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders 9 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS International trade is also a branch of economics which together with international finance form the longer branch of international economy.

3.2 International Trade Theories A question: Why do nations trade?
Ball et al (2002) attempt this question and they equally provide important proposition of predicting the direction, composition and volume of goods traded which are what international trade theories attempt to address.
Interestingly as the case with numerous economic postulations or theories, the first formulation of international trade theories were politically motivated.
Adam Smith, incensed by government intervention and control over the domestic and foreign trades, published an inquiry which examined the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, in which he tried to destroy the mercantilist philosophy.
International trade theory addresses the following.
• Mercantilism • Theory of absolute advantage • Theory of comparative advantage • Hecksler-Ohlin theory of factor-environment-factor.
• Gravity model, e.t.c.
3.2.1 Mercantilism This is an economic philosophy based on the belief that: • a nation(cid:8217)s wealth depends on accumulated treasure usually gold, and • to increase wealth, government policies should promote exports and discourage imports Mercantilism era ended in the late 1700s but its arguments live on.
Nations are encouraged to increase their exports and limit imports.
Mercantilists were able to achieve this through more export and less import.
Surpluses were left to be used to replace imports of precious stones like gold.
For example, since England had no gold mine, the only solution was to import.
10 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Modern day mercantilism is called economic nationalism.
What is happening is that nations and their industries should benefit from their economies i.e.
industries and banks should be able to use the power of the state as both: • stockholder and financier and • customer and marketer, to revitalise the nation(cid:8217)s economic base.
One may be tempted to say Nigeria is into modern day mercantilism.
3.2.2 Theory of Absolute Advantage Ball et al (2002) reported Adam Smith as claiming that market forces should determine the direction, volume and composition of international trade.
Adam Smith argued that under free unregulated trade, each nation should specialise in producing those goods it could produce most efficiently (had an absolute advantages), either natural or acquired.
Some of these goods would be exported to pay for imports of goods that could be produced more efficiently elsewhere.
Smith showed by his example of absolute advantage that both nations would gain from trade.
Below is an example of Nigeria and Ghana that produce rice and cocoa.
Table 1 Commodity Nigeria Ghana Total Rice 3 1 4 Cocoa 2 4 6 Without looking at comparative advantage, each country can produce the quantity of rice and cocoa shown in the table above.
If each country is to specialise in production of what it can produce more by channeling its production capacity, the production will increase to what is shown below.
Each country will specialise in: Table 2 Commodity Nig Ghana Total Rice 6 0 6 Cocoa 0 8 8 11 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS From the table above, since the resources are geared towards production of rice or cocoa, the output increases from 4 to 6 for rice and 6 to 8 for cocoa.
3.2.3 Heckscher-Ohlin Model The Heckscher (cid:8211) Ohlin model was produced as an alternative to the Ricadian model of basic comparative advantage.
Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove much more accurate in its predictions.
However, from a theoretical point of view, it did provide an elegant solution by incorporating the neoclassical price mechanism into international trade theory.
The theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by difference in factor endowments.
It predicts that countries will export those goods that make intensive use of factors that are locally scarce.
Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were exposed in empirical tests by Wassily Leontief who found out that the United States tended to export labour-intensive goods despite having a capital abundance.
Activity List five products in which you feel Nigeria can have comparative advantage over Ghana: • (i) • (ii) • (iii) • (iv) • (v) SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 From your own opinion, discuss the international trade theory Nigeria is practising.
3.2.4 Gravity Model The gravity model of trade presents a more empirical analysis of trading patterns rather than the more theoretical models discussed above.
The gravity model, in its basic form, predicts trade based on the distance between countries and the interaction of the countries(cid:8217) economic sizes.
The model mimics the Newtonian law of gravity which also considered distance and physical size between two objects.
The model has been proven to be empirically strong through econometric analysis of other 12 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS factors such as income level, diplomatic relationships between countries.
Trade policies are also included in expanded version of the model.
(Source: www.wikipedia.
com).
3.2.4 Regulation of International Trade Bilateral treaties were used as a regulating mechanism between two nations.
High tariffs become another method during the period of mercantilism.
Free trade becomes main regulatory method of international trade in the 1990s.
General agreement on trade treaties (GATT) and world trade organisation are basically the method of regulating international trade world-wide.
This has caused problems between nations, sometimes leading to dissatisfaction and discontent among nations.
Most nations that are economically powerful support free trade.
However, they go into what is called (cid:8220)protectionism(cid:8221) where some goods/industries are of utmost importance to them.
Some years ago, Netherlands and the UK supported free trade but today, the USA, Australia, Japan and even the UK are the greatest proponents of free trade.
Countries like India, China and Russia are strong advocates of free trade today, because they are dominating the world economy.
As tariff levels fall, there is also an increasing willingness to negotiate non- tariff measures including foreign direct investment procurement and trade facilitation.
The latter looks at the transaction cost associated with meeting trade and customs procedures.
(Source:www wikkipedia.
com.)
Agricultural products are mostly in favour of free trade, while manufacturing sector prefers protectionism.
This system is changing in recent times; agricultural products produced by some countries were classified under international trade treaties which allow for more protectionist measure.
During Depression, domestic economy tries to favour increased tariff.
World trade organisation is directly the organ that is used in regulating the international trade.
3.3.6 International Product Life Cycle (IPLC) (American Example) The international product life cycle, is related to product life cycle.
The IPLC passes through four stages in America.
13 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STAGE ONE Preliminary screening for attractive country markets, Key questions to be answered - Which foreign markets warrant detailed investigation?
STAGE TWO Assessment of industry market potential Key question to be answered - What is the aggregate demand in each of the selected?
STAGE THREE Company sales potential analysis Key question to be answered - How attractive is the potential demand for company products and services?
A sequential process of researching foreign market potentials Adopted From: Michael R Acziniota; ikka a ronkainan Michael G Moffeh.
International Business.
(USA Government Western thompsorn leaving) The four stages include: 1.
United States Exports It is believed that the US has the largest population of high income consumers in the world; competition for their patronage is high.
Manufactures look for ways of satisfying their consumers, because of this, they invest in research and development.
Consequently, the design and the production methods are up to date always.
In essence, America has the highest number of new products because of the above factors, hence export market develops.
2.
Foreign Production Regions Ball et al (2002) opined that (cid:8220)overseas consumers especially those in the developed nations, have similar needs and the ability to purchase end products.
Export volume grows and becomes large enough to support production(cid:8221).
He further stressed that (cid:8220)if the innovator is a multinational 14 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS firm, it will be sending its subsidiaries new product information with complete details on how to produce it.
(cid:8221) If the company has no affiliate foreign business people, as other countries learn about the production of these products, they will obtain licence for its production, foreign production begins.
The America firm will still be exporting to those markets where there is no production, but its export growth will diminish.
3.
Foreign Competition in Exports Foreign firms are gaining experience.
In marketing and production, the cost of production will fall.
Because their market is getting saturated, they look for buyers elsewhere.
If there is an advantage in labour or raw materials cost, they will under sell the parent company(cid:8217)s products.
At this level foreign firms are competing in export market, because of this American export, sales will continue to decline.
4.
Import Competition in the United States Ball et al (2002) are of the view that (cid:8220)if domestic and exports sales enable foreign producers to attain the economies of scale enjoyed by the American firms, they may reach a point where they can compete in quality and undersell American firms in the American market e.g.
the US market is serviced by imports only.
3.2.7 Latest Explanations on the Direction of Trade 1.
Economies of Scale and the Experience Curve As production increases the cost of production lowers and as the companies gain experience in production the cost of production equally continues to go down.
Economies of scales and the experience curve affect international trade because they permit a nation(cid:8217)s industries to become low-cost producers without gaining much advantage of production factors.
2.
First Mover Theory Some management theories argued that the firm that enters the market first (first movers) will soon dominate it.
New research however indicates that previous studies were flawed because they were based on surveys of few firms and did not include a large numbers of the true pioneers.
15 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.
The Linder Theory of Overlapping Demand The Linder Theory says that international trade in manufactured goods will be greater between nations with similar levels of per capita income than between those with dissimilar levels of per capita income.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 International trade is considered by the developing nations as (cid:8220)exploitation of the advanced nations(cid:8221).
What is your view of this statement?
4.0 CONCLUSION International trade has been viewed as the buying and selling of goods and or services between two or more countries.
It also includes bilateral agreements among nations.
The relationship of one country with another is examined from the international trade theories.
The belief in Mercantilism is that a nation(cid:8217)s wealth depends on accumulated treasures usually gold and a nation must continually strive to increase its wealth, while under the absolute advantage, it is believed that a country should produce goods in which it has better advantage over other products.
While Heckscher-Ohlin model believes that international trade is restricted by tariff and non-tariff factors, international trade equally has a life cycle which is similar to a product life cycle.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt about: • International trade practice • Various theories of international trade • International product cycle.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Relate the international product life cycle to Nigerian situation.

3.1.1 Increasing Profits and Sales 3.1.2 Protecting Markets, Profits and Sales 3.2 How of International Business 3.2.1 Exporting 3.2.2 Indirect Exporting 3.2.3 Direct Exporting 3.3 Foreign Manufacturing 3.3.1 Wholly-Owned Subsidiary 3.3.3 Joint Venture 3.3.4 Licensing Agreement 3.3.5 Franchising 3.3.6 Contract Manufacturing 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION The question we should ask ourselves here is why does one need to go overseas in search of greener pastures when one is doing well in business at home?
This is the question that this unit will attempt to answer.
From our simple understanding of international business, one will want to go abroad for so many reasons among which are to expand one(cid:8217)s business, to see new ways of doing business etc.
If we all agree that there is need to go abroad, how do we do that?
In this regard, one can start by exporting goods go into manufacturing or buying a company abroad or connecting with others.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain reasons for going abroad • state various ways of going abroad.
17 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Why International Business Going international shows that you want to: • increase profits and sales of your company • protect markets and sales and for political reasons.
Ways of Going International Include (i) Exporting goods (ii) Foreign manufacturing (iii) Wholly owned subsidiary (iv) Joint venture (v) License agreement (vi) Franchising (vii) Contract manufacturing 3.1.1 Increasing Profits and Sales of Your Company A lot of managers are under pressure to increase their company(cid:8217)s sales and profits.
Because of this, they continue to search for new markets.
They look for markets with growth in GDP and population or an economy with high growth rate but which business is not growing at the same rate.
In increasing your company(cid:8217)s profit and sales you must be able to: - create new market- This is created where the GDP per capital is increasing.
- identify where there are preferential trading arrangements.
- seek an agreement with a small group of nations to establish free trade among them while maintaining with restriction with all other nations.
ECOWAS is a good example.
18 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - create a faster growing market- This is another way of increasing profit and sales.
Because of the fast growing marketing, local companies may be willing to invest there to improve on the profit, example is Liberia.
- improve communication - It is a supporting reason for opening up new markets overseas because certainly the ability to communicate rapidly and less cost with customers and subordinates by electronic mail and video conferencing has given managers confidence in their ability to control or influence foreign operations.
Improving on profits is by obtaining greater revenues.
To obtain greater revenues, you need to simultaneously introduce products into foreign markets and as well as domestic markets and also to enhance the globalisation of their operations.
In addition to going international, is to reduce costs of goods sold and higher overseas profits as an investment motive.
Test marketing is another way of increasing profit because test marketing a product in a foreign location is less important to the company than its home market and major overseas markets.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Critically assess (cid:8220)profits(cid:8221) as a motivator for international business/trade.
3.1.2 Protecting Markets, Profits and Sales Some of the reasons for going international are to: • protect domestic market- By this, the company monitors its customers abroad.
A company that has its customers scattered around the globe should go international in order to protect such markets and the long-term effect is that it protects both the profits and sales.
• protect foreign market- This implies that the company critically examines the economic activities, whereby in the domestic market, there are: a) Less/Lack of foreign exchange b) Local production by competitors c) Down stream markets- like NNPC building mega stations.
d) Protectionism- erecting import barriers to reduce competition.
19 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Protecting company(cid:8217)s profits, sales and markets, this could be achieved by: • guaranteeing supply of raw material • acquiring technology and management know-how • geographic diversification • satisfying management desire for expansion.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 List factors that you consider could influence a Nigerian manufacturer to relocate abroad while there are existing customers at home.
3.2 How of International Trade Having known why businesses go international, you may now ask yourself whether a company could suddenly wake up one day and start selling abroad.
No; there are varieties of ways by which a company could enter into foreign markets.
They include: 3.2.1 Exporting This is a method of selling regular products abroad.
It requires little investment and the risk is less.
Exporting could be direct or indirect.
3.2.2 Indirect Exporting Ball et al 2002 observe that indirect exporting (cid:8220)requires neither special expertise nor large cash out-lays.
However, you may employ the services of the following.
- Manufacturers(cid:8217) export agents - They sell for various manufacturers.
- Export commission agents - They buy for their customers overseas.
- Export merchants - They purchase and sell on their own accounts.
- International firms - They specialise in international business activities.
20 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.2.3 Direct Exporting Direct exportation of goods and services by the firm that produces the goods: Management normally sets up a sales company.
Dangote in Nigeria can set up Dangote distributing outlets in Ghana and its goods are distributed through that outlet.
3.3 Foreign Manufacturing For companies that decide on foreign manufacturing, five methods are open for them to choose from: they include, wholly owned subsidiary, joint venture, licensing agreement, franchising and contract manufacturing.
3.3.1 Wholly Owned Subsidiary A company that wants to start international business this ways can: - acquire a going concern (existing business) - start afresh by building a new plant - purchase new distribution networks.
In the past dispensation, some foreign companies came to Nigeria and acquired some going concerns i.e.
Ajaokuta Steel Company, former NITEL, Oku Iboku Paper Mill, Sheraton Hotel, Abuja, etc.
3.3.2 Joint Venture This is a cooperative effort between two or more organisations that share common interests in a business enterprise or undertaking.
A joint venture could be in any of the following ways.
(i) A corporate entity formed by an international company and local owners.
(ii) A corporate entity formed by two international companies for the purpose of doing business in a third market.
(iii) A corporate entity formed by a government agency (usually in the control of investment) and an international firm.
(iv) A corporate undertaking between two or more firms of a limited duration.
21 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Some basic advantages of joint venture are that it creates: (i) strong passion for the company.
(ii) expertise on tax and other benefits are acquired.
Disadvantages of this type of business are that: (i) Profit is shared.
(ii) Lack of control over joint venture.
(iii) Government laws do affect this type of business; for instance, the Indigenisation Decree of 1972 is a good example in Nigeria.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 List five companies in Nigeria that are joint ventures and state the types.
3.3.3 Licensing Agreement Licensing agreement is a contractual agreement in which one firm grants access to its patent, trade secrets, or technology to another for a fee.
The definition states that it is an agreement between one firm (the licensor) who grants to another firm (the licenser) the right to use any kind of expertise, such as manufacturing procedures and trade markets for one or more of the licensor(cid:8217)s products.
Examples are Hyundai Electronics and Sensory Electronics granting license to Texas Instrument for a fee of one billion dollars.
3.3.4 Franchising Ball et al (2002) define it as a form of licensing in which one firm contracts another to operate a certain type of business under an established name according to specific rules.
Franchising permits the franchisee to sell products or services under a highly published brand name and a clearly given set of procedures with a carefully developed and controlled strategy.
In the area of soft drinks, Coca Cola had such an agreement with a company that sells Canada Dry.
22 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.3.5 Contract Manufacturing This is an arrangement in which one firm enters contract with another to produce products to its specification but assumes responsibility for marketing.
Contract manufacturing could be in two ways.
(i) Strategy of entering a foreign market without investing in plant facilities.
A company may ask another company to produce for it products according to its specification i.e.
Former Bata (known as FENMAD) company produces school shoes for some other company to sell.
(ii) The second method is to sub contract assembly production or production of some parts to independent companies(cid:8217) overseas, e.g Peugeot Automobile of Nigeria (PAN), Kaduna.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Assess the Nigerian market and mention any five firms/companies which have franchising arrangements with other companies.
4.0 CONCLUSION International business has its how and why.
The why is based purely on protecting its market, sales and profit; and maybe other reasons.
However, the how are classified into five.
In fact, a company can go international as long as the laws of such country are obeyed.
There are various ways of entering international markets, and these may depend on a company(cid:8217)s resources and marketing strategies.
5.0 SUMMARY Going international by companies for business is inevitable, because various factors threaten both home and foreign business activities due to globalisation.
In this unit you have learnt about: • Why companies go international.
• Ways of entering international markets by companies.

24 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT 4 FINANCIAL INFLUENCE ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Financial Forces 3.2 Fluctuating Currency Values 3.3 Foreign Exchange Quotation 3.4 Currency Exchange Control 3.5 Balance of Payment 3.6 Tariffs and Duties 3.7 Taxation 3.8 Inflation 3.9 Household Savings 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Financial influence on an international business is an uncontrollable factor and this include foreign currency exchange risks, national balance of payment, taxation, tariffs, national monetary and fiscal policies inflation and national business accounting rules.
Though all these are controllable variables looking like disadvantages to a business concern, if well studied and applied accordingly, they could turn out to be an advantage to a business concern.
This unit examines financial influence on international business.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit you, should be able to: • explain factors that affect international business finance • describe the implications of foreign currency on international business • explain balance of payment • explain tariff, taxation and government regulatory policy on international business activities • explain international accounting practice.
25 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Financial Force These are some financial factors that a business man, who goes international, struggles with in order to be successful in an international business.
These factors are uncontrollable, because as a businessman, you do not have control over them; however, you could critically study them and take advantage of the opportunity being created by them.
3.2 Fluctuating Currency Value One of the major currencies Nigeria depends on in terms of exchange is the dollar.
In the 1990s, to be precise, during Abacha(cid:8217)s Regime, the naira was about 70 to 75 per dollar.
From 1999 to 2006, Nigerian currency has been fluctuating between N160 and N180 per dollar.
Today, it is about N120 per dollar.
The essence of this account is to examine the effect of this on an international businessman who operates in Nigeria at this period.
The cost of goods that are brought in from outside Nigeria will continue to rise and fall thereby affecting business activities either positively or negatively depending on the situation at hand and the policies of the government.
In a situation where the currency fluctuation is higher, the Central Bank may intervene in selling and buying the dollar.
You must be conversant with the exchange rate if you want to go into international business.
It is very easy to get the currency value of the naira against major currencies in the world.
You must bear it in mind that the rates are not always stable.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 List the current values of the dollar, pound, and euro against the naira.
3.3 Foreign Exchange Quotations Foreign Exchange Quotations is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another.
Ball et al (2002), in the world(cid:8217)s currency exchange markets, the US dollar (US $) is the common unit being used for exchange for other currencies.
This means, a Japanese businessman who wants to buy goods in the US will have to convert his Yen to dollars to buy his goods.
26 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.4 Currency Exchange Controls Ball et al (2002), describe currency exchange control as currency exchange control limit or the legal limit allowed of a currency in international transaction.
Typically, the value of the currency is arbitrarily fixed at a rate higher than its value in the free market and it is decided that all purchases or sales of other currencies be made through a government agency.
As a result of this control, black markets inevitably spring up, as the official channel, most times, cannot cope with the volume of demand from business.
However, the black market is rarely able to accommodate transactions of a large size and which may involve multinational organisations.
In Nigeria, the currency exchange was highly controlled with two different exchange rates- Inter banks rate and FEM rate.
FEM rate is determined at fortnightly auctions.
Borrowing from abroad is subject to the Federal Ministry of Finance approval.
For incoming direct investment, approval is needed from Finance Ministry and Ministry of Internal Affairs which control foreign equity.
A hundred percent international ownership is not allowed.
In coming portfolio market requires Finance Ministry(cid:8217)s approval.
Remittance of dividends and profits is also controlled by the Finance Ministry.
In conclusion, the Federal Ministry of Finance also controls the remittance of principal capital, interest, sales fees and pre-tax profit, reparation of capital and documentation of transfer of business or sale.
The Federal Ministry of Finance is the gate-keeper for international business.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 How has the Nigerian government been able to control foreign exchange in the country?
3.5 Balance Of Payments Balance of payments is described as a situation where a country(cid:8217)s export and import are equal.
If the balance of payment is slipping into deficit, government may probably consider one or more market or non market measures to correct or suppress that deficit.
A government can do the following.
- Currency devaluation - Restrictive monetary or fiscal policies - Currency or trade controls.
27 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS In terms of export, government will encourage export incentives, tax holidays, lower cost financing, or other advantages government may give to international businesses to encourage them to export, buy goods and services.
All these affect international business either positively or negatively.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 List five export incentives Nigeria granted foreign investors in the last three years.
3.6 Tariffs or Duties The words tariffs or duties are used interchangeably.
They are taxes usually imposed on imported goods.
Tariffs and duties are imposed on some goods for the following reasons.
i.
Natural defense ii.
Protecting infant industry iii.
Protecting domestic jobs from cheap foreign labour iv.
Scientific tariff or fair competition v. Retaliation vi.
Other reasons for tariff imposition are that it - permits diversification of the domestic economy - improves balance of trade.
3.7 Taxation Taxes are collected from corporations by government so as to provide social services to its citizens.
So many people believe that customers pay taxes through high price of goods and the appropriate authorities remit them to the government.
It means a company with a lower tax rate would charge its customers less for its products.
This may sound good, but in practice, that is not the case especially in Nigeria.
International companies pay more taxes because they operate in many countries; this entails a lot of documentation and paying large fees.
There are different taxes in different countries.
If you look at some countries, you will discover that the income tax is the biggest revenue 28 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS earner for them, especially the US.
There are other taxes like value- added tax, capital gain tax, property taxes and social security.
3.8 Inflation Increase in prices of goods and services over a period of time is known as inflation.
Reasons for inflation may be because of: - rise in demand - increase in money supply Since 2006, there has been increase in prices of goods and services worldwide; it is believed that it is because of invasion of Iraq by America.
Iraq has ended up selling crude oil per barrel at $117 for the first time in the history of energy sector in the world.
Inflation has a lot of effects on interest rates because companies borrow; and the cost of borrowing is dependent on the rate of inflation.
Once inflation sets in, the lender loses because the value of money is reduced and the borrower, gains, because the value of the money has gone down.
Inflation equally has an effect on a country(cid:8217)s monetary and fiscal policies.
(Monetary policy is the amount of money in circulation, while fiscal policy is the collecting and spending of money by the government).
Inflation has both positive and negative effects on a business especially the international business.
To businessmen, high inflation encourages borrowing because, on repayment, it will be cheaper.
High inflation rate brings about high interest rate and this may discourage lending to business organisations.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Why is it important for an international business to critically study inflation and how it affects business?
3.9 Household Savings Ball et al (2002) stated that it is a percentage of disposable income which has a good measure of the saving rate in a country.
The USA has a low saving rate while Japan has a high saving rate.
Japan(cid:8217)s economy is based on her saving rate which is better than that of the US in terms of investment and having good infrastructure.
In Nigeria, during Babangida(cid:8217)s regime, we had no savings as a country but when Abacha took over and before he died we had a savings of $7 billion.
Before Obasanjo handed over power in 2007, it was close to $50 billion.
Today we are close to $70billion.
It is expected that the money would be used 29 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS in investing in infrastructural development and this would attract more international businesses.
4.0 CONCLUSION Taxation, household savings, inflation, balance of payment, currency exchange control, tariffs and duties, foreign exchange quotation etc, are all financial forces that an international business man must look into while contemplating doing international business.
They could have both negative and positive effects on a business, depending on how they are handled.
For instance, inflation could be advantageous to a borrower while on the other side, the cost of borrowing could be high.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit you have learnt about: • Factors that affect international business finance.

30 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT 5 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT (1) CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 International Business Environments 3.2 Economic and Socio-Economic Forces 3.3 Physical and Environmental Forces 3.4 Socio-Cultural Forces 3.5 Political Forces 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Domestic market, also known as home market, is affected by some environmental variables known as uncontrollable variables.
International market is not an exception.
Thus, an international businessman must critically study these variables before going abroad.
The effects of these variables on international business activities are colossal.
This unit examines the variables and their impact on international business activities.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • list some international uncontrollable forces • explain economic variables • discuss physical and environmental forces • explain socio-cultural variables • discuss legal and political variables.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Business Environments Going abroad for business, you are faced with problems different from that of your home country.
For instance Nigeria and Brazil are engaged in international business; the economic, physical, political, and other environmental factors in Nigeria differ from that of Brazil.
Thus, you 31 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS need to critically study Brazil(cid:8217)s environmental variables/factors before you go into her market.
For these reasons, the following factors are examined.
3.1 Economic and Socio-Economic Forces Economic Aspect Once you have decided on the economy or country which you want to explore, the following are the factors to investigate under the economic aspect.
- GNP, GNP/capita and GDP/capita, income distribution, private consumption, gross domestic investment, private and government consumption and unit labour cost.
- GNP: - Is gross national product, it is the total value of all goods and services produced domestically not including net factor income from abroad.
The United States(cid:8217) GNP is about $80 trillion while Sao Tome and Principe is 44 Million.
- GNP/capita and GDP/capita: - GDP is the measured access to a country(cid:8217)s wealth by individuals within a nation.
Per capita of Nigeria is less than a dollar.
- Income Distribution: - It is a measure of how a nation(cid:8217)s income is apportioned among its people, commonly reported as the percentage of income received by population quintiles.
- Private Income: - This is described as discretionary income i.e.
how much is left for individuals after paying taxes and spending on necessities.
Business men are interested in this before they enter a market, because this determines the purchasing power of such market.
- Gross Domestic Investment: - Amount of private investment.
- Private and Government Consumption: - The total amount of money spent in provision of goods and services.
In most countries it rises.
- Unit Labour Cost: - This is the total production labour costs divided by units produced.
This is done to know whether it will be favorable to go into a particular market.
32 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Socio Economic Dimension - Total population: - The total population of the market abroad should be critically examined.
It is believed that if a country(cid:8217)s population is high, the market is likely going to be high.
- Age Distribution: - In Nigeria, the youth have the highest percentage, followed by the adults, children and the aged.
- Population Density and Distribution: - Population density is a measure of the number of inhabitants per area units, while population distribution is a measure of how inhabitants are distributed over a nation(cid:8217)s area.
- Rural(cid:8211)Urban Drift: - Movement of individuals from rural settlement to urban settlement.
In Nigeria, it is rising daily.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 How can Nigeria(cid:8217)s high population be an advantage to an international business man?
3.2 Physical And Environmental Forces In considering physical and environmental forces, it is important to examine the following: i. Topography: - If a businessman is to come into Nigeria from Australia, he should be interested in the following physical landscape of Nigeria.
- Mountains and plains.
Because in countries like Spain, Switzerland, China, Colombia, mountains divide markets; it equally has an implication on population concentration.
- Deserts.
This naturally would indicate scanty population which would affect markets.
- Bodies of water.
This could help in transportation like inland waterways.
- Climate and development.
The climatic implication to business is great, because it influences the type of goods we trade in.
Natural resources must equally be studied because they affect business.
These resources may include: 33 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Energy - These include petroleum, local and nuclear power, non-fuel minerals.
In OPEC, presently the output is less and the prices are rising, because of this, international businessmen must study or monitor changes because they are necessary and may affect business.
The study and close observation of natural resources in a country is very important.
In fact, effective environmental management is a global issue nowadays.
3.3 Socio-Cultural Forces Culture: - This is the sum total of beliefs, rules, techniques, institutions and artifacts that characterise human population.
Culture affects all business functions as far as marketing, human resource management, production and finance are concerned.
An international businessman needs to study these socio-cultural variables of the international market because they are the pivot of business activities.
To a certain degree, they influence the success or failure of international business activities.
There are communities that believe in the superiority of their own ethnic group, you must appreciate this to succeed in this type of community market.
Socio-cultural components that a businessman should critically study before going international include the following among others.
i. Aesthetics: - A country(cid:8217)s sense of beauty and good tastes.
ii.
Attitude and beliefs.
iii.
Religion: - In Nigeria, the major religions are Christianity, Islam and Traditional religion.
iv.
Material culture: It refers to all human made objects and thus concerned with how people make things (technology) and who makes what and why (economics).
v. Education: People(cid:8217)s literacy influences the type and mode of business they engage in.
vi.
Language: In Nigeria, we have over 360 languages.
It does not mean that an international businessman must speak them all, but he/she must appreciate them.
vii.
Societal organisation: This includes cultural festivals which may involve legal and/or political structures.
34 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
How can religion affect an international business?
2.
List three socio-cultural forces that can affect the international businessman.
3.4 Political Forces In the world, there are four different types of ideological forces.
i. Communism- It was propounded by Karl Max to mean a classless society.
It was developed by his successor (Lenin) into a control of society by the communist party and the attempted worldwide spread of the ideology.
ii.
Capitalism- It is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are for the most part privately owned.
iii.
Socialism: - Public, collective ownership of the basic means of production and distribution and operating for use rather than profit.
iv.
Conservative or liberal: -This refers to a person who wishes to minimise government activities and maximise private ownership and business.
It is equally referred to as right wing liberal: It is popular in America.
Conservatives are particular about greater government investment in most aspects of human activities.
The country in which you want to do business must be studied to know which mode of government it operates.
Other areas to study in terms of political forces are the following.
- The government ownership of business.
- The privatisation system.
That this, to some extent, is in practice in Nigeria.
- Nationalism - The level of one(cid:8217)s devotion to one(cid:8217)s nation.
For instance, Americans are believed to be more nationalistic than Nigerians.
- Government protection- American government is good at this, it unapologetically fights for its(cid:8217) interests when they are threatened.
- Government stability- some nations are stable while some are not.
35 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Traditional hostilities: The long-standing enmities between tribes, races, religion, ideologies or countries.
- International organisations: - Must be contended with if you go international in your business.
4.0 CONCLUSION Political forces, socio-cultural forces, physical and environmental forces, economic and socio-economic forces, are all serious forces that an international businessman must study carefully before venturing into a market.
A lot of businesses have been wrecked at the international level as these forces were not taken into consideration at the onset.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt the following: • Effect of economic and socio-economic forces on international business.
• Effect of physical and environmental forces on international business.
• Effect of socio-cultural forces on international business.
• Effect of political forces on international business.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT As an international businessman, what factors will you consider more pressing before going into say, the Liberian economy for business?

This unit examines the impact of legal, labour and competitive elements on international business.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain legal forces • explain labour forces • explain competitive forces as they affect international business.
37 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Business Environment The international business environment is so complex for prospective and potential businessmen.
This is because they must critically study the legal, labour and competition variables, as they affect business activities.
3.2 Legal Forces For a foreign firm to operate in Nigeria, it has to understudy some of the laws and regulations of Nigerian business environment.
For instance, the following are good examples of regulatory laws and agencies in Nigeria for domestic business, and once you want to operate in Nigeria from a foreign country, they must equally apply to you.
1.
Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) The Nigeria Standard Organisation Act of 1971 establishes SON as an integral part of the Federal Ministry of Industries.
The SON is to carry out the following functions among other things.
- To designate, establish and approve standards in respect of meteorological materials, commodity structures and process for the certification of products in commerce and industry throughout Nigeria.
- To provide necessary measures for quality control of raw materials and products in conformity with the standard specification.
- To ensure compliance with designated standard.
- To establish a quality assurance system including certificate for factories, products and laboratories.
- To develop methods of testing materials, supplies equipment and items purchased for use of public and private establishment.
- To establish and maintain laboratories necessary for the performance of their functions.
38 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 2.
National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) NAFDAC was established in 1993 with the following as its functions: to regulate and control the importation, exportation, manufacturing, advertisement, distribution, sales and use of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical services, bottled water and chemicals.
3.
Drugs and Related Productions Non-drug products like cosmetics or medical devices shall be manufactured, imported, advertised, sold or distributed in Nigeria unless it is registered in accordance with the provisions and regulations of 1993 Act.
4.
Environmental Impact Regulation Similar to what obtains in several other countries, environmental protection is accorded a lot of prominence in Nigeria.
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) is charged with overall responsibility of monitoring, supervising and coordination of environmental impact assessment procedure for Nigeria, as well as environmental assessment guideline for various industrial sectors of the country.
5.
Trade Malpractice (Miscellaneous Offences Decree 1992) This law provides punishable offences relating to trade malpractice and could set up a special trade malpractice investigation panel to investigate such offences.
The law provides against any person who: - falsely labels, packages, sells, offers for sale or advertises any product so as to mislead as to its quality, character, brand name, value, composition, merit or safety.
- contracts or deals, uses or intends to use any weight measure which is false or unjust for the purpose of sale - sells any product by weight measure or number less than is purported to be sold.
- advertises or invites subscription for any product which does not exist.
The following are some laws and regulations governing the establishment and operations of business in Nigeria.
39 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS i. Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission Decree No 16 of 1995. ii.
Foreign Exchange (Monitoring and Miscellaneous Provisions) Decree No 17 of 1995. iii.
Immigration Acts of 1963. iv.
Dumped or Subsidised Goods Act No 9 of 1958. v. Custom Duty Drawback Regulation No 70 of 1958. vi.
Securities and Exchange Commission Act of 1979. vii.
Privatisation and Commercialisation Decree No 75 of 1988 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What areas are affected by the contributions of NAFDAC to international business?
2.
Name five other areas of law both national and international that could help or affect business activities.
3.2 Labour Forces Labour, in economics, is an effort necessary made to satisfy human needs.
It is one of the three leading elements in production, the other two being land (natural objects) and capital.
Labour forces have the following factors that affect international business.
- Labour mobility - Guest workers and labour shortages - Composition of labour force - The role of social status, sexism, racism, traditional society or minorities in employment policies - Employer-employee relationship.
40 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Labour Mobility It means the movement of people from one country or area-to-area to another in order to get jobs.
In the US, say 10.4 percent of the populations are foreigners working in different sectors of the economy.
The labour mobility could be as a result of influx of refugees/asylum seekers.
Guest Workers and Labour Shortages These are people who are in another country legally to perform certain jobs; countries like France, Germany etc.
have low birth rate, people go there as guest workers because of shortage in employable population.
Composition of Labour Force It is the combination of all that are employable in a given country and region.
It involves age, skill, gender, race and religion.
In Nigeria, the number of Northern women in employment scale has risen; before, they were excluded.
Consideration in Employment Policies The social variables for consideration in employment policies are sex, race, tribe, club membership etc.
Employer-Employee Relationship Ball et al (2002) opined that labour market is the pool of available potential employees with the necessary skills within countries.
The employer could be an individual, corporate or a government.
A businessman must study the rules and regulations guiding employer- employee relationship in a country.
For international businessman, it is very important to diligently study these guiding rules before venturing into the international arena.
A country with a high rate of labour unrest is not profitable for business.
3.4 Competitive Forces Competitive forces can be seen from: 1.
Marketing Point of View Businessmen must constantly keep an eye on competitors that may invade their markets and erode their market share.
Competition comes in many forms.
Any alternative satisfier of a need or want is a competitor.
41 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Marketers must know the number and size of their competitors as well as the tools they use in competition.
Marketers must also pay attention to competition from abroad (foreign countries) as some of these foreign competitors are gaining a growing advantage over the domestic marketers.
Example is in the area of telecommunication, where MTN, ZAIN, etc have advantage over NITEL.
2.
Competition within a Region This is a competition within a particular region, for instance, ECOWAS countries could come together to compete with other groups.
Sometimes, competition could be from between two or more countries.
The US for example is competing in all aspects of economy with Japan, Asia, and Hong Kong, etc.
Competition is a healthy development for business, because it compels the competitors to adequately satisfy the target markets otherwise sales/patronage would drop.
For business to be able to compete there is need for analysis of business competitive forces, which include: - competitor analysis - competitor intelligence system (CIS) Competitive Analysis This is a situation where principal competitors are identified, and their objectives, strengths, weaknesses and product lines are assessed.
Sources of information for competitors(cid:8217) analysis are gotten:- - Within the firm - Published materials - Suppliers/customers - Competitors employees - Direct observation or analysing physical evidence.
Competitive Intelligence System (CIS) This consists of the procedures for gathering, analysing and disseminating information about a firm(cid:8217)s competitors.
42 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 It is assumed that your line of business falls under communication industry; name five major competitors.
4.0 CONCLUSION Legal forces, labour forces and competitive forces are variables that must be studied carefully so that an international businessman does not underestimate the market potentials.
These forces must be studied well, if not, they will have negative effect on international business activities.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have studied the following: • legal forces in Nigeria that an international businessman should study carefully • labour forces include the following: labour mobility, population, availability of guest workers, labour shortages, and composition of labour force.
Employer-employee relationships and their implication on international business • various ways to get information for the study of the above factors and their effect on international business.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Discuss in detail sources of information for analysing competitors.

43 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT 2 INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 International Organisations 3.2 United Nations 3.3 World Bank 3.4 International Monetary Funds 3.5 World Trade Organisation 3.6 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries 3.7 African Trade Organisation 3.8 Bank for International Settlements 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION The essence of international organisation to international business is to facilitate, regulate, or finance international business.
International organisations are mostly regional or worldwide; they may be a source of financing or a source of order for these business organisations and equally a source of jobs.
These organisations have a lot of relationship with businesses.
It will be myopic of a business organisation to understand only the political, socio-cultural, etc.
environment without understanding the international organisations that have impact on international business.
Examples are given of companies that want to merge in US which may need the approval of EU so that the merger will not have effect in the European market.
This unit examines the influence of international organisations on international businesses 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the influence of the UN on international business worldwide • explain the role of IMF and World Bank and Bank of International Settlement • explain the contribution of OPEC and African Trade Organisation.
44 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Organisations It is an association of two or more groups especially countries, with the aim of protecting members(cid:8217) interests in different areas which may include business, culture, military etc.
International organisations include: - United Nations - World Bank - International Monetary Fund - World Trade Organisation - Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - African Trade Organisation - Bank for International Settlement.
3.2 The United Nations The UN is the most popular and best-known worldwide organisation.
After the World War II, the UN was formed.
It has done a lot and many people have viewed its achievement from both the positive and negative angles.
The United Nations has 189 member countries.
The body is dedicated to the promotion of peace.
It also has many other functions related to business.
The UN has different programmes and specialised agencies.
It equally has autonomous organisation and convention secretariat.
The UN carries out its activities through five main body organs.
They include: - The General Assembly - The Security Council - The Economic and Social Council - The International Court of Justice - The secretariat.
45 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS i.
The General Assembly It is a deliberative body of the UN made up of all member nations, each with one vote regardless of size, wealth or power.
ii.
The Security Council The Security Council consists of five permanent members with veto power.
There have been consistent agitations for the expansion of the Security Council.
iii.
The Secretariat The Secretary General is the head and equally a staff of the UN.
The headquarters, which is situated in New York City, is charged with the responsibility of day-to-day administrative functions.
At present, Mr. Ban-ki-Moon is the Secretary General.
Kofi Anan of Ghana was the immediate past Secretary General of the UN.
iv.
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Ball et al (2002) described it as concerned with economic problems such as trade, transport, industrialisation, economic development and social issues, including population, children, housing, women(cid:8217)s rights, racial discrimination, drug trafficking, crime, social welfare, youth, the environment and food.
v. International Court of Justice The organ is established to resolve disputes among sovereign states and not individuals.
The issue of Bakassi between Nigeria and Cameroon is still fresh in our memory.
The question one may ask at this juncture is, what is the contribution of the United Nations to international business?
The answer is given by Ball et al (2002) when they state that the UN has contributed to business in the following seven ways.
- When ships sail freely across the seas and through international straits, they are protected by rules legitimised in UN conferences.
- Commercial airlines have the right to fly across borders and to land in case of emergency, due to agreement negotiated by the international civil aviation organisation, a part of the UN system.
46 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - The World Health Organisation sets criteria for pharmaceutical quality and standardises the names for drugs.
- Universal Postal Union protocols prevent losses and allow mails to move across borders.
- International Telecommunication Union allotment of frequencies keeps the airwaves from becoming hopelessly clogged and thus avoids interference among radio transmissions.
- Data collected and redistributed from member states by the World Meteorological Organisation makes possible worldwide and country specific weather forecast.
- The UN sales convention and the UN convention on the carriage of goods by sea help to establish rights and obligations for buyers and sellers in international commercial transaction.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 What are the contributions of the UN to international business?
3.3 The World Bank The World Bank is the largest source of development assistance; it provides about $16 billion loan to its clients i.e.
countries.
Most of the credit is given to developing countries.
The World Bank is otherwise known as International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
The World Bank consists of the followings.
- World Bank - International Finance Corporation (IFC) - International Development Association (IDA) - Multinational Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) - International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) The World Bank gives out what is called hard-loan which is made payable in hard, convertible currencies at market interest rates with normal market maturities.
47 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS The World Bank has the following organisations under it: i.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) It is the World Bank(cid:8217)s group investment banker; it operates in the developing countries with private risk ventures and creation of local capital markets.
ii.
International Development Association (IDA) It gives out soft loans to developing countries and repayable in soft, convertible currencies carrying low or no interest obligation.
The loans are frequently long term, up to 40 years, and may grant grace period of up to 10 years during which no payments are required.
iii.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (-MIGA) This agency operates foreign investment in about 152 countries that are members MIGA issues contract in most developing countries.
Ball et al (2002), say (cid:8220)MIGA, had issued more than 420 contracts to private investors for projects in some 70 developing countries facilitating more than $30 million in private investment(cid:8221) iv International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Just like International Court of Justice, ICSID provides facilities for settlement by conciliation or arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and their host countries.
World Bank therefore impacts business for the fact that loans are given out, members of host countries feel the impact of this either directly or indirectly.
3.4 International Monetary Fund (IMF) IMF business is more with government.
Despite this, it has a tremendous effect on business worldwide.
The main objectives of IMF include: - orderly foreign exchange agreements - convertible currencies - shorter duration and lesser degree of balance of payments disequilibrium.
48 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Before now, IMF was charged with the responsibility of fixing permanent exchange rate among member nations, which was fixed at $35 per ounce of gold.
In the 1970s and 1980s, there were some fundamental changes in IMF.
The major change was the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate and the adoption of the floating exchange rate.
The IMF had more power for firm surveillances which permits it to influence or even dictate fiscal and monetary policies of member countries.
The IMF contributes to policy coordination among the major industrialised countries known as G7, which are: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the USA.
IMF has conditionality and cooperation with the World Bank.
The two organisations work with borrowing member countries in what is called Structural Adjustment Facilities (SAFs) or Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facilities (ESAF).
The effect of IMF on international business is equally direct and indirect.
The indirect is the policy a country adopts which affects her business.
If a country limits her import and expands her export, it means companies coming to operate in a host country will be limited in their business activities.
3.5 World Trade Organisation As the name connotes the World Trade Organisation impacts greatly on international business activities.
It has its direct and indirect effects on international business.
Ball et al (2002) opine that WTO is a multinational organisation designed to deal with value of trade among nations.
The WTO works with its core agreements, which were negotiated, signed and ratified by world(cid:8217)s most trading nations .WTO has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
It has 140 countries as members.
WTO has made its impact felt in the area of trade restrictions.
The general agreement on tariff and trade was signed in 1947.
The general tariff among member nations was reduced from 40 percent to five percent.
Issues of tariff among member nations for instance, like disputes were amicably settled by GATT.
Because of this, trade in manufactured goods multiplied up to 20 times.
49 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS WTO has many problems, among which are the following.
- Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) are weakening WTO.
- RTAs are destroying trade at the expense of countries that are not party to the agreements.
- There have been a lot of protests from member countries.
- The question of whether member countries abide by the decisions of GATT or not.
3.6 Organisation Of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a large group of countries made up of Algeria, Angola, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirate, Venezuela and Ecuador (which rejoined OPEC in November 2007).
The organisation has maintained its headquarters in Vienna since 1965, hosting regular meetings among the oil ministers of its member states.
The principal aim of OPEC according its statute, is the determination of the best means for safeguarding their interests.
The member nations individually and collectively devise ways and means of ensuring the stabilisation of prices in international oil markets with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations, giving due regard at all times to the interests of the producing nations and to the necessity of securing a steady income for the producing countries.
Efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry is another serious function of OPEC.
OPEC(cid:8217)s influence in the market has been called into question; several members of OPEC alarmed the world on triggered high inflation across the developing and developed world when they used oil embargo in the 1973 oil crisis.
OPEC(cid:8217)s ability to control the price of oil has diminished somewhat, since the discovery and development of large oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, the opening up of Russia and market modernisation.
OPEC nations still account for two-thirds of the world(cid:8217)s oil services and in 2005, 41.7 percent of the world(cid:8217)s oil production, affording them considerable control over the global market.
The next largest groups of producers are the post Soviet States which produced 23.8 percent and 14.8 percent respectively of the world(cid:8217)s total production.
As early as 2003, concerns that OPEC members had little excess pumping capacity 50 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS sparked speculations that their influence on crude oil prices would begin to slip.
(www.wikepedia.com).
One major OPEC achievement is pricing.
The body has had considerable influence on oil pricing.
Any international businessman in area of energy would do well by taking cognisance of OPEC(cid:8217)s views before making any decision.
Oil sales worldwide are denominated in US dollars; changes in the value of the dollar against other world currencies affect OPEC(cid:8217)S decisions on how much oil to produce.
3.7 African Trade Organisations Ball et al (2002) reported that to promote economic growth throughout the continent, several African countries have formed trade and investment organisations.
Three of these organisations are the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the Southern African Development Countries (SADC).
3.8 Bank For International Settlements Ball et al (2002) reported that Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is an international organisation that fosters cooperation among central banks and international financial institutions.
The BIS deals with government and government agencies, it does not accept deposits from or provide financial services to private individuals or corporations.
The BIS has four main functions.
- A forum for international monetary cooperation - A centre for research - A banker to central banks - An agent or trustee with regards to various international financial arrangements.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss the contributions of OPEC to its member countries.
51 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 4.0 CONCLUSION International organisations are necessary for the growth of international business.
These organisations are needed for the growth of the business environment.
International organisations have influence on business and business people worldwide.
Most of these organisations are more or less government organisations, with the aim of fostering unity among member nations.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit you have learnt the followings.
• The role and history of the UN in international business activities.
• World Bank and its contributions to international business.
• IMF and World Bank(cid:8217)s role in improving trade activities among member nations.

A lot of businessmen started business without research, the consequences are better imagined.
Because of information technology, research has become easier; one can be in one(cid:8217)s own house and get information from another country with the press of a button.
An international businessman must know about research, its objective, how to conduct research with the use of both primary and secondary sources of information.
When all these are done before going international, business failure becomes less.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define international business research • give reasons for international research • explain the research objectives • explain how to conduct secondary and primary research.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Business Research This is a research that is carried out about another country with the aim of doing business in such a country once the research is favourable.
53 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.2 International and Domestic Research International research is the same as domestic research.
They have some basic differences which are listed below.
- New Parameters Doing business abroad thus implies that the researcher must look at the following parameters: • Duties of different countries • Foreign currencies and changes in their values • Different modes of transportation • International documentation.
- New Environmental Factors When going international in research, the following environmental factors are encountered that may not be found in domestic environment.
• Culture of the host country • Political system • Societal structures and language • Legal issues • Technology - Number of Factors Involved While going international in research, you need to get results and be able to: • compare result and activities across countries.
• learn from its international operations and must find ways to apply the new lessons learned to different markets.
54 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Broader Definition of Competition It has been discovered that firms have greater variety of competition than that found in the home market.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 What is the difference between domestic and international research?
3.3 Recognising the Need for International Research Research is necessary but a lot of managers are reluctant to engage in international research for the following reasons: i.
Lack of sensitivity to differences in culture, consumer tastes and market demands.
ii.
Limited appreciation for the different environment abroad.
iii.
Lack of familiarity with national and international data sources and mobility to use international data once they are obtained.
iv.
Firms often build their international business activities gradually and frequently based on unsolicited orders.
3.4 Determining Research Objectives Your objectives will be on whether you want to: - export - import or - go into market expansion One major objective of international research is to discover new foreign market opportunities.
55 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STAGE ONE PRELIMINARY SCREENING FOR ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY MARKETS.

56 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.5 Conducting Secondary Research In conducting secondary research, the following process must be observed: i. Identifying sources of data.
ii.
Selection of secondary data.
iii.
Interpretation and analysis of secondary data.
iv.
Data privacy.
(i) Identifying Sources of Data Secondary data can be got from, - Government - International organisation - Service organisation - Trade association - Directories and newsletters - Electronic information services.
(ii) Selection of Secondary Data Secondary data are readily available, cheap and quick to get.
Secondary data should be evaluated as: - the quality of their source or sources - how recent they are - relevancy to task at hand (iii) Interpretation and Analysis of Secondary Data Secondary data, when collected, may not be so useful not until they are converted into information.
They are used as proxy information to arrive at conclusions.
(iv) Data Privacy Data collected must be guarded jealously because the information collected is sensitive.
57 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.6 Conducting Primary Research Primary data are obtained by firms to fill specific information needs.
Czinkota et al (2002) went further to buttress that a typical primary research intends to answer clear-cut questions such as the followings.
- What are the sales potentials for measuring equipment in Malaysia?
- How much does the typical Greek consumer spend on fast food?
- What effect will new type of packaging have on meat consumers in Norway?
- What service standards do industrial customers expect in Japan?
Conducting primary research involves decision in the following areas: (i) Industrial versus Consumer Sources of Data A decision must be arrived at as to whether the research is going to be based in an industrial or consumer product area.
In a consumer market, the population is large while the population in an industrial market is less.
If research is done in an industrial market, differences between users and decision makers are important because of their personality(cid:8217)s outlook and their evaluative criteria.
It means that you must determine the focus of the research because it is important to have a well conducted research.
(ii) Determination of the Research Technique It is interesting to know that there are a lot of factors to be considered before selecting a research technique.
- Objective of the data sought.
- Is the data subjective or objective?
- Is the data collected in the real world or controlled environment?
- Is it historical factors?
58 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Once all these are determined, you can choose any of the following techniques of research: a.
Interviews Major disadvantage is that bias can set in.
b.
Focus group A group of knowledgeable people are gathered for a limited period of time (two to four hours), with about seven to ten participants, a topic is introduced and discussed.
c. Observation It requires the researcher to play the role of a non participating observer of activity and behaviour.
d. Surveys As defined by Czinkota et al (2002), survey is usually conducted via questionnaires that are administered personally, by mail, or by telephone.
Use of the survey technique presupposes that the population under study is accessible and able to comprehend and respond to the questions posed through the chosen medium.
e. Experimentation It determines the effect of an intervening variable and helps establish precise cause-and-effect relationships, it is difficult to implement in international research, it faces the task of designing an experiment in which most variables are held constant or are comparable across cultures.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss five research techniques in detail.
3.7 The International Information System The international information system is defined as the systematic and continuous gathering, analysis and reporting of data for decision-making according to Czinkota et al (2002).
59 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS These data must be: - relevant - timely - flexible - accurate - exhaustive - consistent - convenient It has been discovered that the use of information system is increasing greatly especially in export field; most companies establish export complaint system.
There are three ways in which information system can be enriched, they include: i.
Environmental Scanning It promotes a customer(cid:8217)s information in political, social and economic affairs internationally or changes in attitudes of public institutions and private citizens, and on possible upcoming alteration.
ii.
Delphi Studies It is a means for aggregating the judgments of a number of experts who cannot come together physically, Czinkota et al (2002).
This type of research clearly aims at qualitative measures by seeking a consensus from those who know rather than average responses from many people with only limited knowledge.
iii.
Scenario Building Czinkota et al (2002) believes that information obtained through environmental scanning or Delphi studies can then be used to conduct a scenario analysis.
One approach involves the development of a series of plausible scenarios that are constructed from trends observed in the environment.
Another method consists of formally reviewing assumptions built into existing business plans and positions.
Subsequently, some of these key assumptions such as economic growth 60 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS rates, import penetration, population growth and political stability can be varied by projecting variations for medium to long-term period, completely new environmental conditions can emerge.
The conditions can then be analysed for their potential, domestic and international impact on corporate strategy.
4.0 CONCLUSION Research is the key to international business success.
The process and the procedure must be properly followed.
Any attempt to short-cut international research will lead to a company(cid:8217)s disaster.
Constraints of time, resources and expertise are the major inhibitions to international research.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt the followings.
• The meaning and definition of international business research.
• The implications of neglecting international business research.
• The objective of international business.
• That interviews, observations, survey and experimentation are international business research techniques.
• International business information depends on the following system to update:-environmental scanning, Delphi studies, scene building.
• International business information must be relevant, timely, flexible, accurate, exhaustive and consistent.

That is, marketing basically is talking about satisfaction on a daily basis.
Companies are striving to satisfy their customers, that is why a lot of them follow their customers abroad.
The marketing managers on daily basis work on their task on how to satisfy their customers.
He must work with his internal and external environment.
The internal environment includes the product, price, place and promotion; while the external environment includes technology, culture, and economy.
Once you go international, the international factors equally affect your decision.
As such, this unit focuses on strategies of marketing internationally.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • differentiate between target market selection and marketing management from the international scene • define international marketing • explain standardisation and adaptation • explain international promotional policies.
62 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Marketing Having read the definition of marketing in Unit 1, it means you know what international marketing is.
International marketing is about customer(cid:8217)s satisfaction beyond the local shore in which you are operating.
3.2 Target Market Selection Target market is that segment of the market that a company focuses its attention on so that the consumers will be satisfied.
In international business, when we discuss target market selection, we are looking at countries for possible target market within which the companies are willing to operate.
To do this, we need to: • identify potential markets for entry • expand selectively over time, across areas that are deemed attractive.
3.2.1 International Screening Identification and screening has four stages or processes.
It starts with general criteria and ends with specific market analysis.
Data for screening are got from secondary and primary sources.
63 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ALL COUNTRIES Primary screening Reject 1.
General country factors Countries 2. genetics produce specification Secondary data Prospective target countries Reject Estimating market potentials Countries by product type 1.
Size of national market 2.
Potential of national market High market potential countries Estimating sales potential for company product Reject 1.
Product comparisons Countries 2.
Competition 3 Market structure 4.
Channel structure 5.
Final consumer Highest sales potential countries (target market) Identify segment in target markets Optimal segment mix in Reject target market Segment Adopted from Michael, H. M. Ikka, A. R. International Business, USA Southwest Thompson, page 33.
64 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS The four processes of screening countries that will serve as target market include the followings.
1.
Preliminary Screening It relies solely on secondary data to know the general country factors either favourable or unfavourable to you and the generic product specific factor.
If both are positive on your side it means you have gotten prospective target countries and if unfavourable, you reject the countries and look for a more favourable country.
2.
Estimating Market Potential Market potential is the sales in physical or monetary units that might be available to all firms in an industry during a given period under a given level of industry, marketing effort and given environmental condition.
There is the feeling of whether it is favourable or unfavourable after using the income, elasticity of demand, market audit, analogy and longitudinal analysis to measure the market.
You either reject the market if unfavourable and if favourable, you proceed to what we call high market potential countries.
3.
Estimate Sales Potential After studying the market and believing that the market has prospect, there is need for estimating the sales potential of the target market.
You need data to help you look at competition, market, consumer, product and channel structure.
If they are favourable, you go to the next stage of referring to the target as highest sales potential control and if not, you either reject the country or look at other target markets.
4.
Identifying Segment There is need to identify the most profitable target relying mostly on primary data, if it is favourable, you proceed to optimal segment mix in target market and if not favourable, you reject segment and look for a more favourable one.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Discuss the steps taken in choosing an international target market.
65 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.2.2 Concentration versus Diversification Czinkota (2002) stated that concentration is a small number of markets while diversification is characterised by growth in a relatively large number of markets in the early stages of international market expansion.
Expansion alternatives have two options.
You may concentrate in a small area i.e.
a segment or you go into a broad market if the resources are available.
Expansion alternatives depend on the following factors.
• Market growth rate • Sales stability • Sales response function • Competition lead time • Spillover effects • Need for product adaptation • Need for communication adaptation • Economics of scale in distribution • Extents of constraints • Programme control requirement.
3.2.3 Marketing Management Czinkota et al (2002) believes that after target markets are selected, the next step is the determination of marketing efforts at appropriate levels.
A key question in international marketing concerned itself with the extent to which the elements of the marketing mix-product, price, place and distribution should be standardised.
The market also faces the specific challenge of adjusting each of the mix elements in the international market place.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Name the four Ps of marketing in a domestic market.
Are they the same in an international market?
66 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.2.4 Standardisation versus Adaptation These are the factors to be considered under standardisation or adaptation.
1.
Make no special provision for international market place rather, identify potential target markets and then choose products that can easily be marketed with little or no modification.
2.
Adapt to local condition in every target market (multi domestic approach).
3.
Incorporate differences into a regional or global strategy that will allow for local difference in implementation (globalisation approach).
Factors Affecting Adaptation 1.
The market(s) targeted 2.
The product and its characteristics 3.
Company characteristics including factors such as resources and policy.
3.2.5 Product Policy There are lots of factors that affect product adaptation in an international market; they are broadly divided into three.
1.
Regional ,Country or Local Characteristics They may include government regulations, non-tariff barriers; customer(cid:8217)s characteristics (expectations and preferences) purchase patterns, economic status of potential users, stages of economic development, competitive offerings, climate and geography.
2.
Product Characteristics They include, product consistency brands, function, attributes, features, method of operation or usage, durability, quality, ease of installation, maintenance, after sales services, country of origin, etc.
67 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Product Line Management International market product line must be local, regional and global brand.
Product Counterfeiting Is a general problem worldwide which involves producing inferior products to look like the original ones?
The four ways of fighting it, is through legislative action, bilateral and multinational negotiations, joint private sector action and measures by individual firms.
3.
Company Consideration These factors include profitability, market opportunities, (e.g.
market potential, product-make fit) cost of adapting, policies, (e.g.
commonality, consistency) organisation resources.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Discuss four ways of fighting product counterfeiting in international business.
3.2.6 Pricing Policy Pricing has to do with revenue generation; there are four categories of international pricing situation.
- Export pricing Are dual pricing that differentiate products that are domestic or international.
In dual pricing, cost plus marginal cost methods are mostly used; while market differentiated pricing is used based on demand oriented strategy.
If not carefully used, it can lead to price escalation or dumping.
- Foreign Market Pricing International product pricing is when the manufacturer operation is defined by corporate objectives, costs, customer behaviour and market conditions, market structure and environmental constraints.
68 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Price Coordination Calls for price coordination of products have increased because of the introduction of the Euro.
Environmental factors will continue to affect price coordination worldwide; it is difficult to coordinate prices worldwide.
- Transfer Pricing Transfer or inter-company pricing is the pricing of sales to members of corporate family.
It means charging almost the same price for all products in the same industry.
3.2.7 Distribution Strategy This is what connects the manufacturers with the buyers; it takes time for a decision to be arrived at.
Distribution strategy takes into account the following.
- Channel design - The length and width of the channel employed is affected by so many factors i.e.
product, market etc.
- Selection and screening of intermediaries - You have to look for appropriate channel members.
- Managing the Channel Relationship - Conflict arises among members because it is like a marriage; you continue to manage these members so as to reduce conflict, if conflicts are not settled, it could affect the company.
- Economic - There has been an increase in sales on the net, companies will continue to embrace it.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Name five institutions that aid distribution in an international business.
3.2.8 Promotional Policy An international businessman must think of the most appropriate promotional mix for his products.
Basically, advertising, personal selling, sales promotion and public relations are used for international business promotion.
- Advertising- Majorly, advertising decision focuses its attention on which strategy to use.
The promotional messages and the 69 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS organisation of the promotional programme must conform to the market being served.
- Personal Selling- Is (cid:8220)one on one(cid:8221) selling in international business.
Industrial goods, high-priced items, require more of personal selling.
- Sales Promotion - Any method of attracting customers for more purchases apart from advertising, personal selling or publicity is sales promotion.
They include, coupons, samplings, premiums, point of purchase and direct mail which are good examples of sales promotions.
Any of these could be used for international marketing depending on the product and the environment.
- Public Relations.
Czinkota et al (2002) argue that PR is the marketing communication function charged with executing programmes to earn public understanding and acceptance which means both internal and external communication.
Foreign companies need it for more understanding i.e.
the oil companies in the Niger Delta and the Niger Delta crises is a good example where PR could have assisted if well utilised.
4.0 CONCLUSION International business cannot succeed except marketing activities are employed.
Marketing activities involve selecting the target market and marketing management.
Marketing management involves monitoring and applying the marketing mix appropriately to satisfy consumers.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit you have learnt the following.
• How International marketing research is used in selecting an appropriate target market (i.e.
a country).
• The difference between market concentration and market diversification.
• The relevance of four Ps in an international business.

71 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT 5 EXPORT AND IMPORT PRACTICES (AMERICAN EXAMPLE) CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Export and Import 3.2 Who Exports?
3.2.1 Why Export 3.2.2 Why They Don(cid:8217)t Export 3.3 Locating Foreign Market 3.3.1 Sources of Export Counselling 3.4 Payment and Financing Procedure 3.2.1 Export Payment Terms 3.2.2 Export Financing 3.5 Export Procedures 3.5.1 Foreign Freight Forwarders 3.5.2 Export Document 3.6 Pitfalls and Mistakes of New Exporters 3.7 Importing 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Exporting is a business way of sending your products/goods abroad for sale.
This unit discusses reasons for exporting and why a business goes international.
It also discusses what it entails to export, import processes, professional advice from experts and also export/import documentation business.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define export and import • describe people who are involved in export • give reasons for export • mention procedure for import and export • list documents involved in exporting and importing of goods and services.
72 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Export and Import Export is a method of selling your goods abroad.
Import is purchasing of goods from outside your country and bringing them to your home country.
3.2 Who Exports?
It is generally believed that small companies are mostly involved in exporting because they do not have the money to establish companies abroad.
But nowadays, and in reality, both small and large companies are involved in exporting.
In essence, a lot of companies are involved in exporting provided you are legally permitted to do so.
3.2.1 Why Companies Export Companies export for the following reasons: - to increase profit and sales - to protect their business from being eroded By exporting, companies are likely to: - serve markets where the firm has no production facilities or the local plant does not produce the firm(cid:8217)s complete product mix.
- satisfy a host of government requirements.
- test foreign markets and competitions.
- remain competitive in the home market - meet actual or prospective customers(cid:8217) requests for the firm to export.
- off-set cyclical sales of the domestic market.
- achieve additional sales, which allow the firm to use its excess production capacity to cover unit fixed costs?
- extend a product(cid:8217)s life cycle by exporting to countries where technology is less advanced.
73 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - distract foreign competitors that are in the firm(cid:8217)s home market by entering their home markets.
- partake in the kind of success the firm management has seen others achieve by exporting - improve equipment utilisation rates.
3.2.1 Why Companies do not Export?
Reasons why companies do not export are: (i) preoccupation with the home market (ii) reluctance to be involved in a new and unknown operation.
Some known exporting firms in the US give the following reasons for not engaging in international business: (i) payment and financing markets.
(ii) locating foreign markets.
(iii) export procedures.
3.3 Locating Foreign Markets Businessmen need to go into screening of market to be able to identity which market to go into.
Unit 9 examined the processes involved in arriving at an appropriate international target segment.
You look at both internal and external markets, study them very well and arrive at an appropriate segment.
3.3.1 Sources of Export Counselling Information about export can be got from: - Trade information centre - Department of Agriculture - Small business administration.
In Nigeria, there are so many agencies where you can get your export counselling from, the followings are some of them.
74 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS i.
The Central Bank of Nigeria ii.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs iii.
Nigeria Investment Promotion Council iv.
Nigerian Export Processing Zone Authority v. Nigeria Customs Service, etc.
3.3.2 Export Payment Terms In the US, there are basically five kinds of payment terms, offered by exporters to foreign buyers.
They are: i.
Cash in Advance When a buyer is not well known in terms of his credit standing, he is given cash in advance.
Its disadvantages are that it will tie down the buyer(cid:8217)s capital because he needs to receive the goods and sell first before payment.
What is ordered for may not be received.
Instead, the buyers prefer paying cash and collect their goods ii.
Open Account An open account sales is offered to a reliable customer where an economy is stable, the seller takes the whole risk.
The exporter(cid:8217)s capital is tied down until payment has been received, sometimes you can use letter of credit as an alternative.
iii.
Consignment Are goods shipped to the buyer and payment is not made until goods are sold?
The seller takes all the risk.
Multinationals are involved in this type of sales; examples are Lever Brothers Nig.
Ltd, UAC, etc.
iv.
Letters of Credit Are documents issued by the buyer(cid:8217)s bank in which the bank promises to pay the seller a specified amount under specified conditions?
Letters of credit could be confirmed and are irrevocable.
Confirmed- It(cid:8217)s an act of correspondent bank in the seller(cid:8217)s country by which it agrees to honour the issuing bank(cid:8217)s letters of credit 75 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Irrevocable- It(cid:8217)s a stipulation that a letter of credit cannot be cancelled.
Air way bill- is issued by the carrier and presented as proof that shipment has been made.
Before you open a letter of credit, you as a buyer may request for a pro- forma invoice, which is seen as the exporter(cid:8217)s formal quotation containing a description of the merchandise, price, delivery time, method of shipping, term of sale, and points of exit and entry.
Letter of credit transactions- it means the route taken by the merchandise, letter of credit and documents in a letter of credit transaction.
iv.
Documentary Drafts Ball et al (2002) opined that when the exporter believes that political and commercial risks are not sufficient to require a letter of credit, the exporter may agree to payment in a documentary draft basis, which is less costly to the buyer.
Export Draft- It(cid:8217)s an unconditional order that is drawn by the seller on the buyer to pay the drafts amount on presentation or at an agreed future date and that must be paid before the buyer receives shipping document 3.4 Payments and Financial Procedure Different countries have different payment and financing procedures, this involves the documents used in export procedures.
This procedure is followed strictly before any businessman is allowed to export to any country.
3.4.1 Foreign Freight Forwarders These are special independent businessmen that handle export shipments for compensation.
They are experts in this field.
They offer advice in terms of markets, import and export regulations, and the best mode of transport, export packing and cargo insurance.
3.4.2 Export Financing Export financing are both private and public.
The private sources include the followings.
i.
Bankers Acceptance- A time draft with maturity of less than 270 days that has been accepted by the bank in which the draft was 76 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS drawn, thus becoming the accepting bank(cid:8217)s obligation.
It may be bought and sold at a discount in the financial market like other commercial papers.
Factoring- Discounting without recourse to an account receivable.
Forfeiting - Purchasing without recourse to account receivable, whose credit terms are longer than the 90 to 180 days usual in factoring; unlike factoring, political and transfer risks are borne by the forfeiter.
ii.
Export - Import Bank- It is a bank owned by the Federal Government that aids its citizens who engage in exports.
Export- Import bank guarantees the following facilities.
- Direct and intermediary loans - Working capital guarantees - Export credit insurance Import-Export bank is discussed more in Module 3 Unit 5.
PUBLIC SOURCE- In America they have the followings.
i.
Overseas Private Investment Corporation ii.
Foreign Sales Corporation iii.
Foreign Trade Zone SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 If you are involved in exporting, discuss two sources of your financial assistance.
3.5 Export Procedures It means the documentation before exporting.
Countries have different systems of documenting export procedures.
Nigerian government has a complex exporting system.
Of recent, the Federal Government is trying to correct the system; it is targeting 48 hours for clearing goods.
77 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.5.1 Export Documents Export documents are divided into two.
i.
Shipping document ii.
Collection document Shipping Documents include: i. Shippers Export Declaration (SED) - This document is required by the Department of Commerce to control export and supply export statistics, it contains the following.
- Name and Address of the shipper and consignee.
- US port of exit and foreign point of unloading.
- Description and Value of the goods.
- Export license number and bill of lading number.
- Carrier transporting the merchandise.
ii.
Export Licence- It(cid:8217)s any export licence covering export commodities for which a validated licence is not required, no formal application is required.
However, for strategic materials and all shipments to unfriendly countries, validated export licence are required.
iii.
Export Bill of Lading- It serves as a contract for carriage between the shippers and the carrier, a receipt from the carrier for the goods shipped and a certificate of ownership.
iv.
Insurance Certificate- It(cid:8217)s the evidence that the shipment is insured against loss or damage while in transit.
v. Automatic Export System (AES) (cid:8211) It(cid:8217)s a one-stop export filing system- a single information collection and processing centre for the electronic filling of the export shipments documentation required by the US government.
Collection documents include the followings.
i.
Commercial Invoices- They are just like domestic invoice with additional information such as origin of goods, export packing 78 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS marks and a string attached that goods will not be diverted to another country.
ii.
Consular Invoice- These are export forms purchased from the consulate written in the official language of the country.
iii.
Certificate of Origin- Some countries like Nigeria require this to know from which country the goods are coming.
iv.
Inspection Certificate- When goods are exported in containers, lighter abroad ship (Lash), RoRo (Roll on (cid:8211) Roll off) and freights are used to move goods from the country of purchase to the buyer country.
3.6 Pitfalls and Mistakes of New Exporters These include the followings.
• Failures to obtain qualified export counselling and develop a master international marketing plan before starting an exporting business.
• Insufficient commitment by top management to overcome the initial difficulties and financial requirements of exporting.
• Insufficient care in selecting overseas distributors.
• Chasing orders from around the world instead of establishing a basis for profitable operations and orderly growth.
• Neglecting export business when income market booms.
• Failure to treat international distributors on an equal basis with domestic counterparts.
• A gullible assumption that a given market technique and product will automatically be successful in all countries.
• Unwillingness to modify products to meet the regulations or cultural references of other countries.
• Failure to print service sale and warranty messages in local languages.
• Failure to consider the use of an export management company.
79 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS • Failure to consider licensing or joint venture agreements.
• Failure to provide readily available servicing for the product.
3.7 Importing Importers are opposite of exporters.
They buy abroad and sell in the domestic markets.
An importer can identify sources of outlets through: • Retailers who import similar products • All agencies that can assist in importing • In the US, you can use the electronic bulletin boards of the World Trade Centre.
In Nigeria you can visit websites.
In importing, you take note of customhouse brokers, who are independent businesses that handle import shipment for compensation.
They act as agents for the importer once they import goods, they put them in bonded warehouses or they can abandon them or send them to another country.
Every importer should take note of how customs calculate import duties and products classification.
Any importer who wants to make a success of his business must take note of the following.
• Disclose to the customs all foreign and financial arrangements before shipping the goods.
Penalties are always high.
• Ask the advice of a customhouse broker before making the transaction.
• Calculate carefully the landed charges in advance.
4.0 CONCLUSION Export is necessary for a country so that the balance of trade will be favourable for the country.
By exporting, the economy of a country will improve.
You must locate new markets and you need counselling before exporting, you must always follow export procedures and export documents must be used for export to be successful.
Any mistake in arriving at export target, your business is likely to suffer for it.

However, international human resources have to deal with the followings.
82 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Estimated work force needs - Recruitment and selection - Training and development - Nationalism - Compensation - Discipline - Appointment termination Without adequate knowledge of the country you are going into, it will be difficult to perform the above stated functions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the differences in regional and cultural labour practices and its relationship with international business • apply the practices of selection of staff internationally • explain various methods of compensation.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Human Resources Management To select a manager for a multinational company may be easier than managing the company itself.
Basically, for a foreign manager to manage a corporation well, he needs to know all the external factors like law, politics, culture etc.
relate them well with human resources management functions like staff selection, motivation, compensation, discipline, etc so that he can succeed.
In general, human resources have to do with how human beings are used as input in an organisation so that good results are achieved.
3.2 Cultural or Regional Differences in Labour Condition If you look at different countries in the world, you will see differences in employment conditions.
We are going to look at few areas we have knowledge in terms of labour condition and compare them with what is obtainable in the Nigerian environment.
For instance, situation has been 83 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS changing in Nigeria about women in government employment.
Also, Sharia practice in some Northern States vis-à-vis male doctors and female patients or vice versa.
All these are cultural or regional differences in labour conditions.
3.2.1 Japan(cid:8217)s Jobs-For-Life Culture Disappearing Until a few years ago, it is a well-known cultural practice in Japan that once employed; you will be on the job till you die.
But today, things have changed.
For example, Toyota now regularly employs staff on contract basis which it never practised in the time past.
They do not mind now to employ a foreigner unlike before.
Now, merit rather than seniority is the yardstick for promotion or position.
Age does not matter now in job hierarchy.
This means, a younger or more brilliant person might be placed over an older person who had spent more years in the company.
This new method of doing things is having psychological effects on certain category of workers.
As a matter of fact, it has caused a number of suicides and mental breakdowns.
In Nigeria, some categories of jobs are being outsourced now in place of permanent employment.
Examples of these outsourced jobs are messengers, typists, drivers, secretaries, etc.
In Japan, certain category of jobs are outsourced permanently.
The employments have moved from being for lifetime durations to being on part time and this is becoming the order of the day.
Some jobs are now even being outsourced.
Nigeria has borrowed this system especially for those whose jobs are not specialised.
In Japan jobs like accounting, information technology, marketing, personnel management, procurement and training are being outsourced.
3.2.2 Japan(cid:8217)s Birth Rate Drop-Effects In Japan, the birth rate is going down because of birth control.
In essence, if the population is reducing, it means more jobs will be available.
Ball et al (2002) believe that Japan is worried about meeting future pension liabilities on the basis of current projections.
This means the percentage of pensioners is far higher than those who are currently engaged at work.
This will not augur well for the economy and development of Japan.
3.2.3 The Huge German-Polish Wage Gap Although Germany and Poland share boundaries, yet there is a huge wage gap between the two countries.
This has encouraged polish citizens to cross into Germany to work either legally or illegally.
In Germany, the pay of an average worker is 1500 to 2500 Dutch marks 84 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS but in Poland, it is between 150 to 250 Dutch marks.
The situation can be compared to Nigerian Federal Civil Service and State Civil Services.
For example, a Level 7 Officer earns N15, 000 per month in Niger State while that of Federal Civil Service is about N50,000.
Federal Government has been trying to narrow this gap by introducing so many salary structures.
In the universities, either State or Federal, they earn the same salary.
By so doing, workers are encouraged to remain where they are.
3.2.4 High Unemployment Rate in Nigeria It is no more news that a lot of graduates from Nigerian universities are unemployed coupled with the unemployment among the unskilled labourers.
This issue has led to exploitation of Nigerians by various employers of labour who pay paltry wages.
Nigeria has become a cheap labour country.
Most Indian companies operating in Nigeria are known for taking advantage of this problem.
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is up and doing in this area so that the situation could be addressed.
Casualisation of even skilled workers, especially at the ports has been addressed by NLC.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 List five areas that you feel could improve labour practices in Nigeria.
3.3 Minimum Wage in Nigeria In February 1987, a controversial decision was taken when the government announced a major relaxation of the nation(cid:8217)s minimum wage laws.
Under new regulations, all companies with fewer than 500 employees would be exempted from minimum wage requirements.
Previously, only companies with fewer than 50 employees have been exempted.
After concerted and vociferous protests from labour unions and indications of widespread abuse by employees, the government reversed its stance and reinstituted the original provisions.
The Federal government now pegged the minimum wage a Nigerian should earn at N7, 500; some state governments could not afford this.
To make matters worse for the states, the federal government instituted a consolidated salary structure for its workers.
This greatly increased the disparity between the salary of a state worker and a federal worker.
International businessmen should have this at the back of their minds when coming to do business in Nigeria.
85 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.4 Staffing Employing good staff for your company may involve employing not just local people, but also foreigners, that is, expatriates.
The good thing is that opportunities to work outside your country are increasing on a daily basis.
One thing about working abroad is that you must be: - bicultural - knowledgeable in business practices in the home country - knowledgeable in business practices and customers(cid:8217) care in the host country - able to speak the language of your host country.
3.4 Sources of Managers There are three major sources of managers: home country, host country and third country.
Home Country International corporations such as Chevron Oil Plc, Mobil Oil Plc prefer using managers from their home countries.
This is because they are familiar with their own professionals and know their skills.
In situation where the host nationals are unavailable, they send some selected key staff for training at their international headquarters/home country, who will later come back to host country to train the local staff.
International corporations equally source for staff from home countries so that they can come and manage strategic offices in the host countries.
Headquarters representatives can equally be got from the home country to represent the international corporation.
Host Country Managers can be employed from the host country.
They are employed for the advantage that they are familiar with the local customs, culture and language.
Initial cost of employment is always low.
Managers in host countries may be unaware of the home country policies and practices and if care is not taken, there may be communication gap between the home country and the host country.
And this may bring policy sabotage and cross-purposes which may affect the company 86 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS badly.
But all this can be eliminated if there is good communication and interaction between the home and host managers.
Third Country This is when managers can be sourced from other countries apart from the host and home countries.
An example that readily comes to mind is that of an international corporation in Nigeria with headquarters in the US but which employed a Ghanaian as a manager.
The Ghanaian is a third country manager.
3.4.2 Selection and Training Selection and training of managers depend on whether they are from home, host or third country.
Home Country You select staff from your country, train and send them abroad.
They are encouraged to study and learn the language of host country.
This type of managers is likely to have family problems as a result of living apart from their families.
Host Country This could be done in two ways: - host country nationals hired in the home country.
- host country nationals hired in the host country.
Third Country Hiring personnel outside host or home country: The benefit is that they can be employed on lower wages; it is prevalent in developing countries.
Employing from third country will depend on the followings.
- Host country attitude- this is the attitude of the host country to managers from third country.
- Generalisation difficulty- because of the similarities in culture or nationalisation, what most countries do is to have workers based on ability and experience rather than race or citizenship.
87 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.4.3 Expatriates An expatriate is a person living outside of his or her own country of citizenship.
These sets of people are employed for international business.
Basically, expatriates have some problems, these include: - Their family- Ball et al (2002) believe that nine out of 10 expatriates(cid:8217) failures are family related; their children suffer a lot because of mobility.
- Not having family in one place.
- Inability to visit family regularly.
3.4.4 Women In the US, majority of students are women.
Naturally, this has resulted into having a large percentage of women at the work-place.
And they are becoming more successful at work.
In Nigeria, the situation is the same; there has been a high increase in women enrolment in higher institutions.
More women are now in business, banking, politics, etc.
Before now, women were seen in Nigeria as those whose education would end in the kitchen.
But the situation has changed now.
Women are found in plenty in all the professions.
Women are encouraged in Nigeria.
There is a Ministry of Women Affairs, and women are given opportunities in politics.
Education, which naturally brings enlightenment has broken down the proverbial glass ceiling which used to restrict women in the past.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss sources of labour in any country for an international business.
3.5 Compensation Compensation has always been a major problem in organisations.
Paying appropriate wages for expatriate staff and local staff is problematic for organisations.
What some organisations do is to pay the same basic salary for both categories of staff but different allowances.
3.5.1 Salaries Expatriate and domestic staff workers are mostly paid the same salaries in most countries worldwide; the third country managers are equally 88 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS treated in the same way.
However, allowances may differ so that an expatriate will not fall behind in this regard.
3.5.2 Allowances Allowances are special payments for expatriates to compensate them and also to cushion the extra cost they must incur to live in the host country.
Ball et al (2002) enumerated the following allowances.
- Housing allowance; - Cost-of-living allowance is based on differences in the prices of food, utilities, transport, entertainment, clothing, personal services and medical expenses oversea, compared to the prices paid for these items in the home country; - Allowance for tax differentials; - Education allowance; and - Moving and orientation allowances.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Discuss the importance of salaries and allowances in an international business.
3.5.3 Bonuses These are compensation payments in addition to basic salary and allowances paid to expatriates because of hardship, inconveniences or hazards.
They may include: - oversea premium - contract termination payments - home leave.
4.0 CONCLUSION Recruitment of managers for multinational companies is done from home country, host country and third country.
Good salaries, allowances and bonuses are paid expatriates with the aim of encouraging them to stay.
89 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS There must be a careful selection process of managers, which will involve a careful study of the problems associated with human resources management of various countries.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit you have learnt the followings.
• Various cultural differences on jobs like Japan(cid:8217)s-job-for-life, salary differences in Germany and Poland, Nigerian minimum wage.
• The comparison among the home country, host country and third country nationals as international corporation executives.
• The increasing number of women workers worldwide.
• Various salaries, allowances and bonuses for local and expatriate staff.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Discuss the sources of managers for international corporations.

90 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT 2 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING AND TAXATION CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 International Accounting Diversity 3.2 Principal Accounting Differences Across Countries 3.2.1 Origins of Differences 3.2.2 Classifications System 3.2.3 Principal Differences 3.2.4 The Issues 3.3 The Process of Accounting Standardisation 3.4 International Taxation 3.4.1 Tax Jurisdiction 3.4.2 Tax Types 3.4.3 Income Categories and Taxation 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Accounting system and taxation differ from country to country; because of these, some countries find it difficult to present accounting information in different ways to different countries.
International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) has been pursuing a goal of single accounting system for the whole world.
The goal is that investors will be willing to invest in certain nations if their companies(cid:8217) financial reports are more transparent and reliable.
Many countries also have system of accounting standards, just as the United States.
The International Accounting Standard Board based in London, England, exists to achieve international harmonisation of accounting principles.
Thus, this unit examines international accounting systems.
91 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain accounting practices and differences across countries and see how the difference alters the compositeness of firm in international markets • identify areas of accounting that should constitute problems or success in coming years • explain the philosophies of taxation and its effect on domestic and foreign market.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 International Accounting Diversity It is obvious that accounting principles differ, but in itself it is not a problem.
The major problem is the distortion that may be introduced by lenders, investors or government policy makers.
ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE IDENTICAL FORMS ACCOUNTING SIMILAR DISSIMILAR TREATMENT SIMILAR A B Logical practice.
Results are May/May not be comparable logical.
Results May/May not be comparable DISSIMILAR C D Illogical practice.
Results are Logical Practice.
not comparable Results may not be comparable.
Accounting diversity can be traced to when a firm that is either similar or dissimilar is operating similar or dissimilar accounting system.
BOX A Similar firms operating similar accounting systems compared within these companies will be logical in practice and easily interpreted.
92 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BOX B Similar firms among a dissimilar accounting system.
Results in terms of comparison have the probability of either being or not being comparable.
The accounting system may or may not be logical.
BOX C Firms that are dissimilar yet their accounting systems are similar.
The practice in this type of firm is illogical i.e.
one may not be able to compare their results.
BOX D Different firms with different accounting practices, though logical, but their result are not comparable.
3.2 Principal Accounting Differences Across Countries Czinzokota et al (2002), opine that international accounting diversity can lead to any of the following problems in international business.
(i) Poor or improper business decision-making (ii) May hinder the ability of a firm or enterprise to raise capital in different or foreign markets.
(iii) May hinder or prevent a firm from monitoring competitive factors across firms, industries and countries.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Discuss the problems of accounting diversity in an international business.
3.2.1 Origin of Difference Accounting practices in the world is linked to people, places and events.
In Nigeria, the accounting system is structured after the British style.
Accounting practice looks at the users of this accounting information i.e.
investors, lenders and governments.
From the above diagram, one can vividly see the origin of the difference in accounting; for example the accounting system of Italy differs from that of Ireland.
This is because the Ireland accounting system is UK-based while that of Italy is tax- based.
Also, accounting system of Ireland is micro based while that of Italy is macro uniform.
94 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.2.2 Classification of System The above diagram of NOBES divided the accounting system into two basic systems of micro based and macro uniform.
Micro based is sub-divided into Business, Economic Theory, Business Practice and Pragmatic British Origin.
Macro uniform is subdivided into Continental, Government Tax, Legal and Government Economics.
3.2.4 The Issues Different accounting system means markets must be segmented so as to enable firms and companies understand the accounting information.
It therefore means accountants will continue to do the job of interpreting accounting information, being marketers and also bookkeepers.
The following are accounting differences across countries.
i.
Accounting for Research and Development Expenses It is believed that research and development accounting needs to take note of costs so that it can be spread across so that profit will be assured to be made in future.
ii.
Accounting for Fixed Assets iii.
Inventory Accounting Treatment These include use of first-in first-out method and average cost system in dealing with inventory.
iv.
Capitalising or Expenses Leases v. Pension Plan Accounting vi.
Accounting for Income Taxes vii.
Foreign Currency Translation viii.
Accounting for Mergers and Acquisition ix.
Consolidation of Equity Securities Holdings.
95 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.3 The Process of Accounting Standardisation Until 1973, a Committee of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) established accounting principles in the United States.
CPAs are accountants licensed by their state governments on the basis of educational background, a rigorous certification examination and in most jurisdictions, relevant practical work experience.
In 1973, the seven members Financial Accounting Standards Board was created as an independent standard-setting organisation.
Regulations for auditors are promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
United States companies, whose stocks or bonds are traded publicly, must conform to the rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a Federal Government agency.
Tax laws and regulations are encountered at the federal level by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and at the local level by the state and municipal government agencies.
Many countries other than the United States also have system of accounting standards.
The International Accounting Standards Board based in London, England, exists to achieve international harmonisation of accounting principles.
3.4 International Taxation We may not understand international taxation, except we understand what tax is in our home country.
Taxation is a system of raising money to finance government activities.
All governments require payment of money-taxes-from their citizens.
Government uses tax revenues to pay soldiers and police, to build dams and roads, to operate schools and hospitals, to provide food for the poor and medical care for the elderly and for other purposes.
Without taxes to fund its activities, government will not be able to function.
Throughout history, people have debated the amount and kinds of taxes that a government should impose on her citizens.
Unpopular taxes have caused public protests, riots, and even revolutions.
In political campaigns, a candidate(cid:8217)s views on taxation may partly determine his popularity with voters.
Taxation is the most important source of revenue for modern governments, typically accounting for 90 percent or more of their income.
The remainder comes from borrowing and from charging fees or services.
Countries differ considerably in the amount of taxes they collect.
In the United States, about 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) went for tax payments in 2000.
The 30 percent figure is relatively low from a historical standpoint.
As a result of a new round of tax cuts in 2003, the tax percentage share of GDP was expected to be 96 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS lower than at any time since 1959 when many major government programmes, including medicare, did not exist in Canada.
About 35 percent of the country(cid:8217)s gross domestic product goes for taxes.
In France, the figure is 45 percent and in Sweden it is 51 percent.
In addition to using taxation to raise money, government may raise or lower taxes to achieve social and economic objectives, or to achieve political popularity with certain groups.
Taxation can redistribute a society(cid:8217)s wealth by imposing a heavier tax burden on one group in order to find services for another.
Also, some economists consider taxation an important tool for maintaining the stability of a country(cid:8217)s economy.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 What are the uses of taxes to a country?
3.4.2 Tax Jurisdiction Czinkota et al (2002) believes that there are two approaches to international taxation.
The first is the residential approach to international taxation which taxes the international income of its residents without regard to where the income is earned.
The second is the territorial approach to transactional income, which taxes all parties, regardless of country of residence, within its territorial jurisdiction.
3.4.3 Tax Types Taxes are generally divided into direct and indirect taxes.
Direct tax is calculated on actual income of individuals or an organisation(cid:8217)s income.
Indirect tax includes such taxes as sales tax, tariffs, and value added tax.
A broader classification of tax types include • Individual income tax • Corporate income tax • Payroll • Consumption taxes which include - General sales tax - Excise tax 97 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Value added tax - Tariff • Property tax • Estate, inheritance, and gift taxes • Other taxes include poll tax.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Are you a civil servant or a salaried worker?
Name the taxes you pay to government.
3.4.4 Income Categories And Taxation There are three primary methods used for the transfer of funds across tax jurisdictions.
i. Royalties- Are under license for the use of intangible assets such as patents, designs, trademarks, techniques or copyrights.
ii.
Interests- Are the payments for the use of capital loan for the financing of normal business activity.
iii.
Dividends- are income paid or deemed paid to the shareholders of the corporation from the residual earning of operations.
4.0 CONCLUSION Accounting system worldwide differs but International Accounting Standard Board is charged with the responsibility of harmonising accounting standards worldwide.
This accounting system from country to country must be studied by the international businessman before going into a new country.
Just like accounting, taxes are sources of revenues for government.
Tax is not charged by individual firms but by government on both the government and individual.
These two must be studied and examined, to see what area concern you as an international businessman.
98 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt the followings: • Reporting accounting information differs from country to country • Accounting system classification is both micro and macro based • Taxes are both direct and indirect • Accounting information reporting and type of taxes affect international business activities.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Discuss the various sources of accounting diversity.

99 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT 3 INTERNATIONAL SERVICES CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Differences between Services and Products 3.1.1 Link Between Services and Goods 3.1.2 Stand-Alone Services 3.1.3 Role Of Services 3.2 The Role of Global Services in the World Economy 3.3 Global Transformation in the Service Sector 3.4 Problems in International Service Trade 3.4.1 Data Collection Problem 3.4.2 Global Regulations of Services 3.5 Services And E-Commerce 3.6 Typical International Services 3.7 Starting to Offer Service Internationally 3.8 Strategic Indications 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Services are integral part of world trade, the links between services and goods are essential.
In essence, service and goods go hand in hand.
Services play a very great role in the world economy.
Nevertheless, services have some problems associated with delivery, especially across borders.
Types of international services business will be discussed briefly.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the role of service in international business • explain the complex nature of international trade services to goods • explain the basis used in making international business in service a success • identify stand-alone services and how they have become very important to world trade • identify competitive advantage of firms in the service sector.
100 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Difference between Services and Products Kotler et al (2002) define service as any act or performance that one party can offer to another and does not result in the ownership of anything, its production may or may not be tied to a physical product.
To differentiate the two therefore, the following definition would serve.
A good is an object, a device, or a thing while a service is a deed, a performance, or an effort made.
Czinkota et al (2002) believe that service firms do not have products in the form of reproduced solutions to customers(cid:8217) problems; they have processes as solutions to such problems.
Service is said to be the fastest growing sector in the world trade.
The service sector is becoming a global phenomenon.
3.1.1 Link between Services and Goods Goods are products which are offered for sale.
One interesting aspect is that some goods cannot be sold without accompanying them with service.
For instance, a purchase of aircraft, which is a good (product), is most times followed with service like training of personnel, maintenance, and continuous technological update.
The link between service and goods can be demonstrated by aircraft manufacturers and their customers, who are in most cases airlines.
Airline Distribution Price Service Frequ Air Craft ency Transport Propose Flight Insight Service service Food & Drinks Marketing Positioning (Weighted toward Evident) Tangible Element Intangible Element 101 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Just as goods are accompanied with service for customers(cid:8217) satisfaction, so also is service not complete until a product is used satisfactorily as illustrated by the above diagram.
In essence, physical goods are used for service provision.
In the diagram above, an airline that provides transport service has a plane as a product, how good the plane is, will have positive or negative effect on service provision.
As passengers board the plane, another physical product is given to them in form of food and drinks to make their flight enjoyable.
This is complementary service.
It is given to ensure satisfaction and future patronage.
In essence, service and goods complement each other to customers(cid:8217) satisfaction.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Differentiate between service and a product 3.1.2 Stand Alone Service Service mix is divided into six categories as listed below.
i.
Pure tangible goods.
ii.
Tangible goods with accompanying service e.g.
computer and installation service.
iii.
Hybrid-offering with equal parts of service and goods i.e.
patronising restaurant for food and service.
iv.
Major service with accompanying minor goods and services, e.g.
travelling in a plane and being served with food.
v. Pure service- This is purely services i.e.
a psychotherapist.
The fifth division of service, which is pure service, is what you learn here and to know more about it, you must look at some basic characteristics.
(a) Intangible- It means service that can(cid:8217)t be seen, tested, felt, learned or smelled before they are bought.
To succeed in selling this type of service, you need to know one of the following marketing tools.
- Place 102 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - People - Equipment - Communication material - Symbols - Price.
(b) Variability- Service provision is done by different people even if they are working for the same organisation where what they are provided brings about variability in service provision.
These three areas of service provision may reduce variability, if seriously explored.
- Investing in goods, hiring and training procedures - Standardising the service performance process throughout the organisation - Monitoring customer satisfaction.
(c) Perishable- Service cannot be stored.
For instance, a plane that takes off with 10 empty seats cannot be redeemed or a hotelier who could not get a guest in a room for the previous night cannot regain such loss.
The solution is to improve on his marketing strategy.
This is where the law of demand and supply comes in.
In demand- - You differentiate pricing - Cultivate non-peak demand - Develop complementary service - Reservation system should be developed.
In Supply- - Part time worker should be used for peak period.
- Introduce peak time efficiency.
- Increase consumers(cid:8217) participation.
- Shared service can be provided.
- Develop facilities for future expansion.
103 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS (d) Inseparability- The provider of service and the service itself is seen as same i.e.
a cashier in a bank attending to a customer rudely is seen as the bank, that is, and he is equated with the bank.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss four basic characteristics of an international business.
3.1.3 The Role of Service Service, be it in the US or Nigerian economy has been able to: - create jobs - provide increasing service worldwide; for instance, it has generated enough revenue for USA.
In year 2000 alone the revenue was $295 billion.
3.2 The Role of Global Services in the World Economy In the world economy, service provision worldwide has two basic areas that have impacted the world economy.
i.
There has been a rise in service sector globally, as such; some economies GDP have improved due to service provision.
For instance in Argentina it accounts for 65 percent GDP, 64percent in Mexico and 65 percent in South Africa.
ii.
A lot of economies are shifting away from traditional economic development pattern and are concentrating on developing strong service sector.
Nigeria has even created a ministry for tourism, to encourage service provision.
3.3 Global Transformation in the Service Sector Service provision worldwide has increased tremendously.
There are basically two factors that have led to the global transformation in the service sector.
These factors include: 1.
Technology.
When we talk about technology, computers come into mind, for instance, car designs that were done manually are being done by computers now.
This is a development in the service provision.
Technology has equally reduced the cost of 104 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS communication.
Service provision is increasing without the presence of human being i.e.
banking service with automatic teller machine.
This equally has led to growth in service provision worldwide.
The growth in websites has also positively impacted corporate organisations.
Distance and barriers have been removed.
A customer in Japan and Nigeria transacting business need not worry about distance because technology has removed that barrier.
2.
Environment.
In this situation, regulation and deregulation have increased the chances of service provision worldwide.
- Reduction in government regulation, which has brought about deregulation, has given rise to service provision.
- Deregulation in the transport sector has given rise to increase in service worldwide.
- Regulation of service industries by service groups is another reason.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
List five areas of pure service that you know.
2.
List four characteristics of service.
3.4 Problems in International Service Trade There are basically two problem areas of international service trade.
They include data collection problem and global regulation services 3.4.1 Data Collection Problem It is difficult getting information on people who provide service worldwide.
An example is an Irish citizen working for a Canadian financial consulting firm in Sweden advising an Israeli citizen living in India on management of funds deposited in a Swiss bank.
It may not be easy recording and keeping business information on this Israeli citizen.
3.4.2 Global Regulation of Services It is equally divided into two: - Barriers to entry and - Problem of performing services abroad.
105 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Barriers to entry are always explained by countries with reference to national security and economic security.
The host country may create barriers based on protecting the infant industries.
Another area of global regulation of services is performing services abroad.
Once a service provider has access to a local market, he is faced with the problem of discriminating and non-discriminating regulations.
These regulations hinder service providers to penetrate some markets.
General agreement on trade on service (GATS) in 1995 came up to regulate services worldwide.
This is similar to GATT.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Discuss the difficulty a Nigerian may face in exporting his service outside this country.
3.5 Service and E-Commerce Electronic commerce and service have succeeded in removing distance between the user and provider of service.
Government regulations across borders have equally been removed by providing service electronically.
This equally has led to businesses that are small to look big in the internet.
It is believed that there are some providers of service and their users that have never met face-to-face.
Internet has been the basis of e-commerce.
One should take note however, that not all have access to the internet.
Language could be another barrier on the internet.
Many companies do not permit any interaction on their websites, thus missing out on feedback from visitors.
3.6 Typical International Services The following are the commonly practiced international services: i.
Construction, design and engineering services ii.
Insurance services iii.

Tourism 106 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.7 Starting To Offer Services Internationally If you want to go into the service provision sector internationally, you should take note of the following.
The service you want to provide.
Is it in support or in conjunction with goods?
The most acceptable method is to follow the method and ways goods are provided to the customers.
Czinkota et al (2002) believe that service providers, whose activities are not related to products, need a different strategy.
These individuals and firms must look for market situations abroad that are similar to the domestic market.
Another point is that a service provider must identify and understand points of transition abroad.
International service providers should equally stay informed about international projects sponsored by domestic organisations, World Bank, the United Nations, etc.
3.8 Strategic Indications For you to be successful in an international service provision, you must: - Determine the nature and the aim of the services offering core - that is, whether the services will be aimed at people or at things and whether the service act in itself will result in tangible or intangible actions.
- As a manager, you should consider other tactical variables that have an impact in the preparation of the service you want to offer.
For instance, if you are carrying out a research for services, measurement of capacity and delivery efficiency often remain highly qualitative rather than quantitative.
- Personnel issue must be looked into, if you want to provide service internationally.
- Managers of service that prefer going abroad should have close interaction with their customers.
- Pricing and financing areas should equally be looked into because service is not stored; you should have in mind the demand and supply situation of service, so as to have greater flexibility in pricing.
107 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - In distribution, the service provider should have in mind that shorter channels of distribution are better.
4.0 CONCLUSION Service and goods must be used to complement each other.
Service is intangible and goods are tangible.
Service has four characteristics which include: Intangibility, perishability, variability and incomparability.
Service has been able to create jobs and improve revenue.
In global service provision, it has led to increase in nations(cid:8217) GDP.
It should also be noted that service provision is shifting from traditional method.
Technology and the environment have transformed service provision worldwide.
Data and regulations are major problems of service worldwide.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt: • The difference between goods and services and what the characteristics of services are.
• Ways and factors used in launching business into international service market.
• How to identify problems of service provision internationally.
• Service and its growing importance in marketing of products world market.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Discuss the six types of services discussed in this study.

This unit will discuss differences between product modification and standardisation.
Products can hardly be sold without branding or packaging.
This will be examined to know the implication of these two marketing strategies.
After sales service is another powerful marketing strategy that is associated with product.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, you should be able to: • differentiate between product modification and product standardisation and which to use at an appropriate time • explain what branding and packaging are, when to use them as marketing strategy in an international business • recognise when to apply after-sales service in an international business.
109 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Product Policy Decision Kotler (I984) defines product as anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use or consumption; it includes physical objects, services, personalities, places, organisations and ideas.
Product or service differs in terms of tangibility and intangibility sometimes the two are seen as products.
Product policy changes in a company depend largely on the competition in a changing international world.
Competition is becoming tensed and this is no more based on product itself.
Kotler 1984 says, the new competition is not between what companies produce in their factories but between what they add to their factories(cid:8217) output in the form of packaging, services, advertisement, customer service, financing, delivery, advertisement, warehousing and other things that people value.
The arrival of the Japanese in the world market as a formidable trading nation has contributed immensely to the monitoring of marketing activities so as to modify or change some aspects of marketing.
The question to be asked here is why do products fail in the market even after all these monitoring?
These problems include tariff and non-tariff barriers, dumping of products, cultural insensibility, poor planning, poor timing, etc.
All these have both positive and negative effects on product policies that companies adopt for their products.
3.2 Communicating With Your Customer Communication between manufacturers and consumers matters a lot.
In the United States, there is a difference between plain English style and traditional English style.
If what is intended to be communicated to the consumer is vague there will be a problem.
Consider the following information about eye drops and see how you understand them: i. One-two drops to be instilled into eyes every six hours for four days.
Not to be taken Discard 28 days after opening.
ii.
Drop one or two drops into eyes four times a day.
Do this at regular intervals for four days.
110 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Don(cid:8217)t swallow this.
Throw this away one-month after opening.
The information in these two are the same if care is not taken, the first may be misinterpreted.
It is therefore advised that a company should state, clear, concise, brief and straightforward language on its products.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 State five benefits of clear communication with your customers.
3.2 Product Modification or Standardisation Product modification and standardisation is to make product conform to an acceptable world standard.
Of recent, inflammable products have been modified to include ozone layer friendly chemicals, businessmen worldwide must accept such.
Fuel that is being imported into Nigeria must have between 5 percent- 10 percent ethanol.
It was not so before, because of worldwide practice that ethanol must be accepted in petrol.
Standardisation is equally to make products to be of the same standard of measurement worldwide, so that size 45 shoes in Nigeria should be 45 in the USA.
If not, there should be an acceptable way of conversion so that the standard could be maintained worldwide.
3.3.1 Product Modification Product modification occurs because of the following reasons: - Legal requirements.
- Tariffs.
- Nationalism.
- Taxation.
- Climate.
Others include: - Consumers taste.
- Low personal disposable income.
111 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Illiteracy and low level of education.
- Poor maintenance standards will necessitate product change.
- Local labour costs.
3.3.2 Product Standardisation Factors which encourage product standardisation include the followings.
- Production economy of scale - Development costs - Stock costs - Components that are intangible across product models - Consumer mobility - Market homogeneity.
BENEFITS Paliwoda (1993) identified three benefits of product standardisation.
i.
Cost saving through experience.
ii.
Curve effects and economies of scale.
iii.
Consistency, with customers acknowledging consumer(cid:8217)s mobility and cross-border flows of advertisement.
iv.
The other barriers are common to all markets, such barriers are social convention regarding product use and purchasing patterns.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss four areas of benefit of product standardisation to an international businessman.
3.3.3 Product Standardisation and World Product Mandates Paliwoda (1993) defines world product mandates as the full development and production of a new product line in a subsidiary of a multinational company thereby changing the nature of the subsidiary- 112 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS parent multinational relationship to that of a strategic business or division.
He went ahead to say that world product mandate permits the subsidiary to be responsible for the development and worldwide marketing of a specific innovation.
The subsidiary needs to bargain with its parent to serve a potentially profitable mandate, but once it has, the subsidiary can use the internal market of the multinational organization to distribute and control new process.
It is necessary, therefore, to examine the cost benefits from the viewpoint of the three parties involved: host country, subsidiary company and the parent multinational/organisation.
Product classification and standardisation are related.
Product classification Degree of standardisation Industrial goods.
HY Consumers(cid:8217) durables (cid:8211) recent trends T-shirts.
Consumers(cid:8217) non-durables used outside home e.g.
cosmetics.
Consumers(cid:8217) durables (cid:8211) traditional values affect product e.g.
formal/work dress.
Consumers(cid:8217) non-durable (cid:8211) used inside home e.g.
instant coffee.
HO 3.4 Branding Branding is a means of distinguishing a company(cid:8217)s products.
It is a means whereby the consumer can identify a particular product, and, if satisfied with it, ask for it by name.
Branding can be seen to fall in these categories.
i. Descriptive, like cornflakes and British rail.
ii.
Associative, like fruit bursts and intercity.
iii.
Stand alone, like Hob-Nobs or Casey Jones.
International branding from the manufacturer(cid:8217)s viewpoint according to Poliwoda (1993) has seven types, each with its advantages and disadvantages.
113 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 1.
No Brand Products Advantages - Lower production cost.
- Lower monitoring cost.
- Lower legal cost.

7.
Local Brands Advantages - Gains strong patronage in local market - Local identification - Avoidance of taxation on international brand - Allowing variations of quantity and quality across markets Disadvantages - Higher marketing cost - Higher inventory cost - Loss of economies of scale - Diffuse image.
8.
Worldwide Brand Advantages - Maximum marketing efficiency - Prediction of advertising costs - Elimination of brand confusion - Acceptable to people across cultures - Appeals to upper class people across countries - Easy identification/recognition for international travellers - Uniform worldwide image.
Disadvantages - Assuming market homogeneity 116 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Problems with black and gray markets - Possibility of negative connotation - Requiring quality and quantity consistency - Legal complications.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 What are the pros and cons of using a local brand while marketing internationally?
3.4.1 Selection of Brand Name A brand name when selected should be able to meet some of these criteria.
A good brand name should: - be short - be unique - be memorable - connote quality - be pleasant to hearing - be descriptive of the product - be distinctive - be pronounceable - be acceptable - be legal - be suggestive of the product it represents - be easy to remember.
Many products fail this test in an international market.
117 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Brands that have succeeded worldwide include: - Coke - Pepsi - Honda - Rolls Royce - Toyota - Sony.
3.4.2 Types of Branding The following are the classification of brands.
i.
Individual brand names.
Procter & Gamble gives a different name for different products.
ii.
Blanket family name for all products.
iii.
Separate family names for all products.
This is mostly practised by departmental stores.
iv.
Company name and individual product name.
3.4.3 Steps in Branding The following steps are used.
i.
Information gathering using one or more in-depth telephone interviews with key members of the organisation ii.
Old fashion brain storming iii.
Individual name development iv.
Feedback and evaluation v. Limited trademark search and profanity check vi.
Report preparation.
118 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Avoiding eight great blunders in branding i.
People respond most positively to names.
Try to avoid abstract names.
ii.
Avoid names devoid of imagination and emotional appeal.
iii.
Avoid names made up of alphabets like AZY, ZYB,GYT, etc.
iv.
Avoid vulgar and abusive names.
v. Avoid names that are already well known in the market.You should be original in your own brand name.
vi.
Avoid allowing other professionals to give your product a name that has no marketing value.
vii.
Avoid meaningless names.
viii.
Avoid ugly names.
3.5 Brand Piracy Piracy is copying of other people(cid:8217)s work.
There are four ways competing companies can pirate some brands.
i.
Outright piracy Products look the same in form and trademark as the original.
ii.
Reverse engineering Stripping down the original product and then copying it, underselling the original manufacturer.
iii.
Counterfeiting Altering the products quality without altering the trademark.
iv.
Passing off Modifying both the product and trademark, adapting a trademark that is similar in appearance, aesthetic quality or meaning to the original product.
119 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS v. Wholesale infringement This involves the questionable registration of famous brand name overseas rather than the introduction of faked products.
3.6 Packaging Packaging in some cases is not seen as a promotional tool, but simply a barrier, a way to protect products from other forces of competition.
Packaging size changes with personal disposable income, but also with available channel of distribution.
Packaging design is affected by: - type of distribution channel - climate Packaging from whichever angle you look at it is to: i. protect the product ii.
use it for promotion.
3.7 Five Corporate Strategies to Handle Counterfeiting Paliwoda (1993) identified five strategies to handle counterfeiting.
(i) Compete and attempt to overcome the opposition.
(ii) Avoid conflict and withdraw from the fray.
(iii) Accommodate the opposition, where the objective is appeasement.
(iv) Collaborate.
(v) Compromise.
4.0 CONCLUSION To go international with a product, you need to package it, brand it in such a way that it will get to consumers safe and sound.
These could be used as promotional strategy.
120 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Product must conform to international standard by way of standardisation and modification.
Brand name must be carefully chosen to suit the occasion; it should be local or international.

As a result of this, relevant agencies have been set up to help in this direction.
There are so many agencies in Nigeria regulating export and import activities and also, there are agencies on how foreigners can set up business in Nigeria.
This unit examines these organisations that aid international business.
Some of these agencies are, the Central Bank, Export-Import Bank, Nigerian Export Promotion Council, Nigeria Investment Promotion 122 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Council, among others.
Their functions and contributions to international trade are what you are going to study in this unit.

- Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission - Nigeria Export Promotion Council - Nigeria Export-Import Bank.
- Nigeria Export Processing Zone Scheme - The Central Bank of Nigeria 3.2 Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) Making decision whether to invest in a country is never an easy task.
It requires crucial information, research and planning.
This led to the formation of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) in July 1995.
The NIPC is an indispensable ally of potential foreign investors.
The NIPC is tasked with overcoming the bureaucracy that had previously discouraged foreign investors especially from taking advantage of investment opportunities in Nigeria.
123 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Located in Nigeria(cid:8217)s capital, Abuja, the NIPC building is open, modern and efficient-looking.
As a one-stop necessity for potential investors, it serves as a central investment approval agency, streamlining the activities of ministries, government departments and agencies involved in investment promotion.
It helps in matters such as registration or incorporation of foreign enterprises, obtaining expatriate quotas or finding out specifics about the different tax regimes for sectors like cargo, oil or mining.
It also serves as a catalyst for injecting the much-desired foreign capital into Nigerian economy through investments.
It allows foreigners and local investors alike wishing to own up to 100 percent shares in investments in the country.
It also encourages and promotes competition in the economy.
Functions The NIPC performs the following functions: • advises government on policy issues related to investment.
• guarantees the protection of foreign interests in Nigeria against expropriation.
• administers appropriate incentives packages available to investors.
• guarantees transferability of profits and other funds by investors.

3.3 Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) was established through the promulgation of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council Act No.
26 of 1976 and formally inaugurated in March 1977.
This Act was amended by decree no.
72 of 1979 and further amended by the Nigerian Export Promotions) Decree no 41 of 1988 and complemented by the Export Promotion Miscellaneous Provisions Decree No.
18 of 1986.
Furthermore, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council Amendment Decree No 64 of 1992 was promulgated to enhance the performance of the Council by minimising bureaucratic bottlenecks, and increasing autonomy in dealing with members of the Organised Private Sector.
The vision of NEPC is to make the non-oil export sector a significant contributor to Nigeria(cid:8217)s GDP, while its vision is to facilitate opportunities for exporters to promote sustainable economic development.
The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) is the federal agency charged with the responsibility of developing diversifying and promoting non- oil export products in foreign markets.
Alder Consulting was recently engaged to oversee and implement the marketing of the Council locally and internationally.
Preliminary research indicated that the council had no brand standards and there was little awareness of its role in the market.
Furthermore, information about NEPC and the export sector in Nigeria was not easily accessible.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Name five services provided by NIPC to international business.
125 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.3.1 Export For Beginners An exporter is someone who sells goods or services in a foreign market in order to make profit.
Exporters can be classified into the following categories.
Export Merchant: - An exporter who buys goods or products for export from manufacturers and producers within the country.
Manufacturing Exporter: - A company which, apart from manufacturing certain products, is also exporting the product.
Getting Started Registration with NEPC The firm which wishes to export has to be registered either as a corporate body or a cooperative society with the Nigerian Export Promotion Council.
The NEPC is the federal agency charged with the responsibility of promoting export of made in Nigeria goods.
NEPC is also responsible for the registration of new entrants into the exporting business.
The relevant application forms, which can be obtained at zonal offices, is to be duly completed and returned to NEPC offices accompanied with the following documents.
- Copy of certificate of incorporation/evidence of registration (applicable to co-operative societies) - Memorandum and articles of association - Certified true copy of Form C.O.7 (particulars of directors of the Company) - Copy of current tax clearance certificate.
Registration takes approximately two weeks after submission of all required documents.
The exporter is then issued with a certificate with a code number.
Renewal of registration with NEPC as an exporter is compulsory every two years.
It can be done by submitting the following documents: - Current company tax clearance certificate - Evidence of export performance within the two years - Certified true copy of Form C.O.7.
126 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Regulated goods to be exported out of the country also have to be duly registered by the National Agency for Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the Standards Organization of Nigeria (S.O.N).
In order to register a regulated product at NAFDAC, the prospective exporter writes to the Director-General of NAFDAC, an application accompanied with the stipulated fees per consignment of intended export attaching the following documents.
- Evidence of registration of the regulated product with NAFDAC - Registration certificate granted by NEPC The following details of the goods should also be provided.
- Batch Numbers - Date of Manufacture - Expiry date or best before date - Destination of intended export - Certificate of analysis of the product batch by batch - Name and full address of the manufacturer.
The Agency issues an export certificate if: - establishment maintains the standard requirements of goods manufacturing practice - the regulated product passes NAFDAC laboratory tests.
Exporters of regulated products also have to contact the nearest Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) office and submit the following documents.
- Request for product certification - Test report.
A product which falls into more than one regulated category will need application for each category.
A product certificate is then issued which has a validity of three years from the date of issue.
A list of regulated products can be obtained from the SON website.
127 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 3.4 Nigerian Export-Import Bank The Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) was established by Act 38 of 1991 as an Export Credit Agency (ECA) with a share capital of N500,000,000 (Five Hundred Million Naira) held equally by the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Central Bank of Nigeria.
The Bank which replaced the Nigerian Export Credit Guarantee and Insurance Corporation earlier set up under Act 15 of 1988 has the following main statutory functions.
- Provision of export credit guarantee and export credit insurance facilities to its clients.
- Provision of credit in local currency of its clients in supports.
- Establishment and management of funds connected with exports.
- Maintenance of a foreign exchange revolving fund for lending to exporters who need to import foreign and also to facilitate export production.
- Maintenance of a trade information system in support of export business.
- Provision of domestic credit insurance where such a facility is likely to assist exports.
The bank, at present, provides short and medium term loans to Nigerian exporters.
It also provides short-term guarantees for loans granted by Nigerian banks to exporters as well as credit insurance against political and commercial risks in the event of non-payment by foreign buyers.
The bank is also the government(cid:8217)s National Guarantor under the ECOWAS Inter-State Road Transit Programme.
The bank(cid:8217)s authorised capital as at December 31 2006 was N50 billion with a fully paid-up portion amounting to N11 billion.
3.4.1 Products/Services of NEXIM Direct Lending Facility (DLF) NEXIM lends money directly to Nigerian exporters to fund their purchase of capital goods, raw materials, packaging materials and spare parts through the direct loans facility.
The facility also covers the provision of infrastructure as well as revitalisation and modernisation of plants/machinery.
Providers of export services in the areas of consultancy, tourism, oil and gas, etc, are also eligible for support.
128 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS It is provided in both local and foreign currency.
Typically, NEXIM advances the funds directly to the Nigerian exporter, and these funds are repaid within a maximum period of seven years including a minimum period of two years.
ECOWAS Interstate Road Transit Scheme (ISRT) The scheme is designed to promote free flow of goods among member states; free of duties, taxes and restrictions while in waiting, escort system and also to check the diversion of goods consigned for a specific destination.
NEXIM is the national guarantor for Nigeria under this scheme and is responsible for managing the risks.
The risks covered include the diversion of goods within a country other than the country of destination, which would result in a loss of import duties/charges that could have been paid to the Customs authorities in the country the diversion occurs.
This implies that the risks to be covered by NEXIM in Nigeria is the import duty accruable to the Nigeria Customs Service based on the invoice value of the transiting goods only and not on damage or loss of consignment.
Export Credit Guarantee Facility (ECGF) NEXIM(cid:8217)s export credit guarantee facility is designed to protect Nigerian banks against the risks of non-payment for loans or advances granted to exporters to meet short-term export contracts.
Pre-and post (cid:8211) shipment guarantees are available under the facility for a period of 180 days.
This facility does not cover the risks of non-payment resulting from any fraudulent act of the exporter or his agents and risk of non-payment resulting from the failure of the exporter to fulfill the terms of the export contract or negligence on his part.
Other risks excluded include non-payment as a result of default of the exporter(cid:8217)s agent or collecting banks as well as non-payment resulting from physical damage, which should normally be insured with commercial insurance companies.
Export Credit Insurance Facility (ECIF) One of the major problems facing exporters is the non-payment for goods exported.
Non-payment may result from the buyer(cid:8217)s insolvency or other events outside the control of the exporters and the buyers.
NEXIM(cid:8217)s export credit insurance facility is designed to protect Nigerian exporters against the risks of non-payment for goods and services exported on credit terms as a result of commercial/political events.
129 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS The facility covers both pre-and post-shipment risks for maximum period of 180 days.
However, the facility excludes the risks normally insured by commercial insurance companies or other government departments, foreign risks, insolvency or default of exporter(cid:8217)s agent or collecting back and failure of the exporter to fulfill the terms of the contract or negligence on his part.
Foreign Input Facility (FIF) This provides manufacturers of export products foreign currency loans to import capital equipment, packaging and raw materials to produce finished products for export.
The facility has a maximum tenor of seven years inclusive of a moratorium period of not more than two years.
It is repayable in foreign currency.
Local Input Facility (LIF) This is a medium for long-term facility and is provided in local currency to enable exporters finance capital purchases and other activities that would require more than one year to repay.
The facility has a maximum tenor of seven years inclusive of the moratorium period of not more than two years.
NDE Facility (NDEF) This facility is designed to provide direct financial assistance to qualified Nigerian graduates (the participants) to enable them undergo tutelage with established exporters under the Start-Your-Own-Business (SYOB) Programme, prior to their exporting eligible goods and services themselves.
The objective is to create the required linkage for registered companies/cooperatives owned by jobless graduates to go through practical trainings and guidance with reputable exporters, who may in turn assist them in securing export contracts from overseas and/or outsource some aspects of their businesses to them.
National Sesame Seeds Credit Facility (NSSEP) This is available to provide necessary financial assistance to qualified registered companies under a special credit scheme for the exportation of sesame seeds and to assist the target companies to directly access short-term pre-and post-shipment finance in support of export of sesame seeds with a view to increasing the quantity as well as quality of sesame seeds exported from Nigeria annually.
130 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Rediscounting and Refinancing Facility (RRF) This helps banks to provide pre and post-shipment finance in local currency to support non-oil exports.
The RRF gives exporters access to the bank(cid:8217)s export portfolios at preferential rates.
The refinancing scheme provides a bank with credit of up to one year.
Short-term pre-shipment credit of up to 120 days and post shipment credit of up to 60 days is provided under the rediscounting scheme.
Special Cassava Export Credit Facility (SCECF) Following the establishment of the Presidential Initiative on cassava export promotion by Mr. President in February 2004, NEXIM was selected as a key member of the Sub-Committee on Finance and Export Proceeds Repatriation and specifically requested to support the initiative.
To this end, the management of NEXIM considered and consented to the establishment of a special cassava export credit facility to allow for direct disbursement of approved loans to qualified exporters of cassava products.
Stocking Facility (SF) This is provided in local currency and it enables manufacturers of exportable goods to procure adequate stocks of raw materials to keep their production at optimal levels.
The stocking facility is available for up to one year and is granted at rates capable of enhancing the competitiveness of manufactured export.
Textile Revolving Fund (TRF) This is provided in local currency and it enables manufacturers of exportable goods to procure adequate stocks of raw materials to keep their production at optimal levels.
The stocking facility is available for up to one year and is granted at rates capable of enhancing the competitiveness of manufactured export.
3.5 Nigeria(cid:8217)s Export Processing Free Zone Scheme (EPFZS) Since the inception of the new democratic administration led by President Olusegun Obasanjo in May 29, 1999, efforts have been made to attract both local and foreign investors to the country to boost Nigeria(cid:8217)s economy.
It is stressing the obvious that the path to industrialisation will involve discipline, focus and hard work from all 131 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS sectors of the economy.
In this light, the diversification of the economy has led to de-emphasising the role of oil production and exports within the country(cid:8217)s economy.
Much needed focus has thus been devoted to other sectors like solid minerals, tourism, telecommunication, commerce and industry.
All these efforts towards economic development led in November 1991 to the establishment of the Export Processing Free Zone Scheme (EPFSZ).
This scheme allows for interested persons to set up industries and business within demarcated zones known as Export Processing Zones, (EPZs) principally with the objective of exporting the goods and services manufactured or produced within the zones.
However, this novel scheme was slowed down by political manipulations.
It thus took another decade before it was inaugurated by the then President Obasanjo.
The multi-billion naira Calabar Export Processing Zone (CSPZ) came into being recently.
In a nutshell, the scheme is to promote the diversification of the export base of the nation through the acceleration of export business with attendant loaded incentives; this, it is perceived, will include industrial production, offshore banking, insurance and reinsurance, international stocks, commodities and mercantile exchange, commercial industrial research, agriculture and agro-allied industry, mineral processing, as well as international tourist resort development and operation.
The Calabar Zone has been designated as the primary EPZ territory and a total of 80 serviced plots have been reserved for prospective investors for self-built factories.
Tax and Other Incentives The incentives that come to inventors in the designated EPZ territories are as follows.
- Tax holiday relief, legislative provisions pertaining to taxes.
- Levies, duties and foreign exchange would not apply within EPZs repatriation of foreign capital investment in EPZs at any time capital appreciation of the investment.
- Unrestricted remittance of profits and dividends earned by foreign investors in EPZs.
- No import or export licenses required rent-free land during construction of premises.
132 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - Up to 100 percent foreign ownership of enterprises in EPZs, sale of up to 25 percent of production permitted in domestic market.
- No quotas on products from Nigeria exported to the European Union, (EU) and the United States of America.
- Made in Nigeria goods are entitled to preferential tariffs in the EU.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Name five incentives of EPZ to international business.
3.5.1 Grants Available For Exporter The provision of the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act with respect to Pioneer Status qualifies for a tax holiday of 3-5 years to any manufacturing exporter who exports at least 50% of his annual production.
Additional concessions are also available in the local raw material development, local value-added, labour-intensive or export- oriented activities that involve significant training.
Tax Relief on Interest Income Interests accruing from loans granted by banks in aid of export activities enjoy favourable tax treatment.
Capital Assets Depreciation Allowance The law in Nigeria provides an additional annual depreciation allowance of 5 percent on plants and machinery to manufacturing exporters who export at least 50 percent of their annual turnover provided that the product has at least 40 percent local raw material content or 35 percent value added.
Investment Protection Protection of property is provided by Section 31 of 1999 Constitution.
The section states: (cid:8220)No property or other rights will be taken over or compulsorily acquired except under a law which provides for adequate compensation and for a right of access for any claimant to the High Court of the relevant part of Nigeria for the determination of interest in the property and compensation amount.
(cid:8221) 133 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Expropriation The Nigeria Investment Protection Commission Decree guarantees against nationalisation, expropriation and compulsory purchase.
Disputes Settlement Disputes between an investor and any government of the Nigerian federation in this regard which cannot be amicably settled, may be submitted by an aggrieved party to arbitration in accordance with Nigeria(cid:8217)s Arbitration and Conciliation Decree 1988 or within the framework of any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment protection to which the Federal government and the investor(cid:8217)s country are parties or in accordance with any other national or international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes as agreed to by the parties.
Nigeria(cid:8217)s legal entity with basis on English common law, further upholds the sanctity of contracts and the rule of law.
The scheme operates in a fashion that cuts off the bureaucratic delay that is synonymous with government agencies by allowing the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) to administer, manage, control and coordinate the quick approvals for participating foreign investors while its supporting agencies handle almost all phrases of operations in the zone independent of government.
These include issuing application forms and approval, company registration and construction licensing among others.
To facilitate the operation of the Calabar EPZ, the Calabar seaport has been declared as a free port to complement the status of the free trade zone.
Among the numerous facilities sited at the 152 hectare Calabar EPZ site, is a new port less than two kilometers away with fully buoyed river channel and an estimated capacity of about 1.5 metric tons of cargo excluding crude oil.
Many investors are already eager to set base in Calabar and the government has assured of the existence of several pre- built standard factories.
At the moment, only three companies are operating in the Calabar Zone, so there is plenty of room for new companies.
It has been promised that the entire necessary infrastructure will be in place (cid:8211) plots, roads, street lighting, perimeter fencing, electricity and water facilities.
With a vast population that is rich in human potentials and abundant mineral resources, the success of the EPZs is almost certain from day one, though the elimination of the (cid:8220)Nigerian factor(cid:8221) must be a priority concern for the eventual growth of the scheme.
Also, the establishment of other zones around the country is being considered in order for wider coverage and developmental impact.
Kano and Lagos are veritable 134 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS locations for such a project with the former catering for the Trans- Sahara trade and latter focusing on export of manufacturing products.
The prioritization of quality should not be sacrificed on the altar of quantity and strict monitoring regulations must be formulated to guide participating firms.
3.5.2 The Nigerian Export Processing Zones Scheme The enabling law for the establishment and management of the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) scheme in Nigeria is the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority Decree No.
63 of 1992.
By this decree, administration of the Nigerian EPZ programme is vested in the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA).
NEPZA is thus, empowered to grant all requisite permits and approvals for operators in EPZs to the exclusion of all other government agencies and bodies.
The regulatory regime for EPZs in Nigeria is liberal and provided an environment that is conducive for profitable operations.
The incentives available to operators in Nigeria(cid:8217)s EPZs compare favourably with the most attractive elsewhere in the world and are the best in the region.
They include one hundred percent foreign ownership of investments, (cid:8220)one stop(cid:8221) approvals, no import or export licenses, duty free import of raw materials, unrestricted remittance of capital profits and dividends, tax holidays and no strikes.
The country(cid:8217)s pioneer EPZ is the Calabar Processing Zone.
Calabar Export Processing Zone The Calabar EPZ provides investors with one of the most suitable sites for export manufacture in Africa.
The zone provides serviced industrial and administrative facilities at the most competitive rates obtainable for facilities of such standards in Africa.
In addition to public supplies of such utilities as power, water and telecommunications, the zone has its own private back-up supply of these essential utilities and services.
Calabar, the city in which the EPZ is sited, is an ancient and historic city with an enviable past, having served as the capital of the Southern Protectorate of Nigeria before the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914.
The serene and beautiful city served as the centre of operations for the Royal Niger Company during the days of the oil palm trade as well as being an age (cid:8211) long centre of learning.
It is at present the capital of Cross River State in South(cid:8211)East Nigeria and is fondly referred to as the (cid:8220)Canaan City(cid:8221), the Biblical land flowing with milk and honey.
(cid:8217) Although one is not likely to actually find milk and honey flowing on 135 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS the streets of this clean, enchanting and alluring city, one will definitely discover the warmth and hospitality of the people of Calabar in abundance.
There are other attributes, which make the choice of Calabar as the site of Nigeria(cid:8217)s pioneer EPZ an excellent one.
The city has good road links with other parts of the country and is traversed by the Trans (cid:8211) African Highway.
It is a major gateway to the Republic of Cameroon and other countries of Central Africa.
Its modern seaport adjoining the EPZ is of special advantage and will result in significant savings for shipping and haulage services to investors in the Zone.
The city(cid:8217)s international airport is less than 20 minutes drive from the site of the Calabar EPZ.
Several airlines provide Calabar with international and local air travel services.
Arik Airlines is the major operator from Calabar Airport.
It operates daily domestic flights to and from Lagos and Port-Harcourt, with connecting international flights to other destinations in Africa.
The airline also operates flights to Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Calabar and its environs have a pool of skilled and trainable manpower with significant industrial experience.
Such manpower is available at very competitive rates, which rank among the lowest in the world.
There are several institutions of higher learning in Calabar and its environs which provide university, technical and vocational education.
If the need arises, these institutions can provide any special training needs and support services that producers in the Zone may need.
Industrial activity in Calabar is largely in natural resource- based industries such as oil palm, wood, limestone, rubber, cocoa and coffee.
However, activities in the oil and gas industry, especially the aluminum smelting plant at Onne, near Ikot Abasi and the activities of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, at Eket, offer prospects for linkages between manufactures in the Calabar EPZ and these industries.
Moreover, the disposition of its people, its rich history, culture and several natural attractions make Calabar an ideal tourist location.
Attractions in Calabar and within its surrounding include the Abokim Water Falls, Qua Falls, and the Gorilla Sanctuary in the Kanyang National park.
136 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Facilities within the Zone Facilities available in the Calabar EPZ are as follows.
(a) Service plots; (b) Uninterrupted power and water supply; (c) Modern and efficient telecommunications system (d) Excellent internal road network; (e) Built-up factory space (f) Modern catering and recreational facilities; (f) Banking services; and (g) Custom service.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Discuss five services available to international businessmen in EPZ Central Bank of Nigeria Central Bank simply refers to a central monetary authority or an apex financial institution within the entire financial structure of a country promoting its monetary stability and a sound financial system.
The Central Bank is one of a variety of structures, functions and powers, which are the by-product of the economic, political and other realities prevailing in a society.
Historically, prior to the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria by the CBN Act of 1958, there existed a body known as the West African Currency Board (WACB).
This Board, which was established by the then British Colonial Government, was intended to serve as a Central Bank for the Anglophone West African countries.
Thus, the Board was charged with the primary responsibility of issuing the West African pound, which served as the legal tender currency in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra-Leone and Gambia.
Another function performed by WACB was the management of the reserves held in trust for these colonies.
Such reserves were invested by the Board on behalf of the West African countries as instruments in the 139 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS London Money Market.
The weaknesses of the Board for which it was criticised were as follows.
• It carried on commercial banking activities alongside other commercial banks; • The Board lacked the basic apparatus to control the supply of money; • The Board got involved in physical distribution of currency from one point to another; • Its activities were considered discriminatory against indigenous West African industrialists; • It was not on the development of the colonies and most of its activities were based on commerce and trade.
3.5.3 Objectives The principal objectives of the Bank as stipulated in the CBN Act 1958 are as follows.
a.
The insurance of legal tender currency in Nigeria.
b.
To maintain the external reserve and value of the legal tender in order to safeguard the international value of the currency.
c. To promote monetary stability and a sound financial system.
d. It serves as the banker and financial adviser of the Federal Government.
e. It is the banker to other banks within Nigeria and abroad.
3.5.4 Functions To achieve the above objectives, CBN undertakes the following functions as stated in the Act.
The basic functions performed by CBN can be broadly categorised into three.
a.
Traditional functions b.
Regulatory functions and c. Development functions.
140 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Traditional Functions i.
It issues the legal tender (currencies) naira and kobo.
ii.
It acts as the banker and financial adviser to the Federal Government.
iii.
CBN acts as the banker to other banks and finance institution.
• Cheque clearing.
• Lender of last resort.
iv.
It manages the accounts and debts of the country.
v. CBN manages the banking supervision and examination.
Regulatory Functions The regulatory functions of the CBN are mainly directed at the objective of promoting and maintaining the monetary and price stability in the economy.
To perform this regulatory function, CBN formulates policies to control the amount of money in circulation, control other banks and major players in the financial market, control rates of banks credits and therefore the supply of money in the economy.
The instruments used by CBN to achieve these functions are the followings.
a.
Open Market Operation (OMO) b.
Bank Rate c. Rediscount Rate d. Direct Control of Bank(cid:8217)s Liquidity e. Direct Control of Bank Credit f. Special Deposits g. Moral Persuasion h. Minimum Cash Ratio.
Developmental Functions 141 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS The establishment of CBN in 1959 was premised on the need to promote and accelerate the much needed economic growth and development in Nigeria, which would invariably promote the growth of the financial market.
This financial market comprises the Money and Capital Markets, assistance to development banks and institutions and the formulation and execution of government economic policies.
The Money Market is the market for mobilising short-term funds with instruments such as Treasury Bills, Treasury Certificates, Commercial Papers, Certificate of Deposit (CDs), Eligible Development Stock (EDS) and Bankers(cid:8217) Acceptances.
The CBN plays a major role in the Capital Market, which deals with long-term funds by fostering its growth through the annual subvention granted to them.
The CBN also helps to promote and assist the development banks and institutions.
These include Bank of Industry (BOI), formerly Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), the Nigerian Banks for Commerce and Industry (NBCI), the Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC), the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), the Nigerian Export- Import Bank (NEXIN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In addition, the CBN is involved in the formulation and execution of viable economic policies and measures for the government.
Also since 1970, the Bank has been instrumental in the promotion of wholly owned Nigerian enterprises.
Thus, the recent directive to banks to set aside 10 percent of their profits before tax to finance Small and Medium Scale Enterprises can be viewed in this context.
3.5.5 Problems The CBN is faced with a number of problems in the Nigerian financial sector, among which are the followings.
a.
Its inability to guide against unethical actions of commercial banks in the areas of money laundering, interbank forex exchange.
b.
Inability to curb the current rising inflation rates in the country.
c. Lack of effective regulatory measures has led to high lending rates imposed by commercial banks on their customers.
142 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS d. Lack of the capacity to effectively execute government economic policies.
e. Failure to promote and encourage Nigerians to invest in Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises by not giving enough incentives.
f. Its inability to monitor the skyrocketing foreign exchange rates in the country.
g. Inability to promote the needed saving culture among Nigerians, which could have helped the nation(cid:8217)s capital base.
h. Finally, the CBN has been unable to tap into the information technology super highway of e- banking and e-commerce, which is a major prerequisite for the country to partake in the globalization activities.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 i.
Discuss the contributions of CBN to international business in Nigeria.
3.5.6 Achievements, Vision and Mission The Central Bank of Nigeria, in its bid to curb banks(cid:8217) unethical actions, has periodically increased its capital base and have instituted the inter- bank foreign exchange market to check capital flight and to regulate foreign exchange rates.
CBN has also achieved a level of autonomy since the advent of the democratic dispensation in Nigeria.
This is reflected in her aggressive execution of government economic policies in the areas of orientating the Nigerian populace to embrace the saving culture, the encouragement of foreign investors by creating an enabling environment/policies for ensuring macroeconomic stability and stable governance.
We must also acknowledge the recent moves by the Central Bank to tap into the limitless opportunity derivable in the information technology world.
This is reflected in the massive promotion of universal banking in the country.
The CBN took the bull by the horns by first starting a restructuring and reengineering project which is perceived to tackle the business processes in its structural and instructional deficiencies to enhance its effectiveness, efficiency and productivity.
The Central Bank of Nigeria(cid:8217)s restructuring and reengineering involves improved reorganisation of the bank(cid:8217)s business processes with a view to making it more efficient and proactive.
It also involves restructuring the 143 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS assets and liabilities of the bank to promote efficiency, restore integrity and achieve cost effectiveness.
To achieve this all important restricting and reengineering, CBN embarked on a project code named (cid:8220)Project EAGLES(cid:8221).
Project EAGLES is the approach CBN has adopted, recognising the need to gear up its organisation and systems to address strategic issues, achieve a sharper focus on core functions and be an efficient regulator in the 21st Century.
Consequently, the vision of the CBN in the third millennium is: (cid:8220)To be one of the most efficient and effective among the world(cid:8217)s central banks in promoting and sustaining economic development(cid:8221).
Arising from the vision is the restructuring/reengineering code named EAGLES which stands for the following: E = Efficiency A = Accountability G = Goal oriented L= Leadership E = Effectiveness S = Staff oriented The mission of Central Bank of Nigeria arising from the vision has been captured as follows.
To be proactive in providing a stable frame-work for the economic development of Nigeria through transparent implementation of monetary policy and achieving efficient and effective price stability for a sound management of the financial system.
The restructuring/reengineering framework adopted for Project EAGLES is the Performance Driven Change mythology (PDC).
This method defines and reviews the performance measurement set for each business processes to be sure that process performance is appropriately measured.
144 MBE722 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS According to Chief Joseph Sanusi the former Governor of CBN, the project, which kicked off two years ago, has completed its first phase.
The governing board of CBN is satisfied so far.
The second phase has also been launched.
This project was embarked upon due to the need to change the entire structure of the CBN with a focus towards imbibing a strong culture using modern information technology (IT) as a springboard.
The reengineering exercise according to the former Governor is intended to radically alter the way things are done at present, that is, work ethics and relationship both within and outside the bank, which means, making significant technological changes that will pervade the whole CBN.
4.0 CONCLUSION The organisations studied no doubt have been able to encourage foreign business between Nigeria and other countries.
