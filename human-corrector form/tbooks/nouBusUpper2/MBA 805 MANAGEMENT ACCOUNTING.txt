2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Identify accounting as an information system • Define the concept management accounting • Identifying the informational needs of managers • Identify the qualities of information required by managers • Differentiate between management accounting and financial accounting.
3.1 Accounting as an information system The accounting system is the major information system in any organisation.
The information provided by accounting is for three major purposes namely • Internal reporting to enable managers plan and control their routine operations Internal reporting to managers for use in making non-routine decisions and formulating major plans and policies • External reporting to shareholders, government, creditors and other interested parties Students Assessment Exercise (a) What is the major information system in an organisation?
(b) List two purposes for which accounting information is provided for  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Solution • (a) Accounting System • .
For internal reporting to enable managers to plan and control their routine operations • For internal reporting to managers for use in making non-routine decisions and formulating major plans and policies 3.2 Definition of Management Accounting Management accounting is "the application of professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of accounting information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in planning and controlling of the operations of the undertaking' (Chartered Institute of Management Accounting CIMA) Students Assessment Exercise What is the essence of providing management accounting information?
Solution The essence is for the application of professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of accounting information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in planning and controlling of the operations of an organisation.
3.3 Types of information needed by managers • Information that would enable the manger to judge whether he is doing well or not • Information, which would enable the manager to know the problem areas to look into.
• Information, which would enable the manager to choose the best among several alternatives.
Students Assessment Exercise List three areas for which managers need information Solution • To judge whether he is doing well or not.
• To locate problem areas to look into • To choose the best course of action among several alternatives 3.4 Qualities of information provided by Management Accounting report • Factual —An ideal management accounting report must be capable of being independently proved by the users i.e.
must contain both quantitative and qualitative data.
• Degree of details —A good management accounting report must be conclusive in presentation i.e.
it must be adequate for the purpose of taking a particular decision.
• Cost Benefit Analysis — The cost of generating the management accounting report must not be higher than the benefits to be derived from the report.
• Timeliness — for management accounting reports to be considered a relevant in a particular situation, it must be presented on time i.e.
prior to the decision.
A stale information will not serve the appropriate objective of the organisation • Method of presentation — An ideal management accounting report must highlight the key aspect of the report in such a way that it will be assessable to the users.
This may be done through appropriate headings or paragraph method.
• Ambiguity —An ideal management accounting report must not include words that are capable of different interpretations and meanings because of its implications to the user i.e.
technical jargons should be avoided.
• Volume of content — A good management accounting report must be explicit yet not  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise You are required to list the qualities that a good management accounting report must possess.
Solution • Factual — it must be capable ofbeing independently proved by users i.e.
should contain both quantitative and qualitative data.
• Degree of details — it must contain enough information and be conclusive in nature for the purpose of taking a particular decision.
• Cost benefit analysis — the cost of generating the report must not be higher than the benefit to be derived from the report.
• Timeliness —for a report to be considered relevant in a particular situation, it must be presented on time.
• Method ofpresentation— The report must highlight the key aspect ofthe report using appropriate headings or paragraph method in such a way that it will be assessable to the users.
• Ambiguity —An ideal report must avoid the use of ambiguous words or technical jargons.
• Volume of content — A good report must be self explanatory and yet not voluminous.
3.5 Differences between management accounting and financial accounting 3.5.1 Users:- Management is the main user ofmanagement accounting report.
The users of financial accounting reports include insiders and outsiders.
These various users can be categorized broadly as follows: • Equity — investor group • Loan — creditor group • Employee group • Business contact group • Research/analysts group government group • Government Group • Public group.
3.5.2 Rules and regulations —Financial accounting reports are influenced by the following • Accounting conventions e.g.
prudence, going concern, matching, accrual conventions etc.
• Professional pronouncements e.g.
statements of standard accounting practice (SSAP), Internal accounting standards (IAS), financial Accounting standards (FAS) etc.
• Statutory pronouncements from The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA); Banking and Other Financial Institutional Act (BOFIA), Productivity, Prices and Income Board (PPD3) etc.
All these factors do significantly affect the preparation of tnanagement accounting reports.
3.5.3 Degree of details — Financial accounting reports relate most of the time to the whole organisation whereas management accounting reports predominantly relate to the specific sections ofoperation ofthe organisation, and therefore much more detailed than would oniinarily be provided by financial accoun3ti ng report.
MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.5.5 Time focus r financial accounting reports are historical in nature while management accounting reports are predominantly futuristic and predictive in nature.
3.5.6 Use of estimates and approximations in view of the fact that financial accounting — reports are historical and the periodicity ofthe reports is static, the use of estimates and approximations are reduced to the barest minimum.
However, due to the emphasis of management accounting reports on the future, which are unknown, estimates and approximations are extensively made use of 3.5.7 Objectives The main reason for keeping financial records is to comply with legal requirements — and for the purpose of accountability or stewardship.
On the other hand, management accounts are kept for planning and controls purposes.
Students Assessment Exercise Itemise the points of distinctions between management accounting and financial accounting.
Solution • Usas ofinformation • Rules and regulations •• •Degree of details • Period ofpreparing reports • Tune focus • Use of estimates and approximates • Objectives.
4.0 Conclusion Management accounting has been demonstrated to be an indispensable tool to the management of an organisation in achieving its planning, controlling and decision making functions.
5.0 Summary In this unit, attempts have been made to identify accounting as part ofthe information system in organizations, and to define the concept ofmanagement accounting.
Also, we attempted to identify the informational needs-ofmanagers, to identify the qualities of such information and to differentiate between management accounting and financial accounting.

This unit is a continuation to unit one — introduction to management accotmting.
We shall be looldng at the manageraent process, planning, decisiongnaking, control and the role of 'wassail= accountant in the management process.
2.0 Objectives Attie aid ofthis unit, you should be able to •••• Idea* the management process man organisation •••• Understand decision making process ma business Organisation •••• Identifythe roles oftnanagment accountant in the management process.
•••• Identify types ofplanning in an organisation 3.1 The Management Process .
The management process may be subdivided into three components •••• Planning-strategic planning, tactical planning and operational planning •••• Decision-making •••• • Control 3.1.1 Planning— This is the process of setting objectives for the future and the means of attaining them.
I want you to imagine that you have a plan of earning a degree.
Of course, there are many means of earning a degree, one of which is through distance learning.
Your objective here is to earn a degree, and the means of attaining tha is through the distance learning *on.
The means of attaining corporate plans are called the corporate strategy Planning is divided into three phases namely:  MBA 719: • MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.1.1.1 Strategic Planning: Examples of strategic plans include: • Entering into a new market • Introduction of new product lines • Acquisition of another company or a merger • Entering the export market.
You would realize that these examples are long-term developmental planifor the organization, which can be likened to your plan of earning a degree.
The plan cannot be achieved immediately, benefits to be derived from the actualization ofthese plans are more enduring and therefore they require strategic planning or planning for the distant future.
e 3.1.1.2 Tactical planning: This is concerned with medium term plans such as: • Whether to make or buy • .
Whether or not to drop a product line • Whether to buy or lease an equipment • Whether to sell at present state or process further a by-product.
Can you think of a medium tam plan to your desire to earn a degree?
Something like planning for your industrial attachment during the course ofyour study would be more like it.
3.1.1.3 Operational Planning: This is concerned with short-term plans such as • Choosing credit customers • Deciding on daily delivery routes Think out the plans that would be operational to the attainment ofyoUr educational ambition.
Mode of receiving lectures would be more like it.
3.1.2 Decision making Decision-making involves choositig from among alternative courses of action 7, the best which seems to be the most effective and the most efficient.
What are the alternative courses of action to your decision to earn a degree — make a fist of these.
Do you think you have chosen the best among these alternatives?
Whatever option you have chosen is a decision and you should be ready for the consequences of your decisions.
3.1.1.1 The Characteristics of decision making are: • Decision making deals with the future • Decision making situation arises only when there are alternatives to be chosen from • Each decision covers a time period.
The time period may be called short range, Wit is less than a year, medium range, Wit is between 23 years and long range ifthe duration extends - beyond three years.
3.1.1.2 Phases of decision making: • Statement of objectives • Determination of objectives • Evaluation ofalternatives • Selection ofthe best alternatives • Implementation 6 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING The above are also phases of planning.
Develop phases to your decision to earn a degree.
Can your selected decision be implemented?
3.1.2 Control: This is the comparison of actual results achieved with plans, and the extent and reasons for deviations from the plans Do you control your plans?
How?
3.2 The role of the management accountant in the management process.
The management accountant is concerned with the collection organisation and presentation of information required for management processes.
3.2.1 The interrelationship between management activities and management accounting is shown below: Managerial activity Accounting activity * Planning for the future , - Preparation ofbudgets - Setting up of standards * Decision making - Providing data on alternatives - Advising on consequences of possible actions * Control - Comparing actual results with standards and budget - Interpretation and identification of problem areas.
Do you collect, organize and present your information in a manner that would assist you to take the right decision?
If you do, list the activities you perform for your company as a managerin terms of planning, decision-making and control.
4.0 Conclusion Management process has been demonstrated to include planning, decision- making, and controlling, all of which are very important managerial activities in an organisation.
Decision making in an organisation has been demonstrated to be a pivotal factor in the achievement of corporate goal achievement.
Also, the important role that management accountants play in the management process was equally discussed.
5.0 Summary In this unit, attempts have been made to identify management process in an organization to explain the role of decision-making process in business organizations, to identify the roles of management accountants in the management process, and to identify the types of planning in an organization.

It will cover a period ofone hour This unit is a continuation to unit —2- introduction to management accounting.
We shall be looking at the definition of information, categories of information, sources of information to management, information processing systems and the role of computer in the information system.
2.0 Objectives At the end ofthis unit, you should be able to: • Define information • Categorize information • Identify the sources of information to management • Identify decision support systems • Identify information processing systems • Identify the role of computer in the information system 3.1 Definition of Information Information is the generic term that includes all the facts, figures, ideas, observations, impressions, experience, insights and relationships that enhance our understanding of a decision- making situation.
From your quest to earn a degree from the distance-learning program, what are the information that you would seek?
List them and appraise how each ofthem would enhance the attainment ofyour objective.
3.2 Categories of Information Basically, there are two broad categories of information: • Quantitative Information— These are information that can be measured in quantitative terms such as time, units, cost data, sales revenue, labour hours etc.
• Qualitative Information — These are those intangible factors, which do not lend themselves to numeric expressions such as human factors, managerial insight, socio-political repercussions, and -changes in attitude.
9  MBA 805: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Can you imagine a factory environment where a decision is to be taken on whether to buy a certain component named "XIn for N400 per unit from a supplier or to continue to manufacture the same component "XI" internally at a marginal cost of production ofN500 per unit.
Well, on the surface, the reasonable option would appear to be that ofbuying 'XY' from the supplier and thus saving N100 per unit purchased.
However, the consequence of this decision would be the retrenchment ofcertain categories of workers and its attendant labour unrest.
Identify quantitative and qualitative information from the above two paragraphs.
1 3.3 The Role of Information in an Organization: The role of information is to predict fixture circumstances.
The more accurate the prediction, the lesser the degree of risk.
However, not all information is useful for decision- making.
In order to be useful, information should be timely and relevant.
Information can be relevant Wits availability or non- availability can influence the choice ofan alternative.
Historical information are not relevant to decision making.
Relevant information are futuristic, since decision making is concerned with the fixture.
Management accounting is mainly concerned with qualitative information, is just as important, and on some occasions, may even be more important.
Whenever possible, qualitative factors should also be presented as part of the information system.
Students Assessment Exercise Discuss the role of information in an organisation.
3.4 Sources of Information to Management The sources of information to management might be from within the organisation (in which case it is known as feedback) or it might be environmental information.
Feedback represents a part of the control cycle whereby actual iesults ofoperations are measured, compared against planned results so that any corrective action can be determined, and reported to management.
Environmental information originates from outside the business and tends to be used more extensively by senior management.
Students Assessment Exercise List extensively the internal and external sources of information about the distance learning education system.
3.5 Decision Support System A decision support system is a system which operates so as to provide help i.e.
support in making decisions.
Any management information system could be described as a decision support system in that it provides information for managers in an organised and understandable way to enable them to make a more timely decision.
Within a management information system, decision support sub-systems can be identified.
For example, routine management reports might be provided regularly to indicate what control decisions are necessary.
Decision models may also be developed to facilitate management decisions.
For example, budget planning decisions might be aided by a linear programming model or cost-volume-profit model, and stock ordering decisions by an economic order quantity (EDO) model.
The more developed and sophisticated decision support systans become, the better the quality of management decisions is likely to be, because better and more relevant information on which to base decisions should be available.
10  MBA 805.
MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise (a) Define a decision support system (b) As a manager, identify two decision support sub-systems in your work place.
3.6 Information Processing systems Information may be wholly processed by human beings or by machines Human information processing is the processing of information by human beings as distinct from automated processing by machines.
In a small business, the entire information ofbusiness systems may exist without the aid ofbusiness machines or computers.
It might consist ofcopying, totalling, summarizing sorting classifying and other similar operations.
In what type ofbusiness organisation are you working and how is the business information processed?
3.7 The Role of Computer in the Information System An effective information system must be devised first, before it is computerized.
The use of the computer does not in itself guarantee a more efficient management inforination system because garbage in would produce garbage out (G I. G O.).
The success of a management information system depends primarily not on the relative efficiency with which information is processed, but on whether the system provides the information needed by decision makers.
4.0 Conclusion The importance &information to managers in taking decisions has been emphasized.
A decision is as good as the quality outs decision support system.
Also, the important role played by computer in information processing was also discussed.
5.0 Summary In this unit, attempts have been made to define information, to categorize information, to identify the role of information in management, to identify the importance ofdecision support systems, to identify information-processing systems, and to discuss the role of computers in the information system.

During the course of this lecture, we shall look at the determination of cost behaviour which will cover definition of cost, concept of cost behaviour level of activity reasons for studying cost behaviour, concept ofrelevant range, basic principle of cost behaviour and the types of cost behaviour.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Define cost • Describe the concept of cost behaviour • Identify the reasons for studying cost behaviour • Describe the concept of relevant range • Identify the types of cost behaviour and describe a level of activity 3.1 Definition of Cost The scope of the term 'cost' is extremely broad and general.
It is, therefore, not easy to define or explain this term without leaving any doubt concerning its meaning.
Cost accountants, Economists and others develop this concept of cost according to their needs.
This concept should therefore be studied in relation to its purpose and use.
Some of the definitions of cost are given hereunder: • "A cost is the value of economic resources used as a result of producing a product or service" (WM.
Harper) • Cost is "the amount of expenditure (actual or notional) incurred on or attributable to a given thing" (ICMA) • cost is "an exchange price, a foregoing, a sacrifice made to secure benefit" (A tentative set of Broad Accounting Principles for Business Enterprises) 12 MBA 805: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise Attempt your own definition of cost, and give an instance wheriit can be so used.
3.2 Concept of Cost Behaviour Cost behaviour is the study ofthe ways in which cost react or do not react to chimges in the level ofactivity ofan organisation.
Knowledge of cost behaviour is the basis ofall cost-volume-profit (C. V.P) analyses.
When we know the behaviour of costs, then financial planning is made simpler.
Students Assessment Exercise Identify some activities in your work place and state the reaction of cost to slight changes in the level of operation of this activity e.g.
rent ... cost item, number of patients treated... activity If the number of patients treated fluctuates in a period, would the rent paid on the patients' ward fluctuate accordingly?
3.3 Level of activity The level of activity is the amount ofwork done or the number of events that has Occurred.
The type ofactivity which influences cost varies according to the nature ofwork done in the organisation or department, and the nature of the items of cost whose behaviour is being analysed depending on the circumstance, the level of activity may refer to the volume of production in a period, the number of items sold, the value of items sold, the number ofinvoicts issued, the number ofinvoices received, the number &units of electricity consumed, etc.
Students Assessment Exercise Identify what should be the level of activity in the following: Barbers shop Restaurant Mechanic workshop Lawyers Office Airline ticketing office Secondary school Hospital Railway station Petrol station 3.4 Reasons for studying cost behaviour There are three principal reasons for studying how costs respond to changes in the level of activities: • For the prediction of cost to facilitate budgetary and corporate planning • For performance evaluation when a system of flexible budgetary control is in operation • For the estimation of costs for various decision making processes e.g.
pricing decisions, make or buy decision, optimal product mix, shut-down decisions etc.
Students Assessment Exercise Can you identify other reasons why cost behaviour should be studied?
3.5 Concept of Relevant Range: This is the range in which all assumptions about the level of activities and cost will remain valid.
Within this range, most items of cost will settle into a basic pattern or behaviour and cost can be classified into either fixed or variable cost.
13  MBA 805 MANAGEMEN7' AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise Have you ever heard of installed capacity before this time?
Ifyou have, then think about a car that has the capacity to carry just five persons or a machine that can work continuously for just twelve hours., if you want the car to carry more than five persons, then you have to procure another car to extend your relevant range, or if you want the machine to work continuously for twenty-four hours, you may have to procure the second machine because that machine has just twelve hours as its Stalled capacity.
3.6 Basic Principles of Cost Behaviour The basic principle of cost behaviour is that, as the level of activity rises, costs will usually rise.
It will cost more to produce 2,000 units of an output than it will cost to produce 1,000 units of the same product.
This principle is common sense.
I agree with you.
The problem for the accountant, however, is to determine for each item of cost, as the level of activity increases: • The ways in which the costs behave to changes in activity level; (i.e.
are costs • Fixed, varied, stepped or mixed • By how much (i.e.
what is the amount of fixed cost per period and what is the variable cost per unit of activity?)
For the purpose ofthis course, the level of activity for measuring cost will generally be taken to be the volume of production.
Students Assessment Exercise State the accountants' interest in the study of the principle of cost behaviour.
3.7 Types of Cost Behaviour: 4 3.7.1 Fixed Costs: Fixed costs are those costs, which do nofvary with output or production level.
They accrue with the passage of time hence they are time or period cost.
They remain constant in amount for a given short term period and within relevant range of output.
Fixed costs are costs of holding assets • and other factors of production in readiness for production.
A company when defining fixed cost should take the following factors into consideration: • Controllability —All fixed costs are controllable in the long run.
Some fixed costs are subject to management control in the short-run.
Numerous fixed costs are determined annually by discretional management policies.
• Relevant range —Fixed cost must be related to a range of activity.
Afixed cost would only remain constant only when level of operation is within relevant range.
• Period cost —Because they accrue with the passage of time, the amount of the fixed costs must be related at specified period of time.
Fixed costs should be related to a financial year and expressed as a constant amount per month.
• Fixed in total but variable per units —A fixed cost is constant in total amount per period, but variable in terms of unit cost.
14  MBA 805 MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING A sketch graph of a fixed cost would look like: Cost Fixed cost 0 (x) Level of activity Examples of fixed costs.
are: • The salary per month of a supervisor • The rent of a single factory building per month or per annum 3.7.2 Step Cost This is a variant of the fixed cost.
Many items of cost are fixed in nature but within certain levels of activity i.e.
a relevant range.
For example, the annual depreciation cost of a machine may be fixed if production remains below 1,000 units for machine that has a maximum capacity of 1,000 units, but if production is to exceed 1,000 unit, even by 1 unit, then a second machine would be required, and the annual depreciation cost on two machines would go up in a stepped manner.
15  MBA 805 MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING A sketch graph of a step cost would look like: Cost (N) 0 Vo ume of output Level of activity Other examples of step cost area: • Rent — where accommodation requirements increase, as output levels get higher.
• Basic wages — basic pay of employees is nowadays usually fixed, but as output rises, more employees are required.
3.7.3 Variable Costs A variable cost is one, which tends to vary viiith the volume of output.
The variable cost per unit is the same amount for each unit produced, which means that the amount of resources used and the price of these resources are constant for each additional unit produced.
The total cost of a variable cost item would be shown graphically as follows: Cost (N) 0 Volume of output 16  MBA 805 MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.7.4 Total Cost This is the totality of costs: i.e.
the addition oftotal variable cost plus total fixed cost, and its function is given as: a+b(x) Where, y .= total cost a = fixed cost variable cost per unit = activity level It is shown graphically as: Cost (N) Fixed cost Level of output 3.7.5 Mixed Costs Also referred to as semi-variable or semi-fixed cost.
They are cost items which are partly fixed and partly variable i.e.
costs which contain a standing basic charge plus a variable charge per unit of consumption e.g.
telephone bills, electricity bill, etc.
Students Assessment Exercise Identify and sketch the graph of any other cost behaviours?
4.0 Conclusion Cost behaviour has been demonstrated to be a veritable tool in understanding the effect of cost in response to changes in the volume of activity and to understanding the resulting impact of cost on profitability.
5.0 Summary In this unit attempts have been made to define cost, to describe the concept of cost behaviour, to identify the reasons for studying cost behaviour, to describe the concept of relevant range, to describe a level of activity and to identify the types of cost behaviour 6.0 References and other further readings: • Arora, MN.

We shall be taking a look at the need for cost estimation and the various methods of cost estimation 2.0 Objectives At the end ofthis unit, you should be able to: • Establish the need for cost estimation • Describe the various cost estimation techniques.
3.1 Need for Cost Estimation You would recall from unit 4 of the course that we said there exists a mixed cost or semi- variable cost or semi-fixed cost.
These are said to be costs which are partly fixed and partly variable i.e.
a cost which is a composite of a standing basic charge plus a variable change per unit of consumption.
If all costs are to be classified as either a fixed cost or a variable cost, then a mixed cost has to be so separated into its variable and fixed costs components.
Imagine the telephone bill received from NITEL Even in situations where the telephone is still out of service, you still receive a bill for the month.
You would wonder where the charges came from.
Well, it is the standing charge for having a line, which would carry a fixed charge.
And in addition to this, you pay a constant variable charge per usage.
The two changes would have been added together and sent to you as a bulk, which you may have to separate for planning purposes and budgeting.
3.2 Cost Estimation Techniques 3.2.1 Scatter graph method Under this method, the coordinates ofthe cost and the associated level of activity in respect of historical records for a defined period of time are plotted on a graph.
Aline of best fit is then drawn usually across the coordinates crossing the cost axis.
This technique fits a tredd line to a series of historical data points and then projects the line into the figure for medium to long-term forecasts.
Developing a linear trend line by a precise statistical method would require the use of the least square Method.
This method results in a straight line that minimizes the sum ofthe squares of the vertical differences from the line ofbest ;fit.
19  MBA 805 MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING A least square line is described in terms of its y-intercept (i.e.
the height at which it intercepts - the y-axis); and its slope (i.e.
the steepiness or angle of the line).
If the y-intercept and its slope can be computed, then the line can be expressed with the following equation.
y = a +b(x) where: y = computed value of the variable to be predicated (This is referred to as the dependent variable) a =y — axis intercept = slope of the regression line or the rate of change in y .i.e ity dx values of a and b for nay regression line can be determined.
The slope b is determined by: Awy — ncy fix' — nx2 where: slope ofthe regression line A = summation sign values ofthe independent variable • values ofthe dependent variable the average of the values ofthe x's • the average of the values of the y's - the number of observations The y-axis intercept i.e.
'a' is computed as: a = y — bx S tudents Assessment Exercise (Unit 5.11 Year Units of power generator sold 1992 74 1993 79 1994 80 1995 90 1996 105 1997 142 1998 122 You are required to draw a straight line trend (i.e.

The differences between the total cost ofthe high output and the total cost ofthe low output will be the variable cost ofthe different output levels.

7.0 Tutor marked assignment and marking scheme Unit 5.3 I J K Nigeria Limited has computed its total factor overhead cost at the high and low levels of activity to be as follows: Level ofActivity Low Hit Direct labour hours 50,000 75,000 Total factory overhead costs 142,000 176,250 Assume that the factory overhead costs above consist of indirect materials, rent and maintenance expenses.
The company has analyzed these costs at the 50,000 direct labour hours of activity, and has determined that at that level, these costs exist in the following proportions: Indirect materials (variable) 50,000 Rent ( f i x e d ) ) 60,000 Maintenance (semi-variable) 32.000 142.000 For planning purposes, the company wants to break the maintenance cost down into its variable and fixed elements.
You are required to determine: (a) How much of the N176, 250 factory overhead costs at the high level of activity above consists of maintenance cost (b) The cost formula for maintenance by means of the high-low method of cost analysis.
Discussion, solution and marking scheme • The analysis of co st given in the body of cost is for the low level of activity at 50,000 hours.
• Indirect materials is said to be a variable cost and records N50, 000.
This means that it should be possible to establish the variable cost per hour, and this would be N50, 000 =N1 per hour.
50,000 23  MBA 805 MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING • Rent is fixed at the low level at N60, 000.
Since rent is a fixed cost, it is expected that it would remain constant even at a higher level of activity • The total cost recorded at the high level is N176, 250.
Out of this, N75, 000 is accounted for by indirect materials, which in variable N60, 000 is accounted for by rent which is fixed, therefore, the balance ofN41, 250 will be for maintenance.
• Maintenance cost at the high level of operation (75,000 hours) is N41, 250 and at the low level of operation (5,000 hours) is N32, 000.
Maintenance cost is said to be a semi-variable cost, • therefore, we can adopt the high low method to separate it into its variable cost and fixed cost element and proceed to state the cost formula for maintenance.

We shall continue our discussion on cost estimation techniques under which we shall be looking at the statistical approach and the accounts analysis method.
2.0 Objective At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Describe and apply the statistical approach • Describe and apply the accounts analysis method.
3.1 Statistical Approach: Statistical methods may be used to remove the subjective element of the scatter graph method.
Regression analysis is used to determine the equation of the line (i.e.
cost function) that best fits the data.
The "goodness of fit" of such an equation can be tested by an examination ofthe correlation coefficients.
3.1.1 Normal Equations: The objective of simple regression is to determine an equation ofthe form Y = a + which gives the bestexplanation ofthe relationship of the observed data.
This is accomplished by the use oftwo equations usually called the normal equations.
They are stated as: Ay = na + b(x) ixy = a (Ax) + b(Ax)2 where. '
= the number of the pairs of observation Ax = the sum of the observations of the independent variable (e.g.
x = level ofoutput) Ay = the sum of the observations of the dependent variable (e.g.
y = total costs) Ax2 = the sum of the squares of the x observations fixy = the sum of the product of each pair of observation, 3.2.1 Coefficient of Correlation - Once the cost function has been determined, the next step should be to determine how well the estimated relationship explains the variation in the observations.
This can be done by • 25  MBA 805: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING calculating the coefficient of correlation.
The coefficient of correlation (r) measures the extent to which the output variable explains the changes in total costs, and may be measured by the following formula: r = Etaxy)— (âxJRay) O[n(ax2)-( a421 [n(fiy2)-( iy)2] When the co-efficient of correlation is raised to power two i.e.
(r2), it is referred to as the coefficient of determination.
It indicates the percentage of the variation in the total costs that is explained by the estimated cost function.
Its value will always be between 0 and 1.
(b) So, r = 6(68.900)— 580(70.2) 6[6(57,400)4 580)1 [6(829.84)-(702)2] = 0.955 The indicated 95.5% of the variation in total costs for the six months period is explained by changes in the volume of output produced.
The remainder is explained by random variation and the effect of other variables.

b = .78 Substitute the value of b into equation 1 thus: 702 = 6a + 580b ...................... (Eqn 1) 702 = 6a + 580 (0.78) 02 = 60 + 452.4 Collect like terms: 6a= 702 L 452.4 6a= 249.6 Divide both sides of the equation by 6 6a = 249.6 6 6 a = 41.60 Therefore, the estimated cost function is: .41 60 0.78(x) 3.2 Account Analysis Method: Under this method, the cost function is arrived at through a rough investigation ofall sources of information that makeup the total cost incurred in a defined period oftime.
Depending upon the nature of cost incurred as documented on the source documents and using a subjective judgement of the accountant, each of the costs that make up the total cost is categorized as either fixed or variable The meth' cid' is also referred to as the Account Classification because it requires an examination of accounting records.
The accounting records for some recent period are selected and an officer who is likely to be the accountant classifies each cost item according to his subjective view of its • behaviour.
For instance, cost of materials will be treated as a variable cost whereas administrative overheads will be treated as a fixed cost.

MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Some difficulties arise with semi-variable costs e.g.
electricity.
Such costs are mixed costs which comprise both the variable and fixed element.
An estimate must be made ofthe fixed element of these costs on the basis of the evidence available.
This method is fast and also inexpensive and easily revised but it has serious limitations such as: • It relies heavily on the initial decisions to classify cost category as fixed or variable, • The treatment of mixed costs is often arbitrary, and • It is sensitive to apportionment ofindirect costs which are fixed for the enterprise as a whole but variable for the departments Students Assessment Exercise Unit 6.2 During the June, 2002, Management meeting ofAJ1FOWOBAJE Manufacturing Nigeria Ltd.; the production manager criticized the inaccuracies in the accountant's cost statement which have repeatedly shown wide variances between actual and forecast.

We shall be taking a look at break — even analysis and this will cover: • Definition of break — even analysis.
• Variable costs and fixed costs.
• Assumptions underlying the break-even analysis.
• Areas of application of the break—even analysis • Break—even analysis terminology 2.0 Objectives: At-the end of this unit, you are expected to be able to: • Define break—even analysis • Distinguish a variable cost from a fixed cost • List the assumptions underlying the break—even analysis • Describe the areas of application of the break—even analysis • Define break—even analysis terminologies.
3.1 Definition of break—even analysis.
Break—even analysis is the term given to the study of the interrelationship between cost, volume and profit at various levels of activity It is a system of analyzing costs into fixed and variable components to determine the probable profit at any given level of activity.
A firm is said to be operating at the break—even point when it has generated enough sales revenue to cover total cost.
This is the point of operation at which a firm makes neither a profit nor a loss.
You would recall that before you can start a business, you would have incurred some establishment costs like rent of shop.
This rent of shop will be fixed irrespective of the fact that you are providing services or not.
If in a particular month, no services are provided, then your loss for that month would be, the total amount of fixed cost incurred on rent.
But as you begin to provide the service and make or generate revenue per unit of service, the loss earlier mentioned would be reducing as you generate more revenue.
It will get to a point that you would have generated enough sales revenue to cover both your fixed cost and variable cost of providing the service.
At this point, you would say you have broken even, only that you are not making a profit, but at the same time, you are not making a loss, that is, total revenue has equated total cost.
30  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.2 Variable cost and Fixed cost 3.2.1.
Variable cost.
You will recall from the study from earlier unit that variable cost is defined as " a cost, which tends to change (vary) with the level of activity".
Thus, it is a cost, which changes directly with the level of sales, output (quantity) and cost.
In break-even analysis, variable cost per unit is assumed to be constant, therefore, the variable cost curve is linear i.e.
a straight line.
Variable cost curve Costs Y = b(x) 0 Output Students Assessment Exercise Mention the variable costs that are involved in the production of leather shoes.
3.2.2.
Fixed cost: You will also recall from your earlier study that a fixed cost is defined "as a cost which is incurred for a period, and which, within certain output and turnover (sales) limit, tends to be unaffected by changes in the level of activity.
It may also be termed as a period cost.
Examples are rent, rates, insurance and salaries of managers etc.
Thus, it is a cost, which is not affected by changes in cost, volume or sales, within certain limit.
The fixed cost curve is parallel to the output axis and remains constant throughout the relevant range.
Fixed cost curve Cost Students Assessment Exercise Mention the fixed cost that may be found in the production of leather shoes.
3.3 Assumptions underlying breakeven analysis - •••• Constant variable cost per unit •••• Constant total fixed cost per period •••• Constant selling price per unit •••• Constant stock levels i.e.
stock levels do not vary significantly.
In other words, production output (units) = Sales level (units) 31  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING • Constant sales mix at all levels of activity where more than one product is included in the analysis.
• A relevant range is determinable • Divisibility of mixed costs into its fixed and variable elements.
• Technology, production methods and efficiency remain unchanged • The only factor that affects cost and revenue is volume i.e.
output.
Students Assessment Exercise Recall and list six of the assumptions underlying the principles of breakeven analysis - 3.4 Areas of application of break-even analysis: • For budget planning — it is used to determine the volume of sales required to make profit, a targeted profit level, and to determine the margin of safety.
• For determining product pricing and sales volume decisions • For determining optimum production and sales mix.
• For determining the effect of capacity utilization on cost.
3.5 Breakeven analysis terminologies: — • Break—Even Point- It is a point of activity where total sales or revenue is equal to total cost.
Thus, it is the level of activity where neither profit nor loss is made.
• Break—Even Units: This is the Volume of production (quantity) which when sold, would make total cost to equal total sales.
In other words, it is the level of units where the firm breaks even.
Students Assessment Exercise Can you still remember the areas of application of break-even analysis?
State any three areas.
4.0 Conclusion • Break-even analysis has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for management in budget planning, for determining product pricing, for determining optimum production and sales mix and for determining the effect of capacity utilization on cost.
5.0 Summary In this unit, attempts have been made to define break-even analysis, to distinguish a variable cost from a fixed cost, to list the assumptions underlying the application of break-even analysis, to describe the areas of application of break-even analysis and to define break- even terminology.

Contribution to sales Ratio (Vs Ratio): This is also called the profit-volume ratio or the contribution percentage.
It is the contribution achieved as a percentage of sales ofa product.
It measures the amount of contribution that would be achieved on a N sales.
It is calculated as follows: Change in profit X 100 Change in sales 1 3.1.1.2.
Margin of safety (M.O.S.)
This is the excess ofbudgeted sales over break—even sales.
It measures the sensitivity ofa firm to unfavorable responses in operation i.e.
the amount by which actual sales may fall short ofthe budgeted level without the firm incurring a loss.
It is calculated as Budgeted Sales — Break-Even Sales X 100 Budgeted Sales 1 36/ .
MBA 719; MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.1.1.3.
Contribution: This is the difference between sales and variable cost.
It is the effort made in N value towards the recovery of fixed costs and subsequently towards generating profit.
Therefore, contribution is equal to fixed cost plus profit i.e.
(fixed cost + profit).
Contribution per unit is the difference between the selling price per unit and variable cost per unit.

Break—even analysis can also be made on the graph known as the traditional break- even graph.
Thus, the break-even point in units and value, sales (N) and sales in unit etc., can be ascertained from the graph.
The break—even graph can be drawn by considering the following factors: • Selling price or sales revenue at each level of activity (output) • Variable cost per unit.
• rota] fixed cost.
• Total cost at each level of activity (output), and • Various levels of activity (output) The Traditional Break —Even Chart.

3.2.3 Angle of Incidence: This is' the angle at which the sales line cuts the total cost line on the break—even chart A large angle of incidence indicates high profit rate while a low angle indicates a low profit rate.
A firm would be in an extremely favorable position if both the angle of incidence and the margin of safety are large.

The Profit Volume Graph: The profit volume graph is similar to the break—even chart in that it also records the profit or loss at each level of sales at a given sales price.
It is a straight-line graph, drawn most simply by recording: • The loss at zero sales, which is the full amount of fiXed cost; and • l'he profit (or loss) at the budgeted level of sales • Joining the two points by a straight line Note: Where this straight line touches the x — axis will indicate the sales value required to break even.

You are required to draw a profit volume graph to show: (a) Expected amount of sales N (b) Sales (N) required to break even, and (c) The margin of safety.
3.4 Limitations of the break—even analysis: Limitations underlying the application of the break—even analysis depend largely on the restrictions imposed by the assumptions.
They include: • Total costs cannot always be separated into fixed and variable cost components.
There are other types of costs, which are possible to be incurred.
E.g.
semi — variable cost, stepped costs e.t.c.
• Because of quantity discount, selling price per unit cannot remain constant.
• Total fixed costs cannot always remain constant throughout the production period.
Outside a relevant range, fixed cost would become stepped cost.
• Most firms are poly — product companies.
• The prices of factors of production would not remain constant • Productivity per worker would not remain constant because of learning curve factor • Volume of output is not the only factor that influences costs or sales.
Weather, religion, habit, taste, sex are other factors affecting costs or sales.
• We do not operate in a perfect world therefore production units cannot always equal sales units.
Students Assessment Exercise With the way you are receiving your lectures via satellite and distance communication, do you think it would be reasonable to assume that technological development will remain constant?

2.0 Objectives: At the end ofthis unit you should be able to: •••• Define marginal costing •••• Describe the areas ofapplication ofmarginal costing technique •••• List the advantages of inarginal costing tedmique •••• List the disadvantages ofmarginal costing technique 3.1 Definition of marginal costing: Marginal costing may be defined as a cost accounting system in which variable costs are charged to cost units (product costs) and the fixed costs of the period are written off in hill against the contribution for the period.
It is a suitable technique for decision-making.
3.2 Areas of application of marginal costing techniques •••• It forms a basis for providing information to management for planning and decision- making.
It is particularly appropriate for short nun decisions like: •••• Make or buy decision •••• Optimal products mix in a situation of resource constraints •••• Acceptance or rejection of special contracts that utilize excess capacity.
•••• Closure ofa department.
•••• It can also be used in the routine cost accounting system for the calculation •••• of stocks.
It is an alternative to absorption costing.
3.3 Advantages of marginal costing: - The following are the advantages ofmarginal costing.
- It is simple to operate • Under or over absorption of overhead is avoided It is possible to fix selling prices knowing the true cost ofproduction.
43  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING It provides information that shows goods that should be manufactured and those that should be purchased from outside sources.
Fixed costs are related to time.
Examples include salaries, rent and rates etc., and do not relate to productivity.
Hence it is logical to write them off in the period in which they are incurred and this is done using marginal costing.
Students Assessment Exercise List two areas of application of marginal costing technique and describe it's advantages 3.4 Disadvantages of marginal costing The following are the demerits ofmarginal costing technique: • It is difficult to understand why selling prices of products should be fixed at a price less than its total cost of production.
• The period costs are ignored and hence two jobs may have the same marginal cost but one may last twice as long as the other.
The actual cost of the job that has taken a longer time is therefore higher than that of the other one.
This is not disclosed by marginal costing.
• In some industries, the cost per unit of direct labour increases as production level increases.
• As production becomes more intensified on more expensive high — capacity automatic machinery, the weight offixed cost increases and this should be allowed for in price fixing.

We shall be discussing marginal costing technique and its application to management decision making under which we shall be looking at the concept of management decision making, stages in decision making, basic assumptions of the marginal costing technique, qualitative and quantitative factors in decision making, relevant cost and historical cost, avoidable cost and opportunity cost.. 2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Describe the concept of management decision • Define decision making • List the stages in decision making • Describe the basic assumptions of marginal costing technique • Distinguish between qualitative and quantitative factors in decision making • Distinguish between relevant cost and historical cost • Describe avoidable cost • Describe opportunity cost.
3.1 Concept of management decision One ofthe basic functions of management is decision making, and decision-making often involves • the selection of a course of action from among a set of alternatives.
For each problem, there are always at least two alternatives available, of which one of such alternatives is to continue as before or to do nothing.
For example, alternatives may be to: 47  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING • Continue to perform an operation by hand • Buy new machines • Improve the present method of working • Eliminate the manufacturing operation altogether and get the operation performed from another manufacturer The most useful contribution of marginal costing is the assistance that it renders to the management in vital decision-making.
This is to say that marginal costing is an invaluable aid to management decision making.
3.2 Decision making: Decision-making is futuristic and involves a choice between alternatives.
Many factors both qualitative and quantitative would provide information for many decisions.
Student Assessment Exercise Think of an activity that would lead to your making a decision and the alternative options available to you.
3.3 Stages in decisionmaking - • Defining the problem • Identifying various alternatives • Determining relevant cost and revenue data • Evaluating the data • Consider non — cost factors like quality of product, employee morale, etc • Making a decision Student Assessment Exercise Did you follow the stages mentioned in paragraph 3.3 in taking a decision under paragraph 3.2?
3.4 Basic assumption of marginal costing techniques: Marginal costing is based on the assumptions of cost behaviour: • P eriod fixed costs which are constant amounts, and no matter what the volume of sales and production is (provided that operation is within a relevant range).
It follows that by making and selling one extra unit of a product, total cost will rise only by the variable cost i.e the marginal cost of production for that unit.
• Similarly, total cost will fall by the variable cost per unit for each reduction by one unit in the level of activity.
• The additional profit earned by making and selling one extra unit of output is the extra revenue from sales minus the variable cost ofthe unit.
• As the volume of activity increases, there will be an increase in total profit, which is equal to the total extra revenue minus total extra variable cost.
This is the additional total contribution from the extra output and sales.
• Contribution is described as "contribution towards the recovery of fixed period costs and making profit".
The total profit in a period is the total revenue minus the total variable costs of goods sold minus the total fixed cost of the period.
48  MBA 7.19: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise Define the following: (a) Marginal cost.
(b) Contribution (c) P r o f i t 3.5 Qualitative and quantitative factors in decision making: 3.5.1 Qualitative factors: These are those whose measurement in naira value is difficult and in — precise, yet a qualitative factor may easily be given more weight than the cost — savings analysis.
For example, a decision to manufacture some products components at a cost below supplier quotation may be rejected because ofthe following: • A long term dependence on the supplier for other important sub — assemblies • The quality of the component produced by the supplier vis — a— vis internal production • Reliability ofthe supplier • Possibility ofalternative wa)is to which internal facilities could be utilized, ifpurchase is made from outside.
• The dangers associated with the release of the company's trade secrets • The volume that is required both in the short run and long run may not justify inveitment in internal production.
3.5.2 Quantitative factors: These are those that may easily be reduced to terms of naira and kobo such as projected alternative cost ofmaterials, direct labour and overhead.
The accountants, statisticians and mathematicians increasingly try to express as many decision factors as possible in quantitative terms.
This approach tends to reduce the number of quantitative factors to be judged.
Student Assessment Exercise: What arethe qualitative factors to the decision you made in paragraph 3.2 3.6 Relevant cost and historical cost 3.6.1 Relevant costs —these are expected future costs that will differ under different alternatives.
The function of decision-making is to select courses of action for the future.
So, a key question in determining relevant cost is "what difference will be made".
3.6.2 Historical costs — these are past costs i.e.
already incurred, and are also referred to as sunk costs and are therefore irrelevant in decision-making.
Students Assessment Exercise: It has been said, that" marginal costs are used primarily in guiding decisions yet to be made".
Explthn the foregoing statement 3.7 Avoidable costs All costSffiat would be avoided and all revenues, which would be forgone ifthat particular alternative were not adopted, are relevant costs and revenues.
It follows teerefore that avoidable costs are "incremental costs" or "additional costs".
Any cost which will remain constant in amount whichever alternative is adopted is not relevant and should not be considered at all, and therefore ignored.
49  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise A machine has a book value ofN50,000 and a scrap value of N5,000.
(a) How much is sunk cost?
(b) How much is relevant cost?
Solution ( a ) N 5 0 , 0 0 0 ( b ) N 5 , 0 0 0 3.8 Opportunity costs Opportunity cost is always a relevant cost when the problem facing the firm is a problem of choice.
Opportunity cost is defined as the "best alternative foregone".
This is because the best alternative could have been the next choice if the first choice was not made.
The following list would .
enable you to identify the opportunity cost in any circumstance: • It does not involve future cash flows • It is not in any way based on historical or acquisition cost of the resource • There is no opportunity cost for something not possessed • The resource should be limited in supply before it can have an opportunity cost.
• It is the net realizable value of the asset if the asset could be sold.
• It is the rental value of the asset, if the asset could be hired out.
• It is the transfer value of the asset, ifthe asset could be put into alternative use within • the company.
• Ifthe asset or resource can be sold, rented or put into alternative use, the opportunity cost is the best foregone alternative • Opportunity costs are imputed cost.
Student Assessment Exercise The revenue and cost data for two products are given as follows: A B N N N N Sales costs: 40 90 Materials 30 20 Labour 25 18 Overhead 17 72 10 48 68 42.
The company can only choose only one product.
If i chooses product A, the relevant cost statement evaluating product/ A should be presented as follows: 50-  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Sales 140 Less: relevant costs Material 30 Labour 25 Overhead 17 Opportunity cost ofB 42 141 26 4.0.
Conclusion: Marginal costing techniques and how they can be applied to management decision were discussed extensively in this unit.
5.0 Summary In this unit, attempts have been made to describe the concept of management decision, define decision making to list the stages in decision making, to describe the basic assuniption of marginal costing technique, to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative factors in decision making, to distinguish between relevant cost and historical cost and to describe avoidable cost and opportunity cost.

We shall be having a look at the application of marginal costing technique to management decision-making.
2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: Apply marginal costing techniques to nake or buy decision • 3.0 Make or buy decisions: This type of decision problem occurs when management is contemplating on whether a component part used in the production of a main product should be manufactured internally or purchased from outside suppliers.
The following format should be applied for optimal decision: Supplier quotation Less: Incremental outlay: Incremental cost.... ?WC Opportunity cost... XXX )cxx ...(b) Decision criteria: If (a) is greater than (b), produce the product internally.
If (b) is greater than (a), then buy the product from the outside supplier.
Illustration: 1 A firm is considering whether to manufacture or purchase a particular component k543.
This would be in batches of 10,000 units and the buying-in price will be N 6.50 per unit.
The marginal cost of manufacturing component k543 is N 4.75 per unit and the component would have to be made on a machine, which is currently working at full capacity.
Ifthe component was manufactured, it is estimated that the sales of the finished product "F P97" will be reduced by 1,000 units.
Product "F P97" has a marginal cost ofN 60.00 per unit and sells for N 80.00 per unit.
52 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING You are required to determine whether or not the firm should manufacture or purchase component "k543".
Solution to illustration 1 Relevant cost of production: Marginal cost (10,000 x N 4.75) 47.500 Add.

One of the components produced by the company which is incorporated into another before been sold has a budgeted manufacturing cost as follows: Direct material 14.00 Direct labour (4hours @ N3) 12.00 Variable overload (4hours @ N2) 8.00 Fixed overhead (4hours @ N5) 20.00 54.00 Banlcy Nig.
Ltd. has offered to supply the above component at a guaranteed price of N50 per unit.
Requirement: (a).
Considering cost criterion only, advise the management of Jogs Mg. Ltd whether the above component should be purchased from Banky Nig.
Ltd or not (b).
Explain how your advice will be affected by the situation below: "As a result of government legislation, ifJogs Nig.
Ltd continues to manufacture this component the company will incur additional inspection and testing expenses of1V56,000 per annum which are not included in the above budgeted manufacturing cost" (c) The Production Director ofJogs Wig.
Ltd; recently said "we must continue to manufacture the component as only one year ago, we purchased some special grinding equipment to be used exclusively by this component.
The equipment cost N100,000, it cannot be resold, or used elsewhere and if we cease production of this component, we will have to write off the bookvalue ofN80,000".
• You are required to draft a reply to the Production Director position commenting on his assertions.

(b) 35,000 units should be produced to offset the N56, 000 expense since N16.00 is the saving made on each unit produced.
i.e.
N 56.000 N 16 (c) RESPONSE TO THE PRODUCTION DIRECTOR'S COMMENT ON SUNK COSTS (i) Neither the book value nor the cost of the machine is relevant for the purpose of decision-making.
As a matter of fact, they are sunk costs.
When making decisions, only the variable costs that make a difference between the alternative courses of action should be recognized.
(iii).
All past costs should be completely ignored or else, solutions arrived at will be sub-optimal.

Table of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Product profitability decision 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 References and other further readings 7.0 Tutor marked assignments 1.0 Introduction This is unit 12 of this course Management Accounting, and it will cover a period ofone hour.
We shall continue our discussion on the application of marginal costing technique to management decision-making.
2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Apply marginal costing techniques to product profitability decision 3.0 Product profitability decision This type of problem arises when management is in a dilemma as to whether a product or a department that is presently making a loss should be discontinued or not.
An optimal decision cannot be made on the basis of financial report prepared by the financial report prepared by the financial accountant due to the reason of arbitrariness involved in the allocation apportionment and absorption of fixed overheads.
A marginal costing report has to be prepared to highlight the contribution emanating from the product line or department before an optimal decision can be made.
Decision Rule: , • If the product shows a positive contribution towards the recovery of general • fixed costs, do not discontinue.
• If the product shows a negative contribution towards the recovery of general • fixed costs, drop the product line.
• Consideration must be given to qualitative factors before the final decision can be talcen.
Format: Total sales Less: variable cost Variable contribution Less: Attributable fixed cost Total contribution 57  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Illustration 1: A company produces three products for which the following statemen has been produced: X Y Z Total N N N N Sales 32,000 50,000 45,000 127,000 Less: total cost 36,000 38,000 34,000 108,000 (4000) 12,000 11,000 19,000 The total costs comprise (2/3) variable cost elements and (1/3) fixed cost elements.
The directors considered that as product "X" is showing a loss in its operating result, it should be discontinued.
Requirement (a) Based on the above data, should product "x" be dropped?
(b) What are the other factors that should be considered?
Solution to illustration 1: Total cost Variable cost Fixed cost N N N X 36,000 24,000 12,000 Y 38,0W 25,333 12,667 Z 34,0W 22,667 11333 108,000 72,003 36,000 X Y Z Total N N N N Sales 32,000 50,0W 45,000 127,C00 Less: Variable cost 24,000 25,333 23,667 72,0W 8,0W 24,667 ' 22,333 55,000 - Less: fixed cost 36,000 Profit 19,000 Decision: Product 'X' should not be discontinued as it makes a contribution of N 8,000 to the total profit.
If product 'X' should be discontinued, the profit level would reduce by the N8,000 which is the contribution made by product 'X' From the above analysis, it can be seen that product 'X' makes a contribution of N 8,000 to the recovery of fixed costs.
If product 'X' is dropped, the position will be like: 58  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Contribution from product 'Y' 24,667 Contribution from product 'Z' 22,333 Total contribution from products "V" and "Z" 47,000 Less: fixed costs 36,000 Profit 11000 , Product 'X' should not be dropped, otherwise, net profit will reduce by N8, 000.
(i3) Qualitative factors: • Possible loss of goodwill if product 'X' is discontinued as a result of the inability to satisfy the contpany's customers.
• Low morale aztiong other workers.
The retrenchment to be suffered in the affected departntent will have a negative impact on the other workers in other departments and this may affect their productivity with other product lines.
Illustration 2: Georgina Company Nigeria Limited is considering the option of discontinuing with Department 'El', one of the three departments, which it currently maintains.
The following information has been gathered for the three departments.
Department A Department B Department C N N N Sales MOW 50,003 80,000 Cost of goods sold (40,000) (42,000) (60,000) Salaries (8,0(X)) (4400) (12,00)) Rent (2,000) (2,000) ' (3,000) Utilities (1,000) (2,700) (2,000) (51,0k) (53,00)) (77,0(k) Net income or (loss) 9,0W (3,100) 3,000 Because department '13' is making a loss, management is contemplating scrapping it If department 'B' is eliminated, the space it occupies will be divided equally among Departments A and C. Utilities are allocated on the basis offloor space occupied.
70% ofthe salaries in department 'B' will be eliminated while the other 30% will be split equally between Departments A and C. You are required to: (a) Determine whether or not Department 'B' should be eliminated.
(b) State other factors which the management of Georgina Nig Ltd should take into consideration in making the decision as to whether or not Department 'B' should be discontinued.

This is unit 13 of this course Management Accounting, and it covers a period of one hour.
We shall be taking a look at budgetary control.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: •••• Describe a budget •••• Describe budgetary control •••• State the objectives ofbudgetary control •••• List the advantages and disadvantages ofbudgetary control system 3.1 Concept of budget: You should be familiar with the idea of a plan.
Not only in business, but also in private life, people make plans, though there are considerable differences in the way which different people make their plans.
Some people do their plans in their heads, others do it on rough papers and yet others formally express their plans in quantitative terms.
The process of expressing plans in quantitative terms is referred to as budgeting.
A budget therefore is a plan relating to a period of time, expressed in quantitative terms.
It has been defined by CIMA terminologies as "a financial and/or quantitative statement, prepared prior to a defined period of time, ofthe policy to be pursued during that period, for the purpose of attaining a given objective".
This budget reveals the following characteristics of a budget: •••• A budget may be expressed in monetary terms and or non — monetary terms like units of products, units oftime, number of employees e.t.c.
•••• A budget is concerned with a definite future period, and is therefore, prepared in advance of the period during which it is to operate.
•••• The purpose ofa budget is to implement the policies formulated by the management for attaining the given objectives.
63  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise Assume that your objective is to earn a B. Sc degree in five years time by open and distance learning, develop a plan and a budget of doing this.
3.2 Concept of budgetary control: Budgetary control is a system of controlling costs, which includei the preparation of budgets.
Budgeting is thus only a part of the budgetary control According to CIMA terminologies, budgetary control is "the establishment of budgets relating to the responsibilities of executives of a policy and the continuous comparison of the actual with the budgeted results either to secure by individual action the objective of the policy or to provide a basis for its revision" The following characteristics of budgetary control can be noted • Establish a budget or target of performance • Record the actual performance • Compare the actual performance with that budgeted • Establish the differences and analyze the reasons for them • Act immediately, if necessary, for corrective actions to be taken.
The principles involved in budgeting can be likened to those followed by the captain of a ship.
Before his voyage, he would have planned his route by taking into consideration such factors as shipping hazards, tides and possible adverse weather forecast During the journey, he will record details of progress and frequently checks actual progress with that planned.
Though trying to keep to the plan, he may have to deviate froth the plan if prevailing circumstances require it.
On the completion ofthe journey, he will compare the conditions he encountered with those he expected.
The experience so gained will be used by him to plan similar voyages in the future.
Students Assessment Exercise Subject your plan in paragraph 3.1 to budgetary control.
Are you still convinced that you should go ahead with your desire to earn a B.Sc.
degree by open and distance learning or do you feel equipped to face the challenges ahead?
3.3 Objectives of budgetary control: The objectives ofbudgetary control are: •••• To plan A budget provides a detailed plan of action for a business over a — definite period of time.
Detailed plan relating to production, sales, raw material requirements, labour needs, advertising and sales promotion performances, research and development activities, capital and additions e.t.c.
are drawn up.
By planning, many problems are anticipated long before they arrive and solutions can be sought through carefiil study.
•••• To coordinate Budgeting aids mangers in coordinating their efforts so that — objectives of the organization as a whole are hannonized with the objectives of its constituent parts.
Effective planning and organization contribute a lot in achieving coordination.
For example, coordination requires that purchase managers integrate their plan with production requirements and the production managers use the sales budget to help them anticipate and plan for the manpower and plant facilities required.
•••• To communicate Abudget is a communication device.
The approved budget, — showing in detail the plans of the management, will not be carried out unless the 64  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING organization understands what the plans are.
Copies of the budgets may be distributed to all management staff which will serve to provide not only adequate understanding and knowledge of the programmes and policies but also to give a knowledge about the restrictions to which the organization is expected to adhere.
For example, the maximum amounts that can be spent on advertisements, maintenance etc., will be brought to the attention of the executives concerned.
•••• To control — control is the action necessary to ensure that plans and objectives are being achieved Control as applied to budgeting, may be thought of as a systematized effort aimed at keeping management informed of whether predetermined plans are being achieved or not.
Control comes through variance analysis and reporting.
•••• To motivate — Individuals in the organization are motivated by careful setting and communication oftargets.
Students Assessment Exercise A production manager planned to produce 10,000 units of a particular product while the sales manager has capacity to sell just 5,000 units of the same production.
What do you think is the missing link here?
3.4 Advantages of budgetary control: The following are the advantages derived from budgetary control: •••• Planning — It provides a well-organized plan based on facts.
It provides definite objectives with regard to figure operations.
At the same time, executive policies for the future are formulated.
•••• Control Tit enables management to control each faction or department in order to attain the best possible result by each department.
This is done by continuous comparison of actual against plan indicating where control is needed.
•••• Coordination — It promotes and encourages coordination between departments of a business, for the attainment of the overall good ofthe organization.
•••• Cost consciousness — The existence of budgetary control makes management to become more cost conscious and this can help to eliminate waste and inefficiency.
Management by Exception — Management precious time can be saved and attention directed to areas of more pressing and difficult — areas by the exception principle which is the essential feature ofbudgetary control.
•••• Responsibility of management—It enables responsibility of each manager to be clearly established.
•••• Measurement of performance — It provides a means of measuring the performance of individual managers and the various cost centers or departments by comparing targets (budget) against which the performance of managers can be assessed.
65  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING •••• Communication and motivation — Preparation of budgets involves communication between top management and lower levels on how to attain the objectives.
Reasonable agreement motivates managers to achieve the target set.
•••• Prevention of waste- budgetary control prevents waste of physical resources such as labour, equipment, machinery etc.
Duplication of efforts is avoided since the most efficient and effective use of these resources is specified in the budget.
•••• Authorization and Delegation - Approval ofthe master budget explicitly and expressly authorizes the policy represented by the budget, and by accepting their budgets, the responsibility for carrying out the policy can be delegated to individual managers.
Students Assessment Exercise Discuss the advantages derivable from a budgetary control system.
3.5 Limitations of budgetary control: Budget is not a cure —all for organization ills.
Budgetary control system suffers from certain limitations, and those using the system should be fully aware ofthem.
The main limitations are: •••• The budget plan is based on estimates: Budgets are based on forecasts and forecast estimates cannot be an exact science.
Absolute accuracy, therefore, is not possible in forecasting and budgeting.
The strength or weakness of the budgetary control system depends to a large extent, on the accuracy with which estimates are made.
Thus while, using the system, the fact that budgets are based on estimates must be kept in view.
•••• Danger of rigidity: Abudget programme must be dynamic and continuously deal with the changing business conditions.
Budgets will lose much of their usefulness ifthey are not flexible and revised with the changing circumstances.
•••• Budgeting is only a tool of management —Budgeting cannot take the place of management.
The budget is a means to an end and not an end in itself Sometimes, it is believed that the introduction of a budget programme is alone sufficient to ensure its success.
The execution of a budget will not occur automatically.
It is necessary that the entire organization must participate enthusiastically in the programme for the realization ofthe budgetary goals.
•••• Expensive technique — The installation and operation of a budgetary control system is a costly affair as it requires the employment of specialized staff and involves other expenditures so much that small business concerns may find it difficult to adopt it .
However, it is essential that the cost of introducing and operating a budgetary control system should not exceed the benefits to be derived from it.
66 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING • Budgets are developed round existing organizational structures, which may be inappropriate for current conditions.
• Budgetary control lowers morale and productivity since clear and realistic objectives of desired performance may be difficulty to establish.
Students Assessment Exercise Discuss the limitations inherent in the installation of a budgetary control system.
4.0 Conclusion Budgetary control system has been demonstrated as a technique that atsints management to achieve its planning, controlling, coordinating, cotnmunicating and motivating unctions.
5.0 Summary In this twit, attempts have been made at describing a budget, budgetary control, stating the objectives ofbudgetary control and to list the advantages and disadvantages of a budgetary control system.

We shall continue our discussion on budgets and budgetary control 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: • Identify the considerations in the installation of a budgetary control system.
• Distinguish between forecasting and budgeting 3.1 Considerations in the installation of a budgetary control system.
3.1.1 Creation of budget centers: A budget center is a section of the organization of an undertaking created for the purpose of budgetary control.
Budget centers must be clearly defined because a separate budget has to be set for each of such center with the help of the head of department concerned.
For example, in the preparation of purchase budget, the purchase manager has to be consulted Similarly while preparing labour cost budgets, the personnel manager will be of great help 3.1.2 Introduction ofAdequate Accounting Records: There is a close relationship between budgeting and accounting.
For the preparation of budgets, one has to depend heavily on accounting department for reliable historical data, which necessarily forms the basis fOr many estimates.
The accounting system should be so designed so as to be able to record and analyze the information required.
The budget procedures must also employ the same classification of revenues and expenses as the accounting department.
Comparisons cannot be made if the classifications do not coincide.
A chart of accounts corresponding to the budget centers should be maintained.
68 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCO WING 3.1.3 Preparation of an organization chart: Proper organization is essential for a successful budget system.
An organization chart should be prepared which clearly shows the plan of the organisation.
Each member of management should know the exact scope of his responsibility and authority and his relationship to other members For this purpose copies of the organization chart and written supplement should be distributed to all those concerned ORGANIZATION CHART FOR BUDGETARY CONTROL Managing Director 'Jr Budget committee Ilr Budget Director 1.

3.1.4 Establishment of Budget Committee: In large organizations generally, the direction and execution of the budget is delegated to a budget Committee, which reports directly to the top management.
The financial controller is usually appointed to serve as the budget director.
He would be in charge of preparing the budget manual or instruction, and accumulates the budgeted and actual figures for reporting.
Other members of the budget committee usually comprise of various heads of functional departments, like the sales manager, purchase manager, production manager, personnel manager, chief accountant etc Each member would prepare his/her own departmental budget(s), which will then be considered by the committee for coordination.
69  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING The main functions of a budget committee are: • To provide historical data to all departmental heads to help them in estimations • To issue instructions to departments regarding requirements, dates of submission of estimates etc.
• To define the general policies ofthe management in relation to the budget system.
• To receive budget estimates from various departments for consideration and review • To discuss difficulties with departmental heads and suggest possible revisions.
• To evaluate and revise the estimates before preparing the final budget • To make recommendations on budget matters where there is a conflict between departments • To prepare budget summaries • To prepare a master budget after functional budgets must have been approved • To inform departmental head of any revisions made in their budgets by the committee • To coordinate all budget work • To analyze variances and recommend corrective action, where necessary.
3.1.5.
Preparation of Budget Manual: A budget manual is defined by C.I.M.A.
as "a document which sets out the responsibilities ofthe persons engaged in the routine of and the forms and records required for budgetary control".
A budget manual is thus a statement ofbudget policies and lays down the details ofthe organizational set up with duties and responsibilities of executives, including the budget committee and budget director and the procedures and programmes to be followed for developing budgets for various activities.
The contents of a budget manual are summarized as follows: • Description of the budget system and its objectives • Procedure and forms to be used in budget preparation • Responsibilities of operational executives, budget committee and budget director • Budget calendar, specifying definite dates for the completion of each part ofthe budget and submission ofthe reports • Method of accounting and accounting codes in use.
• Procedures to be adopted in operating the system Following up procedures 3.1.6 Budgeting period: A budget period is a length of time for which a budget is prepared and operated.
Budget periods vary between short term and long tent and no specific period can be down for all budgets.
It varies among concerns and industries as a result of several factors.
Abudget is usually prepared for one year, which corresponds to the accounting year.
It is then sub-divided into quarters, and in turn, each quarter is broken down into three separate months.
When a business experiences seasonal fluctuations, the budget period may be fixed to cover one seasonal cycle.
If the seasonal cycle covers (say) two on three years, a long-term budget should be prepared to cover that period.
This long period may then be broken down into smaller period by preparing short-term budgets.
Budgets for capital expenditures are usually prepared on a long-term basis.
For example, in construction companies, which incur very heavy capital expenditures, the need for new crane is possibly forecast five to ten years in advance.
Such long-term budgets are supitlemented by short term ones.
70 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.1.7 Determination of Key Budget Factors: Key budget factors are also referred to as "limiting factors", "governing factors" or "principal budget factor".
The key factor means the factor, which limits the size of output It is defined as 'The factor the extent ofwhose influence must first be assessed in order to ensure that functional budgets are capable of fulfillment".
Such a factor is of vital importance and affects all budgetsto a large extent The key factor serves as the starting point for the preparation of budgets.
For instance, when sales potential is limited, sales become the key factor.
Therefore, sales budget should be prepared first.
Production and other budgets will then follow the sales budget.
Thus a key factor determines priorities in functional budgets.
Among the various key factors which affect budgeting are the following: (a) Sales: • Low market demand • Shortage of experienced salesmen • Inadequate advertising due to shortage of funds (b) Materials: • Availability ofraw materials • Restrictions imposed on import licenses, foreign exchange allocation etc.
(c) Labour: • General man-power shortage • Shortage of specialized labour in a particular process (d) Plant: • Limited plant capacity • Bottlenecks in certain key process It is possible that more than one key factor is operating at the same time.
Under such conditions, the relative impact of factors is considered in budget preparation.
Moreover, • key factor is not necessarily a permanent factor.
The management may be provided with opportunities to overcome the limitation imposed by key factors.
For example, plant capacity can be increased by the installation of new and improved plant and machinery, which may be financed by the issue of new shares or by lease agreement.
Student Assessment Exercise What are the key budget factors in your desire to earn a B.Sc degree by open and distance learning?
List them.
3.2 Forecasting and Budget Compared.
It is important to note the distinction between a forecast and a budget.
A forecast is a prediction of what will happen as a result of a given set of circumstances.
It is an assessment of probable future events.
A budget, on the other hand, is a planned result that an enterprise aims to attain.
It is based on the implications of a forecast.
Forecasting thus precedes the preparation ofbudgets.
The main distinction between the two is that forecast is concerned with "probable events" whereas budget relates to "planned event".
'71  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Student Assessment Exercise oistinguish between a forecast and a budget.
4.0 Conclusion The introduction of an accounting system and an organizational chart would assist in achieving the objectives of a budgetary control system 5.0 Summary: In this unit, attempts have been made to identify the considerations in the installation of a budgetary control system and to distinguish between forecasting and budgeting.

This is unit 15 of the course Management Accounting, and it will cover a period of one hour.
We shall continue our discussion of budgets and budgetary control.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to describe the different types of functional budgets 3.1 Functional Budgets A functional budget is one, which relates to a function of the business e.g.
sales, production etc all the functional budgets are summarized into what is known as a "master budget."
These functional budgets are therefore subsidiary budgets ofthe master budget.
3.2 Sales Budget In most companies, the sales budget is not only the most important but the most difficult to prepare.
The importance of this budget arises from the fact that if sales figures are incorrect then practically, all other budgets will be affected.
The sales budget is a statement ofplanned sales in tams ofquantity and value and analysis byproducts.
It forecasts what the company can reasonably expect to sell to its customers during the budget period.
The sales budget can be prepared to show sales classified according to products, salesmen, customers, territories, period, etc.
3.3 Production Budget The production budget is an estimate ofproduction for the budget period.
It is first drawn up in quantities of each product and when the remaining budgets have been compiled and cost of production calculated, then the:quantities of production are translated into money terms, and what, 73  MBA 719: • MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING in effect, becomes a production cost budget.
The production budget is the initial step in budgeting manufacturing operations.
There are at least three principal budgets related to manufacturing in addition to production budget.
These are raw materials budget, labour budget and production overhead budget.
Example The following information has been made available from the records ofPrecision Tools Nig.
Ltd for the six month s o f 2000 (and of only the sales of January 2001) in respect of product x: (i) The units to be sold in different months are: July 2000 1,100 August 2000 1,100 September 2000 1,700 October 2000 1,900 November 2000 2,500 December 2000 2,300 January 2001 2000 00 There will be no work in progress at the end of any month.
(li) Finished units, which are equal to half the sales of the next month will be in stock at the end of every month (including June, 2000) (iv) Budgeted production and production cost for the year ending 31" December 2000 are as follows: Production (units) 22,000 Direct materials per unit N10 Direct wages per unit N4 Total factory overhead apportioned to production N88,000 You are required to prepare: (a) A Production Budget for each of the six months of 2000, and (b) A Summarized Production Cost Budget for the same period.
Solution: (a) Production Budget for six months ending December 2000 July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Units Units Units Units Units Units Opening stock *550 550 850 950 1,250 1150 Add Production 1100 1400 1800 2200 2403 2150 3650 3300 Goods Availability for Sale 1650 1950 2650 3150 Less: Closing stock 550 850 950 1250 1150 1000 Sales 1100 1100 1700 1900 2500 2300 *Half ofJuly sales (1100 units) should be the closing stock of June i.e.
550 units.
Closing stock of June will automatically be the opening stock of July.
74 Mkt 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Production Cost Budget for the six months ending December, 2000 Production 11,050 units Direct material (N10 x 11,050) N 110,500 Factory overhead N 88000 x 11050 44,200 44,200 22000 1 198,900 44,200 198,900 3.4 Raw Material Budget: The raw material budget shows the estimated quantities of all raw materials and components needed for the output demanded by the production budget.
The raw material budget serves the following purposes: • It assists the purchasing department in planning the purchases • It helps in the preparation ofpurchase budget • It provides data for raw material control It should be noted that raw material badget generally deals with only the direct materials.
The indirect materials are generally included in the overhead cost budget 3.5 Purchase Budget: Careful planning ofpurchases offer one of the most significant areas of cost saving in many concerns.
The purchase manager should be assigned the direct responsibility for preparing a detailed plan ofpurchases for the budget period and for submitting the plan in the form of a purchase budget.
These are planned purchases, to be made during the period to meet the needs of the business.
It indicates: • The quantities of each type of raw material and other items to be purchased; • The timing ofpurchases; and, • The estimated cost of material purchases.
Example 2 The Sales Manager ofJimmy Nig Ltd. reports that next year he expects to sell 50,000 units of a certain product: The Production Manager consults the Store Keeper and costs his figures as follows: Two kinds of raw materials A and B are required for manufacturing the product.
Each unit of the product requires 2 units ofA and 3 units of B.
The estimated opening balances at the commencement of the next year are — finished product — 10,000 units, A— 12,000 units and B — 15,000 units.
The desirable closing balances at the end of the next year are — Finished product — 14,000 units, A — 13,000 units and B — 16,000 mats You are required to draw up a quantitative chart to show the materials purchases budget for the next year.
Solution: Production Budget Unit Opening stock 10,000 Add: Production estimated (to be derived) 54,000 64,000 Less: Closing stock 14,000 Sales during the year 50,000 75  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Purchases Budget Material Material A B Dpening Stock 12000 15,000 Add Raw material purchased (To be derived) 109,000 163,000 121,000 178,000 Less Closing stock 13,000 16000 Consumption during the year A54,000 x 2 108,000 B 54,000x3 162,000 3.6 Labour Budget The labour budget represents the forecast of labour requirements to meet the demands of the company during the budget period.
This budget must be linked with production and production cost budget.
The labour budget serves the following purposes: • To estimate the labour cost of production.
• To determine the direct labour required in terms of labour hours and hence the number and grade of workers required to meet the production requirements.
• To provide data for managerial control of labour cost.
• To provide the personnel department with personnel requirements so that it may plan recruitment activities.
3.7 Production Overhead Budget The production overhead budget represents the forecast of all the production overheads to be incurred during the budget period.
The fact that overheads include many dissimilar types of expenses creates problems in: (a) The allocation ofproduction overheads to products manufactured, and (b) Control ofproduction overheads 3.8 Selling and Distribution Cost Budget: This is concerned with the sales budget and represents the forecast of all costs incurred in selling and distributing the company's products during the budget period.
As a general rule, the sales budgets and the selling and distribution cost are prepared simultaneously, since each has an impact on the other.
3.9 Administration Cost Budget This budget represents forecast of all administration expenses like directors' fees, managing directors' salary, office lighting, cooling and air — condition etc.
Most of these expenses are fixed within defined line, and should not be too difficult to forecast.
SQ, ),j0 Capital Expenditfire Budget This budget represents the estimated expenditure on all fixed assets during the budget period.
It includes such items as new buildings, machinery, land, and intangible items like patients etc.
3.11 Cash Budget: The cash budget is one of the most important and one of the last to be prepared.
It is a detailed estimate of cash receipts from all sources and cash payments for all purposes and the 76 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING resultant cash balances during the budget period.
It makes certain that the business has sufficient cash available to meet its needs as when these arise.
It is a device for coordinating and controlling the financial side ofthe business to ensure solvency and provide a basis for planning and financial requirement to cover up deficiency in cash.
Cash budget thus plays an important role in the financial management of a business undertaking.
The main purposes of cash budget are outlined below: • It ensures that sufficient cash is available when required • It indicates cash excesses and shortages.
So that action may be taken in time to invest any excess cash or to borrow finds to meet any shortages.
• It establishes a sound basis for credit.
• It shows whether capital expenditure may be financed internally.
• It establishes a sound basis for control of cash position FORMAT OFA CASH BUDGET PERIOD PERIOD PERIOD I 2 3 Opening cash balance b/f N N N Add: Receipts from debtors X X Sales of capital items X X Loans received X X X Proceeds from share issued X X X Dividend income X X Total CashAvailable XX icc XX Less: Payments to creditors XX Cash XX XX XX Wages and salaries (xx) Loans repayments (xx) (xx) (xx) Dividends (xx) (xx) (xx) Taxation (xx) (n) 04 Any other such disbursement (xx) (xxXxx) Closing cash balance If X X X 4.0 Conclusion.
Budgets and budgetary control have been demonstrated to be good tools in coordinating and controlling the financial and operational activities of a business organisation.

In this unit, we shall be discussing the various budgetary improvement techniques Safe developed to cover some of the weaknesses of the budgetary system.
2.0 Objective At the end of this unit, you are expected to be able to describe.
• Flexible budgeting • Continuous or rolling budgeting • Zero based budgeting • Planning programming budgetary system (PPBS) 3.1 Budgetary Improvement Techniques Some of the weaknesses of the budgetary system can be reduced to the minimum if some improvement techniques are incorporated into the orthodox budgetary system.
These techniques include: 3.1.1 Flexible Budgeting: This recognizes the existence of fixed, variable and semi—variable costs and it is designed to change in relation to the actual level of activity of a period.
Fixed budget on the other hand cannot be adjusted to the actual volume of output or level of activity attained in a period, which - would probably be different from the level of activity originally planned.
It should be noted that a fixed budget is essentially useful for planning purposes.
A flexible budget on the other hand is a more dynamic tool used for control purposes.
Students Assessment Exercise Differentiate between a fixed budget and a flexible budget.

Thus, a rolling budget is a device, which attempts to help an organization to overcome the problems resulting from frequent unexpected or unforeseeable activities or future cost.
A rolling budget is therefore an attempt to prepare targets and plans, which are more realistic and certain.
By shortening the period between preparing a budget annually, then there would be budgets every 2, 3, or 4 months.
Each of these budgets will plan for the next 12 months so that the current budget is extended by an extra period as the current period ends, hence the name continuous or rolling budget.
Suppose, for example, that a continuous budget is prepared every three months, the first three months will be prepared in great detail and the remaining nine months in lesser detail because of the greater uncertainty about the longer term future.
80 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUN77NG Illustration Assuming a three monthly rolling budget: Quarter 1.
Jan. 2000— March 2000 would be prepared in detail April 2000 — December 2000 would be prepared superficially Quarter 2.
Apri12000 - June 2000 would be prepared in detail July 2000 — March 2001 would be prepared superficially Quarter 3.
July 2000 — September 2000 would be prepared in detail October 2000 —June 2001 would be prepared superficially and so on and so forth.
3.1.2.1 Advantages of continuous Budget At all times, figures for the next twelve months are available and management is made continually to be aware of the budgetary process.
• Whereas as twelve months budget becomes outdated when there is a rapid inflation, a continuous budget system allows for more frequent re — assessment and revisions in the light of inflationary trend.
• Management is able to concentrate on a suitable management time span, which it can visualize and for which it can be fairly held responsible.
3.1.2.2 Disadvantages of Continuous Budget: • Higher cost and effort required for continuous budgeting • Each period, the whole procedure of preparing budget has to be undertaken.
It would be expected that company objectives and limiting factors will be more critically assessed on an annual basis than when the assessment is required twelve times or four times in a year.
• If the budget is built up from basic standard costs, there may be four changes each year in standard product cost assuming a three monthly rolling budget As a result, valuation of closing stock, pricing of materials issues etc.
would become more complex.
• How is the period to be covered decided?
Would it be for a quarter or a month?
Would the shorter period justify the extra work?
Students Assessment Exercise.
State the advantages and the disadvantages of a continuous budget 3.1.3 Zero Based Budgeting (Z.B.B) ZBB inifilies that the budget is started from a zero situation and justifies each segment of the budget rather than merely adding to historical budgets or actual budgets.
Conventionally, budgets are only queried when they show increases in expenditures over previous years.
In ZBB, there should be a possible attempt to eliminate inefficiency and slack fiom current expenditure.
ZBB was the brainchild of Peter A. Pyhrr.
He identified the following structured and systematic approach to budgeting based on ZBB.
• Organizations are divided into small sections known as decision units.
• Each decision unit is clearly defmed.
81  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING • For each activity, a decision package is defined for the minimum level of spending and this sets out the cost, the purpose of the activity, possible measures of perfonnance, consequences of not performing the activity, etc.
• Similar decision packages are defined for incremental allocations for alternative methods ofperforming the activities.
Decision packages are specified for alternative methods ofperforming the activities • The decision packages are ranked • Resources are allocated and a budget formulated from the priorities that have been identified • The actual usage of resources and the actual performance of the decision units are monitored as it is with other budgeting systems; deviations from budgets are investigated where significant and appropriate actions taken.
A decision package is really the foundation of the ZBB system, Phy-rr defines it as a document that identifies and describes a specific activity in such a manner that management can: • Evaluate it and rank it against other activities competing for the same or similar limited resources.
• Decide whether to approve it or disapprove it.
3.1.3.1.
Advantages of ZBB • Efficient allocation of scarce resources, and inefficiencies, which are perpetuated by the incremental approach to budgeting are avoided.
• Cost reduction may also be effected.
• Management attention is focused on activities, which warrant action.
• Activities are evaluated and justified.
• Performances of managers can be more effectively monitored • Management cooperation and involvement is stimulated 3.1.3.2 Disadvantages of ZBB • Extra paper works are created by the decision packages •••• ZBB is more applicable to only discretionary cost items.
Such as research and development training etc.
• Completely ignoring the present state and the past may induce assumptions impossible to achieve • Initial cost associated with re—organization and employee education could be prohibitive.
• It encourages the false idea that all decisions have to be made in the budget.
Management must be able to meet unforeseen opportunities and threats at all times and must not feel restricted from carrying out new ideas simply because they were 'nit approved by decision package cost/benefits ranking analysis.
Students Assessment Exercise Describe the systematic approach to budgeting based on ZBB 82  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.1.4.
Planning and Programming Budgeting System (PPBS) PPBS is constructed on a few basic concepts which need definition before hand.
They are: • Objectives • Programmes • Resources • Effectiveness 3.1.4.1 Objectives These are the organizations aims or purpose, which collectively define its main reason for existence.
3.1.4.2.
Programmes These are the set of activities undertaken to accomplish the objectives 3.1.4.3.
Resources Resources are the goods and services consumed by programme activities.
They may be thought of as equipment, materials and men requited to produce each programmes end — product Programme cost is the monetary value of resources identified with a programme.
3.1.4.4 Effectiveness Effectiveness is a measure of the degree to which programmes accomplish objectives.
3.1.5 Features of P.P.B.
System •••• The planning phase ofthe PPBS is concerned with idaitifying and defining objectives.
•••• "Programming"then groups the organizations activities into programmes that can be related to each objective.
This requires grouping by end — product rather than by administrative or by fiurtion.
This grouping then enables us to look at what we want to produce and the resources we require to produce them.
•••• The programme budget presents resources and costs categorized according to the programme or end —product to which they relate.
This contrasts with the traditional budget, which assembles costs by the type of resource input or by finictions.
The advantage ofthis restructuring ofbudget information is that it aids by fly:using attention on competition for resources among programmes and on the effectiveness of resources used within programmes.
•••• PPBS requires a long term planning which covers at least five years and where appropriate should extend to ten, fifteen or more years into the fiaure.
This is intended to enable all costs and benefits of programme decisions to be realized within the planning period.
•••• Comparability rather than accuracy is the main consideration in the analysis of programme costs and benefits.
In addition, aggregate and not detailed data should generally be used in cost and benefit analysis Planning, not forecasting, is the purpose of PPBS.
The aim is to examine the costs and benefits for the future, of alternative courses of action.
• Capital and operating cost implications of programmes are looked at together and not separately as in the traditional budget practice.
83  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Students Assessment Exercise Enumerate the main features of the PPBS.
4.0 Conclusion In this unit, we have attempted to demonstrate that most of the short comings ofthe traditional budgeting control system can be overcome by the budgetary control improvement techniques.
5.0 Summary From this unit, you should have been able to describe the features, advantages and disadvantages of the budgetary improvement techniques.

This is unit 17 ofthis course Management Accounting, and it will cover a period of one hour.
In this unit, we shall be looking at performance evaluation in a decentralized organization.
2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit, you should be able to • Describe the different levels ofdecision making • Define centralization • Describe the advantages and disadvantages of divisionalization.
3.1 Levels of decision-making Management at all levels makes decisions.
The levels of decision-making in an organization am: •••• Strategic •••• Tactical •••• Operational 85  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.1.1.
Strategic level The board ofdirectors will have jurisdiction on decision bothering on the following: • Diversification of the company's product • Acquisition of a subsidiary • Appointment of top executives • Specified areas of capital expenditure acquisition and disposal.
• Raising of finance and investment of surplus fund • Determination ofoverall objectives • Specification of areas of research and development • Centralized services and activities e.g.
legal services and projection ofoverall image via press etc.
• Monitoring of overall objectives • Product line closure or departmental closure decisions • Arbitration decisions if transfer pricing between divisions is involved • Company sourcing decisions: where more than one division use the same raw materials components, part etc.
corporate interests may be best served by making this a strategic activity 3.1.2 Tactical Level Divisional managers, production controllers, sales managers etc.
will have jurisdiction of decisions bordering on the following: • Advertising campaign • Product selection • Appointment and dismissal ofjunior and intermediate staff • Transfer pricing decisions excluding arbitrary transfer method imposed by central management • Production methods • Plant replacements and disinvestments — although with some constraints e.g.
all such items with a maximum limit of say N100, 000 • Purchasing management • Short — term operational decisions, such as sub — contracting work, over-time working, productivity standard setting etc.
• Guaranteeing or suspension of credit to customers.
3.1.3.
Operational level Credit supervisors, work foremen etc., will have jurisdiction on decision bordering on the following Maintenance or suspension of deliveries of bad customers • Selection of men to deal with a particular job etc.
3.2 Importance of organizational structure in decision-making: Where there is no organizational structure, there will be no distinction between the different levels ofdecision-making, and all decisions will be made at just one point close to the top management and this is absolute centralization.
On the other hand, where there is a highly structured organization and no decision is taken at the strategic level but the bulk is passed down the ladder, then we talk of absolute decentralization.
86  AMA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.3 Centrafization Centralization is the tendency to restrict delegation of decision-making in an organisation, usually by holding it at the top of the organisation structure i.e.
at the strategic level.
3.4 Decentralization Decentralization on the other hand is the tendency to disperse decision-making authority in an organization structure i.e.
freedom is granted to subordinate officers to take decision.
Absolute centralization in one person is conceivable but it implies that there are no subordinate managers and therefore no structural organization.
Consequently, it can be said that some decentralization characterizes all organizations.
On the other hand; there cannot be absolute decentralization, for if managers should delegate all their authority, then their status as managers would cease, their positions would be eliminated and there would, again be no organizations.
3.5 Divisionalization A division is an investment center with responsibility for production, purchasing and marketing and whose head is given a degree of discretion as to what product to produce and sell, and at what price, what manufacturing operations to perform, what sales areas to serve, and what research to be undertaken.
Divisionalization involves the delegation of decision making powers to divisional heads and hence the divisions achieving some degree of autonomy.
A divisionalized company therefore, is one whose organisation and operations are segmented into semi — autonomous units, and each with a large degree of responsibility for decision making within its respective unit.
- Student Assessment Exercise IdentifY the different bases of cfivisionalization in an organization.
3.5.1.
Advantages of Divisionalization Better decisions As the business grows in size of activities and personnel, the ability of an organization to make decisions effectively and quickly is reduced by its chain of command and span of control.
But by splitting the organization into smaller and more manageable units, the quality of decision- making and management is improved.
Top management work over — load is also reduced so that they can focus their attention on strategic areas.
Cope better with changes: .
When a business operates in a stable'environment, e.g.
a stable sales market and:a Stable cost structure, many decisions can be made centrally at the planning stage.
Management will normally find it unnecessary to respond speedily to unpredictable problems, whatopaating in a more turbulent environment, e.g.
active competition, cost inflation, employee strikes etc.
Decisions cannot be predetermined at the planning stage.
Local management, more finning with , the problems (and better access to data) will be able to make correct and responsive decisions than central management.
87  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Training: Through delegation of authority, subordinate are being groomed and trained for higher-level responsibilities.
Motivation: By assigning the responsibility of a division performance to, its management, there will be an improverhent in its performance.
This accords with the behavioural theory ofHerzberg in which responsibility is viewed as a "motivator" The opportunity for freedom from programmed decisions and detailed central control will clearly appeal to managers in large companies.
33,2 Disadvantages of Divisionalization Increase in cost: Activities which are common to divisions can be more effectively centralized to save costs through economies ofscale e.g costs &running purchasing departments and billing bulk purchasing savings.
Duplication ofactivities is required to effect a divisionalized structure, along with the costs of running a head office activity Goal Congruence, dysfunctional behaviour and loss of control: When decisions are made centrally, their consistence with corporate objectives is more easily controlled.
Within a divisionalized structure, divisional management is given freedom to decide (both correctly and incorrectly) and hence its decisions may not be congruent with the corporate goals.
This is the goal congruence problem.
Top management at the center will lose some degree occontrol if autonomy is assigned to divisional management.
This is the autonomy and control conflict.
Design of control System: To report on divisional managements decision-making and performance, an effective method of control will need to operate.
Problems of design of divisional profit measure, methods of measuring performance of divisional managers and the cost of operating the system need to be considered.
Students Assessment Exercise: List the advantages and disadvantages of divisionalization in a divisionahzed organization.
3.6 Management Accounting Problems of a Divisionalized organisation Divisionalized organization Infra — company transactions: Where one division is concerned with ensuring goods or services from another division, problems will arise in pricing such transactions.
The management accountant will be actively concerned in ensuring: -That the pricing system does not act to the detriment of the company's interest.
-That the transfer prices are fair to both parties -That the negotiation and administration involved in transfer pricing are not disproportionate to the benefit from maintaining autonomous divisions.
Apportionments: Establishment of separate divisions usually involves apportionment and allocation ofcommon cost and/or assets.
The management accountant will aim at making such apportionments as equitable as possible.
88  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Division's result may be materially affected by costs, which are outside the responsibility of the divisional manager Such costs need to be identified for meaningful performance report5. '
- Designing effective control systems: There is the problem of communication depending on the degree of decentralization.
There is also the problem of determining the form, content and periodicity of preparation of operating and budget statement; ippropriate to the different levels of management There should be general coordination between the units and the implementation of appropriate procedure to ensure as far as possible, uniformity in the classification and application ofcosts.
• Evaluation of results: There is the problem of the appropriate technique to apply in evaluating the performance of the divisions.
Students Assessment Exercise What are the management accounting problems of setting up a divisionalized organisation?
4.0 Conclusion In this unit, we have been able to demonstrate that divisionalization is desirable to a large organization for better planning, control and decision making but that at the same time, the attendant problems associated with divisionalization should be taken into consideration when designing a divisional system.
5.0 Summary In this unit, we have been able to describe the different levels of decision-making, define centralization, describe divisionalization and the advantages and disadvantages involved in cfivisionalization.

We shall continue our discussion on performance evaluation in a divisionalized organisation.
2.0 Objectives: At the end ofthis unit, you should be able to: • Define responsibility accounting • State the objectives of responsibility accounting • Describe the features of responsibility accounting • Describe the types of responsibility centers • Measure the performance of responsibility centers 3.1 Definition of Responsibility Accounting - Responsibility accounting is a system, which recognizes decision centers in an organisation and traces costs and revenues to the individual managers who are primarily responsible far making decisions about these costs and revenues.
3.2 Objectives of Responsibility Accounting: The objectives of responsibility accounting are two fold: • To state the overall plan or goal of the organisation in concrete terms and to assign rbsponsibility for attaining the goal and sub — goals.
• To serve as a monitoring device during execution of the plan 90 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.3 Features of the Responsibility Accounting system.
The areas involved in the application of the principles are: • The determination of responsibility for each activity carried on in the enterprise and the assigning of each item of income, expense and other expenditures accordingly.
• Definition of the kind and amount of data each manager need and the reflection of these in accounting and statistical-classification .
• The use of nnabagement report to convey the data to those who will use and at the time they want it • Planning and budgeting practices made frilly compatible with the reports.
• The setting up of measures of performance to be incorporated in the reports and budget.
•••• 3.4 Types o rfesponsibility centers Three types of responsibility centers can be identified, namely: 3.4.1 Cost center: This is a department or section or function over which a designated individual has responsibility for expenditure.
Cost centers are relatively simple and consist mainly of locations at which costs can be separately identified and collected.
They are mostly used for cost control and can consist of a single person or machine.
Provided that a cost number or job number is allocated, costs can be assigned thereto and separately recorded.
For interdepartmental performance comparison, ti unit of measurement of output is normally required although in its absence, the absoluteiotal cost cah be compared.
It is necessary for each cost center to separate those costs that are directly controllable and accountable by the person responsible and those costs, which may be apportioned or allocated to the center e.g.
computer costs, canteen expenses etc.
Another problem of cost center isthe diffioulty of identifying specific output levels to the cost incurred.. 3.4.2 Profit Center This is a segment ofa business entity by which both revenue and expenditures are controlled and accounted forit thus differs from a cost center in that the revenue also is accumulated and thereby a profit or loss is established within the given segment.
The prime need is for there to be an 'ability to segregate a definable amount of sales generated by the particular segment.
The person responsible for a profit center should have control over both the sales policy and the production facilities i.e.
authority commensurate with responsibility 3.4.2.1 Problems of Establishing a Profit Center: - Segregation of sales by product lines of customers who take several products, and of identifying individual sales, if all invoicing is done by the national head office.
•••• Pricing of inter—departmental transfers when components or products are supplied between profit centers.
On the cost side, there would be the need to allocate, apportion and absorb corporate advertising, research and developmental expense and general administrative costs.
91  MBA if 9: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.4.3 investment Center: This is a profit center controlling revenue and costs but which in addition, the profit is related to the assets employed in earning the profit i.e.
returns are compared to investment.
The prime need is the identification of the assets employed in the particular business segment or product line.
Many assets may be in common use by several profit centers for example, factory- building, utilities, transport, materials and tools stores.
Investment centers are likely to be larger than profit centers.
An investment center may comprise several profit centers having control at a higher stage in the management structure.
3.4.3.1.
Difficulties involved in the Establishment of Investment Centers: • The necessity to allocate all fixed assets in use.
• Difficulty in establishing a base to relate profit for interdepartmental comparison, whether the fixed assets should be stated at cost, at written down value or at replacement value.
• How would joint assets be allocated e.g.
boiler plants canteen and sports facilities?
• Would assets include idle plant and incomplete construction?
• In making comparisons, would all segments be expected to make the same return on whatever asset base is chosen?
It is instructive to note that, -while all investment centers are profit centers, not all profit centers are investment centers.
Divisions in a divisionalized organization are invariably investment centers.
3.5 Measures of Divisional Performance: 3.5.1 Absolute Divisional Profit: This is the profit that arises from divisional operations.
The profit achieved would be compared against a budget or target and variances in volume, prices and rate of expenditure would be brought under review.
It is likely, since a division is not a completely independent business, that some cost will be charged to the division in respect of goods or services provided by other segments of the enterprise.
Some of these would be required by the divisional manager and will be charged at" arms length" prices.
Others, however, will be apportionments of costs over which the divisional manager may have no control in the short term.
For the purpose of judging the manager personal achievement, a" controllable profit" figure may be used prior to charging these "non — controllable costs".
The main problem in using controllable profit is that it will encourage divisional managers to adopt a short run view ofobjectives, which the group may find inconsistent with the level of investment.
Local managers may treat fixed assets as free goods and concentrate on maximizing the short —term return at the expense of the longer term efficiency of the assets.
This could have implications for expenditure on repairs and maintenance.
The largest technical problem would be the isolation of controllable overloads.
Other definitions of profits are: 3.5.1.1.
Net Profit: This is revenue less divisional costs and apportioned head office costs.
The divisional , manager is made aware of the fill cost of operating his division.
3.5.1.2 Direct profit.
This is revenue less direct cost of the division.
The problem ofapportioning head office costs to the division is avoided.
Certain costs which are however directly traceable to the division, may not be controllable at that level e.g.
divisional manager's salary.
92 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.5.13.
Controllable Profit.
This is revenue less costs controllable at the divisional level.
The measure comprises only costs and revenue for which the divisional manager has primary responsibility It should be noted that fixed costs mien be controllable because they are, by definition, fixed in relation to activity and not in amount e.g.
supervisor's salary.
If an expenditure on fixed assets is decided on by head office management, depreciation charges on these assets will not be included in arriving at controllable profit.
3.5.1.4 Controllable Residual Profit/Income •This is revenue less divisional controllable costs and interest imputed on the investment controllable by the divisional manager.
Here, the level of investment is assumed to be the responsibility ofthe divisional manager The difference between controllable profit and controllable residual profit is interest, which is imputed at the company's cost of capital on the amount of investment in the division.
151.5 Net Residual Profit/bicome This is revenue less total divisional costs, including imputed interest on the divisional investment and apportioned head office costs.
This measure evaluates the investment in the division rather than the performance of the manager.
33.2 Returns on Capital Employed (ROCE) ROCE is an all —embracing ratio that relates net income to the level ofinvestments.
The ratio is given as: Net Income x 100 Sales 1 It can be sub — analyzed as: Profit percentage = Net income x 100 Sales 1 Asset turnover = Sales Investmart 33.2.1 Advantages of ROCE • The data input is compatible with infomiatiOn contained in conventional financial reports and this facilitates easy interpretation of the ratio by managers • Because the R.00E ratio can be sub-divided into a series of explanatory ratios, it is a useful analytical device for examining various aipects of performance.
• It gives consideration to capital base ofeach division thereby regarding them as autonomous investment units.
2.2 Disadvantages of ROCE: • Definitions ofprofit are subject to accounting policies and the consistency in the application ofthe policies.
Particular problems will arise in relation to: • Allocation ofcentral overheads 93  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING • Effects of taxation • Depreciation • Similar to the problems ofprofit, definitions are those ofdetermining the investment base.
Various investment bases are 0 Net book value 0 Gross book value 0 Current value • Maximising return on investment may lead divisional managers to disregard the interest of the organization as a whole and select projects, which will simply increase the divisional ROCE • Although a single rate of ROCE would normally be calculated on the overall financial results of the business, it is important to recognize that individual projects or business activities may be achieving returns which are significantly different from the average.
• ROCE may not properly reflect the company's goals because it ignores non- monetary objectives namely.
• The employees growth in managerial skills • Social responsibilities of the company The different divisions engage in different activities and some lines of business generally yield higher returns than others.
To this extent, using ROCE may perpetuate some divisions as "leaders" because of the peculiarities of their business, e.g.
the rate of return for companies in capital equipment and cOnstruction is lower than that of companies selling to the consumer market.
3.5.3 Residual Income: Divisional residual income is divisional profit less an imputed charge on the net assets employed by the division.
The rate of interest will normally be the required pre — tax rate of return of the enterprise as a whole, so that any residual income will indicate earnings in excess of the normal rate of return.
Using residual profit as a performance measure assumes that the level of divisional investment is a responsibility of divisional management.
This should be contrasted with the view taken when.
absolute profit is used as a performance measure, that the investment level is a central strategic responsibility.
It combines the qualities of born an absolute and a relative measure.
A positive residual income demonstrates that the required ROCE has been exceeded and measures the excess in absolute income terms.
A numerical example will demonstrate the use of residual ineome as the performance measure will ensure that goal congruence between the division and the company IS achieved.
StudentsAssessment Exercise: A division currently has net income ofN200, 000 per annum generated from an investment base ofN1 million.
The company requires a minimum return on capital employed of 15%.
Anew project being considered by the division will entail additional investment ofN100, 000 and will yield annual net income of N1 7, 000.
You are required to evaluate the project using both ROCE and residual income.
94  MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING MBA 719): Solution Existing position Position on acceptance of project N Net income 200,000 217,000 Investment 1,000,000 1,100,000 20% 19.73% ROCE Decision: Because the ROCE falls, the project will be rejected (b) RESIDUAL INCOME APPROACH es income 200,000 217,000 !e4 iinces1 A50,000 165,000 so,000 52,000 Decision : Because residual income has risen by N2000, the project willbe accepted.
3.5.1.1.
Advantages of Residual Income Residual income represents the total surplus of a division after all costs.
Divisional management that maximizes residual income will behave consistently with the weal.dtpR;imisiN Roa.
cotpotate objectives rather than when they maximize Residual income therefore promotes goal cPngnidleY.
• - * Resiauai income performance measures are reconcilable to techniques such as net present value (NPV) and internal rate of returns (IRR).
3:5.32 Disadvantages of Residual Income: Although central trtanagement may hire the idea of inputing a cost to the &titian kir uSe of local assets, they may not faVoutthe assumption on investirient powers contained within the residual income approach.
Another disadvantage is that * The tliaultips of estimatingthe fum'scostofcapital Students Assessment Exercise A division has assets ofN2, 000,000 and operating income ofN600, (a) What is the division's ROCE?
(b) If interest is inputted at 14%, what is the residual income?
(d) What effects on management behaviour can be expected if ROCE is used to measure performance?
(e) What effects on management behaviour can be expected if residual income is used to measure performance?
95  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING Solution (a) ROCE = Income x 100 Investment 1 N 600,000 x 100 N2, 000,000 1 30% (b) Residual Income Operating income less interest on capital employed • N600, 000— (14% of N2,000,000) • N600, 000 - N 280,000 • N320, 000 (c) If ROCE is used, the management is prone to reject projects that do not earn a return on investment of at least 30%.
From the point of view of the organization as a whole, this position may be undesirable because its best investment opportunities may lie in that division at a hurdle rate of, say 20%.
If a division is enjoying a high ROCE, it is less likely to expand if it is judged by ROCE than if it is judged by residual income.
The reason being that its investment base will be expanding i.e.
the denominator to which income is related will be growing while income is expected to be stagnant or just increase marginally at the early stage of the new investment.
(d) If residual income is used, the management is inclined to accept all projects whose expected ROCE exceeds the minimum desired rate.
4.0 Conclusion We have been able to demonstrate that divisional ization is desirable and that responsibilities must be commensurate with authority and that management of a division should be made accountable for all Costs and revenues in their division.
5.0 Summary In this unit, we have been able to define responsibility accounting, to state the objectives of responsibility accounting, describe the features of responsibility accounting, describe the type of responsibility accounting and measurement ofresponsibility accounting.

2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Describe the essence of transfer pricing in divisionalized organization • State the objectives of transfer pricing systems • Describe the various transfer pricing methods 3.1 Introduction to Transfer Pricing Systems: In a large decentralized organization where internal transfer of goods and services occur, it would be necessary to attach monetary values to such exchanges and to evaluate the separate performances of the divisions or departments involved.
Transfer pricing is therefore the process of determining, reporting and acting on the imputed values of goods and services exchanged between divisions.
It should be realized that a company cannot make a profit by selling to itself, hence these internal sales between divisions are regarded as "transfer" and the prices at which such "transfers" are made are known as "transfer prices" To avoid transfer-pricing problem of arbitrary pricing between divisions, and for the purpose of optimal decision making by the various divisional management, the central management should properly define a transfer pricing policy to be used on a consistent basis by all the divisions within the decentralized organization.
Students Assessment Exercise: State the need for a transfer pricing system in a decentralized organization.

, 2 E. , o9-  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.3.1.1 Advantages of Cost Based Transfer Pricing method: • It is very useful for optimal decision-making purposes especially the variable cost variant whenever there is an excess capacity in the selling division.
• The computation of closing stock value is not problematic whenever group accounts are being prepared as there wouldn't be any unrealized profit on stock • A transfer price could be fixed and agreed in advance without being subject to external fluctuation especially when the standard cost variant is used.
• It offers the only available option when there is no market • Prices can easily be obtained from the costing system.
3.3.1.2 Disadvantages of Cost Based Transfer Pricing Method: • It may lead to an unpredictable monthly fluctuation unless the standard cost variant is used.
• Cost of the selling division may be rejected on the ground that it is inefficient especially when the fill cost variant is used • When transfer is made at cost plus mark—up, the selling division is guaranteed a certain percentage ofprofit and this may encourage inefficiency to be perpetrated for a long time.
• It treats the divisions as cost centers rather than profit or investment centers.
Therefore, measures such as ROCE and residual income cannot be used for evaluation purposes.
3.3.2 Market Based Transfer Pricing Method: This is the transfer price at which an outside competitor would be prepared to supply the same product In other words, both the buying and selling divisions would be operating at arms length i.e.
as if they are not members of the same group.
3.3.2.1 Advantages of Market Rued Transfer Pricing method: • There is goal congruence as any decision taken by divisional management using market based transfer pricing method would not only be in the interest of the division but also that ofthe whole organization as well.
• Divisional autonomy is maintained • It is most adequate for measuring performance and motivating managers • Market prices are objective and verifiable • There would be no controversy as to the efficiency or inefficiency of the selling division.
3.3.2.2 Disadvantages of Market Based Transfer Pricing Method.
•••• The element ofinters—group profit could complicate stock valuation when group accounts are being prepared.
• Accurate information about the market price may not be readily available.
• The use ofmarket price may act as a disincentive especially in the selling division whenever there are excess capacities even though the variable cost variant could have been desirable for use in that situation.
100 MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING 3.3.3 Negotiated Transfer Pricing Method Under this method, the selling and the buying divisions agree to use a mutually acceptable Price.
3.3.3.1 Advantages of Negotiated Pricing method: • The motivation impact is always stronger because it gives managers a high degree of control and involvement when prices are set.
• There would be fewer disputes on transfer prices because many factors would have been considered, such as the full and variable production cost, market prices etc.
3.3.3.2 Disadvantages of Negotiated Transfer pricing method: • Negotiation process may be time consuming • The negotiated price may be influenced by the negotiating abilities, personality and fluency of the managers.
• The group interest may be subordinated to individual interest.
3.3A.
Arbitrary Transfer Pricing method: Under this method, transfer prices are determined centrally based on what top management believes is most beneficial to the whole group.
Individual division may have some contribution but no control over prices actually set.
3.3.4.1 Advantages of Arbitrary Transfer Pricing method: • Time consuming negotiations are saved • Uniformity and stability tend to prevail.
3.3.4.2 Disadvantages of Arbitrary Transfer Pricing Method: • Profit and cost consciousness may suffer where arbitrarily fixed price is not considered realistic.
• It crodes part of the independence normally desirable for autonomous divisions.
Students Assessment Exercise: Discuss the best transfer pricing policy for divisionalized organization 4.0 Conclusion We have been able to bring out the fact that any transfer pricing method must be able to satisfy the criteria of goal congruence, autonomy of divisions and performance measure for it to be totally acceptable to divisional managements.
5.0 Summary In this unit, you should by now be able to describe the essence of transfer pricing in divisionalized organizations, state the objectives oftransfer pricing systems, and describe the various transfer pricing methods.

PLC; an aluminum manufacturing company, has three autonomous divisions, X, Y, and Z.
Division X is responsible formanufacturing aluminum flat sheets which become the raw materials for Division Y. from the flat sheets, Division Y makes aluminum windows and doors.
Division Z is responsible for marketing the entire company's final products.
The company's management finds that the divisions should be evaluated as separated profit center and should be credited with an equitable share of contributions.
The company's transfer pricing policy stipulates that proportionate efforts are to be measured by the ratio of the division's variable cost to the total variable cost of the centers.
A budgeted sale for 1996 is N25m with total variable cost of N15m for the centers.
The details of the variable end fixed costs by the divisions are given as frollows: X Y N N N Variable cost 4,500.000 3,000,000 7,500,000 Fixed costs 2,500,000 1,500,000 2,000,000 7,000,000 4,5130,000 9,500,000 You are required to detennine budgeted transfer values using the agreed pricing method: 102  MBA 719: MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING': UNIT 20: STANDARD COSTING TECHNIQUE AND VARIANCEANALYSIS Table of content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Definition of standard costing 3.2.

This is.unit,20 oldierause ManagementAccouting, and it is for durationefonehohr.
In, ' - thisunit, we shall be looking at standard costing technique.
2.0 Objectives Atthe end of this unit you should be able to: * Define standard costing and variance analysis * Describe types of * State tbe advanta,gesand disadvantagesof standardtostitig _• Describe cost control by means of State the possible causes of variances Gain background knowledge ofthe material and labour variances 3.1 Definition of standard costing.
The technique known as standard costing consists ofpratenniued estimate of coitsanit the comparison of this with actual cost as they are incuned.
The difference between the actual cost and standard cost is termed variance.
Variance analysis is used to attribute Variances to the Various causes.
The Chartered Institute ofManagement Accountants in its official terminologies define stafidatt1 cost as 4 a predetennined cost of how much costs should be under specified wodc and condlitions" VarianceAnalysitc, A variancd according td our discussions is the difference between standard 'cost and 'actual: cost.
Varimice analysis therefore is the process whereby the difference between standard cost and actual cost is sub-analyzed into their constituent parts.
103  MBA 719: MANAGEMEIV7' AND ACCOUNTING I 3.3 Types of standard: 3.3.1 Basic Standards: This is defined by the CINIA as a standard established for use over a long period from which a current standard can be developed.
They are established for use unaltered over the years.
3.3.2.
Ideal Standards: This is a standard which can be attained under the most favourable conditions i.e.

It is essential that all factors be considered in the determination of standards e.g.
quantities, prices, rates, quality and grades.
To be effective for analysis and control purposes, standards are only fixed for a certain period e.g.
six months or a year.
When changes in economic conditions occur, it is necessary to revise the standards e.g.
wage increases material price increases.
3.4.2 Cost control by means of standards: In a manufacturing concern, the following steps should be taken when a standard cost system is aPPlied- • Detennine standards for each cost element (material, labour and manufacturing ovaheads) • Obtain actual results • Compare actual and standard cost to determine variances • State favourable and unfavourable variances on a variance report, and deal with them immediately • Pinpoint responsibility for variances and obtain explanations • Take corrective actions 3.5 Advantages of standard costing: • Standard costing serves as a criterion against which actual costs can be measured • Analysis of variances necessitates regular control ofthe entire production process • Use of standard costing reduces clerical work • Interpretation ofreports by management is simplified and requires less time • Standard costing provides better control over costs.
The objective is always to imptDve work performance and material consumption.
• In order to establish standards, an extensive study of all facets of the organisation is • required.
Production and price policy can be formulated before starting operations • When standards have been established, they can serve as a basis for further planning, which may lead to greater efficiency.
• It is useful in motivating employees and achieving labour efficiency.
• It is useful in setting prices in advance, mostly in making tender.

It may be expensive ancl rime consuming to install and maintain the system.
hi an inflationary period or improving technological environment, standards quickly become obsolete and consequently lose their control and motivational effects.
Students Assessment Exercise (a) Define the term "standard costing" (b) State the-factors that are taken into account in the determination of standards (e) What steps are taken to control costs by means of standard.
(d) Lit five advantages and two disadvantages of standard.
3.7 Material variances - 3.7.1 Elements The total cost ofmaterial consumed in orpurchases for manufacturing process are determined by two basic elements.
• The unit price paid for the material and • The quantity of material consumed or applied.
The total variance between the standard and the actual material cost can be broken down into these two elements Where more than one type of material is used, a third variance is possible namely the variance between the standard rnix and the actual mix.
3.7.2 Material price variance: Thepurchasesdepartroent isconeemedwiththe determination ofstandatd prices: itl forecasting average prices, due consideration must be given to large-scale purchases, market conditions, diseoutts and storage casts.
•The standard price is used as a norm.
If the actual price exceeds the standard price, the variance is unfavourable.
If the actual price is less than thestandard price, the variance is favourable 3.7.3 Causes of material price variance: • Favourable or unfavourable tenns of purchase cartracts • Unforeseen changes in market prices • Higher or lower delivery cost& • Erroneous calculation of expected discounts Pooptiming ofpurchases.
3.7.4 Material quantity variance The standard typeand quantity ofmaterial necessary to be converted into a finished product must be &tented.
Provisions must be made for unavoidable waste, spillage or usages during the production process.
The design departure* in claw cooperation with the factory staff must determine the 9,51ndapi Material cp.uunity specifications, which serve as the basis for determining the standard quantity in manufacturing a completed unit.
The standard quantity is used as the nom If the actual quantity is more than thestandard quantity, the variance is unfavourable, and vice -- versa.
17.5 Causes of material quantity variances.
•••• l'he use Of a different grade or substitute material • Improper or pact Control over spillage and wastage ofmaterial • Efficient or inefficient performance due to supervision, type of equipment, ability of workers etc.
