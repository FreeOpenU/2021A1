The origin of cyber technology on which web applications operate is the Internet.
The Internet is a network that links millions of computers around the world.
It is an interconnection of various networks across the globe.
The Internet started not quite long ago, but now it has become a viable tool for every progressive mind in research, business, commerce, industries, communications, manufacturing etc.
It is useful to all categories of people irrespective of interest or profession – engineers, scientists, pilots, philosophers, pastors and Islamic scholars to mention just a few.
The Internet has revolutionised how people use computers in home, business, at work, on journey, at leisure etc.
Many people depend on it daily to communicate with others, do business transactions, play games and watch movies, get the information they need and many others.
1  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the concept of the Internet • describe an overview of the structure of the Internet • explain some basic tools use on the Internet • list and explain what the Internet can be used for • describe how to look for information on the Internet.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Overview of the Internet Actually, a network is two or more computers connected together, and an Internet work is a heap of networks connected to other networks so that all computers on the entire individual network can exchange data over the large interconnecting network.
Computers don’t connect directly to the Internet, but to a network that connects other to other through a network backbone.
Interconnection between these backbones makes it possible for a computer on one network to exchange messages and data with another connected to any other network in the cyberspace.
Figure 1 is a simplified diagram of the Internet’s interconnected backbones.
A set of networking protocols that controls the Internet is known as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
The specifications for TCP/IP include the addressing schemes that identify each computer on the Internet and the rules for several kinds of programmes.
The first thing needed to access the Internet is the Internet account.
It takes the form of provision of an access point to the Net.
This account is secured through an Internet Provider (IP).
These are people who supply telecommunication services.
If an organisation has an Internet connection, a block of addresses with the Internet authorities are provided to that organisation.
User is allowed to use the node by assigning a number to his computer, such as 158.129.24.21.
This number is the address of the computer on the Internet.
Once the address has been assigned, the computer becomes a network node.
This can then access a TCP/IP network in a bunch of computers hooked together with cable or modems or wave or satellite, using TCP/IP protocols.
One of the most important features of the Internet is that, it is not limited to a specific type of computer or operating system.
TCP/IP can run on 2  MBE 817 MODULE 1 all kinds of computers built in the last 30 years.
It always presents the same appearance to the network regardless of the computer on which they are operating.

1: Interconnected System Networks 3.2 History of the Internet The Internet was created by the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
It aimed at bringing together scientific minds to research and develop technology that would enable America to stay ahead of the Cold War.
In the early 1960s, an idea was conceived to have a network of computer that can withstand partial cable outages from military attacks in strategic places.
In 1964, RAND Corporation came up with an open suggestion to have computer network that could not be destroyed by nuclear war.
To accomplish this task, Bob Taylor launched ARPA by setting up a number of research projects at American universities, and came up with the idea of ARPAnet.
This became the very first trans-national network.
It was to link scientific researchers together.
Paul Baran used the technology to transfer data in the early sixties.
Baran developed the first packet switching techniques which were incorporated into the Wide Area Network WAN technology.
The first test of Network Control Protocol (NCP) was carried out at the Britain Physical Laboratory in 1968, and was successful enough to convince the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Project Agency to install the first node in 1969, creating ARPAnet.
NCP was later superseded by TCP/IP.
3  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT ARPAnet was implemented on DECPDP-10 computers.
Messages and data handling were carried out using separate minicomputers called Terminal Interface Processors (TIPs).
TIPs were linked together over a lease telephone connection.
The first nodes connected were the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Stanford Research Institute, and the University of Utah.
By 1973, the ARPAnet had become a national network, but it was restricted to universities, research institutes and defence contractors.
It became a wonderful technology, with a major flaw of lack of security.
Students who had access to a terminal connected to the TIPs spent hours in front of the screen; electronic mail was the topmost priorities of the users rather than the intended scientific research.
This resulted in the emergence of social structure on the Internet.
By 1975, ARPAnet was turned over to the Defence Communication Agency, which was dedicated mainly to overseeing the military and government radio and data traffic.
The security on the net was improved upon a little.
Only 256 sites could be connected at a time because the ARPAnet was limited to 8-bite addressing techniques.
By 1982 there had been a tremendous improvement of the addressing techniques and thousands of networks could be connected – this is the emergence of the true Internet as a result of the introduction of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
In 1983, about 200 computers have been connected and have Internet usage.
In 1986, National Science Foundation (NSF) created one computer network called NSFnet which connected five super computer centres for academic purposes.
In 1989, World Wide Web (www) was launched by Tim Berners-Lee.
This really advanced the course of the Internet usage.
The growth has been on the increase of 100% yearly since then.
1993, the first graphical user interface web browser – Mosaic - was launched by the National Centre for Supercomputing in the University of Illinois.
In 1995, more than 2 million computers were connected to the Internet.
Today the Internet technology transcends research institutes, institutions of learning, government agencies and parastatals.
The Internet has dropped to the level of being afforded by individual and also by small and larger business organisations.
It was initially meant for 4  MBE 817 MODULE 1 communication and data generated and sustained by research projects.
Later it was saturated by electronic mails.
Now, the explosion of the Net not only allows communication and textual messages and data but also allows business data, video games and other multimedia tools.
By June 2007, about 1.33 billion people use the Internet for different activities.
SELF - ASSESSMENT EXERCISE i.
What was the major reason for the evolution of the Internet?
ii.
List the major developmental stages of the Internet.
3.3 Client/Server Interactions on the Internet In most cases, the programs and services that operate through the Internet uses client/server design, in which a client program on the user’s computer sends command or information request to a server, which may respond by creating a live connection or by sending data back to the client.
The real interaction on the Internet is a seamless operation which is virtually unknown to the computer user.
For the sake of explanation, the structure of the Internet operation can be divided into three distinct parts – client tier, middle tier and the database tier.
On the top of the structure is the client tier.
The client tier is made up of the users’ application which is typically optimised for users’ interaction.
The interface is based on Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML) – to be discussed in sufficient details in due course – that enables the web browser (Internet Explorer, American Online or any other) interacts with the application at the client side.
HTML is normally used to define the format and style of the web pages and presenting information using the web browser.
The middle tier is a complex level that contains most application logic that communicates data between other levels of the system.
The web server may be the Internet Information Server (IIS), – that comes with Windows 2000 and later versions.
Apache, these software servers are used to achieve a secure client server communication.
They allow pre-processing of requests and post- processing of responses, permitting site-specific handling of HTTP requests and responses.
Active Server Page (ASP), PHP etc are scripting language used to communicate with the database.
These scripting languages handle data that are passed from the HTML forms in such a way that SQL (Structured Query Language) queries forms are sent to the database and the result of the queries are processed and passed to the client tier in an HTML document format.
The data source tier consists of the Data Base Management System (DBMS) – the back engine of the system resident on the server – used to create, delete, modify and query the data contents of the database.
5  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT The architecture of the system is based on the following software suites: - a browser, Hypertext Mark-up Language, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
HTML works for delivering and displaying of information using a web browser application, TCP/IP for transferring of data between application over the Internet, and HTTP interfaces the database to the web.

6  MBE 817 MODULE 1 3.
4 Internet Tools/Utilities 1.
Telnet Telnet is a simple, text-based program that allows you to connect to another computer by using the Internet.
Telnet allows authorised users to enter commands used to access programs and services that are on the remote computer, as if you were sitting right in front of it.
Telnet can be used for many things, including accessing e-mail, databases, or files.
The Telnet client is a text-based program that runs at the command prompt window.
User can only type text commands and user cannot use a mouse, because one doesn’t need mouse to accomplish most things one wants to use Telnet for.
Telnet is a technology which uses a client and a server.
Access depends on what the administrator allows the user do with Telnet access, and user’s rights on that system.
Telnet client is available on Windows, which means that user can connect to almost any Telnet server.
Telnet is a connection method that can be used across computers that use different operating systems, such as Linux, Unix, or Windows.
2.
Gopher Gopher was created at the University of Minnesota (Home of Golden Gopher) in 1991 as a guide to information services on the University Campus, but it turns to be a very important tool on the Internet.
A gopher is a distributed document delivery program that can access data on multiple hosts; it is a menu driven server program that lets the user access Internet information search tool.
The Internet Gopher contains one or more menus with pointer to items that may be located anywhere on the Net.
Gopher can browse a path to needed information.
It “goes for” materials on the topics of interest that are stored in different locations and establishes a path to the information.
Gopher is a bunch of dedicated computers called Gopher servers.
Each Gopher server knows about all the other servers (most of the time).
If a Gopher doesn’t have a needed search item, it searches for it on another Gopher server.
It presents these searches on a series of menus from which they can pick the next item of interest.
Gopher servers can be navigated, or specific information can be searched for on a particular server, or all the servers or just all the menu titles on all the servers.
Almost all information on the Internet can be downloaded.
When using Gopher, an item is selected from the menu; the Gopher’s client identifies 7  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT the resource type, and connects the computer to the server that contains the item.
If the resource is a file, the client program downloads a copy to the client’s computer, and uses local file viewer to display its contents.
If the server is a database, the gopher client asks for the specific information needs.
In recent times, the use of Gopher as a browsing tool has been taken over by the World Wide Web because it requires local content viewers to display downloaded files, but it is still a good Internet browsing tool, therefore it can still be part of the Internet tool kit.
3 Veronica This is an abbreviation for Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerised Archives.
It is a method of searching through all the Gopher menus for keywords that appear in the title of a file or directory.
It permits the use of logical operators like ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’ to join words together to narrow down or expand the search.
It is not case sensitive.
By default, Veronica will deliver only the first 200 items that match the searched term.
It is a very useful tool to locate information on Gopher servers.
Gopher client is first accessed, and then all Gopher space can be searched for directives to titles and words at different sites.
4 Jughead Jughead is similar to Veronica but the user can search just an area at a time.
User accesses a specific Gopher and selects the search Gopher space with Jughead for that gopher.
When the use of this tool is properly mastered, it saves a lot of time.
It is not as popular as Veronica.
5 Archie Archie is another Internet tool that helps users to find information on the Net.
It is a short form for Achieved files.
It is a collection of servers containing database files of anonymous File Transfer Protocols (FTP) host.
It is a character-based interface tool.
It is most effective for one- word searches.
It allows a search for keyword in the directory and file titles.
The word can be in singular or plural form and either lowercase or uppercase.
Several search methods to locate the needed information in Archie are command line driven, and these come in various guises of complexity.
It retrieves a lot of unwanted information from the Internet.
6 Telnet This is a short form of Telecommunication with another Network.
Telnet is a program that allows users to access the services of other 8  MBE 817 MODULE 1 members of the Internet without dialling in from your modem.
It is an Internet tool that connects one computer to a second computer as a distant terminal.
The Telnet server (called the host) treats user’s requests (commands) from the Internet as if they come from a terminal connected directly to the host.
It is client software used to log on to remote computers and perform tasks as though you are sitting at the remote computer itself.
Telnet can therefore, be used as a gateway into other computers’ services.
The TCP/IP numeric address or the Internet name of the host (server) becomes the passage to another node and its services.
When users connect Telnets to another system, many of its services are available to the users as if they are on the users home system, since other computers on the Internet are configured public Telnet host.
When logging to another system, the user must know the commands of the target system if there is no special Graphical User Interface (GUI) communication package.
7 File Transfer Protocol (FTP) This is an Internet tool that is used for uploading and downloading files between computers.
It is used to transfer files from remote system to a host computer.
When a server receives a file request from a client, it makes a copy of that file and sends back to the client (download).
Also the client may send files or directory of files to the server (upload).
Most often, users download files from the public archive on FTP servers.
Many of these archive files are available on the Internet.
Many software companies maintain FTP archives that contain upgrades, drivers and additional program modules.
A large amount of information gathered through the Internet use FTP.
Just as in Telnet, only the address of the server and the directory/subdirectory of the file need to be known.
When accessing public files, clients log on to FTP as ‘anonymous’ for their usernames, and enter their e-mail address as the password.
Anonymous FTP is always free public information.
When a file is transferred, it goes to the host system’s directory, and then it is downloaded unto the client’s PC.
FTP comes in two forms: i.
Especially FTP with terminal emulator: - This uses command lines.
It is more difficult to use for the beginners.
ii.
FTP with GUI: - This is window based and object oriented.
It employs clicking of mouse button.
This method uses GUI communication software that makes the process much simple.
9  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Binary files, text files, data graphics, multimedia and compressed files can be transferred and the special format can still be maintained SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Enumerate five (5) Internet tools you have studied in this sub-section.
3.5 Uses of the Internet 1.
Find information The Internet contains a vast amount of information—far more than even the world's largest libraries.
For example, you can read news stories and movie reviews, check airline schedules, see street maps, get the weather forecast for your city, or research a health condition.
Reference sources, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias, are widely available, as well as are historical documents and classic literature.
Most companies, government agencies, non-profit organisations, museums, and libraries have websites with information about their products, services, or collections.
Many individuals publish websites with personal journals called blogs (short for web logs) about their hobbies and interests.
2.
Communicate E-mail is one of the most popular uses of the Internet.
You can send an e-mail message to anyone with an e-mail address, and it will arrive almost instantly in the recipient's e-mail inbox—even if he or she lives halfway around the world.
Instant Messaging (IM) allows user to have a real-time conversation with another person or a group of people.
When you type and send an instant message, the message is immediately visible to all participants.
Unlike e-mail, all participants have to be online (connected to the Internet) and in front of their computers at the same time.
Newsgroups and web-based forums allow you to participate in text- based discussions with a community of other people who are interested in the same topic.
For example, if you are having trouble using a program, you could post a question in a discussion group for users of that program.
10  MBE 817 MODULE 1 3.
Share You can upload (copy) pictures from your digital camera to a photo- sharing website.
Invited friends and family members can then visit the website to view your photo albums.
4.
Shop The web is the world's biggest shopping mall.
You can browse and purchase products—books, music, toys, clothing, electronics, and much more—at the websites of major retailers (usually a credit card is required).
You can also buy and sell used items through websites that use auction-style bidding.
5.
Play You can play games of every type on the web, often against other players—no matter where they are in the world.
Many games are free, and you can download others for a fee.
You can also listen to Internet radio stations, watch movie clips, and download or purchase music, videos, and even some TV shows.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE List the uses of the Internet.
3.6 Connecting to the Internet To start with, there is the need to decide what type of network to set up or to find out what hardware and cables you need to set up a home network.
Once you know what type of network you want and have the necessary hardware, there are four possible steps to take (two of these are not always required).
1.
Install any necessary hardware.
2.
Set up an Internet connection (optional).
3.
Connect the computers.
4.
Run the set up which can be a wireless router or access point wizard (wireless only).
This begins by setting up one computer.
Once the network is set up and it is established that the first computer is working correctly, add additional computers or devices.
This information is designed for people 11  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT who have a broadband connection (usually DSL or cable) to the Internet rather than a dial-up connection.
Install the Hardware Install network adapters in any computer that needs them.
(Follow the installation instructions in the information that came with each adapter.)
Set Up or verify an Internet Connection (Optional) You don't need an Internet connection to set up a network, although most people want to use their network to share an Internet connection.
To set up an Internet connection, there is a need for a cable or DSL modem and an account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Then connect to the Internet wizard and follow the instructions.
After an Internet connection, there is the need to verify that the connection is working.
To do that, open your web browser and go to a website that you don't usually visit.
(If you go to a website that you visit often, some of its web pages might be stored on your computer and will display correctly even if your connection is faulty.)
If the website opens and you don't get any error message, your connection is working.
To Share an Internet connection An Internet connection can also be shared among two or more network computers.
This can be done by either use an intermediary device or set up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) - this may require additional cost by your ISP a.
Use an Intermediary Device.
A router or a combined router and modem (also called an Internet gateway) can be used to share an Internet connection.
If you use a router, connect it to both the modem and the computer with the Internet connection, and then verify your Internet connection again.
The information that came with the router should include connection instructions.
If you use a combined router and modem, plug it into any computer.
Note The router and modem must be turned on to use the Internet connection from any of the computers on your network.
b.
Set up ICS.
If you want to share an Internet connection and you don't want to buy any more equipment, you can set up ICS on the computer that is connected to the modem.
That computer will also need two network adapters: one to connect to the modem 12  MBE 817 MODULE 1 and one to connect to the other computer.
ICS is not included with Windows Vista starter.
Connect the Computers There are several ways to connect computers—the configuration depends on the type of network adapters, modem, and the Internet connection that you have.
It also depends on whether or not the Internet connection is to be shared among all the computers on the network.
The following sections briefly describe some connection methods.
Ethernet Networks If your home or office is wired for Ethernet, set up the computers in rooms that have Ethernet jacks, and then plug them directly into the Ethernet jacks.
Ethernet Network using Built-in Ethernet Wireless Networks HPNA Networks Turn on all computers or devices, such as printers, that you want to be part of your network.
If your network is wired to Ethernet or HPNA, it should be set up and ready to use.
You should test your network to make sure that all computers and devices are connected correctly.
Run the Set up as a Wireless Router or Access Point Wizard If your network is wireless, run the setup as wireless router or access point wizard on the computer attached to the router.
The wizard will instruct you on the process of adding other computers and devices to the network.
Test Your Network It is a good idea to test your network in order to make sure that all the computers and devices are connected and working properly.
To test your network, do the following on each network computer.
Click the start button, and then click Network.
You should be able to see icons for the computer you are on and all of the other computers and devices that you have added to the network.
If the computer you are 13  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT checking has a printer attached, the printer icon might not be visible on other computers until you enable printer sharing.
Connecting Your Mobile PC from Work to Your Home Network To connect the mobile PC that you use at work to the Internet or the network from your home network, you must have a network connection set up at home.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE State the four stages required to get connected to the Internet.
3.7 Surfing the Internet Surfing the Internet is the process of visiting different sites on the Internet.
The word was coined by Jean Armour Polly in 1992.
You can use the web on the Internet to link different pages at different sites all over the world for a wide variety of activities.
This is like changing the channel of your television set.
It has to do with the aesthetic of “going with flow” as dictated by hyperlink on some of the word or phrase on your current web page.
This can be accomplished by the use of World Wide Web.
Casual clicking on the web links is naturally quick.
A purposeful search on the Net is, however, better and time saving.
Various web browsers are available to search users’ needs on the Internet.
Some of these are the Internet Explorer, American Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, and Netscape SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is “surfing” on the Internet?
4.0 CONCLUSION Looking at the trend in scientific research, business activities, entertainment, education, government and even administration, it becomes imperative for virtually all living literate people that want to be relevant in this century to have a competent knowledge of what the Internet is, and at least some experience of its usage.
All hands must be on deck to ensure this is done.
Individuals must be ready with prepared mind, also governments and establishments have a lot to do in the provision of the Internet facilities and equally finance the training of their personnel.
14  MBE 817 MODULE 1 5.0 SUMMARY This unit is an eye opener to what the Internet is all about.
The general overview and the history have enabled us to know where the technology started and the contributions of visionaries on the design and development of the Internet.
More so, client server interaction enables us to know the relationship between our computer and the host that connects user’s system to the Internet.
The various tools that had been used to communicate on the Internet is a guide that research on the technology is a continuous process and better things may still emerge as new discoveries are made.
Connectivity of the system is a very vital stage in the use of the Net and it is very important that that stage is not omitted because it forms the basic prerequisite to our searching or surfing the Internet.

It brought into reality interconnections among peoples, resources and minds of different tribes, races, geographical zones, religion and cultures together into a unified entity on the Internet.
In actual fact, the usage of the computer and the Internet becomes an instrument of empowerment for all.
The zeal for computer usage becomes greatly increase as user may link different sites all over the world to do what their minds intend to do.
The estimated number of the Internet users has increased from 200,000 in year 2000 to 5,000,000 in June 2007, which represents a percentage increase of 2,400.0% in Nigeria; about 643.1% in Africa and about 225.0% growth worldwide.
The usage will continue to grow at a steady rate.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain (brief) a history of the WWW • explain the basic web terminologies • navigate web pages • surf the Internet using a web browser.
16  MBE 817 MODULE 1 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The World Wide Web (WWW) or Web The World Wide Web (WWW) or Web consists of a wide collection of electronic documents that have built-in hyperlinks to other related documents.
The link may be to another part within the same document or other documents in the same site or other sites in any part of the world.
Technically, the World Wide Web is defined as all the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
A broader definition comes from the organization that Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee helped found, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
The organisation defined it thus: "The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge."
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Explain what you understand by World Wide Web.
3.2 History of World Wide Web 3.2.1 Web Page A Web page on the World Wide Web is a page of file/document notated with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
Usually, it contains text and specifications about where image or other multimedia files are to be placed when the page is displayed.
Each page is an individual HTML file with its own Web address (URL).
The first page you usually request at a site is known as the home page.
Most home pages have a default name that doesn't have to be specified; you only need to enter the domain name for the site itself.
Web page may be retrieved from a local computer or from a remote web server.
Web pages are requested and served from the web servers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
Web page may consist of files of static text stored within the web server’s system.
These are called static web pages, the web server may construct the XHTML for each web page when it is requested by the browser – these are refer to as dynamic web page.
Static web pages usually have file extension .htm or .html, while a dynamic web page usually reflects the language or technology used at the server such as 17  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT PHP, JavaServer Pages, or others, taking the associated URL .filename extensions .php or .jsp 3.2.2 Website A Web site is a related collection of World Wide Web (WWW) files that includes a beginning file called a home page.
A Web site can be just a few pages.
A website implies a geographic place that may contain some set of peculiar features.
A very large Web site may be spread over a number of servers in different geographic locations.
IBM is a good example; its Web site consists of thousands of files spread out over many servers in world-wide locations.
A synonym and less frequently used term for Web site is "Web presence."
That term seems to better express the idea that a site is not tied to specific geographic location, but is "somewhere in cyberspace."
However, "Web site" seems to be used much more frequently.
You can have multiple Web sites that cross-link to files on each others' sites or even share the same files.
3.2.3 Web Browser A browser is an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.
The word "browser" seems to have originated prior to the Web as a generic term for user interfaces that let you browse (navigate through and read) text files online.
Technically, a Web browser is a client program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to make requests of Web servers throughout the Internet on behalf of the browser user.
Most browsers support e-mail and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) but a Web browser is not required for those Internet protocols and more specialised client programs are more popular.
The first Web browser, called World Wide Web, was created in 1990.
That browser's name was changed to Nexus to avoid confusion with the developing information space known as the World Wide Web.
The first Web browser with a graphical user interface was Mosaic, which appeared in 1993.
Many of the user interface features in Mosaic went into Netscape Navigator.
Microsoft followed with its Internet Explorer (IE).
18  MBE 817 MODULE 1 As of September 2006, Internet Explorer is the most commonly used browser.
Other browsers include: • firefox browser wars between IE, which was developed from Mezilla (the open source version of Netscape).
• flock, an open source browser based on Firefox and optimised for Web 2.0 features such as blogging and social book marking .
• safari, a browser for Apple computers (the third most popular browser).
• lynx, a text-only browser for Unix shell and VMS users.
• opera, a fast and stable browser that's compatible with most relatively operating systems.
3.2.4 Web Server A Web server is a program that, using the client/server model and the World Wide Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), serves the files that form Web pages to Web users (whose computers contain HTTP clients that forward their requests).
Every computer on the Internet that contains a Web site must have a Web server program.
Two leading Web servers are Apache, the most widely-installed Web server, and Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS).
Other Web servers include Novell's Web Server for users of its NetWare operating system and IBM's family of Lotus Domino servers, primarily for IBM's OS/390 and AS/400 customers.
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of Internet- and intranet-related programs for serving e-mail, downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files, and building and publishing Web pages.
Considerations in choosing a Web server include how well it works with the operating system and other servers, its ability to handle server-side programming, security characteristics, and publishing, search engine, and site building tools that may come with it.
3.2.5 Web Address Web address is expressed as the directory path to the file on a particular server.
(A Web page address is also called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL.)
URLs identify both HTML and HTTP when accessing Web pages.
The URL tells the browser where to locate a document.
It is a standard that allows a user to enter name and location of information, as well as the method of transporting that information over the Internet.
Example: http://www.nigeriaopenuniveristy.com/computers/mscit1.html Protocol Domain name path Document name 19  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Protocol is a set of rules guiding communications on the Internet.
Domain name is address of the IP server on which the site is resident.
This is translated by the user browser into numerical figures that actually represent the serves address Path is/are folder on the website where the site’s documents are stored.
The documents are individual files that are linked together as a whole on the site.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Differentiate between Static Web page and dynamic Web page.
3.3 How to Find Information on the Internet URL This is the fastest way to find information on the Internet if you know the address of the site page you want to visit.
The Web address (URL) of the page is typed in the address bar at the top of your browser window.
The browser links the site and displays the page if the address is correct.
Browsing When reading some web pages or documents, one can easily link to other related pages the Internet by clicking a Hyperlink and then follow on.
Hyperlinks always have blue colour, and when pointed to, the pointer changes to form a hand.
Good web designs always have hyperlinks that can take them to other sites of interest when click on them Search Engine A search engine is a software program that can be used to find information on the Internet.
It can be used to find websites, pages and the Internet files.
It is helpful in locating specific pages for which one do not know the URL.
To find a page or pages, you enter the search word or phrase called search text or keyword on the search bar of the of the search engine you are using.
The search engine locates and retrieves documents matching the keyword, displays the number of items retrieved and show them on the screen in pages.
There are quite a number of search engines on the Net, each work in a similar way to retrieve the same or different result of the 20  MBE 817 MODULE 1 search a keyword.
Some of the search engines support Boolean search with logical operators such as AND, OR, NOT.
Examples are Google, MSN, and Yahoo etc.
Many search engines use a program call a spider.
This program reads Web pages in order to create catalogue or index of hit; to display a list of Web pages that contain the keyword entered in the search bar.
4.0 CONCLUSION World Wide Web otherwise called the Web has become a vital engine that drives the Internet and it has made the use of the Internet more popular among people of different profession.
It enhances the Internet awareness and usage and therefore has become a subject worth discuss in this way.
In most cases people now replace the term Internet with Web.
It therefore becomes necessary for students to know the basic concept of the World Wide Web.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have discussed the various concepts of the World Wide Web.
The overview gave us the insight to how it all started and the brain behind the technology.
Other concepts like the Hyperlink, the Web address, the Web server, Website etc, further gives a better understanding of client/server interaction discussed in unit 1.
Consequently, the topic on how to search the Internet is an eye opener to various ways in which our quest for information on the Internet can be easily handled.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Mention three (3) ways to access information on the Internet.

It is derived from the spider’s method of connection from place to place or setting trap for their preys.
In computing, the term has become very popular term since early 90’s especially when the World Wide Web was published by Tim Berners-Lee in the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.
Now, the concept of Web has become a popular parlance that it is no more synonymous to a trap but rather a complicated network of local and global link on the Internet.
A web site consists of a home page connected to other files by hyperlinks.
A web site can be disk- based or server-based.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the concept of web sites • implement the design of websites using FrontPage • design a web page • link web pages together • add dynamic contents to web pages • list and explain the browser and server compatibility of a website.
22  MBE 817 MODULE 1 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Designing Web Sites using Front Page Microsoft, as the world leading software developer, has provided FrontPage and other associated software, as a wonderful tool to design and implement web design.
Microsoft Front page is a package in Microsoft Office suites that is specifically designated for the purpose of web design.
It makes web design easy to create, modify/edit, authenticated and publish for use on the Internet.
Before we go into the intricacies of designing web sites, it is necessary to look into various concepts associated with web design.
3.2 Definition of Concepts A web site is a group of related Web pages that is hosted by an HTTP server on the World Wide Web.
The pages in a Web site generally cover one or more topics and are interconnected through hyperlinks.
Most Web sites have a home page as their starting point.
Home Page is the Main page of a web site which usually has hyperlinks to other pages.
A web site can contain many pages connected together by hyperlinks.
Hyperlink is a coloured and underlined text or a graphic object/icon that can be clicked to go to a file, a location within a file, an HTML page on the World Wide Web, or an HTML page on an intranet.
Hyperlinks can also go to newsgroups and to Gopher, Telnet, and FTP sites.
A web site can be disk-based (disk-based web site: A web site hosted on a local computer.)
or server-based (server-based web site: A web site hosted by a Web server, such as Microsoft Internet Information Server (MIIS).
3.3 Create a Web Site 1.
Load Microsoft FrontPage 2.
On the File menu, point to New, and then click Page or Web.
3.
In the New Page or Web task pane, under New from template, click Web Site Templates.
4.
Click the web site template you want to use.
5.
In the Specified location of the new web box, type the URL for the new web site, or click Browse to create a new site on your hard disk, network, or on the Internet.
23  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Note To create a subweb, append the name of the subweb to the name of the root web.
For example: http://Open_Univerity.com/web_design.
6.
Choose one of the following: • If you want to add the site to the current web site, select Add to current Web.
• If you are creating a Microsoft FrontPage web on a secure port of a Web server that supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), select the Secure connection required (SSL) checkbox.
3.4 Creating and Designing Web Pages Web pages are the basic documents of the World Wide Web and are written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
Web pages can either be part of a web site, or they can stand alone.
FrontPage provides several page templates that can help a user to quickly create pages with a variety of layouts and functions.
FrontPage template can be used to create a two-column page or a page with a search form.
Several themes can also be used to create pages with a consistent design.
A theme contains unified design elements with a colour scheme, including fonts, graphics, backgrounds, navigation bars, horizontal lines, and other page elements.
To design and layout pages by oneself, one can start with a blank page, and then: • use frames, tables, or absolute positioning to precisely position text and graphics on a page.
• add page elements, such as text, graphics, page banners, tables, forms, hyperlinks, banner ads, etc.
• add content that can change, such as marquees, hit counters, and time stamps.
• format text by applying styles or using style sheets.
• animate page elements and set page transitions for lively pages.
• set the background colour, picture, or sound.
• create your own page template: a pre-designed page that can contain page settings, formatting, and page elements.
24  MBE 817 MODULE 1 3.5 Navigation Structure Link Bar A link bar is a set of hyperlinks used for navigating a web site.
A typical link bar might have hyperlinks to the web site's home page and its main pages: Home News Contents Search A link bar can be display on every page in your web site so that site visitors can always get to the web site's main pages quickly and easily.
Link bars can use buttons or text hyperlinks.
For example, the link bar above can also be displayed as text: Home News Contents Search A set of hyperlinks can be created to use for navigation — that is, one can create his/her own set of buttons and link them to the relevant pages within his/her web site and outside it, and repeat this on each page where you want a link bar.
One can also choose to set up the navigation structure of a web site, and then let Microsoft FrontPage create the link bars.
FrontPage maintains the link bars it creates; if a page is moved or added, FrontPage updates (recalculates the hyperlinks in) the link bar accordingly.
Note FrontPage can generate link bars only when you are working within a web site, rather than with separate pages.
Types of Link Bars • Microsoft FrontPage has three different types of link bars that can be added to your pages for navigation Note You can add and view any type of link bar when you publish to a disk-based web site.
However, to publish to a Web server, in order to be able to add a custom link bar or a link bar with back and next links, the Web server must have SharePoint Team Services from Microsoft installed.
A.
A Custom Link Bar When you add a custom link bar is added to a site, one can add any of the pages within the web site as well as external pages.
This link bar can be set up in any desired way; pages can be added or removed from the link bar at any time.
25  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT B.
A Link Bar with Back and Next Links When a link bar with back and next links is added, FrontPage looks at the navigation structure of the web site in order to determine which page will be linked to when the site visitor clicks the Back or the Next link.
In addition to these choices for a link bar, a page can be hyperlinked to the web site's home page and/or to the parent of the current page, or to external web pages.
C. A Link Bar Based on the Navigation Structure of Your Web Site In order to add a link bar based on the navigation structure of your web site, you must first set up that navigation structure.
The navigation structure determines which hyperlinks to put on the link bar, and the page titles determine the labels for the hyperlinks.
You can create a navigation structure for your web site by organizing pages in Navigation view.
This navigation structure shows how pages in your web site are related to each other and provides FrontPage with a way to set up link bars.
Then, when you add link bars based on the navigation structure of your web site, FrontPage sets up each link bar according to this structure.
The following example shows the structure of a web site: Contacts Home Academics Administration Finance Address Personnel Student Affairs The following is an explanation of the relationships between these pages: Home page : The first page added to a navigation structure, typically named Default.htm or Index.htm.
In this example, Home is the home page.
Global-level pages: These are at the same level as (but do not include) the home page as shown in Contacts above 26  MBE 817 MODULE 1 Parent-level pages The parent page of another page, plus pages that are directly connected to the parent page on the same level.
The parent- level pages for Academics are Home (the parent page), and Contacts.
Child-level pages are pages directly below another page.
In this example, Home has three child pages (Academics, Administration, and Finance), Contacts has one child page (Address), and Administration has two child pages (Personnel and Students Affairs).
Same-level pages Pages that are on the same level in the structure and have the same parent page as Academics, Administration, and Finance are same-level pages, but Address is not because it has a different parent page.
Personnel and Student Affairs are also same-level pages.
Back and next pages The structure for the back and next pages is determined by the order of pages in Navigation view.
In this example, if Administration is the page to which you are adding the link bar, the Next link would direct the site visitor to Finance and the Back link would direct the site visitor to Academics Setting the style of link bars There are several option to make link bars appears • Place link bars horizontally or vertically on a page • Add more than one link bar to each page, for example to navigate to different page levels • Format a link bar that uses text just as you would any other type of text • Change the style of a link bar that uses buttons instead of text Using Link Bars within Shared Borders A shared border is a region that is common to one or more pages in a web site.
Shared border is used to place the same content on multiple pages in one step, rather than editing each page.
One can also use link bars inside a shared border.
However, this is relative to each page — a link bar might seem useful when it is viewed from one page, but one might not like the selection of hyperlinks when the link bar is viewed from a different page.
Since a link bar inside a shared border has the same settings for all pages using the shared border.
There is a need to be careful when setting up the link bar.

For example the hit content, time stamp, dynamic HTML etc.
Hit Counter: this tallies and displays the number of times a web page has been visited to the user and site owner.
This will serve as motivation to user to know the awareness of the site and its relevance to the needs of web browsers.
Microsoft FrontPage provides several styles of counters, but user can supply his/her own number graphics by creating a custom picture in GIF format.
After you add a hit counter to a page, you can reset the counter to any number.

Dynamic HTML (DHTML) effects: DHTML is a Microsoft enhancement to HTML version 4.0 that enables user to create visual effects or improve the layout of a web page.
A visual effect might be an animation in which text appears to fly off the page one word at a time.
A page layout improvement could take the form of a space-saving collapsible outline.
The blue links below are designed using DHTML so that you can click them to show more content.
If site visitors with older browsers (Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or earlier or Netscape Navigator 3.0 or earlier) make up a large portion of your audience, you can turn off DHTML features using the Microsoft FrontPage browser compatibility settings.
If you disable DHTML, or if you design a web site to be compatible with a browser that doesn't support DHTML, the commands that use DHTML will be unavailable (that is, they will appear dimmed) on menus in FrontPage.
The following commands and settings are unavailable when DHTML is disabled 36  MBE 817 MODULE 1 • Dynamic HTML Effects (Format menu) • Page Transition (Format menu) • Enable collapsible outlines (Bullets and Numbering dialogue box) • Enable hyperlink rollover effects (Page Properties dialogue box, Background tab) Note If you choose a browser compatibility selection that doesn't support DHTML, but use it anyway, your pages might not be displayed properly, or they might contain errors.
3.8 Browser Compatibility It is possible to design a web site for compatibility with specific browsers and technologies.
For example, you can design a web site for compatibility with both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, or for compatibility with all version 4.0 browsers Browser compatibility settings The following table shows features that are enabled in Microsoft FrontPage depending on the browser compatibility settings you choose.
Browser type Available Features Microsoft Internet ActiveX, VBScript, JavaScript, Java Explorer applets, DHTML, frames, CSS 1.0, CSS 5.0 and later 2.0, VML ActiveX, VBScript, JavaScript, Java Internet Explorer 4.0 applets, DHTML, frames, CSS 1.0, CSS 2.0, VML downlevel image file ActiveX, VBScript, JavaScript, Java Internet Explorer 3.0 applets, frames, CSS 1.0, VML downlevel image file JavaScript, Java applets, DHTML, Netscape Navigator 5.0 and frames, CSS 1.0, CSS 2.0, VML later downlevel image file JavaScript, Java applets, DHTML, Netscape 4.0 frames, CSS 1.0, CSS 2.0, VML downlevel image file JavaScript, Java applets, frames, VML Netscape 3.0 downlevel image file Internet Explorer and JavaScript, Java applets, DHTML, 37  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Netscape frames, CSS 1.0, CSS 2.0, VML 4.0, 5.0 and later downlevel image file Internet Explorer and JavaScript, Java applets, frames, VML Netscape 3.0 downlevel image file Microsoft Web TV N/A The following settings may be unavailable depending on the browser compatibility settings you choose.

Its flexibility makes it acceptable to users.
It is authors HTML of the user’s web design automatically thereby ease the burden of tag memorisation.
Time spent on coding is less and the HTML automatically authored can serve as open source to design other web site.
FrontPage offers a wide range of compatibilities to many versions of browsers with little settings or modification.
Apart from different version of Internet explorer, it support other browsers like Netscape, Mosaic, and Microsoft web TV.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have explore in concise sense, how to design a website and its pages using FrontPage.
The basic concepts in web design are explored, and different methods of linking web pages and sites together are explored.
More so table of contents is a major tool for navigating a website and also for connecting external site.
The methods of creating table of contents were outline for systematic understanding and practicability.
The issue of compatibility may course a serious problem if not well mastered.
This unit has done good justice to these essential parts of web design.

It is not a word processor such as Word or WordPerfect, although these word processors may be used as text editor to prepare HTML.
HTML document may be viewed by many different "browsers", of very different abilities.
Thus, HTML allows you to mark selections of text as titles or paragraphs, and then leaves the interpretation of these marked elements up to the browser you are using.
For example one browser may indent the beginning of a paragraph, while another may only leave a blank line.
42  MBE 817 MODULE 2 HTML instructions divide the text of a document into blocks called elements.
The elements can be divided into two broad categories -- those that define how the BODY of the document is to be displayed by the browser and those that define information `about' the document, such as the title or relationships to other documents.
This unit describes the vocabulary of these elements and an overall description of the design of HTML documents.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the different parts of a complete HTML document • describe the structure and uses of various HTML instructions • write a complete HTML document for a web page design • explain and implement some advanced features of HTML instructions • describe how to document various section of HTML • explain the concept o f Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Introduction to Html and Xhtml The HTML/XHTML instructions are called elements.
The instructions are themselves called tags.
The instructions look like <element_name>, that is, they are simply the element name surrounded by left and right angle brackets.
Most elements mark blocks of the document for particular purpose or formatting: the above <element_name> tag marks the beginning of such as section.
The end of this section is then marked by the ending tag </element_name>, note the leading slash character "/" that appears in front of the element name in an end tag.
End, or stop tags are always indicated by this leading back slash character.
For example, the heading at the top of this page is an H2 element, (a level 2 heading) which is written as: <H2> 4.0 Introduction to HTML </H2>.
Some elements are empty -- that is, they do not affect a block of the document in some way.
These elements do not require an ending tag.
An example is the <HR> element, which draws a horizontal line across the page.
This element would simply be entered as <HR> Element names are case insensitive.
Thus, the horizontal rule element can be written as any of <hr>, <Hr> or <HR>.
43  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Many elements can have arguments that pass parameters to the interpreter handling this element.
These arguments are called attributes of the element.
For example, consider the element A, which marks a region of text as the beginning (or end) of a hypertext link.
This element can have several attributes.
One of them, HREF, specifies the hypertext document to which the marked piece of text is linked.
To specify this in the tag for A you write: <A HREF="http://www.fedpoybidaportal.com/home.html"> Registration </a>.
where the attribute HREF is assigned the indicated URL.
Note that the A element is not empty, and that it is closed by the tag </a>.
Note also that end tags do not take attributes - the attributes to an element are always placed in the start tag.
HTML/XHTML is an evolving language, and each new version is given a number.
The first definitive version was HTML 2.0. it contains the most common elements, but some of the Netscape/Microsoft extensions are missing, and did not support tables, or ALIGN attributes.
HTML 3 (late 1995) had many upgrade the features and utility of HTML.
However, it was never completed or implemented, although many features were integrated in version 3.2. this version supports TABLES, image, heading, ALIGN attributes, and a few others.
It becomes the “universal" dialect to all browsers.
However, it misses some of the Netscape/Microsoft extensions, such as FRAMEs, EMBED and APPLET.
These features came with HTML 4.0 HTML 4.01 supports most proprietary extensions, and extra features like Internationalised documents, Cascading Style Sheets, extra TABLE, FORM, and JavaScript enhancements, that are not universally supported.
Now, HTML is being replaced by a new language, called XHTML - for the eXtensible HyperText Markup Language.
The differences are actually small but important.
However, HTML and XHTML are very similar.
The distinguishing features of XHTML are: 1.
All tag and attribute names must be in lowercase.
Thus, you can't write <A HREF="home.html">...</A> as <a href= home.html">...</a> 44  MBE 817 MODULE 2 2.
Empty tags must be written with an extra slash at the end e.g.
<br> or <img src=ball.gif"> as: <br />, and <img src="ball.gif" />.
3.
You can never omit an end tag.
This is sometimes with HTML as in <p> This paragraph is good With XHTML, as <p> This paragraph is good </p> 4.
Attributes must always have a value.
<hr size="2" storm> as <hr size="2" storm="strong wind" /> 5.
Attributes values must always be quoted.
<hr size=2> as <hr size="2" /> 3.2 Structure of HTML Document HTML documents are structured into two parts, the HEAD, and the BODY.
Both of these are contained within the HTML element - this element simply denotes this as an HTML document.
The head contains information about the document that is not generally displayed with the document, such as its TITLE.
The BODY contains the body of the text, this is where you place the document material to be displayed.
Elements allowed inside the HEAD, such as TITLE, are not allowed inside the BODY, and vice versa.
Example of Document Structure <HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Library Retrieval Project </TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <h1> Library Retrieval Project </h1> Welcome to the Home Page of the Library Retrieval System.
This project allows the user to access library materials from a remote source.
It is a powerful online system that has been commended by scholars all over the globe.
<p>How do you access it?
Do the following <ul> <li><A HREF="Library.html">Type</A> your information request.
<li>Click <A HREF="http://lib.info/retr.html">Go</A> to retrieve result.
45  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT <li>Select <A HREF="ftp:serc.ret/bk.gif">book</a> </ul> </BODY> </HTML> Naming Scheme for HTML document When your browser use for your HTML (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, lynx etc.)
retrieves a file, it must know what type of data it has received in order to know what to do with it.
HyperText Transmission Protocol (HTTP) servers explicitly tell the browser the type of the data being sent.
In other cases, such as when the browser is using File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to access a remote file, or when the browser is reading a file from your local disk (such as when you are editing pages prior to publishing them to a Web server), the browsers "guesses" the data type from the filename extension - that is, the part after the dot in the filename.
The file extension indicates the type of file to be read.
For example, HTML files are identified by names such as name.html (.html extension indicates that this is an HTML document).
Four letter extensions are common.
This is not a problem with UNIX computers or Macintoshes, since these machines place no restriction on the filename.
DOS and Windows 3.1 machines are restricted to a three letter extension.
So the extension is truncated to three letters (i.e.
.html becomes .htm).
Some standard extensions and their meanings are listed in the Table 3.1 Table 3.1: Mark-up elements within HTML HEAD BASE A record of the original URL of the document: this allows you to move the document to a new directory (or even a new site) and have relative URLs access the appropriate place with respect to the original URL.
ISINDEX Usually placed in the HEAD by the server or a server script/program to indicate that a document is searchable.
LINK Defines the relationship(s) between this document and another or others.
A document can have several LINK elements.
META A container for document metainformation.
NEXTID A parameter used by automated HTML editors to create unique identifiers for the documents.
NOTE: This attribute was dropped in HTML 4.0, so you should avoid it in new documents.
46  MBE 817 MODULE 2 TITLE The title of the document.
This element is mandatory -- all documents must have a TITLE.
STYLE Stylesheet instructions, written in a stylesheet language.
Stylesheet instructions specify how the document should be formatted for display.
Most browsers currently support stylesheets.
SCRIPT Script program code -- for enclosing, within a document, scripting program code that should be run with -- and that can interact with -- the document.
Example languages are JavaScript and VBScript.
Example of a HEAD <HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Tinuola Business Enterprise </TITLE> <BASE HREF="http://www.education.org/register/student.html"> <LINKHREF="http://www.education.org/reg/index.html" REL="index"> </HEAD> <BODY> text of the document </BODY> </HTML 3.3 BODY of HTML document The content of a document is contained in the BODY element as opposed to the HEAD, which contains information about the document.
Some mark-up elements allow within the body include the headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links, images etc.
Example of the HEAD and BODY elements are shown in the document below: <HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> BODY element in HTML </TITLE> <BASE HREF="http://www.fedpolybidaporta.gov.ng/register/06/SAA S/list.html"> </HEAD> <BODY> <H1> BODY Element in HTML </H1> 47  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT <p> The BODY element contains all the content of the document, as opposed to the HEAD, which contains information about the document.
</p>... </BODY> </HTML> BODY Attributes Background Attribute This enables an image file to be specified as a background e.g.
<BODY BACKGROUND="back/polylogo.jpeg"></BODY> tiles the window background with the designated JPEG image.
COLOUR Attributes BGCOLOUR =”#rrggbb” sets the background colour to the specified RGB value.
Where RR, GG, BB represents the hexadecimal values for Red, Green and Blue respectively.
The value rages from 0 to 255.
Colour “000000”is black, while “FFFFFF” is white.
TEXT="#rrggbb" sets the default text colour to the specified RGB colour value.
LINK="#rrggbb" sets the default text colour of hypertext anchors to the specified RGB colour value.
VLINK="#rrggbb" sets the default text colour of visited hypertext links to the specified RGB colour value.
Most browsers also support special colour names (white, blue, etc.).
MARGIN Attributes Most browsers added attributes that set the padding around the text the page -- essentially setting the page margins.
These properties are: LEFTMARGIN="nn" sets the page margin on the left of the page to be of size nn pixels.
RIGHTMARGIN="nn" sets the page margin on the right of the page to be of size nn pixels.
TOPMARGIN="nn" sets the page margin at the top of the page to be of size nn pixels.
48  MBE 817 MODULE 2 3.3.1 Organisation of the Elements in the BODY A.
Text Block Elements As earlier mentioned, the BODY element contains all the displayed content of a document.
Structurally, the document content is organised into blocks of text, such as paragraphs, lists, headings, paragraphs, block quotations, and so on.
These are generically called block elements, since they "block" chunks of text together into logical units.
Block elements can often contain other blocks, e.g.
a list item can contain paragraphs or block quotations, so that these elements can often nest together.
The block-level elements are- • Hn (Headings) • P • ADDRESS • BLOCKQUOTE • PRE • HR • FORM • TABLE • DIV (HTML 3.2 and up) B.
Text Emphasis Elements At the next level down are text-level markup elements.
These are elements that mark text for special meanings, for example, that a particular piece of text is emphasised (EM) or a citation (CITE), or that specify the desired physical formatting, such as boldface (B) or italics (I).
These elements can usually appear anywhere inside a block element, with a few exceptions (you can't have images inside a PRE element).
C. Special Elements -- Hypertext Anchors Analogous to the text-level markup is the anchor (A) element.
This is the element that marks hypertext links.
D. Character-Level Elements Character-level elements are line breaks (BR) and images (IMG).
These are treated much like characters, and can appear wherever there is a character in a document.
49  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT E. Character References More so, there are character or entity references.
These are special HTML "escape" codes that can be used to enter special characters that are hard to type, such as accented or other non-ASCII characters.
These are needed to type angle brackets or ampersand characters, as these are otherwise interpreted as HTML tags (< ... > ) or as the beginnings of character or entity references (&).
Document Section Headings HTML allows for six levels of headings, marked by the element names H1, H2... H6.
There is no forced hierarchy in these headings, but for consistency you should use the top level (H1) for main headings and lower levels for progressively less important ones.
In general hypertext documents should be broken up so that each page does not occupy much more than a single screen.
In these cases you can use the H1 heading to mark the main document heading, and the others to mark subheadings.
Heading Alignment: The ALIGN Attribute ALIGN attribute allows an author to "hint" at the desired alignment of the heading on the display.
The possible values are ALIGN="left" (the default) to left-align the heading, ALIGN="centre" to centre the heading, and ALIGN="right" to right-align the heading.
Examples of Headings <H1 align="left"> Heading type H1 </H1> Heading type H1 <H2 align="centre"> Heading type H2 </H2> Heading type H2 <H3 align="right"> Heading type H3 </H3> Heading type H3 <H4> Heading type H4 </H4> Heading type H4 <H5> Heading type H5 </H5> Heading type H5 <H6> Heading type H6 </H6> Heading type H6 50  MBE 817 MODULE 2 Marking Paragraphs The P element marks a block of text as a paragraph.
The tag <P> marks the beginning of the paragraph, while the tag </P> marks the end of a paragraph.
The end tag, however, is optional.
For example, the above text, including the heading, was marked up as follows: <p> The P element marks a block of text as a paragraph -- the tag <code>&lt;P></code> marks the beginning of the paragraph, while the tag <code>&lt;/P></code> marks the end of a paragraph.
The end tag, however, is optional.</p> Lists HTML supports several elements for making lists.
They can be divided into two types: glossary lists, and regular lists.
Glossary Lists are denoted by the element <DL>, while regular lists are denoted by the elements <UL>, <OL>, <MENU> and <DIR>.
Lists can be nested.
Thus you can have a regular list within a regular list, a regular list within a glossary list, and so on.
DL Element: Glossary Lists This list type, also known as a definition list, is used to present a list of items along with descriptive paragraphs.
This can be used for glossaries, but is also useful for presenting a named list of items and their meanings.
The items within the list are introduced by the two elements: <DT> -- The `Term' (a single line) <DD> -- The `Definition' (may be multiple lines) DL can take a single attribute, COMPACT, to signify that the list is small (or large) and should be rendered in a physically compact way.
This attribute is ignored by several browsers.
Example of DL Lists <dl> <dt> Department List </dt> <ul> <li> General Studies</li> <li> Computer Science </li> <li> Mechanical Engineering</li> 51  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT <li> Accountancy </li> <li> Chemical Engineering </li> <li> Hotel and Hotel Management </li> </ul> </dl> Department List • General Studies • Computer Science • Mechanical Engineering • Accountancy • Chemical Engineering • Hotel and Hotel Management A regular list This is a sequence of paragraphs, each of which may be preceded by a special mark, sequence number, or nothing at all.
The syntax is: <UL> <LI> General Studies</LI> <LI> Computer Science</LI> </UL> where the opening element defining the list type can be one of (Unordered List) UL -- A list of multi-line paragraphs, listed separately and usually marked by a bullet or similar symbol (Ordered List) OL -- A list of multi-line paragraphs, listed separately and ordered numerically.
MENU -- An Unordered List of smaller paragraphs, this is similar to UL but is formatted (if possible) in a more compact manner.
DIR -- A list of short elements, typically less than 20 characters in length.
These may be arranged in columns across the page, as opposed to one above the other.
This is browser dependent HR -- Horizontal Ruled Line The HR element is used to draw a horizontal dividing line completely across the screen.
This can be used to logically separate blocks of text, or to separate icon lists from the body of the text.
The HR element is empty.
52  MBE 817 MODULE 2 HR Attribute Extensions There are four major attribute extensions to the HR element.
These are widely supported by most browsers.
These attributes and their meanings are: SIZE="n" –specifies the vertical width, in pixels, of the dividing line (n is an integer).
WIDTH="n", or "n%" - specifies the horizontal width, in pixels or as a percentage of the display width, of the dividing line (n is an integer).
ALIGN="left", "right", "centre" – specifies the alignment of the dividing line on the page.
The default is centred.
NOSHADE – Draws the dividing line as a solid black bar -- the default is a shaded bar.
Some browsers also supports a COLOUR attribute to set the colour of the horizontal rule.
Here are some examples: <hr size=4 width=60%> <hr size=10 width=40> <hr size=10 width=40 align="left"> <hr size=10 width=40 align="left" noshade> <hr size = 5 width=20% align="right"> <hr size = 5 width=20% align="left" colour="green"> These are displayed as shown below: 3.3.2 FORMS Element for fill-out Forms The FORM element allows you to create a fill-out form.
FORM element and its associated sub-elements INPUT, TEXTAREA, and SELECT, allow for more sophisticated user input via fill-in FORMs.
These allow for author specified radio and checkbox buttons (using INPUT elements), single-line text input fields (again using INPUT), 53  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT selectable lists (via SELECT) and block text input regions (via TEXTAREA).
The data input into a FORM are sent to a server, the FORM attribute ACTION, specifies the URL to which the data should be sent.
Also, the FORM element can select the HTTP method by which the data are sent -- the GET HTTP method means that the data are appended to the URL like a query string, while the POST method means that the data are sent as a message body, much as data are sent from the server to the browser, but in the opposite direction.
An example of FORM is: <FORM ACTION="http://csd.edu.ng/research/cgi_bin" METHOD=POST> First entry field: <INPUT NAME="entry1"> <BR> Second entry field: <INPUT NAME="entry2" VALUE="bloop"> <BR> Third entry field: <INPUT NAME="entry3"> --- Select Option: <SELECT NAME="entry4"> <OPTION VALUE="no1">Frogs <OPTION VALUE="no2">Peaches <OPTION VALUE="no3">Cream <OPTION VALUE="no4">Newts </SELECT> To submit the query, press: <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Submit Query">.
<P> </FORM> The above FORM is rendered as follows: First text entry field: Fela Second entry field: Juice Third entry field: --- Select Option: Submit To submit the query, press: .
Note that you can use TABLEs to format the layout of the form.
Meanings of FORM Attributes The ACTION specifies the url to which the form results will be sent: this URL should point to a cgi-bin/ script or program.
If absent, the ACTION is taken to be the url of the current document -- that is, the data is returned to the same place from where the document came.
54  MBE 817 MODULE 2 The METHOD specifies the HTTP method to be used to submit the form information to the server.
METHOD can have two arguments: • GET (the default) - the form contents are appended to the url (after the question mark).
• POST - the form contents are sent to the server in the body of the message.
• The ENCTYPE attribute specifies the way in which the data are to be encoded.
This attribute is only relevant when METHOD="post", as the GET method only allows one type of encoding.
For "post", the two possible values are: • "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" (the default) - the form contents is encoded as if it were to be appended to the end of a URL (as in GET method).
• "multipart/form-data" - the data is send as a MIME multipart message.
The latter is useful for big forms, for forms that include files sent from the browser (using file upload), or for document written in non ASCII characters (for example, Japanese or Hebrew).
If you are writing your own FORMS you also need to write a cgi-bin script or program to interpret the FORM entries.
3.3.3 TABLES Before table was introduced ito HTML, the preformatted element <PRE> was used to create table-like layout.
This, of course, only worked for text, and did not work for images, and did not allow for elegant page designs.
TABLE Element The TABLE element denotes the range of the table, and uses attribute to define properties of it.
For example, the BORDER attribute indicates the size of the border to draw around the table and between each of the table's cells.
There are several other attributes besides BORDER.
The only two elements allowed inside a table are CAPTION, and TR.
CAPTION defines a table caption, and can take one attribute - ALIGN - to define where the caption should be placed.
Possible values are "top", "bottom" "left" and "right".
55  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT TR defines a Table Row - a table is made up of any number of any number of rows, depending on how you design it.
Each row in turn contains cells, denoted either by TD (table data) or TH (table header) elements.
The number of TD or TH elements in a given row defines the number of columns in the table, while the number of TR elements defines the number of rows.
In general, TD elements are used for data, while TH elements are used for row or column headings.
Note that you need to be careful that each row contains the same number of cells -- otherwise the table columns will not line up correctly.
Here is a simple table example, (a table with 3 rows and 4 columns) <TABLE BORDER="1"> <caption align="bottom">This is the Table Caption</caption> <TR> <TH>Value 1 <TH> Value 2 <TH> Value <TH> Name </TH> </TR> <TR> <TD> 4.02 </TD> <TD> 1.2 </TD> <TD> 3.2 </TD> <TD> James </TD> </TR> <TR> <TD> 0.44 </TD> <TD> 0.3 </TD> <TD> 7.2 </TD> <TD> Jide </TD> </TR> </TABLE> This table is displayed as: Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 Name 4.02 0..02 3.2 James 0.44 0.3 7.2 Jide Note TH, TD and TR should always have end tags.
Although the end tags are formally optional, some browsers may mess up the formatting of the table without end tags.
Always use end tags when handling a TABLE within a TABLE -- in this situation, the table parser gets hopelessly confused if you don't close your TH, TD and TR elements.
A default TABLE has no borders, by default; tables are drawn without border lines.
You need the BORDER attribute to draw the lines.
By default, a table is justified to the left margin.
The table be placed inside a DIV element with attribute ALIGN="centre".
56  MBE 817 MODULE 2 Most browsers support table alignment, using the ALIGN attribute.
Allowed values are "left", "right", or "centre", for example: <TABLE ALIGN="left">.
TABLE Attribute Extensions Head 1 Head 2 HTML supports additional TABLE element attributes.
These are BORDER, which takes numbers to set the width, in pixels, of the outside table border; CELLPADDING which takes numbers that defines the space, in pixels, between the cell contents and the cell borders (that is, padding within each cell of the table), while CELLSPACING defines the space between the cells (the width of the cell-cell border; the WIDTH attribute sets the width of the entire table.
This can be expressed as an absolute number (in pixels) or as a percentage width of the available space for the table -- 100% being as wide as possible.
Table Examples Here are some simple tables, showing how the WIDTH, BORDER, CELLPADDING and CELLSPACING attributes work: <table border width=80%> <TR> <TH> Value A <TH> Value B Value A Value B </TR> <TR> <TD> 2.11 <TD> 2.23 </TR> 2.11 2.23 </table> Value A Value B <table border=8> <TR> <TH> Value A <TH> Head 2 2.11 2.23 </TR> <TR> <TD> 2.11 <TD> 2.23 </TR> </table> <table border cellpadding=8> Head 1 Head 2 <TR> <TH> Head 1 <TH> Head 2 </TR> 4.11 4.23 <TR> <TD> 4.11 <TD> 4.23 </TR> </table> 57  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 4.11 4.23 <table border cellspacing=8> <TR> <TH> Head 1 <TH> Head 2 </TR> <TR> <TD> 4.11 <TD> 4.23 </TR> </table> COLSPAN and ROWSPAN attributes are used to stretch across into the next column and "drop down" to the next row respectively.
COLSPAN indicates how many columns (counting to the right) are occupied by the cell, while ROWSPAN indicated how many rows (hanging down) the cell "spans".
This is illustrated in the following example.
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH=40%> <TR> <TD> 1.1 <TD> 1.2 <TD> 1.3 <TD> 1.4 </TR> <TR> <TD> 2.1 <TD COLSPAN=2> 2.2 <TD> 2.4 </TR> <TR> <TD> 3.1 <TD> 3.2 <TD ROWSPAN=3> 3.3 <TD> 3.4 </TR> <TR> <TD> 4.1 <TD> 4.2 <TD> 4.4 </TR> <TR> <TD> 5.1 <TD> 5.2 <TD> 5.4 </TR> </TABLE> The above table is displayed as: 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 2.1 2.2 2.4 3.1 3.2 3.4 4.1 4.2 3.3 4.4 5.1 5.2 5.4 TABLES can contain TABLES Each table cell can in turn contain its own table.
This allows for more precise structuring of table layout, and of table borders.
The following example shows how this can work.
<TABLE WIDTH=80%> <TR> <TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN="centre"><H2>This is an Overall Title</h2></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD ALIGN="centre" VALIGN="centre"> <TABLE BORDER=4 CELLSPACING=8> 58  MBE 817 MODULE 2 <TR> <TD COLSPAN=2 ALIGN="centre">Subheading One </TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Item 1 </TD> <TD> Item 2 </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </TD> <TD WIDTH=20%> </TD> <TD ALIGN="centre" VALIGN="centre"> <TABLE BORDER=4 CELLSPACING=8> <TR> <TD COLSPAN=2 ALIGN="centre">Subheading Two </TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Item 3 </TD> <TD> Item 4 </TR> </TABLE> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> The above table is displayed as....
This is an Overall Title Subheading One Subheading Two Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 3.4 Hypertext Anchors An anchor is a piece of text or some other object (e.g.
an image) which marks the beginning and/or the end of a hypertext link.
The <A> element is used to mark that piece of text (or inline image), and to give its hyper-textual relationship to other documents.
The text between the opening and closing tags: <A attributes> ...text... </A> can be the start or destination (or both) of a link.
Here are some simple examples: <A HREF="http://www.
bidapolyporta.edu/st/help.htm">Click here for help</A> The string `Click her for help' is a hypertext link to the document `help.htm' located at the indicated URL (www.biapolyporta.edu) <A HREF="image.jpeg"> <IMG SRC="icon.gif"> </A> 59  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT The image `icon.gif' is a hypertext link to the image file located in the same directory as the currently accessed document.
This can allow you to use a small icon that links the user to a larger version of the same image.
Alternatively the anchor tag could have been <A HREF="document.html">, in which case the image acts like an icon button than links the user to the indicated HTML document.
<A NAME="freebook">textbook</A> The string `textbook' can be the target of a link.
This link is referenced via the form "help.htm#freebook" where help.htm' is the file that contains this anchor and `#freebook' is the anchor NAME.
If you are already in `help.htm' the file is implicit, so it can be left out.
Attributes for A and LINK The following sections describe the attributes appropriate to either Anchor or LINK elements.
The entries marked '*' are commonly used and should be well understood.
The other attributes are less common, and can be omitted at an introductory reading.
HREF (link to object) * NAME (link from object) * REL (relationship between objects) REV (relationship between objects) TITLE (TITLE of document) 1 HREF in Anchors The HREF attribute (optional) marks the anchor as the start of a link to another document or resource (e.g.
an image file), or to a particular place in another document.
The address of the referenced document can be specified by an absolute or partial URL: <A HREF="URL"> anchor </A> where URL is the URL of the document to be accessed.
For example HREF can use http: to access other HTML documents, images, etc.
or it can use ftp: or gopher:.
It can even indicate a telnet: connection.
Partial URLs are also possible when accessing any server, but are particularly common within document collections on http servers.
These are convenient for referencing documents that come from the same server as the current document - that is, the one currently being viewed.
In this case you need only specify the location of the 60  MBE 817 MODULE 2 document relative to the current one.
Here are some examples of the varied possibilities: http://www.web.edu/u1/staff/doc.htm HTML document served by the specified http server.
ftp://ftp.ncc.gov.ng/pub/doc/ncc.abj Compressed tar file accessed via anonymous ftp from the indicated site.
./../OtherStuff/thing.html A relative URL: the HTML document comes from the same http server but in the directory OtherStuff, found two levels up from the directory the current document was served from.
telnet://flober.rodent.edu A telnet session to the indicated machine Links to a Particular Place in a Document Particular places in an HTML document can be marked as specific destinations of hypertext links via the NAME attribute.
For example, suppose a place in a document is marked via the anchor: <A NAME="proj1">Project 1</A> From within this document we can create a hypertext link to this place by specifying the anchor: <A HREF="#proj1">(see Project 1)</A> If we wanted to reference this place from another document in the same directory we would put <A HREF="doc.html#proj1">(see Project 1)</A> and so on.
2 NAME attribute in an Anchor The NAME attribute (optional) marks the anchor as a possible destination of a link from another document, or from somewhere else within the same document.
The value assigned to a NAME should be a name token.
Example: <A NAME="point"> Cumulative grade point </A> 61  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT where the identifier point is used to NAME the anchored text as the possible target of a hypertext link.
The reference identifier can be an arbitrary string, but it must be unique within the document.
Targeting NAMEd Anchors Named anchors can be targeted, from within the same document, using HREF - you simply HREF the name, pre-pending a `#': <A HREF="#point"> Cumulative grade point </A> the NAMEd anchor can also be target from another document, simply by adding the NAME after the document URL.
For example, if the identifier ‘grade’ was located in the file `cgp.html' it could be referenced by either <A HREF="cgp.html#grade"> Student CGP </A> or <A HREF="http://www.bidapolyporta.edu.ng/computer/grade.htm l#grade"> Student CGP </A>.
Example of NAME <a href="#top">top of page</a>.
3 REL Attribute The REL attribute is used to give the relationship(s) described by the hypertext link, and describes the relationship of the destination of the link to the document containing the hypertext anchor - REL cannot be used unless an HREF is present.
The value for REL is a space-separated list of relationship values.
For example <A HREF="http://niger.edu/zungeru.htm" REL="index">Student</a> indicates that the link is to a document that is an index related to the current.
REV is the converse of REL.
Thus an anchor of the form <A HREF="http://niger.edu/zungeru.htm" REV="index">student</a> indicates that the document containing this anchor element is an index related to the document zungeru.htm.
62  MBE 817 MODULE 2 4 REV Attribute The REV attribute is used to give the relationship(s) described by the hypertext link, and describes the relationship of the document containing the anchor to the destination of the link to.
Consequently REL cannot be used unless an HREF is present.
The value for REV is a space-separated list of relationship values.
Example <A HREF=http://niger.edu/student.htm REV="index">student</a> indicates that the document containing this anchor element is an index related to the document student.htm.
REL is the converse of REV.
Thus an anchor of the form <A HREF="http://niger.edu/student.htm" REL="index">student</a> indicates that the document student.htm is an index related to the document containing this hypertext anchor.
5 TITLE attribute This attribute is optional, and is informational only.
If present its argument should be the TITLE of the document whose address is given by the HREF attribute.
This may be useful for the following: • A browser may display the title of the document prior to retrieving it.
The browser could display the titles as a margin note or in a small box while the mouse is over the anchor.
For example a browser could display the title as "pop-up" help when the mouse pointer hovers above a hypertext link.
• Putting a title in the link is a way to give them a meaningful label.
As some documents such as graphics, plain text and Gopher menus, do not come with a title themselves.
6 METHODS attribute This attribute is optional.
Its argument is a space separated list of HTTP METHODS supported by the object and accessible to the user.
These are more accurately given by HTTP protocol header messages (the server sends this information, along with the data requested, as soon as a URL is selected).
It is useful to include the information in advance in the anchor reference.
63  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.3.5 Line Breaks The line break element indicates that a new line is to start at the given point.
Meanwhile it is different from a paragraph element and should not be used in it place.
An example (and its rendering) is: <ADDRESS>Engr.
Dr. John Manukaji<BR> Deputy Rector<BR> The Federal Polytechnic<BR> P.M.B.
55, BIDA.<BR> Niger State, Nigeria </ADDRESS> <BR> is rendered as: Engr.
Dr. John Manukaji Deputy Rector The Federal Polytechnic P.M.B.
55, BIDA.
Niger State, Nigeria The CLEAR Attribute This is use to control text flow around embedded images.
It permits breaking of such that it goes to the next line alongside the image, or to the next free line below the image and flush with the left or right margins.
It can take the three values "left", "right" and "all".
CLEAR="left" causes the next text line to start down as soon as the left margin is cleared, CLEAR="right" causes the line to break and start when the right margin is cleared.
CLEAR="all" breaks down until both margins are cleared.
3.3.6 IMG (In-line Images) Element The IMG element allows an image file to be inserted within an HTML document.
This image file can be pictures, figures within a document and presented with the text.
However this element can not be used to include other HTML text within a given document.
Images can be included within a hypertext anchor: thus an image is made to behave as a button linked to other documents or resources.
The IMG element is empty, meaning there is no closing </IMG>.
It has several attributes: 64  MBE 817 MODULE 2 SRC="image_url" SRC give the URL of the image document (must attribute).
The naming scheme is the same as for hypertext links: thus SRC="ball.jpg" or SRC="../../ball.jpg".
ALT="alternative text" The ALT attribute lets you specify a text alternative to the image.
This attribute should always include particularly if the image is a button linked to some other resource.
If the image is unimportant, you can always put ALT="".
ALIGN="bottom", "middle", "top" ALIGN tells the browser how to align the image with the neighbouring text.
"Bottom" aligns the bottom of the image with the baseline of the text, and is the default.
"Middle" aligns the middle of the image with the baseline of text, and "top" aligns the top of the image with the top of the tallest item in the line.
This attribute is optional.
"left", "right" (HTML 3.2) HTML 3.2 supports left and right-aligned images.
In this case, the image "floats" to the left or right margin, with the text following the image element flowing around the image.
This attribute value is supported by all current browsers.
"absmiddle", "absbottom", "texttop", "baseline" (HTML 3.2) Netscape introduced these extra attributes, which work like "top", "middle" and "bottom" but which give additional vertical control of image placement, when the image flows with the text.
Example ALIGN="absmiddle" <p> <IMG SRC="polylogo.gif" ALT="[Poly Logo]" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE> Here is some text wrapped around the Polytechnic logo.
It is very interesting to show how the text is wrapped around the image given the ALIGN=absmiddle alignment attribute.
This is rendered: Here is some text related wrapped around the Polytechnic logo.
It is very interesting to show how the text is wrapped around the image given the ALIGN=absmiddle alignment attribute.
65  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT HEIGHT="n", WIDTH="n" HEIGHT and WIDTH specify the display height and width (in pixels) for the image -- if the picture does not fit, the browser should rescale the image to fit in the specified box.
An example is HEIGHT="30" WIDTH="50" ISMAP Most browsers also support the ISMAP attribute.
This attribute marks the image as an active image map.
This allows the user to click the mouse over the image and have different regions of the image cause different actions.
BORDER="n" If ISMAP is used, then the image is a hypertext link, and will be surrounded by a border to idicate this.
BORDER specifies the width of this border.
In particular, BORDER=0 specifies no border, which is rather good.
HSPACE="n", VSPACE="n" These attributes specify the horizontal and vertical space, in pixels, to leave between the image and the surrounding elements.
LOWSRC="URL" Specifies a low-resolution image file.
USEMAP="url" Specifies a URL pointing to a client side imagemap, that is , a MAP element.
For example, if the map element starts with <MAP NAME="niger">, then the map would be referenced as <IMG USEMAP="#niger"... >.
smaller, low-resolution file specified by LOWSRC and will then load the larger SRC-specified image file.
66  MBE 817 MODULE 2 Special Characters -- Character and Entity References Certain characters, such as the left bracket (<), ampersand (&), etc.
are reserved by HTML to represent special attributes such as the start of HTML elements, graphic characters, and so on.
More so, there are many ISO-Latin 1 characters that you may wish to include in a document, but are not trivially available on a standard keyboard.
HTML allows special referencing to represent these special characters.
These are indicated by either character references or entity references.
Character References These are composed of three parts: • a leading ampersand character, (&), • the decimal number corresponding to the character, preceded by a numbers symbol (#xxx) • a terminating semicolon (;).
For example, the character reference for less than symbol (<) is &#60;.
Note that this number depends on the character set being used - for example, in some character sets, the 60th character may not be the less than symbol.
Therefore, it is more convenient (and universal) to have a symbolic reference for a character, as opposed to an absolute numeric reference.
In HTML (and SGML) such references are called entity references.
Entity References Entity references are similar, but use symbolic names to represent the characters.
Entity references also have three parts: • a leading ampersand character, (&), • the name of the entity (in ascii characters) • a terminating semicolon (;).
Thus the entity reference for less than symbol (<) is &lt;.
Note: Not all the valid characters have corresponding entity references.
In these cases you need to use the direct numerical character references.
67  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT The ISO data table document lists all the ISO Latin-1 characters for character references an entity references.
3.4 Comments in HTML Comment lines are indicated by the special beginning tag <!-- This is a comment line --> placed at the beginning and end of EVERY line to be treated as a comment.
Comments do not nest, and the double- dash sequence "--" may not appear inside a comment except as part of the closing --> tag.
You must also make sure that there are no spaces in the start-of-comment string.
Thus, the line <!-- This is commented out --> is a valid comment line, but the line Also, < !-- This is commented out --> is not valid, since there is a space between the left angle bracket and the exclamation mark.
3.5 Style Sheets Style sheets are a language, separate from HTML.
They are used for specifying formatting and layout properties for a document.
It is used to display formatting information that can be stored as a separate piece of information, called a style sheet, and that the style sheet can then be applied to a document while it is being formatted for display.
For example, a style sheet could contain commands such as: • Format H3 headings in blue 12pt Verdana.
• Format Paragraphs in 12pt times roman, with a left and right margin of 0.5".
and so on.
CLASS attribute could be used to subdivide formatting instructions.
Thus <P CLASS="contents"> could be given characteristics different from <P CLASS="abstract">.
3.5.1 Specifying Stylesheets STYLE element is used to specify style in the HEAD.
For example, <HEAD> <STYLE HREF="../styles/style_form.css"> ... </HEAD> 68  MBE 817 MODULE 2 would give the URL of the style sheet to be loaded and used.
Here the extension CSS refers to Cascading Stylesheets, one of the methods currently in use.
3.5.2 Example Style Sheets As an example, the following is the style sheet used to format the different pages in this HTML documentation collection: BODY { font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; colour: black; background-colour: white; } P { margin-left: 5%; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif } PRE { margin-left: 5%; font-family: "courier new", courier, monospace; } H2,H3,H4 { colour: #669999; font-family: "arial black", arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; margin-left: 0%; } H3,H4,H5 { font family: “verdana”, Tahoma, courier, san-serif; font-weight: italics; margin-left: 5%}; } DIV.leftmarg { margin-left: 5%; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; } A {text-decoration: none; } A:active {colour: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline} A:visited {colour: #999999; } .note {colour: orange;} .warning {colour: red; font-weight: bold} Self Assessment Exercise 69  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Mention the major division of HTML document 4.0 CONCLUSION HTML is the bed rock of web design.
The knowledge of it is an essential resource for a web designer.
It becomes imperatively necessary for any meaningful web design because there is need for constant editing of some part of the code to ensure a perfect design especially when the need arises to reuse HTML code for another similar web design.
Although many automatic HTML authoring software exist, it is a needed knowledge for web designers.
5.0 SUMMARY Every element of a web design are embedded in HTML, therefore this unit took conscious effort to x-ray the various parts of a complete HTML code for a page.
The basic division of HTML (that is the Heading, Title and the body) were discussion in detail.
A quite number of HTML tags were explained, table and frames are essential components of web design; attention was adequately given to this.
Also style elements, fonts, headings, colour etc.
that give fancies and beauty to web design were elucidated in this unit.

They sometimes involve new attributes to already existing elements.
These attributes may not be the same for all browsers but most of the attributes are compatible with the common popular browsers.
The usage of these elements in our HTML document improves the efficiency of the web page and our proficiency of using HTML for web page design.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain and use the advance HTML elements • describe how to access resources on HTTP server • reference files via FTP using URL convention.
71  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Advanced HTML Elements In this unit, the fundamental elements which are frequently used are discussed FONT - Change font size/properties CENTRE - Centreed blocks BASEFONT - Set default font APPLET - Embedded Java Applets MARQUEE - Scrolling Text Marquee MAP - Client-side Imagemap FRAME - FRAME documents EMBED and NOEMBED - Embedded data objects MULTICOL - Multi-column text WBR and NOBR - Word Break and No Word Break Considered important to advanced web designer are references to other digital objects in a local or from a distant host.
These are also dealt with in some sufficient details.
3.2 FONT Element FONT element permits control of the size of the displayed font, when possible.
Font sizes are defined in a range from 1 to 7 (the default base value, or basefont, is 3).
You can then specify a change in font size using elements such as.
<P> This is <FONT SIZE=+2>resized +2</FONT> text.
<BR> This is <FONT SIZE=7>resized 7</FONT> text.
<BR> This is <FONT SIZE=-2>resized -2</FONT> text.
</P> which is rendered as: this is resized + 2 text.
this is resized 7 text.
this is resized -2 text.
Font size can be specified the relative to the current size (using + or -) or as an absolute size from 1 to 7.
3.2.1 FONT Element Enhancement The FACE attribute is used for specifying the typeface.
For example "FACE="bookman old style" would specify a bookman old style 72  MBE 817 MODULE 2 font.
The attribute is supported by most browsers.
The FACE names are usually taken from the Windows font manager, so user needs to be familiar with the FONT names and have the FONTs installed for this to work.
Clearly this will only work on machines that have the fonts installed locally.
Multiple fonts can be specified, separated by a comma - the browser looks through the font list, and chooses the first one it finds on the local system.
For example, FACE="arial,helvetica,times" will first try Arial, then Helvetica if Arial is not present, and finally try times- roman.
Here are some examples: <P> <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"> This is arial font</FONT> <BR> <FONT FACE="vwedana,courier new"> This is courier New font </FONT> <BR> <FONT FACE="tahoma,verdana"> This is Toahma font </FONT> </P> which is rendered as: this is arial font this is courier New font this is Tahoma font 3.2.2 COLOUR Enhancements FONT colour can also be controlled, using a COLOUR attribute.
For example, COLOUR="red" or COLOUR="#ff0000" requests red text font.
There are several supported colour names, but it is best to use RGB colour codes, as in COLOUR="#RRGGBB" Examples: <P> <FONT colour="blue"> This is blue colour</FONT> <BR> <FONT COLOUR="#33FF66">d This is green</FONT> text.
</P> which is rendered as: This is blue colour.
This is green colour.
3.3 CENTRE element The CENTRE element is used to centre align block of text, figures, etc.
73  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Example <CENTRE> this text is centreed this is displayed as: this test is centreed 3.4 APPLET Element Applets are programs, written in the Java programming language, that can be embedded within HTML document and executed.
This embedding is done via the APPLET element, while parameters required by the applet are passed with PARAM elements.
For example: <APPLET CODE="Blink.class" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=100> <PARAM NAME="organs" VALUE="String 23"> <PARAM NAME="pk3" VALUE="3.221"> <PARAM NAME="speed" VALUE="4"> </APPLET> The CODE gives the name of the application to run, WIDTH and HEIGHT give the space needed by it (in pixels) and PARAM elements, within APPLET, contain parameters to be passed to the applet.
Some other attributes like HSPACE and VSPACE (horizontal and vertical space to leave around applet, in pixels) can be used.
The presence of these attributes lets the applet communicate with JavaScript programs within the HTML document.
3.5 MAP element MAP specifies the regions of a mapped image and the associated URLs within a structure of the form: <MAP NAME="string" > <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="x1, y1, x2, y2" HREF="url_for_region"> ..... more shapes ... </MAP> where (x1,y1) are the upper-left hand coordinates and (x2,y2) the lower right-hand coordinates for the rectangle.
74  MBE 817 MODULE 2 Other possible shapes are <AREA SHAPE="circle" COORDS="x1, y1, r" HREF="url_for_region"> <AREA SHAPE="polygon" COORDS="x1, y1, x2, y2 ... xn, yn" HREF="url_for_region"> With the circle, (x1, y1) is the centre and r is the radius.
All coordinates are in pixels.
You can reference the map from within an IMG element using the USEMAP attribute.
For example: <IMG SRC="buly.gif" USEMAP="#string"> references the map named "string" listed above.
3.6 MULTICOL Element MULTICOL specifies text do be displayed in multicolumn format.
The COLS (= a number) attribute specifies how many columns to use, while GUTTER specifies the space to leave between the columns, in pixels.
WIDTH specifies the width of the collection of columns, either as an absolute width in pixels, or as a percentage of the available width.
Almost any BODY element can appear inside MULTICOL, but some, such as BLOCKQUOTE, can lead to odd formatting due to the browser's miscalculation of text lengths within the columns.
MULTICOL is allowed inside MULTICOL -- but the text may look ridiculous!
MULTICOL only works on Netscape Navigator 3.0 and greater.
Here is an example of MULTICOL: <MULTICOL COLS=2 WIDTH="100%"> <P> The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent.
Initially, the application of HTML on the World Wide Web was seriously restricted by its reliance on the ISO-8859-1 coded character set, which is appropriate only for Western European languages.
Despite this restriction, HTML has been widely used with other languages, 75  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT using other coded character sets or character encodings, at the expense of interoperability.
</P> <P> This document is meant to address the issue of the internationalisation (i18n, i followed by 18 letters followed by n) of HTML by extending the specification of HTML and giving additional recommendations for proper internationalisation support.
A foremost consideration is to make sure that HTML remains a valid application of SGML, while enabling its use with all languages of the world.

A foremost consideration is to make sure that HTML remains a valid application of SGML, while enabling its use with all languages of the world.
3.7 MARQUEE Element MARQUEE is used to create a scrolling text marquee.
For example: <MARQUEE ALIGN="top">Scrolling text </MARQUEE> creates a text marquee with the enclosed text scrolling along the frame.
MARQUEE element is supported by the Microsoft Internet Explorer 2 and later version 3.8 EMBED and NOEMBED Elements EMBED element (an empty element) is used to specify an arbitrary data object to be embedded within the document.
This object can be 76  MBE 817 MODULE 2 an audio file, a Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) data file, or even a spreadsheet.
The display of this object is accomplished by a browser plug-in, that must be downloaded by the user and added to the browser.
If a browser is not equipped with the required plug-in, the browser will usually warn the user that the embedded object cannot be displayed, and will display an empty box in its place.
The NOEMBED element, placed after an EMBED, can contain HTML markup to be displayed by a browser that does not understand EMBED.
Unfortunately, browsers that understand EMBED will ignore subsequent NOEMBED content, even if they is unable to display the embedded object.
EMBED can take a number of attributes.
The mandatory SRC attribute specifies the URL for the data to be embedded, while the optional TYPE attribute can specify the mime type for the data.
ALIGN defines the alignment of the applet on the page (with the usual values, as per the IMG element), while HIDDEN means that the embedded object should be entirely hidden from view (useful, for example, for playing audio files in the background).
HEIGHT and WIDTH specify the height and width of the embed region, and are mandatory.
The optional HSPACE and VSPACE attributes can be used to add spacer (in pixels) around the object.
EMBED can also take arbitrary attributes specific to the embedded plug-in.
Of course, to use these you have to know what they are!
Here is an example of EMBED <EMBED SRC="/path/file.cmx WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="200" > <NOEMBED> <P>Sorry, but you do not have a Corel CMX plugin for displaying Corel CMX image files.
Here is an alternate version, as a regular GIF <IMG SRC="/path/file.gif" HEIGHT="200" WIDTH="100" ALT="stupid example image"> </NOEMBED> EMBED and NOEMBED are supported by Netscape 2+ and Internet Explorer 3+.
77  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.9 NOBR and WBR Elements NOBR marks a block of text that should not contain line breaks -- line breaks are forbidden, on the text will be presented as a single line, without any word wrapping.
This is useful for text that you do not wish to broken at word spaces, regardless of the page layout.
You can use WBR elements inside NOBR to allow for optional word breaks.
Inside NOBR, a WNR marks a place where line breaking is allowed.
WBR is thus lie a conditional BR element, in that it does not force a line break, but instead permits one where a break would otherwise be forbidden.
Here is an example of the use of WBR and NOBR <NOBR> There are no line breaks in this line, even though it is incredibly long and tedious.
This probably goes right of the end of the display, only <WBR> breaks this lonely element, sitting alone, near the end of the line.
</NOBR> which is displayed as (between the two horizontal rules): There are no line breaks in this line, even though it is incredibly long and tedious.
This probably goes right of the end of the display, only breaks this lonely element, sitting alone, near the end of the line.
3.10 URLs for HTTP Servers As most HTML is served from HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) servers, this is the most common URL you are likely to see.
Consider the following examples: http://www.w3.org/hypertext/Addressing/ http://www.openversity.org:1212/home.html http://www.openversity.org/nigeria/books/html4ed/outline.htm l The first part http: means that the documents are served by an http server.
The double slash (//) means that the next part is the name of the server.
This can have two parts, the Internet address of the server (essential) and the port number the server listens at (optional).
In the first example www.w3.org the port number is not specified, so the browser assumes the default number for http servers (Port 80).
In the 78  MBE 817 MODULE 2 second case URL tells the browser that the http server is at port 1212.
The port is specified after the server name, separated by a colon.
The final part specifies the file or resource being requested: this is separated from the address+port number pair by a slash (/).
The resource is specified by a path relative to to the root directory of the server.
Thus, in the third example, the document outline.html at www.openversity.org is found in the subdirectory .../nigeria/books/html4ed/ with respect to the HTTP server root.
3.10.1 Special HTTP URL Paths A file or resource specification beginning with /cgi-bin/ is usually special: in the case of many servers, the cgi-bin string indicates a special reference to programs or scripts that can be executed by the server.
3.10.2 HTTP Directory Listings If the file name is left out, the server tries to send you a default directory file.
Usually this is a file named "index.html", but this default name can be modified (or turned off) by the server configuration files.
You should always include the trailing slash if you are referencing a directory, for example /directory/ as otherwise the server will think you are requesting a file named directory as opposed to information about the directory.
3.10.3 Passing Parameters to the Server The HTTP protocol supports the passing of arguments to the server.
The general format is to postpone the arguments to the URL, separated from the URL by a question mark (?).
The reason for this notation is simple: most requests of this type are requests to search a database, and the passed arguments are the search parameters.
The general form is as follows: http://some.site.edu/cgi-bin/foo?arg1+arg2+arg3 There are two things to note cgi-bin The cgi-bin directory is a special location known to the server, containing executable programs or scripts.
The reason is obvious: argument have to be passed to something that can act on those arguments, implying a program or script.
The cgi-bin directory 79  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT contains programs/scripts that interface with the WWW - a URL can access and pass argument to programs/scripts in this directory, and these programs/scripts can in turn act on the arguments and return information, documents, etc.
to the browser.
passed arguments Arguments are appended to the URL, separated from it by a question mark (?).
One can also send more than one argument, separated by a plus sign (+).
Thus in the above the program/script foo is sent three arguments, arg1, arg2 and arg3.
3.10.4 Personal HTML directories On many Web servers, users can have html documents in their own home directories, distinct from the special area reserved for administrative Web pages.
The procedure for doing this depends on some degree on the server.
In general the user needs to create a special file, placed in their home directory, that specifies where their personal 'root' html directory is.
You then access files in this personal 'root' area by using a special URL path of the form: ~your_login_name/path/file, where the tilde (~) indicates that this is a 'personal' Web area.
Again, this is a server-specific feature, and not all servers do this, or have this turned on.
Ask your server manager for details about your local implementation.
3.11 FTP URLs Files can be referenced via FTP using the URL convention.
The general form is: ftp://Internet.address.edu/file/path/file.txt This form makes an anonymous FTP request for the indicated file from the indicated machine.
If you specify a directory instead of a file (by requesting a URL such as ftp://Internet.address.edu/file/path/, most browsers will give you a list of the directory contents and allow you to select files, or other directories.
NOTE -- If a URL points to a directory it must end with the slash character.
This tells the URL that the desired target is a directory (i.e.
the directory path/) and not a file.
80  MBE 817 MODULE 2 You can access non-anonymous ftp resources by specifying, within the URL, both the username and password of the account you wish to access For example: ftp://open_versity:abuja@Internet.nigeria.edu.ng/path/ball.gif allows you to access files on machine Internet.nigeria.edu belonging to user open_versity (password abuja).
You can omit the password if you wish -- most browsers will then attempt the connection, but will prompt the user to type a password.
Indeed, it is best to omit the password -- otherwise everybody who accesses this document will be able to read the HTML and know open_versity’s password!
3.12 FRAME Element The FRAME document lets you specify a display as having of a number of independent viewing frames, each of which can contain its own HTML document.
A multi-frame document does not contain a BODY element, instead it contains a FRAMESET element, which defines the sizes, locations and initial contents of the individual FRAMES.
Example: <FRAMESET ROWS="10%,80%,10%"> <FRAME NAME="window1" SRC="doc1.html"> <FRAMESET COLS="50%,50%"> <FRAME NAME="Frame1" SRC="doc2.html"> <FRAME NAME="Frame2" SRC="buly.html"> </FRAMESET> <FRAME NAME="lowerframe" SRC="doc3.html"> <NOFRAMES> <BODY BACKGROUND.> display this if the browser does not understand FRAMESET </NOFRAMES> </FRAMESET> The example above divides the display into three slices, the top and bottom are thin (10% of the display height), and the remaining 80% for the middle frame.
The first slice is named window1 and it is initially loaded with the document doct1.html.
The FRAME element defines the initial content of the cell (frames may be empty, in which case you leave out the SRC).
The second slice is divided, by columns, into two frames named Frame1 and Frame2 and they are 81  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT loaded with documents doc2.html and buly.html.
The bottom frame is named lowerframe, and it is loaded with doc3.html document.
A hypertext anchor can be instructed to target the returned data to a particular frame once the frame is named.
TARGET attribute is used this purpose.
Example: <A HREF="studentInfor.html TARGET="frame2"> Student Information</A> The browser will place the data retrieved in the window named "frame2", regardless of where the link was selected.
From the example above, if a browser does not support frames, it will ignore all the frame elements, and will display the content of NOFRAMES.
Conversely, if a browser does understand FRAMEs, it will ignore the content of NOFRAMES entirely.
However, programming FRAMEs is a more complicated than regular documents, so as much as possible, avoid creating pages with multiple framed areas.
If you do, you may be losing a lot of space with the frame borders.
4.0 CONCLUSION Some high level skill is needed in the design of a standard and proficient dynamic web site.
Advanced knowledge of HTML will help to deploy a good and acceptable web page to client in standard organisation of international repute.
Although this unit is not an en end in itself but it is a means to an end for candidates that has flare for quality web design.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit elucidate some vital elements that are used in advanced web design.
Elements like FONT, COLOUR, CENTRE, APPLET etc add lustre to web designer’s page.
More so one of the major requirements of web design is ability to access remote digital contents; the discussions on the use of URL on HTTP server and FTP provide the in-depth knowledge of remote access to digital objects on the Internet using a standard web browser.
Proper understanding of the structure is recommended for the students studying this unit.

However, web navigation can also provide an interactive experience that is termed "dynamic".
Content (text, images, form fields, etc.)
on a web page can change, in response to different contexts or conditions.
In this interactive experience, web pages must use presentation technology called, rich interfaced pages.
The common programming task, known as scripting, is used to connecting diverse pre-existing components to accomplish a new related task.
Those languages which are suited to scripting are typically called scripting languages.
Scripting Languages like JavaScript or ActionScript, used for Dynamic HTML (DHTML) and Flash technologies, are frequently used to orchestrate media types (sound, animations, changing text, etc.)
of the presentation.
The scripting also allows use of remote scripting, a technique by which the DHTML page requests additional information from a server, using a hidden Frame, XMLHttpRequests, or a Web service.
84  MBE 817 MODULE 3 Many languages for this purpose have common properties: they favor rapid development over efficiency of execution; they are normally implemented with interpreters rather than compilers; and they are strong at communicating with program components written in other languages.
Many scripting languages emerged as tools for executing one-off tasks, particularly in system administration.
One way of looking at scripts is as "glue" that puts several components together; thus they are widely used for creating graphical user interfaces or executing a series of commands that might otherwise have to be entered interactively through keyboard at the command prompt.
The operating system usually offers some type of scripting language by default, widely known as a shell script language.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain what a scripting language is • list and explain the various types of scripting languages • explain Job Control Languages (JCL) and Shells • explain the concept of GUI scripting • Describe server-side and client-side web programming languages • List and explain text processing and general purpose dynamic languages; and • Explain embeddable languages.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Scripting Programming Languages The term scripting language is not technical, though embedding and dependence on a larger system are usually criteria.
The name 'script' is derived from the written script of the performing arts, in which dialogueue is set down to be interpreted by actors and actresses--the programs.
Early script languages were often called batch languages or job control languages.
Scripting languages can also be compiled, but because interpreters are simpler to write than compilers, they are interpreted more often than they are compiled.
Scripting languages, commonly called scripting programming languages or script languages, are computer programming languages that are typically interpreted and can be typed directly from a keyboard.
Thus, scripts are often distinguished from programs, because programs are converted permanently into binary executable files (i.e.
machine code) before they are run.
Although,there are some interpreters which 85  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT convert the script into some suitable binary form, for efficiency reasons, but this is transparent to the user.
Normally, scripts remain in their original form and are interpreted command-by-command each time they are run.
Scripts were created to shorten the traditional edit-compile-link- run process.
In a non-scripting language, managing memory and variables, and creating data structures tends to consume more programmer effort and lines of code to complete a given task.
The scripter typically has less flexibility to optimise a program for speed or to conserve memory.
For this reason, it is usually faster to program in a scripting language; and script files are typically much smaller than equivalent C program files.
3.2 Type of scripting languages Scripting language started simply as batch file in DOS to control the starting of the system using some commandline.
But now it has grown into numerous types.
Some of these are mentioned below.
3.3 Job Control Languages and Shells A Job Control Languages (JCL) is a special command language used for batch processing.
They are to identify jobs and state their requirement to nucleus (that is kernel, or supervisor or executive or core).
That is, they are programming languages used for communicating the operating system.
Most statements in the languages are directives - requiring immediate execution and are handled by command language interpreter.
They are also called monitor languages.
Many of these languages' interpreters double as command line interfaces such as the Unix shell or the MS-DOS COMMAND.COM.
Others, such as AppleScript, add scripting capability to computing environments lacking a command-line interface.
Some common examples of JCL are AppleScript, DCL (on OpenVMS), JCL, JScript via Windows Script Host, VBScript via Windows Script Host, Windows PowerShell.
3.4 GUI Scripting With the advent of Graphical user interfaces came a specialised kind of scripting language for controlling a computer.
These languages interact with the same graphic windows, menus, buttons etc.
that a system generates.
These languages are typically used to automate repetitive actions or configure a standard state.
In principle, they could be used to control any application running on a GUI-based computer; but, in practice, the support for such languages depend on the application and 86  MBE 817 MODULE 3 operating system.
Such languages are also called "macro languages" when control is through keyboard interaction.
Examples are AutoHotkey, AutoIt, Eggplant, Expect, Automator 3.5 Application Specific Languages Many large application programs include an idiomatic scripting language tailored to the needs of the application user.
Likewise, many computer game systems use a custom scripting language to express the programmed actions of non-player characters and the game environment.
Languages of this sort are designed for a single application; and, while they may superficially resemble a specific general-purpose language (e.g.
QuakeC, modelled after C), they have custom features that distinguish them.
Examples of application specific scripting languages are MATLAB, AutoLISP, Action Code Script, HyperTalk, LotusScript, MAXScript, Visual Basic for Applications 3.6 Web Programming Languages An important type of application-specific scripting language is one used to provide custom functionality to dynamic web pages.
Such languages are specialised for web applications and other Internet uses.
However, most modern web programming languages are powerful enough for general-purpose programming.
There are two ways to create this kind of interactive experiences; these are Server-side and Client –side scripting.
The result of either technique is described as a dynamic web page, and both may be used simultaneously.
Client-side Client-side scripting is used to change interface behaviours within a specific web page, in response to mouse or keyboard actions or at specified timing events.
In this case the dynamic behaviour occurs within the presentation.
The Client-side dynamic content is generated on the client's computer.
The web server retrieves the page and sends it as is.
The web browser then processes the code embedded in the page (normally JavaScript) and displays the page to the user.
The innerHTML property (or write command) can illustrate the "Client- side dynamic page" generation: 2 distinct pages, A and B, can be regenerated (by an "event response dynamic") as document.innerHTML = A and document.innerHTML = B; or "on load dynamic" by document.write(A) and document.write(B).
87  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT The problems with client-side dynamic pages are: • some browsers do not support the language or they do not support all aspects (like write command and innerHTML property) of the language.
• the information cannot be stored anywhere but the user's computer, so it cannot really be used for statistics gathering.
• search engines are not able to run client-side languages and cannot crawl links generated by them.
• some users have scripting languages disabled in their browsers due to possible security threats.
Ajax is a newer web development technique for creating client-side dynamic Web pages.
Google Maps is an example of a web application that uses Ajax techniques.
Server-side Using server-side scripting to change the supplied page source between pages, adjusting the sequence or reload of the web pages or web content supplied to the browser.
Server responses may be determined by such conditions as data in a posted HTML form, parameters in the URL, the type of browser being used, the passage of time, or a database or server state.
Server-side dynamic content is a little bit more complicated.
1.
The browser sends an HTTP request.
2.
The server retrieves the requested script or program.
3.
The server executes the script or program which typically outputs an HTML web page.
The program usually obtains input from the query string or standard input which may have been obtained from a submitted web form.
4.
The server sends the HTML output to the client's browser.
Server-side has many possibilities for dynamic content, but the use of it can be a strain on low-end, high-traffic machines.
Some web sites use the Robots Exclusion Standard to keep web crawlers from accessing dynamic pages for this reason.
If not properly secured, server-side scripts could be exploited to gain access to a machine.
3.7 Text Processing Languages The processing of text-based records is one of the oldest uses of scripting languages.
Text-based HTML editors evolved from basic text editors, but include additional tools specifically geared toward handling 88  MBE 817 MODULE 3 code.
In text processing, text (source) editors intended for use with HTML usually provide syntax highlighting.
Templates, toolbars and keyboard shortcuts may quickly insert common HTML elements and structures.
Wizards, tooltip prompts and auto-completion may help with common tasks.
Text HTML editors commonly include either built-in functions or integration with external tools for such tasks as source and version control, link-checking, code checking and validation, code cleanup and formatting, spell-checking, uploading by FTP or WebDAV, and structuring as a project.
Text editors require user understanding of HTML and any other web technologies the designer wishes to use like CSS, JavaScript and server- side scripting languages.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE List the types of scripting languages you have studied in this unit.
4.0 CONCLUSION Many standard web applications require proper knowledge of dynamic web programming.
Dynamic programming requires combination of may application which are embedded in HTML tags.
A thorough knowledge of scripting languages, database management applications, animations, graphics applications, and HTML authoring packages is required in dynamic web application design and development.
Scripting languages are very high level languages that can easily be interpreted by many standard browsers at a very high speed.
Residual knowledge of early operation of batch processing and job control languages can easily help a prepare mind to write a meaningful dynamic web applications.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we had surveyed briefly the various scripting languages required in dynamic web design.
This should have help students to have a prior knowledge of various applications on scripting languages.
In dynamic web design, this scripting languages that look like dispatches of programming languages are normally embedded in HTML documents to carry out various operations like animations, form validation and various environmental activities on the web.

The most powerful and common scripting language is JavaScript.
JavaScript is a scripting language often used for client-side web development.
It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions.
JavaScript was influenced by many languages and was designed to have a similar look to Java, but be easier for non- programmers to work with.
The language is best known for its use in websites (as client-side JavaScript), but is also used to enable scripting access to objects embedded in other applications.
Despite the name, JavaScript is unrelated to the Java programming language; though both have a common debt to C syntax.
The language was renamed from LiveScript in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their browser, which was dominant at the time.
JavaScript semantics is much more similar to the Self programming language.
91  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the concept of JavaScript • describe variable declaration in JavaScript • explain the use conditional statements in JavaScript • list and explain the use of basic operators.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 JavaScript JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the Internet, and works in all major browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape, and Opera.
JavaScript runs on the client rather than the server.
It can respond to user actions quickly, making an application feel more responsive.
Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions which HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes.
Applications such as Gmail attempt to take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server.
The wider trend of AJAX programming similarly seeks to exploit JavaScript's strengths.
JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language with a syntax loosely based on C. Unlike C, the language has no input or output constructs of its own.
Where C relies on standard I/O libraries, a JavaScript engine relies on a host environment into which it is embedded.
There are many such host environment applications, of which web technologies are the best-known examples.
These are examined first.
3.2 Uses of JavaScript The primary use of JavaScript is to write functions that are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.
Some simple examples of this usage are • JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML authors are normally not programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very simple syntax!
Almost anyone can put small "snippets" of code into their HTML pages • JavaScript can put dynamic text into an HTML page - A JavaScript statement like this: document.write("<h1>" + name + "</h1>") can write a variable text into an HTML page 92  MBE 817 MODULE 3 • JavaScript can react to events – it can change images as the mouse cursor moves over them when a page has finished loading.
This effect is often used to draw the user's attention to important links displayed as graphical elements.
• Opening or popping up a new window with programmatic control over the size, position and 'look' of the new window (i.e.
whether the menus, toolbars, etc.
are visible).
• Validation of web form input values to make sure that they will be accepted before they are submitted to the server.
• JavaScript can read and write HTML elements - it reads and changes the content of an HTML element • JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser – that is, it can be used to detect the visitor's browser, and - depending on the browser - load another page specifically designed for that browser • JavaScript can be used to create cookies - it is used to store and retrieve information on the visitor's computer 3.3 How to Put JavaScript in a Web Page To insert a JavaScript into an HTML page, we use the <script> tag (also use the type attribute to define the scripting language).
So, the <script type="text/javascript"> and </script> tells where the JavaScript starts and ends: <html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> ... </script> </body> </html> The word document.write is a standard JavaScript command for writing output to a page.
By entering the document.write command between the <script type="text/javascript"> and </script> tags, the browser will recognise it as a JavaScript command and execute the code line.
In this case the browser will write Hello World!
to the page: <html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> document.write("Hello World!")
</script> 93  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT </body> </html> Note: If we had not entered the <script> tag, the browser would have treated the document.
Write ("Hello World!")
command as pure text, and just write the entire line on the page.
More so the use of semi colon as in traditional Java programming is optional, it is only required when you want to put more than one statement on a line.
JavaScript can be place both in the Head and body sections on a HTML document.
JavaScripts in a page will be executed immediately while the page loads into the browser.
Scripts in the head section: will be executed when they are called, or when an event is triggered, go in the head section.
When you place a script in the head section, it is loaded before anyone uses it.
Scripts in the body section: Scripts to be executed when the page loads go in the body section.
When you place a script in the body section it generates the content of the page.
Meanwhile unlimited number of scripts can be placed in document, so one can have scripts in both the body and the head section.
Using an External JavaScript Sometimes one might want to run the same JavaScript on several pages, without having to write the same script on every page.
To simplify this, the script can be written in an external file.
Save the external JavaScript file with a .js file extension.
Note: The external script cannot contain the <script> tag!
To use the external script, point to the .js file in the "src" attribute of the <script> tag: <html> <head> <script src="xxx.js"></script> </head> <body> </body> </html> 94  MBE 817 MODULE 3 3.4 JavaScript Variables A variable is a "container" for information you want to store.
A variable's value can change during the script.
You can refer to a variable by name to see its value or to change its value.
Rules for variable names.
• Variable names are case sensitive • They must begin with a letter or the underscore character Note: JavaScript is case-sensitive!
A variable named strname is not the same as a variable named STRNAME!
Declare a Variable Variable can be created using with the var statement: var strname = some value You can also create a variable without the var statement: strname = some value Assign a Value to a Variable You can assign a value to a variable like this: var strname = "varsity" Or like this: Strnam = “varsity” The variable name is on the left side of the expression and the value you want to assign to the variable is on the right.
Now the variable "strname" has the value "varsity".
Lifetime of Variables When a variable is declared within a function, the variable can only be accessed within that function.
The variable is destroyed after the execution of the function.
These variables are called local variables.
There can be local variables with the same name in different functions, because each is recognised only by the function in which it is declared.
If a variable is declared outside a function, all the functions on the page can access it.
The lifetime of these variables starts when they are declared, and ends when the page is closed.
95  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.5 Conditional Statements in JavaScript Very often, when writing a program, different actions are performed base on different decisions.
This can be done by the use of conditional statements.
The conditional statements in JavaScript are: • if statement - use this statement if you want to execute some code only if a specified condition is true • if...else statement - use this statement if you want to execute some code if the condition is true and another code if the condition is false • if...else if....else statement - use this statement if you want to select one of many blocks of code to be executed If Statement You should use the statement if you want to execute some code only if a specified condition is true.
Syntax if (condition) { code to be executed if condition is true } Note that if is written in lowercase letters.
Using uppercase letters (IF) will generate a JavaScript error!
Example <script type="text/javascript"> //Write a "Good morning" greeting if //the time is less than 10 var d=new Date() var time=d.getHours() if (time<10) { document.write("<b>Good morning</b>") } </script> 96  MBE 817 MODULE 3 If...else Statement If you want to execute some code if a condition is true and another code if the condition is not true, use the if....else statement.
Syntax if (condition) { code to be executed if condition is true } else { code to be executed if condition is not true } Example <script type="text/javascript"> //If the time is less than 10, //you will get a "Good morning" greeting.
//Otherwise you will get a "Good day" greeting.
var d = new Date() var time = d.getHours() if (time < 10) { document.write("Good morning!")
} else { document.write("Good day!")
} </script> If...else if...else Statement You should use ‘the’ if....else statement if you want to select one of many sets of lines to execute.
Syntax if (condition1) { code to be executed if condition1 is true } 97  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT else if (condition2) { code to be executed if condition2 is true } else { code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are not true } Example <script type="text/javascript"> var d = new Date() var time = d.getHours() if (time<10) { document.write("<b>Good morning</b>") } else if (time>10 && time<16) { document.write("<b>Good day</b>") } else { document.write("<b>Hello World!</b>") } </script> 3.6 JavaScript Operators Operators are symbols used in JavaScript to evaluate operands in a statement of expression.
The various operators used in JavaScript are discussed below: 3.6.1 Arithmetic Operators Operator Description Example Result + Addition x=2 y=2 x+y 4 - Subtraction x=5 y=2 x-y 3 * Multiplication x=5 98  MBE 817 MODULE 3 y=4 x*y 20 / Division 15/5 3 5/2 2.5 % Modulus (division remainder) 5%2 1 10%8 2 10%2 0 ++ Increment x=5 x++ x=6 -- Decrement x=5 x-- x=4 3.6.2 Assignment Operators Operator Example Arithmetic Equivalent = x=y x=y += x+=y x=x+y -= x-=y x=x-y *= x*=y x=x*y /= x/=y x=x/y %= x%=y x=x%y 3.6.3 Comparison Operators Operator Description Example == is equal to 5==8 returns false === is equal to (checks for both value and type) x=5 y="5" x==y returns true x===y returns false != is not equal 5!=8 returns true > is greater than 5>8 returns false < is less than 5<8 returns true >= is greater than or equal to 5>=8 returns false <= is less than or equal to 5<=8 returns true 99  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.6.4 Logical Operators Operator Description Example && and x=6 y=3 (x < 10 && y > 1) returns true || or x=6 y=3 (x==5 || y==5) returns false !
not x=6 y=3 !
(x==y) returns true 3.6.5 String Operator A string is most often text, for example "Hello World!".
To stick two or more string variables together, use the + operator.
txt1="What a very" txt2="nice boy!"
txt3=txt1+txt2 The variable txt3 now contains "What a very nice boy!".
To add a space between two string variables, insert a space into the expression, OR in one of the strings.
txt1="What a very" txt2="nice boy!"
txt3=txt1+" "+txt2 or txt1="What a very " txt2="nice boy!"
txt3=txt1+txt2 The variable txt3 now contains "What a very nice boy!"
3.6.6 Conditional Operator JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
100  MBE 817 MODULE 3 Syntax variablename=(condition)?value1:value2 Example greeting=(visitor=="PRES")?
"Dear President ":"Dear " If the variable visitor is equal to PRES, then put the string "Dear President " in the variable named greeting.
If the variable visitor is not equal to PRES, then put the string "Dear” into the variable named greeting.
SELF- ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Enumerate the uses of JavaScript 4.0 CONCLUSION JavaScript basics, studied in this unit, are very much needed to develop a standard dynamic web page.
Although there are many other scripting languages, JavaScript remains the most powerful and the most popularly used scripting language.
More so the syntax is similar to many other ones, it is therefore preferred as a standard for teaching and learning Scripting language programming in this course.
5.0 SUMMARY In this study unit, the general background of JavaScript language has been explored; the various uses were outlined; the methods of variable declaration were discussed; various conditional statements were studied.
More so, all the five operators viz: arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, string and conditional operators were carefully explained and illustrated.
Note were used to lay emphasis on possible causes of errors in web design using JavaScript.
With interest and frequent practices, candidates can develop themselves to write good dynamic web pages.

To do a thorough and efficient web design it must be understood beyond the level of definition, variable declaration and JavaScript operators.
Although these form a vital building block that students must know as foundation, it must be taken to a higher level for advanced students.
This unit helps the students to study deeper and write a more efficient code when designing a web page.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the use of popup boxes • write efficient JavaScript functions • perform repetitive operation using JavaScript loops • explain Break and Continue statements in JavaScript.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Advanced JavaScript Advance JavaScript is geared towards writing a more powerful Java code in a HTML document to improve the efficiency of web design.
103  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT This is achieve in this unit through an in-depth study of some key features that come with JavaScript.
Some of these features are Popup boxes, JavaScript functions, loops break and continue statements.
Students can exploit other advanced features from references for further studies list at the end of this unit.
3.2 Popup Boxes Popup boxes are used in JavaScript to ensure that the source of a particular information is from the user and not just accidentally accepted by the system during the run-time.
In JavaScript, three kinds of popup boxes are possible: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.
Alert Box An alert box is often used if one wants to make sure information comes through to the user.
When an alert box pops up, the user clicks have to click "OK" to proceed.
Syntax: alert("sometext") Alert box may have line breaks alert(“sometext</br>”) Confirm Box A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true.
If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.
Syntax: Confirm("sometext") Prompt Box A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.
When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.
If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value.
If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.
104  MBE 817 MODULE 3 Syntax: prompt("sometext","defaultvalue") 3.3 Java Script Functions A function is a reusable code-block that will be executed by an event, or when the function is called.
To keep the browser from executing a script when the page loads, you can put your script into a function.
A function contains codes that will be executed by an event or by a call to that function.
It can be called anywhere call within the page (or even from other pages if the function is embedded in an external .js file).
Functions can be defined both in the <head> and in the <body> section of a HTML document.
However, to assure that the function is read/loaded by the browser before it is called, it could be wise to put it in the <head> section.
Example <html> <head> <script type="text/javascript"> function displaymessage() { alert("Hello World!")
} </script> </head> <body> <form> <input type="button" value="Click me!"
onclick="displaymessage()" > </form> </body> </html> If the line: alert("Hello world!!")
in the example above had not been put within a function, it would have been executed as soon as the line was loaded.
Now, the script is not executed before the user hits the button.
We have added an on Click event to the button that will execute the function display message () when the button is clicked.
3.3.1 Function Definition The syntax for creating a function is: 105  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT function functionname(var1,var2,...,varX) { some code } var1, var2, etc are variables or values passed into the function.
The { and the } defines the start and end of the function.
Note A function with no parameters must include the parentheses () after the function name: function functionname() { some code } Note: Do not forget about the importance of capitals in JavaScript!
The word function must be written in lowercase letters, otherwise a JavaScript error occurs!
Also note that you must call a function with the exact same capitals as in the function name.
3.3.2 The return Statement The return statement is used to specify the value that is returned from the function.
So, functions that are going to return a value must use the return statement.
Example The function below should return the product of two numbers (a and b): function prod(a,b) { x=a*b return x } When you call the function above, you must pass along two parameters: product=prod(2,3) The returned value from the prod() function is 6, and it will be stored in the variable called product.
106  MBE 817 MODULE 3 3.4 Java Script Loops Loops in JavaScript are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times.
Very often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again in a row.
Instead of adding several almost equal lines in a script we can use loops to perform a task like this.
In JavaScript there are two different kind of loops • FOR - this loops through a block of code a specified number of times • WHILE - this loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true 3.4.1 For Loop The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.
Syntax for (var=startvalue;var<=endvalue;var=var+increment) { code to be executed } Example The example below defines a loop that starts with i=0.
The loop will continue to run as long as i is less than, or equal to 10. i will increase by 1 each time the loop runs.
<html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> var i=0 for (i=0;i<=10;i++) { document.write("The number is " + i) document.write("<br />") } </script> </body> </html> 107  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Note: The increment parameter could also be negative, and the <= could be any comparing statement.
Result The number is 0 The number is 1 The number is 2 The number is 3 The number is 4 The number is 5 The number is 6 The number is 7 The number is 8 The number is 9 The number is 10 3.4.2 While Loop The while loop is used when you want the loop to execute and continue executing while the specified condition is true.
while (var<=endvalue) { code to be executed } NoteThe <= could be any comparing statement.
Example The example below defines a loop that starts with i=0.
The loop will continue to run as long as i is less than, or equal to 5. i will increase by 1 each time the loop runs.
<html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> var i=0 while (i<=5) { document.write("The number is " + i) document.write("<br />") i=i+1 } </script> </body> </html> 108  MBE 817 MODULE 3 Result The number is 0 The number is 1 The number is 2 The number is 3 The number is 4 The number is 5 The do...while Loop The do...while loop is a variant of the while loop.
This loop will always execute a block of code ONCE, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the specified condition is true.
This loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code is executed before the condition is tested.
do { code to be executed } while (var<=endvalue) Example <html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> var i=0 do { document.write("The number is " + i) document.write("<br />") i=i+1 } while (i<0) </script> </body> </html> Result The number is 0 109  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.5 JavaScript Break and Continue Commands There are two special statements that can be used inside loops: break and continue.
Break The break command will break the loop and continue executing the code that follows after the loop (if any).
Example <html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> var i=0 for (i=0;i<=10;i++) { if (i==3){break} document.write("The number is " + i) document.write("<br />") } </script> </body> </html> Result The number is 0 The number is 1 The number is 2 Continue The continue command will break the current loop and continue with the next value.
Example <html> <body> <script type="text/javascript"> var i=0 for (i=0;i<=5;i++) { if (i==3){continue} document.write("The number is " + i) document.write("<br />") 110  MBE 817 MODULE 3 } </script> </body> </html> Result The number is 0 The number is 1 The number is 2 The number is 4 The number is 5 SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Before you conclude this unit, outline the popup boxes you have studied and write out their syntaxes.
4.0 CONCLUSION It is shown clearly in this unit that some documents that would have taken a very lengthy coding can be handled in a more concise way by these advanced features that comes with JavaScript, this will make the design more efficient.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit had given a more in-debt study of the use us JavaScript in dynamic web design.
Features like popup boxes that permit a response from user; functions that allow routine activities to be carried out; loops that allow repetitive operations; break and continue commands that are used to exercise some control loop have been explored.
The detail elements of these broad outlines were also discussed.
Students are now better equipped to develop standard dynamic web pages.

Most of the website that belong to government, parastatals, agencies, corporate organisations and institutions of learning have underline databases to hold their information for dynamic processing.
Various software are available to handle data storage and manipulation for these various bodies.
The software are similar in structures and operations, with slight difference in command names and features.
These variations bring some differences in data handling capabilities and flexibilities of usage.
Some of the commonly use database management software are dBase, Microsoft Access, Visual FoxPro, MySQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle etc.
In this unit, we examined Visual FoxPro no teaching of database management system 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • create and manage databases • create tables for data storage and manage the tables created • create Queries and Reports • design client/server applications 112  MBE 817 MODULE 3 • implement client/server applications.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Database Design A database is a collection of information that is related to a particular subject or purpose, such as tracking store inventory or maintaining a music collection.
A database file can contain one or more tables, views, connections to remote data sources, and stored procedures.
Databases provide the architecture for storing organisational data and have additional benefits as well.
With a database, user can create table-level extensions such as field- and record-level rules, default field values, and triggers.
Also one can create stored procedures and persistent table relationships.
Database can be used to establish connections to remote data sources and to create views of local and remote tables.
When designing a database, first break down the information to keep in the database as separate subjects, and then decide how the subjects are related to each other so that the right information can be brought together when they are needed.
Maintaining information in separate tables makes it easier to organise and maintain the data, as well as to build a high-performance application.
Here are the steps in the database design process Determine the purpose of your database Knowing the purpose will help database designer to decide the facts to store in the database.
Determine the tables After having a clear purpose for the database, divide your information into separate subjects, such as “Employees” or “Orders.” Each subject will be a table in the database.
Determine the fields to be in the table Decide what information to keep in each table.
Each category of information in a table is called a field and is displayed as a column when the table is displayed.
For example, one field in an Employee table could be Surname; another could be Staff No.
113  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Determine the relationships Look at each table and decide how the data in one table is related to the data in other tables.
Add fields to tables or create new tables to clarify the relationships, as necessary.
Refine the design Analyse the design for errors.
Create the tables and add a few records of sample data.
Check, if the tables can give the expected result.
There may be mistake or omission during the initial design.
Think of it as a rough draft that can be refined later.
Experiment with sample data and prototypes of forms and reports.
With the database management software you are using, it’s easy to change the design of your database as you are creating it.
However, it becomes much more difficult to make changes to tables after they are filled with data and are built forms and reports.
For this reason, make sure that you have a solid design before you proceed too far into building your application.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE List and briefly explain the steps in involved in database design process 3.2 Creating a Database When you create a database, you gather tables together into one collection and gain the benefit of data dictionary features.
A data dictionary provides a greater flexibility in designing and modifying the database, without necessarily having to write code to create field-level and row-level validation or to ensure the uniqueness of values within primary key fields.
The Visual FoxPro data dictionary enables user to create or specify: • primary and candidate keys.
• persistent relationships between database tables.
• long names for tables and fields.
• captions on fields that display in Browse windows and Grid columns as headers.
• default values on fields.
• the default control class used in forms.
• input masks and display formats for fields.
• field-level rules and record-level rules.
• triggers.
114  MBE 817 MODULE 3 • stored procedures.
• connections to remote data sources.
• local and remote views.
• comments for each field, table, and database.
Some data dictionary features, such as long field names, primary and candidate keys, default values, field-level and record-level rules, and triggers, are stored in the .dbc file but are created as part of the process of building a table or view.
To create a new database In the Project Manager (fig 13.1a and b) • select the Data tab, • then select Databases from the list • choose New, • the click New Database button on the on the New Database window.
Figure 13.1b: New Database window Fig.
13.1a: Project Manager Window -or- Use the CREATE DATABASE command.
For example, the following code creates and exclusively opens a new database called OpenVersity 115  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT CREATE DATABASE OpenVersity 3.3 Working with Tables Table is a fundamental structure of a relational database management system.
A table stores data in records (rows) and fields (columns).
The data is usually about a particular category of things, such as customers, employees, or stock taking.
Each Visual FoxPro table can be stored in its own file with a .dbf extension or contained in a database.
During database design database, specified the table fields and relationships needed for the application.
As you create those tables, make more detailed choices about the data types, captions, and potential default values for each field, the triggers for each table, as well as the table indexes you build to establish relationships between tables.
A table can be created in a database, or just as a free table not associated with a database.
A table created in a database has the following advantages over a free table: • Long names for the table and for each field in the table.
• Captions and comments for each table field.
• Default values, input masks, and format for table fields.
• Default control class for table fields.
• Field-level and record-level rules.
• Primary key indexes and table relationships to support referential integrity rules.
• One trigger for each INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE event.
3.3.1 Creating a Table To create a new database table In the Menu: • select a database, • then New Tables, and then • click New Table from the New Table window 116  MBE 817 MODULE 3 Fig.
13.2 : New Table Window -or- Use the CREATE TABLE command with a database open.
For example, the following code can be embedded in the a scripting language to create the table Academictbl with one column, called name: OPEN DATABASE StudentRecord CREATE TABLE Academictbl (name c(50)) As <head> <script language = “JavaScript”> { Function Createtbl() { Open database StudentRecord Create Table Academictbl } return() } </Script> </head> <body> ….
</body> The new table is automatically associated with the database that is open at the time you create it.
This association is defined by a backlink stored in the table’s header record.
117  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.3.2 Saving a Table as HTML You can use the Save As HTML option on the File menu when you are browsing a table to save the contents of a table as an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) file.
To save a table as HTML Open the table.
• Browse the table by issuing the BROWSE command in the Command window or by choosing Browse from the View menu.
• Choose Save As HTML on the File menu.
• Enter the name of the HTML file to create and choose Save.
Naming Fields Specify field names as you build a new table.
These field names can be 10 characters long for free tables or 128 characters long for database tables.
If a table is removed from a database, the table’s long field names are truncated to 10 characters.
To name a table field, in the Table Designer, enter a field name in the Name box.
Choosing Data Types As one creates each table field one also chooses a data type for the data the field is to store.
Some of the data type in FoxPro are text, numeric, currency, Character, Memo, and General fields.
Values in the Numeric and Currency fields can be added but General, Text and Memo types cannot be summed.
Currency data type uses 8 bytes of storage.
Memo and General fields can be indexed.
3.4 Designing Client/Server Applications Visual FoxPro provides users with the tools to create powerful client/server applications.
Client/server application combines the power, speed, graphical user interface and sophisticated querying, reporting, and processing with the seamless multi-user access, massive data storage, built-in security, robust transaction processing, logging, and native server syntax of an ODBC data source or server.
The synergy of Visual FoxPro and server strengths provides a powerful client/server solution for your users.
118  MBE 817 MODULE 3 Goals for Client/Server Design The goal of Client/Server Design is to balance several sets of requirements viz: • to build the fastest, most productive application for users.
• to ensure the integrity of application data, • to make the most of existing hardware investments, • to build in scalability for the future, and • to make the development process as streamlined and cost- efficient as possible.
The best way to meet these requirements is to design an application with these goals in mind.
Designing for High Performance The following questions must be asked and answered when designing for high performance: • which tables will be stored on the remote server once the application is implemented?
• which tables would be more efficiently stored as local lookup tables?
• what views will you need to access remote data?
• what business rules are enforced by the server, and how will your application interact with these rules?
3.5 Upsizing Visual FoxPro Databases Upsizing is the method of moving databases, tables, and views from your system to a remote SQL Server or Oracle server.
Before upsizing, have a a database, connect the database to an SQL data source ODBC data source, secure the necessary permissions on the server, estimate the size of your database, and check that the server has sufficient disk space, secure access to a SQL Server through an ODBC data source or named connection, back up your database, and all shared tables should be closed 3.5.1 Using the SQL Server Upsizing Wizard After creating an ODBC data source and complete the necessary preparations on the client and server, you're ready to begin upsizing.
119  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 1.
From the Tools menu, choose Wizards, and then choose Upsizing.
2.
From the Wizard Selection dialogue box, choose SQL Server Upsizing Wizard.
3.
Follow the directions in the wizard screens, as described in the following sections.
You can choose Cancel at any time to exit the wizard; the wizard performs no actions on the server until you choose Finish.
4.
When you're ready to upsize, choose Finish.
After you choose Finish, the SQL Server Upsizing Wizard begins exporting the database to the server.
3.6 Implementing a Client/Server Application When you have upsized a prototype or developed an application against remote data using remote views, you’ve gained access to the large data stores typically available in a server database.
You can also take advantage of the security and transaction processing capabilities of the remote server.
While remote views handle the main data management tasks, you can enhance your application by using SQL pass-through (SPT) technology to create objects on the server, run server stored procedures, and execute commands using native server syntax.
SQL pass-through technology allows SQL statements to be sent directly to a server.
SQL pass-through statements, because they execute on the back-end server, are powerful ways to enhance the performance of your client/server applications.
SQL pass-through technology offers the following: • the use of server-specific functionality, such as stored procedures and server-based intrinsic functions.
• the use of extensions to SQL supported by the server, as well as data-definition, server administration, and security commands.
• control over SQL pass-through Update, Delete, and Insert statements.
• control over remote transactions.
3.7 Using Visual FoxPro SQL pass-through functions To use SQL pass-through to connect to a remote ODBC data source: • Confirm a system’s ability to connect your computer to your data source, using ODBC Test for ODBC.
120  MBE 817 MODULE 3 • Establish a connection to the data source with the SQLCONNECT( ) or the SQLSTRINGCONNECT( ) function.
e.g.
nConnectionHandle = SQLCONNECT('mynotes','ov','web') Syntax SQLCONNECT([DataSourceName, cUserID, cPassword | cConnectionName]) Returns Numeric Arguments DataSourceName Specifies the name of a data source as defined in your Odbc.ini file.
cUserID Specifies a user identifier used to log on to the data source.
cPassword Specifies the password to the data source.
cConnectionName Specifies a named connection created with CREATE CONNECTION.

3.8 Optimising Client/Server Performance After the implementation of a client/server application, one might find areas where he/she may like to improve performance.
This can be achieved on the client, network, and server.
Client/Server performance can be optimised by: • optimising Connection Use • speeding Up Data Retrieval 121  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT • speeding Up Queries and Views • speeding Up Forms • improving Performance on Updates and Deletes Meanwhile, the actual performance depends greatly on your system configuration and application requirements.
4.0 CONCLUSION Database forms the back engine of many personal and corporate web applications.
Proper management of an organisational data determines, to a greater extent, the reliability and dependability of the clients on the activities of the organisation.
FoxPro database management software, with its interoperability capacity with many other standard multinational software, can be used as bedrock for a standard database design.
As mentioned earlier, many more powerful database management software abound, one thing to note is that their operating principles are similar, although the architecture may be different.
Once the principle of database design is mastered, you can blend from one application to another with ease.
5.0 SUMMARY In this chapter, emphasis has been laid on the importance of database to a standard establishment.
As a result, there have been an overview of database as a concept; what to consider when designing a database; how to work with the data containers (tables) in a database; marrying a database with HTML - the language of web design; and database design, implementation and optimisation on a network system.
These key components are very essential in the design of a vibrant web site in this competitive information age.

Dreamweaver is an automatic web authoring tool originally created by Macromedia (now part of Adobe Systems).
Initial versions of the application served as simple WYSIWYG HTML editors but more recent versions have incorporated notable support for many other web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and various server-side scripting frameworks.
The software is available for both the Mac and Windows platforms.
Dreamweaver is currently owned by Adobe Systems, which acquired Macromedia in 2005.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • build web pages • explain the key components of Dreamweaver workspace effectively • build websites • format image objects • set links to web resources • create tables and frames.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Dreamweaver Dreamweaver is software that uses Graphical User Interface to help user create a web page.
It can display documents in three ways viz: Design view, Code view or both.
Dreamweaver offers two separate areas that are very interesting, but which are also very separate.
These are 125  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT document window and site panel.
The site panel stores information about the site.
It also enables individual documents to be opened or created and can open as many documents as possible; the document window allows contents to be added to the pages.
Document window Site Panel 3.1.1 Building the first page Before starting to work with Dreamweaver, there is a need to create a local site.
This site defines the structure of the pages to be creating.
A site is a storage location for all documents and files belonging to a particular website.
A local requires a name and a local root folder which tells the Dreamweaver where to store the site’s entire files.
A remote site contains files on the server that make up a website from the author’s point of view rather than a visitor’s point of view.
A local site holds files on the local disk that correspond to the files in the remote site.
The files are edited on the local disk and then uploaded to the remote site.
3.1.2 Define a local site Dreamweaver site definition sets some characteristics for a local site plus information on how the local site corresponds to a remote site.
126  MBE 817 MODULE 4 To create a local site: 1.
Create a folder in drive C (call Tutorial), then launch Dreamweaver.
2.
Click Site > New Site 3.
If the dialogue box is showing the Advanced tab, click Basic 4.
The first screen of the Site Definition Wizard appears, asking you to enter a name for your site.
In the text box, enter a name to identify the site within Dreamweaver in the Site Name field, type Tutorial.
The site name lets you easily identify and select a site from a list of sites you’ve defined.
5.
Click Next to proceed to the next step.
The next screen of the wizard appears asking if you want to work with a server technology.
6.
Select the No option to indicate that now, this site is a static site, with no dynamic pages 7.
Click Next to proceed to the next step.
The next screen of the wizard appears, asking how you to work with your files 8.
Select the option labelled “Edit local copies on my machine, then upload to server when ready (recommended)” 9.
The text box allows you to specify a folder on your local disk where Dreamweaver should store the local version of the site’s files.
It’s easier to specify an accurate folder name if you browse to the folder rather that typing the path, so click the folder icon nest to the text box.
The Choose Local Root Folder for Site dialogue box appears.
10.
In the Choose Local Root Folder for Site dialogue box, start by navigating to a folder on your local disk where you can store all of your sites 11.
Click Next to proceed to the next step.
12.
The next screen of the wizard appears, asking how you connect to your remote server.
13.
Now, choose None from the pop-up menu.
Click Next to proceed to the next step.
14.
The next screen of the wizard appears showing a summary of your settings.
15. click Done to finish.
Cascading the files in the folder creates a record of existing files so Dreamweaver can quickly updates links when you move, rename, or delete a file.
The site window now displays a list of all list of all the folders and files in the local site tutorial.
The list also acts as a file manager, allowing you to copy, paste, delete move and open files just as you would in the file finder or explorer on your own computer.
127  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.2 The Document Window The document window displays the current document approximately as It will appear in a web browser.
The title bar of the Document window displays the page title and, in parentheses, the file name and an asterisk if the fie contains unsaved changes.
The principle elements of the Document Area include.
Menu: Most functions in Dreamweaver can be accessed through the menus.
Insert Toolbar: Replaces the Object panel and is used to add components to your document.
Toolbar: Offers instant access to common actions as well as to the Code View.
Page title: title that appears when a visitor to the Web page bookmarks your site File name: displays the path and the name of your file.
Window size: offers simulations of your various browser resolutions File size/Download time Launcher bar: One-click access to many panels and functions.
Tag Selector: Lists the appropriate tags for the selected object.
Clicking a tag in the Tag Selector automatically takes you to the location of the tag in the Code View.
3.2.1 Setting the page properties Right click to open the page properties dialogue box.
Type the title to Welcome to my tutorial.
The title appears in the title bar of the Dreamweaver Document window and this is the title that will appear in the browser’s Bookmarks or Favourites list, so it should be descriptive.
Click on the square next to Background Colour.
When the colour palette appears you can select a colour swatch.
If you want to choose a background image, you would use the Browser button next to Background image.
128  MBE 817 MODULE 4 Now select the square of next to Text Colour and choose a dark colour for the text.
Note that you can choose different colours for the Link Colour (text that is linked), Visited Links (previously selected by a viewer) and Active Links (the colour of the link while it is being selected).
Click Ok then save your page as index.html 3.2.2 The Property Inspector Most changes you make to properties are immediately applied in the Document window.
Which properties appear in the Property Inspector depends on the element selected.
The Property inspector initially displays the most commonly used properties.
Click the expander arrow in the lower right corner to of the Property inspector to see more of the element’s properties.
1.
After closing the page properties window, click on the page and type the words “Welcome to”.
The property inspector displays property for whatever object is displayed.
2.

129  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 6.
Place the cursor after headline, hit Enter and then type “Dreawweaver.tutorial.com”.
7.
Highlight the new line and change the font size to 5.
Change the font colour by clicking on the gray box next to the text size window.
The text property inspector makes it very easy to keep track of attributes like format choice fonts and colour.
When you select an element on a pages e.g.
text or image the property inspector displays only the attribute options available for the element.
You can access more advanced features by clicking on the small arrow in the bottom right corner of the property inspector.
3.2.3 The Insert Toolbar The Insert Toolbar replaces the Object panels and is used to add components to your document.
The Insert toolbar contains twelve objects but the commonly used are: Common, Text, Table, Forms, Frames and Character.
• The Common object contains the most commonly used objects, such as Image, Table, and Layer.
• The Text object allows you to insert text- and paragraph- formatting tags.
• The Table object places a table at the insertion point.
• The Forms object contains buttons for creating forms and form elements.
• The Frame object contains common frameset structures.
• The Characters panel contains special characters such as the copyright symbol, curved quotation marks, and trademark symbols.
• To insert a picture between your headline and address: 1.
Place your cursor just after the second line and hit Enter to open up a space.
2.
Click on the top button Object palette to choose an image, and browser.
Click on the file called welcome.jpg and click select then click Ok. 3.
Place your cursor next to the image without selecting it, and then click on the Align Right icon in the Property 130  MBE 817 MODULE 4 inspector and it will move to the right side of the page.
Try Align Left and Align Centre.
4.
Click on the picture and note that the property inspector automatically changes to show you the image properties its dimensions and location.
3.2.4 Previewing your work in a web browser • Dreamweaver makes it easy for you to set up preview links to different browsers.

This opens up a new page in a window, so you can have both pages open at the same time.
2.
Repeat the procedures for setting page properties that you learned.
Use “background.jpg” as the background.
3.
Give it the title “Tutorial 1”, and save as tutorial1.html.
4.
Click on the top button on the Object palatte to choose an image.
Browse to find an image and double click to select in then click OK. 3.3.1 Formatting the new text 1.

3.3.2 Line and paragraph breaks • When you want a single line break use a line break instead of a paragraph break.
• Place your cursor to the left of the text and press Shift-Enter to insert a line break.
• You can also insert a break tag by choosing Insert>Special Character>Line Break.
3.3.3 Adding a horizontal rule • The horizontal rule tag creates a line that spans the Width of the Web Page.
• By changing the tag’s attributes, you can alter the thickness of the rule and limit its span to only a portion of the page.
• To add the space just after the “Tutorial 4”, then click on the HR buttons on the Common object.
3.3.4 Creating lists Dreamweaver makes it easy to create ordered lists (set by numbers or letters), unordered lists (preceded by bullets) and definition lists (indented but not preceded by numbers or bullets).
You can create lists as you type test into document, or you can highlight existing text and apply the list format.
Lists can also be nested to create outline.
1.
Position the cursor after “Tutorial 4” , and add paragraph break.
2.
Click the numbered or bullet list button in the property inspector.

3.5 Setting Hyperlinks To set the hyperlinks: 1.
Type “HOME” below the last horizontal line and highlight it.
Click the white box next to the word link in the Property Inspector and type index.html in the Property Inspector.
Save the file, preview in your browser.
2. to set the image as hyperlinks, click the image and repeat the instruction above to create a link 3. instead of typing, click the folder icon search for the file you want to link to.
4. specify a web address as a link but you must type http:// before you type the address.
3.5.1 Setting internal links For a long document, create a link at a specific location in the web page to immediately go to the top of the page.
1.
Click anywhere at the beginning o f the page.
Click Insert> Name Anchor.
When prompted for Anchor Name, just type “top” 2.
Just after “Tutorial 5” press ENTER 15 times and then type “TOP”.

Save and preview in the browser.
133  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.5.2 Creating image map An image map is a single image where hyperlinks are assigned to different areas or “hotpots” of the image.
The difference between a hyperlink image and image map I s for hyperlink image, the whole image is hyperlinked to one document only whereas the image map is a multi-hyperlinked image.
To create an image map: 1.
Insert an image and select the image 2.
Click the expander arrow in the lower right corner of the Property Inspector to see all properties 3.
Type the name for the map in the Map Name field 4.
Do one of the following to define the image map area: • select the circle tool and drag the pointer over the image to create a circular hotspot • select the rectangular tool and drag the pointer over the image to create a circular hotspot • select the polygon tool and define an irregularly shaped hotspot by clicking once for each corner point 5.
Click on the arrow tool to close the shape.
Arrow tool also enables one to select, relocate the hotspots and resize them by dragging the small blue boxes at the edge of each shape.
6.
In the Hotspot Inspector, click the folder icon to browse and open a file when the hotspot is clicked, or type the file name in the Link field.
7.
To make the linked document appear somewhere other than the current window or frame, enter a window name in the Target box or choose a frame name from the pop-up menu 8.
In the Alt box, type alternative test that is displayed for the hotspot in a text only browsers.
9.
Some browsers display this text as a tool tip when then user pauses the mouse pointer over the hotspot.
10. repeat steps 4 through 6 to define additional hotspots in the image map Polygon tool Arrow tool Circle tool Square tool 134  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.5.3 Setting hotspot properties The properties listed below appear in the Property Inspector when hotspot is selected • Map specifies the image map’s name.
creates a unique name for each image map within a document • Link specifies the file or URL to be displayed when the user clicks the hotspot.
If you use a file, enter a path that is relative to your document (file names the begin with file:// are not relative) • Target specifies frame or window in which the linked page should load.
The target option is not available until the selected hotspot contains a link.
• The names all the frames in the current document appear on the list.
If the specify frame does not exist when the current document is open in the a browser, the linked page loads into a new window that has the name you specified.
The following reserved target names can also be chosen: _blank loads the inked file into a new, unnamed browser o window.
_parent loads the linked file into the parent frameset or o window of the frame that contains the link.
If the frame containing the link is not nested, the linked file loads into the full browser window _self loads the link file into the same frame or window as o the link.
This target is implied, so you generally don’t need to specify it.
_top loads the linked file into the full browser window, o thereby removing all frames.
• Alt: specifies alternative text that appears in place o the image for text-only browsers or for browsers that have been to download images manually.
3.6 Creating Tables Tables are useful for laying out data.
They can also be used to control where test and graphics appear in a page.
User can add content, modify cell and row properties and copy and paste multiple cells.
Tables consist of three basic components – rows (horizontal spacing), columns (vertical spacing) and cells (intersection of a row and a column) 135  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.6.1 Inserting a table • Place the cursor where want the table to appear on the page and click the Table button on the common panel o the Object palette or choose Insert> Table.
• In the dialogue box that appears, enter the following information: 6 rows and 3 columns.
• Insert the background image and change the colour approximately.
The width is 75%.
• Save the page as table.html.
• Type the following text in cells.
S/N MAT_NO NAMES 1 06/48226 Ifeanyichi Mary-Ann Ngozi 2 06/48235 Lamidi Yemisi 3 06/48238 Michael Victoria O.
4 06/48241 Muraina Latifat 5 06/48247 Ojo Toyin Eunice • To name the table, in the Table Name field, type a name event schedule for the table.
• To select the table layout options: Rows an Cols – set the number of rows and columns in a o table.
W and H fields – set the width and height of the table and o a number of pixels or as percentage of the browser’s window.
Align – align the table to the browser’s left, right or centre.
o V Space and H Space – specify the amount of space (in o pixel) to leave above, below, and on both sides of the table.
Clear Row Height and Clear Column Width – delete all o table row height an column width values from the table Convert Table Widths to Pixels – convert the table width o from a percentage of a browser window to its current width in pixels 136  MBE 817 MODULE 4 Convert Table Widths to Percent – convert the current o table width from pixels to a percentage of the browser’s window.
• To set cell layout options: CellPad – sets the amount of space between the cell content o and the cell boundary.
By default, cell padding is set to 1 CellSpace – sets the amount of space between a table and o cells.
By default, cell spacing is set to 2 • To set table borders options: Border – sets the width of the table border in pixels.
Set it o to 2 Light Brdr and Dark Brdr – set border colours that have a o highlight and shadow effect respectively, giving the border a three-dimensional appearance to a border.
Set pink colour to light border and set pink colour to dark brdr.
Brdr – sets a border colour for the entire table.
o Bg – set options to select the background image or o background colour or the table.
3.6.2 Resizing Tables and Cells To resize a table: • Select the table • Drag the selection handles to resize the table along that dimension.
Dragging the corner handles resizes both dimensions.
To change the size of a row or a column • Change the row height by dragging the bottom row border • Change the column by dragging the right column border 3.6.3 Adding and Removing Rows and Columns • To add a row – Modify>Table>Insert Row • To add a column – Modify>Table>Insert Column • To delete a row – Modify>Table>Delete Row • To delete a column – Modify>Table>Delete Row.
137  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.6.4 Splitting and Merging Cells • With the cursor in one of the cells, select two or more cells by dragging the mouse over the those cells • To merge the two or more cells in the table, click merge cells in the Property Inspector.
• To split a merged cell, click the split cell button in the Property Inspector.
In the Split Cell dialogue box, choose whether to split the cell into rows or columns and then enter the number of rows or columns.
3.6.5 Sorting Table Table can be sorted based on the content of a single column.
Sorting can equally be based on the contents of two or more columns; however tables that contain COLSPAN or ROWSPAN (tables that contain merged cells) attribute cannot be sorted.
• Put the cursor anywhere in the table: • Choose Command>Sort Table from menu bar.
To sort the Names alphabetically –in sort by choose o column 3; for order change to alphabetically and select descending S/N MAT_NO NAMES 5 06/48247 Ojo Toyin Eunice 4 06/48241 Muraina Latifat 3 06/48238 Michael Victoria O.
2 06/48235 Lamidi Yemisi 1 06/48226 Ifeanyichi Mary-Ann Ngozi 3.7 Creating Frames Frames divide a web page so that different files can be loaded into defined areas on the same page.
Frames commonly define a navigation area and a content area for a page.
When a Dreamweaver document is split into frames, it creates an untitled frameset file an untitled document in each of the new frames.
What a user sees as a single Web page with two frames is actually three separate files: the frameset file and two files containing the content that appears inside the frames.
138  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.7.1 Creating a Frameset • Choose Modify>Frameset>Split Frame Up • In the frame on the button, choose Modify>Frameset>Split Frame Left to create two columns • To name the frame, type a name in the Frame Name field.
Name the top frame as top, left and bottom frame main.
3.7.2 Using a Predefined Frameset Predefined framesets make it easy for one to select the type of frame s/he wants to create.
The predefined frameset icons in the Frames panel of the Objects palette provide a visual representation of each frameset as applied to a selected document.
3.7.3 Deleting a frame • Drag the frame borders all of the way off the page.
• Press Delete.
3.7.4 Selecting frame • Press Alt+Click on the frame you want.
Or click Window>Frames and choose the frame you want in the Frame Inspector.
• Click a frame border in the Document Window to select a frameset.
3.7.5 Inserting files into frames • Press Alt+Click on the left frame, the frame property inspector changes.
Choose frame_left.html as the SCR source file 139  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT • Press Alt+Click on the top frame, Frame_top.html as the SCR source file • Press Alt+Click on the bottom frame, Choose main.html as the SCR source file • Place your cursor on the border of the two columns and drag to resize the border so that all files can be seen clearly on the screen.
• Choose File>Save Frameset to save the frameset.
Give a suitable name.
• Choose File>Save all so that Dreamweaver can save all opened files at a time 3.7.6 Setting frame properties To see all the following frame properties, click the expander arrow in the lower right corner of the Property Inspector.
Indicate for each of the frame whether you want to scroll, allow resizing, want the border to be seen, determine the colour of the border and the margin width and height (the space between the border and the content).
3.7.7 Linking files between frames To link files • Insert hyperlink to map image “what’s new” to new.html.
Choose target frame name as main.
• Insert hyperlink to map image “the shop” to main.html.
Choose target frame name as main.
• Insert hyperlink to map image “link” “index.html”.
Choose target frame name as _blank (it will load the file “index.html” into a new browser window.
3.7.8 Creating non frame content Dream weaver allows users to specify content to display in older and test-based browsers that do not support frames.
When a browser that does not support frames loads a frameset file, the browser displays only the NOFRAMES content.
To create a NOFRAME content: • Chose Modify>Frameset>edit NoFrames Contents.
Dream weaver clears the Document window and the words “Noframes Content” appear at the top of the body area.
• Create the NoFrames Content in the Document window 140  MBE 817 MODULE 4 • Choose Modify>Frameset > Edit NoFrames Content again to return to the normal view for the frameset document.
SELF- ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Why would you prefer the use of Dream weaver in web design than writing HTML code using a text editor?
Why?
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit has elucidated the use of Dream weaver, an interactive web design application, to automatically author HTML code while designing a web page.
The task of writing complex HTML code has been alleviated by this powerful software.
Web designer need not be a programmer or a computer professional to design a good website.
Dreamweaver has all it takes to write text, input graphics and maintain proper links to files, objects or other sites.
The codes are automatically generated by this application.
It is clear that with the use of this application, a little knowledge of HTML coding and the understanding of the flow of program execution, web designer can have better control on their design and complete a site design within a small time frame.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has provided a step-by-step practical approach to the use of Dreamweaver to design a website and upload the site for global use.
The basic knowledge on the use of the application is explained in detail.
The task of building the site, creating tables, frames, images, map, pictures, lines, links and non-frame contents were properly explain the order in this unit.
By now students would have developed a better interest on web design as the issue of self coding has become highly reduces and even becoming extinct.
A simple knowledge of the Dreamweaver application software eases the task of web design.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT i.

User can edit photos; create graphics, draw, and paint, all within a highly customisable workspace.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • identify different parts of Corel Photo Shop user interface • manipulate images using Photo Shop application • describe colours and materials in the application • paint objects using raster painting • explain different layers • explain text • identify and explain photographs.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Corel Paint Shop Corel Paint Shot is graphic application software that blends images in various ways: it can import images from a digital camera, card reader, or scanner; it can capture images from the computer screen; it can duplicate an existing image or layer; or create an image.
144  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.2 Paint Shop User Interface Tool Options Standard Tool bar Menu bar Image window Palettes Tool Option Palette Layer Palette Browser palette Status bar The Corel Paint Shop Pro workspace includes the following components • Menu bar — displays commands for performing tasks.
For example, the Effects menu contains commands for applying effects to images.
• Toolbars — display buttons for common commands.
• Palettes — display image information and help you select tools, modify options, browse through images, manage layers, select colours, and perform other editing tasks.
• Status bar — displays information about the selected tool or menu command, as well as information about image dimensions, colour depth, and pointer position.
The status bar appears at the bottom of the main program window, and unlike other toolbars, it cannot be customised or moved.
• Browser: is used to browse files, folders and visually search for a particular image file.
• Tool Options: is visible when one of Tools is selected.
The Tool Options palette contains settings and control for the active tool and is positioned, by default, just above the image area in your workspace.

3.3 Paint Shop Images 3.3.1 Getting Images into Paint Shop Importing images from digital Cameras and Scanners Before you can view and download image from a digital camera, card reader, or scanner you most install the special software (called drives) that enables your computer to connect to the camera, card reader, or scanner.
Determine which type of connection your camera, card reader, or scanner uses: WIA: The default for non-WIA compatible computer running the windows XP and ME operating systems.
Your camera, card reader, or scanner must support WIA.
Mounted Drive: The default for non-WIA computers, and the most common type of connection.
Some camera and scanners, and must of card reader are viewed as an additional disk drive when they are connected to the USB port of your computer.
TWAIN: Most cameras and scanners are TWAIN-compliant.
Use this setting if your camera, scanner, or card reader is TWAIN compliant.
147  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT To download from a WIA camera and scanner with windows XP or ME 1.
Connect the camera, card reader, or scanner to the computer using the USB cable 2.
Choose file>import>from scanner or camera to download the images to your computer.
To down load from a camera, card reader, or scanner that appears as a mounted drive 1.
Choose File>Open to open the open dialogue.
or choose File>Browse and use the browser to locate the images on the mounted drives 2.
Navigate to the drive for your camera, card reader, or scanner.
3.
Locate the image that you want to download in a folder or subfolder of that drive.
4.
Select the images that you want to download and click Open to open the images in paint shop.
3.3.2 Opening Existing Images To open an image file using the Open dialogue box 1.
Do one of the following: • Choose File>Open.
• Click the Open button.
2.
In the look in drop-down list, select the folder where the file is stored.
3.
Click the name of the file you want open.
To select multiple files, press ctrl and click each name.
4.
To view information or a preview of the image, choose an option Details.
Show preview Mark this check box to display the selected image in the preview area.
If you have selected multiple files, no preview is display, use the Browse windows instead.
5.
Click Open.
Computer graphics area of two type: raster(also called bitmap) or vector.
With paint shop, one create both raster and vector images.
Raster Images are composed of individual elements, called pixels, arrange in a grid.
Each pixel has a specific location and colours.
If you magnify raster data, you can see the individual pixels as squares of colons.
An object in a raster image is defined by its pixels.
Raster images can display subtle changes in tones and colours, so they are most often used for images like photographs and digital artwork.
148  MBE 817 MODULE 4 Raster images contain a fixed number of pixels, so when you magnify the image, you are magnifying the display size of the pixels.
As a result, raster images can display jagged rather than smooth edges if magnified on screen or printed at a large magnification.
Vector graphics or images use geometric characteristics – lines, curves, and their locations – to define objects.
In vector imagers you edit objects or shapes rather than pixels.
Vector graphics do not lose clarity or detail when scaled to any size or printed at any resolution.
They work well for technical illustrations or corporate logos.
In paint shop pro, you create and edit raster and vector data on separate layers.
With some tools you created raster data (like brush stocks with the paint tool) and with other tools (like the Text and Preset Shapes tools) you can choose whether you want to create raster or vector data.
In general, use vector objects if you will need to edit the object as an element separate from other parts of the image.
For example, if you add a star to an image, you may want to change its size, colour or location.
This is easier if the star is a vector object.
You can create raster data on separation layers so you can easily edit or move them.
Three elements that contribute to the file size of the image • Image Size: the physical dimensions of the image.
In paints Shop, you define image height and width in pixels per inches, centimetres, or millimetres.
• Image Resolution: the number of pixels per inch (ppi) or pixels per centimetre in images.
It is important to select an appropriate resolution.
Too low a resolution causes pixilation, and large pixels produce coarse output.
Too high a resolution adds to an image’s memory requirements without producing a proportional increase in its quality.
• Colour Depth: the number of colours that a pixel can display.
Each pixel’s colour information is stored in a certain number of computer bits – from 1 bit to 24 bits.
In a 1-bit image, each pixel can display only one of two colours (black or white).
In a 24-bit image, each pixel can display one of 16 million colours.
Images with a colour depth of 16 million colours look best because they contain the most colours, but they also require the most memory to store and edit.
Many of paint shop effect and correction commands work on 16 million colour images only.
Therefore, it is best to create most images using 16 million colours.
When you have finished working on the image, you can decrease its colour depth and save it in another format.
149  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.3.3 To create a new image 1.
Do one of the following to open the New image dialogue: • Choose File>New; or • Click the New Image button on the toolbar 2.

• To create an image using specific dimensions, in the Image Dimensions group box, set the following option: Units The units dimensions (pixels, inches, centimetre, or millimetres).
Width The width of the new image.
Height The height of the new image.
Resolution The resolution of the new image.
Specify the resolution units (pixels/inch or pixels/cm) in the drop-down list.
3.
In the Image Characteristics group box, select from this options Raster Background, Vector Background, or Art Media Background: The type of bottommost layer.

3.4 Working with Colours and Materials 3.4.1 Basics of using the Materials Palette The Materials palette offers a variety of ways to choose colons, styles, and materials for the raster and vector tools.
With paint Shop you can paint, draw, and fill with a variety of colours, styles, and materials.
A style is the colour, gradient, or pattern.
A material is the styles plus the optional texture.
Select materials on the 151  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT palette.
In general you use foreground materials for brush strokes and background materials for fills.
When you paint with a raster brush, right- clicking the brush paints with the background materials and for fill tools, left-clicking fills with the foreground material.
For text and vector shapes, the foreground colour is the stroke (or outline) of the text of shape and the background colour is the fill of the text or shape.
In general, it is best to select the tool you want to use, select the colour/material on the materials palette, set the other options, and then use the tool.

6. click OK. 157  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.5.4 Understanding Colour Depth Colour depth, as earlier defined, is also called bit depth.
It refers to the number of colours each pixel can display.
As the colour depth increases, the number of colours an image can display increases.
To increase the colour depth of an image Choose Image>Increase Colour Depth and choose the desired colour depth – 16 Colours (4-Bit), 256 Colours (8-Bit), or 16 Million Colours (24-Bit).
Colour depths that are not available for the active image are grayed colour out.
3.6 Making a Palette Colour Transparent Palette images with fewer colours such as GIF and PNG file do not support transparent backgrounds, but is needed in a way to make part of an image transparent when displays on a Web page.
Paint Shop has two ways to make a colour transparent: • use the Set Palette Transparency command.
To set transparent colour, the image must have one layer only an must use an image palette (colour depth must be less than (24-bits) • edit the image in 24-bit colour, then use the GIF or PNG optimisers to export a copy of the image.
This does not change the colour depth or pattern layer of the original image file and keeps all Paint Shop effect and commands available.
To make one image colour transparent: 1. choose Image>Palette>Set Palette Transparency 2. if you are prompted to reduce the colour depth and number of layers, click Yes to continue and then choose the options for decreasing the colour depth 3. on the Set Palette Transparency dialogue, select an option: • to undo transparency of a colour, select No Transparency • to make the background colour transparent, select Set the transparency value to the current background colour • to assign a specific colour to be transparent, click the colour on the image itself, enter a value in the edit box of the Set Transparency value to a palette entry option, or click the colour to select from the current colour picker 4. to view the transparency on the image, click the Proof button 5. click OK.
The colour is now transparent; however, it may still be displayed until you hide it.
158  MBE 817 MODULE 4 To view or hide the transparency of a colour Choose Image>Palette>View Palette Transparency.
3.6.1 Brush and Paint Options The brush and pain options help to create hundreds of different brush strokes when using the raster painting tools.
The following options are available on the Tool Options palette for painting.
Shape — specifies the shape of the brush tip.
You can create rectangular, elliptical, or angled brush tips by starting with the round or square shape and modifying it with the Thickness and Rotation options.
Size — determines the pixel size of the brush.
You can adjust the Size value using the keyboard as well as through the Tool Options palette.
Hardness — determines how sharp the edges of the brush are.
A setting of 100 gives you the sharpest, hardest edge; lower values produce an increasingly softer, fading edge.
Step — determines the distance between applications of paint during a single, continuous paint stroke.
Lower values produce a smoother, more continuous appearance; higher values create a choppier appearance.
Density — determines the coverage of the brush stroke.
(For the Eraser tool, this setting determines the level of erasing.)
Higher values result in complete coverage; lower values produce spottier coverage, as though you’re spraying the paint.
When using the Airbrush tool, you should set Density to values lower than 100.
Thickness — determines the width of the brush stroke.
A setting of 100 gives you a completely round or completely square brush (depending on the Shape setting).
As the Thickness setting decreases, the brush becomes increasingly narrow.
Rotation — applies rotation to the brush tip.
(Rotation is not visible on a circular tip.)
Opacity — determines how well the paint covers the image surface.
At 100% opacity, the paint covers everything.
At 1% opacity, the paint is almost completely transparent.
For the Eraser tool, this setting determines the level of erasing.
Blend mode — determines how painted pixels are blended with pixels on underlying layers.
The blend modes are the same as layer blend 159  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT modes.
The Paint Behind blend mode, for example, paints behind the image on the active layer.
No paint is visible when the topmost layer and the active layer are both fully opaque.
Rate — determines the rate at which the Air Brush tool applies paint (from 0 to 50).
A value of 0 applies a consistent amount of paint even when the speed of the brush stroke varies.
Higher values apply more paint when the brush slows down or pauses.
Continuous — specifies whether paint builds up as you apply multiple strokes of less than 100% opacity over the same area.
If this check box is marked, paint maintains a continuous colour and repainting an area has no effect.
If this check box is unmarked (the default), each brush stroke over the same area applies more paint; the colour darkens until it reaches 100% opacity.
Wet Look Paint — mimics wet paint, with soft colour inside and a darker ring near the edge.
The effect is more visible with lower values for the Hardness setting 3.6.2 To use the Flood Fill tool 1.
On the Tools toolbar, choose the Flood Fill tool 2.
Choose the foreground or background colour and material o fill the area with.
3.
On the Tool Options palette, specify the Match Mode option 4.
Select the Blend Mode options: • Bled Mode: How filled pixels are blended with pixels of underlying layers.
• Opacity: The opacity for the fill.
At 100% opacity, the paint covers everything; at 1% opacity, the paint is almost transparent 5.
Position the cursor over the area of the selection or image that you want to fill, and then do one of the following: • Click the left mouse button to fill with the foreground material • Click the right mouse button to fill with the background material 160  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.6.3 Cloning Parts of Images This is a powerful way to edit images by using the parts of an image as a paint source.
The paint source can be part of the same layer, another layer in the image, a merged image or a layer from another image.
3.6.4 To use the Colour Brush 1.
On the Tools toolbar, choose the Clone Brush tool 2.
On the Tool Option palette, choose the brush tip, size, opacity, and other options 3.
Mark the Align node check box to have Clone Brush tool paint from the point of the source area relative to the first point you click on the target area each time you stop and start painting.
You can click and drag over the target area to fill the source image.
Clear the check box to have every stroke copy the same data 4.
Mark the Sample merged check box to clone data from al layers merged together.
Clear the check box to clone data from the current layer only.
5.
On the source image, right-click or press Shift and click the centre point of the source area.
6.
Click and drag on the image you want to change to paint the cloned area.
3.7 Working with Layers Layers are like separate sheets that you combine to create a final composition.
Each layer you add begins as a transparent sheet over the background.
As you add brush strokes, vector objects, or text, you cover up parts of the Background layer.
Transparent areas allow you to see the underlying layers.
You can stack multiple layers to create artistic compositions, photo collages, or complex illustrations.
There are nine types of layers: Background, Raster, Vector, Art Media, Mask, Adjustment, Group, Selection, and Floating Selection.
Corel Paint Shop Pro supports up to 500 layers.
The actual number of layers allowed in an image may be limited by the amount of memory in your computer.
3.7.1 Using the Layer palette To display of hide the Layer palette: Choose View>Layers palette or press F8 161  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.7.2 Create New Layers Create new layers to use for placing new elements in your images.
To create a new layer 1. one of the following: • to create a new raster layer click the New Raster Layer button or choose Layers>New Raster Layer • to create a new vector layer, click the New Vector Layer button or choose Layers>New Vector Layer 2.
Edit the layer properties as desired and click OK Duplicating Layers To duplicate a layer within the same image: Do one of the following; • Click its name on the Layer palette, then choose Layers>Duplicate • Right-click its name on the Layer palette, then choose Duplicate from the context menu.
• Click its name on the Layers palette, choose Edit>Copy to copy the layer, and then choose Edit>Paste>As New Layer The duplicate layer is added just above the current layer.
3.7.3 To rename a layer 1.
On the Layers palette, right-click the name of the layer and choose Rename form the context menu 2.
Type the name and press Enter 3.7.4 Shown and Hiding of Layers, Groups and Vector Objects Use the Visibility toggles the Layers palette to make layer, layer groups, or vector objects visible of invisible in the image.
These items remain in the image but are hidden.
When a layer is visible, the Visibility toggle displays.
When a layer is hidden, the Visibility toggle is crossed.
3.7.5 Changing the Opacity Layers The opacity of a layer can be varied from 100% (full opacity) own to 0% (transparent).
When a layer is partially transparent, layers below it 162  MBE 817 MODULE 4 show through.
The overall opacity of a layer and the opacity of individual layer pixels are independent of each other.
3.7.6 To Set the Opacity of a layer or layer group On the layer palette, click the name of the layer 1.

Since the objective of this course is to prepare candidates for Web design, there is need to advance the unit to handle Web requirement of images.
This is the main focus of this unit 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • create images for the Web • save images for the Web • work with different image files GIF, JEPG, and PNG • preview images in Web browsers.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Creating images for the Web You can save and optimise images for the Web to reduce the image file size and make images load more quickly.
Using the Web tools, you can create backgrounds for your Web pages, map and slice images to create hotspots or rollovers.
You can also protect your images by adding watermarks with creator and copyright information 169  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.2 Saving images for the Web Majority of Web browsers recognise GIF and JPEG images, these two formats are used most often for saving Web images.
Newer versions of the Web browsers can also recognise the more recent PNG format, and many Web browsers also support Windows Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) and iMode formats, which are popular formats for wireless devices.
When images are saved for the Web, there are three major considerations: layers, colour depth, and file size.
Layers Because none of the current Web browsers can display layered images, you need to flatten an image before saving it for the Web.
Colour depth Some computers are only capable of displaying up to 256 colours.
If an image on a Web page contains more colours, the Web browser uses its own dithering method to display the image.
This can produce colour distortion.
If you reduce the colour depth of the image to 8 bits (256 colours) before placing it on your Web page, its appearance will be more consistent.
Web file formats and file sizes File size affects the majority of users accessing a Web page.
As the size of an image file increases, it takes more time to download, so viewers have a longer time to wait.
You should use a file format that reduces the image size while keeping the quality as high as possible.
Choose from the following file formats when saving image for use on the Web • GIF — compresses line art and images with areas of similar colours.
It supports 8-bit (256) colour.
There are two versions of GIF: 89a, which can save transparency and information, and 87a, which cannot.
Both are recognised by most browsers and use lossless compression.
• JPEG — compresses photographic images efficiently.
It supports 24-bit (16.7 million) colour, uses lossy compression, and is recognised by most browsers.
• PNG — compresses images more efficiently.
It supports up to 24- bit (16.7 million) colour and uses lossless compression.
It is not as 170  MBE 817 MODULE 4 widely used as JPEG, so some features of this format are not available for older browsers.
• Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) — this format is used with many wireless devices.
The images are black and white and have lossless compression.
3.3 To flatten an image • Choose Layers Merge Merge All (Flatten).
3.4 Working with GIF Files Corel Paint Shop lets you optimise GIF files to maximize quality while minimizing file size.
You can save images with or without transparency, depending on how you want to display them on your Web pages.
Paletted images (those with 256 or fewer colours, such as GIF or PNG files) do not support transparent backgrounds, but you often need to make part of your image transparent for a Web page.
For example, you may have a round logo and want the background of the Web page to display around the logo.
In this case, you can choose not to display one colour.
Most Web browsers can choose not to display one colour, effectively making that colour transparent.
The GIF Optimiser dialogue box contains four tabs where you configure the transparency, colour, and format options of the file.
The fifth tab displays estimated download times of the image at various modem speeds.
GIF Optimiser Transparency tab You can choose to base transparency on existing image or layer transparency, or you can sample a colour in the image that you want to make transparent.
If you have a selection in your image, you can base the transparency on the selection.
GIF Optimiser Partial Transparency tab A GIF file cannot contain partially transparent pixels.
All pixels must be either transparent or opaque (visible).
Original images may contain partially transparent pixels if the image does not have a background layer, and you have reduced the opacity of a layer, added a mask, feathered a selection, or used a brush at a reduced opacity setting.
You can determine whether the partially transparent pixels become 171  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT transparent or opaque, and whether they are blended with another colour.
If you mark the None option in the Transparency tab, the options in this tab are unavailable.
GIF Optimiser Colours tab GIF images have an 8-bit colour depth, which means they can display up to 256 colours.
Because these colours are stored in a palette, an image containing 256 or fewer colours is called a paletted image.
To reduce file size, you can have fewer than 256 colours.
You can use the options in this tab to select the number of colours and the type of palette used.
GIF Optimiser Format tab GIF images can be interlaced or non-interlaced, which affects how the image is displayed on a computer with a slow Internet connection.
You can also save the image to an older version of the GIF format to enhance compatibility with older applications.
GIF Optimiser Download Times tab This tab displays the size of the compressed file and estimated download times for four different Internet speeds.
If the file size is too large, you can decrease it by clicking reducing the number of colours.
Using the Transparent GIF Wizard You can open the Transparent GIF Wizard from the GIF Optimiser dialogue box.
This wizard guides you through the steps of optimising a GIF file.
To optimise and save a GIF file 1.
Choose File>Export >GIF Optimiser.
The GIF Optimiser dialogue box appears, and the preview windows show the current image on the left and the resulting GIF file on the right.
2.
Click the Transparency tab, and choose one of the following options: • None — produces a GIF file that does not use a transparency setting • Existing image or layer transparency — uses the current transparency information from the image 172  MBE 817 MODULE 4 • Inside the current selection — for images with a selection, makes everything within the selection transparent • Outside the current selection — for images with a selection, makes everything outside the selection transparent • Areas that match this colour — bases the transparency on a colour you select.
Click the colour box to select a colour or choose a colour from the image by moving the cursor over the image, and clicking a colour.
Then set or type a tolerance factor in the Tolerance control to determine how closely colours must match the selected colour before they become transparent.
3.
Click the Partial Transparency tab and choose one of the following options • Use full transparency for pixels below x% opacity — determines the opacity value at which pixels become transparent.
Pixels below the opacity value you set become transparent.
Pixels above the opacity value become opaque.
As you lower the value, you reduce the number of transparent pixels.
• Use a 50% dither pattern — makes partially transparent pixels opaque using either the colour chosen for blending or the image colour (depending on the blending option), then applies a 50% dither pattern to make colours look more natural • Use error diffusion dither — makes partially transparent pixels opaque using either the colour chosen for blending or the image colour (depending on the blending option), then applies an error diffusion dither to make colours look more natural 4.
Choose one of the following options to determine how partially transparent pixels are blended • Yes — blends the partially transparent pixels with the colour in the Blend colour box.
To choose a new colour, click the colour box, and choose a colour from the Colour dialogue box.
Partially transparent pixels below the value you set above are blended with this colour.
• No — uses the existing image colour at 100% opacity 5.
Click the Colours tab, and type or set a value in the How many colours do you want?
control to determine the number of colours you want in the image.
As you remove colours, the size of the file decreases, but so does the quality of the image.
Use the preview windows to help you determine the best balance between file size and image quality.
6.
Type or set a value in the How much dithering do you want?
control.
173  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT The range is 16 to 256 colours.
This determines the way Corel Paint Shop Pro arranges pixels in an image to compensate for missing colours in the adjacent pixels.
7.
Choose one of the following options to determine the image palette • Existing Palette — lets you use an existing image palette • Standard/Web-safe — lets you use the Web-safe palette for images that you want to use on the Web • Optimised Median Cut — lets you reduce the image to only a few colours.
If you choose this option, you can mark the Boost selected colours check box to give the colours more weight by a factor of the value you set.
The selected colours stand out from the rest of the image.
To boost colours, make a selection of an area that contains these colours and then mark this check box.
• Optimised Octree — lets you optimise an image that contains only a few colours Depending on your needs, you may want to try both the Optimised Median Cut and the Optimised Octree options and choose the one that gives you the best results.
8.
In the Options group box, mark the Include Windows colours check box to include the 16 standard Windows colours in the palette.
If the image will be used on the Web, mark the check box.
9.
Click the Format tab, and choose one of the following options • Non-interlaced — produces an image that downloads one line at a time, starting from the top • Interlaced — produces an image that is displayed incrementally in several passes, and detail is added each time Choose the Interlaced option with larger images so that the viewer can get an idea of how the image looks while waiting for it to download.
10.
Choose one of the following options: • Version 89a — lets you save transparency information.
It is selected automatically if the image contains transparent pixels.
• Version 87a — lets you save an image that does not contain a transparency setting 11.
Click OK to open the Save As dialogue box, and navigate to the folder in which you want to save the new image and type a name for the file.
12.
Click Save.
174  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.3.2 Using the Transparent GIF Wizard 1.
Choose File > Export > GIF Optimiser.
The GIF Optimiser dialogue box appears.
2.
Click Use Wizard, and follow the instructions.
3.
Click Finish to close the wizard and open the Save As dialogue box, where you type a name and select a location for saving the GIF file.
3.5 Working with JPEG Files Corel Paint Shop lets you optimise JPEG files to maximize image quality and minimize file size.
Don’t lose more data — each time you open and save a JPEG, image data is discarded.
It is a good idea to keep a copy of the original image.
JPEG Optimiser Quality tab You can use compression to reduce the size of the JPEG file.
When you compress a JPEG image, you delete image information.
As you increase the compression, you lower the quality of the image.
You can use the image preview window to help you find the best balance between file size and image quality.
You can also reduce the file size with chroma sub-sampling, which averages the colour information for every 2 × 2 square of pixels.
You can change this setting to have a larger area of colour information averaged.
JPEG Optimiser Background Colour tab You can determine transparent pixels are blended in your image.
JPEG Optimiser Format tab You can determine how an image appears as it is being loaded.
You can optimise the JPEG so that the image downloads one line at a time, starting from the top.
If you have a large image, you can choose to have the image display incrementally in several passes; detail is added with each pass.
This allows the viewer to see the image as it is being downloaded.
175  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT JPEG Optimiser Download Times tab You can view the size of the compressed file and estimated download times for four modem speeds.
To optimise and save a JPEG file 1.
Choose File > Export > JPEG Optimiser.
The JPEG Optimiser dialogue box appears.
The preview windows show the current image on the left and the resulting JPEG file on the right.
2.
Click the Quality tab, and set or type a value in the Set compression value to control.
3.
Choose a colour sampling method from the Chroma Subsampling drop-list if you want to change the default setting.
4.
Click the Background Colour tab, click the Background colour box, and choose a colour.
5.
Click the Format tab and choose one of the following options: • Standard — downloads one line a time, starting from the top • Progressive — displays incrementally in several passes, and detail is added each time 6.
Click OK to open the Save As dialogue box, navigate to the folder in which you want to save the new image, and type a name for the file.
7.
Click Save.
To use the JPEG Wizard 1.
Choose File > Export > JPEG Optimiser.
The JPEG Optimiser dialogue box appears.
2.
Click Use Wizard and follow the instructions.
3.6 Working with PNG Files Corel Paint Shop Pro lets you optimise PNG files to maximize quality and minimize file size.
The PNG Optimiser dialogue box contains three tabs where you configure the colour, transparency, and format options of the file.
The fourth page displays estimated download times of the image at various modem speeds.
176  MBE 817 MODULE 4 PNG Optimiser Colours tab You can choose the colour depth for the PNG file — the greater the colour depth, the longer it takes to download the image.
Use this tab to select a colour depth for your PNG image and, for paletted images, the method of colour reduction, number of colours, and amount of dithering.
PNG Optimiser Gamma tab PNG images contain a gAMA chunk, which controls gamma levels of an image.
The gamma setting helps the image appear consistent across multiple display devices.
If in doubt, you should use the default PC value.
PNG Optimiser Transparency tab You can choose to base transparency on existing image or layer transparency, or you can sample the colour in the image that you want to make transparent.
If you have a selection in your image, you can base the transparency on the selection.
You can also base transparency on the Alpha channel.
PNG Optimiser Format tab PNG images can be interlaced or non-interlaced, which affects how the image is displayed on a computer with a slow Internet connection.
PNG Optimiser Download Times tab This tab displays the size of the compressed file and an estimate of the download time at four modem speeds.
To optimise and save a PNG file 1.
Choose File > Export PNG Optimiser.
The PNG Optimiser dialogue box appears.
The preview windows show the current image on the left and the resulting PNG file on the right.
2.
Click the Colours tab, and choose one of the following image type options • Palette-Based — for images with 256 colours or less • Grayscale (8-bit) • 16.7 million colour (24-bit) If you choose the Palette-Based method, you can choose how many colours are used in the image and how much dithering is applied.
177  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.
Click the Transparency tab, and choose one of the following transparency types • No transparency — saves the image without transparency • Single colour transparency — lets you make one colour transparent by clicking a colour swatch or clicking a colour in the image, and entering a value in the Tolerance control.
• Alpha channel transparency — uses the current selection or alpha channel transparency of the image.
Choose what part of the image will be transparent by choosing Existing image or layer transparency, Inside the current selection, or Outside the current selection option.
4.
Click the Gamma tab, and set or type a value in the Gamma control if you want to change the default value.
5.
Click the Format tab, choose one of the following options: • Non-interlaced — the image downloads one line at a time, starting from the top • Interlaced — the image is displayed incrementally in several passes; detail is added with each pass.
Use this option with larger images so that the viewer can get an idea of how the image looks while waiting for it to download 6.

It is always noted that when a website is opened, an object or objects is moving or a text string is changing or moving on the page.
This event is called animation.
That is adding of special visual or sound effect to a text of an object.
Some application packages have animation as a rudimentary application component, while in some, like Power Point, this is well developed.
Animation Shop is a specialised package for these major activities of design.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: Bring animation into a web design using Animation Shop wizard to: • save animation • optimise animation file • create new animations • explain the effect and transitions.
182  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Creating Animation with Animation Shop Animation Shop is a powerful yet easy-to-use program that creates animations from one or more graphic images and offers a wide variety of effects and transitions for enhancing animations.
Used as a standalone application or as a complement to Paint Shop, animation Shop allows users to easily create animations for use on a Web site or in a presentation.
Animation Shop’s straightforward interface allows anyone to create effective buttons, banners or other animated effects without a steep learning curve.
3.2 Using the Program’s Wizards The Animation Wizard provides a quick, automated way to create an animation.
Once you start up the wizard, you are guided through the process by a series of simple wizard pages on which you choose all the properties you’ll need to create an animation.
Starting the wizard • Start the Animation Wizard in one of these ways: i.
Choose File>Animation Wizard, or ii.
Click the Animation Wizard button on the toolbar.
• A series of wizard pages will appear, prompting you in creating an animation.
After finishing each page, click the Next button at the bottom of the page to move to the next page.
You may more forward or backward by clicking the Back and Next buttons to Wizard pages.
The first page of the Animation Wizard prompts you to set dimensions of the animation frames.
• Choose the “same size as the first image frame” option if you want all frames to match the size of the first frame (you will then add the first frame in a later Wizard page).
• Choose the “As defined here” option to activate the Width and Height edit the boxes for you to set the exact dimensions of the animation frames.
Dimensions are measured in pixels.
• Click Next to move to the next Wizard page.
183  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT The second page of the Animation Wizard prompts you to set a transparent or an opaque canvas colour.
• Choose the “Transparent” option to allow any images behind your animation to show through in the canvas.
A transparent canvas is indicated by the current colour setting in the “Transparency” tab of the General Program Preferences.
• Choose the “Opaque” option to select a canvas colour for your animation.
The current canvas colour appears in the colour box to the right of this option.
Left-click inside this box to display the Colour dialogue box; right-click inside this box to display the Recent Colours dialogue box.
You can then choose your custom colour.
The canvas will use the dimensions you set in the previous Wizard page.
• Click Next to move to the next Wizard page.
The third page of the Animation Wizard prompts how to place frames in the animation.
If the images to be added do not have he same dimension as the frame size, then set in the first Wizard page, choose one of the following positioning options: 184  MBE 817 MODULE 4 • Choose the “Upper left corner of frame” option to align all images having aspect rations different than the first image in the upper left corner of their image in the upper left corner of their respective frames.
• Choose the “Centred in the frame” option to centre all images in their frame regardless of each image’s aspect ration.
• If an image's dimensions are smaller than the first image, the empty area surrounding the image can be filled in one of two ways: • Choose the “With the canvas colour” option to fill in the smaller- sized image’s empty area with the canvas colour.
• Choose the “With the preceding frame’s contents” option to fill in the smaller-sized image’s empty area with the contents of the previous frame.
If there is no previous frame, the “with canvas colour” option will be used.
• If images need to be scaled frames to fit inside frames: Mark the “Scale frames to fit” check box.
This will resize o the image to fill the frame while maintaining the image’s aspect ration.
If you do not mark this check box, parts of images that have large dimensions than the frame size may not be visible.
• Click Next to move to the next Wizard page.
The fourth page of the Animation Wizard prompts you in setting the looping and delay animation properties.
• Choose the “Yes, repeat the animation indefinitely” option to continuously cycle your animation until you manually stop it (see the Note below).
Choose the “play it in times” option to play your animation the number of times you set in the edit box.
• Set the display time for each frame in the display time edit box.
All frames in the animation will be set to the same display time.
These values can be changed later while editing the animation.

The fifth page of the Animation Wizard prompts you in adding images to your animation.
You must include at least one image to create an animation.
• Click the Add Image button.
The open dialogue box will appear.
• Choose the file(s) for your animation.
• To select multiple images at once from the Open dialogue box, hold the <Ctrl> key while clicking on filenames.
You can also select consecutive files by holding <Shift> and clicking on the first and last filenames in your selection.
If your image files are located in more than one folder, you will need to re-enter the Open dialogue box for each folder.
• If you wish to delete an image you have added to the list, do so by clicking on the filename to select it and then clicking the Remove Image button.
• Verify the order of your images and reorder any of them by selecting one or more image files and clicking on the Move Up and Move Down buttons.
• At the end of adding images, click the Next button to move to the final Wizard page.
186  MBE 817 MODULE 4 The final page of the Animation Wizard prompts you to finalize the Wizard to create the animation.
• Click the Finish button.
The Animation Wizard will generate your animation, close the Animation wizard pages, and open the animation in a Frames View window.
• To see what your animation looks like when played, choose View > Animation, or click the View Animation button on the toolbar.
• The Play View window will appear and the animation will play.
3.3 Saving Animation • To save changes to an animation, choose File > Save, or click the Save button on the toolbar.
If you are saving modifications to a previously saved animation but are not choosing a different animation format, choosing Save will simply save the file to the hard disk.
• If you are performing either of the following actions: Saving a new animation o 187  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Saving an existing animation to another file format by o choosing File> Save As.
• The Save As dialogue box will appear.
Available file formats include GIF, MNG, AVI, FLC, ANI, and FLI.

But is does not really support dynamic web design where text, images and animation are moving around on the screen.
In this unit, we shall look at a dynamic web animation application for easy and quick design of animation on a web page.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • list the requirements to viewing flash movies • draw and explain Macromedia flash workspace • use Flash tools to draw, paint, fill, erase, select, resize, move, reshape, and transform objects in flash workspace • add text using text tool • segment and group objects.
196  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Multimedia Flash Traditionally, these effects were achieved with animated GIF images or java applets.
Flash is web dynamic application software that blends text, graphics and animation together in an unimaginable way for a fanciful web design.
Flash are small programs, like java applets, that can be embedded into HTML pages.
It is easier to create animation in flash without programming skills.
Unlike animation GIF, Flash supports interactivity.
In Flash, user can simply control animation.
This makes dynamic web design more interesting with Flash, and user can make significant progress in his/her design in a very short time.
3.2 Viewing Flash Movies In order to view flash movies, a flash player is needed or Flash plug-in to be installed.
The shockwave Flash plug-in come with the newest Netscape browser and from Windows 98 upward.
It is also available for downloading free on the Internet from Macromedia site.
3.3 Flash Drawing and Painting Tools The tools in the toolbox allow the user to draw, paint, select, and modify artwork, as well as change the view of the Stage.
If it doesn’t appear, go to Window>Tools.
The toolbox is divided into four (4) sections: i.
The Tools section – contains drawing, painting and selection tools ii.
The View section – contains tools for zooming and painting in the application window.
iii.
The Colour section – contains modifiers for stroke and fill colours iv.
The Option section displays modifiers fro the selected tool, which affect the tool’s painting or editing operations.
Drawing with Pencil Tool Pencil tool is used in much the same way a real life pencil is used to draw.
Simply select the tool and drag on the Stage to draw with the pencil tool.
You can press the Shift key while dragging to constrain line to vertical or horizontal directions.
You also specify the colour with the Stroke Colour Tool.
You can apply smoothing and straightening to the lines by setting the Pencil mode modifier.
197  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT • click the Pencil tool and choose Straighten from the Pencil Mode modifier.
• on the Stage, try to draw a line.
• next draw a square and a rectangle • Choose Smooth from the Pencil Mode modifier and draw a wave • try to use the other mode modifier.
When you select the Pencil tool, the Property Inspector displays its settings.
You can select the colour, the thickness and the style of the line draw with the Pencil tool.
Drawing with Oval Tool The oval tool is used to make circular objects.
• Select the tool and drag on the Stage to draw a circle that spans between the start and the end point.
• Press the Shift key while dragging to ensure your circle is perfectly round • Specify the colours with the Stroke and Fill Colour Tools.
Drawing with Rectangle Tool The Rectangle Tool is used to make rectangle objects.
• Select the tool and drag on the Stage to draw the rectangle that spans between the start and the end points.
• Press Shift key while dragging to constrain the proportions to for the rectangle, to ensure the rectangle I s a perfect square.
• Specify the colours with the Stroke and Fill Colour tools • Specify rounding of the corners with the with Round Rectangle Options at the bottom of the toolbox.
Drawing Lines with Line Tool The Line tool is pretty much the same as with the Pencil tool except that it can only draw straight line • Select Line tool and drag on the Stage to draw a straight line between a start and end points • Press the Shift key while dragging to constraint the possible angles for the line.
By default this will only allow for lines that are either horizontal, vertical or 45 degrees between.
• Change the stroke colour because Line tool only draws outline.
198  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.4 Painting and Filling Shapes Painting with Paint Brush Paint Brush tool draws brush-like strokes, as if you were painting.
It allows user to create special effects including calligraphic effects.
It draws both a fill and an outline.
Shift key can be pressed while dragging to constrain drawing to vertical or horizontal directions Brush Modes Specify the brush Modes in order to define the way the tool works • Paint Normal – paints over lines and fills on the same layer • Paint Behind – paints in blank areas of the Stage on the same layer, leaving lines and fills unaffected • Paint Selection – applies a new fill to the selection when you select the Fill Modifier or the Fill panel.
• Paint Fills – paints fills an empty area, leaving lines unaffected.
• Paint Inside – paints the fill in which you start a brush stroke and never paint lines.
This works much like a smart colouring book that never allows you to paint outside the lines.
If you start the point in an empty area, the fill doesn’t affect any existing fill areas.
Brush Size: In Brush options, there is a drop that lets you select the size of the brush.
Simply click the brush you want.
Brush Shape: This option lets you select the shape of the brush.
Experiment this with different shapes and see the effect.
Filling with Paint Bucket tool This tool can change the colour of the existing paint and also fill empty areas surrounded by lines.
It can paint with solid colours, gradient fills and bitmap fills.
Paint Bucket tool can also be used to adjust the size, direction and centre of gradient and bitmap fills.
It can also be used to fill areas that not entirely enclosed.
Draw a circle with Oval tool • Click the Paint Bucket tool and click the Colour tool and choose the gradient colour • Click the middle of the circle and fill it with gradient colour • Choose one of the Close options to have Paint Bucket tool fill a shape that has gaps.
199  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Using the Fill Transform tool This tool can adjust the size, direction or centre of a gradient bitmap fill.
• Select the Fill Transform tool • Click on the shape fill with gradient fill – the centre point and the bounding box appear together with the editing handles • Experiment with each handle to change the width, size and the rotation of the fill.
Ink Bottle tool This tool is used to change the stroke colour, line width and style of lines or shape outlines.
It is specifically used for lines.
• Click the Ink Bottle tool • Change the stroke properties using the Property Inspector such as colour, width size and style of the stroke.
• With the tip of the Ink Bottle pointer, click on the edge of the oval.
3.5 Erasing The Erase tool works like a classic eraser.
It is simply selected and drag over the Stage on the object to be erased.
When double click, it deletes everything on the Stage.
Using Eraser Mode Option Specify the Eraser Mode in the options listed at the bottom of the toolbox.
Erase Normal – erases strokes and fills on the same layer Erase Fills – erases only fills; stroke are not affected Erase lines – erases only strokes, fills are not affected Erase selected fills – erases only the currently selected fills and does not affect strokes, selected or not.
Erase Inside – erases only the fill on which you begin the eraser.
Faucet Options This option is used to remove segments of filled areas • Select the Eraser tool • Click the Faucet modifier • Click the stroke segment or filled areas you want to delete 200  MBE 817 MODULE 4 3.6 Selecting Objects To modify an object, it must be first selected.
Macromedia provides a variety of methods for making selections, such as Arrow tool, Lasso tool, and keyboard commands.
Flash highlights objects and strokes that have been selected with a dot pattern.
Selected boxes are highlighted with bounding boxes in outline layer colour that contains selected group.
3.7 Selecting Objects Using the Arrow tool It allows selection of entire set of objects by clicking an object or dragging to enclose the object(s) within a rectangular selection marquee To select an object: • Select the Arrow tool and • Click the object To select connected lines • Select the Arrow and • Double-click on of the lines To select a filled shape and its stroked outline • Select the Arrow tool and • Double-click the fill To select objects within a rectangle area • Select the Arrow tool • Drag a marquee around the object or objects you want to select (instances, groups, and type must be completely enclosed in the selection).
3.8 Moving Objects Objects can be moved with mouse • Select the Arrow tool • Select the line • Click on the line while holding down the mouse button, move to the new position Or Use the arrow key on the keyboard to move the object 201  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.9 Reshaping Lines and Shapes Use Arrow tool to turn a straight line into a curve.
Make sure the line is selected • Select the Arrow tool • Click on the line, and while holding down the mouse button, drag the curve.
• Release the mouse button and the curve is finished.
3.10 Transforming Objects Free transform tool is use to transform objects, groups, instances or text blocks.
Transformation can be performed individually or you can combine several transformations, such as moving, rotating, skewing, and distortion • Move the pointer over and around the selection • The pointer changes to indicate the available transformation function on the selection.
3.11 Segmenting and Grouping When you place a line or shape of the same colour to overlap each other, Flash will automatically combine them into one shape or line.
If the overlapping is on different colours, Flash will segment them when you move them away.
These effects can be prevented by groping the objects.
Grouping Objects: • Select the objects you want to group • Click Modify>Group • Modify the content of the content of the group by double-clicking using the Arrow tool on the object • When you finish, double-click outside the group.
3.12 Adding Text Using Text Tool To create text, place text block on the Stage using the Text tool.
When creating static text, it can be placed on a single line, this expands as you type; or in a fixed-width block, or fixed-height block that respectively expands and wraps words automatically.
You can create a fixed-width by dragging the handle on the corner of a text block.
Set the font and paragraph attributes of text using the Property Inspector.
In creating a 202  MBE 817 MODULE 4 text, Flash uses current text attributes.
To change the font attribute of existing text, you must first select the text.
Breaking text apart • Click the Arrow tool • Choose Modify>Break Apart.
This will break the text into individual characters.
• Choose Modify Break Apart again to convert them into shapes • Now you can manipulate the text.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline how to use Paint Bucket to fill an oval object.
Show the result of the steps.
4.0 CONCLUSION The complexity of coding is an enormous task for animation of objects.
Application software like Macromedia Flash becomes an inevitable tool for animation design in web-based programming.
This application relieves the designer of the web of another dimension of programming possibly from learning how to code in java.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we studied Macromedia Flash as a package that can be used ease animation in web design rather the stressful exercise of coding.
The requirements for Flash movie were mentioned.
Various tools used for animation design were discussed in sufficient detail.
Objects’ movement, shaping, transformation, segmentation, and grouping were discussed, and the schematic steps to carry these operations out were outlined.
More so, the unit explained manipulation of text as an essential component of animation.

Planning is the bedrock o f every good success.
If there is good planning and commitment to the plan, there would definitely be a desired success.
It is not all successful projects that best serve the designers effectively but rather a successful and maintained project.
Website designs not an exception to this golden rule of life, in fact it is more required in this most dynamic activity of life.
Before designing a site, there must be a good plan, the plan must follow a standard to which the designer must be committed, although innovations that may improve the quality of the design may come in the course of the design and implementation.
After the design, the site must be maintained through regular improvement and updating.
203  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • set a plan overview of the site to be designed • set the design architecture • describe interface design • draw a good layout style for a design project • maintain the site for consistent use.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Site Planning and Management Site planning and management is the life wire of a site.
An unplanned site will produce a poor outlook with many deficiencies in operation, and eventually discouragement to the clients visiting the site.
An un- updated site contains old tails; also un-maintained site will soon go into extinct.
So the interface, the navigation, the menu/button architecture, the page layout, the database etc.
must be adequately planned and maintained.
This unit consider a broad overview of site planning and management.
3.2 Designing the Architecture of a Site Design architecture of a site requires series of questions to be answered by the designer of the site.
These probing questions spell out the mostly the entire demand from the site.
Some standard questions to be considered by a website designer are highlighted below: 1.
If one currently exists, what are the good and bad points of the existing site?
2.
What is the purpose of the proposed site?
3. Who are the Potential Users?
• Potential students • Existing students • The 2 above • Other researchers • Funding bodies, Industry with lots of money 4.
What do those potential users want?
• Interesting projects • A way of telling the world about their projects • Looking for opportunity to collaborate • Looking for new products that will make them lots of money 204  MBE 817 MODULE 5 5.
What is the communication goal to each group of potential users?
• Persuade them to do a research project in the lab • To secure a job • For collaborate in research or business • Gross income multiplier (GIM) - lots of money 6.
Are there corporate constraints that you have to conform to?
• University • Informatics • International software standard • Clients culture • Personal design potentials 7.
What information could be presented?
• existing research projects • future research projects - risky • research students • research equipment • staff and their interests • research papers, thesis and publications - list of pdf • Sports and Games • Legendaries • Subjects and education • Business information 8.
How do you structure the information?
• by categories, or • by in list for, or • by as set of links, or • by departments, or • a way yet to be determined 9.
What is the purpose of the laboratory?
• to do research • to build robots • to train students in research • to get grants • to publish papers • to develop web pages 10.
Why would any of the potential users bother to look at the site?
11.
Is it worth developing?
After all these consideration, the designer may then decide whether to continue with the design of leave it.
205  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 3.3 Layout and Human Interface After been convince of the need to continue the design, the next thin to put into consideration is the in interface of the site.
The interface can attract or dispel the clients that visit the design.
In designing the interface, some principles should serve as guide for the builder of the site.
3.4 Interface Design Principles 1.
Feel natural to the user: use an abstraction of a situation we are familiar with e.g.
spread sheet to an accountant 2.
Put the user in control: the user decides what next not the computer.
The User wants to know: Where am I?
What can I do here?
How did I get here?
How do I get back?
Return to index at the bottom of every page; Use feedback to inform the user and give her confidence 3.
Consistency: eliminates ambiguity; the same symbol should always mean the same thing the same icon should always cause the same action 4.
Redundancy causes confusion: more than one way to do something can confuse user, although this may be justified for different input modes - text link + image rollover, many similar options may clutter user interface 5.
Consistent style: consistent look and feel help many pages in a site to feel part of a whole site; change to site look and feel can go to a new site or sub-site; re-using buttons etc will speed up down loads due to caching 6.
On dynamic pages always give the user the opportunity to validate input, this eliminates costly errors entering the system, and gives the user confidence 3.5 Page Layout Styles A good layout style achieves the following goals: • consistent look and feel through out site • useful Information presented in an attractive manner.
• fluid navigation with simple fast links.
• reduced time in web development through use of templates 206  MBE 817 MODULE 5 3.5.1 Purpose of top (home) page The home page: • serves as the front door which is to be opened to get in • is an index to the site • provides Information about the site • provides information about the establishment • should give everything you ever want to know about the site Top page should be meaningful even when no images have been down loaded.
Limit the information detail on each page - users don't scroll, they navigate using the visible options.
A sense of proportion brings relationship between elements and should not be cluttered There should be content hierarchy: • what is the 1st thing you want users to notice on your page?
• when you open a page, what are the 1st 3 things you notice?
• do this match up with the goals of the site?
Abuse of screen space should be avoided (negative space) The content of the home pages should be structured and not random Navigation or Information: How much of screen area is used for navigation?
is a question that needs to be answered.
Good pages should be dominated by content of interest to user, not by navigation (at least 50% preferably 80% of area should be content) 3.5.2 Comparing pages The following questions should be asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the layout: • What is the 1st thing you notice?
• What use is made of colour?
- monotone, 2 or 3 colours, conservative, bright, overbearing • What use is made of depth?
- flat, depth by shading, 3D • Is related information grouped?
- is grouping effective?
• How are those groups separated?
- negative space, colour, navigation style • Are several navigation styles used?
- how are they separated?
• What is the proportion of content to navigation?
207  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT • What is your emotional response to the page?
- bored, excited, like to be here 3.5.3 Common Layout Styles Bland: this is uninteresting, lacking in creativity, not attractive.
Simple Index Style: navigation dominates, not much information content, efficient, not very creative.
Advanced Index Style: use graphics, images, roll overs to give more attractive feel and to increase information content.
Graphical Index Style: increases content with images of products - this one is gaudy, without a lot of content.
Popup Menu Style: caters for multiple users, gives large indexes without using lots of space, modeless interface.
Side Tab Style: wastes page space below the tabs, suited to frames Top Tab Style: at top of every page -> consistent look and feel, flexible navigation, user can get to anywhere in site from any page, minimises use of page space for navigation, and allows the use of components and templates.
Site Navigation Whether you use buttons, roll overs, tabs, or text links to navigate as a site grows it can become a tangled web of interconnections if you don't plan it.
The result is a site that is difficult to navigate and expensive to maintain.
There are two views of site layout: the navigation view and the links view Navigation view: this view connects the pages in the site together Links view: the page links the various digital contents in the website, text files, graphical objects, and video contents.
208  MBE 817 MODULE 5 3.6 Site Maintenance Web activities is highly competitive, for a site to met regular demand of users, it must be maintained.
Maintenance entails regular update of website information/database and security of data from corruption and unauthorised access either on the repository or during transmission.
The follow must be regular activities of site designer or owner: 3.6.1 Regular Updates In most cases, every client visiting a site is expecting the latest information on the site or search item(s).
One crucial demand of every websites is a regular update on information on the site.
User are always excited when retrieve an article on the day it was published on the web.
Consistent occurrence of such makes the client a regular customer of the site and an advocate of the site to his/her user group.
So it is required that information on the site be updated regularly 3.6.2 Database Security The most important asset of an organisational dynamic website is the site’s database.
Every effort must be put in place to ensure high security of the database.
There are various ways to keep a database secure: A. Passwords A password is a secret code that offers a user access to a database for creation, modification or deletion.
There are two types of passwords to database access.
The type of password protection chosen determines the level of user access’s to the database and the objects it contains.
i.
Database password With database password, users must enter that password before they are allowed to open the database.
Adding a database password is an easy way to prevent unwanted users from opening your database; however, once a database is open, no other security measures are provided unless user-level security has been defined as well.
Database password is stored in an unencrypted form.
If this will compromise the security of the password-protected database, then define user-level security to control access to sensitive data in that database.
ii.
Security account passwords User-level security passwords are used for a workgroup.
When user- level security has been defined for a workgroup; you can use a security 209  MBE 817 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT account password.
A security account password ensures that no user can log on using another user's name.
B.
Temporarily Restricting Database Access This is another measure use to secure the contents of a database.
Database administrator, often needs to temporarily restrict access to a database during maintenance.
The best way to do this is to put the database in single-user mode or to allow only members of database owner, database creator, and system administrator to access the database.
C. Data Encryption or decryption Encrypting a database compacts the database file, and makes it indecipherable by a utility program or word processor.
Encrypting a database doesn't restrict access to objects by users.
Decrypting a database reverses the encryption.
One must either be the owner of the database or, if the database is secured, a member of the Administration group with “open exclusive” permission to encrypt or decrypt the database.
It is recommended that a copy of the original database under a different name, drive, or folder before encrypting it.
During transmission on the communication channels, it is possible to intercept data packets by the hackers; this may be to spy the content of the packet or to corrupt the packet making it unusable by the client.
Therefore, data encryption is necessary to prevent hackers during data transmission.
3.6.3 Authentication of Web User When building a Web site for a company intranet or a commercial server for Internet commerce, the first step in securing the Web application is to understand the relationship of operating system and the Web server application (e.g.
IIS) security processes.
Authentication is the process of determining the identity of a user.
Once a user has been positively identified, Web Server application can then control what resources that user can access.
3.6.4 Securing ASP and HTML Pages The primary function of Web Server is to download, under controlled access conditions, HTML and ASP pages from the local server to the remote browser.
Ensure limited access to the application's Web pages and graphics by setting directory and file permissions on the .htm, .asp, and .gif files.
210  MBE 817 MODULE 5 Also, access can be programmatically controlled to certain pages by establishing user-level permissions in a Session object.
Let the user provide a logon name and password, and then validate the information against a database.
Once a legitimate user is identified, get the user's permission level and store it in a Session object for later use.
Then one can hide certain HTML links based on the permission level that is stored in that user's Session objects.
4.0 CONCLUSION It is not an over-emphasis to say that the usage and dependability a website depend directly on planning and maintenance of the site.
An unplanned site will automatically produce a poor design.
A poor design looses clients’ interests and confidence in the site.
Therefore, there is need for pre-planning of a web design and its post-implementation maintenance.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has emphasised the need for planning and maintenance in a web design like any other software design.
Probing questions that can facilitate a good web design were raced under designing the architecture of the site.
Human interface and page layout styles, which are fascinating to the site users were explained in sufficient details.
Justice was also done to maintenance of the site’s components like the database, web server application, and the applications in the client-tier and middle-tier layers – HTML and ASP respectively.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Theory i Enumerate the web design interface principles you have studied in this unit.
Practical assignments ii.
