It has to do principally with the art of successfully conveying intended ideas or meaning by skilful combination of words in a sentences or phrase.
Al-ma’ani protects speakers or writers from using an expression which may not suit the situation for which the expression is meant by providing him guidance in knowing different usages of Arabic words.
For instance it explains the original meaning of a word and some other possible meanings which the word may convey in various situations.
For example, a word can originally be imperative al-Amr and can equally be used in some situations for request al-Itimas; wish al-Tamanna; threatening at-Tahdid; option al-Takhyr; weakness at-Ta’jiz and so on.
In this Unit the concept of ilm-l-maani will be introduced, and the types of sentences will also be explained.
1.2 OBJECTIVES By the end of this Unit, you should be able to understand - The meaning of ilm-l-maani - The kinds of sentences 1.3 MAIN CONTENTS Al-ma'ani is the study which ensures that a speech agrees with what situation requires.
According to As-sakkaki (1983)"It is an art of successfully conveying intended ideas by skillful combination of precise words at relevant or suitable context of situation" It is in line with this that the Arabs have said: ل(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) م(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (Every situation has its own specific style of expression) sentences in Arabic is classified into two kinds 3  (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)ا Which literally means information but referred to by Arabic rhetoricians as a statement which is possible to be proved true or false?
ء(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)إ Which literally means origination but referred to by Arabic rhetoricians as an origination sentence which falsehood or truthfulness cannot be proved, because the action is going to be originated after the speech has been uttered.
The purpose of at-khabar was stated to be primary and secondary.
The primary purpose could be fa'dat-l-khabar when the listener is hearing the information for the first time or Lazim-ul- fa'dat when one wants to show the listener that he has been aware of the information.
It is pertinent to mention that an information may be given rhetorically for certain purpose other than the two mentioned above.
Some of these purposes are : (1) (cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:5)ا (cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:5)ا Sadden / Regret One poet says: ةد(cid:22)(cid:23) (cid:24)(cid:25) (cid:26)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:27)(cid:28) ب(cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:5)ا (cid:30)هذ ب(cid:1)!

(2) (cid:17)+ (cid:2),(cid:5) ا ر(cid:9)(cid:2)!
*ا (To show ones weakness) This is when the speaker gives the information for the purpose of making the gathering know about his weakness.
For example: (cid:9)آ(cid:9)&ا %.
(cid:9)+(cid:5)ا ك0(cid:3)(cid:23) 1!

IBTIDA'YUN:- This is information given to someone who does not have any foreknowledge.
This person is empty minded (Khalyat-ad-dhihn).
Hence the information is given without any emphasis.
For example: Q(cid:25)ا Oه(cid:1)?
(cid:18) (cid:24)(cid:25) ا(cid:22)+Pر (cid:24)#(cid:1)(cid:28)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:27)(cid:5)ا نإ The travellers returned from their journey 2.
Talabiyyun:- This is the one when the person spoken to has some doubt about the truthfulness of information.
In addressing such person.
It is necessary to put the particles of emphasis in order to convince him.
3.
Inkariyyun :- This is the one used when the person spoken to is in state of rejecting the information .
In addressing, such a person we will need many particles of emphasis as much as possible to convince him.
For example: (cid:23)(cid:4)ا (cid:24)ه(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:13) (cid:28)(cid:4) ا(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31)ر !
(cid:28)"(cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:2)#$(cid:9)ا نّ إ It is pertinent to mention that every sentence, whether khabar or insha’ is made up of two components parts: musnad ilayh (the subject) and musnad(the predicate).
The former is also called mahktum ’alyh (the topic) and the latter rmahktum bihi (the command).
All other lexical items in the sentence beside mudaf (the possessive or the second noun of the genitive construction) or sillah (the relative) are regarded as restriction.

Insha’ talabi and insha’ ghayrul-talabi.
Insha’ talabi is the one that contains the meaning of request.
Insha’ ghayru talabi is the one that does not contain the meaning of a request.
In this unit, you are going to learn about the different kinds of Insha’ and its subdivisions.
Also, the concept of Amr will be discussed and its metaphorical meaning will be emphasised.
2.2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to understand - The meaning of Insha’talabi - The meaning of al-Amr - The metaphorical meaning of Amr 2.3 MAIN CONTENTS There are two kinds of al-insha (1) Al-insha al-Talabi (Requistional) :- This is the one that consists the meaning of request.
e.g.
ب(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) Don't drink (2) Al-insha ghayr al-Talabi (Non-requistional):- This is the one that does not contain the meaning of request e.g.
ق0S(cid:5)ا >(cid:27)Pأ (cid:9)(cid:25) How beautiful is the truthfulness KINDS OF INSHA AL-TALABI There are five kinds of Al-Insha al-Talabi.

For example: When a man requests from Allah to pardon and have mercy on him.

expand me my breast "Ease my task for me And remove the impediment from my speech (2) Guidance :- د(cid:9)Vر9ا It can be used to advice and guide someone.
For example : Imam Ali adviced his son and said: 9 (cid:30)(cid:15)& (cid:9)(cid:27)آ (cid:24)(cid:14)8أ W$(cid:5)إ (cid:24)(cid:14)(cid:15)# نأ "Do goodness as you want the others to do unto you".
(3) Continuity :- ماو0(cid:2)(cid:5)ا This is usually when it is directed to someone who has already performed an action by the time of the request.
For example: When you tell someone who is sitting " Q(cid:2)LPا" this means continue sitting.
Another example of continuity is in the Qur'an 4 vs. 136, when it says: (cid:26)L(cid:18)رو Y(cid:9)5 ا(cid:22)"(cid:25)X ا(cid:22)"(cid:25)X (cid:24)#4(cid:5)ا (cid:9)!#(cid:19)# O you who believe, believe in Allah and His Apostles.
4.5(cid:16)6(cid:13)(cid:5)اObtative: - This is a statement used to express the desire for something which is not possible to happen.
For example: Antarah bn.
Sheddid said : %(cid:27)Lّ@& ءا(cid:22)A(cid:5)(cid:9)5 IL(cid:3)(cid:23) راد(cid:9)# %(cid:27)L(cid:18)او IL(cid:3)(cid:23) راد (cid:9)8(cid:9)(cid:3).
%(cid:27)(cid:23)و Oh!
Talk, the house of Ablata in Jawa; Goodmorning house of ablata and be with peace.
(5) Selection: - (cid:1)$$(cid:4)(cid:16)(cid:5)ا It is used in choosing one thing from the other.

Neither speak thy Prayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between."
(6) Threatening: 0#0!
(cid:16)(cid:5)ا This is given order in a threatening form to do something unsatisfactorily in a tone that shows fright and warning.
Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said Fـءـ (cid:9)(cid:14) HI(cid:9); H(cid:13)'C 9(cid:5) اذا “if it does not cause you to be ashamed, then do whatever you like.
The aim of the above tradition is not to order the shameless person to do whatever he likes but to warn him against shameless acts.
For example: %(cid:5)(cid:9)$Lّ(cid:5)ا I(cid:3)2(cid:9)(cid:23) [(cid:4)& O(cid:5) اذإ ء(cid:9)(cid:10)& (cid:9)(cid:25) <".
(cid:9)(cid:28) %(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:14)& O(cid:5)و If you do not fear the wrath of the night and you do not feel shy, do whatever you like.
The Holy Qur'an says: ر(cid:9)"(cid:5)ا %(cid:5)إ Oآ(cid:1)$S(cid:25)ّ ن\(cid:28) ا(cid:22)+(cid:16)(cid:27)& >2 Tell, the disbelieving folks continue your enjoyment certainly your end is hellfire.
In the above verse, Almighty Allah is not commanding the disbelieving folks to enjoy but he is threatening them with a painful chastisement after their enjoyment in the world.
(7) Equality:- I#(cid:22)(cid:14)(cid:16)(cid:5)ا This is to show that two things which are apparently different from one another are the same in effect due to the prevailing circumstances.

For example, a mother prohibition her son from leaving home until she returns.
Unlike Amr, there is only one form of expressing this.
It is to place the imperfect juggive verb after La of prohibition <Pرا %(cid:16)8 را0(cid:5)ا (cid:24)(cid:25) ج(cid:1)(cid:4)& (cid:12) Do not leave the house until I return Almighty Allah says in the Holy Qur'an: (cid:9)!8U.ا 0+5 %(cid:28)ر(cid:12)ا %(cid:28) او0(cid:14)?&(cid:12)و Do not make mischief in the earth after it has been refined (cid:24)(cid:14)8ا %ه %(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:9)5 (cid:12)ا O$(cid:16)$(cid:5)ا ل(cid:9)(cid:25) ا(cid:22)5(cid:1)6&(cid:12)و Do not draw near the orphan's property except with what is good The Principal of the school told his students O@&(cid:9)(cid:3)Pاو ،ا(cid:22)L(cid:27)!& (cid:12)و ،ر4(cid:23) (cid:1)$T5 ا(cid:22)(cid:3)$T(cid:16)& (cid:12)و ،I(cid:18)ر0(cid:27)(cid:5)ا 0$(cid:23)ا(cid:22)(cid:25) (cid:24)(cid:23) او(cid:1)Zّ (cid:19)(cid:16)& (cid:12) Do not keep late to the school, do not absent yourself without reason.

However, interrogation may be used out of it original meaning according to the structure of the expression and circumstances.
So, the thrust of this unit is to explain some of the contextual meaning of Istifham.
5.2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to - Understand the metaphorical meaning of istifham - Understand the function of al-Istifham 5.3 MAIN CONTENTS Interrogative particles are used rhetorically in sentence so as to impress or persuade somebody on an action done or to be done respectively.
Therefore the interrogative particles are rhetorically used differently to perform other functions.
These functions include: (1) Negation (cid:21)F(cid:27)+(cid:9)ا This implies when the question tends to negate the fact instead of asking for information.
For example, Allah says (cid:21)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:19)إ ن(cid:2)#(cid:11)R(cid:9) (cid:23),(cid:9) نأو – Nothing is for man except what he did.
(Q53: 39) Here "I " negate the idea of a man thinking that will be and with what he does not do.
ن(cid:2)#STا (cid:19)إ ن(cid:2)#STا ءا@(cid:31) (cid:7)ه (cid:7)ه Is used to mean (cid:2)(cid:4) (2) Denying ر(cid:2)(cid:8)(cid:11)Tا ا(cid:26))از (cid:21)#(cid:4)ا (cid:26)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:9)ا (cid:26)V" (cid:7)ه (cid:26)5(cid:17)1 م96 7,(cid:22) (cid:21)(cid:4)ر نا 24 “the fact that a boy threw a stone to the filled sea can not affect it” (3) Confirmation: (cid:26)F"(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:9)ا It is a way of re-confirming and emphasizing the truthfulness of an action or information about a particular person.

It is the fourth aspect of Insha’ at-Talabi.
At-Tamanni can be expressed for two purposes.
The first one is impossibility of realisation and the second is possibility but without access to it.
6.2 OBJECTIVES 28 At the end of this unit, you should be able to - know the meaning of at-tamanni - understand the particles of at-tamanni - know the purposes for which it can be expressed.
6.3 MAIN CONTENTS It basically referred to wishes which cannot themselves be achieved.
For example Ibn-a-r- Rumi said in the month of Ramadan.
ب(cid:2)(cid:17)#ّ (cid:9)ا (cid:26)ّ (cid:4) cر(cid:2)2(cid:11)(cid:26)ّ (cid:4)و .ا(cid:26)2E ن(cid:2)آ 7,(cid:22) (cid:7),<(cid:9)ّا (cid:10),<(cid:22) I wish the night in it is to be one month, and its day to be passed like the cloud.
The poet in the above verse is wishing the night" of Ramadan to be a month and its day to be quickly passed like the cloud so as to avoid the hunger and thirsty of days of Ramadan which is impossible to happen.
Quran says: 9ٍBcِ 1َ vٍّ 4َ و(cid:4)ُ(cid:5)َ 7ُ (cid:21)8إِ نُ ورُ (cid:9)#َ (cid:8)َ Cِوأُ (cid:9)(cid:14)َ 2َ ْd(cid:14)ِ (cid:9)(cid:16)َ(cid:5)َ Fَ Bْ(cid:5)َ (cid:9)(َ "Oh!
that we had the like of what Qarun has got!
for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!"
(Q28 vs 79) It is possible for the people of Qarun to have have what qarun had but did not have an access to such a big fortune and they are aware of that fact, so they only expressed the wish.
Jarir said: (cid:2)$(cid:8),<3 م9(cid:13) (cid:21)$<(cid:13) (cid:21)(cid:9)@+(cid:4) (cid:2)"أ ;(cid:31)اور (cid:28),:(cid:2)$(cid:9)ا ن(cid:2)(cid:4)ز`ا (cid:7)ه Oh!
Two houses of Salma peace be on you Can those gone period return.
Layta is the only basic particles of at-Tamanna.
However, some other participles may be used instead of layta for rhetorical purpose.
They are (cid:29)F(cid:9)and (cid:7)Fه (cid:7)ّ F(cid:30)(cid:9)و .They are use for Taraji (anticipational) 29 For example: (cid:28),(cid:4).$(cid:9)ا (cid:28)(cid:4) ن(cid:29)(cid:8)+(cid:22) ة(cid:26)ّ آ (cid:2)+(cid:9) نّ أ (cid:29)<(cid:22) (The disbeliever will say on the Day of Judgement) “if it is possible to come back to the world, then we shall among the believers” (but it is possible) Here (cid:29)(cid:9) is used to imply an optative statement in place of (cid:10),(cid:9) for a rhetorical purpose.
The person on the day of judgment will say (we wish we have a chance of return so that we shall truly be of those who believe (Q.
26: 102) However, a wish may sometimes be expressed for a thing which may occur i.e.
not absolutely impossible.
The particle often used for expressing this type of which are (cid:7)ّ (cid:30)(cid:9) and (cid:21)#3 For example: (1) ا(cid:26)(cid:4)ا 8(cid:9)اذ (cid:30)1 ث (cid:17)" fا (cid:7)(cid:30)(cid:9) (2) (cid:24)(cid:8)+,1و (cid:21)+,1 ;$5" نأ fا (cid:21)#3 (3) نK(cid:17)lار (cid:9)(cid:16)Mر 5(cid:5)ا (cid:9)(cid:21)ا (cid:9)P(cid:16)(cid:14) (cid:12)B(cid:10) (cid:9)(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:28)(cid:17)( نا (cid:9)(cid:16)Mر 5'1 It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this.
For we do return to Him (in repentance) EXERCISES 1.

6.4 CONCLUSION The Particles of at-tamanni has been explained in this unit.
They can be expressed for impossibility of realisation and for possibility without access to it.

It is also used for rhetorical purpose to mean calling from a long distance.
It is the fifth and last kind of Insha’ at-Talabi.
31 In this unit, the different particles of an-nida will be explained and its rhetorical meaning will be discussed.
7.2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to - Know the meaning of an-Nida and its particles - Understand the different metaphorical meaning of an-Nida 7.3 MAIN CONTENTS An-Nida' is the expression used by the speaker which serve the purpose of a verb (cid:29)3دا i.e.
I am calling.
Vocative particles are eight.
او ، (cid:2),ه ،(cid:2)"ا ،ىg ، g ، ىا ،ة@$2(cid:9)ا،(cid:2)" The particles of vocative are subdivided into two categories (1) Hamzah and Ay are both used to call one from a closer distance (11) the remaining six particle are used to c all one from a long distance.
For rhetorical purpose, however the particles meant originally for calling from a short distance may be used for calling from a long distance and vice versa.
For instance we use (cid:2)F" which is meant originally for calling from a long distance for Allah even though He is very close to us than our jugular vein in order to show our respect to Him.
fا (cid:2)" Oh Allah One poet said while composing poem of condolence for his dead child (cid:9)(cid:2)^1 (cid:23),(cid:9)و (cid:30)(cid:15)0 (cid:19) hّ 1أأ ,(cid:30)1 ن(cid:29)+$(cid:9)ا 4L0 (cid:28)(cid:4)و hّ S Oh Ubayyu, Don’t move far No human being can avert death the far people are the dead ones.
Here the poet called his dear son who is far away as if he were close just to show that he is constantly remembered, although he is out of sight, he is not out of mind.
32 Another example can be seen in a letter sent by Walid to his son (cid:21)i(cid:2)(cid:30)$(cid:9)ا ك(cid:26)0و M(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:13)T(cid:2)1 8,<3 h+1 يا O my son Be steadfast and refrain from disobedience (to Allah) The particle used here is يا for those close to one, but it has been used for the distant just to give the impression that he is constantly remembered.
Metaphorical Meaning of An-Nida An-Nida can be used metaphorically to denote another meaning which can be understood through the circumstantial evidence and good taste in literary appreciation as: (1) (cid:26)#ّ (cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:9)اSadness/Grief For example: Hafis Ibraheem (cid:2)ه (cid:9)او ج(cid:2)0 (cid:28)(cid:4) (cid:10)3@(cid:11) ةرد(cid:2)" نا(cid:29):ر ج(cid:2)0 (cid:21)(cid:22) M,<S (cid:10)(cid:17)(cid:15)i'(cid:22) Oh Gold that has been taken from the crown of her father and it became an ornament in the crown of Ridwan One poet said: cد(cid:29)(cid:31) (cid:10)"أرو N,آ (cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:4) (cid:26)(cid:15)!

Baghdad University Press UNIT EIGHT CONJUCTION OF SENTENCES (AL-WASL) 8.1 INTRODUCTION Al-wasl can be defined as joining of one sentence to another with a particle.
Before this could be done there must be relationship between the two sentences.
8.2 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit you should be able to 36 - Define al-wasl - State the relationship between the two sentences 8.3 MAIN CONTENTS Al-Wasl could be defined as joining of one sentence to another one with wā'.
Before this could be done, there must be relationship between the two sentences.
Al-Wasl between two sentence is necessary in the following three places: (1) When the two sentences share the same grammatical rule.
E.g.
أ(cid:26)(cid:3)"و 4(cid:18)(cid:8)" -,$<(cid:18)(cid:9)ا The student is writing and reading.
These are two sentences in the sense that one can say the student is writing and the student is reading but The wā' is used to join them together.
The word أ(cid:26)(cid:3)" is M(cid:22)(cid:29)((cid:30)(cid:4) on the word of khabearul-Mubtada.
(2) When the two sentences are both khabar and Insha and there is no any condition that can cause their separation For example: (cid:7)\(cid:2)(cid:15)(cid:9)ا Bهزو B(cid:17)(cid:9)ا ء(cid:2)(cid:31) Truth has come and false hood has vanished away (cid:24),(cid:17)(cid:31) (cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:9) ر(cid:2)5(cid:27)(cid:9)ا نإو (cid:24),(cid:30)(cid:11) (cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:9) را(cid:26)1`ا نإ Verily the goodness shall be in enjoyment (paradise) and verily the transgressors shall be in fire.
The above sentence are joined together with wā' and each of them is al-khabariyyah (cid:21)](cid:26)!او (cid:21)(cid:15)هذا Go and read In this example; the two sentences are joined together with wa’ because each of them is al-in sha'iyyah.
(3) When we wish to exercise control on misconception which might have arise when two sentences go in contrary being khabariyyah and Insha'yyah.
For example: 71 fا N((cid:9) (cid:19) 37 No, and Allah may have mercy upon him).
In this sentence if wā' is removed between (cid:19) in the second sentence, it will change the meaning completely and it will give another meaning which will mean someone is causing wrath on the sick person which will perceive as 71 fا N((cid:9) (cid:19) as may Allah give not mercy upon him.
Further example is: (c(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:13) (cid:28)(cid:4) ك (cid:9)او ;(cid:31)ر (cid:7)ه 8(cid:9)'(cid:13) (cid:28)(cid:4) 8(cid:9)-1 4,50 ) (cid:2)$(cid:9)ّ(cid:2)(cid:13) fا cدّرو ،(cid:19) No and Allah may let him arrive safely.
This is an answer to somebody who inquire whether your father has returned from his travel (7:(cid:26)(cid:4) (cid:28)(cid:4) ك(cid:29))اّ (cid:21)(cid:27)E (cid:7)ه ل(cid:2)!
(cid:28)(cid:4) 8(cid:9)-1 4,50) .fا c(cid:2)(cid:27)Eو ،(cid:19) No and may Allah give him recovery (from his sickness) This is an answer to somebody who inquire about the condition of his sick brother.
Al-fasl is defined as leaving out joining of two sentence will wā',.
For example: l(cid:31)(cid:2)0 (cid:10)(cid:11)ا N^0(cid:19) (i) Do not fear, you have passed.
One scholar says: 7L^E قّ د قر(cid:2)(cid:13) (cid:19)إ ت(cid:29)$(cid:9)ا (cid:2)(cid:4)و (cid:7)(cid:31)ر 91 (cid:21)(cid:30)#"و Nآ 91 ل(cid:29)L" "The death is but thief which his body is so tiny, it pounces without hand and walks without leg".
In this example 7 FL^E قّ د قر(cid:2)(cid:13) (cid:19)إ ت(cid:29)$(cid:9)ا (cid:2)(cid:4)و is a complete sentence while the second one is emphasizing or giving more explanation of the first one.
They have been regarded as a single sentence and thus, they are not joined together with wa'.

When is al-wasl necessary?
8.4 CONCLUSION In this Unit, the condition in which al-wasl is necessary was explained.
There must be relationship between two sentences the particle of wa’ is used to join one sentence to another.
8.5 SUMMARY Joining of conjunction is made by the use of particles wa.
Al-wasl is necessary when two sentences share the same grammatical rule.
It is of paramount when the two sentences are both Khabar and Insha’ and there is no any condition that cause their separation.
It is essential when we wish to exercise control on misconception which might have arise when two sentences go in contrary.

In this unit, the concept of al-fasl and the condition when it is necessary will be discussed.
9.2 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to - State the meaning of al-fasl - Understand the necessary cases when it can be used.
40 9.3 MAIN CONTENTS Al-fasl is necessary in the following places.
When there is complete relationship between the two sentences.
This is regarded in Arabic as ل(cid:2)$آ ل(cid:2)L0Tا This happens when the second sentence serves as: (a) Emphasis ا ,آ(cid:29)0 to the first one.
For example one poet says: (cid:26)Lّ (cid:3)(cid:4)و زّ (cid:26)ّ (cid:15)(cid:4) ء(cid:2)+A(cid:9)ّا ى(cid:29)2" ن(cid:2)#(cid:11)Tا M(cid:30),(cid:15)\ ء(cid:2)+A(cid:9)ا 4ّ S Industrious and lazy (person) loves praising, love of praising is a nature of people.
The second hemistich of the above person that are not joined together with wā' is an emphasized statement to the first one.
(b) Substitute ل (cid:15)(cid:9)ا to the first one For example: ،ن(cid:29)(cid:9)وّ `ا ل(cid:2)!
(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:7)A(cid:4) ا(cid:29)(cid:9)(cid:2)!
(cid:7)1 But they used to say what their old fathers said (cid:2)+(cid:18)(cid:4) ا-]أ ا(cid:29)(cid:9)(cid:2)!
They said: When will we die ن(cid:22)$(cid:23)و ت(cid:9)"Pو (cid:24)$"5و م(cid:9)+(cid:11)(cid:19)5 Oآ0ّ(cid:25)أ ن(cid:22)(cid:27)L+& (cid:9)(cid:27)5 Oآ0(cid:25)أ (C) explanation ن(cid:9)$(cid:3)(cid:5)ا to obliterate an ambiguity in the first sentence.
For example : %L(cid:3)#(cid:12) WL(cid:25)و 0L(cid:4)(cid:5)ا ة(cid:1)AV %L(cid:23) W(cid:5)ّدأ >ه .مدX(cid:9)# ل(cid:9)2 ن(cid:9);$(cid:10)(cid:5)ا (cid:26)$(cid:5)إ س(cid:22)(cid:18)(cid:22)(cid:28) Shaytan whisper to him (Adam) he said can I direct you to abide tree and unruined power.
41  Oآء(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)"5أ ن(cid:22)(cid:15)54(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)# با4(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)+(cid:5)ا ء(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:18) O@(cid:11)(cid:22)(cid:25)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:14)# ن(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:23)(cid:1)(cid:28) لاء (cid:24)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:25) Oآ(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)"$Aّ (cid:11) ذإو O$b(cid:23) O@5ّر (cid:24)(cid:25) ءU5 O@(cid:5)اذ %(cid:28)و Oآء(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:11) ن(cid:22)$(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:14)#و And remember, we delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard tasks and chastitement slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live, therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
(Q2: 49) In the above Quranic verses in the second sentence of the first one مدX(cid:9)(cid:2)# ل(cid:9)(cid:2)2 is meant to obliterate ambiguity what the devil whispered to Adam while the second sentence of the last one Oآء(cid:9)(cid:2)"5أ ن(cid:22)(cid:15)54(cid:2)# explain the nature of the punishment melted out by fir'aon on the male sons of Bani Isra'il.
One poet says : ة(cid:1)C(cid:9)8و و05 (cid:24)(cid:25) س(cid:9)"L(cid:5) س(cid:9)"(cid:5)ا م0Z او(cid:1)+(cid:10)# O(cid:5) نإو e+(cid:3)(cid:5) e+5 People is for people (being in) village or urban area, part is for help of other if even subjects do not know .
(2) When there is a complete separation between the two sentence ( ع(cid:9)(cid:2);6(cid:11)9ا ل(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:27)آ) It occurs when they differ in .
(a) being khabariyyah or insha’iyyah For example: (i)Yا (cid:26)(cid:27)L(cid:18) ن(cid:9)(cid:27)=(cid:23) (cid:1)(cid:28)(cid:9)(cid:18) (Uthman travelled May Allah save him ) (ii) f+(cid:16)& WL+(cid:5)،ن(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:25)(cid:12)ا %(cid:28) >(cid:27)!
(cid:27)(cid:5)ا g6(cid:18) The lazy one failed in the examination May be you may be admonished.
(iii) W$(cid:5)إ %T.أ (cid:9)(cid:11)أ OL@& (Talk, I am listening to you).
Example of the first sentence is khabariyyah while the second are Insha’iyyah.
Therefore they cannot be joined together with wa' because of this complete separation between them.
Also in the third sentence the first sentence is al-inshaiyyah while the second is khabariyyah 42 (b) Absence of relation between the two sentences.
For example >#(cid:22)c (cid:1)(cid:27)(cid:23) (cid:30)&(cid:9)آ 0#ز Zayd is a secretary and Umar is tall.
In this example it is clear that there is no connection between Zayd who is a secretary and Umar who is tall.
Therefore the two sentences should not be joined with wa' 3.
When there is quasi- complete connection (ل (cid:9)S&9ا ل(cid:9)(cid:27)آ (cid:26)(cid:3)V) between the two sentences.
This is when the second sentence, serves as an implied answer to an implied question.
For example: ء(cid:22)(cid:14)(cid:5)(cid:9)5 ةرّ (cid:9)(cid:25)D Q?
"(cid:5)ا نإ 1(cid:14)?
(cid:11) ئ(cid:1)5أ (cid:9)(cid:25)و In this example a question is implied from the first sentence (1(cid:14)?
(cid:11) ئ(cid:1)5أ (cid:9)(cid:25)) As if one asks Why don’t you clean yourself, then the second sentence ةر ّ (cid:2)F(cid:4)` (cid:23)(cid:27)+F(cid:9)ا نإ ء(cid:29)F#(cid:9)(cid:2)1) services as an answer to this implied question The second segment that serves as an answer is called (I?
(cid:11)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:14)(cid:25) Iّ L(cid:27)8) EXERCISES 1.

UNIT TEN AL-QASR (RESTRICTION) 10.1 INTRODUCTION Al-Qasr literally means restriction, confinement, restraint and immurement.
The rhetoricians define it restricting something to something else in a special way.
It can be formed by negation with exceptional particles and by using innama, Laa, Laakin and Bal 10.2 OBJECTIVES By the end of this Unit, you should be able to 44 - Define the meaning of al-Qasr - Understand the formation of al-Qasr 10.3 MAIN CONTENTS Al-Qasr literally means restriction or confinement.
The Holy Qur'an says : م(cid:2),^(cid:9)ا (cid:21)(cid:22) تار(cid:29)L(cid:3)(cid:4)ر(cid:29)S Maidens restrained ( as to their glances) in goodly pavilion) Q.
55: 72.
It is define among the rhetorician as ص(cid:29)L^(cid:4) B"(cid:26)(1 tY1 tE u,L^0 (Restricting something to something else in a especial way) نو 2(cid:18)5$(cid:9)ا (cid:19)إ l5(cid:11) (cid:2)(cid:4) No body passed except the industrious ones.
In this statement pass has been restricted to the industrious students.
FORMATON OF AL-QASR (cid:1)S6(cid:5)ا There are four ways of forming (1) Negation with exceptional particles (cid:21)<3 (cid:19)إ ز(cid:2)(cid:22) (cid:2)(cid:4) No one gain but Ali ل9ه (cid:19)إ ء(cid:26)$(cid:9)ا (cid:2)(cid:4) No human being but crescent M$\(cid:2)(cid:22) ا 3 (cid:10),(cid:15)(cid:9)ا (cid:21)(cid:22) (cid:23),(cid:9) No one in the house except Fatimah (cid:21)1أ (cid:19)إ (cid:10),(cid:15)(cid:9)ا (cid:21)(cid:22) (cid:2)(cid:4) No one is in the house but my father.
In this case whatever comes after it is 7,<3 ر(cid:29)L(cid:3)(cid:4) .
(2) AL- QASR BY USING (cid:9)(cid:27)(cid:11)إ .
For example: 45 4(cid:30)0 ة(cid:2),(cid:17)(cid:9)ا (cid:2)$(cid:11)إ Life is nothing but trouble In this case what ever come last in the sentence is 7,<3 ر(cid:29)L(cid:3)(cid:4) When al-Qasr is formed by using innamaa there will be no need the usage of particles such as illa, siwaa, khalaa, ghayra.
So it will be wrong to say for example 4(cid:9)(cid:2)\ (cid:19)ا "ز (cid:2)$(cid:11)ا (indeed Zaid is except a student) Al-Qasr is formed by the help of conjunction such as (cid:19) ،(cid:28)F(cid:8)(cid:9)or (cid:7)F1 in the case of conjunction with (cid:12) 7,<3 ر(cid:29)L(cid:3)$(cid:9)ا should be the opposite of what comes immediately after (cid:12) For example: M(cid:18)1(cid:2)a (cid:19) Mآ(cid:26)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:4) ضر`ا The earth is moving not stagnant.
But if al-qasr is with (cid:28)(cid:8)(cid:9) or (cid:7)1 al-maqsur alayh come last in the sentence.
,(cid:30)(cid:13) (cid:28)(cid:8)(cid:9) l(cid:9)(cid:2)i (cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:13) (cid:2)(cid:4) Salih did not travel but Sa 'id ئر(cid:2)!
(cid:7)1 40(cid:2)آ (cid:2)(cid:11)أ (cid:2)(cid:4) I am not a writer but in a reciter.
It is pertinent to mention that when (cid:28)F(cid:8)(cid:9) and (cid:7)F1 are used for the purpose of al- Qasr the sentence should begin with a particle of negation and the last clause should be in affirmative.
Al-qasr with (cid:19) must begins with affirmative sentence and the restricted thing that comes after should not be included in the general meaning of what come before it i.e the thing restricted to.
(4) Al- qasr by a way of mentioning first what is supposed to mention last.
For example: (cid:28),(cid:30)(cid:18)F#(cid:11) ك(cid:2)F"ّإو F(cid:15)(cid:30)(cid:11) ك(cid:2)F"ّإ (It is only You (Allah) that we worship and You (alone) we ask for help (Q1:5) Other examples include: %"=(cid:11) (cid:24)$L(cid:25)(cid:9)+(cid:5)ا ل(cid:9)P(cid:1)(cid:5)ا %L(cid:23) 46 We are praising the working people (cid:24),<3 tE (cid:7)ّ (cid:8)1 fاو And Allah is All knower of everything EXERCISES 1.

It is restricting something to another in a special method.
There are three things to be noted which includes something restricted (shay-un or amrun), something restricted to (shay-un) and special way or method Tariqun makhsuusun For example, when one says |(cid:5)(cid:9)} fا (cid:28)(ز (cid:9)(cid:14)(Zayd is not but a student) 48 The first shay-un (something) which is the al-maqsur(the thing restricted) is Zayd.
The second shay-un (something) which is (the thing restricted to) and which is Talib is referred to by Arab rhetoricians as maqsur-alayh The third thing is Tariq Makhsusun (the special way).
This is the method stipulated by the rhetoricians which must be followed when making al-Qasr which is negation (maa) and exceptional particle illa in the above example.
In this Unit the classification of al-Qasr will be discussed 11.2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to - Define al-Qasr - State the classification of al-Qasr with examples.
- Discuss various types of al-Qasr 11.3 MAIN CONTENTS Al- qasr can be classified into two (cid:21)(cid:3),(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:9)ا (cid:26)L(cid:3)(cid:9)ا and (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:2):Tا (cid:26)L(cid:3)(cid:9)ا (cid:21)F(cid:3),(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:9)ا (cid:26)FL(cid:3)(cid:9)ا authentic restriction is when the thing restricted to is totally possible and realistic because the restricted attribute is meant for that thing alone.
It cannot exceed it to another thing.
For example: fا قاز(cid:26)ّ (cid:9)ا (cid:2)$(cid:11)ّإ There is no provider but Allah.
Therefore the only Provider is Allah and provision is only restricted to Allah Alone so it is (cid:26)FL(cid:3)(cid:9)ا (cid:21)(cid:3),(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:9)ا Further examples: fا (cid:19)إ B(cid:17)1 د(cid:29)(cid:15)(cid:30)(cid:4) (cid:19) None is worth to worship but Allah fا (cid:19)إ 7(cid:9)إ (cid:19) There is no deity but Allah (cid:26)F$3 (cid:19)إ MF+" $(cid:9)ا (cid:21)F(cid:22) 40(cid:2)آ (cid:19) There is no writer in the town except Umar i.e.
When there is no writer in the town except him (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:2)F:Tا (cid:26)FL(cid:3)(cid:9)ا is when it is assumed that the attribute is meant only for the person concerned.
49 In reality, it is possible for another person to share the attribute with him.
Also when we consider only one of the attribute of the person where as the person possess other qualities.
For example: ئر(cid:2)!
(cid:19)إ (cid:2)(cid:11)أ (cid:2)(cid:4) ( I am not but a reader) This does not mean I don’t proposes other qualities apart from reading so this is (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:2):Tا (cid:26)L(cid:3)(cid:9)ا Qur'an say:ء(cid:2)$<(cid:30)(cid:9)ا cد(cid:2)(cid:15)3 (cid:28)(cid:4) fا (cid:21)Y^" (cid:2)$(cid:11)إ only those who fear Allah from among His servant are those who have knowledge.
Q.35:-28 furthermore by reconsidering the person to whom the speech is directed to, qasr idafi is also divided into three.
These are: (i) دا(cid:26)(cid:22)Tا(cid:26)L!
- Mآ(cid:26)Y(cid:9)ا (cid:3)(cid:18)3ا (cid:28)$(cid:9) دا(cid:26)(cid:22)Tا(cid:26)L!
This is when the speech is directed to one who thinks 7,<3 ر(cid:29)L(cid:3)$(cid:9)ا possesses two attributes.
For instance, we say: 4\(cid:2)) (cid:19)إ "ز (cid:2)(cid:4) Zayd is nothing but orator to some one who thinks that Zayd combines the quality of oratory with that of writing (ii)4<(cid:3)(cid:9)ا(cid:26)L(cid:22) - (cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:30)(cid:9)ا (cid:3)(cid:18)3ا (cid:28)$(cid:9) 4<(cid:3)(cid:9)ا(cid:26)L!
This is when the speech is directed to one who thinks the opposite of that quality is 7F,<3 ر(cid:29)L(cid:3)$(cid:9)ا possesses.
For example: (cid:24)F<(cid:30)$(cid:9)ا (cid:19)ا (cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:2)F(cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:4) No one travelled but the teacher).
This is said to some one who thinks that the teacher did not travel himself, he only sent one to represent him.
(iii) (cid:28),,(cid:30)(cid:18)(cid:9)ا(cid:26)L!
- ا Sاو (cid:3)(cid:18)3ا (cid:28)$(cid:9) (cid:28),(cid:30)(cid:4)(cid:26),6 (cid:26)L!
This is when one is not sure of which of the qualities that 7 F,<3 ر(cid:29)L(cid:3)$(cid:9)ا possesses.
For instance we say نا(cid:26)F(cid:3)(cid:9)ا (cid:19)إ ن(cid:2)$,<(cid:13) أ(cid:26)!
(cid:2)(cid:4) (Sulayman did not read but the Qur'an) to someone who is not sure of what book Sulayman has read whether is the Qur'an or any other book.

One is achieved by the means of the use of very few words to convey very long ideas.
The other one is where a part of the narration can be deliberately omitted.
12.2 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to 52 - State the meaning of al-Ijaz - Understand the different kinds of al-Ijaz 12.3 MAIN CONTENTS Al-ijaz is the usage of brevity in the construction of sentences to convey one's ideas with the, use of the barest minimum number of words.
For example: ن(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:18)ّ0 (cid:24)(cid:8)<ّ(cid:30)(cid:9) ب(cid:2)(cid:15)(cid:9)`ا (cid:21)(cid:9)و'" ة(cid:2),S ص(cid:2)L(cid:3)(cid:9)ا (cid:21)(cid:22) (cid:24)(cid:8)(cid:9)و "In retaliation there is life for you.
O ye men of understanding that you may restrain yourselves.
This is so because it will serve as a deterent for others to commit murder.
Thus, such a sentence will need many words to explain its meaning which is that if a murderer is killed in retaliation for murder, this would spare the life of other who could have fallen as victim of this murder.
In nutshell, if a person known that if he kill some one, he would be killed, this will make him to refrain from killing others and there by he had been able to protect his life and the life of others.
Allah says: An to him belongs the creation and the matter (Q7 54).
The word B<^(cid:9)ا include all the creatures of Allah.
There is also ز(cid:2)5"Tا in the word (cid:26)(cid:4)`ا (affairs).
KIND OF ز(cid:9)A#9ا There are two kind of al-Ijaz, (cid:26)FL!ز(cid:2)5"إ The brevity of this type is achieved by means of the use of very few words to convey a very long ideas, many wise sayings and proverbs fall into this category.
For example: 4آ(cid:26)(cid:9)ا (cid:26),(cid:4)أ N,(cid:30)V(cid:9)ا (The weak one is the leader of the caravan) ف-Sز(cid:2)5"إ This is the one in which a part of the narration is deliberately omitted in order to achieve brevity.

At this juncture, the wording will excel the meaning for useful purpose.
It is used by mentioning specific after generality.
Generality can also be mentioned after specific.
The same word can also be repeated.
It is also used for expatiating a point after being ambigious.

It is a commendable feature of Arabic rhetorics when it is used in its appropriate place.
It may be to emphasize or explain the meaning or to obliterate the ambiguity.
