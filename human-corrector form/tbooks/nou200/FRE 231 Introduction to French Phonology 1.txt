INTRODUCTION This unit will introduce you to phonology in general, and to French phonology in particular.
You will be given the definition of phonology and learn the difference between phonetics and phonology.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Define the system of sounds of any language, particularly of French sounds; • Determine how these sounds function in the system of communication.
• Identify the various phonological theories.
• Distinguish between phonetics and phonology.
3.0.
QU’EST-CE QUE LA PHONOLOGIE?
Here, you will learn the definition of phonology and all about it.
3.1.
DEFINITION In order to understand how phonetic transcription works, it is necessary to understand the basic principles of phonology.
Phonologie is the description of the systems and patterns of sounds that occur in a language.
It involves studying a language to determine its distinctive sounds and to establish a set of rules that describe the set of changes that take place in these sounds when they occur in different relationships with other sounds.
12 Many experts have worked on phonology.
It is importqnt for you to know these experts; they have been categorized to their schools of thought.
3.2.
MAJOR EXAMPLES OF SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN PHONOLOGY.
There are two major schools of thought as described below: 3.2.1.
THE FUNCTIONALISTS These experts believe that phonology is part of phonetics.
In other words, phonetics and phonology are like two sides of the same coin.
The following are names of some functionalists: André Martinet, Gabriel Manessy, Mautrice Houis, etc.
3.2.2.
THE GENERATIVISTS For these experts, phonetics and phonology are distinct areas of study; here, phonology is defined as the system of sounds contrasts in a particular language.
Among the generativist, you have Noam Chomsky, Morris Halle, Paul Kiparsky, etc.
4.0.
PHONOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF SOUNDS Note that every language has its own distinctive sounds.
Also note that the smallest segments of sounds that can be distinguished by their contrast within words can be grouped together into phonemes.
Phonemes are the abstract units that form the basis for writing down a language systematically and unambiguously.
Taking French as an example, you have the following categories of phonemes: consonant phonemes and vowel phonemes (see details in unit 4 and 5).
5.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about the essentials of phonology, giving examples of French language to illustrate the theory.
You should note that every language has its own peculiar phonological specifics.
You must not generalize.
6.0.
SUMMARY This unit has equipped you with the basic knowledge in phonology; especially you are now aware of the concept of phonology and of how it works when you consider a particular language.
13 This unit will help you understand with ease the system of French sounds.
This implies that this unit will be useful for the full understand of the whole course.

INTRODUCTION In unit 1 of this course, you have learnt what phonology is all about.
So also in the course FRE 201, you have learnt what phonetics is all about.
This unit of FRE 305 is a way to bring both phonetics and phonology together with the view to making you realize and understand that it’s all about the study of sounds (physically and functionally) of any given language.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Make a clear distinction between phonetics and phonology • Be armed for the phonetic and phonological descriptions of sounds of a language, especially French language, with more emphasis on the phonological aspects.
3.0.
PHONETIQUE ET PHONLOGIE As a reminder (the distinction between phonetics and phonology has been taught in previous unit – unit 1), you should retain that both deal with the study of speech sounds; while phonetics deals with the physical nature as well as the description of sounds produced, phonology treats the function of sounds in speech.
You can study the phonetic characteristics of a language you do not understand or speak.
But it is impossible for you to study the phonological aspects of a language if you do not speak nor understand that language.
In other words, phonology is concerned with the differences in pronunciation that correspond to differences in meaning: that is what 15 is called distinctive oppositions.
Consider the following examples for better understanding of the concept: Rouge [Ruз] (red) When you replace the first consonant type with [b], you then have two different words bouge [buz] (for move) and rough [Ruз] (for red) that constitute what is called paire minimale: two words that differ in meaning with only one sound making the difference between them.
When you replace a sound with another one in a paire minimale, you do what is called commutation.
In phonetics, you talk of sound you can hear, produce and measure.
In phonology, you talk of phoneme, which is an abstract entity as opposed to other phonemes in the language.
4.0.
RÉPRESENTATION DES SONS ET PHONÈMES In transcription, as you were taught in phonetics, sounds and phonemes are represented differently.
4.1.
REPRESENTATION DES SONS Sounds are transcribed the way they are produced or articulated and always put in what is known as crochets phonétiques: [ ].
For example, you consider the following words: une fille (a girl); garçon (a boy); livre (a textbook).
These words are transcribed phonetically as follows [(cid:830)nfij], [gαRs(cid:474)] and [ livR] respectively.
4.2.
REPRESENTATION DES PHONÈMES Phonemes are transcribed the same way like sounds and are put not in crochets phonétiques but rather in what is called barres obliques / /.
For example, when you consider the same words as in 4.1 above, you have the following phonological transcriptions: /(cid:830)nfij/, /gαRs(cid:474)/ and [ livR] respectively.
Also, the symbol ~ is used to oppose two phonemes or two paires minimales.
For example, in [Ru(cid:536)] and / buz/ which constitute a paire minimale, the phonemes /R/ and /b/ are opposed to one another; this opposition is represented as follows: /R/ ~ /b/.
5.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt how to make the difference between phonetics and phonology, with necessary technical terms, using French language as example.
16 6.0.
SUMMARY This unit has made you understand clearly the difference between phonetics and phonology as well as the respective symbolic representations in concrete terms.
With this, you will encounter no difficulty in understanding the subsequent units of this course.

INTRODUCTION In this unit, you will learn the possibility of merging phonology and morphology in the description of various phonemes of words, particularly in speech.
For better understanding, you need to know the definition of both words.
You learnt what phonology is all about in the previous unit, revisit it.
As for morphonology, it is defined as the study of word formation in a sentence, with the smallest significant entity called morphème.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Describe the different morphemes of a word, using phonological • Link sounds with meanings in a particular language.
3.0.
LA MORPHOLOGIE OU MORPHONOLOGIE It is the study of the phonological structure of morphemes.
3.1.
MORPHEME As defined earlier, a morpheme is the smallest meaningful element of a word or of a speech.
For example, consider this sentence in French: “Les boxeurs souffrent”.
In this example, the morphemes are as follows: Le + s + box + eur + s + souffr + ent (you have a total of 7 morphemes).
Each of these morphemes has a meaning, in the sense 18 that it plays a vital role in the understanding of the whole sentence.
There are two categories of morphemes: (i) The lexical morphemes, also called radicaux, e.g.
box and souffr.
(ii) The grammatical morphemes, also called affixes (prefixe ou suffixe); e.g.
le, s, eur, s, and ent.
3.2.
REPRSENTATION DES MORPHEMES In morphological representation, both categories of morphemes – lexical and grammatical, are combined to give a word its full meaning.
For instance, consider the following examples:- - les étudiants travaillent beaucoup.
The underlined words can morphonologically be analysed as follows, sorting out the different morphemes.
(i) etudiants: - etud is the lexical morpheme (LM) or le radical nominal.
- i is the first grammatical morpheme called morpheme suffixal verbal, as it is added to the LM to form the verb étudier.
- ant is the second grammatical morpheme called morpheme suffixal nominal, as it is added to the morphème verbal to obtain étudiant.
- s is the last grammatical morpheme called morpheme suffixal du nombre pluriel.
(ii) travaillent - travail: lexical morpheme, le radical nomical - i: first grammatical morpheme called morpheme suffixal verbal, as it is added to the LM to form the verb travailler.
- ent: second grammatical morpheme called morpheme suffical verbal de terminaison, as it represents the normal ending of the verb conjugated at the 3rd person plural of present tense.
3.3.
RÉPRESENTATION DU MORPHONOPHONÈME OU MORPHONEME From the definition of phoneme in unit 2 and of morpheme in unit 3 you can deduce that a morpheme is constituted of phonemes.
Examples: when you consider the lexical morphemes etud which is derived from etude, you have the following phonemes: /é/ + /t/ + /u/ + /d/, making 4 phonemes for the morpheme étud.
4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt how phonology and morphonology are related, and how both constitute what is known as morphonology.
You also learnt some technical terms like morpheme and morpheneme.
19 5.0.
SUMMARY This unit has enabled you get acquainted with the relationship between phonology and another aspect of linguistics which is morphonology, with the smallest meaningful unit called morpheme.
Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3 constitute altogether the first three aspects of French linguistics.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION In phonology, there is a systematic relationship between some sounds.
Sounds appear in different contexts or environments they have what is called distribution.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Work out the distribution of words in a particular environment as well as the evolving paire minimale.
3.0.
PHONEMES ET DISTRIBUTION DES SEGMENTS The different contexts in which sounds or segments appear (in a word or in a syllable, the nature of its phonetic environment) altogether form what is called distribution.
The best way to know whether two sounds that are similar differ phonetically or phonologically is to use the techniques of paire minimale.
3.1.
PAIRE MINIMALE A pair is a group of two forms that have different meanings and differ by only one segment in the same position in the word.
31 Examples: a.
[ose] hausser differs from [ oze] oser b.
[diR ] dire differs from [IiR ] lire c. [fε:t] fête differs from [tε:t] tete d. [tabl] table differs from [ kabl] cable In those examples, [ose] and [oze], [diR] and [IiR], [f :t] and [t: t], [tabl] and [kabl] form respectively une paire minimale.
In [ose] and [oze ], /s/ and /z/ are distinct phonemes, since both forms have different meanings altogether.
Note that the same goes for the other paires minimales: /d/ and /1/, /f/ and /t/, /t/ and /k/ are distinct phonemes.
3.2.
REPRESENTATIONS DES PAIRES MINIMALES You should note that paires minimales are established based on phonetic transcription and not on orthographic transcriptions.
For instance, in the examples above, [oze] is written oser, [kabl ] is written cable, whereby letters s and c become respectively phonemes /z/ and /k/.
In other words, you must always do the phonetic transcription of two words in order to know whether or not the said words can form a paire minimale.
4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt what is called segmental distribution in phonology, with examples in French.
You have also learnt what is called paire minimale and how it is represented.
5.0.
SUMMARY This unit has taught you to know and note that the context in which sounds are used are very important, in the sense that they determine whether or not two particular sounds are distinct phonemes.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this unit, you will learn the function of a phoneme in communication: the distinctive function according to which an abstract unit known as phoneme corresponds to various representations depending on the context.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Know the various representations of different phonemes placed in particular contexts (that is what is called segmental distribution).
3.0.
PHONEMIC REPRESENTATIONS Here, you should note that there are three types of phonemic representation called variantes: les allophones; les variants libres and les variantes conditionnées.
3.1.
LES ALLOPHONES Allophones are various phonetic representations of a phoneme.
In other words, a phoneme is articulated differently depending on its environment.
For example, in French, /R/ is pronounced 3 different ways: [R ], [ r ] or [ (cid:519)]depending on its position amidst of other sounds in a word.
[ R ], [ r ] and [ (cid:519) ] will be called allophones of the same phoneme, hence you have: 34 / R / [ R ] [ r ] [ (cid:519) ] 3.2.
LES VARIANTES LIBRES Variantes libres are interchangeable allophones that are said to be in free variation.
For example, the consonant [R] in Paris can be pronounced either as a dental [ r ] or as a uvular [ R ] : both seem apply without any rule.
[ R ] and [ r ] will therefore be said to be variants libres of the phoneme /R/.
/ R / [ r ] [ (cid:519) ] 3.3.
LES VARIANTES CONDITIONNEES Variantes conditionnées are allophones that are not in free variation; their distribution is regulated: some appear in a given phonetic context and the other in another entirely different phonetic environment.
Such allophones will be said to be in distribution complementaire.
For example, phoneme /s/ is pronounced [ z] when it is between 2 vowels, and it is pronounced s in the other contexts.
This is represented as follows: /S / Phoneme [ Z ] [ s ] Allophones eu distribution complementaire 35 4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt the various phonemic representations in French phonology, and how each representation works in the French sound system.
You have also learnt how each representation is called in technical terms.
5.0.
SUMMARY With this unit, you become familiar with the technical terms used for phonemic representations in the French language.
You are to use those technical terms as appropriate whenever you find them, and you should be able to apply them where and whenever necessary.

2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Describe a phoneme by its appropriate characteristics known as features.
• Identify a sound, giving its phonological features, and make a difference between features of the two categories of sounds in French- consonant and vowels.
3.0.
PHONOLOGICAL FEATURES Phonemes are described according to their features.
3.1.
DEFINITIONS 3.1.1 What is a feature?
A feature is a minimal phonetic unit contained in a matrix that defines a segment.
If a segment has a feature, it is marked (+) and if it does not have the feature, it is marked (-).
37 3.1.2 DISTINCTIVE FEATURE A distinctive feature helps to identify minimal pairs.
For examples in French, you have the following as distinctive features: - Voiced as opposed to Voiceless - Oral as opposed to Nasal - The different places of articulation of sounds, etc.
3.1.3 SEGMENTAL MATRIX A matrix is the putting together of all the features that characterize a given segment.
Taking phonemes /u/ and /m/ as examples, you have the following as their respective matrix: /u/ /m/ - Consonant + consonant + vocalique - vocalique + haut + labial + arrondi + voisé - bas - nasal Fig.
1: representation of matrix of /u/ and /m/ 3.2.
PHONOLOGICAL FEATURES OF CONSONANTS French consonants have each a matrix of features that characterize them.
All the features are put together in a table as shown below: p t K g f s ∫ v z [Syllabique] - - - - - - - - - - [consonant] + + + + + + + + + + [anterieur] + + - - + + - + + - [posterieur] - - + + - - - - - - [arrondi] - - - - + + + + + - [nasal] - - - - - - - - - - [continu] - - - - + + + + + + 38 3.3.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION This unit will introduce you to the distinctive features of sounds in the French language sounds system.
You will learn the various features as they apply to different categories of sounds in the language.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Known what distinctive feature is all about • Identify the various distinctive features, compare and classify different phonemes according to their features.
3.0.
LEST TRAITS DISTINCTIFS 3.1.
DEFINITION In unit 8, you learnt the role of a distinctive feature in a given language.
As a definition, you can say that distinctive features are those features that distinguish phonemes between themselves.
In other words, distinctive features oppose a particular phoneme to the other phonemes in the language.
Also note that the number of distinctive features is less than the number of phonemes in a language.
41 3.2.
THE VARIOUS DISTINCTIVE FEATURES IN FRENCH Here, you will learn the various distinctive features existing in the French language.
Among those features, you have: - le voisement (voisé versus non voisé) - la nasalité (oral versus nasal) - l’antériorité (antérieur vesus postérieur) - l’arrondissement (arrondi versus non arrondi) - les différents leux d’articulation.
3.2.1 LE VOISEMENT This is a distinctive feature opposing a voiced phoneme to a voiceless phoneme.
Examples: Phonemes /b/, /d/, /g/ are voiced (voisé), while phonemes /p/, /t/, /k/ are voiceless (non voisé).
The 2 categories of phonemes are opposed by the feature of voice ‘voisement’.
3.2.2 LA NASALITÉ This is a feature opposing oral phonemes to nasal phonemes.
Examples: Phonemes /i/, /a/, /o/ are oral, while phonemes /I/, // /õ/ are nasal.
The distinctive feature of nasalité opposes both categories.
3.2.3 L’ANTÉRIORITÉ The feature opposes front (anterieur) phonemes to back (postérieur) phonemes.
Examples: Phonemes / i/, /e/, /ε / are front vowel phonemes, while /u/, /o/, /(cid:474)/ are back vowel phonemes.
The distinctive feature antériorité opposes both categories.
3.2.4 L’ARRONDISSEMENT This feature oppose round (arrondi) phonemes to non-round (non arrondi) ones.
Examples: Phonemes /i /, /e/, /ε / are non-round vowel phonemes, while /(cid:830)/, /(cid:827)/, /œ/ are round vowel phonemes.
The distinctive features or roundness is used to oppose the 2 categories of phonemes.
42 3.2.5 LES LIEUX D’ARTICULATION You should also learn that the different places of articulation are used as distinctive features.
For instance, labial phonemes are opposed to velar phonemes in French as in English.
Examples: Phonemes / p/, /b/, /m/ are labial phonemes, while phonemes /k/, /g/,/w/ are velar phonemes.
The first category of sounds (labial) are characterized by the feature [+ labial].
The distinctive feature [labial] is used to oppose the 2 categories.
4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt the different distinctive features of phonemes in French Examples are given to illustrate each of the features commonly used in the phonological description of sounds in the French language.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION In phonology, there are laid-down rules guiding the proper functioning of French sounds in speech.
This unit will acquaint you with the main phonological rules in the French language.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Identify the types of phonological rules that exist in the French language sound system.
• Apply those rules when and where necessary.
3.0.
LES RÈGLES PHONOLOGIQUES You have various types of phonological rules in the French sound system.
Those rules are in 2 categories: (i) Les règles dérivationnelles (ii) Les règles transformationnnelles 3.1.
LES RÈGLES DÉRIVATIONNELLES There are 3 main derivational rules in French.
Below is the description of each of them: 44 3.1.1.
REGLE D’EPENTHESE This rule consists in inserting a segment in a given context, and it is represented as follows: Øﬁ ﬁﬁﬁ B/C - D (this simply means that a segment B is inserted between C and D).
Examples: - Comment va-elle?
In this example, it is not phonologically right to leave the a of va and the e of elle as they are, because they constitute what is called hiatus.
A hiatus is a gap between 2 vowels which needs to be filled.
A consonant type is usually used to fill the said gap.
That consonant is termed consonne épenthétique.
In the example above, t is the right consonne epenthetique to use; so it becomes: comment va-t-elle?.
Other examples: (a) a-il mangé becomes a-t-il mange?
(b) mange-il bien?
becomes mange-t-il bien?
3.1.2.
RÈGLE D’ÉLISION This rule consists in canceling a segment in between two other segments.
It is represented as follows: A ﬁ ﬁﬁﬁ Ø / C – D (A is the segment cancelled between C and D) Example: Département is pronounced with the second e cancelled; thus you have depart-ment.
Also, the (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) at the end of some words are usually cancelled, as in the examples below:- Table/ tabl(cid:415)/………….t-a-b-l Vide / vid(cid:415)/ ……………v-i-d Livre/livR(cid:415)/……………l-i-v-R 3.1.3.
REGLE D’ASSIMILATION This rule describes a phonetic change undergone by a segment under the influence of another segment.
You should note that assimilation can occur backward as well as forward, as shown in the examples below.
When assimilation occurs backward, you talk of assimilation regressive; when it occurs forward, you talk of assimilation progressive.
Examples: (a) Assimilation regressive (occurs backward) 45 Absorber is pronounced a-p-s-(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)-R-b-e.
In this example, /b/ is a voiced stop which became voiceless /p/ under the influence of the voiceless sound /s/ that follows it.
Other examples are: / (cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)- p-s-ε-R-v-e/ for observer /m-e-t-s-i-n/ for medicine.
(b) Assimilation progressive (occurs forward) Il n’a pas is pronounced il-n-ãããã-pa (the a of n’a has been influenced by the nasal consonant n, and so, changed from an oral vowel to a nasal one.
3.2.
LES RÈGLES TRANSFORMATIONNELLES There are two main transformational rules in French.
3.2.1 LA RÈGLE DE LIAISON This rule consists in moving the final consonant of a word to the beginning of the following word.
It is represented as follows: C##V ﬁ ##CV Examples: Les enfants > l-e-z-ã-f-ã Bon ami > b- (cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474) - n-a-m-i Mon ami > m-(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474) - n-a-m-i 3.2.2 LA RÈGLE DE NASALISATION This rule consists in nasalizing an oral vowel which placed before a nasal consonant.
It is represented as follows: V ﬁ ﬁﬁﬁ {+nasal} / - C {+ nasal } # Examples: Mon ami /m(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)n ## ami/ m- (cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474) -n-a-m-i 4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt the main phonological rules that are commonly used in the French sound system.
Take note and put them to practice where necessary.
5.0.
SUMMARY With this unit, you now know what a phonological rule is, and how it is used in context.
You have also learnt the various types of rules and their respective applications in the French language system.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this unit, you will learn how sounds/phonemes interact and function in the French language system.
You will also learn the interaction between sounds provoke some phonological reactions in speech such as élision, enchaînement and liaison.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Understand the phonological reaction of sounds in the French language system.
• Apply the resulting phonological phenomena whenever you speak French.
3.0.
REACTIONS PHONOLOGIQUES In speech, there are series of sounds produced, and some phonological reactions take place in the course of their production.
Here, you will study only the commonest reactions, which are: élision, enchaînement; and liaison.
3.1.
L’ÉLISION You have already learnt in unit 10, the phonological rules, among which is l’elision.
Emphasis was laid on the élision of e muet, that is ((cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)).
Some examples: Le livre: i-(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)-I-i-v-R-(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) ………….
I- (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) -I –i v- R 48 Le un et le autre > l’un et l’autre: I-(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)-œ-e-I-(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)-o-t-R-(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) ……… I-œ-e-I-o-t-R In these examples, the final (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) in livre has undergone élision, just like the (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) of le and the (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) of autre.
In this unit, you will learn more cases of élision that are systematic.
Examples: - élision of final letters of words: enfant ( ă f ă ) (where le t has undergone élision) Les étudiante (lezet djă) (where s and ts are not pronounced, having undergone élision).
- élision of identical sounds si ils (si il) ﬁ /s-i-l/ (where the i of si has undergone élision) la alliance (laalijăs ) ﬁ /I-a-I-j-ă-s/ (where the a of la has undergone élision).
You should note that all these examples are not similar.
Each case is peculiar.
You should therefore not generalize; rather, you learn the peculiarities in each case.
3.2.
L’ENCHAINEMENT This consists in changing the frontier between syllables.
This change occurs when 2 words follow each other, with the first word ending with a consonant type, and the second word beginning with a vowel.
Example: Une petite amie ………… /yn-p(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415) -ti-ta-mi/ 3.3.
LA LIAISON In the case of enchainement, there is movement of syllabic frontier, but the total number of phonemes does not change.
On the contrary, in the case of liaison, there is a number of adjustments that change the number of phonemes, depending on the context.
For example: 1.
Ils ont /ilz(cid:474)/ 2.
Trois heures /tRwazœR/ 3. ont-ils / (cid:474)til/ 4.
Sept heures trios /sεtœRtRwa/ 49 (a) In the examples (1) and (2), there is consonant z between the two words: it is the s at the end of ils that changes to z to allow for liaison with the vowel o beginning the word ont.
This type of liaison is termed liaison obligatoire, because it is the case of a pronoun ils depending on the verb ont.
In the examples (3) and (4), you have the case of liaison obligatoire, ont and sept depending on ils and heures respectively.
(b) There are cases where liaison is not possible at all, because the words in contact do not depend on each other.
Examples: Jean attend /(cid:536)(cid:2903)at(cid:2903)/ Un soldat armé /œs(cid:474)1daaRme/ In the two examples, Jean and soldat do not depend respectively on attend and arme.
(c) Also not that there are cases where you may or may not apply the liaison, depending on the competence of the speaker.
Example: Je suis allé may be pronounced /(cid:536)(cid:415)syizale/ or /(cid:536)(cid:415)syiale/ (in the first instance, there is liaison, while in the second there is no liaison).
More details and examples will be given in the next unit.
4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt that some phonological reactions are inherent whenever speech is produced; the main reactions are elision, enchainement, and liaison.
You have also learnt that there are three different types of liaison: compulsory, impossible and optional.
5.0.
SUMMARY With this unit, you have learnt some more technical terms in French phonology, especially terms relating to the way sounds interact in the course of speech production.
It is also a way for you to learn how to be fluent or proficient in French language.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the previous unit (unit 11), you learnt what liaison is about.
In this unit (unit 12), you will learn the rules and principles guiding the application of liaison.
In effect, there are many principles and rules for an acceptable pronunciation in French.
The principles of liaison are part of these rules and principles.
And each type of liaison has its particular rule and principle, be it compulsory (obligatoire), optional (facultative) or forbidden (impossible).
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to: • Acquaint yourself with liaison as it is correctly used in French.
• State the two main causes of liaison.
• Identify compulsory, forbidden and optional liaisons.
3.0.
WHAT IS LIAISON?
Liaison can be defined as the linking of the final and usually silent consonant of a word with the beginning vowel sound of the following word.
It is an oral principle in French whereby two words are pronounced as if they are one.
For liaison to take place, however, the first word must end with an unpronounced consonant, while the second word begins with a vowel sound.
For instance, study the illustration below: Nous aimons nos amis.
In this sentence, there will be a liaison between the first two words – nous aimons, the first word ending with an unpronounced consonant s and the 52 second word beginning with a vowel sound ε.
Between the second word aimons and the third word nos, there cannot be any liaison because the former ends with an unpronounced consonant s and the latter begins too with a consonant n and not with a vowel sound.
But between nos and amis, another liaison will take place; this is made possible because nos ends with an unpronounced consonant s and amis begins with a vowel sound a.
To pronounce this sentence correctly therefore, you will have n-u-z--m- (cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)- n-o- z-a-m-i (whereby s will be produced as z as a result of the liaison).
3.1.
LIAISON OBLIGATOIRE Compulsory liaison (liaison obligatoire) means that a liaison must take place between two words, provided they satisfy the criteria already discussed above.
Remember that the two criteria are that: 1. there must be two words and they come one after the other in a sentence.
2. the first word ends with an unpronounced consonant while the second word begin with a vowel sound.
Liaison is compulsory in the cases enumerated below: 1.
Between an article and a noun.
e.g les-amis, les-étudiants, de-hommes un-an 2.
Between an article and an adjective e.g les –anciens combatants, 3.
Between an adjective and a noun e.g mon-ami, grand-homme, bon-amis, petit-enfant 4.
Between a pronoun and a verb e.g nous-avons, ils-ont, vous-êtes, nous les-avons 5.
Between a verb and a noun or an adjective e.g il est-avocat, nous sommes-impatients 6.
After the auxiliary verb être e.g il est-allé, elles sont-arrivés, il était-allé, il est-ici, je suis-ici.
7.
After a monosyllabic preposition, adverb or conjuction e.g.
chez-eux, en-Amérique très_intéressant, quand-elle parle 8.
In certain expressions of compound words.
Accent –aigu, pas-encore, avan-hier, petit-a petit, tout-à coup, tout-à fait, tout-à l’heure, vis-à-vis, de plus-en plus, de moins-en moins, de temps-en temps de mieux-en mieux etc.
53 3.2.
LIAISON IMPOSSIBLE There are situations where liaison is forbidden (impossible), even when the two major criteria earlier discussed are met.
In the three cases below, there is no liaison: 1.
After a singular noun.
e.g.
Le pied # ou la jambe 2. with the conjuctions “et” and “ou” e.g.
femmes et # homes, lui et # elle, du pain # ou un croissant.
3.
Before a verb coming after an inversion e.g.
Vont-ils # arriver?
4.
After an interrogative adverb e.g.
quand # est-il arrivé?
Combine # en as-tu?
5.
After a proper noun e.g.
Jean # est là, Jacques # a dormi.
6.
Between a singular noun and adjective coming after the noun.
e.g.
un étudiant # américain, une femme # élégante 7.
In certain fixed expressions e.g.
nez # à nez, mort # ou vif, riz # au lait.
8. la # haine, le # heros, le # hazard, la #honte, le # haut, le #hariot, la # Hollande.
Note that “h” can be silent and therefore behave as a vowel.
It can also be aspirated and behave as a consonant.
This is why there cannot be liaison between for example la honte because the “h” in honte is aspirated.
Meanwhile, the “h” in words like heure and homme are silent and so, there is compulsory liaison between the two words les and hommes, les ending with s, and hommes beginning with silent h. 3.3.
LIAISON FACULTATIVE In the case of optional liaison (liaison facultative), you are at liberty to either use liaison or not.
The following situations bring about optional liaison: 1.
Between plural nouns and adjectives.
e.g.
des romans # - italiens, des appartements #- élégants, des femmes #- élégantes.
2.
Between auxiliary or modal and their principal verbs.
e.g.
il doit # apprendre, je suis # arrivé 54 3.
After adverbs e.g.
vraiment # - inutile, considérablement # - accepté 4.
After conjuctions (note that liaison is forbidden after the conjuction “et” e.g.
mais # - enfin, 5.
Chez # Anne, sans # Henri Note the use of the symbols: means there must be a liaison; the symbol # means that liaison is forbidden, and # - means you may or not apply liaison.
4.0.
CONCLUSION Liaison constitutes a source of wrong pronunciation in French language by many.
Nevertheless, if you devote time to learning liaison, you will end up having a solid background in the pronunciation of French.
To concretize what you have learnt, you are advised to do some practices of liaison, using the internet.
I recommend to you two websites: http://www.languageguide.org/français/grammar/pronunciation/ and http//www.courseweb.edteched.uottawa.ca/phonetique/pages/phonetique/intro.htm.
When you get to each of these sites, click on liaison, and you will have the opportunity of listening to the pronunciation of some examples of liaison.
5.0.
SUMMARY Through this unit, you have learnt the principles and rules of liaison.
As a reminder, you have learnt that before a liaison can take place, there must be two words coming one after the other and that the first word should end with a consonant while the second word should begin with a vowel sound.
In the same vain, you have learnt the three different situations in liaison: compulsory, forbidden or optional.
You are strongly advised not to go into the next unit until you have thoroughly understood the principle of liaison.
Note that there is no pronunciation in French without obeying the rules of liaison.

INTRODUCTION In unit 11, you learnt that elision, liaison and enchainement are normal phonological reactions in speech in French.
And in unit 12, you learnt the principles guiding liaison in French pronunciation.
In this unit, you will learn the rules and principles of elision and enchaînement for an effective and efficacious pronunciation in French.
At this juncture, you should note that lack of adequate learning and mastery of these pronunciation principles has caused many learners of French to have bad command of French pronunciation.
Good understanding of the functioning of these principles will help you to build a solid background in the pronunciation of French language in general.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Define both élision and enchainement • Recognize when to use élision and enchaînement in speech • Identify the difference between liaison, élision and enchainment.
3.0.
L’ÉLISION EN QUESTION Élision is a process by which some words drop their final vowel and replace it with an apostrophe before words beginning with a vowel sound.
It must be noted here that élision does not only have pronunciation implication; it also has orthographic implication.
Generally in French, when words ending with a vowel sound is followed immediately by another word beginning with a vowel sound, the vowel sound of the first word drops to be replaced with apostrophe, as illustrated in the examples below: 57  La hirondelle becomes l’(h)irondelle Le étudiant becomes l’étudiant La ardoise becomes l’ardoise Le enfant becomes l’enfant Also, when the conjunction si is followed by the pronoun il or ils Examples: Si il veut parler becomes s’il veut parler Si ils sont là becomes s’ils sont là At this juncture, it should be noted that there cannot be élision between the conjunction si and the personal pronoun elle.
In other words, you cannot have: Si elle becoming s’elle Si elles becoming s’elles So, si elle and si elles remain as they are; there is no change.
Also note that there cannot be élision between the vowel letter u and letter e. You cannot therefore have: Tu es mon ami becoming t’es mon ami 3.1.
L’ENCHAINEMENT EN QUESTION There are two types of enchaînement in French: enchaiînement vocalique and enchainement consonantique.
The first type occurs when a word ends with a pronounced vowel and the word that follows it immediately begins with a vowel.
In the second type, the word ends with a pronounced consonant but followed by another word beginning with a vowel sound.
(i) Examples of enchaînement vocalique: - Il va-au cinéma - Jai-eu –un billet - Il a – eu un ami - Il a parlé- une langue inconnue.
(ii) Examples of enchaînement consonantique: - Il – est treiz(e) – heure(s)- à Paris - Ell(e) _ adore _ êtr(e) – amiable - Un bel _oiseau.
4.0.
CONCLUSION Elision and enchainement constitute a source of wrong pronunciation of French words among people learning French as a foreign language, especially among English-speaking learners of French.
However, this can be corrected if adequate time is devoted to their learning, right from the first year.
You are therefore advised to make sure you have thoroughly mastered these principles before you proceed to the next unit.
Do not rush to go to 58 the next unit if you discover that you still have problem in understanding and using these principles of practical French.
5.0.
SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt the principles of élision and enchainement as they relate to pronunciation in French.
At the beginning of the unit, you were told that if you fail to have a solid background in these principles, you may have difficulties in future to correct the errors associated with them.
You also learnt the difference between liaison and enchainement.
As you have been advised earlier on, make sure you master the functioning of these phonological principles before you proceed to the next level of the course.

References 1.0 INTRODUCTION In units 11, 12 and 13, you learnt some phonological phenomena that govern fluency in French speech production, such as élision, enchaînement and liaison.
In this unit, you will learn yet another phonological phenomenon call Accent (stress).
Accent is characteristic of every sound produced in speech, especially in the French Langugae.
Your ability to speak French with a “French accent” will inform your proficiency in that language.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Define what is called accent • Determin where an accent should be placed in a word when speaking French.
• Distinguish between French Accent and English Accent • Speak French with the appropriate accent where necessary.
3.0 L’ACCENT In speech, we produce series of sounds.
Each sound produced is characterized by some fundamental varying parameters which include: energy, frequency and duration.
A sound produced with energy is determined by a heavy air flow from the lungs, which causes an important vibration of the vocal cords.
Also, a sound can be produced with an increase in the frequency of the voice, thereby causing a rapid vibration of the vocal cords; so also can a sound be produced longer in duration than the other sounds.
Those are the three factors that define Accent in a given language.
In the case of French language, the last factor, that is duration, is 60 prominent.
French language uses two types of accent: accent final and accent d’insistance 3.1 L’ACCENT FINAL In French, stress (l’accent) is always placed on the final syllable of a word, and that is why in French we talk of accent final.
Stress placement in French is totally different from that of English because in English, the syllable that bears the stress varies according to the word itself; thus the stress can be on the initial, medial of final syllable of a particular word.
The implication of this difference is that the study and use of stress in French is easier than the one in English.
Examine the examples below for illustration: Examples: i la fille [la ’fij] ii.
la petite fille [la p(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)tit ’fij] iii.
la petite fille malade [la p(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)tit ’fij ma’lad] You will notice that in all the three groups of French words, it is the last syllable of each group that is stressed: fij, fij and lad respectively.
Autres exemples: 1.
Il aime regarder la téléviSION 2.
Je finirai le devoir deMAIN 3.
Les étudiants sont fainéants 3.2 L’ACCENT D’INSISTANCE This is the sound type of accent in French.
It is used to lay emphasis on a syllable in particular within a series of syllables.
Countrary to what is done in the case of accent final, the accent d’insistance is placed, not at the final syllable, but rather at the beginning of each word.
Very often, the Accent d’insistance is manifested by the frequency rising of the voice.
Examples: 1.
C’est par sur la table, c’est sous la table [sεpa ‘syr la ‘tabl sε ‘su la ‘tabl] 2.
Moi je trouve ça inacceptable [mwa(cid:536)(cid:415) tRuv sa ‘’i naksεp ‘tabl] In those examples, the accent final falls on the last syllable tabl while the accent d’insistance falls on sur, sous and i respectively.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt what stress (accent) entails in French and how it is used in different situations.
The more you understand and practice it, the better your oral expression in that language.
61 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have been taught French stress (accent).
You have learnt about the stress pattern of French, especially how it is different from what you have in English.
Always make sure that you are not confused and that you have adequately understood the content of this unit.
As it is often said, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.
So, do not relent in your effort to put all those phonological aspects in practice anytime you express yourself in French.

INTRODUCTION Having learnt French pronunciation principles such as liaison, elision and enchaînement in the previous units, you are now, more than ever before familiar with the pronunciation of words in French.
Meanwhile; there are still few principles that you will need to learn.
In this unit, you will learn the principles of intonation.
These principles are essential to good pronunciation of French sounds and letters.
2.0 OBJECTIVES On completion of this unit, you should be able to: • Define both intonation and stress in a language • Distinguish between intonation and stress in pronunciation.
• Identify the intonation pattern that goes with each type of sentence in French.
3.0.
DEFINITION OF INTONATION The Longman dictionary of contemporary English defines intonation as a pattern of rise and fall in the level of the voice, which often adds meaning to what is being said; e.g.
to show that the speaker is angry or elated etc.
The Oxford, Advanced Learner dictionary corroborates this definition by defining intonation as the rise and fall of voice in speaking especially as it affects the meaning of what is being said.
The pattern of intonation in English is not the same as that of French.
So, as you go further in this unit to learn about French intonation, it is important for you to note that you are learning the pronunciation of a 63 language that is different from English.
Before you go into learning French intonation, try to pronounce the following English sentences: (a) Could you please come?
(b) Your name was mentioned.
(c) What a nice attempt!
If your voice goes up towards the end of the sentences, then the intonation is said to be a rising one, but if your voice comes down, then it is a descending or falling intonation.
Now, suggest the type of intonation in each of the three sentences.
3.1 INTONATION IN FRENCH A good French pronunciation requires mastery of several elements as has been underlined in the previous units.
Intonation is a major element of pronunciation in French language.
In French, as in other languages, Intonation refers to the varying pitch levels of speech often referred to as the “melody” of a language, intonation is associated with certain sentence types: declarative, exclamative, imperative and interrogative (questions).
In French, rising intonation is called intonation montante, while the falling intonation is called intonation descendante.
Declarative intonation: - Short declarative sentences typically have a falling intonation.
Je mange du riz Nous allons à l’école Il est Nigérian Maman viendra demain.
- Longer declarative sentences often have a rise then a fall intonation S’il pleut, je ne sortirai pas Les animaux dans la forêt sont sauvages Le vice-chancelier de l’université est une femme J’étudie le français a l’Université Convenant.
Exclamative intonation - Exclamative intonation is marked by a sharp fall in pitch : Quelle bonne idée!
Oh la la!
Comme elle est belle !
Quel mauvais sort !
64 Imperative intonation - Imperative intonation is similar to exclamative intonation – that is, a sharp fall at the end.
Donnez-moi de l’argent Ouvre la porte Allons à la maison Viens ici Interrogative intonation A/ Yes/No (oui ou nom) questions are marked by a sharp rise of intonation at the final syllable Vous êtes Nigeria?
Est-il le président de l’association?
Est-ce qu’il est étudiant ?
Tu prends de la bière ?
B/ Information questions begins with a intonation on the question word (où, pourquoi, comment, quand, qu’est-ce que, quel, etc) and then gradually fall.
Comment vous appelez-vous ?
Quand est-ce que tu es arrivé ?
Qu’est-ce que vous-voulez ?
Où se trouve le Togo ?
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt what intonation is about in French and how it is used in different situations.
The more you understand and practice it, the better your oral expression in that language.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have been taught French intonation as it applies to different sentence patterns.
You have learnt that French intonation is generally the same as what is obtained in other languages.
Remember that a falling intonation is characteristic of declarative sentences, while a rising intonation characterizes interrogative sentences.
As it is often said, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.
So, do not relent in your efforts to practice these intonation patterns anytime you express yourself in French.

INTRODUCTION Traditionally, the lexicon has been regarded as nothing more than an appendix to the grammar which contains the idiosyncratic properties of lexical items and morphemes.
But nowadays, lexicon is recognized as a central component of the grammar which contains not only idiosyncratic properties of words and morphemes, but also regular word-formation and phonological rules, hence the type of phonology termed lexical phonology.
In this unit, you will learn the definition of lexical phonology as well as the levels of operation of lexical phonology as it applies to a particular language.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Understand what is called lexical phonology • Define the different levels of lexical phonology • Understand how lexical phonology functions in a given language • Understand the difference between lexical phonology and the other types of phonology.

WHAT IS LEXICAL PHONOLOGY?
Lexical phonology concerns the relation between phonology, morphology and lexicon.
And its name suggests, lexical phonology gives the lexicon a key role.
67 4.0.
LEVELS OF LEXICAL PHONOLOGY One of the claims of lexical phonology is that both inflexional and derivational word-formation processes can be displayed on a series of linked levels, also called strata, as shown in the diagram below: basically, there are two levels of lexical phonology: level 1 and level 2.
4.1.
LEVEL 1 OF LEXICAL PHONOLOGY Level 1 contains what is called bound morphemes, that is morphemes which cannot occur independently but must always be attached to some other form.
Examples: Ac-cept-er Con-jug-uer Per-cev-oir Con-ten-ir The above examples show one of the important characteristics of level 1 affixes which tend to be semantically opaque, that is their meaning is difficult to get.
4.2.
LEVEL 2 OF LEXICAL PHONOLOGY Level 2 contains affixes (usually suffixes) which do not have any effect on stress, whereby words are stressed the same way regardless of the presence or absence of these suffixes.
Here you have morphemes that can occur independently.
Examples: Courag-eux Conscienc-ieux Respect-able Vol-eur Vol-euse Enchant-é-e In these examples, each affixe is semantically transparent, with a meaning easy to get.
5.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have acquired basic knowledge on lexical phonology.
You have also learnt two fundamental levels as contained in lexical phonology.
The more you understand and practice it, the better your understanding of French phonology in particular.
6.0.
SUMMARY In this unit, you have been taught lexical phonology as it applies to French language.
You have learnt that there are two levels of analysis of morphemes: level 1 deals with what is called bound morphemes 68 which cannot occur separately, and level 2 with morphemes that can occur independently and have meaning on their own, unlike level 1 morphemes.
You must endeavour to understand this unit very well before you proceed to the next unit.

INTRODUCTION In this unit, you will learn another important aspect in the study of French language: the syllable (la syllable).
You should note that each language has its own pattern of syllable, hence the need for you to understand the one that is peculiar to your language of study – French.
Make sure you understand and master this unit very well.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES On completion of this unit, you should be able to: - Define what is syllable in French - Understand the syllable pattern in French - Understand the roles of syllable in French - Place stress (accent) correctly on syllables - Divide words into syllables correctly.
3.0.
LA SYLLABE FRANÇAISE In French, a syllable is a group of sounds that are pronounced together at once.
A syllable is made of either one (1) single vowel or one (1) vowel and one (1) or more consonants.
Examples: (i) A vowel as syllable: a-y-é-à, etc.
(ii) 2 vowels or more as a syllable ; au – ou-eau-eu, etc.
(iii) A vowel plus a consonant or a consonant plus a vowel : il-ça-fi- si, etc.
(iv) A vowel plus several consonants : autre-arc-outre-entre, etc 70  3.1.
REPRÉSENTATION DE LA STRUCTURE SYLLABIQUE You should note here that there are several structures of syllable in French.
Taking the examples above, you have the following structures: (i) A vowel: V (ii) 2 vowels or more: vv-vvv (iii) A vowel + a consonant: vc (iv) A consonant + a vowel: cv (v) A vowel + several consonants: vcc 3.2.
LA SYLLABIFICATION Syllabification is the process of cutting words into syllables.
In French, you have the following principles for cutting words into syllables: (a) In the case of a single vowel or many vowels pronounced as a sound, the word is the syllable: no cutting Examples: a – eu – eau (b) In the case of word with one consonant, as in (iii) and (iv) above, the whole word is considered a syllable.
Examples: il – fi - si (c) In the case of a word with 2 similar consonants, you cut in between the 2 consonants Examples: ef-fet; ar-rêt; ac-cord (d) In the case of a word with 2 different consonants, you separate the consonants, except if at the end of the word.
Examples: as-pect; ab-sen-ce.
(e) In the case of a word with 3 consonants, you cut after the second consonant Examples: cons-cien-ce; obs-ti-né; comp-ter, except in words where you have ‘ph’, ‘ch’, ‘th’, ‘gn’ as in: mar-cher, as-phy-xie or where you have r or I as the last letter of the word: ar-br, ap- plau-dir.
You should note the following rules: • When you have a word where there is a group of letters that are pronounced as a single sound, you do not separate the group.
Examples: é-chan-ger; é-le-phant; a- théé; mon-ta-gne.
71 • Also, when you have 2 or 3 vowels together in a word, you do not separate the vowels either.
Examples: théa-tre; oa-sis; ré-gion; es-pion; bout; as-seoir; beau-té.
4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt another aspect of phonology called syllable, particularly with regard to French language.
You also learnt how to recognize syllables in given words, and the rules or principles governing their structure.
5.0.
SUMMARY In this unit, you learnt various aspects of syllable in the French language, its various structures and all possible cases of syllabification, with the rules and exceptions governing its process.
Thus, you have the following syllable structures: a single vowel (V), a combination of 2 or more vowels (VV or VVV), a combination of vowel and consonant (VC or CV), etc.
The rules governing syllabification must be mastered.
It would be a good thing for you to do a lot of exercises on syllabification to enhance mastery.

INTRODUCTION Assimilation is a typical sound change process by which the phonetics of a speech segment becomes more like that of another segment in a word (or at a word boundary), so that a change of phoneme occurs.
You should remember (cf.
unit 10) that assimilation can occur, influencing a preceding segment (forward) or a following segment (backward).
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Understand the concept of assimilation as it applies to French language • Identify the different types of assimilation • Explain satisfactorily each type of assimilation • Apply the different types of assimilation where necessary and correctly when speaking French.
3.0.
L’ASSIMILATION If sound changes with reference to a following segment, it is traditionally called “regressive assimilation”; changes with reference to a preceding segment are traditionally called “progressive”.
These terms seems to be confusing, as they seem to mean the opposite of the intended meaning.
Accordingly, a variety of alternative terms have arisen – not all of which avoid the problem of the traditional terms.
Regressive assimilation is also known as right-to-left or 73 anticipatory assimilation.
Progressive assimilation is also known as left-to-right or perseveratory or preservative or lag assimilation.
3.1.
L’ASSIMILATION REGRESSIVE It is important for you to note here that this type of assimilation is called regressive because the sound that is influenced (= assimilated) is placed before the sound influencing (= assimilating) it.
Examples: - Cela va de soit When you pronounce slowly the underlined words, you say: [d(cid:415)swa], but When you pronounce rapidly, you say [tswa], because after elision of the sound (cid:415), [ d ] becomes [ t ] by the process of its assimilation by the voiceless sound [ s ] which follows it.
- Nous avons pu observer When you pronounce slowly the underlined word, you say: [(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)bsεRve], but When you pronounce rapidly, you say: sound [(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)(cid:474)psεRve], because the voiced sound [ b] has been affected through assimilation by the voiceless sound [ s] following it.
- Mon médecin est très gentil When you pronounce slowly the underlined word, you say [med(cid:415)sε], but When you pronounce rapidly the underlined word, you say: [metsε], because, after elision of the sound [ (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)], [ d] becomes [ t] under the influence of the voiceless sound [ s] which follows it.
3.2.
L’ASSIMILATION PROGRESSIVE You should note here that this type of assimilation is called progressive because the sound that is influenced (= assimilated) is placed after the sound influencing (= assimilating) it.
Examples: - Mes cheveux sont touffus When you pronounce rapidly the underlined word, you say: [∫(cid:415)vvvv(cid:827)], but 74 When you pronounce rapidly the underlined word, you say: [∫f(cid:827)], because after elision of [ (cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)(cid:415)], the voiced sound [ v] becomes [ ffff] through assimilation, being in direct contact with the voiceless sound [ ∫∫∫∫ ]which precedes, that is comes before it.
- Il n’a pas bien fait When you pronounce slowly the underlined word, you say: [ilnapa], but When you pronounce rapidly the underlined word, you say: [iln(cid:2903)(cid:2903)(cid:2903)(cid:2903)paaaa], because the oral vowel sound [ a] becomes a nasal vowel sound [(cid:2903)(cid:2903)(cid:2903)(cid:2903)ЧЧЧЧ] by assimilation, being in direct contact with the nasal consonant sound [ nnnn] which comes before it.
3.3.
L’ASSIMILATION DOUBLE You should learn here that an assimilation double is an assimilation which is both regressive and progressive, that is the sound affected is assimilated by both the preceding and the following sounds.
Examples: - Pendant les vacances, je voyagerai en Europe - When you pronounce slowly the underlined words, you say : [ pãdãlevakãs], but - When you pronounce rapidly the underlined words, you say: - [[pãnãlevakãs]], whereby [d] becomes [n] because of the influences of the preceding nasal vowel [ ã ] and the following nasal vowel [ ã].
In other words, the oral stop sound [d] is nasalized, thus changing to the nasal constructive sound [n].
4.0.
CONCLUTION In this unit, you have learnt more about Assimilation, particularly with regard to French language.
You have also learnt the different types of assimilation you can get in French, and how each one of them functions.
5.0.
SUMMARY In this unit, you learnt various types of assimilation in the French language, viz regressive assimilation, progressive assimilation and double assimilation.
In other words, you have learnt that a given sound can be influenced by either the preceding or the following sound or both sounds at the same time, and that those affected sounds 75 change from their nature to the nature of the influencing sounds.
Thus under the said influence, a voiced sound becomes voiceless, and a voiceless becomes voiced, etc.
It would be in your own interest to endeavour to master those assimilation principles.

INTRODUCTION In this unit, you will learn one of the basic schools of thought in phonology – the generative phonology, with all it entails as components.
You will also learn what each of these components is.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Define what generative phonology is • Understand the concept of generative phonology • Understand the components of generative phonology • Define each component 3.0.
DEFINITION Generative phonology is a component of generative grammar that assigns the correct phonetic representations to utterances in such a way as to reflect a native speaker’s internalized grammar.
4.0.
COMPONENTS OF GENERATIVE PHONOLOGY Generally, there are five components of generative phonology, which are: (i) Levels of representation (ii) Phonological rules (iii) Derivations (iv) Distinctive features (v) Linearity 77 4.1.
LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION • Generative phonology posits two levels of phonological representation: - An underlying representation is the most basic form of a word before any phonological rules have been applied to it.
Underlying representations show what a native speaker knows about the abstract underlying phonology of the language.
- A phonetic representation is the form of a word that is spoken and heard.
4.2.
PHONOLOGICAL RULE Phonological rules map underlying representations onto phonological representations.
The delete, insert, or change segments, or change the features of segments.
See unit 10 for full details on phonological rules as they apply to French language.
4.3.
DERIVATIONS A Phonological derivation is the set of stages used to generate the phonetic representation of a word from its underlying representation.
Here is a diagram of the stages in a derivation.
Phonological rules influence each stage of a derivation: Examples Here are some examples of the derivations of words having the negative prefix /In/: 4.4.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Distinctive features make it possible to capture the generalities of phonological rules.
See unit 9 for full details on distinctive features of phonemes; 4.5.
LINEARITY A stream of speech is portrayed as a sequence of discrete sound segments.
Each segment is composed of simultaneously occurring features.
78 5.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt the general concept of generative phonology.
It is a theory on which the phonological description of any language is based.
In other words, generative phonology is the basic theory for the phonological study of all languages, including French 6.0.
SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt the basic concept about generative phonology.
You have also learnt the inherent components of generative phonology, which include the two levels of representation of a word in a particular language – the underlying and the phonetic, phonological rules and features – which you have studies in units 9 & 10, and the derivations and the linearity of features.
You should take time to study this unit and make sure you understand it very well before you proceed to the last unit of this course.

TRENDS IN PHONOLOGY In ancient India, the Sanskrit grammarian Panini (c. 520-460 BC), who is considered the founder of linguistics, in his text of Sanskrit phonology, the Shiva Sutras, discovers the concepts of the phoneme, the morpheme and the root.
The Shiva Sutras describe a phonemic notational system in the fourteen initial lines of the Astãdhyãуĩ.
The notional system introduces different clusters of phonemes that serve special roles in the morphology of Sanskrit, and are referred to throughout the text.
Panini’s grammar of Sanskrit had a significant influence on Ferdinand de Saussure, the father of modern structuralism, who was a professor of Sanskrit.
The Polish scholar Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, (together with his former student Mikolaj Kruszewski) coined the word phoneme in 1876, and his work, though often unacknowledged, is considered to be the starting point of modern phonology.
He worked not only on the theory of the phoneme but also on phonetic alternations (i.e;, what is now called allophony and 80 morphophonology).
His influence on Ferdinand de Saussure was also significant.
Prince Nikolai Turbetzkoy’s posthumously published work, the Principles of Phonology (1939), is considered the foundation of the Prague School of Phonology.
Directly influence by Baudouin de Courtenay, Turbetzkoy is considered the founder of morphophonology, though morphophonology was first recognized by Baudouin de Courtenay.
Trubetzkoy split phonology into phonemics and archiphonemics; the former has had more influence than the latter.
Another important figure in the Prague School was Roman Jakobson, who was one of the most prominent linguists of the twentieth century.
In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for Generative Phonology.
In this view, Phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features.
The features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle.
The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or -.
There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation.
Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so called surface form).
An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments.
Furthermore, the Generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.
Natural Phonology was a theory based on the publications of its proponent David Stampe in 1969 and (more explicitly) in 1979.
In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes which interact with one another, which ones are active and which are suppressed are language- specific.
Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups.
Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance.
Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another).
The second-most prominent Natural Phonologist is Stampe’s wife, Patricia Donegan; there are many Natural phonologists in Europe, though also a few others in the U.S., such as Geoffry Pullum.
The principles of Natural phonology were extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler, who founded Natural Morphology.
In 1976 John Goldsmith introduced autosegmental phonology.
Phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on one linear sequence of segments, called phonemes or feature combinations, but rather as involving some parallel sequences of features which reside on multiple 81 tiers.
Autosegmental phonology later evolved into Feature Geometry, which became the standard theory of representation for the theories of the organization of phonology as different as Lexical Phonology and Optimality Theory.
Government Phonology, which originated in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify theoretical notions of syntactic and phonoliogical structures, is based on the notion that all language necessarily follow a small set of principles and vary according to their selection of certain binary parameters.
That is, all languages’ phonological structures are essentially the same, but there is restricted variation that accounts for differences in surface realizations.
Principles are held to be inviolable, though parameters may sometimes come into conflict.
Prominent figures include Jonathan Kaye (Linguist), Jean Lowenstamm, Jean-Roger Vergnaud, Monik Charette, John Harris, and many others.
In 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed Optimality Theory – an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints which is ordered by importance: a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint.
The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become the dominant trend in phonology.
Though this usually goes unacknowledged, Optimality Theory was strongly influenced by Natural Phonology; both view phonology in terms of constraints on speakers and their production, though these constraints are formalized in very different ways.
4.0.
CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt the different schools of thought in phonology, beginning from the foundation to the present-day phonology.
You have also learnt the great names in phonology, from Panini to Trubetzkoy, then from Chomsky to Glodsmith, then to Saussure, etc.
