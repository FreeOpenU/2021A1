3.2 Why Must We Listen?
3.3 Listening Enabling Skills 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION You are welcome to this unit entitled Listening Enabling Skills.
In this unit, you will be exposed to who a learner is, why the learner must listen and what he or she should listen to.
The listening enabling skills that you need to function effectively in the programmes you enrolled in will then be unfolded to you.
As you go through this unit; have with you a pen, a paper, a tape recorder and the CD sent to you in the study pack.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • state clearly who a listener is • determine the reason you must listen throughout the programme • list the listening enabling skills • apply the listening enabling skills discussed while practising some of the activities given in the unit.
11 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Who is a Listener?
I have a simple answer for this question.
You are that listener.
You are a listener because listening is a compulsory day to day activity of the programme.
Although, most of the time you will be reading; there will be occasions when you have to listen to a tape recorder, radio, television or video in this programme.
You are likely going to attend lectures and meetings in the study centre.
You need the skill of listening accurately and to comprehend what is conveyed to you as information.
That is why you need to go through this unit, carefully.
As a listener, I cannot determine where you are now, studying this unit; it maybe in your home, your work place, an isolated place or even inside a vehicle taking you to a destination.
Wherever you may be, there is something important about listening.
We listen daily, moment by moment.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE i.
Who is a listener?
ii.
What do you listen to?
If you have done the above self-assessment exercise very well, you probably must have written down answers such as that indicated below.
A listener is anybody who is capable of listening to anything said, and possibly, participates in what he listened to and what is demanded to be done.
In fact, as a reader of this unit you are a listener, although it is possible for you to be deaf and be doing this course.
Even If you are deaf, you still listen to sign language.
What do you listen to?
You can listen to a tape recorder, a video, or a lecture.
Did you get all the answers correctly?
If you did, then fine.
It means that you are following me in this study.
Let us go to the second part of our study.
Can you guess the next thing to discuss?
Your guess may be as good as mine: why must we all listen?
3.2 Why Must We Listen?
You as a listener must listen because listening is a day to day activity.
You listen to your friends talking, may be in your language or English.
You listen to directions when you are lost or new to a place.
You listen to lectures, which are delivered by specialists in a field.
You listen at home, at work, in the office, to a telephone conversation and so on.
12  Listening activities can therefore be divided into two major parts, namely- listening in general, social setting and listening for specific purposes.
The kind of listening we are interested in here is listening for specific purposes.
That is, listening to gather information, for directions, listening to academic lectures, to process involved in doing something, or listening to critically evaluate what a speaker is saying.
Your concern in this study is also listening in English.
Indeed, English is the medium of instruction.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Which of the following is NOT the purpose of listening to gather information?
Indicate with a tick ().
i.
Day to day activity  ii.
Telephone conversation  iii.
Eating a delicious food  iv.
Working in the office  v. Critical evaluation of what people are saying  vi.
Absorbing academic lectures.
 The last part of this unit is the most important.
This part deals with listening enabling skills.
3.3 Listening Enabling Skills No matter where you are, you need the following requirements for active listening: • functioning ears • concentration • ability to think along with the speaker • ability to anticipate what the speaker is about to say • ability to note important signposts that keep the listening activity going.
Anybody with a functioning ear can listen.
Indeed, this is the attribute common to many people.
Even the deaf listen by means of signals from sign language.
Of course, if you have listening defects, listening ability will be difficult.
13 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the first passage on the CD in your study pack.
Test the functioning of your ears by listening to the passage and filling the gaps indicated below.
You need to listen attentively before you can complete this activity.
Our aim is to analyse the 1._______that the 2.________of conflict resolution has had in coming to 3._________with conflicts between social 4.__________.
We explore the 5._________between dispute 6.__________and conflict 7.__________.
If you allowed your functioning ear to be active, you would have been able to fill in the gaps.
Now rewind the CD to the passage to mark this exercise.
Were you able to fill all the gaps correctly?
Congratulations, if you did.
If you could not do so, more practice activities in this module will assist you to utilise your functioning ear well.
The next listening enabling skill you need is CONCENTRATION.
Effective listening is difficult in the midst of interruption, when there is lack of interest in the topic, noise and when a speaker speaks above your head by using difficult words.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the second passage on your CD.
Put down in any order what made listening and understanding of the passage difficult for you.
You probably may have listed some of the following as what made listening and understanding of the passage difficult for you.
• The language is complex and full of difficult words • Noise coming out of the environment you are in • The uninteresting nature of the topic • Difficulty in following the speaker The point for you to note here is that concentration is an important component of effective listening.
The third listening enabling skill is ability.
Think along with the speaker and anticipate what the speaker is about to say.
You cannot think along with the speaker if your mind goes astray.
You cannot anticipate the next thing, if your attention is not there.
There are some signals in listening that can facilitate anticipation.
Some of these are put in the box below.
14  The speaker says… You anticipate… First of all… Secondly In the past… Now… Areas of strength… Areas of weakness The most important… The less Indeed, ability to anticipate can assist you in good listening.
The fourth listening enabling skill is relationship.
That is, your ability to relate or connect what was said before with what the speaker is saying now.
Relationship comes into listening when expressions such as “as I said before”, “on the one hand”, “consequently”, “in other words”, etc., are said by the speaker.
Lastly, ability to pay attention to significant sign posts such as “firstly”, “secondly”, “lastly”, “now”, “next”, “where”, “when”, “who”, and so on, is an important listening enabling skill.
These signs tell you the important points that the speaker is making.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the third passage on your tape recorder and perform the following activities.
Fill in the gaps as you listen to the passage.
1.
____________________________________________________ 2.
____________________________________________________ 3.
____________________________________________________ 4.
____________________________________________________ Passage for self-assessment exercise (to be recorded on a CD) Passage 1.1 Our aim here is to analyse the difficulty the field of conflict resolution has had in coming to terms with conflicts between social classes.
We explore the distinction between dispute settlement and conflict resolution Passage 1.2 (To be recorded on a cassette) The areas covered include generic theory and practice, concepts and aspects of resolution process, and the practice at different levels, the relevance of theory to the practitioner, and applications of the various contributions to South-Africa.
Class, intercultural, public policy, environmental and international recession and possession all featured prominently in the discussions.
15 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Passage 1.3 (To be recorded on a CD) Listen to what I have said before, relate it to what I am saying now and anticipate what I am about to say.
Write down what you predict I am going to say next.
1.
You can hardly say you know something until you can do it.
This takes quite a bit of practice.
Furthermore learning is an active rather than 1._____________ 2.
You must understand first before you can learn well.
It means therefore that if you are listening t lecture, the first thing you should do is to strive for 2._____ 3.
Many students think it is a waste of time to leave their books and go to the field, swimming pool courts.
This is absolutely 3.___________ .A good deal of mental fatigue is removed through 4.__________________.
4.0 CONCLUSION Now that you have completed the study of this unit, I think you can start to put into practice what you learnt in your day to day contact with people and in your academic pursuits.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we studied who a listener is, why we must listen and the listening enabling skills of listener.
As indicated in the unit, you are the listener.
You listen day by day and moment by moment.
The listening enabling skills you need are- functioning ears, concentration and ability to think along with the speaker and relate or connect ideas together.
Anticipation and important signposts facilitate effective listening.

Have you seen yourself as a listener?
I think you are now practising some of the enabling skills.
In this unit, you are going to study the relationship between listening and comprehending.
You probably are familiar with the term listening- comprehension.
Indeed, listening is closely related to comprehension.
Listening is useless if there is no comprehension.
Get ready to study the unit.
You need pen, paper and a tape recorder for the unit.
The cassette in your study pack will also be used in the unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • show clearly the relationship between listening and comprehension • perform tasks on how to comprehend • state factors affecting comprehension.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Relationship between Listening and Comprehending Do you know the relationship between listening and comprehension?
You listen to comprehend and you comprehend, while listening.
This section exposes you to the relationship between listening and comprehension.
18  As you listen, you must always be ready to comprehend.
Comprehension is at different levels during the art of listening.
Some speeches are to be comprehended, superficially, because the points are not too important.
Some need proper attention because what is to be discussed is very important.
Flexibility in the art of listening and comprehension is therefore very important.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to passage 2.1 titled Course Requirements casually and bring out the major points.
Use the space below.
The passage is about________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ Since you listened to the passage with minimal comprehension, you are likely not going to put down more than the major points of the passage.
May be you may be able to say that the passage is about what participants will be able to do after the completion of the media course.
Nobody will expect you to say more than this in a casual listening activity.
Comprehension is bound to be minimal SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Now listen to passage 2.1 again with proper attention.
Pay attention to details.
After the listening activity, fill in the gap below with the actual words or expressions from the passage.
Participants should be able to: (a) 1._________and 2._________a wide 3.________of 4._________5._________ 6.__________ (b) Adopt a systematic 7____________to the design of training 8.____________.

What did you score out of 22 points?
• If you scored all, you are a very good intense listener.
• If you scored three quarters, you are a good intense listener.
• If you scored half, you are just fair.
• Below half, try again.
In fact, comprehension is more than getting all the words or expressions in a listening passage.
You need more than words to comprehend.
You need the general knowledge of what you comprehend.
The more familiar you are with the topic, the better the comprehension.
This brings us to the second part of our study: How can you comprehend what you listened to?
20  3.2 Listening-Comprehension So far in this unit, we stressed the fact that listening is closely related to comprehension.
In this action, we are going to discuss how to comprehend.
In order to comprehend you should: • listen attentively • follow the speaker • posses a wide range of vocabulary related to the subject being discussed • recognise general speech pattern and major speech divisions such as introduction, main body of speech, transitional clues, change of ideas, shift of emphasis, summary, concluding remarks, etc.
• put your experience of the world to bear on the topic • show interest in the topic.
The chart below indicates how to carry out all the comprehension steps listed above.
Fig.2.1:Steps to Listening-Comprehension 21 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the audio recording captioned passage 2.2 and perform the comprehension tasks below.
The title of the passage is Factors for Choosing a Mate.
(a) The major points raised by the speaker are 1________2.________3.________ 4._________ (b) _________is commonly valued in our society than __________and ________ (c) Societal expectation is ____________________________________________ (d) Discrepancy often occurs when ____________________________________ (e) What are the arguments for or against the following as raised in the passage?
(i) Age and marriage________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ (ii) Male ego_______________________________________ (iii) Physical attraction_______________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ If you comprehend the passage, you would discover that the major points raised as factors for choosing a mate are: 1. physical attractiveness physical size age and health.
If you pay particular attention to details in the passage you would have discovered that: 2. beauty in women is commonly valued in our society more than intelligence or ability.
If you deeply comprehend the passage you would have discovered that: 3. societal expectation is for the husband (for the male) to be taller than the wife (or the woman).
22  SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the audio recording of passage 2.2 again and give the meaning of the following words as used in the passage.
1.
Tolerable 2.
Shallow foundation 3.
Criterion 4.
Incompatibility 5.
Trivial 6.
Bruising 7.
Discrepancy 8.
Ego 9.
Flexibility 10.
Contemplating 11.
Affectionate Although knowledge of all the vocabulary items in a passage does not, necessarily, suggest absolute comprehension of the passage, if you do not know the meaning of all the words listed above, to comprehend the passage may be difficult.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the audio-recording of passage 2.2 again and list all transitional words found.
Some of them are listed for you here: In our lecture today... Before ...
Almost ...
However ...
These words are signposts that direct you to the major points of the passage.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Finally, listen to the audio-recording of passage 2.2 again and suggest the experiences you had before the passage that assisted you in comprehending it (the passage).
I do not know your prior knowledge of experiences regarding marriage; but as for me, my knowledge of beautiful women, short men, tall women, old men marrying young women, and disease in a family assisted me very much in comprehending the passage.
23 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Let's go to the last part of this unit and this is a factor that can affect comprehension.
3.3 Factors Affecting Comprehension This section is directly the opposite of how to comprehend.
The following can affect the rate of comprehension.
• Not being familiar with the topic • Lack of concentration • Lack of interest • Limited language and vocabulary of the subject matter • Inability to think deeply.
Passage 2.1 Course Requirements On satisfactory completion of the course, participants should be able to: • set up and operate a wide variety of instructional media equipment • adopt a systematic approach to the design of training materials • select appropriate technologies of instruction to achieve specific training objectives • perform basic media production skills, scripting for learning, audio-video recording and editing, graphic design, photography, and computer literacy • present instruction effectively to learners.
4.0 CONCLUSION Comprehension is central to all listening activities.
As you listen to lectures, seminars and tutorials in your study centre, make sure you avoid barriers that can hinder comprehension.
Remember, listening without comprehension is useless.
You must always strive for comprehension whenever you listen.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have been exposed to the following: • the relationship between listening and comprehension, and • how to comprehend during listening.
24  We have also given you some of the factors that hinder comprehension; you should put all these points into practice as you study.

Marriage takes two completely different individuals and places them in a position to spend the rest of their lives together in the most intimate relationship we can imagine.
Before marriage becomes a reality, there must be a previously developed feeling of love or strong attractions to him or her.
The following are some of the most common characteristics one considers in selecting a prospective mate.
Physical attractiveness Almost everybody agrees that this factor is overrated and that physical appeal alone is a very shallow foundation for a marriage.
However, in our society beauty in women is still commonly more highly valued than intelligence or creative ability; and more and more women are openly acknowledging the importance of physical attractiveness in the men they desire.
There is little danger in making a mistake on this criteria as long as one holds it in proper perspective and is sure the person one marries has a number of other important traits.
26  Physical size Matching for size is trivial consideration.
Incompatibility based on disproportions in physical size can be considered negligible.
The issue of the woman being taller than the man is probably the most crucial one having to do with physical size.
This reflects a complex set of societal expectations coupled with an abnormal fear of ‘bruising’ the male ego.
Endless numbers of marriages between short men and tall women are successful because the people involved do not measure at his 'inner' talents and qualities.
Age There are two questions here.
Are the parties individually too young to be married (no one is ever too old or is the discrepancy in their ages so great that it suggests difficulties?).
Age discrepancies most frequently involve an older woman and younger man.
Difficulties in adjusting to this factor arise when people concentrate only on chronological years.
It matters not how young or how old a person is but where they are in the life cycle.
Age is a biological process, but the life cycle stages are determined by one's occupation, level maturity, family life experience, degree of flexibility, and most importantly on one's attitude towards life.
Some 65 -year -old men and women are younger in their outlooks on life than some 20 year olds; and so 19 year olds contemplating marriage are more mature than their 45-year old parents.
A crucial issue for those with an age discrepancy contemplating marriage to one another is one of having children.
Based on the reports of Bernice L. Neugarten, children may prove to be less a problem than originally thought, since as the male matures with age, he becomes less aggressive and achievement- oriented and more affectionate gentle, sentimental, and capable of expressing love and warmth.
These are important qualifications parenthood.
People marrying young have the highest divorce rate in our society.
Yet, this is due more to lack maturity and responsibility than chronological years.
The 'danger signal is the young person marrying prove his or her maturity.
It must be remembered that all age considerations are highly individualistic; each case is different.
Health Good health is a factor overlooked in considering a marriage partner because most of us take health for granted.
Here we include emotional well-being as well as physical aspects of health.
A concern for go health 27 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I is a reasonable thing because health is wealth.
Healthy partners ensure happy and long-lasting marriage.

Can you still remember what we said about listening- comprehension?
Listening and comprehension are related.
You listen to comprehend.
Comprehension is at different levels- superficial and deep comprehension.
Flexibility in listening activities is important.
The concentration you give to any listening activity depends on the importance of what is listened to.
In this unit, you will study listening comprehension for note-taking.
All throughout life, you will face situations where you have to listen to lectures, may be delivered by a distinguished special guest or lectures presented in audio recordings, video or on the television.
Occasionally, in this your course, lectures may be delivered at the study centers.
The attempt in this unit is to prepare you for listening, comprehending and taking down notes during lectures.
Get your tape recorder ready.
Rewind your cassette to the section titled listening for note- taking.
If you visit your study centre, you may have a video recording of some of the lectures used as practice exercises in this unit.
Watch it.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define note taking • distinguish between note taking and note-making 29 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I • state, in clear terms, how to take notes • apply note taking techniques to taking notes from lectures • state the dos and don'ts of note taking activity.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Note-Taking and Note-Making Some people cannot distinguish between note-taking and note-making.
The two terms, to such people, can be used inter-changeably.
In this unit, we distinguish between note-taking and note-making.
We take note-taking to mean taking notes from lectures or speeches.
We, however, see note-making as an activity done during study time.
You make notes from your textbooks, journal articles or study texts.
The ability to take good notes while listening to an important talk or lecture is a skill that you will find useful in your studies and generally in life.
You should always take notes while listening to a speech, talk or a lecture, no matter the medium of delivery.
That is, if you listen to a lecture on a video or CD-ROM, you should be able to take notes.
You should also take notes in discussion groups, seminars and tutorials.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Going by the distinction made between note-taking and note-making in this unit, tick () situations when you will take notes and put (x) in situations where you will make notes.
Do this for the situations listed below.
1.
When reading a book in the library  2.
When consulting an encyclopedia  3.
When reading a recent journal  4.
When in a distinguished annual lecture  5.
When listening to a documentary  6.
When you are in the reference section of a library  7.
When listening to a budget broadcast  8.
When consulting yellow pages  9.
When in a crucial meeting  10.
When consulting an open university directory  I don’t think you will find this exercise difficult.
The answers are straightforward.
Any situation that suggests reading, in all the situations listed above, requires note-making.
Thus, when reading a book in the library, consulting an encyclopedia, recent journal, when in the reference section of the library, when consulting yellow pages and an open university directory, you should make notes (put x in the boxes).
30  They are situations when notes are made.
All other situations which entail listening should have a tick ().
They are situations when notes are taken.
Let's go to the next section of our study.
Can you guess the next section?
Check the table of content if you cannot.
The next section of this unit is on how to take notes from lectures.
Let's study it.
3.2 How to Take Notes from Lectures This section gives you training on how you can take notes from lectures, seminars, and tutorials from speeches.
The rules are simple and straightforward.
You should not forget them.
1.
Listen carefully to the lecture- paying attention is very important in note-taking.
Some students start to write as soon as the speaker starts speaking, without taking pain to listen attentively to what the speaker is saying.
2.
Understanding- understand what the speaker is saying before attempting to take notes; take notes when you understand the point.
3.
Put down the summary of the main points of the lecture.
Some students start writing even before the points are made.
Thus, they end up writing irrelevancies.
Most of the things students study, as notes today are irrelevancies because proper notes are not taken.
Write points.
Do not write full sentences in note-taking.
4.
Use abbreviations where necessary and possible.
This saves time.
Common note-taking abbreviations are listed in the box below.
i.e = that is V = verb b/4 = before Prep = preposition/preparation i/c = in charge Pro = pronoun/pronounce, etc = and so on syn = synonyms viz = namely idm = idom sb = somebody sgm = symbol, symbiotic sth = something fig = figure abr = abbreviations BrE = British English b/c = because/became Nig = Nigeria/Nigerian Afr = African/Africa Conj = conjunction Fig.
3.1: Common Note-Taking Abbreviations 31 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I These are just a few.
You can, on your own, find out many more.
Do you know what?
You can even create your own abbreviations.
The only thing is that you should not fill up your notes with too many abbreviations that will make the notes incomprehensible.
Abbreviations save time during note taking.
You need them more when the speaker is fast.
5.
Use symbols where necessary or important- there are many symbols that you can use.
Science and technology students use more symbols than the humanities students.
Be familiar with the symbols in your field.
Some of the symbols you can use in note- taking are presented in the next box.
Fig.
3.2: Symbols for Note-Taking Again, there are many symbols that can be used during note-taking.
Only a few is given here.
Of course, you can also form your own symbols.
Note-taking activities during lectures are fast when symbols are used.
Leave plenty of space between different headings and sub-headings when taking notes.
The spaces are to be used for writing additional information or facts that you may discover after the lectures or during your own private study.
Also leave wide margins for later comments and related references.
Emphasise key words, phrases, sentences and ideas by use of capitalisation, underlining, colouring, asterisks, etc.
Neatness- the neater your notes, the more attractive and the more you would like to read them.
Good handwriting, systematic organisation, 32  consistent use of headings and sub-headings, all add to what can make your notes attractive, pleasant to read and easy to learn.
Let's put into practice all that you have learnt so far.
Get ready.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the audio-recording of passage 3.1- titled Typhoid: A Deadly Disease.
As you listen to the lecture, use the format designed here to take down notes from the lecture.
The structure of the format forces you to take down only the important points.
As you listen, fill in the blanks.
At the end of the exercise, a comprehensive note on the lecture will emerge.
You can now start the exercise.
Remember, you are to listen to the lecture only once.

I think, by now, you must have gone through the lecture and filled the gaps above.
Let's discuss the answers to the exercise.
The first thing in note-taking from lecture is to be able to identify heading and sub-headings.
Indeed, the centre (or main) heading and sub- headings of the lecture are outlined below.
34  Fig.
3.3: Schema for Identifying Topical Headings/sub-Headings This is a very simple heading- sub-heading format for good note-taking.
Of course, it is possible in a more technical and complex note-taking activity to have sub-sub heading under a sub-heading as shown in the next box.
Fig.
3.4: Schema for Identifying Sub-Headings Note that the major points under each sub-heading were not written in complete sentences but in summary form.
Let's fill in the gaps of the lecture on ‘‘Typhoid: A Deadly Disease’’.
Cross-check the notes you took in the earlier exercise with the one presented below.
Rewind your CD to the lecture as you cross-check your notes with mine.

3.2 Dos and Don'ts of Note-Taking What can you deduce regarding ‘‘dos’’ and ‘'don'ts’' of note-taking from lectures, as revealed in the example worked for you in this unit?
Jot down points and compare your points with mine.
36  • Irrelevances were removed from the notes e.g.
the extract: ‘'If the typhoid bacteria are in sufficient dose, one could contract the disease.
The bacteria goes into the blood stream and multiply there and may go on to any part of the body and affect it’' which was the preamble to the component of the lecture titled ‘Symptoms and Treatment’ which was found to be irrelevant to symptoms and treatment of typhoid fever.
That's why it is not included in our notes.
Thus, one of the most important "dos" of note-taking is- always remove irrelevances.
Do not write everything the lecturer says.
• Abbreviations were used.
Abbreviations such as- etc.
(and so on) e.g.
(for example) and symbols such as "/" (for either -or) were used, although sparingly in the lecture.
Check the box!
• not observing simple hygiene rules e.g.
not washing hands • or fruits before eating • diarrhoea or constipation, abdominal pain, etc.
• chlorine/iodine, general • malaise/weakness Use abbreviations during note-taking.
• Heading and sub-headings of the notes were consistent.
The heading is centralised, underlined/in bold letters because not all the letters are capitalised.
If all letters are capitalised, do not underline.
• The notes were not written in full sentences.
You should write points and not full sentences in note taking.
See the illustration in the box that follows: These are not written in full sentences a. typhoid fever caused by typhoid bacteria b. patients or carriers pass the organism in urine or stool c. flies on typhoid bearing faeces or urine and so food and water contaminate it d. typhoid contracted through eating unwashed mangoes and road side food.
• You should write points in notes.
Do not write long sentences.
The shorter your points, the more concise your notes; but beware!
Do not be too brief in your notes such that your meaning becomes 37 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I unclear to you yourself.
Put down enough that will enable you to remember the major points.
Do not write notes on loose sheets which are improperly kept.
Write notes in exercise books or on sheets that are well filed.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Rewind the CD.
Play back the passage 3.1 entitled ‘Typhoid: A Deadly Disease’.
Use abbreviation to shorten the notes that you have formed.
Use symbols to represent some of the points or concepts.
If this exercise is done very well, you will be able to shorten the notes by one third.
For example you will be able to use abbreviations such as: “/” for or and thru for through as in typhoid contracted thru food/water contaminate with faeces/urine = for equals to as in; rural areas = high typhoid epidemic proportion than urban centres → to indicate one idea flowing into the other as in Typhoid suspects = see doctor → stool and urine properly kept → be adequately treated 4.0 CONCLUSION Note-taking activity is very important to all students.
It is needed when listening to lectures, seminars tutorial, and important speeches.
Note- taking brings to memory what has been learnt or heard.
You must always take notes while listening to an important talk.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has made it clear to you that: • note-taking means taking notes from lectures, talks or speeches • note-making is reserved for making notes from your textbooks, journal articles or study texts • before you take notes, you should listen attentively and understand what the speaker is saying • when taking notes, you should put down the major points, use abbreviations and symbols where necessary, leave enough space between different headings, emphasise the key words, etc.
38  6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT i.
Passage 3.1: Typhoid: A Deadly Disease Today's lecture is on a very important, issue captioned ‘Health is Wealth’.
It dwells on a deadly disease called typhoid.
Nobody prays for this disease.
As you listen to the lecture use the form in exercise 3.1, unit 3, to take down notes.
You are allowed to listen to the lecture only once.
Causes Typhoid fever is caused by typhoid bacteria.
The disease is contracted through food or water contaminated with faeces or urine.
Patients and carriers of typhoid (the latter may not suffer from the disease), pass the organism in urine or stool.
If such stool or urine get in contact with food or drinking water then, whoever takes such food or water can get typhoid.
Flies which settle on typhoid-bearing faeces or urine and then settle on food and water contaminate it, endangering the health of anyone who eats the food.
One could get typhoid by eating unwashed mangoes that had fallen on the ground where someone had passed stool around with a high bacteria count of typhoid.
Roadside food sellers are big offenders in transmitting typhoid.
A lot of them do not practise much hygiene.
They may use the toilet without washing their hands properly afterwards, and may contaminate the food or water they sell to their customers.
This applies to any commercial food selling place.
In rural areas, and even some urban centers where water is insufficient in quantity and where the water is not safe, the people are exposed a lot more to typhoid infection.
Adequate and safe water is, therefore, one of the bedrocks of preventing typhoid.
In such situations where water is a scarce commodity, people hardly observe simple hygiene rules like washing hands or fruits before eating, and washing hands after visiting the toilet or latrine.
This group of people increases chances of contracting infection.
In some homes there is also, the problem of lack of proper toilet and sanitary facilities, and people just go to the backyard when they feel like ‘easing’ themselves, or throw rubbish or garbage anywhere, encouraging the breeding of germs which can be a source of contamination.
Even where there are toilets like the pit latrines, if they are not properly made, used and covered, flies 39 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I can fly in and out of the latrines and deposit faeces carrying bacteria on uncovered food or drink.
As far as epidemics are concerned, it is not usual for typhoid to assume epidemic proportions in the urban centres, because most water corporations treat water.
A person suspected to have malaria fever, who does not respond to treatment for malaria, has typhoid fever unless proved otherwise.
A typhoid victim's stool and urine should be properly disposed of so as to avoid transmitting the disease to others.
They must also ensure that they are adequately treated.
Infection may confer only temporary and partial protection against further infection.
Prevention The best preventive measure against typhoid is preventing contamination.
Typhoid is grouped among diseases that are transmitted by the faeco-oral route, i.e.
from faeces to the mouth.
The main thrust of preventing typhoid would therefore be centred on preventing contamination of food and water and having a good standard of personal hygiene.
Once you can prevent contamination, then your chances of getting typhoid are very slim indeed.
All faeces and urine should be properly disposed of, and you should observe simple rules of personal and food hygiene.
Hands and fruits should be washed before eating, and after visiting the toilet.
Fruits such as mangoes, which are eaten raw, must be properly washed.
Foods should be protected from flies.
All excreta and garbage must be properly and safely disposed off.
Foods that could be cooked should be cooked properly, and drinking water, whose source is suspect, must be boiled for 10 minutes, or chemically treated with chlorine or iodine.
Freezing does not kill the typhoid bacteria.
In suspect circumstances, food should be steaming hot to be on the safe side.
In the towns and cities where people use tanks for storing water, these tanks must be properly covered and periodically make sure that the likelihood of the water carrying typhoid is zero.
Broken pipes though may lead to contamination if in close proximity to sources of contamination.
Typhoid epidemics from water are more likely to occur in the rural areas where pipe-borne water is not readily available.
Wells and other sources of water that are not properly protected could become contaminated.
In the rainy season, for example, 40  faeces that may litter around the vicinity of water supply could get washed into these sources of water supply and contaminate them.
Since water is used quite regularly and on a wide scale, there can be danger of an epidemic.
A carrier of typhoid, who is working in a commercial food centre, can also be a source of infection and epidemic if simple rules of personal hygiene are broken.
Carriers are not expected to gain employment in such places.
Symptoms and Treatment If the typhoid bacteria are in sufficient dose, one could contract the disease.
The bacteria go into the blood stream and multiply there and may go on to any part of the body and affect it.
However, the bacteria have a liking for lymphoid tissues of the intestine.
They will then weaken tile area and lead to a hole in the intestine, leading to a very critical and serious state called peritonitis, which is a general spread of fecal-like matter in the abdomen.
The patient's chance of survival is then very slim.
The symptoms of typhoid, usually, begin to manifest about two weeks after contact with the bacteria.
Typhoid fever is usually associated with high fever, headache, general malaise and weakness and diarrhoea or constipation, abdominal pains and a bit of dry cough.
Although there exists, a vaccine for typhoid fever, its effectiveness is only about 70%.
The protection cover lasts for only three years and is partial.
The vaccine is expensive and is not readily available.
Since one could get tile vaccine and still contract typhoid fever, the typhoid vaccine is not in the priority for tile prevention of typhoid.
Therefore, the main weapon for preventing typhoid is simple hygiene.
This in turn is related to good and adequate water supply and provision of good sanitation for the people.

As you listen to the lecture on computers on the audio recording, use the format to take down notes on the lecture.
As you listen to this lecture, fill in the gaps in your worksheet.
At the end of the lecture the major points of the lecture should emerge.

Basically, a computer is a device for storing and processing information, or data- as it is called.
People have found ways of doing these things for thousands of years of course; but computers can process highly complex information at great speed.
As a result of this they are transforming many aspects of our lives.
The development of microprocessors you heard about their manufacture earlier-has speeded up this change even more.
Microprocessors make it possible for computers to work much faster and to be made much smaller.
So, any particular computer can also be made more complex without taking up too much room.
Computers are now being used in an enormous number of areas.
We will look at a few of these.
Computers are widely used in the banking industry for the processing of cheques.
The code numbers on cheques are printed in magnetic ink which can be read by a computer.
When you pay 42  in a cheque, it is sent to a central clearing house where all the cheques are sorted according to the banks they belong to.
Cheques for a particular bank are then sent back to it, where they are processed by another computer and the two accounts involved are debited and credited according to the amount on the cheque.
Computers are also being used to process withdrawals and the payment of standing orders.
Another development is known as the Electronic Funds Transfer.
This system makes it possible to transfer money directly from one account to another via a computer.
It is controlled by a computer in Belgium.
If it is accepted by banks generally, this computer will become the centre of a highly efficient world-wide network.
Computers are being used more and more in medicine too.
The commonest use is for keeping the records of patients.
There may be access to these at several points -wards, offices, laboratories and even operating theatres.
Computers are also used in the delicate task of looking after patients in intensive care units and in monitoring those undergoing surgery.
One of the latest developments is to use computers to assist diagnosis.
A computer is programmed with information about a disease, using the accumulated knowledge of many specialists and textbooks.
A doctor examining a patient may then be guided by the information given by the computer in what to look for and which questions to ask the patient.
The information he gathers is fed into the computer.
It may suggest further questions, before finally providing a diagnosis.
This kind of procedure causes some people anxiety.
They feel it increases the gap in the personal relationship between doctor and patient.
On the other hand, it makes widely available knowledge and expertise which before belonged to only a small number of specialists, or which had to be found with difficulty in published material.

Can you remember this skill?
It is the skill of note-taking from lectures, seminars, speeches or talks.
Note-taking is a skill that you must use all the time.
This unit moves you to another aspect of listening-comprehension.
This is listening- comprehension for information retrieval.
The word retrieval is formed from the word ‘retrieve’ which means to receive.
One of the primary aims of academic pursuits is to receive information.
Indeed today, a lot of information is stored in what we call multi-media system (radio, television, video, internet, computer, etc.
), that it will amount to ignorance for any student like you not to tap them.
Information highways across the world are congested.
Only the wise like you can retrieve them.
This is why this unit and the next one are important to you.
Get ready to study the unit.
Have with you a pen, paper, recorder, the pre-recorded CD in your study pack and other resource materials needed.
I wish you success as you go through the unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • state the types of information to retrieve through listening- comprehension • retrieve the information through listening-comprehension.
45 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Types of Information to be Retrieved: Instructions, Directions and Facts Academic life is full of different kinds of information.
You spend most of your time acquiring these information types from respective social life and academic fields.
Basically, you can break the world of information into different segments.
Only the three general ones will be discussed in this section; these are- instructions, directions and facts.
(a) Instructions are given in form of commands, steps, procedures and process.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Insert your CD into the player and move to passage 4.1 titled ‘Safety Precautions’ and perform the activities below.
Fill the blanks with the correct safety precautions suggested in the passage.
• To prevent fire and electrical shock_______________________ in an excessive_______________________________________ • Do not________________________________________ at the back of the TV set; this can cause fire or other serious problems.
• Leave______________________________ for good ventilation • Do not__________________________________________ such as a bookshelf or built-in case.

• Do not______________________________ on the TV set, as liquid spilt on the TV set can cause serious problems.
46  • Unplug______________________________________________ __________ immediate the TV set begins to make unusual noises or give off smoke.
In the exercise above, you will notice that all the precautions are given in form of instructions.
On the CD, move to the beginning of the passage and cross-check your answers with the ones in the box.
Instructions in the safety precautions include the following.
INST RUCTIONS!
• Do not use wrong connections • Do not cover the ventilation holes • Leave an adequate open space behind the TV set • Do not place this set in confined spaces • Never remove the back of the cabinet • Do not place this television equipment on an unstable cart, stand or table, etc.
(Complete the rest using clues from playing back the cassette) When you hear sentences beginning with verbs such as do, do not, leave, position, use, etc., know that useful information in form of instructions is about to be given.
(b) Directions are also given in form of steps to be taken.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the pre-recorded passage 4.2, titled- The Small Town.
Fill in the blanks as you listen to the passage.
The small town is a home to about 5,000 inhabitants mainly of the Kikuyu tribe.
Situated about __________Nairobi, it is bounded by hills in________________, surrounded by lake in_________________and fertile green land _______________________________________ Rewind the cassette and cross-check answers as presented in this box.
The box is used to illustrate so form of directions.
There are many others.
• 40 kilometers North of the capital city Bounded by hill in the West • by lake in the East • fertile Greenland by the South 47 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Directions are vital information.
They place you in proper perspectives regarding: • location • situation • time • place You need directions in order to function effectively in real life.
Directions are also important in academic life.
Wrong directions may make a doctor kill his patient, an engineer construct a collapsed bridge and a teacher to mislead a child for life.
(c) Facts- these are regarded as true information, although there can be wrong facts.
Facts are also real events, not fable or untrue story.
You can take facts to mean a piece of information that is known to be true or real.
It also emphasises something that is true.
It is the basic detail or impression of a situation or issue.
Indeed, facts connote situations or events that really happen.
Since academic and social life work on facts, truth, accepted norms, and inventions, listening-comprehension regards facts as a primary source of information.
The most difficult task in listening-comprehension is to be able to distinguish facts from fables, facts from opinions, true from untrue facts.
Your views may differ from mine in what we regard as facts (true) and fables (untrue) and what we regard as facts and one's opinions which may not be the opinions of others.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE In this exercise, you will listen to the views of people regarding different issues of concern of Africans.
Listen to the series of passages titled Passage 4.3- ‘Fact and Fables’.
As you 1isten, isolate what you think are facts (true) from what you think are fables (or untrue facts).
Also classify some of the issues into opinions.
Use the chart below.

____________ ______________ Is your classification of the passages 4.3A-G the same as mine?
Let us cross-check, using the discourse below.
49 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I My facts may be your fables Rewind the CD to passages 4.3, A-G. Cross check your classification with mine.
Of course do not be surprised if your facts are my fables or opinions.
The way we view life may be different; but, on the whole, certain facts remain facts regardless of the age of the individual and field of specialisation.
That's probably why science and technology are more of facts than opinions.
For passages 4.3 A, I regard the first statement as fact.
That is: that formal education is the bedrock for development of every nation.
I regard, however, the second statement as an opinion of the speaker which may be true or untrue.
The word “almost” saves the statement from over-generalisation, which may turn the entire statement to an untrue one or an impression.
Almost every class of people in Ghana desires to see children reach the highest rungs of education ladder.
The third statement I regard as untrue.
The over-generalisation makes it untrue.
Unfortunately, the cost of education in Ghana has become so expensive that only the rich are able to send their children to school.
I think some children of the poor still manage to go to school in Ghana.
In passage 4.3B, I regard the first statement as a matter of opinion.
That is: … that we, Southern Sudanese are not ready to join the union now.
I think some of the Sudanese may want to join the union.
I also think that the last statement is, partially, a fact and, partially, an opinion.
… the struggle continues and victory is certain (A fact) (an opinion) 50  The first statement of passage 4.3D to me is an opinion: … media has given a blanket coverage to war involving the Western Allies and one of the poorest countries here on earth We may go on and on analysing all of the statements, but what we are trying to emphasise here is that as you listen, you should be capable of isolating facts from fables, facts from opinions, etc.
3.2 Listening for General Impression There are types of listening-comprehension that are not restricted to instruction, directions or facts.
They are listening-comprehension that demand getting the overall or general impression of what the speaker says.
Thus, in such a listening activity, you link all details to the topic and form your own overall impression.
This kind of listening is important in life.
It makes you capable of forming your own impression and not a listener who merely imitates copies or agrees uncritically with whatever is said, no matter the rubbish.
Look here!
I want to make you such a listener.
Let's practice this kind of listening comprehension activity: SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the next passage (passage 4.4) on your audio-recording.
The passage is titled ''Ready for the Next Shift?''
Many issues are raised regarding shifting cultivation (called slash and burn) in this passage.
After taking down notes on the passage, forms your own overall impression regarding: 1. efficiency or otherwise 2. disruptive effects 3. adoption or rejection 4. many faces On this mode of agriculture, do not merely copy out the views of the speaker.
Bring out your own impression based on the facts from the passage.
Continue with the rest of the discussion in this unit after you have completed exercise 4.4.
Do not study the discussion section until you have attempted this exercise.
51 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Now that you have completed exercise 4.4, let's discuss the passage and come out with our own impression.
Compare your own impression with the ones we come up with in the box.
Table 4.1 Ready for the Next Shift: General Impression Note from the lecture Over Impression The shifting agriculture Its Efficiency- depends • Fed many, continues on location, type of shift to feed many: 300 mill • Many faces Destructive- marginal • Farming sustainable in EFFECT in many Take down low densities areas, govt.

Positive 52  • Where it cannot maintain Pop:-agro forestry an alternative To gain general impression in listening activities, you should: • listen and understand the lecture very well • take down notes on the major points raised in the lecture • use the major points of the notes to form your own impression and • present your general impressions in clear terms.
Going through these steps, the following general impression regarding shifting agriculture emerged from the lecture in exercise 4.4.
(a) Efficiency of shifting cultivation depends on the type of shift and the location where the shift is taking place i.e.
whether low population or high population density areas.
(b) One cannot, uncritically, say that shifting cultivation is destructive.
There are other measures that lead to greater deforestation than shifting cultivation.
(c) The adoption or rejection of shifting cultivation is not conclusive: it is not a black and white distinction type of affair.
(d) Indeed many environmental variables such as low/high density, remote/urban, and types of shift: wholesale, partial or non-shift, make shifting cultivation to have many faces.
Are your answers to exercise 4.4 similar to mine?
If they are, I can rightly say you are capable of forming general impressions from listening.
More practice activities in the subsequent units will make you better in this listening skill.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit sees listening-comprehension as a tool for gathering general information.
You need this skill for progress in all academic pursuits.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has taught you the following: • how to retrieve information through listening-comprehension 53 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I • the types of information that you can retrieve through listening- comprehension; these include instructions, directions and facts • the way you can form general impression from various sets of information at your disposal.
The next unit will expose you to other types of information that you may be called upon to retrieve in your academic area.
Listen to the audio-recording of the passage titled ‘Pollution: Everything Must Go Somewhere’.
Use the passage to complete the table attached to your study text.
You may want to take down notes as you listen to the passage and use your notes to complete the table.
Passage 4.1 (To be recorded) Safety precautions- listen to these precautions and fill in the blanks in your study text.
1.
To prevent fire and electrical shock do not use wrong connections of wires or use the TV in an excessive manner.
2.
Do not cover the ventilation holes at the back of the TV set; this can cause fire or other serious problems.
3.
Leave an adequate open space behind the TV set for good ventilation.
4.
Do not place this TV set in confined spaces such as a bookshelf or built in case.
5.
Never remove the back of the cabinet as there is high voltage inside the TV set.
6.
Do not place the TV set on an unstable cart, stand or table.
The television equipment may fall, causing serious injury to a child or an adult and serious damage to the equipment.
Use only a cart or solid cabinet or the television table sold with the television equipment.
7.
Position the TV set out of direct sunlight and away from heat as high temperature can damage the cabinet.
8.
Never expose the wires or the tube of the TV set; this can cause fire, electrical shock or electrical failure.
9.
Do not pour water on the TV set, as liquid split on the TV set can cause serious problems.
10.
Unplug the main current leading to the TV set immediately the TV set begins to make unusual noises or gives off smoke.
54  Passage 4.2 The small town is home to about 5000 inhabitants, mainly of the Kikuyu tribe; situated about 40 kilometers north of the capital city, Nairobi.
It is bounded by hills in the West, surrounded by lake in the East and fertile green land by the South.
Passage 4.3 Facts, Fables and Opinions A Subsidised Education That formal education is the bedrock for the development of every nation cannot be over-emphasised.
Almost every class of people in Ghana desires to see their children reach the highest rungs of the education ladder.
Unfortunately, the cost of education in Ghana has become so expensive that only the rich are able to send their children to school.
Fees that parents pay each academic term, especially at the tertiary level, are higher than five months salary of a well-paid civil servant in Ghana.
The majority of the country's youth are therefore slouching on the streets, unable to go to school.
The frustration that many of the youth go through compels them to turn to crime.
If Ghana is going to catch up with the rest of the world, then the government must subsidise education for the people of Ghana.
Francis Sackitey, Aksombo, Ghana B African Union Can Wait Even though I admire the idea of an African union, given a boost recently by Libyan leader Color Gaddafi; I would also like to make it clear that we, southern Sudanese, are not ready to join this union now.
This is for the simple reason that we are still liberating ourselves from the various Arab Islamic Governments that have come and gone in Khartoum.
My last word of encouragement to our south Sudanese freedom fighters is that the struggle continues, because victory is certain.
Yokwe Silvano, Solwezi, Zambia 55 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I C Don’t Ignore Our War Once again, the media has given blanket coverage to a war involving the Western Allies and one of the poorest countries on earth.
But why is the coverage of war so selective?
The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been raging now for three years and has cost more than three million lives and yet we see or read very little about it.
The vast majority of the casualties in this war are civilians, and the Congo’s natural resources have been the subject of wholesale plunder by the various armies involved.
How long must the Congolese people suffer before the world finally comes to their assistance?
Three million dead- is surely significant enough to warrant action from the international community.
If the liberty and life of people in the US is worth defending, surely the same should apply for Congolese citizens.
Or is a Congolese life worth than a Western one?
John O’Shea, London, UK D Don't Blame the West Congolese leaders, I ask myself why my country- DRC is still in trouble since we became independent.
It is not Belgium which leads Congo now, but the Congolese.
Why do our leaders not have pity on our people?
Today, Congolese people are suffering badly.
Some are refugees, some are killed by disease and many are living miserable lives, while our leaders fill their stomachs and pockets.
Nobody, not even the government, thinks to build peace in Congo.
Everybody supports war on our country, so they can steal, while we are blinded by our problems.
Peace is what we need so we can build a new country.
Peace in the north, south, east and west of our land, DRC.
Peace, peace, peace.
Koko Mibeko, Kinshasa, DR Congo 56  E Mugabe's to Blame I am saddened by the brutal and senseless politics Robert Mugabe is mustering in Southern Africa.
First, Mugabe has disrupted the lives of white farmers who have continued to provide hard currency badly needed by the government.
Also, apart from using heavy tactics on his critics, he has failed to deliver promises made to his people since 1980: creating a climate of political tolerance, providing food and salvaging the economy from collapse.
Mugabe's latest crackdown on journalists is unacceptable and has only proven that he is a coward.
Zimbabweans must not yield to this latest threat of political terrorism.
It is shameful that for 20 years, the same political bullshit has continued unchallenged.
I wish Mugabe could just open his eyes wider so he can see the beauty of true democracy.
Abubakar Fofanah, Zimbabwe F Share the Blame It is disheartening and appalling to see events in Zimbabwe blown out of proportions by the Western media.
Contorted and skewed reports are being peddled by corporate media, especially the BBC.
The truth is that both major political parties in Zimbabwe are sponsoring political violence in order to meet their political ends.
It is surprising that the accusing finger is pointed solely at Zanu-PF and its supporters.
Little do the MDC rabble-rousers know that they are equally to blame for the country's ugly political landscape.
Rather than adopt a 'holier than thou' attitude, the MDC should wake up and smell the coffee and admit that they are responsible for fanning the flames of violence.
Cosmas Kudakwashe Chihwayi, Harare, Zimbabwe G More Football Teams I want to appeal to the Confederation of African football (CAF) to expand the Africa Nations Cup from a 16-nation tournament to a 24- 57 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I nation tournament.
In addition, the competition will be more relevant if staged every four years.
My proposal follows the recent decision of CAF to translate the Nations Cup into a qualifying tournament for the World Cup.
I feel that a 24- nation competition will offer more African countries the chance of playing in the World Cup.
In as much as the Nations Cup will now be used to select African representatives to the World Cup, there is therefore no need to play the Nations Cup in a non-World Cup year.
Let it take place every four years to make it more relevant and significant.

Passage 4.4 Shifting Cultivation Ready for the next Shift Is shifting cultivation (slash-and-burn) just inefficient, and destructive of the soil and local biodiversity?
Or does it also offer promising models?
For thousands of years, shifting cultivation has fed many, and it continues to support the livelihoods of 300 million people worldwide.
And that is a conservative estimate.
It can be defined in numerous ways; but it is best described as a practice whereby farmers clear a patch of forest or savanna, often using fire to release the nutrients for growing crops, and then alternative periods of cultivation with periods of fallow, during which the forest and soil fertility are allowed to be restored while the farmers shift to a new patch.
Besides having many names, milpa in Belize, Swidden on Niue or chitemene in Southern and Central Africa -this way of farming has many faces, which for a long time were not recognised but lumped together.
The general belief has been that in cases of low population densities and abundant forests, the periods of fallow were long enough to make this method of farming sustainable.
Steady population growth during the twentieth century was assumed to have increased the pressure on the forest unacceptably shortening (fallow periods.
This also led to) soil depletion and shrinking forests and forced farmers to move to more marginal lands.
Combine this with agriculture being modernised and intensified, and needing to meet growing demands for food, and it seems 58  not so strange that shifting cultivation was denounced as irrational and destructive.
This has, certainly, been true in part; but research in the 1990s found that it might be a pity to throw out the baby with the bath water.
Limiting their shifts The lessons were not slow in coming.
The alternatives to Slash-and- Burn Programme, coordinated by the International Centre for Research in Agro Forestry (ICRAF) was established in 1992 on the basis of assumptions similar to those described above.
They did not entirely hold true.
Case studies around the world indicated that although more than 15 million ha of tropical moist forests disappeared each year due to slash and burn.
Thus, cleared actual primary forest and an even smaller percentage eventually brought about a permanent treeless form of land use.
Increased deforestation is more likely to be the results of civil war, drought, market mechanisms and government policies than of slash-and -burn.
For instance, changes from command to private ownership of land is giving way to loggers, miners, plantation fanners and cattle ranchers, at the same time, literally, stopping the shifting cultivators in their tracks.
This applies less to central Africa, where deforestation in the forest fringes of the Congo basin is indeed largely caused by small- scale agriculture.
Yet there are other reasons for farmers to abandon shifting cultivation and to adopt a sedentary way of farming; the vicinity of market, schools and infrastructure also encourages people to settle.
Low yielding but stable No two farmers are the same, and shifting cultivation is not one uniform way of farming.
The Overseas Development Institute, a UK based research body, points out that indigenous communities, who often live in remote areas, have developed their own way of farming over generations and apply long fallow periods and complex farm management practices.
Each decision is carefully taken on the basis of sound agronomic criteria, resulting in low yielding but stable and sustainable food production.
On the other hand, there are the new settlers, often nearer to urban areas, who focus on short-term gains 59 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I from cash crops, use short fallow periods until the 'soil is depleted or just move on and on.
In between these two extremes, there is a continuum of farming men and women who shift part of their operations once in a while but return later.
In forests, which can sustain the existing population of shifting cultivations, the practice even contributes positively.
In these cases, it is crucial that the mosaic of patches in different stages of fallow, forest cover and cultivation does not get too fragmented and threatens any of natural trees.
Where the shifting cycle cannot be maintained, a conversion to sedentary agro-forestry cultivation systems can be an option too.
The central issue here is to maintain soil fertility more effectively.
In recent years a whole spectrum of viable alternatives to expensive chemical fertilities has become available, For instance, improved fallow techniques which enrich the natural fallow vegetation through the planting of nitrogen-fixing and multipurpose trees to improve soil productivity.
Applying manure from livestock, green manuring, mulching, planting cover crops for inter-cropping and alley farming are other examples.
Agro-forestry systems can be good alternatives too- such as multi-storey cultivation systems that allow natural tree species to rejuvenate alongside annual crops and economic trees.
It would not harm to lend an ear to the traditional shifting cultivations themselves or, as Paul Sillitoe of the University of Durham in England argues, to combine anthropological research with soil science.
His work explained how the Wola of Papua New Guinea has developed their own sustainable system while avoiding their traditionally long fallow periods.
They grow non- perennial crops semi-permanently by incorporating compost from grassy fallows into soil mounds, with sweet potato as a staple crop.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
POLUTION: Everything must go somewhere To maintain his standards of living; 20th century man employs technology to produce an enormous variety of goods and services.
Technology needs energy and matter; but energy and matter can neither be created nor destroyed, they can only transformed.
So, since everything must go somewhere, the transformations which are part of production processes cause pollution in some form or other- this is unavoidable.
So, talk of cleaning up the environment and pollution free cars, products or industries is a scientific impossibility.
60  For example, we can collect smoke dust and soot from factory chimneys by filters, but these solid wastes will then contaminate our water or soil.
Similarly, we can collect rubbish, remove solid wastes from sewages, but they must then be either burned (causing air pollution) and dumped into our rivers, lakes and oceans (water pollution) or deposited on the land (soil pollution and water pollution if they run away).
Another example is air pollution from cars.
We can reduce air pollution from petrol and diesel-propelled cars by changing over to electric cars.
Nonetheless, electric cars would need to have their batteries re-charged almost every night and so we should need to increase the number of power plants to generate the extra electricity required.
As well, an increase in the number of power plants that use fossil fuels would result in increased air pollution from sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxide and smoke, increased water pollution, from heat, and increased land pollution from mining.
We can shift to nuclear power, which is not dependent on fossil fuels; but nuclear power increases thermal pollution of the water, and adds the danger of releasing radioactive substances into the environment.
Now complete this table, using relevant facts from the passage, 'Pollution: everything must go somewhere'.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT i.

The training you received in that unit was more on the use of listening-comprehension for general purposes.
Instructions, directions and facts are common active listening activities in social and academic life.
This unit attempts to be more specific and more directed to academic purposes.
You will be exposed to listening comprehension as it relates to information retrieval from data, figures, diagrams, tables and charts.
You will agree with me that these listening- comprehension skills are more directed to learning in specific academic fields than the listening-comprehension activities treated in the previous unit.
As you go through the unit, you will need the pre-recorded CD in your study pack, pen, pencil and a notebook.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • retrieve data from listening comprehension passages • label diagrams accurately, using information from listening- comprehension passages • complete tables and charts using information from listening - comprehension passages.
63 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Listening-Comprehension for Data Information A lot of information is stored in data form.
Part of your concern in academic life is to retrieve the information for use.
In this section of the unit, you are introduced to how you can obtain information from data that are orally presented.
Data are a collection of information in a computer or a research document.
Huge data collected across period of time are also stored in form of data bank, quite different from the bank where money is kept.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE This exercise provides you with practice on how to retrieve data from listening-comprehension.
The passage 5.1 is going to be presented to you now in your pre-recorded cassette.
Wind the cassette to the passage titled ''Research on Parent-Child Separation''.
As you listen to the cassette, fill in the gaps with data obtainable from the passage.
The data have been deleted.
Complete the passage by filling in tile data.
Now fill in the blanks One landmark study revealed that 1.___________________________of children from divorced homes suffered an acute sense of shock 2.
_______________________________________reported feeling rejected and abandoned 3.______________________________never came to their children 4.
__________________after divorce.
5._________________________________________________of the boys and girls feared abandonment by remaining parent, and 6._____________________________ experienced yearning for absent parent with an intensity that researchers described as overwhelming.
Most significant, 7.________________________________ of children were not happy and dissatisfied 8._______________________________after the divorce than they had been at 9.______________________________________.
If you carried out the exercise very well, you would probably have observed that the data presented in the passage were mostly in years and percentages.
Rewind the cassette and cross-check your answers with the clues suggested in the box.
64  Clues to passage on research on parent-child-separation 1.
90% of children ... 2.
50% reported feeling of ... 3.
½ of the fathers ... 4.
3 years after divorce ... 5.
1/ of boys and girls ... 3 6.
66% experienced yearning ... 7.
37% of the children ... 8.
Five years after ... 9.
18 months ... Of course, data can also be presented in words or statements and not necessarily only numbers.
To retrieve data from lectures or topics presented orally, you should: • listen attentively • take down notes on the relevant data • relate the number (or %) scores, or the amount presented in the speech to what the data are all about: e.g.- 90% of children from → The data component of the Divorced homes sentence Suffered an acute sense of shock when the separation occurred… What the data is all about.
You must be able to relate the two.
It is only this relationship that can make the information retrieved from the data meaningful and usable.
3.2 Listening Comprehension and Information Retrieval from Figures Data can also be stored in form of figures.
Figures or scores are representations of information in form of drawings, paintings, sketches or other forms of illustrations.
It is possible for you to either label a figure as you listen.
You can also convert what you hear into pictorial or figure form.
Let’s practice this.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE In this exercise, you are to listen to passage 5.2 on score interval and fill in the blanks below.
As the passage is read in the cassette, a dash will be 65 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I given by the presenter.
After the dash the presenter will read on.
You should fill in the gaps with what you think the scores referred to in Figure 1 represent.
1.
Between the ranges 00-09 and 30-39, the percentage of boys falling within each range 13a.___________________________________________ of girls 2.
From the range, 40-99 upwards, that is up to at least 80-90, the b.__________________is the c.______________________higher proportion of d._________________________________than e._______________________falls within each range.
At level of f.______________________________score range.
The percentage is the same for both g._________________ ______and h.________________________________________ 3.
On the whole, i._________________of boys and j._________________of girls scored up to or above tolerable minimum level of 40%.
This shows that the overall performance of k.________________________________in the literacy test is superior to that of l.____________________________________ Now cross-check your answers with the ones read out by the presenter on the player by listening to the second reading.
The second reading of the passage titled score class interval fills up the gaps omitted in the first reading.
As you listen to the second time, cross-check your answers with the ones presented in the box below: 66  What are the skills that you need to retrieve information from figures?
Think about these.
Jot down points on a piece of paper.
Then cross- check the points with the ones presented below.
Do not look at my own points before you discover your own point.
Remember, in order to retrieve information from figures heard in lectures, tutorials or seminars: • you must listen attentively • you must pay particular attention to the scores, figures or data as presented in the speech • you should observe the figure carefully to trace such data, numbers, scores • you must think fast in order to be able to relate what is said with what is presented in the figure.
3.3 Listening-Comprehension and Labeling of Diagrams In the previous section, you practised how to retrieve information from figures.
A bar chart was given and you practised listening and observing the figure in form of a bar chart.
You were also able to interpret the figure using in-put from the listening-comprehension passage.
In this section, you are going to practise labeling a diagram with the information you acquire from listening to a description of the components of the diagram.
In order to be able to label the diagram, you should go through the following listening comprehension processes.
1.
Listen attentively to each part of the diagram; 2.
Pay attention to transitional words such as firstly, secondly, thirdly, etc., that may signal the arrival of the name of the component of the diagram to be labeled; 3.
Observe the diagram very closely to be able to locate the area where that is situated; and 4.
Then label the part of the diagram announced by the speaker.
By taking all these steps, you are directly, actively, taking part in the active listening-comprehension process.
Let's practise all the processes presented above.
Get ready.
You must follow all the instructions as stated in the exercise that follows.
67 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Label the diagram as you listen to the various parts of the diagram that will be described for you by the presenter of passage 5.3 in your pre- recorded CD.
The title of the passage is REMOTE CONTROL OF SHARP T.V.
SET.
You are allowed to listen to the passage once.
The presenter will pause a bit for you to label the diagram.
Fig.
2: Remote Control of Sharp T.V.
Set I think by now you have completed the above Exercise.
Have you been able to label all the parts of the Sharp remote control?
Remember, you are allowed to listen to the passage on the CD, only once.
Which of the parts were you unable to label?
Now let's discuss the exercise.
Of course, you should NOT turn to this discussion until you have completed the exercise.
Let me assure you, the reason for this exercise is not to test your knowledge of labeling diagrams, but to teach you the art of listening and labeling diagrams.
Our goal is for you to learn and not merely to score high marks.
What do you think the speaker did to call your attention to the different parts of the diagram?
The speaker used signals such as the first part, second, the third, the fourth part, and so on.
What other ways do you think a speaker can call attention to parts of a diagram?
Jot down some other ways in your notebook.
Cross-check these ways with the ones presented in the box below.
68  ALWAYS CALL ATTENTION TO PARTS OF DIAGRAM USING THE FOLLOWING.
• Directional Forms East, west, northern part, eastern part, middle part etc.
• Preposition At the right, by the left, on top of ...through the centre, under, over, etc • Graduation High-low-mid Tall-taller-tallest Short-shorter-shortest • Order Of importance: more important, Important, most important, Least important, less important, etc.
How accurate is your labeling of the parts?
Cross-check the labels you gave the remote control with the ones presented in the box below.
(1) STAND BY/ON button (2) CHANNEL SELECT buttons (3) FLASH BACK button (4) VOLUME UP/DOWN button (5) FUNCTION button (6) SYSTEM button (7) TV/VIDEO select button (8) CHANNEL UP/DOWN button (9) MUTE button (10) PICTURE button (11) TIMER button (12) CALL button (13) NORMAL button Fig.3 SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Rewind the CD to the passage on REMOTE CONTROL OF SHARP TV SET and provide answers to e following questions.

The buttons used for adjustments are______________________ and ________________________________________________ 69 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I v. The buttons related to sound system are_________________and ___________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ Check correct answers at the end of the unit 3.4 Listening-Comprehension and Information Retrieval from Tables and Charts Just as you can store information you are listening to in the form of diagrams, so also can it be stored in form of tables and charts.
As you listen to speech or talk that can be stored in form of a table or chart, you should store them in these forms.
They make reading and understanding very vivid.
The information presented in three pages, for example, may be stored in a simple chart of table.
Again, the information may have been stored in a table or chart and you may be required to retrieve it as you listen to the speaker.
Whichever way, information retrieval through tables and charts is an academic exercise that you may be called upon to do in your various fields.
In this section, you will practise how to store information recorded through listening-comprehension into a table and chart.
For our convenience, a distinction is made between a table and a chart here.
A chart suggests an illustration that gives clear information about something those changes over a period of time e.g.
weather chart, temperature chart, sales chart, and so on.
A table is regarded here as a list of facts or figures arranged in an ordered way, especially in columns e.g.
a table showing how prices and earnings have increased since, 1945.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE In this exercise, you will listen to a pre-recorded talk on ‘WHICH WAY NIGERIA’-passage 5.4.
As you listen to this interesting talk, complete the chart below.
You are allowed to listen to the talk only once.
Are you ready?
Start by completing this chart.
70  By 1950, South Korea______________ Today South Korea_________ _______________________________ ________________________ _______________________________ ________________________ In 1965, Nigeria GDP______________ Indonesia GDP____________ _______________________________ ________________________ _______________________________ Malaysia GDP_____________ _______________________________ ________________________ 30 years later- Nigeria GDP__________ Indonesia GDP____________ _______________________________ _________________________ _______________________________ _________________________ _______________________________ _________________________ _______________________________ Malaysia GDP_____________ _______________________________ ________________________ _______________________________ ________________________ Fig.
4 Once you have completed the chart, rewind the CD back to the beginning of the talk titled WHICH WAY NIGERIA and listen to it again.
As you listen, complete the table below: Table 1: Life Expectancies of Countries Compared Countries Life Expectancy Rate Nigeria _________________________________________ Ghana _________________________________________ Indonesia _________________________________________ Malaysia _________________________________________ Check answers at the end of the unit.
Have you been able to complete the chart and the table?
If you are able to, you will see that the information presented in the talk was not only compressed into manageable unit, but also made more vivid.
4.0 CONCLUSION The attempt in this unit is to stress the importance of information and the way information can be received.
Data, figure diagram, charts and tables are, no doubt, very valuable means of storing information for academic purposes.
Your ability to retrieve them for profitable academic work is the concern of the unit.
71 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 5.0 SUMMARY This unit has taught you how to retrieve information from: • data through listening attentively and relating the data with what the data are all about • figures through paying special attention to the figures or data presented and tracing such data on the figure • diagrams through careful observation of the diagram as the speaker speaks • charts and tables through filling of the charts and tables as you listen.
You should practice all these in your academic field.
Passages Passage 5.1 It’s now known that emotional development in children is directly related to the presence of warm, nurturing, sustained and continuous interaction with both parents.
Anything that interferes with the vital relationship with either mother or father can have lasting consequences for the child.
One landmark study revealed that 90 per cent of children from divorced homes suffered an acute sense of shock when the separation occurred, including profound grieving and irrational fears.
Fifty per cent reported feeling rejected and abandoned, and indeed, half of the fathers never came to see their children three years after the divorce.
One-third of the boys and girls feared abandonment by the remaining parent, and 65 per cent experienced yearning for the absent parent with an intensity that researchers described as overwhelming.
Most significantly, 37 percent of the children were more unhappy and dissatisfied five years after the divorce than they had been at 18 months.
In other words, time did not heal their wounds.
That’s the real meaning of divorce.
It is certainly what I think about, with righteous indignation, when I see infidelity and marital deceit portrayed on television as some kind of exciting game for two.
It is also why Scripture says: ‘I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel’ (Malachi 2: 16).
The bottom line is that you are right to consider the welfare of your children in deciding whether to seek a divorce.
As empty as the marital 72  relationship continues to be for you, it is likely that your kids will be far better if you choose to stick it out.

You need to know these parts so as to be able to operate the remote control of your sharp TV set.
Listen attentively to me as I discuss the parts of the remote control.
In Unit 5, you have the diagram of the remote control.
Fill in the parts as I list and describe them.
I will pause, a bit, to allow you to label the diagram.
Let's start.
The first part to be discussed is STAND BY/ON button.
This is to switch on the TV.
With a finger press, switch on the TV.
Second is CHANNEL SELECT buttons.
The buttons are listed.
The third is FLASH BACK button which you can use to return to the previously viewed channel.
The fourth component is the VOLUME UP/DOWN 73 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I buttons.
These are used to adjust the volume.
They are also used to control FUNCTION, TIMER, PICTURE, COLOUR and SOUND system.
Component number five is called FUNCTION button for fine tuning channel skip, blue back, OSD language and white temp.
The sixth component suggests SYSTEM button which is colour system and sound system.
Seventh is the TV/VIDEO select button, while the eighth is channel UP/DOWN button to select the channel.
These buttons are also used to control the OSD language.
The ninth is MUTE button, when pressed the first time, it mutes the sound and pressed again, it restores the sound to the previous level.
PICTURE button is number ten.
This is for adjusting the picture quality brought by the TV set.
For component eleven, the TIME button is used for reminder, OFF timer and ON timer.
The twelfth button is CALL button used to display the different current settings on the screen.
The last, of course, is NORMAL button which is number thirteen.
It normalises things.
I think you now know the parts of your sharp remote control.
If you do, be ready to use all these parts for the pleasant viewing of programmes on your TV set.
What a wonderful remote control you have!
Second Reading Now the same passage on ‘Score: Class Interval’ will be read to you the second time.
This time the gaps that were not filled in the previous reading will be filled as the passage is read.
Score: Class Interval The distribution of the score ranges as shown-in Figure 1, is very interesting.
Between the ranges 00-99 and 30-39, the percentage of boys falling within each range is slightly higher than that of girls.
From the range, 40-49 upwards, that is, up to at least 80-89, the reverse is the case: a higher proportion of girls than boys fall within each range.
At the level of 90-100 score range, the percentage is the same (3) for both boys and girls.
On the whole, 16.6% of boys and] 8.4% of girls scored up to or above the tolerable minimum level of 40%.
This shows that the overall performance of girls in the literacy test is superior to that of boys.
It will be necessary at this point to give some more detailed analysis of the performance of the pupils nation-wide and across the states, taking the various sub-groups of the same identified above into consideration.
74  Cross-check the gaps you filled in your booklet with the ones filled here.
You can always rewind the cassette if you are unable to cross-check the gaps filled.
Passage 5.4 Listen to this passage titled WHICH WAY NIGERIA and complete the tasks in Exercise 5.5.
In this exercise, you are expected to fill in gaps on the chart.
Which Way Nigeria Nigeria, with an estimated 1996 population of 110 mil1ion people, is the most populous nation in Africa and the eleventh in the world.
The country is richly endowed with vast human and material resources, including large reserves of oil and gas.
Yet, after 37 years of independence, she is still ‘sucking her thumb’ in the economic sense, like a baby.
There seems to be widespread acceptance of this notion; hence, the Head of State charged the Vision 2010 Committee at the start of its work: Constructively analyse why after more than 36 years of political independence, our development as a nation in many spheres has been relatively unimpressive, especially, in relation to our potential.
Way back in 1950, South Korea was virtually at the same level of economic development with Nigeria; but today, South Korea- proud of her meteoric rise from the ashes of the 1950 -53 Korean War, has risen to be the world's eleventh largest economy.
In 1965, Nigeria's GDP was $5.8 bil1ion, compared with $3.8 billion for Indonesia and $3.1 billion for Malaysia.
Thirty years later, in 1995, Nigeria's GDP had increased to $26.8 bil1ion (3.6 per cent increase).
Malaysia to $85 bil1ion (27 per cent increase) and Indonesia's to $198 billion (52 per cent increase).
On the average, Nigerians have a life expectancy of 52 years, compared to 59 years for Ghanaians, 64 years for Indonesians and 71 years for Malaysians.
The implication of these statistics is that these countries have left Nigeria far behind in terms of productivity, income generation and general economic development.

The three functions of IFC are______________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ 2.
The functions on IDA are_________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ 3.
Why is IFC always referred to separately when the World bank is described?_______________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ The World Bank Family The term ‘World Bank’ as it is commonly used refers to three closely linked institutions- the International Bank for Reconstruction and 76  Development (IBRD) and IDA, which shared the same staff, plus the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
The IBRD, the oldest of the three, was established in 1945 under the Bretton Woods agreement with the principal objective of channeling US assistance to war ravaged Europe.
By degrees, it shifted its attention to the Third World states as decolonisation increased their number, and as Europe's recovery got under way.
The IFC was created in 1958, with a separate operational staff, to assist private sector projects.
It can provide loans and/or equity and aims to act as a catalyst, encouraging other private sector finance to the projects that it supports.
Both the IBRD land the IFC raise the bulk of their money from the capital markets, and hence - lend on quasi-commercial terms to acceptable credit worth countries and projects; this rule out lending to very poor countries.
IDA was created in 1960 to fill this gap; its funds are provided by supporting governments from their aid budgets, enabling it to provide soft credits (50 years repayments including 10 year’s grace, with no interest, but only a small service charge).
But, while the terms are softer, the criteria used for appraising the viability of projects are intended to be the same as those applied by IBRD.
Since they share the same staff and methods, the IBRD and IDA are often referred to, jointly, as 'The World Bank'; while IFC is a separate entity.

3.2 Determining the Main Idea 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION The training so far, in the previous module, especially in the last unit has been centered on listening for retrieval of general and specific information.
Information retrieval is important.
But another important aspect of listening-comprehension is to be able to give importance to the different layers of information you received while listening.
Obviously, not all information is of equal importance.
Some pieces of information are more important than others.
In this unit, you will learn how to determine main points or main ideas from speeches, lectures and talks.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • state many reasons why you listen to get the main idea • show how to determine main ideas from what you listen to • practise the art of identifying main ideas from passages listened to.
78  3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Why Listen for the Main Idea?
Perhaps the most important thing in listening-comprehension is for you to be able to determine the main idea of a lecture, seminar or tutorial.
You need the main idea to be able to determine the major points to be put down as notes.
You also need the main idea to be able to know what to study during examinations.
If you have the main idea of a lecture or seminar, you can easily develop it during an examination or assignment.
A common mistake is for you to want to learn everything, both facts and fables, main ideas and supporting details that you yourself can provide during examinations.
The end-product is spending more time, sleepless hours, on study activity than necessary.
This, eventually, leads to breakdown, diminishing returns and utter confusion during the examination itself.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Which of the following is not an important reason for you to be able to determine the main idea in a listening comprehension activity?
Tick () if it is the purpose of determining the main idea, and put (x) if it is not the purpose of determining the main idea.
1.
To be able to eliminate minor points  2.
For note-taking activity  3.
To encourage sleepless nights  4.
To cheat during examinations  5.
To isolate facts from fables  6.
To be able to complete charts, figures and tables  7.
To gain overall impression  8.
To promote diminishing returns  Let's discuss it!
Do not start reading this discussion until you have finished carrying out the activity in the above self-assessment exercise.
If you have completed the exercise, then we can go on to discuss the answer to the activity.
Do you think we need the main idea to be able to eliminate minor points?
Of course, yes, we do.
If we know the main idea of any lecture, surely we will be able to eliminate minor details that are used to develop the main idea.
As we have said earlier on, main ideas are what we put down in form of notes.
Now, note that it will be foolish for you to think 79 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I that the knowledge of main ideas will assist you to cheat during examinations.
Rather than assisting you to cheat, I think it will assist you to perform better.
Main ideas are facts/statements.
Supporting details are used to develop the main ideas; they are not necessarily to be regarded as tables.
As discussed in unit 5, (module 1) we need main ideas to be able to complete charts, figures and tables.
In most cases, these visual representatives convey main ideas of what is listened to.
From the knowledge of the main ideas, you get the overall impression of the lecture or seminar.
Remember, if you are fully armed with the main ideas/concepts of your course, you have less to read and thus reduce rather than promote diminishing returns from study.
3.2 Determining the Main Idea There are many ways speakers or lecturers can convey main ideas.
We will bring out only a few of them in this section.
As you practice to recognise main ideas from lectures, more ways will become clear to you.
1.
By announcing the main idea in the title of the talk or lecture In some cases, the title of the talk or lecture may give you the main idea of what you will hear in the lecture or talk.
This is not always so.
A speaker may want to captivate you and take you by surprise by not giving you the main idea of the lecture in the title.
In fact, the title of the lecture may, at first, seem not relevant to the lecture.
It is only when you start following the lecture that the relevance of the title to the lecture may start to unfold to you.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Listen to the audio-recording of the passage titled ‘Jennifer's Withdrawal from School was Avoided’.
As you listen to that lecture which is passage 1.1 on your CD, write down words and expressions in the lecture which link the title of the lecture to the main idea of the lecture.
State, at the end of the exercise, whether or not the main idea of the lecture relates to the title of the lecture.
Do not read the discussions that follow until you have completed this exercise.
Now that you have completed the exercise; let's turn to the discussion of the passage.
The title of the lecture is ‘Jennifer's Withdrawal from School was Avoided’.
Let's look for words and expressions that link the lecture to the title.
Study this in the box overleaf.
As you do so, rewind the CD to the passage and cross-check words and expressions you wrote with the ones in the box.
80  JENNIFER’S WITHDRAWAL FROM SCHOOL WAS AVOIDED 1.
Jennifer’s withdrawal from School All of these • I’m pulling Jennifer out pointing to • Announcement stunned me Jennifer’s • Concern wanting to • Withdrawal routine withdraw!
• School too hard • See no option All these refer 2.
Withdrawal avoided to how the • Removing Jennifer not the option withdrawal • Suggested we meet Jennifer from school and her teacher was avoided • Develop strategies • Help Jennifer succeed • Jennifer excelling Figure 1.1 As you go through the recording and my analysis in the box, you will agree with me that the title of the lecture agrees with the content of the lecture.
Thus, you can suggest that the title of the lecture signals the main idea of the lecture.
2.
By calling attention to the main idea in the body of the lecture or talk The speaker may, deliberately, call attention to main ideas in the body of the lecture or talk.
You may discover that the speaker continues to use words or expressions such as “let's go to the point”; “the crucial issue we are grappling with is ...”; “the most important point is” ;“...the first point is…”; “... the second is...”; “lastly... finally”, etc.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Turn to your pre-recorded CD.
Go to the lecture titled ‘Banking for Nigerian Markets’.
This is passage 1.2 on the CD.
As you listen to this recording, write down the words or expressions used by the speaker to call your attention to the main ideas of the lecture.
Also state the main ideas put forward by the speaker.
The lecturer has been instructed to slow down so that if you cannot do so by reading the lecture the first time, you are allowed to rewind the CD and listen 81 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I to the lecture the second time.
Do not turn to the discussion until you have completed the exercise.
Have you finished?
If you have completed the activity, you can now turn to the discussion of the activity as presented below.
The discussion will not profit you much, until you actually do the exercise well.
Listen to the lecture again as you study this discussion.
Let us discuss it.
You probably observed, as you go through the exercise, that the speaker provided words and expressions to lead the listener to the main idea of the lecture.
Some of these are given below.
What accounts for this rather distressing state of our nation is the following set of shortcomings- First- we do not believe in the existence and necessity for national theory and practice of broad-based economic power.
Second- we refuse to acknowledge the historical and contemporary fact that our ...democracy and good governance ...have always been thrown out of gear by western ...financial institutions.
Third and last: ...blind to the fact that...
If we go by the title of this lecture, which is ‘Banking for Nigerian markets’, we will be misled.
This is because banking is not directly referred to in the lecture.
3.
By constant repetition Some speakers structure their talks or lectures in such a way as to give room for repetition of the main points in various ways.
Instead of consciously or directly drawing attention to the main ideas through pointers-like firstly, secondly, etc., they do so by means of repetition.
They say it once and say it again to drive home the major point.
You should know that points that are stressed or emphasised are relevant points.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Wind your CD to the lecture titled ‘Arewa House I Thank You’ (passage 1.3), which is an extract from the lecture delivered by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo at the Arewa House in February, 1994.
As you listen to this lecture, state the main idea of the lecture in one sentence.
Suggest, with evidence, the way the main idea is brought out in the 82  lecture.
You may wish to listen to the lecture two or three times, if you cannot bring out the main idea at once.
After you have completed this exercise, turn to the discussions that follow.
Do not turn to the discussion until you have completed the exercise.
Let’s discuss it now that you have completed your own exercise.
In order to tackle this exercise, I took down notes on the lecture, as done in the box below,.
Fig.1.2 If we go through the lecture carefully, we will notice that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo referred to responding, speaking, debate, say yes or no, to suggest the need to speak out or dialogue on the state of the nation for a way forward six (6) times.
These six times are circled or in bold letters in the notes I formed on the lecture.
The way this concept is repeated, no doubt, suggests to us that the main idea of the talk is the superiority of dialogue, speaking out our minds on the state of the Nation, over keeping silent!
It is a truism that dialoguing, no matter how unpleasant sanitise the nation, more than keeping quiet, thus making violence possible.
4.
By identifying the speech patterns of the speaker This is the last point we are going to discuss regarding the way you can determine the main idea of a lecture or a talk.
As you listen to a speech, it is possible to start to observe the pattern the speaker is following.
Different speakers have different speech patterns.
The most common 83 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I one however, is for the main point to be given first, in form of a topic sentence, and be followed by supporting sentences which act as examples, illustrations and expansion of the topic sentence.
In some lectures or talks, the speaker may prefer to start with illustrations and supportive details and gradually move to the main point.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Turn to the CD in your study pack.
Go to passage 1.4 titled NOT ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE CREATED EQUAL.
As you listen to the lecture, put down the main ideas and insert two or more supporting details under each of the main ideas identified.
Use your notes to determine the pattern used by the speaker to bring out the main ideas of the lecture.
You may listen to the lecture as many times you want.
Cross-check your answer with mine after you have completed the exercise.
Do not turn to the discussion until you have attempted the exercise.
Remember, the exercise is not meant to test you.
but to teach you.
The more you try, the better you are.
You learn by doing.
Have you completed the exercise?
If you have done so, you are ready to study the discussion with me as we go along in the next section.
What do your notes look like?
Are they comparable to mine?
Let's discuss the exercise together.
Can you find any main idea in the first paragraph of the lecture?
No main idea of the lecture there.
In fact, the first paragraphs are presented as stories to form the background to the real issue at stake.
The story of Jennifer is meant to be an illustration, a preamble to the real issue, which is the inequality in the goals, philosophy, and beliefs of Charter schools.
Cross-check your notes with the ones I developed in the box.
84  NOT ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE CREATED EQUAL Jennifer’s Story • Pulling J. out of school-not a usual parental concern-most discipline • Removing J. from school not the option • J., the teacher, parents and principal developed strategies to help J.
• Parents withdraw children not so much because of academic demands but agreements over schools central beliefs or practices.
Autonomy of Charter Schools • Autonomy- common reason for founding charter schools • Have other diverse aspects they emphasise • Philosophy varies e.g.
back to basics, experimental education, education for special needs, etc Practices Vary • 26 page narrative describing child's progress instead of a one - page summary with letter grades.
Know What you Believe • Select charter schools that agree with what you believe Starting Point • With the brochure which relates literature of the school • Visit the school Fig.1.3 Going by the notes in the box above, it is possible to identify the way the lecturer brought out the major ideas of the lecture.
• By giving the main idea at the beginning of the paragraph: e.g.
Beyond a charter school's central philosophy or mission, practices also vary.
• By giving the main idea at the middle of the paragraph: e.g.
Because the most common reason for founding a charter school is to gain autonomy... these schools are diverse as they are numerous.
85 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Although not done in this lecture, the main idea may be given at the end of the paragraph.
4.0 CONCLUSION I know you have no doubt in your mind after the completion of this unit that listening for the main idea is an important activity that can assist you in your academic life.
The more major points or ideas you are able to gather from lectures, the more focused you become in your study.
The more irrelevances or rubbish you put down as notes from lectures or talks, the more tedious work you give yourself to do during study and revision time.
Always insist on the main ideas or major points.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has taught you the following: • why you must listen for the main idea • how you can determine main ideas of a lecture or talk by noticing the way the speaker: • announces the main idea • draws attention to the main idea • repeats the main idea directly or indirectly and • introduces the main idea through different speech patterns.
You need to start from this day on to look for main ideas of any talk, speech or lecture you hear.
Passage 1.1 Listen to this passage on “Jennifer's Withdrawal from School was Avoided” and state words and expressions, which make the title to be related to the main idea of the lecture.
Jennifer's Withdrawal from School was Avoided “I want to let you know that I am pulling Jennifer out of the academy”.
Mrs Nelson's announcement stunned me.
As a Charter School principal, I routinely dealt with parental concerns, most of them about discipline or grading policies.
Withdrawal was not routine, however.
I asked why they were taking this step.
“This school is simply too hard for her,” Mrs Nelson said.
“Jennifer is reading books she barely understands, and the pace of the class is too 86  fast.
Because you only have one class in her grade, I don't see any options.” It was true that we expected much of our students.
Academic rigour was central to the school's mission.
It also was true that our small size meant students had only one choice in any given subject.
But removing Jennifer was not the only option.
I asked Mrs. Nelson a few more questions and suggested we meet with Jennifer and her teacher to develop strategies to help Jennifer succeed.
Through this process, Jennifer began excelling and stayed in the academy.

Passage 1.2 As you listen to this passage write down words and expressions that the speaker used to draw attention to the main idea on the passage, also state the main idea of the passage.
Banking for Nigerian Markets We, as Nigerians, have not made much progress so far in the integrated, market-oriented and democratic reconstruction of our post-colonial economy.
What accounts for this rather distressing state of our nation is the following set of shortcomings in our received theory and practice of socio-economic policy.
First, we do not believe in the existence of, and necessity for, a national theory and practice of group and individual access to, and enjoyment of, broad-based economic power.
Second, we refuse, in the main, to acknowledge the historical and contemporary fact that our early and continued attempts at democracy and good governance in Nigeria have always been thrown out of gear by the persisting stranglehold which Western financial, or forex power has on the local availability and distribution of economic opportunities.
Third and last, we remain curiously blind to the fact that an integrated, market oriented and democratic Nigeria requires that we realign, in our own interest, the structures of our external economic relations to the convertible currency West and to the non-convertible currency South.
For this enables us to provide ourselves with the necessary and sufficient conditions for establishing an integrated, market-oriented and democratic polity within Nigeria.
87 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Passage 1.3 Listen to this speech by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo.
As you listen to the speech, state the main idea- in just one sentence.
Arewa I Thank you Let me thank Arewa House for giving me the opportunity to be here in Kaduna to address this august gathering.
For those of us who started our military life here as junior officers, Kaduna holds a nostalgic and enchanting allure.
I really mean it when I say I am happy to be back.
When I received the invitation to give a keynote address at this meeting- the theme of which is 'The State of the Nation: Which Way Forward?'
I could not immediately say yes or no.
For one thing, I asked myself if the state of the nation was clear.
For another, I was not sure what purpose such an address would serve, especially when I had communicated my thoughts on that very theme to the new administration at its own request on 18 November 1993.
In the end I decided to err on the side of speaking, rather than not speaking; believing as I have always done that responsive governments and societies can be better chastised and sanitised through speech, debate, discussion and dialogue- no matter how unpleasant, than through violence.
Of course, it is a truism that those who make debate, discussion and dialogue impossible or those who are not responsive to them make violence probable.
Passage 1.4 Not all Charter Schools are Created Equal “I want to let you know that I am pulling Jennifer out of the academy.” Mrs Nelson's announcement stunned me.
As a Charter school principal, I routinely dealt with parental concerns, most of them about discipline or grading policies.
Withdrawal was not routine.
However, I asked why they were taking this step.
“This school is simply too hard for her”, Mrs Nelson said.
“Jennifer is reading books she barely understands, and the pace of the class is too fast.
Because you only have one class in her grade, I don't see any options.” It was true that we expected much of our students.
Academic rigour was central to the school's mission.
It also was true that our small size meant students had only one choice in any given subject.
88  But removing Jennifer was not the only option.
I asked Mrs. Nelson a few more questions and suggested we meet with Jennifer and her teacher to develop strategies to help Jennifer succeed.
Through this process, Jennifer began excelling and stayed in the academy.
Unfortunately, not all situations end so happily.
I've seen other parents withdraw their children, not so much because of academic demands but more because of disagreements over the school's central beliefs or practices.
That is why I encourage parents to, carefully, investigate a Charter school-to investigate any education option, in fact- before enrolling their children.
More than 1,100 Charter schools now operate in 26 states; because the most common reason for founding a Charter school is to gain autonomy in pursuing an educational vision, these schools are as diverse as they are numerous.
Charter schools may be opened to emphasise back-to- basics or experiential education; to teach students with special needs or who are considered high-risk; or to specialise in college-prep, vocational, environmental, arts, business or science curricula.
Beyond a charter school's central philosophy or mission, practices also vary.
Imagine your surprise at report-card time when you receive a grade less, 26-page narrative describing your child's progress when you expected a one-page summary with letter grades!
With such an array of missions and methods, parents must take time to discover the philosophies and practices that guide any school their children might attend.
Before you investigate, however, you must know what you believe and what you want for your child's education.
Many a charter school will talk about its successes, but its methods may not be consistent with your beliefs or goals.
A good place to start is with a school's own literature, which most charter schools produce.
A brochure could tell you enough about a school to remove it from consideration.
Don't stop there.
If you are seriously considering a school, make an appointment to visit.
Observe a class and tour as much of the school as possible, since your child may attend there several years.
As you evaluate a Charter school, watch for these elements.

89 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT (Worksheet for Students) Listen to the passage titled ‘Computer Revolution’ and form notes as you listen to the lecture.
Use your notes to fill in the gaps below.
The main idea of the passage is i.
____________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ ii.
The supporting details are_______________________________ a.
_________________________________________________ b.
__________________________________________________ c.___________________________________________________ d.___________________________________________________ e.___________________________________________________ g. _________________________________________________ h. __________________________________________________ I.
___________________________________________________ J.
___________________________________________________ k. __________________________________________________ You are to give Ten (10) supporting details.
Computer Revolution Computers are revolutionalising the work of those who work with words.
Up to now, in the production of newspapers, a reporter has typed his story, known as copy.
This has then been passed on to the editor.
After being edited, the story would, often, have to be retyped and then sent to the typesetter.
Prints would then be made of individual articles and these, together with advertisements, would be assembled manually to form a complete page.
This would then be the basis for the making of the printing plate.
In computerised production, the reporter types his copy directly into the computer, which shows it on a visual display unit, or VDU.
This is like a television screen.
The editor accesses this story on his own VDU and changes it by typing instructions into the computer.
Various articles are then arranged into columns according to a programme run by the computer.
The page layout is done on another VDU and the page passes automatically to the printing stage.
For the office typist, things are changing too.
They can now use word processors-small computer, similar to those used by the reporters.
If you make a mistake, you don't have to paint out the error before retyping.
You just backspace and type the correct letter.
The change is made on 90  the VDU, automatically.
It is also possible to insert material-single words, lines or complete paragraphs.
The computer itself reorganises the layout of the whole text to accommodate the changes.
It can also store complete texts and organise the paragraphs as needed.
This is especially helpful in legal work, where many standard paragraphs are used.
When the text is completed, the typing of the page is again handled by the computer.
You will realise from hearing about these uses of computers that there are big changes in the kind of work done by many people and, more importantly, in the number of people needed to do the work.
The passage deals with the general problem of computers and employment.

This unit goes to probably the highest order of listening -comprehension activity.
That's to be able to interpret, evaluate and critically analyse speaker's viewpoints while listening.
Listening for interpretation and critical evaluation is the type of skills that can enable you to be the real master of what the speaker is saying.
This type of listening skills is perhaps the most difficult.
Since it is the highest order of listening activity, only a few students do this.
I want you to attain this level.
In your academic life, you should be capable of interpreting and evaluating viewpoints of speakers.
This is the only way you can grow, academically.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • critically evaluate what you listen to • interpret speakers’ view-points • identify words and expression associated with listening for critical analysis, evaluation and interpretation • use the steps suggested to undertake listening for critical analysis, evaluation and interpretation.
92  3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Listening for Interpretation and Critical Analysis One of the high-order skills you need to perform creditably well while listening to a talk, a speech or a lecture is the skill or ability of interpreting the speaker's viewpoints.
Interpretation is not as simple as finding or locating general or specific information while listening.
Interpretation involves deriving meaning out of what is said.
This can be at two major levels- giving the speech the surface and the deeper meaning.
Interpretation involves inferencing, thinking between and beyond what has been said.
Giving utterance, meaning and making deductions or observations out of the meaning, as well as establishing trends or recurring patterns out of the observations, are also some of the processes involved in interpretation.
Critical analysis involves looking at the merits and demerits (pros and cons), of what is heard.
It is the art of weighing or assessing each point, discretely, to determine strengths and weaknesses.
Critical analysis and evaluation involve passing value judgements, making generalisations and drawing conclusions after careful analysis.
Listening-comprehension should go beyond comprehending what is heard.
It should address every aspect of what is heard critically.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Tick () each of the situations you will hear in the audio recording (passage 2.1 below) if it is critical; put (x) if the situation is evaluative, and put (o) if it is interpretative.
You can listen to the extracts more than once, if you need to do so.
In order to evaluate the extracts as stated above, use the chart designed overleaf.
Passage Critical Evaluative Interpretative A    B    C    D    E    F    G    Have you completed the exercise?
Go back to the audio recording, if you have not completed the assignment and listen to the seven passages again.
Do not turn to the discussion following, until you have completed the exercises.
93 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Now that you have completed the exercise, let's discuss the answers.
Depending on the way you view the passages, your reaction may be different from mine in some cases.
On the whole, we should all agree on many of the passages.
I think passage A is critical of the Congolese peace talks.
This is because of the value judgements (good idea) used.
The writer is indirectly condemning the peace talk.
Congolese do not want more talking from their leaders- they want peace.
Passage B starts from the angle of a question to determine whether peace is what is wanted or war.
The judgement of the speaker is that peace is still far-fetched.
I think the passage is evaluative.
Passage C seems to be critiquing armed purchase and the clearance given to the government's wrong doings by the commission of inquiry.
Thus, the passage is critical.
Passage D is an evaluation of the aftermath of the election exercise.
The speaker's assessment looks positive.
Passage E looks like an evaluation of the work of Nissan Maxima.
The assessment is obviously positive.
Nothing bad is found in the Nissan.
Passage F gathers different viewpoints of people regarding Oputa Panel and gives the speaker's personal interpretation.
It is not wrong to say the passage is an evaluation of Oputa Panel.
You will also be correct if you say it is the interpretation of people's views regarding Oputa Panel.
Passage G- I think it is a critique of the attempt of some people to give a clear-cut definition of some parts of the world as civilised and other parts, uncivilised.
The speaker is trying to ironically say that there is not such a thing as a clear-cut definition of civilised and uncivilised world.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Spot the given passages again on the CD.
Listen to the audio recording once more.
As you listen, write down words and expressions, used by the speakers to suggest critical analysis, evaluation and interpretation.
Turn to the second part of our discussion after you have completed this exercise.
94  3.2 Words and Expressions Associated with Critical Analysis, Evaluation and Interpretation It is true that most words and expression can be twisted to meet the demands to critical analysis, evaluation and interpretation of issues, concepts or situations.
However, you will agree with me after going through the second exercise that some words or expressions are more closely related to these language tasks.
Compare your responses to the first exercise with my own responses to the same exercise in the following box.
Words And Expressions Associated with: critical analysis • Never seemed like • Keen learner • A good idea • would be... Do not want most • They want interested... • Obvious • starts... ends • Pose a challenge • Was cleared • Unnecessary • Not entirely cleared Jokingly called evaluation • Aftermath • Turn out to be ... • Quiet, orderly • Inspire comfort • Smoothness • Dedicated to relaxation • Advanced safety features • Inspire millions.
.. interpretation • Some ...called it • While others said • Hardly any ... • Indifferent You need to recognise these words and expressions while listening to a talk or lecture.
You also need to be able to use some of the critical, analytical, evaluative and interpretative words when responding to issues, items or concepts you listened to.
95 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 3.3 Suggested Steps to Follow in Listening for Interpretation and Critical Analysis In this section, I’ll try to suggest some steps you can follow in attempting to listen for interpretation and critical analysis.
You should not regard these steps as the gospel truth.
They are subject to modifications.
In fact, they are the steps that have worked for me.
I think they will also work for you.
In order to be able to interpret what a speaker says, you must: • listen very attentively and fully understand the speaker's point of view • take down notes on relevant points raised by the speaker • read deeper meaning to what the speaker is saying • relate what the speaker says with what you understand it to mean and use your background knowledge of the issue, the situation or concept being discussed to give/surface and deeper meaning to what is said.
In order for you to be able to listen and critically evaluate what the speaker says, you must do the following: • listen attentively and fully understand what the speaker's points of view are • take down notes • consider the strengths and weakness (or “Pros” and “Cons”) of what the speaker has said • use your own previous experience of the issue being discussed and relate such an experience with what the speaker has said.
Pass valued judgements where necessary and • contribute suggestions, modifications or innovations that will improve what has been said.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Let's try to find out what you have learnt in this unit.
Which of the following is an activity involving critical evaluation?
Tick () i.
Listening to a talk that is boring  ii.
Listening and asking probing questions  iii.
Listening and engaging in active interaction reasoning process of accepting and rejecting points heard  iv.
Listening and recalling the facts.
 96  Of course, you can figure out from this exercise that listening to a talk that is boring may not stimulate critical evaluation.
Nevertheless, when you ask probing questions and engage in active interactive reasoning process or accepting and rejecting of points heard, you can rightly say you are performing an activity that involves critical evaluation.
Critical evaluation is beyond mere recall of facts.
4.0 CONCLUSION Listening-comprehension has been seen, in this unit, as an interactive process involving the interpretative and the critical mind of the listener.
A listener with a critical mind is an intelligent listener.
You listen to interpret speaker's viewpoint to improve and not to destroy.
Innovation should come after listening -comprehension that interprets and critically evaluates what is heard.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit explains the following: • why you must listen for interpretation and critical evaluation • how to listen critically, interpret and evaluate speaker's viewpoints • the suggested words and expressions that you can use for interpretative and critical analysis • steps to follow in listening for interpretation and critical analysis.
I think you will continue to put these concepts into practice in your daily social interactions and academic activities.
Passage 2.1 A.
Calling the Democratic Republic of Congo peace talks the dialogue never seemed like a good idea.
Fifty million exhausted Congolese do not want more talking from their leaders.
They want peace.
B.
Are you for peace or for war?
The answer ought to be obvious, but in a country which has been at war for nearly 40 years, such a question can still pose a challenge.
C. The government itself was cleared of wrong doings in November by a government inquiry.
But it was not entirely over with, as a non-governmental organisation planned taking it to court over a technicality.
The group says armed purchase was unnecessary as there is no military threat to the country.
97 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I D. Considering all the pre-election drama, the election and its aftermath turned out to be peaceful.
The queues, which started at the crack of dawn, were quiet and orderly, with people going in, one after the other, to cast ballots.
E. Nissan Maxima's lead over other cars of its class is bound to inspire comfort.
The comfort of performance that marries smoothness and power- as only a Nissan can; the comfort of a design dedicated to relaxation and the comfort of knowing advanced safety features are there for you.
In fact, it is the kind of comfort that inspires millions of drivers to buy Nissan again.
F. Some Nigerians, jokingly, called it the Oputa Road show.
While others said that it was the most important official public inquiry in the country's history.
But hardly any Nigerian was indifferent to the proceedings of the Human Rights Violation Investigation Commission, headed by Justice C. Oputa.
G. Please, please, please define for us the civilised world.
The phrase is repeated over and over again in the news bulletins since the attacks on America.
I am a keen learner, and would be most interested to know where the civilised world begins.

What is the strength and weakness of the lecture?
a.
_______________________________________________ b.
_______________________________________________ c. _______________________________________________ d. _______________________________________________ Stroke: A Deadly Disease Stroke is a deadly disease nobody will ever pray for.
Those who have suffered from it cannot shake off the depression brought by lingering disabilities.
Stroke, the sudden brain damage caused by blocked or ruptured blood vessels, are the world's third largest killer, after cancer and heart disease.
And, equally alarming, they are a major cause of severe disability, with some 40,000 strokes annually, 15,000 of them fatal.
Weighing about 1.3 kilogram, the average adult brain is a delicate bundle of biochemical activity.
Its circuitry consists of about ten billion nerve cells.
Known as neurons, they transmit and receive messages via tiny electrical charges that are biochemically flashed across synapses, the infinistestimal gaps between the neurons’ wispy branches.
Without oxygen from the blood, neurons die rapidly and cannot be replaced; the brain or any part of it that is starved of blood, stops functioning within minutes.
And the starvation is precisely what happens when a massive stroke occurs.
There are two basic kinds of stroke- “hemorrhagic”, caused by a blood vessel bursting or tearing in the brain, and “ischemic”, caused by the blockage or narrowing of an artery.
In the latter case, those neurons that are starved of blood die, distorting or destroying such functions as speech, comprehension and muscle control, depending on which part of the brain is affected.
Although about three quarters of all strokes are ischemic, the hemorrhagic type tends to be more damaging.
Hemorrhagic strokes often occur when a weak point in the vessel wall balloons out like a faulty inner tube to form an aneurysm, a blister, generally, not bigger than a pea, but in some cases as large as a ping-pong ball.
When the aneurysm ruptures, a spray of blood destroys surrounding brain tissue with an effect similar to that of a high-pressure hose trained on a pile of sand.
A hemorrhage can also result from the gradual hardening of cerebral artery-the blood vessel becoming so brittle that it breaks.

100  UNIT 3 EFFECTIVE READING CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 The Importance of Reading 3.2 How to Read Effectively 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the previous units, you learnt how to listen effectively for general and specific information, main idea, for interpretative and critical evaluation.
I hope you are already practising some of these listening skills in your day to day social and academic life.
In this unit and the subsequent ones, you will be exposed to another very important way of receiving information.
This is through strategies that you can adopt in reading effectively.
You are advised to study the unit very intensely and practise the suggestions given to you.
If you do this, you will emerge an effective reader; and if you are an effective reader, you are likely going to perform well in your studies.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • clearly state the importance of reading • discuss in a systematic order, the strategies for effective reading.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Importance of Reading An important aspect that you use English for in your programme is to read books, articles, newspapers and your study texts and other materials that can give you useful information.
Frequently, you will be asked to read a book for a particular purpose.
Usually, the book contains useful information about the topic you are studying.
It may be valuable for the ideas or views that it puts forward.
101 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Indeed, you read to gain knowledge of what is around you.
Not being able to read is to be ignorant of the happenings, events, situations and developments around you.
Books enlighten you and make you intelligent.
They expose you to various experiences of life and enrich your understanding of the world around you.
You also read to collect facts that can be useful for you in your academic life.
Such facts are in form of data, explanations, reports, findings, theories, laws, and so on.
The facts are also stored in different forms.
Some of these are in form of words, tables, charts, diagrams, formulae and pictures.
Reading can also be for pleasure.
You need to cultivate the habit of reading whatever comes your way for pleasure, entertainment and the joy it gives.
Many studies have shown that Nigerians have not formed the habit of wide informative reading.
Reading culture is yet to be our culture.
Many read only when they are forced to read.
They read for examination or academic purposes only.
They are weak in reading for pleasure.
Do you know what?
Reading is like a medicine.
It heals souls.
It enlivens minds and always makes you feel better.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Rate yourself on the scale presented here to show how important reading is to you.
The rating scale is (0) for situations that are not applicable to you, (1) for just poorly applicable, (2) fairly applicable to you and (3) highly applicable.
0 1 2 3 I read for pleasure everyday     I hate reading     I read for examination only     I read a complete book a day     I read a complete book a week     I read a complete book a year     I have never read a complete book throughout     I read newspapers daily     I never read newspapers     I don't read because I’m a slow reader     I don't read because I cannot find books to read     Have you responded to these questions very honestly?
Do you read for pleasure every day?
Many do not do so.
This is because they have not seen the importance of reading.
Remember, reading must be a pleasurable activity for you.
What is your rating in the items that says I 102  hate reading?
If you are honest, that may be your view about reading.
Reading should be your friend.
You should not hate it.
Item 3 of the above exercise is an interesting one.
Many students read for examination only.
After examination, they hardly read again.
This should not be the case.
Reading should be a day-to-day affair.
You should not let a day go by without gaining something from a book.
Some fast readers read at least a novel a day.
Some make it a duty to read a novel a week or a month.
If you have not cultivated this habit, please do so today.
It will be the most disheartening experience for you never to have read a complete book throughout your lifetime.
As from today, I want you to start to read, extensively.
You can do that by reading at least five novels before you complete this course.
It is true that many do not read because they face certain reading problems.
Some are extremely slow readers.
Some read word by word.
Some fix their eyes on one letter for a long time.
Some pronounce every word when they read silently.
Some read and go back to read the same thing again (this is called regression), some find it difficult to concentrate while reading.
Whatever your problems may be, it is the goal of this course to remove them.
If you practise the exercises in the units coming up very well, you will surely overcome these problems.
3.2 How to Read Effectively Some suggestions are given below to enable you read effectively.
1.
Decide the purpose of reading a book, article, newspaper or any other reading material Note that there is no same purpose for reading all materials.
Some of the different reasons why you read are listed below: • to find some information quickly • to answer a question • to understand a difficult idea • to find meaning/of a word; a concept or a diagram • to analyse a particular concept, diagram, table or chart • to study a concept intensively • to gain ,a general overview of a particular idea • to critically assess a point of view • to read for pleasure entertainment or the joy of it • to locate, specific information concept, idea • for many other reasons.
103 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Your reading speed will vary according to the purpose of reading.
For example, if you just want to locate a point or information you will either skim or scan through the passage to locate such information.
If your purpose is to study the concept thoroughly, then your reading speed will be slow.
What am I saying here?
Flexibility in reading is paramount to effective reading.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Tick () which reading speed you will use while performing the following reading tasks; tick () slow, average or high speed.
Reading speed Reading Tasks Slow Average High • Locating the scores of a football match in a newspaper    • Preparing for examinations    • Writing assignments    • A lawyer preparing for a case    • A medical doctor looking for a particular medicine to use for a patient in a book    • Engineering drawing    • Study a particular nursing topic    • Locating a date in a book    • Deciding whether to read a book or not    From the above exercise, you can see the importance of flexibility in reading.
You can see that you don't read all materials the same way.
You can also see that some materials are to be read very fast, while some are to be read slowly.
For example, locating the score of a football match, you will have to scan through the newspaper very fast with high reading speed.
Of course, in preparing for examinations where you need to understand the concept very well, you must read with slow or average speed.
If a lawyer is preparing for a case, he has to get all the facts of the case correctly.
In order to do this, he must read the material very slowly.
But if a medical doctor wants to locate the name for a particular medicine very quickly, he should skim through the medical book with high speed.
When studying a particular nursing topic, the reader must use average or slow speed, depending on the difficulty level of the material.
2.
Decide what to read In effective reading, you must always decide not only the purpose of reading but also what to read.
It is rarely necessary to read a whole 104  book, except a novel which is to be read for pleasure.
A good starting point is to look at the content page at the front of the book to decide the relevant chapters or pages that are to be read.
A quick look at the chapter headings and sub-headings may help to indicate what should be read.
The index at the back of the book may indicate the relevant portions of the book that can be read.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE In two minutes only, look at the contents presented below and decide the pages you will read, if you want to find information about the following topics or issues.
Write the pages on a piece of paper.

What is your experience?
You discovered that you had to read fast in order to find the pages of the articles.
Cross-check your answers with the ones provided at the end of this unit.
106  3.
Get the overview of what is to be read When you have decided about what to read, you should get an overview of the contents before starting, to read the material.
You need to do that because sometimes you may think the passage, chapter or section of a book is relevant and it may turn out to be irrelevant to the purpose of reading the text.
This quick overview, probably at the back of the book (blurb), which gives a summary of the reading material or the introduction, which gives you the direction of the material, can give the impression about the relevance of the material.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE In a one minute scan through this extract on ‘livestock’ to decide its relevance to a project on livestock breeding in Nigeria, give five reasons for your acceptance or rejection of the relevance of the material to the topic.
Do not spend more than one minute on the article.
Livestock Nigeria has a wide range of livestock which provides an important source of protein.
The concentration of these livestock varies from one part of the country to the other.
Available figures show, for example, that in 1990, of the 13,947,000 cattle in the country, Borno had the highest number of about 3 million while Bauchi, Gongola(now made up of Adamawa and Taraba states), Kaduna, Niger, Plateau and Sokoto had over one million heads of cattle each.
Bauchi, Borno and Kano had over two million sheep and goats in 1990; while Katsina, Gongola and Sokoto followed- with over one million each.
Pigs were, predominantly, found in Benue and Plateau with over 500,000 each, followed by Gongola and Kaduna with 470,000 and 250,000, respectively.
The highest numbers of chickens were found in Benue with over eight million; followed by Ogun, Oyo, Ondo, Anambra and Bendel with over four million birds in 1990.
Bendel and Benue had more than I million each of ducks followed by Bauchi, Plateau, Gongola and Sokoto with slightly less than one million each.
Guinea fowls were predominantly found in Bauchi and Sokoto where over one million each were found in 1990.
The highest number of turkeys was found in Kano, Akwa Ibom and Plateau.
Bauchi had over 500,000 rabbits compared with Kano, Katsina and Kaduna with population of 217,000; 166,000 and 112,000 respectively.
107 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I On the whole, Northern states had 75 -90% of the total livestock counted in 1990.
Northern states- cattle 96.6%; sheep 82.3%; goat 73.1%; pigs 72.6% chickens 56.6%; ducks 75.7%; guinea fowl 93.6%; turkey 73.6% and rabbits 28.5%.
Southern states: cattle 3.4%; sheep 17.7% goats 26.7%; pigs 27.4% chickens 43.4%; ducks 24.3%; guinea fowl 6.4%; turkey 26.6% and rabbits 28.5%.

Do you find the passage relevant to livestock breeding in Nigeria?
If you find it relevant, you may probably give the following reasons.
(a) The article shows the spread of livestock in Nigeria (b) The article shows where a particular livestock can be bred (c) The article shows the types of livestock that can be bred (d) The article shows the area where some of the livestock can be favourably bred (e) The article gives statistics of breeding rate and number.
From this simple exercise, you must have discovered the need to survey articles or reading materials before actually going through the tedious process of reading them, intensively.
You may be wasting your time reading an irrelevant material and later on find out that such material is not meeting the purpose for which reading is intended.
In order for you to decide the relevance of a reading material, read: • the abstract • the introduction or opening paragraph • headings and sub-headings conclusion, usually the final paragraph of the material.
4.
Ask yourself specific questions connected with the material In order to focus on what you are reading, you must start with something to guide your reading.
You should endeavour to answer the guiding questions as you go along in your reading.
If you make notes as you read, you will be able to answer the relevant questions more accurately.
Your notes will assist you to focus on what you are reading.
They will also provide you with the summary of what you have read that can be re-read or revised later on in life, especially during examinations.
108  SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE As you read the passage entitled ‘Using Geographical Information Systems in the Management of Education’, use the following question as your guide.
Try to form notes as you read along.
Use the notes to answer the question after reading the passage.
Guiding question: what is the value of geographical information system?
Using Geographical Information Systems in the Management of Education Space is one of the key dimensions of our lives.
In some places, space is rigidly controlled by such clear features as fences, political borders, walls and school districts; and people arrange what they do and where they go according to these barriers.
These kinds of boundaries may not have been erected in other places, but space remains equally important.
Where can water be obtained, where can crops be planted, and how far must a child walk to school?
Space is both an important resource and constraint for everyone.
It also has a substantial impact on education.
What does someone working as an education planner or manager do about considering the effects of space on education?
How does this person quantify, analyse and display the relationships between geography and education?
How does he or she determine just where education should happen?
How does he/she answer such questions as: • where are new schools needed?
• where can pupils move after completing their primary schooling?
• where are school facilities duplicated?
• where is there a need for new teachers, or where is in-service training most urgently required?
• where should inspection circuits be created?
The tools described in this book will make it easier for the planner to obtain answers.
A Geographical Information System (GIS) comprises a set of tools useful for processing spatial information.
As is true to any set of tools, much of its effectiveness depends on the paradigm in which it is used.
Educational planners and managers with a strong interest in the details of education, in local conditions and local solutions, and in having their efforts translated into tangible products, will make good use of GIS.
Those with broader interests in policies, processes and central control will also use a GIS to highlight, among other things, regional disparities, problem area, and schools in need of immediate action.
109 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I This book has been designed to find something of a middle road between those with a strong interest in education and those with a greater interest in the technology of GIS.
The book seeks to bridge that gap by showing how modem computer technology can be 'user-friendly' in a discipline that often hesitates to use technology when searching for solutions.
Hopefully, it will convince educationists who wonder whether a GIS can be useful that there is much to be gained.
For those embarking on the actual development of a GIS, this book provides a clear introduction to the methodological principles and broad products which can be expected from such a system.
And, for those who know a good deal about GIS, but wonder how to apply the technology in an education setting, examples of spatial issues and questions in education should illustrate the potential value of the applications.
The book describes the planning and development of a geographical information system, explains the components necessary for a GIS and presents a variety of examples of how a GIS map can be used in educational planning and management.
Parts of the book will be published in a series of training modules on school mapping and micro planning.
But given its wider perspective it was felt necessary to make it available to a wider audience.
While this book is intended for those who might wish to develop and use a GIS for education planning and management, it should also be of interest to people working in other social sectors.
Many of the principles important to education are relevant to other services and processes involving people.
This book was compiled with the kind assistance of staff in the Ministry of Education and Culture in Namibia.

Paris: International Institute for Educational Planning.
If you have gone through the passage carefully and taken useful notes, you will be able to answer the guiding question posed at the beginning of the passage.
You will discover that the first two paragraphs are not to be read with seriousness.
This is because they do not answer the question posed at the beginning of the passage.
The values of Geographical Information System come more clearly from the third paragraph.
Compare your answer with the one I present here: The values of Geographical Information System are in its use in processing spatial information; its ability to highlight regional difference, problem areas, and schools in need of immediate action of the educational planners and policy makers.
110  Once again, guiding questions can assist you in locating the important thing you need from the reading materials, the proper focus to be given to the material and what is relevant and irrelevant.
4.0 CONCLUSION If you put everything that is suggested in this unit into practice as you go through the subsequent units under reading-comprehension, I can say that you will read efficiently.
Let me warn you.
You will sooner or later find out that you have a lot to read and only a limited time to read them.
If you know this, it is important for you to read as quickly as possible.
Part of the training in this course is how to increase your reading speed without loss of comprehension.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has exposed you to the following: • the importance of reading • how to read efficiently which includes- deciding the purpose of reading; deciding what to read; getting the overview of what is to be read; asking yourself a guiding question to guide your reading as you read along; and forming notes on what is read.
As you move along in subsequent units, you will be practising some of the suggested effective reading strategies discussed in this unit.

You learnt that flexibility in reading makes you an effective reader.
You should control your reading speed according to the purpose of reading, type of materials to be read and the kind of reading activities you are performing.
The two related reading activities to be discussed in this unit are skimming and scanning.
They are two related reading skills that are useful for pleasure and academic purpose reading.
As you go through the unit, be ready to practise these reading strategies, using the relevant passages provided.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, you should be able to: • identify different silent reading speed • apply the skill of skimming to reading passages in real life situation • practise how to scan passages to locate specific information.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Skimming You should recognise three main reading purposes.
The slowest speed is what you may call study speed for proper understanding of what you read.
At this reading level, you are expected to have a high level of concentration and high level of understanding.
Your attention should go to details in the reading passage.
These details are to be remembered.
Next, reading speed is the one usually called average reading speed.
This speed you 112  should use for books or reading materials that are important and require intensive reading and comprehension, but that are easier than textbooks.
A large number of novels are read at average speed, depending on the enjoyment obtained from them.
The last reading speed which is the concern of this section of the unit is the fastest reading speed.
This is called skimming.
This reading speed is used when you do not need high level of comprehension.
Skimming is used to get a general idea, impression, overview or gist of the reading materials.
Skimming requires rapid reading which is often used when you want to obtain idea quickly.
Let's practice this skill.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Skim through the passage entitled: IMPACT OF PETROLEUM ON THE ECONOMY to determine the general idea, overview and the impression that the author wants to give.
You have three minutes for this exercise.
You are not to go back to the passage after you have skimmed through once.
Use the following questions as guide.
(a) What are the positive sides of petroleum on the economy?
(b) What are the negative sides of petroleum on the economy?
Do not turn to the discussion until you have completed the Exercise.
Have you completed the exercise?
If you have done so, then go to the discussion section.
Impact of Petroleum on the Economy In many ways the easier aspect of my tasks today is the- evaluation of the impact of petroleum on the economy.
It has been both beneficial and negative.
On the positive side, the exploitation of petroleum led to the dramatic explosion in government revenues between 1973 and 1981.
This enabled the Federal and State Governments to undertake a vast expansion in the development of infrastructure and the provision of social services.
It also meant a faster growth of national income in the 1970s than would have been possible without petroleum.
Some linked industrial development has also occurred-oil refineries, the beginning of the petrochemical industry as well as the establishment of some oil service enterprises.
It is difficult these days, after more than ten years of economic depression and relative decline, to recapture the rising expectations and near euphoria which exploding oil revenues created in the early '70s.
It 113 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I is useful to recall a few figures, and I must stress that the naira used in them is the pre-devaluation naira which was worth more than the US dollar.
The National Development Plan of 1955-62 was to cost £164 million.
Actual expenditure was £85 million or 170 million.
The size of the Second Plan, 1970-74, was 3.2 billion.
By contrast, the Third Plan, 1975-1980, called for the investment of"30 billion naira.
Unlike the other plans which assumed 50% dependence on foreign financing, the 1975-80 plan assumed nearly 100% financing from national savings to be made possible by oil taxation.
The vision for 1980-85 was even grander.
Let me say, straight away, that the project revenues for the period 1975 to 1980 were over 90% realised ("39.50 billion compared with "43.78 billion project).
However, we all know that following the military changes of government in 1975, the massive purges of the public service in 1975 and the traumas which followed, the 1975-80 plan priorities and strategies were, largely abandoned.
The emerging enabling environment of political and regulatory stability was shattered.
The nature and content of the rhetoric of several key personages including the manner of the execution of the second indigenisation measures frightened away foreign investment and induced capital flight etc.
Nevertheless, the country utilised the vastly increased government revenues to achieve a massive construction of new trunk roads and upgrading of existing roads and bridges, giving Nigeria a vast network of tarred road, which despite the neglect and disrepair of the past several years is still superior to what is found in many parts of Africa.
Enormous sums were also expended in expanding educational facilities, telecommunications, ports, water resources -all of which could not have come from foreign aid.
The disappointing attitude towards maintenance after the commissioning of these expensive facilities is one of the negative developments.
For those interested in fixing the exact date of the so-called oil boom, we should note that oil revenue was not very significant before 1972.
In 1967, it was "54 million.
By 1973 it had risen to "1.4 billion, "1.6 billion in 1974, and "4.2 billion in 1975.
It was still "5.8 billion in 1977-78.
The greatest windfalls came following the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war.
In 1980 it was US $25 billion, about US $7-8 billion over the last seven years.
However, these figures in themselves are not very significant for our purpose today.

How many minutes did it take you to complete reading the passage?
If you took more than 3 minutes, then you were not skimming any longer.
114  You are probably reading at average speed.
Let me sound a note of warning here- do not read too fast with no comprehension, or too slowly just because you want to comprehend what is read.
Research studies have shown that you are not necessarily gaining lots of comprehension, simply because you are reading slowly.
The slower you read, the less your comprehension rate.
Let's attempt the above exercise; going by the general idea or overview of the entire passage, the positive sides of petroleum include: • explosion in government revenue • provision of social services • industrial development • massive construction of new trunk roads and upgrading of existing ones • expansion of educational facilities The negative sides of petroleum on the economy include: • a disappointing attitude towards maintenance after commissioning of the expensive facilities.
3.2 Scanning Some people use skimming and scanning interchangeably.
This is not our position in this unit.
We take scanning to mean screening the passage very rapidly to locate important information within a large chunk of reading materials.
In such a reading activity, you search through the passage to locate the information.
In scanning, the eyes are not necessarily moving from left to right.
They may move left and right, top to bottom, across the pages, northern to southern part of the page, to locate the specific information you are searching for.
Scanning Let's practice this activity.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Indicate whether what you need is skimming or scanning for the suggested reading tasks stated below.
(a) Locating dates in a bulletin:______________________________ (b) Determining whether the article favours our political party: ____ 115 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I ___________________________________________________ (c) Getting the specific percentage for a particular import-export exchange rate:________________________________________ (d) Locating the names of lecturers in the department from the school prospectus:___________________________________________ (e) Looking for the telephone and E-mail number of the company:__ (f) Locating relevant headings and sub-headings of the research paper:______________________________________________ (g) Obtaining the overall reaction of the writer to the government's policy: and___________________________________________ (h) Locating a specific information on the grade of the student_____ ___________________________________________________ Now that you have finished the above self-assessment exercise, we can discuss the answers.
You scan in order to locate dates in a bulletin, but skim to determine whether or not the article favours our political party.
To get the percentage of import- export /exchange rate you will need to scan through the relevant document.
Scanning will also be done to locate the names of lecturers in a prospectus; so also will scanning be used in looking for telephone number and e-mail address of a company.
You may skim through a research paper to locate the relevant headings and subheadings.
Let's practise scanning using the newsletter of the First Bank Century II - New Frontiers Project, February 2002.
WINNING From the Editor Hello again!!!
Here is another exciting opportunity to learn more about the New Frontier Project.
The focus in this edition will be on the Groupware/Enterprise Portal initiative.
You will be informed about what the project is all about, its objectives and scope.
We'll also bring you up to date on the progress so far.
You can still send in your entries for the new Frontier “Buddie” Quiz published in the December edition.
The deadline has been extended to February to enable upcountry responses get to us.
Names of winners will be published in the next (March) edition.
116  In this edition • The Groupware/Enterprise Portal initiative overview- objectives, scope, where are we, expected benefits.
• And other regular features The Groupware/Enterprise Portal Project Overview Over the past few years, many companies have begun to view the need for information gathering and sharing and the ability to communicate this information speedily across the organisation as being critical to business competitiveness and employee productivity.
Consequently, the selection, purchase and deployment of systems that support “messaging” and “collaboration” has become an item on the agenda of many CEOs.
Messaging simply means communication between two or more people while collaboration means working together as a group or team.
The ability to facilitate the processes of messaging and collaboration has enabled many organisations to work smarter, hence, increasing workforce productivity, decreasing costs and enhancing shareholders' value.
This revolution in the workplace has been brought about by two major types of technologies: • groupware • enterprise portal What is a Groupware?
A groupware is any software that allows two or more people to work together as a group without necessarily being present in the same physical (geographical) location.
Simply put, it is a software designed to improve the productivity of a team of individuals with common goals e.g.
individuals in the same branch, project teams or individuals with a common group identity e.g.
branch managers, regional managers, and so on.
The term “groupware” encompasses several types of technology that facilitate e-mail, electronic bulletin boards, online meetings, discussion groups, group calendaring and scheduling, knowledge management and workflow.
These terms are explained in detail on Page 3.
117 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I What is an Enterprise Portal?
The enterprise portal is a simple personalised interface (window) through which an individual can access and utilise the various information sources within or outside his/her organisation.
Using First Bank as an example, if an enterprise portal is deployed, an employee can, from his workstation, have access to the banking application, the help desk, HR policy database, e-mail facility, training databases, and so on.
Why are we embarking on this initiative?
As part of the efforts to achieve its 'big one' vision in the Nigerian Financial Services industry, First Bank recognizes the fact that it can exploit the use of information as a source of competitive advantage by ensuring optimal distribution and usage of its available information resources.
Our vision: “to be the clear leader and Nigeria s bank of first choice” SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Scan through the above newsletter of the First Bank Century II to locate the following information.

It is possible for you to skim and scan at the same time depending on the purpose and the information you are searching for.
As from today, try and skim and scan through all the Nigeria newspapers you come across each day.
By the time you do this for quite a long time, skimming and scanning will become part and parcel of you.
4.0 CONCLUSION Skimming and scanning are two related rapid reading activities.
You should see them as interesting activities to be performed daily.
Do you know what?
You need to acquire lots of information daily.
The series of exercises in this unit will prepare you for daily information gathering activities.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has exposed you to the following: • how to skim through passages to get the gist, main idea or ideas of a passage and • how to scan to locate important information.
The next unit will train you to build on those two interrelated reading activities as you read for speed.

Mobile functions of Lotus Notes include (10)__________________and (11) _______________________ Newsletter for Skimming and Scanning Functionalities of Lotus Notes The benefits of using Lotus Notes will be better understood with a basic knowledge of the various functionalities of Lotus Notes.
These functionalities include: Electronic mail and messaging.
Electronic mail is a system for sending messages and files between computers.
Many of us are already familiar with this as most individuals currently use the internet for this purpose.
With e-mail, First bankers can send and receive text messages conveniently, quickly and cheaply.
Group calendaring and scheduling The calendaring and scheduling functionality is very useful for managing time and setting up appointments and meetings.
With this functionality, you can send out meeting notices, respond to meeting invitations, and receive e-mail or audible alerts/reminders for scheduled events like meetings and appointments.
120  This functionality also supports personal and group “To do” lists to help you effectively manage any tasks/activities you have outlined.
Knowledge management Knowledge management ensures the capture, storage and dissemination of ideas, skills and knowledge of an organisation's workforce.
This functionality works like a database that harnesses an organisation's knowledge capital.
Thus, with Lotus notes, First bankers can create, collaborate, distribute and share information.
For instance, the bank's training curriculum, newsletters and journals can be stored in various databases which bank staff can access via Lotus Notes.
Workflow Workflow is a generic term given to the tasks, the steps, the people and tools involved in each step of a business process.
Lotus Notes can help to automate processes and manage consistent handling of work Lotus Notes will be able to provide the workflow capabilities to automate the following processes.
• Processing of staff loan • Application for leave • Appraisal • Expenditure Mandate • Settlement of Bills • Budget Monitoring • Store Requisitions • Cheque Book Procurement Electronic meeting systems This functionality enables individuals to conduct meetings electronically.
Consequently, individuals do not always have to be physically present in the same location to hold a meeting.
This functionality supports both talking and exchanging of messages (video and audio) in real time.
Mobile features This ensures that Lotus Notes reach can be extended to individuals even at remote locations.
It also allows mobile employees to stay connected to the most current information.
For instance, if you are away from your branch on official assignment, you can still access your mails via the internet, or through a remote dial-up from anywhere you are.

The first part assists you to practice reading at the fastest speed.
This section is an extension of unit 4- where you learnt the skill of skimming and scanning.
The difference is that skimming and scanning in this unit are geared towards reading very fast, while the ones discussed in unit 4 are directed towards making you able to locate specific information and obtain a general impression of a particular reading passage.
The second part of the unit is devoted to the practice of reading at an average speed.
You are to learn how to read materials of different types with pleasure and maximum comprehension.
The last part of this topic is the slowest- reading at an average speed which is used in a study-type of situation.
This last part will not be handled in this section.
It will be the concern of unit 1 of module 3 of this course.
As you study this unit, have your pen, paper and a dictionary beside you.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • read passages, at the fastest speed, with maximum comprehension • read passages at an average reading speed, with maximum comprehension • perform various comprehension tasks that are associated with reading with fastest and average speed.
123 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Reading at the Fastest Speed In the last unit, we attempted the discussion of the three kinds of silent reading speed, all for different purposes.
Can you still remember these silent reading speed levels?
If you cannot remember these, turn to unit 4 of this module and find out.
Well, I think you have found out these levels- the slowest speed for high level understanding and when it is necessary to remember details; next is average speed for easier texts and reading materials and the fastest which is skimming and scanning.
In the last unit, I ended with a note that it is possible to skim and scan- read a passage at the same time.
Skimming and scanning are regarded at the fastest speed.
According to Edward Fry, a good reader achieves 50% comprehension while skimming and scanning at more than 800 words per minute.
This is, possibly, the fastest speed you can achieve in your academic activities.
Since this unit is concerned with the reading and comprehension at varying speed levels, the first speed level you will practice is the level that requires you to skim and scan at the same time.
This is to be regarded as the fastest reading-comprehension speed level.
Let's practise it.
Passages lumped together here are on various topics of high interest.
You are expected to skim and scan through the passages to answer the following questions.
You have half a minute for each question.
Fill in the blanks once you find the answer.
Record the time you start the exercise, and when you finish.

Therefore, if there is any mistake the Justice Minister made while in office, it is his inability to make Nigerians who are aggrieved, to see the court as the last hope for conflict resolution.
Those that have resorted to killing as way of having the upper hand in any disagreement should have a rethink and know that as their action have caused the country a great loss, so will the punishment of the ungodly act be visited upon them on the day of judgment.
Odua Abdulfatai Maiduguri, Borno State I am really in sympathy with the wife, children, relatives and cronies of late Ige and I pray to God Almighty to grant them the right frame of mind to bear this great wastage to humanity.
The family of Ige should not weep for their departed husband, father, brother, uncle, etc., but they should weep for our sickening country, Nigeria.
Uncle Bola Ige, may your great soul dwell in eternal peace with God in his Celestial Heavens where Christ reigns as overall king.
Olu Leo Ezekiel Yaba, Lagos If Bola Ige had been murdered in the Abacha's days, most people would have jumped to the conclusion that it was a state sponsored act; but now that his death is linked to political squabbles in a democratic dispensation, the lesson inherent is that violence will continue to reign in Yoruba land except the people eschew politics without bitterness.
It is unfortunate that Bola Ige was killed at the height of his political carrier.
However, what this gruesome murder portrays is that if the killers are not fished out, we may never be close to identifying the real murderers of Kudirat Abiola.
Ige's death should serve well in reminding us that we have always lived in very uncertain times.
Be it the regime of Babangida, Abacha, Abudulsalami Abubakar or Obasanjo, the naked truth is that mysterious deaths have occurred more in the Southwest than any other part of the country.
J. Okunlola 125 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Obasanjo Stops Army Operations in Benue A war of wit is gathering momentum in the nation's political milieu between the National Assembly and the governors of the 36 states of the federation.
It is a war whose causalities may be the nation's toddling democracy and its supposed beneficiaries-Nigerians-who trooped out in 1999 to elect their representatives.
At the centre of raging battle is the electoral bill as amended by the two houses of the National Assembly at separate sessions early this month.
Under ideal circumstances, the bill or its amendments by the nation's highest legitimate body could not have raised any dust.
But the extension of the tenure of the local government chairmen and their councilors from three to four years as well as the interpretation of the constitutional provision that restricts the tenure of governors to two terms by the National Assembly stirred the hornet's nest.
The 36 state governors interpreted the National Assembly's decision on these highly sensitive areas as an encroachment on their constitutional power to legislate on the tenure of local government councils.
Bringing up Boys Dr James Dobson A Gold Mine Wisdom for Raising Your Son Boys will be boys but with 'gender neutral' propaganda and pressures, many assume any differences between the sexes are merely learned.
Dr James Dobson's new book, ‘Bringing Up Boys’, shout straight about the most important ways boys are distinctively, instinctively different.
Find out why boys are the way they are and how to understand their emotional and physical development, motivate and teach them, and guide them into dynamic, godly manhood.
Essential reading for parents, teachers and leaders!
Strong, stable, godly men are the greatest needs of our time.
Married or single, if you have a son, you will want to have this book as ready references.
It's a comprehensive study by a godly man who knows his subject ( Kay Arthur).
I only wish Dr. Dobson's book would have been available when I was raising my two boys.
He touches every essential area about boys, and I'm excited about the enrichment and encouragement this book will bring to families.

When I did it, I noticed that my eyes had to be moving back and forth trying to locate the relevant extract and the relevant answer to the question.
It means that in skimming and scanning your eyes must move fast.
You should be able to locate headings and sub-headings, discover relevant names, titles and topics at a very high speed.
You must always remember that you have a lot to read and that you cannot afford to waste time.
You need to be able to read a large volume of, material within a limited time.

If you scored above 7 out of 10 points, then I rightly say that you are on the right path to learning how to practice these very important reading skills.
If you are below, please practise harder.
You will make it.
3.2 Reading at the Average Speed This is the second reading speed that we will practise in this unit.
Average speed is to be used to read novels, easy textbooks, well laid out articles and materials that are presented using simple sentences, 128  colourful inscriptions with a lot of guide and signposts to assist the reader to grasp the contents of the reading material.
For you to read at an average speed, you must be reading 250-500 words per minutes for 70% comprehension.
If you are reading at 300 words per minute with 30-40% comprehension, you are not reading with adequate comprehension rate.
Reading speed and comprehension rate are related; you do not say you are reading.
It is only when you read fast and comprehend very highly that you can be said to be an efficient reader.
Reading with no comprehension is no reading.
Let's practice how to read with average reading speed.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the extract titled the ‘Inefficacy of the Confederal System’ with an average speed of 300 words per minute.
Since the passage has 980 words, you should finish reading it under 4 minutes.
Record the time you start reading the passage and record the time you end.
You should not spend more than 4 minutes to read the passage.
After reading the passage, answer the questions that follow without going back to re-read the passage.
If you go back to re-read the passage, know that you have not comprehended it.
You merely read without comprehension.
The Inefficacy of the Confederal System It is my belief that those who are advocating for a confederacy in Nigeria are doing so with the ultimate motive of breaking up the country.
All the confederations I know of throughout the world are the products of the movement of sovereign states to unite as a single political entity.
But people are trying to turn our case the other way round.
I have carefully studied the motive of those who are agitating for a confederacy in Nigeria, and I found two issues to be uppermost in the minds of these advocates.
One of the issues is the question of the leadership of the country and the inordinate ambition of a certain section of the nation to produce the president of the country from their section at all costs.
The other reason is oil.
My investigation shows the areas where the agitation is most pronounced are the Yoruba speaking parts of the country and some parts of the Southern minority areas.
Many of those engaged in the agitation from these two areas have deliberately forgotten the contribution made by other parts of the country for many years before the discovery of oil and who are still 129 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I contributing towards the stability, prosperity and the survival of the nation.
Our compatriots from the Western part of Nigeria need to be reminded that they depend on the rest of the country for many things such as food, livestock, industrial raw material and other items which are essential for their survival.
In addition, over 90% of the manufactured goods made in Nigeria are produced in their area and the rest of the country serve as market for these items.
Breaking up Nigeria will automatically deny such, commodities access of right to that market.
Where goods manufactured in that area cannot get an automatic access to this big market, the factories producing the items will inevitably grind to a halt with the attendant consequences of unemployment.
This coupled with the interruption in normal supply of food, livestock, raw materials and other necessities of life to the area will lead to a very serious hardship to their people.
What happened during the strike in Lagos and some parts of the West in August last year, where severe food shortages and liquidity problems forced people to depend on roasted maize, coconuts and plantain for existence is an example of what could happen to the people of that area in such an event.
One question of producing the president which many Nigerians are grumbling about is an issue which is unnecessarily being over-flogged.
Since the introduction of constitutional government in Nigeria, there were only two national leaders elected by the people of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Alhaji Shehu Shagari.
Balewa became Prime Minister- courtesy of the Action Group which denied the NCNC its victory in the Western region, after the 1951 general election.
Had the NCNC enjoyed the fruit of its victory in that Region at that time, the party would have been in control of the Eastern and Western regions and could have been the largest party in the federal parliament when the post of Prime Minister was introduced in the country.
In such an event, the party could have been the one to produce the Prime Minister for this country.
As for Alhaji Shehu Shagari, he was elected president largely by the minority states both in the North and South in the 1979 election.
Going by the record of that election, Shagari came first only in two Hausa/Fulani speaking states as against five minority states, and got the mandatory one quarter of the total votes ca needed to get the required national spread from five now Hausa/Fulani States.
Those who talk of the election of Alhaji Shehu Shagari as president- as a scheme by the Hausa/Fulani, are not sincere to themselves.
130  Besides, it is not the person of a president alone that determines who dominates a country.
There are other factors such as the propensity of people from a given area in such vital sectors in the public life, such as the policy making mechanism, bureaucracy, control of the economy, commerce and industry in the life of the country.
I share the popular views that military rule is an aberration.
I therefore regard anything arising from such a situation as an abnormality.
It is precisely for that reason that I do not take the number of military men who ruled this country into my political arithmetic anytime I come to consider the number of people who ruled Nigeria.
Besides, nations do not attain greatness by producing their leaders in terms of where they come from.
The case of the United States of America is a shining example.
According to records, the first dozen or so of presidents of the United States were from the same geographical area of the country.
In fact, most of the presidents of that country were elected from that section.
If the citizens of the United State think of their leaders in terms of the area they come from, that nation could not be what it is today.
This is not to say that people from other parts of the nation should not aspire to be president of this country.
If we consider the situation in the oil producing states we would find things to be even more untellable, The area is the most unstable and volatile part of the country, which owes its peace and stability to the of the bigger family of the Nigeria nation.
It is common knowledge that the present oil-producing states in the minority areas of the country got their states through the collective efforts of Nigerians from non-oil producing areas.
The fragile nature of the polity in those states up to the present moment is known to all and sundry.

We regard you capable of reading at an average speed if you were able to complete the reading of the passage on Inefficacy of the Confederal System in 4 minutes and be able to score 7 out of 10 on the comprehension, without going back to the passage to re-read it.
Cross check your performance on this comprehension task, at the end of the unit.
4.0 CONCLUSION What are we trying to say in this unit?
We are trying to train you in the art of reading in a flexible manner.
What we are saying is that you do not read all materials the same way.
You should be capable of varying your reading speed according to the purpose of reading, the time available to read and the kind of materials you are reading.
Remember the primary goal of all reading activities, no matter the reading speed is to comprehend.
The slogan is still- true reading without comprehension is no reading.

In the previous unit (unit 5, module 2), you learnt about reading at the fastest and average speed rates.
I hope you remember the aspects discussed under that unit.
We said reading at the fastest speed is needed when you want to locate any information quickly or gain general impression of the reading material.
Reading at an average speed suggests reading a material that is not so difficult.
In this unit, you will learn the slowest type of reading which is reading in a study-type manner.
Get your paper, pencil and dictionary ready for this unit.
Be ready to undertake some practice activities.
135 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • identify the steps to take in reading at study-type speed • practice reading passages in a study-type reading speed manner • make notes from reading passages • determine your reading speed while reading with a study-type speed.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Reading at a Study Speed Level This unit is a continuation of the last unit of module 2, which is devoted to reading at the fastest speed, as well as reading at an average speed.
The last reading speed level that will be discussed in this course is study reading speed.
As I have said to you earlier on, the slowest reading speed is the study reading speed.
This reading speed needs high concentration and particular attention to specific details which must be remembered, possibly during examinations.
The first exercise that must be done, while undertaking study-type reading is note-making- putting together the important points that you read.
Can you still remember what we said in the previous units about the distinctions between note-taking and note-making?
If you cannot remember, turn to the relevant unit.
Have you been able to make the distinction between the two activities?
Let me assist you in doing so.
Note-taking is a term we reserve for taking notes from lectures, speeches or talks that are heard.
Note-making is jotting down the important points from textbooks, articles, reports and handouts.
3.2 Note-Making from Books Note-making from books is not the same as taking notes from lectures; although the two activities share certain things in common.
The things that the two activities have in common are stated below.
1.
You must, first of all, understand what the lecture or the textbook is saying before you start writing notes.
2.
Pay attention to the headings and sub-headings of the lecture or the textbook.
They can be very important in determining the major points.
In most cases, the title often implies the major points that will be covered in tile lectures or the reading material.
This is not always the case 136  as I pointed out earlier on.
Sometimes, the title may be deceptive.
It may not contain what is in the content of the lecture or the book.
3.
Look for the signals in the lecture and the textbook that show that an important point or main point is about to be stated.
Some of the signals are stated in the book.
Look!
Important points are about to be made when you hear or see: • firstly/first, secondly/second... • the most important, more important, least important... • this, therefore.., nevertheless... • the major point... • perhaps, the best of all • it's worth remembering... • consequently.../conversely • moreover... furthermore... ...and many others... 4.
Write down the major points as stated by the lecturer or the textbook.
Having sorted out the major points of the lecture, the textbook or articles, you should write these points down.
In the case of listening-comprehension, you have to write the points down quickly; but in the case of making notes from texts, you have more time to write the points down.
5.
Select, as you write down the points, the words or phrases that give maximum information about the major point.
You should also avoid words and expressions that do not convey any meaning, except they are needed to stick the notes together.
6.
Show connections between the previous points put down as notes and the present ones.
Connections can be shown by: • leaving spaces between the first heading and the second • underlining the major points that cut across • conventional symbols such as (→)(=) (≠), and so on • consistently numbering the points • laying out the notes in a clear, fashionable, readable and attractive manner.
I think you can produce good notes from books.
You will certainly do so if you keep to the suggestions given above.
Unlike note-taking from lectures, note-making from books can be revisited.
You can read and re-read the passage to be sure the correct points are put down; but 137 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I in listening comprehension type of note taking, it is often difficult to get the lecturer to repeat the major points.
In most cases, you find out that you cannot stop the lecturer when talking.
However, in case of note- making from texts, you can always go back and re-read areas that are not clear to you.
Let us devote some time to practising how to make notes from a reading material.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Read the passage titled ‘Who Does What in Nigerian Agriculture’ and form notes on the major points raised by the writer of the passage.
Use your notes to answer the questions that follow.
Use your dictionary to find the meaning of any difficult words you may come across in the passage.
Who Does What in Nigerian Agriculture Having argued that Nigerian agriculture is still the backbone of the Nigerian nation, I would wish to salute all Nigerian farmers, wherever they may be, for sustaining the nation despite the apparent neglect suffered by them all these years.
The difficulty of Nigerian agriculture has risen from bad policies and implementation strategies by Nigerian elites who generally lack self-confidence in their abilities and their enormous corrupt tendencies.
It is some of these politicians who now want to deny completely the enormous contributions which our farmers have made to this nation over the decades.
In their struggle for self aggrandisement, these selfish elites have come up with fabricated lies about the economic status of the nation to the extent that they have to find someone to blame for what is largely their own failings.
In the political furore of recent years, the Northern part of this country is being told unashamedly that it does not contribute anything to the national economy.
We have just established, without any iota of doubt, the role of agriculture in the country's economy, its well- being and stability.
In the remaining part of this paper, I have been drawn to argue with justifiable statistics how and why the fanners in the North have remained the bulwark of agricultural production in the country.
Without doubt, the ecological zones which constitute the present Northern states - (the accused for non-productivity) are the main sources of the staple foods, the animal proteins and most of the raw materials for, Nigeria's agro-based industries.
The millions of peasant farmers and livestock herdsmen in these ecological areas are the brain behind most of the food and raw materials produced to support 138  Nigeria's needs all these years.
Indeed, the export of groundnuts and cotton made its mark as a major foreign exchange earner for the country long before the discovery of oil in the Southern part of Nigeria.
The significant difference between productivity through farming and 'productivity' through the oil wells is often the missed point that in agriculture it is the sweat and toil of the farmer tending his crops and livestock which matter.
The farmer, the herdsman, the fisher man and logger, all put in the labour and the capital to produce the goods which dominate the Nigerian GDP.
Unlike agriculture, crude petroleum was not known by Nigerians until the European investor came with his capital but most importantly his technology.
Even today, Nigerians are generally idle onlookers in this sector.
They still do not understand the technological complexities of the oil industry but nonetheless are happy to share in the natural underground bounty.
This idle source of revenue has created a lazy Nigerian elite consumer, desperately wishing to acquire wealth without having to work for it.
This is the calamity created by the so-called oil wealth which Nigerians, irrespective of where they live, do not really work for.
Idle as the oil revenue has always being, one cannot underplay its importance in the present political economy of the country.
One concedes the fact that oil is a wasting natural resource and its exploration is fraught with appreciable danger to the earth surface especially where it is mined both on-shore and oft-shore.
These hazards must be part of an integrated plan for social and economic development of the areas where this mining is taking place.
For example, the mines in the Jos Plateau benefited all Nigerians but today the environmental degradation and damage to the inhabitants of Plateau State is quite apparent.
These lessons should be applied to the present oil fields.
It must be understood however, that environmental degradation is not the exclusive consequence of oil exploration.
Example was given of the Jos Plateau.
In fact the most extensive damage to the Nigeria environment is as a result of agricultural activities which we desperately need to sustain the nation but is unfortunately, taken for granted in our national planning.
The intensity of farming and livestock production in the Northern Guinea Savanna and the Sahel areas of the country appear to be appreciated only from the amount of food that is produced and sold to Nigerians all over the country.
Little thought and concern are shown to the short and the long term negative consequences on the soils and vegetation cover of these intensely farmed and grazed areas.
This attitude has in the last twenty years produced the harsh environmental conditions generally referred to as desert encroachment.
These 139 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I agricultural activities, vital as they are to our survival as a nation, have consequential hazards as serious as those which arise from oil exploration.

3.3 Practice in Determining Study-Type Reading Speed In a slow study type reading, you should ensure that you read at least 200-300 words per minute.
You should also ensure that you have a high- level comprehension while studying at this reading speed level.
At least, in a study type reading speed, your comprehension rate should be about 80-90% (James, et.al, 1979: 100 - 1).
For a poor reader to achieve a comprehension rate of 80-90%, the study speed will be as low as 60 - 125 words per minutes.
Determine your study -type reading speed by going through Exercise 1 below: SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Read the passage on ‘Doing the Groundwork’ and perform the comprehension tasks that follow.
Before you start reading, write down the time.
When you end reading the passage; record the time you finish reading.
Since you are expected to read 250 words per minute, this passage should not take you more than- two and half minutes (21/ minutes).
If you take more than that, 2 you are still a slow reader.
More practice is therefore needed.
142  2.
After you finish reading the passage, turn to the comprehension questions that follow the passage.
Attempt all the questions without turning to the passage.
Record your comprehension rate.
You are expected to attain at least 80-90% comprehension rate, reading at 250 words per minute, at a study type reading speed.
Check answers to the comprehension questions at the end of the unit.
Doing the Groundwork Hosting a major sporting event on the African continent has often been considered more of a curse than an honour.
Kenya were stripped of the African Cup of Nations of 1995 after preparations were deemed inadequate, while Zimbabwe stumbled their way through the hosting of the All-Africa Games in the same year.
But the Zimbabwe 2000 local organizing committee, under the impressive leadership of tournament director Brian Harry, is determined to make the next Cup of Nations the best ever.
With the tournament less than two years away, some important decisions needed to be taken by the visiting Confederation of African Football (CAF) delegation led by their president, Isaa Hayatou.
In particular, the organisers had to decide exactly which cities would host the tournament.
It's now a CAF requirement that a host nation provides four centers for the Cup of nations.
The Zimbabwe capital, Harare, will probably provide two, and the second city, Bulawayo, a third.
When the decision was made, in 1996, to grant Zimbabwe the tournament, several smaller cities made it clear that they were keen to join the party.
Zimbabwe is an ethnically divided country, so to avoid any accusations of regional bias, CAF was called in to take the decision out of the hands of the local organisers.
It seemed a no-lose situation, with both sides certain to be happy with the outcome.
Four centres hoped to win the approval of the CAF big-wigs- Mutare, Masvingo, Gweru and Kwekwe.
They were each given the chance to present their bids and, in particular, explain exactly what they planned to do to bring their stadiums up to international specifications.
From an early stage it was clear that most, if not all, of the aspiring hosts had severely underestimated the size of the task.
Mutare, for example, had budgeted about US$300,000 for the renovation of the local stadium.
In truth, it would probably need at least three times that amount.
As the delegation passed from one town to another, always lavishly entertained, always treated with the reverence usually reserved 143 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I for royalty, something didn't seem quite right.
The lack of realism at the heart of the bids raised several questions, although until we arrived at our third destination, Gweru, those questions remained unasked.
It was in Gweru that reality finally sank in.
As the town councilors proudly explained their plans for a new stadium to be built from scratch, they added with a flourish that there would be seating for forty members of the press.
“But”, queried the CAF delegation, “our minimum requirement is that there must be space for at least two hundred journalists.” Source: BBC Focus on Africa.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Answer these questions to determine your study-type reading rate.
The comprehension questions are on the passage you have just finished reading.
Fill in the gaps.
1.
(a) …………………was stripped off of African nations cup after (b)…………………….was deem (c)……………………………... 2.
(d)……………………was planning to host the 2000 African cup.

In CAF’s estimation a minimum requirement is that a space is created for (k)……………………..……..journalists instead of the (l)……………..number booked for in Gweru.
Have you finished answering the comprehension questions?
What are the problems you faced?
What is your reading speed?
How many minutes did it take you to read the passage?
Are you within 250 words per minute study reading speed range?
These are some of the questions that should agitate your mind as you complete this exercise.
If you still find out that your reading speed is slow, do not be discouraged.
What this means is that you must make constant reading your habit.
Practice makes perfect.
144  SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Go through the passage ‘Doing the Groundwork’ again and write down the words or expressions used by the writer to draw your attention to a major point.
Cross -check your answer with the ones given in the box after you have attempted the exercise.
Calling attention to an important point But Zimbabwe...
Some important decisions...
It is now a CAF... From an early stage...
It is clear that most...
In truth...
It was in Gweru...
Finally...
But queried CAF delegation.
You are advised to always look for the expressions that call attention to an important point in a passage.
They make your comprehension task less difficult.
4.0 CONCLUSION Now that you have come to the end of the two-part series on reading and comprehending with varying speeds, we can conclude that materials are not to be read the same way, the same time, in all purposes.
The purpose of reading, time available to read the materials, the level of comprehension expected to be attained, and the kinds of reading test to be performed, all determine the speed with which you will read the materials.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit offers you the opportunity to practise the following: • reading at a study speed level which is the slowest type of reading • note-making from books • exercises and tasks on study-type reading speed.
It is my hope that you will increase your reading speed as you carry on with this course.
But remember, speed and accuracy is the watchword.
145 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Read the passage below using a study-type reading speed.
Since the passage is about 235 words, it should not take you more than one minute to read.
After you have finished reading, answer the comprehension questions that follow without re-reading the text.
Remember, you have only one minute to read the passage.
Consequences of Parent-Child Separation Research confirms that the consequences of any parent-child separation can be severe.
In one study of fathers whose jobs required them to be away from their families for long periods of time, the children tended to experience numerous negative reactions, including anger, rejection, depression, low-self esteem and, commonly, a decline in school performance.
Some of those conclusions were presented at a White House conference at which I spoke a few years ago.
The other speaker was Dr. Armand Nicholi, professor of psychiatry at Harvard University.
Dr. Nicholi explained how family circumstances that make parents inaccessible to their children produce some of the same effects as divorce.
Most important, Dr. Nicholi stressed the undeniable link between the interruption of parents-child relationship and the escalation of psychiatric problems we were then seeing and that are more pronounced today.
If the numbers of dysfunctional families and absentee parents continued to escalate, he said, serious national health problems were inevitable.
In short, even when parent-child separation occurs for valid reasons in a loving home, a boy or girl frequently interprets parental departure as evidence of rejection.
If we have any choice in the matter, we should not put them through that painful experience.

3.2 Recipe for Vocabulary Development 3.3 Do You Still Turn to the Dictionary Every Second?
3.4 Finding Meanings of Words by Word Attack 3.5 Finding Meanings of Words by Searching Round the Passage 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Words and their meanings are powerful.
You need words in mostly every type of communication.
You cannot listen, speak, write or read English effectively without the words.
Therefore you need to be able to increase your vocabulary power house.
To increase your vocabulary power suggests a lot of efforts on your own part.
You need to read intensively and extensively.
You need to increase your vocabulary power daily and you need to be able to deduce meanings of words in contexts.
All these are the concern of the next four units you will be treating in this course.
I hope that at the end of the units, you will be fully equipped to be able to multiply your vocabulary power house tremendously.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • determine what vocabulary power is • identify the recipe for vocabulary development • apply different ways of finding meaning of words in their contexts to finding meanings of words in reading passages.
148  3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Do you know what?
To increase your word power in English is to be proficient in the language.
If you have limited vocabulary items in your head, you will not read, speak or write English well.
Specifically, you will find reading with thorough understanding difficult.
You need English words to receive information from the texts and to produce and convey information.
Inadequate store of vocabulary items can lead to your failure in examinations.
During examinations, you may be short of words and expressions to use.
You may also be unable to read, comprehend, summarise or write well.
Do you know what?
You can increase your word power by reading extensively.
In fact, no day should go by without you gaining some new words.
The great advantage of gaining new words daily is revealed in this simple poem in the next section.
3.2 Recipe for Vocabulary Development Gain one word a day and you have 365 words a year.
Gain two words a day and 730 words become yours in a year.
If you gain three words a day, you are expecting 1095 words a year.
Four words a day gives you 1460 a year.
Don't try to gain five words a day, or else you’ll find yourself 1825 words richer at the end of the year.
If you want to increase your word power, open up a reading dairy today and record in context the new words you have gained a day.
Wise men bank their words in a reading diary; it yields interest.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Before we go any further in this unit, let's determine your entry vocabulary power with a simple exercise.
In this exercise, you are expected to read these short passages and choose the best answer to complete the text from the four options given.
Indicate the answer in the box at the right hand/corner of the paper.
The word to focus on in the exercise is in bold letters.
Choose the alternative you think best gives the meaning of the underlisted word and fits into the context.

Fig.2.1 Word Power Ladder Weigh yourself on the power weighing scale designed in the box.
The scale depends on your performance in self-assessment exercise 1.
No matter your position on the ladder, there is still room for improvement.
3.3 Do You Still Turn to the Dictionary Every Second?
Yes, let me confess to you.
Dictionary is good but it should be the last resort.
One way to increase your word power is to guess the meaning of a word from the context.
Any word whose meaning you are able to figure out on your own without turning to the dictionary or asking somebody else, you will never forget.
There are a number of ways you can deduce meaning of a word from the context.
The first one to discuss and practise is word attack.
3.4 Finding Meanings of Words by Word Attack You can attack a seemingly long and difficult word by breaking it into their divisible parts such as prefixes (attachment to a word that comes before the root of the word); root (the core or the main part of the word) and suffixes (attachments after the root or main part of the word).
You can find the meaning of each component and join them at the end to deduce the actual meaning of the word.
153 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I The UN in Sudan Constantly threatened by war, air attacks and incursions by government armed militias from neighbouring Arab tribes, tile Nuba are past- masters at making the best of things.
Everything is recycled; following air raids, pieces of bomb fragments immediately find their way onto the market; and then to the blacksmiths to be converted into knives and agriculture tools.
Some of the locals joke that it is only the air raids that stand between them and the stone age.
The Nuba are faced with a growing dilemma; they are currently suffering from Khartoum's blockade on relief and desperately need more food, but unfettered UN access could undermine their way of life.
It is ironic that the help so desperately needed could prove to be their undoing.
Father Kizido, a Catholic missionary who has long worked in the area, points out- ‘Isolation is very heavy burden, but I don't think the solution lies in opening up to the outside world completely.
I hope the Nuba will be clever enough to strike a balance.
The big danger will come if the UN starts dumping food and upsetting traditional production techniques, and create dependency as they have in South Sudan where round -the-clock air-drops have become a way of life’.
However, even if the UN humanitarian mission is given the go-ahead, the seemingly intractable political and military problems, which underline and underpin the starvation, will still remain.
The Nuba are still caught in the middle of a long running conflict, which the international community is only now beginning to take seriously.
Their leader fears that a quick-fix solution imposed on the margins of one side or the other of a divided nation.
A workable peace settlement that satisfies the diverse interest of the Nuba and other minorities as well as the Southerners would appear to be in a future as dim as it is distant.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Find the meaning of the under listed words in the passage titled ‘The UN and Sudan’ by breaking them into their component parts and joining the meaning of the parts together to obtain the overall meaning of the words.
The words to attack this way are listed below.
Complete the exercise before turning to the discussion that follows.
(1) incursions (8) round-the-clock (2) blockade (9) humanitarian (3) unfettered (10) intractable (4) undermine (11) starvation (5) desperately (12) long-running (6) undoing (7) dependency 154  Have you completed the exercise?
Turn to the discussion below if you have done so.
Also note that not all English words can be subjected to word attack process of deducing meanings.
You discover that some words are prone to this kind of way of finding meaning than the other.
By breaking the words listed in exercise 2, the following components emerge.
From the smaller units of the words, the meaning of the entire words can be deduced.
1. incursions incur - sions brought suffix in (entry into) 2. blockade block - ade prevent art of (stop entry) 3. unfettered un - fetter - d not chain past-tense hinder (unhindered) 4. undermine under mine below me (reduce/bring down) 5. desperately desperate - ly willing to adverb do without caring eager (seriously willing) 6. undoing un - do - ing not do - continuous (go against) 155 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 7. dependency depend ency relying art of (too much reliance) 8. round-the-clock round tie clock) throughout the time (all the time) 9. humanitarian human - nit - arian from feeling nity noun for people (concern for people) 10. intractable in - tract - able not large adjective expensive area that can be seen/control (not controllable) 11. starvation starve - action hunger noun (famine) 12. long-running long running extended going period of time (going for long) Of course, even though this is not the only way to determine meanings of words, it is one of the ways.
You make the words easier to find their meanings when you break them into smaller meaningful components.
156  3.5 Finding Meanings of Words by Searching Round the Passage Many a time, you find the meaning of words by looking at the surrounding of the words in the passage.
If you look at some words before, after, above or below the word in the passage, you may find the meaning of the popular word that is difficult for you.
That is, some of the words or expressions surrounding the word that you find difficult may give you clues to its meaning.
Again let us practice this.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Read the passage titled ‘Burying the Past’.
Pay particular attention to all the words in bold letters.
Use clues from the surrounding parts of the words to determine the meaning of the words.
First of all, suggest the clues and then give the meaning of the words as brought out by the clues.
Remember, your meanings must fit into the passage.
Use the table below to bring out the answers to this exercise.
Words Clues from the passage that suggest The meaning of the meaning words Burying The Past It seems as if Africa’s snoring giant has woken up from deep slumber.
With General Abdulsalam Abubakar’s assumption of power in June , following the death of military head of state Sani Abacha, the atmosphere in Nigeria has lightened perceptibly.
Paradoxically, renaissance has sprung from death.
Not simply Abacha's, but that of Moshood Abiola, the man believed by many to have won the annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993.
While millions mourned his death following a fatal heart attack in prison in July 1998, many felt that it had somehow closed a chapter in the country's history, allowing the possibility of fresh beginning.
Some things have certainly changed.
The new general appears to be a softer incarnation of the standard model Nigerian leader.
He is prepared to listen, to accommodate differing opinions.
He even smiles.
But he is still a general and the military fatigues remain the same shade of khaki.
The giant may be stirring, but things will have to change an awful lot more -and irrevocably -before it rises.
157 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I One of Abubakar's first actions, after boosting his popularity by freeing a number of political prisoners, was to postpone the hand-over of power to civilian rule which had been scheduled to take place in October this year.
He replaced Abacha's promise with a new one of his own.
Oh dear, business as usual then….
Promises are exceedingly cheap in Nigeria, especially if they fall from the mouth of a head of state.
Generals Muhammadu Buhari and Ibrahim Babangida made them and broke them.
Many people, though, have gone ahead and accepted Abubakar's sincerity about the coming of a seismic political change opting to give him the benefit of the doubt.
But then again, they have no choice.
The hand-over will now involve a series of elections culminating in a presidential poll on February 27, 1999.
Despite the caution and the misgivings, there is palpable air of optimism.
People are getting used to being able to say what they think publicly, without expecting a policeman to cart them off to prison.
The media is also pushing the boundaries of freedom of speech.
If a journalist wants to call a former head of state a swindler who brought the country to brink of ruin, he or she is free to do so.
There is a sense in which Abubakar and his Provisional Ruling Council are genuinely trying to implement changes.
He has started building bridges across the geopolitical divide, inviting the mainly Lagos-based pro-democracy activists to the capital, Abuja, to hear what they have to say.
The group spearheading this agitation, the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), has grudgingly accepted the transition timetable.
Abubakar has restored diplomatic relations with Canada, re-established air link with Britain and the United.
States, and has earned Nigeria the goodwill of the international community.
An Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been set up, with both party and voter registration beginning in earnest.
So far there have been more than one hundred political associations jostling for recognition.
And Scores of politicians have been swarming around Abuja.
There's a real buzz.
One of the main reasons for Abubakar's popularity, it seems, is that he happens not to be Abacha who is now openly and roundly reviled.
According to Rasheed Gbadamosi, the recently installed Minister for National Planning in Abubakar's new cabinet- ‘‘The current military regime is different from those who wielded power in the last four or five years.
They thought they had a monopoly of everything.
I think we are now enjoying a breath of fresh air’’.
Of Course, someone with a smart new job is likely to say such flattering things, but it is a sentiment which is echoing through many quarters.

4.0 CONCLUSION The effort in this unit is to expose you to some of the ways you can deduce meaning of words from the context.
The unit has also emphasised the importance of acquiring new words, daily.
Without reading widely, it may be difficult for you to acquire new words.
160  5.0 SUMMARY This unit has exposed you to: • the importance of gaining new words • how to find the meaning of a word by word attack and • how to find meanings of words by searching round the passage.
In the next unit, effort will be intensified to expose you to more ways of finding meanings of words in reading passages.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Read the passage below and use the methods taught in this unit to find the meanings of the words that are written in bold letters in the passage.
Write out the meaning in the space provided.
I am deeply committed to real reconciliation with justice for all, and to peaceful change to a more just and open South African society to which tile wonderful riches and wealth of our country will be shared more equitably.
I write to you, Sir, to say with all the eloquence I can command that the security police being given more draconian power to do virtually as they please without being accountable to the courts of our land, courts which have it splendid reputation throughout the world for fairness and justice.
That is why we have called, and continue to call, for the release of all detainees or that they be brought before the courts where they should be punished if they have been guilty of indictable offences.
There is much disquiet in our land that people can be held for such long periods in detention and then often either released without be.ing charged or, when charged usually acquitted; but this does not free them from police harassment.
Though declared innocent by the courts, they are often punished by being banned or placed under house arrest or immediately re-detained.
How long can a people bear such blatant injustice and suffering?
Much of the White community by and large, with all its prosperity, its privilege, its beautiful homes, its servants, its leisure, is bogged down by the fear and sense of insecurity.
And this will continue to be the case until South Africans of all races are free.
Freedom is indivisible.
The whites in this land will not be free until all sections of our community are genuinely free.
Then we will have a security that does not require such astronomical sums to maintain, huge funds which could have been used in far more creative arid profitable ways for the good of our whole community, demonstrating as it will that people of different races can live, amicably, together.
We need one 161 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I another, and Blacks have tried to assure Whites that they don't want to drive them into the sea.
How long can they go on giving these assurances and have them thrown back in their faces with contempt?

Two main strategies were discussed.
The first was the use of word attack, while the second was searching around the surrounding of the passage for clues.
I think you are now practising these strategies.
In this unit, you are further exposed to other ways meanings can be found from reading comprehension passages.
Among the strategies to be discussed in this unit are the use of lexical familiarisation and your past experiences.
The importance of a dictionary is also discussed towards the end of the unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • read and determine the meaning of new words using lexical familiarisation strategy • read and discover the meaning of new words using your past experiences • use your dictionary effectively in finding meanings of new words.
163 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Finding Meanings of Words by Identifying Lexical Familiarisation What do we mean by lexical familiarisation?
By lexical familiarisation we mean words that are similar related or familiar to the words that we are trying to determine their meanings.
Writers, in an attempt to give the reader sufficient understanding of the meaning of a newly introduced word, supply some words around the new word that are related or belong to the same field or family of the new word.
Lexical familiarisation strategy is a deliberate intention on the part of the writer to give the reader sufficient words that will lead to sufficient understanding of the meaning of the newly introduced term, in order to enable the reader to continue to read the text with confidence.
Let's practise this using a real passage.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Go through the passage titled ‘Nigeria’s Past and Enviable Position’.
Use the clues supplied through the bubbles and arrows presented in the passage to derive the meanings of the following words.
In most cases, the words that are joined together by arrows are related.
Use their relationship to find the meanings of the words.
Here is the list of the words.
1.
Capability____________________________________________ 2.
Stupendous__________________________________________ 3.
Enviable_____________________________________________ 4.
Choke______________________________________________ 5.
Maneuverin__________________________________________ 6.
Commitment__________________________________________ 7.
Trio_________________________________________________ 8.
Ethnic Pluralism_______________________________________ 164  Source: NIGERIA: The State of the Nation and the Way Forward.

You have just 15 minutes for this exercise.
Do not turn to the discussion below until you have completed the exercise.
Have you completed the exercise?
If so, turn to the discussion below.
3.2 Discussion on the Passage Titled ‘‘Nigeria's Past and Enviable Position’’ Do you find the passage interesting?
Yes, you will find it interesting if you know the meanings of many of the difficult words circled in the passage.
Of course, if you do not know the meanings of many of the words, understanding the passage becomes difficult.
Interestingly enough, the writers used words that are related or belong to the same family.
For example, the words capacity and capability are somehow related.
They all mean ability.
Again, the word stupendous and wealth are related because they all suggest plenty.
Favourable and enviable are 165 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I related.
What you can envy should be what is favourable to you.
The words choke and surplus are quite interesting.
The word choke suggests something crowded or congested.
Thus, from the word surplus that follows, you can guess the meaning of choke to mean crowd.
The word maneuvering is given away by the word manipulation that follows; so also commitment is given away by the earlier suggestion of sincere determination- which can only be exhibited by somebody who is committed to a course.
The word trio is followed by the name of eminent Nigerians- Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Zik.
This suggests that the word trio means three.
Going across paragraphs gives away the expression ethnic pluralism.
Somewhere in the previous paragraph, the writer has referred to Nigeria with multiplicity of her tribes.
Thus, you can easily guess from the previous paragraph that ethnic pluralism suggests multiplicity of tribes.
3.3 Finding Meanings of Words by Using Your Past Experiences Sometimes, your world of experience of the ideas that are discussed in the passage can suggest the meaning of the new words.
Your experiences of the actual word, part of the word or the context in which the word is used, may suggest the meaning of the word to you.
Some words you experienced in your day to day life, some you experienced reading about something similar in another context.
You should, however, be careful.
Some words may have different meanings as they move into another context.
Do not impose the meaning of one word in a particular context upon the meaning of the same word in quite a different context.
However, what we are saying here is that your experience of the word in life or in context similar to the one you are presently reading may suggest the meaning of the word.
Let's practise this SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Read the passage entitled ‘The Rich and The Poor’ The Rich and the Poor Think of the experience you had of the words in bold.
Let your imagination run wide to decide situations which you have experienced all or part of the words.
See whether you can transfer these situations into the passage to assist you in determining the meanings of the words.
166  For example, think of the rich people you have seen in Nigeria, what they do, how they act and how they live.
Think of the poor in Nigeria, especially the beggars.
See how they behave, live and act.
Bring all of these experiences to bear on the passage.
See whether the meanings of the words can he brought out through these experiences.
The Rich and the Poor Can the rich become richer without making the poor poorer as a result?
Can someone be poor and not suffer?
What purpose is served by the rich showing charitable kindness towards the poor?
How do people get rich?
According to one line of thinking, God has created people with differing abilities and skills; the ability to become rich is like any other special skill: and he who becomes rich does so by his own exceptional talent and also by the help of God who has blessed him with wealth; and the poor are poor because they lack innate ability to improve themselves; the rich have a moral and religious duty to promote the security and well being of the poor by giving alms generously to ease their sufferings.
Poverty is, thus, hypothesised as an objective hereditary phenomenon to be pitied, and it exists because God created man in that way.
Contrary to this view, we will argue that the prosperity of the rich cannot be sustained except by continued impoverishment of the majority; that the art of making yourself rich is also the art of keeping your neighbours poor; that whatever is obtained by one is denied to many.
The only exceptional ability that the rich possess is the ability to organize labour as cheaply as possible ill order to maximise profit for rich labour is a threat to the rich man's profit.
The main way in which the rich fulfill their obligation to relieve suffering is by making gift to improve the welfare of some of the poor.
This is inevitable selective and discriminatory generosity which compels the favoured few to be grateful and loyal, while the omitted majority are divided and more effectively controlled as they scramble for the master's scarce favours.
This paternalistic manipulation splinters the oppressed poor into factions, each hoping and struggling to get a few more benefits than the other.
Alms and aid are like a rope that ties the receiver to the donor who benefits.
Gifts and welfare are merely leftovers from the master's table, superficially redistributive gestures which leave inequality intact.
The exploitative social order is a source of false generosity nourished by poverty.

Compare your answers with the ones presented in the discussion below.
Have you completed the exercise?
Good, if you have done so, you are now qualified to turn to the discussion.
3.4 Discussion on the Passage ‘The Rich and the Poor’ Indeed, my experience of life in general has assisted me so much in getting the meanings of the words listed.
See the box below for my responses to the meanings of the words.
Cross check my responses with yours.

If they are, then our world view and experiences are more or less the same.
What is your score on this exercise?
If your score is low try harder.
Let your imagination loose whenever you are reading any material.
See how you can use your past or previous experiences to find clues to the meanings of new words in a reading passage.
3.5 Finding Meanings of Words from a Passage by Using your Dictionary This should be your last resort.
It is a lazy student's approach to always turn to the dictionary for any meaning of a word, every second.
It also slows down your reading speed.
You waste a lot of time finding meanings of words and less time reading extensively; but by all means, when other steps suggested in units 1 and 2 of this module fail, please turn to your dictionary.
A good dictionary will never fail you.
It's the students' best companion.
Indeed, it is your own best companion.
169 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I EXTRACT FROM OXFORD ADVANCED LEARNERS’ DICTIONARY 170  SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Look at the extract from the Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary reproduced above/before now and list in the space provided as many things as you can observe that a dictionary can provide you.
Give an example of each of the information that the dictionary provides.
Use the space provided.
__________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ Have you completed the exercise?
If your answer is yes, then you can turn to the discussion on the use of dictionary provided in the next section.
If your answer is no, do not go to the discussion until you complete the exercise.
3.6 What a Dictionary Can Provide You Outlined in this section is what we can observe from the extract as the kinds of information that a dictionary can give you.
• Alphabetical order of words • Various meanings of a word as used in various contexts (in 1,2,3) • The way the words are pronounced; these are put in slash / / e.g./imbeli∫/embellish The part of speech of the word e.g.
v = for verb; • The context in which the word is used e.g.
(with 5th) meaning with something; • Example of sentences in which the words can be used; • The colloquial usage, if applicable; • Figure of speech and idiomatic (IDM) expressions associated with the word; • Different derivational forms of the word e.g.
embody- embodied- embodiment- 171 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I When you consider so many things that a page of a dictionary can give, you will agree with me that a dictionary is, indeed, your companion.
Use it when the need to do so arises.
You will never regret it.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit is still re-emphasising the importance of vocabulary items.
The word is central to language use and must have lot of them to survive academic life.
I think by now you have been encouraged to read extensively to gain new words.
The unit has further exposed you to ways you can find meanings of word in context and the usefulness of a dictionary.
My hope is that this unit will encourage you to constantly increase your word power.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has taught you the following: • how to find meanings of word by using lexical familiarisation • how to find meanings of words by using your past experiences and • how to use your dictionary.
With this general background to reading for vocabulary development, you are fully prepared for and equipped with the abi1ity to increase your word power.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Read the article titled ‘Development Plans as they Affect Roles of Agriculture’.
Use the strategies suggested in this unit to provide meanings of the words listed after the passage.
Development Plans as they Affect Roles of Agriculture The Ten Year Plan 1946-1956 of the colonial administration has been described as a pseudo-plan as it was designed to provide guideline to enforce administration of the colony.
The first development plan after independence 1962-1968 tried to increase production of export crops through better seed distribution and more modern methods of cultivation, as well as through increased area of cultivation via farm settlements, co- operations plantations, improved farm implements such as hydraulic hand press for extraction of palm oil.
The 1970-74 Development Plan, like the previous plan, hoped to increase per capital output, curb more urban migration and develop 172  agro-industries which were to be located in the urban area: contrary to the intention to curb rural-urban migration.
Total expenditure amounted to N215, 226 million which is 20% of capital expenditure on all sectors.
The continuous fall of agricultural contribution as the result of low investments, lack of executive capacity and inadequate supporting facilities led to the necessity to prepare perspective plan for agricultural development to 1985 in 1974.
The Third National Development Plan 1975-80 envisaged increased supply of food in adequate quantity and quality, expanded production of export crops and diversification of foreign exchange base as well as increased production of raw materials to support domestic industries.
The plan also envisaged increased rural employment opportunities involving appropriate institutional and administrative apparatus to facilitate integrated development of agricultural potential of the whole country.
To achieve the above objective, the state and federal governments were to adopt variety of policy measures relating to price and tax incentive, processing of farm products, rehabilitation and new planting schemes, marketing, man-power training, participation in direct production, extension, use of inputs, research, credit and land use.
This is the list of the words you are to supply their meanings.

173 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I UNIT 4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT IN VARIOUS ACADEMIC CONTEXTS: PART I CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Vocabulary in Various Academic Contexts 3.2 Vocabulary Items Associated with Psychology 3.3 Vocabulary Items Associated with the Legal Field 3.4 Vocabulary Items Associated with the Medical and Paramedical Fields 3.5 Vocabulary Items Associated with Education 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION This broad topic is going to be split into two units.
Unit 4 will treat vocabulary development in psychology, legal, medical and paramedical as well as educational academic contexts; while unit 5 will look at the vocabulary items that are associated with the arts, business administration and science.
As you may probably know, it is not possible for us to expose you to all items of a field.
The attempt is just to introduce you to the field and encourage you to read texts in the field more extensively.
If the field we are treating is your own field, you should not only master the general vocabulary items of the field, but also the highly technical terms associated with the field.
Indeed, you will need the knowledge of the common, technical and highly technical terms associated with your field.
You need these terms to be able to function effectively in the field.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • read and supply vocabulary items typical of a psychology reading passage • read law passage and supply the vocabulary items of the field • read a passage on medical and paramedical field and supply the vocabulary items of the field • read a passage on education and supply vocabulary items associated with the field.
174  3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Vocabulary in Various Academic Contexts As you have learnt in the preceding units, words are central to all academic fields.
Also, academic fields have the words that are specific to each domain.
In fact, the vocabulary items of the world can be classified into two broad categories.
The first one is the categories of words that cut across all fields.
These are called common-core words.
The second category is the sets of words that are specific to a particular field.
This is called the register of the field.
It is important for you to be familiar with the broad-based categories of words that are used in most of the academic contexts you will find yourself during this programme.
More than all these, it is necessary for you to be familiar with words that are specific to your own subject area.
The attempt, in this unit, is to expose you to broad-based categories of words that are used in various fields.
Thus, you will have practice sessions on identifying the meanings of words: • as they change from one academic field to the other • as they cut across field • as they are specific to a particular field.
Of course, let me stress this is point once more- it is not possible to practise all the words that you may come across in all fields.
The effort in this unit is merely to draw your attention to some of these words and leave you to discover more in your private study and reading activities.
Remember, if you want to gain many words, you must be ready to read extensively.
3.2 Vocabulary Items Associated with Psychology Here, you are going start with an exercise.
This exercise exposes you to some vocabulary items that are used in the field of psychology and general sciences.
Use the words and expressions at the beginning of the passage to fill in gaps 1- 32.
Use each word only once.
What is Intelligence?
Complement Entirely Environment Intercultural Competence Mental Conducted Hypothesis Assessment Eccentric Resemble Numerous Categorise Account Formulated Inferred Manipulated Identical Degree Precisely 175 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Unrelated Discrepancies Variation Relevant Deter Reared Accounted for Factors Comparative Attributable Experts Adopted What is intelligence?
Even the 1______________, let alone the layman, are not 2____________ sure about the answer to this question.
Though scientists have different 3__________________ on how to interpret and 4____________ intelligence, some facts, however, have been widely accepted by most of them on the basis of 5_____________ studies 6______________ over the last decades.
It is known that intelligence is 7___________ both to heredity and 8______________, but the genetic 9____________ are more important than the environment ones.
The evidence for the above conclusion was obtained from kinds of studies: a study of 10_____________ twins with the same 11_____________ of genes, 12__________ apart in foster homes; and a study of genetically 13_________ children 14________ at birth and reared together.
From the results the scientists 15_________________ that the biological inheritance of genes 16______________ at least twice as much of the 17______________ in IQ as the environment.
Even if the child does not 18___________ his parents in his 19____________ ability, genetic theory can explain such occasional 20________________ .Therefore such expectations do not invalidate the argument that IQ is inherited more than it is 21_____________________ by the environment.
It is also widely recognised that the 22____________ of intelligence is essentially a 23_____________ affair which creates some problems.
If we want to compare the intellectual 24____________of two individuals, we must be sure, up to a certain 25_____________ of confidence, that they have a similar attitude to the test and that they possess enough 26_________ information as to what is to be done on the test.
But these are 27______________ the factors that vary from culture to culture.
A test question which looks simple and normal to a child in one culture might 28______________a child from another culture who might regard it as indelicate or 29___________.
Moreover, the answers expected by the tester who 30__________the questions might not be the only possible answers in a different cultural setting.
Therefore, all 31___________ comparisons of intelligence should take 32_________ of the limitations of the standard IQ tests.

176  I think by now you have completed the exercise, if you have done so, then congratulations.
Do you find the exercise difficult or easy?
When this was given to some students like you, about three quarters of them found the exercise difficult.
If you find it difficult, it means you are still not reading extensively.
Some of the words illustrated are not too difficult for your level.
What is intelligence?
Even experts, let alone the layman, are not entirely sure about the answer to this question.
Determination to read widely is the only thing that can increase your vocabulary to the level that you will be able to carry out such a task like this without much difficulty.
3.3 Vocabulary Items Associated with the Legal Field Let's expose you to another field, quite different from the one in the exercise above.
This time it is the legal field.
Read the passage below and fill in gaps 1-20 with words and expressions presented below the passage.
Remember that you may not use some words in this exercise.
Vocabulary Items Associated with the Legal Field (a) Judicial 1__________punishment was 2_____________ in England in 194… (b) The parties continued 3_________ for several months before an/a 4_________ for the 5____________ was finally reached.
(c) The 6___________ husband was killed in the accident she caused.
It was found that she was guilty of 7____________, but had not intended to kill the victim.
As a result was convicted of 8______________.
(d) The crown courts 9___________ him to 10___________ for committing assault 11____________ grievous bodily ht1rm.
(e) A state may have to grant 12__________ to victims for 13___________ of its agents abroad.
(f) The UK government refused to 14____________ the accused on the grounds that she was a political offender.
(g) There can be not 15____________ some of the rights protected by the European convention of Human Rights.
(h) 16____________ is a state of being at war.
(i) 17____________ is a breach of law or 18 of a right.
(g) 19____________ is the discussion of terms and conditions to reach an 20_____________ .
177 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I List of words to choose from (You may not use some words and may use some more than once) Infringement, negotiation, settlement, violation, agreement, extradite, concurrently, manslaughter, conspiracy, abolished, corporal, arbitration, assault, 2-year probation, 5-year imprisonment, remand, conflict, reparation, persecutions, repeal of, immunity from, charged, defendant's sentenced, damage caused by criminal acts, I causing, consensus.
I think by now you should have completed the exercise.
Can you say you are familiar with general legal terms?
Of course, there's no reason why you should not be familiar with the common terms related to the legal field.
In fact, this familiarity is one of the ways you can be known to be well-read.
Let's discuss some of the terms.
a.
Judicial corporal punishment was abolished in England in 1948. b.
The parties continued negotiation for several months before a consensus for the reparation was finally reached.
c. The defendant's husband was killed in the accident she had caused.
It was found that she was guilty, of conspiracy but had not intended to kill the victim.
As a result she was convicted of manslaughter.
If you go by the words that you require to fill the gap, you will recognise that only a few of them are really technical.
The bulk of them are words that are common to the legal profession which educated people should really be familiar with.
3.4 Vocabulary Items Associated with the Medical and Paramedical Fields Again, this is a very wide field that cannot be covered within the context of one unit of a course.
Just like all other academic fields, the medical field has common and technical terms.
The common-core terms should be known by all educated groups like you.
Of course, the technical ones, definitely, must be reserved for people in the field.
The passage in the next exercise exposes you to some of the general terms typical of medical and paramedical sciences.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the passage below and fill in the gaps with relevant words provided at the end of the passage.
Anesthetics are 1____________ causing 2___________ or 3__________ relief to pain.
Their use in modern medicine permits 178  painless 4____________ of a minutes duration.
Anesthetics are divided into two broad groups 5____________________ and 6_____________ones; the former causes 7________________ unconsciousness by temporarily altering normal activities of 8___________; while the later temporarily deaden 9_____________ of a particular area of the body.
General anesthetics are usually administered to the patient in one of two ways; 10____________________ or 11_______________ injection.
Several important drugs are used as general anesthetics.
12__________ first used by Dr Crawford W. Long (1842) is a powerful anesthetics.
So also is 13____________ a gas inhaled in combination with oxygen.
A much weaker general anesthetics is 14______________ or 15______________ gas.
16_____________ is a new synthetic general anesthetic, more powerful and effective.
It is 17___________ into the body in a 18__________ amounts with a 19_________ apparatus.
Not all surgery requires that the 20___________ be unconscious.
List of Words to Choose from Fluothame, chloroform, drugs, unconsciousness, patients, surgery, hospitalization, broad, total, temporary, central nervous system, local, inhalation, ether, sensation, intravenous, powerful liquid, cyclopropane, ethylene, nitrous oxide, smiling, laughing, calibrated, injected, inhaled, tluothene, measured, booster, general, painkilling, soft effective.
Are you familiar with many of the words?
Words like unconsciousness, patients, surgery hospitalisation, ensured, injected and drugs are common medical terms which should be known by all educated people.
Of course, there are some technical terms such as cyclopropane, fluothene and chloroform that are specific to the medical and paramedical profession.
3.5 Vocabulary Items Associated with Education This section familiarises you with some common terms associated with education.
In most cases the words are common-core words in the profession.
The next exercise presents this field to you.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the passage below and fill in the gaps with words presented at the bottom of the passage.
The importance of this exercise is to introduce you to some of the vocabulary items associated with education.
Do not turn to the answer until you finish performing the tasks.
The title of the passage is ‘Primary Education’.
179 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Primary Education Primary education is the 1___________ and the largest 2_____________ of all levels of education which may be 3____________ 4___________ and 5__________.
Unfortunately, the primary schools are an eye sore.
This is because of 6__________ building inadequate 7___________ and lack of meaningful 8___________from public/community.
The government pronouncements of 9____________________ and 10_____________ education could only be meaningful if the community is encouraged to participate in the 11___________, 12____________, and 13____________, of the 14____________.
The provision of some education is not to our advantage, especially where 15_______________ are the 16________________of the centralising authority.
Constant major 17_____________ changes are doing a lot of havoc to the education system.
We need to settle down to real business of providing sound and well 18_______________that will facilitate growth and 19____________ of primary education that is worthy of 20_________________.
List of words to choose from Institution, counterparts, dilapidated, foundation, funding, sustained, policy, secondary, expenditure, free, tertiary, statistics, participation, equipment, furniture, maintenance, compulsory, synonymous, finances, centralised; appointments, policy, initiative, emulation, sector, prerogative, primary, equipping, development.
Have you completed the exercise?
Now turn to the end of the unit for the answers.
As you go through the passage, you would have noticed some common words like institution, funding, development, tertiary, secondary, participation, foundation, etc., are commonly used in relation to education.
Also there are some words such as counterparts, free, equipping, centralised, equipment, etc., which are not restricted to the field of education but that can be used across academic fields.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this first part of the units dealing with vocabulary associated with academic fields, you have been exposed to various items in the fields of psychology, legal, medical and paramedical as well as education.
The essence of the exercise is to introduce you to these fields and encourage you to read materials in the field more extensively.
180  5.0 SUMMARY You must have learnt the following in this unit: • vocabulary items associated with psychology • vocabulary items associated with legal field • vocabulary items associated with medical and paramedical field and • vocabulary items associated with education.
The unit is preparing you for extensive reading activities that are expected to increase your vocabulary power.
The next unit will reinforce what you have learnt in this unit by exposing you to more vocabulary items in other areas.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Complete the following exercise with words from the list below.
Use each word only once.
Affirmed undisciplined function interest dormant Regimen compel liable promote extent Restricted cultivate designed applied suppressed Rigorously devise disguises deliberately challenged Advocating refining contends deprived seductive Discounting enduring Philosophers and educationists have been 1___________ different approaches to the role of art in education.
Plato 2_________ that since art is an expression of the emotional and 3____________ part of our nature, it must be 4___________ control1ed and even 5____________ discouraged in the 6____________ of rational ideals.
According to Plato's rational philosophy of life, education was 7____________ to constrain and direct youth towards what has been 8____________ by the law as right, to develop youth's super-ego.
Art, being sensuous and 9____________,would be a deviation from the rational regimen.
Plato does not, however, compel the educator to ban art altogether.
Art is useful to children who are incapable of 10____________ serious training and are 11____________ to revolt against it.
Art will 12____________ as a sweet that 13____________ the bitterness of a necessary medicine.
Plato's philosophy has often been 14______________ by educators who have tried to 15____________all for its own sake.
They have claimed that though the number of professional artists should be 181 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 16____________, almost no person should be 17____________ of training in the appreciation of the arts.
Anesthetic impulses, they say, are possessed by children and merely 18____________ in educated people.
Therefore, the educator can 19____________ means of preserving and 20____________ these instincts and thus develop the person's emotional responses to beauty.
Educating the instincts implies 21____________ the basic values of the classical.

Can you still remember this?
It is vocabulary development as it relates to the field of psychology, law, medical and paramedical sciences.
This unit deals with vocabulary in the related field of arts, accounting and sciences.
You will enjoy this unit.
The challenge the unit throws, I am sure, will encourage you to read widely and not just reading what belongs to your field alone.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • read and supply vocabulary items typical of the arts • read and identify the vocabulary items typical of the field of accounting • read and identify the vocabulary items typical of the sciences.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Vocabulary Items Associated with the Arts Let's start this unit with an academic field that is quite different from the ones discussed in unit 4.
This is the field of the arts, or humanities, as some people call it.
Generally speaking, the arts have a few vocabulary items that are restrictive to the field.
In most cases, the vocabulary can be used across other academic fields.
Thus, we can say that the arts have a large number of common-core vocabulary items.
183 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I History is taken as a representative sample of the field.
The self- assessment exercise below requires you to complete the passage with some of the terms that are supplied at the beginning of the passage.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Complete the following passage with the appropriate words from the list supplied before the passage.
Use each word only once.
The title of the passage is ‘History and the Historians’.
History and the Historians arbitrary however unavailable defective take it for granted raw recorded pattern survived particular lacunae supremely accuracy subjectivity determined preserving attribution appeal indestructible available It is true that 1___________ is a necessary condition of the historian's work, but it is not his essential function.
The basic facts belong to the category of 2___________ materials of the historian than of history itself.
Besides, the necessity to establish these basic facts rests on an 3___________ decision of the historian.
Let us take, as an example, ancient history.
We 4___________ that al1 the facts about this period are recorded in 5___________ literature.
The truth is, 6___________ that this is only a selection of facts which 7___________ by accident or process of 8___________ and the historical picture, seen as a whole, may be inaccurate.
The problem of this 9___________ picture consists not only of the 10___________ which start ancient history, but also of the 11___________ of historians, scribes and chroniclers.
These people 12___________facts they thought were worth 13___________ .Those facts supported their 14________________ views and were 15_____________ important to them, but were not necessarily so to other people in those times.
A mass of other facts relevant to the picture of history is simply 16___________ to us today: .Therefore the 17___________ of the past is 18___________ it has been 19___________ for us beyond the possibility of 20___________ .
Have you completed the filling in the gaps?
If you have, I congratulate you.
Now turn to the end of the unit to compare your answers with the ones supplied there.
Mark your work and determine how well you perform in the exercise.
184  Did you find the passage difficult?
If you did, I will advise you to read more extensively.
You will agree with me that some of the words are common-core words that you should have read extensively.
Let me fill the first three gaps of the passage for illustration.
It is true that accuracy is a necessary condition of the historians work, but it is not his essential function.
The basic facts belong to the category of raw materials of the historian than of history itself.
Besides, the necessity to establish these basic facts rests on an arbitrary decision of the historian.
You will notice that although words like accuracy, raw, and arbitrary may be associated with history or art-based courses, they can also be used in other fields.
What this means is that if you are well-read, you are likely going to be fully equipped to tackle all reading materials that are arts-based.
3.2 Vocabulary Items Associated with Accounting As in the case of other academic fields discussed so far, accounting is wide and broad-based.
The exercise you are going to perform in this section will only give you a slight touch of the field.
You need to read extensively to be able to grasp the different vocabulary items of the field, especially the highly technical ones.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the passage below and fill in gaps 1-20 with appropriate words and expressions listed below the passage.
The title of the passage is ‘The Role of Accountants’.
The Role of Accountants The 1___________ function of the Chief Accountant is to ensure that 2___________ funds available for such capital 3___________ on new plant and equipment as is required in the corporate plan.
Adequate working capital will also be required to meet 4___________ expenditure such as 5___________ salaries, purchase of raw materials and inevitable administrative expenses.
Whenever 6___________ or salaries are made 7 ___________will need to be kept.
In many ways, the accountants are like a 8___________ telling you what has happened since the 9___________ commenced.
On 3rd April, we 10___________ a new mainframe 11___________ for N75,000 and so on.
The data tells the 12___________ what 13___________ are at their disposal and what 14___________ they have to be prepared to meet.
By 15___________ 185 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I the accountant, managers can see how much 16___________ is available, how much they owe to their 17___________ and how much they are owed by their 18___________ They must also be in the position to meet their commitments if 19___________ is to be avoided.
The accountants make a 20___________ contribution to the decision making process.
Lists of words to chose from records, business, corporate, purchase, expenditure, revenue mechanism, adequate, cheaper, statistical, continuous, corrective, primary, wages, debtors, vital, accuracy, solutions, assets, purchases, storybook, examining, computer, insolvency, deduction, possible, answered, problems, creditors.

I hope you enjoyed going through the exercise.
If you did, it means that you are already displaying your extensive reading ability.
If you are finding this exercise difficult, you need to read more widely.
Some of the words that are somehow typical of accounting procedures are- corporate, revenue, purchase, insolvency, debtors and creditors.
Words like continuous, corrective, vital, primary, records and so on, can be used in other fields other than accounting; in most cases, their meanings may change.
3.3 Vocabulary Items Associated with Natural Science Science is another broad-based field that you must be conversant with.
This is because the entire word is going more and more scientifically and technologically-oriented.
No matter your area of specialisation, a rudimentary knowledge of science is demanded of you.
In the next exercise you will be introduced to some scientific terms.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the passage titled ‘The Importance of Mathematics’ and fill in the gaps 1-20.
186  The Importance of Mathematics (a) Not only physics but every 1___________ depends on the 2.
___________of mathematics.
For every science required the exact 3___________and the ability to work out 4___________and find 5___________whether you are interested in 6___________, discovering the structure of 7___________learning what causes 8___________ and prosperity in 9___________, finding new 10___________ for disease, 11___________swifter airplanes or learning the 12___________of the stars, you will need the language of mathematics.
(b) The process of 13___________ consists of a series of steps: 14___________ water to a boiling point 15___________it and collecting the 16___________in a container for 17___________.
(c) Civil engineering deals with the design and 18___________of 19___________that are intended to be 20___________.
Lists of words to choose from distillation, fermenting, condensing, purification, hydraulic, environmental, construction, fluids, stationary, objects structure, system, science, measurement, rules, problems, molecules, cunes, splitting, atoms depressions, designing business life story, heating product, modification, conclusion.
Now that you have completed the exercise, I can share my experience of working with the passage with you.
Like you, I found words like distillation, depressions, environmental, fluids, fermenting, etc., scientific, but they can also assume other meanings in some fields.
Words like conclusion, business, heating, condensing and so on, can have scientific and non-scientific meanings, depending on the contexts in which they are used.
4.0 CONCLUSION The attempt in this unit and the previous one is to introduce you to words of different academic fields.
The exercise is aimed at achieving three objectives.
First, it is to expose you to many other fields other than your own.
Secondly, it is to build in you the need to read extensively.
Thirdly, the exercise is aimed at making it clear to you that words can change their academic contexts to the other.
187 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 5.0 SUMMARY You will agree with me that this unit is a continuation of the previous unit.
It has exposed you to different vocabulary items associated with some academic fields.
More specifically, this unit has taught general vocabulary items associated with: • arts • accounting • natural sciences.
I hope you will cultivate the habit of reading extensively, and you will read even materials that are not in your field.
This is the only way you can truly increase your vocabulary power and be regarded as truly educated.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Complete the following passage with words from the list provided at the beginning of the passage.
Use each word only once.

Narrative texts will be the first type of texts to be discussed in this series.
You are to study their characteristic feature and analyse some narrative texts in this unit.
In order to study the unit successfully, you will need a dictionary, paper and a writing instrument.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At end of this unit, you should be able to: • define narrative texts • identify the features of narrative texts • read and analyse clearly some selected narrative texts.
190  3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Narrative Texts Perhaps the most common of all the texts you will find yourself reading from time to time are narrative texts.
Narrative texts are common because they tell stories and many people like interesting stories.
This section introduces you to narrative texts.
Of course, there are different types of narrative texts.
Some tell a sad (or tragic) story, while some make you laugh.
Some stories are written in form of novels, these are called long stories.
Some are also written in short forms.
They are called short stories.
You need to read stories in order to increase your reading speed and comprehension rate.
Stories also give you various experiences about life.
Such experiences include joy, sadness, conflict, destruction, suffering, affluence, greed, avarice, and so on.
The experiences portrayed by stories often develop in form of the theme of the story or novel.
Reading of stories can also increase your vocabulary power.
From stories you come across many words and expressions which become part and parcel, of you as you read extensively.
3.2 Characteristics of Narrative Texts 1.
Narrative texts range from the ones written in an extremely informal style, full of slangs and colloquialisms, to the semi- formal or less formal ones.
In most cases, narratives are not formal except a role is given to character who speaks in a formal style.
2.
All narratives are to follow a storyline, starting with the background to the story, the plot i.e.
the unfolding of the plan or an outline of events in a novel; the climax which is the most exciting or important event or point in the story.
The climax is often referred to as the most exciting part of a story.
A story line ends with the fall or the final part of the story where all events have been fully unfolded and nothing more so exciting.
3.
A good narrative keeps the reader in suspense.
Thus, when you become accustomed to reading an interesting story, you hardly want to drop the book until you finish reading it.
This is because you want the suspense created to be unfolded.
For example, a story may start with a mystery surrounding a particular episode or event.
As you go through the story line, the mystery is gradually being unfolded until you come to the end and it becomes no mystery again.
191 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 4.
A narrative follows a sequential order.
The events may be organised in chronological order (of time), order of importance or the end of seriousness of the event.
5.
Explanation does not form the major part of a story, except when a particular character is invited in the story to give an explanation of a particular event or situation.
6.
Vividness (making all characters and events real), clarity, interesting episodes, imagination are all qualities of a story.
7.
In storytelling, exaggerations, untrue events, fables are acceptable.
Now that we have briefly outlined the major characteristics of the narrative, we will expose you to some narratives.
Our aim is to analyse some of these stories to bring out some of the characteristics we have outlined above.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the story titled ‘I Have Found You a Girl’ by Gideon Tseja and answer the questions that follow.
Remember you are supposed to read this story at average reading speed.
I Have Found You a Girl It was Silas who walked up to Steven one day and said unceremoniously, “I have found you a girl”.
“You have found me a girl?
I did not tell you that I wanted a girl,” said Steven without much enthusiasm.
‘'Every boy needs a girl,” replied Silas dismissively.
''You will like her.
She is beautiful.
Fair-skinned, like you.” When Steven did not make further comments, he continues.
''Her name is Margaret.
She is also called Linda.
She is going to form one at WTC, Kabba; same school with my girl, Becky.
I tell you, you will like her.
Pretty, young.''
The boisterous Silas left as abruptly as he had come, to chase some more girls, no doubt.
Steven did not dwell on what his cousin had told him.
Instead, he wondered about him.
He was always like this.
He always had a way with women.
Considerably shorter than him, stocky and dark skinned, Silas had always been attractive to women.
He was like a magnet that pulled them irresistibly to him.
As to the girl he said he had found for him, well, he would have to see.
It might turn out that the girl was not his type at all.
At Silas's insistence, Steven agreed to, at least, see the girl.
But there was no question of his going to her family house.
How was he going to explain his presence in a house he was not used to visiting?
192  One day Steven was walking towards his house in the company of Silas.
Suddenly Silas grabbed his arm excitedly and pointed.
There at a road junction near the motor park, and talking with another girl whom Steven recognised as Christie Alaaga, was a beautiful girl about fifteen years old.
''That's the girl I was telling you about'' said Silas conspiratorially.
His cousin was right, thought Steven.
She was very beautiful, petit and fair- skinned.
He noticed his heart was beating faster.
By now they had caught up with the girls, and Silas in that characteristically easy way he had with women, introduced Steven to the young women.
Turning his attention to Margaret, he said, ''this fine boy is going to be your husband''.
Margaret giggled with some embarrassment, and Steven, while keeping a calm exterior, felt awkward and was all jelly inside.
His tongue suddenly felt dry as he muttered something to the effect that it was nice to meet her.
Silas kept the foursome together for a while with his witty, mischievous jokes, and the girls finally left after a promise to see Steven again was extracted from the giggling little girl.
She was on her way to see her uncle to inform him that she was going to college at Kabba.
''Now, what do you think?''
enquired Silas triumphantly.
''She's o.k.''
answered Steven, feigning lack of interest.
''She's o.k.'
that's all you can say?
Come on.
Admit it.
She is beautiful, and you know it'' Silas winked at his cousin mischievously.
Steven merely smiled, but did not contradict him.
Yes, Steven would definitely like to see her again.
With Silas' help, a meeting was arranged for them in a friend's house - there was still no question of his visiting her in her house.
In spite of the new ideas about romantic love, Steven felt more comfortable in the traditional way of courtship where the role of the families was of paramount importance.
One wrong step in the way the parents were brought into the picture and the courtship was over even before it had a chance to get under way.
At the next meeting, Silas and others made discreet exits, leaving Steven and Margaret alone for the first time in their lives.
There was awkward silence, as Margaret kept her eyes fixed on the floor while the eighteen- year-old boy stole furtive glances at her.
He was the man and was expected to take charge of the situation.
He cleared his throat which had suddenly developed a lump in it.
'Em ...I must ask you one question, and please answer me truthfully.'
Margaret kept her gaze on the floor.
''Do you ...do you have a boyfriend?''
193 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I ''No, I do not have a boyfriend,'' answered Margaret faintly but without hesitation.
She, too, had developed a lump in her throat.
''I am asking because ...because, I am not in the business of competing with anybody for a girl'' Suddenly, he was no longer bashful.
''I have no time for this boyfriend -girlfriend business.
I want to marry you, so if you already have a boyfriend, I am out!''
Nothing in her younger life had prepared her for this kind of blunt wooing.
Already, she had read some romantic novels.
Modern courtship was supposed to be gentle and dream-like.
But this man ...straight to the point If you have a boyfriend, then that's it!
What sort of men is this?
These thoughts went through Margaret's mind.
Strangely, as she might have expected, she was not revolted by the approach.
She was rather intrigued.
She discovered she liked a man who knew exactly what he wanted.
She stole a quick glance at him before resuming her fixed gaze on the floor.
What a handsome man!
She thought.
Barely audibly, he repeated herself, ''No, I do not have a boyfriend.''
''That's settled then.
I'll marry you'', concluded Steven with a finality that left no room for any contradiction.
For the rest of the holidays, they occupied each other's attention and time.
Margaret would visit Steven's house, at first in the company of friends and then more and more on her own.
But she did not go there to stay with Steven.
Rather she stayed with Ma Mary and helped her with chores around the house.
She went because of Steven, but she stayed with the mother.
That is the way of African traditional courtship -the best way to a man's heart is through the mother.
Steven still did not, at first, visit her in her family house, but his sisters and female relations did frequently.
By the next holidays, Ma Mary had become very fond of Margaret.
One day, she called her son and said.
''That girl is a very good girl.
I think she is right for you''.
Steven merely smiled.
''I know the family.
They are very good people.
I will start talking to them,'' concluded Mama Mary.
Steven did not say anything which was another way of saying yes.
Meanwhile, Steven had decided by the end of 1996 to stay on in St. Paul's and do the sixth form.
From now he would spend the bulk of his holidays in Gboko.
Now, this town had become the centre of his life after spending his early childhood in northern towns.
It held the two great loves of his life -his mother and his wife-to-be.

Have you been able to get the main points of the story?
If you have not I will advise you to read the story again, carefully and possibly at a slower space to get all the details.
You should also consult your dictionary for 194  the meanings of unfamiliar words.
Besides, try to guess the meaning of the words or phrases from the contexts in which they occur.
If you think you have understood the passage you can now answer the comprehension questions.
Your answers will later on be cross-checked with the ones that will be given in the discussion.
You should not turn to the discussion until you have completed the assignment.

3.3 Discussion of ‘I Have Found You a Girl’ You will agree with me that this story contains all the elements of a narrative.
Characterisation is very vivid, real and quite intensely portrayed.
From the behaviours, utterances and interactions with other characters, Silas could be said to be a womaniser ''attractive to women'', a boy who will never give up, (insisting Steven meets the girl), cunning (his witty, mischievous jokes).
It is also possible to determine Steven's character in the story: Steven is a bit timid, tough inside; he is a pretender (liked Margaret but does not want to show it); poor at wooing a girl: started wooing with ‘Do you have a boyfriend?’ The narration is informal because of the use of words like now she’s ok, that's all, the conversational style, etc.
All these are typical of a narrative essay.
The story line of ‘I have Found You a Girl’ starts with Silas tempting Steven with a girl→Steven's gradually succumbing→Steven wooing the girl→ intimacy→parental interference.
Remember all narratives must have a storyline.
196  Suspense- we are in suspense as to what will happen to the relationship between Steven and Margaret.
Will it be cordial or break?
Suspense is, indeed a characteristic feature of a narrative.
Sequential order- this is clearly defined in the story.
The order is: insinuation of a girl by Silas • Steven meeting the girl • Steven wooing the girl • Acceptance • Intimacy • The coming of the mother into the affair.
Again, all narratives should follow a particular sequential order of events.
Stylistic features of ‘I have Found You a Girl’ • Vividness- she is beautiful, fair skinned-one can easily visualise Margaret through the description.
• Interesting episode- Margaret meeting Silas and Steven and the mischievous way Silas hands over Margaret to Steven.. • The romantic episode- where Steven woos Margaret.
Imagination- the whole story may be largely imaginative.
There might not have been a situation like the one described here, in real life.
Judging from all of the analyses done above, you will agree with me that ‘I have Found You a Girl’ qualifies for an interesting narrative.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Narrative should always have a theme, that is, the central idea being pursued, read I have Found You a Girl again and suggest a theme for the story.
I know you are finding the story more interesting as you read it the second time.
What theme can you work into the story?
How do you determine the theme of a story?
You look for the ideas, expressions or words that are re-occurring several times in the story or novel.
In this story, you will agree with me that the idea of love occurs different times.
Let's look at the story for this: • found a girl • needs a girl 197 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I • my girl • had a way with women • do you have a boyfriend?
And many more.
All of these suggest lust or love for women.
Thus, we can call the theme of the story the feeling of love, romantic life of youthful days, and youthful exuberance kind of love affair.
A final word for you- one of the greatest benefits of reading extensively is to gain new words.
Read the story again and search for the meaning of words that are new to you.
Get their meanings and use them when necessary.
Let them become part and parcel of your life.
4.0 CONCLUSION Narratives are possibly the most interesting of the diverse reading texts you are likely to come in contact with.
You should form the habit of reading stories, preferably novels, if you have not been reading them.
Novels are interesting.
They enliven your spirit.
Please form the habit of reading them.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have been exposed to narratives.
You must have learnt: • what narratives are • the characteristics of narratives • How to analyse a narrative work.
You will be learning other different kinds of textual materials in the subsequent units.

What are the characteristics of a narrative story that could be found in the passage?
List these with examples______________ ____________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ Enemies Everywhere William Wallis WE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP under a mango tree watching the dawn rise over the River Congo.
The long grass whispering in a breeze, as the river lumbered by in golden light, had provided an irresistible lullaby.
The soldiers on frontier duty were too busy receiving rations to find us a worry and we were too seduced by the larger picture to find them threatening.
But recruits from the Presidential Guard who swung by on patrol saw in the admittedly unusual sight of two white men sleeping on the river banks, the making of a subversive mission to destroy Laurent Kabila's first anniversary in power.
It was hopeless to explain that we were just two friends profiting from the quiet of dawn to prepare for the stress of another Kinshasa day.
We were labeled 'suspect' -an excuse for unlimited prison terms in President Kabila's Congo-and carted off in an army pick-up.
It used to be, in the latter days of the former Mobutu regime, that if a soldier barked at you, you could bark back or growl the name of a general: five times out often he would withdraw.
If not, a bank-note would usually send him off in search of other prey.
But something less predictable had got hold of Kinshasa.
It had become impossible to tell if the gun in your face was just for show.
Often man with the gun saw a conspiracy in your helpful smile and felt inclined to blow it away.
The 199 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I tolerance and humour which always seemed to characterise life under Mobutu's rule - even at the toughest time -had evaporated.
And so it was that we - two journalists short of a story -got an exclusive tour of one of the more sinister detention centers that had sprung up in the mansions deserted last year when Mobutu and his henchmen fled a successful bid to end their rule.
Once a luxury apartment block belonging to Mobutu's uncle Litho, the building now housed an assortment of security services and prisoners ranging from simple 'suspects' to ministers fallen from favour and aid workers deemed spies.
Outside there was a rabble of men in track-suits armed with pistols, red-eyed teenage soldiers and sharp-suited officials with the glint of sadists.
From under closed doors, the smell of torture and deprivation seeped out.
And there was the inevitable interrogation: a humourless young man probing every aspect of our dawn excursion and the lives that led up to it.
Luckily, he decided he had other more important detainees to deal with and let us leave, equipped with a new impression of how things were falling apart.
The scene, we decided, smacked more of a regime in its death throes than the year-old administration of a president who had overthrown his predecessor to almost universal applause.
Instead of building on consensus, they were recruiting misfits to beat the people into line.
Where a problem emerged, their answer was to lock up its perceived author.
Sooner or later things were going to explode.
Now they have.
Several of President Kabila's senior aides told me how, in the late stages of their rebellion, a debate had raged over the relative merits of marching on Kinshasa and seeing off Mobutu, or holding back in the territory they had already won with ease.
From Lubumbashi in the south, some advised, they could have f negotiated a more solid political entry into the troublesome capital than the military one they ultimately chose.
'We were afraid Kinshasa, which had a reputation as viper's nest of political squabbles and corruption, could unravel our alliance,' said one of them.
Their fears were well-founded.
Once in Kinshasa, it proved impossible to combine the interests of a nation on the bread-line with those of regional backers such as the Rwandans, who were perceived by the local population as having expansionist designs.
Fractious politicians, with irreconcilable agendas, added to a growing sense of paranoia.
And if you imagine enemies everywhere, eventually they become real.
It is a symbolic blow to President Kabila that a man he imprisoned for holding a news conference, emerged as one of the leaders of a new revolt.
200  When Z'Ahidi Ngoma was shown on state television after being captured following a prison escape last year, the Congolese were truly shocked.
The new government was not only failing to distinguish itself from its predecessor, but it was brazen enough to display the evidence: the former law professor was manacled, close to starving and showed visible signs of having been tortured.
It was another public relations disaster in a country thirsty for freedom.
I have often wondered whether Kabila decided it was easier to copy Mobutu than to create a new style of leadership.
The personality cult, the repression and corruption, the juggling of foreign alliances, even the same advisor who gave Mobutu his image as emperor-none of it seemed to have changed.
And now, the same consequences.
It is almost surreal to be watching Kabila face a Rwandan-backed rebellion starting in the east as Mobutu did when I first arrived in Kinshasa two years ago, to hear the same Rwandan denials of involvement and to witness the same xenophobic government-inspired witch-hunts.
It is a time to settle scores and there are enough of them to ensure that the dream of a rosy dawn for Congo remains just that.

In the unit, you will be introduced to what expository texts are, their characteristics and the analysis of sample expository texts.
Pay attention to the contents of this unit.
This is because expository texts are, possibly, the commonest reading materials that you will be coming across in your various academic activities.
If you know how to tackle the texts, then you have a very powerful academic tool.
As you go through the unit, draw special attention to how expository reading passages are presented.
The way they are presented does not only assist you to read them more efficiently, it also prepares you for writing such texts.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define, clearly, what expository texts are • identify the various characteristics of expository texts • analyse sample expository texts.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Features of Expository Texts In the last unit, you were introduced to narrative texts.
Can you still remember the characteristic features of narrative reading texts?
I think you can remember.
Narrative texts are informal, they follow a particular 202  story line, they keep the reader in suspense; they are ordered in a sequential manner and could be very vivid and imaginative.
In this section of the unit, I will introduce you to expository texts.
By expository texts we mean reading texts that explain an issue, a theory, a concept, or plan, using a good work of art.
Expository reading materials do not tell story; they explain concepts.
Now that you have known what we mean by expository texts, let's outline as briefly as possible their characteristics.
1.
Expository texts are more formal than narrative texts.
In most cases, abbreviation, contractions, (such as don't, isn't and haven't), conversational style and colloquialisms which may feature in narrative texts are limited in expository texts.
2.
Expository texts do not tell stories.
They discuss issues, concepts and plans and give reasons to support any viewpoint.
3.
Expository texts are organised in logical, sequential order.
The order is, usually, in terms of the sequence of ideas being discussed.
4.
Expository texts explain.
The explanations are in clear-cut terms.
They are vivid, interesting and well thought out.
Some good writers present ideas like a piece of onion.
They unfold them bit by bit, one after the other.
5.
Expository texts are supposed to be factual.
Truths are to be guarded, very jealously.
All points are to be supported with concrete evidences.
In most cases, you avoid exaggerations, lies, illogicality and clumsiness in expository texts.
Can you still remember the five points given about expository texts?
They are points that you must bear in mind as you read this kind of texts.
3.2 Analysis of Sample Expository Texts Let's analyse some expository texts, using the characteristic features presented in the previous section.
203 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Read the passage entitled ‘The Importance of Education’ and answer the comprehension questions that follow.
Do not turn to the discussion on the passage until you have completed the exercise.
You can form note as you read the passage using the note-making format suggested in module 1, unit 3.
The Importance of Education The importance of education in the socio-economic development of Nigeria, indeed of all nations, cannot be over-emphasised.
In its broadest sense, education is indispensable for the building and sustenance of a modem nation state.
It prepares enlightened citizens capable of communicating among themselves at an intelligent level, thus making it possible for them to work out their social and economic relationships.
Education is, in fact, a necessary ingredient for national unity, stability and development, for it not only prepares an individual citizen for living and personal fulfillment, but also makes it possible for him to contribute effectively to the development of his community and the nation generally.
No wonder then that every country devotes a substantial part of its resources to the education of its citizens, using it as an instrument for national integration and development.
The various levels and types of education prepare citizens and confer on them cel1ain abilities and competence that have profound effect on their future roles in and contribution to the society.
The philosophy of Nigerian education, as well as its aims and objectives, has been clearly spelt out in the National Policy on Education, with each level of education given a role in contributing to the unity and development of this country.
Education at the primary level confers on the individual the ability to read and write, thus increasing his communication ability with other citizens as well as between various communities.
The post-primary level is made up of the secondary schools and technical colleges.
The secondary schools generally prepare students for admission into higher education, while technical colleges impart skill and professional training for direct, on-the-job employment; higher education is broadly classified in this country as the education given in the universities, polytechnics and monotechnics, and colleges of education.
This level of education equips individuals with the necessary physical and intellectual skills to develop them into useful members of the community, as stated clearly in the National Policy on Education.
204  The role of education in promoting national unity and development is generally accepted.
The level and type of education acquired by an individual generally determines the nature of his job and his place in society.
Competition is thus intense for educational opportunities, and factors which limit any part of the country from effectively competing for education, be they historical, circumstantial or even as a result of self-imposed apathy, generate negative political and social consequences.
In order to reduce these problems to the minimum, the various governments must ensure adequate and equal educational opportunities for all citizens who need it.
Each part of the country must have equal access to education both in terms of location and proper funding of institutions as well as staffing and student enrolment.
That is why successive federal governments have made efforts to put in place policies that would ensure that educational opportunities are available to all and federal educational facilities are reasonably spread throughout the federation.
The main problem is to ensure that every state and local government is taking advantage of these federal facilities virtually at their door-steps to enhance their educational problems and then take conscious effort and sacrifice to provide the necessary resources to solve them.
Most of the Northern States already have identifiable educational problems.
One of the most urgent is how to increase the quantity and quality of output from the secondary schools for admissions into the tertiary institutions.
At the moments, less than 15% of those who sit for the WAEC and JAMB matriculation exams in all public schools pass and obtain the necessary credits for direct admission into the universities and polytechnics?
These problems call for massive financial investment in the primary and secondary school levels of education, accompanied by stringent quality control measures.
A successful example of how a state government can identify and solve a problem is the development of six science secondary schools by Kano State.
This has enabled the state to utilise all available places offered to it and go even further to take up unused openings for other states.

Do you find it difficult to list the importance of education from the passage?
The importance of education was well presented in paragraphs one and two of the passage.
Cross-check your answers with mine: Education is important for: 1. social-economic development of Nigeria 2. building and sustaining the modem state 206  3. promoting communication in an intelligent manner 4. national unity and stability 5. promoting self-fulfillment in individual 6. providing jobs 7.
Providing status in the society.
Also the second question which asks for the problems faced by education in Nigeria is not very problematic: 1. the main problem is the need to make sure that every state and local government takes the advantage of education 2. the problem of how to increase the quantity and quality of out-put of secondary education to meet the demand of tertiary education.
The roles assigned to education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels are well listed in the passage.
Primary education-- read, write and increase communication.
Secondary education- prepares students for admission into higher education.

Compare your list with mine.
• Lack of vocabulary of the field- expository passages can be difficult if you are not familiar with the words used in the passage.
Some words used are central to the passage and you must know them.
• Lack of organisation- if the expository passage is not well- organised, you may become confused as you read it.
All expository passages should start with the introduction, main body and conclusion.
• Lack of familiarity- with the concept being discussed.
If you have never heard the concept being discussed in the passage, you may find the comprehension of that passage difficult.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE How then do you overcome all these problems?

6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Overpopulation Retards Economic Development We are being daily exposed to a stream of ideological propaganda to the effect that the world is threatened by an unprecedented demographic crisis known as rampant overpopulation.
We are told that countries whose populations are growing at an annual rate of 4% are creating serious problems for themselves because this 'excessive' growth causes poverty, overcrowding, food shortages and overuse of scarce public 209 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I utilities and of other inevitably limited resources.
Poor countries are causing their own poverty!
We are made to believe that any society has a 'natural' limit to its capacity to produce more of the goods essential to provide decent living standards for all its people; that a fast expanding population severely strains a society's productive ability because an excessive proportion of its population is young children who, being unable to work, are a dependent burden; that the small section of society which does work productively is dragged down by the weight of too many mouths to feed; that the poor are an embarrassing burden on the backs of the rich; that high fertility and large family size depress living standards by eroding ability to save and by reducing investment per person in physical capital and human skills, that had it not been for Nigeria's relentless demographic explosion, the country's meager resources could have provided a more satisfactory rise in overall living standards; that the possibility of self-improvement through abstaining from procreation means that the poor do have the opportunity to raise their own income level.
Finally, we are told that every effort should be made to convince the poor that lowering their fertility rate would be in their own interests as a means to improve their welfare, and that the only solution is for governments to take all possible steps to reduce population growth rate in order to avert the impending catastrophe.
This fallacy first gained academic respectability in the person of Thomas Malthus who wrote a book, ‘Essay on the Principle of Population’ in 1798.
He argued that while the economy and per capita income increase by arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4,5 ...), population grows by geometric progression (1, 2, 4,8, 16...); that the masses are unable to exercise moral restraint and therefore are doomed to linger perpetually at bare subsistence level.
Inevitably, famines must periodically occur, destroying millions of lives, in order to bring population back into line with society's capacity to produce.
Since Malthus's time, the theory has continued to raise its ugly head, and it is now a central theme of the World Bank and the U.S.A. Malthusianism should be discredited as it shows gross misunderstanding of and lack of respect for the majority of people.
To tell hungry people that the greatest obstacle to their development is their own animal sexual desires is identical to the theory that underdevelopment is due to racial inferiority, laziness and stupidity of the natives.
Fortunately, the Nigerian Federal Government took a sober and reasonable line when it stated in the Third National Development Plan that a large and rapidly growing population does not 'constitute a serious or significant obstacle to domestic economic progress.'
210  Population explosion does not cause poverty, but rather it is a rational defence mechanism of the poor against the threat of their extinction.
All living creatures perform their functions with a rhythm and energy most favourable to the survival of their species.
Birds tend to lay more eggs after a natural disaster.
Human fertility rises sharply when war has caused widespread loss of life.
Population growth, far from continuing by geometrical progression to infinity, conforms to cycles connected with structures in the natural and cultural environment.
Temporarily, high birth rates in poor countries are an expression of dynamism, maturity and vitality -a higher and healthier condition than the almost zero fertility of some industrialized nations.

In such a reading-comprehension activity, only words are read.
However, there are occasions when you have to read both the verbal and non-verbal forms.
In such a situation, you come in contact with passages that are mixed with diagrams, tables and figures.
You need to know how to read such passages.
This is why this unit devotes time to train you on how to read and comprehend passages mixed with table.
At the end of the unit, I hope you will never find reading passages with complex tables, figures and statistical data difficult.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • read and comprehend passages containing tables • analyse passages containing tables • interprete passages containing tables.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Reading Tables in Academic Contexts Reading -comprehension activities that you performed so far in the previous unit are based on verbal forms.
That is, the use of words.
Reading is not only all words.
Sometimes you read figures, formulae, tables and so on.
These are called non-verbal or concrete reading materials.
In this section of the unit, you are 212  introduced to reading passages with tables.
In some cases, tables are presented in the body of reading materials possibly as illustrations, vivid presentation of facts and for brevity sake.
What a table can say may be more than what two or three paragraphs can illustrate.
Let's practice this skill of reading and interpreting tables.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Read the passage on ''Fish Production in Nigeria'' and answer the following questions.
After you have attempted the exercise, turn to the discussion part of this unit and cross-check your answers and responses with the one given there.
Fish Production in Nigeria Table 1: Fish Production in Nigeria (1989) Artisanal Tonnes Coastal and Brackish Water 171,332 Inland Rivers and Lakes 132,122 Fish farm 25,607 Industrial (Commercial Trawler) Fish 28,411 Shrimp 5,231 Distant (Imports) 313,987 Total 676,693 Tonnes The above table shows that about 25% of the total fish available in the country comes from coastal states.
However, about 19.5% of the total fish comes from inland rivers and lakes.
Of the total from inland rivers are lakes, more than 94% comes from Northern states, mostly from Borno and Sokoto states.
Information from Federal Department of Fisheries shows that from 1980 to 1982, fish production rose from 597,342 tonnes 1 920,482 tonnes.
It dropped in 1983 to 694,280 tonnes and continued to decline to 1985 when only 304)22 tonnes were produced.
From 1986 to 1989 the production increased to 676,693 tonnes.
Forestry in Nigeria Of the total land area of 98,33 hectare, the total area declined from 14.9 million hectares in 1980 to 10.
1 million in 1990, according to FAO.
The national vegetation is an important source of nuts, honey, fruits, meat fish, fodder, fibre, spices, resins, gum, tenain, fuel and other cash crops.
About 150 indigenous woody plants have been identified.
213 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I FAO estimated that, in 1980, high Forest Zone which includes Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Ondo, Bendel, Anambra, Imo, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross Rivers states had timber volume of 165m3, unproductive forest had 120m3 and savannah forest and grassland had 20m per family.

It has been estimated that annual fuel consumption per capital varies from l.2m3 in the South to 00.5m in the North.
Recent study of fuel demand in Northern Nigeria showed consumption of 620kg of wood, 120kg, of grain stalk, 48 litres of kerosine, and 37kg.

What is the weakness of the presentation and interpretation of Table 1?
Have you completed this exercise?
If you have done so, you can then turn to the discussion below.
If you have not, go through the exercise and complete every question before you turn to the discussion.
Now turn to the discussion.
3.2 Discussion on Reading and Interpreting Tables In reading and interpreting tables, you should pay particular attention, not only to the language or words used in the passage but also to the figures, percentages and the items presented both on the table and in the body of passage.
That is, just as your eyes are on the passage, so also must they be on the table presented.
If you pay specific and close attention to the table and the passage, you will realise that the following are the figures and words that can fill the gaps in question 1 of the exercise.
1.
The total; fish available in the country 2.
Coastal states 3.
About 19.5% 4.
Inland river and lakes 5.
More than 94% 6.
Northern states 7.
1980 to 1982 8.
597,342tonnes 9.
920,482 tonnes From the passage, it is possible for us to bring out the language used to describe the table.
This answers question 2 of the exercise.
The expression mainly used in the passage is- The above table shows... Other structures that can be used are presented in the box below.
The above table indicates...
The table specifies...
The table describes...
The table presents...
The table denotes... From the table... 215 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I The language to interpret the table as presented in the passage includes: • about 25% of the total fish • about 19.5% of the total fish • of the total from inland rivers • more than 94% comes • from 1980to 1982 • dropped in 1983 to….. • continue to decline to 1985.
• from 1986 to 1989, the production.
The passage has some weaknesses in data presentation.
The passage refers to some data (e.g.
25%, 19.5% and 94%) that are not indicated on the table.
It means that the writer wants you to figure them out, may be by finding the percentages on your own.
What did you learn from all of the above analyses?
In reading tables, you should pay attention to both the verbal form of language used and the non-verbal form in form of figures and percentages.
You should be able to follow both the words and the data presented in the passage.
You should also learn the skill of relating the figures with the words.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Go back to the passage read in the above self-assessment exercise, read the second passage on ‘Forestry in Nigeria’.
Answer the following questions after reading the passage.
Comprehension Questions 1.
What trends could be observed in forest area according to the passage?
2.
What are the views of FAO regarding Forest Zones in Nigeria?
3.
What pattern can emerge in terms of forest reserve distribution in Nigeria?
4.
Which Zone has the highest, the lowest and the second to the highest forest reserve area?
Turn to the discussion below once you have finished answering the questions.
In passage two-‘ Forestry’ in Nigeria, the writer loaded the passage with a lot of data.
Almost every line contains one form of data or the other.
Thus, to comprehend such a passage demands absolute concentration 216  and ability to relate figures with words.
Let's try to answer the questions raised.
Cross-check your answers with the ones presented here.
What trends could be observed in forest area Questions: according to the passage?
Answer: The writer suggested a declining trend: from 14.9 million hectares in 1980 to 10.1 million in 1990.
Question: What are the views of FAO regarding forest zone in Nigeria?
Answer: High Forest zone had timber volume area that was more than unproductive forest volume, savannah forest and grassland put together.
Question: What pattern can emerge in terms of forest reserve distribution in Nigeria?
Answers: Guinea savannah tops the list of forest reserve, followed Question: by Sudan Savannah, the least being the reserve in fresh water swamps.
Which zone has the highest, lowest and second to the Question: highest forest reserve areas?
Answer: Guinea Savannah has the highest, fresh water swamp the lowest and Sudan Savannah, next to the highest.
Going through the analyses above, you will realise that reading passages loaded with data information can be very demanding.
There's need to relate many figures with the ideas presented in the passage.
You can now work on your own to read, observe and analyse data from tables in the series of passages presented in exercise 4 SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Read table 3 presented here, and answer the questions that follow, cross- check your answers with the ones presented at the end of the unit.
The title of table 3 is Estimated Supply of Food, 1990 ('000 Tonnes).

Table 3 above shows that in 1990, a total of over two million tonnes of maize were produced in the country of which 1,364,680 tonnes were produced in the Southern states while the Northern states produced, slightly, over 700,000 tonnes.
All the millet, wheat and acha amounting to over 9 million, 500,00 and 137,000 tonnes respectively were grown only in the Northern states.
In fact, acha was grown in Plateau in the Northern states.
According to Wudiri (1993), sorghum grows in 20 states, but in 1990 of the 6.8 million tonnes grown, only 41,000 tonnes were grown in Southern states.
The Northern states produced more than 90% of the cowpea, soyabean and benniseed grown in the country in 1990.
Similarly, more than 90% of plantain and cocoyam grown in 1990 were produced in the Southern states.

Give two trends.
Now that you have completed the exercise, what do you think of reading passages with tables?
My feeling may be similar to yours.
I feel it is a challenging and an interesting exercise.
You need keen ability to observe, compare and relate many things together before you can find the exercise interesting.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 What difficulties can you encounter while reading passages with tables?
Your difficulties may be similar to the ones I will list below.
• Distractions that the tables and the figures may pose to reading and comprehension; • Language may be complex and tedious to interpret; • Lack of familiarity with the concept being discussed.
For example, arts students may find scientific texts with many tables difficult to read; • Interwoven connections with the tables and the passage.
Sometimes these connections are not so clear.
Can you overcome these problems?
Yes I think you can by reading widely, being highly patient while reading the texts and being keenly observant of details.
Your language must also be highly developed to be able to grasp the complexities of reading passages with tables.
In order to read and comprehend passages with tables, let's give brief suggestions to follow.
Take these suggestions with you wherever you go.
219 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I • Read the passage very carefully • Relate the table and the content of the passage together • Observe details where necessary • Be patient as you read and study the table • Face the task with high proficiency in the English language • Be able to bring out patterns, trends, conflicting views and contrasting views from passage.
4.0 CONCLUSION Reading-comprehension has been shown to involve verbal and non- verbal forms in this unit.
The verbal forms are words, while the non- verbal forms are figures synthesised into words in the passage and presented in form of tables.
To be able to comprehend such reading materials, you should be capable of observing, relating, interpreting and drawing inferences.
You should observe the data presented on the table and relate such data to the ideas presented in words.
With interpretation and drawing of inferences, you will be able to gain understanding from such reading passages.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has explained to you: • how to read passages containing tables • how to analyse such tables • how to draw inferences from the tables.
These skills are very important for you as you read in different academic contexts.

222  UNIT 4 READING SCIENTIFIC TEXTS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Why Scientific Texts?
3.2 Characteristics of Scientific Texts 3.3 Discussion on Passage titled “Periodic Table” 3.4 Do You Have Anything to Learn from Analysing Scientific Texts?
4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION This unit broadens reading-comprehension to include scientific texts.
Science is brought into this component of the Use of English Course because of its importance.
You cannot run away from reading something scientific.
Indeed, the world is highly centered on scientific inventions and discoveries.
A lot of information is stored in science texts that a student like you must be able to tap, thus, the need for you to read scientific texts, no matter your area of specialty.
In this unit, attempt will be made by us to read, comprehend and analyse a few scientific texts.
I wish you success as you go through the unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define scientific texts • state very clearly the reasons why scientific texts should be read • read and comprehend sample scientific texts • analyse sample scientific texts with some measure of accuracy.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Why Scientific Texts?
As you probably know, the world is a science world.
This age is popularly referred to as a scientific age.
Science has dominated all spheres of life: transport, telecommunications, information technology, research, 223 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I engineering, building, medicine, agriculture, and many more.
These fields all base their operations on scientific principles.
The bulk of academic activities are science-based.
It means justice is not done to reading, if reading of scientific texts is not given due consideration.
• You read scientific text to gain knowledge of the world around you.
• You read scientific texts in order to operate the by-products of scientific inventions.
• You read scientific texts to be able to utilise scientific knowledge for growth and development.
• If you are a science student, you need to read scientific texts for understanding of scientific principles, theories, laws and operations.
In this unit, attempt will be made to expose you to some scientific texts and make you appreciate science better.
3.2 Characteristics of Scientific Texts Reading scientific texts can become more effective, if you know what to look for in the materials.
Reading becomes also more interesting if the knowledge of the characteristics of scientific texts is known.
You need the knowledge of the characteristics of scientific texts to be able to read the texts with greater understanding.
In, order to expose you to the characteristic features of scientific texts, a sample text will be analysed.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Read the passage titled ‘Newton's Second Law: Gravitation’ and answer the questions that follow.
By the time you go through this exercise, the features of the scientific texts will be unfolded to you.
Newton's Second Law: Gravitation There are two other systems of units in which, as in the engineering- system, the unit of force rather than of mass is arbitrarily defined.
These systems take as their units of force the weight of the standard kilogram and the weight of a gram.
The former force is called ''one kilogram of force'' and the latter ''one gram of force is about 0.0022 1b or 980 dynes.
The ''gram of force'' is commonly used as a force unit in elementary physics texts, where the reader has probably met it.
The kilogram force is used as a force unit in engineering work in those countries which use the metric system exclusively.
We shall use neither of these units in this book, and ''gram'' and ''kilogram'' will refer to mass only.
224  5 - 5 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation Throughout our study of mechanics we have been continually encountering forces due to gravitational attraction between the earth and bodies on its surface, forces which are called the weights of the bodies.
We now wish to study this phenomenon of gravitation in somewhat more detail.
The law of universal gravitation was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton, and was first announced by him in the year 1686.
It may be stated: Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force which is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
F ∝ mm1 r2 The proportion above may be converted to an equation on multiplication by a constant G, which is called the gravitational constant.
F ∝ G mm1 r2 (5 – 5) There seems to be some evidence that Newton was led to deduce this law from speculations concerning the fall of an apple to the earth.
However, his first published calculations to justify its correctness had to do with the motion of the moon around the earth.
The numerical value of the constant G depends on the units in which force, mass, and distance are expressed.
Its magnitude can be found experimentally by measuring the force of gravitational attraction between two bodies of known masses m and ml, at a known separation.
For bodies of moderate size the force is extremely small, but it can be measured with an instrument which was invented by the Rev.
John Michell, although it was first used for this purpose by Sir Henry Cavendish in 1798.
The same type of instrument was also used by Coulomb for studying forces of electrical and magnetic attraction and repulsion.

Reading: Addison Wesley Publishing Co. 225 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I Questions 1.
Give three examples to show that scientific writing is precise.
2.
What suggests in the passage that scientific writing is a mixture of verbal and non-verbal forms of writing?
3.
What does the passage mean by metric system exclusively, directly proportional and inversely proportional?
4.
Give three examples each, of highly technical terms, technical and common terms in the passage.
5.
Give examples of each of the following from the passage.
(a) Use of modification (b) Use of passive (c) Use of measurement (d) Use of laws (e) Use of calculation (f) Use of formulae (g) Use of definition (h) Use of compare and contrast By the time you go through this exercise, you will be able to specify the characteristic features of scientific texts.
Now that you have completed the exercise, let's discuss the questions.
But remember, you are not helping yourself by reading this discussion before attempting and completing exercise 1.
1.
Perhaps one of the greater features of a scientific text is preciseness.
Scientific writing avoids ambiguity (double meaning or interpretation), exaggerations, circumlocution (going round and round before making a point), sentiments (feelings) and tries to be impersonal (avoids the use of I, we, me, mine, you etc.).
Straight forwardness, preciseness and directness are the features of a scientific text.
Let's illustrate all these in the text.
Preciseness is shown by the following expressions drawn from the passage: The former is called one kilogram of force and the latter one gram of force.
The sentence in the box is specific and precise.
It will not be precise if the sentence is re-written as- The former is probably called one kilogram of force and the latter may likely be called one gram of force.
226  Other precise statements in the passage include: - • The gram of force is commonly used • The kilogram of force is used as.. • The law of universal gravitation was discovered by... 2.
Scientific texts are usually a mixture of verbal and non-verbal forms.
Verbal suggests words.
Non-verbal forms are figures, diagrams, formulae, tables, etc.
In most cases, the non-verbal forms are integrated or synthesised into the verbal form.
Examples in the passage include.
3.
Sc•i entifIisc a tbeoxutst 2ar.2e 1fubl lo of ff odricffee rent kinds of measuring scales e.g.
The metric system: kilograms, grams Pound system (1 b).
• Is about 0.002216 or 980 dynes ⇒ figures or numbers F = G ⇒ formula • The numerical value of the constant G depends on the units.
4.
Relationship is also very important in scientific texts.
For example, the passage shows relationship by words such as: • directly proportional which means relationship between quantities whose ratio is constant • inversely proportional means a relationship between two quantities such that one increases in proportion as the other decreases.
5.
Technical terms are also common features of scientific texts.
Some terms are highly technical e.g.
dynes and gravitational constant.
Some terms are just technical kilogram of force, mass, gram of force, particle, etc.
Of course, there are also common words in scientific texts.
Words such as universe, arbitrary, systems, standard etc., are common in scientific texts.
6.
The language of scientific text is diverse and specific: some of these are 227 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I a) The use of modification N i.
One kilogram of force N ii.
The masses of the particle N iii.
Of the standard kilogram N iv.
Gravitational attraction All the words underlined above modify or qualify the nouns that are cycled.
(b) Use of measurement e.g.
kilogram, gram, lbs, dynes etc.
(c) Use of laws e.g.
the law of universal gravitation stated in the passage.
(d) Use of calculation- e.g.
the proportion above may be converted to an equation on multiplication by a constant G, which is called gravitational constant.
(e) Use of formulae: e.g.
F = G (f) Use of definition: The gram of force is commonly used as a force unit in elementary physics.
The kilogram force is used as a force unit in engineering work.
(g) Comparison and contrast are expressed by expressions such as: The former force is... and the latter one gram.. You can see from the analyses and the discussions that scientific texts have their own peculiar ways of presenting materials.
Your knowledge of these ways should assist you as you read these texts.
Let's work on another scientific text in order to establish the characteristics of scientific texts.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Read the passage titled ‘Periodic Table’ and answer the questions that follow.
Do not turn to the discussion on periodic table until you have completed answering the questions.
Periodic Table Probably the most significant discovery in all chemistry, aside from the atomic nature of matter, was that of the periodic properties of the 228  elements, now depicted in the familiar periodic table of the elements.
The chemical properties of this table are probably familiar to most readers; the physical properties will be discussed later.
The table was proposed independently by Meyer and by Mendeleev in 1869.
Its usefulness lay both in its regularities and in its irregularities.
One interesting irregularity in the original table was that in order to have the element fall in positions consistent with their chemical properties, it was necessary to leave numerous spaces unoccupied.
Mendeleev suggested that these spaces would be filled with as yet undiscovered elements.
Using his table, he was able to describe in considerable detail the properties these elements could be expected to have when they were discovered.
It was nearly one hundred years before all these predictions of Mendeleev were fulfilled.
Reflect, for a moment, on the vast simplification that the atomic view of matter provides.
Looking about us, we see innumerable kinds of materials.
The atomic view indicates that these materials are of discrete kinds whose number, however large, is not infinite.
The discovery of elements is a further simplification in that the many materials we encounter are shown to be composed of only about one hundred chemically distinguishable materials, many of which are rare.
It turns out that even these elements are not a heterogeneous group but are subject to further classification into a periodic table.
The problems of chemistry are many, but it is easy to see that things are much simpler than might at first appear.

3.3 Discussion on the Passage Titled ‘Periodic Table’ The passage on ‘Periodic Table’ shows another side of scientific texts.
Unlike the previous passage titled ‘Newton's Second Law: Gravitation’, this passage does not mix verbal with non-verbal forms.
That is, there are no tables, charts, diagrams, figures or formulae in this passage.
Let's attempt to answer the questions posed in exercise 2 .
Question 1 Identify the components of a Periodic Table.
Answer: A Periodic table contains the periodic properties of elements which are made up of physical and: chemical properties.
Question 2 Why is the Periodic Table a useful tool?
Answer: It is because of its regularities and its irregularities-- Regular in terms of its elements falling in positions consistent with their chemical properties and irregular in that many spaces are left unoccupied to be filled by undiscovered elements.
Question 3 Describe the Periodic Table as presented in the passage.
Answer: A Periodic table describes properties of elements.
It views atoms as discrete not infinite in number.
It shows that the materials we encounter consist of about one hundred chemically distinguishable substances.
Question 4 Comment on the language of science as presented in the article titled ‘Periodic Table’ As indicated earlier on, the language of science displayed in this article is a bit different from the one shown in the earlier article i.e.
‘Newton's Second Law: Gravitation’.
No figures, tables and diagrams in this article.
‘Periodic Table article’ is more descriptive in outlook, less 230  precise (e.g.
the use of probably the most significant discovery... and more of an introduction to the topic.)
But like the ‘Newton's Second Law: Gravitation article’, this article has some characteristics of scientific texts.
These include: • use of passive forms • …the physical properties will be discussed later • the table was proposed independently by.
• …these spaces will be filled... • use of technical terms -technical terms such as chemical properties, elements, atomic view, atomic nature, etc.
portray the passage as a scientific passage.
• use of common terms that cut across all fields.
There are, however, some terms that are not technical but common and not limited to scientific field alone; e.g.
depicted, usefulness, positions, consistent etc.
In terms of formal or informal style, this passage is less formal than the one on ‘Newton's Second Law: Gravitation’.
The present passage allows the use of some personal pronouns like he, we, us, and so on.
3.4 Do You Have Anything to Learn from Analysing Scientific Texts?
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 What do you learn from all the foregoing analyses of scientific texts?
Put your answers down on a piece of paper.
Compare your answers with mine; in all the analyses, it is possible for you to learn that: • scientific texts have their own peculiar structure and style • scientific texts integrate verbal and non-verbal forms • some scientific texts are more formal than the other • scientific texts can be loaded with information; you need high proficiency in English to be able to unfold these forms • some scientific texts are more highly technical than others.
If you are in arts or humanities, you may probably not need to read complex scientific texts with highly-loaded technical terms; but, definitely those in science and technology cannot run away from high- loaded scientific texts.
231 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 4.0 CONCLUSION Your exposure to science texts in this unit underscores the importance of science in all academic matters.
I hope those who are in science and technology-based courses have learnt quite a lot in this unit.
The unit should make them to relate with scientific texts better.
Those who are in arts have also learnt something, I guess.
If you are in arts, you must have learnt something too.
At least as an arts student, you are able to confront scientific materials after going through the unit with greater confidence.
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has taught you: • what scientific texts are • the characteristics of scientific texts • how to analyse scientific texts • how to comprehend various scientific texts.
This unit should prepare you for reading different science texts with greater Confidence.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT Read the extract from a medical book titled ‘Sporozoa’, carefully.
You may want to form notes as you read the passage.

____________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ 232  4.
Comment on the characteristic features of scientific texts exhibitive in this passage.
____________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ Sporozoa This group includes malaria parasites and related coccidia.
These parasites exhibit a complex life-cycle involving alternating cycles of a sexual division (schizogony) and sexual development (sporogony).
In malaria parasites, the sexual cycle takes place in the female anopheline mosquito (Fig.1).
Malaria Parasites Description Four species of malaria parasite are encountered in human disease: Plasmodium falciparum, which is responsible for most fatalities; P. vivax and P.ovale, both of which cause benign tertian malaria (febrile episodes typically occurring at 48h intervals); and P. malaria, which causes quartan malaria (febrile episodes typically occurring at 72h intervals).
Life cycle When an infected mosquito bites, sporozonites present in the salivary glands enter the bloodstream and are carried to the liver, where they invade liver parenchyma cells.
They undergo a process of multiple nuclear division, followed by cytoplasmic division (schizogony) and, when this is complete, the liver cell ruptures, releasing hundreds of individual parasites (merozoites) into the bloodstream.
The merozqites penetrate red blood cells and adopt a typical 'signet-ring' morphology.
Fig.
1: Schematic representation of the life cycle of malaria parasites.
233 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I In the case of P. vivax and P. ovale some parasites in the liver remain dormant and the cycle of pre-erythrocytic schizogony is completed only after a long delay.
Such parasites are responsible for the relapses of tertian malaria that may occur up to 2 years after the initial infection.
In the bloodstream, the young ring forms (trophozoites) develop and start to undergo nuclear division (erythrocytic schizogony), Depending on the species, about 8 -24 nuclei are produced before cytoplasmic division occurs and the red cell ruptures to release the individual merozoites, which then infect fresh red blood cells.
Instead of entering the cycle of erythrocylic schozogony, some Vlerozoites develop within red cells into male or female ganletocytes.
These do not develop further in the human host, but when the blood is ingested by the insect vector, the nuclear material and cytoplasm of the male gametocytes differentiate to produce several individual gametes, which give the gametocyte the appearance of a flagellate body (exflagellating male gametocyte).
The gametes become detached and penetrate the female gametocyte, which elongates into a zygotic form, the ookinete.
This penetrates the mid-gut wall of the mosquito and settles on the body cavity side as an oocyst, which is yet another multiplicatory phase within which numerous sporozoites are formed.
When mature, the oocyst ruptures, releasing the sporozites into the body cavity, from where some find their way to the salivary glands.
Erythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum- P.falciparum differs from the other forms of malaria parasite ill that developing erythrocytic schizonue from aggregates in the capil1aries of the brain and other internal organs, so that only relatively young ring forms are found in peripheral blood.
The cycle of erthrocytic schizogony takes 48 h except in the case of P. malariae, in which the cycle occupies 72 h. Since febrile episodes occur shortly after red cell ruptures, this explains the characterstic periodic fevers.
However, with P. falciparum, the cycle of different broods of parasite do not become synchronised as they do in other forms of malaria and typical tertian fevers are not usual in falciparum malaria.
Laboratory diagnosis Acute falciparum malaria is a medical emergency that demands immediate diagnosis and treatment.
To establish the diagnosis, a drop of peripheral blood is spread over a 2cm area on a glass slide.
The smear should not be too thick; a useful criterion is that print should be just visible through it.
The smear is allowed to dry thoroughly and stained by Field's method.
This is an aqueous Romanowsky stain which stains 234  the parasites very rapidly and haemolyses the red cells, so that the parasites are easy to detect despite the thickness of the film.
With experience, the species of malaria can usually be determined from a thick blood film, but some of the characteristic features that assist in establishing the identity of the parasites, such as the typical stippling of the red cell that accompanies infection with P vivax or P. ovate, are better observed in a conventional thin blood film.
This is stained by one of the many modifications of Geimsa's or Leishman's stain, but the water used to dilute the stain should be of pH7.2 (not 6.8 as used for haematological purposes) in order optimally to demonstrate parasite morphology and associated red cell changes.
Several serodiagnosac tests for malaria have been devised, notably the indirect immunoduorescene test, but these are of limited value.
Treatment -for many years the standard treatment for acute malaria was chloroquine.
However resistance to that drug in P. falciparum (but not other species) is now widespread and alternative agents often have to be used.
The most reliable alternative to chloroquine is quinine, the traditional remedy that has been available for centuries in the form of cinchona bark.
Newer antimalarials include mefioquine and halofantrine.
Although these compounds are active against chloroquine-resistant strains, resistance to them has already been described and there are fears that this will become widespread with indiscriminate use.
Treatment of acute malaria with chloroquine, quinine or other antimalarials will not eliminate exo-erythrocytic parasites in the liver.
For this purpose the 8-aminoquinoline drug primaquine must be used.
This agent carries the risk of precipitating haemolysis in individuals who are deficient in the enzyme glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

235 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I UNIT 5 READING FOR INTERPRETATION AND CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Reading for Interpretation 3.2 Reading for Critical Analysis and Evaluation 3.3 Discussion of the Passage Titled “Nigeria: the Good” 3.4 Discussion of the Passage Titled “Nigeria: the Bad and the Ugly” 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION This is the last unit under reading -comprehension skills that will be treated in this course.
In terms of the reading -comprehension tasks you may be called upon to perform in all academic contexts, reading for interpretation and evaluation is probably the most difficult.
That is why its treatment is delayed to the last unit of the reading -comprehension component of the course.
Reading for interpretation and critical evaluation demands thorough understanding of the passages you are reading.
It also demands ability to interpret the stated and unstated writer's intentions.
You are often called upon to pass value judgements, which is not an easy activity.
As you go through this unit, you are advised to pay attention to how to read between and within the lines of a passage to interpret and evaluate writers' viewpoints.
If you acquire this skill, I can assure you that you will be able to face your academic activities more, efficiently.
As you settle down to read the unit, I assure you maximum enjoyment.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • state clearly how to read for interpretation • state clearly how to read for critical analysis and evaluation • read, comprehend and interpret sample passages • read, comprehend and critically evaluate sample passages.
236  3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Reading for Interpretation Reading for interpretation is in stages.
The first stage is reading and understanding the passage very well.
Without basic understanding of the passage, you cannot interpret the writer's stated and unstated views.
The second stage is that of reading between the lines and above the lines, to determine what the writer has stated and infer from what he has stated and that which he has not implicitly stated.
Interpretative tasks involve you providing answers to the following questions.
• What does the passage give?
What has the passage not given?
• Why is what the writer stated or not stated this way or that way?
• Why is the situation stated in the passage developed or operated?
• How is it determined?
• What trends are noticed in the writer's statements, presentations or points of view?
3.2 Reading for Critical Analysis and Evaluation A critical mind is an intelligent mind.
This captures what I have in mind for you in this section.
In order to read for critical analysis and evaluation: • you must read the passage carefully, usually at a study reading speed • you must understand the passage in and out • you must be able to provide answers to questions like: • to what extent?
• how important or relevant?
• what are the areas of strength and weakness?
• how effective or successful?
In the exercises that you will do in this unit, you will need to think critically, understand what the writer says and fill in gaps that are not filled in the passages using your own past or prior experiences.
You will also need the ability to see both sides of the coin (pros and cons), merits and the demerits of the writer's views or arguments.
After all these, you will then be able to relate together the 237 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I merits, demerits, gaps yet unfilled and contradictory views expressed to formulate your own value judgements, or your own opinions of the writer of the passage.
Let's go into action by practising all that we have discussed so far.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Reading the passage titled ‘Nigeria: The Good carefully’.
As you read the passage, try to give interpretations to some of the issues that will be raised in this exercise.
Also think, critically, about some of the views of the writer.
Come out with some judgements regarding the strengths, weakness of the passage, and your stand regarding what the writer refers to as ‘Nigeria: The Good’.
Nigeria: the Good Literally, all who believe in God must conclude that God loves this Nigeria, dearly.
Those who do not may simply say, at least, that nature is very fair to Nigeria.
Modern Nigeria today is endowed with stupendous potentials for economic, political and technological-cum-industrial greatness.
Her huge size makes her one of the biggest nations of the world.
In fact, Nigeria is the biggest nation in Africa, with the potential of being the true giant of Africa.
Her geography is arranged perfectly for her to have stupendous agricultural potential.
Stretching from the Tropical rain forests on her coastline to the alluvial and excessively fertile Savannah grasslands of the hinterland, with all the numerous rivers and fresh water reservoirs which criss-cross the country, Nigeria is a natural candidate for rapid agricultural industrialisation.
These God-given potentials which we did not work to produce could, with very little creative self-efforts make Nigeria the true food basket of Africa and perhaps the world.
From this 'free' gift, Nigeria has also a guaranteed position as an industrial giant, a technological power that could be very wealthy, if only she would develop this natural endowment alone.
When you add to this, the huge mineral resources, which abound in plentiful supply under the soils of Nigeria, quite naturally, minerals such as coal, columbite, limestone, marble, lead, zinc, salt, uranium, gold, tin and many others, such as the much sought after 'black gold' -petroleum - all of which God Almighty just literally dumped here, not through any 238  effort of ours, you can, in the context of what obtains in the world today, conclude that Nigeria indeed is destined by God to be one of the wealthiest, most endowed, and perhaps the happiest places to live in; a self-sufficient industrial and technological giant a real world power.
Only a very little creative effort is required of Nigerians to actualise this tremendous potential.
Through the colonial fiat of nation creation, often solely for the convenience of the administering colonial power, Nigeria again found herself conferred with potential greatness, not through any conscious actions of the colonising power to so endow Nigeria.
In the process, of the amalgamation of the British Colony of Lagos, and the British Protectorates of Southern and Northern Nigeria, the nation- state of Nigeria acquired a huge population.
This population is rumoured to be standing today at between 100 and 150 million people, thus making Nigeria the biggest black nation on earth.
In fact, it is rumoured that every fourth black person on earth is a Nigerian!
In the context of meaningful interaction of a credible nature, in the comity of nation, where a nation's size, economic, industrial and technological capacity and capability determine her power status, Nigeria's size is a plus.
Coupled with her stupendous naturally endowed wealth, Nigeria is an "A" candidate for a credible, dominant world power.
Nigeria's position is made even favourable and enviable as the advanced technologies choke themselves up with surplus manufactured goods in an ever shrinking, purely consumptive, market.
Her huge size makes her an enviable important world market, which has not and cannot escape, the needle eye products.
With proper maneuvering and creative manipulation, Nigeria could have acquired and can still acquire, a serious leverage which would ensure serious power status for her, as well as make her derive tremendous benefits from developed technologies, all principally from this endowed fact of her size and population.
Before independence came, Nigeria's numerous tribes and differing nationalities showed promise of a rare understanding required of all evolving systems destined to succeed.
The post-colonial leadership, in sincere determination to regain their self-determination, showed superior qualities of intellect and commitment.
They cooperated to defeat British imperialism, despite the multiplicity of her tribes and the constant application of the British tactics of divide and rule.
Tribal Nigeria, led by the trio of the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and erudite Zik of Africa, the Rt.
Hon.
Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, outwitted British divide and rule tactics 239 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I and won self-government for the regions in 1957 and 1959 and independence, without a drop of blood, for the nation-state of Nigeria.
Committed to the building of a modern nation-state out of the over 250 nationalities they presided over, these founders of modern Nigeria, adopted willingly at independence the best system necessitated by the apparent indomitable problem of ethnic pluralism confronting them.
The Nigerian genius in them led them to choose, correctly, federalism as the best form of government suitable for Nigeria.
In fact, at independence, this uncertain Nigeria of today was a modest 'showpiece' of a success story: the story of grafting successfully Western democratic institutions and practices in complete multi-ethnic African setting.
These were the happy days which made Nigeria appear properly poised to fulfill all the expectations of the natural greatness conferred upon her by so many factors.

Therefore do not turn to the discussion on this passage until you have finished exercise 1.
Now that you have completed exercise 1, let's discuss it.
3.3 Discussion of the Passage Titled ''Nigeria: the Good'' What is your general impression about the passage?
I think it is a well written passage.
It has been able to convince the reader that, indeed, Nigeria has its good aspects.
Let's discuss each of the comprehension questions.
1.
The relevance of the title to the contents of the passage- this question suggests your ability to be able to relate the title to the contents of a reading passage.
You need to be able to interpret the passage in the context of the title.
Do you think the contents of the passage are related to the title?
I think so.
In fact, the passage spreads all efforts to outline what is good in Nigeria: • her geography that is good for agriculture and agricultural industrialisation • mineral resources in abundance • her huge size which makes for an important world market • early post-colonial leadership which was without bloodshed.
With all of these facts, you can say that the passage is relevant to the title ‘Nigeria: the Good’.
241 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I 2.
The second question requires you to interpret the passage in the light of the statement made by the writer- the true giant of Africa.
In this interpretation you should be able to gather all things said by the writer to show that Nigeria is really a giant.
These include stupendous potentials, huge size, biggest in Africa, stupendous agricultural potential, numerous rivers, industrial giant, huge mineral resources, biggest black nation on earth, important world market, etc.
All of these are overwhelming evidences that Nigeria is indeed a true giant of Africa.
3.
Question 3- assesses the strength and the weakness of the passage; this question is a critical assessment type of question.
You need to assess the strength and the weakness of the passage.
I think the strength is easy to assess.
The writer is able to: • bring out the good in Nigeria • support all good points with concrete and convincing evidences • relate the past (colonial days) with the present (population in Nigeria presently) • present the success stories of Nigeria in a convincing manner and • choose appropriate words to reveal what is good in Nigeria.
Perhaps the weakness of the article may be a bit difficult to assess.
You need to think deeply, possibly beyond the context of the article to be able to determine its weakness.
Some of the weaknesses I can think of are as listed below.
(a) The article is a bit sensational; it excessively glorifies Nigeria .
(b) The writer takes good to mean what is naturally given.
I think what is naturally given by God can only be good when they are utilised well.
4.
Question 4 requires you to interpret the expressions, in the light of the contents of the passage.
(a) Free gift- to suggest Nigeria's natural endowments are not worked for; (b) Little creative effort- to show that Nigeria needs very little initiative and power to develop the natural resources.
(c) Nigeria's size is a plus- to show that size is on the positive side of Nigeria.
With her size she can tap, utilise products emerging from her natural resources.
5.
The past is related to the present through references to colonial, post-colonial and Nigeria today.
Colonial days witnessed 242  amalgamation; post-colonial days suggest qualitative leadership and today, the expected showpiece of success story of Nigeria through democratic rule.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Briefly outline what the analysis of ‘Nigeria: the Good’ mean to you in three sentences.
Cross check your answer with the ones given below.
What do all these analyses mean to you?
That's a good question.
It means that in reading for interpretation and critical evaluation, you must understand the passage very well.
You must be able to relate part of the passage to the whole.
You must be able to think beyond the passage, through inferencing.
You must be able to come up with your own opinions and pass value judgements.
SELF-ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Reading the passage ‘Nigeria: The Bad and the Ugly’ and compare it with the previous passage ‘Nigeria: the Good’.
Bring out similarities and differences between the two passages.
Turn to the next discussion after completing this exercise.
Nigeria: the Bad and the Ugly She was founded on the concept of federalism, negotiated, bloodlessly, by her founding fathers: the Rt.
Hon.
Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo and the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto.
Rare breeds and real gentlemen indeed, who appeared to have imbibed the moderate spirit of British parliamentary democracy through the ,artfully, adopted strategy of compromise, learned through the crucible of primal experience gained from, and demanded by, the peculiarity of the multiplicity of Nigeria's fiercely proud ethnic nationalities.
There was a real success story during the period of the struggle for independence.
The beginning was also full of hope and promise.
The question then to be posed is- why has Nigeria, with all these potentials and promising beginning, not realised, up till now, her potential greatness?
What went wrong?
The why, and non-realisation of Nigeria's greatness constitute principally, the BAD.
Some of the terrible consequences are with us today.
Our mode of reacting to the consequences which followed the non-realisation of Nigeria's potential and some of the destructive and 243 GST101 USE OF ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS I divisive policies and actions and action tendencies which we indulge in, some blatantly, actions which appear objectively capable of destroying us and our nation-state, and yet we continue with same, constitute the UGLY.
The rest of the presentation represents a mere exemplification of what is contended here, through a monotonous narration of a few selected such indulgent divisive policies, actions and action tendencies with potential capabilities for the total destruction of the nation-state of Nigeria.
Soon after Colonial Britain expanded the participation of the Nigerian African in the governance of the emerging nation-state of Nigeria, there appeared to be palpable ethnic ripples which crippled Nigerian leadership.
These ripples quickly gravitated to the position of infusing all kinds of fears and mutual suspicions, which reached the state of outright distrust of other nationalities other than 'mine', soon after independence.
This development, which Nigerian leaders became incapable of controlling, having handled the same phenomenon to snatch independence, was most unfortunate and showed graphically the BAD and the UGLY face of the Nigerian situation.
An unfortunate example which will illustrate the evolution and development of this terrible phenomenon which was later to cripple Nigeria, and now objectively threatens to tear her apart, will be presented from the salvo fired during the hey days of the founding fathers.
If you cast your mind to the trauma that was Zik's in the Western House of Assembly in 1954, and go from there to evaluate the consequences of Zik's primordial response, you will feel sorry for us hapless Nigerians, and mourn the unwitting institution of the era of recurring lost opportunists of making the Nigerian nation-state a great edifice.
In that fateful year of 1954, the NCNC, of the then great Nigerian patriot, Zik, a man who throughout his life had argued strongly for a Nigerian nationalism as opposed to ethnic particularism, won a majority of seats in the Regional elections into the Western House of Assembly.
When this great nationalistic Zik, the leader of NCNC, the Party which had won the majority of seats in the Western House of Assembly, arrived in Ibadan, the capital of the West, from Lagos to be sworn in as Premier of the Western Region, Zik discovered, to his consternation, that his victory and majority had vaporised overnight!
The leader and founder of the Egbe Omo Oduduwa, a nationalist pan- Yoruba organisation, which had metamorphosed into the Action Group (AG) Party, had successfully convinced his Yoruba brothers of the 244  NCNC not to allow an Ibo to be Premier in the West, the home of the Yoruba.
Bewildered, confused, humiliated and frustrated, the father of pan- Nigerian ism (and perhaps pan- Africanism), the great Zik of Africa, an avowed Nigerian nationalist, quickly withdrew into his 'tribal cocoon', and moved out of the Yoruba West and went 'home' to the East, settling firmly amongst his own tribesmen, the Ibo, who promptly rewarded him with premiership of the Eastern Region.
This was really BAD and UGLY.
The chain reaction set off by this BAD and UGLY happening had, and still continues to have, critical effect on how the Ibo Nigerian generally perceives his Yoruba brother.
This enduring perception had had profound consequences on some critical political developments in Nigeria, and also on the manner of general developments and the evolution of the Nigerian nation-state.
In the upsurge of the aggressive ethnic nationalism which ensued, the North formulated her Northemisation policy, and the East became an 'East for Easterners', while the West merely consolidated her policy of 'West is Yoruba and Yoruba is West'.
Everyone appeared to be so engrossed in the delineation, pursuit and protection of various regional interests that no serious energies were directed at developing the great potentials of Nigeria.
As this BAD and the UGLY aspect of sectional nationalism waxed stronger, the GOOD atrophied, until we were almost paying only lip service to the development of the mega interests of the macro structure called the nation-state of Nigeria.
All other activities and interactions, whether they be in the economic, social and political spheres of the live of the nation-state of Nigeria became primed, or appear to be primed, or at least to be substantially affected, by this perilous phenomenon now properly called ethnicity, or ethnic particularism.
