Series Solution of Ordinary Differential Equation An expression of the form ¥ A + A(x- x )+...A (x- x )n +...= ∑ A (x- x )n +... (1) 0 1 0 n 0 n y n=0 is called the power series.
To determine for what values of x the series (1) converges we use ratio test A (x- x )n+1 T r = lim n+1 0 =lim n+1 = Lx- x A (x- x )n T 0 ﬁn ¥ n 0 ﬁn ¥ n A Where L =lim n+1 (2) A ﬁn ¥ n The series is convergent whenr <1, divergent when r >1 .
The test 1 fails if r =1.
r = is called the radius of convergence L The series converges when 1 x- x < = R (radius of convergence) 0 L diverges when 1 x- x > = R 0 L (i) If L is zero, the series converges for all Values of x (ii) If L is infinite, the series converges only at the point x = x 0 (iii) If L is finite, then the series converges, when 1 x- x < = R (radius of convergence) and diverges if 0 L 1 x- x > 0 L ¥ ¥ If ∑ a (x- x )n and ∑ b (x- x )n n y n y n=0 n=0 Converge to f(x) and g(x) respectively, for x- x < r (radius of 0 1 convergence) r > 0, then the following are true for x- x < r .
1 0 1 (i)Two series can be added and subtracted term wise, and ¥ f(x)– g(x) = ∑ (a +b )(x- x )n n n y n=0 (ii) The series can be multiplied and ¥ ¥ ¥ f(x)g(x) = ∑ a (x- x )n∑ b (x- x )n = ∑ C (x- x )n n y n 0 n 0 n=0 n=0 n=0 Where C = a b +ab +a b +...+a b n 0 n 1 n- 1 2 n- 2 n 0 If g(x ) „ 0, the series 0 f(x) ¥ = ∑ d (x- x )n g(x) n y n=0 ¥ although formula for d is complicated if f(x) = ∑ a (x- x )n ,then f(x) is n n y n=0 continuous has derivates of all orders for x- x < r .
and f¢ , f¢¢ , f¢¢¢ … can be computed 0 1 by differentiating the series.
Thus f n(x ) ¥ f n(x ) a = 0 or f(x) = ∑ 0 (x- x )n …….

Determining the Radius of Convergence If we obtain the Taylor series of a function f(x) about a point x , then the 0 radius of convergence of the series is equal to the distance of the point x 0 from the nearest singularity.

(b) If the functions P(x), Q(x)and R(x) are polynomials having no common factors, the singular points of equation (1) are the points for which P(x) = 0 (5) Q(x) (c) If lim(x- x ) is finite 0 P(x) xﬁ x 0 Q(x) and lim(x- x )2 is finite 0 P(x) xﬁ x 0 Then the point x = x is called the REGULAR SINGULAR POINT of 0 equation (3) (d) Any singular point of equation (3) that is not regular singular point is called an irregular singular point.
3.3.1 Solution Near An Ordinary Point Let us consider the equation P(x)y¢¢ +Q(x)y¢ +R(x)y = 0 (6) Where P(x), Q(x)and R(x) are polynomials.
x is the ordinary point of the 0 equation (6).
Assuming that y =f (x) is a solution of (6) and f (x) has a Taylor Series ¥ y =f (x) = ∑ a (x- x )n (7) n y n=0 Now we know that f m(x) a = (8) m m!
We can write (1) y¢¢ +P(x)y¢ +q(x)y = 0 Q(x) R(x) where P = , q = R(x) P(x) \ y¢¢ = - Py¢ - qy (9) or y¢¢¢ = - p¢y¢¢ - P¢y¢ - q¢y- qy¢ (10) (It is natural to assume that y = y(x), y¢ = y¢(x) at x = x and y(0) = a , 0 1 y¢(0) = a , we can easily calculate the coefficient a a, provided that we could 2 n compute infinitely many derivatives of p and q existing at x .
Thus p 0 and q must have some condition for line calculation of a It has been n. proved that.
Q(x) R(x) P = , q = are analytic at x then the general solution of (6) R(x) P(x) 0., ¥ is y = ∑ a (x- x )n = a y (x)+a y (x) n 0 0 1 1 2 n=0 Where a and a are arbitrary y and y are linearly independent series n 1 1 2 solutions which are analytic at x .

Euler Equation d2y dy L(y) = x2 +a x +by = 0 (1) dx2 dx is known as Euler equation.
It is easy to see that x = 0 is a regular singular point of (1) In any interval not including the origin, (1) has a general solution of the form.
y = c y (x)+c y (x) , 1 1 2 2 y and y are linear, independent solution.
1 2 Here we assume that (1) has a solution of the form y = x2 L(x2) = x2(x2)¢ ¢ +a x(x2)¢ +bx2 = x2F(r) Where F(r) = r(r - 1)+a r+b (2) If rr is a root of the equation - (a - 1)+ (a - 1)2 - ub r = (3) 1 2 - (a - 1)- (a - 1)2 - ub r = (4) 2 2 \ F(r) = (r- r)(r- r ) 1 2 Case I (a - 1)2 - 4b > 0, then the roots are real and unequal and W(xr1,xr2) is non-vanishing for r „ r ) and x > 0.
Thus the general solution is 1 2 y = c xr1 +c xr2 x > 0 1 2 (a - 1) case ll (a - 1)2 - 4b = 0 , then r = r= - 1 2 2 and we have only one solution y (x) = xr1 1 of the differential equation.
We can obtain the second solution by the method of reduction.
We consider a different approach to obtain the solution.
L(xr) = xrF(r) If r = r, then 1 L(xr1) = xr1F(r) = 0 1 Now F(r) = (r- r)2 , if we differentiate 1 F(r) i.e \ F¢(r) = 2(r - r) and then set r = r, if given F¢(r) = 0,it suggest that 1 1 ¶ ¶ L(xr) = [xrF(r)] ¶ r ¶ r L(xrlogx) = xrlogxF(r)+r(r- r)xr 1 We set r = r, thus 1 L(xr1logx) = 0 \ y = xr1logx x > 0 2 is the second solution of (1) Thus the general solution is y =(c +c logx)xr1, x > 0 2 1 2 Case III (a - 1)2 - 4b <0), in this case, the root are complex, say r =l +im , r =l +im 1Thus the general solution is y =(c xl +im +c xl- )xr1im 2 1 2 = xl[c xim +c x- im ] 1 2 = xl[c eim logx +c e- im logx] 1 2 = xl[c cos(m logx)+c sin(m logx] 1 2 It is always possible to obtain a real valued solution of Euler equation (1) in the interval, by making the following changes d d d2 d2 =(- 1) , = dx x dx2 dx 2 in the equation, we have d2u du x 2 =x 2 +bu =0, x 2 x 2 >0 dx 2 dx It is obtained as above.
Since x x forx >0 - x =x forx >0 It follows that we read one, to replace forx by x in the above solution to obtain real valued solution valid in any interval not containing the origin To solve the Euler equation (1) x2y¢ ¢ + xa y¢ +by =0 in any interval not containing the origin substitute y = xr and compute the root r1and r2of the equation F(r) = r2 +(a - 1)r+b =0 If the roots are real and unequal y = c x r1 +c x r2 1 2 If the roots are real and equal y =(c +c log x x) x r1 1 2 If the roots are complex y = x l (c cos(m log x +c sin(m log x 1 2 For an Euler equation of the form (x- x )2y¢ ¢ +a (x- x )y¢ +by =0 0 0 Change the independent variable by t = x- xo)r or suppose the solution y =(x- xo)r Note: The situation for a general second order differential equation with a regular singular point is similar to that for an Euler equation.

If some of the P and q .
n‡ will not be zero.
However the essential n n character of the solution remains the same.
It is natural to seek the solution of the form of “Euler Solution” the power series.
¥ y = xr∑ a xn (3) n n=0 As part of our problem we have to determine (1) The values of r for which equation (1) has a solution of the form (3) (2) The recurrence relation for the a n ¥ (3) The radius of convergence of the series ∑ a xn n n=0 We shall illustrate the method by example Example I: Find the series solution of the equation 2xy¢¢ +(1+ x)y¢ - 2y =0 (1) Solution: x =0is the regular singular point of the equation.
We assume line solution ¥ y = ∑ a xn+r (2) n n=0 Direct substitution of y in (2) given ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ∑ 2(n+r)(n+r - 1)a xn+r +∑ (n+r)a xn+ r- 1 +∑ (n+r)a xn+z - 2∑ a xn+r =0 n n n n n=0 n=0 n=0 n=0 Now we shift the index of the second series in (3).
We get ¥ ¥ ∑ (n+r)(2n+2r- 1)a xn+ r- l +∑ (n+r- 2)a xn+r =0 (3) n n n=0 n=0 Once more we reason that the total coefficient of each power of x in the left member of (4) must vanish.
The second summation does start the contribution, until n =1.
Hence the equation determinants c and an are given by n =0 r(2r- 1)a =0 , but a „ 0 (5) 0 0 \ r(2r- 1)=0 (6) (6) is called the indicial equation.

Fourier Sine Series: Sometimes it is desirable to expand the function f(x) in a series involving Sine function only.
In order to get a Sine series for f(x)we introduced a function g(x)defined as follows g(x)= f(x) 0< x <c =- f(- x) - c < x <0 Thus g(x)is an odd function over the interval - c < x <0.

Fourier Cosine Series: In order to expand the function f(x)in a series involving cosine function only, such series is called Fourier Cosine Series.
We define h(x) = f(x) 0< x <c = f(- x) - c < x <0 It follows that h(x)is an even function of x.

This class of differential equations is very useful for practical applications.
We shall devote some time in studying them in this unit.
2.0 Objectives: At the end of this unit you should be able to - classify second order differential equations into homogeneous and non-homogeneous.

Similarly, a linear boundary condition a y(0)+a y¢¢(0)=c (2) 1 2 A boundary value problem is homogeneous if both its differential equation and in boundary conditions are homogeneous.
If not then it is non- homogeneous.
A typical linear homogeneous second order boundary value problem is of the form.
P(x)y¢¢ +Q(x)y¢ +R(x)y =0 (3) 0< x <1, a y(0)+a y¢¢(0)=0 (4) 1 2 b y(I)+b y¢(0)=0 (5) 1 2 Most of the problems, we will discuss are of the form given by (3) to (5).

Eigen Values and Eigen Functions Consider the differential equation y¢¢ + p(x,l )y¢ +q(x,l )y =0 0< x <1 (1) The boundary conditions a y(0)+a y¢(0) =0 (2) 1 2 b y(I)+b y¢(0)=0 (3) 1 2 Where l is arbitrary parameter.
Clearly the solution of (1) depends on x and l and can be written as y =c y (x,l )+c (x,l ), (4) 1 1 2 Where y and y are a fundamental solution of (1).
Substituting for y in the 1 1 1 boundary condition (2) and (3), yield.
c [a y (o,l )+a y¢(o,l )]+c [a y¢ (x,l )]=0 (5) 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 c [b y (i,l )+b y¢(i,l )]+c [b y¢ (i,l )]=0 (6) 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 A set of two linear homogeneous algebraic equations for the constant.
Such a set has solutions (other than c =c =0 if and only if the determinant of 1 2 coefficients D(l )vanishes i.e.
c [a y (o,l )+a y¢(o,l )] a y (o,l )+a y¢ (o,l ) 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 D(l ) = b y (i,l )+b y¢(i,l )] b y (i,l )+b y¢ (i,l )]=0 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 Values satisfying this determinant equation are the eigenvalues of the boundary- value problems (1), (2) and (3) Corresponding to each Eigen value is at least one non- trivial solution.
An Eigen function Note: We will consider problems namely only real eigen value Example I consider the equation y¢¢ +ly =0 (1) y(0), y(1) =0 (2) Solution: y¢¢ +ly =0, the solution is y =c cos x +c sin x , (3) 1 1 By the boundary conditions c =0s 1 c sin l =0 2 c „ 0, otherwise y =0 is the solution 2 sin l =0⇒ l = np , n =1,2,................ or l = np 2,4np 2 (4) (4) gives the eigen values of (1).

Similarly, a linear boundary condition a y(0)+a y¢¢(0)=c (2) 1 2 A boundary value problem is homogeneous if both its differential equation and in boundary conditions are homogeneous.
If not then it is non- homogeneous.
We also classified some equations into eigen value problem depending upon whether the determinant of the eigen value of the problem is zero or not.

Introduction We solved some partial differential equations by the method of separation of variables.
In the last step we expanded a certain function in a Fourier series, i.e.
as the sum of an infinite series of sine and cosine functions.
It is of fundamental importance that the eigen functions of a more general class of boundary values problems can be used as a basis for series expansions, which have properties similar to Fourier Series.
Such eigen- functions series are useful in extending the method of separation of values to a larger class of problems in partial differential equation.
The class of boundary value problem we will discuss is associated with the names of Sturm and Liouville.
2.0 Objectives: After studying this unit you should be able - to solve partial differential equation using Sturm and Liouville methods - solve correctly the associated Tutor Marked Assignments 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1.
Sturm and Liouville Problem We introduce the operator L[y]= - [p(x)y¢]+q(x)y (1) L[y]=lr(x)y (2) [P(x)y¢]¢ - q(x)y+lr(x)y =0 (3) on the interval 0< x <1, together with the boundary condition a y(0)+a y¢(0) =0 (4) 1 2 b y(I)+b y¢(1) =0 (5) 1 2 We shall assume that p,qand rare continuous functions in the interval [0,1].
P(x) >0,r(x)>0for all xin 0£ x £ 1.
(i) Lagrange’s identity: let u and v be functions having continuous second derivatives on the interval 0£ x £ 1.
Then ∫1 (UL[U]- UL[u])dx 0 = - p(x)[u¢(x)u(x)- u(x)u¢(x)] (6) Solution 1: ∫1 UL[U]dx∫1 {- u[p(x)u¢q(x)u}dx 0 0 = - u(py¢)+u¢p(x)u(x)+∫1 {- u(pu¢)+uqu}dx 0 \ ∫1 (uL[u]- UL[U])dx= - (px)[u¢(x)u(x)- u(x)u¢(x) 0 This is known as Lagrange’s identity if uand usatisfy (5) and (4) R.H.S = - p(1)[u¢(1)u(1)- u(1)u¢(1)] + p(0)[u¢(0)u(0)- u(0)u¢(0)] b b - p(1)[- 1 u(1)u(1)+ 1 u(1)u(1)] b b 2 2 a a + p(0)[- 1 u(0)u(0)+ 1 u(0)u(0)] a a 2 2 =0 Thus we have ∫1 {u[u]- uL[u]dx =0 0 (ii) Show that all the eigen value of the Sturm-Liouville problem L(y)=lr(x)y A With boundary conditions a y(0)+a y¢(0) =0 B 1 2 b y(I)+b y¢(1) =0 1 2 are real.
Proof: let us suppose there exists a complex eigen valuel = m +iv will v „ 0 and corresponding to this value is the eigen function Q(x) =U(x)+IV(x) Where at least one of them is not identically zero.
Now Q satisfies the differential equation L[Q)=lrQ L[Q]=pRQ or u =Q and u =Q ∫1 {QL(Q)- QL(Q)]dx = ∫1 (l - l ¢) 0 0 r(x)Q(x)Q(x)dx =0 or2r∫1 r(x)[V2(x)+V2(x)dx =0 ……….
(1) 0 Since r(x) >0 for all x in 0£ x £ 1(1) ⇒v =0 This contradicts the original hypothesis.
Hence the eigen value of Sturm- Liouville problem are real.
(iii) If Q and Q are eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem (A) 1 2 and (B), corresponding to eigen valves l and l , respectively , 1 2 and l +l , then 1 2 ∫1 r(x)Q (x)Q (x)dx =0 1 2 0 [r(x)is called the weight function and it is an orthogonal property of eigenfunction] Proof: - L[Q ]l rQ 1 1 1 L[Q ]l rQ 2 2 2 If we let = U =Q and U =Q then 1 2 ∫1 {uL[U]- UL[U]}dx 0 l - l ∫1 r(x)Q (x)Q (x)dx =0 1 2 1 2 0 Hence the result (iv) Let us now consider a more general boundary value problem for the differential equation L[y]=lM[y], 0< x <1 Where L and M are linear homogeneous differential operations of orders n and n respectively.
L[y]= p (x)y(n) + p (x)y(n- 1) +........+ p (x)y¢ + p (x)y 0 1 n- 1 n M[y]= r (x)y(m) +r (x)y(m- 1) +........+2 (x)y¢ +r (x)y 0 1 m- 1 m Where n> m. In addition to the differential equation a set of n linear homogeneous boundary conditions at x =0, x =1is also prescribed.
If the relations ∫1 (uL[u]- uL[u]dx =0 0 ∫1 (uM[u]- uM[u]dx =0 0 are line for every pair of functions u and u, which are n- lines continuously differentiable on 0,land which satisfy un given boundary conditions, then the given boundary valve problem is said to be self adjoint.
Problem I.
Show that the Sturm-Liouville problems L(y)- [P(x)y¢]+q(x)y M(y)=lr(x)y (i) ∫1 [UM[u]- uM[u]dx 0 ∫1 [Ulr(x)u- ulr(x)u]dx 0 =0 For every pair of u, u  ∫1 [UL[u]- uL[u]dx =0 0 as shown previously.
Hence it is self-adjoint Problem (a) y¢¢ + y¢ +2y =0 y =0, y =(I) =0 Solution L(y) = y¢¢ + y¢ +2y (i) ∫1 [U(u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)- u(u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)dx 0 = - 2∫1 u¢udx, are true for every pair of function u and u, which are n- 0 times continuously differentiable on [o,l] which satisfy un given boundary value problem is said to be self-adjoint.
Solution: Sturm-Liouville problems L(y) = - [p(x)y¢]+q(x)y M(y)=lr(x)y (i) ∫1 [UM(u)- uM(u)]dx 0 ∫1 [Ulr(x)- ulr(x)]dx 0 =0 as shown previously.
Hence it is not self-adjoint.
Problem y¢¢ + y¢ +2y =0 y =0, y =(I) =0\ Solution L(y) = y¢¢ + y¢ +2y y =0, y =(I) =0 ∫1 [U(u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)- u(u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)]dx 0 ∫1 [UL(u)- uL(u)]dx =0 0 as shown previous.
Hence it self-adjoint Problem (a) Problem y¢¢ + y¢ +2y =0 y =0, y =(I) =0\ Solution L(y) = y¢¢ + y¢ +2y y =0, y =(I) =0 ∫1 [U(u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)- u(u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)]dx 0= - 2∫1 u¢udx =0, u¢ and u¢ are continuous in the interval 0£ x £ 1.
Hence it is 0 not zero.
Thus it is not self-adjoint.
Problem(b) (x+x2)y¢ ¢ +2xy¢ + y =0 y¢ =0, y =(1)+2y¢(1) =0 L(y) =(1+ x2)U¢ ¢ +2xy¢ ¢ + y =0, y¢ =(0) =0 y =(1)+2y¢(1) =0, L(y) =(1+ x2)y¢ ¢ +2xy¢ + y M(y) =0 ∫1 [U[(1+ x2)u¢ (u¢ ¢ +u¢ +2u)]dx =0 0 It is Sturm-Liouville problem.
(c) y¢¢ + y =ly, (y) =0- y¢(0)- y¢(1) =0 y¢ =0- y¢(0)- y¢(1) =0 Solution L(y) =(1+ x2)y¢ ¢ +2xy¢ + y M(y) = y (i) ∫1 (uM(m )- UM(m )dx 0 ∫1 (uu- uu)dx =0 0 (ii) ∫1 (u¢ ¢u)- U(m¢ ¢)dx] 0 = ∫1 (uu¢ ¢ - u¢ ¢u)dx 0 =uu¢ - uu¢ =[u(1)u¢(1)- u(1)u¢(1) - [u(1)u(0)- u(1)u¢(0)] =[u(1)u(0)- u(I)u(0) The right side is not zero.
Hence it is not self-adjoint.
Problem 3 Consider the differential equation y¢¢ +ly+2y =0 \ With boundary conditions  y =(0)- y(I)=0, y¢ =(0)- y¢(1)=0 (a) Show that the problem is self-adjoint even though it is not a Sturm- Liouville problem.
Find all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the given problem (b) Solution: L(y) = y¢¢ M(y)= - y (i) ∫1 [UM(u)- u(- u)dx]=0 0 ∫1 [U(- u)- u(- u)]dx =0 0 (ii) ∫1 [u(uu¢ ¢ - uu¢ ¢]dx 0 =(uu¢)- ∫1 (u¢ u¢dx- u¢u+∫1 u¢ u¢dx 0 0 =[(1)u¢(I)- u¢(I)u(I)] - [(0)u¢(0)- u¢(0)u(0)] - [(0)u¢(0)- u¢(0)u(0)] - [(0)u¢(0)- u¢(0)u(0)]=0 Hence it is self-adjoint The solution of the equation is y =c cos x +c sin l x 1 2 Applying the boundary conditions, we have c l sin l +c sin l (1- cos l =0 1 2 c (cos l - 1+c sin l =0 1 2 Thus l sin l l (1- cos l cos l - 1 sin l =0 Or l (1- cos l =0⇒ l =0 or l =(2n- p )2, n =1,2,........... l =0 j (x) =1 0 0l =(2n- p )2 n \ Q (x) =cos2npx, \ Q (x) =sin2npx, n n y =cos2npx, y =sin2npx, 1 2 y =cos2npx, y = 2npxcos2npx, 1 2 cos2npx sin2npx W(y y = 1 2) - 2np sinnpx 2np cos2npx 2npxcos2 2npx+2np sin2 npx 2np „ 0 0‹ x Between 0£ x £ 1 Thus the eigen functions are lining independent.
