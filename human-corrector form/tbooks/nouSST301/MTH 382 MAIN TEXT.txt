It gives you guidance in respect of your Tutor-Marked Assignment which will be made available in the assignment file.
There will be regular tutorial classes that are related to the course.
It is advisable for you to attend these tutorial sessions.
The course will prepare you for the challenges you will meet in Mathematical Methods IV.
Course Aim MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV The aim of the course is to provide you with an understanding of Mathematical Methods IV.
It also aims to give you a modern way of solving complex problems in Mathematics, make clear distinctions on the ways we handle problems in Real Analysis, and provide you with solutions to some problems that may arise in Engineering and other areas of human endevour.
Course Objectives To achieve the aims set out, the course has a set of objectives.
Each unit has specific objectives which are included at the beginning of the unit.
You should read these objectives before you study the unit.
You may wish to refer to them during your study to check on your progress.
You should always look at the unit objectives after completion of each unit.
By doing so, you would have followed the instructions in the unit.
Below are comprehensive objectives of the course as a whole.
By meeting these objectives, you would have achieved the aims of the course as a whole.
In addition to the aims above, this course sets to achieve some objectives.
Thus, after going through the course, you should be able to:  determine Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions  solve Special Functions such as Gama Functions, Beta Functions, and Legendry Functions etc  solve Partial Differential Equations Working through This Course To complete this course, you are required to read each study unit, read the textbooks and read other materials which may be provided by the National Open University of Nigeria.
Each unit contains Self-Assessment Exercises and at certain points in the course, you would be required to submit assignments for assessment purposes.
At the end of the course there is a final examination.
The course should take you about a total of 17 weeks to complete.
Below you will find listed all the components of the course, what you have to do and how you should allocate your time to each unit in order to complete the course on time and successfully.
This course entails that you spend a lot of time to read.
I would advice that you avail yourself of the opportunities of the tutorial classes provided by the University.
ii MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV Presentation Schedule Your course materials have important dates for the early and timely completion and submission of your TMAs and attending tutorials.
You should remember that you are required to submit all your assignments by the stipulated time and date.
You should guard against falling behind in your work.
Assessment There are three aspects to the assessment of the course.
The first is made up of Self-Assessment Exercises, the second consists of the Tutor- Marked Assignments and third is the written examination/end of course examination.
You are advised to do the exercises.
In tackling the assignments, you are expected to apply information, knowledge and technique you gathered during the course.
The assignments must be submitted to your facilitator for formal assessment in accordance with deadlines stated in the presentation schedule and the assignment file.
The work you submit to your tutor for assessment will count for 30% of your total course work.
At the end of the course you will need to sit for a final or end of course examination of about three hours duration.
This examination will count for 70% of your total course mark.
Tutor-Marked Assignment The TMA is a continuous assessment component of your course.
It accounts for 30% of the total score.
You will be given four (4) TMAs to answer.
Three of these must be answered before you are allowed to sit for the end of course examination.
The TMA would be given to you by your facilitator and returned after you have done the assignment.
Assignment questions for the units in this course are contained in your reading references and study units.
However, it is desirable in all degree level of education to demonstrate that you have read and researched more into your references, which will give you a wider view point and may provide you with a deeper understanding of the subject.
Make sure that each assignment reaches your facilitator on or before the deadline given in the presentation schedule and assignment file.
If for any reason you can not complete your work on time, contact your facilitator before the assignment is due to discuss the possibility of an extension.
Extension will not be granted after the due date.
Final Examination and Grading iii MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV The end of course examination for Mathematical Methods IV is about 3 hour and has a value of 70% of the total course work.
The examination will consist of questions, which will reflect the type of self-testing, practice exercise and tutor-marked assignment problems you have previously encountered.
All areas of the course will be assessed.
Use the time between finishing the last unit and sitting for the examination, to revise the whole course.
You might find it useful to review your self-test, TMAs and comments on them before the examination.
Course Marking Scheme Assignment Marks Assignment 1 - 4 Four assignments, best three marks of the four count at 10% each – 30% of course marks End of course examination 70% overall course marks.

A differential equation is a functional equation where the unknown function or functions are present as derivatives with respect to a single variable in the case of an ordinary differential equation.
The order of the highest derivative is called the order of the equation.
Derivatives in a differential equation can occur in various ways and we do not admit equations where the unknown is subjected to other operations than algebraic and differential equations.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  classify various types of differential equation  answer correctly exercises on differential equations.
1 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definitions and Examples A differential equation is a functional equation where the unknown function or functions are present as derivatives with respect to single variables in the case of an ordinary differential equation.
Consider the following six examples of functional equations involving derivatives.
Some are bona fide equations while some are not: Example (1): f (x)  f(x) Example (2): f (x)  f(x1) Example (3): f (x)  a (x)a (x)f(x)a (x)[f(x)]2 0 1 2 Example (4): f (x)  6x[f(x)]2 x Example (5): f (x)   {1[f(s)]2}1/2ds 0 1 Example (6): f(x)   {[f (s)]2 [f(x)]2}1/2ds 0 Examples 1 and 3 are ordinary and first order differential equations, while example 2 is a difference differential equation, not a differential equation in the usual sense.
Example 4 is a second order differential equation.
Example 5 is not a differential equation as it stands but on differentiating will yield f (x) {1[f(x)]2}1/2 which is a second order differential equation equivalent to example 4.
Finally, example 6 is not a differential equation and is not reducible to such an equation by elementary means.
The normal form of a first order differential equation is given as y F(x,y) .
.
.
(1) In the simplest case, x and y are real variables and F(x,y) is a function on R2 toR1.
We can also allow x and y to be complex variables and F to be a function on C2 to C1.
We can also let y  (y ,y ,y ,y ,.......,y ) and F= (F ,F ,F ,......,F ) …….
(2) 1 2 3 4 n 1 2 3 n Where y and F are functions on Rn1 to R1.
We then define the derivative of a vector as the vector of the derivatives: y (y,y,y,......,y) …… (3) 1 2 3 n 2 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV With this notation, equation (1) becomes a condensed convenient way of writing a system of first order differential equations: y(x)  F (x,y ,y ,y ,.....,y ), j 1,2,3,......,n .
.
.
(4) j j 1 2 3 n Conversely, every such system can be writing as a first order vector differential equation.
The generalisation has the advantage of covering nth order equations.
To convert nth order differential equation in y to a first order vector equation in y, we set y  (y,y,y,......,y(n1)) ….
(5) We can consider differential equations in more general spaces than the Euclidean.
Here, the interpretation of the derivatives becomes a matter of concern, and convergence questions also arise if the space is of infinite dimension.
Differential equations normally have infinite number of solutions.
In order to find a particular one we have to impose some special conditions on the solution, usually an initial condition.
The intent of an existence theorem is to show that there exists a function which satisfies the equation in some neighborhood of point (x ,y ).
A uniqueness theorem 0 0 asserts that there is only one such function.
We can, however, assert the existence of solution under much more general conditions than those which guarantee uniqueness.
This is beyond the scope of this course.
4.0 CONCLUSION We have examined differential equations in a general setting in this unit.
This unit is important to the understanding of other units that would follow subsequently.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have a general introduction to various forms of differential equations.
This unit must be read carefully before proceeding to the other units.

3 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV x 2.
Transform f(x)   [f(s)]2ds into differential equation.
Here 0 f(x)0 is obviously a solution.
Are there other solutions of the functional equation?
x 3.
The functional equation f(x)1 f(s)ds implies that f 0 satisfies a differential equation.
Find the latter and find the common solution.

To apply this theorem successfully we have to replace the differential equation by an equivalent integral equation that can be used to define a contraction operator on a suitably chosen metric space.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  apply the contraction fixed point theorem  determine the existence of solutions for a given differential Equation  solve correctly the tutor-marked assignment that follows.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Fixed Point Method Consider the following differential equation defined by f (x)  F[x, f(x)], f(x ) y … (1) 0 0 Here F (F ,F ,.....,F ) is a vector valued function defined and 1 2 n continuous in B: x x  a, y y b 0 0 5 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV We may define the norm on Rn as follows: 1/2  n  (y  y ) or max y  y  j j0  j j0   1 We impose two further conditions on F : F(x,y)  M … (2) F(x,y )F(x,y )  K y  y … (3) 1 2 1 2 Conditions (1) and (2) are called boundedness and Lipschitz conditions respectively.
We now replace the vector differential equation by a vector integral equation defined as: x f(x)  y  F[s, f(s)]ds … (4) 0 x 0 We again impose the following property which follows from the definitions of integrals by Riemann as: x x  Fds   F ds,x  x … (5) 0 x x 0 0 Theorem (1): Under the stated assumptions on F, the equation (1) has a unique solution defined in the interval (x r,x r) where 0 0 b 1 r  min(a, , ) M K Proof: We consider the space N of all functions g(x) on R1 to Rn continuous in x (x r,x r) such that g(x )  y and g  y b 0 0 0 0 0 N where g  y sup g(x) y .. For such, a g(x) the function F[x,g(x)] 0 N x 0 exists and is continuous.
Furthermore, its N-norm does not exceed M. We now define the transformation: x T :g(x) y  F[s,g(s)]ds, r  x x  r … (6) 0 0 x 0 6 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV Here, T[g](x) is continuous,T[g](x )  y and 0 0 T[g](x) y  Mr b .
.
.
(7) 0 (by the choice of r).
It follows that T[g]N .
We next observe that x x T[g ](x)T[g ](x)  {F[s,g (s)]F[s,g (s)]}ds  K  g (s) g (s) ds 1 2 1 2 1 2 x x 0 0 This shows that T[g ]T[g ]  Kr g  g  k g  g 1 2 N 1 2 N 1 2 N Where Kr  k 1 by choice of r. Hence T is a contraction.
This implies that there exist one and only one function f(x)N such that x f(x) y  F[s, f(s)]ds, f(x )  y is the unique solution of the 0 0 0 x 0 differential equation (1) with the stated initial condition.
4.0 CONCLUSION We have shown that we can apply the fixed point theorem to establish the existence of solution to the differential equation stated in (1).
You are supposed to master the concept developed in this unit before proceeding to the next unit.
5.0 SUMMARY The contraction fixed point theorem applied in this unit enables us to develop a unique solution to the differential equation stated in (1).
It is one of the most powerful theorems in mathematical analysis.
It can be extended to spaces of infinitely in many dimensions.
However, this is beyond the scope of this unit.

8 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV UNIT 3 THE METHOD OF SUCCESSIVE APPROXIMATIONS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 The Method of Successive Approximations 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION The method of successive approximations is a refinement of the old device of trial and error.
What has been added is control of the limiting process.
We know how often the process must be repeated to bring the result with the desired limit of tolerance.
The method of trial and error can be traced back to Isaac Newton who was the first to be concerned with approximate solution of algebraic equation.
An infinite iteration process for the positive solution of the transcendental equation defined as: x arctanx, 1< …….. (A) was given by Joseph Fourier in his Theorie Analytique de la Chaleur (1822).
Fourier’s argument is geometrical and highly intuitive.
It is not difficult to give a strict analytic convergence proof.
The method of successive approximation was given by Emile Picard for differential equation in 1891.
This method soon became the standard method for proving existence and uniqueness theorems for all sorts of functional equations.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At end of this unit, you should be able to:  apply the method of successive approximation to  determine existence and uniqueness of differential  equation.
9 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Method of Successive Approximations Let us consider a vector differential equation defined by y F(x,y),y(x ) y .
.
.
0 0 (1) F(x,y) is defined and continuous in: B: x x  a y y b, F(x,y)  M 0 0 (2) F(x,y ) F(x,y )  K y  y 1 2 1 2 (3) We shall state the following theorem: Theorem (1): There exists a unique function f(x),on,R1to,Rn defined for x x  r , where 0 b r  min(a, ) M (4) Proof: We replace the differential equation with the initial by the equivalent integral equation: x f(x)  y  F[s, f(s)]ds (5) 0 x 0 f (x) y 0 0 Now define x f (x)  y  F[s, f (s)]ds,m 1,2,3,.... (6) m 0 m1 x 0 For these functions to be well defined, we restrict x to the interval (x r,x r).
Suppose it is known that for some value of m, the 0 0 function f (x) is well defined in this interval.
It is obvious that f (x)  y , m1 m1 0 but the induction hypothesis must also include that f (x) is m1 continuous and 10 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV f (s) y b.
We then see that F[s, f (s)] is well defined and m1 0 m1 continuous.
Furthermore: F[s, f (s)]  M , m1 Hence x  F[s, f (s)]ds, exist as a continuous function of x and its norm does m1 x 0 not exceed M x x  Mr b by the choice of r. 0 This implies that f (x) is also continuous and satisfies m f (x )  y , f (x) y b m 0 0 m 0 It follows that the approximation are well defined for all m. To prove the existence of lim f (x), we resort to the Lipschitz condition.
We m have x x f (x) f (x)   {F[s, f (s)]F[s, f (s)]}ds  K  f (s) f (s) ds m m1 m1 m2 m1 m2 x x 0 0 We know that for some m we have the estimate Km2 f (s) f (s)  M s x m1, s x  r m1 m2 (m1)!
0 0 (7) This estimate is certainly very true for m  2.
We then get f (x) f (x)  Km1 M x s x m1ds  Km1 M x x m. Therefore m m1 (m1)!
x 0 m!
0 0 the estimate is true for all m Hence the series  f (x)[f (x) f (x)] 0 n n1 n1 (8) Whose partial sum is f (x), converges in norm for x x  r m 0 uniformly in x.Hence,it,sum, f(x), is a continuous function on R1 Rn.
The strong uniform convergence of the vector series (8) obviously implies the absolute and uniform convergence of the n component series to continuous functions onR1,to,Rn.
The estimate (7) obviously implies that 11 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV Km f(x) f (x)  M exp(K xx )xx m…… (9) m m!
0 0 It is an easy matter to observe that if x x is not large, f (x) 0 m converges rapidly to its limit f(x).
Therefore, from the uniform convergence of f (x)to f(x) it follows that F[s, f (s)] converges to m m1 uniformly to F[s, f(s)] and x x  F[s, f (s)]ds   F[s, f(s)]ds uniformly in x.
From (6) it follows m1 x x 0 0 that f(x)satisfies (5) and consequently, the differential equation and the initial condition.
That this is the only solution also follows from the Lipschitz condition.
So to prove uniqueness we may suppose that g(x) is a solution defined in some interval (x r ,x r ).
Then 0 1 0 1 x g(x) y  F[s,g(s)]ds, and if x x  min(r,r ) we have 0 0 1 x 0 x x f(x) g(x)   {F[s, f(s)]F[s,g(s)]}ds  K  f(s) g(s) ds x x 0 0 Set h(x)  h(x) g(x) , then h(x) is a continuous non-negative function x that satisfies, 0 h(x) K  h(s)ds .
Hence h(x) is identically 0. x 0 Therefore, f(x) is the only solution of (1) with f(x )  y 0 0 4.0 CONCLUSION Various questions arise when we want to use theorem (1) above.
The first of these concerns the effective determination of a, b and M and the verification of the Lipschitz condition.
We leave this for future considerations.
We have justified the existence of solution to functional differential equations.
We have also proved the uniqueness of this solution.
You are required to read carefully before proceeding to the next unit.
5.0 SUMMARY We have proved the existence of functional differential equations by successive approximation methods.
Successive approximation method is essentially an iterative method that needs to be carefully designed to give a solution to the differential equation under consideration.
Once the equivalent integral equation of the given differential equation is known, then it is just an easy matter to design the appropriate iterative scheme 12 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV for the equation, which will eventually converge to the solution of the equation.

These functions are of very useful mathematical importance in solving differential equations and other applied mathematics problems.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  define beta function, gamma function, and factorial notations  apply these functions to solve mathematical problems.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Special Functions Below are some of the special functions worthy of note.
14 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV 3.1.1 Gamma Functions One of the most important functions is the gamma function, written and defined by the integral (1) () ett1dt 0 (More generally, if we consider also complex values, for those twhose real part is positive).
By integration by parts, we find (1) ettdt ett   ett1dt() 0 0 0 Thus we obtain the important functional relation of the gamma function (2) (1)() Let us suppose that the ve integer, say, n.

Such equations occur frequently in application of mathematics.
We shall only discuss certain partial differential equations which are used frequently in applied mathematics.
In fact, we are going to discuss a kind of boundary value problems which enters modern applied mathematics at every turn.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  recognise partial differential equations by type and character  explain the methods of solving partial differential equations  apply the knowledge in some other related field.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Some Examples of Partial Differential Equations in Applied Mathematics Many linear problems in applied mathematics involve the solution of an equation obtained by specialising the form.
d2 d 2 f   (1) dt2 dt Where f is a specified function of position and  and  are certain specified physical constant.
Here, 2 is the Laplacian operator in one, two or dimension under consideration and is of the form.
47 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV d2 d2 d2 2    (2) dx2 dy2 dz2 In rectangular co-coordinator of three space, the unknown function  is the function of the position co-ordinates (x, y, z) and the tine t. (i) Laplace Equation 20 (3) It is satisfied by the velocity potential in an ideal incompressible fluid without vertical or continuously distributed sources; and by gravitational potential in free space; electrostatic potential in the steady flow of electric currents in solid conductors, and by the steady-state temperature distribution in solids.
(ii) Poisson’s Equation 2 f  0 (4) is satisfied, for example, by the velocity potential of an incompressible, irrotational, ideal fluid with continuously distributed sources or by steady temperature distribution due to distributed heat sources, and by a ‘sheds function’ involved in the elastic torsion of prismatic bars, with a suitably prescribed function f. (iii) Wave Equation 1 2 2 (5) c t2 This arises in the study of propagation of waves with velocity c, independent of the wave length.
In particular, it is satisfied by the components of the electric or magnetic vector in electromagnetic theory, by suitably chosen component of displacement, in the theory of elastic vibrations, and by the velocity potential in the theory of sound (acoustics) for a perfect gas.

The temperature v can be considered constant on any given cross section.
v U(x,t).
2 is a constant known as v U(x,t).
In addition, we shall assume that the ends v U(x,t).of the bar are held at temperature zero: thus v  0when and x e.
u(o,t) 0, u(l,t)0, t 0, (1) Finally, the initial distribution of temperature in the bar is assumed to be given thus U(x,o) h(x) 0 x l (2) (1) and (2) are called boundary conditions We assume that u(x,t)  f(x)g(t) (3) Substituting equation (3) for u(x,t)in (1) yields 2 f(x)g(t)  f(x)g(t) (4) or f (x) g'(t) 2  (5) f(x) g(t) Now equation (5) is said to have its variable separated; that is, the left member of equation (5) is a function of x alone and the right member of equation (5) is a function ofx (5) alone.
Since x and tare independent variables, the only way in which a function of x alone can equal to function of t alone is for each function to be constant.

This is the essence of the method of separation of variables.
Boundary Conditions xv(o,t)  f(o)g(t) 0 (8) by (1), if g(t)= 0 then ux,twill be identically zero.
It is not acceptable because it does not satisfy the equation (2).
Thus it must satisfy the condition f(o) 0 (9) Similarly, the boundary condition at x(l) U(l,t) 0requires f(l) 0 (10) There are two possible values of the constant k i.e.
k  0or k  0.
Values of the constantk: (i) k  0, then the general solution of equation (6) is f(x)c c (11) 1 2 (11) Must satisfy the boundary value conditions (9) and (10).
In order to satisfy (9) f(o)c c  c 0 (12) 1 2 2 It is also satisfies the equation (10)  f(l) c l c 0 Since l  o.

Thus, the equation (6) becomes f (x)2 f(x)  0 (14) and its general solution is f b eix b eix (15) 1 2 Applying the boundary condition (9) and (10), we have b b 0 (16) 1 2 f beix b eix  0 1 2 The system (16) has a non-trivial solution k 0 and k 0always, but 1 2 it is not acceptable u(x,t)is identically zero.

The functions u are sometimes called fundamental solution of the heat conduction n problem (a) (1) and (2).
By the boundary condition (2) we get from (26).
nx u (x,o)  c sin (27) n n l For n 1,2,........... Each solution given by (27) satisfies the differential equation and the boundary condition.
Since partial differential equation involved is linear and homogeneous in u and its derivatives, a sum of solution are also a solution.
From the known solutions, u u .........u ,..........we may thus 1, 2 n construct others with sufficiently strong convergence condition.

Example: Elastic string with non-zero initial displacement First, suppose that string is displaced from its equilibrium position, and then released with zero velocity at time t = 0 to vibrate freely.

Assuming that U(x,t)  X(x) T (t) (4) Substituting u in (1), we get X 1 Tt   X 2 T (4) We assume that is real (we shall prove it somewhere else.
We consider these cases  = 0, -ve and +ve.

Thus, K  0.
Next consider the second boundary 2 condition U(l,t)  0 then U(l,t)  (K l)T(t)  0 K  0 1 1 Thus X(x) = 0, it is not acceptable.

n For a fixed value of n the function na nx 2l Sin Cos is periodic in time t with the period ; it therefore l l n represents a vibratory motion of the string having this period or having nx na the frequency .
The quantities a  for n=1, 2,…… are the l l na natural frequencies of the string.
The factor K Sin represents the n l displacement pattern occurring in the string, when it is executing vibrations of the given frequency.
In the case of heat conduction problem, it is attempting to try to show this by directly substituting equation (20) for U(x,t) in (1), (2) and (3), we compute.
 n nx nat U (x,t)   K ( )2Sin Cos xx n l l l n1 (21) Due to the presence of the factor n2in the numerator, this series may not converge.
It is not possible to justify directly with respect to either variable in 0,l and t>0, provided h is twice continuously differentials on (,).
This require f and fare continuous on [o,l].
Furthermore, sinceh, we must have f(o)  f(l)  0 Example: General problem for inelastic string.

We establish the validity in a different way.
We show 1 U(x,t)   h(xt)h(xt)  (22) 2 Where h is function obtained by extending the initial data f(x) into (-l,o) as an odd function, and other values of x as a periodic function on period 2l.
That is h(x2l)  h(x).
Now  nx h(x)   K Sin n l n1 Then  nx nt nt nt h(xt)   K (Sin Cos Cos Sin ) n l l l n1   nx nx nt U(x,t)U(x,t)Sin CSin KCos n n n l l l n1 n1 Equation h is the function (20) follows on adding the two equations.
62 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV Note: [If f(x)has a Fourier series, then it must be periodic and continuous].
1.
If U(x,t)is continuous for 0  x  l and t  0provided that h is requires that f is continuous on line interval (,).
This requires that f is continuous on the interval (o,l) and, since h is odd periodic extension of f, that f be zero at x=0 and x=p.

U is twice continuously differentiable t=0, we get  na na U (x,0)   C Sin  g(x) (7) t e n l n1 na Hence the coefficients ( )C are the coefficients in the Fourier Sine l n series of period 2l for g: Thus na  C 2l  g(x)Sinnxdx, n=1,2……….

The problem of finding a solution of Laplace equation which takes on given boundary values is known as Dirichilet problem.

(i) If K=0 then X  0 and Y  0 , and U(x,y)  (K  K )(C yC ) 1x 2 1 2 (5) The homogeneous boundary conditions y=0 and y=b can be satisfied y C C  0U(x,y),is identically zero.
Hence K=0 is acceptable.

The function f()may be extended outside the interval.
So also it is periodic of period 2,and has a Fourier series of the function (14).

Since each of the terms in the Fourier series (8) is periodic with period 2c, the series converges for all x whenever it converges in cxc., and its sum is also a periodic function with period 2c.
Hence f(x) is determined for all x by its values in the interval cxc.. 69 MTH382 MATHEMATICAL METHODS IV 4.0 CONCLUSION You have been introduced to partial differential equation in this unit.
