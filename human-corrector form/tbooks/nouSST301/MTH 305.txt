We need another set – the complex numbers.
In this course we will do analysis on complex variables and establish those results which are analogue to the real number systems.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will learn about: • variables and functions of complex number • functions and transformation or complex variables.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT A symbol, such as z, which can stand for any complex number is called a complex variable.
If to each value a complex variable z can assume there correspondence one or more values of a complex variable w, we say that W is a ( ) ( ) function of z and write w= f z or w= g z etc.
The variable z is sometimes called an independent variable while w is called a dependent variable.
The value ( ) of a function at z = a is often written as f a .
35 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) e.g.
f z = zz, for z =3i, f(z) = f(3i) = - 9.
If one value of w corresponds to each value of z, we sat that w is a single-valued function of z or that f(z)each value of z, we say w is a multiple- valued or many-valued function of z.
Example: ifw= z3, then to each value of z there is only one value of w. w= f(z)= z3 is a single-valued function of z.
Example If w= z12 3.2 Transformations If w=u+iv (where u and v are real) is a single-valued function of z =u =iy (where x and y are real), we can writeu+iv = f(x+iy).
By equating real and imaginary parts this is equivalent to u =u(x,y), v = v(x,y).………………………………………..… ……….
(1) ( ) Hence, given a point x,y in the z –plane, there corresponds a ( ) point u,v in the w plane.
The set of equations (1) [or the ( ) equivalent, w= f z ] is called a transformation.
Example 1 Ifw= z2, then f(z2) =(x+iy)2 = x2 - y2 +2xy Hence,u(x,y) = x2 - y2 and v(x,y) = 2xy Example 2 ( ) 1 Let w= f z = for z z (.)
( ) 1 1 x- iy x- iy f z = = = ( )( ) = z x+iy x+iy x- iy x2 + y3 36 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II Hence, x - y u(x,y) = and v(x,y) = x2 + y2 x2 + y2 3.3 The Elementary Functions 1.
Polynomial Functions: Polynomial functions P(z) are defined as P(z) = a zh +a zh- 1 +.................+a z+a where 0 1 h- 1 h a „ 0, a ,.........,a are complex constants and h is a positive 0 1 n integer called the degree of the polynomialP(z).
P(z) 2.
Rational Algebraic Function are defined by F(z) = ( ) where J z ( ) P(z) and J z are polynomials.
3.
Exponential Functions are defined by w= f(z) =lx+iy =lx (Cos y - i Sin y) where e is the natural base of logarithms.
(e=2.71828).
complex exponential functions have properties similar to those of real exponential functions.
For example lz1•lz2 =lzi+z2,lz1/lz2 =lz1- z2 lz1 •lz2 =lx1(Cos y1+ i siny1)•lx2(Cos y2+i Sin y2) ( ) =lx1 +lx2( Cos y +iSiny ) Cis y +iSiny 1 1 2 2 ( )( ) = ex1 - ex2 Cos yi+1Sinyi Cos y +1Sin y 2 2 [ ] =ex1 +n Cos y Cos y + i Cos y Sin y +1Siny Cosy - Sin y Siny 2 1 2 i 2 1 2 1 2 = ex1+x2 [(Cos y Cos y - Siny Siny )+i(Cos y Siny +Siny Cos y )] 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ) = ex1+x2Cos y + y + i Sin y + y 1 2 1 2 = ez1+z2 Note that when w=ez, the number w can be written as w= reif where r =exand f = y If we think of w=ez as a transformation from z to the w plane, we thus find that any non zero point w= reif is the z- Log r +if Therefore the range of the exponential function w=ezid the entire nonzero point w= peif is actually the image of an infinite number of points in the z plane under the transformationw=ez.
For in general, f may have any one of the values 37 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II •( ) f =F +2n- n =0,– 1,– 2... where F denotes the principal value of argw.
It (cid:217) then follows that w is the image of all the points.
( ) z =log r +iF +ip 1n = 0, m1, – 2,....
Example: find all values of z such that ez= - 1 Solution ez =exeiy,and - 1=1eip so that exeiy =1eip By equality of two complex numbers in exponential form, this means that ex - 1and y =p +2np where n is an integral.
n =log1=0, then ( ) ( ) z = 2n+1p n =0,– 1, – 2.....
Example: Find the values of zfor which e4z =1 Solution: e4z =i e4x.e4yi =e1.i So that, by equality, w have eyx =e0 ⇒ 4x=0⇒ n =0 and p 4y = 2np + 2 1np 0 1p 0 ( ) y = + for h =0, – 1, – 2,... 2 8 1 1 The solution is then np ic– pc 2 8 38 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 .

e.g.
Sin2z+Cos2z =1, 1+1tan2 z =Sec2z, 1+wt2z =csc2 z.
( ) ( ) ( ) Sin - z= - Sinz Cos - z =Cosz tan - z= - tanz ( ) Sin z – z = Sinz Cosz – Cosz Sinz 1 2 1 2 1 2 ( ) Cos z – z = Cos z Cosz – Sinz Sinz 1 2 1 2 1 2 ( ) tanz – tanz tan z – z = 1 2 .

1 2 1– tanhz tanhz 1 2 These properties can easily be proved from the definitions.
For example, to show that: Cosh2z- Sinh2z =1, we observed that, ez +e- z 2 ez - e- z 2 Cosh2z- Sinh2z =  -        2   2  ( ) ( ) = 1 e2z +2e2e- z +e- 2z - 1 e2z - 2eze- z +e2 2 4 ( 4 ) = 1 e2z +2+e- 2z - e2z +2- e- 2z 4 = 4 =1.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions To define the inverse sin functionSin- 1z, we write w= Sin- 1z whenz = Sinw .
That is eiw - e- iw w= Sin- 1z , when z = 21 Which is equivalent to: ( ) ( ) eiw 2 - 2iz eiw - 1=0.
This is quadratic inwiw.
Solving for eiw one have ( ) eiw =1z+ 1- z2 12 Taking logarithms of both sides and recalling thatw= Sin- 1 , we have z 42 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II [ ] Sin- 1z= - i In iz- 1- z2 Which is a multiple-valued function with infinitely many values at each z .

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • limit and continuity of functions of complex variables • theorems related to limits and continuity of complex variables • Answer all related questions on limits and continuity.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Limits Definition: Let a function f be defined at all point Z in some neighborhoodZ , except possibly for the point Z itself.
A complex 0 0 ( ) number Lis said to be the limit of f z as Z approaches Z if for 0 each positive number e there is a positive number d such that ( ) f z - L < e whenever 0< Z - Z <d 0 We write lim ( ) f z =L z ﬁ z Example: Show that 46 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II lim ( ) 2x+iy2 = Atl z = x+iy z ﬁ 2i Solution For each positive numbere .
We must find a positive number e such that 2x + iy2 - 4i <e whenever 0< z- 2i <d To do this, we must write 2x+iy2 - 4i £ 2x + y2 - 4 = 2x + y- 2 y+2 and thus note that the first of inequalities will be satisfied if e 2x < and y- 2 y+2 < e 2 2 The first of these inequalities is, of course, satisfied if x <e .
To establish 2 conditions on ysuch that the second holds, we restrict yso that y- 2<e and then observe that ( ) y+2 = y- 2 +4 £ y- 2 + 4 < 5 { }  e  Hence if y- 2 < min e ,1 , if follows that y- 2 y+2 <  5 = e 10 2 10 An appropriate value of d is now easily seen from the conditions that x be less than e 4 and that y- 2 { } be less then min e ,1 10 { } d = min e ,1 10 ( ) Note that the limit of a function f z 47 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II at a point z 0 if it exists is unique.
For suppose that lim ( ) lim ( ) f z = L and f z = L z ﬁ z 0 z ﬁ z 1 0 0 Then for an arbitrary positive number d 0 and d 1 © such that ( ) f z - L < e whenever 0< z- L d 0 0 0 ( ) and f z - L < e whenever 0 < z- L < d 1 1 1 So if 0 < z- z < d where d denotes the smaller of the two numbers 0 d and d , then 0 1 ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ) ( ) ( ) f z - Lo - f z - L £ f z - Lo + f z - L < 2e 1 1 That is L - Lo < 2 e 1 But L - L is a constant, and e can be chosen arbitrarily small.
Hence, 1 0 L - L =0 or L =L 1 0 i 0 Definition: The statement lim ( ) f z = L z ﬁ ¥ 0 Means that for each positive number e there is a positive number d such that ( ) 1 f z - L < e whenever z < 0 d ( ) That is, the point L = f z lies in the e nbd l - L < e of L whenever the 0 0 point zlies in the nbd z > 1 of the point at infinity.
d Example: Observe that 48 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II lim 1 =0 z ﬁ ¥ z2 Since 1 1 - 0 < e whenever z < z2 e Hence d = e When L is the point at infinity and z lies in the finite plane, we write 0 0 lim ( ) f z =¥ z ﬁ z 0 ( ) 1 If for each e there is a corresponding d such that f z > whenever e 0 < z- z < d 0 Example: As expected lim 1 =¥ z ﬁ 0 z2 1 1 for > whenever 0 < z- e < e z2 e 3.2 Theorems on Limits Theorem 1: Suppose that ( ) ( ) f z =U x,y +V x,y , z = x +iy and L =u +iv Then 0 0 0 0 0 0 lim ( ) f z = Lo…………………………………………………..(1 z ﬁ z 0 ) If and only if lim ( ) ( ) ( )u x,y =u and x,y ﬁ x ,y 0 0 0 lim ( ) ( ) ( )v x,y =v …….
(2) x,y ﬁ x ,y 0 0 0 Proof 49 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II Assume (1) is true, by the definition of limit, there is for each positive numbere , ( ) ( ) a positive number d such that u- u +i v- v < e whenever 0 0 ( ) ( ) 0< n- n +i y- y <d 0 0 ( ) ( ) Since u- u £ u- u +i v- v and 0 0 0 ( ) ( ) u- u + i v- v 0 0 ( ) ( ) v- v £ v- v + i v- v 0 0 0 , It follows that u- u < e and v- v < d 0 0 whenever ( ) ( ) 0< n+iy - n =iy <d 0 which is statement (1), hence the proof Theorem 2: Suppose that lim ( ) lim ( ) f z = L and f z = L z ﬁ z 0 z ﬁ z 0 0 0 then lim [ ( ) ( )] f z + f z =l +L z ﬁ z 0 0 0 lim [ ( ) ( )] f z f z =l L z ﬁ z 0 0 0 if L – 0, 0 ( ) lim f z l = 0 ( ) z ﬁ z f z L 0 0 Proof: (Left as exercise) SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.

lim ( ) (1) f z exists z ﬁ z 0 ( ) (2) f z exists 0 lim ( ) ( ) (3) f z = f z z ﬁ z 0 0 Note that statement (3) contains (1) and (2) and it say that for each positive number e there exist a positive number d such that ( ) ( ) f z - f z < e whenever z- z < d 0 0 a function of complex variable is said to be contours in a region Rif it is continuous at each point Example: The function f(z) = xy2 +i(2x- y) is its everywhere in the complex plane because the component functions are ( ) polynomials on x and y and are therefore continuous at each point n,y Example: If 51 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II z2 z „ l ( )   f z =     u z- 1   lim ( ) ( ) lim ( ) ( ) f z= - 1 But f i =0.
Hence, f z „ f i z ﬁ i z ﬁ i Therefore the function is not continuous at z =1 Example: The function ( ) ( ) f z =exy +i Sin n2 - 2ny3 is continuous for all zbecause of the continuity of the polynomials on n and y as well as the continuity of the exponential and sine functions.

n n 3.3 Laurent Series If a function f fails to be analytic at a point z , we cannot apply Taylor’s 0 theorem at that point.
If is often possible, however, to find a series ( ) representation for f z involving both positive and negative powers of z- z .
0 Theorem (Laurent Theorem): Let C and C denote two positively 0 1 oriented circles centred at a pointz , where C is smaller thanC .
If a 0 0 1 function f is analytic at C andC , and throughout the annular 0 1 68 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) domain between them, then at each point zin that domain f z is represented by the expansion.
f(z)=∑¥ a (z- z )n +∑¥ bn ……………………………………….

Since the ( ) ( ) f z f z two integrands and in expressions (2) and (3) are (z- z )nt1 (z- z )- nt1 0 0 analytic throughout the annular domain R z- z < R , and in its boundary, 0 0 1 any simple closed contour C around the domain in the positive direction can be used as a path of integration instead of the circular paths C and C .
Thus the Laurent series (1) can be written as 0 1 f(z)= ∑¥ C (z- z )n (R < z- z < R ) n 0 0 0 1 n= - 0 Where ( ) 1 f z dz C = ∫ n 2(cid:217) i C(z- z )nt1 0 ( ) n =0, – 1, – 2,..............

If n = 1, it is called a simple pole.
( ) lim ( ) If f z has a pole at z = z , then f z =¥ .
0 z ﬁ z 0 ( ) 2.
Removable Singularities: If a single valued function f z is not lim ( ) defined at z = z but f z exist, then z = z is a removable 0 z ﬁ z 0 0 ( ) singularities.
In such case, we define f z at z = z as equal to 0 lim ( ) f z .

( ) 3.
Essential Singularities: If f z is single valued, then any singularity which is not a pole or removable singularity is called an essential ( ) singularity.
If z = a uan essential singularity of f z , the principal part of the Laurent expansion has infinitely many terms 1 1 1 Example: Since e1z =1+ + + z3 z 2!z2 3!
z =0is an essential singularity.
4.
Branch Points: A point z = z is called a branch point of the 0 ( ) ( ) multiple-valued function f z if the branches of f z are interchanged when Z describes a closed path aboutz .
Since each of the branches of a 0 multiple-valued function is analytic, all the theorems for analytic functions, in particular Taylor’s theorem apply.
( ) Example: The branch of f z = z12which has the value 1 forz =1, has a Taylor series of the form ( ) ( ) a +a 2- 1 +a z- 1 2 +......With radius of convergence R =1[the 0 1 2 distance from Z=1 to the nearest singularity, namely the branch point z=0].
( ) 5.
Singularities at Infinity: By letting z = 1 in f z we obtain the w ( ) ( ) function f 1 = f w .
Then the nature of the singularity at z =¥ [the point w ( ) at infinity] is defined to be the same as that of f w atw=0.
( ) Example: If f z = z3has a pole of order 3 atz =¥ , since ( ) ( ) f w = f 1 = 1 has a pole of order 3 atw= 0. w w3 ( ) Similarly, f z =ezhas an essential singularity atz =¥ , since ( ) ( ) f w = f 1 =e1whas an essential singularity atw= 0. w 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit is a very important unit which must be studied properly and understood before proceeding to other units.

79 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Derivatives Definition: Let F be a …..whose domain of definition contains a nbd of a ( ) point Z .
The derivative of f at Z , written as f1 Z , is defined as 0 0 0 ( ) ( ) ( ) lim f z - f z f1 z = 0 ..(3.1.1) 0 z ﬁ z z- z 0 0 Provided this limit exists.
The function f is said to be differentiable at z 0 when its derivative at z exists.
0 Note that (3.1.1) is equivalent to ( ) ( ) ( ) lim f z+ D z - f z f1 z = 0 0 … (3.1.2) 0 D z ﬁ 0 D z Where D z = z- z 0 Which is also the same as dw lim D w = dz D z ﬁ 0 D z ( ) dw ( ) ( ) Where f1 z = , D w= f z+ D z - f z write z- z dz 0 0 0 Example: Suppose that ( ) f z = z2 At any point z ( ) lim D w lim z+ D z 2 - z2 lim ( ) = = 2z+ D z = 2z D z ﬁ 0 D z D z ﬁ 0 D z D z ﬁ 0 dw ( ) Hence, = 2z or f1 z = 2z dz ( ) Example: For the function f z = z 2 ( ) D w z+ D z 2 - z 2 (z+ D z)z+ D z - zz = = D z D z D z D z = + D z+ z D z 80 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II D w dw lim When z =0, this reduces to = D z.
Hence = = 0. at the origin D z dz D z ﬁ 0 dw =0 dz If the limit of D w exists whenz „ 0, this limit may be found by letting the D z variable D z = D x+1D yapproach 0 in any manner.
In particular, when D zapproaches 0through the real valuesD z = D z+i0, we may writeD Z = D Z .
Hence if the limit of D w exists, its value must bez+ z.
D z However, when D Z approaches 0 through the pure imaginary Value, so thatD Z = - D Z , the limit if found to beZ - Z.
Since a limit is unique, it follows thatZ +Z = Z - Z, orZ =0, if dw exists.
But Z „ 0,and we may dz conclude from this contradiction that dw/dzexists only at the origin.
From example above, it follows that: (1) A function can be differentiable at a certain point but nowhere else in any nbd of that point.
( ) ( ) (2) Since the real and imaging parts of f z = z 2 are m n,y = n2 + y2 ( ) andv n,y =0.
Respectively, it also shows that the real and imaginary components of a function of a complex variable can have continuous partial derivatives of all orders at a point and yet the function many not even be differentiable there.
( ) (3) The function f z = z 2is its at each point in the plane since its components functions are continuous at each point.
So the continuity of a function at a point does not imply the existence of a derivative there.
It is, however, true that the existence of the derivative of a function at a point implies the continuity of the function at that point.
3.2 Differentiation Formulae Definition: Let F be a …..whose domain of definition contains a nbd of a ( ) point Z .
The derivative of f at Z , written as f1 Z , is defined as 0 0 0 ( ) ( ) ( ) lim f z - f z f1 z = 0 ………………………………………..(3.1.1) 0 z ﬁ z z- z 0 0 81 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II Provided this limit exists.
The function f is said to be differentiable at z 0 when its derivative at z exists.

Hence = = 0. at the origin D z dz D z ﬁ 0 dw =0 dz If the limit of D w exists whenz „ 0, this limit may be found by letting the D z variable D z = D x+1D yapproach 0 in any manner.
In particular, when D Z approaches 0 through the real valuesD Z = D n+i0, we may writeD Z = D Z .
Hence if the limit of D w exists, its value must beZ +Z .
D z However, when D Z approaches 0 through the pure imaginary value D Z =0+iD y, so that D Z = - D Z , the limit if found to be Z - Z.
Since a limit 82 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II is unique, it follows thatZ +Z = Z - Z , or Z =0, if dw exists.
But dz Z „ 0,and we may conclude from this contradiction that dw/dzexists only at the origin.
From example above, it follows that: (1) A function can be differentiable at a certain point but nowhere else in any nbd of that point.
( ) ( ) (2) Since the real and imaging parts of f z = z 2 are u x,y = x2 + y2 ( ) and v x,y =0.
Respectively, it also shows that the real and imaginary components of a function of a complex variable can have continuous partial derivatives of all orders at a point and yet the function many not even be differentiable there.
( ) (3) The function f z = z 2is its at each point in the plane since its components functions are continuous at each point.
So the continuity of a function at a point does not imply the existence of a derivative there.

3.3 Cauchy-Riemann Equations Suppose that ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) f z =u x.y +iv x,y and that f1 z exists at a point z = x +iy .
Then 0 0 0 0 the first order partial derivatives of u and v wrt n and y must exist at (u ,y ), and they must satisfy.
0 0 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) U x y =Vy x ,y and Uy x ,y = - V x ,y at that point.
… (1) x 0 0 0 0 0 0 x 0 0 ( ) Also f i z is given in terms of the partial derivatives by either 0 ( ) ( ) ( ) f1 z =U x ,y +iv x y 0 x 0 0 0 0 ( ) ( ) ( ) or f1 z =Vy x ,y - Uy x ,y 0 0 0 0 0 Equation (1)… is referred to as Cauchy Riemann equation.
( ) Example: the derivative of the function f z = z2exists everywhere.
83 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II To verify that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied everywhere, we note that ( ) f z = z2 = x2 - y2 +i2xy so that ( ) ( ) U x,y = x2 - y2 and V xiy = 2x x ( ) ( ) U x,y = 2x, V xiy = 2y x x ( ) ( ) Uy x,y = 2y Vy x,y = 2x So that ( ) ( ) U n,y =Vy n,y = 2x n ( ) ( ) Uy x,y= - V x,y= - 2y n Also ( ) ( ) ( ) f1 z =U x ,y +iV x,y = 2x+i2y = 2z 0 0 3.4 Sufficient Conditions ( ) Satisfaction of the Cauchy – Riemann equations at a point z = x ,y is 0 0 0 ( ) not sufficient to ensure the existence of the derivative of a function f z at that point.
The following theorem gives sufficient conditions.
Theorem: (Sufficiency Theorem) : ( ) ( ) ( ) Let the function f z =u x,y +iv x,y be defined throughout some e - nbd of a point z = x - iy suppose that the first-order partial derivatives of the 0 0 0 functions U and V with respect to n and y exist everywhere in that nbd they ( ) are continuous at x ,y .
Then if these partial derivatives satisfy the 0 0 Cauchy-Riemann equations.
U =V ,and,U = - Vx x y y ( ) At(x ,y ), the derivative f1 z exists.
0 0 0 Proof: We shall leave the proof as exercise.
Example: suppose that ( ) f z =ex 9Cos y + i Sin y) Where y is to be taken in radius when Cos y and Sin y are evaluated then U(x,y) =exCosy and V(x,y)=exSiny 84 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II Since U =V and Uy = - Vx everywhere and since those derivatives are x y everywhere continuous, the conditions in the theorem are satisfied at all ( ) points in the complex plane.
Thus, f1 z exists everywhere and f ¢(z)=U (x,y) =iV (x,y) =ex(cosx+isin y) x x ( ) ( ) Note that f1 z = f z Example: for the function ( ) f z = z 2=U(x,y) = x2 + y2 and V(x,y) =0 So that U (x,y) = 2x and x ( ) V (x,y) =0while U x,y = xy andV (x,y) =0.
Since U (x,y) „ V (x,y) y y x x y unless x = y =0Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satisfied unless x = y =0the derivative f¢(z) cannot exist if z „ 0and besides, the existence of f ¢(0) is not guaranteed unless conditions of theorem (3-4-1) are satisfied.
If follows from the theorem (3.4.1) that the further ( ) f(z) = z 2 =(x2 + y2)+10 has derivative at z =0; in fact, f' 0 =0+0=0.
3.5 Polar Form Cauchy-Riemann equations can be written in polar form.
For z = n+iy or z = r(Cosq +iSinq ), we have n = rcosq , y = rsinq , r = n2 + y2.

(6) q q  r   r  Multiplying (5) by cos q , (6) by Sinq and adding given 1 (Ur= - U ) …………………………………………………………..(7) q r Also, multiplying (5) by - sinq , (6) by Cosq and adding given 1 Vr= - Uq ……………………………………………………………..(8) r Equations (7) and (8) are the Cauchy-Riemann equations in polar form.
Theorem: Let the function ( ) ( ) ( ) f z =U r,q +i v r,q Be defined throughout some e neighborhood of a no zero point ( ) ( ) f z = r Cosq +iSinq .
0 0 0 Suppose that the first order partial derivatives of the functions U and V wrt r and q exist everywhere on that neighborhood and that they are continuous ( ) at r ,q .
Then if those partial derivatives satisfy polar forms (7) and (8) of 0 0 ( ) ( ) the Cauchy-Riemann equations at r ,q , the derivatives f1 z exists.
0 0 0 ( ) The derivative f1 z is given as 0 ( ) [ ( ) ( )] f1 z =e- 1q Ur r ,q +iVr z ,q 0 0 0 0 0 Example: Consider the function ( ) 1 1 f z = = , r req 86 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) Cosq ( ) - Sinq U r,q = and V r,q = and the condition of the theorem are r r satisfied at any nonzero point z = reiq in the plane.
Hence the derivative of f exists there: and according to (9) ( )  Cosq Sinq  1 1 f1 z =e- 1q - +i = - ( )= -  r2 r2  reiq 2 z2 3.6 Analytic Functions Definition: A function f of the complex variables zis analytic at a point z if its derivative exists not only at z but also at each point zin some 0 0 neighborhood ofz .
A function f is said to be analytic in a region Rif it is 0 analytic at each point in´ .
The term halomorphic is also used in literature to denote analyticity.
( ) ( ) If f z = z2, then f is analytic everywhere.
But the function f z = z is not analytic at any point since its derivative exists why at z =0 and not throughout any nbd.
An entire function is a function that is analytic at each point in the entire plane.
E.g.
polynomial functions.
If a function f fails to be analytic at a pointz , buy is analytic at some 0 point in every nbd ofz , then z is called a singular point or singularity of 0 0 ( ) ( ) f .
For example, the function f z = 1 , where derivative is f z= - 1 is z z2 analytic at every point except z =0hence it is not even defined.
Therefore the point z =0is a singular point.
If two functions are analytic in domain D, their sum and their product are both analytic in D. similarly, their quotient is analytic in D provided the function in the denominator does not vanish at any point in D. 3.7 Harmonic Functions A real-valued function hof two real variables xand yis said to be harmonic in a given domain in the xy plane if throughout that domain it has continuous partial derivatives of first and second order and satisfies the partial differential equation.
87 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) ( ) h x,y +h x,y =0………………………………………………(3.7.1) xx yy Known as Laplace’s equation If a function ( ) ( ) ( ) f z =u x,y +iv x,y ……………………………………………...(3.7.2) Is analytic in a domain D, then its component functions U and V are harmonic in D. to show this, Since f is analytic in D, the first order partial derivatives of its component functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations throughout D. Ux =Vy, Uy = - Vx…………………………………………….……..(3.7.3) Differentiating both sides of these equating with respect to x, we have Uxy =Vyy Uyy = - Vxy…………………………………………… (3.7.4) The continuity of the partial derivatives ensures that Uyx =Uxy and Vyx =Vxy.
It then follows from (3.7.4) and (3.7.5) that ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) Uxx n,y +Uyy x,y =0 and Vxx x,y +Vyy x,y =0.
( ) ( ) ( ) Thus, if a function f z =U x,y +iV x,y is analytic in a domain D, its component functions U and V are harmonic in D. 3.8 Solved Problems 1.
Verify that the real and imaginary parts of the function ( ) f z = z2 +5iz+3=i satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equation and deduce the analyticity of the function.
Solution ( ) f z = z2 +5iz+3- 1 ( ) ( ) = x+iy 2 +5i x+iy +3=1 ( ) = x2 - y2 - 5y+3+i 2xy+5x- 1 So that ( ) ( ) U x,y = x2 - y2 - 5y+3, V x,y = 2xy+5x- 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) Ux x,y = 2x, Uy x,y= - 2y- 5= - 2y+5 ( ) ( ) Vx x,y = 2y+5 Vy x,y = 2x ( ) ( ) And since Ux x,y =Vy x,y = 2x ( ) ( ) And Uy x,y= - Vx= - 2y+5 88 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II The function satisfies Cauchy Riemann equation.
Also, since the partial derivatives are polynomial functions which are continuous, then the function is analytic.

The function is harmonic if Uxx+Uyy =0 ( ) Ux = 21- y , Uxx =0 Uy = - 2x Uyy =0 Uxx+Uyy =0+0=0.
Hence the function is harmonic (b) By Cauchy-Riemann equation ( ) Example 2: show that the function U x,y = y3 - 3x2y is harmonic and find its harmonic conjugate.
Solution ( ) U x,y = y3 - 3x2y Ux = - 6xy, Uxx = - 6y Uy =3y2 - 3x2 Uyy =6y And since Uxx+Uyy = - 6y+6y =0 The function ( ) U x,y = y33x2y is harmonic To find the harmonic conjugate, From ( ) Ux x,y= - 6xy, since Ux =Vy, ( ) Vy x,y= - 6xy Find x, and integrate both sides with respect to y, ( ) ( ) V x,y= - 3xy2 +f x ( ) ( ) And since Uy = - Vx must hold, it follows from x and xr that 89 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) 3y2 - 3x2 =3y2 +f 1 x So that ( ) ( ) f 1 x =3x2and f x =6x+C ( ) V x,y= - 3xy2 +6x+C.

2 1 3.1 Residues and Residues Theorems Recall that a point z is called a singular point of the function f if f fails 0 to be analytic at z but is analytic at some point in every neighborhood of 0 z .
A singular point z is said to be isolated if in addition, there is some 0 0 nbd of z throughout which f is analytic except at the point itself.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Curves ( ) ( ) If f t and y t are real functions of the real variable t assumed continuous in t £ t£ t , the parametric equations 1 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) Z = x+iy =f t +iy t = Z t t £ t £ t 1 2 101 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) Define a continuous curve or arc in the Z-plane joining points a = Z t and 1 ( ) b = Z t as shown below 2 y b a O x ( ) ( ) If t mt whileZ t = Z t , i.e.
a =b, the end point is coincide and the 1 2 1 2 curve is said to be closed.
A close curve which does not intersect itself anywhere is called a simple closed curve.
( ) ( ) If f t and y t have its derivations in t £ t £ t , the curve is often called a 1 2 smooth curve or arc.
A curve which is composed of a finite number of smooth arcs is called a piecewise or sectionally smooth curve or sometimes a contour.
For example, the boundary of a square of a piecewise smooth curve or contour.
3.2 Simply and Multiply Connected Regions A region R is called simply connected if any simple closed curve which lies in R can be shrunk to a point without leaving R. A region R which is not simply connected is called multiply-connected e.g.
z <2.
< z <2.

3.4 Cauchy-Goursat Theorem ( ) ( ) Suppose that two real-valued function P n,y and Q n,y together with their partial derivatives of the first order, are continuous throughout a closed region Rconsisting of points interior to and on a simple closed contour C in the nyplane.
By Green’s theorem, for line integrals, ( ) ∫Pdn+Qdy = ∫∫ f - P dndy.
x y c R Consider a function ( ) ( ) ( ) f z =u x,y +i v x,y Which is analytic throughout such a region Rin the ny, or Z , plane, the line integral of f along Ccan be written ( ) ∫ f z dz = ∫ndn- vdy+i ∫vdx+udy…………………………………(1) c c c Since f is its inR, the functions uand v are also its theorem i and if the derivative f1 of f is its in R, so are the first order partial derivatives of u and v.

Goursat proved that the condition of continuity of f1in the above Cauchy theorem can be omitted.
Theorem: (Cauchy-Goursat theorem) If a function f is analytic at all points interior to and in a simple closed contour C, then 107 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II ( ) ∫ f z dz =0.

Theorem: Let Cbe a simple closed contour and let Cj (j =1,2,....n)be a finite number of simple closed contours inside Csuch that the regions interior to each Cj have no points in common.
Let Rbe the closed region consisting of all points within and on Cexcept for points interior to each Cj.
Let Band all the contours oriented boundary of Rconsisting of C and all the contoursCj, described in a direction such that the interior points of Rlie to the left ofB.

1 ( ) ∫ f z dz =0 B y C C 2 C 1 x As a consequence of Cauchy’s theorem, we have the following Theorem: If f(z) is analytic in a simply-connected region R,then ∫b f(z)dz a is independent of the path in Rjoining any two points a and b in R. 108 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II Proof Consider the figure below y C B 1 A D b a E C 2 x By Cauchy’s theorem ( ) ∫ f z dz =0 ADBCA ( ) ( ) Or ∫ f z dz+ ∫ f z dz = 0 ADB BEA Hence ( ) ( ) ( ) ∫ f z dz = - ∫ f z dz = ∫ f z dz ADB BEA AEB Thus ∫ f(z)dz = ∫ f(z)dz = ∫b f(z)dz C C a 1 2 This yields the required result.
Example: If Cis the curve y=x3 - 3x2 +4x- 1joining the points (1, 1) and (2, 3), show that ( ) ∫ 12z2 - 4izdz is independent of the path joining (1, 1) and (2, 3) c Solution: A (1, 1) ﬁ B (2, 1) ﬁ C (2, 3) Along A (1, 1) to B (2, 1), y = 1, dy = 0.
So that z = x4i anddz=dx.

Then 3{ } ( ) ( ) ∫ 12 2+iy 2 - 4i 2+iy idy= - 176+8i y=1 y =1 So that ∫(12z2 - 41z)dz = 20+30i- 176+8i= - 156+38i c The given integral equals ( ) ( ) ∫2+3i 12z2 - 4iz dz = 4z3 - 2iz2 ∫2+3i = - 156+38i 1+i 1+i Morera’s Theorem ( ) Let f z be continuous in a simply connected region Rand suppose that ( ) ∫ f1 z dz =0 c ( ) Around every simple closed curve C in R. Then f z is analytic in R. This theorem is called the converse of Cauchy’s theorem and it can be extended to multiply-connected regions.
Indefinite Integrals (Anti-derivatives) ( ) Let f z be a function which is continuous throughout a domainD, and ( ) ( ) suppose that there is an analytic function F such that F1 z = f z at each point inD.
The function F is said to be an anti derivative of f in the domainD.
Cauchy Integral Formula Theorem: Let f be analytic everywhere within and in a simple closed contour Ctaken in the positive sense.
If Z is any point interior to C, then 0 ( ) ( ) 1 f z dz f z = ∫ 0 2p i cZ - z 0 This formula is called the Cauchy integral formula.
It says that that if a function f is to be analytic within and on a simple closed contourC, then the values of f interior to Care completely determined by the values of f in C. 110 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II When the Cauchy integral formula is written as ( ) f a dz ( ) ∫ = 2p i f z ……………………………………………..(4) cZ - z 0 0 It can be used to evaluate certain integrals along.
Simple closed contours Example: Let C be the positively oriented circle z = since the function ( ) ( ) f z =2 / 9- z2 is analytic within and in Cand the point Z= - iis interior 0 to C, then by Cauchy Integral formula ( ) zdz z/ 9- z2 - i p ∫( )( ) = ∫ ( ) = 2pc = c 9- z2 z+i c z- - i 10 d Proof Since f is its at Z , there corresponds to any positive number e , however 0 small, a positive number d such that ( ) ( ) f z - f z <e whenever z- z = r …………………………………(1) 0 0 ( ) Observe that the function f z is analytic at all points within and in (z- z ) 0 Cexcept at the pointz .
Hence, by Cauchy-Goursat theorem for multiply 0 connected domain, it’s integral around the oriented boundary of the region between Cand C has value zero.
0 ( ) ( ) f z dz f z dz ∫ - ∫ =0 cZ - z C Z - z 0 0 0 y e e p c z 0 1 That is ( ) ( ) f z dz f z dz ∫ = ∫ cZ - Z C Z - Z 0 0 0 111 MTH 305 COMPLEX ANALYSIS II This allows us to write ( ) ( ) ( ) f z dz ( ) dz f z - f z ∫ - f z ∫ = ∫ 0 dz…………………………(2) C Z - Z 0 C Z - Z C Z - Z 0 0 0 0 0 dz ∫ = 2pi C Z - Z 0 0 And so equation (Z) becomes ( ) ( ) ( ) f z dz ( ) f z - f z ∫ - 2pi f z = ∫ 0 dz……………………………….
(3) C Z - Z 0 C Z - Z 0 0 0 By (1) and noting that the length of C is 2(cid:217) r , by properties of integrals 0 ( ) ( ) f z - f z e ∫ 0 dz < p2 r = 2ep C Z - Z r 0 0 In view of (3) then ( ) f z dz ( ) ∫ - 2pi f z < 2p e .
C Z - Z 0 0 Since the left hand side of this inequality is a non negative constant which is less than an arbitrary small positive number, it must be equal to zero.
Hence, equation for it valid and the theorem is proved.
