The course elaborated on a class of subgroups which have some characteristics to make us call them normal subgroups.
We also consider the concept of some algebraically indistinguishable systems.
We say such systems are isomorphic.
The word isomorphism was first used in 1870 by the mathematician Camille Jordan, to describe two groups that are not equal but have the same algebraic behaviour.
Isomorphisms are special cases of homomorphism, which are functions between groups that preserve the algebraic structure of their domains.
All concepts will also be learnt in module 2 of this course which is on Rings Theory.
Our exposition of ring theory will follow the path we used for group theory.
We shall define ring and sub-rings and give different types of rings and sub-rings.
We shall also deal with ring homomorphism and isomorphisms.
What you will learn in this course This course consists of two modules.
Module 1 is divided into fours units and Module 2 is divided into three units.
During this course you will learn about sub-groups and normal sub- groups, quotient groups, Isomorphism, rings subrings and Ideals, and Ring Homomorphism.
This course is a core course in pure mathematics and as such it is recommended as part of the course a career in mathematics.

We start this unit by discussing a special class of subgroups, called normal subgroups.
You will see that the sets of such a subgroup form a group with respect to a suitably defined operation.
These groups are called quotient groups we will discuss them in some detail in sec.
3.2.
Once you are comfortable with normal subgroups and quotient groups, you will find it easier to understand the concepts and results that are presented in the next unit.
So make sure that you have met the following objectives before going to the next unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit, you should be able to • Verity whether a subgroup is normal or not, • Obtain a quotient group corresponding to a given normal subgroup.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 1MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3.1 Normal Subgroups When we treated Lagrange’s theorem in MTH 211 you saw that a left coset of a subgroup H, aH, need not be same as the right coset Ha.
But, there are certain subgroups for which the right and left cosets represented by the same element coincide.
This type of subgroup is very important in group theory, and we give it a special name.
Definition: A subgroup N of a group G is called a normal subgroup of G if Nx = xN" x ˛ G, and we write this as ND G. - For example, any group G has two normal subgroups, namely, {e} and G itself.
Can you see why?
Well, {e}x ={x}=x{e} for any x ˛ G, and Gx = G = xG, for any x ˛ G. Let us consider another example.
Example 1: Show that every subgroup of Z is normal in Z.
Solution: from Example 4 of unit 3, of MTH 211, you know that if H is a subgroup of Z, then H = mZ, for some m ˛ Z.
Now, for any z ˛ Z, H + z = {…, - 3m + z, - 2m + z, - m + z, z, m + z, 2m + z,…} = {…, - 3m, z – 2m, z – m, z, z, + m, z + 2m …} (since + is commutative) = z + H. \ HD Z.
- Example 1 is a special case of the fact that every subgroup of a commutative group is a normal subgroup.
We will prove this fact later (in Theorem 2).
Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 Show that A D S (see Example 3 of unit 4in MTH 211).
3 3 - Let us now prove a result that gives equivalent conditions for subgroups to be normal Theorem 1: Let H be a subgroup of a group G: The following statement are equivalent a) H is normal in G b) g-1Hg ˝ H" g˛ G. 2 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS c) g-1Hg = H" g˛ G. Proof: We will show that (a) ⇒ (b) ⇒ (c) ⇒ (a).
This will show that the three statements are equivalent.
(a) ⇒ (b) : Since (a) is true, Hg = gH " g ˛ G. We want to prove (b).
for this, consider g-1Hg for g ˛ G. Let g-1Hg.
Since hg ˛ Hg = gH,$ h ˛ H such that hg = gh .
1 1 \ g-1hg = g-1gh = h ˛ H. 1 1 \ (b) holds.
(b) ⇒(c): Now, we know that (b) holds, i.e., for g ˛ G, g-1Hg ˝ H. We want to show that H ˝ g-1Hg.
Let h˛ H. Then.
H = chc = (g-1g) h (g-1g) = g-1 (ghg-1)g = g-1 {(g-1) -1hg-1} g˛ g-1Hg, since (g-1)g-1hg-1 ˛ (g-1)-1 H(g-1) ˝ H \ H ˝ g-1 Hg.
\ g-1 Hg = H " g ˛ G (c) ⇒(a): for any g ˛ G, we know that g-1Hg = H. \ g(g-1Hg) = gH, that is, Hg = gH \ H D G, that is, )a) holds.
We should like to make the following remark about Theorem 1 Remark: Theorem 1 says that HD G (cid:219) g-1Hg = H " g˛ G. This does not mean that g-1hg = h" h ˛ H and g ˛ G. For example, in E1 you have shown that A D S .
Therefore, by theorem 3 3 1, (1 2)-1A (1 2) -1(1 3 2) (1 2) „ (1 3 2).
In fact, it is (1 2 3).
3 Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Consider the subgroup SL (R) = {A˛ GL (R) | det (A) = 1} of GL (R) 2 2 2 (see Example 5 of unit 2ofMTH211).
Using the facts that 1 det (AB) = det (A)-1) = det(A), prove that AL (R) D GL (R).
2 2 3MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS We now prove a simple result that we stated after Example 1. it is actually a corollary to Theorem 1.
Theorem 2: Every subgroup of a commutative group is normal.
Prove: Let G be an abelian group, and H £ G. For any g˛ G and h˛ H, g-1hg = (g-1g)h = h ˛ H.\ g-1Hg ˝ H. Thus, H D G. Theorem 2 says G be an abelian, then all its subgroup are normal.
Unfortunately, the converse of this is not true.
That is, there are non commutative group where subgroups are all normal.
We will give you an example after doing Theorem 3. let us first look at another example of a normal subgroup.
Example 2: consider the Klein 4-group, K , given in Example 7 of unit 4 3.of MTH 211, Show that both its subgroups < a > and < b > are normal.
Solution: Consider the table of the operation given in Example 7 of Unit 3.of MTH 211, Note that a and b are of order 2.
Therefore, a = a-1 and b = b-1.
Also note that ba = ab.
Now, let H = < a > = {e, a}.
We will check that H D K , that is, g-1hg 4 ˛ H " g ˛ K and h ˛ H. 4 Now, g-1eg = e ˛ H" g ˛ K .
4 Further, e-1ae = a ˛ H, a-1aa = a ˛ H, b-1ab = bab = a ˛ H and (ab)-1a(ab) = b-1 )a-1aa)b = bab = a ˛ H. \ HD K .
4 By a similar proof we can show that < b > D K .
4 In Example 2, both < a > and < b > are of index 2 in K .
we have the 4 following result about such subgroups.
Theorem 3: Every subgroup of a group G of index 2 is normal in G. Proof: Let N £ G such that |G: N| = 2.
Let the two right cosets of N be N and Nx, and the two left cosets be N and yN.
Now, G = N UyN, and x ˛ G. \ x ˛ N or x ˛ yN.
Since NINx = ø, xˇ N.\ xN = yN.
To show that ND G, we need to show that Nx = xN.
Now, for any n ˛ N, nx ˛ G = N U xN.
Therefore, nx ˛ N or nx ˛ xN.
But nx ˇ N, since x ˇ N. \ nx ˛ xN.
4 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Thus, Nx ˝ xN.
By a similar argument we can show that xN ˝ Nx.
\ Nx = xN, and ND G. We will use this theorem in Unit 7 to show that, for any n ‡ 2, the alternating group A is a normal subgroup of S .
n n In fact, if you go back to the end of sec.
4.3in MTH 211, you can see that A D S , since Lagrange’s theorem implies that 4 4 o(S ) 4!
|S :A | = 4 = = 2.
4 4 o(A ) 12 4 Now let us look at an example to show that the converse of Theorem 2is not true.
Consider the quaternion group Q , which we discussed in Example 4 of 8 unit 4of MTH211,.
It has the following 6 subgroups: H = {1}, H = {1, 0 1 - 1}, H = {1, - 1,A, - A}H , = {1, - 1,B, -B}, 2 3 H = {1, - 1, C, - C}, H = Q .
4 5 8 You know that H and H are normal in Q .
Using theorem 3, you can 0 5 8 see that H , H and H are normal in Q .
2 3 4 8 By actual multiplication you can see that g-1H g ˝ H " g ˛ Q \ H D Q .
1 1 8 1 8 Therefore, all the subgroups of Q are normal.
8 But you know that Q is non-abelian (for instance, AB = - BA).
8 So far we have given examples of normal subgroups.
Let us look at an example of a subgroup that isn’t normal.
Example 3: show that the subgroup < (1 2) > of S is not normal.
3 Solution: we have to find g ˛ S such that g (1 2)g ˇ < (1 2) >.
3 -1 Let us try g = (1 2 3).
Then, g-1(1 2)g = (3 2 1) (1 2) (1 2 3) = (3 2 1) (2 3) = (1 3) ˇ < (1 2) > Therefore, < (1 2)> is not normal in s .
3 5MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 Consider the group of all 2 x 2 diagonal matrices over R*, with respect to multiplication.
How many of its subgroups are normal?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 Show that Z(G), the center of G, is normal in G. (Remember that Z(G) = {x ˛ G| xg = gx" g ˛ G}.)
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Show that < (2 3)> is not normal in S .
3 In Unit 3of MTH211, we prove that if H £ G and K £ H, then K £ G. That is, ‘£ ’ is a transitive relation.
But ‘D ’ is not a transitive relation.
That is, if HD N and ND G, it is not necessary that HD G. We’ll give you an example in Unit3 of this course..
But, corresponding to the property of subgroups given in Theorem 4 of unit 3, we have the following result, Theorem 4: let H and K be normal subgroups of a group G. Then H ˙ KD G. Proof: From Theorem 4 of unit 3, you know that H ˙ K £ G. We have to show that g-1 zg ˛ H ˙ K " x ˛ H ˙ K and g ˛ G. Now, let x ˛ H ˙ K and g ˛ G. then x ˛ H and HD G. \ g-1 xg ˛ H. Similarly, g-1xg ˛ K. \ g-1xg ˛ H ˙ K. Thus, H ˙ K D G. In the following exercise we ask you to prove an important property of normal subgroups.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 i.
Prove that if HD G and K £ G, then HK £ G. (Hint: Use Theorem 5 unit 3.)
ii.
prove that if H D G, K D G then HKD G. Now consider an important group, which is the product of two subgroups, of which only one normal.
6 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 7 Let G be the group generated by {x, y| x2 = e, y4 = e, xy = y-1x}.
Let H = < x > and K = < y >.
Then show that K D G, H D/ G and G = HK.
Solution: Not that the elements of G are of the form xiyj, where i = 0, I and j = 0, 1, 2, 3.
\ G = {e, x, xy, xy2, xy3, y, y2, y3}.
\ |G:K| = 2.
Thus, by Theorem 3, KD G Note that we can’t apply Theorem 2, since G is non-abelian (as xy = y-1 and y „ y-1).
Now let us see if HD G. Consider y-1xy.
Now y-1xy = xy2, because y-1x = xy.
If xy2 ˛ H, then xy2 = e or xy2 = x.
(Remember o(x) = 2, so that x-1 = x.)
Now, xy2 = e ⇒ y2 = x-1 = x ⇒ y3 = xy = y-1x ⇒ y4 = x ⇒ e = x, a contradiction.
Again xy2 = x ⇒ y2 = e, a contradiction.
\ y-1xy = xy2 ˇ H, and hence, HD/ G. Finally, from the definition of G you see that G = HK.
The group G is of order 8 and is called the dihedral group, D .
It is the 8 group of symmetries of a square, that is, its elements represent the different ways in which two copies of a square can be placed so that one covers the other.
A geometric interpretation of its generators is the following (see Fig.
1): Take y to be a rotation of the Euclidean plane about the origin through p , and x the reflection about the vertical axis.
2 y y y 2 3 1 2 2 1 y y O x O x O x 1 4 4 3 3 4 Fig.
1: Geometric representation of the generators of D .
8 7MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS We can generalize D to the dihedral group 8 D = < {x, y|x2 = e, yn = e, xy = y-1x}>, for n > 2.
2n Try the following exercise now.
E7) Describe D and give its geometric interpretation.
6 Let us now utilize normal subgroups to form new algebraic structures.
3.2 Quotient Groups In this section we will use a property of normal subgroups to create a new group.
This group is analogous to the concept of quotient spaces given in the Linear Algebra course.
Let H be a normal subgroup of a group G. Then gH = Hg for every g ˛ G. Consider the collection of all cosets of H in G. (Note that since H D G, we need not write ‘left coset’ or ‘right coset; simply ‘coset’ is enough.)
We denote this set by G/H.
Now, for x, y˛ H, we have (Hx) (Hy) = H(xH)y, using associativity, = Hhxy, using normality of H, = Hxy, since HH = H because H is a subgroup.
Now, we define the product of two cosets Hx and Hy and G/H by (Hx) (Hy) = Hxy for all x, y in G. Our definition seems to depend on the way in which we represent a coset.
Let us explain this.
Suppose C and C are two cosets, say C = 1 2 1 hx and C = Hy.
Then C C = Hxy.
But C and C can be written in the 2 1 2 1 2 form Hx and Hy in several ways so, you may think: Does C C depends 1 2 on the particular way of writing C and C ?
1 2 In other words if C = Hx = Hx and C = Hy = Hy , then is C C = Hxy 1 1 2 1 1 2 or is C C = Hx y?
Actually, we will show you that Hxy = Hx y , that is, 1 2 1 1 the product of cosets is well defined.
Since Hx = Hx and Hy = hy , xx -1 ˛ H, yy -1 ˛ H 1 1 1 1 \ (xy) (x y ) –1 = (xy) (y -1x -1)= x (yy -1) x -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 =x(yy -1x -1) x -1 (xx -1) ˛ H, since xx ˛ H and HD G. 1 1 1 1 1 i.e., (xy) (x y )-1 ˛ H. 1 1 \ Hxy = Hx y .
1 1 We will now show that (G/H,.)
is a group.
8 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Theorem 5: Let H be a normal subgroup of a group G and G/H denote the set of all cosets of H in G. Then G/H becomes a group under multiplication defined by Hx.Hy = Hxy,x,y˛ G. The coset H = He is the identity of G/H and the inverse of Hx is the coset Hx-1.
Proof: We have already observed that the product of two cosets is a coset.
This multiplication is also associative, since ((Hx) (Hy)) (Hz) = (Hxy) (Hz) = Hxyz, as the product in G is associative, = Hx (yz) = (hx) (hyz) = (Hx) ((Hy) (Hz)) for x, y, z ˛ G. Now, if e is the identity of g, then Hx, He = Hxe = Hx and He Hx = Hex Hx for every x ˛ G. Thus, He = H is the identity element of G/H.
Also, for any x ˛ G, Hx hx-1.
So, we have prove that G/H, the set of all cosets of a normal subgroup H in G forms a group with respect to the multiplication defined by Hx.Hy = hxy.
This group is called the quotient group (or factor group) of g by H. Note that the order of the quotient group G/H is the index of H in G. thus, by Lagrange’s theorem you know that if g is a finite group, then o(G) o(G/H) = o(H) Also note that if (G, +) is an abelian group and H £ G, then HD G. Further, the operation on G/H is defined by (H + x) + (H + y) = H + (x + y).
Let us look at a few examples of quotient groups.
Example 5: Obtain the group G/H, where G = S and H = A = {1, (1 2 3 3 3), (1 3 2)} Solution: Firstly, note that A D S , since |S :A | = 2.
3 3 3 3 From example 3 of unit 4 you that g/H is a group of order 2 whose elements are H and (1 2) H. 9MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Example 6: Show that the group Z/nZ is of order n. Solution: The elements of Z/nZ are of the form a + nZ = {a +kn|k ˛ Z}.
Thus, the elements of Z/nZ are precisely the congruence classes nodulo n, that is, the elements of Zn (see Sec.
E.5.1).
- - - Thus, Z/nZ = {0,1,2,…n- 1}.
\ o(Z/nZ) = n. Note that addition in Z/nZ is given by a + b = a+b.
Try these simple exercises now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 For any group G, determine the quotient groups corresponding to {e} and G. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Show that the quotient group of a cyclic group is cyclic.
(Hint: if G = < x>, then show that G/H = < Hx.> Now, do G and G/H always have the same algebraic properties?
On solving the following exercise you will see that if G is abelian, then so is G/H; but the converse need not be true.
That is, G may not so.
Thus, G and G/H need not have the same algebraic properties.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 Show that if a group G is commutative, then so is G/H, for any HD G. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 Take the group D of Example 4.
Show that D /K is abelian, even 8 8 though D is non-abelian.
8 You may be surprised to know that given a group G, we can always defined a normal subgroup H, such that G/H is abelian.
This subgroup is the commutator subgroup.
Definition: Let G be a group and x,y ˛ G, Then x-1y-1xy is called the commutator of x and y.
It is denoted by [x,y].
10 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS The subgroup of G generated by the set of all commutator is called the commutator of G. It is denoted by [G,G] For example, if G is a commutative group, then x-1y-1xy = x-1xy-1 = e" x,y ˛ G.\ [G,G] = {e}.
Try this exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 Obtain [G,G], where g is cyclic.
Now, let us prove the commutativity of the factor group corresponding to the commutator subgroup.
Theorem 6: Let G be a group.
Then [G,G] is a normal subgroup of G. further, G/[G, G] is commutative.
Proof: We must show that, for any commutator x-1y-1xy and for any g ˛ G, g-1(x-1y-1xy)g = ˛ [G, G].
Now g-1(x-1y-1xy)g = (g-1xg)-1 (g-1yg)-1 (g-1xg) (g-1yg) ˛ [G,G].
\ [G, G]D G. Now, for x, y ˛ G, HxHy = HyHx (cid:219) Hxy = Hyx (cid:219) (yx) (yx)-1˛ H (cid:219) xy x-1y-1˛ H. Thus, since xy x-1y-1˛ H " x, y ˛ G, HxHy = HyHx " x, y˛ G/H is abelian.
Note that we have defined the quotient group G/H only if H D G. But if H D/ G we can still define G/H to be the set of all left (or right) cosets of H in G. But, in this case G/H will not be a group.
The following exercise will give you an example.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 For G = S3 and H = < (12) >, show that the product of right cosets in G/H is not well defined.
(Hint: Show that H(1 2 3) = H(2 3) = H(2 3) and H1 3 2) = H(1 3), but H(1 2 3) (1 3 2) „ H(2 3) (1 3) ) 11MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Self Assessment Exercise 13 leads us to the following remark.
Remark: if H is a subgroup of G, then the product of cosets of H is defined only when H D G. This is because, if Hxhy = Hxy" x, y ˛ G, then, in particular, Hx-1 Hx = hx-1x = He = H " x ˛ G. Therefore, for any h˛ H, x-1hx = ex-1hx˛ Hx-1Hx = H. That is, x-1Hx ˝ H for any x ˛ G. \ H D G. Let us now summarise what we have done in this unit.

Again, for any kh ˛ KH, khk-1 ˛ H. Let khk-1 = h .
Then kh = h2k 2 ˛ HK.

Thus, we have shown that HK = KH.

You may have wondered why we reviewed various aspects of functions.
In this unit you will see why.
In sec.
3.1 we will discuss various properties of those functions between groups, which preserve the algebraic structure of their domain groups.
These functions are called group homomorphisms, a term introduced by the mathematician Klein in 1893.
This concept is analogous to the concept of a vector space homomorphism that you studied in the Linear Algebra course.
In Sec.
3.2 we will introduce you to a very important mathematical idea, an isomorphism.
You will see that an isomorphism is a bijective homorphism.
The importance of isomorphisms lies in the fact that two groups are isomophic if and only if they have exactly the same algebraic properties.
In Sec.
3.3 we will prove a very basic theorem of group theory, namely, the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism.
We will also give some of its important consequences.
Finally, in sec.
3.4 we will discuss automorphisms, which are isomophisms of a group onto itself.
We shall look at the group of inner automorphisms in particular.
This allows us to have an insight into the structure of the quotient group of G by its center, for any group G. Before starting this unit, we suggest that you go through sec.
1.5 and unit 5.
16 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you should be able to • Verify whether a function between groups is a homomorphis or not; • Obtain the kernel and image of any homomorphisms; • Check whether a function between groups is an isomorphism or not; • State, prove and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism; • Prove that Inn G D Aut G and G/Z(G) ≃ Inn G, for any group G. 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Homomorphisms Let us start our study of functions from one group to another with an example.
Consider the groups (Z, +) and ({1, - 1},.).
If we define  1, if n is even F:Z → {1, - 1} by f(n) =  -1, if n is odd, Then you can see that f(a + b) = f(a).
f(b) " a, b ˛ Z.
What we have just seen is an example of a homomorphism, a function that preserves the algebraic structure of its domain.
Definition: Let (G ,* ) and (G , * ) be two groups.
A mapping f:G → 1 1 2 2 1 G is said to be a group homoorphism (or just a homomorphism), if.
2 F(x * y) = f(x) * f(y) " x, y ˛ G .
1 2 1 Note that a homomorphism f from G to G carries the produce x * y in 1 2 1 G to the product f(x) * f(y) in G .
1 2 2 Before discussing examples, let us define two sets related to a given homomorphism.
Definition: Let (G1, * ) and (G2 * ) be two groups and f: G1 ﬁ G2 be a 2 2 homomorphism.
Then we define 17MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS i) The image of f to be set Im f = {f(x) | x ˛ G }.
1 ii) The kernel of f is defined to be the set Ker f = {x ˛ G | f(x) = e }, where e is the identity of G .
1 2 2 2 Note that Im f ˝ G , and Ker f = f1 ({e }) ˝ G .
2 2 1 Now let us consider some examples.
Example 1: Consider the two groups (R, +) and (R* ,.).
Show that the map exp: (R, +) ﬁ (R* ,.)
: exp(r)= er is a group homomorphis.
Also find Im exp and Ker exp.
Solution: For any n, r ˛ R, we know that er1+r2 = er1.er2.
2 \ exp(r + r ) = exp(r ).
exp(r ).
1 2 1 2 Hence, exp is a homomorphism from the additive group of real numbers to the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers.
Now, Im exp = {exp(r) | r ˛ R} = {er| r ˛ R}.
Also, Ker exp = {r˛ R|er = 1} = {0}.
Note that exp takes the identity 0 of R to the identity 1 of R* .
exp also carries the additive inverse – r of r to the multiplicative inverse of exp (r).
Example 2: Consider the groups (R, +) and C, +) and define F: C, +) ﬁ (R, +) by f(x + iy) = x, the real part of x + iy.
Show that f is a homomorphism.
What aree Im f and Ker f?
Solution: Take any two elements a + ib and c + id in C. Then, F((a + ib) + (c + id)) = f((a + c) + I(b + d)) = a + c = f(a + ib) + f(c = id) Therefore, f is a group homomorphism.
Im f = {f(x + iy) | x, y ˛ R} = {x |x ˛ R} = R. So, f is a surjective functon (see sec.
1.5).
Ker f = {x + iy ˛ C| f(x + iy) = 0} = {x + iy C| x = 0 } = {iy| y ˛ R}, the set of purely imaginary numbers.
Note that f carries the additive identity of C to the additive identity of R and (and ( - z) to – f(z), for any z ˛ C. The following exercise will help you to see if you have understood what we have covered to far.
18 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 Show that r: (I* ,.)
ﬁ (R, +) : f(x) = Inx, the natural logarithm of x, is a group homomorphism.
Find Ker f and Im f also.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Is f: (GL (R),.)
ﬁ (R* ,.)
: f(A) a homomorphism?
If so, obtain Ker f and 3 Im f. In Example 1 and 2 we observed that the homomorphisms carried the identity and the inverse to the inverse.
In fact, these observations can be proved for any group homomorphism.
Theorem 1: Let f: (G ) ﬁ (G ) be a group homomorphism.
1,* 1 2,* 2 Then a) f(e ) = e , where e is the identity of G and e is the identity of G .
1 2 1 1 2 2 b) f(x-1) = [f(x)-1 for all x in G .
1 Proof: (a) Let x ˛ G .
Then we have e x = x.
Hence, 1 1 * 1 f(x) = f(e x) = f(e ) f(x), since f is a homomorphism.
But 1 * 1 1 * 2 F(x) = e f(x) in G2 2 * 2 Thus, f(e ) f(x) = e f(x).
1 * 2 2* 2 So, by the right cancellation law in G f(e ) = e .
2 1 2 (b) Now, for any x ˛ G , f(x) f(x-1) = f(x x-1 ) = f(e ) = e .
1 * 1 1 2 Similarly, f(x-1) f(x) –e .
* 3 3 Hence, f(x-1) = [f(x)]-1 " x ˛ G .
1 Note that the converse of Theorem 1 is false.
That is, if f: G1 ﬁ G2 is a function such that f(e1) = e2 and [f(x)-1 = f(x-1) " x ˛ G1, then f need not be a homomorphism.
For example, consider f: Z ﬁ Z: f(0) = 0 and n + 1 " n > 0 f(n) = n - 1 " n < 0 Since f(1 + 1) „ f(1) + f(1), f is not a homomorphism.
But f(e ) = e 1 2 and f(n) = - f(-n) " n ˛ Z.
19MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS let us look at a few more examples of homomorphisms now.
We can get one important class of homomorphisms from quotient groups.
Example 3: let HD G. Consider the map p: G ﬁ G/H : p(x) = Hx.
Show that p is a homomorphism.
(pis called the natural or canoical group homomorphis.)
also show that p is onto.
What is Ker p?
Solution: for x, y ˛ G, p(xy) = Hxy = Hx Hy = p(x) p(y).
therefore, p is a homomorphism.
Now, Im p = { p(x)| x ˛ G} = {Hx| x ˛ G} = G/H.
therefore, p is onto.
Ker p = {x ˛ G| p(x) = H}.
(Remember, H is the identity of G/H.)
= {x ˛ G| Hx = H} = {x ˛ G| x ˛ H }, by theorem 1 unit 4.
= H. In this example you can see that Ker pD G. You can also check that theorem 1 is true here.
Before looking at more examples try the following exercises.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 Define the natural homomorphism p from S to s /A .
Does (1 2) ˛ Ker 3 3 3 p?
Does (1 2) ˛ Im p?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 Let S = {z ˛ C| |z| = 1} (see Example 1 of Unit 3).
Define f: (R, +) ﬁ (S,.)
: f(x) = einx, where n is a fixed positive integer.
Is f a homomorphism?
If so, find Ker f. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Let G be a group and HD G. show that there exists a group G and a homomorphism f: Gﬁ G1 such that Ker f = H. (Hint: Does Example 3 help?)
Another class of examples of homomorphisms concerns the inclusion map.
Example 4: Let H be a subgroup of a group G. Show that the map i: H ﬁ G, i(h) = h is a homomorphism.
This function is called the inclusion map.
20 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Solution: Since i(h h ) = h h = i(h )i(h ) " h , h ˛ H, i is a group 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 homomorphism.
Let us briefly look at the inclusion map in the context of symmetric groups.
Consider two natural numbers m and n, where m £ n. Then, we can consider Sm £ Sn, where any s ˛ Sm, written as  1 2 ….
m   s (1) s (2)….
s (m) , is considered to be the same as    1 2 ….. m m + 1…..n s (1)s (2)…..s (m) m + 1….. n ,˛ S , i.e.,s (k) = k for m + 1 £ k£ n.   n Then we can define an inclusion map i S ﬁ S .
m n 1 2 3 4 For example, under i: S3 ﬁ S4 (1 2 ) goes to   2 1 3 4 Try this exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 what are the kernel and image of the inclusion map i :3Z ﬁ Z?
We will now prove some results about homomorphisms.
Henceforth, for convenience, we shall drop the notation for the binary operation, and write a * b as ab.
Now let us look at the composition of two homomorphisms.
Is it a homomrphism?
Let us see.
Theorem 2: If f G1 ﬁ G and g:G ﬁ G are two group 2 2 3 homomorphisms, then the composite map gof: G ﬁ g is also a group 1 3 homomorphism.
Proof: Let x, y ˛ G .
Then 1 gof(xy) = g(f(xy)) = g(f(x)f(y), since f is a homoorphism.
= g(f(x)) g(f(y), since g is a homomorphism.
= gof(x).
gof(y).
Thus, gof is a homomorphism.
Now, using Theorem 2, try and solve the following exercise.
21MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Let n ˛ N. Show that the composition fof: Z ﬁ Z: f(x) = nx and G:Z ﬁ Z/nZ: g(x) = x is a homomorphism.
What are Ker(gof) and Im(gof)?
So far you have seen that the Kernel and image of a hommorphism are sets.
In the examples we have discussed so far you may have noticed that they are subgroups.
We will now prove that the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup, and the image is a subgroup.
Theorem 3: Let f: G ﬁ G be a group homomorphism.
Then 1 2 a) Ker f is a normal subgroup of G .
1 b) Im f is a subgroup of G .
2 Proof: a) since f(e ) = e , e ˛ Ker f. \ Ker f „ ø.
1 2 1 Now, if x, y ˛ Ker f, then f(x) = e and f(y) = e 2 2 \ f(xy-1) = f(x) f(y-1) = f(x) [f(y)]-1 = e 2 \ xy-1 ˛ Ker f. Therefore, by Theorem 1 of unit 3, Ker f £ G .
Now, for any y ˛ G and 1 1 x ˛ Ker f F(y-1xy) = f(y-1) f(x)f(y) =[f(y)]-1e f(y), since f(x) = e and by Theorem 1 1 2 = e .
2 \ Ker f D G 1 b) Im f „ ø, since f(e ) ˛ Im f. 1 Now, let x , y ˛ Im f. Then $ x , y ˛ G such that f(x ) = x and f(y ) = 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 y .
2 \ x y -1 = f(x ) f(y -1) = f(x y -1) ˛ Im f. 2 2 1 1 1 1 \ Im f £ G .
2 Using this result, from Example 2 we can immediately see that the set of purely imaginary numbers is a normal subgroup of C. Let us also consider another example, which is a particular case of E 4(when n = 1 Consider ø: (R +) ﬁ (C*,.)
:f (x) = cos x + i sin x.
We have seen that (x)ø(y), that is, ø is a group homomorphism.
Now ø (x) = I iff x = 2p n) 22 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS for some n ˛ Z.
Thus, by Theorem 3 Ker ø = [2p | n ˛ Z} is a normal subgroup of R +) Note that this is cyclic, and 2p is a generator.
Similarly, Im ø is a subgroup of C*.
This consists of all the complex numbers with absolute value 1, i.e., the complex numbers on the circle with radius 1 unit and center (0.0) You may have noticed that sometimes the kernel of a homomorphism is {e} (as in Example 1), and sometimes it is a large subgroup (as in Example 2), Does the six of the kernel indicate anything?
We will prove that a homomorphism is 1-1 iff its kernel is {e}.
Theorem 4: Let f: G ﬁ G be a group homomorphism.
Then f is 1 2 injective iff Ker f ={e1}.
Where e is the identity element of the group 1 G .
1 Proof: Firstly, assume that f is injective.
Let x ˛ Ker f. then f(x) = e 2 i.e., f(x) = f(e ).
But f is 1-1.
\ x = e .
1 1 Thus, Ker f = {e }.
1 Conversely, suppose Ker f ={e }.
Let x, y ˛ G such that 1 1 F(x) = f(y).
then f(xy-1) = f(x) f(y-1) = f(x) [f(y)]-1 = e .
2 \ xy-1 ˛ Ker f = {e }.
\ xy-1 = e and x = y.
1 1 this shows that f is injective.
So, by using Theorem 4 and Example 4, we can immediately say that any inclusion i:H ﬁ G is 1-1, since Ker i= {e}.
Let us consider another example.
Example 5: Consider the group T of translations of R2 (Example 6, unit 2).
We define a map f : (R2, +) ﬁ (T,o) by f (a, b) = f .
Show that f a.b is an onto homomorphism, which is also 1-1.
Solution: for (a,b), (c, d) in R2, we have seen that F = f f a+c,b+d a,b e,d \f (a, b) + (c, d)) = f (a, b) f (c, d).
Thus, ø is a homomorphism of groups.
23MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Now, any element of t is fa,b = ø(a, b).
Therefore, ø is injective.
We now show that f is also injective.
Let (a,b) ˛ Ker ø.
Then ø(a,b) = f , 0.0 i.e., f = f a,b 0,0 \ f (0,0) = f (0,0), a,b 0,0 i.e., (a,b) = (0,0).
\ Ker ø = { (0,0)} \ ø is 1-1, so we have proved that ø is a homomorphism, which is bijective Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 For any n > 1, consider Z and U (the group of nth roots of unity n n discussed in Example 5 of unit 3).
Let ω demote an nth root of unity that generates U .
Then U = {1, ω, ω2, …, ωn-1}.
Now, consider the n n map f:Z ﬁ U : (r) = ωr.
Show that f is a group homomorphism.
Is f n n 1 1-1?
Is f surjecive?
And now let us look at a very useful property of a homomorphism that is surjective.
ﬁ Theorem 5: If f:G G is an onto group homomorphism and S is 1 2 a subset that generates G1, then f(S) generates G .
2 Proof: We know that G = <S> ={x r1x r2… x rm | m˛ N, x,˛ S r ˛ Z for all i}.
We will show 1 1 2 m i i that G = < f(S) >.
2 Let x ˛ G .
since f is surjective, there exists y ˛ G such that f(y) = x, 2 1 Since y ˛ G , y = x r1 …x rm, for some m ˛ N, where x ˛ S and r ˛ Z, 1 1 m i i 1£ i £ m. Thus.
X = f(y) = f(xir1… xmrm) = (f(x ))r1 … (f(x ))rm, since f is a homomorphism.
1 m ⇒ x ˛ < f(S) >, since f(x) ˛ f(S) for every i = 1, 2, …, r. i Thus.
G = < f(S)>.
2 24 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS In the following exercise we present an important property of cyclic groups which you can prove by using Theorem 5.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 show that the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic, i.e., if G is a cyclic group and f:G → G is a homomorphism, then f(G) is cyclic.
Once you have solved E 9, you can immediately say that any quotient group of a cyclic group is cyclic.
So far you have see examples of various kinds of homomorphisms – injective, surjective and bijective.
Let us now look at bijective homomorphisms in particular.
3.2 Isomorphism In this section we will discuss homomorphisms that are 1-1 and onto.
We start with some definitions.
Definitions: Let G and G be two groups.
A homomorphism f:G → 1 2 1 G is called an isomorphism if f is 1-1 and onto.
2 In this case we say that the group G is isomorphic to the group G or G 1 2 1 and G are isomorphic.
We denote this fact by G ≃G .
2 1 2 An isomorphism of a group G onto itself is called an automorphism of G. For example, the identity function I : G → G : 1G (x) = is an G automorphism.
Let us look at another example of an isomorphism.
 a b  Example 6: Consider the set G =   a, b ˛ R  - b a  Ten g is a group with respect to matrix addition.
 a b Show that f:G → C:f - b a = a + ib is an isomorphism.
Solution: Let us first verify tha f is a homomorphism.
Now, for anytwo elements.
 a b  c d   and  in G, - b a - d c 25MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS  a b  c d  a+c b+d f - b a+ - d c= f - (b+d a+c= (a + c) + i(b + d) = (a + ib) + (c + id)  a b  c d = f- b a+ f - d c There, f is a homomorphism.
 a b   a b  0 0 Now, Ker f=  a + ib = 0 =   a= 0, b = 0 =  - b a  - b a  0 0 Therefore, by Theorem 4 f is 1-1 Finally, since Im f = C, is surjective.
Therefore, f is an isomorphism.
We would like to make an important remark now.
Remark: If G and G are isomorphic groups, they must have the same 1 2 algebraic structure and satisfy the same algebraic properties.
For example, any group isomorphic to a finite group must be finite and the same order.
Thus two isomorphic groups are algebraically indistinguishable systems.
The following result is one of the consequences of isomorphic groups being algebraically alike.
Theorem 6 If f: G ﬁ H is a group isomorphism and x ˛ G, then <x> ≃<f(x)> Therefore, i) if x is of finite order, then o(x) = o(f(x)).
ii) if x is of infinite order, so is f(x).
Proof: If we restrict f to any subgroup K of G, we have the function f| :K ﬁ f(K).
Since f is bijective, so is its restriction f |k.
\ K≃ f(K) for k any subgroup K of G. In particular, for any x ˛ G, <x>≃f(<x>) = < f(x)>, by E9.
Now if x has finite order, then o(x) = o(<x>) = o(<f(x)>) = o(fx)), proving (i).
26 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS To prove (ii) assume that x is of infinite order.
Then <x> is an infinite group.
Therefore, <f(x)> is an infinite group, and hence, f(x) is infinite order, so, we have proved (ii).
Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 Show that Z≃ nZ, for a fixed integar n. Hint: Consider f: (Z, +) ﬁ (nZ, +) : f(k) = nk.)
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 Is f: Zﬁ X: f(x) = 0 a homomorphism?
An isomorphism?
The next two exercises involve general properties of an isomorphism.
E 12 is the isomorphism analogue of theorem 2 E 13 gives us another example to support that isomorphic groups have the same algebraic properties.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 If f : G ﬁ H and q : H ﬁ K are two isomorphisms of groups, then show that q ◦f is an isomorphism of G onto K. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 If f: G ﬁ H is an isomorphis of groups and G is abelian, then show that H is also abelian.
So far we have seen examples of isomorphic groups.
Now consider the following example.
Example 7: Show that (R*,.)
is not isomorphic to (C*,.).
Solution: Suppose they are isomorphic, and f: C*ﬁ R* is an isomorphism.
Then o(i) = o(f(i), by Theorem 6.
Now o(i) = 4.
\ o(f(i)) = 4.
However, the order of any real number different from – 1 is infinite: and o(1) = 1, o( - 1) = 2.
So we reach a contradiction.
Therefore, our supposition must be wrong.
That is, R* and C* are not isomorphic.
27MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Try these exercises now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 14 Show that (C*,.)
is not isomorphic to (R, +).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 Is Z ≃ Z /nZ, for any n „ 1?
You must have noticed that the definition of an isomorphism just says that the map is bijective, i.e., the inverse map exists.
It does not tell us any properties of the inverse.
The next result does so.
Theorem 7 if f: G ﬁ G is an isomorphism of groups, then f-1:G ﬁ G 1 2 2 1 is also an isomorphism.
Proof: From Unit 1 you know that f-1 is bijective.
So, we only need to show that f-1 is a homomorphism.
Let a',b' ˛ G and a = f-1(a'), b = f ( 2 -1 b').
Then f(a) = a' and f(b) = b'.
Therefore, f(ab) = f(a) f(b) = a'b'.
On apply f , we get -1 f-1 (a'b') = ab = f-1 (a') f-1 (b').
Thus, f-1 (a'b') = f-1 (a') f-1 (b') for all a', b'˛ G2.
Hence, f-1 is an isomorphism.
From Example 5 and Theorem 7 we can immediately say that ø-1 : T ﬁ R2 : f -1(f ) = (a, b) is an isomorphism.
a,b Theorem 7 says that if G1≃ G , then G ≃ G .
We will be using this 2 2 1 result quite often (e.g., while proving Theorem 9) Let us now look at a very important theorem in group theory.
In Block 3 you will study its analogue in ring theory and in the Linear Algebra course you have already studied its analogue for linear transformations.
3.3 The Isomomorphism Theorems In this section we shall prove some results about the relation between homomorphisms and quotient groups.
The first result is the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism for groups.
It is called ‘fundamental’ because a lot of group theory depends upon this result.
This result is also called the first isomorphism theorem.
28 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Theorem 8 (Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism) Let G and 1 G be two groups and f:G ﬁ G be a group homomorphism.
Then 2 1 2 G /Ker f ≃ Im f. 1 In particular, if f is onto, then G1/Ker f ≃ G .
2 Proof: Let Ker f = H. Note that H D G .
Let us define the function 1 y :G /H ﬁ Im f: y (Hx) = f(x).
1 At first glance it seems that the definition of y depends on the coset representative.
But we will show that if x, y ˛ G such that Hx = Hy, 1 then y (Hx) = y (Hy).
This will prove that y is a well-defined function.
Now, Hx = Hy ⇒ xy-1 ˛ H = Ker f ⇒ f(y-1) = e , the identity of G .
2 2 ⇒ f(x)[f(y)]-1 = e ⇒ f(x) = f(y).
2 ⇒ y (Hx) = y (Hy).
Therefore, y is a well-define function.
Now, let us check that y is a homomorphism.
For Hx, Hy ˛ G /H, 1 y ((Hx)(Hy)) = y (Hxy) = f((xy) = f(x) f(y), since f is a homomorphism.
= y (Hx) y (Hy).
Therefore, y is a group homomorphism.
Next, Let us see whether y is bijective or not Now, y (Hx) = y (Hy) for Hx, Hy in G /H 1 ⇒ f(x) = f(y) ⇒f(x) [f(y)]-1 = e 2 ⇒f(xy-1) = e 2 ⇒ xy-1 ˛ Ker f = H. ⇒ Hx = Hy Thus, y is 1-1 Also, any element of Im f is f(x) = (Hx), where x ˛ G 1 \ Im y = Im f. so, we have proved that is bijective, and hence, an isomorphism.
Thus, G /Ker f = Im f. 1 Now, if f is surjective, Im f = G .
Thus, in this case G /Ker f ≃ G .
2 1 2 29MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS The situation in Theorem 8 can be show in the following diagram.
r G Im f £ G 1 2 y p G /Ker f 1 Here, p is the natural homomorphism (see example 3).
The diagram says that if you first apply p, and then y , to the elements of G1, it is the same as applying f to them.
That is, y P = f. Also, note that Theorem 8 says that two elements of G1 have the sane image under f iff they belong to the same coset of Ker f. Let us look at a few examples.
One of the simplest situations we can consider is I : G ﬁ G. On G applying theorem 8 here, we see that G/{e} ≃ G. we will be using this identification of G/{e} and G quite often.
Now for some non-trivial examples.
Example 8: Prove that C /R ≃ R. Solution: Define f: Cﬁ R: f(a + ib) = b.
Then f is a homomorphism, Ker f = R and Im f = R. Therefore, on applying Theorem 8 we see that C/R ≃ R. 1, if n is even Example 9: Consider f: Z ﬁ ({1, - 1},.)
: f(n) =  1, if n is odd At the beginning of Sec.
6.2, you saw that f is a homomorphism.
Obtain ker f and Im f. What does Theorem 8 say in this case?
Solution: Let Z and Z denote the set of even and odd integers, c o respectively.
Then Ker f = {n ˛ Z | f(n) = 1} = Z .
c Im f = {f(n) | n ˛ Z } = {1, - 1} Thus, by Theorem 8, Z/Z ≃ {1, - 1} c This also tells us that o(Z/Z ) = 2.
The two cosets of Z in Z are Z and c c c Z , o 30 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS \ {Z , Z } ≃ {1, - 1}.
c o Example 10: show that GL (R)/SL (R) ≃ R*, where 2 2 SL2(R) = {A ˛ GL2(R) | det (A) = 1}.
Solution: We know that the function F:GL2(R) ﬁ R* : f(A) = det (A) is a homomorphism.
Now, Ker f= SL2(R).
r 0 Also, Im f = R*, since any r ˛ R* can be written as det  .
0 1 Thus, using Theorem 8, GL2(R)/SL2(R) ≃R*.
Try the following exercises now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 16 Consider the situation in Example 1 show that (R, +) ≃ (R*,.
), the group of positive real numbers.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 17 Let U be the multiplicative group of 4th roots of unity.
4 Define f: Z ﬁ U : f(n) = in.
Use Theorem 8 to show that Z ≃U .
(I = 4 4 4 - 1.)
Now we will use the fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism to prove a very important result, which classifies all cyclic groups.
Theorem 9: Any cyclic group is isomorphic to (Z, +) or Z , +).
n Proof: Let G = <x> be a cyclic group.
Define f:Z ﬁ G :f(n) = xn.
f is a homomorphism because f(n+m) = xn+m = xn.
Xm = f(n) f(m).
Also note that Im f = G. Now, we have two possibilities for Ker f – Ker f = {0} or Ker f „ {0}.
Case 1 (Ker f = {0}): In this case f is 1-1.
Therefore, f is an isomorphism.
Therefore, by Theorem 7, f1 is an isomorphism.
That is, G≃(Z, +).
31MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Case 2 (Ker f „ {0}): Since Ker f £ Z, from example 4 of Unit 3 we know that Ker f = nZ, for some n ˛ N. Therefore, by the fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism, Z/nZ ≃G.
\ G≃Z/nZ = (Z , +).
n Over here note that since <x> ≃Z , o(x) = n. so, a finite cyclic group is n isomorphic to Z , where n is the order of the group.
n Using Theorem 9 we know that all cyclic groups f order 4 are isomorphic, since they are all isomorphic to Z .
Similarly, all infinite 4 cyclic groups are isomorphic.
And now you can prove the following nice result.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 18 Let S be the circle group {z˛ C | z | = 1}.
Show that R/Z ≃S.
(Hint: Define f: R ﬁ S: f(x) = e2p ix.
Show that f is an onto homomorphism and Ker f = Z).
We will now prove the second isomorphism theorem with the help of the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism.
It is concerned with intersections and products of subgroups.
To prove the theoremyou will need the results given in the following exercise.
So why not do this exercise first!
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 19 Let G be a group, H £ G and K D G. Then i. H ˙ K D H; and ii.
if A £ G such that K ˝ A, then KD A.
Now let us discuss the theorem.
Theorem 10: If H and K are subgroups of a group G, with K normal in G, then H/(H ˙ K) ≃ (HK)/K.
Proof: we must first verify that the quotient groups H/(H ˙ K) and (HK)/K are well-define.
From E 19 you know that H ˙ K D H. from E 6 of unit 5 you know that HK £ G. Again, from E 19 you know that KD HK.
Thus the given quotient groups are meaningful.
32 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Now, what we want to do is to find an onto homorphism f : H ﬁ (HK)/K with kernel H ˙ K. then we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Homorphism and get the result.
We define f:H ﬁ (HK)/K:f(h) = hK.
Now, for x, y ˛ H, f(xy) = xyK = (xK) (yK) = f(x) f(y).
Therefore, f is a homomorphism.
Im f = { f(h) | h ˛ H} ={hK | h ˛ H} We will show that Im f = (HK)/K.
Now, take any element hK ˛ Im f. since h ˛ H. h ˛ HK \ hk ˛ (HK)/K \ Im f ˝ (HK)/K.
on the othr hand, any element of (HK)>K is hkK = hK, since k ˛ K. \ hkK ˛ Im f. \ (HK)/K ˝ Im f. \ Im f = (HK)/K Finally, Ker f = {h˛ H | f(h) = K} = {h ˛ H| hK = K} = {h˛ H| h˛ K} = H ˙ K. Thus, on applying the Fundamental Theorem, we get H/(H˙ K) ≃ (HK)/K We would like to make a remark here.
Remark: If H and K are subgroups of (G. +).
Then Theorem 10 says that (H + K)/K ≃ H/H ˙ K. Now you can use Theorem 10 to solve the following exercises.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 20 Let H and K be subgroups of a finite group G, and H D G. show that o(H)o(K) O(HK) = o(H ˙ K) SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 21 Show that 3Z/12Z ≃ Z 4 (Hint: Take H = 3Z, K = 4Z).
33MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS And now for the third isomorphism theorem.
This is also a corollary to Theorem 8.
Theorem 11: Let H and K be normal subgroups of a group G such that K ˝ H. then (G/K)/(H/K) ≃G/H.
Proof: We will define a homomorphism from G/K onto G/H, whose kernel will turn out to be H/K.
Consider f: G/K ﬁ G/H: f(Kx) = Hx.
F is well-define because Kx = Ky for x, y ˛ G ⇒xy-1 ˛ K ˝ H ⇒ xy-1 ˛ H ⇒ Hx = Hy ⇒ f(Kx) = f(Ky) Now we leave the rest of the proof to you (see the following exercise).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 22 Show that f is an onto homomorphism and Ker f = H/K.
Let us now look at isomorphisms of a group onto itself.
3.4 Automorphisms In this section we will first show that the set of all automorphisms of a group forms a group.
Then we shall define a special subgroup of this group.
Let G be a group.
Consider Aut G = {f: G ﬁ G| f is an isomorphism }.
You have already seen that the identity map IG ˛ Aut G. From E 12 you know that Aut G is closed under the binary operation of composition.
Also.
Theorem 7 says that if f ˛ Aut G, then f-1 ˛ Aut G. We summarize this discussion n the following theorem.
Theorem 12: let G be a group.
Then Aut G, the set of automorphisms of G, is a group.
Example 11: show that Aut Z ≃Z .
2 Solution: Let f:Z ﬁ Z be an automorphism.
Let f(1) = n. We will show that n = 1 or n= -1 .
Since f is onto and 1 ˛ Z, $ m ˛ Z such that f(m) = 1 , i.e., mf(1) = 1,i.e.
mn = 1.
\ n = 1 or n = -1.
34 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Thus, there are only two elements in Aut Z, 1 and – 1.
So Aut Z = < - 1> ≃Z .
2 Now, given an element of a group G, we will define an automorphism of G corresponding to it.
Consider a fixed element g ˛ G. Define F : G ﬁ G: f (x) = gxg-1.
g g We will show that fg is an automorphism of G. i) fg is a homorphism : If x, y ˛ G, then f (xy) = g(xy) g-1 g = gx(e) yg-1, where e is the identity of G. =gx(g-1g) yg-1 =(gxg-1) gyg-1) =f (x) f (y).
g g ii) f is 1-1: for x, y ˛ G, f (x) = f (y) ⇒ gxg-1 = gyg-1 ⇒ x = y, by g g g the cancellation laws in G. iii) fg is onto: If y ˛ G, then y = (gg-1 )y (gg -1) = g(g-1 yg) g-1 = f (g-1 yg) ˛ Im f .
g g Thus, f is an automorphism of G. We give this automorphism a special g name.
Definition: f is called an inner automorphism of G induced by the g element g in G. The subset of Aut G consisting of all inner automorphism of G is denoted by Im G. For example, consider S .
Let us compute f (1).
f (1 3) and f (1 2 3 g g g 3).Where g = (1 2).
Note that g –1 =(1 2) = g. Now.
f (1) = g ∘1∘g–1 = 1. g f (1 3) = (1 2) (1 3) (1 2) = (2 3), g f (1 2 3) = (1 2) (1 2 3) (1 2) = (1 3 2).
g The following exercise will give you some practice in obtaining inner automorphisms.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 23 Obtain the image of fg ˛ Inn G, where 35MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS  0 1 a) G = GL2 (R) and g =   - 1 0 b) G = Z and g = 3. c) G = Z/5Z and g = 4.
You will now see that Im G is a normal subgroup of Aut G. Theorem 13: Let G be a group.
Then Inn G is a normal subgroup of Aut G. Proof: Inn G is non-empty, because I = f ˛ Inn G, where e is the G g identity in G. Now, Let us see if fgofh ˛ Inn G for g, h˛ .
For any x ˛ G fgofh(x) = fg(hxh-1) =g(hxh-1) g-1 = (gh) x (gh)-1 = f (x).
gh Thus, f = fgofh, i.e., Inn G is closed under composition.
Also f = 1 gh g G belongs to Inn G. Now, for f ˛ Inn G, $ f -1 ˛ Inn G such that g g f of -1 = fgg-1 = f = I .
Similarly, f -1of = I .
g g c G g g G Thus, f -1 = (f )-1.
That is, every element of Inn G has an inverse in Inn g g G. This proves that Inn G is a subgroup of Aut G. Now, to prove that Inn GD Aut G, let ø˛ Aut and G and f ˛ Inn G. g then, for any x ˛ G ø-1 of oø (x) = ø -1 of (f (x)) g g = ø -1 (g ø(x)g-1) = ø -1 (g) ø -1 (ø (x)) ø -1(g-1) = ø -1 (g) x{ ø -1(g)}-1 = f ø -1(g) (x).
Note that ø -1(g) ˛ G.) \ ø -1 fg ø = f f -1(g) ˛ Inn G " ø ˛ Aut G and fg ˛ Inn G. \ Inn G D Aut G. Now for some exercises!
From E 23 you may have already got a hint of the useful result that we give in E 24.
36 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 24 Show that a group G is commutative iff Inn G = {I }.
G SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 25 Show that if x ˛ G such that f (x) = x" g ˛ G, then <x> D G. g Now we will prove an interesting result, which relates the costs of the center of a group G to Inn G. Recall that the center of G, Z(G) = {x˛ G| xg = gx= " g˛ G}.
Theorem 14: Let G be a group.
Then G/Z(G) ≃ Inn G. Proof: As usual, we will use the powerful Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism to prove this result.
We define f: G ﬁ Aut G: f(g) = f .
g Firstly, f is a homomorphism because for g, h ˛ G, F(gh) = f gh = f ofh (see proof of Theorem 13) g = f(g)∘f(h).
Next, Inn f = {fg|g ˛ G} = Inn G. Finally, Ker f = {g ˛ G| f = I } g G ={g ˛ G| f (x) = x" x vG} g ={f˛ G|gxg-1 = x" x˛ G} = {g ˛ G| gx = xg" x˛ G} = Z(G).
Therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem G/Z(G) ≃Inn G. Now you can use Theorem 14 to solve the next exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 26 Show that S3 ≃Inn S3.

2.5.2.
This is the symmetric group.
As you have often seen in previous units, the symmetric group S , as well as its subgroups, have provided us with n a lot of examples.
The symmetric groups and their subgroups are called permutation groups.
It was the study of permutation groups and groups of transformations that gave the foundation to group theory.
In this unit we will present all the information about permutation groups that you have studied so far, as well as some more.
We will discuss the structure of permutations, and look at even permutations in particular.
We will show that the set of even permutations is a group called the alternating group.
We will finally prove a result by the mathematician Cayley, which says that every group is isomorphic to a permutation group.
This result is what makes permutation groups so important.
We advise you to read this unit carefully, because it gives you a concrete basis for studying and understanding the theory of groups.
We also suggest that you go through Sec.
2.5.2 again, before tackling this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit, you should be able to • Express any permutation in S as a product of disjoint cycles; n • Find out whether an element S is odd or even; n • Prove that the alternating group of degree n is normal in S and is n of order • Prove and use Cayley’s theorem.
45MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Symmetric Group From Sec.
2.5.2, you know that a permutation on a non-empty set X is a bijective function from X onto X.
We denote the set of all permutations on X by S(X).
Let us recall some facts from Sec.
2.5.2.
Suppose X is a finite set having n elements.
For simplicity, we take these elements to be 1, 2, …, n. Then, we denote the set of all permutations on these n symbols by S .
n We represent any f ˛ S in a 2-line form as n  1 2 .... n  f =     f(1) f(2).... f(n) Now, there are n possibilities for (1), namely, 1, 2, …, n. Once f(1) has been specified there are (n – 1) possibilities for f(2), namely, {1, 2, …., n}\{f(1)}.
This is because f is 1-1.
Thus, there are n(n – 1) choices for f(1) and f(2).
Continuing in this manner, we see that there are n!
different ways in which f can be defined.
Therefore, S has n!
elements.
n Now, let us look at the algebraic structure of S(X), for any set X.
The composition of permutations is a binary operation on S(X).
To help you again practice in computing the composition of permutations, consider an example.
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 Let f =  and g =   be in S     4.
2 4 1 3 4 1 3 2 Then, to get f∘g we first apply g and then apply f. \ f∘g (1) = f(g(1)) = f(4) = 3. f∘g (2) = f(g(2)) = f(1) = 2. f∘g (3) = f(g(3)) = f(3) = 1. f∘g (4) = f(g(4)) = f(2) = 4.
1 2 3 4 \ f∘g =     3 2 1 4 We show this process diagrammatically in fig.

1: (1 2 4 3) ∘∘∘∘(1 4 2) in S .
4 Now, let us go back to S(X), for any set X.
We have proved the following result in Sec.
2.5.2.
Theorem 1: Let X be a non-empty set.
Then the system (S(X), ∘) forms a group, called the symmetric group of X.
Thus, S is a group of order n|, we call S the symmetric group of degree n n n. note that if r ˛ S , then n f(1) f(2) ... f(n) f-1 =  .
   1 2 ... n  Now, with the experience that you have gained in previous units, try the following exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 show that (S ,∘) is a non-commutative group for n ≥ 3. n 1 2 3 1 2 3 Hint: Check that  and   don’t commute.)
    2 3 1 3 2 1 At this point we would like to make a remark about our terminology and notation.
Remark: From now on we will refer to the composition of permutations as multiplication of permutations.
We will also drop the composition sign.
Thus, we will write f∘g as fg.
Te two-line notation that we have used for a permutation is rather cumbersome.
In the next section we will see how to use a shorter notation.
47MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3.2 Cyclic Decomposition In this section we will first see how to write permutations conveniently, as a product of cycles.
Let us first see what a cyclic is.
1 2 3 4 Consider the permutation f=  .Choose any one of the   3 1 4 2 symbols, say 1.
Now, we write down a left hand bracket followed by 1: (1 Since f maps 1 to 3, we write 3 after 1: (1 3 Since f maps 3 to 4, we write 4 after 3: (1 3 4 Since f maps 4 to 2, we write 2 after 4: (1 3 4 2 Since f maps 2 to 1 (the symbol we started with), after the symbol we close the brackets (1 3 4 2 Thus, we write f = (1 3 4 2).
This means that f maps each symbol to the symbol on its right, except for the final symbol in the brackets, which is mapped to the first.
If we had chosen 3 as our starting symbol we would have obtained the expression (3 4 2 1) for f. however, this means exactly the same as (1 3 4 2), because both denote the permutation which we have represented diagrammatically in Fig 2.
Such a permutation is called a 4-cyclic, or a cyclic of length 4.Fig 2 can give you an indication as to why we give this name.
1 3 2 4 Fig.
2: (1 3 4 2) Let us give a definition now.
Definition: A permutation f ˛ S is called an r-cyclic (or cyclic of n length r) if there are r distinct integers i , i , i , …, i, lying between 1 and 1 2 3 n such that f(i ) = i , f(i ) = i , …., f(i ) = i, f(ir) = i1.
1 2 2 3 r-1 r And f(k) = k " k ˇ {i , i , ….,i} 1 2 r Then, we write f = (i i ….. i) 1 2 r 48 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS In particular, 2-cycles are called transpositions.
|For example, the permutation f = (2 3) ˛ S is a transposition.
Here f(1) = 1, 3 and f(3) = 2.
3 Later in this section you will see that transpositions play a very important role in the theory of permutations.
Now consider any 1-cycles (i) in S .
It is simply the identity n permutation 1 2 ..... n 1 =  , Since it maps i to i and the other (n – 1) symbols to   1 2 ..... n themselves.
Let us see some examples of cycles in S .
(1 2 3) is the 3-cycles that 3 takes 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 1.
There are also 3 transpositions in S , 3 namely, (1 2), (1 3) and (2 3).
The following exercise will help you to see if you’ve understood what a cycles is.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Write down 2 transpositions, 2 3-cycles and a 5-cycle in S .
5 Now, can we express any permutation as a cycles?
No.
Consider the following example from S5.
Let be the permutation defined by 1 2 3 4 5 g =  .
  3 5 4 1 2 If we start with the symbol 1 and apply the procedure for obtaining a cycle to g, we obtain (1 3 4) after three steps.
Because g maps 4 to 1, we close the brackets, even though we have not yet written down all the symbols.
Now we simply choose another symbol that has not appeared so far, say 2, and start the process of writing a cycle again.
Thus, we obtain another cycle (2 5).
Now, all the symbols are exhausted.
\ g = (1 3 4) (2 5).
We call this expression for g a product of a 3-cycle and a transposition.
In Fig.3 we represent g by a diagram, which shows the 3-cycle, and the 2-cycle clearly.
49MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3 2 5 1 4 Fig.
3:1 3 4) (2 5) Because of the arbitrary choice of symbol at the beginning of each cycle, there are many ways of expressing g. For example, g = (4 1 3) (2 5) = (2 5) (1 3 4) = (5 2) (3 4 1).
That is, we can write the product of the separate cycles in any order, and the choice of the starting element within each cycle is arbitrary.
So, you see that g can’t be written as a cycle; it is a product of disjoint cycles Definition: We call two cycles disjoint if they have no symbol in common.
Thus, disjoint cycles move disjoint sets of elements.
(Note that f˛ S moves a symbol i if f(i) ≠ i.
We say that fixes i if f(i) = i) n So, for example, the cycles (1 2) and (3 4) on S are disjoint.
But (1 2) 4 and (1 4) are not disjoint, since they both move 1.
Note that if f and g are disjoint, then fg = gf, since f and g move disjoint sets of symbols.
Now let us examine one more example.
Let h be the permutation in S , 5 defined by 1 2 3 4 5 h =     4 2 3 5 1 Following our previous rules, we obtain h = (1 4 5) (2) (3), because each of the symbols 2 and 3 is left unchanged by h. by convention, we don’t include the 1-cycles (2) and (3) in the expression for h unless we wish to emphasize them, since they just represent the identity permutation.
Thus, we simply write h = (1 4 5).
If you have understood our discussion so far, you will be able to solve the following exercises.
50 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 Express each of the following permutations as products of disjoint cycles in the manner demonstrated above.
1 2 3 4 5 i.
    5 4 2 1 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ii.
    8 4 7 2 1 3 6 5 1 2 3 4 5 iii.
    4 5 3 1 2 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 Do the cycles (1 3) and (1 5 4) commute?
Why?
What you have seen in E 3 is true in general.
We state the following result.
Theorem 2: Every permutation f ˛ S , f ≠ 1, can be expressed as a n product of disjoint cycles.
The proof of this statement is tedious.
It is the same process that you have applied in E 3.
So we shall not do it here.
Now we will give you some exercise in which we give some interesting properties of permutations.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Show that every permutation in S is a cycle iff n < 4. n SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 If f = (i1 i ….. i) ˛ S , then show that 2 r n f-1 = (i i ….
i i ).
r r-1 2 1 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 If f is an r-cycle, then show that o(f) = r, i.e., fr = 1 and f5 ≠ 1, if s<r.
(Hint: if f = (i i ….i), then f(i ) = i f2 (i ) = i ,…., fr-1 (i ) = i) 1 2 r 1 2 1 3 1 r 51MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS and now let us see how we can write a cycle as a product of transpositions.
Consider the cycle (1 5 3 4 2) in S .
You can check that 5 this is the same as the product (1 2) (1 4 ) (1 3) (1 5).
Not that these transpositions are not disjoint.
In fact, all of them move the element 1.
The same process that we have just used is true for any cycle.
That is, any r-cycle (i i ……i) can be written as (i i) (i i ) ….. (i i ), a product of 1 2 r 1 r 1 r-1 1 2 transpositions.
Note that, since the transpositions aren’t disjoint, they need not commute.
Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 Express the following cycles as products of transpositions: a) (1 3 5), b) (5 3 1), c) (2 4 5 3).
Now we will use Theorem 2 to state a result which shows why transpositions are so important in the theory pf permutation.
Theorem 3: Every permutation in Sn (n ≥ 2) can be written as a product of transpositions.
Proof: The proof is really very simply.
By Theorem 2 every permutation, apart from 1, is a product pf disjoint cycles.
Also, you have just seen that every cycle is aproduct of transpositions.
Hence, every permutation, apart from 1 is a product of transposition.
Also, 1 = ( 1 2) (1 2) Thus, 1 is also a product of transpositions.
So, the theorem is proved.
Let us see how Theorem 3 works in practice.
The permutation in E 3(a) is (1 5 3 2 4).
This is the same as (1 4) (1 2) (1 3) (1 5).
1 2 3 4 5 6 Similarly, the permutation     3 6 4 1 2 5 = (1 3 4) (2 6 5) = (1 4) (1 3) (2 5)(2 6).
Now you can try your hand at this process.
52 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Write the permutation in E 3(b) as a product of transpositions.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 Show that (1 2….10) = (1 2) (2 3) ….
(9 10).
The decomposition given in Theorem 3 leads us to a subgroup of S that n we will now discuss.
3.3 Alternating Group You have seen that a permutation in S can be written as a product of n transpositions.
From E 10 you can see that the factors in the product are not uniquely determined.
But all such representations have one thing in common – if a permutation in S is the product of an odd number of n transposition in one such representation, then it will be a product of a odd number of transpositions in any such representation, similarly, if ˛ S is a product of an even number of transpositions in one n representation, then f is a product of an even number of transpositions in any such representation.
To see this fact we need the concept of the signature or sign function.
Definition: The signature of f ˛ S (n ≥ 2) is define to be n n f(j)- f(i) Sign f = Π i,j=1 j- i i<j for example, for f = (1 2 3) ˛ S , 3 f(2)- f(1) f(3)- f(1) f(3)- f(2) sign f = 2- 1 3- 1 3- 2 3- 2 1- 2 1- 3 =       = 1.
 1   2   1  Similarly, if f = (1 2), ˛ S , then 3 f(2)- f(1) f(3)- f(1) f(3)- f(2) Sign f = 2- 1 3- 1 3- 2 1- 2 3- 2 3- 1 =      = -1.
 1   2   1  Henceforth, whenever we talk of sign f, we shall assume that f ˛ S for n some n ≥ 2.
Try this simple exercise now.
53MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE11 What is the signature of 1 ˛ S ?
n Have you noticed that the signature define a function Sign: S → Z?
We will now show that this function is a homomorphism.
n Theorem 4: Let f,g ˛ S .
Then sign (f ∘g) = (sign g).
n Proof: By definition, n f(g(j))- f(g(i)) Sign fog = Π i,j=1 j- i i<j f(g(j))- f(g(i)) g(j)- g(i) P P i,j g(j)- g(i) i,j j- i Now, as i and j take all possible pairs of distinct values from 1 to n, so do g(i) and g(j) since g is a bijection f(g(j))- f(g(i)) \ P = sign f. i,<j g(j)- g(i) \ sign (fog) = (sign f) (sign g).
Now we will show that Im (sign) = {1, - 1}.
Theorem 5: a) If t ˛ S is a transposition, then sign t = - 1. n b) sign f = 1 or –1 " f ˛ Sn.
c) Im (sing) = {1, - 1}.
Proof: a) Let t = (p q), where p < q.
Now, only one factor of sign t involves both p and q, namely, t(q)- t(p) p- q = = -1. q- p q- p Every factor of signt that doesn’t contain p or q equals 1, since t(i)- t(j) i- j = 1, if i, j„ p, q. i- j i- j The remaining factors contain either p or q. but not both.
These can be paired together to form one of the following products.
t(i)- t(p) t(i)- t(q) i- q i- p = = 1, if i> q, i- p i- q i- p i- q t(i)- t(p) t(q)- t(i) i- q p- i = = 1, if q> i> p, i- p q- i i- p q- i 54 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS t(p)- t(i) t(q)- t(i) q- i p- i = = 1, if i< p. p- i q- i p- i q- i Taking the values of all the factors of sign t, we see that sign t = -1. b) Let f ˛ S .
By Theorem 3 we know that f = t t …..t for some n 1 2 r transpositions t , ….. t in S 1 r n \ sign f = sign (t t ….
t) 1 2 r = (sign t1) (sign t2) ….. sign (t), by Theorem 4. r = ( - 1)r, by (a) above.
\ sign f = 1 or – 1. c) We know that Im (sign) ˝ {1, - 1}.
We also know that sign t = -1, for any transposition t; and sign 1 = 1.
\ {1, -1} ˝ Im (sign).
\ Im (sign) = {1, - 1} Now, we are in a position to prove what we said at the beginning of this section.
Theorem 6: Let f ˛ S and let n f = t t …..t =t t …t 1 2 r 1 2 s X two factorization of f into a product of transpositions.
Then either both r and s are even integers, or both are odd integers.
Proof: We apply the function Sign: S → {1, - 1} to f = t t …..t. n 1 2 r By Theorem 5 we see that Sign f = (sign t ) (sign t ) ….. (sign t ) = (-1)r. 1 2 1 \ sign (t t …..t r substituting(t t …..t for f. 1 2 s) = ( - 1), 1 2 s that is, ( - 1)s = ( - 1)r. This can only happen if both s and r are even, or both are odd.
So, we have shown that for f ˛ S , the number of factors occurring in n any factorization of f into transpositions is always even or always odd.
Therefore, the following definition is meaningful.
Definition: A permutation f ˛ S is called even if it can be written as a n product of an even number of transposition.
f is called off if it can be represented as a product of an odd number of transpositions.
55MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS For example, (1 2) ˛ s is an odd permutation.
In fact, any transposition 3 is an odd permutation.
On the other hand, any 3-cycle is an even permutation, since (i jk) (i k) (i j).
Now, see if you’ve understood what odd and even permutations are SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 Which of the permutation in E 8 and 9 are odd?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 If f, g ˛ S are odd, then is f∘g odd too?
n SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 14 Is the identity permutation odd or even?
Now, we define an important subset of S namely, n An = {f ˛ S | f is even}.
n n!
We’ll sow that A D S , and that o(A ) = , for n ‡ 2. n n n 2 Theorem 7: The set An, of even permutations in S , forms a normal n n!
subgroup of S of order n 2 Proof: Consider the signature function, Sign: S → {1, - 1}.
n Note that {1, - 1} is a group with respect to multiplication.
Now Theorem 4 says that sign is a group homomorphism and Theorem 5 says that Im (sign) = {1, - 1}.
Let us obtain Ker (sign).
Ker (sign) = {f ˛ S | sign f = 1} n = {f ˛ S | f is even} n = A .
n \ A D S .
n n Further, by the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism S /A ≃ {1, - 1}.
n n o(S ) \ o(S /A ) = 2, that is, n = 2. n n o(A ) n 56 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS o(S ) n!
\ o(A ) = n = .
n 2 2 Note that this theorem says that the number of even permutations in S n equals the number of odd permutations in S .
n Theorem 7 leads us to the following definition.
Definition: A , the group of even permutations in S , is called the n n alternating group of degree n. Let us look at an example that you already seen in previous units, A .
3 3!
Now, Theorem 7 says that o(A ) = = 3.
3 2 Since (1 2 3) = (1 3) (1 2), (1 2 3) ˛ A .
3 Similarly, (1 3 2) ˛ A .
Of course, 1 ˛ A .
3 3 \ A3 = {1, (1 2 3) = (1 3 2)}.
A fact that we have used in the example above is that an r-cycle is odd if r is even, and even if r is odd.
This is because (i i ….i) = (i i) (i i ) 1 2 r 1 r 1 r-1 …… (i i ), a product of (r – 1) transpositions.
Use this fact to do the 1 2 following exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 Write down all the elements of A .
4 Now, for a moment, let us go back to unit 4 and Lagrange’s theorem.
This theorem says that the order of the subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group.
We also said that if n | o(G), then G need not have a subgroup of order n. Now that you know what A looks like, 4 we are in a position to illustrate this statement.
We will show that A has no subgroup of order 6, even though 6 | o (A ).
4 4 Suppose such a subgroup H exists.
Then o(H) = 6, o(A ) = 12.
\ |A : 4 4 H| = 2.
\ H D A (see Theorem 3 unit 5).
Now A /H is a group of order 4 4 2.
Therefore, by E 8 of unit 4, (Hg)2 = H " g ˛ A .
(Remember H is the identity of A /H.)
4 4 \ g2 ˛ H " g ˛ A .
4 Now, (1 2 3) ˛ A \ (1 2 3)2 = (1 3 2) ˛ H. 4 Similarly, (1 3 2)2 = (1 2 3) ˛ H. By the same reasoning (1 4 2), (1 2 4) (1 4 3) (1 3 4), (2 3 4), (2 4 3) are also distinct element of H. of course, 1 ˛ H. Thus, H contains at least 9 elements.
57MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS \ o(H) ≥ 9.
This contradicts our assumption that o(H) = 6.
Therefore, A has no subgroup of order 6.
4 We use A to provide another example too.
(See how useful A is!)
In 4 4 Unit 5 we’d said that if H D N and ND G, then H need not be normal in G. well, here’s the example.
Consider the subset Y = {1(1 2) (3 4), (1 4) (2 3), (1 3) (2 4)) of A .
4 4 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 16 Check that (V , ∘) is a normal subgroup of A .
4 4 Now, let H = {1,(1 2) (3 4)}.
Then H is a subgroup of index 2 in V .
\ 4 H D V .
4 So, H D V , V D A .
But HD A .
why?
Well, (1 2 3) ˛ A is such that 4 4 4 4 4 (1 2 3)-1 (1 2) (3 4) (1 2 3) = (1 3 (2 4) ˇ H. And now let us see why permutation groups are so important in group theory.
3.4 Cayley’s Theorem Most finite groups that first appeared in mathematics were groups of permutations.
It was the English mathematician Cayley who first realized that every group has the algebraic structure of a subgroup of S(X), for some set X.
In this section we will discuss Cayley’s result and some of its applications.
Theorem 8 (Cayley): Any group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S(G).
Proof: For a ˛ G, we define the left multiplication function f : G→G: f (x) = ax.
a a fa is 1-1, since f (x) = f (y) ⇒ ax = ay ⇒ x = y " x, y ˛ G. a a f is onto, since any x ˛ G is f (a-1x).
a a \ f ˛ Z(G) " a ˛ G. a (Note that S(G) is the symmetric group on the set G.) now we define a function f: Gﬁ S(G) : f(a) = f .
a we will show that f is an injective homomorphism.
For this we note that (f ∘f ) (x) = f (bx) = abx = f (x) " a, b ˛ G. a b a ab \ f(ab) = f = f ∘f = f(a) ∘f(b) " a, b ˛ G. ab a b that is, f is a homomorphism.
Now, Ker f = {a ˛ G| fa = IG} 58 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS = {a ˛ G| fa (x) = x " x ˛ G } = {a ˛ G | ax = x " x ˛ G} = {e}.
Thus, by the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism, G/Ker f ≃Im f ≤ S(G), That is, G is isomorphic to a subgoup of S(G).
As an example of Cayley’s theorem, we will show you that the Klein 4 – group K4 (ref.
Example 7, unit 3) is isomorphic to the subgroup V4 of S4.
the multiplication table for K4 is .
e a b c e e a b c a a e c b b b c e a c c b a e SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 17 Check that f = 1, f = (e a) (b c), f = (e b) (a c), f = (e c) (a b).
e a b c On solving E 17 you can see that K ≃{1,(e a) (b c), (e b) (a c), (e c) (a b)}.
Now, just replace the symbols 4 e, a, b, c by 1, 2, 3, 4 and you’ll get V .
4 \ K ≃V .
4 4 Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 18 Obtain the subgroup of S , to which Z is isomorphic.
Is Z ≃A ?
4 4 4 4 So let us see what we have done in this unit.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit we have studied permutation groups and the structure of permutations.
We have studied the set of even permutation which is called the alternating group.
We also proved Cayley’s Theorem which says every group is isomorphic to a permutation group.
This singular result makes permutation groups so important.

In this unit we will pay special attention to certain finite groups and discuss their structures.
For example, you will see that any group of order 6 is cyclic or is isomorphic to S .
3 To be able to describe the structure of a finite group we need some knowledge of a direct product of groups.
In Sec.3.2 and 3.3 we will discuss external and internal direct product.
In Sec.
3.4 we discuss the uses of certain results obtained by the famous mathematician Sylow (1832-1918).
These theorems, as well as a theorem by Cayley, allow us to determine various subgroups of some finite groups.
Finally, in 3.5, we use the knowledge gained in Sec.
3.3 and Sec.3.4 to describe the structures of several finite groups.
In particular, we discuss groups of order less than or equal to 10.
With this unit we wind up our discussion of group theory.
In the next module you will start studying ring theory.
Of course, you will keep using what you have learnt in the first two blocks, because every ring is a group also, as you will see.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you should be able to 64 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS • Construct the direct product of a finite number of groups; • Check if a group is a direct product of its subgroup; • Use Sylow’s theorem to obtain the possible subgroups and structures of finite groups.
• Classify groups of order p, p2 or pq where p and q are primes such that p > q and qc p – 1.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Direct Product of Groups In this section we will discuss a very important method of constructing new groups by using given groups as building blocks.
We will first see how two groups can be combined to form a third group.
Then we will see how two subgroups of a group can be combined to form another subgroup.
3.2 External Direct Product In this sub-section we will construct a new group from two or more groups that we already have.
Let (G , ) and (G , ) be two groups.
Consider their Cartesian product 1 *1 2 *2 G = G X G = {(x, y) | x ˛ G , y ˛ G } 1 2 1 2 Can we define a binary operation on G by using the operations on G1 and G2?
Let us try the obvious method, namely, componentwise multiplication.
That is, we define the operation on G by (a, b) (c, d) = * * (a c, b d) " a, c ˛ G , b, d ˛ G .
*1 *2 1 2 The way we have defined ensures that it is a binary operating.
* To check that (G, ) is a group, you need to solve the following exercise.
* SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 Show that the binary operation on G is associative.
Element and the * inverse of any element (x, y) in G. If you have proved that G - G x G is a group with respect to .We call 1 2 * G the external direct product of (G , ) and (G , ).
1 *1 2 *2 For Example R2 is the external direct product of R with itself.
65MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Another example is the direct product (Z, +)X(R*,.)
in which the operation is given by (m, x) (n, y) = (m+n, xy).
* We can also define the external direct product of 3, 4 or more groups on the same line.
Definition: Let (G , ) (G , ), ….., (G , ) be n groups.
Their external 1 *1 2 *2 n *n direct product is the, be n group (G, ), where * G = G X G ….. X G and 1 2 n (x , x …., x ) (y , y …..,y ) = (x ) " x , y ˛ G .
1 2 n * 1 2 n 1 *1 y1, x2 *2 y2,…..,xn *n yn 1 1 1 Thus, Rn is the external direct product of n copies of R. We would like to make a remark about notation now.
Remark 1: Henceforth, we will assume that all the operations , 1……, * * n are multiplication, unless mentioned otherwise.
Thus, the operation * on G = G X G X….X G will be given by 1 2 n (a ….a ), (b ,….., b ) 1 n 1 n = (a b , a b ,…..,a b ) " a , b ˛ G .
1 1 2 2 n n 1 1 1 Now try the following exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Show that G X G G X G , for any two groups G and G .
1 2 2 1 1 2 Because of E 2 we can speak of the direct product of 2 (or n) groups without bothering about their order.
Now, let G be the external direct product G X G .
Consider the 1 2 projection map p 1: G X G ﬁ G : p (x, y) = x.
1 2 1 1 then p is a group homomorphism, since 1 p ((a, b) (c, d))) = p (ac, bd) 1 1 = ac = p (a, b) p (c, d) 1 1 p 1 is also onto, because any x ˛ G is p (x, e ) 1 1 2 Now, let us look at Ker p .
1 Ker p = {(x, y) ˛ G X G | p (x, y) = e } 1 1 2 1 1 = {(e , y) |y ˛ G } = {e } X G .
1 2 1 2 \ {e } X G D G x G .
1 2 1 2 Also, by the Fundamental theorem of Homomorphism (G x G )/ ({e } x 1 2 1 G ) ≃ G .
2 1 66 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS We can similarly prove that G x{e }D D xG and (G xG )/(G x{e }) ≃ 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 G .
2 In the following exercise we give you general facts about external direct products of groups.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 Show that G x G is the product of its normal subgroups H = G x{e ) 1 2 1 2 and K = {e }x G .
1 2 Also show that G x {e }) ˙ ({e } x G ) = {(e , e )}.
1 2 1 2 1 2 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 Prove that Z(G X G ) = Z(G ) Z(G ), where (G) denote Im Theorem 2 1 2 1 2 of unit 3).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Let A and B be cyclic groups of order m and n, respectively, Then apply Prove that AXB is cyclic of order mn.
Hint: Define f: Zﬁ Z X Z : f(r) = (r + mZ, r + nZ).
Then apply m m Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism to show that Z X Z ≃ Z .
m n mn So far we have seen the construction of G X G from two groups G and 1 2 1 G .
Now we will see under what conditions we can express a group as a 2 direct product of its subgroups.
3.3 Internal Direct Product Let us begin by recalling from Unit 5 if H and K are normal subgroups of a group G, then HK is a normal subgroup of G. we are interested in the case when HK is the whole of G. We have the following definition.
Definition: Let H and K be normal subgroups of a group G, We call G the internal direct product of H and K if G = HK and H ∩ K = {e}.
We write this fact as G = H X K. For example, let us consider the familiar Klein 4-group K = {e, a, b, ab}, where a2 = e, b2 = e and ab = ba.
4 Let H = <a> and K = <b>.
Then H ∩ K = {e}.
Also, K = HK 4 67MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS \ K = H X K. 4 Note that H ≃Z and K ≃Z \ K ≃Z X Z .
2 2 4 2 2 For another example, consider Z .
it is the internal direct product of its 10 subgroups H = {0, 5} and K = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.
This is because i) Z = H + K, since any element of Z is the sum of an element of 10 10 H and an element of K, and ii) H ∩ K = {0}.
Now, can an external direct product also be an internal direct product?
Well, go back to E 3.
What does if say?
It says that the external product of G X G is the internal product 1 2 (G X {e }) X ({e } X G ).
1 2 1 2 We would like to make a remark here.
Remark 2: Let H and K be normal subgroups of a group G. Then the internal direct product of H and K is isomorphic to the external direct product of H and K. Therefore when we talk of an internal direct product of subgroups we can drop the word internal, and just say ‘direct product of subgroups’.
Let us now extend the definition of the internal direct product of two subgroups to that of several subgroups.
Definition: A group G is the internal direct product of its normal subgroups.
H , H , ….., H if 1 2 n i) G = H H ……H , and 1 2 n ii) H ∩H …… H H …..H = {e}" i =, ….., n 1 1 i-1 i+1 n For example, look at the group G generated by {a, b, c,}, where a2 = e = b2 = c2 and ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb.
This is the internal direct product of <a>, <b> and <c> That is G ≃Z X Z X Z .
2 2 2 Now, can every group be written as an internal direct product of two or more of its proper normal subgroups?
Consider Z. suppose Z = H X K, where H, K are subgroups of Z From Example 4 of Unit 3 you know that H = <m> and K = <n> for some m, n ˛ Z.
Then mn ˛ H ∩ K. But if H X K is a direct product, H ∩ K = {0}.
So, we reach a contradiction.
68 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Therefore, Z can’t be written as an internal direct product of two subgroups.
By the same reasoning we can say that Z can’t be expressed as H X H 1 2 X …..X H , where Hi£ Z " i = 1, 2, ….., n. n When a group is an internal direct product of its subgroups, it satisfies the following theorem.
Theorem 1: Let a group G be the internal direct product of its subgroups H and K. then a) each x ˛ G can be uniquely expressed as x = hk, where h ˛ H, k ˛ K; and b) hk = kh " h ˛ H, k ˛ K. Proof: a) we know that G = HK.
Therefore, if x ˛ G, then x = hk, for some h ˛ H, k ˛ K. Now suppose x = h k also, where h ˛ H and k ˛ K. 1 1 1 1 Then hk = h k .
1 1 \ h -1h = k k-1.
Now h -1h ˛ H. 1 1 1 Also, since h -1h = k k-1 ˛ K, h -1h ˛ K. \ h -1h ˛ H ∩ K = {e}.
1 1 1 1 \ h -1h = e, which implies that h = h .
1 1 Similarly, k k-1 = e, so that k =k.
1 1 Thus, the representation of x as product of an element of H and an element of K is unique.
c) The best way to show that two elements x and y commute is to show that their commutator z-1y-1 xy is identity.
So, let h ˛ H and k ˛ K and consider h-1k-1hk.
Since K D G, h-1k-1h ˛ K. \ h-1k-1hk ˛ K. by similar reasoning, h-1k-1hk ˛ H. \ h-1k-1hk ˛ H ˙ K = {e}.
\ h-1k-1hk = e, that is hk = kh.
Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 Let H and K be normal subgroups of G which satisfy (a) of Theorem 1.
Then show that G = HXK.
Now let us look at the relationship between internal direct products and quotient groups.
Theorem 2: Let H and K be normal subgroups of a group G such that 69MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS G = H X K. Then G/H ≃K and G/H ≃H.
Proof: We will use Theorem 8 of Unit 6 to prove this result.
Now G = HK and H∩ K = [e}.
Therefore, G/H – HK/H ≃K/H ∩ K = K/{e}≃K.
We can similarly prove that G/K ≃H.
We now give a result which immediately follows Theorem 2 and which will be used in Sec.
8.4.
Theorem 3: Let g be a finite group and H and K be its subgroups such that G = H X K. Then o(G) = o((H) o(K).
We leave the proof to you (see the following exercise).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Use Theorem 2 to prove Theorem 3.
And now let us discuss some basic results about the structure of any finite group.
3.4 Sylow Theorems In Unit 4 we proved Lagrange’s theorem, which says that the order of a subgroup of a finite group divides the order or the group.
We also said that if G is a finite cyclic group and m| o(G), then G has a subgroup of order m. But if G is not cyclic, this statement need not be true, as you have seen in the previous unit.
In this context, in 1845 the mathematician Cauchy proved the following useful result.
Theorem 4: If a prime p divides the order of a finite group G, then G contains an element of order p. The proof of this result involves a knowledge of group theory that is beyond the scope of this course.
Therefore, we omit it.
An immediate consequence of this result is the following Theorem 5: If a prime p divides the order of a finite group G, then g contains a subgroup or order p. Proof: Just take the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order p. This element exists because of Theorem 4.
70 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS So, by theorem 5 we know that any group of order 30 will have a subgroup of order 2, a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 5.
In 1872 Ludwig Sylow, a Norwegian mathematician, proved a remarkable extension of Cauchy’s result.
This result, called the first Sylow theorem, has turned out to be the basis of finite group theory.
Using this result we can say, for example, that any group of order 100 has subgroups of order 2, 4, 5 and 2 let us see what this powerful theorem is.
Theorem 6 (First Sylow Theorem): Let G be a finite group such that o(G) = pnm, where A prime, n ‡ 1 and (p, m) = 1.
Then G contains a subgroup of order p " k = 1, ….., n We shall not prove this result or the next two Sylow theorems either.
But, after stating all these results we shall show how useful they are.
The next theorem involves the concepts of conjugacy and Sylow p- subgroups which we now define.
Definition: Two subgroups H and K of a group G are conjugate in G if $ g ˛ G such that K= g-1Hg, and then K is called a conjugate of H in G. Can you do the following exercise now?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 Show that H D G iff the only conjugate of H in G is H itself.
Now we define Sylow p-subgroups.
Definition: Let G be a finite group and p be a prime such that pn | o(G) but pn+1 o(G), some n ≥ 1.
Then a subgroup of G of order pn is called a Sylow p-subgroup of G. So, if o(G) pnm, (p, m) = 1, then a subgroup of G of order pn is a Sylow p-subgroup.
Theorem 6 says that this subgroup always exists.
But, a group may have more than one Sylow p-subgroup.
The next result tells us how two Sylow p-subgroups of a group are related.
Theorem 7: (Second Sylow Theorem) Let G be a group such that o(G) = pnm, (p,m) = 1, p a prime.
Then any two Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate in G. And now let us see how many Sylow p-subgroups a group can have.
71MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Theorem 8: (Third Sylow Theorem): Let g be a group of order pnm, where (p, m) = 1 and p is a prime.
Then n the number of distinct Sylow p p-subgroups to G, is given by n = 1 + kp for some k ≥ 0.
And further, n p p | o(G).
We would like to make a remark about the actual use of Theorem 8.
Remark 3: Theorem 8 says that n ” 1 (mod p) (see Sec.
2.5.1).
\ (n p p pn) = 1. also, since n | o(G), using theorem 9 of Unit 1 we find that n | p p m. This fact helps us to cut down the possibilities for n , as you will see p in the following examples.
Example 1: show that any group of order 15 is cyclic.
Solution: let g be group pf order 15 = 3 X 5.
Theorem 6 says that G has a Sylow 3-subgroup.
Theorem 8 says that the number of such subgroups must divide 5 and must be congruent to 1 (Mod 3).
Thus, the only possibility is 1.
Therefore, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say H. Hence, by Theorem 7 and E 8 we know that H D G since H is of prime order, it is cyclic.
Similarly, we know that G has a subgroup of order 5. the total number of such subgroups is 1, 6 or 11 and must divide 3. thus, the only possibility is 1.
So G has a unique subgroup of order 5, say K. Then KD G and K is cyclic.
Now, let us look at H ∩ K. let x ˛ H ∩ K. Then x ˛ H and x ˛ K. \ o(x) | o(H) and o(x) |o(K) (by E 8 of Unit 4), i.e., o(x) | 3 and o(x) | 5.
\ o(x) = 1.
\ x = e. That is, H ∩ K = {e}.
Also, o(H)o(K) o(HK) = = 15 = o(G).
o(H˙ K) \ G = HK.
So, G = H X K ≃ Z X Z ≃Z , by E 5.
3 5 15 Example 2: Show that a group G of order 30 either has a normal subgroup of order 5 or a normal subgroup of order 3, i.e.
G is not simple.
A group G is called simple if its only normal subgroups are {e} and G itself.
Solution: Since 30 = 2 x 3 x 5, G has a sylow 2-subgroup, a Sylow 3- subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup.
The number of Sylow 5-subgroups is of the form 1 + 5k and divides 6 (by Remark 3).
Therefore, it can be 1 or 6. if it is 1, then the sylow 5-subgroup is normal in G. 72 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS On the other hand, suppose the number of Sylow 5-subgroup is 6.
Each of these subgroups are distinct cyclic groups of order 5, the only 5, the only common element being e. Thus, together they contain 24 + 1 = 25 elements of the group.
So, we are left with 5 elements of the group, which are of order 2 or 3.
Now, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups can be 1 or 10.
We can’t have 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, because we only have at most 5 elements of the group, which are of order 3. so, if the group has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, then it has only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup.
This will be normal in G. Try the following exercise now.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 9 Show that every group of order 20 has a proper normal non-trivial subgroup.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 10 Determine all the Sylow p-subgroups of Z24, where p varies over all the primes dividing 24.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 11 Show that a group G of order 255 (= 3 X 5 X 17) has either 1 or 51 Sylow 5-subgroups.
How many Sylow 3-subgroups can it have?
Now let us use the powerful Sylow theorem to classify groups of order 1 to 10.
In the process we will show you the algebraic structure of several types of finite groups.
3.5 Groups of Order 1 To 10 In this section we will apply the result of the previous section to study some finite groups.
In particular, we will list all the groups of order 1 to 10, onto isomorphism.
]We start with proving a very useful result.
Theorem 9: Let G be a group such that o(G) = pq, where p, q are primes such that p > q and q c p – 1.
Then G is cyclic.
Proof: Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup ad Q be a Sylow q-subgroup of G. Then o(P) = p and o(Q) = q.
Now, any group of prime order is cyclic, so P = <x> and Q = <y> for some x, y ˛ G. by the third Sylow theorem, the number n of subgroups of order p can be 1, 1 + p, 1 + 2p,…., and it p must divide q.
But p > q.
Therefore, the only possibility for n is 1. p 73MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Thus, there exists only one Sylow p-subgroup, i.e., P. Further, by Sylow’s second theorem PD G. Again, the number of distinct Sylow q-subgroups of G is n = 1 + k for p q some k, and n | p. Since p is a prime, its only factors are 1 and p. \ n = q q 1 or n = p. Now if 1 + k = p, then q | p – 1.
But we started by q q assuming that qc p – 1.
So we reach a contradiction.
Thus, n = 1 is q the only possibility.
Thus, the Sylow q-subgroup Q is normal in G. 7.
Let o(G) = p2, p a prime.
Then i) G is abelian.
ii) G is cyclic or G ≃Zp X Zp.

Since (x, y) ˛ K, x = e 2 1.

\ H K = {e , e )}.

1 2 1 2 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Let A = <x> and B = <y>, where o(x) = m, o(y) = n. Then A ≃Z and B ≃Z .
m n If we prove that Z X Z ≃Z .
Then we will have proved that A X B m n mn Z….
that is , A X B is cyclic of order mn.
So, let us prove that if (m, n) = 1, then Z Z X Z mn m n Define f: Z ﬁ Z X Z : f(r) = (r +mZ, r + nZ).
m n (Remember that Z, = Z/sZ, for any s ˛ N.) Now, f is a homomorphism because F(r + s) = ((r + s) + mZ, (r + s) + nZ) = (r + mZ, r + nZ) + (s + mZ, s + nZ).
= f(r) + f(s).
Ker f = {f˛ Z | r ˛ mZ ∩ nZ} = {r ˛ | r ˛ mnZ} mnZ.
Finally, we will show that f is surjective.
Now, kate any element (u + mZ, v + nZ) ˛ Z X Z .
Since (m, n) = 1, $ s, t ˛ Z such that m n ms + nt = 1 (see Sec.
1.6).
using this equation we see that f(u(1 – ms) + v(1 – nt)) = (u + mZ, v + nZ).
Thus, f is surjective.
75MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Now, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism and find that Z/Ker f ≃Im f, that is, Z/mnZ ≃Z X Z , that is, Z ≃ Z X Z .
m n mn m n \ A X B is cyclic of order mn.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 We know that each x ˛ G can expressed as hk, where h ˛ H and k ˛ K. \ G = HK.
We need to show that H ∩ K = {e}.
let x ˛ H ∩ K. Then x ˛ H and x ˛ K. \ xe ˛ HK and ex ˛ HK.
So, x has two representations, xe, as a product of an element of H and an element of K. but we have assume that each elemnt must have only on such representation.
So the two representations xe and ex must coincide, that is, X =e.
\ H ∩K = {e}.
\ G = H X K. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 G = H X K ⇒ G/H ≃K ⇒o(G/H) = o(K) ⇒ o(G)/o(H) = o(K).
⇒ o(G) = o(H) o(K).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 HD G (cid:219) g-1Hg = H " g ˛ G (cid:219) the only conjugate of H in G is H. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Let G e a group of order 20.
Since 20 = 2 X 5, G has a Sylow 5 2 subgroup.
The number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 (mod 5) and divides 4.
Thus, the number is 1.
Therefore, the Sylow 5-subgroup of G is normal in G, and is the required subgroup.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 o(Z ) = 24 = 23 X 3.
24 \ Z has a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgoup.
The number of 24 Sylow 2-subgroups is 1 or 3 and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1 or 4.
Now, if Z has only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, this account for 8 24 elements of the group.
So, we are left with 16 elements of order 3.
But this is not possible because we can only have at most 4 distinct Sylow 3- subgroups (i.e., 8 elements of order 3).
So, we reach a contradiction.
\ Z must have 3 Sylow 2-subgroups.
And then it will have only 1 24 Sylow 3-subgroup.
These are all the Sylow p-subgroups of Z .
24 76 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 255 = 5 X 5 X 17 = 5 X 51.
The number of Sylow 5-subgroups is congruent to 1(mod 5) and must divide 51.
Thus, it is 1 or 51.
Since 255 = 3 X 85, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups that g can have is congruent to 1 (mod 3) and must divide 85.
Thus, it is 1 or 85.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 We can apply Theorem 10 here.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 apply Theorem 12, we see that i) o(G) = 4 ⇒ G ≃ Z or G ≃Z X Z .
4 2 2 ii) o(G) = 9 ⇒ G ≃Z or G ≃Z X Z .

Z, Q and R are examples of such a system, which we shall call a ring.
Now, you know that both addition and multiplication are binary operations on Z.
Further, Z is an abelian group under addition.
Though it is not a group under multiplication, multiplication is associative.
Also, addition and multiplication are related by the distributive laws.
a(b+c) = ab + ac, and )a +b) c = ac + bc For all integers a, b and c. We generalize these very properties of the binary operations to define a ring in general.
This definition is due to the famous algebraist Emmy Noether.
After defining rings we shall give several examples of rings.
We shall also give some properties of rings that follow from the definition itself.
Finally, we shall discuss certain types of rings that are obtained when we impose more restrictions on the “multiplication” in the ring.
As the contents suggest, this unit lays the foundation for the rest of this course.
So make sure that you have attained the following objectives before going to the next unit.
79MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit, you should be able to • Define and give examples of rings • Derive some elementary properties of rings from the defining axioms of a ring; • Define and give examples of commutative rings, rings with identity and commutative ring with identity.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What is a Ring?
You are familiar with Z, the set of integers.
You also know that it is a group with respect to addition.
Is it a group with respect to multiplication too?
No.
But multiplication is associative and distributive over addition.
These properties of addition and multiplication of integers allow us to say that the system (Z, +, .)
is a ring.
But, what do we mean by a ring?
Definition: A non-empty set R together with two binary operations, usually called addition (denoted by +) and multiplication (denoted by .
), is called a ring if the following axioms are satisfy: R 1) a + b = b + a for all a, b in R, i.e., addition is commutative.
R 2) (a + b) + c = a+ (b + c) for all a, b, e in R, i.e., addition is associative R 3) There exists and element (denoted by 0) of R such that a + 0 = a = 0 + a for all a in R, i.e., R has an additive identity.
R 4) For each a in R, there exists x in R such that a + x = 0 = x + a, i.e., every element of R has an additive inverse.
R5) (a .b).c = a.
(b.c) for all a, b, c in R, i.e., multiplication is associative.
R 6) a.
( + c) = a. b + a .
c, and (a + b).c = a.c + .bc for all a, b, c in R, i.e., multiplication distributive over addition from the left as well as the right.
The axioms R1 R4 say that (R, +) is an abelian group.
The axiom R5 says that multiplication is associative.
Hence, we can say that the system (R +,.)
is a ring if i) (R, +) is an abelian group, ii) (R,.)
is a semigroup, and 80 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS iii) For all a,b, c in R, a.
(b + c) = a .
b + a .c and (a + b).c = a. c + b c. From MTH 211, you know that the addition identity 0 is unique, and each element a of R has a unique additive inverse (denoted by – a).
We call the element 0 the zero element of the ring.
By convention, we write a – b for a + ( - b).
Let us look at some examples of ring now.
You have already seen that Z is a ring.
What about the sets Q and R?
Do (Q, +,.)
and (R, +, .)
satisfy the axioms R1=R6?
They do.
Therefore, these systems are rings.
The following examples provide us with another set of examples of rings.
Example 1: Show that (nZ, +, .)
is a ring, were n ˛ Z.
Solution: You know that nZ = {nm | m ˛ Z} is an abelian group with respect to addition.
You also know that multiplication in nZ is associative and distributes over addition from the right as well as the left.
Thus, nZ is a ring under the usual addition and multiplication.
So far the examples that we have considered have been infinite rings, that is, their underlying sets have been infinite sets.
Now let us look at a finite ring, that is a ring (R, +, .)
where R is a finite set.
Our example is the set Z that you studied in earlier .Let us briefly recall the n construction of Z , the set of residue classes of modulo n. n If a and b are integers, we say that a is congruent to b modulo n if a- b is divisible by n, in symbols, a ≡ b (mod n) if n | (a – b).
The relation ‘congruence modulo n’ is an equivalence relation in Z.
The equivalence class containing the integer a is a = {b ˛ Z | a – b is divisible by n} = {a + mn | m ˛ }.
It is called the congruence class of a modulo n or the residue class of a modulo n. The set of all equialence classes is denote by Z .
So { n } Z = 0,1,2,....,n- 1 .
n We define addition and multiplication of classes in terms of their representative by a+b =a+b and a.b =ab " a,b˛ Z .
n 81MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Earlier in our algebra course, you have seen that these operations are well defined in Z to the help you regain some practice in adding and n, multiplying in Z consider the following Cayley table for Z .
n, n + 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 0 1 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 0 1 0 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 0 1 2 0 2 4 1 3 3 3 4 0 1 2 3 0 3 1 4 2 4 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 4 3 2 1 Now let us go back to looking for a finite ring.
Example 2: Show that (Z ,+) is a ring n Solution: You already know that (Z +) is an abelian group, and that n multiplication is associative in Z .
Now we need to see if the axiom R6 n is satisfied.
For any a,b,c˛ Z , a.(b+c)=a.
(b+c)=a.b+a.c=a.b+a.c=a.b+a.c n Thus, a.
(b+c) =a.b+a.c.
Similarly, (a+b).c = a.c+b.c " a,b,c˛ Z .
n So, (Z + ,.)
satisfies the axioms R1 – R6.
therefore, it is a ring.
n Try this exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 Write out the Cayley tables for addition and multiplication in Z* , the set 6 of non-zero elements of Z .
Is (Z *, +, .)
a ring?
Why?
6 6 Now let us look at a ring whose underlying set is a subset of C. Example 3: Consider the set Z + iZ = {m + in | m and n are integers }, where i2 = -1.
We define ‘+’ and ‘.’ in Z + iZ to be the usual addition and multiplication of complex numbers.
Thus, for m+ in and s + it in Z+iZ, (m+in) + (s + it) = (m + s) + I(n + t), and (m + in .
(s + it) = (ms – nt) + I(mt + ns).
82 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Verify that Z + iZ is a ring under this addition and multiplication.
(This ring is called the ring of Gaussian integers, after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.)
Solution: Check that (Z + iZ +) is a subgroup of (C, +).
Thus, the axioms R1 – R4 are satisfied.
You can also check that ((a + ib) .
(c + id)) .
(m + in) = (a + ib) .
((c + id) .
(m + in)) " a + ib, c + id, m + in ˛ Z + iZ.
This shows tha R5 is also satisfied.
Finally, you can check that the right distributive law holds, i.e., ((a + ib) + (c + id)).
(m + in) = (a + ib) .
(m + in) + (c + id) .
(m + in) for any a + ib, c + id, m + in ˛ Z + iZ.
Similarly, you can check that the left distributive law holds.
Thus, (Z+iZ, + , .)
is a ring.
The next example is related to example 8 of unit 2.
The operations that we consider in it are not the usual addition and multiplication.
Example 4: Let X be a non-empty set,ˆ (X) be the collection of all subsets of X and D denote the symmetric difference operation.
Show that (ˆ (X), D , ˙ ) is a ring.
Solution: for any two subsets A and B of X, A D B = (A\B) ¨ (B\A) In example 8 of unit 2 we showed that (ˆ (X), D ) is an abelian group.
You also know that ˙ is associative.
Now let us see if ˙ distributes over D .. Let A, B, C ˛ˆ (X).
Then A ˙ (B D C) = A ˙ [(B\C) ¨ (C\B)] = [A ˙ (B\C)] ¨ [A ˙ (C\B)], since ˙ distributes over ¨ .
= [(A ˙ B)\(A ˙ C)\(A ˙ B)], since ˙ distributes over complementation.
= (A˙ B) D (A ˙ C).
So the left distributive law holds.
So, (B D C) ˙ A = A˙ (B D C), since ˙ is commutative.
=(A ˙ B) D (A ˙ C) = (B ˙ A) D (C ˙ A) 83MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Therefore, the right distributive law holds also.
Therefore, (ˆ (X) D , ˙ ) is a ring.
So far you have examples of rings in which both the operations define on the ring have been commutative.
This is not so in the next example.
Example 5: Consider the set a a   M2(R) =  11 12 a11, a12,a21 and a22 are real numbers  a a   21 22 Show that M (R) is a ring with respect to addition and multiplication of 2 matrices.
Solution: Just as we have solved Example 2 of Unit 3,of MTH 211. you can check that (M (R) ) is an abelian group.
You can also verify the 2 associative property for multiplication.
(Also see example 5 of Unit 2.ofMTH 211) we now show that A.
(B+C) = A.B + A.C for A,B,C in M (R) .

In the same way we can obtain the other distributive law, i.e.
(A + B).
C = A.C + B.C " A. B,B ˛ M (R).
2 Thus, M (R) is a ring under matrix addition and multiplication.
2 84 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Note that multiplication over M (R) is not commutative so, we can’t say 2 that the left distributive law implies the right distributive law in this case.
Try the following exercises now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Show that the set Q + 2Q ={p+ 2q |p,q˛ Q}is a ring with respect to addition and multiplication of real numbers.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 a 0  Let R =   a, b are real numbers .

Prove that R is a ring under 0 b  matrix addition and multiplication.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Why is (ˆ (X),¨ , ˙ ) not a ring?
Let us now look at ring whose elements are functions.
Example 6: Consider the class of all continuous real valued functions defined on the closed interval [0, 1].
We denote this by C[0, 1].
If f and g are continuous functions on [0, 1].
We define f + g and fg as (f + g) (x).
= f(x) + g(x) (i.e., pointwise addition) and (f.g) (x) = f(x).
g(x) (i.e., pointwise multiplication) for every x ˛ [0, 1].
From the calculus course you know that the function f + g and fg are defined and continuous on[0, 1], i.e., if f and g ˛ C[0, 1], then f + g and f.g are in C[0, 1].
Show that C[0, 1] is a ring with respect + and .
Solution: Since addition in R is associative and commutative, so is addition in C[0, 1].
The additive identity of C[0, 1] is the zero function.
The additive inverse of f ˛ C[0, 1] is (- f), where (- f)(x) = -f(x) " x ˛ [0, 1].
See fig.
2 for a visual interpretation of (- f).
Thus, )C[0, 1], +) is an abelian group.
Again, since multiplication in R is associative, so is multiplication in C[0, 1].
85MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Y f O 1,0 X -f Fig.
2 The graphs of f and (-1) over [0,1].
Now let us see if the axiom R6 holds.
To prove f.(g +h) = f.g + f.h, we consider (f .
(g + h)) (x) for any x in [0,1].
Now (f.(g +h)) (x) = f(x) (g + h) (x) = f(x) (g(x) + h(x)) = f(x) g(x) + f(x) h(x), since distributes one + in R = (f.g) (x) + (f.h) (x) = (f.g) (x) + (f.h) (x) = (f.g + f.h)(x) Hence, f.(g + h) = f.g + f.h.
Since multiplication is commutative in C[0, 1], the other distributive law also holds.
Thus, R6 is true for C[0, 1].
Therefore, (C[0, 1], +, .)
is a ring.
This ring is called the ring of continuous functions on [0, 1].
The next example also deals with functions.
Example 7: Let (A, +) be an abelian group.
The set of all endomorphisms of A is End A = {f:A – A\ f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) " a,b ˛ A} For f,g ˛ End A, we define f + g and f.g as (f + g) (a) = f(a) + g(a), and  (f.g) (a) = fog(a) = f(g(a)) " a ˛ A  ….
(1)  Show that (End A, +, .)
is a ring.
(This ring is called the endomorphism ring of A.)
Solution: Let us first check that + and .
defined by (1) are binary operations on End A For all a, b, ˛ A, (f + g) (a + b) = f(a + b) + g(a +b) 86 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS = (f(a) + f(b)) + (g(a) + g(b)) = (f(a) + g(a)) + (f(b) + g(b)) (f + g) (a) + (f + g) (b), and (f.g) (a + b) = f(g(a + b)) = f(g(a) + g(b)) = f(g(a)) + f(g(b)) = (f.g) (a) + (f.g) (b) Thus, f + g and f.g ˛ End A.
Now let us see if (End A, +,.)
satisfies R1 = R6.
Since + in the abelian group A is associative and commutative, so is + in End A.
The zero homomorphism on A is the aero element in End A.
(- f) is the additive inverse of f ˛ End A.
Thus, (End A, +) is an abelian group.
You also know, that the composition of functions is an associative operation in End A.
Finally, to check R6 we look at f.(g + h) for any f,g,h ˛ End A.
Now for any a ˛ A, [f.(g + h(] (a) = f((g + h) (a)) =f(g(a) + h(a)) =f(g(a) + f(h(a)) = (f.g) (a) + (f.h) (a) = (f.g + f.h) (a) \ f.(g + h) = f.g + f.h.
We can similarly prove that (f + g).h = f.h + g.h.
Thus, R1 = R6 are true for End A.
Hence, (End A, +,.)
is ring.
Note that is not commutative since fog need not be equal to gof for f, g ˛ End A.
You may like to try these exercises now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 Let X be a non-empty set and (R, +,.)
be any ring.
Define the set Map(X,R) to be the set of all functions from X to R. That is Map (X, R) = {f| f:X ﬁ R}.
Define + and .
in Map (X, R) by pointwise addition and multiplication.
Show that (Map (X, R), +,.)
is a ring.
87MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Show that the set R of real numbers is a ring under addition and multiplication given by a ¯ b = +b +1, and a (cid:3692)b = a.b + a+ b For all a,b˛ R, where + and .denote the usual addition and multiplication of real numbers.
On solving Exercise 7 you must have realized that a given set can be an underlying set of many different rings.
Now, let us look at the Cartesian product of rings.
Example 8: Let (A, +,.)
and (B, + , . )
be two rings.
Show that their Cartesian product AX B is a ring with respect to ¯ and * defined by (a, b)¯ (a¢,b¢ ) = (a + a¢ , b + b¢ ) and (a, b) * (a¢,b¢ ) = (a.a¢,b .
, b¢ ) for all (a,b), (a¢,b¢ ) in A X B.
Solution: we have defined the addition and multiplication in A X B componentwise.
The zero element of A X B is (0, 0).
The additive inverse of (a, b) is ( - a, - b), where - b denotes the inverse of b with respect to + Since the multiplication in A and B are associative, * is associative in A X B.
Again, using in fact that R6 holds for A and B, we can show that R6 holds for A X B.
Thus, (A X B, ¯ ,* ) is a ring.
If you have understood this example, you will be able to do the next exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 Write down the addition and multiplication tables for Z X Z 2 3.
Before going further we would like to make a remark about notational conventions in the case of groups, we decided to use the notation G for (G, * ) for convenience.
Here too, in future, we shall use the notation R for (R, +,.)
for convenience.
Thus, we shall assume that + and .
are known.
We shall also denote the product of two ring element a and b by ab instead of a.b.
So now let us begin studying various properties of rings.
88 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3.2 Elementary Properties In this section we will prove some simple but important proterties of ring which are immediate consequences of the definition of a ring.
As we go along you must not forget that for any ring R, (R, +) is an abelian group.
Hence the results obtained for groups in the earlier units are applicable to the abelian group (R, +).
In particular, i) The zero element, 0, and the additive inverse of any element is unique.
ii) The cancellation law holds for addition, i.e., " a, b, c ˛ R, a + c = b + c ⇒ a = b.
As we have mention earlier, we will write a – b for a + (- b) and ab for a.b, where a, b ˛ R. So let us state some properties which follow from the axiom R6, mainly.
Theorem 1: Let R be a ring.
Then, for any a, b, c ˛ R, i) a0 = 0 = 0a, ii) a(- b) = ( – a)b = - (ab), iii) ( - a) (- b) = ab, iv) a(b –c) = ab – ac, and (b – c) = ba – ca.
Proof: i) Now, 0 + 0 = 0 ⇒ a(0+0) = a0 ⇒ a0 + a0 = a0, applying the distributive law.
= a0 + 0, since 0 is the additive identity.
⇒ a0 = 0, by the cancellation law for (R, +).
Using the other distributive law, we can similarly show that 0a = 0 Thus, a0 = 0 = 0a for all a ˛ R. ii) From the definition of additive inverse, we know that b +(- b) =0.
Now, 0 = a0, from (i) above.
= a(b + ( - b)), as 0 = b + (- b) .
= ab + a( - b), by distributivity.
Now, ab + [- (ab)] = 0 and ab + a(- b) = 0. but you know that the additive inverse of an element is unique.
Hence, we get – (ab) = a( - b).
In the same manner, using the fact that a + ( - a) = 0, we get – (ab) = (-a(b.
89MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Thus, a(- b) = - (- a)b = -(ab) for all a, b ˛ R. iii) for a, b ˛ R, (- a) (- b) = -(a(- b)), from (ii) above.
= a(- (- b)), from distributivity.
= ab, since b is the additive inverse of ( - b).
iv) for a, b, c ˛ R, a(b – c) = a(b +( - c)) = ab + a( - c), by distributivity = ab + (- (ac)), from (ii) above.
= ab – ac.
We can similarly prove (v).
Try this exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Show that {0} is a ring with respect to the usual addition and multiplication.
( This is called the trivial ring.)
Also show that if any singleton is a ring, the singleton must be {0}.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 Prove that the only ring R in which the two operations are equal (i.e., a + b = ab " a, b ˛ R) is the trivial ring.
Now let us look at the sum and the product of three or more elements of a ring.
We define them recursively, as we did in the case of groups (see Unit 2 MTH 211 ).
If k is an integer (k ‡ 2) such that the sum of k elements in a ring R is defined, we define the sum of (k + 1) elements a , a , …, a in R, taken 1 2 k+1 in that order, as + … + a = (a a k).a .
k+1 1 2 … a k+1 In the same way if k is a positive integer such that the product of k elements in R is defined, we define the product of (k + 1) elements of a , a , …, a (taken in that order) as 1 2 k+1 a .
…a = (a a …a ).a .
2 k+1 1 2 k a+1 As we did for groups, we can obtain laws of indices in the case of ring also with respect to both + and ,.
In fact, we have the following results for any ring R. 90 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS If m and n are positive integers and a ˛ R, then i) am .an = am+n, and (am)n = amn.
ii) If m and n are arbitrary integers and a, b ˛ R, then (n + m)a = na + ma, (nm)a = n(ma) = m(na), n(a + b) = na + nb, m(ab) = (ma)b = a(mb), and (ma) (nb) = mn (ab) = (mna)b. iii) If a a , …, a b , …, b ˛ R then 1, 2 m 1 n a( + … + a (b + … + b ) 1 m) 1 n = a b + … + a b + a b + … + a b + … + a b + … + a b .
1 1 1 n 2 1 2 n m 1 m n Try this simple exercise now SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 If R is a ring and a, b ˛ r such that ab =ba, then use induction on n ˛ N to derive the binomial expansion.
(a + b)n = an + nC an-1b + … + nC an-kbk + … + nC abn-1 + bn, 1 k n-1 where nC = k There are several other properties of rings tat we will be discussing throughout this block.
For now let us look closely at two types of rings, which are classified according to the behaviour of the multiplication defined on them.
3.3 Two Types of Rings The definition of a ring guarantees that the binary operation multiplication is associative and, along with +, satisfies the distribitive laws.
Nothing more is said about the properties of multiplication.
If we place restrictions on this operation we get several types of rings.
Let us introduce you to two of them now.
Definition: We say that a ring (R, +,.)
is commutative if.
, i.e.it if ab = ba for all a, b ˛ R. For example, Z, Q and R are commutative rings.
Definition: We say that a ring (R, +,.)
is a ring with identity (orwith unity) if R has an identity element with respect to multiplication, i.e., if there exists an element e in R such that 91MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS ae = ea = a for all a ˛ R. Can you think of such a ring?
Aren’t Z, Q and R examples of a ring with identity?
Try this quickly before we go to our next definition.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 Prove that if a ring R has an identity element with respect to multiplication, then it is unique.
(We denote this unique identity element in a ring with identity by the symbol 1.)
Now let us combine the previous two definitions.
Definition: We say that a ring (R, +,.)
is a commutative ring with unity, if it is a commutative ring and has the multiplicative identity element 1.
Thus, the rings Z, Q, R and C are all commutative rings with unity.
The integer 1 is the multiplication identity in all these rings.
We can also find commutative rings which are not rings with identity.
For example, 2Z, the ring of all even integers is commutative.
But it has no multiplicative identity.
Similarly, we can find rings with identity which are not commutative.
For example, M (R) 2 1 0 has the unit-element  .
0 1 But it is not commutative.
For instance, 1 0 0 1 If A =  and B =  , then 2 0 0 2 1 00 1 0 10 AB =    =  and 2 00 2 2  0 11 0 2 0 BA =    =   0 22 0 4 0 Thus, AB „ BA Try this exercise now.
92 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 Which of the rings in Example 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 are commutative and which have unity?
Give the identity, whenever it exists.
Now, can the trivial ring be a ring with identity?
Since 0.0 = 0, 0 is also the multiplicative identity for this ring.
So ({0}, +,.)
is a ring with identity in which the additive and multiplicative identities coincide.
But, if r is not the trivial ring we have the following result.
Theorem 2: Let R be a ring with identity 1.
If R „ {0} then the elements 0 and 1 are distinct.
Proof: Since R „ {0}, $ a˛ R, a „ 0.
Now suppose 0 = 1.
Then a = a.
1 = a.0 = 0 (by Theorem 1).
That is, a = 0, a contradiction.
Thus, our supposition is wrong.
That is, 0 „ 1.
Now let us go back to example 8.
When will A X B be commutative?
A X B is commutative if and only if both the rings A and B are commutative.
Let us see why.
For convenience we will denote the operations in all three rings A, B and A X B by + and .. Let (a, b) and (a¢b¢ ) ˛ A X B.
Then (a, b) .
(a¢b¢ ) = (a¢b¢ ) .
(a, b) (cid:219) (a.a¢,b.b¢) =(a¢,b¢).
(a,b) (cid:219) a.a¢ = a¢ .a and b.b¢ = b¢ .b.
Thus, A X B is commutative iff both A and B are commutative rings.
We can similarly show that A X B is with unity iff A and B are with unity.
If A and B have identities e and e respectively, then the identity 1 2 of AXB is (e 2).
1 e Now for some exercises about commutative rings with identity.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 14 Show that the ring in E7 is a commutative ring with identity .
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 x x  Show that the set of matrices  x˛ R is a commutative with x x  unity.
93MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 16 Let R be a Boolean ring (i.e., a2 = a" a ˛ R).
show that a = - a" a ˛ R. Hence show that R must be commutative.
Now we will give an important example of a non-commutative ring with identity.
This is the ring of real quaternions.
It was first described by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamillion (1805 – 1865).
It plays an important role in geometry, number theory and the study of mechanics.
Example 9: Let H = {a + bi + cj + dk | a,b, c, d˛ R}, where i,j, k are symbols the satisfy 12 = - 1 = j2 = k2, ij = k = - ji, jk = I = - kj, ki = j = - ik.
We define addition and multiplication in H by + bi + cj + dk) + ( a + b i + cj + d k) 1 1 1 (a + a ) + (b + b )i + (c + c )j + (d + d )k, and 1 1 1 1 ( + bi + cj + dk) (a + b j + c j + d k) = (aa – bb – cc dd ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (ab + 1 + cd – dc )+ (ac +bd + ac + bd1)j + (ad + bc – cb + da )k. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 This multiplication may .
But it is no so, it is simply performed as for keeping the relationship between i, j and k in mind) Solution: Note that {– 1, – i, – j, – k .}
is the group Q (Example 4, 8 Unit 4).
Now, you can verify that (H, +) is an abelian group in which the additive identity is 0 = 0 + 0i + 0j + 0k, multiplication in H is associative, the distributive laws hold and 1 = 1 + 0i + 0j + 0k is the unity in H. Do you agree that H is not a commutative ring?
You will if you remember that ij ≠ ji, for example.
4.0 CONCLUSION So far, in this unit we have discussed various types of rings.
We have seen examples of commutative and non-commutatve rings.
Though non-commutative rings are very important, for the sake of simplicity we shall only deal with commutative rings henceforth.
Thus, from now on, for us a ring will always mean a commutative ring.
We would like you to remember that both + and .
are commutative in a commutative ring.

Thus, (Z*, + , .)

6 6 6 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 We define addition and multiplication in Q + 2Q by (a + 2b)+(c+ 2d) =(a+c)+ 2(b+d),amd (a + 2b).
(c+ 2d) = (ac+2bd)+ 2(ad+bc) " a, b, c, d ˛ Q.
Since + is associative and commutative I n R, the same holds for + in 95MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Q + 2Q.0 = 0+ 2.0 is the additive identity and ( - a) + 2(- b) is the additive inverse of a + 2b.
Since multiplication in r is associative, R5 holds also.
Since multiplication distributes over addition in R, it does so in Q + 2Q as well Thus, (Q + 2Q,+,.
)is a ring.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 + and are well defined binary operations on R.R1, R2, R5 and R6 hold since the same properties are true for M (R) (Example 5).

SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 + and.
Are binary operations on r. you can check that (R, +,.)
satisfies R1 – R6.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 ¨ and ˙ are well defined binary operations on ˆ (x).
let us check which of the axioms R1-R6 is not satisfied by (ˆ (X), ¨ , ˙ ).
Since ¨ us abelian, R1 is satisfied.
Since ¨ is associative, R2 is satisfied.
Also, for any A ˝ X, A ¨ ø = A. thus, ø is the identity with respect to ¨ .
Thus, R3 is satisfied.
Now, for any A ˝ X, A ≠ ø, there is no B ˝ X such that A ¨ B = ø.
Thus R4 is not satisfied.
Hence (ˆ (X), ¨ , ˙ ) is not a ring.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 Since satisfies R1, R2, R5 and R6, so does Map (X,R).
the zero element is 0: X → R: )(x) = 0.
The additive inverse of f: X→R is (-f) : X → R. Thus, (Map (X, R,), +,.)
is a ring.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Firstly, ¯ and (cid:3692) are well defined binary operations on R. Next, let us check if (R, ¯ ,(cid:3692))satisfies R1-R6" a, b, c ˛ R. 96 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS R1: (a ¯ b = a + B + 1 = b + a + 1 = b ¯ a. R2: (a ¯ b) ¯ c = (a + b + 1) ¯ c = a + b + 1 + c + 1 = a + (b + c + 1) + 1 = a ¯ (b ¯ c) R3: a¯ (- 1) = a -1 + 1 = a " a ˛ R. Thus, ( -1) is the identity with respect to ¯ R4: a ¯ (-1 -2) = a+ (- a -2) + 1 = -1.
Thus, -a -2 is the inverse pf a with respect to ¯ .
R5: (a (cid:3692)b) (cid:3692)c = (ab + a + b) (cid:3692) c = (ab+ a + b)c + (ab + a + b) +c = a(bc + b + c) + a + (bc + b + c) = a (cid:3692) (b (cid:3692)v).
R6: a (b ¯ c) = a (cid:3692)(b +c+1) = a (b+c+1) +a +(b+c+1) = (ab +a+b) + (ac+a+c) + 1 = (a (cid:3692)b) ¯ (a (cid:3692)c).
Thus, (R, ¯ , (cid:3692)) is a ring.

We start with the notion of a subring, which corresponds to that of a subgroup as you may have guessed already.
Then we take a close look at a special kind of subgring, called an ideal.
You will see that the ideals in a ring play the role of normal subgroups in a group.
That is, they help us to define a notion in ring theory corresponding to that of a quotient group, namely, a quotient ring.
After defining quotient rings, we will look at several examples of such rings.
But you will only be able to realize the importance of quotient rings in the future units.
We hope that you will be able to meet the following objectives of this unit, because only then will you be comfortable in the future unit of this course.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you should be able to • give examples of subgrings and ideals of some familiar rings; • check whether a subset of a ring is a subgring or not; • check whether a subset of a ring is an ideal or not; • define and give examples of quotient ring.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 101MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3.1 Subrings In Unit 3 of MTH 211, we introduced you to the concept of subgroups of a group.
In this section we will introduce you to an analogous notion for rings.
Remember that for us a ring means a commutatiove ring.
In the previous unit you saw that, not only is Z ˝ Q, but Z and Q are rings with respect to the same operations.
This shows that Z is a subring of Q, as you will now realize.
Definition: Let (R +,.)
be a ring and S be subset of R. We say that S is a subring of R, if (S +,.)
is itself a ring, i.e., S is a ring with respect to the operations on R. For example, using Example 1 unit 1 of this module we can say that 2Z, the set of even integers, is a subring of Z.
Before giving more examples, let us analyse the definition of a subring.
The definition says that a subring of a ring R is a ring will respect to the operations on R, Now, the distributive commutative and associative laws hold good in R. Therefore, they hold good in any subset of R also.
So, to prove that a subset S of R is a ring we don’t need to check all the 6 axioms R1-R6 for S. It is enough to check that i) S is closed under both + and., ii) 0˛ S, and iii) for each a ˛ S, - a ˛ S. If S satisfies these three conditions, then S is a subring of R. so we have an alternative definition for subring.
Definition: Let S be a subset of a ring (R, + ,.).
S is called a subring of R if i) S is closed under + and .
, i.e., a + b, a.b ˛ S whenever a, b ˛ S, ii) 0˛ S, and iii) for each a ˛ S, - a ˛ S. Even this definition can be improved upon.
For this recall from Unit 3 of MTH 211, that (S; +) £ (R, +) if a – b ˛ S whenever a, b ˛ S. This observation allow us to give a set of conditions for a subset to be a subring, which are easy to verify.
Theorem 1: Let S be a non-empty subset of (R, +,.).
Then S is a subring of R if only if a) x – y ˛ S" x, y˛ S; and 102 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS b) xy ˛ S " x, y ˛ S. Proof: We need to show that S is a subring of R according to our definition iff satisfies (a) and (b).
now S is a subring of R iff(S, +)£ (R,+) and S is closed under multiplication, i.e.
if (a) and (b) hold.
So, we have proved the theorem.
This theorem allows us a neat way of showing that a subnset is a subring.. Let us look at some exmples.
We have already noted that Z is a subring of Q.
In fact, you can use Theorem 1 to check that Z is subring of R, C and Z + iZ too.
You can also verify that Q is a subring of R, C and Q + 2Q = {α+ 2β|α,β˛ Q}.
The following exercise will give you some more examples of subrings.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 Show that R is a subring of C, Z + iZ is a subring of C and Q + 2Q is a subring of R. Now, let us look at some examples of subring other than the sets of numbers.
Example 1:Consider Z , the ring of integers modulo 6. show, that 3Z = 6 6 {3.0, 3.1……, 3.5} is a subring of Z 6 - - - Solution: firstly, do you agree that 3Z = {0,3}?
Remember that 6 = 6 - - 0,9 = 3, and so on.
- - - - Also, 0- 3= - 3=3.Thus, x – y ˛ 3Z is a subring of Z .
6 6 Example 2: Consider the ring ˆ (X) given in Example 4 if unit 1 of this module .
show that S = {ø, X} is a subring of ˆ (X).
Solution: Note that AD A = ø" A ˛ ˆ (X).
\ A = - A in ˆ (X).
Now to apply theorem 1 we first note that S is non-empty.
Next, ø D ø = ø˛ S, X D X = ø˛ S, ø D X = X˛ S, ø ˙ ø = ø ˛ S, X ˙ X = X˛ S, ø X = ø˛ S. Thus, by Theorem 1 , S is a subring of ˆ (X).

SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Let A ˝ X, A ≠ ø.
Show that S = {ø, A, Ac, X} is a subring of ˆ (X).
E 2 shows that for each proper subset of X we get a subring of ˆ (X).
Thus, a ring can have several subrings.
Let us consider two subrings of the ring Z2.
Example 3: show that S = {n, 0}|n˛ Z} is a subring of Z X Z.
Also show that D = {(n, n) | n ˛ Z} is a subring of Z X Z.
Solution: You can recall the ring structure of Z2 from example 8 of unit 1.
Both S and D are non-empty.
Both of them satisfy (a) and (b) of Theorem 1.
Thus, S and D are both subrings of Z2.
We would like to make a remark here which is based on the examples of subrings that you have seen so far.
Remark: i) If R is a ring with identity, a subring of R may or may not be with identity.
For example, the ring Z has identity 1, but its subring nZ (n ‡ 2) is without identity.
ii) The identity of a subring, if it exists, may not coincide with the identity of the ring.
For example, the identity of the ring Z X Z is (1, 1).
But the identity of its subring Z X {0} is (1.0).
Try the following exercise now.

Does S have a unit element?
0 b  If yes, then is the unit element the same as that of R?
Now let us look at an example which throws up several subrings of any ring.
Example 4: Let R be a ring and a ˛ R. Show that the set aR = { ax | x ˛ R} is a subring of R. 104 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Solution: Since R „ ø, aR „ ø.
Now, for any two elements ax and ay of aR, Ax – ay = a(x- y) ˛ aR and (ax) (ay) = a(xay) ˛ aR.
Thus, by Theorem 1, aR is a subring of R. - Using Example 4 we can immediately say that mZ is a subring of Z n n - " m˛ Z .
This also shows us a fact that we have already seen: nZ is a n subring of Z " n˛ Z .

SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 For any ring R, show that {0} and R are its subrings.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Show that if A is a subring of B and B is a subring of C, then A is a subring of C. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 Give an example of a subset of Z which is not a subring.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Is very useful.
For instance, E1 and E5 tell us that Q + 2Q is a subring of C. Now let us look at some properties of subrings.
From unit 3 you know that the intersection of two or more subgroup is a subgroup.
The following result says that the same is true for subrings.
Theorem 2: Let S and S be subring of a ring R. Then S ˙ S is also a 1 2 1 2 subring of R. Proof: Since 0˛ S and 0 ˛ S , 0 ˛ S ˙ S .
\ S ˙ S „ ø.
1 2 1 2 1 2 Now, let X, y ˛ S ˙ S .
Then x, y˛ S and z, y ˛ S .
thus, by Theorem 1 2 1 2 1, x – y and xy are in S as well as in S , they lie in S ˙ S .
1 2 1 2 Thus, S ˙ S is a subring of R. 1 2 On the same lines as the proof above we can prove that the intersection of any family of subring of a ring R is a subring of R. 105MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Now consider the union of subrings of a ring.
So you think it will be a subring?
Consider the following exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 You know that Z + iZ and Q are subrings of C. Is their union a subring of C?
why?
Now let us look at the Cartesian product of subrings.
Theorem 3: Let S and S be subring of the rings R and S , respectively.
1 2 1 2 Then S X S is a subring of R X R .
1 2 1 2 Proof: since S and S are subrings of R and R , S „ ø and S „ ø.
\ S 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 X S „ ø.
2 Now, let (a, b) and (a¢,b¢ )˛ S X S .
Then a, a¢ ˛ S and b, b¢ ˛ S .
As S 1 2 1 2 1 and S are subrings, a = a¢ , a. a¢ ˛ S and b - b¢ , b. b¢ ˛ S .
2 1 2 (WE are using + and .
for both R and R2 here, for convenience.)
Hence, 1 (a, b) – (a¢,b¢ ) = (a - a¢ ,b - b¢ ) ˛ S X S , and 1 2 (a,b) .
(a¢,b¢ ) - aa¢ ,bb¢ ) ˛ S X S .
1 2 You can use this result to solve the following exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Obtain two proper non-trivial subrings of Z X R (i.e., subrings which are neither zero nor the whole ring).
Let us now discuss an important class of subrings.
3.2 Ideals In Module 1, you studied normal subgroups and the role that they play in group theory.
You saw that the most important reason for the existence of normal subgroups is that they allow us to define quotient groups.
In ring theory we would like to define a similar concept a quotient ring.
In this section we will discuss a class of subrings that will help us to do so.
These subrings are called Ideals.
While exploring algebraic number theory, the 19th century mathematicians Dedekind, Kronecker and others developed this concept.
Let us see how we can use it to define a quotient ring.
Consider a ring (R, +,.)
and a subring 1 of R. As (R +) is an abelian group, the subgroup, 1 is normal in (R,+), and hence the set R/1 = {a +1| 106 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS a˛ R}, of all cosets of 1 in R, is a group under the binary operation + given by (a + 1) + (b + 1) = (a + b) + 1 for all a + 1, b+ 1˛ R/1.
we wish to define.
on R/1 so as to make R/1 a ring.
You may think that the most natural way to do so is to define (a+ 1) .
(b + 1) = ab + 1" a+ 1, b + 1 ˛ R But, is this well defined?
Not always.
For instance, consider the subring Z of R and the set of cosets of Z in R. now, since 1 = 1 – 0 ˛ Z, 1 + Z = 0 + Z.
Therefore, we must have ( 2+Z ).
(1 + Z) = ( 2+Z ).
(0 + Z), i.e., 2+Z = 0 + Z, i.e.
2 ˛ Z.
But this is a contradiction.
Thus, our definition of multiplication is not valid for the set R/Z.
But, it is valid for R/1 if we add some conditions on 1.
What should these conditions be?
To answer this, assume that the multiplication in (2) is well defined.
Then, (r + 1) .
(0 + 1) = r.0 +1 = 0 + 1 = 1 for r ˛ R. Now, you know that if x ˛ 1, then x + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 As we have assumed that is well defined, we get (r +1) .
(x +1) = (r + 1) .
(0 + 1) = 0 + 1 whenever r ˛ R, x ˛ 1.
i.e., rx + 1 = 1 whenever r ˛ R, x˛ 1.
Thus, rx ˛ 1, whenever r ˛ R, x˛ 1.
So, if.
is well defined we see that the subring 1 must satisfy the additional condition that rx ˛ 1 whenever r˛ R and x˛ 1.
In sec3.3 we will prove that this extra condition on 1 is enough to make the operation, a well defined one and (R/1, +,.)
a ring.
In this section we will consider the subrings 1 of R on which we impose the condition rx˛ 1 whenever r ˛ R and x ˛ 1.
Definition: We call a non-empty subset 1 of a ring (R, +,.)
an ideal of R if i) a – b ˛ 1" a, b ˛ 1, and ii) ra ˛ 1 for all r ˛ R and a ˛ 1.
Over here we would like to remark that we are always assuming that our rings are commutative.
In the cse of non-commutative rings the definition of an ideal is partially modified as follows.
A nomn-empty subset 1 of a non-commutative ring R is an ideal if 107MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS i) a – b ˛ 1" a, b ˛ 1, and ii) ra ˛ 1and ar ˛ 1" a˛ 1 r˛ R. Now let us consider some examples.
In E 4 you saw that for any ring R, the set {0} is a subring.
In fact, it is an ideal of R called the trivial ideal of R. Other ideals, if they exist, are known as non-trivial ideals of R. You can also verify that every ring is an ideal of itself.
If an ideal 1 of a ring R is such that 1 „ R, then 1 is called a proper ideal of R. For example, if n „ 0, 1, then the subring nZ = {nm| m ˛ Z} is a proper non-trivial ideal of Z.
This is because for any z ˛ Z, z(nm) = n(zm) ˛ nZ.
Try this exercise now SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 - - - Show that {0 3} and {0,2,4} are proper ideads of Z .
6 Now let us consider some more examples of ideals.
Example 5: Let X be an infinite set.
Consider 1, the class of all finite subsets of X.
Show that 1 is an ideal of ˆ (X).
Solution: 1 = {A| A is a finite subset of X}.
Note that i) ø ˛ 1, i.e., the zero element ofˆ (X).
is in 1. ii) A – B = a + (_ B) = A + B, as B = - B in ˆ (X).
= A D B.
Thus, if A, B ˛ 1, then A –B is again a finite subset of X, and hence A – B ˛ 1./ iii) AB – A ˙ B.
Now, whenever A is a finite subset of X and B is any element of ˆ (X), A˙ B is a finite subset of X\.
Thus, A ˛ 1 and B ˛ ˆ (X).
⇒ AB˛ 1.
Hence, 1 is an ideal of ˆ (X).
Example 6: Let X be a set and Y be a non-empty of X.
Show that 1 = {A˛ ˆ (X)| A˙ Y = ø} is an ideal of ˆ (X).
In particular, if we take Y = {x }, where x is a fixed element of X, then 0 0 1 = {A˛ ˆ (X) | x ˇ A} is an ideal of ˆ (X).
0 Solution: Firstly, ø˛ 1.
108 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Secondly, " A,.
B ˛ 1, (A – B) ˙ Y = (AD B) ˙ Y = (a˙ Y) (B ˙ Y) = øD ø = ø, so that A - B˛ 1 Finally, for A ˛ 1 and B˛ ˆ (X), (AB)˙ Y = (A˙ B) ˙ Y = (A˙ Y) ˙ B = ø ˙ B = ø, so that AB ˛ 1.
Thus, 1 is an ideal of ˆ (X).
Example 7: Consider the ring C[0, 1] given in Example 6 of Unit 9.
Let M = {f ˛ C[0, 1] | f(1/2) = 0}.
Show that M is an ideal of C[0, 1].
Solution: The zero element o is defined by 0(x) = 0 for all x ˛ [0,1].
Sinc 0(1/2) = 0, 0˛ M. Also, if f, ˛ M and g ˛ C[0,1] then (fg) (1/2) = f(1/2) g(1/2) = 0 g(1/2) = 0, so fg ˛ M. Thus, M is an ideal of C[0,1].
When you study Unit 11, you will see that M is the kernel of the homomorphism Ø: C[0, 1] → R: ø(f) = f(1/2).
Now you can try an exercise that is a generalization of example 7.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 Let a ˛ [0, 1].
Show that the set 1 = { f ˛ C[0, 1] | f(a) = 0 } is an ideal of C[0, 1].
a In the next exercise we ask you to look at the subring in Example 4.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 Let R b a ring and a ˛ R. show that Ra is an ideal of R. Now that you’ve solved E 11, solving E 9 is a matter of seconds!
Let us see if E 11 can be generalized.
Example 8: For any ring R and a , a ˛ R, show that 1 2 Ra + Ra2 = {x a + x ,x | ˛ R } is an ideal of R. 1 1 1 2 2 Solution: Firstly, 0 = 0a + 0a .
\ 0˛ Ra + ra .
1 2 1 2 Next, (x a + x a ) – (y a + y a ) 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 = (x – y )a 2 – y )a ˛ Ra + Ra " x , x , y , y ˛ R. 1 1 1 + (x 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 109MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Finally, for r ˛ R and x a + x a ˛ Ra + + Ra , 1 1 2 2 1 2 R(x a + x a ) = rx a ˛ Ra + Ra .
1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 Thus, Ra + Ra is an ideal of R. 1 2 This method of obtaining ideals can extended to give ideals of the form {x a + a + … + x a | x ˛ R } for fixed elements a , …., a of R. such 1 1 2 2 n n 1 1 n ideals crop up again and again in ring theory.
We give them a special name.
Definition: Let a , ….., a be given elements of a ring R. Then the ideal 1 n generated by a , ….., a is 1 n Ra + Ra + ….
+ Ra = { x a + x a + m + x a | x ˛ R}.
a , ….., a are 1 2 n 1 1 2 2 n n 1 1 n called the generators of this ideal.
We also denote this ideal by <a 2 n 1, a , ….., a > When n = 1, the ideal we get is called a principal ideal.
Thus, if a˛ R, then Ra = is a principal ideal of R. In the next block you will be using principal ideals quite a lot.
Now an exercise on principal ideals.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 Let R be a ring with identity\.
Show that <1> = R. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 14 - - Find the principal ideals of Z generated by 3 and 5.
10 Now we look at a special ideal of a ring.
But, to do so we need to give a definition.
Definition: An element a of a ring R is called nilpotent if there exists a positive integer n such that an = 0.
- - - For Example, 3 and 6 are nilpotent elements of Z , since 32 = 9 - - - - - 9 = 0and62 = 36 =0.
Also, in any ring R, 0 is a nilpotent element.
Now consider the following example.
Exmple 9: Let R be a ring.
Show that the set of nilpotent element of R is an ideal of R. This ideal is called the nil radical of R. 110 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Solution: Let N = {a ˛ R | an = 0 for some positive integers n}.
Then 0 ˛ N. Also, if a, b ˛ N, then an = 0 and bm = 0 for some positive integers m and n. m+n Now, (a – b)m+n = ∑ m+nC a( - b)m+n-r (see E 11 of Unit 9. r r r=0 For each r = 0, 1, ….., m + n, neither r ‡ n or m + n – r ‡ m, and hence, either ar = 0 or bm+n-r = 0.
Thus, the term ar bm+n-r = 0.
So (a- b)m+n = 0.
Thus, a (ar)n = anrn = 0, i.e., ar ˛ N. Finally, if a ˛ N, an = 0 for some positive integer n, and hence, for any r˛ , (ar)n = anrn = 0, i.e., ar ˛ N. So, N is an ideal of R. Let us see what the nil radicals of some familiar rings are.
For the rings Z, Q, R or C, N = {0}, since the power of any non-zero element of these rings is non-zero.
- - For Z , N = {0,2}.
4 Try the following exercises now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 Find the nil radicals of Z and ˆ (X).
8 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 16 Let R be a ring and a ˛ R. show that 1 = {r ˛ R | ra = 0 } is an ideal of R. (This ideal is called the annihilator of a.)
By now you must be familiar with the concept of ideals.
Let us now obtain some results about ideals.
Theorem 4: let R be a ring with identity 1.
If 1 is an ideal of R and 1 ˛ 1, then 1 = R. Proof: We know that 1˝ R. We want to prove that R ˝ 1.
Let r˛ R. Since 1 ˛ 1 and 1 is an ideal of R, r = r.1 ˛ 1.
So, R ˝ 1.
Hence 1 = R. Using this result we can immediately say that Z is not an ideal of Q.
Does this also tell us whether Q is an ideal of R or not?
Certainly.
Since 1 ˛ Q and Q „ R, Q can’t be an ideal of R. 111MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Now let us shift our attention to the algebra of ideals.
In the previous section we proved that the intersection of subrings is a subring.
We will now show that the intersection of ideals is an ideal.
We will also show that the sum of ideals is an ideal and a suitably defined product of ideals is an ideal.
Theorem 5: If I and J are ideals of a ring R, then a) I ˙ J, b) I + J = {a + b|a ˛ I and b ˛ J}, and c) IJ = {x˛ R | x is a finite sum a b + … a b , where a ˛ Iand b 1 1 m m i i ˛ J}and ideals of R. Proof: a) From Theorem 2 you know that I ˙ J is a subring of R. Now, if a ˛ I ˙ J, then a ˛ I and a ˛ J.
Therefore, ax ˛ Iand ax ˛ J for all x in R. So ax ˛ I ˙ J for all a ˛ I˙ J and x ˛ R. Thus I˙ J is an ideal of R. b) Firstly, 0 = 0 + 0˛ I + J \ I+J„ f .
Secondly, if x y ˛ I + J, then x = a + b and y = a + b for some 1 1 2 2 a , a ˛ I and b , b ˛ J.
1 2 1 2 So x – y = (a + b = (a + b ) = (a – a ) + (b – b ˛ I + J 1 1) 2 2 1 2 1 2) Finally, let x ˛ I + J and r ˛ R. then x = a + b for some a ˛ I and b ˛ J. now xr = (a + b) r = ar + br ˛ I + J, as a ˛ I implies ar ˛ I and b ˛ J implies br ˛ J for all r˛ R. Thus I+J is an ideal of R. c) Firstly, IJ „ ø and J „ ø.
Next, let x, y ˛ IJ.
Then x = a b + … + a b and 1 1 m m y = a¢ b¢ + … + a¢ b¢ for some a , …, a ---------------˛- ˛˛˛ I and b , 1 1 n n 1 1 …, b , b m 1 \ x – y = (a b + … + a b ) – (a¢ b¢ + … + a¢ b¢ ) 1 1 m m 1 1 n n = a b … + a b + ( - a¢ )b¢ + … + (- a¢ )b¢ 1 1 m m 1 1 n n Which is a finite sum of elements of the form ab with a ˛ I and b ˛ J.
So, x – y ˛ IJ.
Finally, let x ˛ IJ say x = a1b1 + … + a b with a ˛ I and b ˛ J.
Then, for n n 1 1 any r ˛ R xr = (a b + … a b )r = a (b r) + … + a (b r), 1 1 n n 1 1 n n which is a finite sum of elements of the form ab with a ˛ I and b ˛ J.
(Note that b ˛ J ⇒ b r ˛ J for all r in R.) 1 1 Thus, IJ is an ideal of R. 112 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Over here, we would like to remark that if we define IJ = {ab |a ˛ I, b˛ J}, then IJ need not even be a subring, leave alone being an ideal.
This is because if x, y ˛ IJ, then with this definition of IJ it is not necessary that x - y˛ IJ.
Let us now look at the relationship between the ideals obtained in Theorem 5. let us first look at the following particular situation: R = Z, I = 2Z and J = 10Z.
Then I ˙ J = J, since J ˝ I.
Also, any element of 1 + J is of the form x = 2n + 10m, where n, m ˛ Z. thus, x = 2(n + 5m) ˛ 2Z.
on the other hand 2Z = I ˝ I + J. thus, I + J = < 2, 10> = <2>.
Similarly, you can see that IJ = <20>.
Note that IJ ˝ I ˙ J ˝ I ˝ I + J.
In fact, these inclusions are true for any I and J (see E 16).
We show the relationship in Fig.
1 R I+J I J I ˙ J IJ Fig.
1: The ideal hierarchy!
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 17 If I and J are ideals of a ring R, then show that a) IJ ˝ I ˙ J ˝ I ˝ I + J and IJ ˝ ˙ J ˝ J ˝ I + J; b) I + is the smallest ideal containing both the ideals I and J, i.e., if A is an ideal of R containing both I and J, then A must contain I + J; c) I ˙ J is the largest ideal that is contained in both I and J; d) If I ˛ R and I + J = R, then IJ = I ˙ J, i.e., if top two of fig.
1 are equal, then so are the lowest two.
113MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Let us now go back to what we said at the beginning of this section – the importance of ideal.
3.3 Quotient Rings In Unit 5 you have studied quotient groups.
You know that given a normal subgroup N of a group G, the set of all cosets of N is a group and is called the quotient group associated with the normal subgroup N. Using ideals, we will define a similar consept for rings.
At he beginning of sec---- we said that if (R, +,.)
is a ring and I is a subring of R such that (R/I, +, .)
is a ring, where + and are defined by (x + I) + (y + I) = (x + y) + I and (x + I) .
(y + I) = xy + I " x + I, y + I ˛ R/I, then the subring I should satisfy the extra condition that rx ˛ I whenever ˛ R and x ˛ I, i.e., I should be an ideal.
We now show that if I satisfies this extra condition then the operations that we have defined on R/I are well defined.
From group theory we know that (R/I, +) is an abelian group.
So we only need to check that .
is well defined, i.e., if a + I = a¢ + I, b + I = b¢ + I, then ab + I = a¢b¢ + I.
Now, since a + I = a¢ + I, a - a¢ ˛ I.
Let a = a¢ = c similarly, b - b¢ ˛ I, say b - b¢ = y, Then ab = (a¢ + x)(b¢ + y) = a¢b¢ +(xb¢ +a¢y+ xy).
\ ab - a¢b¢ ˛ I, since x ˛ I, y˛ I and I is an ideal of R. \ ab + I = a¢b¢ + I.
Thus, .
is well defined on R/I.
Now our aim is to prove the following result.
Theorem 6: Let R be a ring and I be an ideal in R. then R/I is a ring with respect to addition and multiplication defined by (x + I) + (y + I) = (x + y) + I, and (x +I) .
(y + I) = xy + I " x, y ˛ R. Proof: As we have noted earlier, (R/I, +) is an abelian group.
So to prove that R/I is a ring we only ned to check that .
is commutative, associative and distributive over +.
Now, i) .
is commutative: (a + I).
(b + I) = ab + I = ba + I = (b + I).
(a + I) for all a + I, b+ I ˛ R/I.
ii) .
is associative: " a, b, c ˛ R ((a + I).
(b + I)).
(c + I) = (ab + I).
(c + I) = (ab)c + I 114 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS = a(bc) + I = (a + I).
((b + I).
(c + I)) iii) Distributive law: let a + I, b + I, c + I ˛ R/I.
then (a + I).
((b +I) + (c+ I)) = (a + I) [(b + c) + I} = a(b + c) + I = (ab + ac) + I = (ab + I) + (ac +I).
= (a + I).
(b + I) + (a + I).
(c + I) Thus, R/I is a ring.
This ring is called the quotient ring of R by the ideal I.
Let us look at some examples.
We start with the example that gave rise to the terminology ‘R and I’.
Example 10: Let R = Z and I = nZ.

Solution: In Sec------- you have seen that nZ is an ideal of Z.
From Unit 2 you know that Z/nZ = {nZ, I + nZ, + nZ, …, (n – 1) + nZ} = {0- ,1- ,..., n - 1}, the same as the set of equivalence classes modulo n. So, R/I is the ring Z .

SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Clearly, S is non-empty.
Also, for any x, y ˛ S, x – y = x D y (As pointed out in Example 2).
You can check that x D y ˛ S " x, y ˛ S. Also, for any x, y ˛ S, xy = x ˙ y ˛ S, as you can check.
Thus, S is a subring of ˆ (X).

Thus, A satisfies Theorem 1, and hence is a subring of C. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 There are several examples.

6 6 6 Thus, 3Z and 2Z are ideals of Z .

a a \ 1 is an ideal of C[0, 1].
a SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 Ra is a subring of R (see Example 4).
Also for r˛ R and xa ˛ Ra, R(xa) = (rx)a ˛ Ra.

Now, for any r˛ R, r = r.1 ˛ <1>.
Thus, R ˝ <1>.
\ R = <1>.

Thus, the nil radical of ˆ (X) is { ø}.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 Firstly, 1 „ ø since 0 ˛ 1.

Finally, r ˛ 1 and x ˛ R ⇒ (rx)a = x(ra) = x0 = 0 ⇒ rx ˛ 1.

Also, I ˝ I + J, J ˝ I + J is obvious.
b) Let A be an ideal of R containing I as well as J.
Then certainly I + J ˝ A.
Thus, (b) is proved.
119MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS c) Let B be an ideal of R such that B ˝ I and B ˝ J.
Then certainly, B ˝ I˙ J.
Thus, (c) is proved.
d) We want to show that I ˙ J ˝ IJ.
Let x˛ I and x ˛ J.
Since I ˝ ˛ R = I +J, I = I + j, for some i˛ I and j ˛ J.
\ x = x,I = xi + xj = ix + xj ˛ IJ Thus, I ˙ J˝ IJ.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 17 1 + I is the identity of R/I.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 18 from Theorem 4, you know that I = R. \ R/I = {0}.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 19 Let x + N ˛ R/N be a nilpotent element.
Then (x + N)n = N for some positive integer n. ⇒ xn˛ N for some positive integer n. ⇒ (nn)m = 0 for some positive integer m. ⇒xnm = 0 for some positive integer nm.
⇒ x ˛ N ⇒ x + N = 0 + N, the zero element of R/N.
Thus, R/N has no non-zero nilpotent elements.

You also saw how useful they were for studying the structure of a group.
In this unit we will discuss functions between rings which preserve the two binary operations.
Such functions are called ring homomorphisms.
You will see how homomorphisms allow us to investigate the algebraic nature of a ring.
If a homomorphism is a bijection, it is called an isomorphism.
The role of isomorphisms in ring theory, as in group theory, is to identify algebraically identical systems.
That is why they are important.
We will discuss them also.
Finally, we will show you the interrelationship between ring homomorphisms, ideals and quotient rings.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit, you should be able to • Check whether a function is a ring homomorphism or not; • Obtain the kernel and image of any homomorphism; • Give examples of ring homomorphisms and isomorphisms; • Prove and use some properties of a ring homomorphism; • State, prove and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism for rings.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 121MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS 3.1 Homomorphisms Analogous to the notion of a group homomorphism, we have the concept of a ring homomorphism.
Recall that a group homomorphism preserves the group operation of its domain.
So it natural to expect a ring homomorphism to preserve the ring structure of its domain.
Consider the following definition.
Definition: Let (R , +,.)
and (R , +,.)
be two rings and f: R ﬁ R be a 1 2 1 2 map.
We say that f is a ring homomorphism if f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b), and f(a.b) = f(a).
f(b) for all a, b in R .
1 Note that the + and occurring on the left hand sides of the equations in the definition above are defined on R , while the + and occurring on the 1 right hand sides are defined on R .
2 So, we can say that f: R ﬁ R is a homomorphism if 1 2 i) the image of a sum is the sum of the images, and ii) the image of a product is the product of the images.
Thus, the ring homomorphism f is also a group homomorphism from (R , +) into (R , +).
1 2 Just as we did in unit 6, before giving some examples of homomorphisms let us define the kernel and image of a homomorphism.
As is to be expected, these definitions are analogous to the corresponding ones in unit 6.
Definition: Let R and R be two ring and f: R ﬁ R be a ring 1 2 1 2 homomorphism.
Then we define.
i) the image of f to be the set Im f = {f(x) | x ˛ R }.
1 ii) the kernel of f to be the set Ker f = {x ˛ R | f(x) = 0}.
1 Note that Im f ˝ R and Ker f ˝ R .
2 1 If Im f = R , f is called an epimorphism or an onto homomorphism, and 2 then R is called the homomorphic image of R .
2 1 Now let us look at some examples.
Example 1: Let R be a ring.
Show that the identity map 1 is a ring R homomorphism.
What are Ker 1 and Im 1 ?
R R 122 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Solution: Let x, y ˛ R. Then 1 (x + y) = x + y =1 (x) + 1 (y), and R R R 1 (xy) = xy = 1 (x) 1 (y).
R R R Thus, 1 (xy) = xy = 1 (x) 1 (y).
R R R Thus, 1 is a ring homomorphism.
R Ker 1 = {x ˛ R | 1 (x) = 0} R R = {x ˛ R | x = 0} = {0} Im 1 = {1 (x) | x ˛ R} R R = {x | x ˛ R} = R. Thus, 1 is a surjection, and hence an epimorphism.
R Example 2: Let s ˛ N, show that the map f: Zﬁ Z given by f(m) = m s for all m˛ Z is a homomorphism.
Obtain Ker f and Im f also.
Solution: For any m, n ˛ Z, f(m + n) = m + n = m+n = m+n =f(m) + f(n), and f(mn) = mn = mn = f(n ) f(n).
Therefore, f is a ring homomorphism.
Now, Ker f = {m ˛ Z | f(m) = 0} = {m ˛ Z | m = 0} = {m ˛ Z | m = 0 (mod s)} = sZ.
Im f = {f(m) | m ˛ Z} = {m | m ˛ Z} = Z , s Showing that if an epimorphism.
Example 3: Consider the map f: Z → Z : f(n (mod 6)) = n(mod 3).
6 3 Show that f is a ring homomorphism.
What is Ker f?
Solution: Firstly, for any n, m ˛ Z, F(n(mod 6) + m(mod 6)) = f((n + m) (mod 6)) = (n + m) (mod 3) = n(mod 3) + m(mod 3) = f(n (mod 6)) + f(m(mod 6)) you can similarly show that f(n(mod 6) .
m(mod 6)) = f(mod 6)).
f(m(mod 6)).
Thus, f is a ring homomorphism.
Ker f = {n(mod 6) | n ” 0(mod 3)} = {n(mod 6) | n ˛ 3Z} = {0,3}, bar denoting ‘mod 6’.
123MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Before discussing any more examples, we would like to make a remark about terminology.
In future we will use the term ‘homomorphism’ for ‘ring homomorphism’.
You may remember that we also did this in the case of group homomorphisms.
Now for some exercises.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 1 If S is a subring of a ring R, then S itself is a ring with the same + and .
of R. Show that the inclusion map i: S ﬁ R: i(x) = x is a homomorphism.
What are Ker i and Im i?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 Let R and R be two rings.
Define f: R ﬁ R : f(x) = 0.
Show that f is 1 2 1 2 a homomorphism.
Also obtain Ker f and Im f. (This function if called the trivial homomorphism.)
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 Is f: Zﬁ 2Z: f(x) = 2x a homomorphism?
Why?
Note that using E1 we know that f: Z ﬁ Q (or R, or C or Z + iZ) given by f(n) = n is a homomorphism.
Now let us look at some more examples Example 4: Consider the ring C[0, 1] of all real valued continuous functions defined on the closed interval [0 1].
Define ø: C[0, 1] ﬁ R: ø(f) = f(1/2).
Show that ø is a homomorphism.
Solution: Let f and g ˛ C[0, 1] Then (f + g) (x) + g(x) and (fg) (x) = f(x) g(x) for all x ˛ C[0, 1].
Now, ø(f + g) = (f + g) (1/2) = f(1/2) = f(1/2) = ø(f) + ø(g), and 1 1 ø(fg) = (fg) (1/2) = f( )g( )= ø(f) ø(g).
2 2 Thus, ø is a homomorphism.
a 0  Example 5: Consider the ring R =   a, b ˛ R  under matrix 0 b  124 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS n 0 addition and multiplication.
Show that the map f: Zﬁ R: f(n) =   0 n is a homomorphism.
Solution: Note that f(n) = nI, where I is the identity matrix of order 2.
Now you can check that f(n + m) = f(n) + f(m) and f(nm) = f(n) f(m) " n, m ˛ Z.
Thus, f is a homomorphism.
Example 6: Consider the ring ˆ (X) of Example 4 of unit 9.
Let Y be a non-empty subset of X.
Define f: ˆ (X) ˆ (Y) by f(A) = A ˙ Y for all A in ˆ (X).
Show that f is a homomorphism.
Does Yc ˛ Ker f?
What is Im f?
Solution: For any A and B in ˆ (X), f(A D B) = f((A\B) ¨ (B\A)) = ((A\B) ¨ (B\A ˙ Y)) = ((A\B) ˙ Y) ¨ ((B\A) ˙ Y) = ((A ˙ Y)\(B ˙ Y)) ¨ ((B ˙ Y)\(A˙ Y)) = (f(A)\f(B)) ¨ (f(B) \f(A)) = f(a) D f(B), and f(A ˙ B) = (A ˙ B) ˙ Y = (A ˙ B) ˙ (Y ˙ Y = (A ˙ Y) ˙ (B ˙ Y), since ˙ is associative and commutative = f(A) ˙ f(B).
So, f is a ring homomorphism from ˆ (X) into ˆ (Y).
Now, the zero element of ˆ (Y) is ø .
Therefore, Ker f = {A˛ ˆ (X) | A ˙ Y = ø } \ Yc ˛ Ker f. We will show that f is surjective.
Now, Im f = {A ˙ Y | A ˛ ˆ (X)} Thus, Im f ˝ ˆ (Y).
To show that ˆ (Y) ˝ Im f, take any B ˛ ˆ (Y).
Then B ˛ˆ (X) and f(B) = B ˙ Y = B.
Thus, B˛ Im f. Therefore, Im f = ˆ (Y).
Thus, f is an onto homomorphism.
The following exercises will give you some more examples of homomorphisms.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 Let A and B be two rings.
Show that the projection map 125MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS P:AXB ﬁ A: p(x, y) = x is a homomorphism.
What are Ker p and Im p?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Is f: Z + 2Z ﬁ Z+ 2Z f(a+ 2b) = a- 2b a homomorphism?
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 Show that the map ø :C[0, 1] R X R: ø If) = (f(0), f(1)) is a homomorphism.
Having discussed many examples.
Let us obtain some basic results about ring homomorphisms.
3.2 Properties of Homomorphisms Let us start by listing some properties that show how a homomorphism preserves the structure of its domain.
The following result is only a restatement of Theorem 1 of unit 6.
Theorem 1: Let f: R → R be a homomorphism from a ring R into a 1 2 1 ring R .
Then 2 a) f(0) = 0, b) f(- x) = - f(x) " x ˛ R and 1 c) f(x – y) = f(x) – f(y)" x, y˛ R .
1 Proof: Since f is a group homomorphism from (R , + ) to (R , + ), we 1 2 can apply theorem 1 os unit 6 to get the result.
In the following exercise we ask you to prove another property of homomorphisms.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Let: R → R be an onto ring homomorphism.
If R is with identity 1, 1 2 1 show that R is with identity f(1).
2 Now, let us look at direct and inverse images of subrings under homomorphisms.
(see Sec------------ for the definition of an inverse image.)
Theorem 2: Let f: R → R be a ring homomorphism.
Then 1 2 a) if S is a subring of R , f(S) is a subring of ; 1 if T is a subring of R , f-1(T) is a subring of R .
b) 2 1 126 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Proof: We will prove (b) and leave the proof of (a) to you (see E 8).
Let us use Theorem 1 of unit 10.
Firstly, since T ≠ ø .
Next, let a, b ˛ f-1(T).
Then f(a), f(b) ˛ T. ⇒ f(a) = f(b) ˛ T and f(a) f(b) ˛ T ⇒ f(a – b) ˛ T and f(ab) ˛ T ⇒ a – b ˛ f-1(T) and ab ˛ f-1(T) ⇒ f-1(T) is a subring.
To complete the proof of Theorem 2, try E 8: SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 Prove (a) of Theorem 2 Now, it is natural to expect an analogue of Theorem 2 for ideals.
But consider the inclusion i: Z →R: i(x) = x. you know that 2Z is an ideal of 1 1 Z. but is i(2Z) an ideal of R?
No.
For example, 2 ˛ 2Z, but2.
= ˇ 2Z.
4 2 Thus, the homomorphic image of an ideal need not be an ideal.
But, all is not lost.
We have the following result.
Theorem 3: Let f: R → R , be a ring homomorphism.
1 2 a) If f is surjective and 1 is an ideal of R , then f (I) is an ideal of R .
1 2 b) If I is an ideal of R , then f-1(I) is an ideal of R and Ker f ˝ f-1(I).
2 1 Proof: Here we will prove (a) and leave (b) to you (see E 9)!
Firstly, since I is a subring of R , f(I ) is a subring of R .
1 2 Secondly, take any f(x) ˛ f(I) and r ˛ R .
since f is surjective, $ s ˛ R , 2 1 such that f(s) = r. Then Rf(x) = f(s) = f(sx) ˛ f(I), since sx ˛ I.
Thus, f(I) is an ideal of R .
2 To finish the proof try E 9.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Prove (b) of Theorem 3.
Now, consider an epimorphism f: Rﬁ S and an ideal I in R. By Theorem 3 you know that f(I) is an ideal of S and f-1 (f(I)) is an ideal of R. How are I and f-1(f(I)) related?
clearly, I ˝ f-1(f(I)).
Can f-1(f(I)) contain elements of R\I?
Remember that Ker f ˝ f-1(f(I)) also.
Thus, I + Ker f ˝ f-1(f(I)).
In fact, I + Ker f = f-1(f(I)).
Let us see why.
127MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Let x ˛ f-1(f(I)).
Then f(x) ˛ f(I).
Therefore, f(x) = f(y) for some y ˛ I.
Then F(x – y) = 0.
\ x – y ˛ Ker f, i.e., x ˛ y + Ker f ˝ I + Ker f. \ f-1(f(I)) ˝ I + Ker f. Thus, I-1(f(I)) = I + Ker f. This tell us that if Ker f ˝ I, then f –1(f(I)) = I (since Ker f ˝ I ⇒ I + Ker f = I).
Now you may like to do an easy exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 Let f: Rﬁ S be an onto ring homomorphism.
Show that if J is an ideal of S, then f(f-1(J)) = J.
Our discussion so far is leading us to the following theorem.
Theorem 4: Let f-1 Rﬁ S be an onto ring homomorphism.
Then a) if I is an ideal in R containing Ker f, I = f-1(f(I)) b) the mapping I ﬁ f(I) defines a one-to-one correspondence between the set of ideals of R containing Ker f and the set of ideals of S. Proof: We have proved (a) in the disussion above.
Let us prove (b) now.
Let A be the set of ideals of R containing Ker f, and B the set of ideals of S. Define ø: A → B: ø(I) = f(I ) 2 We want to show that ø is one-on-one and onto.
ø is onto : If J ˛ B then f-1 (J) ˛ A and Ker f ˝ f-1 (J) by Theorem 3.
Now ø (f-1(J)) = f(-1(J)) = J, using E 10. ø is one-on-one: If I and I are ideals in R containing Ker f, then 1 2 ø(I ) = ø(I ) ⇒ f(I ) = f(I ) 1 2 1 2 ⇒ f-1(fI )) = f-1(f(I )) 1 2 ⇒ I = I , by (a).
1 2 Thus, ø is bijective.
Use this result for solving the following exercises.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 Find the kernel of the homomorphism f:Z→Z : f(z) = z.
12 Also find the ideals of Z .
12 128 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 Show that the homomorphism f :Z→Z X Z : f(n) = (n, n) is not onto.
Find an ideal in Z X Z which is not of the form f(I), where I is an ideal of Z.
And now let us look closely at the sets Ker f and Im f, where f is a ring homomorphism then Ker f is a normal subgroup of G and Im f is a 1 subgroup of G .
we have an analogous result for ring homomorphisms, 2 which you may have already realize from the examples you have studied so fa.
Theorem 5: Let f:R →R be a ring homomorphism.
Then 1 2 a) Ker f is an ideal of R .
1 b) Im f is a subring of R 2.
Proof: a) Since {0} is an ideal of R , by Theorem 3(b) we know that f- 2 1({0}) is an ideal of R .
But f-1({0}) = Ker f. 1 Thus, we have shown that Ker f is an ideal of R .
1 c) Since R is a subring of R , f(R ) is a subring of R , by Theorem 1 1 1 2 2(a).
Thus, Im f is a subring of R .
2 This result is very useful for showing that certain sets are ideals.
For example, from theorem 5 and example 3 you can immediately say that {0,3}is an ideal of Z .
As we go along you will see ore examples of this 6 use of Theorem 5.
Let us look a little more closely at the kernel of a homomorphism.
In fact, let us prove a result analogous to Theorem 4 of unit 6.
Theorem 6: Let f: R1→R2 be a homomorphism.
Then f is injective iff Ker f = {0}.
Proof: f is injective iff is an injective group homomorphism from (R , +) 1 into (R , +).
This is true iff Ker f = {0}, by Theorem 4 of unit 6. so, our 2 result is proved.
Using Theorem 6, solve the following exercise.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 Which of the homomorphisms in example 1-6 are 1-1?
129MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS So far we have seen the give a ring homomorphism f:R→S, we can obtain an ideal of R, namely, Ker f. Now, give an ideal I of a ring R can we define a homomorphism f so that Ker f = I?
The following theorem answers this question.
Before going to the theorem recall the definition of quotient rings from unit 10.
Theorem 7: If is an ideal of a ring R, then there exists a ring homomorphism f:R→R/I whose kernel is 1 Proof: Let us define f:R→R/1 by f(a) = a + 1 for all a ˛ R. Let let us see if f is a homomorphism.
For this take any a, b ˛ R. then F(a + b) = (a + b) + 1 = (a + 1) + (b + 1) = f(a) + f(b), and F(ab) = ab + 1 = (a + 1) (b + 1) (b + 1) = f(a) f(b).
Thus, f is a homomorphism.
Further, Ker f = {a ˛ R| f(a) = 0 + 1} = { a ˛ R | a + 1 = 1} = {˛ R | a ˛ 1} = 1.
Thus, the theorem is proved.
Also note that the homomorphism f is onto.
We call the homomorphism defined in the proof above the canonical (or natural) homomorphism from R onto R/1.
Try this simple exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 14 Let S be a subring of a ring R. Can we always define a ring homomorphism whose domain is R and Kernel is S?
why?
Now let us look at the behaviour of the composition of homomorphisms.
We are sure you find the following result quite unsurprising.
Theorem 8: Let R , R and R be ring and f: R →R , and g: R →R be 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 ring homomorphisms.
Then their composition gof: R →R give by (gof) 1 3 (x) = g(f(x)) for all x ˛ R is a ring homomorphism.
1 The proof of this result is on the same lines as the proof of the corresponding result in unit 6.
We leave it to you (see the following exercise).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 Prove Theorem 8 130 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 16 In the situation of Theorem 8 prove that a) if gof is 1 – 1, then so is f. b) if gof is onto, then so is g. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 17 Use Theorem 8 to show that the function h: Z X Z →Z defined by h(n, 2 m)) = m is a homomorphism.
Now let us see what the ring analogue of a group isomorphism is.
3.3 The Isomorphism Theorems In Unit 6 we discuss group isomorphisms and various results involving them.
In this section we will do the same thing for rings.
So, let us start by defining a ring isomorphism.
Definition: Let R and R be two rings.
A function f:R →R is called a 1 2 1 2 ring isomorphism (or simply an isomorphism) if i) f is a ring homomorphism, ii) f is 1 –1, and iii) f is onto.
Thus, a homomorphosm that is bijective is an isomorphism.
An f: R →R is an isomorphism, we say that R is isomorphism to R , 1 2 1 2 and denote it by R ≃R .
1 2 Over her we would like to make the following remark.
Remark: Two rings are isomorphic if and only if they algebraically identical.
That is, isomorphic rings must have exactly the same algebraic properties.
Thus, if R is a ring with identity then it cannot be 1 isomorphic to a ring without identity.
Similarly, if the only ideals of R 1 are {0} and itself, the any ring isomorphic to R must have this property 1 too.
Try the following exercise now.
They will help you in becoming more familiar with isomorphisms.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 18 Which of the following functions are ring isomorphisms?
131MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS a) f:Z →R: f(n) = n b) f: Z → 5Z: f(n) = 5n c) f: C→C: f(z) = z, the complex conjugate of z SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 19 Let ø: R → R2 be a ring isomorphism.
Then ø-1: R →R is a well defined 1 2 1 function since ø is bijective.
Show that ø-1 is also an isomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 20 Show that the composition of isomorphism is an isomorphism.
And now, let us go back to Unit 6 for amoment.
Overthere we roved the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphsim for groups, according to which the homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphism theorem or the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism for rings.
Theorem 9 (The Fundamental of Homomorphism): let f: R→S be a ring homomorphism.
Then R/Ker f ≃ Im f. In particular, if f is surjective, then R/Ker f ≃S Proof: Firstly, note that R/Ker f is a well-defined quotient ring since Ker f is an ideal of R. For convenience, let us put Ker f = 1. let us define.
y : R/1 →S by y (x+ 1) = f(x).
As in the case of Theorem 8 of unit 6, we need to check that y is well defined , i.e., if X + 1 = y +1 then y (x + 1) = y (y + 1).
Now, x + 1 = y +1 ⇒ x –y ˛ 1 = Ker f ⇒ f(x – y) = 0 ⇒ f(x) = f(y) ⇒ y (x + 1) = y (y + 1).
Thus y is well defined.
Now let us see whether y is an isomorphism or not i) y is a homomorphism.
: Let x =, y ˛ R. Then y ((x + 1) + (y + 1)) = y (x + y + 1) = f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) = y (x + 1) + y (y + 1), and y ((x + 1) (y + 1) = y (xy + 1) = f(xy) = f(x) f(y) = y (x + 1) y (y + 1) Thus, y is a ring homomorphism.
132 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS ii) Im y = Im f: since y (x + 1) = f(x) ˛ Im f " x ˛ R. Im y ˝ Im f. Also any element of Im f is of the form f(x) = y (x + 1) for some x ˛ R. Thus, Im f ˝ Im y .
S, Im y ” Im f. iii) y is 1 –1: To show this let x, y ˛ R such that y (x + 1) = y (y + 1).
Then f(x) = f(y), so that f(x – y) = 0, i.e., x – y ˛ Ker f = 1.
i.e., x + 1 = y + 1.
Thus, y is 1 – 1.
So, we have shown that R/Ker f ≃Im f. Thus, if f is onto, then Im f = S and R/Ker f ≃ S. Note that this result says that f is the composition y o h , where h is the canonical homomorphism h : R ﬁ R/1: h (a) = a + 1.
This can ve diagrammatically shown as f R S h y R/1 Let us look at some examples of the use of the Fundamental Theorem.
Consider p: Zﬁ Z : p(n) = n.p is an epimorphism and Ker p = {n|n =0 m mZ } mZ m .
Therefore, Z/mZ ≃ Z .
m (Note that we have often used the fact that Z/mZ and Z are the same.)
m as another example, consider the projection map p: R X R ﬁ R : p(a, b) = a, where R and R are rings.
Then p is onto 1 2 1 1 2 and its kernel is Therefore, (R X R )/R ≃ R 1 2 2 1.
Try this exercise now.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 21 What does the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphism say in each of the Examples 1 to 6?
133MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Let us now apply Theorem 9 to prove that any ring homomorphism from a ring R onto Z is uniquely determined by its Kernel.
That is, we can’t have two different ring homomorphisms from R onto Z with the same kernel (note that this is not true for group homomorphism from Z onto itself with the same kernel, {0}.)
To prove this statement we need the following result.
Theorem 10: The only non-trivial ring homomorphism from Z into itself is 1 .
Z Proof: Let f: Z ﬁ Z be a non-trivial homomorphism.
Let n be positive integer.
Then n = 1 + 1 +….
1 (n times).
Therefore, f(n) = f(1) + f(1) + … + f(1) (n times) = n f(1).
On the other hand, if n is a negative integer, then –n is a positive integer.
Therefore, f(-n) = (-n) f(1), i.e., - f(n) = - nf(1), since f is a homomorphism.
Thus, f(n) = n f(1) in this case too.
Also f(0) = 0 = of(1).
Thus, f(n) = nf(1) " n ˛ Z.
Now, since f is a non trivial homomorphism, f(m) „ 0 for some ˛ Z.
Then, 1(m) = 1(m.1) = f(m) f(1).
Canceling f(m) on both sides we get f(1) = 1 Therefore, from (1) we see that F(n) = n" n ˛ Z, i.e., f = 1 .
z This theorem has an important corollary.
Corollary: Let R be a ring isomorphisc to Z.
If f and g are two somorphisms from R onto Z, the f= g. Proof: The composition fog-1 is an isomorphism from Z onto itself.
Therefore, by Theorem 10, fog-1 = 1 , i.e., f = g. Z We are now in a position to prove the following result.
Theorem 11: Let R be a ring and f and g be homomorphisms from R onto Z such that Ker f = Ker g. Then f = g. Proof: By theorem 9 we have isomorphisms.
y : R/Ker fﬁ Z and y :R/Ker g ﬁ Z. f f 134 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS Since Ker f = Ker g, y and y are isomorphisms of the same ring onto f g Z.
Thus, by the corollary above, y = y f g Also, the canonical maps h R ﬁ R/Ker f and h Rﬁ R/Ker g are the f g same since Ker f = Ker g. \ f = ψ oη = ψ oη = g. f f g g We will now give you a chance to prove two applications of Theorem 9!
They are analogous to Theorem 10 and 11 of unit 6 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 22 (second isomorphism theorem) Let S b a subring and I be an ideal of a ring R. Show that (S + I)/I ≃S/(S ˙ I).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 23 (Third isomorphism theorem) Let I and J be ideal of a ring R such that J ˝ I.
Show that I/J is an ideal of the ring R/J and that (R/J)/(I/J) ≃R/I.
Let us halt our discussion of homomorphisms here and briefly recall what we have done in this unit.
Of course, we have not finished with these functions.
We will be going back to them again and again in the future units.

Ker i = {x ˛ S| i(x) = 0} = {0} Im i = {i(x) | x ˛ S} = S. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 2 For any x, y˛ R , f(x) + y ) = 0 = 0 + 0 = f(x) + f(y), and 1 f(xy) = = 0.0 = f(x) .

\ f is a homomorphism.
Ker f = { x ˛ R | f(x) = 0 = } = R 1 1 Im f = {0}.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 3 f(2.3) ” f(6) ” 12.
But f(2) .
(3) ” 4.6 ” 24 Thus, f(2.3) „ f(2) f(3) \ f is not a homomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 4 For any (a, b), (c, d) ˛ A X B, P((a, b) + (c, d)) = p(a + c, b + d) = a + c = pa, b) + p(c, d), P((a, b) (c, d)) = p(ac, bd) = ac = p(a, b) p(c, d).
Ker p = { (a, b) ˛ A X B | a = 0 } = {0} XB.
Im p = { p(a, b) | (a, b) ˛ A X B} = { a| (a, b) ˛ A X B} = A. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 5 Yes, you can check it.
136 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 6 For f, g ˛ C[0, 1], ø(f + g) = ((f + g) (0), (f + g ) (1)) = (f(0), f(1)) + (g(0), g(1)) = ø(f) + ø(g), and ø(fg) = (fg(0), fg(1) = (f(0), g(0)) (f(1), g(1)) = ø(f) ø(g).
\ ø is a homomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 7 Let x ˛ T .
Since f is surjective, $ r ˛ R such that f(r) = x. since 2 1 r.1 = r, f(r) f(1) = f(r).
Thus, xf(1) = x.
This is true for any x ˛ R .
2 \ f(1) is the identity of R .
2 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 8 Again use Theore 1 of unit 10. i) S ≠ ø⇒ f(S) ≠ ø ii) Let a¢,b¢ ˛ f(S).
Then $ a, b ˛ S such that f(a) = a¢ , f(b) = b¢ Now a¢- b¢ = f(a) – f(b) = f(a – b) ˛ f(S), since a – b ˛ S, and a¢b¢ = f(a) f(b) = f(ab) ˛ f(S), sine ab ˛ S. \ f(S) is a subring of R .
2 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 9 Since 1 is a subring of R , f-1(1) is a subring of R .
Now, let a ˛ f-1(1) 2 1 and r ˛ R .
We want to show that ar ˛ f-1(1).
1 Since a ˛ f-1(1), f(a) ˛ 1.
\ f(a) f(r) ˛ 1, i.e., f(ar) ˛ 1.
\ ar ˛ -1(1).
Thus, f-1(1) is an ideal of R 1 Also, if x ˛ Ker f, then f(x) = 0 ˛ 1.
\ x ˛ f-1(1).
\ Ker f ˝ f-1(1).
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 10 Let x ˛ f(f-1(J)).
Then x = f(y), where y ˛ f-1(J),i.e.
f(y) ˛ J, i.e., x ˛ J.
Thus, f(f-1(J)) ˝ J.
Now, Let x ˛ J. since f is surjective, $ y ˛ R such that f(y) = x Then y ˛ f-1(x) ˝ f-1(J).
137MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS \ x = f(y) ˛ f(f-1(J)) Thus, J ˝ f(f-1(J)).
Hence the result is proved.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 11 Ker f = { n ˛ Z| n ” 0 (mod 12)} = 12Z.
Now, you know that any ideal of Z is a subgroup of Z, and hence must be of the form nZ, n˛ N. Thus, the ideals of Z containing Ker f are all those nZ such that n|12, i.e., Z, 2Z, 3Z, 4Z, 6Z, 12Z.
Thus, by Theorem 4(b) the ideals of Z are 12 Z ,2Z ,3Z ,4Z ,6Z and{0}.
12 12 12 12 12 SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 12 For example, (0, 1) ˇ Im f. For any ideal 1 of Z, f(1) = 1 X 1.
Thus, the ideal Z X {0} of Z X Z is not of the form f(1), for any ideal 1 of Z. SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 13 The Homomorphisms in Examples 1 and 5.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 14 NO.
For example, take the subring Z of Q.
Since Z is not an ideal of Q, it can’t be the kernel of any homomorphism from Q to another ring.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 15 for any x, y ˛ R , 1 gof(x + y) = g(f(x + y)) = g(f(x) + f(y)) = gof(x) + gof(y), and gof(xy) = gof(x) gof(y).
Thus, gof is a homomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 16 a) x˛ Ker f ⇒ f(x) = 0 ⇒ gof(x) = 0 ⇒ x = 0, since gof is 1 – 1.
\ Ker f = {0}.
\ f is 1 – 1. b) Let x ˛ R .
Since gof is onto $ y ˛ R such that gof(y) = x, i.e., 3 1 g(f(y)) = x.
Thus, g is onto.
138 MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 17 h is the composition of the projection map p: Z X Z ﬁ Z: p(n, m) = m and the map f: Z ﬁ Z : f(r) = r. Both p and f are ring homomorphisms.
2 \ h is a ring homomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 18 a) is not onto and hence, not an isomorphism.
b) is not a homomorphism.
c) ee the appendix of unit 2 for properties of elements of C. Then you can easily prove that f is an isomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 19 Let x, y ˛ R and ø-1(x) = f, ø-1(y) = s. Then x = ø(r) and y = ø(s).
2 Therefore, x + y = ø(r) + ø(s) = ø(r + s) and xy = ø(rs).
\ ø-1(x + y) = r + s = ø-1(x) + ø-1(y), and ø-1(xy) = rs = ø-1(x) ø-1(y).
Thus, ø-1 is a homomorphism.
You already know that it is bijective.
Thus, ø-1 is an isomorphism.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 20 Let f ﬁ R and g: R ﬁ R be ring is isomorphisms.
From Theorem 8 1 2 2 3 you know that gof is a homomorphism.
For the rest, proceed as you did in E 12 of unit 6.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 21 Example 1 : R ≃ R. Example 2 : What we have just done above, namely, Z/sZ ≃ Z, Example 3: Z /{ 0,3} ≃ Z .

2 Im ø = R (because given any r ˛ R we can define the constant function 1 f : [0, 1] ﬁ R: f (x) = r. Then f   = r. Thus, r = ø(f ) ˛ Im ø).
r r r r 2 Example 5: Z ≃{ nI| n ˛ Z} Example 6: ˆ (X)/Ker f ≃ˆ (Y).
139MTH 312 GROUPS AND RINGS SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 22 Since 1 is an ideal of r and 1 ˝ S + 1, it is an ideal of S + 1 Thus, (S +1)/1 is a well-defined ring.
Define f: Sﬁ (S + 1)/1 : f(x) = x + 1.
Then, you can check that f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), and F(xy) = f(x) f(y) " x, y ˛ S. As you did in Theorem 10 unit 6, you can check that f is surjective and Ker f = S ˙ 1.
Thus, S/(S˙ 1) ≃ (S + 1)/1.
SELF ASSISMENT EXERCISE 23 Define f: R/J ﬁ R/1: f(r + J) = r +1.
As you did in Theorem 11 of unit 2 you can check that f is well defined, f is surjective and Ker f = 1/J.
Thus, 1/J is an ideal of R/J and (R/J)/(1/J) ≃R/1.
