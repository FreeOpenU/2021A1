In scientific problems, often times we discover that a factor depends upon several other related factors.
For instance, the area of solid depends on its length and breadth.
Potential energy of a body depends on gravity, density and height of the body etc.
Moreover, the strength of a material depends on temperature, density, isotopy and softness etc.

In general, the solution of the partial differential equation presents a much more difficult problem than the solution of ordinary differential equations.
We are therefore going to limit ourselves to a few solvable partial differential equations that are of physical interest.
1 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define linear second-order partial differential equation in more than one independent variable • use the technique of separation of variables in solving important second order linear partial differential equations in physics • solve the exercises at the end of this unit.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition An equation involving one or more partial derivatives of (unknown) functions of two or more independent variables is called a partial differential equation.
The order of a PDE is the highest order partial derivative or derivatives which appear in the equation.
For example, ¶ U ¶ 3U ¶ 2U ¶ 2U  U + =ez (1)   ¶ z ¶ y3  ¶ y2 ¶ z2  is a third order PDE since the highest order term is given by ¶ 3U ¶ y3 A PDE is said to be linear if it is of the first degree, i.e.
not having exponent greater than 1 in the dependent variable or its partial derivatives and does not contain product of such terms in the equation.
Partial derivatives with respect to an independent variable are written for brevity as a subscript; thus ¶ 2U ¶ 2U U = and U = tt ¶ t2 xy ¶ x¶ y The PDE 1 U =U +U +U (2) c2 tt xx yy zz (Where c is a constant) is linear and is of the second order while eq.
(1) is an example of a nonlinear PDE.
2 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Example 1: Important linear partial differential equations of second order (1) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u =c2 One- dimensional wave equation ¶ t2 ¶ x2 (2) ¶ u ¶ 2u =c2 One- dimensional heat equation ¶ t ¶ x2 (3) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + =0 Two- dimensional Laplace equation ¶ x2 ¶ y2 (4) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + = f(x,y) Two- dimensional poissonequation ¶ x2 ¶ y2 (5) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + + =0 Three- dimensional Laplace equation ¶ x2 ¶ y2 ¶ z2 3.2 Linear Second-Order Partial Differential Equations Many important PDEs occurring in science and engineering are second order linear PDEs.
A general form of a second order linear PDE in two independent variables x and y can be expressed as ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ u ¶ u A + B + C + D + E + Fu = G (3) ¶ x2 ¶ x¶ y ¶ y2 ¶ x ¶ y where A, B, C……,G may be dependent on variables x and y.
If G =0, then eq.
(3) is called homogeneous; otherwise it is said to be a non- homogeneous.
The homogeneous form of Eq.
(3) resembles the equation of a general conic: ax2 +bxy+cy2 +dx+ey+ f =0 We thus say that eq.
(3) is of elliptic  B2 - 4AC < 0   hyperbolic type whenB2 - 4AC > 0   parabolic  B2 - 4AC = 0 3 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I For example, according to this classification the two-dimensional Laplace equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + = 0 ¶ x 2 ¶ y 2 ( ) is of elliptic type A=C=1,B=D=E=G=0 , and the equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u - a 2 = 0 (a is a real constant) ¶ x 2 ¶ y 2 is of hyperbolic type.
Similarly, the equation ¶ 2 u ¶ u - a = 0 (a is a real constant) ¶ x 2 ¶ y is of parabola type.
Some important linear second-order partial differential equations that are of physical interest are listed below.
Example 2 Eliminate A and P from the function Z = Aeptsin px ¶ Z ¶ 2Z Solution Let = pAeptsin px and = p2Aeptsin px ¶ t ¶ t2 ¶ Z ¶ 2Z also = pAeptcospx and =- p2Aeptsin px ¶ x ¶ x2 ¶ 2Z ¶ 2Z + =0 ¶ t2 ¶ x2 i.e.
p2Aeptsin px- p2Aeptsin px=0 Example 3 Solve the equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ 2u - 7 +6 =0 ¶ x2 ¶ x¶ y ¶ y2 Solution: Let u(x,y)= f(y+m x)+g(y+m x) 1 2 So that m2 - 7m+6=0 This implies that m=1 or 6 ( ) Hence u x,y =H(y+x)+G(y+6x) 4 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 3.2.1 Laplace‘s Equation (cid:209) 2u =0 (4)  ¶ 2 ¶ 2 ¶ 2  Where (cid:209) 2 is the Laplacian operator (cid:209) 2 = + +  .
The    ¶ x2 ¶ y2 ¶ y2  function u may be the electrostatic potential in a charge-free region or gravitational potential in a region containing no matter.
3.2.2 Wave Equation 1 ¶ 2 u (cid:209) 2 u = (5) v 2 ¶ t 2 Where u represents the displacement associated with the wave and v, the velocity of the wave.
3.2.3 Heat Conduction Equation ¶ u =a (cid:209) 2u (6) ¶ t Where u is the temperature in a solid at time t. The constant a is called the diffusivity and is related to the thermal conductivity, the specific heat capacity, and the mass density of the object.
3.2.4 Poisson’s Equation (cid:209) 2u = r (x,y,z) (7) Where the function r (x,y,z)is called the source density.
For example, if u represents the electrostatic potential in a region containing charges, thenr is proportional to the electric charge density.
Example 4 Laplace’s equation arises in almost all branches of analysis.
A simple example can be found from the motion of an incompressible fluid.
Its velocity v(x,y,z,t) and the fluid density r (x,y,z,t) must satisfy the equation of continuity: ¶ r +(cid:209) .
(rv)=0 ¶ t If r is constant we then have (cid:209) •v=0 5 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I If furthermore, the motion is irrotational, the velocity vector can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function V: v=(cid:209)- V and the continuity becomes Laplace’s equation: (cid:209) 2V = 0 (cid:209) .v=(cid:209) .
(-(cid:209) V)=0, or The scalar function V is called the velocity potential 3.3 Method of Separation of Variables The technique of separation of variables is widely used for solving many of the important second order linear PDEs.
The basic approach of this method in attempting to solve a differential equation (say, two independent variables x and y) is to write the dependent variable u(x,y) as a product of functions of the separate variables u(x,t)= X(x)T(t) .
In many cases the partial differential equation reduces to ordinary equations for X and T. 3.3.1 Application to Wave Equation Let us consider the vibration of an elastic string governed by the one- dimensional wave equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u =c2 (8) ¶ t2 ¶ x2 where u(x, y) is the deflection of the string.
Since the string is fixed at the ends x = 0 and x=l, we have the two boundary conditions u(0,t)=0, u(l,t)=0 for all t (9) The form of the motion of the string will depend on the initial deflection (deflection at t = 0) and on the initial velocity (velocity at t = 0).
Denoting the initial deflection by f(x) and the initial velocity by g(x), the two initial conditions are ¶ u u(x,0)= f(x) = g(x) (10) ¶ t t=0 This method expresses the solution of u(x,t) as the product of two functions with their variables separated, i.e.
U(x,t)=X(x)T(t) (11) where X and T are functions of x and t respectively.
6 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Substituting eq.
(11) in eq.
(8), we obtain XT¢ ¢ =c2 X¢ ¢ T or ¢¢ ¢¢ X (x) 1 T (t) = (12) X(x) c2 T(t) In other words ¢¢ ¢¢ X 1 T = =l (13) X c2 T The original PDE is then separated into two ODEs, viz.
X¢¢(x)- lX(x)=0 (14) and T¢ ¢(t)- lc2T(t)=0 (15) The boundary conditions given by eq.
(9) imply X(0)T(t) = 0 and X(l)T(t) = 0 Since T(t) is not identically zero, the following conditions are satisfied X(0) = 0 and X(l) = 0 (16) Thus eq.
(14) is to be solved subject to conditions given by eq.
(16).
There are 3 cases to be considered.
Case 1 l >0 The solution to eq.
(14) yields X(x) =Ae- lx +Be lx (17) To satisfy the boundary condition given by eq.
(16), we must have Ae- l l +Be l l = 0 Since the determinant formed by the coefficients of A and B is non-zero, the only solution is A = B = 0.
This yields the trivial solution X(x) = 0.
7 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Case 2 l =0 The solution to eq.
(14) yields X(x) =A+Bx To satisfy the boundary condition given by eq.
(16), we must have A=0 and A+Bl=0 implying A=0, B=0 Again for this case, a trivial solution is obtained Case 3 l <0 Letl =- k2.
The solution to eq.
(14) yields X(x) =Acoskx+Bsinkx (18) To satisfy the boundary condition given by eq.
(16), we must have A=0 and Bsinkl=0 To obtain a solution whereB„ 0, we must have kl=np n =1,2,...
Thus np 2 l =- k2=-   (19)  l  (n=0 corresponds to the trivial solution).
The specific values of l are known as the eigenvalues of eq.
(14) and the corresponding solutions, np  viz, sin x are called the eigenfunctions.
Since there are many  l  possible solutions, each is subscripted by n. Thus np  X (x)= B sin x n=1,2,3,... (20) n n  l  The solution to Eq.
(15) with l given by Eq.
(19) is np  np  T (t)= E cos ct+F sin ct n=1,2,3,... (21) n n  l  n  l  8 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Where E and F are arbitrary constants.
There are thus many solutions n n for eq.
(8) which is given by U (x,t)= X (x)T (t) n n n  np  np  np a cos ct+b sin ctsin x (22)  n  l  n  l  l Where a =B E and b =B F .
Since eq.
(8) is linear and homogeneous, n n n n n n the general solution is obtained as the linear superposition of all the solutions given by eq.
(22), i.e.
¥  npc npc  np U(x,t)=∑a cos t+b sin tsin x (23)  n l n l  l n=1 Differentiating with respect to t, we have ¥ npc npc npc  np U (x,t)=∑ - a sin t+b cos tsin x (24) t l  n l n l  l n=1 The coefficients a and b are obtained by applying the initial n n conditions in eq.
(10).
Thus, ¥ np U(x,0)= f(x)=∑a sin x (25) n l n=1 ¥ np  np U(x,0)=g(x)=∑b  csin x (26) n l  l n=1 In order to determine a and b we use the orthogonality properties of n n np sin xin the range 0£ x£ l, i.e.

(8) subject to the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.
3.3.2 Application to Heat Conduction Equation The one-dimensional heat flow in a rod bounded by the planes x = 0 and x = a is of practical interest.
The solution applies to the case where the y and z dimensions extend to infinity.
The temperature distribution is determined by solving the one-dimensional heat conduction equation ¶ 2q 1¶ q = (31) ¶ x2 v ¶ t Where q represents the temperature and k v= (32) Cr k, C and r are the thermal conductivity, specific heat and density of the material respectively.
We shall treat the case where the boundary conditions are given by q (x=0,t)=0 (33) 10 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I q (x=a,t)=0 (34) The initial temperature distribution is given by q (x,t =0)= f(x) (35) Solution: Using the method of separation of variables, the x-dependence and t-dependence are separated out as expressed by q (x,t)= X(x)T(t) (36) Substituting eq.
(36) into eq.
(31) yields 1 d2X 1 1 dT = =a (37) X dx2 vT dt We shall now consider three cases corresponding to different values of the constanta .
Case 1 l =0 The separated ODE for X(x) becomes d2X =0 (38) dx2 i.e.
X(x)= Ax+B The boundary conditions expressed by eqs.
(33) and (34) are respectively X(x=0)=0 and X(x=a)=0 (39) Since T(t) should not be identically zero.
Thus for eq.
(38) to satisfy the boundary conditions given by eq.
(39), we must have A = 0, B = 0.
This gives the steady-state solution where temperature in the rod is everywhere zero.
Case 2 l >0 Let a =k2.
The ODE for X becomes d2X =k2X (40) dx2 Therefore X(x)= Aekx +Be- kx Applying the boundary conditions given in eq.
(39), we get 11 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 0 = A + B 0= Aeka +Be- ka Again we have A = B = 0 Case 3 l <0 Let a =- l2.
The ODE for X(x) becomes d2X =- l2X (41) dx2 Thus X(x)= Acoslx+Bsinlx The boundary conditions require A = 0 Bsinla=0 (42) i.e.
la =np n=1, 2,... (43) Since there are multiple solutions, each l is designated by a subscript n as l .
The solution of the ODE for T(t) is readily obtained as n T(t)=Ce- l2nvt (44) Thus the general solution which is a superposition of all admissible solution is given by ¥ np q (x,t)=∑D e- l2nvtsin x (45) n a n=1 ¥  n2p 2  np =∑D exp- vtsin x (46)   n=1 n  a2  a To complete the solution D must be determined from the remaining n initial condition ¥ np i.e.
f(x)=∑D sin x (47) n a n=1 12 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I mp In order to determineD , we multiply eq.
(47) by sin x and integrate n a the limits x=0 and x = a to obtain a mp ¥ a np mp a ∫ f(x)sin xdx=∑D ∫a sin xsin xdx=D a n n a a m2 0 n=1 0 Thus 2 a mp D = ∫ f(x)sin xdx (48) m a a 0 For the specific case where f(x)=q (constant), the solution is given by 0 4q ¥ 1 (2n+1)px  v(2n+1)2p 2 q (x,t)= 0 ∑ sin exp-  p n=02n+1 a  a2  0 < x < a (49) From eq.
(49), it can be deduced that a rectangular pulse of height q for 0 0<x< a has the Fourier series expansion given by 4q ¥ 1 (2n+1)px 0 ∑ sin p 2n+1 a n=0 Also if f(x) =gx, then 2ag ¥ (- 1)n- 1 np   vn2p 2  q (x,t)= ∑ sin xexp- t (50) p n=1 n  a   a2  If the end boundaries are maintain at different temperature i.e.
q (x=0,t)=q 1 q (x=a,t)=q (51) 2 Then case 1 of the solution where a =0,would yield the steady-state x( ) solution given byq + q - q .
The general solution is given by 1 a 2 1 x( ) q (x,t)=f (x,t)+q + q - q (52) 1 a 2 1 Where f(x,t) is the transient solution.
13 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I The boundary conditions for f(x,t) are obtained as follows: at x = 0: q (x=0,t)=q =f(x=0,t)+q ⇒f(x=0,t)=0 1 1 at x = a: q (x=a,t)=q =f(x=a,t)+q ⇒f(x=a,t)=0 2 2 f(x,t) is obtained under case 3.

Illustrative examples and some important applications of Fourier series to Partial differential equations will be studied.
We will also study the concept of periodic functions, even and odd functions and the conditions for Fourier expansion.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should able to: • identify whether a given function is even, odd or periodic • evaluate the Fourier coefficients • derive and apply Fourier series in forced vibration problems • use Fourier Integral for treating various problems involving periodic function • apply half range expansion to solutions of some problems.
18 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Periodic Functions A function f(x)is said to be periodic if it defined for all real x and if there is some positive number T such that f(x+T)= f(x) (1) This number T is then called a period of f(x).
Periodic functions occur very frequently in many application of mathematics to various branches of science.
Many phenomena in nature such as propagation of water waves, light waves, electromagnetic waves, etc are periodic and we need periodic functions to describe them.
Familiar examples of periodic functions are the sine and cosine functions.
Example 1 Find the period of Tanx.
Solution: Suppose T is its period f(x+T)=Tan(x+T)=Tanx so that Tan(x+T)- Tanx=0 using trigonometric identity, we have TanT(1- Tan2x) =0 1- TanxTanT This implies that TanT =0 If and only if 1- Tan2x„ 0 T =Tan- 10 Hence T =p 3.2 Even and Odd Functions [ ] A function f(x) defined on interval a,b is said to be a even function if f(- x)= f(x) (2) 19 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I It is odd otherwise, that is f(- x)=- f(x) (3) Example 2 Let f(x)=sinx Then f(- x)=- f(x) i.e.
sin(- x)- =- sinx Thus it is obvious that sine function is always an odd function while cosine function is an even function.
3.3 Fourier Theorem According to the Fourier theorem, any finite, single valued periodic function f(x)which is either continuous or possess only a finite number of discontinuities (of slope or magnitude), can be represented as the sum of the harmonic terms as 1 f(x)= a +a cosx+a cos2x+...+a cosnx 2 0 1 2 n +b sinx+b sin2x+.

All other integrals on the right 0 are zero, as can be readily seen by performing the integration.
Hence our first result is 1 p a = ∫ f(x)dx (6) 0 2p - p We now determine a , a ,... by a similar procedure.
We multiply 1 2 Eq.
(5) by cosmx , where m is any fixed positive integer, and then integrate from - p to p , ∫p f(x)cosmxdx=∫p a +∑¥ (a cosnx+b sinnx)cosmxdx (7) - p - p  0 n n  n=1 Integrating term-by-term, we see that the right-hand side becomes ¥ a ∫p cosmxdx+∑a ∫p cosnxcosmxdx+b ∫p sinnxcosmxdx 0 - p  n - p n - p  n=1 The first integration is zero.
By applying trigonometric identity, we obtain p 1 p 1 p ∫ cosnxcosmxdx= ∫ cos(n+m)xdx+ ∫ cos(n- m)xdx - p 2 - p 2 - p p 1 p 1 p ∫ sinnxcosmxdx= ∫ sin(n+m)xdx+ ∫ sin(n- m)xdx.
- p 2 - p 2 - p Integration shows that the four terms on the right are zero, except for the last term in the first line which equals p when n=m.
since in eq.
(7) this term is multiplied bya , the right-hand side in eq.
(7) is equal m toa p , and our second result is m 1 p a = ∫ f(x)cosmxdx m =1, 2... (8) m p - p We finally determine b b ...... in eq.

The next integral is of the type considered before, and we know that it is zero for all n = 1, 2,….
For the integral we obtain p 1 p 1 p ∫ sinnxsinmxdx= ∫ cos(n- m)xdx- ∫ cos(n+m)xdx - p 2 - p 2 - p The last term is zero.
The first term on the right is zero when n„ m and is p whenn=m.
Since in eq.
(9) this term is multiplied byb , the right- m hand side in eq.
(6) is equal to b p , and our last result is m 1 p b = ∫ f(x)sinmxdx m =1, 2... m p - p Writing n in place of m, we altogether have the so-called Euler formulas 1 p (a) a = ∫ f(x)dx 0 p - p 1 p (b) a = ∫ f(x)cosnxdx n =1, 2...

(10a) we obtaina =0.
This can also be seen without 0 integration since the area under curve of f(x) between - p and p is zero.

We write eq.
(12) in the form d2x dx +2K +w 2x(t)=G(t) (13) dt2 dt 0 G k F(t) Where K = , w 2 = and G(t)= .
The solution of the 2m 0 m m homogeneous part of eq.
(13) can be readily obtained and is given by [ ] ( ) x(t)= Ae=Ktcos w 2 - K2 t +q for w 2 > K2 (14) 1 0 0 x(t)=(A t+B)e- Kt for w 2 > K2 (15) 2 0 In order to obtain the solution of the inhomogeneous part of eq.
(13), we first assume F(t) to be a sine or cosine function; for definiteness we assume 24 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I G(t)=bsinw t (16) The particular solution of eq.
(13) can be written in the form x(t)=Csinw t+Dcosw t (17) The values of C and D can readily be obtained by substituting eq.
(17) in eq.
(13), and comparing coefficients of sinw tand cosw twe obtain 2w K D = - b ( ) w 2 - w 2 2 +4w 2K 2 0 (18) w 2 - w 2 C = - 0 b ( ) w 2 - w 2 2 +4w 2K 2 0 Now, if G(t) is not a sine or cosine function, a general solution of eq.
(13) is difficult to obtain.
However, if we make a Fourier expansion of G(t) then the general solution of eq.
(13) can easily be written down.
As a specific example, we assume G(t)=a t (19) The Fourier expansion of G(t)can readily be obtained as ¥ G(t)=∑b sinnw t (20) n n=1 Proceeding in a manner similar to that described above we obtained the following solution for the inhomogeneous part of eq.
(13) x(t)=∑¥ [C sinnw t+D cosnw t] (21) n n n=1 Where 2nw K D =- ( ) b n w 2 - n2w 2 2 +4n2w 2K2 n 0 (22) (w 2 - n2w 2) C =- ( 0 ) b n w 2 - n2w 2 2 +4n2w 2K2 n 0 thus, if G(t) is a periodic function with period T then eq.
(21) will be valid for all values of t. 3.6 Half-Range Expansions In various physical and engineering problems there is a practical need for applying Fourier series to functions f(t) which are defined merely 25 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I on some finite interval.
The function f(t) is defined on an interval 0<t<land on this interval we want represent f(t) by a Fourier series.
A half-range Fourier series for a function f(x) is a series consisting of the sine and cosine terms only.
Such functions are defined on an interval (0,l)and we then obtain a Fourier cosine series which represents an even periodic function f (t) of 1 period T =2lso that ¥ np f(t)=a +∑a cos t 0<t<l 0 n l n=1 (23) and the coefficients are a =1∫l f(t)tdt, a = 2∫l f(t)cosnp tdt n =1, 2... 0 l 0 n l 0 l (24) Then we obtain a Fourier sine series which represents an odd periodic function f (t) of period T =2lso that 2 ¥ np f(t)=∑b sin t 0<t<l n l n=1 (25) and the coefficients are b = 2∫l f(t)sinnp tdt n =1, 2... n l 0 l (26) The series in eqs.
(23) and (25) with the coefficients in eqs.
(24) and (26) are called half-range expansions of the given function f(t) Example 4 Find the half-range expansions of the function 2k l t when 0<t <   l 2 f(t)= 2k (l- t) when l <t <l   l 2 26 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Solution: From eq.

When the fundamental period is made infinite, the limiting form of the Fourier series becomes an integral which is called Fourier Integral.
3.7.1 Definition [ ] Let f(x) be defined and single valued in the interval - L, L .
If f(x)satisfies the following conditions: (i) f(x)is periodic and of period 2L (ii) f(x)and f¢(x)are piecewise continuous ¥ (iii) ∫ f(x)dxis convergent, then f(x)can be expressed as - ¥ ¥ ( ) f(x)=∫ A(a )cosa x+B(a )sina x dx 0 (27) 1 ¥ A(a )= ∫ f(x)cosa xdx p - ¥ (28) 1 ¥ B(a )= ∫ f(x)sina xdx p - ¥ (29) 3.8 Fourier Integrals of Even and Odd Functions It is of practical interest to note that if a function is even or odd and can be represented by a Fourier integral, and then this representation will be simpler than in the case of an arbitrary function.
This follows immediately from our previous formulas, as we shall now see.
If f(x) is an even function, then B(a )=0 2 ¥ A(a )= ∫ f(x)cosa xdx (30) p 0 29 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I and eq.

(28), also 2 ¥ B(a )= ∫ f(x)sina xdx p 0 (32) and ¥ f(x)=∫ B(a )sina xdx (f odd) (33) 0 These simplifications are quite similar to those in the case of a Fourier series discussed.

It may be readily seen that when n=0.2, 4,... 34 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I The even series becomes a polynomial and the odd series remains an infinite series.
Similarly for n=1, 3, 5,... the odd series becomes a polynomial and the even series remains an infinite series.
Thus when n=0, 1, 2, 3,... one of the solutions becomes a polynomial.
The Legendre polynomial, or the Legendre function of the first kind is denoted by P (x)and is n defined in terms of the terminating series as below: S (x) n for n=0, 2, 4, 6,...  S (1) P (x)= n (5) n Tn(x) for n=1,3, 5, 7,... T (1) n Thus, 1( ) P(x)=1, P(x)= x, P(x)= 3x2 - 1, 0 1 2 2 1( ) 1( ) P(x)= 5x3- 3x, P (x)= 35x4- 30x2 +3, (6) 3 2 4 8 1( ) P(x)= 63x5- 70x3+15x,... 5 8 Obviously, P (1)=1 (7) n Higher order Legendre polynomials can easily be obtained by using the recurrence relation nP (x)=(2n- 1)xP (x)- (n- 1)P (x) n n- 1 n- 2 Since for even values of n the polynomials P (x) contain only even n powers of x and for odd values of n the polynomials contain only odd powers of x, we readily have P (- x)=(- 1)nP (x) and obviously (8) n n P (- 1)=(- 1)n (9) n 3.3 The Generating Function The generating function for the Legendre polynomials is given by ¥ G(x,t)=(1- 2xt+t2)- 12 =∑P (x)tn; - 1£ x£ 1,t <1 (10) n n=0 35 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Let us assume that ¥ G(x,t)=(1- 2xt+t2)- 12 =∑K (x)tn (11) n n=0 Where K (x)is a polynomial of degree n. Putting x = 1 in eq.
(11), we n obtain ¥ ∑K (x)tn =(1- 2t+t2)- 12 n n=0 =(1- t)- 1 =1+t+t2 +t3 +...+tn + .
.. Equating the coefficients of tnfrom both sides, we have K (1)=1 (12) n Now, if we can show that K (x) satisfies eq.
(1), then K (x) will be n n identical to P (x).
Differentiating G(x, t) with respect to x and t, we n obtain ¶ G (1- 2xt+t2) =(x- t)G(x,t) (13) ¶ t and ¶ G ¶ G t =(x- t) (14) ¶ t ¶ x Using eqs.
(11), (13) and (14), we have ¥ ¥ (1- 2t+t2)∑nK (x)tn- 1 =(x- t)∑K (x)tn (15) n n n=0 n=0 and ¥ ¥ t∑nK (x)tn- 1 =(x- t)∑K¢ (x)tn (16) n n n=0 n=0 Equating the coefficient of tn- 1 on both sides of eqs.
(15) and (16), we get nK (x)- (2n- 1)xK (x)+(n- 1)K (x)=0 (17) n n- 1 n- 2 and xK¢ (x)- K¢ (x)=(n- 1)K (x) (18) n- 1 n- 2 n- 1 Replacing n by n+1 in Eq.
(18), we obtain xK¢ (x)- K¢ (x)=nK (x) (19) n n- 1 n We next differentiate Eq.
(17) with respect to x and eliminate K¢ with n- 2 help of Eq.
(18) to obtain 36 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I K¢ (x)- xK¢ (x)- nK (x)=0 (20) n n- 1 n- 1 If we multiply eq.
(19) by x and subtract it from eq.
(20), we would get (1- x2)K¢ - n(K - xK )=0 (21) n n- 1 n Differentiating the above equation with respect to x, we have (1- x2)K¢ ¢ - 2xK¢ - n(K¢ - xK¢ - K )=0 (22) n n n- 1 n n Using eqs.
(19) and (22), we obtain (1- x2)K¢ ¢ (x)- 2xK¢ (x)- n(n+1)K (x)=0 (23) n n n which shows that K (x)is a solution of Legendre equation.
In view of n eqs.
(7) and (12) and the fact that K (x)is a polynomial in x of degree n, n it follows that K (x)is nothing but P (x).
eq.
(17) gives the recurrence n n relation for P (x) n nP (x)=(2n- 1)xP (x)- (n- 1)P (x) (24) n n- 1 n- 2 3.4 Rodrigues’ Formula Let f(x)=(x2 - 1)n (25) Differentiating eq.
(25), we get df =2nx(x2 - 1)n- 1 dx or d2f df (1- x2) +2x(n- 1) +2nf =0 dx2 dx Differentiating the above equation n times with respect to x, we would get d2f df (1- x2) n +2x n +n(n+1)f =0 (26) dx2 dx n where [ ] dnf dn ( ) f = = x2 - 1n (27) n dxn dxn 37 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I This shows that f (x)is a solution of the Legendre’s equation.
Further, it n is obvious from eq.
(27) that f (x)is a polynomial of degree n in x. n Hence f (x)should be a constant multiple ofP (x), i.e.
n n [ ] ( ) dn x2 - 1n =CP (x) (28) dxn n [ ] dn (x2 - 1)n = dn [(x+1)n(x- 1)n] dxn dxn =n!

It may be seen that all terms on the right hand side of eq.
(29) contain a factor (x-1) except for the last term.
Hence dn ( ) x2 - 1n =2nn!
(30) dxn x=1 Using Eqs.
(7), (28) and (29), we obtain C =2nn!
(31) Therefore 1 dn ( ) P (x)= x2 - 1n (32) n 2nn!dxn This is known as the Rodrigues formula for the Legendre polynomials.
For example 1 d2 ( ) P (x)= x2 - 12 2 222!dx2 1( ) = 3x2 - 1 2 Which is consistent with eq.

(34) by P (x)and eq.
(35) by P (x)and subtracting eq.
(35) m n from eq.
(34), we get d [ ( )] (1- x2) P¢ (x)P (x)- P¢ (x)P (x) dx n m m n =(m- n)(n+m+1)P (x)P (x) n m Integrating the above equation from x = -1 to x = 1, we get (1- x2)[(P¢ (x)P (x)- P¢ (x)P (x))]+1 n m m n - 1 =(m- n)(n+m+1)∫1 P (x)P (x)dx - 1 n m Because of the factor (1- x2)the left hand side of the above equation vanishes; hence ∫1 P (x)P (x)dx for m„ n - 1 n m To determine the value of the integral ∫1 P2(x)dx - 1 m we square both sides of eq.
(10) and obtain ¥ ¥ (1- 2xt+t2)- 1 =∑∑P (x)P (x)tm+n (36) m n m=0n=0 Integrating both sides of the above equation with respect to x from -1 to +1 and using eq.
(33), we get 39 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I ∑¥ t2n∫1 P2(x)dx=∫1 1 dx=1ln1+t - 1 n - 11- 2xt+t2 t 1- t n=0  1 1 1  =21+ t2 + t4 +...+ t2n +...  3 5 2n+1  Equating the coefficients of t2n on both sides of the above equation, we have ∫1 P2(x)dx= 2 n=0,1, 2,3,....

We assume the 0 origin of our coordinate system to be at the centre of the sphere.
Because the sphere is a perfect conductor, the potential on its surface will be constant which, without any loss of generality, may be assumed to be zero.
Thus, eq.

Since n2 appears in eq.
(1), we will assume, without any loss of generality, that n is either zero or a positive number.
The two linearly independent solutions of eq.

However, x = 0 is a regular singular point of the differential equation and a series solution of eq.

Next, we will examine eq.

In general the first n terms of the series would vanish giving ¥ (x 2)- n+2r J (x)=∑ (18) - n r!G (- n+r+1) r=n If we put r = k+n, we would obtain ¥ (x 2)n+2k J (x)=∑(- 1)k+n - n (k+n)!G (k+1) k=0 ¥ (x 2)n+2k =∑(- 1)k k!G (k+n+1) k=0 =(- 1)nJ (x) (19) n 49 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Thus for n=0, 1, 2, 3,.

The solutions of eq.

These polynomial solutions are called Hermite polynomials.
Hermite polynomials appear in many diverse areas, the most important being the harmonic oscillator problem in quantum mechanics.
Using Frobenius method to solve eq.
(1), and following the various steps, we have Step1: We substitute the power series ¥ y(x)=∑C xp+r (3) r r=0 in eq.
(1) and obtain the identity C p(p- 1)+C (p+1)px+ 0 1 ¥ ∑[C (p+r)(p+r- 1)- C (2p+2r- 3- l )]xr =0 r r- 2 r=2 Step 2: Equating to zero the coefficients of various powers of x, we obtain (i) p =0 or p =1 (4a) (ii) p(p+1)C =0 (4b) 1 2p+2r- 3- l (iii) C = C for r ‡ 2 (4c) r (p+r)(p+r- 1) r- 2 When p =0, C becomes indeterminate; hence p = 0 will yield both the 1 linearly independent solutions of eq.
(1).
Thus, we get 2r- 3- l C = C for r ‡ 2 (5) r r(r- 1) r- 2 which gives 1- l C = C .

In general, the solution of the partial differential equation presents a much more difficult problem than the solution of ordinary differential equations.
We are therefore going to limit ourselves to a few solvable partial differential equations that are of physical interest.
1 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 8.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define linear second-order partial differential equation in more than one independent variable • use the technique of separation of variables in solving important second order linear partial differential equations in physics • solve the exercises at the end of this unit.
9.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.9 Definition An equation involving one or more partial derivatives of (unknown) functions of two or more independent variables is called a partial differential equation.
The order of a PDE is the highest order partial derivative or derivatives which appear in the equation.
For example, ¶ U ¶ 3U ¶ 2U ¶ 2U  U + =ez (1)   ¶ z ¶ y3  ¶ y2 ¶ z2  is a third order PDE since the highest order term is given by ¶ 3U ¶ y3 A PDE is said to be linear if it is of the first degree, i.e.
not having exponent greater than 1 in the dependent variable or its partial derivatives and does not contain product of such terms in the equation.
Partial derivatives with respect to an independent variable are written for brevity as a subscript; thus ¶ 2U ¶ 2U U = and U = tt ¶ t2 xy ¶ x¶ y The PDE 1 U =U +U +U (2) c2 tt xx yy zz (Where c is a constant) is linear and is of the second order while eq.
(1) is an example of a nonlinear PDE.
2 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Example 1: Important linear partial differential equations of second order (1) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u =c2 One- dimensional wave equation ¶ t2 ¶ x2 (2) ¶ u ¶ 2u =c2 One- dimensional heat equation ¶ t ¶ x2 (3) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + =0 Two- dimensional Laplace equation ¶ x2 ¶ y2 (4) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + = f(x,y) Two- dimensional poissonequation ¶ x2 ¶ y2 (5) ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + + =0 Three- dimensional Laplace equation ¶ x2 ¶ y2 ¶ z2 3.10 Linear Second-Order Partial Differential Equations Many important PDEs occurring in science and engineering are second order linear PDEs.
A general form of a second order linear PDE in two independent variables x and y can be expressed as ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ u ¶ u A + B + C + D + E + Fu = G (3) ¶ x2 ¶ x¶ y ¶ y2 ¶ x ¶ y where A, B, C……,G may be dependent on variables x and y.
If G =0, then eq.
(3) is called homogeneous; otherwise it is said to be a non- homogeneous.
The homogeneous form of Eq.
(3) resembles the equation of a general conic: ax2 +bxy+cy2 +dx+ey+ f =0 We thus say that eq.
(3) is of elliptic  B2 - 4AC < 0   hyperbolic type whenB2 - 4AC > 0   parabolic  B2 - 4AC = 0 3 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I For example, according to this classification the two-dimensional Laplace equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u + = 0 ¶ x 2 ¶ y 2 ( ) is of elliptic type A=C=1,B=D=E=G=0 , and the equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u - a 2 = 0 (a is a real constant) ¶ x 2 ¶ y 2 is of hyperbolic type.
Similarly, the equation ¶ 2 u ¶ u - a = 0 (a is a real constant) ¶ x 2 ¶ y is of parabola type.
Some important linear second-order partial differential equations that are of physical interest are listed below.
Example 2 Eliminate A and P from the function Z = Aeptsin px ¶ Z ¶ 2Z Solution Let = pAeptsin px and = p2Aeptsin px ¶ t ¶ t2 ¶ Z ¶ 2Z also = pAeptcospx and =- p2Aeptsin px ¶ x ¶ x2 ¶ 2Z ¶ 2Z + =0 ¶ t2 ¶ x2 i.e.
p2Aeptsin px- p2Aeptsin px=0 Example 3 Solve the equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u ¶ 2u - 7 +6 =0 ¶ x2 ¶ x¶ y ¶ y2 Solution: Let u(x,y)= f(y+m x)+g(y+m x) 1 2 So that m2 - 7m+6=0 This implies that m=1 or 6 ( ) Hence u x,y = H(y+x)+G(y+6x) 4 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 3.2.1 Laplace‘s Equation (cid:209) 2u =0 (4)  ¶ 2 ¶ 2 ¶ 2  Where (cid:209) 2 is the Laplacian operator (cid:209) 2 = + +  .
The    ¶ x2 ¶ y2 ¶ y2  function u may be the electrostatic potential in a charge-free region or gravitational potential in a region containing no matter.
3.2.2 Wave Equation 1 ¶ 2 u (cid:209) 2 u = (5) v 2 ¶ t 2 Where u represents the displacement associated with the wave and v, the velocity of the wave.
3.4.3 Heat Conduction Equation ¶ u =a (cid:209) 2u (6) ¶ t Where u is the temperature in a solid at time t. The constant a is called the diffusivity and is related to the thermal conductivity, the specific heat capacity, and the mass density of the object.
3.4.4 Poisson’s Equation (cid:209) 2u = r (x,y,z) (7) Where the function r (x,y,z)is called the source density.
For example, if u represents the electrostatic potential in a region containing charges, thenr is proportional to the electric charge density.
Example 4 Laplace’s equation arises in almost all branches of analysis.
A simple example can be found from the motion of an incompressible fluid.
Its velocity v(x,y,z,t) and the fluid density r (x,y,z,t) must satisfy the equation of continuity: ¶ r +(cid:209) .
(rv)=0 ¶ t If r is constant we then have (cid:209) •v=0 5 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I If furthermore, the motion is irrotational, the velocity vector can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function V: v=(cid:209)- V and the continuity becomes Laplace’s equation: (cid:209) 2V = 0 (cid:209) .v=(cid:209) .
(-(cid:209) V)=0, or The scalar function V is called the velocity potential 3.5 Method of Separation of Variables The technique of separation of variables is widely used for solving many of the important second order linear PDEs.
The basic approach of this method in attempting to solve a differential equation (say, two independent variables x and y) is to write the dependent variable u(x,y) as a product of functions of the separate variables u(x,t)= X(x)T(t) .
In many cases the partial differential equation reduces to ordinary equations for X and T. 3.3.1 Application to Wave Equation Let us consider the vibration of an elastic string governed by the one- dimensional wave equation ¶ 2u ¶ 2u =c2 (8) ¶ t2 ¶ x2 where u(x, y) is the deflection of the string.
Since the string is fixed at the ends x = 0 and x=l, we have the two boundary conditions u(0,t)=0, u(l,t)=0 for all t (9) The form of the motion of the string will depend on the initial deflection (deflection at t = 0) and on the initial velocity (velocity at t = 0).
Denoting the initial deflection by f(x) and the initial velocity by g(x), the two initial conditions are ¶ u u(x,0)= f(x) = g(x) (10) ¶ t t=0 This method expresses the solution of u(x,t) as the product of two functions with their variables separated, i.e.
U(x,t)=X(x)T(t) (11) where X and T are functions of x and t respectively.
6 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Substituting eq.
(11) in eq.
(8), we obtain XT¢ ¢ =c2 X¢ ¢ T or ¢¢ ¢¢ X (x) 1 T (t) = (12) X(x) c2 T(t) In other words ¢¢ ¢¢ X 1 T = =l (13) X c2 T The original PDE is then separated into two ODEs, viz.
X¢¢(x)- lX(x)=0 (14) and T¢ ¢(t)- lc2T(t)=0 (15) The boundary conditions given by eq.
(9) imply X(0)T(t) = 0 and X(l)T(t) = 0 Since T(t) is not identically zero, the following conditions are satisfied X(0) = 0 and X(l) = 0 (16) Thus eq.
(14) is to be solved subject to conditions given by eq.
(16).
There are 3 cases to be considered.
Case 1 l >0 The solution to eq.
(14) yields X(x) =Ae- lx +Be lx (17) To satisfy the boundary condition given by eq.
(16), we must have Ae- l l +Be l l = 0 Since the determinant formed by the coefficients of A and B is non-zero, the only solution is A = B = 0.
This yields the trivial solution X(x) = 0.
7 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Case 2 l =0 The solution to eq.
(14) yields X(x) =A+Bx To satisfy the boundary condition given by eq.
(16), we must have A=0 and A+Bl=0 implying A=0, B=0 Again for this case, a trivial solution is obtained Case 3 l <0 Letl =- k2.
The solution to eq.
(14) yields X(x) =Acoskx+Bsinkx (18) To satisfy the boundary condition given by eq.
(16), we must have A=0 and Bsinkl=0 To obtain a solution whereB„ 0, we must have kl=np n =1,2,...
Thus np 2 l =- k2=-   (19)  l  (n=0 corresponds to the trivial solution).
The specific values of l are known as the eigenvalues of eq.
(14) and the corresponding solutions, np  viz, sin x are called the eigenfunctions.
Since there are many  l  possible solutions, each is subscripted by n. Thus np  X (x)= B sin x n=1,2,3,... (20) n n  l  The solution to Eq.
(15) with l given by Eq.
(19) is np  np  T (t)= E cos ct+F sin ct n=1,2,3,... (21) n n  l  n  l  8 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Where E and F are arbitrary constants.
There are thus many solutions n n for eq.
(8) which is given by U (x,t)= X (x)T (t) n n n  np  np  np a cos ct+b sin ctsin x (22)  n  l  n  l  l Where a =B E and b =B F .
Since eq.
(8) is linear and homogeneous, n n n n n n the general solution is obtained as the linear superposition of all the solutions given by eq.
(22), i.e.
¥  npc npc  np U(x,t)=∑a cos t+b sin tsin x (23)  n l n l  l n=1 Differentiating with respect to t, we have ¥ npc npc npc  np U (x,t)=∑ - a sin t+b cos tsin x (24) t l  n l n l  l n=1 The coefficients a and b are obtained by applying the initial n n conditions in eq.

Thus, ¥ np U(x,0)= f(x)=∑a sin x (25) n l n=1 ¥ np  np U(x,0)=g(x)=∑b  csin x (26) n l  l n=1 In order to determine a and b we use the orthogonality properties of n n np sin xin the range 0£ x£ l, i.e.

(8) subject to the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.
3.3.2 Application to Heat Conduction Equation The one-dimensional heat flow in a rod bounded by the planes x = 0 and x = a is of practical interest.
The solution applies to the case where the y and z dimensions extend to infinity.
The temperature distribution is determined by solving the one-dimensional heat conduction equation ¶ 2q 1¶ q = (31) ¶ x2 v ¶ t Where q represents the temperature and k v= (32) Cr k, C and r are the thermal conductivity, specific heat and density of the material respectively.
We shall treat the case where the boundary conditions are given by q (x=0,t)=0 (33) 10 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I q (x=a,t)=0 (34) The initial temperature distribution is given by q (x,t =0)= f(x) (35) Solution: Using the method of separation of variables, the x-dependence and t-dependence are separated out as expressed by q (x,t)= X(x)T(t) (36) Substituting eq.
(36) into eq.
(31) yields 1 d2X 1 1 dT = =a (37) X dx2 vT dt We shall now consider three cases corresponding to different values of the constanta .
Case 1 l =0 The separated ODE for X(x) becomes d2X =0 (38) dx2 i.e.
X(x)= Ax+B The boundary conditions expressed by eqs.
(33) and (34) are respectively X(x=0)=0 and X(x=a)=0 (39) Since T(t) should not be identically zero.
Thus for eq.
(38) to satisfy the boundary conditions given by eq.
(39), we must have A = 0, B = 0.
This gives the steady-state solution where temperature in the rod is everywhere zero.
Case 2 l >0 Let a =k2.
The ODE for X becomes d2X =k2X (40) dx2 Therefore X(x)= Aekx +Be- kx Applying the boundary conditions given in eq.
(39), we get 11 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 0 = A + B 0= Aeka +Be- ka Again we have A = B = 0 Case 3 l <0 Let a =- l2.
The ODE for X(x) becomes d2X =- l2X (41) dx2 Thus X(x)= Acoslx+Bsinlx The boundary conditions require A = 0 Bsinla=0 (42) i.e.
la =np n=1, 2,... (43) Since there are multiple solutions, each l is designated by a subscript n as l .
The solution of the ODE for T(t) is readily obtained as n T(t)=Ce- l2nvt (44) Thus the general solution which is a superposition of all admissible solution is given by ¥ np q (x,t)=∑D e- l2nvtsin x (45) n a n=1 ¥  n2p 2  np =∑D exp- vtsin x (46)   n=1 n  a2  a To complete the solution D must be determined from the remaining n initial condition ¥ np i.e.
f(x)=∑D sin x (47) n a n=1 12 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I mp In order to determineD , we multiply eq.
(47) by sin x and integrate n a the limits x=0 and x = a to obtain a mp ¥ a np mp a ∫ f(x)sin xdx=∑D ∫a sin xsin xdx=D a n n a a m2 0 n=1 0 Thus 2 a mp D = ∫ f(x)sin xdx (48) m a a 0 For the specific case where f(x)=q (constant), the solution is given by 0 4q ¥ 1 (2n+1)px  v(2n+1)2p 2 q (x,t)= 0 ∑ sin exp-  p n=02n+1 a  a2  0 < x < a (49) From eq.
(49), it can be deduced that a rectangular pulse of height q for 0 0<x< a has the Fourier series expansion given by 4q ¥ 1 (2n+1)px 0 ∑ sin p 2n+1 a n=0 Also if f(x) =gx, then 2ag ¥ (- 1)n- 1 np   vn2p 2  q (x,t)= ∑ sin xexp- t (50) p n=1 n  a   a2  If the end boundaries are maintain at different temperature i.e.
q (x=0,t)=q 1 q (x=a,t)=q (51) 2 Then case 1 of the solution where a =0,would yield the steady-state x( ) solution given byq + q - q .
The general solution is given by 1 a 2 1 x( ) q (x,t)=f (x,t)+q + q - q (52) 1 a 2 1 Where f(x,t) is the transient solution.
13 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I The boundary conditions for f(x,t) are obtained as follows: at x = 0: q (x=0,t)=q =f(x=0,t)+q ⇒f(x=0,t)=0 1 1 at x = a: q (x=a,t)=q =f(x=a,t)+q ⇒f(x=a,t)=0 2 2 f(x,t) is obtained under case 3.

Laplace transforms can be used in solving boundary-value problems of partial differential equation.

For convenience, let ¥ [ ] U =U(x,p)= Lu(x,t) =∫e- ptu(x,t)dt 0 We then have ¶ 2U pU - u(x,0)=2L ¶ x2 from which we obtain, using the given conditions (54), ¶ 2U 1 - pU =3sin4px- 5sin2px.

These are the boundary conditions onU(x,p).

18 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 10.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Periodic Functions A function f(x)is said to be periodic if it defined for all real x and if there is some positive number T such that f(x+T)= f(x) (1) This number T is then called a period of f(x).
Periodic functions occur very frequently in many application of mathematics to various branches of science.
Many phenomena in nature such as propagation of water waves, light waves, electromagnetic waves, etc are periodic and we need periodic functions to describe them.
Familiar examples of periodic functions are the sine and cosine functions.
Example 1 Find the period of Tanx.
Solution: Suppose T is its period f(x+T)=Tan(x+T)=Tanx so that Tan(x+T)- Tanx=0 using trigonometric identity, we have TanT(1- Tan2x) =0 1- TanxTanT This implies that TanT =0 If and only if 1- Tan2x„ 0 T =Tan- 10 Hence T =p 3.2 Even and Odd Functions [ ] A function f(x) defined on interval a,b is said to be a even function if f(- x)= f(x) (2) 19 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I It is odd otherwise, that is f(- x)=- f(x) (3) Example 2 Let f(x)=sinx Then f(- x)=- f(x) i.e.
sin(- x)- =- sinx Thus it is obvious that sine function is always an odd function while cosine function is an even function.
3.11 Fourier Theorem According to the Fourier theorem, any finite, single valued periodic function f(x)which is either continuous or possess only a finite number of discontinuities (of slope or magnitude), can be represented as the sum of the harmonic terms as 1 f(x)= a +a cosx+a cos2x+...+a cosnx 2 0 1 2 n +b sinx+b sin2x+.

All other integrals on the right 0 are zero, as can be readily seen by performing the integration.
Hence our first result is 1 p a = ∫ f(x)dx (6) 0 2p - p We now determine a , a ,... by a similar procedure.
We multiply 1 2 Eq.
(5) by cosmx , where m is any fixed positive integer, and then integrate from - p to p , ∫p f(x)cosmxdx=∫p a +∑¥ (a cosnx+b sinnx)cosmxdx (7) - p - p  0 n n  n=1 Integrating term-by-term, we see that the right-hand side becomes a ∫p cosmxdx+∑¥ a ∫p cosnxcosmxdx+b ∫p sinnxcosmxdx 0 - p  n - p n - p  n=1 The first integration is zero.
By applying trigonometric identity, we obtain p 1 p 1 p ∫ cosnxcosmxdx= ∫ cos(n+m)xdx+ ∫ cos(n- m)xdx - p 2 - p 2 - p p 1 p 1 p ∫ sinnxcosmxdx= ∫ sin(n+m)xdx+ ∫ sin(n- m)xdx.
- p 2 - p 2 - p Integration shows that the four terms on the right are zero, except for the last term in the first line which equals p when n=m.
since in eq.
(7) this term is multiplied bya , the right-hand side in eq.
(7) is equal m toa p , and our second result is m 1 p a = ∫ f(x)cosmxdx m =1, 2... (8) m p - p We finally determine b b ...... in eq.
(5) by sinmx, where m is any fixed 1, 2, positive integer, and the integrate from - p to p , we have ∫p f(x)sinmxdx=∫p a +∑¥ (a cosnx+b sinnx)sinmxdx (9) - p - p  0 n n  n=1 Integrating term-by-term, we see that the right-hand side becomes 21 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I a ∫p sinmxdx+∑¥ a ∫p cosnxsinmxdx+b ∫p sinnxsinmxdx 0 - p  n - p n - p  n=1 The first integral is zero.
The next integral is of the type considered before, and we know that it is zero for all n = 1, 2,….
For the integral we obtain p 1 p 1 p ∫ sinnxsinmxdx= ∫ cos(n- m)xdx- ∫ cos(n+m)xdx - p 2 - p 2 - p The last term is zero.
The first term on the right is zero when n„ m and is p whenn=m.
Since in eq.
(9) this term is multiplied byb , the right- m hand side in eq.
(6) is equal to b p , and our last result is m 1 p b = ∫ f(x)sinmxdx m =1, 2... m p - p Writing n in place of m, we altogether have the so-called Euler formulas 1 p (a) a = ∫ f(x)dx 0 p - p 1 p (b) a = ∫ f(x)cosnxdx n =1, 2...

(10a) we obtaina =0.
This can also be seen without 0 integration since the area under curve of f(x) between - p and p is zero.

We write eq.
(12) in the form d2x dx +2K +w 2x(t)=G(t) (13) dt2 dt 0 G k F(t) Where K = , w 2 = and G(t)= .
The solution of the 2m 0 m m homogeneous part of eq.
(13) can be readily obtained and is given by [ ] ( ) x(t)= Ae=Ktcos w 2 - K2 t +q for w 2 > K2 (14) 1 0 0 x(t)=(A t+B)e- Kt for w 2 > K2 (15) 2 0 In order to obtain the solution of the inhomogeneous part of eq.
(13), we first assume F(t) to be a sine or cosine function; for definiteness we assume 24 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I G(t)=bsinw t (16) The particular solution of eq.
(13) can be written in the form x(t)=Csinw t+Dcosw t (17) The values of C and D can readily be obtained by substituting eq.
(17) in eq.
(13), and comparing coefficients of sinw tand cosw twe obtain 2w K D = - b ( ) w 2 - w 2 2 +4w 2K 2 0 (18) w 2 - w 2 C = - 0 b ( ) w 2 - w 2 2 +4w 2K 2 0 Now, if G(t) is not a sine or cosine function, a general solution of eq.
(13) is difficult to obtain.
However, if we make a Fourier expansion of G(t) then the general solution of eq.
(13) can easily be written down.
As a specific example, we assume G(t)=a t (19) The Fourier expansion of G(t)can readily be obtained as ¥ G(t)=∑b sinnw t (20) n n=1 Proceeding in a manner similar to that described above we obtained the following solution for the inhomogeneous part of eq.
(13) x(t)=∑¥ [C sinnw t+D cosnw t] (21) n n n=1 Where 2nw K D =- ( ) b n w 2 - n2w 2 2 +4n2w 2K2 n 0 (22) (w 2 - n2w 2) C =- ( 0 ) b n w 2 - n2w 2 2 +4n2w 2K2 n 0 thus, if G(t) is a periodic function with period T then eq.
(21) will be valid for all values of t. 3.14 Half-Range Expansions In various physical and engineering problems there is a practical need for applying Fourier series to functions f(t) which are defined merely 25 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I on some finite interval.
The function f(t) is defined on an interval 0<t<land on this interval we want represent f(t) by a Fourier series.
A half-range Fourier series for a function f(x) is a series consisting of the sine and cosine terms only.
Such functions are defined on an interval (0,l)and we then obtain a Fourier cosine series which represents an even periodic function f (t) of 1 period T =2lso that ¥ np f(t)=a +∑a cos t 0<t<l 0 n l n=1 (23) and the coefficients are a =1∫l f(t)tdt, a = 2∫l f(t)cosnp tdt n =1, 2... 0 l 0 n l 0 l (24) Then we obtain a Fourier sine series which represents an odd periodic function f (t) of period T =2lso that 2 ¥ np f(t)=∑b sin t 0<t<l n l n=1 (25) and the coefficients are b = 2∫l f(t)sinnp tdt n =1, 2... n l 0 l (26) The series in eqs.
(23) and (25) with the coefficients in eqs.
(24) and (26) are called half-range expansions of the given function f(t) Example 4 Find the half-range expansions of the function 2k l t when 0<t <   l 2 f(t)= 2k (l- t) when l <t <l   l 2 26 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Solution: From eq.

If f(x)satisfies the following conditions: (i) f(x)is periodic and of period 2L (ii) f(x)and f¢(x)are piecewise continuous ¥ (iii) ∫ f(x)dxis convergent, then f(x)can be expressed as - ¥ ¥ ( ) f(x)=∫ A(a )cosa x+B(a )sina x dx 0 (27) 1 ¥ A(a )= ∫ f(x)cosa xdx p - ¥ (28) 1 ¥ B(a )= ∫ f(x)sina xdx p - ¥ (29) 3.16 Fourier Integrals of Even and Odd Functions It is of practical interest to note that if a function is even or odd and can be represented by a Fourier integral, and then this representation will be simpler than in the case of an arbitrary function.

(28), also 2 ¥ B(a )= ∫ f(x)sina xdx p 0 (32) and ¥ f(x)=∫ B(a )sina xdx (f odd) (33) 0 These simplifications are quite similar to those in the case of a Fourier series discussed.

Also we shall consider some important integrals involving Legendre functions which are of considerable use in many areas of physics.
7.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able: • derive the polynomial solution of the Legendre equation • use the generating functions to derive some important identities • determine the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials.
33 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 8.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Legendre Equation The equation (1- x2y¢ ¢(x)- 2xy¢(x)+n(n+1)y(x)=0 (1) where n is a constant is known as the Legendre’s differential equation.
In this unit we will discuss the solutions of the above equation in the domain- 1< x<1.
We will show that when n=0,1, 2,3,... one of the solutions of eq.

These polynomial solutions are known as the Legendre polynomials, which appear in many diverse areas of physics and engineering.
3.6 The Polynomial Solution of the Legendre’s Equation If we compare eq.

Thus the point x = 0 is an ordinary point and a series solution of eq.

If n„ 0.
1, 2,... both eqs.
(4a) and (4b) are infinite series and converge only if x <1.
It may be readily seen that when n=0.2, 4,... 34 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I The even series becomes a polynomial and the odd series remains an infinite series.
Similarly for n=1, 3, 5,... the odd series becomes a polynomial and the even series remains an infinite series.
Thus when n=0, 1, 2, 3,... one of the solutions becomes a polynomial.
The Legendre polynomial, or the Legendre function of the first kind is denoted by P (x)and is n defined in terms of the terminating series as below: S (x) n for n=0, 2, 4, 6,...  S (1) P (x)= n (5) n Tn(x) for n=1,3, 5, 7,... T (1) n Thus, 1( ) P(x)=1, P(x)= x, P(x)= 3x2 - 1, 0 1 2 2 1( ) 1( ) P(x)= 5x3- 3x, P (x)= 35x4- 30x2 +3, (6) 3 2 4 8 1( ) P(x)= 63x5- 70x3+15x,... 5 8 Obviously, P (1)=1 (7) n Higher order Legendre polynomials can easily be obtained by using the recurrence relation nP (x)=(2n- 1)xP (x)- (n- 1)P (x) n n- 1 n- 2 Since for even values of n the polynomials P (x) contain only even n powers of x and for odd values of n the polynomials contain only odd powers of x, we readily have P (- x)=(- 1)nP (x) and obviously (8) n n P (- 1)=(- 1)n (9) n 3.7 The Generating Function The generating function for the Legendre polynomials is given by ¥ G(x,t)=(1- 2xt+t2)- 12 =∑P (x)tn; - 1£ x£ 1,t <1 (10) n n=0 35 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Let us assume that ¥ G(x,t)=(1- 2xt+t2)- 12 =∑K (x)tn (11) n n=0 Where K (x)is a polynomial of degree n. Putting x = 1 in eq.
(11), we n obtain ¥ ∑K (x)tn =(1- 2t+t2)- 12 n n=0 =(1- t)- 1 =1+t+t2 +t3 +...+tn + .
.. Equating the coefficients of tnfrom both sides, we have K (1)=1 (12) n Now, if we can show that K (x) satisfies eq.
(1), then K (x) will be n n identical to P (x).
Differentiating G(x, t) with respect to x and t, we n obtain ¶ G (1- 2xt+t2) =(x- t)G(x,t) (13) ¶ t and ¶ G ¶ G t =(x- t) (14) ¶ t ¶ x Using eqs.
(11), (13) and (14), we have ¥ ¥ (1- 2t+t2)∑nK (x)tn- 1 =(x- t)∑K (x)tn (15) n n n=0 n=0 and ¥ ¥ t∑nK (x)tn- 1 =(x- t)∑K¢ (x)tn (16) n n n=0 n=0 Equating the coefficient of tn- 1 on both sides of eqs.
(15) and (16), we get nK (x)- (2n- 1)xK (x)+(n- 1)K (x)=0 (17) n n- 1 n- 2 and xK¢ (x)- K¢ (x)=(n- 1)K (x) (18) n- 1 n- 2 n- 1 Replacing n by n+1 in Eq.
(18), we obtain xK¢ (x)- K¢ (x)=nK (x) (19) n n- 1 n We next differentiate Eq.
(17) with respect to x and eliminate K¢ with n- 2 help of Eq.
(18) to obtain 36 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I K¢ (x)- xK¢ (x)- nK (x)=0 (20) n n- 1 n- 1 If we multiply eq.
(19) by x and subtract it from eq.
(20), we would get (1- x2)K¢ - n(K - xK )=0 (21) n n- 1 n Differentiating the above equation with respect to x, we have (1- x2)K¢ ¢ - 2xK¢ - n(K¢ - xK¢ - K )=0 (22) n n n- 1 n n Using eqs.
(19) and (22), we obtain (1- x2)K¢ ¢ (x)- 2xK¢ (x)- n(n+1)K (x)=0 (23) n n n which shows that K (x)is a solution of Legendre equation.
In view of n eqs.
(7) and (12) and the fact that K (x)is a polynomial in x of degree n, n it follows that K (x)is nothing but P (x).
eq.

(25), we get df =2nx(x2 - 1)n- 1 dx or d2f df (1- x2) +2x(n- 1) +2nf =0 dx2 dx Differentiating the above equation n times with respect to x, we would get d2f df (1- x2) n +2x n +n(n+1)f =0 (26) dx2 dx n where [ ] dnf dn ( ) f = = x2 - 1n (27) n dxn dxn 37 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I This shows that f (x)is a solution of the Legendre’s equation.
Further, it n is obvious from eq.
(27) that f (x)is a polynomial of degree n in x. n Hence f (x)should be a constant multiple ofP (x), i.e.
n n [ ] ( ) dn x2 - 1n =CP (x) (28) dxn n [ ] dn (x2 - 1)n = dn [(x+1)n(x- 1)n] dxn dxn =n!

(31) Therefore 1 dn ( ) P (x)= x2 - 1n (32) n 2nn!dxn This is known as the Rodrigues formula for the Legendre polynomials.
For example 1 d2 ( ) P (x)= x2 - 12 2 222!dx2 1( ) = 3x2 - 1 2 Which is consistent with eq.

(34) by P (x)and eq.
(35) by P (x)and subtracting eq.
(35) m n from eq.
(34), we get d [ ( )] (1- x2) P¢ (x)P (x)- P¢ (x)P (x) dx n m m n =(m- n)(n+m+1)P (x)P (x) n m Integrating the above equation from x = -1 to x = 1, we get (1- x2)[(P¢ (x)P (x)- P¢ (x)P (x))]+1 n m m n - 1 =(m- n)(n+m+1)∫1 P (x)P (x)dx - 1 n m Because of the factor (1- x2)the left hand side of the above equation vanishes; hence ∫1 P (x)P (x)dx for m„ n - 1 n m To determine the value of the integral ∫1 P2(x)dx - 1 m we square both sides of eq.
(10) and obtain ¥ ¥ (1- 2xt+t2)- 1 =∑∑P (x)P (x)tm+n (36) m n m=0n=0 Integrating both sides of the above equation with respect to x from -1 to +1 and using eq.

We assume the 0 origin of our coordinate system to be at the centre of the sphere.
Because the sphere is a perfect conductor, the potential on its surface will be constant which, without any loss of generality, may be assumed to be zero.
Thus, eq.

46 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Bessel Differential Equation The equation d2y dy x2 +x (x2 - n2)y(x)=0 (1) dx2 dx Where n is a constant known as Bessel’s differential equation.
Since n2 appears in eq.
(1), we will assume, without any loss of generality, that n is either zero or a positive number.
The two linearly independent solutions of eq.
(1) are J (x) and J (x) n - n Where J (x)is defined by the infinite series n ¥ 1 xn+2r J (x)=∑(- 1)r   (2) n r!G (n+r+1)2 r=0 or xn  x2 x4  J (x)= 1- + - ... (3) n 2nG (n+1) 2(2n+2) 2.4(2n+2)(2n+4)  where G (n+r+1)represents the gamma function.
3.4 Series Solution and Bessel Function of the First Kind If we use eq.
(1) with the homogeneous, linear differential equation of the type y¢¢(x)+U(x)y¢(x)+V(x)y(x)= R(x) (4) we find the coefficients 1 n2 U(x)= and V(x)=1- x x2 are singular at x = 0.
However, x = 0 is a regular singular point of the differential equation and a series solution of eq.
(1) in ascending powers of x.
Indeed, one of the solutions of eq.
(1) is given by  x2 x4  J (x)=C xn1- + - ... (5) n 0  2(2n+2) 2.4(2n+2)(2n+4)  and where C is an arbitrary constant.
This solution is analytic at x = 0 0 for n‡ 0and converges for all finite values of x.
If we choose C =2nG (n+1) (6) 0 47 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I then the eq.

Next, we will examine eq.
(10) when n is a positive integer.
To be specific we assume n = 4; then the first, second, third and fourth terms in the series given by eq.
(10) will contain the terms 1 1 1 1 , , , and G (- 3) G (- 2) G (- 1) G (0) respectively and all these terms are zero.
In general the first n terms of the series would vanish giving ¥ (x 2)- n+2r J (x)=∑ (18) - n r!G (- n+r+1) r=n If we put r = k+n, we would obtain ¥ (x 2)n+2k J (x)=∑(- 1)k+n - n (k+n)!G (k+1) k=0 ¥ (x 2)n+2k =∑(- 1)k k!G (k+n+1) k=0 =(- 1)nJ (x) (19) n 49 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Thus for n=0, 1, 2, 3,.

The second independent solution will be discussed later.

(25) and (26) we get J (x)- J (x)=2J¢ (x) (28) n- 1 n+1 n Using eq.

When l is an odd integer, i.e.
when l = 2n+1; n =0, 1, 2,. .

(2) One of the solutions of eq.

These polynomial solutions are called Hermite polynomials.
Hermite polynomials appear in many diverse areas, the most important being the harmonic oscillator problem in quantum mechanics.
Using Frobenius method to solve eq.
(1), and following the various steps, we have Step1: We substitute the power series ¥ y(x)=∑C xp+r (3) r r=0 in eq.
(1) and obtain the identity C p(p- 1)+C (p+1)px+ 0 1 ¥ ∑[C (p+r)(p+r- 1)- C (2p+2r- 3- l )]xr =0 r r- 2 r=2 Step 2: Equating to zero the coefficients of various powers of x, we obtain (i) p =0 or p =1 (4a) (ii) p(p+1)C =0 (4b) 1 2p+2r- 3- l (iii) C = C for r ‡ 2 (4c) r (p+r)(p+r- 1) r- 2 When p =0, C becomes indeterminate; hence p = 0 will yield both the 1 linearly independent solutions of eq.
(1).
Thus, we get 2r- 3- l C = C for r ‡ 2 (5) r r(r- 1) r- 2 which gives 1- l C = C .

the even series becomes a polynomial and the odd series remains an infinite series.

One of the solutions becomes a polynomial.
If the multiplication constant C or C is chosen that the coefficient of the highest power of x 0 1 in the polynomial becomes 2n,then these polynomials are known as Hermite polynomials of order n and are denoted by H (x).
For example, n for l =9 (n=4), the polynomial solution  4  y(x)=C 1- 4x+ x4   0 3  If we choose C =12 0 the coefficient of x4 becomes 24and, therefore H (x)=16x4 - 48x2 +12 4 Similarly, for l =7 (n =3), the polynomial solution is given by  2  y(x)=C x- x3   1 3  66 PHY312 MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF PHYSICS I Choosing C = - 12 1 we get H (x)=8x3 - 12x 3 In general N n!

of the equation y¢¢(x)- 2xy¢(x)+2ny(x)=0 (19) Since, as discussed before, K (x)is also a polynomial of degree n (with n coefficient of xn equal to2n), K (x) is, therefore, nothing but H (x).

It shows that Laguerre polynomials and the associated functions arise in many branches of physics, e.g.
in the hydrogen atom problem in quantum mechanics, in optical fibers characterised by parabolic variation of refractive index, etc.
We also show that Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal in the interval 0£ x£ ¥ with respect to the weight functione- x.

It is also evident that the coefficient of t2 on the right hand side of eq.
(11) will be a polynomial of degree n and that the constant term in this polynomial will be unity.
We can then assume that 1  xt  ¥ G(x,t)= exp- =∑K (x)tn (12) 1- t  (1- t) n=0 n where K (x)is a polynomial of degree n. Differentiating eq.
