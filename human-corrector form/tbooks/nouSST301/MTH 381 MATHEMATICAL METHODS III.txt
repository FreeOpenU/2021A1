In scientific problems, often times are discovers that a factor depends upon several other related factors.
For instance, the area of solid depends on its length and breadth.
Potential energy of a body depends on gravity, density and height of the body e.t.c.
Moreover, the strength of a material depends on temperature, density, isotropy and softness e.t.c.

For instance, the area of rectangle depends on its length and breath, hence can say that area is the function of two variables i.e.
its length and breadth.
Potential energy of a body depends on gravity, density and height of the body, hence, we can also say that potential energy is a function of three variables i.e gravity, density and height etc.
The strength of a material depends upon temperature, density, isotropy softness etc., here we can say that the strength of material is a function of many variables i.e.
temperature, density, isotropy softness etc.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Functions of Several Variables A function is composed of a domain set, a range set and a rule of correspondence that assigns exactly one element of the range to each element of the domain u, is called a function of two variables x and y if u has one definite value for every pair of variables of x and y. Symbolically, it is written as u = f ( x, y) .
The variables x and y are called independent variables while u is called the dependent variable.
Similarly, we can define u as a function of more than two variables.
In summary, we have that u( x) ⇒ a function of a single variable u( x , x ) ⇒ a function of two variables 1 2 u( x , x , x ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ a function of several variables.

(a) f ( x, y) = x 2 − 3xy + 6 y f (−1,1) = (−1)2 − 3(−1)(1) + 6(1) f (−1,1) = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 (b) f (2,3) = 22 − 3(2)(3) + 6(3) f (2,3) = 4 − 18 + 18 = 4 2  MTH 381 MODULE 1 3.2 Jacobian Jacobian is a functional determinant (whose elements are functions) which is very useful in transformation of variables from Cartesian to polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates in multiple integras.
Let u(x,y) and v(x,y) be two given functions of two independent variables x and y.
The Jacobian of u and v with respect to x,y denoted by  u v  ∂(u, v) J  or is a second order functional determinant defined as  x y  ∂( x, y) ∂u ∂u J  u v  = ∂( u, v) = ∂x ∂y  x y  ∂( x, y) ∂v ∂v ∂x ∂y Properties of Jacobians If u and v are the functions of x and y, then ∂(u, v) ∂( x, y) x = 1 ∂( x, y) ∂(u, v) If u,v are the functions of r,s where r,s are functions of x, y, then, ∂(u, v) ∂(u, v) ∂(r, s) = x ∂( x, y) ∂(r, s) ∂( x, y) If functions u, v, w of three independent variables x,y,z are not ∂(u, v, w) independent, then, = 0 ∂( x, y, z) Example 2 ∂(u, v) Find the Jacobian in each of the following: ∂( x, y) y2 y2 (i) u = x + , v = x x (ii) u = x2 + y 2 , v = 2 xy 3  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Solution.

(i) 1 2 However, the two functions u( x) and v( x) defined on interval 0 < x < 1 are said to be functionally (linearly) independent on 0 < x < 1 , if the only constants k and k such that‘ ∃ ’ for all x in the interval where 1 2 both constants k and k are zeros i.e, when u or v can not be expressed 1 2 as proportional to the other.
Otherwise, u and v are linearly dependent if (i) holds for some k and k not both zero.
1 2 Example 5 Show that the functions v( x) = e ax and u( x) = ebx are linearly dependent on the interval.
0 < x < 1 .
Solution Suppose k e ax + k e bx = 0 ∀x in 0 < x < 1 (1) 1 2 Multiplying equation (1) by e − ax , we obtain k e ax e− ax + k e b x e − ax = 0 (2) 1 2 k + k e (b −a ) x = 0 (3) 1 2 differentiating equation (3) we obtain (b − a)k e (b −a ) x = 0 (4) 2 (b − a)e(b−a ) x ≠ 0 since b − a ≠ 0 then it implies that b = 0 (5) Substituting (5) into (1), and differentiating w.r.t.x, we obtain k ae ax = 0 (6) 1 a = 0 , since e ax ≠ 0.
⇒ 6  MTH 381 MODULE 1 Example 6 Show that the functions v( x) = e ax and u( x) = ebx are linearly independent on the interval.
0 < x < 1 .
Solution: If kea x + k xe ax = 0 (1) 1 2 (k + k x)e ax = 0 (2) 1 2 Since eax ≠ 0 , k + k x = 0 (3) 1 2 ⇒ Differentiating equation (3) we obtain k = 0 (4) 1 Substituting (5) into (1), however ke ax = 0 k = 0 .Since eax ≠ 0 (5) 1 1 ⇒ 3.3.1 Testing For Linear Dependence or Otherwise A method called Wronskian of the function could also be used to test for linear dependence or otherwise.
Thus, consider the functions u( x) and v( x) and the first derivatives u′( x) and v′( x) , therefore we can define the Wronski determinant or Wroskian.
: v( x) u( x) Wronskian = W (v( x).u( x)) = v′( x) u′( x) = v( x)u′( x) − u( x)v′( x) Results: v(x), u(x) are linearly independent if W ≠ 0 Otherwise linearly dependent when W=0.
Example 7 Determine whether the following functions v(x) and u(x) are linearly dependent or independent.
v(x) =cosbx, u(x) = sinbx with b ≠ 0 v(x) = eax , u( x) = e −ax with a ≠ 0 .
7  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Solution v( x) = cos bx , v′( x) = −b sin bx , u( x) = sin bx and u′( x) = cos bx .
v( x) u( x) cos bx sin bx (a) W (v( x).u( x)) = = v′( x) u′( x) − sin b b cos bx = b(cos2 bx + sin 2 bx) = b ≠ 0 So v(x) and u(x) are linearly independent.
v( x) = eax , v′( x) = −aeax , u( x) = e− ax and u′( x) = −ae−ax .
v( x) u( x) eax e− ax (b) W (v( x).u( x)) = = v′( x) u′( x) aeax − ae− ax = −ae0 − ae0 = −a(e0 + e0 ) With a ≠ 0 .
So v(x) and u(x) are linearly dependent.
SELFASSESSMENT EXERCISE Determine whether the following pair of functions are linearly dependent as the case may be i.
(a) u( x) = x, v( x) = e 2 x (b) u( x) = 2Sinhx, v( x) = Cosx (c) u( x) = x 3 , v( x) = 3x 3 ii.

Let f ( x, y) be a single valued continuous function within a region R bounded by a close curve C .
Then the region R is called The region of integration.

The basic concepts of differential calculus can be extended to vector function in a simple and natural fashion.
Vector functions are useful for representing and investigating curves and application in mechanics as path of moving bodies.
Integral theorems will be considered in the later path of this unit’s i.e Line Integral, Gauss, Stokes and Greens theorems.

Study of Line Integral, Gauss, Stokes and Greens theorems and their applications.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Vector Field Theory A scalar function is a function that is defined at each point of a certain set of points in space and whose values are real numbers depending only on the points in real space but not on the particular choice of the coordinate system.
Furthermore, the distance of f ( x, y, z) of any point p from a fixed point p in space is a scalar function whose domain of definition D is the 0 whole space.
f ( x, y, z) defines a scalar field in space.
Introducing a Cartesian coordinate x , y , z .
Then the distance 0 0 0 f ( x, y, z) = ( x − x ) 2 + ( y − y ) 2 + ( z − z ) 2 0 0 0 The temperature distribution in a heated body, density of a body and potential due to gravity are the examples of a scalar point function.
3.2 Relations between Vector Field and Functions A vector v( p) is a function that is defined on some point set D in space i.e.
the set of points of a curve, a surface or a three dimensional region and associates with each point p in D a vector v( p) .
While a vector field is given in D .
We introduce Cartesian coordinates x, y, z then we may write our vector function in terms of compound function.
v( x, y, z) = [v ( x, y, z), v ( x, y, z), v ( x, y, z)] 1 2 3 or using i, j, k ,.
Thus 18 MT H 381 MODULE 1 v( x, y, z) = v ( x, y, z)i + v ( x, y, z) j + v ( x, y, z)k 1 2 3 But we should keep in mind that v depends only on that points of its domain of definition, and at the point defines the same vector for every choice of the coordinate system.
The velocity of a moving fluid, gravitational force are the examples of vector point function.
Our notation in simple scalar and vector quantities in the pre-requisite course mathematical methods I and II are the same with that under discussion.
The only difference is that the components v , v , v of v now 1 2 3 becomes functions of x, y, z since v is a function of x, y, z .
3.2.1 Example of Vector Field (Velocity Field) At any instant, the velocity vectors v( p) of a rotating body B constitute a vector field, the so called velocity field of the rotation.
If we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system having the origin on the axis of rotations then v( x, y, z) = w × [z, y, z] = w × ( xi + yj + zk ) Fig.

2: Gravitational Field Fig.
3: A Rotating Body and the Corresponding Velocity Field 19  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III where x, y, z are the coordinates of any point p of B at the instant under consideration.
If the coordinates are such that the z-axis of rotation and w points in the positive direction, then w = wk and i j k v = 0 0 w = w(− yi + xj) = w[− y, x,0] x y z An example of a rotating body and the corresponding velocity field are shown in Fig.

Example of Vector Field (Field of Force) a.
If the velocity at any point (x,y,z) within a moving fluid is known at a certain time, then a vector field is defined.
b. v(x, y, z ) = xyi − yz 2 kj + x 2 zk defines a vector field.
A vector field which is independent of time is called a stationary steady-state vector field.
c. Let a particle A of mass M be fixed at a point p and let a particle 0 B of mass M to be free to take up various positions p in space.
Then A attracts B.
According to Newton’s Law of gravitation, the corresponding gravitational force p is directed from p to p , and 0 its magnitude is proportional to 1 where r is the distance r 2 between p and p say.
0 GM M d. p = A B r 2 where G is the gravitational constant.
Hence p defines a vector field in space.
If we introduce Cartesian coordinate such that p has the coordinates x , y , z and p has the 0 0 0 0 coordinates x, y, z , then by Pythagoras theorem.
r = ( x − x ) 2 + ( y − y ) 2 + ( z − z ) 2 (2) 0 0 0 Introducing the vector assuming r > 0 then r = ( x − x )i + ( y − y ) j + ( z − z )k (3) 0 0 0 ( ) we have r = r and − 1 is a unit vector in the direction of p ; the minus r sign indicates that p is directed from p + p .Fig.

Derivative of a Vector Function A vector function v(t ) is said to be differentiable at a point t if the limit exists.
The vector is called the derivative of v(t ) .
v(t + ∆t ) − v(t ) v′(t ) = lim ∆t →0 ∆t ) pt V1(t) + t V ( V (t) Partial Derivatives of a Vector Function The way of introducing partial derivation to vector analysis is obvious.
Indeed, let the components of a vector function.
v = v i + v j + v k be differentiable functions of 1 2 3 n variables t , t , t ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅t .
Then the partial derivative of v with respect to 1 2 3 n ∂v t is denoted by and is defined as the vector function.

Thus, we can define line integral as b ∫ f ( x)dx a 3.2.3 Evaluation of Line Integral Evaluation of line integral ∫ b f ( x)dx can be accomplished by two a methods.

This is obvious because surface integral is simpler and easier to handle compared to triple integral.
Therefore, let T be closed bounded in a region space whose boundary is a piecewise smooth orient table surface S. Let f ( x, y, z) be a vector function that is continuous and has continuous first partial derivative in some domain containing T. However, the transformation is done by the so called divergence theorem which involves the divergence of a vector function F. 23  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Where divergence of F ⇒ div F =  ∂F1+ ∂F2 + ∂F 3  dv = ∫∫ F ndA (2)  ∂x ∂y ∂z  s ⋅ But ∫∫ F ⋅ ndA =∫∫ (Fdydz + F dxdz + F dxdy ) (3) 1 2 3 s s Where ' n' is the outer unit normal vector of S. but F = Fi + F j + F k (4) 1 2 3 and n = Cosαi + Cosβj + Cosγk (5) where α , β , and γ are the angle between ' n' and the positive x, y, and z axes respectively.
Next, we substitute equation (3) and (4) into (2) so we can obtain ∫∫∫ ∂F 1 + ∂ F2 + ∂ F3 dxdydz = ∫∫ (F Cosαi + F Cosβj + F Cosγk )dA (6) T  ∂x ∂y ∂z  S 1 2 3 But Cosα = dzdy, Cosβ = dzdx, Cosγ = dxdy  ∂F ∂F ∂F  ∴ ∫∫∫ 1+ 2 + 3 cdz = ∫∫ Fdydz + F dxdz + F dydx (7) T  ∂x ∂ y ∂ z  S 1 2 3 Example 2 Application of the Divergence Theorem Harmonic Function The theory of solution of Laplace gives thus: ∂F ∂F ∂F ∇ 2 f = 1 + 2 + 3 = 0 (8) ∂x ∂y ∂z and equation (1) is called potential theory.
Now, from the divergence theorem formula divFdv = f ⋅ ndA (9) ∫∫∫ ∫∫ T S 24  MTH 381 MODULE 1 Where F = ∇f (10) is gradient of scalar function.
divF = ∇ 2 f (11) and F ⋅ n = n ⋅ ∇f Hence, ∂f (12) ∇ 2 fdv = dA ∫∫∫ ∫∫ ∂ n T S Where n ⋅ = ∂ f dA (13) ∂ n gradf we denote the directional derivative of f in the outer normal direction of ∂ f S by ∂ n However, ∂ f ⋅ n ≡ n ⋅ ≡ ⋅ (14) dA ∇f f ∂ n 3.3.2 Green’s Theorem This theorem gives the relation between the integral over the boundary surface which encloses the volume.

Then from equation (1) ∂ F ∂ F (∆ xF )⋅ n = (∆ xF )⋅ k = 2 − 1 ∂ x ∂ x Then the formula in Stoke’s theorem now takes the form ∫∫  ∂F2− ∂F 1 dA = ∫ (Fdx + F dy )  ∂x ∂x  1 2 S C Hence, Green’s theorem in space is s special case of Stoke’s theorem.

Solution As a surface S bounded by C we can take the plane circular disc x 2 + y 2 = 4 in the plane z = −3.
Then n in Stoke’s theorem points in the positive z-direction; thus n=k,.
Hence (∆xF )⋅ n is simply the component of curl (∆xF ) in the positive z-direction.
Since F with z = −3 has the components F = y, F = −27 x and F = 3 y 3 , we thus 1 2 3 obtain (∆ xF )⋅ n =∂ F ∂ F2 = 17 − 1 = 128 − 1 ∂ x ∂ x Hence, the integral over S in Stoke’s theorem equals 128times the area 4 π of the disk S. [(∆ xF )⋅ = −28 ⋅ = −112π ∴ n]4π 4π = −352 4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, the students must have understood vector field theory and also be able to relate vector field and vector function together respectively.
However, the Line Integral, Gauss’s, Stoke’s, and Green’s theorem were discussed using the knowledge acquired from vector field theory.

Examples: the points on a line, the solution of quadratic equation and the points in the interior of a circle made up of sets respectively.
A set is called open if every point of S has a neighbourhood consisting entirely of points that belongs to S. that is the points in the interior of a circle or a square from an open set, and so do the points of the “right half – plane” Re z = 0 > 0 .
An open set S is to be connected if any two of its points can be joined by a broken line of finitely many straight line segments all of where points belong to S. Likewise, an open connected set is called a domain.
Thus, an open disk annulus is domain.
An open square with a diagonal removed is not a domain since this set is not connected.
The complement of a set S in the complex plane is defined to be the set of all points of the complex plane that do not belong to S. A set is said to be closed if its complements is open.
Example: the point on and inside the unit circle form a closed set.
A boundary point of a set S is a point every neighbourhood of which contains both points that belong to S and points that do not belong to S. Example: if a set S is open, then no boundary point belongs to S, if S is closed, then every boundary point belongs to S. A region is a set consisting of a domain plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points.
Next we shall consider functions of complex variables but before this we introduce complex functions first.
Complex functions Definition: A real function F defined on a set S of real numbers is a rule that assigns to every X in S a real number f(x), called the value of f at x.
Now in complex, S is a set of complex numbers and a function f 32  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III defined on S is a rule that assigns to every Z in ρ a complex number w, called the value of f at z. we write w = f ( z) Here z varies in S and is called a Complex Variable.
The set S is called the domain of definition of f. Example 1 w = f ( z) = z 2 + 3z is a complex function defined for all z; that is, its domain S is the whole complex plane.
The set of all values of a function f is called the range of f. w is a complex, and we write w = u + iv, where u and v are the real and the imaginary parts, respectively.
Now w is depends on z = x + iy.
Hence, u becomes a real function of x and y. and so does v. we may thus write: w = f ( z) = u(x, y )+ iv( x, y).
This shows that a complex function f(z) is equivalent to a pair of real functions u(x,y) and v(x,y), each depending on the two real variables x and y.
Example 2 Function of a complex variable.
Let w = z 2 + 3z.
Find u and v and calculate the values of f at z = 1 + 3i and z = 2 – i.
Let the real part of w be defined thus u = x 2 − y 2 + 3x and the imaginary part of w i.e.
v = 2xy + 3 y.
∴ f (1+ 3i) = (1+ 3i) 2 + 3(1+ 3i) = − 5 +15i Recall that i2 = -1.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • complex numbers • complex analytical function • Cauchy – Riemann equation 33 MT H 381 MODULE 2 • Cauchy’s theorem and inequality • integral transforms vis a vis: Fourier and Laplace transforms • convolution theory and their applications.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Complex Numbers It was observed early in history that there are equations which are not satisfied by any real number.
Examples are: x 2 = − 3 or x 2 −10x + 40 = 0 This led to the invention of complex numbers.
Definition A complex number z is an ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers x, y and we write z = ( x, y).
We call x the real part of z and y the imaginary part of z and write Re z = x, lm z = y Example 3 Re (4, -3) = 4 and lm (4, -3) = -3, furthermore, we defined two complex numbers z = (x , y ) and z = (x , y ) to be equal if and only if their real 1 1 1 2 2 2 parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.
z = z if and only if x = x and y = y .
1 2 1 2 1 2 Addition of complex numbers z = (x , y ) and z = (x , y ) is defined by 1 1 1 2 2 2 1. z + z = ( x , y ) + (x , y ) = (x + x , y + y ) 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 Multiplication of complex numbers z = (x , y ) and z = (x , y ) is 1 1 1 2 2 2 defined by 2. z z = ( x , y )(x , y ) = (x x − y y , x y + x y ) 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 We shall say more about these arithmetic operations and discuss examples below, but we first want to introduce a much more convenient form of writing them as points in the plane.
34  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 3.1.1 Representation in the Form z = x + iy A complex number whose imaginary part is zero is of the form (x, 0).
For such numbers we simply have (x , 0)+ (x , 0)= (x + x , 0) 1 2 1 2 and (x , 0)(x , 0)= (x x ,0) 1 2 1 2 as for the real numbers.
This suggests that we identify (x, 0) with the real number x. hence the complex number system is an extension of the real number system.
The complex number (0,1) is denoted by i. i = (o,1) and is called the imaginary unit.
We show that it has the property.
3. i 2 = − 1 Indeed, from (2) we have i 2 = (0.1)(0.1) = (−1,0) = − 1 futheremore, for every real y we obtain from (2) iy = (0,1)(y,0)= (0, y ) Combining this with the above x = (x, 0) and using (1), that is, (x, y )= (x, 0)+ (0, y ), We see that we can write every complex number z = (x, y) in the form z = x + iy or z = x + yi.
This is done in practice almost exclusively.

It is of great importance in applications.
This idea is quite simple and natural.
We choose two perpendicular coordinate axes, the horizontal x – axis, called the real axis, and the vertical y – axis called the imaginary axis.
On both axes we choose the same unit of length (Fig.
4).
This is called a Cartesian coordinate system.
We now plot z = (x, y) = x + iy as the point P with coordinates x, y.
The xy – plane in which the complex numbers are represented in this way is called the complex plane or Argand diagram.
Figure 5 shows an example.
Instead of staying “the point represented by z in the complex plane” we say briefly and simply “the point z in the complex plane” this will cause no misunderstandings.

5: The number 4 – 3i in the Complex Plane 3.1.3 Arithmetic Operations We can make use of the notations z = x + iy and of the complex plane.
Addition of the sum of z = x + iy and z = x + iy can now be written 1 1 1 2 2 2 4. z1 + z2 = (x1 + iy1 ) + (x2 + iy2 ) .
z + z = (x + x )+ (iy + iy ) = (x + x )+ i (y + y ) 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 Example 5 (5 + i)+ (1+ 3i )= (5 + 1) + (i + 3i) = 6 + 4i .
We see that addition of complex numbers is in accordance with the “parallelogram law” by which forces are added in mechanics.
36  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Subtraction is defined to be the inverse operation of addition.
That is the difference z = z − z .
1 2 5. z − z = (x − x )+ i (y − y ) .
1 2 1 2 1 2 Example 6 (5 + i ) − (1+ 3i ) = (5 − 1) + (i − 3i) = 4 − 2i Multiplication: The Product z z in (2) can now be written 1 2 6. z1 z2 = (x1 + iy1 )(x2 + iy2 ) = x1 (x2 + iy2 ) + iy1 (x2 + iy2 ) = (x x − y y ) + i(x y + x y ) 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 This is easy to remember since it is obtained formally by the rules of arithmetic for real numbers and using (3), that is i 2 = − 1 Example 7 (5 + i )(1+ 3i) = 5 + 15i + i + 3i 2 = 2 +16i Division is defined to be the inverse operation of multiplication.
That is, the quotient z = z z is the complex number z = x + iy for which 1 / 2 7. z1 = zz2 = (x + iy )(x2 + iy2 ) (z 2 ≠ 0).
We show that for z ≠ 0 the qutotient z = x + iy = z / z is given by 2 1 2 8. z = z1 = x1 + iy1 = (x1+ iy1 )(x2 − iy2 ) z x + iy (x + iy )(x − iy ) 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 where (x2 − iy2 ) is the conjugate of (x + iy ) 2 2 x x + y y x y − x y = 1 2 1 2 + i 2 1 1 2 x 2 + y 2 x 2 + y 2 2 2 2 2 Example 8 If z = 9 – 8i and z = 5 + 2i, then 1 2 z = z1 = 9 − 8i1 = (9 − 8i)(5 − 2i) z 5 + 2i (5 +2 i)(5 − 2i) 2 1 38 MT H 381 MODULE 2 45 − 18i − 40i − 16 29 − 58i = = = 1− 2i.
25 + 4 29 The reader may check this result by showing that zz = (1 − 2i)(5 + 2i ) = 9 − 8i = z .
2 1 3.1.4 Properties of the Arithmetic Operations From the familiar laws for real numbers we obtain for any complex numbers z , z , z , z the following laws (where z = x +iy): 1 2 3 z1 + z2 = z 2 + z1 ………..commutative law of addition z z = z z ……………… commutative law of multiplication 1 2 2 1 (z1 + z2 ) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3 ) ...associative law of addition (z1 z2 )z3 = z1 (z2 z3 )……………………associative law of multiplication 9. z1 (z2 + z3 ) = z1 z2 + z1 z3 ……distributive law 0 + z = z + 0 = z z + (− z ) = (− z ) + z = + z − z = 0 z .
1 = z 3.1.5 Complex Conjugate Numbers Let z = x + iy be any complex number.
Then x – iy is called the conjugate of z and is denoted by z , thus, z = x + iy, z = x − iy.
Example 9 The conjugate of z = 5 + 2 i is z = 5 − 2i .
y z = x + iy = 5 + 2i 2 x 5 - 2 z = x − iy = 5 − 2i 37  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Fig.
6: Complex Conjugate Numbers 38 None MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Conjugates are useful since z z = x 2 + y 2 is real, a property we have used in the above division.
Moreover, addition and subtraction yields z + z = 2 x, z − z = 2iy, so that we can express the real part and the imaginary part of z by the important formulas.

Re z = x = z + z , lm z = y = z − z 2 2i Example 10 If z = 6 – 5i, then we have z = 6 + 5i and from (10) we obtain 1 x = (6 − 5i + 6 + 5i ) = 6 and 2 1 1 y = (6 − 5i − 6 − 5i) = (0 − 10i) 2i 2i −10i = = − 5 2i z is real if and only if y = 0, hence z = z by (10).
z is said to be pure imaginary if and only if x = 0, hence z = -z.
Then working with conjugates is easy, since we have (z + z ) = z + z , (z − z ) = z − z 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 11.
 z  z (z z ) = z z ,  1 = 1 1 2 1 2  z2 z  2  In this section we were mainly concerned with complex numbers, their arithmetic operations and their representation as points in the complex plane.
The next section we shall discuss the use of polar coordinates in the complex plane and situations in which polar coordinates are advantageous.
3.2 Polar Form of Complex Number Powers and Roots It is often practical to express complex numbers z = x + iy in terms of polar coordinates r, θ, these are defined by: 1. x = r cosθ , y = r sin θ By substituting this we obtain the polar form of z, 2. z = r cosθ + ir sin θ = r(cosθ + i sin θ ) 39 MT H 381 MODULE 2 r is called the absolute value or modulus of z and is denoted by z .Hence 3. z = r = x 2 + y 2 = z z Geometrically, z is the distance of the point z from the origin (Fig.
7).
Similarly, z − z is the distance between z and z (Fig.
301).
1 2 1 2 θ is called the argument of z and is denoted by arg z. thus (Fig.

(Why?)
For given z ≠ 0 it is determined only up to integer multiples of 2π.
The value of θ that lies in the interval – π < θ ≤ π is called the principal value of the argument of z (≠ 0) and is denoted by Arg.
z.
Thus θ = Arg z satisfies by definition.
− π < Arg z ≤ π.
40  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Polar Form of Complex Numbers Principal Value Example 11 Let z = 1 + I (cf.
Fig.
9).
Then  π π  π z = 2  cos + i sin , z = 2, arg z = ± 2nπ (n = 0,1, ........0. )
 4 4  4 The principal value of the argument is arg z = π/4, other values are - 7π/4, 9π/4, etc.
Example 12  π π  Let z = 3 + 3 i , then z =6cos + i sin , the absolute value of z is z = 6,  3 3  and the principal value of arg z is Arg z = π/3.
Caution!
In using (4), we must pay attention to the quadrant in which z lies, since tan θ has period π, so that the arguments of z and –z have the same tangent.
Example: for θ = arg (1+i) and θ = arg (-1 – i) 1 2 we have tan θ = tan θ = 1.
1 2 Triangle Inequality For any complex numbers we have the importance triangle inequality 5. z1 + z 2 ≤ z1 + z 2 ( Fig .
303 ) Which we shall use quite frequently, this inequality follows by nothing that y z + z 1 2 z 2 z1 x Fig 10: Triangle Inequality The three points 0, z and z + z are the vertices of a triangle (fig.
10) 1 1 2 with sides z1 , z 2 and z1 + z 2 , and the side cannot exceed the sum of the other two sides.
A formal proof is left to the reader (Prob.45).
41 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Example 13 If z = 1 + i and z = -2 + 3i, then 1 2 z + z = − 1+ 4i = 17 = 4.123 ∠ 2 + 13 = 5.020.
1 2 By induction the triangle inequality can be extended to arbitrary sums: 6. z1 + z2 + ..... + zn ≤ z1 + z2 + ... + zn ; That is, the absolute value of a sum cannot exceed the sum of the absolute values of the terms.
3.2.1 Multiplication and Division in Polar Form This will give us a better understanding of multiplication and division.
Let: z1 = r1 (cos θ1 + i sin θ1 and z2 = r2 (cosθ 2 + i sin θ 2 ). )
Then, by (6), sec.
12.1, the product is at first z z = rr [(cosθ cosθ − sin θ sin θ ) + i(sin θ cosθ + cosθ sin θ 2)].
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 The addition rules for the sine and cosine (6) in appendix 3.1) now yield 7. z1 z2 = r1 r2 [cos (θ1 + θ 2 ) + i sin (θ1 + θ 2 )] Taking absolute values and arguments on both sides, we thus obtain the important rules 8. z1 z 2 = z1 z2 and 9. arg (z1 z2 ) = arg z1 + arg z 2 (up to multiples of 2π ).
z We now turn to division.
The quotient z = 1 is the number z satisfying z 2 zz2 = z1.
Hence zz2 = z z2 = z1 , arg (zz2 ) = arg z + arg z2 = arg z1 .
This yield z z 10. z 1 = z 1 (z 2 ≠ 0) 2 2 42  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III and z 11. arg z1 = arg z1 − arg z 2 (up to multiples of 2π ).
2 By combining these two formulas (10) and (11) we also have z r 12. z1 = r1 [cos (θ1 − θ 2 ) + i sin (θ1 −θ 2 )].
2 2 Example 13 Illustration of Formulas (8) – (11) Let z = − 2 + 2i and z = 3i.
Then z z 1 2 1 2 = − 6 − 6i, z / z = 2 / 3 + (2i / 3) 1 2 and for the arguments we obtain Arg z = 3π/4, Arg z = π/2.
1 2 − 3π Arg z1 z2 = = Arg z1 + Arg z2 − 2π 4 π Arg (z1 / z2 ) = 4 = Arg z1 − Arg z 2 Integer power of z From (7) and (12) we have z 2 = r 2 (cos 2θ + i sin 2θ ), z −2 = r −2 [cos (− 2θ ) + i sin (− 2θ )] and more generally, for any integer n, 13. z n = r n (cos nθ + i sin nθ ).
Example 14 Formula of De Moivre For z = r = 1, formula (3) yields the so – called formula of De Moivre (13*) (cosθ + i sin θ )n = cos nθ + i sin nθ .
This formula is useful for expressing cos nθ in terms of cos θ and sin θ.
For instance when n = 2 and we take the real and imaginary parts on both sides of (13*), we get the familiar formulas.
43 MT H 381 MODULE 2 cos 2θ = cos 2 θ − sin 2 , sin 2θ = 2 cosθ sin θ .
3.2.2 Roots If z = w n (n = 1, 2,...), then to each value of w there corresponds one value of z, we shall immediately see that to a given z ≠ 0 there correspond precisely n distinct values of w. each of these values is called an nth root of z, and we write: 14. w = n z .
Hence this symbol is multivalued, namely, n – valued, in contrast to the usual conventions made in real calculus.
The n value of n z can easily be determined as follows.
In terms of polar forms for z and w = R(cos φ + i sin φ ), The equation wn = z becomes wn = R n (cos nφ + i sin nφ )= z = r(cosφ + i sin θ ) By equating the absolute values on both sides we have R n = r, thus R = n r Where the root is real positive and thus uniquely determined.
By equating the arguments we obtain θ 2kπ nφ = θ + 2kπ , thus φ = + n n Where k is an integer.
For k = 0,1, …, n – 1 we get n distinct values of w. further integers of k would give values already obtained.
For instance, k = n gives 2kπ/n = 2π, hence the w corresponding to k = 0, etc.
consequently, n z , for z ≠ 0, has the n distinct values 15. n z = n r  cos θ + 2kπ + i sin θ + 2kπ  k = 0,1,... n −1.
 n n  These n values lie on a circle of radius n r with center at the origin and constitute the vertices of a regular polygon of n sides.
The value of n z obtained by taking the principal value of arg z and k = 0 in (15) is called the principal value of w = n z 44  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Example 15 Square Root From (15) it follows that w = z has the two values  θ θ  16a.

w2 = r  cos + π  + i sin + π = − w1      2   2  Which lie symmetric with respect to the origin.
For instance, the square  π π  ( ) root of 4i has the values 4i ± 2  cos + i sin = ± 2 + i 2 .
 4  4  From (16) we can obtain the much more practical formula  1  1  17. z = ± ( z ) + x  + (sign y )i ( z − x)   2  2    Where sign y = 1 if y ≥0, sign y = - 1 if y < 0, and all square toots of positive numbers are taken with the positive sign.
This follows from (16) if we use the trigonometric identities.

These are the roots of the 2 2 equation w3 = 1.
Example 18 nth Root of Unity Solve the equation zn = 1.
Solution From (15) we obtain 2kπ 2kπ 18. n 1 = cos + i sin = e 2 kπi / n k = 0,1, ...., n − 1. n n 47  MTH 381 MODULE 2 If w denotes the value corresponding to k = 1, then the n values of n 1 can be written as 1, w, w2, …, wn – 1.
These values are the vertices of a regular polygon of n sides inscribed in the unit circle, with one vertex at the point 1.
Each of these n values is called an nth root of unity.
For instance, 4 1 has the values 1, i, -1 and –i (Fig.
12 shows 5 1 ).
If w is 1 any nth root of an arbitrary complex number z, then the n values of n z are w1, w1w, w1w2, ….

5 1 The student should be familiar with the problems related to the polar representation with particular care, since we shall need this representation quite often in our work.
In the next section, we discuss some curves and regions in the complex plane which we shall also need in the chapters on complex analysis.
3.3 Curves on Regions in the Complex Plane In this section we consider some important curves and regions and some related concepts we shall frequently need.
This will also help us to become more familiar with the complex plane.
The distance between two points z and a is z − a .
Hence a circle C of radius ρ and center at a (fig.
14) can be represented by; 1. z − a = ρ.
In particular, the so-called unit, that is the circle of radius 1 and center at the origin a = 0 (fig.
308), is given by; z = 1.
Furthermore, the inequality 48  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 2. z − a < ρ holds for every point z inside C: that is, (2) represents the interior of C. Such a region is called a circular disk or, more precisely, an open circular disk, in contrast to the closed circular disk.
z − a ≤ ρ.
This consists of the interior of C and C itself.
The open disk (2) is also called a neighborhood of the point a.
Obviously, a has infinitely many such neighborhoods, each of which corresponds to a certain value of p (> 0); and a belong to each of these neighborhoods, that is a, is a point of each of them.
y y ρ x 1 x Fig 15.
Unit Circle Fig 14.

Such a region is called an open circular ring or open annulus (Fig.

Solution: the inequality is valid precisely for all z whose distance from a = 3 – i does not exceed 4.
Hence this is a closed circular disk of radius 4 with center at 3 – i.
Example 20 Unit Circle and Unit Disk Determine each of the regions (a) z < 1 (b) z ≤1 (c) z > 1.
Solution (a) The interior of the unit circle.
This called the open unit disk.
(b) The unit circle and its interior.
This is called the closed ad disk.
(c) The exterior of the unit circle.
By the (open) upper half we mean the set of all points z = x + iy such that y > 0 .
Similarly, the condition y < 0 defines the lower half – plane, x > 0 the right half – plane and x < 0 the left half – plane.
3.3.1 Some Concepts Related to Sets in the Complex Plane We finally list a few concepts that are of general interest and will be used in our further work.
The term set of points in the complex plane means any sort of collection of a quadratic equation.
The points on a line and the points in the interior of a circle are sets.
A set S is called open, if every point of S has a neighborhood consisting entirely of points that belong to S. for example, the neighborhood consisting entirely of points that belong to S. For example, the points in the interior of a circle or a square form an open set, and so do the points of the “right half – plane” Re z = x > 0.
50 NoneMT H 381 MODULE 2 An open set S is said to be connected if any two of its points can be joined by a broken line of finitely many straight line segments all of whose points belong to S. an open connected set is called a domain.
Thus an open disk (2) and an open annulus (3) are domains.
An open square with a diagonal removed is not a domain since this set is not connected.
(Why?).
The complement of a set S in the complex plane is defined to be the set of all points of the complex plane that do not belong to S. A set is called closed if its complement is open.
For example, the points on and inside the unit circle form a closed set (“closed unit disk” cf.
example 2) since its complement z > is open.
A boundary point of a set S is points every neighbourhood of which contains both points that belong to S and points that do not belong to S. For example; the boundary points of an annulus are the points on the two bounding circles.
Clearly, if a set S is open, then no boundary point belongs to S; is closed, and then every boundary point belongs to S. A region is a set of a domain plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points.
(The reader is warned that some authors use the term “region” for what we call a domain (following the modern standard terminology) and others make no distinction between the two terms.)
So far, we have been concerned with complex numbers and the complex plane (just as at the beginning of calculus, one talks about real numbers and the real line).
In the next section, we start doing complex calculus: we introduce complex functions and derivatives.
This will generalise familiar concepts of calculus.

4 z − 4 3.4 Limit, Derivative and Analytic Functions The functions with which complex is concerned are complex functions that are differentiable.
Hence, we should first say what we mean by a complex function and then define the concepts of limit and derivative in complex.
This discussion will be quite similar to that in calculus.
3.4.1 Complex Function Recall from the calculus that a real function f defined on a set S of real numbers (usually an interval) is a rule that assigns to every x in S a real number f(x) called the value of f at x.
Now in complex, S is a set of complex numbers.
And a function f defined on S is a rule that assigns to every z in S a complex number w, called the value of f at z. write w = f ( z) Here z varies in S and is called a complex variable.
The set S is called the domain of definition of f. Example 21 w = f ( z) = z2 + 3z is a complex function defined for all z; that is, its domain S is the whole complex plane.
The set of all values of a function f is called the range of f. W is complex, and we write w = u + iv, where u and v are the real and imaginary parts, respectively.
Now w depends on z = x + iy.
Hence u becomes a real function; of x and y, and so does v. We may thus write: w = f (z ) = u(x, y ) + iv (x, y ).
This shows that a complex function f(z) is equivalent to a pair of real functions u(x,y) and depending on the two real variables x and y.

0 Formally, this definition is similar to that in calculus, but there is a big difference.
Whereas in the real line, here, by definition, z may approach z from any direction in the complex plane.
This will be quite essential 0 in what follows.
If a limit exists, it is unique.

0 z → z0 Note that by the definition of a limit this implies that f(z) is defined in some neighbourhood of z .
0 f(z) is said to be continuous in a domain if it is continuous at each point of this domain.
3.4.3 Derivative The derivative of a complex function f at a point z is written f ' ( z ) 0 0 and is defined by f (z + ∆z ) − f ( z ) 4. f ' ( z ) = lim 0 0 0 ∆z → 0 ∆z provided this limit exists.
Then f is said to be differentiable at z .
if we 0 write ∆z = z − z we also have 0 (4’) f ' ( z) = lim f ( z) − f ( z0 ) z → z0 z − z0 Remember that this definition of a limit implies that f(z) is defined (at least) in a neighborhood of z .
Also by that definition, z may approach z 0 0 from any direction.
Hence differentially at z means that, along whatever 0 path z approaches z , the quotient in (4’) always approaches a certain 0 53 MT H 381 MODULE 2 value and all these values are equal.
This is important and should be kept in mind.
Example 24 Differentiability Derivatives The function f(z) = z 2 is differentiate for all z and has the derivative f ′( z) = 2 z because ( z + ∆z ) 2 − z f ' ( z) = lim = 2z.

Hence, by equation of (5) at ∆z → 0 does not exit at any z.
This example may be surprising, but it merely illustrates that differentiability of a complex function is a rather serve requirement.
The idea of proof approach form different directions is based and will be discussed again in the next section.

18: Paths in (5) 3.4.1 Analytic Functions These are the functions that are differentiable in some domain, so that we can do “calculus in complex.” They are the main concern of complex analysis.
Their introduction is our main goal in this section; Definition (Analyticity) A function f(z) is said to be analytical in a domain D if f(z) is defined and differentiable at all points of D. The function f(z) is said to be analytic at a point z = z0 in D if f(z) is analytic in a neighbourhood (cf.
sec.
12.3) of z .
0 Also, by analytical function we mean a function that is analytical in some domain.
Hence, analytical of f(z) at z means that f (z) has a derivative at every 0 point in some neighbourhood of z (including z itself since, by 0 0 definition, z is a point of all its neighbourhood).
This concept is 0 motivated by the fact that it is of no practical interest when a function is differentiable merely at a single point z but not throughout some 0 neighbourhood of z .
Problem 28 gives an example.
0 An older term for analytical in D is regular in D, and a more modern term is holomorphic in D. Example 26 Polynomids Rational Functions The integer power 1, z, z2, … and more generally, polynomials, that is function of the form f ( z) = c + c z + c z 2 + ...c z n 0 1 2 n Where c and i=1,2,3….
are complex constants, are analytical in the i, entire complex plane.
The quotient of two polynomials g(z) and h(z).
55 MT H 381 MODULE 2 g ( z) f ( z) = .
h ( z) is called a rational function.
This f is analytic except at the points where h(z)= 0 here we assume that common factors of g and h have been cancelled partial fractions c (c ≠ 0) ( z − z )m 0 (c and z complex, m is a positive integer) are special rational functions, 0 they are analytic except at z .
It is in algebra that every rational function 0 can be written as a sum of a polynomial (which may be 0) and finitely partial fractions.
The concepts discussed in this section extend familiar concepts of calculus.
Most important is the concept of an analytic function.
Indeed, complex analysis is concerned exclusively with analytic functions and although many will yield a branch of mathematics, that is most beautiful from the theoretical point of view and most useful for practical purposes.
Before we consider special analytic functions (exponential functions, cosine, sine etc.)
let us give equations by means of which we can readily decide whether a function is analytic or not.
These are the famous Cauchy–Riemann equation, which we shall discuss in the next section.
3.5 Cauchy – Riemann Equations We shall now derive a very important criterion (a test) for the analyticity of a complex function.
w = f ( z) = u( x, y) + i( x, y).
Roughly, f is analytic in a domain D if and only if the first partial derivatives of u and v satisfy the two equations 1. u = u u = − v .
2 y , y 2 Everywhere in D, here u = ∂ u , u = ∂u and similarly for u and x ∂x y ∂y x u which are the usual notations for partial derivatives.
The precise y formulation of this statement is given in Theorem 1 and 2 below.
The equation (1) is called the Cauchy – Riemann equations.
They are the most important equations in the whole unit.
56  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Example 27 f ( z) = z 2 = x 2 − y 2 + 2ixy is analytic for all z, and u = x 2 − y 2 and v = 2xy Satisfy (1), namely, u = 2x = v and u = − 2 y = − v more examples will x y y x follow.
3.5.1 Theorem 1 (Cauchy Riemann Equations) Let f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) be defined and continuous in some neighbourhood of a point z = x + iy and differentiable at z itself.
Then at the point, the first – order partial derivatives of u and v exist and satisfy the Cauchy Riemann equations (1).
Hence if f(z) is analytic in a domain f’ (z) at z exists.
It is given by (1) at all points of D. Proof By assumption, the derivative f’ (z) at z exists.
It given by f (z + ∆z )− f ( z) 2. f ' ( z) = lim ∆ z → 0 ∆z The idea of the proof is very simple, by the definition of a limit in complex (cf.
sec.
12.4) we can let L1z approaches zero along any path in a neighbourhood of z.
Thus, we may choose the two paths I and II in fig.
312 and equate the results.
By comparing the real parts we shall obtain the first Cauchy Riemann equation and by comparing the imaginary parts we shall obtain the other equation in (1).
The technical details are as follows.
We write L1z = L1x +iL1y.
In terms of u and v, the derivative in (2) becomes [u ( x + ∆x, y + ∆y ) + iv ( x + ∆x, y + ∆y )] − [u ( x, y ) + iv ( x, y )] 3. f ' (z ) = lim ∆z →0 ∆x + i∆y We first choose path I in fig.
312.
Thus we let ∆y → 0 first and then ∆x → 0.
57 MT H 381 MODULE 2 y II z +L1z z I x Fig.
19: Paths in (2) After L1y becomes zero, L1z = L1x.
then (3) becomes, if we first write the two u – terms and then two v-terms.
u (x + ∆x, y )− u(x, y ) v(x + ∆x, y )− v(x, y ) f ' ( z) = lim + i lim ∆x → 0 ∆x ∆x → 0 ∆x Since f’(z) exists, the two real limits on the right exist.
By definition, they are the partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x. hence the derivative f’ (z) of f(z) can be written 4. f ' ( z) = u + iv x x Similarly, if we choose path II in fig 312, we let ∆x → 0 first and then ∆y → 0 .
After L1x becomes zero, L1z = iL1y, so that from (3) we now obtain u (x , y + ∆y )− u(x, y ) v(x, y + ∆ y )− v(x, y ) f ' ( z) = lim + i lim ∆y → 0 i∆y ∆y → 0 i∆y Since f’(z) exists, the limits on the right exist and yield partial derivatives with respect to y; noting that 1/i = -i, we obtain: 5. f ' ( z) = − iu + v y y The existence of the derivatives f ' (z) thus implies the existence of the four partial derivatives in (4) and (5).
By equating the real parts u and x v in (4) and (5) we obtain the first Cauchy – Riemann equation (1).
y Equating the imaginary part yields the other.
This proves the first statements of the theorem and implies the second because of the definition of analyticity.
Formulas (4) and (5) are also quite practical for calculating derivatives f ' (z), as we shall see.
58  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Examples 28 Cauchy – Riemann Equations f ( z) = z 2 is analytic for all z. it follows that the Cauchy – Riemann equations must be satisfied (as we have verified above).
For f ( z) = z = x − iy we have u = x, v = -y and see that the second Cauchy-Riemann equation is satisfied, u = - v = 0, but the first is not: y x u =1≠ v = − 1.
We conclude that f ( z) = z is not analytic, confirming x y example 4 of sec.
12.4.
Note the savings in calculation!
The Cauchy – Riemann equations are fundamental because they are not only necessary but also sufficient for a function to be analytic.
More precisely, the following holds.
Theorem 2 (Cauchy – Riemann Equations) If two real – valued continuous functions u(x,y) and v(x,y) of two real variables x and y have continuous first partial derivatives that satisfy the Cauchy – Riemann equations in some domain D, then the complex function f ( z) = u( x, y) + iv( x, y) is analytic in D. The proof of this theorem is more involved than the previous proof; Theorems 1 and 2 are of great practical importance, since by using the Cauchy – Riemann equations we can now easily find out whether or not a given complex function is analytic.
Example 29 Cauchy – Riemann Equations Is f(z) = z3 analytic?
Solution We find u = x3 – 3xy and v = 3x2y and v = 3x2y – y3.
next we calculate u = 3x – 3y , v = 3x2 – 3y2 x 2 2 y u = -6xy, v = 6xy y x We see that the Cauchy – Riemann equations are satisfied for every z, hence f (z) = z3 is analytic for every z, by theorem 2.
59 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Example 30 Determination of an Analytic Function with given Real Part We illustrate another class of practical; that can be solved by the Cauchy – Riemann equations.
Find the most general analytic function f(z) whose real part is u = x3 – y2 – x.
Solution We have u = 2x – 1 = v by the first Cauchy – Riemann equation.
This z y we integrate with respect to y; v = 2xy − y + k ( x).
As an important point, since we integrated a partial derivative with respect to y, the “constant” of integration k may depend on the other variable, x.
(To understand this, calculate v from the v.) and the second y Cauchy – Riemann equation.
dk u y = − v x = − 2 y + dx On the other hand, from the given u = x2 – y2 – x we have u = -2y.
By y comparison, dk/dx = 0.
Hence k = constant, which must be real.
(Why?).
The result is f ( z) = u + iv = x 2 − y 2 − x + i(2xy − y + k ).
We can express in terms of z, namely, f(z) = z2 – z + ik.
Example 31 An Analytic Function of Constant Absolute Value is Constant The Cauchy – Riemann equations also help to establish general properties of analytic functions.
For example, show that if f (z) is analytic in a domain D and f ( z) = k = constant in D, then f(z) = constant in D. 60  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Solution By assumption, u 2 + v 2 = k 2 by differentiation.
uu − vu = 0. uu + vv = 0. x x y y From this and the Cauchy – Riemann equations.
6.
(a) uu − uu = 0.
(b) uu + uu = 0 x y y x To get rid of u multiply (6a) by u and (6b) by v and add.
Similarly to y eliminate u , multiply (6a) by – v and (6b) by u and add.
This yield.
x (u 2 + v 2 )u = 0.
(u 2 + v 2 )u = 0. x y If k2 = u2 + v2 = 0, then u = v, hence f = 0. if k ≠ 0, then u = u = 0, x y hence by the Cauchy – Riemann equations, also vx = v y = 0. together, u = constant and v = constant, hence f = constant.
If we use polar form z = r(cos θ + isin θ) and set f(z) = u(r, θ), then the Cauchy – Riemann equations are 1 −1 7. ur = r vθ and vr = r uθ The derivative can then be calculated from 8a.
f ' ( z) = (u + iv )(cosθ − i sin θ ) r r or from 8b.
f ' ( z) = (v − iu )(cosθ − i sin θ )/ r .
θ θ Example 32 Cauchy – Riemann equations in polar form let f ( z) = z 3 = r 3 (cos 3θ + i sin 3θ ).
Then u = r 3 cos 3θ , v = r 3 sin 3θ By definition, u = 3r 2 cos 3θ , v = 3r 3 cos 3θ , r θ v 3r 2 sin 3θ , u = 3r 3 sin 3θ r θ We see that (7) holds for all z ≠ 0. this confirms that z3 is analytic for all z ≠ 0.
(and we know that it is also analytic at (z = 0).
From (8b) we obtain the derivative as expected.
61 MT H 381 MODULE 2 f ' ( z) = 3r 2 (cos 3θ + i sin 3θ )(cosθ − i sin θ ) = 3z 2 .
Laplace’s Equation: Harmonic functions One of the main reasons for the great practical importance of complex analysis in engineering mathematics results form the fact that the real part of an analytic function f = u + iv satisfies the so – called Laplace’s equation.
9.
∇ 2 u = u + u = 0. x x y y ( ∇ 2 read “nabla squared”) and the same holds fort the imaginary part 10.
∇ 2 v = v + v = 0. x x y y Laplace’s equation is one of the most equations in physics, occurring in gravitation, electrostatics, fluid flow, etc.
(cf.
chaps.
11, 17) let us discover why this equation arises in complex analysis.
Theorem 3 (Laplace’s Equation) If f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) is analytic in a domain d, then u and v satisfy Laplace’s equation (9) and (10) in d and have continuous second partial derivatives in D. Proof: Differentiating u = v with respect to x and u = v with respect to y, x y y x we obtain 11. u = v u = − v .
x x y x y y x y Now the derivative of an analytic function is itself analytic, as we shall prove later (in sec.
13.6).
This implies that u and v have continuous partial derivatives of all orders; in particular, the mixed second derivatives are equal; v = v .
By adding (11) we thus obtain (9).
yx xy Similarly, (10), is obtained by differentiating u = v with respect to y x y and u = -v with respect to x and subtracting, using u = u .
y x xy yx Solutions of Laplace’s equation having continuous second – order partial derivatives are called harmonic functions and their theory is called potential theory (cf.
also sec.
11.11).
Hence the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic functions.
62  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III If two harmonic functions u and v satisfy the Cauchy – Riemann equations in a domain d, they are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function f in d. Then v is said to be a conjugate harmonic function of u in d. (of course this use of the word “conjugate” has nothing to do with that employed in defining z , the conjugate of a complex number z).
A conjugate of a given harmonic function can be obtained from the Cauchy – Riemann equations, as may be illustrated by the following example.
Example 33 Conjugate Harmonic Function Verify that u = x 2 − y 2 − y is harmonic in the complex plane and find a conjugate harmonic function of v of u.
Solution ∇ 2 u = 0 by direct calculation.
Now u = 2 x and u = − 2 y −1.
hence a x y conjugate v of u must satisfy v = u = 2x, v = − u = 2 y +1.
x x y Integrating the first equation with respect to y and differentiating the result with respect to x, we obtain.
dh v = 2xy + h( x), v = 2 y + x dx A comparison with the second shows that dh/dx = 1.
This gives h(x) = x + c. hence v = 2xy + x + c (c any real cons tan t ) is the most general conjugate harmonic of the given u.
The corresponding analytic function is f ( z) = u + iv = x 2 − y 2 − y + i(2xy + x + c) = z 2 + iz + ic.
The Cauchy – Riemann equations are the most important equations in this chapter.
Their relation to Laplace’s equation opens wide ranges of engineering and physical applications, as we shown in chapter 17.
In the remainder of this chapter we discuss elementary functions, one after the other, beginning with e z in the next section.
Without knowing these functions and their properties we would not be able to do any useful practical work.
This is just as in calculus.
63 MT H 381 MODULE 2 3.6 Exponential Function The remaining sections of this chapter will be devoted to the most important elementary complex function, logarithm, trigonometric functions, etc we shall see that these complex functions can easily be defined in such a way that, for real values of the independent variable, the functions become identical with the familiar real functions.
Some of the complex functions have interesting properties.
Which do not show when the independent variable is restricted to real values.
The student should follow the consideration with great care, because these elementary functions will be frequently needed in applications.
We begin with the complex exponential function also written as one of most important analytic functions.
The definition of ez in terms of the real functions ex cos y and sin y is ez = ex(cos y + sin y).
This definition is motivated by requirement that make ez a natural extension of the real exponential function ex, namely.
(a) ez should reduce to the latter when z = x is real; (b) ez should be an entire function, that is analytic for all z, and resembling calculus, its derivative should be 2.
(ez)1 = ez from (1) we see that (a) holds, since cos 0 = 1 and sin 0 = 0. that ez is easily verified by the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
Formula (2) then follows from (4) that (ez)1 = (ez cos y) + i(ex sin y) = ez cos y + iez sin y = ez.
z x ez.
has further interesting properties.
Let us first show that, as in real, we have the functional relations 3. e z1 + z2 = e z1 z2 For any z = x + iy 1 1 1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 , indeed, by (1).
= e x1(cos y + i sin y ) e x2 (cos y + i sin y ).
1 1 2 2 Since e x1 e x2 = e x1 + e x2 for these real functions, by an application of the addition formulas for the cosine and sine functions (similar to that in sec.
12.2) we find that this equals e z1 z2 = e x1 (cos (y 1 + y 2 )+ i sin ( y1 + y 2 ))= e z1 + z2 64  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III As asserted.
An 4. e iy = cos y + i sin y = cos 2 y + sin 2 y = 1.
That is, for pure imaginary exponents the exponential function has absolute value one, a result the student should remember.
From (7) and (1), 5. e z = e x .
Hence arg e z = y + 2nπ (n = 0,1,2,⋅⋅⋅⋅) since e z = e x .
shows that (1) is actually e x in polar form.
Example 34 Illustration of Some Properties of the Exponential Function Computation of values from (1) provides no problem.
For instance, verify that e1.4−0.6i = e1.4 (cos 0.6 − i sin 0.6) = 4.055(0.825 − 0.565i) = 3.347 − 2.290i, e1.4−0.6i = e1.4 = 4.055, Arge1.4−0.6i = −0.6.
Since cos 2π = 1 and sin 2π = 0 , we have from (5) 6. e 2πi = 1 Furthermore use (1), (5) or (6) to verify these important special values: 7. eπi 2 = i , eπi = −1 , e −πi 2 = −i , e −πi = −1.
To illustrate (3), take the product of e 2 +i = e 2 (cos i + i sin 1) = e 4 −i e 4 (cos1 − i sin 1) and verify that equals e 2 e 4 (cos 2 1 + sin 2 1) = e 6 = e ( 2+i )−( 4−i ) .
Finally, conclude from e z = e x ≠ 0 in (8)that 8. e x ≠ 0 for all z So here we have an entire function that never vanishes, in contrast to (non-constant) polynomials, which are also entire (Example 5 in 65 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Sec.2.4) but always have zero, as is proved in algebra.
[Can you obtain (11) from (3) ?]
Periodicity of e x with period 2πi , 9. e z + 2πi = e z all z is a basic property that follows from (1) and the periodicity of cosy and siny.
It also follows from (3) and (9).]
Hence all the values that w = e z can assume are already assumed in the horizontal strip of width 2π .
10.
− π < y ≤ π This infinite strip is called a fundamental region of e x .
Example 35 Solution of an Equation Find all solution of e x = 3 + 4i Solution e x = e x = 5, x = In 5 = 1.609 is a real part of all solutions.
Furthermore, since e x = 5 , e x cos y = 3, e x sin y = 4, cosy = 0.6, siny = 0.8, y = 0.927 .
y π x - π Fig.
20: Fundamental Region of the Exponential Function ez I in the z-plane Ans.
z =1.609 + 0.927i ± 2nπi (n = 0,1,2,⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅) .
These are infinitely many solutions (due to the periodicity of e z ).
They lie on the vertical line x=1.609 at a distance 2π from their neighbours.
To summarise: many properties of e z = exp z parallel to those of e x ; an exception is the periodicity of e x with 2πi , which suggested the concept of a fundamental region and causes the periodicity of cosz and sinz with the real period 2π , as we shall see in the next section.
Keep in mind that e z is an entire function.
(Do you still remember what that means?)
66  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 3.7 Trigonometric Functions, Hyperbolic Functions Just as e z extends e x to complex, we want the complex trigonometric functions to extend the familiar real trigonometric functions.
The idea of making the connection is the use of the Euler formulae.
e ix = cos x + i sin x, e −ix = cos x − i sin x.
By addition and subtraction we obtain 1 1 cos x = (e iz + e −iz ), sinx = (e iz − e −iz ) x real 2 2i This suggests the following definitions for complex values z = x + iy 1 1 1. cos z = (e iz + e −iz ), sinz = (e iz − e −iz ).
2 2i Furthermore, in agreement with the definition from the real calculus we define sin z cos z 2. tan z = , cotz = sin z cos z and 1 1 3. sec z = , cosecz = .
cos z sin z Since e z is entire, cosz and sinz are entire functions.
Tanz and secz are not entire; they are analytic except at the point where cosz is zero; and cot z and csc z are analytic except, where sin z = 0 .
Formulas for the derivatives follows readily from (e z )′ = e z and (1)-(3); as in calculus, 4.
(cos z)′ = − sin z, (sin z)′ = cos z, (tan z)′ = sec 2 z, etc.
Equation (1) also shows that Euler’s formula is valid in complex: 5. eiz = cos z + i sin z for all z.
Real and imaginary parts of cosz and sinz are needed in computing values, and they also help in displaying properties of our functions.
We illustrate this by typical example.

Absolute Value.
Periodicity Show that (a) cos z = cos x cosh y − i sin x sinh y 6.
(b) sin z = sin x cosh y + i cos x sinh y and 7.
(a) cosh z 2 = cos 2 x + sinh 2 y (b) sinh z 2 = sin 2 x + sinh 2 y And give some application of these formulas.
Solution From (1) 1 cos z = (ei () x +iy + e−i ( x +iy ) ) 2 1 1 = e − y (cos x + i sin y) + e y (cos x − i sin y) 2 2 1 1 = (e y + e − y ) cos x − i(e y − e − y ) sin x.
2 2 This yields (6a) since, as is known from calculus, 1 1 8. cosh y = (e y + e − y ), sinhy = (e y − e − y ); 2 2 (6b) is obtained similarly.
From and cosh 2 y = 1 + sinh 2 y we obtain cos 2 = cos 2 x(1 + sinh 2 y) + sin 2 x + sinh 2 y.
Since sin 2 x + cos 2 x = 1 , this gives (7a), and (7b) is obtained similarly.
For instance, cos(2 + 3i cos 2 cosh 3 − i sin 2 sinh 3 = −4.190 − 9.109i .
From (6) we see that cosz and sinz are periodic with period 2π , just as in real.
Periodicity of tan z and cot z with period π now follows.
Formula (7) points to an essential difference between the real and the complex cosine and sine: whereas cos x ≤ 1 and sin x ≤ 1, the complex 68  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III cosine and sine functions are no longer bounded but approach infinity in absolute value as y → ∞, since sinh y → ∞.
Example 37 Solution of Equations.
Zeros Solve (a) cos z = 5 (which has no real solution), (b) cos z = 0 (c) sin z = 0 Solution (a) e 2iz − 10e iz + 1 = 0 from (1) by multiplication by eiz .
This is a quadratic equation in eiz , with solution (3D-values) e iz = e − y +ix 5 ± 25 − 1 = 9.899 and 0.101.
Thus e − y = 9.899 or 0.101, e ix = 1, y = ±2.292, x = 2nπ Ans.
z = ±2nπ ± 2.292i(n = 0,1,2,⋅⋅⋅⋅), can you obtain this by using (6a)?
(b) cos x = 0, sinh y = 0, by (7a), y = 0.
Ans.
z = ± 1 (2n +1)π (n = 0,1,2,⋅⋅⋅⋅).
2 (c) sin sx = 0, sinh y = 0, by (7b), y = 0.
Ans.
z = 2nπ (n = 0,1,2,⋅⋅⋅⋅).
Hence the only zeros of cosz and sinz are those of the real cosine and sine functions.
From the definition it follows immediately that all the familiar formulas for the real trigonometric functions continue to hold for complex values.
We mention in particular the addition rules cos( z ± z ) = cos z cos z ± sin z sin z 9.
1 2 1 2 1 2 sin( z ± z ) = sin z cos z ± sin z cos z 1 2 1 2 2 1 and the formula 69 MT H 381 MODULE 2 10. cos2 z + sin 2 z = 1.
Some further useful formulas are inclined in the problem set.
HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS The complex hyperbolic cosine and sine are defined by the formulas 11. cosh z = 21 (e z + e − z ), sinh z = 2 1 (e z − e− z ).
This suggested by the familiar definition for the real variable.
These functions are shown below, with derivatives 12.
(cosh z)′ = sinh z, (sinh z)′ = cosh z, as in calculus.
The other hyperbolic functions are defined by sinh z cosh z tan z = , coth z = , cosh z sinh z 1 1 13. sec hz = , csc hz = , cosh z sin zh Complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are related If in (11), we replace z by iz and use (1), we obtain 14. cosh iz = cos z, sinh iz = i sin z, From this, since cosh is even and sinh is odd, conversely 15. cos iz = cosh z, sin iz = i sinh z, Apart from their practical importance, these formulas are remarkable in principle.
Whereas in real calculus, the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are of a different character, in complex these functions are intimately related.
Moreover the Euler formula relates them to the exponential function.
This situation illustrates that by working in complex, rather than in real, one can often gain a deeper understanding of special functions.
This is one of the three main reasons of the practical importance of complex analysis, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.

The most fundamental result in the whole unit is Cauchy’s integral theorem.
It implies, the importance of Cauchy integral formula.
We prove that if a function is analytic, it has derivatives of all orders.
Hence, in this respect, complex analytic functions behave much more simply than real-valued functions of real variables.
Interpretation by means of residues and applications to real integrals will be considered in Module 3.
74  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, you should be able to: • in applications there occur real integrals that can be evaluated by complex integration, whereas the usual methods of real integral calculus are not successful and • some basic properties of analytic function can be established by integration, but would be difficult to prove by other methods.
The existence of higher derivatives of analytic functions is a striking property of this type.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Line Integral in the Complex Plane As in real calculus, we distinguish between definite integrals, and indefinite integrals or ant derivatives.
An indefinite integral is a function whose derivative equals a given analytic function in a region.
By inverting known differentiation formulas we may find many types of indefinite integrals.
We shall now define definite integrals, or line integrals, of complex function f ( z), where z = x + iy as follows;.
Path of Integration In real calculus, a definite integral is taken over an interval (a segment) of the real line.
In the case of a complex definite integral we integrate along a curve C in the complex plane, which will be called the path of integration.
Now a curve C in the complex plane can be represented in the form z(t ) = x(t ) + iy(t ) (a ≤ t ≤ b) (1) where t is a real parameter.
For example, z(t ) = t + 3it (0 ≤ t ≤ 2) represent a portion of the line y = 3x (sketch it!
), z(t ) = 4 cos t + 4i sin t (-π ≤ t ≤ π ) represent the circle z = 4 , etc.
(More example below) 75 MT H 381 MODULE 2 C is called a smooth curve if C has a derivative dz z&(t ) = = x& (t ) + iy& (t ) dt at each of its points which is continuous and nowhere zero.
Geometrically this means that C has a continuous turning tangent.
This follow directly from the definition z(t + ∆t ) − z(t ) z&(t ) = lim ∆t →0 ∆t Fig.
21: Tangent vector z(t) of a curve C in the complex plane given by z(t).
The arrow on the curve indicates the positive sense (sense of increasing t).
3.1.1 Definition of the Complex Line Integral This will be similar to the method used in calculus.
Let C be a smooth curve in the z -plane represented in the form (1).
Let f ( z) be a continuous function defined (least) at each point of C .
We subdivided (“partition”) the interval (a ≤ t ≤ b) in (1) by points of Fig.
22: Complex Line Integral t (= a), t ,⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ .t , t (= b) 0 1 n−1 n 76  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Where t < t < ⋅⋅⋅t .
To do this subdivision there corresponds a 0 1 n subdivision of C by points z , z ,⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ .z , z (= z), 0 1 n −1 n where z = z(t ) .
On each portion of subdivision of C we choose an j j arbitrary point, say, a point ξ1 between z0 and z1 (that is, ξ1 = z(t) ) where t satisfies t0 ≤ t ≤ t1 , a point ξ1 between z0 and z1 (that is, ξ1 = z(t) ) where t satisfies t ≤ t ≤ t , a point ξ between z and z etc.
Then we form 0 1 2 1 2 the sum n S n = ∑ f (ξ m ) (2) m=1 where ∆z = z − z −1.
m m m This we do for each n =1,2,3,⋅⋅⋅⋅ in a completely independent manner, but in such a way that the greatest ∆z approaches zero as n approaches m infinity.
This gives a sequence of complex numbers S , S ,⋅⋅⋅⋅.
The limit 2 3 of these sequence is called the line integral (or simply the integral) of f ( z), along the oriented curve C and is denoted by ∫ f ( z)dz (3) C The curve C is called the path of integration.
C is called a closed path if z = z , that is, if its terminal point coincides with its initial point.
0 (Example: a circle, a curve shaped like an 8, etc.)
Then also writes ∫ instead of ∫ C C Examples follow in the next section.
General Assumption All path of integration for complex line integral will be assumed to be piecewise smooth, that is, to consist of finitely many smooth curves joined end to end.
3.1.2 Existence of the Line Integral From our assumption that f ( z) is continuous and C is piecewise smooth, the existence of the line integral (3) follows, as in the previous chapter let us write f ( z) = u( x, y) + iv( x, y) .
We also set 77 MT H 381 MODULE 2 ξ m = ξ m + iη m and ∆z m = ∆xm + i∆ym then (2) may be written S = ∑ (u + iv)(∆x + i∆y ) (4) n m m Where u = u(ξ ,η ) and v = v(ξ ,η ) we sum over m from1 to n. We m m m m may now split up S into four sums: n S = ∑ u∆x − ∑ v∆y + i[∑ u∆y + ∑ v∆x ] n m m m m These sums are real.
Since f is continuous, u and v are continuous.
Hence, if we let n approach infinity in the aforementioned way, then the greatest ∆x and ∆y will approach zero and each sum on the right m m becomes a real line integral: [ ] lim S = ∫ f ( z)dz = ∫ udx − ∫ vdy + i ∫ udy + ∫ vdx (5) n→∞ n C C C C C This shows that under our assumption ( f continuous on C and C piecewise smooth) the line integral (3) exist and its value is 1 2 independent of the choice of subdivisions and intermediate points ξ .
m 3.1.3 Three Basic Properties of Complex Line Integrals We list three properties of complex line integrals that are quite similar to those of real definite integrals (and real line integrals) and follow immediately from the definition.
Integration is a linear operation, that is, a sum of two (or more) functions can be integrated term by term, and constant factors can be taken out from under the integral sign: ∫ [k f ( z) + k f ( z)]dz = k ∫ f ( z)dz + k ∫ f ( z)dz (6) 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 C C C Fig.
23: Subdivision of Path (Formula (7) Decomposing C into two portions C and C (Fig), we get 1 2 ∫ f ( z)dz = ∫ f ( z)dz + ∫ f ( z)dz (7) C C C 1 2 78  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 3.
Reversing the sense of integration, we get the negative of the original value: z z ∫ f ( z)dz = −∫ 0 f ( z)dz (8) z0 z here the path C with endpoint z and Z is the same; on the left we 0 integrate from z to Z , on the right from z to Z .
0 0 Applications follow in the next section and problems at the end of it.
3.2 Two Integration Methods Complex integration is rich in methods for evaluating integrals.
We discuss first two of them, and others will follow later in this chapter.
3.2.1 First Method: Use of Representation of the Path This method applies to any continuous complex function.
Theorem 1 (Integration by the use of the path) Let C be a piecewise smooth path, represented by z = z(t), where a ≤ t ≤ b Let f(z) be a continuous function on C. Then ∫ f ( z) = ∫ b f [z(t)]z&(t)dt = i dz (1)  C a dt   Proof The left-hand side of (1) is given by (5), Sec, 13.1, in terms of real integrals, and we show that the right-hand side of (1) also equals (5).
We have z = x + iy , hence z& = x& + iy& .
We simply write u for u[x(t ), y(t )] and v for v[x(t), y(t )] .We also have dx = x&dt and dy = y&dt .
Consequently, in (1), ∫ b f [z(t )]z&(t)dt = ∫ b (u + iv)( x& + iy& )dt a a = ∫ [udx − vdy + i(udy + vdx)], C Which is the right-hand side of (5), as claimed.
79 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Steps in applying Theorem 1 Represent the path C in the form z(t ) a ≤ t ≤ b Calculate the derivative z&(t ) = dz dt Substitute z(t ) for every z in f ( z) (hence x(t ) for x and y(t ) for y) Integrate f [z(t)]z&(t ) over t from a to b Example 1 A Basic Result: Integral of1 z around the unit circle Show that ∫ dz = 2πi ( C the unit circle, clockwise) (2) C z The important result will be frequently needed.
Solution We may represent the unit circle C in the form z(&t ) = cos t + i sin t z (0 ≤ t ≤ 2π ).
So that the counterclockwise integration correspond to an increase of t from 0 to 2π .
By differentiation, z&(t ) = − sin t + i cos t 1 Also f [z(t )] = .
Formula (1) now yields the desired result z(t ) ∫ dz = ∫ 2π 1 (− sin t + i cos t )dt z cos t + i sin t C 0 2 π = i ∫ dt 0 = 2πi The Euler formula helps us to save work by representing the unit circle simply in the form z(t ) = eit Then 1 e−it , dz = ieit dt.
z(t ) 80  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III As before, we now get more quickly ∫ dz = ∫2 π e −it ieit = i ∫2 π dt C z 0 0 = 2πi .
Example 2 Integral of Integer Powers Let f ( z) = ( z − z ) m where m is an integer and z is a constant.
0 0 Integrate in the clockwise sense around the circle C of radius ρ with centre at z 0 Solution We may represent the unit circle C in the form z(t ) = z + ρ (cos t + i sin t ) = z + ρeit z (0 ≤ t ≤ 2π ).
0 0 Then we have ( z − z ) m = ρ m eimt , dz = iρeit dt, 0 and we obtain ∫ ( z − z ) m dz = ∫ 2 π ρ m e imt dt 0 0 C = ∫ 2π ei ( m+1)t dt.
0 By the Euler formula (5), the right-hand side equals i m2π + 1 ∫ cos(m + 1)t + i ∫ 2 π sin(m + 1)t .
ρ  0 0  When m = −1, we have ρ m +1 = 1, cos 0 = 1, sin 0 = 0 and thus obtain 2πi .
For integer m ≠ 1 each of the two integer is zero because we integrate over an interval of length 2πi , equal to a period of sine and cosine.
Hence the result is 2πi (m = -1) ∫C ( z − z0 ) m dz =  0 (m ≠ -1 and integer).
(3) Let us now illustrate the following important fact.
If we integrate a function f ( z), from a point z to a point z along different path, we 0 1 generally get the values of the integral.
In other words, a complex line 81 MT H 381 MODULE 2 integral generally depends not only on the end point of the path but also on the geometric shape of the path.
Example 3 Integral of Non-analytic Function Integrate f ( z) = x from 0 to 1. along C * in fig.

along C consisting of C and C .
1 2 Solution a.
C * can be represented by z(t ) = t + it (0 ≤ t ≤ 1) .
Hence z&(t ) = +i and f [z(t)] = x(t ) = 1 (on C * ).
We now calculate 1 ∫ Re zdz = ∫ t (1 + i)dt C 0 1 = (1 + i).
2 b.
C can be represented by z(t ) = t (0 ≤ t ≤ 1) .
Hence 1 z&(t ) = 1 and f [z(t)] = x(t ) = 1 (on C ).
1 C can be represented by z(t ) = t + it (0 ≤ t ≤ 1) .
Hence 2 z&(t ) = 1 and f [z(t)] = x(t ) = 1 (on C ).

82  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 3.2.2 Second Method: Indefinite Integration In real calculus, if for given f ( x) we know an F ( x) such that F ′( x) = f ( x), then we can apply the formula b ∫ f ( x)dx = F (b) − F (a) a This method extends to complex functions.
We shall see that it is simpler than the previous method, but, of course, we have to find an F ( z) whose derivative F ′( z) equals the given function f ( z) that we want to integrate.
Clearly, differentiation formulas will often helps us in finding such an F ( z) , so that this method becomes of great practical importance.
Theorem 2 (Indefinite Integration of Analytic Functions) Let f ( z) be analytic in a simply connected domain D .
Then there exists an indefinite integral of f ( z) in the domain D , that is, an analytic function F ( z) such that F ′( z) = f ( z) in D , and for all path in D joining two point z and z in D we have 0 1 z 4.
∫ 1 f ( x)dz = F ( z ) − F ( z ) [F ′( z) = f ( z)].
1 0 z0 (Note that we can write z and z instead of C , since we get the same 0 1 value for all those C from z and z ).
0 1 This theorem will be proved by using Cauchy’s integral theorem which we discuss in the next section… Example 4 ∫1+i z 3 dz = 1 z 3 1 + i 0 3 0 1 2 2 = (1 + i)3 = − + i 3 3 3 Example 5 πi πi ∫ cos zdz = sin z −π i − πi = 2 sin πi = 2i sinh π = 23.097i 83 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Example 6 ∫ 8−3πi e z 2 dz =2e z 2 8 − 3π 8+3πi 8 + 3π = 2(e4−3πi 2 − e4+3πi 2 ) = 0 Since e z is periodic with period 2πi.
3.2.3 Bound for Absolute Value of Integrals There will be a frequent need for estimating the absolute value of complex line integrals.
The basic formula is 6.
∫ f ( z)dz ≤ ML ( ML -inequality); C here L is the length of C and M a constant such that f ( z) ≤ M everywhere on C. Proof: We consider S as given by (2).
By the generalized triangle inequality n (6), we obtain n m S n = ∑ f (ξ m )∆z m ≤ ∑ f (ξ m ) ∆zm m=1 m =1 n ≤ M ∑ ∆zm .
m =1 Now ∆z is the length of the chord whose end points are z and z .
m m −1 m Hence the sum on the right represents the length L* of the broken line of the chord whose endpoints are z , z ,⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅⋅ , z (n If n approaches 0 1 n = Z ).
infinity in such a way that the greatest ∆zm approaches zero, then L* approaches the length L of the curve C , by the definition of the length of a curve.
From this the inequality (6) follows.
We cannot see for (6) how close to the bound ML the actual absolute value of the integral is, but this will be no hardship in applying (6).
For the time being we explain the practical use of (6) by a simple example.
Example 8 Find a upper bound for the absolute value of the integral 84  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III ∫ z 2 dz, C the straight-line segment from 0 to 1+i C Solution L = 2 and f ( z) = z 2 ≤ 2 on C gives by (6) ∫ z 2 dz ≤ 2 2 = 2.8284 C The absolute value of the integral is 2 2 2 − + i = 2 = 0.9428 3 3 3 In the next section we discuss the most important theorem of the whole chapter, Cauchy’s integral theorem, which is the basic in itself and has far reaching consequences which we shall explore, above all the existence of all higher derivatives of an analytic function, which are themselves analytic functions.
3.3 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem Cauchy’s integral theorem is very important in complex analysis and has various theoretical and practical consequences.
To state this theorem, we shall need the following concepts.
A closed path C is called a simple close path if C does not intersect or touch itself (see diagram below).
For example a circle is simple, an eight- shaped curve is not.
A domain D in the complex plane is called a simply connected domain if every closed path in D encloses only points of D. A domain that is not simply connected is called multiply connected.
For instance, the interior of a circle (“circular disk”), ellipse or square is simply connected.
More generally, the interior of a simple closed curve is simply connected.
A circular ring or annulus is multiply connected (more precisely: doubly connected).
The figure below shows further examples.
85 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Fig.
27: Simply and Multiply Connected Domain Recalling that, by definition, a function is a single-valued relation, we can now state Cauchy’s integral theorem as follows.
This theorem is sometimes also called the Cauchy-Gaursat theorem.
3.3.1 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem If f ( z) be analytic in a simply connected domain D , then for every simple close path C in D, 1.
∫ f ( z)dz = 0 C Proof If we make assumption –as Cauchy did- that the derivative f ′( z) of f ( z) is continuous in D (existence of f ′( z) in D being a consequences of analyticity), then Cauchy’s theorem follows from a basic theorem on real Fig.
28: Cauchy’s Integral Theorem line integrals (proof below).
Goursat finally proved Cauchy’s theorem without the assumption that f ′( z) is continuous (optional proof at the end of this chapter).
Before we go into details, let us consider some example in order to really understand what is going on.
86  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III We mention that a closed path is sometimes called a contour and an integral over such a path a contour integral.
Example 9 ∫ e z dz = 0 , ∫ cos zdz = 0 ∫ z n dz = 0 (n = 0,1,⋅⋅⋅⋅) C C C For any closed path, since these functions are (analytic for all z).
Example 10 dz ∫ sec zdz = 0 , ∫ = 0 z 2 + 4 C C 1 where C is the unit circle.
sec z = is not analytic cos z at z = ± π 2 ,± 3π 2 ,⋅ ⋅ but all these points lie outside C ; none lie on C. ⋅ ⋅ , Similarly for the second integral, whose integrand is not analytic at z = ±2πi outside C. Example 11 ∫ zdz = 2πi C (C the unit circle, counterclockwise) does not contradict Cauchy’s theorem, since f ( z) = z is not analytic, so that the theorem does not apply.
(Verify this result!)
Example 12 dz ∫ = 0, C z 2 where C is the unit circle.
This result does not follow from the Cauchy’s 1 theorem, because f ( z) = is not analytic at z = 0 .
Hence the condition z 2 that f be analytic in D is sufficient rather than necessary for (1) to be true.
Example 13 dz ∫ = 2πi, C z 2 87 MT H 381 MODULE 2 The integration being taken around the unit circle in the clockwise 1 3 1 sense.
C lies in the annulus < z < where is analytic, but this 2 2 z domain is not simply connected, so that Cauchy’s theorem cannot be applied.
Hence the condition that the domain D be simply connected is quite essential.
Example 14 7 z − 6 7 z − 6 3 4 ∫ z 2 − 2z dz = ∫ z( z − 2) dz = ∫ z dz + ∫ z − 2 dz = 3 ⋅ 2πi + 0 C C C C = 6πi (C the unit circle, counterclockwise) by partial fraction reduction.
Cauchy’s proof under the condition that f ′( z) I continuous From (5) we have ∫ f ( z)dz =∫ (udx − vdy) + ∫ (udy + vdx).
C C C Since f ( z) is analytic in D, its derivative F ′( z) exists in D. Since F ′( z) is assume to be continuous, (4) and (5) in previous section imply that u and v have continuous partial derivatives in D. Hence Green’s theorem with u and –v instead of F and F is applicable and gives 1 2 ∫ (udx − vdy) = ∫∫  −∂ v − ∂u d xdy C  ∂x ∂y  R where R is the region bounded by C. The second Cauchy-Rieman integration shows that the integrand on the right is identically zero.
Hence, the integral on the left is zero.
In the same fashion it follows by the use of the first Cauchy-Rieman equation that the last integral in the above formula is zero.
This complete Cauchy’s proof.
3.3.2 Independence of Path, Deformation of Path We shall now discuss an important consequence of Cauchy’s integral theorem that has great practical interest, proceedings as follows.
If we subdivided the path, C in Cauchy’s theorem into two arcs C * and C , 1 2 then (1) takes the form (2′) ∫ fdz + ∫ fdz = 0 .
C C 1 2 88  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Fig.
29: Formula (2’) Fig.
30: Formula (2) If we now reverse the sense of integration along C * , then the integral 1 over C * is multiplied by -1.
Denoting C * with its new orientation 1 1 by C , we thus obtain from (6′) .
2 2.
∫ f ( z)dz = ∫ f ( z)dz.
C2 C1 Hence, if f it is analytic in D, C * and C are any path in D joining two 1 2 points in D and having no further points in common, then (2) holds.
If those paths C * and C have finitely many points in common, then (2) 1 2 continues to hold.
This follow by apply previous result to the portion of C and C between each pair of consecutives point of intersection.
1 2 If it is even true that (2) holds for any paths that join ant points z and z and lie entirely in the simply connected domain D in 1 2 which f ( z) is analytic.
To express this we may say that the integral of f ( z) is independent of path in D. (Of course the value of the integral depends on the choice of z and z .)
1 2 The proof may require additional consideration of the case in which C and C have infinitely many points of intersection, and is not 1 2 presented here.
We may imagine that the path C in (2) was obtained from C by a 2 1 continuous deformation.
It follows that in a given integral we may impose a continuous deformation on the path of integration (keeping the endpoint fixed); as long as we do not pass through a point where f ( z) is not analytic, the value of the integral will not change under such deformation.
This is often called the principle of deformation of path.

The heavy curve in the figure shows the resulting deformed path.
Then deform E ′EGAA′ and E′G′A′ .
There is more general systemic approach to problem of this kind, as we shall now see.
3.3.3 Cauchy Theorem for Multiple Connected Domains A multiplys connected domain D* can be cut so that the resulting domain (that is, D* without the point of the cut or cuts) become simply connected.
~ For doubly connected domain D* we need one cut C (figure below).If f ( z) is analytic in D* and at each point of C and C then, since C , C and 1 2 1 2 C bound a simply connected domain, it follows from Cauchy’s theorem 90  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III ~ that the integral of f taken over C , C , C in the sense indicated by the 1 2 ~ arrows in the figure has the value zero.
Since we integrate along C in both directions, the corresponding integrals cancel out, and we obtain (3*) ∫ f ( z)dz + ∫ f ( z)dz = 0 C1 C2 where one of the curve is traversed in the counterclockwise sense and the other in the opposite sense.
Reversing the sense of integration on one of the curves, we may write this Fig 34: Doubly Connected Domain Fig.
35: Paths in (3) 3.
∫ f ( z)dz + ∫ f ( z)dz C1 C2 where curve now traversed in the same sense (the figure above).
We remember that (3) holds under the assumption that f ( z) is analytic in the domain bounded by C and C and at each point of C and C .
1 2 1 2 Can you see how the result in Example (7) now follows immediately from our present consideration?
For more complicated domains we may need more than one cuts, but the basic idea remains the same as before.
For instance, for the triply connected domain in figure below, ∫ f ( z)dz + ∫ f ( z)dz + ∫ f ( z)dz = 0 C1 C2 C3 where C and C are traversed in the same sense and C is traversed in the 2 3 1 opposite sense.

0 In the next section, using Cauchy integral theorem, we prove the existence of indefinite integrals of analytic functions.
This will also justify our earlier method of indefinite integration.
Fig.
39: Problem 29 3.4 Existence of Indefinite Integral This section includes an application of Cauchy’s integral theorem.
It relates to Theorem 2 in section 3.2 on the evaluation of line integrals by indefinite integration and substitution of the limits of integration: z 1.
∫ 1 f ( z)dz = F ( z ) − F ( z ) [F ′( z) = f ( z)], 1 0 z0 Where F ( z) is an indefinite integral of f(z), that is F ′( z) = f ( z) , as indicated.
In most applications, such a F ( z) can be found from differentiation formulas.
92  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Theorem 1 (Existence of an Indefinite Integral) If f ( z) is analytic in a simply connected domain D, then there exists an indefinite integral F ( z) of f(z)in D, which is analytic in D joining two points z and z in D, the integral of f(z) from z and z can be evaluated 0 1 0 1 by formula (1).
Proof The conditions of Cauchy’s integral theorem are satisfied.
Hence the line integral of f ( z) from z in D to any z in D is independent of path in 0 D. We keep z fixed.
Then this integral becomes a function of z, which 0 we denote by F ( z) : z 2.
F ( z) = ∫ 1 f ( z * )dz * .
z0 We show that this F ( z) is analytic in D and that F ′( z) = f ( z) .
The idea of doing this is as follows.
We form the differential quotient F ( z + ∆z) − F ( z) = 1 ∫+z ∆z * * − ∫ z +∆z * )dz *  ∆z z ∆z  f ( z )dz f ( z  z 0 0 = 1 ∫ z + ∆ z f ( z* )dz* , ∆z z 0 Subtract f ( z) from it and show that expression obtained approaches zero as ∆z → 0; this is done by using the continuity of f ( z) .
We now give the details.
Fig.
38: Path of Integration We keep z fixed.
Then we choose z + ∆z in D. This is possible since D is a domain; hence D contains a neighbourhood of z.
See figure above.
93 MT H 381 MODULE 2 The segment we use as the path of integration in the previous formula.
We now subtract f ( z) .
This is a constant, since z is kept fixed.
Hence ∫ z +∆z f ( z)dz * = f ( z)∫ z + ∆z d z * = f ( z)∆z.
z z Thus f ( z) = 1 ∫ z +∆z f ( z)dz * ∆z z This trick permits us to write a single integral: F ( z + ∆z) − F ( z) − f ( z) = 1 ∫ z +∆z [ f ( z * ) − f ( z)]dz * ∆z ∆z z0 f ( z) is analytic, hence continuous.
An e>0 being given, we can thus find a δ > 0 such that f ( z * ) − f ( z) < e when z * − z < δ Consequently, letting ∆z < δ , we see that the ML-inequality yields F ( z + ∆z) − F ( z) − f ( z) = 1 ∫ z +∆z [ f ( z * ) − f ( z) ]d z * ≤ 1 e ∆z = e; ∆z ∆z z0 ∆z that is, by the definition of a limit and of the derivative, F ( z + ∆z) − F ( z) F ′( z) = lim = f ( z).
∆z ∆z Since z is any point in D, this proves that F ( z) is analytic in D and is an indefinite integral or antiderivative of f ( z) in D, written F ( z) = ∫ f ( z)dz.
Also, if G′( z) = f ( z), then F ′( z) − G′( z) ≡ 0 in D; hence F ( z) − G( z) is constant in D. That is, two indefinite integrals of f ( z) .
This proves the theorem.
See section 3.2 for examples and problems on indefinite integration.
The theorem in this section followed from Cauchy’s integral theorem.
A much more fundamental consequence is Cauchy’s integral formula for evaluating integrals over close curves, which we discuss in the next section.
94  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 3.5 Cauchy’s Integral Formula The most important consequences of Cauchy’s integral theorem is Cauchy’s integral formula.
This formula is useful for evaluating integrals (see example below).
More importantly, it plays a key role in providing the surprising fact that analytic function have derivative of all orders (see section 3.6), In establishing Taylor series representations and so on.
Cauchy’s integral formula and its conditions of validity may be stated as follows.
Theorem 1 (Cauchy’s Integral Formula) Let f ( z) is analytic in a simply connected domain D. Then for any point z in D and any simple closed path C in D which encloses z (fig.
0 0 below), 1. f ( z) (Cauchy’s integral formula) ∫ dz = 2πif ( z ) 0 C z − z 0 The integration being taken in the counterclockwise sense.
Proof By addition and subtraction, f ( z) = f ( z ) + [ f ( z) − f ( z )].
.
We insert this 0 0 into (1) on the left and can take constant factor f ( z ) out from under the 0 integral sign.
Then f ( z) dz f ( z) − f ( z ) 2.
∫ dz = f ( z )∫ + ∫ 0 dz.
0 C z − z C z − z C z − z 0 0 0 The first on the right hand equals f ( z ) ⋅2πi (see Example 8 in sec.
3.3, 0 with m=-1).
This proves this theorem, provided the second integral on the right is zero.
This is what we are now going to show.
It’s integrand is analytic, except at z .
Hence by the principle of deformation of path 0 (sec.
3.3) we replace C by a small circle K of radius ρ and centre z 0 (figure below), without altering the value of the integral.
Since f ( z) is analytic, it is continuous.
Hence, an e>0 being given, we can find a δ > 0 such that f ( z) − f ( z ) < e for all z in the disk z − z < δ 0 0 95 MT H 381 MODULE 2 Fig.
39: Cauchy’s Integral Fig.
40: Proof of Formula Cauchy’s Integral Formula Choosing the radius ρ of k smaller than δ , we thus have the inequality f ( z) − f ( z ) ε 0 dz < z − z ρ 0 At each point of k. The length of k is 2πρ .Hence by ML-inequality in sec.
3.2, f ( z) − f ( z ) ε ∫ 0 dz < 2πρ = 2πε .
K z − z ρ 0 Since e(>0) can be choosing arbitrarily small, it follows that the last integral on the right-hand side of (2) has the value zero, and the theorem is proved.
Example 17 Cauchy’s Integral Formula ez ∫ dz = 2πe z = 2πe 2 C z − 2 z = 2 For any contour enclosing z = 2 (since e z is entire), and zero for any 0 contour for which z = 2 lies outside (by Cauchy’s integral theorem).
0 Example 18 Cauchy’s Integral Formula ∫ z 3 − 6 dz = ∫ z 3 − 3 dz = 2π [1 z 3 − 3] C 2z − i C 2 z − 1 i 2 z = i 2 2 π = − 6πi ( z = 1 i inside C) .

2 2i Solution To see what is going on, locate the point where g(z) is not analytic and sketch them along with the contours (figure below) .
These points are -1 and1.
We see that (b) will give the same result as (a), by the principle of deformation of path.
And (d) gives zero, By Cauchy’s integral theorem.
We consider (a) and afterward (c).
Here z = 1, so that z − z = z −1in (1).
Hence we must write 0 0 z 2 + 1 z 2 + 1 1 z 2 + 1 g ( z ) = = ( )( ); thus f ( z) = , z 2 − 1 z + 1 z − 1 z 2 −1 Fig.
41: Example 3 Looking back, we point to a chain of basic results.
The beginning was Cauchy’s integral theorem in sec.
3.3.
From it followed Cauchy’s integral formula (1) in this section.
From it follows the existence of all higher derivatives of an analytic function, in the next section.
This is the probably the most exciting link of our chain.
From it follows in the Taylor series for analytic functions.
97 MT H 381 MODULE 2 3.6 Derivative of Analytic Functions From the assumption that a real function of a real variable is once differentiable, nothing follows about the existence of derivatives of higher order.
We shall now see that from the assumption that a complex function has a first derivative in a domain D, there follows the existence of derivative of all orders in D. This means that in this respect complex analytic functions behave much more simply than real functions that are once differentiable.
Theorem 1 (Derivative of Analytic Function) If f ( z) is analytic in a domain D, then it has derivatives of all orders in D, which are then also analytic function in D. The value of these derivatives at a point z in D are given by the formulas 0 1 f ( z) (1′) f ′( z ) = ∫ dz 0 2πi C ( z − z ) 2 0 2!
f ( z) (1′′) f ′′( z ) = ∫ dz 0 2πi C ( z − z ) 3 0 and in general n!
f ( z) (1) f n ( z ) = ∫ dz (n =1,2,⋅⋅⋅⋅); 0 2πi C ( z − z ) n +1 0 here C is any simple closed path in D that encloses z and whose full 0 interior belongs to D; And we integrate counterclockwise around C(figure below).
Comment For memorizing (1), it is useful to observe that these formulas are obtained formally by differentiating the Cauchy formula (1), Sec.
3.5, under the integral sign with respect to z .
0 Proof of Theorem We prove (1′) .
We start from the definition f ( z + ∆z) − f ( z ) f ′( z ) = lim 0 0 0 ∆z →0 ∆z 98  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III On the right we represent f ( z + ∆z) and f ( z ) by Cauchy’s integral 0 0 formula (1), sec.
3.5; we can combine the two integrals into a single integral by taking the common denominator and simplifying the numerator (where z − z drops out and only f ( z)∆z remains): 0 f ( z + ∆z) − f ( z ) 1  f ( z) f ( z)  0 0 = ∫ dz − ∫ dz ∆z 2πi∆z  C z − ( z0 + ∆z) C z − z0  1 f ( z) = ∫ dz ⋅ 2πi∆z C ( z − z − ∆z)( z − z ) 0 0 Fig.
42: Theorem 1 and its Proof Clearly, we can now establish (1′) by showing that, as ∆z → 0, the integral on the right approaches the integral in (1′) .
To do this, we consider the difference between these two integrals.
We can write this difference as a single integral by taking the common denominator and simplifying.
This gives f ( z) f ( z) ∫ dz − ∫ dz C ( z − z0 − ∆z)( z − z0 ) C ( z − z0 ) 2 f ( z) = ∫ dz C ( z − z − ∆z)( z − z ) 0 0 We show by ML-inequality (Sec.
3.2) that this difference approaches zero as ∆z → 0, .
Being analytic, the function f ( z) is continuous on C , hence bounded in absolute value, say, f ( z) ≤ K .
Let d be the smallest distance from z to 0 the points of C(see fig.
below).
Then for all z on C, z − z 2 ≥ d 2 , 0 hence 99 MT H 381 MODULE 2 1 1 ≤ ⋅ z − z0 2 d 2 Furthermore, if ∆z ≤ d 2, then for all z on C we also have d 1 2 z − z − ∆z ≥ , hence ≤ ⋅ 0 2 z − z − ∆z d 0 Let L be the length of C. Then by ML-inequality, if ∆z ≤ d 2, f ( z) 2 1 ∫ dz ≤ K ∆z ⋅ ⋅ C ( z − z0 − ∆z)( z − z0 ) 2 d d 2 This approaches zero as ∆z → 0, Formula (1′) is proved.
Note that we used Cauchy’s integral formula (1), Sec.
3.5, but if all we had known about f ( z ) is the fact that it can be represented by (1), 0 Sec.
3.5, our argument would have established the existence of the derivative f ′( z ) of f ( z) .This is essential to continuation and 0 completion of this proof, because it implies that (1′′) can be proved by similar argument, with f replaced by f ′ , and that the general formula (1) then follows by induction.

25 3.6.1 Moreras’s Theorem If f ( z) is continuous in a simply connected domain D and if 2.
∫ f ( z)dz = 0 C for every closed path in D, then f ( z) is analytic in D. Proof In sec.3.4 it was shown that if f ( z) F ( z) = ∫ z f ( z* )dz* z0 is analytic in D and F ′( z) = f ( z) .
In the proof we use only the continuity of f ( z) and the property that its integral around every close path in D is zero; from the assumptions we concluded that F ( z) is analytic.
By theorem 1, the derivative of F ( z) is analytic, that is f ( z) is analytic in D, and Morera’s theorem is proved.
Theorem 1 also yields a basic inequality that has many applications.
To get it, all we have to do is to choose for C in (1) a circle of radius r and centre z and apply ML-inequality (Sec.

0 r n To gain first impression of the importance of this inequality, let us prove a famous theorem on entire functions (functions that are analytic for all z; cf.Sec.
2.6) 3.6.2 Liouville’s Theorem If an entire function f ( z) is bounded in absolute value for all z, then f ( z) must be a constant.
Proof By assumption, f ( z) is bounded, say, f ( z) < K for all z.
Using (3), we see that f ′( z ) < K / r .Since this is true for every r, we can take r as 0 large as we please and conclude that f ′( z ) = 0 .
Since z is arbitrary, 0 0 f ′( z) = 0 for all z, and f ( z) is a constant.
This completes the proof.
This is the end of section on complex integration, which gave us a first impression of the methods that have no counterpart in real integral calculus.
We have seen that these methods result directly or indirectly from Cauchy’s integral theorem (Sec.3..3) More on integration follows in the next section.
In the next section, we consider power series, which play a great role in complex analysis, and we shall see that the Taylor series of calculus have a complex counterpart, so that e z , cos z, sin z etc.
have Maclaurin series that are quite similar to those in calculus.
4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, we state that if a function is analytic, it has derivative of all orders.

We intend (may) use the formula for b for evaluating complex integrals in a very elegant and 1 simple fashion.
b will be called the residue or f ( z) at z = z .The 1 0 powerful method may also be applied for evaluation certain real integrals, as we shall see in section 3.3 and 3.4 of module 3 and unit 1.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • determine and explain Residue • use Residue to evaluate integrals and • show that the Residue integration method can be extended to the case of several singular points of f ( z) inside C. 105 MT H 381 MODULE 3 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Residues Let us first explain what a residue is and how it can be used for evaluating Integrals f ( z)dz.
∫ C There will be counter integral taken around a simple closed path C. If f ( z) is analytic everywhere on C and inside C, such an integral is zero by Cauchy’s integral theorem and we are done.
If f ( z) has a singularity at a point z = z inside C, but is otherwise 0 analytic on C and inside, then f ( z) has a Laurent series ∞ b b f ( z) = ∑ a ( z − z ) n + 1 + 2 + ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ n =0 n 0 z − z0 ( z − z0 ) 2 That converges for all points near z = z0 (except at z = z0 itself), in some domain of the form 0 < z = z0 < R .
Now comes the key idea.
The 1 coefficient b of the first negative power of this Laurent series is 1 ( z = z ) 0 given by the integral formula, with n=1, that is, 1 b1 = 2πi ∫ f ( z)dz, C Since we can obtain Laurent series by various methods, without using the integral formulas for the coefficients, we can find b by one of these 1 methods and then use the formula for b for evaluating the integral: 1 1.
∫ f ( z)dz = 2πib .
1 C Here we integrate in the counterclockwise sense around the simple closed path that contains z = z in its interior.
0 The coefficient b1 is called the residue of f ( z) at z = z0 and we shall denote it by 2. b = Re s f ( z) 1 z = z0 106  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Example1 Evaluation of an Integral by Means of a Residue Integrate the function f ( z) = z −4 around the unit circle C in the counterclockwise sense.
Solution We obtain the Laurent series thus: sin z 1 1 z z 3 f ( z) = = − + − + ⋅⋅⋅⋅ z 4 z 3 3!
z 5!
7!
Which converges for [z[ > 0 (that is for all z ≠ 0). )
This series shows that f ( z) has a pole of third order at z = 0 and the residue of f ( z) at z = 0 is b1 = 13 !.
From (1) we thus obtain the answer sin z πi ∫ dz = 2π ib = − .
C z 4 1 3 Example 2 Be Careful to use the right Laurent Series!
Integrate f ( z) = 1 ( z 3 − z 4 ) around the circle C: z = 1 2 in the clockwise sense.
Solution z 3 − z 4 = z 3 (1 − z) Shows f ( z) that z = 0 and z = 1.
Now z = 1lies outside C. Hence it is of no interest here.
So we need the residue of f ( z) at 0.
We find it from the Laurent series that converges for 0 < z < 1 that 1 1 1 1 = + + +1 + z + ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ 0 < z < 1 z 3 − z 4 z 3 z 2 z We see it from this residue is 1.
Clockwise integration thus yields dz ∫ = −2πi Re s f ( z) = − 2πi C z 3 − z 4 z =0 107 MT H 381 MODULE 3 Caution!

3.1.1 Two Formulas for Residues at Simple Poles Before we continue the integration, we ask the following question: To get a residue, a single coefficient of a Laurent series, must we divide the whole series or is there a more economical way?
For poles, there is.
We shall derive, once and for all, some formulas for residues at poles, so that in this case we no longer need the whole series.
Let f ( z) have a simple pole at z = z0 b f ( z) = 1 + a + a ( z − z ) + a ( z − z ) 2 + ⋅⋅⋅ 0 < z − z < R z − z 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 Here b = 0 (why?)
Multiply both sides by z − z we have 1 0 ( z − z ) f ( z) = b + ( z − z )[a 0 + a ( z − z ) + ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅] 0 1 0 1 0 We now let z → z .
The right hand side approaches b .
This gives 0 1 Re s f ( z) = b = lim( z − z ) f ( z) (3) 1 0 z = z0 z = z0 Example 3 Residue at a Simple Pole 9i + 1 9i + 1  9 z + 1  Re s = lim( z − i) =   z = z0 z( z 2 + 1) z =i z( z + i)  z( z + i) z =1  10i = = −5i − 2 Another, sometimes simpler formula for the residue at a simple pole is obtained by starting from p( z) f ( z) = q( z) 108  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III with analytic p( z) and q( z) where we assume that p( z ) ≠ 0 and q( z) has a 0 simple zero at z − z (so that f ( z) has a simple pole at z − z ad wanted.
By 0 0 the definition of a simple zero, q( z) has a Taylor series of the form q( z) = ( z − z )q′( z ) + ( z − z0 ) 2 q′′( z ) + 0 0 2!
0 ⋅⋅⋅ This we substitute into f = p q and then f into (3), finding Rz = e z 0s f ( z) = lzi = m z 0 ( z − i) qp(( zz) ) = lzi = m z 0  ( z − z 0 )[q′( z 0 () z + − ( zz 0− ) pz 0( )zq) ′′( z 0 ) / 2 + ] =z 1 ⋅⋅⋅ We now see that on the right, a factor z − z is cancelled and resulting 0 denominator has the limit q′( z ) .
Hence our second formula for the 0 residue at a pole is p( z) p( z ) Re s f ( z) = Re = 0 .
(4) s z = z0 z = z0 q( z) q( z0 ) Example 4 Residue at a Simple Pole Calculated by Formula (4) 9z + i  9z + i 10i Re s == = = −5i    z =i z( z 2 + 1)  3z 2 + 1) − z =i  2 Example 5 Another Application of Formula (4) cos πz f ( z) = .
z 4 − 1 Solution p( z) = cos πz is entire, and q( z) = z 4 −1 has a simple zero at1,i,-1,-i.
Hence f ( z) has a simple pole at these points (and no further poles).
Since q ′ ( z ) = 4 z 3 , we see from (4) that the residue equal the  cosh πi  value for   at those points, that is,  4z 3  cosh π cosh πi cos π i cosh π cosh(−πi) i ≈ 2.8980, = = − , - , = .

0 0 1 0 We see that the residue b of f ( z) at z = z is now the coefficient of the 1 0 power ( z − z )m −1 in the Taylor series of the function 0 g (s) = ( z − z )m f ( z) 0 On the left, with center z = z .Thus by Taylor’s theorem, 0 b = 1 g ( m−1) ( z ) 1 (m −1)!
0 Hence if f ( z) has a pole of mth order at z = z , the residue is given by 0 Re s f ( z) = 1 lim dm −1 [( z − z ) m f ( z)].
(5) z = z0 (m − 1) z = z0 d z m−1 0  In particular, for a second-order pole (m=2), Re s f ( z) = lim{[( z − z )2 f ( z)′]}.
0 z = z0 z = z0 Example 6 Residue at a Pole of Higher Order The function 50z f ( z) = ( z + 4)( z −12 ) has a pole pole of second order at z = 1 Re s f ( z) = lim d [( z − 1) 2 f ( z)] = lim d  50z   = 8 z =1 z →1 dz z →1 dz  z + 4  110  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Example 7 Residue from a Partial Fraction If f ( z) is rational, we can also determine its residue from partial fractions.
In Example 6, 50z − 8 8 10 f ( z) = = + + .
( z + 4)( z − 1) 2 z + 4 z − 1 ( z − 1) 2 This shows that the residue t z = 1 is 8 (as before),and at z=-4 (simple pole) it is -8.
Why is this so?
Consider z = 1 .
There the Laurent has two fractions as its principal part and the first fraction as the sum of the other part.
This first fraction is analytic at z = 1 , so that it has a Taylor series with centre z = 1 , as it should be.
Similarly, at z=4 the first fraction is the principal part of the Laurent series.
Example 8 Integration around a Second-order Pole Counterclockwise integration around any simple closed path C such that z = 1 is inside C and z=4 outside C yields z z 8 ∫ dz = Res 2πi = 2πi ≈ 1.0053i C (z + 4)(z −1)2 z=1 (z + 4)(z −1)2 50 So far we can evaluate integrals of analytic functions f ( z) over closed curve C when f ( z) has only one singular point inside C .
In the next section we show that the residue integration method can be readily extended to the case of several singular points of f ( z) inside C .
3.2 Residue Theorem So far we are in a position to evaluate contour integrals whose integrands have only a single isolated singularity inside the contour of integration.
We shall now see that our simple method may be extended to the case when the integrand has several isolated singularity inside the contour.
This extension is surprisingly simple, as follows Residue Theorem Let f ( z) be a function that is analytic inside a simple closed path C and on C , except for finitely many singular point z , z ,⋅⋅⋅⋅, z inside C .

By (1) in the previous section ∫ f ( z)dz = Re s f ( z), C j z = z j So that (3) yields (1), and the theorem is proved.
This important theorem has various applications with complex and real integrals.
We shall first consider some complex integrals.

In the next section we discuss two methods for accomplishing this goal.
3.3 Evaluation of Real Integral We want to show that residue theorem also yields a very elegant and simple method for evaluating certain classes of complicated real integrals.
114  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Integrals of Rational fractions of Cosθ and Sinθ We first consider integrals of the type I = ∫2 π F (cosθ , sin θ )dθ (1) 0 where F (cosθ , sin θ ) is a real rational fraction of Cosθ and Sinθ [for example, (sin 2 θ ) (5 − 4 cosθ ) and is finite on the interval of integration.
Setting eiθ = z, we obtain 1 1  1  cosθ = (eiθ + e −iθ ) =  z +  (2) 2 2  2  1 1  1  sin θ = (e iθ − e −iθ ) =  z −  2i 2i  2  and we see that the integrand becomes a rational function of z, say, f ( z) .
Asθ ranges from0 to 2π , the variable z ranges once around the unit circle z = 1in the counterclockwise sense.
Since we have dθ = dz iz , and the given integral takes the form dz I = ∫ f ( z) , (3) C iz The integration being taken counterclockwise around the unit circle.
Example 11 An Integral of the Type (1) Show by the present method that 2 π dθ 0∫ = 2π 2 − cosθ Solution dz We use cosθ = ( z + 1 ) and dθ = .
Then the integral becomes z iz 115 MT H 381 MODULE 3 dz iz dz 2 dz ∫ = ∫ = ∫ C 2 + 1  z + 1  C c + i ( z 2 + 2 2z + 1) i C ( z − 2 − 1)( z − 2 + 1) 2  z  2 We see that the integrand has two simple poles, one at z = 2 + 1, which 1 lies outside the unit circle.
C: z = 1 and is thus of no interest, and the other at z = 2 − 1 inside C, where the residue is 2 1  1 1 Re s = − .
 =   z = z 2 ( z − 2 − 1)( z − 2 + 1)  z 2 − 1 2 z 2 −1 − = Together with the factor − 2 i in front of the integral this yields the desired result 2πi(−2 / i)(−1/ 2) = 2π 3.3.1 Improper Integrals of Rational Function We now consider the real integral of the type ∞ ∫ f ( x)dx (4) −∞ Such an integral, for which the interval of integration is not finite, is called an improper integral, and it has the meaning ∫∞ f ( x)dx = lim ∫ 0 f ( x)dx + lim ∫ b f ( x)dx.
(5a) −∞ →−∞ →−∞ a a b 0 If both limit exist, we may couple the two independent passages to − ∞ and ∞ , and write ∞ R ∫ f ( x)dx = l im∫ f ( x)dx (5b) −∞ R→ ∞ −R We assume that the function f ( x) in (4) is a real rational function whose denominator is different from zero for all real x and is of degree at least two units higher than the degree of denominator.
Then the limit in (5a) exists, and we may start from (5b).
We may consider the corresponding contour integral ∫ f ( z)dz (5c) C Around a path C on the diagram below.
Since f ( x) is rational, f ( z) has finitely many poles in the upper-half plane, and if we choose R large 116  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III enough, then 117  MTH 381 MODULE 3 Fig.
44: Path C of the Contour Integral in (5*) C encloses all these poles .By the residue theorem we then obtain ∫ f ( z)dz = ∫ f ( z)dz + ∫ R f ( x)dx = 2πi∑ Re sf ( z) C S − R When the sun consists of all the residues, of f ( z) at the point in the upper half-plane at which f ( z) has a pole.
From this we have (6) ∫ R f ( x)dx = 2πi∑ Re s f ( z) −∫ f ( z)dz − R S We prove that R → ∞ ,the value of the integral over the semicircle S approaches zero.
If we set z = R eiθ , then S is represented by R = const, and as z ranges along S, the variable θ ranges from0 to π .Since, by assumption, the degree of the denominator of f ( z) is at least two units higher than the degree of the numerator, we have k f ( z) < 2 ( z = R > R0 ) z for sufficiently large constants k and R .
By the ML-inequality 0 k kπ ∫ f ( z)dz < πR = (R > R ) S R 2 R 0 Hence, as R approaches infinity, the value of the integral over S approaches zero, and (5) and (6) yield the result (7) ∞ ∫ f ( x)dx = 2πi∑ Re s f ( z) −∞ the sum being extended over the residues of f ( z) corresponding to the poles of f ( z) in the upper half-plane.
118  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Example 12 An Improper Integral from 0 to ∞ Using (7), show that ∞ dx π ∫ 0 1 + x4 = 2 2 Solution 1 Indeed, f ( z) = has four simple poles at the points (1 + z 4 ) z eπ i 4 , z e 3πi 4 , z e −3πi 4 , z e −πi 4 1 2 3 4 The first two of these poles lie in the upper-half plane.
We find Re s f ( z) =  1   1 = 1 e −3πi 4 , = z = z1  (1 + z 4 )′ z = z1  4z 3 z = z1 4    1   1 1 Re s f ( z) = = e −9πi 4    z = z1  (1 + z 4 )′ z = z2 =   4z 3 z = z2 4   By (1) and (7), in the current section, ∫∞ dx = 2πi (−eπi 4 + e −πi 4 ) = π sin π = π .

−∞x 4 + 5x = 2 + 4 6 Solution The degree of denominator is two units higher than that of the numerator, so that our method again applies.
Now p( z) z 2 − 1 z 2 − 1 f ( z) = = = q z z + z + z z has simple poles at 2i and i in the upper-plane (and at − 2i and − i in the lower half-plane, which are of no interest here).
We calculate the residues from (4), noting that q′( z) = 4 z 3 + 10 z , Re s f ( z) =  z 2 − 1 = 5 , Re s f ( z) = z 2 − 1 = − 2    z = 2i  4z 3 + 10  12i z =i  4 z 3 +  6i z = 2i z =i z π 10z Ans.2πi(5 / 12i −1 / 3i) = , as asserted.
6 Looking back, we realise that the key ideas of our present methods were these.
In the first method we mapped the interval of integration on the real axis onto a closed curved in the complex plane (the unit circle).
In the second method we attached to an interval on the real axis a semi circle such that we got a closed curve in the complex plane, which we then “blew up.” This second method can be applied to further types of integrals, as we show in the next section, the last in the chapter.
3.4 Further Types of Real Integrals There are further classes of integrals that can be evaluated by applying the residue theorem to suitable complex integrals.
In application suchintegral may arise in connection with integral transformations or representation of special functions.
In the present section we shall consider two such classes of integrals.
One of them is important in the problems involving the Fourier integral representation.
The other class consists of real integral whose integrand is finite at some point in the interval of integration.
121 MT H 381 MODULE 3 3.4.1 Fourier Integral Real integral of the form ∞ ∞ 1.
∫ f ( x) = cos sxdx and ∫ f ( x) = sin sxdx (s real) −∞ −∞ occur in connection with the Fourier integral.
If f ( x) is a rational function satisfying the assumptions on the degree stated in connection with (4), then the integral (1) may be evaluated in a similar to that used for the integral in (4) of the previous section.
In fact, we may then consider the corresponding integral ∫ f ( z)e isz dz ( s real and positive) C Over the contour C in sec 3.3 instead of (7), sec.
3.3, we get ∫ ∞ f ( z)eisz dz = 2πi∑ Re s[ f ( z)e isz ] ( s > 0 ) (2) −∞ where the sum consists of the residue of f ( z)eisz as its pole in the upper half-plane.
Equating the and imaginary parts on both sides of (2), we have ∫ ∞ f ( x) cos sxdx = −2πi∑ Im Re s[ f ( z)eisz ], −∞ ( s > 0 )(3) ∫∞ f ( x) sin sxdx = 2πi∑ Re Re s[ f ( z)e isz ] −∞ We remember that (7), was established by proving that the value of the integral over the semicircle S in fig.
approaches zero as R → ∞ .
To establish (2) we should now prove the same fact for our present contour integral.
This can be done as follows, Since S lies in the upper half-plane y ≥ 0 and s > 0 , we see that eisz = e isx e −isy = e − sy ≤ 1 ( s > 0 , y ≥ 0 ) From this obtain the inequality f ( z)e isz =) = f ( z eisz ≤ f ( z ( s > 0 , y ≥ 0 ) which reduces our present problem to that in previous section.
120  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III Continuing as before, we see that the value of the integral under consideration approaches zero as R approaches infinity.
This establishes (2), which implies (3).
Example 14 An Application of (3) Show that ∞ cos sx π ∞ sin sx ∫ dx = e ks , ∫ dx = 0 (s > 0, k > 0) −∞ k 2 + x 2 k −∞ k 2 + x 2 Solution eisz In fact, has only one pole in the upper plane, namely, a simple k 2 + x 2 pole at z = ik , and from (4) we obtain e isz  e isz  e − ks Re s   k 2 + z 2 =  =  .
 2z 2ik   z =ik   z =ik Therefore, ∫∞ e isz dx = 2πi e − ks = π e ks .
−∞ k 2 + z 2 2ik k Since eisx = cos sx + i sin sx, this yields the above results 3.4.2 Types of Real Improper Integrals Another kind of improper integral is a definite integral B ∫ f ( x)dx (4) A whose integral becomes infinite at a point a in the interval of integration, lim f ( x) = ∞ x→a Then the integral (4) means ∫ B f ( x)dx = lim ∫ a −τ f ( x)dx + lim ∫ B f ( x)dx (5) A τ →a A η →0 a +η 121 MT H 381 MODULE 3 where τ and η approaches zero independently and through positive values.
It may happen that neither of these limits exists, if τ,η →0 independently, but τ →li0m  ∫Aa − τ f ( x)dx + ∫a B + η f ( x)dx  (6) exists.
This is called the Cauchy principal value of the integral.
It is written pv.v.
∫B f ( x)dx.
A For example, 1 dx  −τ 1 dx  dx pv.v.
∫− 1 x 3 = τl i→m0  ∫− x 3 + ∫τ x 3  = 0 the principal value exists although the integral itself has no meaning.
The whole situation is quite similar to that discussed in the second part of the previous section.
To evaluate improper integral whose integrands have poles on the real axis, we use a part that avoids these singularities by following small semi-circles at the singular points; the procedure may be illustrated by the following example.
Example 15 An Application Show that ∫ ∞ sin x dx = π .
0 x 2 (This is the limit of sine integral Si(x) as x → ∞ ) Solution (sin z) a.
We do not consider because this function does not behave z eiz suitably at infinity.
We consider , which has a simple pole at z e iz z=0, and integrate around the contour in figure below.
Since is z analytic inside and on C Cauchy’s integral theorem gives 122  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III e iz ∫ dz = 0 (7) C z b.
We prove that the value of the integral over the large semicircle C approaches R as approaches infinity.
Setting 1 dz z = R e iθ .dz = iR e iθ dθ , and therefore z = idθ ∫ ei z dz = ∫ π e iz idθ ≤ ∫ π e iz dθ ( z = R e iθ ) C z 0 0 In the integrant on the right, eiz = e iR (cosθ +i sin θ ) = e iR cos θ e − R sin θ = e − R sin θ .
We insert this, sin(π − θ ) = sin θ to get an integral from 0 to π 2 , and then ϖ ≥ 2θ π (when 0 ≤ θ ≤ π 2 ); to get an integral that we can evaluate: Fig.
46: Contour in Example 2 Fig.
47: Inequality in Example 2 ∫ π e iz dθ = ∫π e − R sin θ dθ = ∫ π 2 e − R sin θdθ dθ 0 0 0 123 MT H 381 MODULE 3 π 2 π < 2 ∫ e −2 Rθ π d θ = (1 − e − R) → 0 as R → ∞C 0 R 1 Hence the value of the integral over C approaches as R → ∞ 1 c. For the integral over small semicircle C in figure above , we 2 have ∫ e iz dz = ∫ dz + ∫ e iz −1d z C2 z C2 z C2 z The first integral on the right equals − πi .
The integral of the second integral is analytic and thus bounded, say, less than some constant M in absolute value for all z on C and between C and 2 2 the x-axis.
Hence by the ML − inequality, the absolute value of this integral cannot exceed Mπr .
This approaches r → 0 .
Because of part (b), from (7) we thus obtain ∫ e iz dz = pv.v.∫ ∞ eix dx + lim∫ eiz dz C2 z −∞ x r →0 C2 z ∞ e ix = pv.v.∫ dx − πi = 0 −∞ x Hence this principal value equals πi ; its real part is 0 and its imaginary part is ∞ sin x pv.v.∫ dx = π (8) −∞ x d. Now the integrand in (8) is not singular at x = 0 .
Furthermore, Since for positive x the function 1 x decreases, the area under the curve of the integrand between two consecutive positive zeros decreases in a monotone fashion, that is, the absolute value of the integrals n π +π sin x I = ∫ dx n = 0,1,⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ n nπ x From a monotone decreasing sequence, I , I ,⋅⋅⋅⋅and I → 0 as n → ∞ .
1 2 n Since these integrals have alternating sign (why?
), it follows from the Leibniz test that the infinite series I + I + I + ⋅⋅⋅⋅converges.
Clearly, 0 1 2 the sum of the series is the integral ∫ ∞ sin x dx = lim ∫ b sin x dx x →∞ x 0 b 0 which therefore exists.
Similarly the integral from 0 to − ∞ exists.
Hence we need not take the principal value in (8), and 124  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III ∞ sin x ∫ dx = π −∞ x Since the integrand is an even function, the desired result follows.
In part (c) of example 2 we avoided the simple pole by integrating along a small semicircle C , and then we let C shrink to a point.
This process 2 2 suggests the following.
3.4.3 Simple Poles on the Real Axis If ( z) has a simple pole at z = a on the real axis, then lim ∫ f ( z)dz = πi Re s f ( z).
r →0 C2 z =a Fig.
48: Theorem 1 Proof By the definition of a simple pole the integrand f ( z) has at z = a the Laurent series b f ( z) = 1 + g ( z), b = Re s f ( z) z − a 1 z = a where g ( z) is analytic on the semicircle of integration C : z = a + reiθ , 0 ≤ θ = π 2 and for all z between C and the x-axis.

This is the end of unit 1, which added another powerful general integration method to the methods discussed in the chapter on integration.
Remember that our present residue method is based on Laurent series, which we therefore had to discuss first.
In the next chapter we present a systemic discussion of mapping by analytic functions (“conformal mapping”) .Conformal mapping will then be applied to potential theory, our last chapter on complex analysis.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, we have seen that our simple method have been extended to the case when the integrand has several isolated singularities inside the contour.
We also proved the residue theorem.
5.0 SUMMARY The residue of an analytic function f ( z) at a point z = z0 is the 1 coefficient of the power in the Laurent series z − z 0 b b f ( z) = a + a ( z − z ) + ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 1 + 2 + ⋅⋅⋅⋅ of f ( z) which 0 1 0 z − z0 ( z − z0 ) 2 converges near z (except at z itself).
This residue is given by the 0 0 integral 3.1 1 b1 = 2πi ∫ f ( z)dz (1) C but can be obtained in various other ways, so that one can use (1) for evaluating integral over closed curves.
More generally, the residue theorem (sec.3.2) states that if f ( z) is analytic in a domain D such except at finitely many points z and C is a simple close path in D such j that no z lies on C and the full interior of C belongs to D, then j 1 ∫ f ( z)dz = ∑ Re s f ( z) (2) C j 2πi j z = z j (summation only over those z that lie inside C ).

5 − 4 cosθ Another method of integrating real integrals by residues is the use of a closed contour consisting of an interval − R ≤ x ≤ R of the real axis and a semicircle z = R .
From the residue theorem, if we let R → ∞, we obtain for rational f ( x) = p( x) q( x) (with q( x) ≠ 0 and q > degree p + 2 ) ∫ ∞ f ( x)dx = 2πi∑ Re sf ( z) (sec.3.3) −∞ ∫ ∞ cos sxdx = −2π ∑ Im Re s[ f ( z)eisz ] −∞ ∫ ∞sin sxdx = 2π ∑ Im Re s[ f ( z)eisz (sec.3.4) ] −∞ (sum of all residues at poles in the upper-half plane).
In sec.3.4, we also extend this method to real integrals whose integrands become infinite at some point in the interval of integration.

The integral transform method is given by F ( p) = ∫ b f ( x)k ( x, ρ )dx a With the inverse, b f ( x) = ∑ F ( p)H ( x, ρ ) p = a F (ρ ) is the integral transform of f ( x) and k ( x, ρ ) is called the kernel of the transformation.
129 MT H 381 MODULE 4 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • state various form of integral transform • state Fourier Sine series and Fourier Cosine series • apply Fourier transform to solve some fourth, third and second order differential equations • develop techniques and methods through transformation or along with transform to be able to solve physical and mechanical problems (vibrations).
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Finite Fourier Transform Let f ( x) be a function defined in the interval a ≤ x ≤ b i.e.
f ( x) is defined on x -space.
Let k ( x, ρ ) be a function x of and some parameter ρ .
Then the integral transform method is given by, F ( p) = ∫b f ( x)k ( x, ρ )dx (1) a F (ρ ) is called an integral transform of f ( x) and k ( x, ρ ) is called the kernel of the transform Symbolically, F = Tf (2) where T is an integral operator which means multiply what follows T by k ( x, p) and integrate the product with respect to x between the limit of ' a' and ' b' .
The new function F (ρ ) can be regarded as the image of f ( x) produced by T .
F ( p) is defined on p-space/image-space.
For integral transform to be a useful concept, it is necessary that there should exist an inverse operator T −1 which yields a unique F (t) from a given F (ρ ) .
From equation (2) we have that: f = T −1 (F ) (3) Finding the operator T −1 is equivalent to solving equation (1) regardless an integral equation for f (t ) 130  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III f (t ) = ∫β F (ρ )H (ρ , x)dρ (4) α i.e.
F (t) is an integral transform of F (ρ ) with kernel H (ρ , x) .
A specification of the T −1 operator as in equation (4) is known as Inversion Theorem.

(27) However, it worth mentioning here that the function cos nx is even, while the function sin nx is odd.

The process of solution consists of three main steps: In this way the Laplace transformation reduces the problem of solving a differential equation to an algebraic problem.
The Laplace transform is the most important method used in solving engineering mathematics.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • undergo the three main steps of solving initial and boundary value problem.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Classical Laplace Transform Let f be a function of the real variable t which is defined for all t ≥ 0 and which is either continuous or at least sectionally continuous.
151 MT H 381 MODULE 4 The classical Laplace Transform † of f is the function F (s) defined 0 by the formula ∞ F (s) ≡ l {f(t)} = ∫ e -st f(t) dt.
(1) 0 0 This definition of F (s) clearly makes sense only for those values of s for 0 which the infinite integral is convergent.
For many applications it is enough to regard s as a real parameter, but in general it should be taken as complex, say s = σ + iω .
Thus F (s) is really a function of a complex 0 variable defined over a certain region of the complex plane; the region of definition comprises just those values of s for which the infinite integral exists.
3.1.1 Elementary Applications of the Laplace Transform Depend Essentially on Three Basic Properties i. Linearity.
If the Laplace Transforms of f and g are F (s) and 0 G (s) respectively, and if a and a are any (real) constants, then 0 1 2 the Laplace Transform of the function h defined by is h(t) = a f(t) + a g(t) 1 2 H (s) = a F (s) + a G (s).
(2) 0 1 0 2 0 The proof is trivial.
ii.
Transform of a Derivative.
If f is differentiable (and therefore continuous) for f ≥ 0, then = sF0(s) – f(0).
(3) Proof Using integration by parts we have ∞ t[f'(t)] = ∫ 0 e − st f (t )dt = [e − st f (t ) ]0∞ se− st f (t )dt ∞ = - f(0) + s ∫ e −st f (t )dt 0 Since lim e-stf(t) = 0 Corollary.
If f is n-times differentiable for t ≥ 0, then t [f(n)(t)] = snF (s) – sn – 1f(0) – sn – 2 f'(0) …….. – f(n- 1)(0).
0 150  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III iii.
The Convelution Theorem.
Let f and g have Laplace Transforms F (s) and G (s) respectively, and define h as follows: 0 0 t H(t) = ∫ f (τ ) g (t − τ )dτ , t ≥ 0.
0 Then, t [h(t)] = F (s)G (s).
(4) 0 0 (Recall that h, as defined here, is the convolution of the functions u(t)f(t) and u(t)g(t).
If f and g happen to be functions which vanish identically for all negative values of t then the above result can be expressed in the form: The Laplace Transform of the convolution of f and g is the product of the individual Laplace Transform.
Proof The Laplace Transform of h is given by  t  H0(s) = ∫ 0∞ e −s t  ∫0 f (τ ) g (t − τ )dτ  dt.
Now, t ∞ ∫ f (τ ) g (t − τ )dτ = ∫ f (τ ) g (t − τ )u(t − τ )dτ 0 0 because u(t - τ ) = 1 for all τ such that τ < t and u(t - τ ) = 0 for all τ such that τ > t. Hence ∞  ∞  H0(s) = ∫ e − s t ∫ f (τ ) g (t − τ )u(t − τ )dτ dt.
0 0   Again, ∞ ∞ ∫ g (t − τ )u(t − τ )e −st dt = ∫ g (t − τ )e −st dτ 0 τ because u(t -τ ) = 1 for all t such that t > τ , and u(t -τ ) = 0 for all t such that t < τ .
Thus, ∞  ∞  − ∫ ∫ H0(s) = f (τ ) g (t − τ )e st dt dτ .
0 τ   And so putting T = t - τ , we get ∞  ∞  H0(s) = ∫ f (τ )∫ g (T )e −s (T +τ ) dT  dτ .
0  0  151  MTH 381 MODULE 4 Since T = 0 when t = τ .
152  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III That is, ∞ ∞ H0(s) = ∫ 0 f (τ )e − st dτ∫ 0 g (T )e − sT dT = F0 (s)D 0 (s).
Remark The change in the order of integration in the proof given above is justified by the absolute convergence of the integrals concerned.
3.1.2 Applications of Laplace The most immediate application of these properties is in the solution of ordinary differential equations with constants.
Consider the case of the general second-order equation d 2 y dy a + 2 b + cy = f(t) (5) dt 2 dt Where y(0) = α and d'(0) = β .
If l [y(t)] = Y0(s) then  dy   d y  l = sY (s) - α , and l = 2Y0(s) - α s - β .
2  d t  0  dt 2   Taking Laplace Transforms of both sides of (5.5) therefore gives a[s2Y (s) - α s - β ] + 2b [sY (s) - α ] + cY (s) = F (s).
0 0 0 0 That is, F (s) aαs + (aβ + 2bα ) Y0(s) = 0 + (6) as 2 + 2bs + c as 2 + 2bs + c Y (s) is thus given explicitly as a function of s, and what remains is an 0 inversion problem; that is to say we need to determine a function y(t) whose Laplace Transform is Y (s).
The question of uniqueness which 0 naturally arises at this point is not, in practice, a serious problem.
In brief, if y and y are any two functions which have the same Laplace 1 2 Transform Y (s), then they can differ in value only on a set of points 0 which is (in a sense which can be made precise) a negligibly small set.
In fact, we have the following situation: ∞ if l [y1(t)] = l [y2(t)] then ∫ |y1(t) – y2(t)| dt = 0.
0 With this proviso in mind, we admit the slight abuse of notation involved, and write:  F (s)   aαs + (aβ + 2bα  y( t) ≡ l −1 [Y (s)] = l −1  0  + l −1  (7)  0  as 2 + 2bs + c  153 MT H 381 MODULE 4  as 2 + 2bs + c  154  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III where y is defined for all t > 0.
A more serious problem from the practical point of view is that of implementing the required inversion; that is, of division effective procedures which allow us to recover a function f(t) given its Laplace Transform F (s).
In a large number of commonly occurring cases this 0 can be done by expressing F (s) as a combination of standard functions 0 of s whose inverse transforms are known .
Note that with zero initial conditions, (y(0) = y'(0) = 0), the differential equation (5) can be regarded as representing a linear time-invariant system which transforms a given input signal f into a corresponding output y.
This output function y is the particular integral associated with f and, using the Convolution Theorem, it can be expressed in terms of the appropriate impulse response function characterizing the system: t Y(t) = ∫ 0 f (τ )h1 (t − τ )dτ = l −1[F0 (s)H 0 Where H (s) = ∞ e-st h(t) dt = 1 0 ∫ 0 as 2 + 2bs + c Non-zero initial conditions correspond to the presence of stored energy in the system at time t = 0.
The response of the system to this stored energy is independent of the particular input f and is given by the complementary function.
The complete solution (valid for all t > 0) of the equation (5) can be written in the form.
Y(t) = l −1 [F0 (s)H 0 (s)] + l −1 [aαs + (aβ + 2bα )]H 0 (s)].
(8) In applying the classical Laplace transform technique to (5) we are tacitly assuming that the system which it is being taken to represent is unforced for t < 0; that is, that the response which we compute from (5) is actually the response to the excitation f(t)u(t).
This is sometimes expressed by saying that the input is suddenly applied at time t = 0.
3.2 Laplace Transforms of Generalised Functions If a is any positive number then there is no specialty in extending the definition of the classical, one-sided, Laplace Transform to apply to the case of a delta function located at t = a, or to any of its derivatives located there; for a direct application of the appropriate sampling property gives immediately 155 MT H 381 MODULE 4 ∞ l{δ (t )} = l{δ (t − a)} = ∫ e−st δ (t − a)dt = e −sa (9) a 0 ∞ d  l{δ ' (t − a)} = ∫ e − st δ ' (t − a)dt = − (e − st ) = se −sa (10) 0  dt  t and so on =a Now take the case of a function f defined by a relation of the form f(t) = φ (t)u(a-t) + φ (t)u(t – a) (11) 1 2 where a > 0, and φ and φ are continuously differentiable functions.
1 2 Using the notation f'(t) = φ ' (t)u(a – t) + φ ' (t)u(t – a) (for all t ≠ a) 1 2 and Df(t) = φ ' (t)u(a – t) + φ ' (t)u(a – t) + [ φ (a) - φ (a)] δ (t – a) 1 2 2 1 ≡ f ' (t ) + [ f (a+) − f (a−)]δ (t − a).
(12) Using integration by parts to evaluate the Laplace integral we have ∞ a ∞ ∫ e-stf'(t)dt = ∫ φ' (t)e-stdt + ∫ φ ' (t)e- s tdt 0 0 1 0 2 ∞ ∞     =s e −st φ1 (t ) + ∫ 0a φ 1 (t)e-stdt + e −st φ2 (t) ∫ a∞ φ 2 (t)e-stdt     a a a ∞  st st as = s  φ (t)e − dt + φ (t)e −  [φ (a) − φ (a)] − φ (0) 0 ∫ a 2 dt − e − ∫ 1  2 1 1  ≡ sF (s) − f (0) − e − as [ f (a+) − f (a−)] (13) o so that a modification of the derivative rule is required when we adhere to the classical meaning of the term “derivative” in the case of discontinuous functions.
On the other hand, from (12) we get ∞ ∞ e-st[Df(t)]dt = e-stf'(t)dt + [f(a+) – f(a-)] e -as ∫ ∫ 0 0 = sF (s) – f(0) (14) 0 and the usual form of the derivative rule continues to apply.
156  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III The result (13) makes sense even when we allow a to tend to zero, for then we get 157  MTH 381 MODULE 4 l [f'(t)] = ∫ ∞0 φ 2' (t)e -st dt = s ∫ ∞0 φ 2(t)e -st dt - φ 2(0) = sF (s) – f(0+).
(15) 0 However, a complication arises with regard to l [Df(t)] when a = 0.
If we have then f(t) = φ (t)u(-t) + φ (t)u(t) 1 2 Df(t) = φ ' (t)u(-t)+ [ φ (0) - φ (0)] δ (t) 1 2 1 and so, l [Df(t)] = l [ φ 2' (t)] + [ φ 2(0) - φ 1(0)] l [ δ (t)] = s l [ φ (t)] - φ (0) + [ φ (0) - φ (0)] ∆ (s) 2 2 2 1 ≡ sF0(s) – f(0 +) + [f(0+)– f(0 -)] ∆ (s).
(16) The difficulty is that, as remarked in Sec.
4.5, the Laplace Transform of the delta function (which we have denoted by ∆ (s)) is not defined by the Laplace integral ∫ ∞ e -st δ (t)dt = ∫ + ∞ e -st u(t) δ (t)dt.
0 − ∞ The role of the delta function as a (generalized) impulse response function suggests that we should have ∆ (s) = 1 for all s, and this is the definition most usually adopted.
However the discussion on the significance of the formal product u(t) δ (t) shows that there are grounds 1 for taking ∆ (s) = , for all s; other values for ∆ (s) have also at the 2 issue cannot be resolved simply by an appeal to the definition of δ as a limit, nor by means of the formulation as a (Riemann) Stieltjes integral.
In the latter case, for example, we have for an arbitrary continuous integrand f ∞ f(t)du (t) = (1 – c)f(0) (17) ∫ c 0 We could therefore obtain ∆ (s) ≡ 1 by choosing c = 0 or, equally well, 1 1 ∆ (s) ≡ by choosing c = .
Whatever value we choose for ∆ (s) the 2 2 relation (16) is bond to be consistent with the behaviour of δ as the derivative of the unit step function u. for, since ∞ l [u(t)] = ∫ e-st dt = 1/s, 0 We have 158  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III l [u'(t)] = [s  1  - u(0 + )] + ∆ (s)[u(0+) – u(0-)] s   = (1 – 1) + ∆ (s) (1 – 0) = ∆ (s).
On the other hand care must be taken to ensure that the correct form of (16) is used when a specific definition of ∆ (s) has been decided on.
Thus, for ∆ (s) = 1 we get l [Df(t)] = sF0(s) – f(0 - ) = sF (s) (18) 0 Whenever f(t) = 0 for all t < 0.
1 But for ∆ (s) = the result becomes 2 1 l [Df(t)] = sF0(s) - [f(0+) + f(0 -)].
2 In what follows, we shall adopt the majority view and define ∆ (s) to be 1 for all values of s. Similarly, we shall take the Laplace Transform of δ ' to be s; the analogue of (19) then becomes l [D2f(t)] = s2F0(s) – sf(0-) – f'(0-) (19) = s2F (s) 0 whenever f(t) = 0 for all t < 0.
The convenience of these definitions is readily illustrated by the following derivation of the Laplace Transform of a periodic function: Let f be a function which vanishes identically outside the finite interval (0,T).
The periodic extension of f, of period T, is the function obtained by summing the translates, f(t – kT), for k = 0, ± 1, ± 2,…., (see fig.
49) +∞ fT(t) = ∑ f (t − kT ) (20) k =−∞ 159  MTH 381 MODULE 4 Fig.
49 We can write f as a convolution: T +∞ +∞ fT(t) = ∑[ f (t) ∗ δ (t − kT )] = f (t) ∗ ∑δ (t − kT ).
(21) k =−∞ k =−∞ further, using the above definition of ∆ (s), we obtain  +∞  ∞  l ∑δ (t − kT ) . = l ∑δ (t − kT ).
     k =−∞ k =∞ 1 = 1 + e-sT + e-2sT + e-3sT + … = (22) 1 − e −sT The summation being valid provided that e−α +iω )T |e-sT| = |e-( | e −αT < 1, That is, for all s such that Re(s) > 0.
Hence, appealing to the Conclusion Theorem for the Laplace transform, (21) and (22) together yield  +∞  F (s) l ∑δ (t − kT )  = 0 (23)  −sT k =−∞ .
 1 − e 160  MTH 381 MATHEMATICAL III 3.3 Computation of Laplace Transforms If f is an ordinary function whose Laplace Transform exists (for some values of s) then we should be able to find that transform, in principle at least, by evaluating directly the integral which defines F (s).
It is 0 usually simpler in practice to make use of certain appropriate properties of the Laplace integral and to derive specific transforms from them.
The following results are easy to establish and are particularly useful in this respect: (L.T.I) The first Translation Property.
If l [f(t)] = F0(s), and if a is any real constant, then l [eatf(t)] = F0(s – a).
(L.T.2) The Second Translation Property.
If l [f(t)] = F0(s), and if a is any positive constant, then l [u(t – a)f(t – a)] = e-asF0(s).
(L.T.3) Change of Scale.
If l [f(t)] = F0(s), and if a is any positive constant, then 1  s  l [f(at)] = F   .
a 0  a  (L.T.4) Multiplication t. If l [f(t)] = F0(s), then l [tf(t)] = - d F0 (s) ≡ - F0 ' (s) .
ds (L.T.5) Transform of an Integral.
If l [f(t)] = F0(s), and if the function g is defined by t g(t) = f(τ )dτ ∫ 0 then l [g(t)] = 1 F 0( s).
s The first three of the above properties follow immediately on making suitable changes of variable in the Laplace integrals concerned.
For (L.T.4) we have only to differentiate with respect to s under the integral sign, while in the case of (L.T.5) it is enough to note that g'(t) = f(t) and that g(0) = 0; the result then follows from the rule for finding the 161  MTH 381 MODULE 4 Laplace Transform of a derivative.
Using these properties, an elementary basic table of standard transforms can be constructed without difficulty (Table 1).
This list can be extended by using various special techniques.
In particular, the results for the transforms of delta functions derived in the preceding section are of considerable value in this connection.
