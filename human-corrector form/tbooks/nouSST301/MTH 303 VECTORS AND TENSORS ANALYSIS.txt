At the end of the course you will need to sit for a final or end of course examination of about three hour duration.
This examination will count for 70% of your total course mark.
Tutor-Marked Assignment The TMA is a continuous assessment component of your course.
It accounts for 30% of the total score.
You will be given 4 TMAs to answer.
Three of these must be answered before you are allowed to sit for the end of course examination.
The TMAs would be given to you by your facilitator and returned after you have done the assignment.
Assignment questions for the units in this course are contained in the assignment file.
You will be able to complete your assignment from the information and material contained in your reading, references and study units.
However, it is desirable in all Degree level of education to demonstrate that you have read and researched more into your references, which will give you a wider view point and may provide you with a deeper understanding of the subject.
Make sure that each assignment reaches your facilitator on or before the deadline given in the presentation schedule and assignment file.
If for iiiMTH303 VECTORS AND TENSORS ANALYSIS any reason you cannot complete your work on time, contact your facilitator before the assignment is due to discuss the possibility of an extension.
Extension will not be granted after the due date.
Final Examination and Grading The end of course examination for MTH303 (Vectors and Tensors) will be for about 3 hours and it has a value of 70% of the total course work.
The examination will consist of questions, which will reflect the type of self-testing, practice exercise and tutor-marked assignment problems you have previously encountered.
All areas of the course will be assessed.
Use the time between finishing the last unit and sitting for the examination to revise the whole course.
You might find it useful to review your self-test, TMAs and comments on them before the examination.
The end of course examination covers information from all parts of the course.

In this unit, an attempt will be made to revise some elements of vector algebra.
You should note that a vector quantity is distinguished from a scalar quantity by the fact that a scalar quantity possesses only magnitude, whereas a vector quantity possesses both magnitude and directions.
It is convenient to represent a vector geometrically as an arrow, pointing in the direction associated with the ones having length proportional to the associated magnitude.
These and other properties of vector will be explained in this unit.
You should read this unit carefully before proceeding to other unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to:  describe vectors and scalar quantities  list scalar product of two vectors  state the Law of scalar product  explain vector products  solve problems on vector algebra.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end this unit, you should be able to:  define tensors  perform various operations on tensors  solve correctly any exercise on tensor analysis.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT A point in the N-dimensional space is a set of N numbers denoted by   X1,X2,.......,XN where 1, 2,….,N are taken not s exponents but as superscripts.
The fact that we cannot visualise points in spaces of dimension higher than 3 has of course nothing to do with the existence of such space.
29MTH303 VECTORS AND TENSORS ANALYSIS 3.1 Transformation of Co-coordinates 1 N Let X1,X2,X3,...,Xn and X ,X ,X ,...X be co-ordinates of point in 2 3 two different frames of references.
Suppose there exist independent relations between the co-ordiante of the two systems having the form 1 1  X  X X1,X2,...,X N 2 2  X  X X1,X2,...,X N ----------- (1)  N N  N  X X1,X2,...X N R R    Which can be indicated briefly as X  X X1,X2,...X N _________ n where K = 1, 2, …N.
It is assumed that the functions involved are singled valued, continuous and have continuous derivatives.
The   1 2 N converse to each set of coordinates X ,X ,...,X the will correspond a     2 N unique set X1,X2,...,XN given by X K  Xk X ,X ,X ______-_ (iv) The relation given by equation (ii) and (iii) defines a transformation of co-ordinate from one frame of reference to another frame of reference.
3.2 Cartesian Tensor Definition: When the transformations are from one rectangular co- ordinate system to another the tensors are called Cartesian tensors.
3.3 Summation Convection N Note that ajxj  a x1 a x2 ...a xN but a shorter notation is 1 2 N i1 simply to write as a xj where the convention that whenever the index j (super or subscript) is repeated in a given term we are to sum from the index from 1 to N unless otherwise specified.
This is called the summation convention instead of moving the index j we could us another letter say P and the sum could be written as a X p. Any index p which is repeated in a given term so that the summation convection applied is called a dummy index.
As index occurring only once is called “free index” and can stand for any of the number 1, 2, …,N such as k is equation (ii) and (iii) 30 MTH303 VECTORS AND TENSORS ANALYSIS Examples   1.

This product which involves ordinary multiplication of the component of the tensor is called the outer product e.g.
Apr Bm Cprm is the outer product of Apr and Bm q s qs q s Contraction: If one contravariant and one covariant index of a tensor are set equal, the result indicates that, summation over the equal.
Indices are to be taking according to the summation convection.
This resulting sum is a tensor of rank 2 lesser than the original tensor.
The process is called contraction.
