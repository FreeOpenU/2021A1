In the world today any rural development programme that would be sustainable must include the women and the youth.
So percent of the population in developing countries live in rural areas and a huge percentage of these people are women and youths.
The woman is simply the opposite of an adult man while the youth according to the United Nations are individual between 15 and 24 years old.
Rural Development Programmes are plans of action put in place to improve the quality and quantity of life among the people living in the country.
Nigeria like many other developing nations have an aspiration to be among the 20 most developed nations in the year 2020 and to achieve this hercution task women and youths must be drafted into achieve this great vision.

Rural: Sound in or living in a country Development: The process of becoming larger, stronger, more impressive, more successful or more advanced or causing somebody or something to change in this way.
Concept: The most basic understanding of something.
Programmes: A plan of action for achieving something.
2.0 OBJECTIVES - To dearly understand what rural development involves - To appreciate the importance of concepts and programmes in rural development.
3.0 MAIN CONTENTS As defined earlier it can be simple stated that the concept of rural development programmes are the thoughts behind the plan of action put in place to improve the quality and quantity of life among the people living in country.
The rural areas in Nigeria are inhabited by the bulk of the nation population (80%) they serve as the base for the production of food and fibre.
They are also the major sources of capital formation for the country.
In general terms, the rural areas engage in primary activities that form the basis for any economic development.
Yet despite their importance they are not attractive to live, they lack basic infrastructure which improves the quality of life e.g.
potable water, electricity and food 14feeder roads.
People living in rural areas have low purchasing power and standard of living.
Different concepts by different governments in the history of this country have been applied to develop the rural areas and they include (a) Operation Feed the Nation (OFN) (b) National Accelerated Food Production Programme (NAFPP) (C) Directorate for Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI) The basic concept of these programmes is the belief that infrastructure is provided at the rural level; the quality of life of the inhabitants can be greatly improved.
Respectively the benefits of this programmes to the rural areas has been minimal at best.
3.1 THE CONCEPT OF RURAL INFRASTRUCTURAL PLANNING Infrastructural facilities refer to those basic services without which primary, secondary, and tertiary productive activities cannot function.
In its wider application, infrastructural activities embrace all public services from law and order through to education and public health to transportation, communication and water supply.
In other words, infrastructural facilities are element in the package of basic needs which a community would like to procure for better living.
It is generally accepted that infrastructural facilities can be classified into 3 main categories; Physical Infrastructure: e.g.
roads, water, rural electrification, storage and processing facilities.
Social Infrastructures: e.g.
Health educational facilities, community centre, fire and securities services Institutional Infrastructure: e.g.
Credit and financial Institutions, agricultural research facilities.
Accordingly, rural infrastructural development could imply the desirable of overcoming deprivation and low quality of rural life, it could 15also refers to the provision of bridges, hospitals, schools, electricity and potable water.
Where they are lacking.
Rural development is a positive action in so far as it aims to improve the welfare of the people.
3.2 NIGERIA RURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES OVER THE YEARS 3.2.1 PRE – INDEPENDENCE PERIOD Government’s involvement in infrastructural development been as far back 1917 when the colonial government promulgated the township ordinance.
This ordinance classified settlements in the country into 3 types: First class townships Second class townships Third class townships The first class townships harbored the whites and their workers, these was heavy concentration of infrastructure in these settlements (an example being Lagos).
They differ from the second class and third class townships which receives little or no facilities.
This situation continued until 1952 when the Local Government Councils were established in Western Nigeria.
The Local Government Council were seen as an avenue through which infrastructural facilities could be extended to the rural areas for their development.
But then the fund allocations to the local governments were hardly enough to maintain facilities in the council headquarters.
Infact little or no fund was available to initiate new schemes for rural development.
Yet ironically in spite of the Limited benefits of the colonial policies the investment pattern established during the colonial period was further consolidated by subsequent governments after 16independence.
This is evident in all the development plans militated since 1960.
3.2.2 POST INDEPENDENCE PLAN PERIOD (1960 – DATE) We shall attempt to summarize the post independence plan period under five major eras i.e.
(a) The First National Development Plan Period (1962-68) (b) The Second National Development Plan Period (1970-74) (c) The Third National Development Plan Period (1975-80) (d) The Fourth National Development Plan Period (1981-85) (e) The Post Forth Plan Period (1985-90) 3.2.2.1 THE FIRST NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1962-1968) The First National Development Plan had a total budget allocation of #1.353 million.
The plan made no clear statement in rural infrastructural development.
As agriculture was still an important exchange earner, the plans objectives were to encourage the assembly of agricultural product for export purpose.
3.2.2.2 THE SECOND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1970-1974) The Second National Development Plan was launched shortly after the end of the civil war.
The plan attempted to rehabilitate economic activities in war ravaged areas.
The plan spelt out5 principal national objectives to develop a united, just, strong and self – reliant nation.
Some #2,050.738 million was allocated as expenditure.
But as in the first plan, government did not make a clear statement on rural infrastructural development.
However it was stated in the plan that government was committed to spending #500.000 for village regrouping.
This was perhaps to reduce the costs of 17providing economic and social infrastructure like health, electricity, water and educational facilities for the rural areas.
The sum allocated was too small that was allocated to rural development, and generally like the precious ones, the plan failed to introduce any radical package towards rural development.
3.3.2.3 THE THIRD NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1975-1980) Serious concern for rural development at the national level was first highlighted in the Third National Development Plan.
The plan emphasized the need to reduce reward disparities in order to foster national unity.
Through the adoption of integrated rural development.
The total budget allocation in the Third National Development Plan was #32 billion, the plan provided for: (a) The allocation of #90 million toward national wide rural electrification scheme.
(b) The development of more River Basin Development Authorities (RBDA’s) in addition to the existing ones (Sokoto and Rima) (RBDA’s) (c) The construction of small dams and boreholes for rural water supply and the clearing of feeder roads for the evacuation of agricultural produce.
(d) The supply of electricity to rural areas.
At the state levels, some government like Oyo state showed their intention to transform the rural area through the provision of basic infrastructural facilities.
The Oyo State government spent #15.98 million for the rural electrification of some rural settlements.
In addition, the state government planned for the construction of 150 rural health centre and 725 health clinics all over the state.
The health facilities were to be provided at a cost of #31.719 million.
183.3.2.4 THE FOURTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1981-1985) The Fourth National Development Plan exhibits several distinguishing features.
First, it was formulated by a civilian government under a new constitution based on the presidential system of government.
Secondly it was the first plan in which the local government tier was allowed to participate fully in its own right.
The plan emphasized among other things the need for balanced development of the various sectors of the economy and the various geographic areas of the country.
It emphasized the importance of rural infrastructural development as a vehicle for enhancing the quality of rural life.
Consequently, about #924 million was allocated to the eleven River Basin Development Authorities whose functions include among other things the constructions of boreholes dams, feeder roads and jetties.
About 12,064km of feeder roads, 2,650 boreholes, 2,250 wells, 29 farm centres and 249 earth dams were expected to be constructed by the River Basin Development Authorities (RBDA’s).
The Federal Government allocated #645 million for a country wide electrification in addition all the states of the federation allocated #700.
4million for the electrification of about 1,600 towns and villages.
In terms of rural transportation development, the local government in the country planned for the provision of inter city / village bus services, for the construction of motor parks and for petrol filling stations during the forth plan period.
In order to increase access of rural dwellers to safe drinking water, rural water supply schemes were planned apart from the huge boreholes drinking programmes.
The total allocation to this sector was #2,805 million.
Local governments in some states like Anambra, Borno, Plateau, Cross river and Bendel States also made fund allocations totaling #311,824 million for water projects.
19At the state level, the various state governments spelt out different policy issues in the forth development plan.
For instance in Oyo state the government identified four cardinal programmes for itself.
These are: (a) Free education at all levels (b) Free medical services (c) Integrated rural development (d) Gainful employment In line with the above programmes, the sum of N1, 642,401million was allocated to the various sectors of the economy.
The rural sector renewed much needed attention in the attempt to (a) Upgrade some local government roads.
(b) Establish 27 primary health care centres, 105 health clinics and 6 comprehensive health centres.
All these were to be located in rural areas (c) Provide wells in rural areas where piped water was unavailable (d) Extend rural electrification scheme to phase 5 in addition to the existing phases, one to four which were still under construction.
3.2.2.5 THE POST FOURTH PLAN PERIOD (1985 TO DATE) The post fourth plan period witnessed the establishment of the Directorates for food, roads and rural infrastructure in 1985 for the sole purpose for providing rural infrastructure in the country side.
The laws establishing the directorate was promulgated under decree 4 of 1987.
The core of the directorates programme is the promotion of productive activities, besides, the directorates recognized the provision of rural infrastructure such as feeder roads, water, electricity and housing as essential for the enhancement of the quality of life in rural areas.
The programme of the directorate includes; 20(a) The organization and mobilization of the local people to enhance or facilitate closer interaction between government and the people.
In addition the local communities were asked to form unions or association for the purpose of providing common facilities for themselves.
(b) The provision of rural infrastructures such as rural feeder roads, rural water and sanitation, rural housing and electrification (c) The promotion of productive activities such as food and agricultural, rural industrialization and technologies (d) The promotion of other extra – curriculum activities such as Socio – cultural and recreational programmes, intra and inter community cohesion activities.
The plan for the implementation of DFRRI programmes was organized into two phases.
In phase one, the target was to provide water for 250 communities in each of the states of the federation, to construct 90, 000km of feeder roads to promote rural housing health and agriculture and also to improve the attractiveness of the rural environment.
DFRRI did not get involved in direct implementation of its programmes rather it uses its main agents, the states and local government to execute it’s programme.
The funds for its programmes are made available to the states which then disburses it to the local government which are over seen by the rural development committees.
SELF ACCESSED EXERCISE Write a short note in the Third National Development Plan.
4.0 CONCLUSION As we have earlier stated there was little effort geared towards rural development during the pre – independence period.
21In the first and second National Development Plan periods save for N500, 000 committee to village regrouping in the second plan, rural development was still very low on government priority.
In the third and fourth national development plans, some gains were made but implementation and lack of political will hindered its success.
The most gain was seen in the post fourth National Plan but even that the benefits accrued to the rural areas could and should have been more than what was realized.
And that for the home benefits of rural development to be realized, the individual and special needs of the communities must be addressed and not a one size fits all approach.
5.0 SUMMARY (a) We have a definition for rural, concept, development and programmes which enabled us to have a clearer understanding of what the concept of rural development programmes were (b) We also tried to see the characteristics of rural areas and need for them to be developed.
(c) We also tried to explain the concept of rural infrastructure planning and the classification of infrastructural facilities.
(d) We looked in-depth and the various government attempts and moral development primarily through the provision of infrastructure.

In the Nigerian economy, it is usual to equate the rural areas with the agricultural occupations like, crafts, trading etc.
For Nigeria to take her place among the world’s elite economies the rural areas must be developed and the quality of life of rural dwellers greatly improved for about 80% of Nigerians reside in rural areas.
2.0 OBJECTIVES - To be able to understand what makes an area rural.
- To be able to appreciate the benefits of properly implemented rural development programme.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 RURAL AREAS The word rural has many dimensions including economic, sociological psychological, ethic racial and geographical implication.
It is generally accepted that rural areas are characterized by engagement in primary activities that form the basis for any economic activity.
E.g.
farming, yet despite their importance they are not attractive to give in because they lack the basic infrastructure which improves the quality of life e.g.
portable water, electricity, good feeder road, poor health facilities, poor quality schools etc.
another characteristics of rural areas is 25the fact that the inhabitants have low purchasing power and a low standard of living.
3.2 BENEFIT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME 3.2.1 IMPROVED AND BENEFIT FOOD PRODUCTION Since most rural areas are engaged in primary activities like farming and that 80% of Nigerians live in rural areas, produce 80% of the food consumes by the population and derive less that 30% of government benefits.
New improved farming techniques can be introduced and important preservation methods can be made available to the farmer.
For example most farmer produce a lot of grains during the farming season but due to poor storages techniques they are compelled to sell their farm produce quickly at a time when there is glut in the with improved storage methods, these farmers can now preserve their goods and then sell when they can obtain maximum financial gain from their hard work.
In Nigeria most farmers especially in rural areas practice substances farming which basically is farming to meet your needs, an introduction of mechanical farming techniques and machinery is the tractor, combined harvester, fertilizer, can greatly improve the output of these farmers in rural areas when aided Agricultural development programme, and government policies.
The introduction of farmers to new and improved varieties of plants which offer great advantage over the old plants in terms of output and disease resistance.
Food production efficiency can be greatly increased by food processing can help convert an easily perishable food materials to a more stable longer casting form.
263.2.2 IMPROVED HEALTH CARE A direct gain of rural development is an improved health care delivery system backed up by increase public enlightenment campaign.
A good number of deaths that occurred at rural areas are highly preventable e.g.
the loss of babies to the seven killer childhood diseases e.g.
polio, measles etc are thoroughly preventable and since the extensive intensive and agreement immunization programme polio has almost been eradicated in this country except for some small pockets of infection infirmity in Northern Nigeria.
Maternal mortality is also another source of worry since most pregnant mothers lack access to pre and ante-natal health care.
In this country malaria is a major killer and it is an entirely preventable cause of death.
The barrier method of which the mosquito net is a prime example that can reduce the frequency of their disease couples with availability of prophylactic drugs like daraprimR and curative drugs like chloroquine, artesunate.
Improved public enlightenment will also help educate the populace on the dangers of allowing standing water which could serve as breeding ground for the mosquito larvae.
It is a generally accepted wisdom that preventions is better than cure likewise the setting up of adequate sanitary and hygiene conditions will bring about a decrease in out breaks of diseases.
E.g.
simple practices like boiling of water before drinking and filtering pf water can bring a great reduction in the disease outbreak and prevent deaths since the population of a country is also an asset.
To the government, a major benefit is the reduction in the days lost by workers due to preventable diseases.
273.2.3 POTABLE WATE SUPPLY The need of water to life cannot be overemphasized infact there is a popular saying which goes that “water is life” also in reference to Egypt another saying goes that “No Nile no Egypt” stating the importance of the River Nile to the growth and development of Egypt as a civilization.
Infact some of Nigeria’s most economically vibrant locations are located close to water bodies e.g.
Lagos and Port Harcourt.
In the rural areas of Nigeria, most communities depend on streams and rivers for their water needs which also present its own problems for example the seasonality of rainfall in most parts of the country causes the rivers and streams to experience fluctuations in their water volume and hence some of the streams and rivers upon which these communities depend on may actually dry up during the dry season, causing the rural dwellers to move extremely long distances to obtain drinking water.
Since whole communities often depend on these rivers and streams they inadvertently pollute these water with deadly consequences, for it is in these streams and rivers they take their bath, washcloths, defecate and also drink so with time, these water bodies become unsafe for drinking and contribute to the host of water borne diseases are usually evident in such communities.
The provision of pipe born or clean sources of water like boreholes help to reduce the incidence these disease, improve efficiency as time spent looking for water can be better channeled into more profitable enterprises and in some cases since this supply of water can offset the seasonality of rainfall, then the possibility of all year farming activities can occur with the help of irrigation.
283.2.4 PRESERVATION OF CULTURE HERITAGE AND HISTORY The development of a rural area will increase the dwellers’ contact with outsiders and also serve to inform the outside world of the abundant resources available there, both cultural, materially and physically.
For example in most rural areas the preservation of heritage, tradition and culture is mostly oral, while it may be acceptable is not a perfect and efficient system.
The documentation and preservation of their custom, tradition and history ensures its survival also the translation of their language into the written word would increase knowledge in the arts and contribute to the enrichment of diverse cultural heritage of the country and also help to produce materials that are better suited to the needs of the community.
The development of rural areas also helps to bring to the public the abundant natural resources in an area which will also help to hasten development e.g.
the Shere hills in Plateau State, the Zuma Rock in Niger State have all become tourist attractions in the country thereby indirectly improving the lives of the dwellers of that community.
3.2.7 IMPROVED COMUNICATION The provision of adequate communication means to rural dwellers would greatly improve the quality of life of rural dweller.
The Federal government has been trying to provide telephones at the rural level to increase their communications with outside world and to try to increase the attractiveness of rural areas to workers.
Also the establishment of post offices would also aid the communication between rural areas and urban areas.
The provision of radio stations which reach into the rural areas would greatly increase the rapid an effective dissemination of news to 29rural areas and also help foster the feeling of unity as rural dweller will feel carried along in the activities of the government.
3.2.8 IMPROVED SECURITY As development of rural areas occurs there usually will be a need for increase in security of life and property for example.
The Niger Delta region in Nigeria is currently not very safe for people engaging in business there and as such it discourages development as people who would want to do business there will have a higher cost of production which may not be economically feasible.
Also since these to rural areas usually have a system of dispute settlement which are usually governed by their laws and customs and for example school teachers who as brought to such rural areas to educate their children may have some conflicts in the rural areas must be able to find a system that guarantee their security and creates a system whereby justice and equity can be obtained by all parties.
SELF ASSESSEDEXERCISE (SAE) What are the benefits to a farmer of having good roads?
4.0 CONCLUSION The importance and benefits of rural development programmes to both government and to the rural dwellers cannot be emphasized for the government.
It helps to reduce cost e.g.
Health costs in the long run by running a prevention better than cure policy and by helping to keep hale and healthy its work force and population.
For the rural dweller it increases financial purchasing power, his quality of life opens him up to opportunities beyond his borders, give him an opportunity to influence the future of his children and family by 30education.
It also helps to improve social integration as the rural area is gradually de-isolated.
5.0 SUMMARY - We had an understanding of the characteristics of a rural area - We showed that the benefits of rural development are two fold both the government and rural dweller benefits.
- We highlighted the importance of rural areas to national development - We also explained the benefits and importance of rural development programmes.
6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT (a) List four characteristics of a rural area.

Poverty in Nigeria is prevalent among the rural dweller and a manifestation of compel factors among which are high population growth, environmental degradation, high unemployment rate, drought, low literacy, limited access to resources, limited access to health, education etc.
all the aforementioned factors are hindrances or challenges to the efficient implementation of rural development programmes.
2.0 OBJECTIVES 1 To understand while poverty is prevalent in Nigeria especially its rural areas.
2.
To understand the problem that hinders the effective implementation of rural development programmes.
3.
To examine how these problems can be overcome 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 CAUSES OF POVERTY IN NIGERIA As earlier stated, the causes of poverty are multifactorial and it is as a result of a combination of reasons among which are.
3.1.1 OIL The discovery of oil in commercial qualities and the resultant oil boom that ensued played a major part in the present poverty levels in this country, far before oil, agriculture was the mainstay of the country.
34Agriculture which employs about 80% of the Nigerian population received its pride of place prior to oil discovery.
Oil brought about a quicker, cheaper and more lieature way to generate funds for the country and gradually took a stronghold on all other sources of revenue to the country causing their eventual neglect.
As a result, government funding to agriculture which was the mainstay of the Nigerian populace has dropped over the years.
3.1.2 CENTRALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT Nigeria currently runs a presidential system of government which vests too much power to the centre hence too much decisions are made centrally hat have with or no impact at the rural level.
A decentralization of government would increase the funding that reaches the grassroots and thereby increase the chances of eradicating rural poverty as matters that affect the rural government can be made quickly and implemented at that level.
3.1.3 HIGH POPULATION GROWTH Nigeria is a very populous country of about 140million Nigerian and as such, it is very difficult to make adequate plans for its citizens, and it is unfortunate that the poorest people are the ones with the highest growth index thereby compounding the problem as they are not educated on the benefits of family planning and birth control methods.
3.1.4 DROUGHT As earlier stated a good number of Nigerians are engaged in agriculture which is dependent on rainfall and seasonal in nature.
In some parts of the country especially the north drought is regularly experienced causing untold hardship to the mass of rural dweller in such areas.
3.1.5 CORRUPTION Corruption in Nigeria is currently of epidemic proportions and a great reason for the poverty of Nigeria is due to corruption and it 35pervaded all levels of government and the society breeding inefficiently and wastage.
Monies meant for the development programmes to boost the quality of life of the rural dweller and Nigerians as a whole have constantly and consistently been embezzled and misappropriated with few of the culprits brought to justice.
3.1.6 ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION Environmental degradation holds true particularly among the oil producing people of the Niger- Delta of Nigeria.
Decades of oil drilling in their land has led to regular oil spills on their lands and on their water which has hindered such lands infarmable and such water so polluted that almost all forms of life are destroyed taking away fishing which is a source of livelihood for most people in such areas.
3.2 CHALLENGES TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES 3.2.1 FUNDING Funding of rural development programmes and associated sectors that will bring about an improvement of rural dwellers and Nigerians as a whole is usually inadequate, and this usually not unconnected to corruption as monies are misappropriated or out rightly embezzled.
This problem can be adequately controlled by close supervision of work done by regulating bodies e.g.
senate committee that have oversight functions and the prompt persecution of anyone found to have misappropriated and embezzled money meant for these rural development programmes.
3.2.2 INADEQUACY OF SKILLED WORKERS Local government councils are vehicles for development to rural areas and they are usually starved of skilled technical and professional staff like qualified engineers (of all types), medical doctors, accountants, statisticians, economists, lawyers, town planners just to mention a few.
The reasons for these are not far fetched they include: 36(a) Low image and attractiveness of local government and rural areas in the minds of professionals who feel and think that there is no job satisfaction to keep them at that low level of public service.
(b) Hopeless nature of the job attributable to and arising from, low or no incentive for junior workers no chance for creativity and innovation as well as a perpetual delay in payment of salary.
(c) Manner of recruitment is questionable as they are usually based on subjectively and consideration of sentiment.
Employment is usually based on favoritism, nepotism, ethnic and political consideration and other primordial factors that replaced and displaces competence qualification, experience and performance.
(d) Low job security: The fear and threat of retrenchment of staff has affected their efficiency and output.
This is fashionable in Ondo and Ekiti State where a series of staff audit were carried out for the purpose of downsizing to reduce wage bill as a result of the demand for and payment of fifteen percent increase in salary.
These problems listed can be overcome by providing job securities and providing incentives to skilled workers to work in rural areas for example some state governments are proposing a higher salary for workers in rural areas when compare to those working in urban area.
Also appointments should be based on meritocracy to ensure qualified and competent workers are employed.
3.2.3 GENERAL INDSCIPLINE Indiscipline is rampantly perceived and ell pronounced among most workers for examples senior officers who should be beacons of examples travel home to their families on Friday and return late on Monday or on Tuesday; Junior officers learn rapidly and begin to play truancy with their jobs and some begin to use office space and time for personal businesses.
The rules that guide moral, ethical and professional conduct have at 37worse become cobwebs that are to weak to stem this slide into indiscipline.
This Laissez – faire attitude to work has arrested the efficiency of government parastatal agencies and programmes.
This problem can be corrected by street obedience to the code of conduct and the prosecution of staff who go contrary to what is obtainable and the requirement that senior officials uphold a higher standard of moral and professional ethnics.
3.2.4 UNDUE INTERFERENCE The degree of external influence and instruction into the affairs and execution of these rural development programmes is worrisome and needs re evaluation for example state governors can grapple the activities of the local government by unconstitutionally dissolving the entire councils elected officials.
Most local government and programmes lack financial autonomy and hence are susceptible to influence by the body that release the funds to them, thereby leading to a corruption of the aims and objectives of such a body.
The local government which is the closest arm of government to the rural dwellers is particularly susceptible to this.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested and prosecuted the Former Enugu State Government on the allegation of diverting local government funds in the state.
This undue interference has incapacitated local governments from effectively functioning on one hand and alienated grassroots people from enjoying the benefits of government.
This problem can be eradicated by properly separating the local government from the state government and the granting of autonomy to government agencies that require it to perform their duty with little or noninterference.
383.2.5 MISLEAD PRIORITIES AND NON – INVOLVEMENT OR INCLUSION OF THE NEEDS OF THE RURAL DWELLERS Hard earned and limited resources accrued to and raised by government toward the upgrading of the quality of life of rural dwellers are generally mismanaged, priorities are general misplaced, projects are not done according to or as demanded by the people, but regrettably in tune with the selfish ends and aggrandizement of political leaders in collaboration with senior bureaucrats in government.
The government normally uses a one size fits all approach to the development of rural develop programmes forgetting that different people have different requirements and needs.
For the past decades, more euphemistic phrases have since been employed to justify participation of people at the grassroots level.
They include “Development from Below”; “Bottom up approach to development”; “popular participation”, Bringing Government closer to the people” and other catch phrases to argue for people involvement in the affairs that directly affect them.
From all indications, observations have shown them to be more smoke than fire.
An example is the local government which usually prepares estimate for its revenue and expenditure without due recourse to and due consultation with the people for whom the exercise is being carried out for to know their needs, their problems and their potentials.
A number of factors are responsible for non – involvement of people in their own affairs.
These include; (a) Loss of interest in projects that will not benefit the people in authority (b) The age long belief by the officials that people are Ignorant, Illiterate and Unenlightened (c) Lack of political will by the leadership to run and open administration due again to self interest 39(d) Poverty of Socio – political philosophy for change.
The cure for this problem will have to be that people for which a programme is designed to benefit one to be involved in the planning, execution and maintenance of the programme.
Also they and they alone should determine their wants and needs.
3.2.5 CORRUPTION Some have jokingly said that “Nigeria has no natural disaster, the onlynatural problem we have is corruption”.
The effect of corruption in all spheres of life in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized, some have speculated as much as 40-50% of the annual budget is lost to corruption.
Monies meant for specific goals are rapidly diverted, embezzled and misappropriated, government officials require some gratification to releases funds for execution of projects even the beneficiaries would have to get some of the funds for their own selfish interests.
This problem can only be eradicated by government adherence to the process, proper accountability and quick arrest and prosecution of anybody corrupting the system, there should be prompt supervisory and oversight activity by respective bodies.
3.2.7 POOR PUBLIC – PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP The government’s involvement of the private sector through the public private partnership agreements is poor.
Private businesses play a part in rural development if they are mandated or encouraged with incentives.
For example privates business can be encourage to locate their inclusive and factories in certain rural areas to kick start development in such areas by offering certain incentives for instance, free land, tax wavers e.t.c.
Business could also be encourage to provide basic amenities to communities from which they derived some benefits or they could be mandated to make a certain financial contribution to the execution of project.
40Government could also create a situation whereby all parties to benefits in a project make sure contribution thereby seeing some of the government’s resources provide money, equipments and facilities while the host community provide land and labour to ensure all parties have a stake to ensure its success.
This deficiency can be proved by the movement of both the private sector as well as the host community to ensure success by making all parties involved stakeholders in the project.
3.2.7 GLOBALIZATION Globalization has lead to the World be perceived a global village allowing for the ease of transaction of business and communication between nations and individuals.
In most instances it’s a blessing it also has its braw backer.
It benefits are such that it makes it possible for a producer to reach a wider larger market it even allows him to manufacture his goods in a country with a low cost of production and then export them to a country for sale where he can obtain the highest profit.
Its drawback using the Nigerian example can be made through the textile industry whereby cheap clothing imported from china and other countries have run the textile industry aground because these imported materials are cheaper than the locally produced fabrics.
Membership of the world trade organization also sets standard for trade between members which may be detrimental especially if you are a consumer nation like Nigeria by the importation of cheap foreign product which can stifle or kill the local industry.
To combat this problem government has to thoroughly think out the consequences of joining certain organizations before becoming members as well as taking measures to protect local industries and local content.
413.2.9 POOR ACCESS/AVAILABILTY OF MICRO FINANCE Rural dwellers have very limited access to micro finance that can serve as a stimulus to improve the quality of their life.
This is due to the fact that the poor in Nigeria have a low income which progresses to a low investment and therefore they possess little or no collateral.
Therefore access to some credit supply sources is impossible.
The sources of loans and microfinance for the poor are as follows: Commercial banks Microfinance institutions (MFI) Cooperatives Government projects Non Governmental Organizations (NGO’s) involved in the delivery of financial services Informal institutions (e.g.
family, friends, money lenders) Most financial institutions are not favorable disposed to giving loans to the poor in rural areas primarily for reasons.
• These types of loans are noted for their high default rate since the benefactor usually views such loans as gifts from government and because they offer little or no collateral.
• These forms of loans are usually a long term project unnecessarily tying down their funds.
• Most financial institutions would rather invest the money for loans in other ventures that are more profitable when compared with financing rural dwellers without the resultant high risk of default.
This problem of microfinance credit can be resolved by government giving incentives for financial institutions to give loans to rural dwellers at little or no interest rate.
And when government agencies 42give out loans there should be active supervision at loan recovery and also and also loans should be given in form of a revolving sort of loan so that the money recovered from the beneficiaries will be used to administer new loans to new beneficiaries thereby encouraging beneficiaries from defaulting on their loan payments.
SELF ASSESSED EXERCICE (a) Explain the role played by inadequacy of skilled workers as a challenge to rural development 4.0 CONCLUSION The challenges to rural development are widely varied and differ from location to location.
Generally a lack of political will, corruption and exclusion of the intended beneficiaries are problems that cut across all regions.
To ensure an efficient and effective rural development programme the beneficiaries must be involved in every step of the way, adequate supervision must occur and the program must be interactive so that it is amenable to change if the need arises.
5.0 SUMMARY - we looked at the causes of poverty - we then discussed the problems involved in the effective delivery of rural development programmes - we also discussed how these problems can be overcome 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT (a) List the sources of credit available to a poor rural dweller (b)Explain environmental degradation as a source of poverty (c)write on globalization as a challenge to the effective success of rural development programmes.

Their method of food production were usually well adopted to the local environment involving minimum risk and ensuring enough food for the family excepts in exceptional years.
But in the last 50years the relative equilibrium of traditional societies has been greatly disturbed.
This is primarily due to an increase in population that places a higher demand for agricultural products.
The only solution to this problem is a more intensive and productive use of land to achieve this the millions of farmers must be given access to Agricultural education, the necessary production supplies and markets.
Provision of advice and assistance to farmers to help them improve their method of production and marketing is called “Agricultural Extension”.
1.0 OBJECTIVES - To understand what is the meaning of Agricultural Extension is - To understand the importance of Agricultural Extension to rural development programmes 3.0 MAIN BODY 3.1 EARLY EXTENSION PROGRAMMES The term extension was first word in connection with education about 100 years ago to describe the method of spreading knowledge from the University of Cambridge in England to the great mass of people outsides it walls and the earliest exponent of this system was Richard Moulton, a lecturer in Literature.
46He and his companion handled from town to town teaching adults who because of their employment in factories and offices were unable to receive formal university education.
Although the early extension programmes was not concerned with agriculture.
It featured the 4 elements common to modern agricultural extension programmes.
which are; (a) The knowledge to be extended (b) The people to be served (c) A central extension organization (d) The extension agent or contract man The term Agricultural Extension has come from the U.S.A Until 1914, lectures by Universities lecturers to the general public were called extension lecturers, but by the passing of the Smith-lever act in that year, the term came to mean mainly non formal education for the farming community.
The use of the net was to aid the spread of useful and practical information to the farmers and their families on subjects relating to Agriculture and Home economics States universities and colleges, called Land Grant Colleges were established for research farming and evaluation.
Agricultural extension got going in the British colonies in the late 1920s.
At this time 4 was realized that farmers were spending a lot of time meeting their subsistence needs, if they could improve their efficiency more labour and land could be released for the production of surpluses for the market.
Increases attention was given to the needs of the farmers.
The emphasis moved away from crops to the people growing them.
3.2 THE EXTENSION WORKER An extension worker help farmers increase the productivities of their farm and improve on their living standards.
He has many roles; he is an adviser, a technician and a middle man operating between agricultural research institution and farm families.
He is a change agent helping farmers to identified their problems and find their own solution.
He works for the creation of community 47harmony essential for group projects.
He is a manager, planning and organizing his work and that of all his assistants.
All these roles cannot be filled simultaneously by one person.
He all alone cannot be a patient listener on the village wave length and sufficiently experienced and well trained to know the technical answer, and to brain and manage junior staffs.
In most extension organizations staff are organized into a 3 ties system.
1.
Numerous junior staff at the village or area level 2.
Diploma staff in support at the district level 3.
Senior managerial and subject matter specialists at the regional head quarters Junior technician Demonstrators and supervisors (promoted demonstrators) with a 2 year certificate in Agriculture, who work at the area level.
Demonstrators are primarily the field assistants and the majority work as extension agents Senior technician Diplomats in Agriculture who work as District Agricultural Officers (DAO) or in specialist section Professional Graduates who work as Regional Agricultural Officers (RAO) or as specialists (some post held by experienced diplomats) Table 1: STAFF LEVELS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL FIELD SERVICE, BOTSWANA (Source: Kingshotte A., Agricultural Administration Network, 001) 3.3: ROLE OF EXTENSION WORKER AT DIFFERENT LEVEL Area or village level Extension agent or contact man between extension agency and farmers, advisers and change agent District level Supervision and training of extension agents, testing research findings in pilot trials and building them into extension programmes, ensuring that inputs are available for extension agents (e.g.
for demonstration).
Coordination of work with order agencies to ensure the organized delivery of farm inputs and outputs.
Regional level Supervision of district level, organization of 48programme preparation and control of implementation, coordination of programme with that of other agencies, advising district staff on national objectives, provision of special services e.g.
soil conservation equipment Cartography, agricultural information (Bulletin, posters, radio information) 3.4.
EXTENSION PROBLEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES At independence many of the developing countries inherited an administration aimed primarily at increasing export production, gathering statistics and maintenance of law and order.
The goals of new nations related more to community development.
There was a tendency to modify the organization of extension programmes to serve the diverse needs of the communities.
These led to conflicts between departments, poorly coordinated efforts and disappointing results.
3.4.1 THE POPULATION PROBLEM Increases in population may soon swamp any improvement in services in economically advanced countries, the ratio of extension worker to farmers’ lies between 1:350 to 1:1000 where as foremost developing nations they will be considered lucky of they have an extension worker to farmer ratio of 1:5000.
A Latin American Extension worker once complained that despite the 30,000 teachers in his country, still a large number of children were unable to read, what could he hope to achieve in the way of agricultural progress with a staff strength of 30.
3.4.2 INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT A high ratio of extension workers to families is how ever of little practical value of the extension message is appropriate.
Farm improvements well adapted to surplus labour, unsophisticated skills and care capital.
Set backs have been caused by inappropriate technology and institutions borrowed from economically advanced countries a lot of money has been 49wasted on the promontory techniques which are of little use and help to the farmer.
3.4.3 LACK OF PRACTICAL SKILL Extension worker are often lacking in practical ability as a result of poor training and selection.
Frequently their demonstration plots show how much they have to learn from the farmers they are tot each.
A major criticism of U.S. Extension workers was that they were preoccupied with exclusion methods rather than farm technology, for example, experts in audio-visual aids were skilled in design and presentation but lacked the practical training in agriculture necessary to test and demonstrate agricultural improvements.
3.4.4.
LACKOF SUPPORTING SERVICE In developing countries 50 – 80% of households are dependent on Agricultural employment; the great majorities are poor and illiterate.
Private commercial suppliers of seeds agricultural chemicals, tools and spare parts are often absent.
Too often farmers have the frustrating experience of getting less money than their marketed produce than they are rightly expected.
Cost of transportation are high and markets for tropical agriculture produce are highly competitive and unstable.
Profit are mainly surorate by money lenders, merchants and landlords or the markets may be dominated by large foreign owned plantation companies.
Peasant organizations are frequently suppressed.
In such cases little can be achieved by the home extension worker.
3.4.5 THE MANAGEMENT PROBLEM In most developing countries extension services also organized along similar lines to civil service agencies, with offices at the national, provincial (state), district and rural council levels.
Complex organization such as these have problems of communication between the upper and lower levels.
All information and reports have to be transmitted through each link in the chain.
50Complex chains of command cause delays and distortion of the extension message.
Programmes are usually planned and decisions taken by senior staff who tend to be out of touch with local problems and the day to day difficulties forcing the farmer and the extension worker.
The extension worker is the most important link in the chain is often the list supported with transport, equipment and technical guidance.
Supervision is usually inadequate.
Too often salaries and staff accommodation absorb most of the extension budget.
The work load of an extension agent may be very heavy and include the following tasks: (a) Working application for credit and subsidiaries for farmers (b) Filling in many questionnaires and forms for head quarters (c) Setting up and maintaining demonstration plots and disturbing supplies The extension agent may be the only government officer operating at the local level and may thus be given various non-agricultural tasks, very little time is available for working with farmers or for in service training.
The little agricultural work that is done is rarely systematical planned or supervised.
Extension agent hardly ever have a plan of work, and when they do the plan is often too Raquel to be checked and may have little relevance to the needs of the farmer.
Senior staffs have neither had the means nor the resources to check on performance.
Extension worker generally spend too much time in their offices and not enough time in the fields.
Their attempts to implement inappropriate extension programmes meet wilt apart and some time hostility from the farmers.
The reluctance of extension workers to identify with farmers and share their anxieties is often the result of values acquired in school.
The educational system is often geared to developing skills for employment in office jobs in the 51capital.
In fact education provides a means of escaping from rural areas.
Promotion within the civil service is often best obtained by through an office job under the eye of the director than by hard work in remote rural areas.
3.5 COMMON EXTENSION PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS Problems Solution Extension make little headway due to Coordinate extension with other lack of supporting services services organize package programmes, contract farming and or district team approach.
Multitude of farmers to be reached by Drainage to work with groups a handful of extension staffs organized around local contact farmers Excursion message ill – adapted to Field surveys, applied research to management objectives of small devise and test appropriate technology.

Extension workers are inadequate Improve selection and harnessing staff, trained in staff training, principles of non- formal education, more practical work etc.
Weak management, complex Introduce single, direct line of support organization structures, lack of supply and control simple management for the front line staff, ill-deformed procedures and positive and negative work programme, no incentive to sanctions for extension staff, improve etc.
programme planning.
3.6 SELF MARKED ASSESSMENT List the four (4) elements common to modern agricultural extension programme 2.0 CONCLUSION The importance of extension to the success of rural development programme can not be over estimated for extension is the bridge behavior solutions ate the research institutes and the universities and the problems at the farmer’s and extension also helps inform researchers on what the needs of the farmer are.

Rural Development Programmes have their flaws but as we progress into the future these flaws have to be removed and the model future to satisfy, local, national and international needs.
2.0 OBJECTIVES - To understand the future requirements of Rural Development - To understand how to achieve such requirements 3.0 MAIN BODY 3.1 GLOBALIZATION ON THE RURALDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME Globalization can be defined as the many economically, politically, technological and social progress, innovation ad changes that are making the world more connected.
The level of interdependence means that decisions that are made in a remote part of the world can have huge consequences and repercussions in another end of the world.
As stated previously, that the textile industry in Nigeria was crippled by the availability of cheap foreign imported that cost less than the locally produced textile and gradually led to the closure of the industry.
Like wise the government must also tailor its policies to protect specific local sectors like agriculture and to strive to ensure that not only do we produce but we have in excess to supply needs that occur in other countries.
563.3 IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE Farmers are never short of stories of the foolishness of extension workers.
In Fiji, there is a story about an enthusiastic extension agricultural officer who receive directive from his head quarters to organize a coflet Planting Campaign in his district.
He went to a village where the people were friendly and helpful and he gave them a lecture about coflect.
They patiently listened and agreed to clear the hills of bush and prepare the land for planting.
When they have finished the task, they sent word to the extension worker to bring planting material.
But when the villagers saw what he had brought, there was a shocked silence, follow by uncontrolled laughter.
If this is coflect they said, that is what we have been clearing from the hills these last few weeks.
Clearly all extension programmes should be proceeded by a field survey to identify the problems analyze the cause and devise acceptable solutions.
The outcome should be a well conceived agricultural development plan for the area that will provide extension workers with a clear programme to follow.
The type of amount of survey work required will depend on (a) The complexity and size of the area (b) How much is already know about it (c) The extent to which the similar areas have already be studied (d) The size of the proposal investment The design of the rural development programme must usually originate from the need of the individual or community, for many well meaning programmes have failed due to its uselessness or its impracticability.
3.3 CONSISTENT GOVERNMENT POLICY AND POLITICAL WILL A major hindrance to rural development in the past has been a lack of political will and inconsistent policies.
Almost every new administration decides to establish its own rural development programmes and abandoning that of its predecessors thereby eroding whatever gains may have gotten.
Also most 57government actually pay only lips service to rural development and commitment is lacking.
3.4 DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS For there should be effective transformation of the quality of life of rural dweller and to also improve their production in the future.
The necessary associated institutions must be improved and empowered.
For example in Nigeria, the current slogan is vision 2020 in which the government hopes to achieve its plan of making Nigeria one of the top economics in the world.
While a land able goal it must remember that similar hope were had for “ Vision 2000” and “Vision 2010” all these failed because institutions like power and water supply upon which almost all economic activities are based are at best epileptic, and these make the economic weather here unfavorable for investors and as such the raw materials produced at the rural end are wasted as buyers are lacking.
Other institutions like the judiciary, security are all require to create peaceful atmosphere will encourage economic development.
3.5 DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MEN, WOMEN AND YOUTHS IN RURAL AREAS The era of one size fits all will have to be done away with the future as rural dwellers have specific needs based on the categories e.g.
men, women and youths.
Youth development is beginning to gain importance in most programmes even the millennium development goals has set specific objectives for youths which correlate with their need for fulfillment and self expression.
Women have specific health requirements, also the running of the home is in their hand and the health care of all family members is generally under 58their control.
So a specific approach to the needs of the women would create a positive multiplier effect on all age groups and categories.
3.6 REDUCTION OF RURAL AND URBAN MIGRATION Specific plans must be made and implemented to halt the rural – urban drift as this is actually counter productive to the well being of the country.
The reason for Rural – Urban drift are not far fetched they include (a) Hopelessness in the situation in the rural areas (b) Public perception that any thing rural is inferior (c) The basic amenities that improve the quality of life are unavailable e.g.
good roads, pipe Bourne water etc.
(d) Inequitable distribution of the country’s resources cause little or no benefits to reach the grassroots while it seems the urban areas are getting better.
The problem posed by the rural – urban drifts are (a) Lost of labour in the rural areas, remember that rural areas supply 80% of the nations agriculture needs, so a migration of unskilled labour to the urban areas will with time degenerate into a food crisis (b) The urban areas while being growing areas cannot cope with the migration of rural dwellers and soon the development if slum will develop as seem in Lagos State.
Incentives must be created to encourage rural dweller to start put and also bring development to them as well as encourages the situation of industries in rural areas so that they can enjoy the attendant benefits like power and roads.
3.7 TRADITION OF CORRUPTION The issue of corruption in Nigeria cannot be over glopped, it has damaged all sectors in the country, for rural development to meet its aspiration 59in the future, corruption must be eradicated or at least kept to a bare minimum so that funds meant for rural development will be made available and use to achieve objectives.
The eradication of corruption will also free up monies that will help other collaborate institutions that are essential partners in rural development.
3.8 INNOVATION The need for innovation will one required in the future as old and archaic ways of thinking and doing things will have to be abolished for example the misplaced belief that rural dwellers are not able to determine the wants and needs which has led to their exclusion from the development of policies involving them.
3.9 AVAILABILITY OF FINANCE As earlier stated, lack of microfinance to rural dweller has been a major hindrance to their self actualization.
So institutions must be set up and already existing ones must be empowered to make available funds the rural dweller 3.10 DEVELOPMENT ON RURAL NON-FARM ENTERPRISES (RENFE’s) The diversification of government policies is involve Rural Non Farm Enterprises which include manufacturing, agricultural processing and service enterprises that play a major role in inclusive rural development.
Their role increase significantly as the economic transformation gathers momentum.
They are important, first, agricultural growth alone cannot produce, absorb the increasing rural labour force in agricultural employments and allows opportunities for rural income increases even with rapid improvements in agricultural productivity.
RNFE; can make a significant contribution to employment generation.
60The urban industrial sector cannot grow fast enough on a sufficiently labour incentives path to fully absorb the surplus labour on agriculture.
RNFE’s can reduce rural – urban income differences and excessive rural to urban migration.
They can also make a potentially significant impact on non – income dimensions of rural poverty.
They shocks, make rural economic growth more equitable and indirectly contribute to improvements in social indicators.
Also by providing small holder farm households with opportunities to transform into pluricative viable economic units less dependent on agriculture.
A more developed rural non farm economy reduces the need for government subsidiaries to make rural development more equitable.
3.11.
PROVISION OF SUBSIDIES These subsidies as a tool for rural development is very important as specific subsidies on agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, irrigated water and energy.
Subsidies help small farmers adopts new agricultural technologies.
For example, the Republic of Korea use subsidies on construction materials to encourages its new village movement” ( The Sac maul movement) in 1970. the government provided 335 bags of cement to each of 33, 267 villages in the country to use for government designated village projects.
In July 1971, this increases to 500 bags of cement for villages that performened well (about 16,000).
Each of these well performing villages also received one too of steel.
The government of Malaysia heavenly subsidized its land resettlement programme initially for rubber cultivation and later for oil palm cultivation through the FELDA for may years by 1987 FELDA has resettled more than 400,000 poor households, over 15% of the rural population.
These land settlement programmes transformed the country’s food crop dominated cow productivity agricultural economy into a one dominated by high 61productivity industrial crops and allowed a large number of rural households to improve their incomes and quality of life.
The plantation also improved rural wage labour and further contributed to poverty reduction.
SELF ASSESSED EXAMINATION (a) Discuss the role of specific rural dweller’s needs on the future success of rural development programmes.
4.0 CONCLUSION The growing need of improve the quality of life of rural dwellers both now and in the future will require a holistic approach involving multidiscipline, honesty on all parties involved and dedication and commitment.
There would have to be a great improvement in the planning, execution and the feed back stages of the programme as well as an adaptability of the programme to respond to changes in need.
5.0 SUMMARY We discussed - The impact of globalization of the future of rural development - The role play by the beneficiaries and their specific needs - The development and benefits of Nigerian Enterprises (RNE’s) - The need for the reduction of Rural – Urban Migration - The need for corruptions eradication.
6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT (a) Write on the role of Rural Non - farm Enterprises (RNE) in the future eradication of rural poverty (b) Explain how the provision of subsidies can help improve the quality of life of rural dwellers.

In this unit, we shall discuss the role of women in rural development programmes in the developing world.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the close of this unit, my desire is that you should be able to achieve the following - Define who a women is - Know the roles of women in social, economic and agricultural programmes - Have a realization that women are the bedrock of rural development 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 DEFINITION OF WOMEN The woman can be defined as the opposite of a man or an adult human female or simply put the female sex.
3.2 WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE The face of the farmer and natural resource manager in the rural areas are normally female in most part of the developing world.
As the world increasingly becomes a global village due to the rate of competition, improved information technology, removal of trade barriers etc Women in developing economies would be further pushed into 65economic obscurity because they were now exposed to competition in production of goods, this goods are coming from more developed countries and China which were produced in highly advanced factories in those countries making the goods produced by the rural women in Africa uncompetitive in terms of price and quality.
Women being home makers are very resilient and dynamic in this part of the world.
Women are playing remarkable roles in the economic activities of their communities.
Women within African are noted for their involvement in commercial agriculture.
A recent statistics of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) indicates that women produce an approximate 70% of the total food and sold to boost economic growth.
Despite this huge problem depending on the peculiarity of the environment they find themselves.
For example when government is distributing farm inputs like improved seeds, farm implement (tractors, combine harvesters, plants etc) fertilizers and even agricultural grants/loans, women are usually, pushed aside or neglected completely.
In many rural areas of the world, women are known to play different roles in farm and non-farm task.
Past and present studies from countries in Africa and India, Asia and Latin America have confirmed that both rural men and women contributed to farm and non-farm task.
The available data concerning the contribution of rural men and women in Nigeria in agricultural production, rural development and security have shown that both participated but women spent 1- - 16 hours daily in productive and reproductive task.
For example, among the Yorubas in the Cocoa belt of South Western Nigeria, women participate in planting, harvesting and spraying cocoa in addition to processing food crops.
Also, the Ibo women living in the forest zone of South Eastern Nigeria, women participate in the farming activities more than their Yoruba counterpart.
66In the Northern States, studies of the rural Muslim and pagan Hausa women found the contribution of women in agriculture to be mainly in the areas of planting, weeding, hoeing, harvesting, processing and livestock rearing both as family labour and as farmers on their own farms.
Further more, studies of the non-Hausa group in the North revealed the active participation of the Tiv, Gwari, Kilba women and women of the pastoral Fulani in agricultural operation on their own farm.
However, women’s activities are seldom counted as work because it has failed to contribute directly to national production.
This condition has changed recently with the formation of programmes to enhance and uplift the lives of the rural dwellers across the world, especially the farmers and the peasants.
These programmes or projects are considered necessary and government have now recognized that the rural families (men and women) need to be supported if the devastating “food crisis” and grinding poverty that parades every where, especially in the third world countries, are to be minimized within a reasonable time limit.
Women are the driving force for rural development.
As we mentioned earlier that women farmers are the major food producers in developing countries and yet they are one of the most vulnerable groups.
The economic empowerment to produce more and to be involved in policy formulation is critical to addressing poverty and food insecurity, knowledge, policies, technology, extension training programmes must therefore be developed by putting women at the centre to coordinate structures and processes to address their needs as food producers and environmental managers through gender main streaming and investing in women and girls to bridge the existing gender gap.
The current misunderstanding and neglect of this fact has contributed to great loss of opportunities and investments in women farmers and thus has had a big impact on food security and poverty alleviation.
Women should no be 67looked upon as vulnerable group, women’s knowledge, experience and roles they play in agriculture make them experts in agricultural and natural resources management, they are key agents in creating sustainable development.
3.3 WOMEN AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT There is the saying that “When you train a girl you have trained a nation”.
This saying underscores the importance of women in the society.
In the same observation, in 1992, the secretary –General, Mr. Boutros Ghali, in his message to mark the 1992 women day advised that plans for sustainable development must be formulated with full participation of women and reflect their interest and perspectives.
His advise was linked to the theme of that year’s women day which was “empowerment of women”, Ghali further said that women played a major role in the global efforts to create the necessary awareness, adding that women could also serve as catalyst that would bring about sustainable development on earth.
He then called on government, non-governmental organizations, community groups and people everywhere to ensure quality of women and men “so that we may strive together, on an equal footing for an environment sustainable development must be formulated with the full participation of women and reflect their interest, needs and perspectives”.
In rural Africa, women work usually goes unnoticed because most of the work is done from the privacy of their homes.
The burden of rearing the children and house chores largely rest upon the shoulders of the women.
If policy makers hope to make faster progress in improving economy performance reducing poverty, slowing down population growth, and stopping environment degradation, they will have to go much further in their efforts to involve women in economic development (11vt 2 1990).
68Before we go any further let us understand the characteristics of rural development: - Rural development must relate to the issue of growth, equity and efficiency in the allocation of resources.
- It involves the mobilization and utilization of available resources to transform the rural area into a modern society within a rural economy that is capable of bringing about social, economic and political stability of the nation.
The rural woman therefore is not a kind of different woman with special features.
It is her location that makes her rural.
She who is located in rural area can simply be said to be a rural woman.
Rural women are identified with agriculture because a large portion of farm lands are in the rural communities.
By and larger, rural development could also be conceptualized as a process through which rural poverty is alleviated by sustained increases in the productivity and incomes of low income rural workers and household (World Bank).
Any good rural development programme must be seen as a separate component of the national development strategy.
For rural development programme to benefit rural women, the following condition must be fulfilled.
- The programme objectives must be clearly stated - Rural women groups must be identified among the target rural population for whom specific measures to raise production and income can be designed and in this case the benefits can be touched and felt by the rural women.
- Research is needed to provide knowledge and information that would help the policy building process.
The research programme must tackle development issues along priority areas spelt out by rural development policy objectives.
69Any women rural development programmer must seek to improve the standard of living of the rural dwellers.
This is very important so that it does not just become a flash in a pan as we have seen in some past rural development programmes which passed away with the government that initiated them.
3.4 WOMEN AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY Women as household leasers play a great role to influence the nutritional status of their household.
This is seen in the way they dispose their income on one hand and their ability to cook and serve appropriate quantity of food to individual household members.
Food security is one of the basis for good nutritional status and women alongside their male counterpart play a very important role in ensuring household food security by virtue of their position as mothers and home makers who are normally directly in charge of food purchases, preparation, serving and feeding of the entire family members.
The international conference on nutrition (ICN), which took place in Rome in 1992, defined food Security as access by living (FAO/WHO, 1992).
Household is simply defined as all persons living together in a house.
It also follows that a household food is secured when all the members are (adequate in forms of quality, quantity and safety).
The food must also be culturally acceptable.
Rural women have always been in the vanguard of the family’s nutritional well being as mothers and homemakers.
Rural women’s contributions to household food security include home production of marketable and non-marketable goods and services.
Rural women who are head of their household are increasingly becoming farm managers.
They contributed to the household supply of food through kitchen, gardens which provided vegetables, tubers and seasonal supplements.
70In sale and distribution of food, women are not left out; they operate many food vending and food preparing activities in rural areas.
These activities are source of income and employment and directly support household food security.
Women are normally saddled with the task of making purchases in the home and transporting food from market to the home, only in cases where they are in seclusion.
The cooking of meals and feeding of children till they are old enough to feed themselves is a preserve of the woman.
Mother’s persistence in encouraging children to eat, help in transmitting eating patterns and many cultural norms related to food and this correlates to food security and good nutrition.
Women are enforces of cleanliness of the environment and their households.
Nowadays, it is a common place to see women involved in varied and various spheres of life.
We have women lawyers, academics, grass root politicians, health workers just to mention a few.
All these endeavors are geared towards income earning and increase household food security.
SELF ASSESSED EXERCISE (S. A. E.) Describe some farm tasks that women in different part of Nigeria undertake.
4.0 CONCLUSION Men are the driving force for rural development.
Women farmers are a part of the main food producers in the developing world but thy have not been accorded the recognition they so deserve.
The more they are economically empowered to produce more food and involved in policy formulation, the more poverty and rural insecurity would be addressed in the rural areas.
715.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have learnt that: - A woman is the opposite of the man or an adult human female.
- That, women in the rural areas play a major role in farming and natural resource management.
- Women are the driving force for rural development - Women play a vital role in providing house hold food security 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT (T. M.

1.0 INTRODUCTION In unit 1, we dwelt more on women in rural development from a developing country perspective but to give us a more informed view of this module we would also consider women in rural areas in the developed world using the European Union bench mark 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, we should have achieve the following � Understanding the concept of rural ness from an European point of view � The roles women play in European communities � Know what is a rural labor market � Equally have a realization that women are very important in the social-economic and agricultural sectors in Europe 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 RURAL AREAS OF EUROPE In the European Union a rural area is strikingly different in turns of social and economic structure geography and culture.
The rural women of Europe are not a homogeneous group.
They all have varied roles and occupation on farms and in family businesses, in employment and in community activities.
Their needs and interest are different too, particularly from one age group to another and depending on the size and composition of their family and age of their children.
As the rural areas undergo transformation in the economic and social activities it does not affect all women in the same way this offers new opportunities to some while other bring difficult challenges.
Agricultural dependent rural economies have been affected by the onset of globalization, leading to the remodeling and decline of the agricultural sector.
The service sectors are blossoming as a result of the 75increase emphasis on technology.
In many areas, this has created new work and employment opportunities as well as bringing changes in the role and status of women.
The rural population is decreasing especially those close to the urban area, cities and towns are now exploding in population.
The global economic melt down and credit crunch have brought about set backs in public services driving more and more people out of the rural areas.
Young women are migrating in large numbers to towns and cities.
Nevertheless as people still prefer to live in towns, the rural areas still presents greater opportunities surveys carried out in European rural areas show that in general, rural women have an affinity to stay in their community an contribute to its development, if the same basic requirements are met.
!
Employment opportunities in the local area, including part time jobs.
!
Local facilities for educational development and training !
Access to getting work experience and vocational qualifications.
!
Availability of corporate services that support women’s projects and enterprises !
Public transport services tat are suitable with working hours.
!
Availability of local child care facilities and social services for the elderly and the ill. !
Public and professional organization that can support rural women activities.
Rural women in this development countries are also looking for a better balance in the sharing of labour in the domestic household, they desire encouragement for their personnel and professional development and more 76support in their bid to achieve financial independence, and to be more fully in involved in the decision making process.
The major challenge for rural development programmes is to identify the constraints on women full participation in economic and public life at local level, and to developed specific programmes in their favour.
3.2 A CASE OF RURAL TO URBAN MIGRATION Finland is one of the member states of the European Union, the population of its citizens living in the rural areas have dropped drastically.
It was also observed that there are now fewer women than men in rural areas.
In 1970, the number of men surpassed women by 26,000,in 1990, the deficit was 39,000.
The proportion of women in rural areas is much lower in those between the age bracket of 25 and 44 years.
The situation is far worse in remote rural areas where in 1988 the proportion of women in the 25 – 44 age groups was only 40%.
3.3 THE RURAL LABOUR MARKET Many years ago, E.P.
prentice wrote in Hunger and history that “Mankind evidently has worked with huger and want.
The recent changes in the global economy are particularly affecting women’s participation in the labor market.
An extreme change is being assemblywomen in the southern states of the European Union, where the labour market has undergone the greatest transformation.
The rural labour market here means a place where skilled and unskilled work is bought and sold for a wage within the rural area formal employment either full or part – time factory work in the food processing industry or home – working for textile industries is now replacing unpaid family farm labour.
77In Italy and Portugal increasing numbers of women are becoming self employed farm managers.
in Spain casual or seasonal wage – work is now a increasing features of female employment in rural areas.
Quality employment opportunities are limited and a far proximity from most rural areas.
Most joins available in the rural areas are low paid, low status job, where the women work below their skills and abilities.
There is a major increase in the number of part time jobs or temporary jobs.
This part –time jobs may fit some women, particularly those with young children, but in general there is a demand for employment with better conditions and longer hours.
The increase in the number of farms owned by women arises mostly from recent developments.
Their husbands go in search of off – farm employment to supplement the income from the farm, and the farm management is shifted to the woman.
In recent years this exchange of farm management roles has become particularly common in the Southern countries of the European Union.
Farm activities are gradually becoming extinct because other farms of employment or self employment are now taking the place of farm work.
In the main rural areas of member states that have a larger Copper Capita, the tertiary sector is a major employee of clerical and service sector staff, which comprises a large percentage of the female work force.
3.4 UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL WITHIN THE RURAL AREAS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION In most rural regions the unemployment levels are generally high and women constitute the higher percentage of unemployed.
Cut backs and centralization on public and private services are frequent in the northern member states, while in the south the problems arise from the reduction in traditional manufacturing industries.
The unemployment 78figures in the rural areas does not reveal the full number of women seeking work, but only those who have registered themselves as unemployed.
Many women who have no right to benefits, or who do not register because there are no job openings fall outside the statistics.
3.4.1 SOME COMPARISONS MADE ON UNEMPLOYMENT RATES In Australia rural regions women shares of employment reached 39.2% in 1991, compared with 41.5% for Australia as a whole.
More than half of the active female population in rural regions was in paid employment.
Today, middle aged women particularly found in paid employment than in the past decades.
In 1997, the activity rate of women in the rural areas of France peaked to 78%, for the first time matching that of the same age group of women in urban areas.
The percentage of active women employed in the tertiary sector in rural areas of France peaked to 72% in 1997, up from 62% in 1990.
It was observed that Finland in 1994 had an unemployment rate of 21% and 20% for both women and men in the rural areas, however the respective figures were 30% and 25%.
3.5 CAREER WOMEN SETTING IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES Women who are active in the family owned businesses and farms usually have no professional status, independent remuneration or separate social security.
This is normally the norm for couples bearing benefits for their business and family.
3.5.1 TIME SPENT WORKING Women play many roles in the family, like household managers and family careers, Organizers and providers of community services and lastly in the economy, farm women usually spend the longest hours working.
The temporary or long term combination of training and employment with everyday responsibilities is therefore difficult to 79realize.
Studies have shown that in Portugal the bulk of agricultural work force is female (54% in 1992), while in France, 60% of family businesses mainly craft and business enterprises are managed by a couple.
Only 6% of the women have the status of “joint collaborator”, and equally few are employed or associated.
The larger portion of women, work more than 39 hours a week, particularly in small commercial business, without any legal status or social protection.
3.5.2 FARM WORK Farm work can be defined as the work typically carried out by men, such as manual work and the more visible managerial task.
The many other jobs associated with the farming business, which women carry out are most of the times not considered as farm work and thus relegated to the same background as caring and house work.
The roles women play in the farm and family businesses are often strictly spelt out, with the administration accounts and orders being mainly women tasks.
In Netherlands for example farm women spend an average of 50 hours per week doing household and family work and 22 hours a week on farm labour which is about 20% of labour needed in the farm.
In Catalonia, Spain, farm women work an average of 77 hours per week.
Also in France a national study highlighted the marked differences in the daily employment of time between women and men and between farm, rural and urban men and women.

CONCLUSION In this unit it is safe for us to conclude that the rural women in the developing countries also play multiple roles in their committees like taking care of their various families and also engaging in businesses and farming.
The bright lights of the city still draws more and more women out of the rural areas because it brightness also brings with it more job opportunities.
There is still a need for systematically designing and implementing rural development programmes that would allow women and men to participate unequal terms.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have learnt that - There are also rural women in the developed countries - That these rural women also participate in commercial businesses and farm work.
81- That most of the jobs suited to women farmers in the developed countries are mostly relegated down and equated to home work and is not considered to be farm work.
- That equal opportunities in the social fabric and economics of rural communities has not been achieved yet even in the European Union ( developed economy ) 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT (T.M.A) How is the face of Rural Europe Changing?

The prevailing misunderstanding and neglect of this fact has resulted in a significant loss of opportunities and investment in women farmers and this has had major consequences on food security and poverty alleviation.
In this unit we shall try to establish the role of extension rural development programmes.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you will be able to: - Recognized Extensions purpose and objectives - The importance of extension programmes.
- Understand that extension is a key to achieving the millennium development goals.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 EXTENSION’S PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
Extension is built on the idea of helping people help themselves and getting them to realize that it is to their interest to help themselves.
It is essential to note that no real rural developmental take place unless the comities do it themselves.
The most valuable thing extension initiatives can give to a group of people and whether it would be put into successful practice is left for the people to do.
Extensionist Core objective is to help rural communities identify their own problems and opportunities, and then to provide practical, research based information that will help them overcome the problems and take advantage of opportunities.
85Initially Extension was focused basically in Agriculture and home economics primarily aimed at rural people but today the subject areas have become more diverse to include areas like engineering, energy use and conservation, housing, land use planning, improvement of environmental quality, and human health, as well as traditional agricultural and home economics programs.
Extension program provide opportunities for a growing number of urban, sub urban, and rural people from all income, racial, and social setting.
These opportunities include a wide variety of projects and other learning experiences.
Local governments are also turning to extension for many type of educational help.
There’s a shift in the direction of extension serving an increasing number of people with a variety of extension and continuing education programs.
So, extension is confronted with an expending audience at a time of rapid social and economic changes.
3.2 MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH To meet the numerous need of the rural people extension must encompass more disciplines.
There is so much talk about the achieving millennium development goals and extension would be one of the drivers for these.
Appropriately ¾ of the world’s poor live in rural areas with women representing the vast majority.
Sustainable development and the Millenium Development Goals (M. D.
Gs.)
will not be achieved unless a holistic and integrated extension approach to rural poverty alleviation is taken through comprehensive rural sustainable development efforts coupled with long term, economic and environment security and partnership development.
Because of the changing need and the complexity of new problems in the society all hands must be on deck to tackle rural development 86problem.
The involvement of kinds of disciplines increases the ability to help people with a wide variety of problems.
These poor rural populations, especially rural women have little to no access to resources, training and support networks, and since most rural economic activity is agriculturally driven, environmental shifts and non-multi-disciplinary or holistic approaches can be detrimental.
Let us take a close look at M. D. G 3 because it goal is to promote gender equality and empower women.
Generally speaking, the millenium development goals are internationally agreed frame work of 8 goals and 18 targets which was complemented by 48 technical indicators to measure progress towards the millenium development goals.
M. D. Gs.
has one target and 4 indicators.
These are: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and second education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015.
INDICATORS !
Ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education (UNESCO) !
Ratio of literate women to men, 15 – 20 years old UNESCO !
Share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector (ILO) !
Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament from the time line given for the achievement of these goals we are tempted to say Africa and the most developing nations might not even get close to achieving this goal that relates to gender equality and the empowerment of women.
The only way to fast track achievement of this M. D. Gs.
In Africa is basically by building cross-trained extension terms and sending them into the rural areas to work with the people on ways of improving their socio-economic and educational needs.
Extension personnel combine the 87expertise of a variety of professionals in such a way as to be of maximum benefit in solving the problems.
Extension workers are simply the touch bearers who take light to the dark accessible and inaccessible areas that crave change.
3.3 WHAT IS EXTENSION WORK?
Extension work consist of the giving of instruction and practical demonstrations in areas like agricultural, home economics etc to persons not necessary formally educated or in school in the several communities, ad imparting to such persons information on said subjects through fields demonstrations, publications and other wise.
It emphasizes on a lot of contact.
As the country’s developmental needs continue to change, extension activities would change to meet them.
But regardless of the labels given extension programs, it is the people served who are important.
The overall objective will continue to be to plan, execute, and evaluate learning experiences consistent with locally identified needs that will help people acquire the understanding, capabilities, attitudes and skills essential for solving farm, home and community problems.
3.4 WHO IS AN EXTENSION WORKER?
Extension work today demands an educational background that is especially designed to fit workers for the profession.
The basic philosophy should be to have extension workers as well trained as possible in broad fundamentals during their undergraduate work, and to develop them into well qualified, technical persons that are ready to work on the field.
The extension worker is a field worker and not someone that loves the permanence of air conditioned office.
The extension worker is an agent of change.
883.5 EXTENSION AND THE RURAL WOMAN Extension initiatives can help women in the rural communities to improve their standard of living and would see these in the reduction of poverty, increased food security an identifiable development.
But the current extension initiatives have not been favourable to the rural women it is burdened with a lot of challenges.
In the field of extension women are very small in number it is still a preserve for men.
In most developing countries extension work might be considered to be adventurous for a woman especially if she is married.
The male extensionist might subscribe to the authoritarian approach to extension because of the notion that he is the boss, thereby making it impossible for rural women to open up their unique needed to the extension initiative.
The rural woman becomes reclusive and this becomes a barrier to a two way communication.
It is common knowledge that most farm implements are built to suit the male farmer and it is only through extension inquiry can the rural woman demand a modification to suit the woman farmer.
Extension is built on the bedrock of communication.
Communication simply means imparting information.
An extension outreach aimed at rural women, must not be rigid it must make use of all local and modern means of dissemination information to make sure the rural woman benefits from the communication.
The extension outreach must be custom built for each local community.
The extension givers and beneficiaries have to build an atmosphere of trust and cordiality among them, the rural women must be motivated to open up and express themselves.
The extension outreach would not be complete if the extension worker does not patiently help the rural women to identify their real needs and how they can actively solve it within the shortest possible time.
89As a result of cultural and religious differences in some part of the developing world, there is a need for more women to be trained in extension work.
For example in the northern art of Nigeria where they are predominantly Moslems, no male extension worker would be permitted to teach Moslem rural women farmers how to plant improved seedling to increase there crop yields, it is totally forbidden, only under the watchful supervision of their husbands.
During training sessions, extensionist should try as much as possible to be profession about their presenting at the same time not sounding too academic.
They should embrace the use of audio visual aids like movies on the subject being trained, power point presentations, and many other virtual conferencing mediums.
A lot of time is saved by the use of audio visuals in teaching compared to when reading out bulky training manuals, this confirms the saying “A picture conveys a thousand words”.
Real life case have worked in distant lands can be beamed on a screen to the rural women to stimulate their interest and bring that feeling if it worked for them it can work for us.
This also benefits the extensionist in the area of reducing energy spent on explanations; the audio visuals bring tape being taught to life.
In countries where the technological penetration is low then the mass media is the best way of reaching the rural people.
The extension initiatives could now be translated into the local dialect of the target rural people and then put on radio and local television.
This is also a good strategy for reaching village with extension messages.
The rural women in this hard to reach villages can also be trained through distance learning programs where the pocket radio would serve as the conduct through which the teacher and the student communicate.
90SELF ASSESSED EXERCISE (S. A. E) 4.0 CONCLUSION This unit direct on extension role and activities in rural development.
Extension has a broad and enlarging responsibility.
If it to help to actualize the millennium development goals it needs an expanded staff and a better trained staff, and it should place increased emphasis on developing more efficient methods.
Extension must also have a dynamic program one constantly modernized to keep people and it must focus its resources on essentials, through shifting to areas of need.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have learnt about � The philosophy of extension � That extension work has shifted from traditional agricultural and home economics to now include a wide variety of discipline � What extension work entails � That the extensionist is a change agent that communicates positive change to the community by teaching them to be participators in the development process.

We also established that there is a great poverty problem in the rural areas.
In this unit, we shall discuss co-operatives and how these co-operatives can be a vehicle for transforming the poverty in the rural area into wealth.
There is no how any nation can achieve rural development and wealth creation without considering the impact co-operatives have or would have on the rural communities.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you will be able to: ./ Define what is a cooperative ./ Distinguish the different types of cooperatives ./ See how cooperatives can bring about rural development.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN THROUGH COOPERATIVES The world of today is characterized by globalization championed by competition, high rate of growth but a one sided distributive system constraining the balanced and wider dispersal of gains of growth.
Information technology has really benefited these in the urban area but it has had very little effect on those in the rural area that are involved in agriculture, rural labour said other workers.
Similarly this segment of the population has not gotten much benefit from increased economic growth.
Generally speaking, cooperatives are socio economic enterprises created on the basis of equity and democratically managed to empower their members to deal with the challenges of market competition and to safeguard themselves against exploitation.
94Cooperatives are built on the principle of cooperation and each principle of cooperation tends towards empowerment.
Cooperatives are democratic so they encourage members to participate in decision making process on equal basis.
In the proceeding units we have established that for there to be any meaningful rural development women must be carried along because women constitute a major part of the rural population.
Approximately ¾ of the world poor live in rural area with women representing the vast majority.
Cooperative is one of the most effective which is for organizing modernized rural production.
In this unit, we shall try to establish the history of cooperatives and all it entails.
3.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF COOPERATIVES Cooperatives as we have them today started under the capitalist system as a remedy against exploitation.
The Rochdale pioneers of England in 1844 came up with a little idea which they did not know would become something great that would change the would.
The idea was the mobilizing of people with limited resources into an organize unit.
The Rochdale pioneers main objective was to protect themselves from capitalist exploitation and making sure equal trading conditions through honest weight, pure and unadulterated goods and freedom from debts.
These desires, which are not new is still very present in most less developed countries today.
Cooperation they discovered is the vehicle for mobilizing the resources of rural primary producers.
Cooperatives are built along a set of working rules that originated from the Rochdale pioneers these are: A. UNIVERSALITY:-This emphasizes that cooperatives should not differentiate people based on race, religion, colour or sex.
95B.
DEMOCRACY: - It lays emphasis on humanitarianism with economic efficiency and freedom of every participator in the cooperative to have a say in the decision making process of the cooperatives.
All members should have an equal say.
C. LIBERTY: - In cooperation, liberalism is a key all participants have freedom of entry and exit into the cooperatives.
Nobody should be tricked or compelled to join the cooperative.
D. FRATERNITY AND UNITY: - All members of the cooperative mist see each other as brothers.
All forms of unhealthy competitions, nationalistic bias must be eliminated through education, encouragement of working together in productive cooperatives.
All controversial issues should be excluded from the operations of cooperatives because brothers are supposed to be open to each other.
E. SELF HELP: - This states that only individuals who participant in cooperatives can bring themselves out of poverty and not to look unto someone else to pull them out.
This rule can be put into practice when cooperatives reject too much government aids or interference, in the affairs of cooperatives and also cooperatives should stay away from privileges from government or other agencies because these will not allow the cooperatives to grow and stand on its own.
This is still not evident in cooperatives in developing countries.
That is why most cooperatives in the developing countries look like departments of government agencies and when that government regime that backs it up is gone the cooperatives go with the government.
96F.
STRICT ECONOMY: - This rule emphasizes the reduction of cost in all the cooperatives activities.
Here the cooperatives can accumulate overages and/or surpluses not necessary the maximization of profit.
G. EQUITY AND JUSTICE: - This mandates that; (i) All patrons must be treated equally.
(ii) All forms of labour have to receive equal wages and fair treatment.
(iii) The profit that businesses are identified with should be replaced with the motive of service at cost minimum “surplus” or “Overage”.
(iv) Whenever there is a surplus or overage it must be distributed in proportion to the business carried out each member of the cooperative.
(v) All capital put into the cooperative must be rewarded only at a minimum rate of interest if any reward is to be given.
3.2.1 DEFINITION OF COOPERATIVES Erdman and Tinley defined cooperatives as follows: “A cooperative association is a voluntary organization of persons with a common interest, formed and operated along democratic lines for the purpose of supply services at cost its members, who contribute both capital and business”.
3.3 TYPES OF COOPERATIVES In the unit we have identified seven (7) types of cooperatives and we would try to dwell on them a little.
The seven types of cooperatives are; - Marketing Cooperatives - Processing Cooperatives - Production Cooperatives 97- Supplies Cooperatives - Credit Cooperatives - Service Cooperatives - Multipurpose Cooperatives 3.3.1 MARKETING COOPERATIVES This is a type of cooperative who main function is to trade (buyer or sell) products on behalf it members.
This kind of cooperative can buy goods for resale to its members.
Accountability is a major attribute of these kind of cooperative, at the end of each trading done on behalf of the members a statement of income and expenses incurred is prepared.
Every excess of income over expenditure is usually termed savings or could be called “overage” and not profits in conventional business.
An overage is defined as the difference between the amount of money spent by cooperative in covering operating expenses and the actual expenses incurred.
It is a rule in cooperatives to perform services at a cost, overages are usually distributed in a orderly way back to the patrons of the4 cooperatives.
The patrons are individuals who first formed the cooperatives.
Overage is similar to business profits in the sense it is an excess deduction that is given back to the patrons of the cooperative.
Overages are distributed back to the patrons on the basis of each patron contribution to the total periodic business of the cooperatives.
3.3.2 PROCESSING COOPERATIVE Processing cooperatives have arisen from the processing of commodities produced by members of marketing cooperatives.
The processing activities usually embarked on were in freezing and canning of fruits and vegetable, butter-making and other types of processing.
More modern processing cooperatives are now involved in most all forms of processing and packing of food like grains, vegetables, and meat and diary products.
98The even engage in the milling of grain, freezing of food and modernized storage of crops.
In Africa and other developing countries where agriculture processing is still at its traditional level, processing cooperatives could serve as platforms for the development of cottage industries and agro industries.
These processing cooperatives can be organized around rural women who are principally the traditional processor of farm produce.
This would help in the creation of jobs and in the uplifting of the lives of the rural community.
3.3.3 PRODUCTION COOPERATIVES Production cooperatives are cooperatives that process agricultural produces such as farming and animal husbandry or fishing in common.
Members of these cooperatives have a united farm and production.
Production cooperatives in its purest forms does not encourage members to own their own individual farms bur if they do have, those farms are to help in augmenting the earnings earned from the common farm to meet there individual family needs.
This type of cooperative is built on the premise that even in production cooperation is possible.
Production cooperatives because of the number of people involved brings about economics of scale in the production operations.
During production there economics of scale could be benefited in the utilization of machinery, cooperative plant protection, in irrigation and water utilization.
Also because of the numbers involved in production cooperatives more ideas are pooled into the decision making processes and these would normally result to improved utilization of limited resources, improved division of labour and the increase in the production capacity of the cooperatives.
993.3.4 SUPPLIES COOPERATIVE Supply cooperatives are defined by two main ingredients i.
Farm supply cooperatives.
ii.
Consumer cooperatives.
This is so because they supply member needs either for local consumption or put into farm production or as non – consumable needs of the member’s families.
The Rochdale Pioneer Cooperative was the earliest form of supplies cooperative.
Farm supply cooperatives buy farm and other farm related supplies and sell at the lowest cost possible to members.
Consumer cooperatives are normally formed by consumer groups for the collective purchase and sale of clothing, food and other household needs.
The major disadvantage of farm and supply Cooperatives is the low volume of business they conduct, especially in the buying and selling of limited quarantine of products on member behalf.
The major advantage supply of cooperatives is their ability to get cheap supplies of the right quality and good quality of products to their members.
3.3.5. CREDIT COOPERATIVES Credit cooperatives are cooperatives that help their members get access to money to borrow.
Cooperatives need funds for three main purposes, Firstly, they need funds for the purchase of facilities such as land, buildings, equipment and other fixed assets.
Secondly, they need funds to meet up with the daily operating cost like the payment of wages and safaris, insurance, power and light e.t.c.
Thirdly, funds are needed to be given to members to pay for commodities or supplies diverted to them.
Credit cooperatives can raise these funds from members of the cooperatives or fro mother outside 100sources such as banks, insurance companies, government grants e.t.c.
credit cooperatives are well spread in Nigeria.
Credit cooperatives usually impose a membership fees on new members who want to join, but generally this amount would be very small.
This is also a way of raising funds for the cooperatives.
Rich members of these cooperatives can issue promissory notes to the cooperatives.
Mature cooperatives can issue bonds that have a iced majority date.
Cooperatives can also issue out shares, which could be ordinary or preferred shares.
The share system is the most used form of capitalization and is becoming major form of raising funds.
There are many types of credit cooperatives like Cooperatives banks, rural credit arts and agricultural credit cooperation and thee cooperatives meet the needs of their respective cooperatives member.
3.3.6 SERVICE COOPERATIVES Service cooperatives are cooperatives associations formed to meet specific needs of members.
Service cooperatives are either focused on agriculture or on providing a specific infrastructural need.
These service associations provide the required service on behalf of their members and farmers in general.
In the United States and many developed countries service cooperatives impact are felt in the development of the rural areas but in most part of Africa the service Cooperative Associations has not been making much progress in the area of providing services, but there are few cases of service cooperatives providing housing schemes.
Below are some of the services that a well organized service cooperatives could provide - Recycling - Diary herd improvement - Irrigation 101- Soil conservation - Medical care - Housing - Mortuary services - Schools e.t.c.
If those services cooperatives are encouraged in the developing nations it would help in stimulating fast rural developing.
3.3.7.
MULTI PURPOSE COOPERATIVES As the name implies the multi purpose cooperatives are cooperatives that are all encompassing in the sense that they perform so many functions.
Usually most cooperatives usually start as specific cooperatives to meet a particular need the members desired at the time the cooperative was constituted but as the cooperative evolves with time its scope broadens.
For example marketing cooperatives might begin to give credit to its members and later on start receiving deposits from its members.
Multi purpose cooperatives are vehicles for facilitating rural development, because it carries the rural people along and all the functions it performs are suited to the need of the particular community the cooperatives located.
It encourages the rural people to go into self employment and direct them towards economic ventures that would benefit the rural people.
Multi purpose cooperatives could be easily started with the limited resources available to the people.
When this cooperatives becomes too big they may loose focus and become inefficient.
Over ambition might also drive these cooperatives into business ventures, they do not have the funds to finance making them to go hand in cap to the government for helps.
102But after all is said, a multi-purpose cooperative is the key to open the doors for sustainable rural development in Africa and other rural communities.
Generally, cooperatives success is predicted on constant training, good government supervision and the willingness of members to continue to commit more and more funds into these cooperatives.
3.4 RURAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH COOPERATIVES The developing countries especially those in Asia and Africa could benefit from the services of cooperatives.
The government of these countries should go a long way in supporting and encouraging their rural communities to set up cooperatives, most times the rural people want to be encouraged to move forward.
The developed countries have agreed on 8 goals and 18 targets which is commonly known as the millennium development goals, the first development goal is to eradicate poverty and extreme hunger by halve between 1990 and 2015 but so far Africa is far away from achieving that.
Most African do not earn up to dollar a day.
Cooperatives would help to empower the rural people of Africa, because cooperatives are socio economic enterprises set up on the basis of equity and democratically run to empower the cooperators to deal with the obstacles of market competition and to safeguard the cooperators from exploitation.
Cooperatives would discourage the rural people who are used to act alone in isolation to now be brought into organized associations where they would be trained on the current practices in production and other business that work.
All the help and advice the members of the cooperatives need would be provided to them by the cooperatives.
The kind of cooperatives that would impact the developing nations would have to be run by well trained managers who have been trained in specialized cooperative colleges.
The operation of these cooperatives 103would all adhere to due process, there would be proper contracts to ensure performance, dedicated service levels, production of uniform quality and the timely payment of all loans.
Cooperatives in developing countries should be backed by government to go into international trade by taking advantage of globalization and information technology.
One possible way of doing these is to provide the rural people with the infrastructure to go into electronic commerce where they can trade with other buyers and sellers around the globe.
Research centers and educational institutions should start teaching modules and researching on the improvement of cooperation among rural cooperatives.
If they are not cooperatives colleges, they should be established and if they exist they should be expanded.
Government of developing countries should bench mark the cooperatives models that have worked in Europe and America and see how those models could be suited to fit their local rural development programmes.
For example service cooperatives have made great contributions to rural development in the United States.
SELF ASSESSD EXERCISE (SAE) What is a cooperative and how did they start?
4.0 CONCLUSION A cooperative association is a voluntary organization of persons with a common interest, formed and operated along democratic lines for the purpose of supply services at cost to its members who contribute both capital and business.
We also learnt that the earliest form of cooperatives started by the Rochdale pioneers of England in 1844, they brought together many people with limited resources to come together and trade on an equitable basis where they where shielded from capitalist exploitation.
104They are seven types of Cooperatives which are:- a.
Marketing Cooperatives b.
Processing Cooperatives c. Production Cooperatives d. Supplies Cooperatives e. Credit Cooperatives f. Service Cooperatives g. Multi purpose Cooperatives Cooperatives have helped in bringing about rural development in the developed world and if the cooperative associations can be properly adopted to fit our conditions in the developing country, it would help to bring economic prosperity to us.
5.0.
SUMMARY Cooperative associations are built on equitable cooperation, win – win relationships.
What ever is the need of the members of the cooperators at the particular time would determine the type of cooperative to be formed.
Cooperatives are not built with the profit motive like the regular business they have the service at cost minimum motive.
Members of the cooperatives are usually the contributors of capital to the cooperatives.
In summary, cooperatives are Socio – economic enterprises created on the basis of equity and democratically managed to empower their members to overcome challenges of market competition.
Cooperatives also safeguard members from exploitation by capitalist.
Cooperatives by improving the economics of the rural man or woman would in the long run nip poverty in the bud and bring out rural development.

Extensions philosophy is to encourage the rural people to help themselves and that all they have learnt during extension trainings they must put it into action.
In unit 3 we also have learnt that extension has shifted from it traditional areas of agriculture and home economics to drawing in move areas like engineering, environmental management, information technology to mention but a few.
In this unit we shall focus on how women can bring about sustainable development in rural areas.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you will be able to To see women’s contribution to local and community development.
To see women venturing into new economic sector To see the need for rural services and infrastructure.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 INTEGRATED WOMEN IN DECISION MAKING Women’s contribution to local and community development is important, but rural women every where are in a minority in decision making and planning, particularly at regional and nutritional levels.
This is a result of the multiple roles and work load women play in the community.
The traditional view about women and men’s role in the society also determines what a woman can contribute.
The formal, hierarchical model of many organizations is not compatible with the more co-operative approach women tend to adopt, particularly in the community.
The hours needed to get women acquainted with formal organizational procedures should not be an obstacle to women participation.
For example in rural Spain, the 109participation of women is high in cultural associations, women’s associations and community groups, and is low in professional organizations, co-operatives and trade unions.
In Nigeria, women also engage in small scale enterprises in the informal sector, and in other activities such as food processing, textiles, tailoring and other general services.
The predominance of women is small scale industries may be linked to their limited access to critical resources, like formal education, credit facilities and technology.
The low level of participation by women in decision making inevitable leads to biases in the priorities and policies pursued by development organizations.
An equitable participation by women and men in decision making is important for local democracy and for the quality of decisions taken on development that affect the life and future of rural communities and economies.
3.1.1 WOMEN MUST PARTICIPATE IN DECISION MAKING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES Local development organizations and professional associations as well as local and regional authorities must actively encourage and support women in planning and decision making.
Women should be appointed into management boards and committees.
The following sectors should be reviewed with the eye to fit the gender orientation: i.
Organizational culture and structure ii.
Recruitment procedure and promotion of staff iii.
Terms and conditions of employment (working time) iv.
The selection and nomination of board and committee members v. Procedures used for decision making vi.
The timing and location of meeting and events.
110At local regional and national level calculated steps should be taken in: !
The establishment of associations and networks of rural women !
The involvement of existing women’s associations in committee and partnerships; !
Encouraging women’s group to apply for funding for development initiatives !
Linking up women’s associations with development organizations.
!
Enhancing main streaming projects in existing organization !
Creating awareness among women’s associations and groups about available rural development programmes and projects Women always blame lack of time as the culprit preventing them from participating in community development, every effort should be put in to remove these challenges and ensure that women participate.
It may be necessary to provide childcare and transport facilities, and men may need to be encouraged to be more participatory in household and family chores.
3.2 WOMEN VENTURING INTO NEW ECONOMIC SECTORS Effective rural development brings about opportunities for high quality employment.
This in turn opens up new employment prospects for young women, who might otherwise move away.
Advantage can be taken of new and growing sectors, such as telecommunications, local services, tourism, leisure services and environmental improvement.
In Rivers State, Nigeria, an N. G. O., E. S. I. supported by Skye Bank, launched a female Lab driver’s scheme.
This scheme kicked off with 53 brand new tax: Cars which has opened new routes and provided full and par time employment for the women drivers.
Impacting female employment in developing countries does not always call for actions focused specifically at women.
Identifying economic sectors that have developed most potential and that can make a 111special contribution to female employment is a way of integrating equal opportunities into rural development.
3.3 WOMEN AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING A cry for appropriate and accessible training has constantly been seeing in survey and studies of women’s needs in rural areas.
Women often represent an untapped resource, with a range of special aptitudes and skills ready to be developed and put to use in the formal economic sector.
A lot of women already have a form of vocational qualifications, which may need updating to prepare them to re-enter the labour market.
But the right support and encouragement is needed and, especially, training needs to be a realistic and practically achievable option.
Women should be taught how to develop themselves this would improve their confidence, build up their strengths and abilities.
When this has been achieved, women can now be introduced into more vocational oriented training programmes.
Such courses normally arise from networks of mutual support and practical action leading to the forming of co-operatives, small businesses or local services.
Customary views about the role of women and men can still influence the choices women make when pursuing vocational training.
Instead of choosing the conventional women areas, positive action can be taken to encourage women to explore the possibilities offered by customary male areas.
This widening of roles can be stimulated to the individual and rewarding in both social and economic terms.
In Greece, rural women attend courses on clothing, handicrafts, rural home economics, food processing and agricultural tourism: in contrast, for subjects such as animal husbandry, arboriculture, horticulture and agricultural machinery women represent less than 20% of the trainees.
1123.4 WOMEN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP When women embrace entrepreneurship in other wards go into self employment this puts women at the forefront of innovation and diversification in rural areas, for example by developing craft enterprises, catering services, telecommunication and laundry services.
Women often have the added advantage of an awareness and knowledge of local needs and special interpersonal and communication skills In Bangladesh the village pay phone initiatives have made many poor rural women owners of their own business, also in Nigeria it is now common sight to see rural omen under umbrella’s vendoring GSM services to their customers.
3.4.1 SUPPORT SERVICES FOR WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS Women venturing into employment or cooperatives need quality support services.
Existing services can often be reviewed and adapted or expanded to address the specific needs of self employed women.
Experience shows that, prior to starting a business, women normally prefer to participate in women only courses and groups.
But once their business has been established they want access to support services that would suit the kind and side of business they have created, and to the sector in which it operates.
In the opening stages, women may require initial counseling to help develop their ideas, identify their skills and capacity, and increase their confidence.
When the business is growing a set of business support also needed: 1.
Specialized business start-up courses and technical assistance, 2.
Improved access to finance and credit- through credit guaranteed funds, special loan funds or favorable action in credit applications at start up and growing stages.
1133.
For women farmers, training and technical advice in now farming techniques, diversification and management.
4.
Involvement of successful entrepreneurs to serve as mentors.
3.5 THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE RURAL AREAS The desire of people and young families in rural areas are distinct from those of past generations.
Building a social and community framework that meets those expectations is an integral part of effective rural development.
An efficient transport network, with reliable services, vehicles, routes and timetables adapted to local needs, is crucial.
Security and protection at isolated bus stop is specifically important for women and young people so that should also be put into consideration.
When rural women have easy access to services like shops, healthcare, schools this plays a big part in sustaining rural communities.
But other social and community needs should not be forgotten like the internet, entertainment revitalization of linguistic and cultural traditions, and the architectural heritage and the environment.
When all this is done, these can attract back young people and maintain the rural population.
Also these would create oppotnuity for creating income and employment.
SELF ASSESSED EXERSICE (SAE) Is entrepreneurship good for the rural women?
Discuss.
4.0 CONCLUSION Rural women in the general are very the planning and decision making processes in their communities.
When there is a balance of women and men in decision making democracy would be strengthened and the quality of decision made would improve.
Today’s rural women have started to venture into other economic sectors that in the pat was the playing field of men, these trend should be encouraged by all stake holders in rural development.
Women have 114started to embrace entrepreneurship with renewed interest in the rural area and with the help of support groups and governments poverty would be reduced to the barest minimum.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have discussed and learnt the following a.
Women must be integrated into the decision making processes in their various rural communities to help in bringing about sustainable rural development.
b.
That when rural development is effective more quality jobs would naturally spring up in the rural areas.
c. Women in some parts of the world have started to venture into occupations that in the past where preserved for men.
d. That rural woman is now clamouring for training in appropriated vocational education that would better their lives and that of their communities.
e. That more and more rural woman now owes their own small and medium size business.
f. When the rural communities have services and infrastructures the younger generation would stay in the rural communities and those who have left for the urban centers would return back.
6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT (TMA) Briefly discuss how women can be involved in the decision making activities of their communities.

INTRODUCTION The forces that would determine the roles youth would play in rural development today will be the forces that would shape our world tomorrow.
Rural youths are human resources for bringing about sustainable development.
Economist recognizes rural youth as one of the” economic capitals” in sustainable agricultural and rural development.
The other economic capitals are natural resource capital, social and institutional capital, science and technological capital.
Rural youths as human capitals are an active agent of change and a beneficiary of change and progress.
When their talents are harnessed and used properly, human capital is the only one that can build and use the other capitals such as technology and natural resources, for sustainable rural development.
In this unit, we shall discuss who is the rural and the current situation of the rural youth.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you will be able to - Recognize who is the rural youth - Recognize where they can be found.
- Explain the challenges the rural youth face.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 WHO ARE RURAL YOUTH When you are trying to define a rural youth you must pt into consideration the age and the location as major corner stone for attempting to define a rural youth.
In the world today they are about one billion youths.
The United Nations defines a youth as all individuals between 15 and 24 years old.
The 2007 World Development Report which had an eye on the next 118generation; expands the definition of youth to include all young people between 12 and 24.
The problem of separating the urban youth from the rural is getting more and more difficult.
But it is safe to say most rural youths depend on agriculture for their source of livelihood.
Eighty-Five (85) percent of the population of youth in the world lives in the developing countries, where 99% of population growth is occurring.
It is believed that 50% percent of the population in developing countries live in rural areas while some 61.5 percent of youth in Asia.
The Vast Majority of Youth Living in the Developing World, Many in Rural Areas, where they are Vulnerable to Poverty Youth population ( those between 15 18% of the world’s population, 1 and 24 years) billion people Expected growth in youth population 116 million2 between 2000 and 2010 Percentage of youth living in Approximately 85% developing countries Percentage of youth living in Asia 61.5%2 Growth in youth unemployment 8 million between 1995 and 1999 Source: Youth Employment Opportunities in Rural Development 119 The larger numbers of youths in the World make a significant economic factor in development.
But because of the larger number of youth in rural areas and the poor economic situation of many development countries, there is a challenge of mobilization and include youth as active participants in the process of sustainable agricultural and rural development.
1203.2 THE CURRENT ISSUES AND CHALLENGES OF RURAL YOUTHS Traditionally, when policies are being formed concerning youths they are based one the premises that the youth are in transaction from childhood to adulthood and they have specific attributes that make them a different demographic and social group.
The way youth transit from childhood to adulthood has changed over time and changes from one country to another.
Rural children in the developing world become adults quickly because they have to start working earlier than their counterparts in the urban areas; they take on adult responsibilities more early in life.
In the rural areas society demands that young people must contribute to meeting the livelihood needs of their households from on early age.
Youth as agents of change and creators of wealth and services, they individually have very little economic say in the village and in the bigger economy.
With the shortage of job opportunities especially for the untrained, the low economic value of rural youth is due to their large numbers as well as the inadequate know how and experience that is productive for development.
This is more serious for the rural youth that has little or no formal schooling or those who had to quit school early in life.
A large number of youths are unable to reach their potential because of accrue poverty and associated hunger is seen in the rural areas.
Although many youth today are more educated than their parents’ generation, they usually do not have the required employable skills.
Even when good education and training are being received by the youth, they are sill challenges like the social customs for example apathy towards girl child education, lack of access to capital.
Corruption is also a 121huge problem in most of the developing world, monies meant for educating the poor are siphoned by corrupt government officials.
There is also the problem of youth numbers growing faster than the rate of job creation, the job openings are too few for the number of youth seeking them.
As a result of the aforementioned a large number of youth are unemployed or underemployed.
These youth become deprived as a result of lack of income leading to loss of respect and loss sense of belonging in their respective communities.
When the rural youth is not able to secure gainful employment in the rural areas, the next line of action is to look to the urban areas for employment opportunities.
But without the right qualifications and skills suited for the urban labor market, these youths may not stand the chance of gaining a decent employment in the urban areas.
When these rural youths who are in the cause of transiting to urban youths do not get jobs, they are very much anticipated, they now results to drugs, crime, prostitution e.t.c.
to make ends meet.
Table 1: Youth Unemployment Rates by Region 1995 and 2005.
Region 1995 2005 Developed economics and E.U 15.2 13.1 Central and Easter Europe and C.I.S 19.6 19.9 East Asia 7.5 7.8 South East Asia pacific 9.2 15.8 South Asia 9.9 1.0 Latin America and the Caribbean 14.4 16.6 Middle East and North Africa 28.7 25.7 Sub – Saharan Africa 17.5 18.1 Source: ILO, Global Employment Trends, 2006.
122Another major issue with the rural youth is they normally lack economic independence.
The rural household is usually large extended households where youths are subordinate members of the households that are largely dependent on their parents for their livelihood needs.
As the youth grow the males would become less dependent on their parents faster and also the females in most traditional and poorest low income countries may be married off shortly after primary or secondary school.
Two thirds of the rural population depends on agriculture for their survival but they own very little farm land.
This lack of complete ownership of their farmlands makes the rural farmers not to enjoy the full benefits of their labor, these results to food insecurity and unwillingness to take risks especially I areas of new technology.
In Nigeria for example most of the rural people are selling their farmlands to estate developers and spending the monies on unprofitable ventures.
In situations when the community lands have all being sold out to the capitalist there is no land left for the young people to make a living.
We can see poverty in the form of hunger and malnutrition which hampers learning abilities of children and youth.
When the youths and children are impaired by poverty they are unable to finish their education and have limited employment opportunities, therefore the keep on recycling hunger and poverty.
3.3 RURAL YOUTHS AS TOOLS FOR EXPLOITATION As a result of all the issues we discussed earlier as reasons for the high youth employment in the rural areas.
These issue when not properly address could lead to the exploitation of the rural youths in many ways like: !
Employment of the youths in un safe occupations where they are poorly enumerated.
!
In bonded labour in conditions of slavery or semi slavery.
123!
Through the condition involvement in commercial sex trades exposing them to HIV and AIDS.
!
They may be voluntarily or compulsorily recruited as under age soldiers in areas of civil wars.
Youth usually fall prey to exploitation because many employers prefer to engage youths because they are easier to control and be subdued.
When youths do not have the education and skills as a result of the inability of their families to support them in school and when the local economy does not present any prospect of dignified work that pays well, these youth fall prey to exploitation.
For us to have a proper view of the exploitation youth and children go through, we would look at some facts in some few selected developing countries with large rural populations in Africa and Asia.
!
In china the ILO estimated that they were 9, 224,000 economically active boys and girls who worked in industries such as coal mining and Urban Factories as at the year 2000. !
A large population of Nigeria youth desire to seek greener pasture in Europe and America and they usually end up by all means end up in the hands of human traffickers.
Recently, they have been cases of repatriations of Nigeria young women from Italy.
The government had to set up a National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons ( NAPTIP ).
!
In Sri Lanka approximately 25,000 children between the ages of 10 – 14 are economically active.
170,000 young Sri Lanka women work as maids in the middle-east Korean and elsewhere are normally shamefully exploited.
!
The carpet industry alone in India has approximately 300,000 children working under conditions similar to bonded labour.
124Rural youths in areas of civil wars are the most likely victims to be recruited as child soldiers.
Children are recruited in violation of the law as combatants and seventy in rebel groups and insurrection in 85 countries.
Amnesty international has discovered that now, simple, light weight weapons have made it easier to arm children and teenagers than in the past.
In the globe more than half a million children under 18 have been recruited into government armed forces, paramilitaries, civil militia and other armed groups in more than 85 countries.
Young people are easily deceived and some join these armed groups voluntarily while others are abducted by force.
For example.
In some parts of Uganda the Lords resistant army is still in the habit of abducting youths and turning them into child soldiers.
In Cambodia the United Nations reported 1,300 child soldiers in one region between July, 1997and June 1999.
SELF ASSESED EXERCISE (SAE) Who is a youth?
4.0 CONCLUSION Youth are an important part of our society that must be giving cognizance in the scheme of things.
Economist have recognized rural youth as one of the economic capitals”.
In the world today they are about one billion youths.
According to the United Nations, the youth is any person between the ages of 15 and 24.
One major similarity we have observed that rural youths have with rural women is that they too are victims of poverty and economic deprivation.
1255.0 SUMMARY !
Youths are individuals who fall between the ages of 15 and 24 years old.
!
85 percent of the population of youth lives in the developing countries.
!
50 percent of the population of developing countries lives in the rural areas.
!
61.5 percent of youth live in Asia !
Poverty, lack of good education, unemployment, and under employment are still the major challenges affecting the youths in the rural areas.

There is a growing awareness on the importance of planning for the future of the youths, a deviation from the past when they where neglected.
Target 16 of the millennium development goal do single out the youth as a key target group its main theme is to develop and implement strategies for decent and productive work for youth; A recent publication in 2007 by the World Development Report is also focuses on the youth, this shows that governments, Civil Society Organizations, donor agencies have began to see the potential influence youths have on the developmental process.
Globalization, Urbanization, Unchanging agricultural sectors and rural environmental pollution are some of the issues youth are faced with today.
Planning for the future of the youths would involve changing the present policies and programmes so that rural youth can surmount the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities in the changing world.
In this unit we bring to light some of the ways these reforms are been done.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you would be able; !
How Globalization is changing the rural youth !
See how governments and other stake holders in youth development can help in solving the challenges rural youths are exposed to.
!
You will be able to prefer solutions to youth development problems in your own communities if you are called upon.
1293.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 GLOBALIZATION IMPACT IN THE RURAL YOUTH Globalization can be defined as the many economic, political, technological and social process, innovating and changes that are making the world more connected.
The level of inter dependence means that decisions that are made in one remote part of the world can have huge consequences in another, un related, far removed part of the world.
Youths are very adaptable to the changes globalization brings and they also are vulnerable to some of its negative consequences that is, young people can be both victims of globalization and key agents for change.
Some of the positive changes globalization brings about are improved telecommunications and enhanced information dissemination.
The processes of globalization can make education more accessible to the privileged.
The education and the rich can purchased the technology and they benefit from such things as the internet.
This means the gains of globalization flow to the already privileged, while the burdens of globalization are carried by the disadvantaged.
In these kind of situation the rural youth position becomes more weakened than before.
Another effect of globalization is that it brings about a reduction in cultural diversity and it sometimes gives a negative portrayal of rural life and culture.
Globalization also champions the values of consumerism, so that the youths when their needs cannot be met, become discouraged or discontented.
The effect of globalization has been to fast track international competition and increase the need for rural youth to develop more productive and higher value adding means of competing.
Knowledge, education and training have become more important in order that rural youth can participate effectively and feel part of the new global trend.
130Globalization has positive impact on youths and youths are more open to the positive impacts of globalization than the older rural inhabitant.
Youth would embrace new technologies such as computers and the internet, so they are more likely to benefit if they are given the opportunities and the avenue to do so.
Also their thoughts and mind sots have been shaped by exposure to television and film so youth are potentially more adaptable and able to cope with the changes globalization can bring.
It is good for countries to recognize the challenges globalization presents so that they can take advantage of the opportunities but minimize the social cost.
3.2 RESTRUCTURING POLICIES ON RURAL YOUTH Most developing countries economies are dependent on agriculture and these accounts for one third of the export earnings of almost 50 developing countries.
Among these 50 countries, agriculture accounts for over half of the export earnings of 40 countries.
If the developing countries collectively could sustainable produce enough agricultural products to meet their own needs and the excess production they export to trading partners, the result would be a robust rural industry and improved employment opportunities.
A vehicle for overcoming rural poverty is the transformation of agriculture.
The major obstacle is how agriculture can provide employment and higher incomes for people as well as meet growing demands for food at steady food all these must be achieved in an environmental friendly way.
It must also provide raw materials to keep factories working at optimum capacity and for export to earn the foreign exchange that is required to finance the importation of capital goods that would stimulate growth in agricultural productivity.
To achieve this, the following condition must be put in place.
1311.
Removal Social Barriers to Rural Development.
When agriculture is transformed it can reduce poverty but these are achieved if programme that promote social changes will overcome social barriers that are present in the rural societies today.
Rural youths need access to land and to credit.
All people in positions of authority should champion policies that is directed at enabling reasonable fairness in the distribution of land and in encouraging micro – finance to entrepreneurial youth.
Developing countries particularly have to maximize their people’s ability to choose what they want and give them opportunities that would encourage rural development and youth employment.
It is also necessary that the liberty to express themselves and act are encouraged in order to ensure greater results.
The government should also encourage the press to be free to play their roles in the society.
2.
Access to Market The ease of getting to the market and liberalization of trade have increased the ability of rural people to escape the held of poverty because they can now easily change from the normal agricultural products they are accustomed to other more lucrative agricultural products, these stimulates markets trade and value added to industries.
They are some negative policy barriers that increase rural poverty and under development, one major policy barrier is the huge agricultural subsidies developed countries that provide these market distorting supports are denied the gains from competitively priced food and agricultural products while tax payers are forced to subsidize the high cost of the usually at environmentally damaging production.
Barriers to agricultural imports also are still high in 132many developing countries, creating obstacles to trade and putting the burrstone their own consumers.
The international monetary fund (IMF) calculated the Multi – Fabre Agreement (MFA) quotas as being responsible for 19million jobs for low skilled workers being depleted in developing countries and 27 million jobs if tariffs are added.
These simply mean that jobs are saved in developed countries while jobs are lost in developing countries.
“For every job saved in developed countries, 35 jobs are lost in developing countries”.
3.
Greater Productivity When our youths are better educated and trained, these will enable the youth to get access to better and befitting jobs.
Skills would now match the new job opportunities that have been created leading to greater productivity.
The governments of respective countries must invest in research that will adapt technology to their local conditions and must put in place price policies that will encourage the adoption of appropriate technology.
The aid donors must also help provide the necessary technology and know how needed in the countries they operate 3.3 REVIVING RURAL AGRICULTURE THROUGH AIDS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE The rural areas of the world produce a greater proportion of the food consumed in the world and also a larger part of the bio diversity that keeps the health of our planet is located in the rural areas.
The majority of the people who work in the rural areas depend on agriculture for survival.
Even in the poorest of countries agriculture is the largest sector of their economy and there would be no sustained growth unless agriculture is developed.
When there is a focus on rural development, these do not mean other sectors of the economy should be 133neglected, that is not the case but rather rural development would help to speed up economic growth.

Third Edition Geneva 2003.
Even with the heightened need to turn around agriculture, there is still a great agricultural inactivity and reduction in aid and technical assistance to agriculture.
There has been falling donor assistance to agriculture programs.
Aid to agriculture has dropped by two thirds.
In the early 1980s aid to the developing countries reached its peak and then dropped from17% to 8% in the late 1990s.
Below are some of the vital factors necessary in transforming the rural areas.
Rural Reform I’S Incentives - prices and food crops that encourage production and marketing Investment - Accessible health and education services Infrastructure - Access road, irrigation, systems, schools, clinics, electrification telecommunication Innovation - Adaptive research on new crops and varieties.
Industry - Labor intensive rural industries that would generate income and create employment 134Institutions - Good institutions that could organize and communicate with farmers, provide credit and extension services, and control ownership and allocation of land.
3.6 HOW TO REDUCE YOUTH RURAL – URBAN MIGRATION Below are some of the reasons youth leaves for the urban areas.
!
Urban areas are growing at a fast rate and becoming more and more attractive to the youths !
Rural youth do not see any future for themselves in the rural areas as a result of few jobs and opportunities !
The globalize media have portrayed the urban areas as the place where things are happening and the rural areas as a place to avoid !
The rural areas lack the basic infrastructure and social amenities that the youths need !
Because of some political, social and economic reasons, the urban areas receive more funding from government !
There is the perception that the urban people are superior to the rural people !
Increased soil erosion, desertification from cutting down trees for fire wood, scarcity of farmland in the rural area !
There is a lot of environmental degradation in the rural areas due to the fact that most raw materials are exploited there.
In the rural Niger Delta of Nigeria as a result of oil flaring most of the rivers and land in the creaky are polluted, so people’s livelihoods have been destroyed.
!
Lack of good schools in the rural areas.
!
Nevertheless, we have seen some of the reasons that chase the youths out of the rural areas, let us now put down some measures that can be used in rural urban migration.
135!
The quality of life of the rural people should be improved by channeling more funds to rural development programmes !
The provision of more schools, hospital and other basic social amenities in the rural areas !
There should be a heightened infrastructural development in the rural areas for example in Singapore there are only 28 rural houses left in the country and they would be demolished soon and upgraded to modern standards.
!
Governments should encourage companies that are in the extractive industry to carry out their business in an environmental friendly way and they should also increase their social responsibility to the communities they operate !
Government and all stakeholders should put in place policies and initiates that would prevent environmental degradation and pollution e.g.
Reforestation, alternative fuel use, sustainable use of water !
More industries in the manufacturing, technology, and construction sector should be encouraged by governments to be located in the rural areas to create more jobs for the people.
Governments can give these companies tax incentives and other benefits, attract them.
!
Good schools and Educational Institutions should be cited in the rural areas, these would give the rural youth an opportunity to get well trained and prepared for the global labor market !
The media should stop portraying the rural areas as the dark areas of the world but they should concentrate on the positive developments and opportunities that are found there.
!
All countries should embrace the Singapore approach of making all rural areas a thing of the past by urbanizing the whole country.
136SELF ASSESSED EXERCISE (SAE) Briefly discuss the effects of globalization on the rural youth.
4.0 CONCLUSION Globalization we said is the many economic, political, technological and social processes, innovations and changes that is making the world smaller.
Youths are vulnerable and adaptable to the changes globalization brings with it.
A major catalyst of globalization is the emergence of the computers and the internet, if these communication tools can be used positively by the rural youths it would make them as competitive as the youths in the urban areas.
There is still great rural poverty in developing countries and the youths are also affected by the poverty.
Agriculture can help in transforming rural poverty if pursued vigorously by governments.
5.0 SUMMARY Globalization simply put means more inter dependent world.
Decisions taking in Europe for example 1.
Could affect a poor farmer in Africa.
2.
Globalization brings with it positive and negative changes that impact that rural youths.
3.
The bulk of the youths are found in developing countries, so government of these regions should restructure their policies to favor the youths.
4.
A great proportion of the rural people, youths inclusive depend on agriculture for survival so agriculture must be revitalized to improve the level of agriculture productivity.
All stakeholders should be involved e.g.
Governments, Aid agencies, and Donor groups’ e.t.c.
1375.
Nations must show equal commitments to the rural areas to prevent rural urban migration of youths.

In these days of rapid globalization, the rural youth are not so much interested in the normal subsistence farming; it is viewed as ‘dirty work’.
A large number of the youths in the rural area are abandoning their homes and migrating to the urban cities where they believe they can make a living.
The rural youth tends to be poorly educated as a result of educational preferences given to the urban centers.
Even when good teachers are deployed to the rural areas, the teachers see to it that they are reposted back to the urban centre.
Poor quality education is high in rural area.
In this chapter, we shall discuss the role education can play in making the rural youths productive and economically independent.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you would be able to: !
See the importance of educating the rural youth !
Recognize how education can help in overcoming the gender imbalance in the training of younger women !
Understand the need for investing more in yourself as the leaders of tomorrow 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 UPGRADING RURAL EDUCATION 141Education can be said to be process of learning and training, usually done in schools, colleges and universities.
This education is usually development to the recipients through theory and practice.
Education of the youth is a fundamental human right and it should be guaranteed.
Every child in the world is entitled to at least a basic education by the government these world help to promote youth employment.
In Nigeria for example the ministry of education has a programme for the children of nomads, where education is taken to them in their remote areas.
Also in some states as a way to encourage the children of the poor to staying, the governments had to introduce a school feeding program, where the children are feed lunch in school.
The 2004 world development reports concentrate on how education service to the poor can be improved upon.
Educational service providers would be more accountable when their clients have choices.
Most rural people prefer that their children should be enrolled in private schools that they do not have the financial muscle to do so.
Parents prefer the private schools because they could easily influence the educational quality of service and performance of the teachers where as in the government schools; the teachers are less accountable to the parents because they are usually not paid for performance.
The government of developing countries should introduce voucher systems for the poor, this will broaden the choices the rural people have and create incentives for government schools to update their services to the rural poor.
Unemployment would be curbed because the young graduates would now choose to remain in their villages and get a livelihood by establishing or working for private village schools.
Another means of revitalizing rural education is by giving qualified teachers monetary incentives and other allowances if they accept rural postings.
The National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) Scheme in Nigeria 142where graduates must serve their father land for a year can be used to post qualified teachers to the villagers to help boost rural education and all Corp members that accept such posting should be well catered for.
3.1.1 TARGET RURAL EDUCATION Not all kinds of education are totally beneficiary to the rural youth, so education must be appropriate to meet the needs of the rural youth.
Education is said to be the answer to youth employment, an ILO study showed that there is not always a correlated between education and employment levels.
A case is Mexico and Columbia they have a illiteracy rate of around 3 to 4 percent, but in Mexico the youth unemployment is 4.4 percent, while in Columbia 36 percent of the youths are unemployed.
Education in the long run should create rural youth empowerment and employment that pays well.
Government can help to address the issues of inappropriate, education by doing the following.
a.
Putting in place educational curricular that is relevant to the labour market demands and aspirations of the rural youth.
b.
Rural youth should be given the opportunities to be productive farmer entrepreneurs.
c. All forms of training targeted at the rural youth must emphasize problem solving, communication and team work.
d. Rural schools to be more practical in nature, for example subjects like agriculture should be taught with visits to the school gardens.
e. Vocational training centers should train the rural youths on flexible skills that address the realities of the work place.
f. The current vocational training focus a lot on how to get manual skills for conventional vocations this should be made more flexible, so that vocational training would be based on the labour demand and supply of the economy.
143Generally, there is no gain saying that education is core for the development of youth in the rural areas and the rural youth must learn by doing and they need to implement what they learnt to be productive members of the community.
3.2 THE SUCCESS CASE RELICATION (SCR) METHOD The Success Case Replication (SCR) method is a method of employment training that has been found to be very cost effective and successful in training the rural people to create good businesses that is very rewarding financially.
The success case replication method is an informal apprenticeship and peer training models that engage the services of successful owners of businesses or successful farmers at the village level to educate and train their fellow villagers who are interested in a better life.
The kind of training that is imparted here s a hands on training that suits the trainees abilities so formal is also influenced by the availability of raw material and market demand for the products that would be produced by the trainees.
For every product produced there must be a matching demand.
The SCR method of employment training also has it disadvantages as it can only be practiced successfully on a small scale when the market is still undo-supplied by the products of the trainees, but as soon as the market becomes saturated, the products no longer move and finished goods inventory builds up.
The SCR method is not a straight forward method to implement it involves a lot of complexity and planning.
However, when the SCR method is effectively adopted it helps the rural poor to cheaply upgrade their skills and develop their own on farm and off farm businesses that would guarantee themselves employment.
The rural youth must embrace self employment because it is the only way a greater majority of them can be delivered from the strangle hold of 144poverty.
The SCR method is suited for training the rural youths who are favourable disposed to entrepreneurial activities.
The SCR method is not only limited to the training of youths but it can be successful in training of the youths.
This method has also been proved to be a cost effective and successful means of training large numbers of unemployed youth.
An example is in the Philippines where an organic rice variety, masipag was developed in order to bring in more profit for the rice farmer by reducing the application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers therefore lowering the cost of production.
The training farms where this was done did not have enough funds to train many farmers so they used the SCR method so that farmers were able to train their neighbors, who subsequently want trained other farmers.
3.3 EDUCATED THE GIRL CHILD In recent time the number of educated children has been increasing, but the growth has seemed to favor the boys more than the girls.
It estimated that out of the almost 1 billion illiterates in the world, two thirds are women.
In 1990 out of 130 million children that had no access to primary education 81 million were girls.
The failure to draw girls into school and keep them there has a great impact of their future child bearing and mothering roles.
In 1991 a World Conference on Education for all was conveyed in Jomtein, Thailand by UNICEF, United Nations Development Programmed (UNDP), United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World but the aim of the conference was to draw attention to the gender gap” in educational opportunity, and its impact for human development.
The World Bank stated that a country with more educated girls and women is not only healthier, but wealthier.
Educating girls is very paramount in bringing about development.
When young women drop out of school early poverty increases.
The 145more a girl is educated the more enlightened she would become to prevent her from being widely taking advantage of by the society.
In many poor developing countries girls are withdrawn from school early so that she could form part of the labor on farms, because women and girls are very important contributors in the production of food.
In some part of the developing world they believe if a girl reaches a certain age she would be married out on time, her ability to continue with her education would ret in the hands of her husband.
This normally arises because of the fear that higher institutions are citadels of freedom and limited morality.
Also in the Asia pacific region, values of family honor and female modesty rivals educational ambition, meaning that only parents that can send their girls to segregated schools, with door to door school buses can educated their daughters and still be respect in the community.
Gender gaps in education over the years have been closing when compared to the inequality still prevent in the labour market.
The inequality of employment and wages disparity that women suffer in either formal economy would likely increase the number of women in the informal economic; the effect of these is women engaging in dangerous or inadequately paid employment.
Here are some current facts on gender focus to see where we are at: !
More boys would attend secondary schools in many nations than girls and only the girls from wealthy homes would proceed to college.
!
Girls and younger women that are illiterates have global percentage of 18% and 31% of them reside in low income nations.
!
That adult women that are over 15 years old are less educated than adults in general.
146!
The literacy rates of youth shows that the male youth is more educated than the female youth Category Literacy rates Literacy rates in Literacy rates in developing least developing in low human countries countries (LDC) development countries Adult (over 15 74.5% 53.3% 55% years of age) Female (over 15 67.1% 43.8% 44.4% years of age) Youth ( age 15 – 84.5% 65.9% 71.7% 24) Female youth (age 80.9% 59.3% 63.9% 15-24) Source: UNDP Human Development Reports, Human Development Indicators 2003 To change these trends of backwardness in girl child education, government should do the following; - Encourage parents to keep their daughters in school through incentives like free schooling, establishment of special schools for girls, scholarships e.t.c.
- Discouragement of parents from marrying out their daughters at early ages.
- Most of the discriminatory issues against women are poverty driven governments should empower their rural people and country as a whole.
3.4 EDUCATING YOUTHS IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES 147States of the earth technologies are speedily circulating the world with the help of the forces of globalization, when this technologies are harnessed appropriately, it can be vehicles for creating new employment opportunities.
A great number of rural youth do not have access to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) due to poverty and cultural differences.
Governments can change this trend by providing free ICT training in schools or selected local training centers.
These training centers would provide services that would equip the youth for entrepreneurship and leadership.
Another problem usually encountered in the rural areas, particularly in the low income nations is the lack of electricity, telephone lines and the existence of language barriers.
In this era of globalization, the rural youth must be able to participate in the “Information Revolution”, and so governments must see that all bottlenecks to rural technological developments are overcome.
For example in Lagos, the Jhai Foundation Remote IT Villages was set up to give the locals access to information on market prices and export opportunities, so they designed a computer that can be powered by car battering, with the ability to survive the climate and with a software in the law language.
As a guideline on the education of youths in new technologies we must make sure these statements below are adhered to: - Any technology initiative channeled for the rural youth must have a useful place in their lives.
- Any technology that is seen as too risk would not attract the rural youth.
- Every technological programme for the youths must be created to solve a particular problem the rural youths are currently experiencing.
148- The rural youth need to be carried along as a partner in rural development in order for them to embrace all new technological advancement programs.
- The end product of any introduction of new technological trainings must be to create new jobs for the rural youth.
SELF ASSESSED EXERCISE (SAE) How can you as a policy maker in rural education put in place initiatives that would revitalize youth rural education.
4.0.
CONCLUSION Education is very important to the rural youth.
Education is a process of mind building.
Education is also a process of learning and training that is normally done in schools, colleges and universities.
Education should be targeted at the rural youth to expose them to opportunities that would bring them out of the ignorance and poverty they ought not to be in.
however not all forms of education is beneficial to the rural youth, only education and trainings that would address issues of unemployment and self reliance should be encouraged.
The Success Case Replication (SCR) method is an employment training method that is cost effective and good for training the rural youth to create there own business.
The girl child must be encourage to stay in school, because education would make her aware of her rights in the society and the potentials she to has, as a leader of tomorrow.
5.0.
SUMMARY - Education is a process of learning and training.
- The rural youth must be denied access to education as a result of the prevailing poverty in the rural areas of the low income nations.
149- Government should initiates educational programmes that are subsidize to train the rural youth in appropriate kills and new technologies.
- All educational programmes must be gender driven to correct the imbalance that already exist between boys and girls child education.
- The CSR is a method used to train the rural people (youths) in employment creating activities that would make them self-reliant.
- Education is the bed rock of youth empowerment and in developing in the rural areas of the globe.

INTRODUCTION In the last unit we emphasized the importance of education to the rural youth emancipation.
Education simply put is a process of learning and training that is usually done in schools, colleges and universities.
The youth urban and rural are a very important segment of our society because of their enormous numbers.
The youth population is predicted to reach 1.5 billion in 2035 and most of this population would be in Sub – Saharan African (SSA) and South East Asia.
The FAO estimated that 70 percent of youth that reside in the rural areas are also based in Sub – Saharan Africa (SSA) and South East Asia.
The so much talk about youth empowerment by politicians and policy makers over the years has not yielded favorable results because we still have a colossal employment problem among youths particularly in the developing world.
In line with the context of this module, our focus would be on how we can create employment opportunities for the rural youth.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you would be able to !
See the need to improve employment prospects for rural youth through investment in agricultural extension services !
Recognize the future labor demands in rural areas !
Explain with real life success stories of how youth have been trained employment.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 HISTORY OF EXTENSION PROGRAMME 153Extension was first used in education over 100 years to describe the mode of spreading knowledge from the University of Cambridge in England to the great number of people outside it walls.
The earliest proponent of extension methods was Richard Moulton, a lecturer in Literature.
He and his colleagues moved from town to town teaching adults, who were unable to leave their jobs in factories and offices with formal university education.
This early extension initiative was not focused on agriculture but it had four basic concepts that modern agricultural extension programmes are built on, these are: � The knowledge to be extended.
� The people to be reached.
� A centralized extension organization.
� The extension agent or contact man.
The name Agricultural Extension was first coined in the USA and until 1914 all lecturers to the general public by the university was called extension lecturer.
But after the passing of the Smith Liver Act in the same year the term was now used for non-formal education for the farming community.
Agricultural extension extended its reach to Britain in the late 1920s, when it was realized that farmers were spending too much time meeting their subsistence need; if they could increase their efficiency, more labour and land could be spared for the production of surpluses for the market.
1543.1.1 FOCUSING AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROGRAMS TOWARDS YOUTHS In module 2, we talked on the impact of Extension on rural development but our focus was on the rural women.
In this section we would go a little further by discussion towards the rural youth.
The population of the world as we have said earlier is growing rapidly, because of reasons like high birth rates and reduced mortality, these pressure on the land has ceased traditional systems of land use and the conservation of the fertility of the land to be destroyed.
The most difficult problem we are facing today is how to provide jobs fir these large populations of people.
A large portion of these populations are rural youths who live in the developing countries.
A more productive and intensive use of land can help to solve the problem.
To achieve this, a huge number of youth farmers must be given access to agricultural education, the necessary production supplies and markets.
All trainings and assistance given to farmers to help them upgrade their methods of production and marketing is called Agriculture Extension.
Agricultural Extension must be given priority to improve employment opportunities for rural youth.
These extension services that focus on the young should have the following attributes.
� Focus young farmers.
� Encourage parents to give school leavers land; � Create agricultural credit schemes that would assist young people buy livestock, equipment and other productive assets of their own; � Encourage food production in order to increase food security for commodities.
� Teach effective and appropriate ideas and methods in agriculture, � Engage as many school leavers as possible, with in the job training.
155� Create incentives that would encourage some young workers to become Para professional extension agents.
� Create access to leadership and organizational skills training.
A study of agricultural extension services in a poor area of Brazil showed the acceptance of youth to innovation for improved productivity when extension worker were allowed to customized their programme to meet the pressing needs of farmers, greater results was gotten.
An example of a country that has targeted extension programs and access to credit towards youth is Vietnam.
In Vietnam, young enterprises have been helped to establish new successful businesses, below are some example.
1.
A couple, both aged 21 built their own house themselves with the profits from their third coffee crop.
The leased land from the government and on established loan from their district people’s credit fund corporative and technical advice and monitoring from both their local youth federation and from the coffee factory in their district.
2.
A couple both aged 18 and 20 in rural Plan Their in Vietnam constructed their piggery with loans from a credit cooperative and the local farmers union.
Even though they had a small parcel of land, the piggery allowed them to make a living.
Government extension services and their local youth group provided them with technical advice on the current methods of rearing pigs.
3.2 CHARACTERISTIC OF RURAL YOUTH LIVELIHOOD Youths in the rural area tend to be underemployed as a result of their involvement in low productivity, predominantly household based activities.
Almost one quarter of the rural youths live in household here income per head is estimated to be less than one dollar a day so 156governments and other state holders must try to focus on how to improve the livelihood of most disadvantaged youth.
It is imperative that young people in rural areas are prepare for productive lives in both rural and urban environments, in many parts of Asia and Africa the remittance sent home from rural to whom migration is gradually overtaken the income from Agriculture.
It is then safe to say that policy makers should now stop viewing migration as a negative trend but it should now be viewed as socially and economically desirable.
As we know from previous discussions that rural youth have been greatly involved in civil wars and other forms of civil conflict in a growing number of countries, which constitutes a major threat to long- term development abilities of these countries.
Traditional buffers are breaking down and rural youth aspirations form better lives are increasing, especially with access to state of art information technologies.
There is also a huge health challenge that rural youth are exposing to, health challenges like malnutrition, malaria, and HIV Aids.
Government and all relevant parties that are involved with the rural youth must look into the direct health risk posed by HIV Aids.
Generally HIV prevalence among rural teenagers is very low except for a small numbers of cases in some very high prevalence countries.
The cases of HIV infection among rural youths in very big countries of sub-Sahara Africa such as Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo and all of Asia ands central south America is less than one percent.
The huge impact of the AIDS scourge on the economy of rural youth is the increasing number of children and youth whose parents have died from AIDS and its opportunistic infections.
Data in the number of rural youth engaged in both agricultural and non-agricultural activities are few but the number of rural youth involved in wages and entrepreneurial activities in both these core areas of activity 157varies considerably across countries.
Youth in the rural areas do not normally constitute an organized and vocal block with the economic and social process to lobby on their own behalf.
3.3 IMPROVING THE LIVES OF RURAL YOUTH It is widely speculated that youth development is at the back burner of the development agenda in most countries must policies are always termed “Women and youth development programs”, they are not youth specific.
The 2007 world development report concludes that where they are youth policies they normally fail.
Most youth policies in developing countries have been faulted for being biased towards non-poor, males living in urban areas.
As a result of the non availability of youth support services in many countries, they not benefit the poor youth but the non- poor youth.
An example is in the sub-Saharan Africa where secondary school leavers have gradually taken over rural training centers originally meant for primary school leavers and secondary school drop outs.
The available National Youth service schemes only enroll university graduates and occasional secondary school leavers, most of who may not be poor from rural areas.
A great number of these schemes have been closes because of the high cost of financing these schemes.
There is a standard list of policy interventions to improve the lives of rural youth that are enumerate in policy debates as well as in policy documents and the papers of academics.
The United Nation World Programme for youth in 1995 identified the following 10 “fields of action”; Education, employment, hunger, poverty, health, environment, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency, and leisure.
Any good youth live betterment programme must separate interventions that improve capabilities and resources (e.g.
education, health, life skill, training and financial service/credit) from those that 158structure opportunities (e.g.
individual and group income generation activities, promoting access to markets, land, infrastructure and other services) the protection and promotion of rights and the development of youth institution.
Awareness should also be heightened on the AIDS epidemic and how different kinds of intervention for youths can about it.
It is believed that when the lives of youth are improved it may reduce the incidence of high risk ‘transactions’ sexual relationships, which is normally brought about by material gain (the sex- for- food, food – fir-sex syndrome).
3.4 SOME SUCCESS STORIES ON RURAL YOUTH EMPOWERMENT Since most rural youth are vulnerable to poverty, hunger and food security, it is important that job opportunities would help them to gain food security.
� Using ICT To create job A project in India, christened ‘Narrowing the digital divide’ has focused on improving employment opportunities for youth by given them access to and training in ICT.
The program focuses on rural youth in remote areas.
The program is divided into two parts, first to train rural youth in ICT skills, with emphasis laid on training in small enterprise development, and secondly to develop solar powered broadband wireless ICT centers in remote rural areas where access to conventional infrastructure is not obtainable.
Many graduates of these projects have found employment using these skills in various organizations while some of them have funded their own business, such as cyber faces and business centers.
� Mobilizing rural youth for Agricultural job The Thomas Sankker club, a rural youth organization in their land has had a breakthrough in training and bringing together in 159employment creation and income earning opportunities in the Thomas sub-district.
This was their approaches � Make sure they had community support and every one was involved in participation.
Community members would organize group activities by making available venues for meetings and acting as trainers so youth groups would have to partner with the community.
� It was learn by doing and share knowledge approach.
‘Learning by doing’ is a good means of training and sharing of knowledge and skills this enable all group members to gain.
Teaching Business Skills and Entrepreneurship The international labour organization start and improve your business (SIYB) programme is a system of training packages and supporting materials for small scale entrepreneurs.
This programme focuses on providing and skills that would help in overcoming barriers to starting a business.
This programme started in 1991 and till about 2002 it has benefited around 1 so, entrepreneur and has created about 125,000 new jobs.
Let us see a success story from Asia.
In Sri Lanka, youth, Mr. Wejennyaks, adopted the business star up training to identify the most suitable business to start.
When he identified the business (noodle Making), the business skills he got from the training help him in keeping the business afloat.
He now employs 5 people and won the sell live WIRE ‘best new business’ award.
Learning From Elders “One village One Product” Thailand ‘one tanbon (district) program is similar to Japan’s one village, one product’ that begun in rural Japan in 1979.
The program was directed toward rural development by encouraging the production of traditional local products in rural communities.
These program has three 160dimension local yet global, self reliance and creativity and human resources development.
The local communities have the power to make decisions as they get new skills and even the freedom to design and market their products.
These programs started in Thailand in 1999, and it has created new jobs for rural people and has improved their skills and income.
The lunching of a website for the project has allowed sales of their products to go world wide, thus bringing the benefits of internet technology to rural youth.
Telefood Telefood is a campaign by the food and agriculture organization (FAO), to directly increase food.
Security and reduce hunger by sponsoring the financing of small scale projects that improve food productions for families and communities.
In the Philippines women and youth were trained by telefood funding in organic, bio-intensive farming for a number and youth increase a crop production by using less fertilizer and less pesticide.
The farm product is now for food but the excess is sold by the participants to get cash.
4.0 CONCLUSION The population of youths in the rural area is predicted to reach 1.5 billion in 2035 and the bulk of these youths would be located in sub- Sahara Africa and south East Asia.
A great number of these youths would be based in the rural areas, so there is a need to implement developmental programme that would create livelihood for these youths.
Agricultural extension must be given top attention to create employment opportunities for rural youth.
161 5.0 SUMMARY � All training given to farmers to help them improve their method of production and marketing is called agricultural extension.
� Agricultural extension should be targeted towards rural youths to help them improve employment opportunities.
� Remittances sent home by youths from rural-urban migration has surpassed the income youths get from Agriculture, so stakeholder should now see that rural urban when migration has a positive side.
� Rural youth development initiatives have started to receive heightened attention in the developing nations of the world and Africa.

At the heart of every women and youth rural development programme is to make the women and youth self reliant.
A way of going this by encouraging them to start their own small scale business.
In these units we shall discuss the small scale business and they can be financed.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying these units you would be able to � Define a small scale business � Know the characteristics of a small scale business.
� Know the reason why small business may fail � Finance your small scale business.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES The committee for Economic Development {CED}, USA, Considered a business to be small when at least two of the following factors are present: a.

The questions they must answer are: - Do I have the basic experience require to run my own business - Is there accommodation for my kind of business in my chosen community of operation - Can I get the funds required to keep my business alive through the first year at least - What type of business ownership, (sole owner, partnership, limited liability company), do I go into 167- Am I willing to work long hours and days to see that the business really succeeds - Do I have the leadership qualities to motivate my employee?
3.4 TYPES OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP A sole proprietorship is an organization in which there is a single owner.
It is a one man business.
This is the earliest form of business ownership.
This kind of business is well spread in the rural areas.
Examples of sole proprietorships are small bookshops, petty traders, electricians, mechanic workshops, business centres e.t.c.
