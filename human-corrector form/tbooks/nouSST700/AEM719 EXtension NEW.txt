Extension methods of teaching guide the learning process so that the farmer learns more and better.
Techniques adopted in the conduct of extension work emphasizes the practice of extension as that of extending knowledge to farm families.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to; !
Discuss clearly the meaning of extension methods and education.
!
Identify extension methods !
Write briefly on agricultural transformation through extension methods.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept of Extension methods used in effecting Agricultural Transformation.
Extension education is seen as an informal out of school system of education designed to help rural people to satisfy their needs, interests and desires.
It is a system of education which involves adult learners.
Obibuaku (1983) posits that extension work is considered as an aspect of adult education which differs from formal or classroom education in that prepares its clientele to tackle the problems of today and helps them to live here and now.
Extension education assists farmers in effectively utilizing the resources available to them in solving their current farm and home problems.
By offering farmers educational and material services, using effective extension methods, the extension service stimulates them to make such changes in their farm operations as will result in more efficient 10 The extension methods employed by the extension workers during the extension development programme directly affect the effectiveness of their effort.
It will be counter- productive if the extension worker uses or adopts the same methods in teaching youth in dealing with adults.
This is because adult learners differ from the youth in that adult are more experienced , able to learn different things and more interested in the immediate usefulness of knowledge gained.
Therefore, the extension worker should be careful and selective about the methods he uses.
Extension work requires many methods and tools of teaching.
People are influenced to make changes in behaviour in proportion to the degree of their contact with several different methods.
A good extension worker must not only have in his command a variety of teaching methods, but must know also where to use them, when to use them and how to use to achieve best results.
The teaching methods used by the extension worker vary according to the farmers circumstances, consequently, the use of a variety of teaching methods is imperative.
Extension teaching methods according to Obibuaku (1983) are devices used to create situations in which new information can pass freely between the extension worker and the function of the extension worker to use the extension methods which provides opportunities for rural people to learn and which stimulate mental and physical activities among the people.
For extension workers to be successful, they must be proficient in technical knowledge and educatioinal process and attitude towards rural people.
Four conditions are necessary for effective use of teaching methods.
These include the learning situation, the learning objectives, the learning experiences and the use of a variety of teaching methods.
The learning situation comprises the extension worker who has clear objectives, knows the subject matter to be taught and is able to communicate freely with the 11 farmers.
The learning situation includes the people who are interested in the learning.
The learning situation should be free from outside distraction, equipment used in teaching should be suitable to the subject matter and should be available when required.
The objective must contain four basic elements- people to be taught, behaviour changes to be made, subject matter to be taught, and life situation which in which action is to take place.
A learning experience ( a mental or physical reactions one makes in a learning situation through seeing, hearing or performing activities during a learning process).
The final condition is that provision should be made for the opportunity to use a variety of extension methods.
3.1.1 An overview of the use of Extension methods There are arrays of approaches available in extension methods.
Extension workers are often concerned about what constitutes the most appropriate methods among all the arrays of approaches.
There is however, no single rule- of-thumb that is applicable in all conditions.
The nature of the subject matter and the circumstances of the farmers such as their level of education will help to determine the type of method to be used.
A number of studies have shown the relative importance which extension staff attach to the use of extension methods.
For example, Obibuaku and Hursh (1974) studied the effects of radio, demonstrations, personal contact with extension staff, films, lectures, newsletters, pamphlets on farm practices adoption in the former East Central state of Nigeria.
The results showed that the radio and agricultural demonstrations were the means most used in reaching the farmers.
The importance of the two methods may be related to the fact that the majority of the farmers were illiterate and therefore responded more to those methods which emphasized hearing and seeing in contrast to those which emphasized reading.
12 The study also attempted to determine the effects of the various methods in helping bring about improvements on the farm.
The result indicated that extension newsletters and pamphlets were most effective in inducing literate farmers to make changes in their farm practices.
On the other hand, the radio, and extension films were least effective in persuading farmers to make changes in their farm operations.
From the study, the researcher concluded that in teaching farmers with little or no education, extension workers should be selective in the methods they use.
Very little use can be made of extension literature (newsletter, pamphlets, bulletins, circular letters etc).
However, if the farmers are literate, they could find the extension literature useful.
The radio appear to be important in making illiterate farmers aware of extension programmes.
Personal contact method appear to be more effective in getting farmers to make changes in their way of farming.
From the study, it can be seen that extension workers in Nigeria are not making adequate use of extension methods in their work.
For example, 28 out of 92 (30.43%) of the extension staff in Western Nigeria never used demonstrations in their teaching.
It is therefore necessary for all extension staff to understand the classification and usefulness of various methods.
Methods used in extension may be classified into individual contact methods, group methods and mass media methods.

This is necessary in order to maintain the increase in productive capacity.
There is pressure on soil and pasture resources as a result of large population of farmers.
Hence, there is equally great need for farmers to have opportunity to agricultural education.
Extension aims at improving the efficiency of farmers not only in meeting their subsistence needs, but production of surpluses for the market.
This calls for increased attention to be given to the needs of farmers.
Also, the spread of useful and practical information to farmers and their families on subjects relating to agriculture could be seen as a useful step to farmers’ enlightenment.
16 Various methods are employed in technology transfer.
The objective of these methods is to make the farmer learn some facts and acquire some skills, which can be put into use (adoption) for his socio- economic development.
To ensure effective learning, it is important for the village extension agent to apply the principles of extension teaching-learning process in whichever methods or combination of methods he decides to use in disseminating the agricultural information or practices.
Isiaka (2006) opines that the learning effectiveness of the methods used is dependent partly on the village extension agent, his credibility as perceived by his clients, attitude to work, technical competence, human relations, his presentation style and the communication tools at his disposal.
Many researchers agreed that no one method is effective under all situations.
The combination of appropriate methods is often recommended (Adams, 1982; Rogers; 1992).
2.0 OBJECTIVE: By the end of this unit, you should be able to � Define the term extension � List three extension methods with examples.
� State the relevance of combinations of variety of methods.
3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 EXTENSION TEACHING METHODS The process of arranging situation in such a way that learning activities are deliberately stimulated in order to achieve behavioural change is known as extension teaching.
A teaching objective is the term used to describe the end product desired.
Teachers have not taught if the learners fail to learn.
Since teaching is intended that learning should take place, it follows that the learners interest, aptitude and desire should be aroused for the behavioural change 17 anticipated.
Learners must participate actively in the process of acquiring knowledge, skill and attitudes necessary for successful occupation.
Extension teaching usually requires that several methods of presentation be employed for the most effectiveness (Benor and Harrison, 1984).
Rural people are influenced to make changes in their farms and homes and their communities in relation to the number of different times they are exposed to information through personal visits meetings, demonstrations etc of field staff are to be able to communicate with and motivate farmers to learn and help them solve their everyday problems, it is essential that they are recruited from rural areas.
A major aim of the extension teacher is to assist his clients, people or rural farmers to put into practice and subsequently desire satisfaction in extension practices they adopt.
The teacher realizes that every client cannot move up or learn at the same time, others will only move one step at a time.
The extension teacher also recognizes the fact that some persons may want to adopt those practices that require only a modest change in over all habits, while others will be making fundamental changes in their entire operation.
The individual differences of the people thus depend on their capabilities and interest.
Teaching creates an enabling environment or situation for learning to take place effectively.
Yahaya (2003) states that teaching and that learning teaching situation has five components namely – learner (farmer), subject matter, instructional materials, physical facilities and change agent.
Change agent subject matter learner Physical (farmer) Instructional material 18 facilities Fig.
1 - Schema for teaching-learning process interaction.
(Adapted from Yahaya (2003) Pg.
201) The diagram gives a summary of the interaction process in teaching and learning the farmer is the learner, and at the centre of the learning situation.
All the other components assist the farmer to, attain the desired change in behaviour.
The learner (farmer should be motivated to learn which should arise from a felt need`- for the subject matter.
The farmer in addition should have the maximum mental ability to comprehend the subject matter in order for him to solve a problem.
The change agent (the teacher) must be knowledgeable, aware of learner’s background select and use appropriate teaching methods and understand the principals of teaching and learning.
Adequacy and availability of physical facilities should facilitate learning and learning environment should be conducive.
The subject matter to be learnt must be relevant to the learner and applicable to solving practical problems confronting the farmer (the learner) The various methods used by the village extension agents in the extension system in Nigeria incorporate the basic principles of teaching-learning process.
They include personal instruction through home visits, correspondence and lectures, group methods such as video, workshops, group discussion, demonstration, field or farm visits, and mass media such as Radio, television and printed publications such as posters, instruction leaflet, calendar and hand bill.
To effectively use the above methods, non-formal education (an organized systematic teaching outside the formal system for groups 19 of people with particular needs.
Adams (1982) submitted that non- formal education involves: !
Solving particular problems and adapted to suit the local culture !
Learning depends on discussion, practical demonstration and participation by the group !
Extension work takes placed outside – classroom in villages and farms !
Extension carried out by people with no formal training in education !
Clients capability of gaining livelihood within the limits of their environment !
Clients are motivated based on the fact that their standard of living will be improved.
3.1.1 SELECTION OF METHODS.
(a) Group Contact Method: The ability of the extension worker to analyze a given situation is crucial to the success of the method.
The interest and desire must be identified within the group.
Based on the interest and desire of the group, cooperative action of the group could improve a task or project in agriculture, progress becomes faster if the groups are involved in implementation of perceived beneficial programme for implementation.
For the group to change or adopt new innovation, appropriate teaching method such as seminar, agric show etc will be required to stimulate the desire for change and provide an opportunity for the farmers to build self confidence.
The extension worker will therefore establish a rapport (reciprocal friendship) with all members of the group.
(b) Individual Contact Method: Extension worker maintains regular contact with individual farmers.
Practically, this method poses a 20 challenge to extension workers in terms of the number of individual farmers to be covered.
The farmers themselves choose some of their colleagues for the extension worker to work with.
Through these few selected farmers, innovation and change could be extended to the community.
However, the newness of the extension worker plays a role.
New and younger workers need moiré emphasis on individual contacts or personal visit.
Then as their knowledge of the local situation grows, their confidence level grows too.
(c) Mass Contact Method: The extension worker could achieve this through the use of Radio, T.V.
and print.
Radio and Television can be used to create awareness of the need for change especially short term specific objectives e.g.
(application of herbicides to crops).
The demerits of using mass media include language barrier, the farmer have no forum to give direct feedback and the audience (farmer) do not have the opportunity to be involved in the teaching process.
Selection or choice of any methods depends on the level of awareness, interest desire, conviction and action of the target audience (the rural farmers).
3.1.2 COMBINATIONS, REPETITION AND VARIETY OF METHODS.
The use of one or two methods in extension teaching repeatedly may give use to boredom thereby making teaching uninteresting and dull.
Therefore, to make teaching effective, the extension teachers need to use different approach or varieties of methods.
Though some extension workers may have favourite methods, in which they feel more confident and effective, the teaching-learning process will be more attractive and helps dispel any possible boredom.
To 21 further stimulate the learners’ interest (the farmer), the extension worker should use varieties of teaching aids in every contacts of teaching situation.
In the selection of methods there are no strict rules.
However, the prevailing situation determines the choice of method or methods to be adopted by extension worker.
This is because no one method is entirely used along and in order to get a practice accepted and adopted, several methods may be employed while other methods could be combined with ease.
Adams (1982) reported that extension workers should realize that their farmers need to hear about the practice from several sources, and need to see it in operation over a period of time, and be able to discuss sit with other farmers and the extension workers specific characteristics of the three methods are stated below: � Group contact methods better used for specific information about practice, which assist individual through desire to conviction and action.
� Individual contact methods are considered superior for conviction and action because of the face-to-face relationship of extension worker (teacher) and farmer (learner).
� Mass media methods mostly attract attention and stimulate the interest and desire of farmers for further enquiries and information.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1(a) Itemize extension teaching methods.
(b) With the aid of diagram, describe extension flow to rural farmers.
22 4.0 CONCLUSIONS.
You have learnt that agricultural extension assist farmers to raise their standard of living and learning in extension are informal (out of school) phenomenon.
The various extension teaching methods showed that the extension worker could achieve a better result with the rural farmers if he adopts wide range of methods in making farmers to adopt an innovation.
Farmers on the other hand, must be seen to actively participate in the teaching-learning process of extension services.
5.0 SUMMARY.
The unit contains the following points.
1.
The change agent (usually the extension worker) has the responsibility of ensuring that the client (the learner or farmer) has learnt and behaviour change noticeable.
2.
More often than not, combinations of variety of methods in the teaching of extension proves to be very effective than a single method.
3.
The focal point of extension is the local or rural farmers who benefits from the research results.

1.0 INTRODUCTION The primary responsibility of extension workers is education.
A substantial number of proven educational methods or techniques exist from which the extension worker may choose to set up learning situations and to maximize the transfer of information and skills to 24 young and adult learners.
Once the needs of an area or community have been identified, it is the task of extension workers to choose the teaching methods that will be most effective in achieving their educational objectives.
Hence, this unit identifies and explains various teaching methods commonly used in individual and group situations.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Define teaching methods 2.
Explain individual teaching methods 3.
Enumerate three methods used in individual techniques 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 INDIVIDUAL TECHNIQUES/METHODS Individual methods are used in extension teaching in recognition of the fact that learning is an individual process and that the personal influence of extension worker is an important factor in securing peoples` participation in extension activities.
Song and Kong (1984) reported that when an extension worker interacts on a one-to-one basis of education.
Although the approach is time consuming, its importance cannot be stressed enough.
It is through working individually with the clientele that the extension worker learns about the people of the area, how they think, what their needs are, and how they carry on their work.
Equally important is the opportunity individual contact provides for the local citizen to get to know the extension workers.
The use of this method provides the extension the opportunity to show his credibility and integrity.
These methods are widely used and have 25 been found to be highly effective when dealing with illiterate farmers in particular.
Some of these methods are discussed as follows.
3.1.1 FARM AND HOME VISITS.
It is method involves meeting individually with farmer or farm worker at the farm or home.
A farm and home visit serves a number of purposes.
1.
It establishes contact with men and women formers and with others within the farm house hold 2.
To learn what practices and problems exist on the farm 3.
To provide information and assistance.
This technique is costly in terms of time spent and the number of clients contacted, which is usually few.
In this method, the extension worker should endeavour to visit many different farms and homes, in doing this, both men and women farm managers should visit the farmers household.
The following procedure is suggested after careful planning and preparation.
Before the Visit 1.
Prepare or Obtain a community Map A map showing where each family live or works will assist the worker in planning area visits.
The map will enable the extension worker to plan the visit efficiently.
2.
Prepare and Review Visitation Record A visitation record should be maintained which should contain the date each client was visited.
When planning a follow-up visit to a client, the visitation record should be reviewed to refresh the memory.
The review will help define the exact objective to be accomplished by the visit.
26 3.
Maintain Activity Calendar The extention worker should always plan in advance and maintain a list of activities and objectives on a calendar.
:.
Conducting the Visit a) Greet the farmer and members of the family upon entering the farm or home and accept hospitality offered, according to local custom.
Spend some time talking with the clients.
b) During the visit observe the conditions and activities of the farm operation.
c) Discuss observations with the farmer.
In doing this, be tactful if it is necessary to criticize something or to suggest changes.
Suggest a return visit if the farmer wants to know more.
Follow-Up 1.
Make notes in the visitation record and record location on map 2.
Prepare any additional information promised to the client 3.
Respect the client’s privacy 3.1.2 OFFICE CALLS AND INQUIRIES The method is concerned with personal visits made by the clientele to the extension office, to seek information and assistance.
To encourage office visits, extension workers should consider the following: 1.
Places the extention office in a convenient location 2.
Keep regular office hours so clients will know when the extention worker will be available 3.
Keep the office neat, orderly, and attractive.
4.
Maintain an up-to-date bulleting board 27 5.
Make a special effort to put the visitor at ease.
3.1.3 INFORMAL CONTACTS Informal contacts are unstructured and planned meetings with clientele in an informal setting.
Such meetings provide the extension worker with an opportunity to meet clientele in an informal situation, which facilitates the establishment of a personal bond, discussion of problems, and the recommendation of solutions.
Informal contacts can take place on the street, in the market place or at local celebrations.
These meetings often take by chance and are casual in nature.
An effective extension worker is skillful in utilizing such informal teaching situations.
In India, for example, extension offices actively promote informal contact by organizing social days.
The purpose of these social days is to encourage the extension worker and administrative officer to meet the villages.
The informal environment promotes discussion of village programmes.
3.1.4 THE MODEL FARMER The model farmer method involves the identification of a farmer whose farming methods and personal attitudes are so superior that his or her operation can serve as a model for others to follow.
The purpose of selecting a model farmer is to demonstrate good farming practice by emphasizing an outstanding local example, to persuade the clientele to adopt better farming practices, and to create a learning situation.
The model farmer technique will be most effective of course, if the individual involved is well-liked and respected.
Korea has enthusiastically adopted the model farmer technique.
The model farmer is chosen by the government to promote local farmer initiative.
Once selected, the model farmer receives intensive 28 instruction aimed at fostering a pioneer spirit dedicated to benefit the community.
The model farmer receives full governmental cooperation and support.
Model farmers facilitate extention work by acting as volunteer civil extension worker 3.1.5 THE RESULT DEMONSTRATION The result demonstration teaches WHY a practice or input should be adopted by physically showing how a new or different practice compares with a commonly – used in crop production.
the purpose of using the result demonstration is to prove that the new practice is superior to the one currently being used, to persuade extention clientele to try the new practice, and to set up a long-term teaching situation.
A good example of a result demonstration would be the comparison of two wheat crops, one with an application of fertilized and one without.
In cooperation with a farmer, two demonstration plots would be laid out in a field, side-by-side.
In one, wheat would be planted using the local seed and the local cultivation practices.
Because the purpose of the project is to demonstrate the effect of using fertilizer, no fertilizer would be used.
In the second plot, wheat would also be planted, and subjected to the same practices and conditions, but fertilizer would be applied.
Both crops would be harvested at the same time.
All things being equal, the fertilized plot will produce a substantially greater yield than the unfertilized plot.
A successful demonstration can produce positive results for extention workers by creating confidence in their judgement and ability.
It is a techniques extension workers might want to use to establish themselves in the community.
A result demonstration is costly in terms of time, but if it is successful, it is an effective way to 29 promote the new practice locally, and can open the way for further interaction with the clientele.
When planning to use this method, the following suggested step may serve as a guide.
Planning the Demonstration 1. identify the problem to be solved 2. decide upon the objectives to be accomplished 3. gather complete information 4. seek the assistance of the clientele 5. develop a complete plan of work 6. select accessible demonstration plots During the Demonstration 1. ask area leaders to cooperate 2. visit the demonstration site often 3. use the demonstration site for meetings 4. keep records on both sites 5. publicize the demonstration After the Demonstration 1. evaluate the process and results of the demonstration 2. provide follow-up information and training SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Explain procedures for result demonstration.
2.
Distinguish between office calls and telephone calls.
4.0 CONCLUSION The extension worker must know the farmer and his situation well enough to be able to convince him to adopt a new practice.
Learning is an individual activity and personal contact is necessary in order to persuade a farmer to adopt a new farm practice.
Individual learning 30 depends on the ability of the extension worker to establish good rapport with them through personal contact.
5.0 SUMMARY The main points in this unit include 1.
Individual method has several techniques in which the extension worker must plan for before the visit.
2.
It is one-on-one method that gives room for greater learning opportunity by the farmer.
3.
The extension worker assist the farmer to raise his standard of living.

You will be exposed to the different group methods of extension teaching and also create the awareness that group participations are instrumental in influencing people/ farmers thinking, feeling and action on the subjects matter under discussion.
32 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to; a.
Identify different types of groups methods.
b.
List the steps to successful group meetings c. Discuss the advantages of method demonstrations d. List the merits of exhibits.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 GROUP METHOD/TECHNIQUES Group methods take into account the inclination of the individual to respond to pressures and opinions of groups in which he participates and to listen to the views of others before arriving at a decision about making changes in his farming operations.
Group method include method demonstration, field trips, general meetings, informal or group discussions, exhibits, tours, role playing and modified conference method.
Group teaching methods are more frequently used in extension work then individual teaching techniques.
By utilizing group technique, an extension worker can reach more people than is possible.
This method proves important when time and staff are limited.
Group methods are especially effective in persuading extension’s clientele to try a new idea or practice.
A group decision to try a new practice, for example, is likely to carry more weight in an area than a similar decision made by an individual.
The demonstration based methods has been, in many ways, the corner stones of extension work.
The methods fall into a grouping which could be informally called “seeing is believing”, because they include the physical demonstration of practices the extension worker wishes to promote, or the exhibition of the results of good farming practices.
Evans (1999) points out that some of the methods under group techniques include the 33 demonstration method, the field trip, result demonstration, informal discussion, modified conference methods and role playing.
3.1.1 THE METHOD DEMONSTRATION The method demonstration shows a group or class how something is done step-by-step for the purpose of teaching new techniques and practices to extention clientele.
A method demonstration cold shows how to use a tool, a new planting technique to prevent erosion, or how to cook a newly introduced vegetable.
Ideally, each individual attending the demonstration would have an opportunity to practice the new skill during the lesson or session.
Usually, however, time does not permit more than a few to participate.
The effectiveness of the demonstration depends, to a great extent, on the amount of preparation and planning.
Because the results of the demonstration can be observed and practiced, this method is very effective in persuading clientele to try something new.
Planning the Demonstration 1.
Identify the problem to be solved.
The focus of the demonstration should be on solving problem that exists locally.
The problem can be identified through the observation and knowledge of the area, by a local individual or the extension worker.
2.
Identify the skill to be taught.
Once the problem has been identified, the extention worker must decide what skill to teach and hat educational objectives he or she wishes to attain.
Hen going through the skill identification process, each proposed skill or method should be subjected to the following questions.
a) Is the skill important?
b) Can the people afford to adopt the skill?
34 c) Are there enough supplies and equipment available to permit its widespread use?
3.
Gather information about the skill and study it thoroughly.
The demonstrator who usually is the extention worker must be familiar enough with the method to break it down into teachable segments.
4.
Involve clientele in the planning and presentation of the demonstration.
By seeking the people’s advice and assistance, local interest and level of adoption will be increased.
5.
Assemble material required to conduct the demonstration 6.
Plan the presentation step-by-step 7.
Rehearse the presentation 8.
Schedule the demonstration at the most convenient time and place for clients 9.
Arrange the audience 10.
Introduce the demonstration 11.
Ask for assistance from the audience 12.
Proceed with the demonstration 13.
Encourage members of the audience to attempt the new method 14.
Summarize the importance of the skill and the steps.
15.
Evaluate the demonstration 16.
Visit those clients who indicated an interest in the demonstration 3.1.2 THE FIELD TRIP On a field trip, a group travels to another location to observe agricultural practices, projects or demonstrations not available locally.
The trip may consist of one or more stops.
The purpose of the field trip are as follows: 35 a) To provide first hand observation of practices that might be of benefit to the farmer or householder and farm worker.
b) To enable the group to interact with individuals knowledgeable about the practices.
c) To present a fresh and different learning environment for both the extension worker and the clientele.
According to Laird (1972), a field trip’s destination may be an agricu8ltural experimental station, a farm, a home, or a community organization.
It is essential that the extention worker should work with the group before hand so they knows that they are going to see, why it is important, and how much time they will have at each stop.
It is recommended that the extension worker assign a task to the group to be completed during the trip.
For example, each group member could be given a few questions relevant to the site visit to answer.
Time should be set aside for a group discussion at the end of the trip.
A successful field trip takes a great deal of time and trouble to plan.
The following steps are suggested when planning a fieldtrip.
1. identify the objective of the trip 2. set aside adequate time to plan trip 3. contact site operators to obtain permission to visit 4. secure transportation 5. draw up a tentative schedule 6. finalize a detailed schedule, and assign tasks 7. coordinate with site hosts 8. provide for the comfort of the group.
36 3.1.3 INFORMAL OR GROUP DISCUSSION Informal discussion in a small group is another type of group technique.
The neigbours get together in a certain house at a certain time period once a mouth, or perhaps once a week, to consider and communicate the common public problems.
It is also a method to get acquainted with the neigbours, to exchange farming information and ideas, and to share common problems, in order to help each other and the community.
The informal discuss is carried out at the villages monthly meeting.
This discussion group cannot have professional leadership.
The idea is that responsible villagers should get together to consider and talk about common problems.
It is most successful in its pure form of government assisted village and town work in developing countries, where the extension worker helps the community improves not only its own economic literacy levels, but also health, sanitation and family planning.
Through this type of discussion, extension workers can encourage grass roots discussion of public issues; improve the quality of the discussion.
3.1.4 MODIFIED CONFERENCE METHOD This method is a procedure in which a group of people, each of whom has had some experience in connection with the job or problem at hand, come together to discuss situations they are facing.
This method provides those attending with an opportunity for constructive thinking under the stimulus of contributions offered by other participants.
Steps in the conference procedures are: 1. define the job or problem under consideration 2. analyze the job or problem 3. select the functioning facts 4. assemble these functioning facts 37 5. evaluate the facts 6. submit any additional facts 7. have each member of the group make a decision 8. have definite working plans prepared 9. supervise the making of the plans 3.1.5 ROLE PLAYING Role playing is a simulation in which a simple, open-ended scenario is described, and participants are assigned role to act out the situation or problem.
There is no script to follow, because participants play the roles as they see fit, drawing on their down experiences.
The purpose of using this technique is to involve participants in real life situations, to stimulate thought and learning, and learning, and to encourage discussion about factors involved in the drama.
The scenario used to set up a role playing exercise may be simple, but it must be based on the local reality.
In planning this exercise, the extension worker should 1. identify a setting e.g.
football field 2. identify and assign roles describing each to the players 3.1.6 GENERAL MEETINGS General meetings include all kinds of meetings held by the extension worker except demonstration meetings.
The method of conducting the meetings may be lectures, discussions, showing of slides and motion pictures or any combination of these.
During the meeting provision should be made for use of models, charts specimens, pictures etc, to illustrate points.
Kesley and Hearne (1966) states that towards the end of the meeting, allowance should be made for questions and answers which would help clarify specific ideas.
To 38 make the meeting successful, the extension worker should enlist the help of local leaders to; 1.
Agree on the purpose of the meeting and to draw up tentative programme.
2. decide on and secure speakers.
3. arrange for social and recreational aspects of the meeting.
4. agree on the place and time of the meeting 5. select the chairman and advertise the meeting Meetings are useful in reaching a large number of people, they serve as a preparatory stage for the use of other methods.
By means of meetings, use can be made of group psychology to promote programmes.
One of the drawback of meetings is that they offer limited scope for discussion.
Where the audience is large, handling a topic may become very difficult depending on the age and educational attainments.
3.1.7 EXHIBITS Exhibits are systematic displays of specimen, models, charts, posters etc.
Their main purpose is to develop the interest of those who see them, influence their attitude, increase their knowledge and stimulate them to action.
Exhibits are considered as some of the best methods of teaching illiterates.
Exhibits have imaginative appeal, and can stimulate competitive spirit among participants.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Itemise the benefits of role playing to the farmer.
2.
State the steps to be followed in modified conference method.
39 4.0 CONCLUSION The group teaching method is very popular in extension methods.
Most extension worker have had to use this method either singly or in a combination of different methods to get information across to the rural people.
The audience, place or situation determines the best methods to adopt by extension worker.
5.0 SUMMARY The main points in this unit includes participants may ask questions, exchange ideas when extension worker presents an idea to a group.
1.
Group participation influences thinking and feeling.
2.
Discussion in groups centres on agricultural matters and not political issues.
3.
Group of people are taken on a study tour to observe the result of improved practices in actual situations.
4.
The first step in preparing demonstration is to select the right practice.

However, individual and group methods cannot reach everyone who wants and needs information.
So, mass methods such as radio, television, cinema vans and public address systems, newspaper, posters and other printed materials are used to reach large numbers of people quickly.
They are generally useful as sources of initial information to farmers and constitute methods of notifying farmers of new development and emergencies.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to !
Define mass media method 41 !
Enumerate five types of mass media methods.
!
Identify two print media type !
Differentiate between television and radio as means of mass media method.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Mass Method Mass media methods are useful in reaching a wide audience at a very fast rate.
They are important in stimulating farmers` interest in new ideas and practices.
The various method which come under mass media classification newspapers, radio, television, publications and the like.
3.1.1 NEWSPAPERS/PUBLICATIONS Newspaper provide a valuable channel for transmission of educational information where they exist and where rural people receive and read them.
An extension worker should acquire the ability to prepare informative press material for the education of farmers in his area.
News items must compete for attention with other items.
The materials should be presented in short, simple sentences.
All materials for the press should be factual, well written and intelligently planned.
When writing, use short sentences and paragraphs that are easy to read.
Note that you must catch the readers` attention in the first sentences or he may not read further.
Facts should be put down in the order of their importance and they must be accurate, brief and clear.
Advantages of Newspaper 1. they are means of giving information to a large number of people 3.
Give timely information to people.
42 Limitations 1.
Editing of newspaper may destroy the substances of news story.
2.
Some extension workers lack writing ability.
3.
The method cannot be effectively utilized by extension worker due to bureaucracy in office work.
Publications include bulletins, pamphlets, leaflets etc.
Publications reinforce other methods of influencing farmers.
These can be prepared and given to participants at meetings, or by mail.
They can be used to supplement news stories when new information is available.
Advantages of publication includes- ease of use at leisure time and kept for future reference, information they contain is usually definite and readily understood and cheaper to produce.
However, they are not suitable for teaching people with limited education.
Folders, leaflets and pamphlets may be used singly for example to exolain the advantage of testing soil.
They may be used as reminders of when to plant crops or what chemicals to use to control different insects.
They may be used in coordination with other visuals in long range campaigns.
3.1.2 Radio The radio is one of the fastest, most powerful instrument of communicating with the masses of rural people and farmers.
It reaches people of all cultural levels who understand the language of transmission.
Radio programme attempts to communicate information known to be useful to a large number of urban and rural dwellers.
An advantage of radio programme is that it can be done almost anywhere through the use of tape recorder.
Radio is useful in reporting news, such as announcement of meetings, for warning about insect outbreaks, and 43 especially as a part of campaigns.
Some of the disadvantages of radio are that broadcasting time may not always be available to extension workers and that some farm homes may lack radio sets.
In most cases, radio programmes are not designed to give great details about extension activities.
The extension worker should also take into consideration, the listening time and habits of rural dwellers when planning extension programme.
3.1.3 Television Television is another dimension to radio broadcasting.
It therefore increases the scope of methods available to the extension worker.
Television offer the people an opportunity to use two major senses-seeing and hearing in the teaching learning process.
For the extension worker, he can demonstrate as well as talk.
The viewer is not in a position to ask questions to clarify the points made in a television presentation.
For this reason, television programmes require meticulous preparation.
Every piece of equipments must be in place and the dialogue must be well thought out.
Advantages of Television 1.
Television programmes are especially fitted to handle emergency information.
2.
Reach people who cannot read.
3.
Reach people who cannot attend extension meetings.
4.
Builds interest in other extension activities.
Limitations 1.
Broadcasting facilities are not every where.
2.
Audience cannot be actively involved in the teaching process.
3.
Extension programe are not given adequate time for listeners.
44 4.
Absence of feedback from the audience to the teacher.
5.
Extension programme cannot compete with entertainment, hence, loose out.
6.
Specific local needs cannot be given adequate attention.
3.1.4 posters, cinema vans/ public address system.
Ministry of Agriculture and information provides cinema vans which in most African countries have substituted television in bringing visual entertainment and agricultural information to rural people.
A cinema van can show an agricultural film to a large audience in two or more villages each night.
The films demonstrate new techniques that the people can apply on their own farms.
The public address system can be used to make announcements and bring agricultural information to many villages in a day.
A poster is a sheet of paper or card board with an illustration and usually a few simple words.
It is designed to catch the attention of the passé by, impress on him a fact or an idea and stimulate him to support an idea, get more information or take some kind of action.
A single glance may be all a poster may get, hence, the message must be simple and clear.
Details and wordy sentences have no place.
The following few procedures will assist when designing a poster.
1.
Decides exactly who your audience is.
2.
Put down on a sheet of paper words and rough pictures that express the message clearly.
3.
Put your message into few words 4.
Cut out poster in small scale.
45 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Explain the term mass media methods.
2.
List three advantages of radio.
3.
Enumerate the limitations of newspapers and publications.
4.
List three procedures to follow in the use of posters.
4.0 CONCLUSION This unit has introduced you to different mass media methods and their strengths/weaknesses.
Radio and television appear accessible to rural people in information dissemination.
Newspapers and posters are commonly used for farmers who are literate.
5.0 SUMMARY The main points in this unit include the following.
1.
Mass media methods include radio, television, cinema van, newspapers, posters and public address system.
2. mass media methods are useful in reaching a wide audience at a fast rate.
3.
The material in newspaper should be presented in short and simple sentences.
4.
Radio is useful in reporting news, such as announcement of meetings, campaigns, warnings etc.
5.
Television offer the people an opportunity to use two major senses- seeing and hearing in the learning process.

UNIT 6 THEORIES OF MASS MEDIA CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Theories of mass media.
3.1.1 The magic Bullet theory 3.1.2 The two-step flow theory 47 3.1.3 Uses and Gratification theory 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 Reference/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Research finding has shown that the third world countries need the use of mass media to assist and accelerate the rate of technology transfer.
Through communication technologies, mass media were increasingly harnessed to reach people at the village level.
Well-designed communication campaigns usually involve broad casting village.
Campaigns for the use of mass media are normally information-intensive with messages being repeated frequently through the use of Radio or field worker demonstrations.
For an improvement to take place, it is necessary for people to change the way they make decisions, or make choices outside of their norm.
When people change their value system, the old system will change to make room for the better one.
When that happens, innovation has occurred.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit you should be able to; !
Explain and apply the mass media theory !
Briefly explain the magic bullet theory !
Discuss the use and gratification theory 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Theories of mass media A theory according to McQuail (1987) is a set of ideas of varying status or origin which explain or interpret some phenomenon.
Therefore, theories of mass media and communication attempts to explain how individuals 48 respond to media messages.
Such questions as how does the mass media affect individual farmer, agricultural public and the macrocose society is being x-rayed by these theories.
In other words, the theories provide more insight to their relevance.
As a minor of the society, the mass media not only predict the frequency of farmers adoption of innovation, it also reflect the social and cultural orientations of the entire community.
Some of the theories of mass media to be considered here are the – “magic bullet: theory, the two step flow theory, uses and gratification theory.
3.1.1 The magic bullet theory.
One of the first theories propounded or developed to explain the effect of mass media on audience is the magic bullet theory.
It is also called “Mechanistic Stimulus – Response” theory of communication.
The underlying principle of this theory is that a medium such as mass media carry messages that elicit a uniform reaction or response from a particular audience.
This means that when a mass media or (medium) is used, the intention is that large numbers of people are influenced and the message will trigger a desired response from the audience (Ifante, Rancer and Womack, 1990).
For example, if there is an announcement in Radio that all farmers of vegetable or cereals should come and purchase fertilizer at reduced price at certain destination, all farmers will turn out immediately.
Therefore, for any agricultural information or development communication, mass media brings about desirable social change.
The media are able to link those with common interests, and enable minority groups to state their case to the country, state or community.
For example, the private television stations and Government owned television stations can be an avenue through which certain information is put across to the audience.
However, McQuail (1987) identified and summarized some audience characteristics that give rise to different attitudinal response a) Personality and educational difference b) Social settings 49 c) Variation in attitudinal strength the intensity of media abroad cast d) The influence of external events 3.1.2 The Two Step Flow theory.
Katz (1960), Lazarsfield and Merton in Yahaya (2003) postulated the two- step flow theory.
The stated that ideas flow from mass media (radio or television etc) to opinion leaders before passing the information through personal channels to their subordinates or followers.
According to this theory, information first get to active information seekers, who have access to media resources because of their educational background, they influence others and are able to guide them.
Therefore for agricultural information or technology transfer to get to the target audience, this theory maintains that opinion leaders in the society must first be the receiver before passing the information through to their followers.
Currently, this theory is modified to meet the current system of information dissemination, that is, T and V system.
Benor and Harrison (1977) said that the agricultural development needs of many developing countries can be met with T and V system rather than relying on the slow two-step flow theory.
The opinion leaders otherwise known as the contact farmers facilitate extension delivery in agriculture and rural development.
Contact farmers help to spread agricultural extension recommendations and benefits of new technologies to disadvantaged rural population.
3.1.3 Uses and Gratification theory Proponents of this theory are Roberts and Bachen (1981).
The theory attempts to explain the reason people use mass media and the functions mass media and communication serves for members of audience.
The theory explains what people do with the media rather than what the media do to people.
For instance, the purpose of television as a mass medium to people is two fold-time consuming (habitual) information seekers who watch television and use it as diversion strategy, the non time consuming 50 (non-habitual) entertainment information seekers (Robin, 1984).
It could be speculated that farmers’ use of media can also follow the pattern observed by Robin (1984).
That is, habitual and non-habitual users.
Farmers who are habitual users of television for example, may not be active seekers of agricultural information from that medium whereas farmers who are non-habitual users could be active seekers of such information.
The use and gratification theory reveals that the audience rather than being passive is actually very active.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Discuss the relevance of mass media methods in extension.
4.0 CONCLUSION Since the mass media is designated to carry messages that elicit responses from a particular audience, it therefore follows that large number of people will be influenced by the message being put across to the listening public.
However, it must be noted that print media are beyond the reach of most farming community, coupled with the difficulty of its circulation.
This makes radio to be the most recognized medium of mass communication.
5.0 SUMMARY The main points from this unit are as follows: 1.
Theories of mass media and communication attempts to explain how individuals respond to media messages.
2.
The intention of using mass media is that when used, large numbers of people are influenced and the messages will trigger a desired response.
3.
Information first get to active information seekers before they influence others.
51 4.
It seeks to explain what people do with the media rather than what the media do to people(uses and gratification theory) 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT 1.

52 MODULE 2 EXTENSION AND LEARNING PROCESS Unit1 Teaching and Learning process in Extension.
Unit 2 Education in Extension UNIT 1 TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESS IN EXTENSION CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Contents 3.1 Teaching and learning process in extension 3.1.1 Transfer of learning 3.1.2 Factors affecting learning 3.1.3 Characteristics of learning and teaching and implication for Extension.
3.1.4 Extension teaching 3.1.5 Implication for extension 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor- Marked Assignment 7.0 Reference/Further Readings 53 1.0 INTRODUCTION Teaching in extension requires that learners have effective learning experiences.
The ultimate goal of learning pre-determines that learning experience must provide for the development of the ability to think.
A learning experience is the mental or physical reaction an individual makes through seeing, hearing or doing what is to be learnt through which he gains an understanding and meaning of the content.
As you read, you will soon discover that extension teaching and learning provide a suitable setting in which learners learn and reacts in relation to their needs.
1.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: � Explain the terms teaching and learning in extension � State the characteristics of learning and teaching in extension � List five ways of achieving transfer of learning � Understand factors affecting learning 2.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS IN EXTENSION Farmers are learners and are curious and ready to learn under conducive atmosphere (farm environment).
Extension workers (teachers) should take advantage of this curiosity and teach them effectively using any of the methods explained in Unit I.
Each farmer is an individual motivated and driven to learn by different situations.
The farmers can contribute to their own learning if they are assisted by extension worker to adopt new innovation and to raise their standard of living.
Teaching is the process of arranging situation that stimulate and guide learning activities towards goals that specify desired changes in the behaviour of people (Olaitan, 2003).
In 54 teaching, the attention of the learner is drawn to important things to be learned.
The objectives of teaching should therefore include people to be taught, behavioural changes expected in people, the contents and the environment.
Learning is response to teaching – situation or the process by which an individual as a result of activity experience change in behaviour.
In this case, the learner participates actively in the education he receives.
3.1.1 TRANSFER OF LEARNING Transfer of learning occurs when knowledge or an idea learned in one situation is applied in another situation.
The extension agent teaches the farmers and the farmer transfer the knowledge and skill gained on to the farm.
For example, the idea gained from demonstration plot by the farmer through the extension agent could be applied by the farmer when he goes to practice same on his farm.
Transfer of learning involves a skill, idea knowledge and attitude from one situation to another or from one farm unit to another.
The mental ability of the learner is important in transfer of learning.
Thus, the following ways are suggested through which transfer of learning could be achieved.
(i) Emphasis should be on understanding and application of ideas by farmers.
(ii) Memorization of content and learning process by the farmers ought to be discouraged (iii) Farmers should be encouraged to see similar skill, knowledge and idea in various situation (iv) Farmers should be encouraged to apply the ideas they have learnt in other situations similar to that which they know already 55 (v) Ensure and motivate farmers to individually generate new ideas by themselves rather than constantly relying on what they have been told by extension agent.
3.1.2 FACTORS AFFECTING LEARNING It is true that knowledge of the learning process is important, but this alone does not make for effective teaching in extension.
The extension agent must be able to communicate ideas, facts, attitudes and skills to his chantele in such a way that they will understand and practice same.
Effective teaching requires effective communication.
Therefore, extension agent must understand the communication process.
Various factors affect the effectiveness of learning.
The learner must react favourably to the teaching stimuli; the farmer must practice the new skills and adopt new attitudes which he did not possess before.
Learning takes place in a gradual process in which the learner must be given adequate exposure to a new set of learning environment before he could change his behaviour.
Learning varies in rate among individual farmers.
This means that all new facts to be taught should be related to the previous knowledge and should be introduced at the rate suitable to the level of the learner.
3.1.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING AND TEACHING AND IMPLICATION FOR EXTENSION.
Opportunities must be created for people top gain the abilities to meet their needs and interests to ensure their satisfaction.
There are various characteristics of learning and teaching which if understood and used by the extension worker could assist his clientele to understand the ideas he is attempting to sell to them.
Yahaya (2003) opines that the characteristics of learning and 56 teaching are a foundation for planning and executing extension outreach programme.
These characteristics are as follows: Learning: Learning is similar to growth and is continuous.
It is essential to begin where the learner is.
The new must be related to the old (Ekong, 2003).
Learning is purposeful.
Objectives to be achieved must be clear to the learner and the teacher.
The learner must make sense from the message the instructor is passing to his clientele.
Learning must be challenging and satisfying.
Learning must make use of a maximum number of senses such as seeing, hearing etc.
A combination of use of senses makes learning meaningful to learner.
Learning programme should be organized with meaningful units and must contribute to the chosen objectives.
Learning is more effective where the learner actively participates.
The content of learning must be in line with learner’s ability.
The physical and social environment affects learning.
The teacher should ensure that the general physical environment is suitable to the kind of learning taking place and to the activities selected for the learning situation.
3.1.4 EXTENSION TEACHING Teaching objective in extension is a desired end product attainable through extension teaching.
Extension teaching requires that learners have effective learning experiences.
The five major elements for which extension teaching should provide learning situations are summarized as follows: (i) An effective learning situation where learners who are properly motivated recognizes the need for learning.
The use of teaching aids ensured that learning experience is identified.
57 (ii) Extension agent (teacher) should regularly evaluate results in precise and objective manner and base future efforts on finding.
(iii) Educational changes to be accomplished in the process of extension teaching should include changes in knowledge like varieties of seed to plant, amount of fertilizer to use etc.
(iv) Extension teaching should link up new materials with what is already known.
3.1.5 IMPLICATION FOR EXTENSION.
The characteristics of teaching-learning process x-rayed above have some implications for effective extension work.
This is briefly presented as follows.
The village extension agent or the extension worker begins with the awareness of the present interest, needs or problems of the group of farmers.
Topic must be presented in a logical sequence where teaching is carried out step by step.
Extension worker must employ practical device to show how ideas and materials are related.
These ideas to be presented to the group are frequently repeated to enhance understanding on the part of the learners (farmers).
The extension worker analyses what he had attempted, what was accomplished and what was left undone.
The extent to which the people are receptive to an extension worker is a clear indicator that he has understood the people’s needs has assisted them understand their needs with the aim of motivating them to action.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 a) Explain the term transfer of learning.
b) Mention three factors affecting learning of rural farmers.
4.0 CONCLUSION 58 This unit has afforded you the opportunity to know that the pace of learning must be adjusted to the learner’s ability.
The idea must be brought to the attention of the learner repeatedly.
You also understood that the objectives to be achieved must be clear to the learner and the instructor.
5.0 SUMMARY.
1.
An extension agent is a teacher in the non-formal set up rather than the formal system.
2.
He has all the authority to teach the materials without impediment.
However, an extension agent needs high ideals to overcome the resistance offered by farmers.
3.
The extension worker must be familiar with the local farming system and appreciate the farmers’ problem as he carry out teaching learning process with the people.
4.He must be capable of giving farmers sufficient information to enable them locate farm supplies and equipment, advise them and follow up their requests.

Education should become a positive science instead of being ruled by 60 narrow and limited opinions.
Education is a social force that reflects closely the ethos of the people.
Education should equip the rural farmer skill necessary to make a living, develop in him ability to perceive appropriately and to solve life challenging problems.
Since the non-formal education is what the extention worker and the farmer uses as a forum, the farmer needs a lot of motivation and should possess intelligence to learn.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: � Define the term motivation � List three things that would motivate farmers to learn � Explain perception and principles of perception in extension � Explain non-formal education in extension 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 INTELLIGENCE IN EXTENSION EDUCATION Intelligence has been viewed differently by scholars.
Intelligence generally can be seen as the aggregate global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally and to deal effectively with his environment (Wechster, 1980).
Stoddard (1989) submits that intelligence is the ability to undertake activities that are characterized by difficulty, complexity, abstractness, economy, adaptiveness to a goal, social value, and the emergence of originals and to maintain such activities under conditions that demand a concentration of energy and a resistance to emotional force.
Thirstone in Aggarwal (2004) has suggested three broad categories of intelligence namely – abstract intelligence, mechanical intelligence and social intelligence.
For the purpose of this unit, we shall limit ourselves to social intelligence which is the ability to understand and manage men and women, boys and girls to act 61 wisely in human relations.
The extention agent therefore must possess social intelligence in order to interact with his clients for successful dissemination of extension information and to carryout extension programme of activities.
It is not enough for the extention agent to possess abstract intelligence, the social intelligence aspect enable him to dispense his duty effectively.
The farmer must also be intelligent to understand the information necessary for him to change.
High social intelligence is also found in politicians, sales people and leaders in society.
The extention agent is a leader in his own capacity and the farmer sees him as one.
3.1.1 CONCEPT/MEANING OF MOTIVATION.
Aggarwal (2004) defined motivation as an internal force which accelerates response behaviour.
Some learners learn the same subject matter or task more efficiently than others.
At any given time, learners vary in the extent to which they are willing to direct their energies to the attainment of goals, due to differences in motivation.
Motivation is the process of sustaining and regulating activity.
Motivation has four sources – Needs, drives, incentives and motives.
Motive here is an internal factor that arouses, directs and integrates a person behaviour.
3.1.2 MOTIVATION TO LEARN The learning processes are such that farmers are motivated to lern.
Farmers find it more rewarding to solve their own problems themselves than to be given the solution by someone else.
Active learners are known to be highly motivated people.
However, with high level of motivation, farmers are expected to succeed in their task of learning of success in learning does not take place at this point, farmers could be discouraged.
A situation whereby the farmers themselves discover there is a need for change, rather than 62 having the extension agents tell them will be more appropriate for effectiveness in learning.
Olajide in Isiaka (2006) reported that the Kendyan extension agents using video clips, helped a group of farmers to calculate by themselves how much more they would earn from growing hybrid maize than from growing the local maize.
The group decided which data should be included in the calculation, such as the yields, which could be expected.
Their calculation revealed that a big advantage of the hybrid maize.
The farmers’ response was that if they had known, they would have accepted this information long time ago.
Extension agents should try to teach a subject at the moment farmers realizes they will need the information.
They are then motivated to learn, and are likely to remember more than if it had been taught earlier.
3.1.3 PERCEPTION In perception, information or stimuli is received from our environment and transformed into psychological awareness (Sherman, 1973) The complex psychology of human perception cannot be completely understood by extension agents.
In any case, they should take cognizance of the fact that people interpret their surroundings differently and have different perceptions which also influences their communication behaviour.
We have earlier discussed extension methods to include the use of audio-visual media such as slides, film, video, field demonstrations etc.
The ability of the extension agent to plan and use aids more successfully in their programme will depend on their understanding of the basic principles of extension.
Ability to make better decisions about which alternative communication strategies to use in extension programme is essential.
3.1.4 GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF PERCEPTION 63 Chauhan (1978) enumerated the following as general principles of perception.
� Relativity: our perceptions are relative rather than absolute.
Although it is impossible to judge the exact eight or surface area of an object, it is however possible to tell whether it is heavier or lighter, or larger or smaller than another similar object.
When one enters a darkened room during the screening of a film, one will see only the image on the screen and the bright light from the projector.
After some minute, one will be able to see other people in the room.
In other words, the initial perception of darkness in the room is relative to the amount of light outside.
Therefore, when designing messages, it should be noted that a person’s perception of any part of the message would depend on the segment immediately preceding it.
Perception of a message ill be influenced by its surrounding.
A circle surrounded by larger circles will look smaller than a circle of the same size surrounded by small circles.
� Selectivity: Perceptions of individuals are very selective.
At any given moment, the senses are receiving stimuli from the environment – around.
Objects are seen, noises are heard and odour are smelt.
Despite its capacity to process vast amounts of information, our nervous system cannot make sense of all the stimuli available.
Hence, an individual pays attention only to a selection of these stimuli.
Several physical and psychological factors, including attitudes, influence what an individual selects or pay attention to.
In this case, communication specialist may draw the receiver is attention to those parts of the message they wish to emphasize.
For example, parts of the message to 64 accentuate repeat or diminish in order to free the receiver’s mind from excess information.
� Past Experience: This also influences – selectivity of perception.
Farmers who have worked with livestock for years will be much more aware of small differences in body shape, quality of wool or fur and general condition of the animal than a person who is not familiar working with livestock.
Adams (1982) posits that training is a way of providing an organized and structured set of experiences to influence our perceptions.
For example, the agricultural student who has received training in agronomy and botany will see a pasture as a collection of specific plants, some of which have high nutritive values and other useless weeds.
The untrained observer may see it as a patch of grass.
The extention specialist is therefore required to have greater sensitivity to detail.
Training may lead one to possess different perceptions of situations from those of untrained people.
Those around ill not have the same perception as we do unless we have similar training with them.
� Organization: Perceptions are organized.
Sensory experiences are structured in ways, which make sense to the individual.
One form of organization is into figure and ground in a fraction of a second, senses sort out visual and aural stimuli figures, which stand out from a background.
A good figure attracts attention, so a designer may wish to incorporate it in a specific part of a message.
The ‘ground’ often will determine interpretation of the ‘figure’.
Hence, it might interpret that a picture of a man with a dirty face and hands and old clothes as a lazy or very poor person.
On the other hand, it might interpret the picture as one of a hard working farmer, if it included a farm 65 yard in the background.
The moon on a cloudy and windy night provides one with an excellent example of a figure – ground illusion.
At first sight, the moon appears to be racing through the clouds across the sky, where as if watched closely, we realize that the moon is stationary and the clouds are moving (Sherman in Isiaka, 2006).
� Direction: One perceives what is expected or are ‘set’ to perceive.
An individual’s mental set influence what he selects and how he organizes and interpret it.
Set is an important perceptual concept, which can be used by the communication designer to reduce the number of alternative interpretations given to a stimulus.
For example, the writer of an extention bulletin who starts with a brief summary will ‘set’ the reader to seek the key points in it.
A caption or a heading in a slide presentation ‘sets’ the viewer to observe those points.
Similarly, a narration which accompanies a film or video, ill “set” people to perceive the important elements selectively.
The two perceptual principles of organization and set can be combined as an advance organizer when preparing teaching materials.
This is a piece of information, which serves to explain and integrate the material, which follows.
It helps to sensitize the perceivers, ‘setting’ the individual to select the information and to interpret it in the way intended by the communicator.
There is the tendency to respond to stimuli through habit, and these habitual responses must be broken if one is to perceive a new situation in a new way.
This is a common problem with extension agents usually come from more highly trained and urbanized background in which they have learned to perceive 66 agricultural conditions in a certain way.
Their clients may perceive conditions differently.
For example, they may place strong emphasis on mystical phenomena such as the phase of the moon when planting crops.
The extension agent must learn to understand these perceptions before trying to change them.
Experience has shown in India that rural people often have difficulties understanding Western style pictures, because they use quite different visual code from the religious pictures they are used to in their temples.
It should be noted that extension agents in less industrialized countries often work with illiterate farmers, and should concentrate on presentation of concrete rather than abstract information.
More still, farmers in some societies have had little or no exposure either to pictures or printed materials.
Extension agents in these situations have to use little of pictorial messages, as the farmers may not interpret their meanings in the same way.
This principle could be applied in the use of motion pictures (for example, video) in teaching farmers.
When are extension agent decides to package information on agricultural practices in video cassettes or VCD, he should do that with these principles of perception in mind.
3.1.5 NON- FORMAL EDUCATION.
Non-formal education is the type of education given to farmers out of classroom situation.
Here teachers do not lecture in a classroom.
Generally, teachers tend to teach in the same way as they were taught, there is the temptation for extension workers to do same.
For example, if extension workers are trained through lectures alone, there is the tendency to lecture farmers.
Non-formal education is designed to raise the hiring standards and productivity.
Experience 67 has shown that the best results are obtained by working with farmers in an informal set up.
Learning by farmers in non-formal education depends on discussion, practical demonstration and participation by group of farmers with the extension agent not interfering in most cases.
The rural farmers attendance is neither mandatory nor consistent and the teaching usually takes place in the villages or on the farm.
Progress by farmers in non-formal education set up also depends on the level of satisfaction and perceived motivation given by extension worker.
In teaching rural farmers in an out of classroom situation, the culture of the farmers is incorporated into the instructional process for delivery.
STUDENT ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1a) Explain the role of intelligence in extension education (b) Explain the term “motivation to learn”.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this chapter, we understand that the background of the farmer should be put into consideration before packaging information on agricultural practices in video and VCD.
We also note that perception of rural farmer is an essential factor in ensuring that research information are adopted or disseminated to other farmers in the village.
In choosing instructional methods to communicate with rural farmers, the extension agents should ensure that the audience’s skill tally with the medium used.

Delivery of efficient extension services increasingly demand field workers to demonstrate high skills in facilitation, take lead roles in group discussion and conflict management.
An extension worker is basically a communicator.
The communication skill on the part of the extension worker is the basis of all extention activity.
Communication is pivotal in rural development because it caters for the needs of humans in different dimensions.
You can cite examples of projects that involve the construction of infrastructures such as irrigation systems, or seed of improved varieties and better production techniques that were never adopted widely enough to make a significant impact.
Such projects failed on the human level: the attitudes and behaviour of the people they were setting out to help did not change sufficiently for them to integrate the innovations into their daily life and work.
Communication therefore becomes essential to enable them (rural farmers) learn new ways of improving their vocation, enterprises and institutions.
A lack of appropriate communication structures, methodologies and tools results in poor identification of farmers’ needs and priorities.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Define the term communication in extension 2.
Explain the need for communication 71 3.
Explain functions of communication 4.
Understand the strategies involved in communication 4.
Describe how communication influence change in behaviour of farmers 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 MEANING OF COMMUNICATION Different authors have attempted definition of communication with varying degrees of interpretation based on their background.
Communication deals with transmission and application of knowledge designed to bring about planned changes in the behaviour of farmers.
It is also the transferring of information from the sender to the receiver with the information being understood by the receiver.
Communication could be verbal or non-verbal.
In any case, the areas where communication is applicable include � Communication for participatory analysis of farmers problems � Communication to facilitate education and training, mainly for peasants.
� Communication to provide a flow of institutional information to improve coordination and management.
Adebayo and Adedoyin (2003), Bittner(1989) viewed communication as follows; 1.
The means of sending messages 2.
The transmission of information.
3.
A source of transmitting a message to a receiver with conscious intent to affect the latters` behaviours.
4.
The verbal interchange of thoughts or ideas.
72 5.
The process that links discontinous parts of the living world together.
6.
A process that makes common two or several what was the monopoly of one or some.
Extension service is recognized as essential mechanism for delivering information and advice as input into modern natural resource management.
According to Adebayo and Adedoyin (2003), the ultimate aim of an extension system is to effectively deliver information to end users in a comprehensible and utilizable manner.
The most common division of communication is along the lines of the number of actors involved in the communication scenario (Bittner, 1989).
Communication in this case, could be intrapersonal (involving only one person), interpersonal (private settings), group (relating to Interaction of people in small groups), organizational (occurring in large cooperative networks) and mass (dealing with public communication.)
Fraser and Restrepo-Estrada (1998) states that maintaining effective communication with the peasants who often have difficulty in articulating their views of their reality, will pave way for a collective perception within the community of the local situation and of the options for improving it.
In the view of Yahaya (2003), communication involves exchange of ideas, information and knowledge between one or more people with the aim of arriving at a meaning.
3.1.1 WHY COMUNICATION?
The inadequate results of many rural development initiatives, based on the notion of the transfer of technology and the provision of inputs, has brought recognition of the importance of the human 73 component of rural development, and of the role played by the traditions, values, and aspirations of peasants.
In the final analysis, no amount of investment or provision of technology and inputs will bring any lasting improvements in the living standards of rural people unless, they themselves, change their attitudes and behavioural patterns.
It is people that bring about development, and there can be no change for the better without their informed participation, without mobilizing their capacities and energies, and without increasing their knowledge and skills (FA0, 1979).
The essence of involving rural people in the process of their down development lies in the sharing of knowledge.
This sharing implies two way communication, rather than a one-way transfer of information.
It also implies that the exchange should be between communication equals.
On the one hand, technical and specialists learn about people’s need and capacities, about their techniques of production, and about the peasants’ reality as it is seen and lived by the peasants themselves.
It follows that the outcome of useful sharing of knowledge is not so much the replacement of traditional techniques by modern ones, as a merging of modern and traditional systems to produce a more appropriate hybrid, one that fits the technical and economic capacities, and the cultural values of rural people.
The ultimate purpose of communication and knowledge sharing is to assist rural people to take informed decisions over their environment, and over agriculture, health, habitat, and the other factors which impinge so critically upon the quality of their life (FAO, 1989).
Unfortunately, full and purposeful communication between development agents and rural people seldom takes place spontaneously.
The barriers to 74 communication are usually of a socio-cultural nature and involve such factors as the differing use of language and differing levels of literacy and education.
Other important barriers can be the divergent interests of the parties concerned and their differing perceptions of the realities of a given situation.
Appropriate use of communication approaches and techniques can help to overcome these barriers and promote better understanding.
The fact that we live in information and communication age has also accelerated the drive to use the media more purposefully and systematically for development.
If attitudes and behaviour are being constantly influenced by communication on the commercial and political fronts, why cannot it do the same on the rural development fronts?.
To be effective, development communication must be based on proper audience research, good planning and management, the use of a variety of media channels, and on-going testing and evaluation.
The more traditional production of communication materials for rural development in a some what ad hoc, and uncoordinated way, and often as stand-along initiatives, rather part of a communication strategy, has seldom had any measurable effect in helping to change attitudes and behaviour.
3.1.2 COMMUNICATION FUNCTION IN EXTENSION Communication can help to mobilize people for development action and promote better coordination and linkages.
It can spread knowledge of mutually decided proposals to the rural populace, and thus mobilize people to take appropriate collective action.
It can spread knowledge of successful development experience in some communities to similar, but less advanced communities, as means of mobilizing the latter to action.
It can ensure that people are informational linked to each other, to source of advice and 75 information, to sources of learning and education, and to sources of planning and decision making.
It can organize and manage systems to promote exchange of information horizontally between say, groups of rural peopled, or groups of technicians, or vertically from planners to grassroots level and feedback from the grassroots to planners.
It can organize information systems that help farmers to keep abreast of potential markets and commodity prices and to assist them in planning and coordinating the provision of farm inputs.
FAO (1989) submits that communication can be vitally useful in improving the reach and impact of training and extension in rural areas, whether in the training of extentionists and other development agents in the field, or in the passing of information to rural people.
It can overcome barriers of illiteracy through the use of audio-visual materials.
It can compress time, allowing a complete cropping cycle to be shown in a short audio-visual presentation.
It can compress distance, so that experiences in far-off villages can be brought in lively and attractive form to other villagers sharing similar problems.
It can record, in audio-visual form, the best available technical information at sits source in research institutes.
Using these materials throughout the extension chain and down to the last farmers, will ensure that the information arrives undistorted.
Ramirez and Quarry (2004) said that educationally, communication makes things known by sharing knowledge.
It makes technical known-how accessible to increase knowledge about the production, transformation, organization and marketing dimensions of agriculture, including price information.
Service providers are able to seek and find information sources and repackage materials for farmers learning.
Social or facilitative communication provides platform for participation and debate.
Providing platforms for 76 stakeholders to exchange and explore new ideas and programes, stakeholders participate, become empowered, take action, and take ownership of the programme.
Time sensitive communication keeps in touch with family, prices, and weather.
Private sector finds ways to provide time-sensitive agricultural, health and educational content in a cost effective manner.
Communication enhances learning where farmers listen actively, inviting feedback for course correction.
These functions are practical building blocks in the design of communication strategy.
3.1.3 COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES Strategic communication, development communication or communication for development are the terms communication professionals use to indicate planned communication strategies applied to development programmes or projects.
When we talk about communication, we are referring to a planned communication approach that can support a range of programme implementation needs through several functions.
The word “planned” is stressed to emphasize the importance of being proactive in plotting out carefully constructed communication inputs to enhance programme or project implementation.
Communication for development is the use of communication processes, techniques and media to help people towards a full awareness of their situation and their options for change, to resolve conflicts, to work towards consensus, to help people plan actions for change and sustainable development, to help people acquire the knowledge and skills they need to improve their condition and that of society, and to improve the effectiveness of institutions (Fraser and Restrepo-Estrada, 1998).
The following 77 process skills are needed to facilitate a more people centered approach to communication.
� ability to involve people in decision making � ability to access people’s views � ability to facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue � ability to build capacity and understanding � ability to listen to others and share ideas � ability to ensure participation through sharing of knowledge, ideas, enhancement of debate and feedback.
Roling (1994) and Ramirez (2003) reported that the communication strategies developed in both Uganda and Mozambique (sample countries) included the following steps.
- the development of a list of themes or issues to be communicated; - an understanding of the context within which the communication takes place; - identification of possible partners or allies for building the communication process.
In all the cases, the process began with rapid audience analysis with different groups in rural areas (districts) to learn about their communication patterns and understanding of the change that was about to be put in place.
Essentially, the following were noted to the above steps.
a) what they knew about the new policies and approaches b) what media channels they preferred and could afford to use c) who were their trusted sources and disseminators of information d) the differences between men’s and women’s preferred times to listen to radio 78 e) what feedback mechanisms existed for communities to respond and voice concerns f) what training was needed at all levels.
Training in communication strategies and skills can improve the effectiveness of individual development workers in the field during interpersonal work with rural people.
3.1.4 COMMUNICATION AND CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR.
Policy makers who are faced with managing fundamental changes are often ill-prepared to coordinate the change at the field and organizational level.
Work at the field level requires time and motivation, while politicians will continue to press for quick results and will underestimate the complexity of the task at hand.
From the perspective of social marketing and participatory communication, the goal of development communication is behaviour change.
Yahaya (2003) reported that in social marketing circles, communication associated with behavioural change has six steps; namely, attention, interest, comprehension, impact, attitude and sales.
The author noted that it is similar to the diffusion of innovation theory which stipulates that adoption of innovation is not automatic but based on five stages, awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption (continuous adoption or discontinuous adoption).
Therefore, communication as a process involves the following pathways to behaviour change which include perception, interpretation, understanding, agreement and action.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1a.
Define the term communication in extension 79 (b) Explain the need for communication 4.0 CONCLUSION Communication strategies are not “magic bullets”.
However, they help articulate the specific organizational and personal roles and capacities that need attention in a new policy environment.
In developing the strategy, the government partners begin to appreciate the basic steps in communication planning and are able to appreciate its rationale.
The social and cultural backgrounds need to be taken into consideration before communication is designed to address them.
Messages need to be based on the interpretation of data from audience.
In Uganda and Mozambique, the audience research phase ensured that communication channels that were already working, or that were promising were utilized, in contrast with the proposal for a call centre which, while technically feasible, is likely ahead of its time and hence did not stay on the priority list for implementation.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, the following points are noticeable.
1.
Communication involves exchange of ideas, information and knowledge between one or more people with the aim of arriving at a meaning.
2.
To be effective, development communication must be based on proper audience research.
3.
Communication enhances learning where farmers listen actively, inviting feedback for course correction.
4.
Communication strategy involves the process of helping people to acquire the knowledge and skills they need to improve their 80 condition and that of the society and to improve the effectiveness of institutions.

There should be good public relations that promote the spread of farm information.
Extension education is essentially a process of communication.
The services provided by extension include advices, farm inputs, dissemination of improved production technologies, communication and networking services.
Ability to communicate determine to a very large extent the success or failure of an extension worker.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to; !
Explain clearly the term communication.
!
List four elements of communication processs.
!
Explain the feed back mechanism in communication process.
83 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 SOURCE/SENDER The source of the message is the sender (the individual) or a group working together or an institution responsible for initiating communication and ensuring that the objectives of the exercise are clearly defined and achieved.
The message is sent to the receiver by mouth, gesture or written form.
If done in a non verbal form, the message is transmitted through postures facial expressions.
The source must strive to update his knowledge through training in the subject matter and the methodologies of communication itself.
Factors such as tribe, culture or gender may influence the message sent by a sender.
The sender (source) of the message should endeavour to avoid ambiguity.
Enough time should be given to the preparation and delivery of the message to enable the audience listen and understand.
Senders are usually people in authority, such as government planner, researcher and extension staff.
3.1.1 THE MESSAGE The message is the stimuli or idea that the source transmits.
Message must be clear, useful to the audience, relevant to the environment and timely with respect to their livelihood activities.
Adebayo and Adedoyin (2005) submitted that message content must should be to the receiver, this implies that the message sent must be technically feasible, economically beneficial and acceptable with respect to the ethics, norms and values of the society.
There are characteristics of messages in extension communication that may enhance or hinder their acceptability by the target 84 audience.
These characteristics as itemized by Adebayo (1977) are as follows; 1.
Relative advantage- the degree to which an idea or technological innovation is perceived as being better than the one it seeks to replace.
2.
Compatibility- the extent to which an idea or message is in line with prevailing or past socio-cultural values and beliefs.
3.
Complexity- the degree to which an idea or message is perceived as relatively difficult to use and understand.
4.
Trial ability/divisibility- the ex on limited scale.
tent to which an innovation can be experimented with 5.
Observability- the degree to which the results of an innovation or message content are visible to others.
6.
Risk level- the extent to which an idea or message is perceived to expose the receiver to vulnerability due to failure.
3.1.2 CHANNEL/MEDIUM A channel or medium is the means by which a message travels from the source to the receiver.
The human senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste and feeling) make up the most common means of exchanging ideas.
The methods include visual and oral, spoken and written.
The more senses employed in the communication process, the greater the chance that it is understood.
3.1.3 RECEIVER Farmers are the receiver or the target/audience of communication.
The audience are those whom the source sender wishes to receive, understand and use the idea.
In extension communication, it is important that the receiver of each message be clearly defined and segregated into 85 homogenous groups for effective communication.
If the audience is to make progress, the extension worker should help them to change their knowledge, attitude or behaviour.
If no change takes place, there has been no communication.
A thorough study of audience is a prerequisite for good extension teaching.
3.1.4 EFFECT/FEEDBACK The effect of the communication is felt when the receiver decodes the message and develops an idea in his mind which he may or may not use.
Boove and Thill (1992) said that feedback is a key component in the communication process because it allows the sender to evaluate the effectivenes of the message.
Feedback ultimately provides an opportunity for the sender to take corrective action to clarify a misunderstood message.
Feedback plays an important role by indicating significant communication barriers.

Much consideration was not given to the social process of communication.
The same is of communication and behaviour of the target farmers who are supposedly the target audience.
Several models came up in the field 88 of communication, and many such models postulated have significant relationship with agricultural extension dispensation.
Some of these models that have direct links to agricultural development are discussed in this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (a) Enumerate the criticisms against cyclical and transactional models in communication (b) Explain linear or mathematical model (c) Describe the problem solver model (d) Differentiate social interaction model from diffusion model (e) Explain programme package model and its relevance to communication.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 LINEAR OR “MATHEMATICAL” MODEL This model originated from Shannon and Weaver’s graphical perspective to communication.
McQuail and Windhal (1981) affirmed that communication here is linear, or one-way process.
The model states five functions to be performed and identifies a dysfunctional factor (noise).
The linear or “mathematical” model illustrated in fig 1 could be explained based on the function of the model.
First, in the process of communication, the information sources produce a message to be communicated.
The second step deals with the translation or conversion of the message to signals by transmitter.
The signals are moderated and adapted to the channel to which the receiver in this processed.
The functions of the receiver in this process into reconstruct and refine the message received through the signal.
The message received will reach its destination; the signal is vulnerable to interference, which may probably be due to noise.
For instance, noise or interference occurs when agricultural information is broadcasted on the radio and farmers are listening in 89 groups, and at the same time some farmers are arguing about the content of the broadcast message.
This may result in many signals.
As a result, there may be differences between the transmitted and the received signals.
The implication of this is that the message produced by the source and that reconstructed by the receivers may not have the same meaning.
Passivity of the receiver in the communication is a major setback of this model.
This results in the inability of the sender to realize that the sent and received messages are not always identical.
Due to its linear nature and lack of feedback, the effect of the message on larger audience cannot be ascertained.

Information Source Message Transmitter Signal Noise Source Signal Receiver Message Destination 90 3.1.1 TRANSACTIONAL MODEL Defluer and Ball-Rockeach (1982) states that transactional model of communication explains the processes involved in the exchange of ideas between the sender and the receiver in an attempt to arrive at a convergence in meaning.
In order to achieve this, the authors submitted that the communication process must be interactional.
Both the sender (source) and the receiver must be actively involved in the exchange of ideas.
Figure 2 shows that the sender is the initiator of the communication process, since he has the need to get messages across to the receiver.
There is an intention to communicate with or to receive.
This implies a sender, channel and message and receiver interaction.
The model can be explained as it relates to action on others, interaction with others and reaction to others involved in the exchange of ideas.
The major asset of this model is the feedback component, which gives the source the possibility of adapting more effectively its ways\ of communicating to the destination.
Criticisms against this model is that adequacy of feedback is questionable.
Where there is mass audience and mass media channel relationship, the sources can receive only limited or indirect feedback from the audience.
More so, the possibility of presence of noise at the time of communication is very high.
The occurrence of noise at any point during the communication process could result to distraction and hence negatively affect all the other elements of the communication process.
There is limit, therefore, to the perfect convergence in the intended meaning by the source and the receiver.

Theories of Mass Communication 3.1.2 CYCLICAL MODEL The cyclical model of communication postulated by Severn and Tankard (1992) attempts to explain the behaviour of the key actors in the communication process.
Figure 3 illustrates the model as it identifies the key actor that is the receivers and senders of communication messages.
The acting parties are described as equals, performing identical functions of encoding, decoding and 92 interpreting of message content.
Encoding is at the sender’s end of the model while decoding is at the receiver’s end of the model.
Encoding means that the message is translated into a language or code suitable for the means of transmission and the intended receiver.
Decoding, on the other hand, refers to the re-translation of the message in order to extract meaning.
In mass communication, encoding can refer to technical transformations necessary for signals and also to the systematic choice of words, pictures and formats based on established procedures and the expectations held about audience experience Critics of this model felt that the model assumes a feeling of equality in communication.
However, contrary to this assumption, both human and material resources available for use in communication process are not equal (Severin and Tankard, 1992).
Message Encoder Decorder Interpreter Interpreter Decoder Encoder Message Fig 3: Cyclical model Source: Severin and Tankard (1992) 3.1.3 PROBLEM SOLVER MODEL The problem solver model has been recognized as a veritable strategy for effective communication in research dissemination and utilization in agricultural development.
The need of the clientele whether stated, implied or assumed, is the starting point of knowledge utilization analysis.
The model, as shown in figure 4 93 indicates the diagnosis of the clientele system’s need which is an essential ingredient of the change process.
The effectiveness of the model depends on the reciprocal and collaborative relationship that exists between researchers, extension agents/media practitioners, and farmers (end users).
The first stage involves identification of felt needs of the clientele through diagnostic survey or clientele environment situation analysis.
Such needs are articulated into problems din stage two.
In stage three, attempts to search for solutions and made in the process of priority setting and goal establishment.
The fourth stage involves the evaluation of possible solution and selection of the best alternatives.
The fifth stage involves the application of the best solution in real situation.
This leads to a reduction of the original need 1(b) if the solution is right.
If it is not right, the cycle starts all over again with stage 1(a) being re-initiated and the cycle is repeated until a solution which is truly needed is identified and consequently disseminated to others through selected suitable medium.

Source: Severin and Tankard (1992) 94 Solver model is its overgeneralization based on the assumption that the clientele problems are uniform and solutions to such problems are universal.
Moreso, the concept of need reduction is biased.
Psychologically, human behaviour is sometimes complex.
Solution to one problem may generate multiple problems.
Therefore, the cycle is continuous, both the researchers and the practitioners are likely to be frustrated or embarrassed out of the cycle with multiple generation needs.
3.1.4 SOCIAL INTERACTION MODEL The social interaction model is an extension of several models within the diffusion and utilization process.
The concept of diffusion and utilization process emphasizes diffusion of innovation in stages.
It is a measurement of movement of messages from person to person and system to system.
This phenomenon explains the two step flow of knowledge in communication.
This two-step flow theory involves the flow of ideas from the mass media channel to the opinion leaders in societies who then pass the information through interpersonal channels to their subordinates.
This is purely a product of social interaction within a given social system.
Social interaction theorists do not view society as a systematic unity; rather they see the society as a network of roles and channel of communication with formal and informal associations.
Critics of this model insist that several factors could affect the information generated during the period and subsequently invalidates dissemination efforts.
In addition, the idea that information received by perception through leaders will trickle downs to their subordinates hardly happens in reality.
95 3.1.5 DIFFUSION MODEL The diffusion innovation model stresses that information flows through certain channels overtime among other members of a social system.
Diffusion of innovation model reveals that individual pass through certain stages in adopting new techniques (awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption or rejection).
Limitations sof diffusion model include inherent pro-change bias.
It assumes that the innovations recommended are good and should be adopted by all.
It falls to include a test of whether the technologies it promotes truly meet the needs to the users.
Its exclusive focus on the perception leader and the early adoptor often left out those must in need.
3.1.6 PROGRAMME PACKAGE MODEL This model assesses all the externally generated messages on how individual farm operator’s needs are met.
The critique against this model is its undue emphasis on externally generated technologies that undermine the potentials of Indigenous Knowledge System (IKS).
3.1.7 INDUCED INNOVATION MODEL Induced innovation model stresses the usefulness of farm organizations as channels of communication.
The model accords great power to the market and calls for improvement in market communication linkage.
For example, price is an indicator of marketing efficiency where changes in demand and supply of products and related factors determine interaction among farmers, research institutions, marketing agencies and private agricultural entrepreneurs.
Critiques of this model maintained that there is heavy reliance on the market – mechanism and on profit motivation, 96 which may not be enough to improve the lot of subsistence farmers, and other low income rural farmers.
3.1.8 NEED BASED INTERACTIVE MODEL Nwosu and Megwa (1993) are the proponent or proposed the need based interactive model.
This model has an advantage over the general opinion which assumes that an individual is incompetent or incapable of making good decisions without some external support.
Yahaya (2003) noted that it is based on the enormous assumption that information provided to individuals generally meets their needs.
Furthermore, the proponents of this model posit that there is a discrepancy between the words of government officials and their deeds.
The author maintained that four key variables involved are represented in farmers, technology of communication, the government, and the sub-system.
Each of these variables are interdependent for effective functioning of the model.
Further explanation of these key variables shows the integrative nature of the model.
For example, figure 5 explains the involvement of farmer A in output level where contribution is in terms of need identification and establishment of priorities.
At the state level D, depending on government agency, it assists in need identification.
At level E programme dissemination through technology of communication is based on identified needs of the farmer.
Similarly, farmers at level B are at the output level.
On the other hand, state D performs monitoring, evaluation and coordination functions.
F indicates the feedback mechanism that is in built in the model at all levels.
Fett and Frochlin (1974) supported this model and suggested that dialogue with the farmers rather than merely emphasizing more lop- down communication in the place of bottom-up approach.
This is 97 because greater effort is expended on diffusion of information but little on infusion (an elicited response to a felt need).
The models limitations include lack of clear focus and uniform messages cannot be planned for them.

What are the criticisms against problem solver and social interaction model in communication?
4.0 CONCLUSION Several models of communication has been discussed as they relate to agricultural development process and extension in particular.
Each of this programme has its own limitations as regards farmers and extension agent.
What ever models of communication is 98 applied in the extension process; the suitability of such models is uppermost for the extention agents and should be about change in behaviour of the farmer.
5.0 SUMMARY The following points are obvious in the above unit.
1.
Passivity of the receiver in the linear model is a major setback.
2.
The transactional model is the interaction with others and the reaction to others involved in the exchange of ideas.
3.
In cyclical model, encoding is at the senders` end of the model while decoding is at the receivers` end of the model.
4.
The problem solver model deals with the diagnosis of the clientele system need which is an essential ingredient of the change process.
5.
In general, the purpose or essence of communication models is to motivate farmers` to consider the possibility of change and to convey factual data needed in adoption of specific improved practices.

In this unit, you will learn the barriers to effective communication, the role listening skills play in communication and what effective communication entails.
Feedback in communication exposes where the barriers lies in the process.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to; !
Identify barriers to effective communication.
!
Identify non-verbal communication styles.
!
Explain factors affecting listening habits in communication.
3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION Wright and Noe (1995) states that the barriers for effective communication include differences in background, different interpretations of words, and differing emotional reactions.
Bovee and Thill (1992) also listed the following as barriers to effective communication.
� Distance – physical distance, if the distance between the sender and receiver is far, the communication may be distorted or misplaced.
� Serial transmission – the message passes from different managerial levels to another.
The meaning of the message may be distorted 101 � Noise – Anything that can lead to the message being misinterpreted.
� Individual perception – may also distort communication that is they may be subjective in decoding a message thereby blocking effective communication 3.1.1 NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION Burnett and Dollar (1989) posits that non-verbal communication involves physical ways of communication, like tone of voice, touch, smell and body motion.
Creative and aesthetic non-verbal communication includes singing, music, dancing and sculpturing.
Symbols and sign language are also included in non-verbal communication.
Body language is a non-verbal way of communication.
Body posture and physical contract e,g, shaking of hands, pushing, patting and touching expresses the feeling of intimacy.
Facial expressions, gestures and eye contact are all different ways of communication.
Non-verbal communication involves exchanging informati8on or transmitting data without the use of words.
Thus, while understanding non-verbal communication may require some knowledge of the cultural and social meanings behind the symbols and signs used, some types of non-verbal communication are instinctual and no teaching is necessary.
Non- verbal communication (NVC) – provides reaction such as sex appeal, affiliation, aggression, fear, joy, grief etc.
These are best expressed through NVC.
The function of NVC includes the display of emotional states, interpersonal attitude, regulation of interaction and feedback.
Types of non-verbal communication are: � sign language – an example of this language is the gesture system used by the deaf � action language – walking, jumping etc 102 � object language – carved image of human being using stick represents a deity in the African traditional religion.
3.1.2 RELEVANCE OF LISTENING SKILLS IN COMMUNICATION Communication efficiency demands listening skill.
This is necessary because of the possibility of wrong message, poor language code or faulty channels.
Failure of communication to take place is traceable to poor listening skills on the part of the receiver.
In agriculture, the extension agent should realize that it is his responsibility to ensure that the farmers are good listener to programmes introduced to them.
Several authors confirmed that we retain about 50% of what we listen to; and remember 25% only after two months.
Listening is therefore essential for learning to take place in the process of communication.
Factors responsible for poor listening habits in communication are summarized by Yahaya (2003) as follows.
� Partial listening – inability to follow the speaker because we think faster than an average person can talk.
� Emotional black out – listening mechanism is turned off if people have a set of emotions.
� Message blackout – this occurs when messages are seen by listeners as being uninteresting or too difficult to grasp.
� Speaker dismissal - they cut off from further listening to the speaker may be due to style of cloths, type of voice or physical appearance � Faking attention – there are times when listeners pretend to listen, and assume a listening posture � Pencil listening – many believed that they can listen and at the same time write.
In such situations, the facts are written down but the interpretation is missing.
103 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Identify barriers to communication 4.0 CONCLUSIONS Feedback in communication is extremely important for senders, since it allows them, to discover as whether they are speaking too fast, using words that are too complex, or even whether they are offending or angering their receivers.
Feedback can consist of words, non-verbal symbols, or both.
Feedback makes it possible for speakers to judge how well they are communicating.
The success of communication process depends heavily upon the sender receiving feedback.
5.0 SUMMARY From this unit, the following points are visible; 1.
The sender is an individual, group, or organization who initiates the communication.
2.
The sender’s experiences, attitudes, knowledge, skill, perceptions, and culture influence the message.
3.
The written words, spoken words, and non-verbal language selected are paramount in ensuring the receiver interprets the message as intended by the sender.
4.
Barriers to communication include the following – differences in background, different interpretation of words, differing emotional reactions.
Others include – Distance , Serial transmission, noise and individual perception.

4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor- Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Communication in the context of effectiveness is what holds the whole world together.
Here, communication means relating with various farmers’ organization effectively at the appropriate time.
Information either verbal or written, interpersonal or mass must be effectively used to mobilize and motivate the literate farmers to carry messages to appropriate receivers.
As noted earlier,.
Feed back must be anticipated to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the message disseminated.
The channels to be used will of course depend on the type of information, the receivers and the expected feedback.
When we consider farmers and their relationships to 106 agricultural research institutes, it becomes significant for the extension agent or change agent to ascertain the relevance of information flow from research institutes to farmers.
In this regard, Hornick (1988) reported that givens the shortage of extension agents, the mass of individual farmers cannot now, and will not in the future, be reached directly.
Strategies that could be used include: researcher to farmer and vice-versa; extension to farmer, the media to farmer and farmer to farmer.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: By the end of this unit, you should be able to � Explain the relationship between communication and technology transfer � State the role of information officer with regards to stakeholders in the field of information � Explain persuasive messaging and its effects on the farmer 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 COMMUNICATION STRATEGY IN TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER The agricultural Development Project assists the Village Extention Agents (VEAS) in the extension subcomponent of the ADP in their technology dissemination function.
This function is performed principally through the use of mass media – e.g.
electronic (as in radio and television) and print (calendar, bulletin, posters, photo exhibition and information leaflet).
Other communication activities conducted include organization of agricultural shows, making press release, production of posters and manuals on specific technologies.
In most states, the radio broadcast is the major communication activities carried out.
FAO (1998) reported that in most state in Nigeria where state Agricultural development project functions, radio programme broadcast is a far cry from what obtains in India, where 107 agricultural programme are broadcast in a rural radio station every day for one hour.
Fraser and Villet (1994) stresses that besides the low frequency of information broadcast that characterize the electronic media, the information is basically TOP-WOWN, monotonous and rarely involves the farmers in generating information, processing and evaluation of the content and presentation style.
Vital information on marketing channels for perishable goods, procurement of farm inputs and so on does not reach the farmer’s quickly.
The communication support units of the ADP are also involved in the provision of audio-visual instructional materials such as films, video, overhead projector etc.
used by the extension agents in transferring technology.
The services rendered by the communication support unit are concentrated on reaching farmers through the mass media mainly radio and television broadcast, print media (poster, calendar).
The transfer of technology through mass media or mass contact is effective when general information is to be passed.
The end-user are adequately sensitized about a particular technology.
The extension agents use the individual or group-method.
Aboyade (1987) agreed that the method used will be dependent on the nature of the technology, general level of education of farmers, the stage in adopted process, the technical competence level of the village extension agent (VEA) and available resources at the disposal of the extension research stations.
Udoakah (1998) emphasizes that the individual contact involves a one to one communication between the VEA and the farmer.
This is done by personal visits to the farm and houses of the farmers.
The farmer receives full attention; however, many farmers are not reached in this process.
Though it is an effective channel of persuading the farmers, the method demand 108 high cost in terms of staff, time and fund, though it is an effective channel of persuading the farmers, identifying decision making difficulties and clarification of feelings.
The use of GSM to call farmers by VEAs is popular method; also information in agriculture is being obtained from the internet to help farmers solve their problem.
The group method involves the extension agents visiting the farmers in groups at meetings, seminars, workshops, Agriculture shows, photo exhibition, demonstration plots, excursion, field days, press release and on-farm adaptive Research (OFAR) plots and small plot Adaptation Trials (SPAT) plots.
The group method allows for horizontal learning that is the farmers have their experiences, perception and shortcomings.
Solution is found to group problems.
More farmers are reached through this method than the personal contact method.
The training and visit system of extension remains the major strategy for disseminating improved agricultural technologies to small scale farmers.
The VEA is expected to be technically competent to disseminate Information in all areas of crops, livestock and fisheries.
One disadvantage in that it places heavy responsibilities on VEAS.
The level of technical competence of some VEAS may be questionable.
3.1.1 DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH Often, members of the public particularly those involved in farming business criticize researchers for not publishing their research findings.
Some people conclude that the findings are not relevant while others say the interpretations of the findings are scientific jargons.
Babaleye (2003) posits that politics makers often challenge researchers to make their findings known to the public.
A communication gap obviously exists between the researchers and 109 the farmers.
Often times, extension agents are blamed for this lapse.
The extension agents on the other hands complain of inadequate resources and lack of other infrastructural facilities such as poor finding, poor staffing and lack of inadequate materials, lack of good access roads to reach farmers and lack of necessary inputs.
The role of information officers in agricultural researchers is complimentary to that of the extension agent.
The extension agent demonstrates new technologies directly to farmers’ in designated research plots or farmers’ field.
The information officer uses the mass media to communicate new technologies to farmers in particular.
Unlike the extension agent, the information officer is not trained to teach farmers.
The information officer, rather, assists the extension agent by making public, through the mass media, interpersonal communication strategies during visits and workshops.
He also participates in agricultural shows and trade fairs to demonstrate to the public what technologies are available to be tapped for public benefit.
He must have sound professional experience in the media in order to target the appropriate audience.
He also popularizes scientific information in such a way that it will be attractive to the farmers.
He or she is a catalyst and interpreter who translates sophisticated scientific findings into a simple practical knowledge for the farmers benefit.
Using and harnessing the potentials of all channels of the mass media, the information officer is expected to transform the seemingly difficult scientific results to the farmers.
In order to accomplish the aforementioned roles successfully, Babaleye (2003) further remarked that the information officer ought to have good knowledge of at least three types of people who are stakeholders in the field of information – namely, the scientist, professional colleagues and the farmers.
110 The information officer must be careful in decoding scientific information in a manner that will show respect for empirical knowledge.
The information to be disseminated must be precise without addition or subtraction.
The information officer should be able to identity media colleagues with sound background know ledge of journalism who can manage scientific information in order not to trivialize the scientific report.
The information officer must understand farmer background and how they react to issues at any given point.
Information that is not well coded may completely disrupt the prices of informing the farmers and tune them off.
3.1.2.
OBJECTIVE AND PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE OF INFORMATION OFFICER.
The objectives of the office of public information in agricultural research are as follows.
1.
Ensure a free flow of information from research station to farmers and other targeted groups with a view to improving agricultural productivity.
2.
Create public awareness on the research mandates, goals, and achievements of the institute.
3.
Population the impacts and technologies emanating from institute.
4.
Ensure a harmonious flow of information internally and externally The information officer should possess competencies needed for discharging his duties.
Some of these professional competencies are as follows: Knowledge of the native language especially in the area where the research centre is located is essential.
The information must be adequately trained in the use of language of communication of the area he intends to work.
An impressive communication skills and good knowledge of news writing for electronic and print media 111 should be an important attribute of an information officer.
To reach the farmer, the officer should package the information to positively influence farmer and other users of research findings.
The officer must be knowledgeable in the research mandate of the organization.
It is the duty of the officer to create public awareness on the research activities of the institutes.
This could be achieved by organizing press briefings where activities of the institute will be made public.
The information officer should be competent in organizing radio and television programs in the native language of illiterate farmers to enable them benefit from agricultural research findings.
An essential tool for the information officer is the knowledge of the research institute and willingness to inform the public.
The information officer must be alert, neat, smart and receptive to visitors.
The officer should have good sense of humour and ready to assist farmer even at expensed of personal comfort.
In planning information dissemination strategies, the information officer must plan always to make impact.
There should be clear vision of who is being targeted.
Thus, he should have good knowledge of the audience to be served by agricultural research institute.
Since the farmers are the public (most important), the acceptability of research findings by farmers will be an index to measure the success or failure of the research institute.
It is important to empathize with farmers to enable such farmers have confidence in the information officer and accept or adopt the new technologies being introduced.
The information officer must be able to determine whether or not the message being packaged for the farmers will be meaningful to them.
The ability of the information officer to persuade, motivates, inspired and bring about desired change in the farmer is a skill that is 112 essential.
Communication therefore should be persuasive.
Persuasion here could be in form of propaganda, brain washing or indoctrination.
The effect of persuasion is that people are influenced with corresponding behaviour modification.
In the process, beliefs, values and attitude are established.
Human communication involves persuasion which serves to influence others by modifying their views.

4.0 CONCLUSION The information officer must avoid the use of technical terms which will be difficult to comprehend by farmers.
On the part of the information officer, coded information to various categorizes of farmers will require good knowledge of environment to forestall misplaced information particularly if the information is wrongly targeted.
To achieve successful persuasion, messages must be seen or should be motivational with incentive 5.0 SUMMARY.
The following points could be identified in the above unit.
1.
All the activities of information officer are better accomplished with the availability of funds.
2.
Without good funding and proper budgeting, the officer may become frustrated for lack of funds to run the office.
3.
The officer should have affordable good communication equipment e.g.
telephone.
4 .The ability of the information officer to make the best use of what is available will make the impact of the research centre.
113 5.
The information officer ought to have a global view of things happening in the research institution in order to relate with other farmers elsewhere in the country.
6.
Technology transfer is the dissemination of research findings through the mass media which could be electronic or print media.
All agricultural research information passes through these medium to the rural farmers.
7.
The Radio and television being the most common medium of technology transfer.
8.
The agricultural development Agency(s) (ADPs) and the village extension agents are the principal agents in the technology transfer process.

UNIT 6 MEDIA FOR RURAL COMMUNICATION AND DEVELOPMENT.
CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Contents 3.1 Video 3.1.1 Slide sets/ film strips 3.1.2 Audio Cassettes 3.1.3 Audio cassettes 3.1.4 Flip Charts 3.1.5 Printed Materials 3.1.6 Rural Radio 3.1.7 Participatory Video 3.1.8 The Internet 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor- Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION: There are several media used for rural communication.
No single medium is better than any other.
Circumstances and the nature of 115 the project dictate which media that could be used.
The extension agent must know what media the people have access to and which enjoy credibility.
Availability of a particular media could also influence the choice of the media to be used.
Message that pass through different channels could have great impact towards behavioral change of the people.
The use of multi-media approach is therefore the most effective medium for rural communication.
Media alone dose not result to behavioral change.
Face-to-face discussion with a more knowledgeable or experienced person than the farmers themselves could enable them make their own judgment and try new innovation.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: � Explain the use of video and slide sets � Describe Audio Cassettes and flip charts � List the functions of printed materials and rural radio � Explain the use of internet and participatory video in rural communication 3.0 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 VIDEO It is persuasive, cheaper and reliable Electronic image or sound recording gives immediate playback and production flexibility.
More than one language can be recorded as commentary on a single tape and can be shown in the day light using battery powered equipment.
It requires talent, skill, and experience to produce good programmes.
However, maintenance of facilities and repair is expensive and sophisticated and may require huge capital investment.
Video is a type of media known to many and is highly effective.
3.1.1 SLIDE SETS / FILM STRIPS 116 Unlike video, it requires low-cost equipment for production and projection.
The visual quality and colour is high.
The film strips are made of robust material and are small, easy to transport.
Laboratory process is required for production and cannot be used in day light without special rear-projection screen.
In developing countries, turning slides into film – strips require laboratory process, which is not always available in developing countries.
Slides /film strips have proved an invaluable training aid in rural and agricultural development.
Video seems to take over despite its high cost.
3.1.2 AUDIO CASSETTES Cassette players are quite widely available and it is easy and cheap to produce for a programme.
It is easy to localize information and good for feedback because farmers can record their reactions or questions.
It can be used well in conjunction with rural radio.
It produces audio only and so suffers some of the weakness of Radio, though repeated listening may help to overcome it.
It is a very good low-cost medium.
Its potential has not been sufficiently recognized.
It is useful in conjunction with extension and rural radio.
3.1.3 FLIP CHARTS It is cheap and simple to use and good for training and extention support.
It is not as realistic as projected aids.
Often, care is required in making drawings understandable to illiterates.
It lacks the attraction of audio-visual materials.
Some people rate flip charts as second rated or lower than electronic media.
Flip charts are very useful to help extensionists in their work with rural people.
Drawings may be difficult to be understood for people with lo visual literacy, hence careful design and pre-test may be required.
3.1.4 PRINTED MATERIALS 117 Printed materials are cheap, simple and easy to produce.
It can be taken home, consulted, and kept as permanent reminder.
It is particularly valuable for extortionists, technicians and community leaders.
It is not used by illiterates’ farmers.
Van de Ban and Hawkins (1996) enthuses that it is designed and carefully written for their intended audience, printed materials can provide a vitally important and cheap source of reference for extortionists, and for literates among the rural population.
3.1.5 RURAL RADIO Rural radio is different from urban radio in that it is directed specifically to rural people and their information needs.
In many cases, the information needs of the rural people are virtually ignored by national radio networks.
A rural radio approach is an alternative to city-centred or urban radio.
The first rural radio programmes in Africa appeared in the late 1960s, growing out of educational radio efforts in Europe, Canada and the USA.
One of the most significant contributors to the evolution of rural radios was the radio forum movement in Canada from the 1940s to the 1960s.
Usually, listening groups gathered around a radio receiver at a given time to listen to a programme, the group discusses what they had just heard and sent their comments and questions back to the radio producers.
At its height, the Radio Forum involved 1,600 groups across Canada with a total audience of 30,000 listeners (Yahaya, 2001).
UNESCO adapted lessons from the Canadian experience for use in India in the late 1950s.
In subsequent years, the use of radio as a development tool was promoted in various regions of the world, including Africa.
The radio clubs also known as collective listening groups were organized in various African countries, such as the association des Radio Clubs du Niger, founded in 1962.
From 118 these early efforts, methodology for rural radio evolved, which was based initially on mixed programming (combining agriculture, health and oral tradition, music and folk tales) and subsequently developed into a more interactive use of the medium.
Thus, the rural radio programmes are most effective when produced with audience participation, in local languages and taking into account cultural traditions.
The community must be seen to be actively involved in rural radio programme.
For example, live public shows and village debates.
The approach enables the rural people to participate in the dialogue and decision-making processes necessary for them to control their own economic, social and cultural environment.
The functions of rural radio amongst others are enumerated as follows: � It is a tool, which combined with other media, can be used for training in the transfer and exchange of knowledge and technologies.
� Essential for rapid diffusion of development information in a diversity of language.
� It is a channels for interactive communication, for dialogue and debate on the major issues of rural development � A tool for cultural expression and entertainment � A means of collecting and preserving the oral and musical heritage of rural communities � A means of raising public awareness and motivation � A medium for the expression of perception needs and aspirations of rural communities � A medium to collect local information on social issues, which is essential for defining, planning and implementing development efforts.
119 Rural radio goes beyond agricultural issues to address a wide range of related social, educational, health and cultural issues.
It is excellent for motivating farmers and for drawing their attention to new agricultural production ideas and techniques.
It has wide coverage and is readily available, even to very remote rural populations.
In recent years, some important changes have taken place in radio in most part of Africa.
It is now becoming more interactive, a sharp departure from the once a top-down medium for delivery of messages.
Government controlled radio is being joined by independent, private radio stations (Onabanjo, 2002).
3.1.6 PARTICIPATORY VIDEO All over the country, small-format video has become a household named.
This popularity has equally made it a tool for rural and Agricultural development.
It is also a persuasive and effective communication medium.
Video perform the following roles overcome barriers of illiteracy it demonstrates visually, a new farming ideas and techniques compress time of presentation of agricultural process constrict space difference by using testimonials of rural people from other locations standardize information so that it is transmitted accurately from technical sourced to farmers.
Video is an effective communication tool to increase awareness about specific development problems and has become relatively cheap any easy to use.
Experience has shown that with basic training, rural people can prepare video presentations about community development in their local mother tongue.
Presentations can be shown in areas without electricity using battery powered 120 monitors.
The small format video, video cameras and portable monitors, has enabled rural dwellers to share their experiences with one another across vast distances.
Instead of being used as one- way broad cast medium, video can be used, as a communication process tool, which enables rural people to address their information and knowledge needs in order to achieve their development objectives.
In Africa, FAO has applied participatory video to rural and agricultural development based on experiences that have been successful in Latin America using a methodology called “rural advisory pedagogy”.
This methodology uses participatory video as a communication tool for mediating betweens rural people’s needs and the possible sources of information and expertise to respond to those needs.
3.1.7 THE INTERNET It represents the largest computer network in the world.
The internet emerged in the early 1960s, in the context of the cold War, from research funded by the United States Department of Defense.
It was designed as decentralized computer network that was less vulnerable to nuclear attack, than a centrally control system.
A decentralized, “fail-safe” system was devised whereby computers sent packets of information from one computer to another across the United States.
Alternatively computer routes allowed the information to reach its destination in the events that one or more routes were destroyed.
Today, the internet is a global “peoples’ network” for communicating and sharing information.
It consists of two powerful tools – e – mail and the World Wide Web (W.W.W).
From its origins, the internet has become a vast and growing global network that people use to converse, debate, meet, teach, learn, buy and sell.
As such, the internet offers opportunities for two-way and 121 horizontal communication and for opening up new, non-traditional communications channels for rural communities and development organizations.
Meera (2004) said that internet can be potentially useful for rural development in the following ways.
- Reduce the isolation and marginalization of rural communities - Facilitate dialogue among communities and those who influence them (educators, researchers and development agencies).
- Encourage participation of communities in decisions which impact their lives - Coordinate local, regional and national development efforts for increased efficiency - Provide information, knowledge and skills training in a responsive and flexible manner - Help overcome the physical and financial barriers that prevent agricultural research, technicians, farmers and others from sharing information.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE.
1.
Briefly state the use of the following in Agricultural Communication (a) Video (b) Slide sets (c) Audio cassettes 4.0 CONCLUSION It is important to recognize that the effective application of the Internet to rural and Agricultural development requires an approach that focuses on enhancing information and knowledge sharing.
Communication is a key component of human resource development for sustainable agricultural production and improved food security in Africa.
Communication can facilitate agricultural development by giving a voice to those involved (rural people, development workers, researchers and local authorities).
People can be mobilized for 122 participation and action through communication, information can be conveyed for education and training and disseminate new technologies.
Communication media and techniques can help overcome barriers of literacy, language, cultural differences and physical isolation.
Beginning with an understanding of the audience is important before selecting the media to use.
Only an audience participation based approach to communication will assure that the messages in the media channels are responsive to the needs of farmers.
Media are powerful tools to inform and educate people about new agricultural ideas and technological innovations for improved food production.
5.0 SUMMARY.
The major points in this unit are; 1.
Governments require advice on communication as part of rural development policy and help in establishing national communication systems, which can support food production initiatives.
2.
There is a wide range of media available and used for communication.
3.
Media differ with respect to forms of symbolic representation.
Factors such as cost, availability and skills required to use them must be considered.
4.
There is strong evidence that no one medium is inherently better than any single medium.
5.
Video – with video, information useful for rural farmers can be recorded and played back for them to learn from thereof.
6.
Slide setts – recorded activities of what the extension agents wants the farmer to know can be projected using film slide on a screen.
It has high visual quality and colour.
123 7.Audio cassettes – information are recorded using the audio cassette.
The farmers listen to these information and can react through feedback.
The same audio cassette can be used to record their feedback.
Farmers listen to the information on audio cassette repeatedly.

3.1.1 Organization of Extension Communication.
3.1.2 Staffing for Communication Support 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor- Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings.
1.0 INTRODUCTION Extension workers are concerned about inadequate methods and media for communicating knowledge to formers, home makers and other clientele.
They often do not have the current scientific information readily available in reference form to help formers solve 125 practical production problems.
Often, the materials they have are research reports, which are designed and written for the scientific community.
They also, often, do not relate closely to the needs of the clientele extension is trying to serve.
The extension workers demand for simple publications, facts sheets, slide sets, illustrated posters, voice recordings and other communication materials that will help them inform farmers of recommended practices for increasing production.
Extension administrators and subject matter specialists often face difficulties when they try to develop reports that will effectively communicate the importance of their work to government leaders and other key audience.
They have difficulty publishing appropriate annual reports and programme accomplishments.
Such concerns have led many ministries, and extension leaders, to recognize that one link is missing in the agricultural knowledge-sharing system.
The link is an extension communications unit, comprising professional men and women who have education and experience in the twin disciplines of agriculture and communications.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Enumerate six functions of extension communication unit.
2.
Explain communication services in a communication unit 3.
Explain organizational structures for extension communications unit.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 FUNCTIONS OF EXTENSION COMMUNICATION UNIT.
The existence of communication units, their effectiveness and the willingness or hesitancy of administrators to make allowances and adjustments, may partly-determine the breadth of functions undertaken by a communication unit.
A broad array of functions that 126 must be carried out within extension and which unarguably fit into an extension communication units are: 1.
Planning: This function is carried out by an extension personnel who are involved with, and concerned about the well-being of a programme.
The intention is to make effective and efficient use of all programme resources, to assure that reasonable goals are defined, that a logical approach is designed to reach them, and that a method for evaluating the success of the effort is determined.
2.
Information Generation: Early in the planning process, it will be necessary to generate information about the audience to be reached, and about the media available to reach them.
That function can most effectively be carried out by personnel within the communications unit with input from keys extension personnel who have had extensive contact with the clientele or audience members.
3.
Staff training This function assures that all extension personnel involved with the programme or campaign have a clear understanding about it, have the knowledge necessary to perform their roles, and understand how their efforts tally with the work of others.
Professional communicators may play a wide range of roles in carrying out this function.
Professional communicators can support training for extension personnel by providing them with: a) Technical subject-matter training and teaching dmaterials.
The intention is to help extension personnel at all levels to improve their knowledge of specific technical subjects.
The materials may be simple flyers, 127 fact sheets or complex self-study guides with audio-visual support.
b) Extension methods training and teaching materials to help extention personnel improve their own communications and teaching skills.
4 .
Evaluation Communication unit personnel might be totally responsible for evaluating media use, audience reach and pre-testing the design.
The function may be shared with other extention personnel.
5.
Communication Services Three communications services that may logically be provided by a communications unit are as follows: a) Providing training materials for the clientele.
Such materials would include publications, flyers, posters, and other such teaching materials which are distributed to the clientele by extention workers as follow-up to teaching or to reinforce face-to-face teaching.
b) Providing mass media releases directly to extention is clientele.
Work in this area would include magazines, news releases, radio and television programming, that is, the material which is developed with extention personnel but released directly through the media.
c) Developing and maintaining media relationships.
The media according to Evans and Dahl (1984) are often bombarded with requests from organizations wishing to send messages to the vast-audiences served by the media.
Consequently, media personnel must be selective.
Professional agricultural communicators can help the media to understand the value of releasing objective 128 extension information.
They can also learn of specific requirements and the format preferred by the medium involved.
3.1.1 ORGANIZATION OF EXTENSION COMMUNICATION Organizational structures for extension communications unit will vary considerably.
The best structure for a given unit will depend on the location of the unit within the extension system (regional, ministry or other level), and the functions assigned to the unit.
However, the following guide lines for planners are as a result of experiences of extension services in various countries.
(a) At the ministry or national levels, the extension communications unit should be represented at top administrative levels, to ensure that communications support is woven into the total work of the extension organization.
The extension communications administrator should report directly to the extension director, and should serve on the administrative bodies within the organization.
(b) The extension communications unit should be connected as appropriate, with related units, such as the extention training unit, the extention library and the field worker operations unit.
These connections (FAO, 1984) should be indicated on organizational charts and maintained through programming operations.
(c) The organization of an extension communications unit should reflect a conviction that effective output of publications depends on effective analysis and planning.
Table 2: Organizational Relationships in an Extension Communications Unit Programming Director Production/Distribution 129 Programming resource Print Services - Provide analysis and - Editorial - Evaluation of audiences - Printing, Distribution - Messages, media, budgets etc.
- Graphic arts Communication programme planning - Photography - Consulting with specialists - Radio - Conceiving plans - Video Communication Programme Management - Executing planned programmes - Television, Video tape, film - Evaluating progress and results - Exhibits, displays, maintenance - equipment - facilities Table 12:1 above shows some organizational relationship of extension communications activity.
However, no given unit is probably organized exactly in this manner.
The sample structure above helps express some ways in which to organize related functions of an extension communication unit.
From operational stand point, activity will tend to flow from analysis, to planning, to production, to distribution, to analysis of results.
Smooth interaction within the system is vital because no function is isolated from the others.
Those who organize and manage extension communications programmes should resist the temptation to emphasize activities on the right hand side of the table at the expense of those on the left-hand side.
130  3.1.2 STAFFING FOR COMMUNICATION SUPPORT.
Staff members in communication unit should operate as extension personnel whose specialty is communications, a complex and often technical area.
As a result, extension communications units are usually staffed according to media skills which the unit requires, such as printing, radio, graphic arts.
Sometimes in a larger unit, staff members may also divide responsibilities according to topical expertise.
For example, an editorial staff member may specialize in agricultural publications, or an extension communicator may specialize in project related to family planning.
Swanson and Rassi (1981) opines that sizes of staff vary greatly, depending on many factors including the functions assigned, and budgets.
An international study of national extension systems in 1980 revealed that among 62 systems that reported having agricultural information units, the number of staff ranged from 1 to 167.
The arithmetic average size was about 14 staff members, while the median size was 5 staff members.
The study also showed a median ratio of 1 agricultural information staff member to 48 extension personnel in the total system.
The average was considerably higher, with 1 agricultural information staff member to 139 extension personnel.
These staffing levels for extension communications are widely believed to be lower than the optimum.
However, results of the survey are useful in revealing current ranges and averages.
A severe shortage of qualified extension communicators exists in many countries, especially those in nations which have limited programmes of professional education in communications.
Results of various studies have shown that current staff members in extension communication units often have inadequate communications training.
This situation poses a serious 131  challenge to extension organizations as they work to improve their communication programme.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Explain “staff training” for communication extension personnel.
4.0 CONCLUSION There is a general recognition that agricultural communications professional have significant roles to play in the task of sharing agricultural knowledge at all levels.
It is the extension communication specialists who help extension workers produce publications for communications to the farmer.
In co-operation with extension leaders, they can produce radio and television programmes, they can plan and produce audio-visual presentations for farmer audiences, and help plan educational campaigns to transfer knowledge quickly and efficiently.
5.0 SUMMARY.
1.
Extension communication specialist can help extension administrators develop publications and other types of presentations to communicate the effectiveness of extension’s programmes to other officials within the ministry or other branches of government.
2.
Efforts can lead to new levels of understanding and appreciation that can greatly influence the support which extension will have from the government in the future.
3.
The functions of the extension communications unit and the structure of organization if well implemented and planned will ensure that organizing for extension communications is near perfect and the rural farmers stands the best of chance to benefit.
132  4.
Staff training is often carried out for extension personnel in order to enhance their professional competence in the discharge of their duties.
5.
Staffs are trained on technical subject matter and teaching materials to use, communications and teaching skills of staff are improved upon.
6.
Staff training raises the confidence of the extension personnel on the field and makes his responsibilities easily executable.
