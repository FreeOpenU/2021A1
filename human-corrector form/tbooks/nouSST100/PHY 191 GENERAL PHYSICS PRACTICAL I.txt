NonePHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I PHY 191: GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL COURSE GUIDE NATIONAL OPEN UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA NOUN 2PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I This physics practical has been designed in such a way that you will develop some manipulative skills in handling some physics apparatus.
It is an integral part of your physics course, which reinforces some, if not all, the principles, theories and concepts you must have learnt in Mechanics, Heat and Properties of Matter.
Furthermore, the Physics Practical is to enable you determine some physical constants such as acceleration due to gravity, specific heat capacity of a sold or liquid, force constant of a spiral spring to mention a few.
This physics practical course will show you how to: • Identify the two physical quantities to be measured as the variables - the independent and dependent variables; • Determine the relationship between the two variables in form of a graph.
Thus the first thing you have to do is to study the concept of graph in Unit l. In measurement, you are supposed to be accurate as possible but no measurement is absolutely correct because of the errors that are bound to occur due to personal errors.
Unit 2 therefore introduces you to how you can minimise or reduce such errors when you measure physical quantities such as length, mass, time and temperature.
Since one is bound to make errors, you are required to analyse your errors in the process of the determination of the physical constant.
Unit 3 therefore shows you how you can analyse your errors.
After Unit 3 are the ten (10) experiments that you are required to perform.
In performing these experiments you must posses the following before going to the laboratory: 1.
A mathematical set containing the protractor, set squares, pair of compass, short ruler and pencils 2.
A soft rubber (eraser) 3.
18cm long transparent plastic ruler 4.
A scientific notebook with graph sheets to record your experiments.
5.
Four - figure table and or a scientific calculator French - curves for drawing graphs.
NOUN 3PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Getting Set for the Practical • You are supposed to read the experiment, as many times as possible so that you know how you will carryout the experiment in question.
• On the day of the experiment you are to make sure that you assemble all the apparatus required from the Laboratory Technologist • Set up the apparatus carefully and neatly on the working bench.
• Determine beforehand how you will establish the physical quantities to be measured.
• Remember to include in your table the way to obtain, observe and record the dependent variable twice for a corresponding value of the independent variable.
This is a way of taking a precaution to ensure accurate measurement.
The repetitive values can be used to obtain the mean values of the dependent variable.
• Examine the apparatus very well before the commencement of the experiment to ensure that they are working well.
Then make necessary corrections.
• Do form the habit of writing on scarps of paper, use your notebook straight to contain all observations and calculations.
Report of Experiments The report of each experiment should start from a fresh page in your notebook.
The following must be clearly written in this order: 1.
Date when the experiment was performed 2.
The aim or purpose of the experiment 3.
Table of observations 4.
Graph 5.
Calculation of slope or the constant 6.
Estimation of errors where possible 7.
Conclusion NOUN 4PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I There is no need to repeat in your report, the section on apparatus, procedure or theoretical consideration.
All these are already contained in your course-text.
You are required to spend not more than l hr 30min in performing and the reporting the experiment each time you are in the laboratory.
At the end of this period you are required to submit your experiment for assessment.

These are called fundamental physical quantities.
You should also note that such fundamental quantities are used to obtain derived quantities such as force, velocity, pressure, density etc.
Through such measurements we are able to learn more about nature.
We are able to measure some constants about nature for example acceleration due to gravity, the resistance of a wire, and specific heat capacity of a substance.
We NOUN 7PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I determine these constants by identifying how two variables are related through the use of graphs.
Thus in your practical sessions in the laboratory, you will be developing practical skills in measuring physical quantities and the show the relationship between the two physical quantities to be measured through the use of graphs.
In this unit therefore, you will be introduced to the various types of graphs and how to use such graphs to obtain the physical constants required.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit you should be able to: • identify the importance of graphs in the study of physics; • identify the two variables as physical quantities to be measured, • show how the two variables are related either linearly or non-linearly, • identify linear relationship from non-linear relationship; • translate non-linear relationships to linear relationships, • use graphs to determine physical constants through the use of slopes (gradients) or intercepts.
3.0 GRAPHS In physics, we are always interested in knowing how two variables are related to each other.
There are two types of variables • independent variable • dependent variable For example, if the value of quantity P depends on the value of quantity Q, then, Q is the independent variable while P is the dependent variable.
For example, the change in position of an object with respect to time.
Time (t) is regarded as the independent variable while the change in position (x) is regarded as the dependent variable.
NOUN 8PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I If you therefore measure time (t) of a moving object and its corresponding change in position, it is possible to show the relationship between x and t. That is it is possible to show how x relates with t by means of a graph.
A graph, therefore gives a vivid picture of how two physical quantities are related.
The following are the advantages of graphs: • if t is plotted against x the relationship between the two variables is shown I in a pictorial form, • the corresponding values of x and t other than those actually observed or measured can be read from the graph, • it is possible to verify a known or expected relationship between x and t and to determine the numerical values of constants occurring in it, • in many cases, the relationship between x and t is of a simple form and is not known or is suspected before hand, a graph enables us to discover this form of relationship.
3.1 TYPES OF GRAPHS The following are the types of graphs you will come across.
3.1.1 LINEAR GRAPH THROUGH THE ORIGIN Consider the equation y = mx where, x is the independent variable y is the dependent variable m is a fixed number When x=0 then y=0 When x = I then y = m When x = 2 then y = 2m When x = 3 then y = 3m and so on.
If we therefore plot the graph of y on the vertical axis and x on the horizontal axis we would obtain a graph as shown in fig.
3.1.
NOUN 9PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I y ∆y ∆x O x Fig.
3.1 We would have a straight line graph passing through the origin.
You will observe that the ratio of y = m = a constant that is y is directly x proportional to x.
The gradient or the slope of the graph is obtained from this ratio: Increase in y - Increase in y m ∆y = = Increase in x ∆x Thus a straight line through the origin shows that the quantity y is directly proportional to x.
The constant of proportionality, m is given by the slope or the gradient of the graph.
3.1.2 LINEAR GRAPH NOT PASSING THROUGH THE ORIGIN Consider another equation y= mx+b where, x = independent variable y = dependent variable m and b are constants When x = 0 then y = b When x = 1 then y = m + b When x=2 then y=2m+b When x = 3 then y = 3m +band soon.
Again if we plot the graph of y on the vertical axis against x on the horizontal axis we also obtain a straight line.
It will be noted that this time the graph does not pass through the origin as shown in fig.
3.2.
NOUN 10PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I y ∆y ∆x b b value of b x - b m Fig.
3.2 You will also observe that when x = 0, y = b gives the intercept of the graph on the y-axis.
When y = 0 then x = - b gives the intercept of the graph on the x-axis.
m The relationship between y and x is also linear.
It is however to be noted that this is not a direct relationship.
The slope or the gradient of the graph is given by Increase in y ∆y while b is the intercept on the axes = = Increase in x ∆x If the line slopes downwards as shown in fig.
3.3, then the graph is said to have a negative slope.
y ∆y ∆X O Fig 3.3 NOUN 11PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Then y = -mx + b .
In conclusion, therefore, whenever the graph of y against x is a straight line, this shows that the relationship between y and x is linear and can be expressed as y=mx+b If the graph passes through the origin when b = 0 then y is directly proportional to x.
The slope or gradient Increase in y m = = Increase in x 3.1.3 REDUCING NON-LINEAR EQUATION TO LINEAR EQUATION Consider the expression that relates the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum (T) with the length (l ) of the pendulum.
T = 2p g ℓ g If T is plotted against √ℓ there will be no linear relationship between T and √ℓ But on squaring both sides of the equation we would obtain this expression T2 4p 2 ℓ = g \ T2 = 4 p 2 ℓ g Plotting the graph of T2 on the vertical axis and ℓ on the horizontal axis will give us a straight line passing through the origin as shown in fig.
3.4.
NOUN 12PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I T2/S2 T2 ℓ O ℓ/cm Fig.
3.4 The slope or the gradient of the graph is given as ∆T 2 Increase in T 2 m = 4 p 2 = = ∆ℓ Increase in ℓ g The value of g, acceleration due to gravity may then be obtained, by substitution of values of known variables in the relation.
Thus we have reduced a non-linear relationship to a linear one.
Another example of this reduction may be found in Boyle's law.
Boyle's law shows the relationship between the pressure exerted on a given mass of gas (P) and its volume V provided the temperature of the gas is kept constant.
PV =K If the values of P are plotted against the corresponding values of V, we do not obtain a linear relationship as shown in fig.
3.5 (i).
P NOUN 13PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I (i) O V. P P 1 V 1 O V. (ii) Fig.
3.5 By rearranging the expression we would obtain this P = k 1 V When P is therefore plotted against 1 , the reciprocal of V, then we obtain a straight V line passing through the origin as shown in fig.
3.5 (ii).
The gradient or the slope m of the graph is expressed as Increase in pressure _____ ∆P = Increase in the reciprocal of volume 1__ ∆V = m = K a constant The oscillation of a weighted spiral spring is another example.
There is a relationship between the period of oscillation T, the loaded mass M and the effective mass of the spiral spring m. ___________ T = 2p √ M + m k where, k is the spring constant.
NOUN 14PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I We then reduce the expression to a linear one by squaring both sides of the equation.
T2 T2 = 4p 2 (M+m) k \ T2 = 4 p 2 M + 4 p 2 m compare this equation with k k y = ax + b where y @ T2, 4 p 2 M @ ax and 4 p 2 m = b k k By plotting the values of T2 against the corresponding values of M, we would obtain a straight line graph which does not pass through the origin as shown in fig.
3.6.
T2 T2 M } b = 4 p 2 m k - m M Fig.
3.6 The gradient or the slope of the graph is expressed as Increase in T 2  T 2 4 p 2 = = Increase in M M k The intercept on the vertical axis is obtained when M = 0.
\ T2 4 p 2 m b = = k The intercept on the horizontal axis is obtained when T2 = 0.
\ M = - m NOUN 15PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I which gives us the effective mass of the spiral spring.
Thus, through the knowledge of m, k, could be determined.
3.1.4 REDUCING TO A LINEAR EQUATION FROM UNKNOWN RELATIONSHIP Suppose two physical quantities P and Q are related as P = kQn where the values of k and n are not known we can reduce the expression to a linear one by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation.
log P = log k + n log Q or log P = n log Q + log k compare it with y = nx + b where n log Q @ nx and log k @ b.
Therefore if we plot log P on the vertical axis against log Q on the horizontal axis, we shall obtain a straight line graph as shown in fig.
3.7.
Log P log P log Q Log Q Fig.
.3.7 The slope or the gradient of the graph is expressed as Increase in log P  log P = n Increase in log Q  log Q When log Q = 0 gives the intercept of the graph on the vertical axis \ log P = log k NOUN 16PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Thus the value of k is obtained.
You need to be careful when working with logarithm.
• If the value of P or Q is greater than l, log P is taken as positive.
For example, log 9 = 0.9542 log 90 = 1.9542 log 900= 2.9542 etc • If the value of P or Q is less than 1 then you need to sensitise yourself on what value of log P or log Q you have to use.
For example, log 0.5 = 1.6990 = -1 + 0.6990 = -0.3010 log 0.006 = 3.7781 = -3 + 0.7781 = -2.22 If the intercept is -2.73 -2.73=-3+x x=3-2.73=0.27 \ -2.73 = 3 + 0.2700 The antilog of 0.2700 = 1.86 \ Antilog of -2.73 = 1.86 x 10-3 3.2 DETERMINATION OF GRADIENT OF NON-LINEAR GRAPH AT A POINT From the equations y = mx y = mx +b the highest power to which x is raised is 1 hence when y is plotted against x, we obtain a straight line graph.
But for equations such as y = ax2 y = ax + bx y = ax2 + c they produce non-linear graphs because when you plot the values of y against x, we do not produce a straight line graph.
You will observe that the graphs produced are usually parabolic because they are quadratic functions.
The equations are described as being quadratic because the highest power to which x is raised is 2.

3.7 Some typical graphs of such quadratic functions for the values of – x to + x.
You will observe that the slopes of the graphs rise and fall with a turning point usually described as the minimum or maximum points of values of y with respect to x.
The slopes or gradients vary from one point of x to the other.
At the minimum or maximum point, the gradient at that point is zero.
y C b D B P a C A K R Q. X The straight lines on the graph at points a, b and c or the graph in fig.
3.8 Fig.
3.8 define the slopes of the graph at such points.
The lines AB, CD and PQ describe the tangents at points a, b and c. AB gives a positive slope or gradient while PQ produces a negative slope or gradient.
The line CD is parallel to the horizontal axis to produce no slope or gradient.
Because the slope or gradient progresses from positive values through zero at b to negative values then point b gives maximum value of y.
Otherwise as in fig.
3.9 it is a minimum value.
NOUN 18PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I B Q a C K. A P R C D b Fig.
3.9 To obtain the gradient at a, we then produce a right-angled triangle on the tangent AB such that AB forms the hypotenuse.
Hence the gradient at point a is given as BK AK which must be interpreted to scale.
Displacement-time, velocity-time and Newton's cooling curves are examples of nonlinear graphs, which enable us to measure the rate of change of displacement, velocity and other quantities such as temperature with time.
Example The table below shows the temperature of a cooling calorimeter at different times.
Use the data to determine the rate of fall of temperature at 2 min.

The gradient is defined as AC= negative which is about 5.6 °C per minute.
BC The negative sign shows that the temperature is falling.
Self Assessment Question Discuss the advantages to be gained by a graphical representation of asset of physical measurements.
SOLUTION See Text 4.0 CONCLUSION Graphs are pictorial ways of showing how two physical measurements are related.
Such physical measurements are regarded as variables.
If the graph produced is a straight line, then the relationship is described as being linear.
Then the equation that relates the two variables such as y and x are expressed as y = mx or (1) y = mx + c (2) where, x = independent variable y = dependent variable m = the slope or gradient of the slope c = intercept on the y-axis when x = 0 The first equation tells us that the line passes through the origin while the second equation does not.
NOUN 20PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I It is possible to reduce a linear graph from unknown relationship by taking the logarithm of the equation expressing the unknown relationship.

But even the best of devices yield inexact measurements.
We express these measurements as approximate numbers.
We distinguish between numbers such as 3.2 cm and 3.20 cm.
These are the results of measurements using different devices.
While doing computations with these numbers special care is required.
32.1 You may have wondered why the ratio of two measurements such as 12 is expressed as 2.7 not as 2.68 or 2.675.The numbers of digits used in a measurement have some significance regarding the quality of measuring instruments.
In this unit we will aim at the meaning and usage of approximate numbers.
We will also learn about the techniques of computations with these numbers.
These techniques are of basic importance in calculating the results of experiments that we will do later.
The mastery of these techniques is therefore, essential at this stage.
In the next unit we will study errors, which arise due to defects in measuring instruments, fluctuations in the quantity to be measured and several other reasons.
We will also learn how these errors are propagated and how the final results of an experiment are expressed.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit you should be able to, • observe that all measurements are inexact and are expressed in numbers resulting from approximations or approximate numbers • distinguish between precision and accuracy • express a measurement in scientific notation • add, subtract, multiply and divide approximate numbers 3.1 ERRORS: EXPRESSING THE RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS We are familiar with at least two reasons why all measurements are inexact.
Firstly, the measuring instrument itself, such as the zero error, causes error.
Secondly, error can be due to limitations of human judgement and perception, such as in aligning the end of a rod to be measured with the zero of the centimetre scale.
To better appreciate the inexact nature of measurement let us reflect on the process of measurement of length.
Let us obtain a `perfect' centimetre scale, which has NOUN 25PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I clear and equal marking of millimetres.
We desire to measure the length of three arrows A, B and C (Fig.
3.1).
Fig .3.1 Let us suppose that we are able to perfectly align the tails of the arrows with zero marking on the scale.
Of course, this is impossible to achieve in practice, but let us assume it to gain an insight into the process of measurement.
In order to measure the length of these arrows we look at the arrowheads.
The head of arrow A is closer to the 4.3 cm mark th ri to the 4.2 cm mark.
We will report the length of arrow A as 4.3 cm to the nearest millimetre.
Let us now measure the length of arrow B.
The heads of arrow B is closer to 4.3 cm mark than to the 4.4 cm mark.
Therefore, we will also report its length as 4.3 cm to the nearest millimetre or simply 4.3 cm.
Similarly the length of arrow C would be reported as 4.3 cm.
Thus the lengths of all arrows whose tails are aligned with zero marking, and whose heads lie in the range Rl and R2, would be reported as 4.3 cm.
We can conclude that a measurement which is reported as 4.3 cm (which is in the middle of RIR2) might possibly be in error by 0.05 cm (or one-half of the unit of measure which is 0.1 cm) or less.
Thus in the measurement 4.3 cm the last digit is in error.
We will, therefore, report measurements in such a manner that only the last digit will have error.
3.1.1 POSSIBLE ERROR AND PRECISION We have seen that the maximum possible error, barring any mistake in measuring, in a measurement is 1/2 of the unit of measurement.
The possible error is thus due to inherent imprecision in measuring devices.
The measurements having less possible error are more precise.
Since possible error is proportional to the unit of measure the instruments having smaller units of measure will give more precise measurement.
A measurement reported to one hundredth of a centimetre, such as 5.32 cm is more precise than a measurement reported to one tenth of a centimetre, such as 5.3 cm.
Self Assessment Question 1 Consider the following pairs of measurement.
Indicate which measurement in each pair is more precise.
NOUN 26PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I a.
17.9 cm or 19.87 cm b.
16.5 s or 3.21 s c. 20.56 °C or 32.22 °C SOLUTION (a) 19.87 cm (b) 3.21 s (c) Equally precise 3.1.2 RELATIVE ERROR AND ACCURACY So far we have considered measurement of nearly equal lengths with emphasis on precision.
Let us now consider measurement of much different lengths.
Suppose, two measurements yield 3.2 cm and 98.6 cm using the same metre stick.
The possible error in both of these measurements is equal to 0.05 cm but the 98.6 cm is much bigger than measurement 3.2 cm.
Would you say that the 98.6 cm is more accurate?
How would you compare the accuracy of measurement such as 7.4 s and 98 s?
In order to compare such measurements we define relative error as the ratio of possible error to the total measurement.
In the table 1.0 below we have computed the relative error in some measurement.
(The exact method of expressing the relative error will be discussed in section 1.5) Table 1.0 Measurement Unit of measure Possible error Relative error 3.2 cm 0.1 cm 0.05 cm 0.02 98.6 cm 0.1 cm 0.05 cm 0.0005 7.4 s 0.1 s 0.05 s 10.007 98 s 1 s 0.5 s 0.005 *Relative error is the ratio of possible error to the total measurement Let us compare measurements 3.2 cm and 98.6 cm.
Both have equal unit of measure and are therefore equally precise.
But the measurement 98.6 cm has less relative error (0.0005 compared to 0.02) and is therefore more accurate.
Comparison of measurements 7.4s and 98 s is more revealing.
The measurement 7.4 s is more precise than the measurement 98 s (possible errors 0.05 s and 0.5 s respectively) but less accurate (relative error 0.007 as compared to 0.005).
NOUN 27PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I You will therefore appreciate that a smaller measurement needs to be more precise for the same accuracy.
This is why when measuring the dimensions of a room, metre is used as unit of measure while in measuring inter-city distances the unit kilometre is used for the same accuracy.
Self Assessment Question 2 Consider the following pairs of measurements.
Indicate which measurement in each pair is more accurate.
a.
40.0 cm or 8.0 cm b.
0.85 m or 0.05 m SOLUTION (a) The relative errors are: 0.05 5 1 = = 40 4000 800 0.05 5 1 = = 8 800 160 Therefore the measurement 40.0 cm is more accurate.
(b) 0.85 m 3.2 SCIENTIFIC NOTATION In the system of measurement that we use (SI-system) a measurement is expressed in decimal numerals.
While measuring interatomic distances, we use very large,` numbers.
On the other hand, while measuring interstellar distances we use very large numbers.
In scientific notation these numbers are written as a number between one and ten multiplied by an integral power of ten.
For example, the diameter of the sun isl, 390, 000, 000 metres and the diameter of hydrogen atom is only 0.000000000106 metres.
In scientific notation we write the diameter of the sun as 1.39 x 109 m and the diameter of the hydrogen atom as 1.06 x 10-10 m. Self Assessment Question 3 The mass of a water molecule is 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 03 g. Express this in scientific notation.
SOLUTION 3 x 10-23 g NOUN 28PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I You have probably guessed that writing numbers in scientific notation will make computations easier.
This is because we can apply the laws of exponents readily.
3.3 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS We have seen in section 3.1.1 that a measurement reported as 5.32 cm is more precise than 5.3 cm.
The number of digits in these measurements are three and two, respectively.
This suggests that the number of digits used in reporting a measurement have some significance.
All non-zero digits are significant.
However, in measurements such as 0.05 m or 0.005 m, none of the zeros is significant.
The zeros to the left of the decimal are merely flags pointing to the decimal.
The other zeros are placed to help locate the decimal point.
Let us investigate this by calculating the possible error and relative errors as in the table 2.0 below.
Table 2.0 Measurement Unit of measurement Possible Error Relative error 0.5m 0.1 m 0.05m 0.1 0.05 m 0.01 m 0.005 m 0.1 0.005 m 0.001 m 0.0005 m 0.1 0.00005 m 0.00001 m 0.000005 m 0.1 We can see from this table that the unit of measure and the possible error in all the cases are different.
But the relative error is the same.
Therefore, we can assert that these zeros are not significant because they do not affect the relative error.
We can thus conclude that a digit is significant if and only if it affects the relative error.

The zeros are significant only if they come from a measurement.
But if fifth and sixth measurements are expressed in centimetres as 2500 cm and 2500000 cm respectively, the last two zeros should not be counted as significant as these have come as a result of multiplication by the factor 100 and not from measurement.
(c) Significant NOUN 30PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Self Assessment Question 5 From the above discussion justify that a measurement possessing greater number of significant digits has greater relative accuracy.
Sometimes we take a sequence of whole number measurements such as 32, 30, 28, 26.
All these measurements have two significant digits except the measurements 30.
In such special cases zero can be taken as significant without any ambiguity.
Self Assessment Question 6 Comment on the following: "The distance to the sun from the roof of a house (height 20 m) is 150 million kilometres.
Therefore the distance to the sun from ground is 15 million kilometres plus 20m" 3.4 COMPUTATIONS WITH APPROXIMATE NUMBERS In section 3.1, we have seen that the reported measurements have errors in the last digit.
For example, a measurement reported as 3.2, has error in the digit 2, which is indicated by placing a bar (-) over this digit.
In computing values of physical quantities from observed experimental data we have to do computations.
We will now establish some rules for expressing the results of basic operations with approximate numbers.
3.4.1 MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION Let us consider multiplication first.
We want to multiply 1.23 by 2.3.
At each step of the computational process we will put a bar (-) over a significant digit, which arises from computation with a digit containing error as below: _ _ 1.23 _ _ x 2.3 _ _ _ 0.369 _ 2.4 6 2.829 NOUN 31PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I We see that the product contains three digits, which contain errors.
Since we report the result in a number having only one digit containing error, we should _ round off the product to 2.8.
Thus the product has two significant digits.
This is also equal to the number of significant digits contained in a factor having _ the least number of significant digits, namely 2.3.
Therefore we formulate the following rule: RULE: The product (or quotient) of two measurements should be rounded off to contain as many significant digits as the measurement having fewer numbers of significant digits.
Self Assessment Question 7 Divide 2.1 by 1.54.
Round off the result according to the above rule.
SOLUTON 1.4 Let us consider the multiplication of the following numbers, which have already been rounded off to significant digits.
5.2865 x 3.8 x 19.62 = 20.0887 x 19.62 = 394.14029 which must be rounded of to 3.9 x 102.
We could have obtained the same result by rounding off these numbers first as shown below.
5.29 x 3.8 x 19.6 = 20.1 x 19.6 = 393.9 which rounds off to 3.9 x 102.
Here we have rounded off 20.102 (the product of 5.29 and 3.8) to 20.1 before multiplying it with 19.6.
We can generalise this as a labour saving rule.
Labour Saving Rule: Before multiplying (or dividing), round off the numbers to one more significant digit than (the number of significant digits) in the least precise factor.
NOUN 32PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Self Assessment Question 8 Divide 9.5362 by 3.2 SOLUTION 3.0 3.4.2 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION Let us study the process of addition given below: 2.135 _ 2.135 _ x 2.53 _ x 1.02 _ _ 5.685 The sum has two error-containing digits.
We, therefore, round off the sum to 5.69 so that it contains only one digit containing error.
Rounding off is necessary because the sum cannot be more precise than individual measurements.
We note that the sum 5.69 has the same unit of measure as the least precise addend.
Thus we formulate the following rule: Rule: While adding (or subtracting) approximate numbers, round off the sum (or difference) to the same unit of measure as the least precise measurement.
Se l f Assessment Question 9 Subtract 2.11 from 2.1546 SOLUTION 0.04 Self Assessment Question.
10.
Compute the sum of 2.1546 m, 2.11 m and 2.125 m. SOLUTION NOUN 33PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I HINT: In such cases we can use the following saving rule.
Labour Saving Rule: Before adding (or subtracting) round off the numbers so that they contain one more digit of precision than the number of precision digits in the least precise.
Thus the addends become 2.155 m, 2.11 m and 2.125 m. 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt that errors do occur in physical measurements.
All measurements are not exact.
They are expressed in numbers resulting from approximations.
Precision of a measurement is a function of possible error only while accuracy is related to relative error that occurs in a measurement.
Scientific measurements are usually expressed by using the scientific notations.
There are rules for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of measurements.
5.0 SUMMARY At the end of this unit you have learnt, • exact measurement is impossible.
The result of every measurement is expressed in numbers resulting from approximation such that only the last digit contains error.
In scientific notation a measurement is expressed as a decimal number between one and ten multiplied by powers of ten.
• possible error is only one-half the unit of measurement.
Precision is a function of possible error only.
• relative error is the ratio of possible error to total measurement.
Accuracy is related to relative error.
A digit is significant if and only if it affects the relative error • rule for multiplication (or division) The product (or quotient) of two measurements should be rounded off to contain as many significant digits as the measurement having fewer numbers of significant digits.

The results of measurements were expressed as approximate numbers.
We also learn about performing basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of approximate numbers NOUN 36PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I and expressing results using correct number of significant digits.
We assumed that the measuring instruments as well as the observers were perfect.
However, as you are aware, there can be defects in measuring instruments and also humans are not perfect.
If the environment is not perfectly controlled its changes will affect the object to be measured thereby introducing errors in measurements.
In this unit we will familiarise ourselves with these and other sources of errors.
We will also learn how to estimate and possibly eliminate or account for such errors.
In most of the physics experiments our objective is to determine relationship between physical quantities.
Therefore, we will estimate the errors in the measurement of various physical quantities and make efforts to determine valid relationships as mentioned above.
In the next couple of experimental write-ups we will apply our knowledge of errors and its propagation to actual measurements and deduce relationships.
We will first concentrate on the measurements of fundamental quantities such as mass, length and time, and then do experiments involving two or more of these quantities.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to • distinguish between random errors and systematic errors • eliminate to some extent the systematic errors • compute errors in the measurement of various physical quantities • analyse data by calculation and by plotting graphs to determine functional relationship • interpret the slope of a graph and to determine the value of certain physical quantities from the slope of a straight-line graph.
3.1 TYPES OF ERRORS Every measuring instrument has a limitation in that it cannot measure physical quantities smaller than a certain value known as the least count of instrument.
For example, a meter scale can measure only up to 1 mm (smallest division of the scale).
A vernier calliper can generally measure up to 0.1 mm whereas a spherometer and screw gauge can measure lengths up to 0.01 mm.
Similarly a thermometer usually has the least count of half a degree.
In addition to these limitations, which are inherent in a measuring device, there are other sources of error.
These arise due to changes in environment, faults in observational techniques, malfunctioning of measuring devices etc.
The NOUN 37PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I errors in any measurement can be classified into two broad headings namely - Systematic errors and Random errors.
Let us now study the causes of such errors, and see how they are eliminated or minimised.
3.1.1 SYSTEMATIC ERRORS The systematic errors, also called determinant errors, are due to causes which can be identified.
Therefore, these errors, in principle, can be eliminated.
Errors of this type result in measured values which are consistently too high or consistently too low.
Let us discuss these errors one by one.
(i) Zero Error In the case of vernier callipers, for example, when the jaws are in contact, the zero of the vernier may not coincide with the zero of the main scale.
The magnitude and sign of the `zero error' can be determined for the scale readings.
We can easily eliminate this error from the measurement by subtracting or adding the zero error.
(ii) Back lash Error While measuring a physical quantity there may be an error due to wear and tear in the instruments like screw gauge or spherometer due to defective fittings.
Such an error is called back lash error and can be minimised in a particular set of measurements by rotating the screw head in only one direction.
(iii) End Correction Sometimes the zero marking of the metre scale may be worn out.
Unless we are careful, this will lead to incorrect measurements.
We must therefore compensate for this by shifting our reference point.
(iv) Errors due to changes in the Instrument parameters Usually, in experiments involving electrical quantities, the value of the electrical quantities change during the course of the experiment due to heating or other causes.
For example, the value of the resistance of a wire will increase because of current passing through it.
This will lead to errors, which are generally difficult to calculate and compensate for.
To some extent this can be avoided by not allowing current to flow through the circuit while observations are not being taken.
NOUN 38PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I (v) Defective Calibration Occasionally instruments may not be properly calibrated leading to errors in the results of measurement.
This type of error is not easily detected and compensated for.
This is a manufacturer's defect and if possible the instrument should be calibrated against a standard equipment.
(vi) Faulty Observation This could be due to causes like parallax in reading a metre scale.
These errors are eliminable by using proper techniques.
3.1.3 RANDOM ERRORS You must have noticed that many times repeated measurements of the same quantity do not yield the same value.
The readings obtained show a scatter of values.
Some of those values are high while others are low.
This function is due to random errors whose possible sources are: (i) Observational These arise due to errors in judgment of an observer when reading a scale to the smallest division.
(ii) Environmental These arise due to causes like unpredictable fluctuations inline voltage, variation in temperature etc.
They could also be due to mechanical vibrations and wear and tear of the systems.
There could be a random spread of readings due to friction say, wear and tear of mechanical parts of a system.

NOUN 39PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Fig.
1 Set of measurements.
Each point indicates the result of a measurement SOLUTION 1(a) Unlike systematic errors, random errors can be quantified by statistical analysis.
Let us now learn to determine the size of such error.
3.2 DETERMINING SIZE OF ERROR When we measure a quantity it is important to take several readings.
It may be preferable that readings are taken by independent observer.
This has the advantage that bias of a single observer is eliminated.
The value obtained will indicate whether the data is scale limited or random.
An error analysis can be made to determine the size of error from these readings.
A typical set of values of a measurement is given below in table l. The quantity to be measured as a `true' value is independent of our measuring process.
But the imperfection of our measuring process prevents us from obtaining that value every time.
Which on of the values listed in table I would be `true' value?
It is impossible to tell that from the measurements because of this spread.
Under the circumstances the average A value can be quoted.
To get the average value we simply add up all the measurements and divide the sum by the total measurements.
As you can see from the table l, the average is 3.68.
Also notice that most of the data in table I deviates __ from the average d we first take the difference of each data from the average to __ get individual deviations d. These deviations are then added and their sum is divided by the number of observations to obtain d. As you can see from table 1 the average deviation in this case is 0.009.
NOUN 40PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Table 1 S/No Data Deviation (d) 1.
3.69 0.01 2.
3.67 0.01 3.

3.69 0.01 5.
3.68 0.0 6.
3.69 0.01 7.
3.66 0.02 8.
3.67 0.01 _ A = 3.68 d = 0.009 As you are aware, repeated measurements of the same quantity yield results with better precision.
A measure of this precision index S whose definition (without proof) is _ S d = √n _ where d is the average derivation and n is the number of observations.
The precision index S is a measure of uncertainty of average.
Using the data of table l, the precision index is S d 0.009 0.003 = = = √n √8 Thus the final result can be expressed as A ± S. In this case the result of random data analysis gives 3.68 ± 0.003.
We can see that this error is much less than the possible error, which is ± 0.005.
Thus in such cases we will consider the possible error only.
Self Assessment Question 2 The measurement of the length of a table yields the following data.
11=135.0cm,/2=136.5cm,13=134.0 cm, /4=134.5 cm Calculate (a) the average value and (b) precision index.
How does the precision index compare with possible error?
How will you express the final result?
NOUN 41PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I SOLUTION (a) 135.0 cm (b) 0.375 cm 3.3 PROPAGATION OF ERROR We have so far learnt how to determine the error in the measurement of a quantity, which can be measured directly.
In actual practice, however, we determine values of a quantity from the measurements of two or more independent quantities.
In such cases the error in the value of the quantity to be determined will depend on the errors in other independent quantities.
In other words, the error will `propagate'.
The actual analysis of propagation of error is beyond the scope of this course.
We shall therefore, quote some rules which can be used in our laboratory.
3.3.1 ERROR PROPAGATION IN ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION What will be the error, in quantity E, defined by E = x + y + z ?
Let us take the differential of this quantity, we get δE = δx + δy + δz if the error is small compared to the measurement we can replace the differential by `delta' to get δE = δx + δy + δz which is simply the sum of errors in x, y and z.
It, therefore, is the maximum error in E. Statical analysis shows that a better approximation is δE = (δx)2 + (δy)2 + (δz )2 We only consider the magnitude of errors in the above calculation.
Therefore, the error in the quantity (x + y - z) will also be the same.
SOLVED EXAMPLE: Let the measured value of two lengths be L + δL = 1.746 ± 0.010 m l l L + δL = 1.507 ± 0.010 m 2 2 The error in the quantity L = L + L will be 1 2 δL = (0.010 m)2 + (0.0l0 m )2 = 0.014 m 3.3.2 ERROR PROPAGATION IN MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION If a quantity E = A x B and the result of measurement of A & B is A ± δA and B ± δB then what will be the error δE in E?
Here if we take differentials we get dE = B dA + A dB Dividing by E = AB and changing differentials by `deltas' we get NOUN 42PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I δE δA δB = + E A B Self Assessment Question 3 Take logarithm of E = AB and then differentiate to show that δE δA δB = + E A B which is generally known as the logarithmic error.
SOLUTION E = AB Taking logarithm on both sides log E = log A + log B Differentiating partially The statistical analysis, however, gives the following better result of the fractional error in E. δE = E δA 2 + δB 2 A B RULE 1: When independent measurements are multiplied or divided the fractional error in error in the result is the square root of the sum of squares of fractional errors in individual quantities.
SOLVED EXAMPLE: In an experiment we calculate velocity from measurement of distance and time.
If the distance is S ± δS = 0.63 ± 0.02 m δS = 0.03 S and time is T ± δT = 1.71 ± 0.10 δT = 0.06 T Then the velocity (V) V = S = 0.368 MS-1 T The fractional error in V is given by NOUN 43PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I δV = V δS 2 + δT 2 0.07 = S T δV = 0.368 ms-1 x 0.07 = 0.02 ms-1 Thus the final result becomes V ± δV = 0.37 ± 0.02 ms-1 3.3.3 ERROR PROPAGATION IN OTHER MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS Errors in exponential quantity: Let us first consider a special case where a quantity appears with an exponent.
For example, S = A2 = A x A.
Here the two numbers multiplied together are identical and hence not independent.
The rule mentioned above does not apply.
Detailed analysis shows that logarithmic error gives a good estimate.
Taking the logarithm of the above equation we get, log S = 2 log A on differentiation and changing differentials to `deltas' we get δS 2 δA = S A Therefore, the fractional error in A2 would be twice the error in A, the fractional error in A3 will be 3 times the fractional error in A, and the fractional error in √A will be 1/2 the fractional error in A.
RULE: The fractional error in the quantity An is given by n times the fractional error in A.
EXAMPLE: Suppose two measurements of mass are M ± δM = 0.743 ± 1 l 0.005 kg and M ± δM = 0.384 ± 0.005 kg.
2 2 Determine the value of M = 2M + 5M along with δM.
l 2 What will be the error in (M + M )2 and (M - M )-3. l 2 l 2 HINT: The error in 2M is 2 δM and in 5M is 5 δM .
1 1 2 2 Thus error in 2M + 5M is δM = (2δM )2 + (5δM )2 1 2 1 2 Error in (M + M )2 = 2 (δM )2 + (δM )2 1 2 1 2 Error in (M - M )-3 = 3 (δM )2 + (δM )2 1 2 1 2 NOUN 44PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Similarly in other mathematical operations and deducing results from graphs (about this you will learn in the next subsection) the flowing rule is used.
RULE: The error in the result is found by determining how much change occurs in the result when the maximum error occurs in the data.
EXAMPLE: Let us compute the error in the sine of 30° ± 0.5°.
Using the logarithmic tables we get, sin 30° = 0.5, sin 30.5° = 0.508, sin 29.5° = 0.492 The difference between sin 30° and sin 30.5° is 0.008, and the difference between sin 30° and sin 29.5° is also 0.008.
Thus the error in sin 30° would be ± 0.008.
Self Assessment Question 4 Determine the error of sine of 90°, when the error in the angle is 0.5°.
Compare your result with that of the example above.
SOLUTION (i) sin 90° = 1.000, sin 90.5° = cos 0.5° = 1.000, sin 89.5° = 1.000 In this case error in sin 90° is zero.
3.3.4 ERROR PROPAGATION IN GRAPHING Very often we can better visualise the functional relationship between two physical quantities by plotting a graph between them.
This is another useful way of handling experimental data because the values of some quantities can be obtained from the slope.
While plotting a graph we will use the following guidelines: 1.
A brief title may be given at the top 2.
Label the axes with the names of the physical quantities being presented along with units.
It is customary to plot the independent variable (the quantity which is varied during the experiment at one's will) on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis (the dependent variable is the one that varies as a result of change in the independent variable).
We would write to the name of the variable represented on each axis along with units in which they are measured.
3.
We should choose the range of the scales on the axis so that the points are suitably spread out on the graph paper and not cramped into one NOUN 45PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I corner.
Check for the minimum and maximum values of the data that has to be plotted.
We may then round off these two numbers to slightly less than the minimum and slightly more than the maximum.
Their difference may be divided by the number of divisions on the graph paper.
For example, if we are to plot 5.2 and 17.7 it would be convenient to allow the scale to run from 5 to 20 rather than from 0 to 18.
Each set of data points is indicated by a point within a circle on the graph paper and the error is shown by using bars above and below this point as shown in fig.
2.
The graphed data show that velocity V is the linear function of time T. We recall that the general equation of a straight line is y = mx + c where m is the slope of line and c the vertical intercept in the value of y when x = 0.
From the graph we can thus write V = aT + V By comparing the above 0. equation we can conclude that the slope of the graph gives the acceleration and the intercept gives the velocity V at T =0.
From the graph V = 0.32 o o ms-1.
To determine the slope we consider two points on the straight line, which are well separated.
Then, a = Slope = V = 2.35 - 0.40 (ms -1 ) = 0.20 ms -2 T 10.0 - 0.5 (s) In the above example, we have plotted the variable V, which is a linear function of T in a linear graph paper.
In some experiments we may get data where the relationship between the measured variable is not linear.
Suppose a man gets a salary of N 20, 000.00 on the 1st of every month and he decides that each day he will spend half the money he has with him on that day.
Then the amount of money, which the man will have over a period of first seven days of any month, will be given as in table 2.
NOUN 46PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I TABLE 2 Day of any month Money left with the man (M) N K x 102 1st 200.00 2nd 100.00 3rd 50.00 4th 25.00 5th 12.50 6th 6.25 7th 3.12 8th 1.56 Let us plot these data on a linear graph paper.
The paper will be of the type shown in fig.
3.
Look at the graph carefully.
You will find that seven of the ten experimental points are clustered together near the bottom right-hand corner of the graph.
The shape of the curve we have drawn also involves a bit of guesswork.
Therefore, we have to find some method so that these data can be plotted in a better way.
Fig.
3 Graphical representation of Table 2 Try to recollect what you used to do in school when you used to come across data like this, which range over a few orders of magnitude or having big gaps between the points.
We will tell you, in such cases you used to take the logarithm of the data and then plot those data in a linear graph paper.
When you did this, you must have found that the result was a straight line.
So let us NOUN 47PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I take the logarithm of the data of table 2 and tabulate them as shown in table 3.

You obtain a graph in which points are more clearly spaced evenly and hence you can more easily draw a straight line through the points.
Fig.
4 Graphical representation of Table 3 NOUN 48PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I You might have realised that working out the log values for each data is tedious and it also introduces another step, which may introduce error between the data and the graph.
Therefore, to plot such a data we use a graph paper called semi-logarithmic or log-linear graph paper where the lines on one axis have been drawn in a logarithmic fashion.
On a semi-log paper (see the graph paper of fig.
5) the horizontal scale is an ordinary one, in which the large division are divided into tenths and each division has the same size.
The vertical scale is a logarithmic scale (is automatically takes logarithms of data plotted), in which each power of ten or decade (also called frequency) corresponds to the same length of scale.
In each decade, the divisions become progressively compressed towards the upper end.
Now to the semi-log graph paper we plot the data of table 1.
We obtain a straight line as shown in fig.
5.
If you compare fig.
4 & 5 you will see that the points plotted on semi-log paper are distributed on a linear graph paper.
A question may strike your mind that how to calculate the slope of the straight line of fog.
5?
Also what is the equation of the straight line?
Let log M be represented by y and by t then we have a straight line graph of y against t. Let the question be represented as y = b + kt Fig.
5 Representation of Table 3 graphically on semi-log paper NOUN 49PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Where b is the intercept of the line on the y-axis and k the slope of the line.
We can find the values of b and k from the graph as follows.
When t = 0, M = 200 then log M =log 200=2.30=y 2.30=b+0 or b=2.30 ...y=2.30+kt When t = 7th day, M = 1.56 and log M = log 1.56 = 0.193 = y Putting these values in equation (1) we get 0.193=2.30+7k .'.
The slope k = - 2.1 = -0.3 7 and the equation of the straight line is y = 2.3-0.3t (2) From the graph of fig.
5 or in other words from equation (2) can you find the equation of the curve plotted in fig.
3?
Let the value of M at t = 0 be denoted as M then equation (2) becomes o log M = log M + kt O or log M - log Mo = kt or Log M kt = M O or M 10 = kt M O or M = M 10kt O or M = 200 x 10-0.3t (3) This is the equation of curve plotted in fig.

It tells us that the money is decreasing logarithmically (also called exponentially) with each day.
In science, you will come across many logarithmic or exponential relations of the form of equation (3).
In such cases it would be convenient to plot the data on semilogarithmic graph paper because the graph will be convenient to plot the data on semilogarithmic graph because the graph will be a straight line if the relationship is logarithmic.
Also the slope of the line (which may give you the value of any physical constant) can be read simply and directly from the graph.
NOUN 50PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I Sometimes we find that we wish to plot a graph where both variables range over several powers of ten.
For example, you know that according to Keplar's law, the semi-major axis of the orbit of a planet (R) is related to its period (time for one revolution around the sun) T by the following power-law relation: R 3 = kT 2 (4) Where k is another constant.
If you consider the experimental data that shows how the quantity T depends on quantity R you will observe that R varies by two orders of magnitude and T varies by three orders of magnitude.
In other words the experiment data follows equation (4).
For a moment, suppose you do not know the exact relationship between the variables T and R. The you can suppose that R = kT n (5) where n is another constant.
Using the conventional method to find the value of n, you will take logarithm of equation (5) as follows: log R = log k + n log T Now you will plot log R vs. log T on a linear graph paper.
The slope of straight line obtained will give the value of exponent n. But again, as mentioned above, taking logarithm of each experimental date is rather tedious so it would be convenient to plot both the variables T and R on a logarithmic scale where the lines on both axes are drawn in a logarithmic fashion.
A log- log graph is shown in fig.
6.
The points lie upon a straight line.
The slope of the straight line will give the exponent (n) of the powerlaw relation and hence the exact relationship between R and T will be found out.
To determine the error in the value of the slope of the straight line drawn in any graph paper (linear or semi-log or log - log) we draw two dashed lines representing the greatest and the least possible slopes which reasonably fit the data as shown in fig.
2.
Thus the error in the slope is defined as Error in slope = maximum slope - minimum slope 2 Thus from the graph we get the error in the slope as δa = 0.23 - 0.19 ms -2 = 0.02 ms -2 2 Thus the experimental value of acceleration from the graph is NOUN 51PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I a ± δa=0.20 ± 0.02 ms-2.
Similarly the error in intercept = (intercept of minimum slope line - intercept of maximum slope line)/2 -1 δV = (0.45 - 0.17) 0.14 ms-1 O ms = 2 Fig 6 3.4 USES OF π It appears that most of our students are under the impression that the value of π is equal to 22 7 exactly.
Unfortunately many books writers also have contributed to perpetuate and establish this false idea by setting numerical problems with data 22 cooked up that using π = 7, the factor always happily cancels out and the simplification becomes very easy.
However, in the real world the values of actual physical quantities are not such as to facilitate cancellation with 7.
Also, we may as well acknowledge that the value of π cannot be expressed exactly in terms of any whole number.
The value of π = 22 7 is one of the many approximations that can be used.
In fact, a better approximation is 355 = 3.1415928.
Compare this 113 NOUN 52PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I with the calculator value π = 3.141592654 and 22 = 3.14286.
It may be noted that the value of 22 deviates from the more accurate value from the calculator 7 in the third decimal place; if we round it off to 5-digit accuracy, π = 3.1415 (from calculator), whereas the approximations 355 = 3.1416 and 22 = 3.1429.
113 7 For practical purposes at undergraduate level, the most convenient and comparatively more accurate thing to do will be to remember π = 3.142; log π = 0.4972; π2 = 9.870; log π2 = 0.9943 Wherever the value of 7r is to be used in our calculations, the above values prove fruitful.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you have been able to distinguish between random errors and systematic errors when measuring physical quantities and know Systematic errors to some extent, can be eliminated.
Errors in the measurement of various physical quantities can also be computed.
When graphs are used to show relationship between certain physical quantities, they can also be used to determine the errors in the calculation of slopes.

EXPERIMENT 1 Determination of acceleration due to gravity by means of the Simple Pendulum.
AIM: To determine the value of acceleration due to gravity by using the Simple Pendulum.
APPARATUS • Small pendulum bob made up of lead or brass • Cotton thread • Split cork • Meter rule • Stop watch • Retort stand and clamp NOUN 54PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I THEORETICAL BACKGROUND The motion of a simple pendulum is described as being a simple harmonic motion.
A simple harmonic motion (SHM) is defined thus: When an object moves to and fro in such a way that its acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement and is always directed to its equilibrium position, then, that object is said to perform a simple harmonic motion.
The simple pendulum has its equilibrium position at point B.
If the mass of the pendulum bob is m and length ℓ.
If it is displaced to point A such that the angle of displacement Ө is small and released, the bob will oscillate i.e.
move to and fro.
The restoring force F = mg sin Ө Where, m = mass of bob and g = acceleration due to gravity.
From the second law of motion, F = ma –mg sin Ө .'.
a = -g sin Ө where, a = acceleration The negative sign indicates that the acceleration does not increase perpetually, it increases and decreases as it moves to and fro.

If the height of the room or laboratory is H and the height of the bob above the floor is h, therefore the length of the simple pendulum (ℓ) measured from the ceiling H is ℓ=H – h We can now write the period of oscillation T as T = 2π H - h NOUN 60PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I g Squaring both sides of the equation will produce T2 = 4 π 2 (H – h) g \ T2 = 4 π 2 = H - 4 π 2 h g g If we therefore plot the values of T2 against h we will obtain a graph similar to a linear graph represented by the equation y = c - mx where, c = the intercept when x = 0 -m = slope of the graph Similarly from T2 = 4π 2 = H - 4π 2 h g g the slope of the graph m = - 4π 2 g The intercept of the graph on the x-axis i.e.

T. (W + W) w W. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND R Fr.
Q. T S. .
W When an object Q is on a surface S, the vertical forces acting on it are the weight W and the normal reaction R acting in opposite directions to each other.
The resultant of these two forces is zero because there is no relative motion downwards or upwards from the surface S. However if a horizontal force T is brought to play on Q, there is a limiting value of T that will make the body Q to move.
This limiting value is equal to the frictional force Fr that will oppose the motion.
The coefficient of friction p is an associated property of the two surfaces in contact and it is defined as m = Frictional Force (Fr) Normal Reaction (R) NOUN 79PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I But the normal reaction R is equal to the weight of the object (W), which is equal to (mg) i.e.
the product of the mass of Q and the acceleration due to gravity (g) \m = Fr Fr = W mg .'.
Fr = m W where, W = weight of wood B B Fr = m m g where, m = mass of the wood B B But the frictional force (Fr) is equal to the limiting value of the tension in the string (T) that is equal to W.

The inclined plane is made up of two wooden boards hinged at one end.
On top of the upper board is placed a wooden block.
By gradually raising the upper board an angle Ө is made between the upper and lower boards.
The wooden board is then made just to glide down the upper board through the resolved weight (WSinӨ) of the wooden block.
The angle Ө, which enables the wooden block just to glide, is then noted.
The limiting frictional force (Fr) is equal to WSinӨ.
The normal reaction R on the inclined plane is WCosӨ.
Hence, the coefficient of friction p, is defined as m WSin Ө = WCos Ө \m = Sin Ө Cos Ө Sin Ө = m Cos Ө \m = Tan Ө Attaching different weights on the wooden block can vary the normal reaction of the wooden block.
Corresponding angles of inclination Ө, just to make the wooden block move can then be determined.
Thus by plotting the graph of SinӨ on vertical axis against CosӨ on the horizontal axis, we can then determine the slope m, which is equal to the coefficient of static friction.

NOUN 85PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I AIM: To determine the relative density of kerosene or any other liquid by using the specific gravity bottle.
APPARATUS • The specific gravity bottle • Kerosene • Methylated spirit • Balance and weights • Beaker of water DIAGRAM THEORETICAL BACKGROUND The relative density of a liquid is defined as Relative Densty = Density of the liquid Density of water mass of the liquid = volume of the liquid mass of water volume of water = m ÷ m 1 2 V V 1 2 = m х m 1 2 V V 1 2 = m x V 1 2 m V 2 Where, m = mass of liquid l m = mass of water 2 V = volume of liquid l V = volume of water 2 NOUN 86PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I If V =V 1 2 \ Relative Density = m 1 m 2 That is the relative density of the liquid is defined as the ratio of the mass of the liquid over the mass of an equal volume of water.
The volumes of the liquid and the water are made to be equal by using the specificgravity bottle, which has a constant volume V. The special stopper made for the bottle helps to achieve this.
The stopper has a narrow opening to ensure that the volume of the liquid contained in the bottle is constant.
If the mass of the bottle when empty = m l And the mass of bottle + kerosene = m 2 And the mass of bottle + water = m 3 :.mass of kerosene = (m - m) 2 l and mass of equal volume of water = (km - m) 3 l .

If there is any, remove the stopper add more liquid and then reinsert the stopper carefully NOUN 87PHY 191 GENERAL PHYSICS PRACTICAL I • Be careful not to warm the bottle by the heat of the hand.
This may make the liquid expand and that will not provide the desired constant volume.
Handle the bottle with care.
