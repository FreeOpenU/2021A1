6 Introduction PHY 001: Access Physics is a two-semester, 6 credit-hour foundation (remedial) course in Physics.
It is a remedial course offered to students admitted to the School of Science and Technology who are deficient in Physics at the Senior Secondary School level and for whom Physics is compulsory to their programme of study.
The course will be done in the first semester simultaneously with other listed courses in the programme on offer.
Before registration into second semester is allowed, the student must have remedied the Access Physics course.
The examination grade obtained in the remedial course does not count in the GPA of the student at the end of the semester.
As a foundation course meant for students who are deficient in Physics the communicative approach is used.
The material has been developed to stimulate and sustain interest in the study of Physics in Nigeria.
This is done in recognition that most students dread Physics; resulting in poor performance and an increasing low enrolment in Physics in tertiary institutions in Nigeria despite the desire for technological development.
No compulsory prerequisite is required for this course.
It is, however, essential that you revise the Physics topics of the JSS Integrated Science Course to acquaint yourself with what to expect in the related concepts and principles from the course.
The course guide tells you briefly what the course is all about, what course materials you will be using and how you can work your way through these materials.
It gives you some guidance on your Tutor- Marked Assignments.
You will have detailed information on your Tutor-Marked Assignments in the separate Assignment file.
There is/are self-assessment exercise(s) within the body of a unit and/or at the end of ivPHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS each unit.
The exercise(s) is/are an overview of the unit to help you assess yourself at the end of every unit.
What You will Learn in this Course This course contains several modules.
These modules cover the scope and depth of the Physics content level stipulated for the Senior Secondary School programme in conformity with the JCC decision.
Mathematics is used to clarify the Physics concepts or principles under consideration as much as possible.
Physics phenomena, facts, laws, definitions, concepts, theories and skills appropriate to Physics permeate the entire modules.
The modules dealt with scientific vocabularies, terminologies and conventions including symbols, quantities and units.
They described broadly the use of scientific apparatus, including techniques of operation and aspects of safety.
They further make you familiar with scientific and technological applications with their social, economic and environmental applications.
In addition, they expose you to information handling, experimental and problem -solving techniques.
You will at the end of this course not only have remedied your deficiency in Physics at the Senior Secondary School level but also have laid a solid foundation for further studies in Physics and Physics related courses.
I believe you will find the course interesting and motivating.

It permeates the entire course and you will come across and in fact use the concepts in subsequent sections.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • discuss the significance of units in physical measurements • distinguish between fundamental and derived quantities • determine the dimension of at least 5 physical quantities • explain the concepts of scalars and vectors using specific examples • resolve a vector in a given direction • resolve any number of vectors into two components at right angles to each other • solve simple problems involving vectors using various methods.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Units and Dimensions 3.1.1 Units A unit has to be defined before any kind of measurement can be made.
You are aware that different systems of units have been used in the past.
However, the system which has gained universal acceptance is the System International d' Unites usually called S. I.
Units (adopted in 1960).
The S.1 Unit is based on the metre as the unit of length; the kilogram (kg) as the Unit of Mass; the second (s) as the Unit of Time, the ampere (A) the unit of current and the Kelion (K) the unit of temperature.
Other Units are given in Tables 1.1 and 1.2.
3.1.2 Dimensions We often use the term dimension in Physics to describe the relationship between a physical quantity and the fundamental quantities expressed in terms of the symbols M, L, T of the fundamental quantities mass, length and time respectively.
You should note that physical quantities can either be dimensional or dimensionless.
2PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Dimensionless Quantities do not depend on the system of unit in which they are measured.
That simply means that they have no units.
Examples are angles and their trigonometric ratios (ratio of two length); relative density (or specific gravity), (ratio of two densities); efficiency of a machine (ratio of two quantities of work).
• Dimensional Quantities on the other hand depend on the magnitude of the fundamental units in which they are measured and are different in different unit systems.
If you now consider that the fundamental quantities are denoted by the symbols M, L, and T, you will be able to determine (derive) the dimensions of Physical quantities by your careful study of these illustrations.
i) Area (length x breadth) has dimension of L x L = L2 ii) Volume (length x breath x depth) has dimensions of L x L x L = L3 iii) Velocity (distance ÷ time) has dimension of L ÷ T = LT-1 iv) Density (mass ÷ volume) has dimensions of M ÷ L2 = ML-2 v) Acceleration (velocity ÷ time) has dimensions of L ÷ T2 = LT-2 vi) Momentum (mass x velocity) has dimensions of (M x L) ÷ T = MLT-1 vii) Pressure (force ÷ area) = (mass x acceleration) ÷ area has dimension of MLT-2 ÷ L2 = MT-2 L-1 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Determine the dimensions of force, work, surface tension, (force per unit length) and power (rate of doing work).
3.2 Fundamental and Derived Quantities and their Units 3.2.1 Fundamental Quantities and their Units You may have observed that there are two types of physical quantities.
One group of such quantities keeps occurring again and again.
They are independent of others and cannot be defined in terms of other quantities.
You may also have noticed that most other quantities depend on them.
This group of quantities are called fundamental quantities.
• Fundamental quantities are the basic quantities upon which other quantities depend • Fundamental units are the basic units upon which other units depend.
They are the units of the fundamental quantities.
3PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • You will now study Table 1.1 below showing the fundamental quantities and their units.
Table 1.1: Examples of Fundamental Quantities and their Units Quantity Unit Unit abbreviation Length Metre m Time Second s Mass Kilogram kg Electric Current Ampere A Temperature Kelvin K Luminous Intensity Candela cd Amount of substance Mole mol The unit abbreviation is a capital letter when it refers to the name of a person e.g.
Ampere (A) or Kelvin (K).
• Can you think of any other quantity that would belong to the above?
Give reasons for your answer.
3.2.2 Derived Quantities and their Units At this point you may have realised that all the quantities with the exception of the seven fundamental quantities belong to this group.
• Derived quantities are those quantities derived by some simple combination of the fundamental quantities.
• Derived units are the units of the derived quantities.
• Example of derived quantities, their derivation and their units are summarised in Table 1.2.
Table 1.2: Examples of Derived Quantities and their Units 4PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Derived Quantity Derivation Derived Unit Area (A) Length x breadth m2 Volume (V) Length x breadth x height m3 Density mass kgm-3 volume Velocity (V) displacement ms-1 time Acceleration (a) change in velocity MS -2 time Force (F) Mass x acceleration Newton; N Energy or Work (W) Force x distance Joule, J (Nm) Power (P) work Watt, W (J S-1) time Momentum Mass x velocity kg.

They are sometimes called supplementary units.
• For many measurements, you will realise that the units may be too big or too small and so multiples and submultiples of the basic units are used.
These are formed by using the following prefixes shown in Table 1.3.
Table 1.3: Multiple and Submultiples of Units with their Prefixes and Symbols 5PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Submultiples Example Prefix Symbol 0.1 or 10-1 decimetre = 10-1 m deci d 0.01 or 10-2 centimetre = 10-2 m centi c 0.001 or 10-3 millimetre = 10-3 m milli m 0.000001 or 10-6 microfarad = 10-6 f micro m 0.000000001 or 10-7 nanosecond nano n 0.000000000001 or picoampere pico p Multiples Example Prefix Symbol 101 decametre = 101 m deca Da 102 hectormetre= 102m hector H 1000 or 103 kilometre = 103 m kilo K 1,000,000 or 106 megawatts = 106W mega M 1,000,000,000 or 109 gigaherttiga giga G 1,000,000,000,000 tera T or1012 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Distinguish between: a.
Fundamental and derived quantities; and b.
Fundamental and derived units.
3.3 Scalars and Vectors 3.3.1 Concept of Scalars Scalars quantities are those quantities which have only magnitude or numerical value but no direction, examples are length or distance, mass, volume, density, work, time, speed, temperature and energy.
3.3.2 Concept of Vectors Though we know that many measurable physical, quantities have magnitude or numerical value as well as direction, such quantities are not completely described unless their magnitudes and directions are specified.
These groups of quantities are known as vector quantities.
Examples are: Weight, displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, electric field etc.
Vector quantities are those quantities which have both magnitude (and size) and direction.
3.3.3 Distinction between Scalars and Vectors 6PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS You can distinguish between scalars and vectors by noting that: • whereas scalars have only magnitude or numerical value, vectors have both magnitude and direction; • a scalar can be described completely by indicating only its magnitude whereas a vector can only be specified completely when both its magnitude and direction are included; and • Scalars add just like ordinary numbers but the addition of vectors must be carried out with due regard to their direction.
3.3.4 Vector Representation Here we consider the various ways of representing a vector.
• In a diagram, a vector is represented by an arrow.
The arrow is drawn in the direction of the vector.
The arrow head gives the sense of direction.
Using a scale, the length of the arrow is chosen to be operational to the magnitude of the vector.
ﬁ ﬁ A O B ﬁ C O O Fig.
1.1: Diagrammatic representation of vectors • In print, a vector is represented by a bold face symbol such as A and V. The magnitude of the vector A is A or (cid:247) A(cid:247) • In writing, it is usual to put an arrow over the symbol to denote a vector quantity e.g., ﬁ A, ﬁ B, ﬁ C, in Fig.
1.1 3.4 Addition and Subtraction of Scalars and Vectors 3.4.1 Addition and Subtraction of Scalars You have been informed that the process of adding scalars is straight forward.
They add just like ordinary numbers by ordinary algebraic methods.
Examples: (i) 5 cm3 + 7 cm3 = 12 cm3; (ii) 5 kg - 2 kg = 3 kg 7PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 5 km/h 10km/h 5 km/h 10 km/h 15km/h Fig.
1.2: Scalar addition 3.4.2 Addition and Subtraction of Vectors Unlike the scalars, in adding or subtracting vectors, you have to consider both sizes and directions of the vector quantities under consideration.
• Resultant vector A single vector which has the same effect as two or more vectors acting in the same direction is called the resultant vector.
Addition of vectors gives rise to a resultant vector.
Examples Consider the following examples i) Vectors acting in a straight line ii) Vectors acting in the same direction Suppose a man walks 2 km due East and his wife walks 3 km due East.
What is the resultant vector (velocity)?
Solution Let us represent the magnitude by the scale I cm = l km; and direction yan arrow head.
Therefore, the man covering the distance of 2 km and his wife 3 km both due East would be represented thus: Man his wife A B 2 cm 3 cm The resultant vector (R) would take into consideration the magnitude and directions of both journeys as shown below: ﬁ ﬁ ﬁ B C + A 2cm 3 cm = 5 cm (2km) (3km) = 5km due East 8PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.3: Resultant vector (in one direction) b) Vectors acting in opposite directions Suppose the man in our example above walks due East while his wife walks due West, the resultant vector would then be as shown in the diagram below: ﬁ ﬁ ﬁ B R + 2 cm A 3 cm 1 cm (2km) (3km) = 1 km due west Fig.
1.4: Resultant vector (in opposite direction) 3.4.3 Vectors Inclined at an Angle Let us consider a man starting a journey from a point A and walks 3 km due North, then he turns and walks 5 km due East.
What would be his Resultant Vector (displacement)?
• To find the resultant vector, you would either employ the Pythagoras rule (because the vectors are at right angle to each other) or by scale drawing.
Solution (i) Using Pythagoras rule N α A Scale l cm: l km Fig.
1.5: Resultant vector using the Pythagoras rule • The magnitude of the resultant is given by: ﬁ ﬁ ﬁ 9PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS A E 2= A N2+NE2 \ R = (cid:214) 32+52 = (cid:214) 9+25 = 34 = 5.83 km • To obtain the direction (angle ) we use the relation opp 5 tan  - = = 1.667 Adj 3  = tan -1 1.667 = 59.04o • The result of this calculation implies that the resultant vector is 5.83km, North 59.04° East.
(ii) Using scale drawing Here you should use a scale of say l cm to represent l km to find the resultant vector following the directives given below: • draw 3 cm due North to represent 3 km due North; • draw 5 cm due East from the head of 3 km due North to represent the 5 km; • join the tail of 3 kmN to the head of 5 kmE; • using your ruler, measure the distance AC and convert the result by the scale used; and find the direction by measuring the angle (cid:181) using your protractor.
α R = 5.8 cm x l km = 5.8 km  = 59°±1° Fig.
1.6: Resultant vector using scale drawing • Note that in general there are three methods of adding or compounding vectors inclined at angles to each other for the purpose of finding the resultant.
These are: 10PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (i) the parallelogram method; (ii) the analytical method.
(iii) the triangle method.
(i) The Parallelogram method In this method you will determine the resultant of two vectors inclined to each other at an angle from the diagonal of a parallelogram drawn with the two vectors as adjacent sides.
These two vectors must be drawn from a common origin.
The parallelogram law of vectors states that if two vectors are represented in magnitude and direction by the adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of the parallelogram drawn from the point of intersection of the vectors represents the resultant vector in magnitude and direction.
Worked example Find the resultant of two vectors 2N and 5N acting at a point 0 at an angle of 60° to each other.
Solution • By Scale drawing - using a scale (1 cm = l km or any other convenient scale) draw a horizontal line; - using your ruler, measure (mark) out 5 cm to represent the 5N; - using protractor, measure (mark) out angle 60° to the horizontal; - draw a line to correspond with the 60° mark; - use the ruler to measure (mark) out 2 cm on the line OP to represent the vector 2N; - complete the parallelogram by drawing PC parallel and equal to OQ; QC parallel and equal to AC; - join OC ; - use the ruler to measure the magnitude OC and the protractor to measure the direction (angle (cid:181) ).
11PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • The length of OC gives the magnitude while angle (cid:181) gives the direction of the resultant vector.
• Your diagram should look like this.
P C 2N (2cm) R R = 600  =  0 5N (5cm) Q Fig.
1.7: Parallelogram method of determining R • The Analytical method You can also obtain the resultant vector by Cosine rule.
In this case, you only have to draw a sketch of the parallelogram and use the Cosine rule and Sine rule to find the direction.
• Cosine Rule: R2 = OP2+ 0Q2 + 2 OP.
OQ Cos 60 • Sine Rule: Sin (cid:181) = Sin B QC OC • To obtain the magnitude using Cosine Rule P C 2N R 600 β1200 0  5N Q Fig.
1.8: The Cosine rule of obtaining the resultant OC 2 = OP 2 +OQ 2 + 2 OP x OQ x Cos60° OC = OP 2 + OQ 2 + 20P x OQ Cos60° = 22 + 52 + 2 x 2 x 5Cos60o 12PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS = 4 + 25 + 20 x 0.0.5 = 29 + 10 R = OC = 39 = 6.25N • To obtain the direction using Sine rule Sin  = Sin120° = 0.8660 QC OC OC Sin 120° = Sin (180 - 120°) = Sin 60° Sin  = QC x 0.8660 OC = 2 x 0.8660 = 1.732 = 0.2656 6.25 6.25  = Sin-1 0.2656 = 15.4° (ii) The Triangle method You can find the resultant of two vectors A and B inclined at an angle θ to each other by using the triangle method.
To do this, you have to follow these steps: • Starting from a point 0, draw OP (to scale) to represent the vector A • Next, draw the second vector B i.e.
PQ (to scale) by placing its tail at the head of the first vector A, ensuring that it is inclined to A by the angle θ, and • Finally, the head of B is joined to the tail of A to make up the third side of the triangle OPQ.
OQ represents the resultant of the two vectors A and B.
• The arrows on OP, PQ and QO follow one another round the triangle.
The angle P0Q gives the direction of the resultant with respect to the vector A (the above is known as the triangle law of addition of vectors) Worked example 13PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Two forces 3N and 2N are inclined to each other at 30°.
Find the resultant force by the triangle method.
Solution Let us use a scale of l cm = 1N • first, we draw a horizontal line OA = 3 cm to represent the 3N force; • from the tip (head) of A, we measure out angle 30°; • next, we draw a line 2 cm to represent the 2N along the 30° mark (line of inclination to OA extended at 30° mark); and • finally, we join point 0 to point B.
The expected result is as shown Scale: 2 cm = 1N Fig.
1.9: The triangle rule Measure R and  to obtain the magnitude and direction of the resultant respectively.

Find the resultant of two vectors A and B of 3N and 4N acting at a point 0 at an angle of 450 to each other.
Use: (i) Parallelogram method (ii) Triangle method.
3.5 Resolution of Vectors Here we consider more than two non-collinear vectors acting at a point.
You may obtain the resultant by first reducing the system to two perpendicular vectors with the aid of resolution of vectors and then compounding the two vectors.
• This is a reverse process of finding two vectors which have the same effect as a resultant vector.
The resolution of a vector F means that we can express this vector F as the sum of two other vectors called the components of the original vector F. • Component of a vector in a given direction is its effective value in that direction.
Usually, a vector is resolved into components along mutually perpendicular directions.
That is, the horizontal or x -direction and vertical or y - direction.
• Suppose a vector F is inclined at an angle 0 to a horizontal component of the vector F as F = F Cos θ; and the vertical component of the vector F as x F = F Sin θ y Y Fy F θ Fy =Fsin θ X F = FCos θ x Fig.1.11: Resolution of a vector F 15PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Worked example A plane flies with a velocity of 500 km /h in a direction N30°E.
Find its effective velocity in the easterly and northerly directions.
• You will realise that the question, simply put means to find the two perpendicular components of the velocity.
N N V 30o V y 60o E Fig.
1.12: Components of V • To obtain the velocity in the easterly direction, you will find the horizontal component of the force using the formula V = V Cos X θ i.e.
V = 500 Cos 600 X = 500 x 0.5 = 250 kmh-1 • Likewise, to obtain the velocity in the northerly direction, you will find the vertical component of the force using the formula Vy = V Sin θ i.e.
Vy = 500 Sin 60° = 500 x 0.8660 = 433km h-1 3.6 The Resultant of more than two Vectors Whenever you are required to find the resultant of more than two vectors, you have to resolve each of the vectors in two perpendicular directions as illustrated in 3.5.
• The right hand or easterly direction is taken as positive while the left hand or westerly direction is taken as negative.
Also the southerly or downward direction is taken as negative while the northerly or upward direction is taken as positive.
16PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • After resolving all the forces you then add all the horizontal components x and the vertical components y.
You then obtain the resultant of x and y by the use of the Pythagoras rule.
Worked example Determine the resultant of three concurrent forces one of 100N acting horizontally to the right, another of 140N acting upward at an angle of 60° to the horizontal force and the third of 240N acting vertically upward.
Solution The following diagram shows the direction of the three forces T 240N Y 240N 140N 600 X 100N Fig.
1.13: Resolution of three concurrent vectors Using the resolution of vector method, we shall now resolve the forces into the horizontal and the vertical components as shown in the Table 1.4.

The theory suggests that matter is made up of small particles called molecules which are in constant motion.
You will also learn about the particle nature of matter, molecular and atomic structure and the nature and size of a molecule.
The three states of matter, assumptions of the Kinetic molecular theory and use of the Kinetic theory to explain the three states of matter and some common physical phenomena are also considered.
The unit ends with a brief discussion of the structure of simple crystals.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of the unit, you should be able to: • state the molecular theory and explain its justification • explain how molecules of a substance move relative to other molecules of the same substance • decide the atomic and molecular structures of matter.
• state the constituents of the atom • estimate the size of a molecule • use the molecular theory to explain the three states of matter and some physical phenomena such as change of state, pressure exerted by a gas, osmosis diffusion and surface tension • state the fundamental assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of matter • distinguish between crystalline and non-crystalline or amorphous substances • give at least two examples of a crystal and describe the structure of simple crystals.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept of Matter Matter is anything that has weight and occupies space.
Every object or substance is made up of matter.
Many of the properties and behaviour of substances can best be explained by assuming that all substances are composed of small particles called molecules.
The assumption that matter is made up of tiny particles (molecules) which are in constant motion is known as the "molecular theory of matter."
22PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.2 Structure of Matter 3.2.1 Evidence of the Particle Nature of Matter (i) Many substances in solid form can easily be crushed to powder form e.g.
piece of chalk, lump of clay, charcoal and piece of stone.
(ii) A dry stick or dry wood is easily broken into smaller bits (iii) Solubility - if you drop a cube of sugar into a cup of water and turn the water, the sugar "disappears".
That is, it dissolves in water.
(iv) If you scrape the surface of a piece of chalk, you will see thousands of very tiny particles flake off and float through the air (Note that what you see are not the smallest particles possible i.e.
molecules.
There is a limit to the size of particles the eyes can see) (v) If a beam of light (e.g.
sunlight) is entering a dusty room through a window, you will observe a chaotic motion of the dust particles in the air.
3.2.2 Experimental Evidence of the Particle Nature of Matter Experimental evidence of the atomic or molecular nature of matter is the Brownian motion named after the botanist, Robert Brown, who discovered the phenomenon in 1827.
While he was observing tiny pollen grains suspended in water under a microscope, Brown noticed that the tiny pollen grains moved about in zigzag paths even though the water appeared to be perfectly still.
The here and there by the molecules of water pollen grains were being knocked about which were vigorously moving about.
Brownian motion can be demonstrated by the smoke-cell experiment.
The apparatus is shown in Fig.
2.1.
23PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (b ) Fig.
2.1: Molecular motion in gas: Brownian (random) motion Collect some smoke from a smouldering piece of cloth or wood by means of a syringe and introduce it into the cell.
Replace the cover quickly and adjust the focus of the microscope until the fine particles come into view clearly.
You will observe the smoke particles as black dots which move about irregularly like a (drunkard) drunken man staggering about.
The particles dart from one place to another very suddenly, some going out of focus, others coming into focus, but always in motion.
Explanation of Brownian motion The irregular movement of the smoke particles is due to the motion of the invisible air molecules which bombard each particle from all sides.
The particle is very small and the number of molecules of air hitting one side is not balanced by the number of molecules hitting the opposite side at the same instant.
Therefore, the particle moves in the direction of the resultant force and when it moves to another place, the same thing happens.
Why can't the motion of the particles be due to convection?
In that case the particles would move upwards continually and not zigzag from side to side.
Brownian motion in liquids can be demonstrated similarly as follows: 24PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Place on a clean microscope slide a few drops of diluted aquadag (fine graphite particles suspended in water) or photopake (a similar suspension used for blacking negatives) and cover the liquid with a cover-slip.
Project an image of the slide on a screen using a micro projector so that the particles can be seen.
The graphite particles are then seen to be moving about in an irregular manner, thus showing Brownian motion in a liquid.
In this case, the irregular motion of the graphite particles is due to their bombardment by the surrounding water molecules which are constantly moving about in different directions.
Brownian motion is important for two reasons.
(i) It provides evidence for the existence of the tiny particles of matter called molecules (ii) It gives evidence that molecules are in a constant state of random motion.
3.2.3 Simple Atomic Structure Definition An atom is the smallest indivisible particle of an element which can take part in a chemical change.
Fig.
2.2: Structure of an atom Fig.2.2 shows the simple structure of an atom.
It consists of two parts: the nucleus and the electrons.
The nucleus is the heavy portion of the atom and is made up of two types of particles called protons and neutrons.
The protons carry a positive charge while neutrons carry no charge.
The electrons carry a negative charge and circle in orbits around the heavy nucleus.
The numbers of orbits depend on the substance, for example hydrogen has only one orbit while oxygen has two.
An electron is very light (about 1 / of the mass of the proton).
The negative charge 1840 of an electron is equal to the positive charge of a proton and the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons.
The atom is therefore electrically neutral.

3.3 Molecules 3.3.1 Definition: A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance which can have a separate existence and still retain the properties of that substance.
3.3.2 Structure, Nature and Size of Molecules (i) Most substances cannot exist by themselves as individual atoms, rather they combine their atoms with themselves or with other atoms to form molecules.
Thus a molecule may be made up of similar atoms of the same element or different atoms of two or more elements.
For example a molecule of hydrogen is made up of two atoms of hydrogen but a molecule of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
(ii) The molecules of any pure substance are identical they have the same structure, the same mass and the same mechanical properties.
(iii) Molecules are formed by atoms combining in simple proportions (iv) The simplest model of a molecule is that of a rigid sphere (like a small billiard ball) which can move and collide with other molecules or with a wall and exert attractive or repulsive forces on neighbouring molecules.
The molecular forces decrease as the distance separating the molecules increase.
(v) Molecules are in constant motion.
The motion is random (haphazard or zigzag) in liquids and gases but oscillatory or vibrational in solids.
(vi) The size of a molecule is extremely small - of the order of 10-9 - 10-10 m. as a result of the small size, molecules cannot be seen 26PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS with the naked eyes or even with the aid of a microscope: Again because of the small size, one gramme of an element contains several millions of molecules.
For example one gramme of hydrogen contains about 1023 molecules.
3.3.3 Some Ideas about Molecular Size It is difficult to imagine how tiny the diameter of a molecule actually is.
Even the numerical value estimated to be of the order of 10-10 m (10-9 cm) is also not easily and accurately conjectured.
The following may enable you to have a better idea of the size of a molecule: (i) If a fine hair is magnified until its thickness is that of a wide street, a molecule in the hair would then look like a speck of dust in the street (ii) The tip of a pin contains millions of molecules.
(iii) Two grains of hydrogen contain 6 x 1023 molecules.
If the whole population of the world were to count such a huge number of molecules individually at the rate of five molecules per second, it would take 100 years to count all of them.
3.3.4 Estimating the Size of a Molecule You can estimate the size or diameter of a molecule by performing the oil film experiment.
The principle of the oil film experiment was discovered by Lord Raleigh in 1890.
It was known that certain oils when dropped on the surface of water, would spread to form a circular film with the molecules standing up - right.
Lord Raleigh argued that if a drop of oil is placed on top of a water surface, the oil will spread out on top of the water surface until the thickness of the oil film is one molecule thick.
He, therefore, used this reasoning to obtain the first estimate of the diameter of a molecule.
You can repeat Lord Raleigh's experiment as follows: Fig.
2.3: Oil film experiment 27PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (i) Fill a shallow tray with water and allow it to stand until the water is at rest.
(ii) Sprinkle some lycophodium powder lightly on the surface of the water (iii) Using a graduated pipette with a fine bore, take up a small volume of olive oil and note the reading on the pipette scale (iv) Drop a very small quantity of the oil on the water surface.
Note again the reading on the pipette and obtain the volume of the oil dropped by subtracting the second from the first pipette reading.
(v) Allow the oil to spread, pushing the lycopoduim powder outwards and forming a clear thin circular film of oil on the water surface.
(vi) Measure the diameter of the oil film to the nearest centimeter using a half millimetre scale.
Calculate the thickness of the oil film as follows: Let diameter of oil film = dcm Let volume of oil drop = Vcm3 Area of oil film = p d 2 2 cm2 .'.
Thickness of oil film Volume = Area V = p d 2 2 = 4V cm p d2 If you have performed the experiment accurately you should get a value of about 2 x 10-7 cm as the thickness of the oil film.
Hence the size of an oil molecule is taken as about 2 x 10-7 cm.

3.4 States of Matter Matter exists in three main states, namely solid, liquid and gas.
Solids have fixed shape and volume.
They cannot be poured.
Liquids have fixed or constant volumes but they assume the shape of the container.
They can be poured.
Gases have no fixed shape, but always occupy the shape of the container.
They can be poured.
3.5 The Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter The theory states that matter is made up of tiny particles called molecules which are in constant motion.
3.5.1 Fundamental Assumptions of the Kinetic Molecular Theory (i) Matter exists either in solid, liquid or gaseous state.
ii) All substances consist of molecules, the smallest particle which can exist independently.
(iii) In solids the molecules vibrate about a mean or fixed position.
The forces between the molecules are strong and may be attractive or repulsive.
All true solids have a crystalline structure in which the atoms are arranged in regular patterns called lattices.
(i v) In liquids the molecules move freely in all directions.
In addition to vibrational energy, they have translational energy.
The Kinetic energy of the liquid molecules is greater than in solids.
(v) In gases the molecules are in constant motion and are further apart than in solids and liquids.
They move at high speeds and have translational, vibrational and in addition rotational energy if 29PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the molecules are made of two or more atoms.
The attractive or cohesive force is negligible, so, gases are perfectly free to expend and completely fill the vessels containing them.
Gas molecules have the greatest Kinetic energy.
Because the intermolecular forces are small, the motion of molecules in the gaseous state is linear until collision takes place either with other molecules or with the walls of the container.
3.5.2 Basic Assumptions of the Kinetic Theory of Gases The Kinetic theory of matter has been more completely developed for gases than for solids and liquids.
This is because the problems involved are much simpler in the case of gases.
The simplest substance to which the theory has been applied is the ideal gas.
The fundamental assumptions of the theory are as follows: (i) Gases consist of many very small particles called molecules, which are like perfectly elastic spheres and are usually in constant random motion.
(ii) Molecules exert no forces on one another except when they collide.
Therefore, between collisions with other molecules or with the walls of the container, they move in straight lines.
(iii) Collisions of molecules with one another or with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic.
This means that the total Kinetic energy of two molecules before collision is the same as that after collision, and that when a molecule collides with the wall its Kinetic energy is unchanged.
(iv) The duration of a collision is negligible compared with the time between collisions (v) Molecules are separated by distances which are very large compared with the size of the molecules (or the volume of the molecules is negligible when compared with the volume of the container); they are, however, distributed uniformly throughout the container.
(vi) Any finite volume of the gas contains a very large number of molecules.
This assumption is supported by experimental evidence because under standard temperature and pressure (s.t.p), there are about 3 x 1019 molecules per cm3 of any real gas.
30PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
What do you understand by the Kinetic molecular theory of matter?
2.
State (i) The assumptions of the Kinetic theory of matter, (ii) The assumptions of the Kinetic theory of gases.
3.
Distinguish between the Kinetic theory of matter and the Kinetic theory of gases 3.6 Explanation of some Physical Properties and Processes Using the Kinetic Molecular Theory 3.6.1 The Three Basic States of Matter (a) In solids, molecules vibrate about a mean position.
The forces between the neighbouring molecules are strong and the attractive and repulsive forces between them balance.
Solids therefore have characteristic crystalline structures in which the atoms are arranged in regular patterns called lattices.
(b) In liquids, the forces between the molecules are less strongthan in solids, but they are both cohesive forces.
So, the molecules move freely through the liquid, exchanging partners or neighbours as they go.
The liquid can thus take the shape of the container and can be poured because the molecules are very free and are in continuous random motion.
(c) In gases, the molecules are much further apart than those of solids and liquids.
They move freely and at high speeds in the space in which they exist.
As in liquids they are in constant random motion.
The attractive or cohesive force is negligible, and hence a gas can be poured and is perfectly free to expand and completely fill the vessel containing it.
3.6.2 Pressure Exerted by a Gas A gas consists of molecules in random motion.
As the molecules collide with one another and with the walls of the container, they change direction of motion.
Therefore, there is always change in momentum, and rate of change of momentum exists at any given time.
According to Newton’s second law of motion, rate of change of momentum is force.
So, a force is exerted on the container as the molecules change momentum.
The force per unit area thus exerted is the pressure exerted by the gas.
31PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.6.3 Diffusion If hydrogen sulphide gas is released at one end of the room, the rotten- egg smell soon fills the whole room.
If a perfume bottle is opened at one corner of a room the perfume smell soon spreads to every corner of the room.
In both cases the molecules of the gas, because of their incessant random motion, have quickly travelled throughout the room and filled the whole space with their smell.
The process is known as diffusion.
Definition Diffusion is the tendency of molecules to migrate and fill an-empty space as a result of their random thermal motions.
Diffusion takes place in liquids and gases but more slowly in solids.
Its rate depends on the density and temperature of the gas.
Light gases at high temperatures diffuse faster than heavy gases at low temperatures.
3.6.4 Change of State (Melting, Vaporisation) Melting - Heat lessens the cohesion which holds molecules together in the crystal lattice of a solid.
At the melting point heat breaks the lattice completely and the molecules are free to move about randomly, though still held together by the force of cohesion.
During melting the temperature is constant while heat is absorbed to break the lattice.
3.6.5 Boiling At boiling point the temperature of the boiling liquid is again constant.
Heat absorbed is used to overcome the force of cohesion by breaking the attractive forces holding the liquid molecules together.
Thus the molecules break away and become molecules of gas.
The same amount of heat absorbed for melting is given out for fusion (just like in the case of vaporisation and condensation).
3.6.6 Evaporation In a liquid the molecules move randomly with different speeds and they have an average Kinetic energy (k.e).
Some of the molecules near the surface which are moving with speed greater than the average speed succeed in escaping from the attraction of their neighbours and jump out of the liquid.
This is evaporation.
The molecules would have left the liquid to form the vapour.
As they escape from the liquid with this extra 32PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS energy the temperature of the liquid reduces.
Thus we have the cooling effect of evaporation.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Use the Kinetic molecular theory to explain the following: a) The three states of matter b) Pressure exerted by a gas c) Diffusion d) Change of state (melting, solidification, vaporisation, condensation) e) Boiling f) Evaporation.
3.7 Properties of Fluids at Rest 3.7.1 Adhesion and Cohesion Adhesion is the force of attraction between molecules of different substances, e.g.
molecules of water and glass.
Cohesion is the force of attraction between molecules of the same substance, e.g.
water molecules.
The different behaviours of water and mercury when spilled on a clean glass surface is explained by adhesion and cohesion: The adhesion of water to glass is greater than the cohesion between water molecules, so water spreads out on clean glass and wets it.
In the case of mercury, the cohesion of mercury molecules is stronger than the adhesion of mercury to glass.
As a result mercury does not wet glass but rather forms into globlets or spherical beads on the glass surface.
3.7.2 Surface Tension The surface of a liquid behaves as if it were a stretched elastic skin with the result that it can hold an object denser than the liquid gently placed on it.
This phenomenon is known as surface tension.
Definition Surface tension is the force acting along the surface of a liquid, causing the liquid surface to behave like a stretched elastic scene.
33PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Examples of the effect of surface tension Fig.
2.4: Effects of surface tension (i) If water is allowed to drip very slowly from a water tap, the shape of each small drop is spherical (Fig.
2.4a) (ii) If a dry paint brush is dipped in water and withdrawn, the hairs of the brush cling to one another (Fig.
2.4b) (iii) Droplets of mercury on a clean hard surface such as glass are spherical in shape.
Larger drops, because of their weight, are flattened at the top with curved sides (Fig.
2.4c) (iv) Soap bubbles are spherical in shape (Fig.
2.4d).
(You should be able to give some other examples of the effect of surface tension) Molecular explanation of surface tension X Fig.
2.5: Molecular forces in a liquid Consider two molecules X and Y in a liquid as in Fig.
2.5.
X is on the surface while Y is well below the surface.
Y will be attracted uniformly in all directions and is not pulled in any one particular direction, i.e.
34PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS there is no resultant force on it as a result of the attraction of the molecules surrounding it.
On the other hand X is only attracted by the molecules within the body of the liquid.
It therefore experiences a resultant inward force (pull) at right angles to the liquid surface.
All molecules on or near the surface experience this resultant force downwards with the result that the liquid surface will always tend to shrink or contract and make the surface area as small as possible.
The surface is therefore in a state of strain or tension which is called surface tension.
3.7.3 Capillarity Definition Capillarity (or capillary action) is the tendency of a liquid to rise or fall in a narrow tube Illustration of capillarity Fig.
2.6: Demonstration of capillary action (i) Dip three capillary tubes with fine bores but with different diameters into clean water as in Fig.
2.6 (a) above.
You will observe that the water rises in the tubes but the narrower the bore the greater the height to which the water rises (Fig.
2.6 a).
35PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (ii) Repeat the experiment with soap solution.
You will observe a similar situation except that the heights of soap solution are lower than in the case of water (Fig.
2.6b) (iii) Repeat the experiment again with mercury.
You will observe that the level of mercury falls in the three tubes.
The mercury level is depressed below the level of mercury outside the tubes (i.e.
in the container).
Again the narrower the tube the lower the level of mercury (Fig 2.6c).
Explanation of Capillarity (i) The meniscus of water or soap solution is curved upwards (concave) because the adhesion of water and soap solution to glass is greater than the cohesion of water or soap.
Therefore water or soap solution wets the glass tube and so spreads a thin film of water/soap solution on the inner surface of the tube.
The adhesive forces thus force the water (soap solution) to creep up the inside of the tube.
The water/soap solution is held up as it creeps by surface tension forces acting around the circumference of the meniscus.
The water/soap solution thus keeps rising in the tube until the weight of the column of water/soap solution balances the surface tension acting at the top of the column.
(ii) In the case of mercury the cohesion of mercury molecules which is greater than the adhesion of mercury to glass causes the mercury level to be depressed in the tube.
The surface tension forces acting around the circumference of the tube holds down the mercury column as it is depressed by cohesive forces of the mercury molecules.
The depression continues until the weight of the mercury column in the tube is equal to the surface tension.
You should try and identify other examples of capillarity e.g.
absorption of liquid by blotting paper, the rise of oil in wicks of lamps, etc.
3.7.4 Osmosis Definition Osmosis is the tendency of a solvent to pass from a dilute solution, through a semi permeable membrane into a concentrated solution.
Semi-permeable membrane is a substance such as cellophane, parchment or vegetable material which would allow some molecules of liquid to diffuse through them but not others.
Such a membrane may 36PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS allow the molecules of a solvent to pass through it but not those of a solute.
Demonstration of osmosis Fig.
2.7: Demonstration of osmosis (i) Tie a semi-permeable membrane across the mouth of a thistle funnel and pour some concentrated sugar solution into the funnel.
(ii) Immerse the funnel in a beaker of water as shown in Fig.
2.7 and note the level of sugar solution in the funnel.
(iii) Allow the set up to stand for a day, and check the level of sugar solution in the funnel again.
Test the water in the beaker for sugar.
You will observe that the level of the sugar solution in the inverted thistle funnel has risen and that the water in the beaker is free from sugar.
Explanation The molecules of sugar (the solute) cannot pass through the semi- permeable membrane, but molecules of water (the solvent) can do so.
Sugar and water molecules are bombarding the membrane on one side and only water molecules on the other side.
Thus, more water molecules move up into the funnel than down out of it and so the level of liquid in the thistle funnel rises.
37PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.7.5 Viscosity Brief mention should be made here of the force of viscosity which occurs in fluids at rest or in motion.
Viscosity is "friction" in fluids (liquids and gases).
It may be defined as "the internal friction between the layers of a liquid or gas in motion".
Liquids that pour slowly are more viscous than those that power faster.
Thus very cold honey is more viscous than very cold water.
The movement of one layer of fluid over a neighbouring layer is opposed by forces of viscosity.
Again, when a stone or a ball-bearing falls through a viscous (think) liquid, the downward motion of the object is opposed by the viscosity of the liquid.The greater the viscosity of the liquid, the greater the opposition to the movement of the object and hence the slower its motion.
A more detailed discussion of viscosity is done in Module 2, Unit 2.

3.8 Crystalline and Amorphous Substances Solids are usually classified into two groups: (i) Crystals or crystalline solids; (ii) Noncrystal or non-crystalline solids; The difference between crystals and non-crystals is the arrangement of atoms or molecules in the solid.
38PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.8.1 Crystals Definition A crystal is a piece of solid matter in which the atoms, molecules or ions are arranged in a highly regular repeating pattern called lattice.
Crystal Lattice The particles in a crystal are arranged in regular 3-dimensional framework or pattern called crystal lattice which repeats over and over again in all directions.
The high degree of regularity and order in the arrangement of the molecules is the principal feature distinguishing solids from liquids.
Particles in a liquid are jumbled and highly disorganised as they move about.
They are even more disorganised in a gas.
Examples of common crystals are: sodium chloride, zinc sulphide, chromium, iron and platinum salts.
3.8.2 Structure of Simple Crystals A simple crystal is made up of a huge number of simple basic units or building blocks called unit cells (Fig.
2.8a).
If you stack these units up and, down, side by side and in all directions, you can build the whole lattice.
Unit cells are of three types, giving rise to 3 types of lattice and hence 3 types of crystals, simple cubic lattice, face- centred cubic lattice and body-centred cubic lattice.
b.
Sodium chloride, NaCl Fig.
2.8: Simple cubic crystal 39PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (a) Simple Cubic Crystal Here the atoms or molecules or ions are placed at the corners of imaginary cubes stacked side by side, up and down like building blocks (Fig.2.8b).
An example is the Sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal.
In the lattice, the atoms of Na and CI alternate positions in the cube in each of the 3 directions.
Each atom within solid, thus has six immediate neighbours.
Zinc sulphide, ZnS Fig.
2.9: Face-centred cubic crystal (b) Face-Centred Cubic Crystal The unit cell has identical particles at each of the corners plus another particle in the centre of each face as shown in Fig.
2.9.
A typical face- centred cubic.
Crystal is Zinc sulphide (ZnS).
Other crystals in this group include crystals of common metals like copper, silver, aluminium, lead, etc.
Fig.
2.10: Body-centred cubic crystal (c) Body-centred Cubic Crystal The unit cell has identical particles at each corner of the cube plus one in the centre of the cell as illustrated in Fig.
2.10.
Examples include; chromium, iron and platinum salts.
40PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.2.11: Chain-like molecules of amorphous substance 3.8.3 Non-Crystalline and Amorphous Solids The atoms of non-crystals are not regularly arranged as in the case of crystals.
They are said to be "amorphous” that is having no definite shape or form; not organised.
In a number of ways amorphous substances resemble liquids more than solids.
Examples of amorphous solids are glass and plastics.
Amorphous solids never form crystals.
They are usually made up of long, chain-like molecules that are intertwined in the liquid state just like strands of earthworms (Fig.
2.11) 3.8.4 Heating and Cooling of Crystals and Non-Crystals When heated, crystalline solids, with time, melt at constant temperature.
When the melting process is completed, temperature rises until at another constant temperature, the liquid begins to change to gas.
Fig.
2.12 shows the heating curve for a crystalline solid.
41PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Temperature Liquid changing to gas Boiling point Solid changing To liquid Melting point solid Time Fig.
2.12: Heating curve for crystalline substances When crystalline substances are cooled, they begin to solidify at some constant temperature, forming solid crystal.
Fig.2.13 shows a typical cooling curve for a crystal cooling from the liquid phase.
As soon as the last bit of liquid has solidified, the temperature of the substance drops sharply.
Temperature Solid crystal formed Time Melting point Fig.
2.13: Cooling curve for crystalline substance Amorphous substances soften gradually when heated, unlike crystalline substances which will melt suddenly.
For this reason, glass or plastic can be heated to soften it and then bend it.
When cooled, amorphous substances.
42PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Temperature After heat is removed Time Supercooling with no Fig.
2.14: Cooling curve for amorphous substance crystalline formation behave rather oddly.
They lose heat steadily and very fast and solidify without forming crystals.
The cooling of the "liquid" continues until the solid hardens.
Crystals are never formed (and cannot be formed) because the molecules of the amorphous substance cannot be tangled before they are frozen.
Fig.2.14 shows the cooling curve for a typical amorphous substance.
The process is called "supercooling".
The amorphous substance (glass, rubber or plastic) is "supercooled liquid” and not a "solid" in the true sense of the word.

You can use the term to describe any object that is not at rest such as an aeroplane in flight or a man walking along the road.
Motion can take place in one, two or three dimensions.
When a body moves along a straight line, we speak of one dimensional motion.
Two dimensional motion is motion in a plane.
For example, the motion of footballers on a field.
Three dimensional motions take place in space.
Example is the flight of mosquito in a room.
46PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • list the types of motion in a given environment • classify a list of familiar motion into random, rotational, oscillatory and translational motion; • identify for a given motion the two bodies between which there is a relative separation • distinguish between distance and displacement in a translational motion • distinguish between speed and velocity • plot a distance-time graph and deduce the speed of motion from the gradient or slope of the graph • determine speed and velocity when simple problems are set involving distance or displacement and time • explain the concept of uniform motion, instantaneous speed/velocity and uniform acceleration • determine acceleration from a velocity - time graph • deduce the three equations of motion from a (v - t) graph with initial velocity and constant acceleration • explain the terms used in the equations of motion.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Types of Motion There are four main types of motion: (i) random motion (ii) translational motion (iii) rotational motion and (iv) oscillatory motion.
3.1.1 Random motion An object is said to undergo random motion when it moves in an irregular manner with no preferred direction or orientation.
Examples 47PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Movement of players in a football field; • Brownian motion - an irregular motion of particles suspendedin water or of smoke particles suspended in air.
Fig.
3.1: Random motion of gas molecule 3.1.2 Linear/Translational Motion When rigid objects move away from one point in space to another without rotating, the motion is said to be translational.
In translational motion, you will observe that every point in the body remains relatively fixed to one another.
Each part of an object undergoing pure translational motion follows the same path.
Examples • When you move from your home to the study centre; • A car travelling from Enugu to Abuja, along the road; • An insect crawling from one point to another.
3.1.3 Rotational Motion An object undergoes rotational motion when its movement requires its complete turning.
We mean that all points in the body move inconcentric circles such as the point P in a rotating wheel.
The centre of these circles all lie on a line called the axis of rotation.
Fig.
3.2: Rotational motion of a wheel Axis of rotation passes into the page Examples 48PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Rotational motion of a record disc • The movement of the blades of an electric fan; • The earth spinning about its axis.
3.1.4 Oscillatory (or Vibrational ) Motion You describe an object as undergoing oscillatory motion when its movement is periodic.
That is, the object undergoes a `to and fro' movement about an axis, reversing the direction of its motion and returning regularly to its original position.
String (a) Simple pendulum (b) Vibrating mass on a spring Fig.
3.3: Oscillatory motion bob Example • The motion of a pendulum as it swings back and forth, Fig.
3.3.
(a) • The vertical motion of a disturbed mass hung from a spiral spring or an elastic band Fig .3.3.
(b) You are aware that the actual motion of most objects is quite complicated.
The motion of an object is usually a combination of these different types of motion.
You know that: 49PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • The wheel of a car in motion combines rotational motion and translational motion; • The earth moves round the sun (translational) as well as spins about its north south axis (rotational); • A complex gas molecule with many atoms may undergo random, translational, rotational and oscillatory motions.
3.2 Relative Motion If you are sitting in a train travelling pass a railway platform on which your friend is standing, there is said to be relative motion between you and your friend.
A person sitting still at the back seat of a moving bus has the same speed as that of the bus relative to the earth.
But if he now walks towards the driver of the bus, he has a speed relative to the earth which is more than that of the bus.
Now, imagine the bus is moving at 30m/s and the person walks at 2m/s towards the driver, his forward speed relative to the earth is 32m/s (30m/ s +2 m/s).
But when he walks back from the driver to his back seat with the speed of 2m/s, his speed relative to the earth is now 18m/s (30m/s - 2m/s).
Relative to the earth, the speeds of the person are different in the two occasions.
In this illustration, the points of reference are the earth and the bus.
When you travel in a bus look down on the floor of the bus.
The bus will appear to you to be stationary.
This is because you and the bus are moving with the same speed and hence there is zero or no relative motion between two of you.
But if you look out of the window the trees outside the bus will appear to be moving in opposite direction as the bus.
Trees do not move.
The illusion of moving trees is due to the relative motion between you in the moving bus and the stationary trees.
An object undergoes relative motion when there are two bodies between which there exists a relative separation.
Such a motion involves the change of position of one object relative to another which may or may not be fixed.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 50PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 1.
What is motion?
2.
List and discuss the four main types of motion.
3.
List five examples each of these main types of motion that you come across in your environment (do not use examples already given in the unit).
4.
Give five examples of motions which involve more than one type of motion 5.
What do you understand by relative motion?
3.3 Parameters Used in Describing Motion The parameters used in describing motion are time, displacement (distance in a specified direction), speed, velocity and acceleration.
Example: If a boy walks 30 m eastward and then 40 m northward the distance he has walked is 70 m (30 + 40m).
His displacement is 50 m N38°E.
((cid:214) [302 + 402]-àt an angle 38° East of North) N B The displacement is 50 m N380 E 50 m 40 m The displacement is 70 m (i.e.
40 + 30m).
520 0 A 30 m Fig.
3.4: Displacement and distance Think of and give other good examples to show distance and displacement.
3.3.1 Concept of Speed In describing the motion of a body, we note both the distance and time it takes to cover that distance.
The rate at which a body covers a distance is called the speed of the body.
Speed = distance time 51PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS i.e.
Speed = distance travelled time taken Symbolically, speed (v) = distance (s) time (t) i.e.
v = s - ( 3.1) t You should note that: • Speed is a scalar quantity; • We talk of average speed because speed may not be constant all the time.
For instance when a driver slows down at road bends, stops for school children to cross the road or may even increase his speed; • Speed at a particular instance (instantaneous speed) is obtained by timing a short section of the journey around that instance.
Speedometer is the instrument fixed in vehicle for this purpose.
Uniform Speed When a body covers equal distances in equal time intervals, no matter how small the time interval may be, the speed is said to be a uniform speed or constant speed.
3.3.2 Concept of Velocity You should, as a student of Physics, know that velocity and speed can not be used interchangeable as is used in everyday language.
In speed no direction is specified (scalar) while in velocity the direction is specified (vector).
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time or the rate of change of distance with time or the rate of change of distance with time in a given direction.
Velocity = displacement time i.e.
v = s ---(3.2) t Note that: 52PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • When a car moves at constant speed in a straight line, its velocity is constant; • When a car moves round a circular path with constant speed, the velocity will be changing because of the change in direction at different points round the circle; • Velocity is a vector quantity and its unit is metre per second (ms-1).
Non- Uniform Velocity If a body moves round a circular path at constant speed, then it is said to move with non - uniform velocity because its direction of motion is constantly changing.
Uniform Velocity When a body moves with equal displacement in equal time intervals no matter how small the time intervals may be, the velocity is said to be uniform or constant.
3.3.3 Concept of Acceleration/Retardation An object may be moving with non-uniform velocity (changing velocity).
The change could be increase or decrease in velocity.
When the velocity of a moving object is increasing, the object is said to be accelerating.
When it is decreasing, the object is said to be retarding.
Acceleration (retardation) is defined as the rate of change of velocity with time.
Specifically, Acceleration (a) = increase in velocity (v) time taken (t) i.e.
Acceleration (a) = velocity change time taken to make the change => a = v (3.3a) t Retardation (- a) = velocity change time taken to make the change => -a = v (3.3b) t S. 1.
Unit = metre per second squared (ms-2) 53PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Uniform acceleration is defined as the motion of an object whose velocity increases by equal amount in equal time interval however small the time intervals may be.
• Worked examples l. A car has a velocity of 72 km/h.
How far does it travel in 1/2 min?
• Solution You must always use the same kind of units in calculations.
36 km/h = l0 m/s .'.
72 km/h = 20m/s 1/2 min = 30s velocity = displacement time => displacement = velocity x time = 20m/s x 30s = 600 m 2.
Suppose a train travels at 54 km/h and accelerates uniformly to 144 km/h in 10s.
Find the uniform acceleration.

What is its average velocity?
5.
In an attempt to over take a luxury bus, a car driver increased his velocity from 20 m/s to 60 m/s within a period of 15 seconds.
Determine the acceleration of the car.
3.4 Distance/Displacement - Time graph You are familiar with the motion along a straight line in which the actual distance covered is equal to the displacement and the speed is equal to the magnitude of the velocity.
Such motions can be represented on distance/displacement - time graph as shown in Fig.
3.5 below.

3.5(b) In Fig.
3.5 (a), distance s = 0 when t = 0.
55PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS That is, the timing is started when the body passes a reference point 0 on the path.
In Fig..3.5b, S = So at t = 0.
This means that timing was started when the body was at a distance So from the reference point on the path.
The straight line graph shows that the body covers equal distances in equal time (speed is uniform).
The slope of the graph AB s represents the speed (v) of the body.

The graph provides information about the moving object.
You can deduce the following from the graph.
(i) the slope of the graph gives the acceleration of the moving object; (ii) the area under the graph is the distance covered; (iii) a straight line graph parallel to X - axis shows that the object is travelling with uniform velocity.
That is, the object has zero acceleration or retardation, (iv) a straight line graph inclined to the X - axis shows that the object is undergoing uniform acceleration or retardation; (v) a non-linear graph shows that the object is undergoing non uniform acceleration or retardation.
The acceleration or retardation at any point is the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.

3.6 Derivation of the Equations of Uniformly Accelerated Linear Motion You can apply equations of uniformly accelerated motion when a body moves under constant (uniform) acceleration along a straight line.
Here both the velocity and the acceleration are in the same direction which is along the line of motion.
The speed - time graph of such a motion is shown in Fig.
3.9.

3.9:U Illustrating unifoDrmly accelerated motion with the A corresponding distance - time graph If u = initial velocity of the body 0 Time t(s) C Time t(s) v = velocity at time t a = the uniform acceleration 60PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS You recall then that by definition, a change in velocity v - u = = time interval for the change t  at = v-u or v = u + at --- (3.4) You already know that the distance S, travelled by the body during the time interval is represented by the area of the trapezium OABC That is, S = u + v x t 2 = average velocity x time interval From equation 3.4; v = u + at Therefore, substituting for v in the equation above we obtain S = u + u + at x t 2 i.e S = 2u + at x t = 2u + at x t 2 2 2 => S = u + ½ at + t S = u + ½ at2 …….
(3.5) You can still make t the subject of the first equation v = u + at i.e.
t = v – u a To obtain the third equation of motion, you will substitute for t in equation 3.4 using the relation for t above.
i.e.
S = ut +½ at2 becomes S = u v - u + ½ a v – u 2 a a Multiplying through by `2' gives 2S = 2u v- u + a v – u 2 a a 2uv – 2u2 1 v2 – 2uv + u2 2S = + a a 61PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Multiplying through by `a' 2aS = 2UV - 2U2 + V2 - 2UV + U2 2aS = V2+U2 -2 U2 2aS = V2 - U2 If you make V2 the subject of the relation you obtain V2 = U2 + 2aS--- (3.6) The equations 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are generally referred to as the three equations of uniformly accelerated linear motion.
You should note that if the body starts from rest, the initial velocity U = 0 so that the 1st equation v = u + at becomes v = at 2nd equation S = ut +½at2 becomes S =½at2 3rd equation v2 = u2 + 2aS becomes V2 = 2aS Similarly, if a body starts with a velocity u from a distance S , its o distance S, at time t, is given by S = S + ut + ½ at2.
o 3.7 Applications of the Three Equations of Motion in Solving Numerical Problems • Worked example A train, starting from rest, accelerates uniformly so that it attains a speed of 108 kmh-1 in 2 minutes.

3.
Use calculation method to solve all the problems treated earlier in this unit.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you learned about the four types of motion namely random, translational, rotational and oscillatory motion.
The study highlighted the fact that motion of an object is usually a combination of these different types of motion.
Also discussed was the idea of relative motion 64PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS showing that motion involves the separation of an object relative to the observer or point of reference.
Furthermore, the parameters used in describing motion namely time, position, distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration were examined.
Finally, you studied distance/displacement - time graph as well as speed/velocity - time graph and how to solve problems relating to them.
5.0 SUMMARY • You can distinguish between four types of motion: - (i) random motion in which a body moves irregularly with no preferred direction.
(ii) translational motion in which every point in a moving body remains fixed in relation to other points, (iii) rotational motion where every point in a body moves in circles, and (iv) oscillatory or vibratory motion in which a body moves to and fro, reversing its direction, and returning regularly to its position.
• Relative motion of a body A with respect to another body B is the motion A as observed from B.
B is the frame of reference.
In general, all motion involves the separation of an object relative to an observer (or point of reference).
• Displacement is the distance travelled in a specified direction • Speed is the distance travelled in unit time.
• Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time • When a body moves with equal displacement in equal time interval no matter how small the time interval may be, the velocity is said to be a uniform or constant velocity.
• The slope of a displacement/distance - time graph is the velocity/ speed.
• Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at any instant in time • Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time.
• The area under a velocity- time graph gives the total displacement.

Here you will learn how fundamental laws of motion apply to motions along curved paths such as the motion of projectiles along parabolic curves.
A projectile motion is a special case of motion in a plane.
It has no motive power of its own and will travel freely under the action of gravity and air resistance only when it is launched into space.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: • identify a projectile motion • derive the time of flight, maximum height and range of a projectile • solve simple problems involving the range, height and time of flight of a projectile • note the applications of projectile motion in warfare and sport.
68PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept of Projectile When you release a piece of stone from your catapult against a bird perching on a tree branch, the stone travels in a parabolic path towards the bird.
Also, if you throw a tennis ball against a wall, the path of the ball towards the wall is a parabola.
You will notice the same type of curve when you project a ball horizontally from the top of a building.
The stone or ball you projected is known as projectile, while the motion of the stone or ball projected is known as projectile motion.
The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory.
Examples of projectile motion are the motions of • kicked or thrown balls; • jumping animals; • objects dropped from windows; • bombs released from aircraft; • bullets fired from a rifle or gun • a stone released from a catapult; • an athlete doing the high jump.
3.2 Motion of Projectile We will first consider the simple case of a stone thrown horizontally with an initial velocity u from the top of a high wall or a cliff of height h. The stone is subject to two independent motions - a horizontal and a vertical motion.
Once the stone is free and before it hits the ground, no horizontal force acts upon it.
Its horizontal velocity will remain unchanged until it hits the ground as shown in Fig.
4.1.
69PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS U U V U 1 V U 2 V 3 U Fig.
4.1: Motion of a projectile When you throw the stone forward initially, it has no vertical velocity.
The vertical pull of gravity accelerates it downwards at a rate of about 9.8 ms-2.
The vertical or y - component of the velocity increases by 9.8ms-1 every second.
Hence, you will observe that any projectile in flight is doing two things at once: i. it is flying horizontally with a constant speed.
ii.
It is moving up or down with an acceleration g. Once you are able to recognise the above, solutions of projectile problems become easy for you.
You simply split each problem into two parts.
One involving horizontal motion at constant velocity the other is exactly the same as the free fall due to gravity.
3.3 Vertical and Horizontal Projections 3.3.1 Vertical Projection If you thrown a body such as a piece of stone vertically upwards, the maximum height it will attain depends on the initial vertical velocity.
If H = maximum height reached by the object; U = upward velocity of projection, i.e., initial velocity; and g = acceleration due to gravity.
At the time t after projection, the upward velocity v = u - gt; and the height reached h = ut -½ gt2.
At the maximum height reached, 70PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS V=0 and h=H \ 0= u-gt, i.e.
t u 1 = g Thus H = ut - ½ gt2 l 1 = u 2 – 1 u 2 (substituting for t i.e.
t = u/ ) l l g g 2 g Leading to H = u 2 or 1 gt 2 (4.1) 1 2g 2 Now, the body, starts from rest from the highest point (P) reached and falls to earth under constant acceleration g (Fig.
4.2) Speed P u C A Scope of AB = -g V Slope of H BC = +g (a) B 0 Time Fig.
4.2: Free fall: h vertical projection H height reached (b) Time Fig.
4.3: Graphs of vertical projection • You should be able to show easily that the body strikes the ground with a velocity which is equal in magnitude to the initial 71PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS velocity of projection but opposite in direction.
The time the body takes to return to earth from the point P is also equal tot.
I Therefore, total time of flight, T. of the body is 2t 1 = 2u ; g (cid:222) T = 2u (4.2) g Fig.
4.3: Illustrates the graphs of vertical projection 3.3.2 Horizontal Projection When you roll a ball at fast speed along a horizontal table, after reaching the edge of the table it continues with its horizontal motion.
Now it also experiences the pull of gravity.
This downward pull deflects the ball.
From its original direction and it finally strikes the floor at a distance which depends on the original horizontal speed and the height of the table.
This is illustrated in Fig.
4.4.
• • • • • • • • • • • Fig.
4.4: Flight of a ball with initial velocity horizontal You can regard the motion of the ball as the combination of two components: i. a horizontal motion at constant velocity, and ii.
a vertical motion under constant acceleration.
Suppose the total time of flight of the body from the instant it was projected horizontally at A until it strikes the ground at B is T. Because the horizontal velocity, u is constant, the horizontal range Ris given by R = uT as illustrated in Fig.
4.5 72PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS u Direction of projection A V =U x Height of V = w v cliff =H y V =U x Ground level Horizontal range R UNIT 5 B Fig.
4.5: Horizontal projection from the top of a cliff You know that the vertical component of the motion has zero initial velocity, and acceleration g. This means that in time T, the vertical distance travelled, which is the same as the height of the cliff H is given by: H = ½ gT2 Therefore, the time of flight is T == 2H and R = u 2H (4.3) g g You should note that the last equation relates the horizontal range to the height of the cliff and the initial horizontal velocity u.
3.4 Resultant Velocity of a Projectile You know that the velocity of the projectile during flight is made up of a horizontal component, u, and a vertical component w .
This is shown in Fig.
4.5.
The vertical component w at a time t after the start of the motion is given by w = gt The resultant velocity v = (u2 +w 2 ) (cid:214) (u2 + g 2t2 ) (4.4) 73PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The angle f , between the direction of motion of the body and the horizontal is given by Tan f = w = gt u u i.e.
f = tan-1 gt (4.5) u 3.5 Projection at an angle to the Horizontal Here we consider the more general case of a body projected at an angle to the horizontal from the ground.
The body moves along a parabolic path, reaches a maximum height and returns to the ground as shown in Fig.
4.6 U Sin q U H q O Horizontal range U Cos q Fig.
4.6: Projecting at an angle to the horizontal If you project the projectile with an initial velocity u at an angle θ to the horizontal, then the initial horizontal component of the velocity, V = U Cos θ x Initial vertical component of the velocity V = U Sin θ y You will recall that the horizontal component of the velocity remains constant because no force acts in the x - direction.
The vertical component of velocity changes with time because it is subject to gravity.
At any instance, t, the vertical component Vy is given by Vy = U Sin θ - gt 74PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS when the ball is moving upwards, but, Vy =U Sinθ + gt When the ball is moving downwards.
The height attained by the projectile at time t is given by y = U Sin θ. t -½ gt2 (from s = ut -½ gt2) =Ut Sinq - ½ gt2.
(4.6) Worked examples • A body projected vertically upwards with a velocity of 30ms-1.
How high does it travel before it comes to rest momentarily at the highest point of its motion?
What is the duration of the entire flight?
(Take g = 9.8 ms-2).
Solution Initial velocity of projection, u = 30 ms-1 Acceleration of free fall due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms -2 At time t after projection upwards, height reached is given by V2 = u2 - 2gh Where v = velocity at that instant, and v = 0 at the maximum height (cid:222) h =H = u 2 = 302m2s-2 = 45.92 m 2g 2 x 9.8 Also, v = u-gt = 0 at the maximum height \ t =t = u 2 = 30mls = 3.1s 1 g 9.8 ms-2 • Duration of the entire flight T = 2t 1 = 3.1s x 2 6.2s • A boy throws a stone horizontally with a velocity of 40ms ' from the top of a building 70 m high.

What is a projectile motion?
2.
A body is projected from the ground with a velocity of 35 ms- 1 at an angle of 60° to the horizontal.
Taking the acceleration of free fall due to gravity as 9.8ms2, calculate: (i) the time of flight (ii) the horizontal range (iii) the velocity with which the body strikes the ground 76PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.
A young girl fired a stone from a catapult at an angle of 45° to the horizontal with a velocity of 90 ms-1.
Calculate: (i) the time it will take to reach the highest point; (ii) the maximum height reached; and (iii) its horizontal distance from the point of projection at this instant.
3.6 Derivations of the Equations of Projectile Motion under Gravity 3.6.1 Time of Flight (T) You will recall from our earlier work that the height attained by the projectile at time t is given by y = ut Sin θ-½ gt 2 If time of flight is T, then, y = Ut Sin θ-½ gT2 (4.7) • Time of flight (T) is the time required for a projectile to return to the same level from which it was projected.
This implies as you know that after time T, y = 0.
Hence, from equation (4.7), you obtain 0 = UT Sinθ-½ gT2 T = 0 or T = 2u Sin θ g 2u Sin θ T = (4.8) g You may use an alternative method of obtaining the formula for time of flight by considering the vertical velocity at the maximum height.
Using V = U Sin θ- gt gives you 0 = U Sin θ-gt , 1 Because at maximum height v = 0, t is the time to reach the maximum l height.
77PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Hence, t 1 = u S i n q g (4.9) You know that the time taken to rise from level of projection to maximum height is equal to the time taken to return from the height to the level of projection.
Therefore, the total time of flight T is equal to 2t 1 or T = 2u Sin θ g 3.6.2 The Maximum Height (H) • The maximum height (H) is the highest vertical distance attained as measured from the horizontal projection plane.
For you to find H, you will use the equation of motion under gravity V2 = u2 -2gh recalling that the vertical component of velocity of projectile is V = U y Sin θ Hence, V2 = (U Sin θ)2 - 2 gh At maximum height, h = H, v = 0 Hence 0 = u2 Sin2 θ - 2 gH H = u 2 Sin 2 θ .....(4.10) 2g 3.6.3 The Range • Range is defined as the horizontal distance from the point of projection to the point where the projectile hits the projection plane again.
You will recall that the time taken to travel this horizontal distance is T, the time of flight.
Since the horizontal 78PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS component of the velocity of the projectile remains U Cos θ throughout the flight, we have that: R = U Cos θ x T = U Cos θ x 2u Sin θ g Hence; R = 2u2 Sin θ Cos θ from trigonometry, you know that Hence: 2 Sin θ Cos θ = Sin 2θ R = u 2 Sin 2 θ g (4.11) The range is maximum when Sin 2θ of the above equation is maximum.
The Sine of an angle is maximum when the angle is 90°.
Thus, the maximum value of Sin 2θ equals 1 when 2θ equals 90° or θ = 45°.
This means that R = Rmax at θ = 45° and R m a x = u 2 (4.12) g That is, the maximum horizontal range is attained when the projection angle is 45°.

4.7: Symmetrical motion of a projectile 3.8 Applications of Projectiles From your knowledge and study of projectiles you can now deduce that the principle of projectiles is used in warfare for aiming accurately at targets, obtaining maximum height and obtaining maximum ranges.
For instance, you know that for a bomber from an aeroplane to hit a target, 81PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the bomb must be released when the target appears at a certain angle of depression ~ given by: 1 gh tanf = u 2 You also know that at certain angle of projection (0 = 45°) a projectile would attain a maximum range.
In sports, the knowledge of projectile motions could be useful since maximum ranges can be obtained in sports in javelin, short put, football, golf, baseball etc.
Also, attaining maximum height, maximum time of flight are sometimes required.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1 Describe two situations where the knowledge of projectile motion is found useful.

3 A bullet leaves a gun with a velocity 450ms-1 at 38° to the horizontal.
Find the: (a) time taken by the bullet to its highest point; (b) the greatest vertical height reached by the bullet; (c) the horizontal range of the bullet (d) total time spend by the bullet in air (e) velocity of the bullet as it strikes the target.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you have learned how to identify a projectile motion as motion under gravity.
You have also learned how to derive the equations of projectile - range, maximum height and time of flight.
Further more, you have learned how to apply the equations of motion under gravity in solving numerical problems and the importance of the study of projectiles in our everyday life.
5.0 SUMMARY • A projectile is an object which given an initial velocity (usually obliquely or horizontally) is then allowed to move under the action of gravity and air resistance.
Usually, in order to simplify the analysis air resistance is neglected.
82PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • The flight of a projectile involves two motions - a constant horizontal motion and a vertical motion under gravity.
• The path or trajectory of a projectile is a parabola.
• Time of flight is the time required for a projectile to return to the same level from which it was projected.
T = 2USinθ g • The maximum height attained is the highest vertical distance attained by the projectile as measures from the horizontal projection plane.
U2Sin2θ H = 2g • The range is defined as the horizontal distance from the point of projection to the point where the projectile to return to the same level again.
U2Sin 2θ R = g • The range is maximum when θ equals 45°.

It was easy and useful to derive expressions for its velocity, acceleration or displacement from a given point at any given time.
In this unit, we will discuss the motion of a body under the action of a resultant force which is not constant but changes during the motion.
Like the force, the acceleration also changes at each instant.
We shall particularly consider the situation in which the body always returns to an equilibrium position when displaced because a "restoring force" acts on it.
The restoring 85PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS force causes the body to oscillate ‘to and fro’ past the equilibrium position.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain and define simple harmonic motion • show the relationship between: * linear and angular speed, * linear and angular acceleration.
• show the relation between period and frequency of the oscillating body • calculate the energy in the system • explain forced vibration and resonance.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Simple Harmonic Motion Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is the periodic motion of a body or particle along a straight line such that the acceleration of the body is directed towards a fixed point (or centre of motion) and is also proportional to its displacement from that point.
3.1.1 Examples of Simple Harmonic Motion Examples of Simple harmonic motion include the: (i) Motion of a simple pendulum (ii) Heart beat (iii) Motion of a loaded test tube in a liquid (iv) Motion of a mass suspended from a spiral spring (v) Motion of the balance wheel of a watch (vi) Motion of the strings in a musical instrument e.g.
guitar strings (vii) Motion of the pistons in a motor vehicle engine (viii) Motion of the prongs of a sounding tuning fork (ix) Motion of a child's swing (x) Motion of the diving board in a swimming pool.
86PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.2 Simple Harmonic Motion from Circular Motion rw q A D Fig.
5.1: SHM from circular motion Consider a particle, P moving round a reference circle with centre 0 and radius r with a uniform speed v. If the angular velocity of the radius vector OP is w , then a = rw .
Let us draw PQ perpendicular to the diameter AB at Q so that Q is the projection of P on AB.
As P moves round the circle, Q moves ‘to - and – fro’ along AB, being monetarily at rest at A and B and moving with maximum speed as it passes through 0, the centre of the path AB.
Thus the motion of Q along AB is simple harmonic while the particle P moves with a constant speed 6 round the circle ADBCA.
From Fig.
5.1, x = r Cos θ, where x is the horizontal distance of Q from the centre 0 at that point in time.
As the particle moves from B through C, A, D and back to B (i.e.round the circle), the angle 0 swept through by the radius vector from B to P varies from 0° at B to 90° at C, to 180° at A, to 270° at D and to 360° or 0° back to B.
Hence Cos q varies from 1 to 0 to -1 to 0 and back to 1 as x varies from r to 0 to -r and to r again.
Thus the value of x, the horizontal displacement from the central position 0, varies from the value r to -r and we can say that -r ≤ χ ≤ r. x A ٥ ٥ B 0 r r Fig.
5.2: Simple harmonic motion in a straight line 87PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS This is simple harmonic motion from the geometrical construction of the motion of a particle in simple circular motion.
The circular path of the particle is called "reference circle" and, as we have seen, is quite useful for studying simple harmonic motion.
3.3 Amplitude, Period and Frequency of SHM 3.3.1 Amplitude (A) The maximum value of x, the displacement from the equilibrium (central) position 0, is known as the amplitude (A) of the SHM.
In Fig.
5.2, A = r. Definition: The amplitude (A) of a simple harmonic motion is the maximum displacement of the body performing simple harmonic motion from its equilibrium or central position 0.
3.3.2 Period (T) The total time taken by the point Q to move from B to A and back to B is called the "period" of the SHM.
It is also the same time taken to move from 0 to B then to A and back to 0 (Fig.
5.1).
This is the time taken by the body in SHM to make one complete oscillation from one point back to that same point but in the same direction.
Definition: The period (T) of a simple harmonic motion is the total time taken by an oscillating body to make one complete oscillation or cycle or revolution about a central reference point.
3.3.
3 Frequency (F) If a body makes n oscillations in a given time t seconds then the number of oscillations per second is called the frequency of the SHM and is given by f = n t Definition: The frequency (f) of a simple harmonic motion is the number of complete oscillations per second made by the vibrating body.
88PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.3.4 Relationship between f and T n complete oscillations or cycles are made in t seconds \ Number of complete oscillation or cycle in 1 second, n f = t Time for complete oscillation or cycle, T = t n = 1 = 1 n f t \ T = 1 f 3.4 Speed and Acceleration of SHM 3.4.1 Speed of SHM From Fig.
5.1, we note that as P moves round the circle once, it sweeps through an angle of θ = 360° or 2π radians in the period T, the period of motion.
The rate of change of the angle θ with time t is called the angular velocity w .
That is, angular velocity (w ) is defined as follows: w = angle turned through by the body time taken w\ = θ t \ θ = w t θ is measured in radians (rad), where 2π rad = 360°.
θ w is measured in radians per second (rad/s), since w = t As the angle θ is changing (Fig.
5.1) with time, the arc length S = BP is also changing with time.
S = θ \ S = rθ 2πr 2π By definition θ (in radians) = s and hence S = rθ 89PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS where r = amplitude (A) = radius of the circle.
The angular velocity (w ) is given by w = θ = S/r t t = s .
1 t r But s/t = v, the linear velocity of the particle Hence, w = v. 1/r \ v = rw = Aw Thus the linear speed is equal to the product of the angular speed and the radius or amplitude of motion.
Examples: 1.
A small metal object is tied to the end of a string and whirled round a circular path of radius 30 cm.
The object makes 20 oscillations in 5 seconds.
Calculate the angular and linear speeds of the object.
Solution 20 complete oscillations = 360° x 20 = 2π x 20 rad.
= 40π rad Angular speed, w = θ = 40π rad = 8π rad/sec t 5s Linear speed, v = r w = 30 x 8π cm s 2.
A loaded test tube floating upright in water oscillates vertically.
If it makes 25 complete oscillations in 5 seconds, calculate the period and frequency of the motion.
90PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution time taken Period, T = number of vibrations 5s = = 0.2s 25 1 = 1 frequency f = s-1 or Hz T 0.2 = 5 HZ 3.4.2 Acceleration of SHM (Using Motion of Q) From Fig.
5.1, the linear velocity v at the point Q whose distance from the central point 0 is x, is given by v = w PQ (cid:214)w r2 – x2 The maximum velocity Vm corresponds to the velocity at 0 where x = 0.
Hence Vm=rw Thus the maximum velocity of SHM, occurs at the equilibrium or central position (x = 0) while the minimum velocity of SHM occurs at the extreme position of motion (x = r) and is numerically equal to zero.
An expression relating linear acceleration with the angular velocity can be obtained using differential calculus as follows: From F ig.
5.1, x = r Cos θ Where x is the displacement of the particle from the centre of motion (same as the distance of Q from 0).
But θ = w t, hence X = rCos w t Where w is the angular speed and r is the amplitude of vibration.
Differentiating, we have dx = rw Sin w t dt 91PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS But dx = rate of change of displacement with time dt = linear velocity v \ dx = v = - rw Sin w t dt We differential v in order to get the acceleration, as follows: a = dv= - rw 2 Cos wt since x = r Cosw t. dt = - w 2 x Hence, acceleration, a = - w 2 x Thus the linear acceleration of simple harmonic motion is the product of the square of the angular speed and the displacement, x of the particle from the centre of motion.
The negative sign in the acceleration equation indicates that the acceleration ‘a’ is always directed towards the centre of motion while the displacement is measured from the centre outwards, i.e.
the two vectors always act in opposite directions at any point in time.
This is an essential feature of SHM, namely that (i) the (linear) acceleration of the vibrating object and hence the force tending to restore the object to its equilibrium position are always in a direction opposite to the displacement of the body, and (ii) the acceleration and force are always proportional to the displacement of the body from the equilibrium position.
3.4.3 Acceleration of SHM (Using Motion of P) The equation (a = - rw 2 x) for the linear acceleration of SHM can also be obtained by considering the circular motion of (the particle) P around the reference circle (Fig..5. l ) as follows: The centripetal acceleration `a' of the particle is along PO (the radius of the circle) and its value is given by: Centripetal acceleration, a = -v 2 r Where r = radius of circle = amplitude of SHM But v = rw , hence 92PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Acceleration, a = - v2 = - r2w 2 r r = rw 2 \ a = - rw 2 Note that the component of this centripetal acceleration along OB (a ) is x given by a , = aCosθ = -w 2rCosθ x \ a = -w 2x, since x = r Cos θ x Thus: (i) centripetal acceleration = v2 = - w2r, and r (ii) Linear acceleration = - w2 x.
3.4.4 Relation between T, w and f It has been shown (section 3.4.1) that by definition, w = θ/t When t = T, then θ = 360° or 2p radians.
Hence w = 2p T Or T = 2p w Similarly, the frequency f is given by f = 1 = 1 .
T 2p /w T 2⁄p w Hen c e f = w 2p Or w = 2p f Example: A body in simple harmonic motion oscillates with a frequency of 40Hz and amplitude of 2 cm.

Unit of aθ: Angular acceleration (aθ) is expressed in radians per second (rad s-2) Suppose the angular velocity of a body in SHM changes uniformly from w to w in t seconds, then angular acceleration (aθ) is given by 1 2 a = change in angular velocity θ Time taken for the change = w - w 2 1 t But w = v or v = rw, hence r V – V 2 1 a = r r θ t = 1 (v – v ) 2 1 r t = a r where a is the linear acceleration of the body \ a = ra θ 95PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Thus linear acceleration (a) is equal to the product of angular acceleration (a ) and the radius (r) (or the displacement of the particle q from its equilibrium or central position, x).
3.5 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion When a body is in SHM, there is always a restoring force which tends to return the body to its central or equilibrium position.
Since "force" and "displacement" are involved, it follows that "work" and "energy" are also involved in SHM.
In simple harmonic motion, the total energy of the system is made up of only two types of energy, namely Potential and Kinetic energies.
At any instant of the motion, the energy of the system may be only Potential energy (PE) or only Kinetic energy (KE) or a combination of both PE and KE.
Thus in SHM, there is a constant transformation of energy from Potential energy to kinetic energy and from Kinetic energy to potential energy as the body oscillates about its equilibrium position.
The total energy of a body in SHM is always constant and at any point in time is given by Total energy of SHM = Potential energy (PE) + Kinetic energy (KE) (a) (b) Fig.
5.3: Kinetic and potential energy variation Fig.
5.3 (a) shows how the PE and KE vary with the displacement x from the centre of motion r is the maximum displacement or amplitude.
Fig.1.5.3.
(b) shows how the P.E.
and KE vary with time t, when t is measured from the centre of motion 0.
If T is the period, then T/4 is the time when the object is at the end of its oscillation, T⁄2 is the time when it returns to the centre, and so on.
The graphs have the shape of sine curve.
96PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS We shall illustrate energy in SHM using two SHM system as examples: (i) motion of a simple pendulum, and (i i) motion of a loaded spiral spring.

5.4: Energy transformations of a simple pendulum Fig.5.4 shows the energy transformations in a system comprised of an oscillating simple pendulum.
The energy at the extreme positions R and Q is all PE and is equal to mgh where m is the mass of the bob, h its height above the lowest level and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
At 0, h = 0 and PE = 0, but velocity of the moving bob is maximum (Vm).
Hence the KE is 2 maximum and is equal to ½m √m Thus, mgh =½mVm2 or am = √2gh At any instant of the oscillation of the simple pendulum, Total energy = Potential energy + Kinetic energy 97PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS i.e.
Total energy = mgh + ½ Mv2 = mgh =½mVm2 where hm = maximum height reach of by the pendulum bob and Vm = maximum velocity attained by the bob.
3.5.2 Energy in an Oscillating Loaded Spiral Spring equilibrium position e y Fig.
5..5: Energy in a vibrating loaded spring If a mass suspended from the end of a spiral spring is stretched vertically downwards and released, it oscillates up and down in SHM.
The force that tends to restore the spring to its centre of motion as it oscillates is the elastic (restoring) force and is given by F = -ky where k is the force constant, y is the displacement of the spring from the equilibrium position or centre of motion.
The total work (W) done in stretching the spring through the distance y is given by W = average force x displacement = ½ ky x y = ½ ky2 Thus the maximum total energy stored in the spring is given by W = ½ kr2 where r is the amplitude of motion or maximum displacement from equilibrium position.
This maximum energy is conserved throughout the oscillation of the SHM system.
98PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS At any point in time during the oscillation, the total energy is W = ½ kr2 = ½ mv2 + ½ ky2 (KE) (PE) where v is the velocity of the suspended mass at a distance y from the equilibrium position.
3.5.3 Period of Oscillation of a Loaded Spring We have seen that the total energy (W) in a loaded spring in SHM is given by W = ½ kr2 = ½ mv2 + ½ ky2 \ v2 = k (r2 – y2) m Thus the linear velocity (v) of the suspended mass is given by V = k (r2 – y2) m Comparing the two equations above, we have that w = k m w2 = k m Hence the period T is given by T = 2p = 2p m w k \ T = 2p m k The period (T) therefore depends only on the mass (m) and the force or elastic constant (k) of the spring.
It does not depend on the amplitude of vibration or on the value of g at the place of vibration.
The value of k can be obtained from Hooke’s law using F = mg = ke where e is the extension produced in the spring by the mass m. Hence K = mg e 99PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS In obtaining the formula for the period T of the oscillating loaded spring, the mass (m ) of the spring has been assumed negligible.
If the s mass of the spring is taken into account, then the true value of the period T, is given by T = 2p m + m s k 3.5.4 Period of Oscillation of a Simple Pendulum P q T l L x 0 Q Mg sin q q Fig.
5.6: Theory of simple pendulum To derive the formula for the period (T)of an oscillating simple pendulum, all that is needed is to obtain the value of the angular velocity (w) of the system in terms of the parameters of the system, since T = 2 p w Consider a simple pendulum oscillating in such a way that at a time t, the bob is at Q where OQ = x and angle OPQ – ө ( Fig.5 .6) With the bob at Q the restoring force which pulls it towards O, the centre of motion is equal to mgsinq .
PQ is perpendicular to the tangent at Q, hence the tension in the spring has no component along QO.
Therefore.
Restoring force = ma = - mgsinq 100PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS where a is the acceleration along the arc OQ and the negative sign indicate that the force towards and the displacement x of the bob from O are in opposite directions.
If ө is very small, then sinq = q in radians.
Again from Fig.5.1; we have that Using the sector OPQ x = q ; = (cid:222) q = x 2p l 2p l Hence the above equation for the restoring force becomes: Restoring force = ma = -mgSinө = - mg x C \ a = - g x l = - w 2x \ w 2 = g l Or w = √ g l The period of oscillation (T) of the simple pendulum is given by T = 2p w Hence T = 2p = 2p √ L/g √g/l \ 2p √L/g \ Thus since g is constant at a particular place the period of a simple pendulum depends only on the length l of the pendulum.
Since g varies from place to place, the period (T) of a simple pendulum will also vary from place to place.
Example A mass of 25 g is suspended from the end of a spiral spring whose force constant is 0.5 Nm-1.
If the system is set into simple harmonic motion with amplitude 20cm, calculate the 101PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (i) Period of the motion, (ii) Frequency of the motion, (iii) Angular speed, (iv) Total energy of the system, (v) Maximum velocity of the motion, and (vi) Maximum acceleration of the system Solution (i) T = 2 p 2p √ m/k w = 2p √ 0.025 0.5 = 1.41 sec (ii) F = 1 = 1 .

The amplitude of such a motion reduces gradually but steadily until it eventually decreases to zero.
Such a motion is known as “damped” motion.
If there is no damping, the motion is said to be free and the amplitude remains constant with time.
If the free oscillation of a body in SHM is to be maintained for a long time, an “external period force” would be required to force the body to continue its oscillatory motion inspite of the damping.
The oscillation of such a body is then said to be a “force vibration”.
Time Free oscillation Time Damped oscillation Fig.5.7 above illustrates the sketch displacement – time graphs of a body performing (a) free simple harmonic oscillations, and (b) damped simple harmonic oscillation.
Definition Forced vibrations are oscillations resulting from the action of an external periodic force on an oscillating body.
3.6.2 Resonance in a Vibrating System Every vibrating object possesses a frequency (f) of vibration.
The frequency (f ) with which the object would oscillate if it is left o undisturbed after being set into vibration is called the “natural frequency” of vibration.
If the object is subjected to an external periodic 103PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS force, the frequency of such an external force is called the “forcing frequency (fe)”.
If the frequency of a vibrating system which acts on another system coincides with the natural frequency of the second system, then the second system is set into vibration with a relatively large amplitude.
This phenomenon is known as “resonance” Definition Resonance in a system performing SHM is said to occur when the forcing frequency (f) of an external periodic force coincides with the natural frequency (f ) of a body with which it is in contact, causing the o body to vibrate with a large amplitude.
At resonance, maximum energy is transferred from the periodic external force to the natural vibrations of a system.
Examples of Resonance in vibration systems (i) A vibrating tuning fork, pressed against a table top, is heard to give a louder sound.
(ii) Divers make use of resonance to obtain a maximum lift –off from diving boards.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Force 3.1.1 Concept of Force Force is the agent which causes objects to move.
It usually manifests in the from of a “push” or a “pull”.
An object, e.g a book which is placed on a table is (macroscopically) at rest unless it is caused to move visibly by i.
Pushing it ii.
Pulling it or iii.
Lifting it.
When a body is moving in a straight line with uniform velocity, it will continue in that manner unless a push or a pull is applied to it to change its speed or direction, or both speed and direction.
Force may also change (or tend to change) the shape of a body.
It is difficult to describe force because it is not a visible entity.
However, its effects can be seen and therefore be described.
3.1.2 Definition and Nature of Force Definition of Force Force may be defined as a push or a pull which changes or tends to change the shape or state of rest or uniform motion of a body in a straight line.
Nature of Force The nature of force may be summarized as follows: i.
Force is a push or a pull ii.
It is the thing or entity that causes objects to move.
iii.
It is a vector quantity:-it always has both magnitude and direction.
iv.
Force is not a visible entity and can be described through its effects which are easy to see.
109PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS v. When a body A exerts a force (action) on a body B, B also exerts an equal force (reaction) in the opposite direction.
3.2 Types of Force There are two main types of forces: i.
Contact forces ii.
Non-contact forces or force fields.
3.2.1 Contact Forces This is a force which is exerted when two bodies or surfaces are in contact with each other, directly or indirectly.
Examples include a push, a pull, reaction forces, friction, tension forces, thrust forces.
3.2.2 Non-contact Forces or Force Fields This is a force which is exerted between objects which are not in contact with each other.
A force field makes itself felt without the presence of any material connection between the bodies involved.
Force fields are of the action at a distance type.
Suppose an object X sets up force field, it is observed that within a fixed region or neighbourhood of X, the influence of X on Y can be felt or detected and we talk about Y being in the field of X.
In some cases, it can also be considered that Y sets up a force field and that a force is accordingly exerted on X in the field of Y.
Examples of force fields are gravitational, magnetic, electrostatic or electric force fields and nuclear force fields.
A brief description of each of these force fields is presented below.
a. Gravitational Force Field Every object in the universe attracts other objects with a gravitational force.
This gravitational force is responsible for the orbital motion of the moon round the earth or the planets round the sun.
it was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727).
b. Electrostatic or Electric Force Field Electrostatic force is the force between two electrical charges.
A force of attraction is experienced if the two charges are unlike (positive and negative) while a force of repulsion is experienced if the charges are alike (positive and negative or negative and negative).
The law governing the force between electrical charges was discovered by a French scientist, Charles Coulomb (1736-1806).
110PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS c. Magnetic Force Field A permanent magnet or an electromagnet (a wire or coil carrying current) sets up a force field in a region or neighbour hood surrounding it.
Another magnet or electromagnet at any point within this region or neighbourhood experiences a force of attraction or repulsion due to the magnet/electromagnet.
Such a force is called a magnetic force field.
A moving charge also sets up a magnetic force field in addition to the electric field which surrounds it.
A second charge in these two combined fields will experience a force due to the magnetic field only if it is in motion.
d. Nuclear Force Field There exists, in the nucleus of an atoms, the strongest force in nature which holds together the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus.
If this force were not there, then the electrostatic forces of repulsion between the protons which carry positive electrical charges would cause the nucleus to disintegrate.
A very important feature of nuclear forces is that they are short ranged- two nuclear force between two nucleons is negligible if the separation between the nucleons is greater that about 10-15m.
Another important feature or property of nuclear forces is that they are independent of charge, i.e the nuclear force between two protons is the same as that between two neutrons and the same as that between a proton and a neutron.
3.3 Concepts and Types of Equilibrium 3.3.1 Concepts of Equilibrium A body is said to be in equilibrium if its acceleration is zero, i.e there is no net force acting on it in any direction.
Therefore, the body may be at rest or moving with constant velocity.
Definition A body is said to be in equilibrium if: i.
The body as a whole remains at rest ii.
The body is moving in a straight line with constant velocity and iii.
The body is rotating at a constant angular velocity.
3.3.2 Types of Equilibrium 111PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS There are two types of equilibrium: static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium.
i. Static Equilibrium If a body has zero acceleration by virtue of being at rest, the body is said to be in static equilibrium.
An example is a book resting on a table.
ii.
Dynamic Equilibrium If a body is moving with a constant velocity in a straight line or is rotating with a constant angular velocity about a fixed point or axis through its centre of mass, the body is said to be in dynamic or kinetic equilibrium.
An example is a car whose engine is running at constant speed for a considerable length of time.
3.3.3 Resultant and Equilibrium Forces Resultant (R) R Q P O S Equilibriant Fig.1.1: Resultant and equilibrium forces Consider the force board arrangement shown in Fig 1.1 above.
Suppose the force P, Q and S are in an equilibrium state.
The resultant R of P and Q acting at O can be obtained by the principle of parallelogram of forces.
The resultant R would be found to be equal in magnitude but exactly opposite in direction to the third force S which keeps the point O in equilibrium.
This third force is known as the equilibrant force and 112PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS counterbalances the other two forces P and Q while R is called the resultant (force) of P and Q. Definitions i.
A resultant force is that single force which, acting alone, will have the same effects in magnitude and direction as two or more forces acting together.
ii.
The equilibrium of two or more forces is that single force which will balance all the other forces taken together.
It is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force.
Note: If three forces F , F , F acting at a point are in equilibrium (Fig.
1 2 3 1.2), the resultant of two of these forces is equal but opposite in direction to the third force.
F1 F2 F 3 Fig.
1.2: Three forces in equilibrium Any of these forces is said to be the equilibrant of the other two.
Again, the lines of action of F , F and F must all pass through common point 1 2 3 (O in this case).

R = 5N Using the Sin rule, we have 5 R 5 = = Sin α Sin60 Sin 60 :.
5 = 5 Sin α Sin 60 :.
Sin α = Sin 60 :.
α = 60o The resultant (R) is a 5N force at 60o with each of the given forces.
3.3.4 Equilibrium of Three Forces Acting at a Point (Parallelogram and Triangle of Forces) i. Parallelogram of Forces The principle of parallelogram of forces states that if two inclined forces are represented in magnitude and direction by the adjacent sides of a parallelogram, their resultant is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram passing through the point of intersection of the two sides.
ii.
Triangle of Forces 114PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The principle of triangle of forces states that if three forces are in equilibrium, they can be represented in magnitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.

OACB is the parallelogram of forces in which OA represents P in magnitude and direction and OB represents Q in magnitude and direction.
The diagonal of the parallelogram OC represents the resultant R of P and Q in magnitude and direction.
R is counterbalanced by the equilibrant force E. Triangle OAC in Fig 1.3 (b) is the triangle of forces for P, Q and E (Note that the arrows are taken in a cyclical order.
The resultant R of P and Q is given by R2 = P2 + Q2 + 2PQ Cos Q where Q is the angle at which P and Q are inclined.
Worked examples 1.

117PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4 Moment of a Force The turning g effect of a force is called its moment.
Examples of the turning effects of forces in everyday life include: i.
Opening a door about its hinges by exerting a force on the door handle or door edge ii.
Turning a tap on or off iii.
Force exerted on the pedals when riding (i.e pedaling) a bicycle iv.
Opening of the metal cap of a soft drink bottle v. Driving a screw in or out of wood with a screw driver vi.
Tightening or loosing a nut with a spanner etc.
Definition The moment of a force about a point or axis is the turning effect of the force about that point or axis.
It is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance of its line of action from the point or axis.
Mathematically, Moment = Force x perpendicular distance of pivot to the line of action of the force.
Unit of moment Since force is in newtons (N) and distance is in metres (M), the S1 unit of moment is Newton-metre (Nm).

1.6: Moment of a force In Fig.
1.6 above, the moment of the force P about the point C is given by Moment = P x d (Fig 1.3 (a) Moment = P x d sin Q (Fig.1.3 (b) 118PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Worked examples Weight of 20 N and 30 N are hung on a light beam as slow in Fig.1.7.

X y 0 20N 30N Fig.
1.7 Solution Moment of 20N force = 20 ×X = 20x Nm Moment of 30N force = 30× y = 30y Nm 3.4.1 Principles of Moments The principle of moments states that if a body is in equilibrium under the action of a number of coplanar forces, then the sun of the clockwise moment about any point on the body is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moment about same point.
3.4.2 Clockwise and Anticlockwise Moments • C P R In Fig 1.8: The forces PA do to turn the body in anticlockwise direction.
In Fig.
1.8 the force P tends to turn the body in anticlockwise direction.
Its moments are called anti clockwise moment.
On the other hand the forces (cid:181) and R tend to turn the body in clockwise direction.
Their moments about C are thus clockwise moments.
If clockwise moments are taken to be positive, and then anticlockwise moments must be taken as negative and vice versa.
Its moment is called anticlockwise moment.
On the other hand the force α and R tends to turn the body in a clockwise direction.
Their moments about C are thus clockwise moments.
119PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4.3 Couples Definition A couple is a pair of equal but oppositely directed and parallel forces which are not acting in a straight line.
Characteristics of a couple (i) The couple has a zero resultant force but has a turning effect on the body on which it acts.
(ii) A couple can only cause a body on which it acts to rotate but not to move linearly.
(iii) The moment of a couple is the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the two forces.
(iv) The moment of a couple is also called a “torque”.
(v) The distance between the two equal parallel forces of the couple is called the “arm of the couple”.
(vi) A couple can be councelled or neutralized by applying an equally similar couple of opposite moment to the body experiencing the couple.
Examples (Application) of couples Uses, application or examples of (the effect of) couples in everyday life include: (i) Turning a tap on or off.
It is easier to turn a tap on or off by applying two equal and opposite parallel forces (couple) rather than by applying a single force.
(ii) It is easier to turn a steering wheel of a vehicle by applying a couple with our two hands instead of applying a single force with one arms.
(iii) Loosing a bolt.
It is easier to loosen or tighten a bolt by applying a couple at both ends of the bolt using two spanners.

1.9 (b) moments = 20Nx 1.5m= 30Nm 3.5 Conditions of Equilibrium 3.5.1 Conditions of Equilibrium under the Action of Parallel Coplanar Forces Coplanar forces are forces that lie in the same plane.
Parallel forces are forces whose lines of a action are all parallel to each other.
Consider a body which is under the action of several forces which are coplanar and parallel.
For the body to be in equilibrium (i.e.
it does not move or rotate), then the following two conditions must be satisfied: (i) Forces: The algebraic sum of the forces in any given direction must be zero.
Thus means the sum of forces acting in one diction must be equal to the sum of forces working in the opposite direction.
(ii) Moments: the algebraic sum of the moments of all forces about any point on the body must be zero, or the total clockwise moments of the forces about any point on the body must be equal to the total anticlockwise moments of the forces about the same point.

Suspend the ruler at a whole number O(e.g.
70cm) near one end.
Hang a suitable weight P on the opposite side of O and adjust the position until the ruler balances horizontally.
By taking moments about O, we have that, W x Go = P x Bo \ W= P x Bo Go The experiment can be repeated using different values of P and obtaining different balance points.
An average value of W is then calculated.
3.5.2 Conditions of Equilibrium under the Action of Non- Parallel Coplanar Forces A set of non-parallel coplanar forces can act on a body to keep it in equilibrium.
The non-parallel forces can easily be resolved into horizontal and vertical components, giving rise to two parallel forces at right angles to each other.
The problem can then be treated as in section 3.1.5(a) with the method of that section applied separately to the horizontal and vertical compo nets of the forces.
The two condition of equilibrium for a body under such non-parallel forces would then be: (i) Forces 123PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The vector sum of all the forces acting on the body must be zero.
This means that the algebraic sum of the forces or components of the forces acting on the body on any direction must be zero, i.e.
S Fx = 0 or any algebraic sum of the horizontal must be zero and S Fy =0 or the algebraic sum of the vertical components must be zero.
(ii) Moments The algebraic sum of the moments of all the forces about any point on the plane or axis perpendicular to the plane of the forces must be zero.
Worked examples A force of 100N in equilibrium by two ropes as shown in Fig.1.13.
If one rope pulls the body in a horizontal direction and the other in a direction of 400 with the vertical, calculate the tension in each rope.

3.5.3 Equilibrium under the Action of Three Non-Parallel Forces (Special Case) For such a body to be in equilibrium, the following conditions must be satisfied: (i) The three forces must lie in a plane (i.e.
they must be coplanar forces.
(ii) The line of action of the forces must intersect in a common point.
(iii) The vectors representing the three forces can be arranged to form a closed triangle with side respectively parallel to the direction and proportional in length to the magnitude of the forces.
3.6 Centre of Gravity Definitions 125PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (i) The centre of gravity (C.G) of a body is defined as the point through which the line of action of the weight ofthe body always passes irrespective of the point at which the entire weight of the body appears to be concentrated.
(ii) The centre of mass of a body is defined as the point at which the total mass of the body appears to be concentrated.
Note: For small objects the centre of gravity (C.G) and the centre of mass coincide.
3.6.1 Position of C.G for some Regular Uniform Bodies (i) The C.G of a uniform rod is at the midpoint (G) of the rod.

Suspend the plumb line from the same point A on the lamina Repeat the procedure by suspending the lamina at B and C. if you have done the experiment carefully you will observe that the three lines intersect at a point which is the C.G.

This is because the lamina will always come to rest with its C.G.
vertically below the point of suspension when it is free to move.
3.7 Types of Stability of Equilibrium There are three types of stability of equilibrium which a body at rest may experience: (a) Stable equilibrium (b) Unstable equilibrium (c) Neutral equilibrium.
3.7.1 Stable Equilibrium Definition A body is said to be in stable equilibrium if it tends to return to its original position when slightly displaced.
Examples of bodies in stable equilibrium (i) A rectangular block resting in a horizontal surface.
(ii) A cone resting on its base (iii) A racing car with wide base and low C.G.
G R (a) RG (b) W W Fig.
1.16: Stability of rectangular block Consider a rectangular block resting on a horizontal surface (Fig 1.16).
In Fig.1.16 (a) the weight of the block W and the reaction R of the surface of the table are equal but opposite in direction and the same line 128PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS of action.
In Fig.
(b) the block has been given a slight tilt.
The line of action of W still falls within the base of the block.
W and are still equal and opposite but act along different lines as shown.
The two forces therefore constitute a couple which acts in a clockwise sense restore the block to its original position.
Hence the block is in stable equilibrium.
Requirements for Stable Equilibrium Generally, (i) a low C. G; and (ii) a wide base 3.7.2 Unstable Equilibrium Definition A body is said to be in unstable equilibrium if it tends to move further away from its original position or topples over when slightly displaced.
Examples of bodies in unstable equilibrium (i) a cone resting on its apex (ii) an egg resting on its pointed end.
(iii) A tight-rope walker (i.e.
a person walking on a tight rope).
W G G (a) R R (b) W A A Fig.
1 .17: Unstable equilibrium Consider a cone resting on its apex A (Fig.1.17) A.
In Fig.
1.17 (a) W and R are equal and opposite and have the same line of action.
As the conies slightly displaced (Fig 1.17(b)), the line of action of W quickly falls out of the apex.
W and R now constitute a couple with clockwise moment whose effect causes the cone to topple over or move further away from its original position.
Hence the cone is in unstable equilibrium.
3.7.3 Neutral Equilibrium 129PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Definition A body is said to be in neutral equilibrium if it tends to come to rest in its new position when slightly displaced.
Examples: (i) A cone, or cylinder or an egg resting on its side.
(ii) A ball or sphere on a smooth horizontal table (or surface).
D. R C A.
B. W. a. ball B A B c. W b Fig.
1.18 Consider the cylinder or cone resting on its side or the ball resting on the ground (Fig.1.18).
When the ball is slightly displaced, the weight of the ball has no moment about the point of contact with the ground.
The position of the C.G.
and the height of the C.G.
above the ground remain unchanged.
The bodies are therefore in neutral equilibrium.
3.7.4 Effect of Height of C.G.
on Stability of Equilibrium As already pointed out, the C.G.
of a body above the ground level and the width of the base of the object affect the stability of the object.
C D C D G 2 B 130 A A B (a) (b)PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • • Fig.1.19: Height of C.G.
and stability of an object y Consider a body in the form of a rectangle ABCD resting on a table (Fig.1.19 (a)).
Suppose the body is slightly lifted as in Fig.1.19 (b) if the body has a low C.G.
at G , the body will not topple over because the line 1 of action of the weight of the body passes within the base AB.
On other hand, if the body has a high C.G.
at G , a different situation will result if 2 the body is slightly titled about A. the line of action of the weight of the body (W) falls outside its base of support.
Therefore a wide base and low C.G.
enhance the stability of an object.
3.7.5 Application of the Effect of Height of C.G.
on Stability of Object (i) Racing cars are built low and with a wide wheel base to prevent them from overturning while negotiating bends at highspeed (ii) Cars engine are always located at the bottom of the car and not on the roof.
(iii) A tight rope walker often carries a weighted pole or umbrella (iv) Lorries that carry heavy loads usually have the loads stacked on the floor but not near the roof or on top of the roof.
(v) Certain toys which are difficult to topple are designed in such a way that they have low C.G.
and large base area.
3.8 Equilibrium of Bodies in Liquids 3.8.1 Concept of Upthrust Common experience shows that when a box is totally or partially immersed in a liquid such as water, the body appears to be lighter.
Such an object appears heavier when completely out of water.
This suggested there s an upward force exerted by a liquid on an object completely or partially immersed in it.
As a result of this upward force there is thus an apparent loss in weight of the immersed object.
This upward force is called the ‘upthrust’ of the liquid on the object.
.
Beaker u Liquid (water) 131 WPHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.20: Upthrust of liquids on an object Fig 1.20 shows an object completely immersed in water.
The weight of object in air is W, while weight in water is W .
The upthrust of the water 2 U is given by U= W -W .
Hence the apparent weight in water W is 1 2 2 given by W = W, -U.
Hence W is less than W .
The value of the 2 2 1 upthrust depends on the volume of the object immersed and the density of the liquid in which it is immersed.
The magnitude of the upthrust is given by Archimedes principle.
3.8.2 Archimedes Principle (statement) Archimedes principle states that when a body is totally or partially immersed in a fluid (liquid or gas), it experiences an upthrust which is equal to the weight of fluid displaced.
Formula for upthrust An object completely immersed in a liquid displaces a volume of liquid equal to its own volume.
The upthrust is the weight of this displaced volume of liquid and is given by = volume of object x density of liquid x g where g is acceleration due to gravity.
If upthrust is U, volume of object V and density of liquid ρ, then U = Vρg where, V = volume of object submerged, ρ = density of the fluid and g = acceleration of free fall.
If the object is partially immersed in the liquid (e.g.
only 2 of the object is immersed in the liquid), then 3 U = 2V x ρ x g 3 \ U = 2V ρ g 3 3.8.3 Verification of Archimedes Principle 132PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.21: Verification of Archimedes principle Fig.
1.21 shows the apparatus for an experiment to verify Archimedes principles.
A solid object (e.g.
a piece of stone) is freely suspended from a spring balance and its weight in air (W ) read off.
The object is then 1 gently lowered into the water in the Eureka can filled to the level of the spout as shown.
The weight of the object in water (W ) is read from the spring balance.
2 Water displaced by the object is collected in the beaker which has been previously weighed.
The beaker with water is reweighed to obtain the weight of water displaced.
The readings are recorded as follows: Weight of object in air = W 1 Weight of object in water = W 2 Weight of empty beaker =W 3 Weight of beaker + water displaced = W 4 Apparent loss of weight of object = W -W 1 2 Weight of water displaced = W -W 4 3 It will be found by comparing the values that W -W = W =W 1 2 4 3 Thus the apparent loss in weight of object (upthrust) is equal to weight of water displaced showing that an Archimedes principle is true.
The principle will be similarly confirmed if the experiment is repeated with the object only partially immersed in the water.
Worked example A spring balance reads 12.0N when a metal block is suspended from it and 10.0N when the block is completely immersed in water.
Calculate the upthrust on the block, the mass of water displaced, and the volume of the block.
133PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution (i) upthrust on block = loss in weight in water = 12.0N- 10.0N =2.0N (ii) weight of water displaced = upthrust = 2.0N \ mass of water displaced = weight g = 2.0 kg =0.2 kg 10 = 200 g. (iii) volume of block = volume of water displaced mass of water displaced = density of water = 0.2 kg = 2x10-4 m3 1000 kg m3 = 200 cm3 3.8.4 Principle of Floatation The Principle of floatation states that an object will float in a fluid (liquid or gas) when the upthrust exerted by the fluid in which it floats is equal to the weight of the object.
From the principles of floatation it can be said that: (1) A floating body displaces its own weight of the fluid in which it floats.
(2) Any floating body is in equilibrium under two forces, namely its own weight acting downwards and the upthrust of the liquid acting upwards.
(3) A body will float in a liquid if the density of the object is less than the density of the liquid.
(4) A body denser than a liquid can still float in the liquid, if the body is shaped in such a way that its volume can displace its own weight of the liquid.
For this reason metal ship floats in water because the large volume of the ship displaces a large volume of liquid whose weight counter balances the huge weight of the ship.
134PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Worked example A cube of wood of side 10 cm floats in water with 4.5 of its depth below the surface, and with its sides vertical.
What is the density of the wood?
Solution Volume of wood submerged = (10 x10 x4.5) cm3 = 450 cm3 \ volume of water displaced = 450 cm3 \ mass of water displaced = 450 cm3 (Density of water =1 gcm-3) Since a floating object displaces its own weight of fluid, then Mass of wood = 450 g Volume of wood = 1000 cm3 \ density of wood = 450 g 1000 cm3 =0.45g cm-3 3.9 Density and Relative Density Equal volumes of different substances have different masses or weights.
This is due to differences in the property of the substances known as density.
Definition The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume of the substance.
S.I unit of density is kilogram per metre cubed (kg/m3 or kg m-3) and its symbol is ρ ( rho).
Definition The relative density (R.d) of a substance is defined as: 135PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS mass (or weight) of a substances R.d.
= Mass (or weight) of equal volume of water Alternative definition of relative density is: density of substances R.d.
= Density of water Relative density has no unit since from the two definitions above, mass or weights are compared.
3.9.1 Measurement of Density and Relative density 1(a) The density of a regular solid (e.g.
wooden block) can easily be obtained by measuring its mass using a chemical balance.
The volume is obtained by measuring its dimensions.
Density Mass = Volume (a) The density of an irregular solid (e.g.
a piece of stone) can be obtained by first measuring the mass using a chemical balance.
The volume is obtained by immersing the solid completely in a measuring cylinder containing water.
The difference in the levels of water before and after the immersion of the solid gives the volume of the solid.
(b) Relative density of a solid which floats in water (e.g.
cork) is best measured by means of Archimedes principles as follows: Fig.
1.22: Relative density of a solid which floats The cork cannot sink in water of its own accord, therefore a “sinker’ is used to make it sink completely in water when immersed.
The sinker (e.g.
a glass stopper or brass weight) is first suspended from the hook of 136PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS a spring balance and its weight when completely immersed in water is noted from the spring balance (Fig 1.22(a)).
The cork is then tied to the thread carrying the sinker in such a way that the cork does not touch the water.
The weight of sinker in water and cork in the air is obtained (Fig.
1.22(b)).
The cork is then tied near the sinker and the weight a sinker and cork, both completely immersed in water is noted.
The relative density of cork is calculated as follows: Weight of sinker in water =W 1 Weigh of sinker in water and cork in air =W 2 Weight of cork in air =W -W 2 1 Upthrust on cork = Apparent loss in weight of cork ?
= W -(W -W ) 3 2 1 Relative density of cork = Weight of cork in air Weight of equal volume of water Weight of cork in air Upthrust on cork W -W = 2 1 W -W 2 3 3 (a) Relative density of solid in form of particles or powder (e.g.
sand) is best measured using a relative density bottle and a chemical balance.
This should be read up from physics texts by students.
(b) Relative density of solid particles or powder which dissolves in water (e.g.
table salt) is similarly measured using a relative density bottle, a chemical balance and a liquid in which the solid (powder) does not dissolve but whose density is know.
This should also be read up from physics texts by students.
4 (a) Relative density of a liquid using relative density bottle.
Liquid .
Fig.
1.23: Relative density of liquid The relative density bottle is cleaned, dried and weighed empty.
The bottle is filled with the liquid whose relative density is required, cleaned and reweighed.
The bottle is often emptied of the liquid, cleaned, dried 137PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS and reweighed when filled with water.
The relative density of the liquid is calculated as follows: Mass of empty bottle = M 1 Mass of bottle + liquid = M 2 Mass of bottle + water = M 3 Mass of liquid = M -M 2 1 Mass of equal volume of water = M -M 3 1 Relative density of liquid = mass of liquid Mass of equal volume of water M -M = 2 1 M -M 3 1 Relative density of a liquid can also be measured easily using Archimedes principle.
In this, case a solid (e.g.
glass stopper) is used.
The solid is suspended from the hook of a spring balance and weighed in air.
It is then weighted when completely immersed in a liquid whose relative density is required.
The solid is then cleaned, dried and reweighed when completely immersed in water.
The relative density if the liquid is calculated as follow: Mass of objects in air = M 1 Apparent mass of objects in liquid = M 2 Apparent mass of object in water = M 3 Upthrust in liquid = weight of liquid displaced by the objects = M –M 1 3 Upthrust in the water = weight of water displaced by the object = M -M 1 3 upthrust in liquid Relative density of liquid = Upthrust in water M -M = 1 2 M -M 1 3 Worked examples 138PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 1.
A body weighs 0.52N in air.
Totally immersed in water it weighs only 0.32N while its weight when immersed in another liquid is 0.36N.
The density of water is 1000 kg/m3.
What is the density of the other liquid?
Solution Upthrust in water = loss of weigh in water = 0.52N -0.32N= 0.20N Mass of water displaced = upthrust g = 0.20N =0.02 kg 10N kg.
Volume of water displaced = Mass Density = 0.20N kg = 0.20 kg 1000 kg.
\ Volume of water displaced = Mass Density = 0.02 kg = 0.02x10-3 m3 1000 kg Upthrust in liquid = loss of weight in liquid = 0.52N-0.36N = 0.16N \ Mass of liquid displaced = 0.16N 0.016 kg 10N kg Volume of liquid displaced = volume of water displaced = 0.02x10-3 m3 \ Density of liquid = mass of liquid displaced Volume of liquid displaced = 0.016 kg 0.02x10-3m3 = 0.8x103 kg/m3 = 800 kg/m3 2.
An empty relative density bottle has a mass of 15.0 g. When completely filled with water its mass is 39.0 g. What will be its mass if completely filled with acid of relative density 1.20?
139PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution Mass of water which fills bottle = 39g-15 g = 24 g Volume of water which fills bottle = mass (Density of water = 1gm /cm3) density = 24g = 24 cm3 1g cm3 Relative density of liquid = mass of liquid Mass of equal volume of water \ 1.20 = mass of liquid 24 g \ mass of liquid which fills bottle =1.20x24 g =28.8 g \ mass of bottle completely filled with liquid (acid) =28.8+15.0 g = 48.3 g 3.9.2 The Hydrometer 140PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.24: Simple hydrometer The hydrometer is an instrument used to measure the relative density of liquids.
The Principle of the Hydrometer Consider a test tube weighted by means of lead shots so that it can float upright in a beaker of water as shown in Fig.
1.24.
If the tube is floated in different liquids it will be noted that the length of the tube submerged in liquid is different for different liquids.
This is due to the differences in the relative densities of the liquids.
Suppose the weight of the text tube (with the lead shots) is W. each time the tube floats in a liquid, the weight of liquid displaced is W Newton’s \ Volume of liquid displaced = mass W = Density ρg where ρ is the density of the liquid and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
If the cross-sectional area of the tube is A and the length, of the tube submerged is l, then: Volume of liquid = Axl \ Al = W ρg \ L = W Aρg \ L (cid:181) L ρ Since W, A and g are constants.
The above relationship implies that the length of the test-tube submerged in the liquid is inversely proportional to the density of the 141PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS liquid, i.e.
the higher the density of liquid, the shorter the length of the tube immersed and vice versa.
The working of the hydrometer is used on this principle, that is, the less the density of a liquid, the more the hydrometer sinks in it.
3.9.3 The Practical Hydrometer Fig.
1.25: A battery hydrometer Fig.
1.25 shows a practical hydrometer which is commonly used in daily life to measure the relative densities of liquids.
The real hydrometer is housed (as shown) in an endorser with a glass chamber into which the liquid (whose relative density is required) can be drawn so that the hydrometer can float in it and the value of the relative density can be read directly.
Uses of the practical hydrometer (i) Checking the relative density of batteries (ii) Testing the purity of liquids whose densities are know (iii) Testing the quality of milk SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Explain what you understand by the term “force”.
Define the terms “resultant” and “equilibrant” with respect to the forces 142PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS acting at a point and explain the differences between the two terms.
A force of 10N acts in the direction E 600 N while another force of 15N in the easterly direction if both forcesa act at a point, point, find (i) the resultant, and (ii) the equilibrant of the two forces.
2.
State the law of triangle of forces and briefly describe an experiment to illustrate it.
An object of mass 700 g hangs from the end of a long sting attached to a support.
A horizontal sting attached to the object pulls it in such a way that the first string makes an angle 300 with the vertical.
Find the tensions in the two strings.
3 Explain what is meant by the “moment of a force”.
State the principle of moments and give two examples of the practical application of the principle in everyday life.
A uniform plank AB has length 5 m and mass 80 kg.
It is supported horizontal on two points C and D where C is 1m from the end A and D is 1 m from the end B of the plank.
Find the magnitude and direction of the minimum force which would be applied at; A (i) to lift the plank just off the pivot at C, (ii) to lift the plank just clear of the pivot at D 4 State the Principle of Archimedes and explain what is meant by “upthrust” exerted by a fluid on an object immersed in it.
How is a submarine made (i) to sink to a point below the surface ofwater (ii) to rise to the surface of water from beneath it?
A floating crane has mass 20600 kg and floats in sea water of density 1.03 g/cm3.
If the base of the crane is a rectangular block 4m square and 2.5m deep, what is the maximum mass which can be lifted by the krane when the top of the base is just awash with water.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you learned about cause of motion – force.
You also learned resultant force and forces in equilibrium.
Furthermore, you learned about laws governing bodies in equilibrium.
In addition you learned Archimedes principle, the principle of floating and relative density.
Finally, you learned the applications of the laws and principles in solving numerical problem.
5.0 SUMMARY 143PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 1.
Motion is caused by a “force” which is essentially a “push” or “pull”, acting on the moving object.
There are four major groups or fields of force, namely; gravitational, electric or electrostatic, magnetic and nuclear force.
2.
The “resultant force” is that simple force which, acting alone will have the same effect in magnitude and direction as two or more forces acting together.
3.
A body is said to be in equilibrium if (a) The body as a whole either remains at rest or moves in a straight line with constant speed, or (b) The body is rotating with a constant angular velocity or is not rotating at all.
4.
The “equilibrant force” is that single force which will balance all the other forces taken together.
The equilibrant force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force.
5.
The "law of triangle of forces” states that when three forces are in equilibrium, they can be represented in magnitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.
6.
The “moments of a force” about a point or axis is the turning effect of the force about that point or axis.
It is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance of the line of action of the points from the point.
7.
For a body in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments at a point equals the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same points.
This is also called the “principle of moments”.
8.
Two equal but opposite parallel forces which are not acting in a line is called a “couple” 9.
The “centre of gravity” of a body is the point through which the line of action of the weight of the body always acts, or it is the point at which the entire weight of the body appears to be concentrated.
10.
A body is said to be: (i) In “stable equilibrium” if it tends to return to its original position when slightly displaced.
144PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (ii) In “unstable equilibrium” if when slightly displaced, it tends to move further away from its original position.
(iii) In “neutral equilibrium” if when slightly displayed, its tends to come to rest in its new position 11.
For adequate stability, a body requires (i) a wide base of support, and a low centre of gravity.
12.
“Archimedes principle” states that when a body is totally or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upthrust which is equal to the weight of fluid displaced 13.
“The principle of flotation” states that an object floats in a fluid when the upthrust exerted upon it by the fluid is equal to the weight of the object.
14 “ Relative density (R.d)” of a substance is defined by: mass of substance R.d = Mass of equal volume of water = density of substance density of water = upthrust in liquid upthrust in water Relative density has no units.
It can be measured with a “hydrometer”.
6.0 TUTOR- MARKED ASSIGNMENT 1.

INTRODUCTION In this unit you will learn about friction in solids and liquids.
Whenever one moves or tends to move over another surface, frictional forces are called into play.
Friction is unavoidable because no surface is perfectly smooth.
When one object rubs against another, the roughness of their surfaces prevents them from sliding freely over another.
Frictional forces in liquids (viscosity) explain why some liquids flow easily and others do not.
2.0.
OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: 147PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • identify a force resisting the motion between two surfaces in contact and moving relative to each other.
• define friction and viscosity • state the advantages and disadvantages of friction.
• reduce friction in a given situation • classify liquids according to their viscous properties.
• give at least two applications of viscosity.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1.
Concept of Friction You are aware that when a solid is in contact with another, the roughness of their surfaces prevents them from sliding freely over one another.
Such action is brought about by the effect of friction.
Frictional forces act tangential to the surface of separation between two bodies in contact.
It does not appear unless there is relative motion or a force tending to produce motion, then it always appears to oppose the motion or the force tending to produce motion.
You have to overcome some frictional force before an object can move over another.
The frictional force continues to act as long as one body moves over another.
When you withdraw the force producing the motion, friction slows down the moving body until it eventually comes to rest.
 Friction is defined as a force which acts at the surface of separation between two objects in contacts and tends to oppose the motion of one over the other.
3.2.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Friction 3.2.1.
Advantages of Friction We desire friction for the following reasons: i.
Without friction, it would be impossible for us to walk or to stop walking after getting started.
Friction protects us from slipping while walking.
148PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS ii.
Friction enables the automobile tyres to make a firm grip with the road thus aiding their movement.
The threading pattern of vehicle tyres is designed to give the tyre a good grip on the road.
iii.
Friction enables the locomotive engine to pull the train on the nail.
iv.
Friction is utilized in fan belts used over wheels or pulleys in machinery.
The belting that drives the wheels in machines depends on friction to make the wheels turn without slipping.
v. Friction enables a screw or a nail to remain in place after being screwed into position.
Such nails thus hold pieces of wood together because of the friction between the nails and the wood.
vi.
Friction is used in the grindstone to sharpen knives and chisels.
The grindstone’s rough surface wears away the metal surface to sharpen them.
vii.
Friction enables the brakes to stop the car and train 3.2.2.
Disadvantages of Friction i.
Friction leads to wear and tear on the moving parts of machines.
ii.
Friction reduces the efficiency of machines because it causes loss of energy.
Much useless work is therefore done by machine in overcoming friction which opposes their motion.
iii.
It causes heating of engines.
Energy that must be used to overcome friction is converted into heat.
This results in the bearing of machines getting hot when they are running.
Sometimes, the energy is converted to sound.
3.3.
Methods and Reasons for Reducing Friction Here we consider three major ways of reducing friction.
You may have been using these methods in reducing friction in the past and you may also know other methods.
These are: i.
The use of lubricants like oil, grease, air and graphite.
You can use lubricants to keep two metal surfaces from coming into direct contact.
You can also do this by maintaining a layer of air or other gases between them.
149PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS ii.
The use of ball or roller bearing.
Where a wheel is turning on an axle, the use of ball or roller bearings reduces friction.
These are like wheels within wheels and are precisely shaped and have specially hardened surfaces.
In roller bearings, the surfaces do not slide but roll over the others and rolling friction is much less than sliding friction.
iii.
The streamlining of body shapes of moving objects.
You can reduce friction by shaping a body to the streamlines of the fluid through which it is moving.
This reduces the frictional force or retarding force.
You will notice that modern cars, ships and aero- planes are made in such shapes as to lesson the friction between them and the fluid or the medium through which they move.
We try to reduce friction in machines for two reasons i. it causes wear and tear ii.
it uses up energy and reduces efficiency.
3.4.
Types of Friction There are two types of frictions which we are going to define here.
These are: i. Static or Limiting Friction This is the maximum force that must be overcome before a body can just start to move over another.
ii.
Kinetic or Dynamic Friction This is the force that must be overcome so that a body can move with uniform speed over another body.
• Usually dynamic friction is slightly less than the static friction.
3.5 Laws of Friction and Coefficient of Static Friction 3.5.1 Laws of Friction At this point you will learn the laws of friction.
They are: 150PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS i.
Friction opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact.
It acts in a direction opposite to that of the motion.
ii.
The force of friction increases to the same extent as the force which tends to start the motion.
iii.
Frictional force depends on the two surfaces in contact- the nature of the substance and the conditions of the surfaces such as a rough, smooth, polished, wet, dry and others.
iv.
It is independent of the area of the surfaces in contact.
v. It varies directly with the normal force pressing the surfaces together.
That is, it is proportional to the normal reaction R. 3.5.2 Coefficient of Friction Results of earlier experiments show that the frictional force F is roughly proportional to the normal reaction R between the two surfaces in contact.
That is: F & R Or F = M R --------- (1) The constant M is known as the coefficient of friction.
M = F R ----------- (2) Equation (2) defines • The coefficient of friction (M ) as the ratio M = Frictioned force F Normal reaction between the two surfaces in contact R You will note that: i.
For static friction, the frictional force F required to determine M in the above equation is the maximum force required to start the body moving and M is called the coefficient of static or limiting friction.
151PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS ii.
For kinetic friction, the frictional force used is the force required to keep the body in uniform motion and M in the above equation is known as coefficient of dynamic or kinetic friction.
iii.
The coefficient of static friction is greater than the coefficient of dynamic friction.
iv.
From experience you know that more force is required to start a body sliding along a surface than is required to keep it in motion once it is started.
3.6 Determination of the Coefficient of Static Fiction Using: 1.
Horizontal Plane.
To determine the coefficient of static friction using a horizontal plane you will need the apparatus set up as shown in Fig.
2.1.
You will now follow these procedures.
• Weigh the block of wood B with a spring balance and record its weight (W ).
B • Place the block of wood on the horizontal board and connect it to a cord adjusted in such a way that it pulls parallel to the surface of the board.
• Pass the cord over a pulley and attach it to a scale pan to which known weights can be added.
• Suspend known weights in the scale pan until the block is just about to move.
• Tap the block gently to prevent sticking each time a weight is added into the pan.
• Place a known weight on the block B and increase the weight on the scale pan until the block is just about to move again after gentle tapping.
• Repeat the experiment five more times by varying M and noting the corresponding values of W in the scale pan.
• The total weight pulling the block also includes the weight of the scale pan (Wo) • Tabulate your readings as shown in Table 2.1.
M R = W + M F = W + Wo B 152PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Table 2.1 • Plot a graph of force (W + Wo) against normal reaction R = (W B + M) and determine slope of the graph which is the coefficient of static friction.
The graph of an a earlier experiment is as shown in Fig.
2.2 below.

Fig.
2.2: Graph of F against ii.
Inclined Plane You can also determine the coefficient of static friction M by using inclined plane.
Here, you will obtain the value of M for the two surfaces by placing the block A on B as shown in Fig.
2.3 and gradually increasing the angle 0 of inclination of B to the horizontal unit A is just about to move down the plane.
153PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS A h q Fig.
2.3: Block A on an inclined plane with angle Q • Measure the values of x and h using your metre rule.
You will then obtain the value of M (the coefficient of friction) by evaluating the expression relating M to the values of x and h. That is: tan q = h/x = M (3) Precautions You will take the following precautions while determining the coefficient of friction • Take repeated readings.
• The block of wood should be started at the same spot each time.
• The inclined plane should be gradually increased.
• The weight in the scale pan should be gradually increased.
• It is more accurate to measure q by measuring h and x.

The block just begins to move when the spring balance records a horizontal force of 2.5N.
i what is the coefficient of static friction?
ii what is the frictional force when a horizontal force of 2.0N is recorded by the spring balance.
3.7 Viscosity 3.7.1 Concept of Viscosity Frictional forces also exist between different layers of liquid surfaces.
We refer to such frictional force as viscosity.
The viscosity of a liquid is low if the frictional force is low and vice versa.
For instance, if you throw an object into water and a similar object into palm oil, the object moving through water will experience less resistance than when it moves through palm oil because the viscosity of water is Lower than that of palm oil.
This makes the object to move faster in water.
The attraction between molecules in neighboring layers of a liquid is responsible for the viscosity of the liquid.
Viscosity can be defined as the property of a fluid which tends to prevent motion of one part over another.
It is the internal friction between layers of a liquid or gas in motion.
The viscosity of a liquid rapidly decreases as its temperature rises.
You will have noticed that tar which is used for making roads is first heated so that it will flow readily.
You can compare the viscosity of liquids roughly by dropping a small steel ball –bearing into a tall wide cylindrical vessel filled with the various liquids whose viscosity you want to compare.
You will then measure the time it will take the ball bearing to fall through the liquids.
You will notice that with water, the ball bearing fall rapidly.
It falls fairly slowly in oil, and very slowly in glycerine (Fig.
2.5).
157PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Viscous force +upthrust Weight A- Water B- Engine oil C-Glycerine Fig.
2.5: Motion in a viscous liquid 3.7.2 Effects of Viscosity Here we look at some important applications of viscosity.
You may have identified some of this yourself in our earlier discussions although you may not have categorized them under this heading.
The viscosity of oil is very important in selecting suitable lubricants for the various sections of the machines.
We use more viscous oils for heavier machines than in light ones.
Oils, grease and air are used as lubricants because of their viscosity.
We use engine oils in lubricating engines to keep metal surfaces from rubbing against each other.
Water is not used as a lubricant because it has low viscosity.
The viscosity of oils and greases decrease with temperature.
Therefore, their lubricating effects are lowered at high temperature.
The viscosity of the air makes the bob of a swinging pendulum come to rest more quickly with a cord attachment to the string than without a cord.
The wider the area of the cord the greater the viscous force opposing the pendulum’s motion and the pendulum bob comes to rest quicker.
158PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.8 Laws of Viscosity and Coefficient of Viscosity 3.8.1 Laws of Viscosity • It opposes motion (like solid friction).
• It depends on the area of the surface in contact (unlike solid friction).
• It depends on the relative motion between the layers (unlike solid friction).
• It depends on the nature of the liquid.
It is independent of normal reaction (unlike solid friction).
3.8.2 Coefficient of Viscosity The coefficient of viscosity of a fluid is a measure of the viscosity of the fluid.
To define this coefficient, let us consider a thin layer of liquid between two flat parallel plates (Fig.
2.6).
If the lower plate is held in a fixed position, F A d Fig.
2.6: Viscosity of a fluid Each layer moves with a small velocity relative to an adjacent layer.
a force F, is required to move the upper plate at a constant speed.
This force is observed to be proportional to the area A, and the speed V, of the moving plate, and inversely proportional to the thickness d, of the liquid between the plates, that is, F (cid:181) AV d Or F = h AV d 159PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Where h , the constant of proportional, is the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid, We have that h = fd = F/A AV V/d The ratio; i, F/A is force per unit area (pressure) Unit: Pa Ii, V/d is velocity gradient Units: S-1 \ S. I .unit of coefficient of friction is Pascal second (PaS).

3.9 Motion of a Ball in a Viscous Liquid When you throw a steel ball to fall through a viscous liquid, the ball is subject to three forces: • Its weight (w) acting downwards; • The upthrust (u) of the liquid on the stone acting upwards, and • The viscous force acting opposite to the motion of the ball i.e.
upwards.
This is shown in Fig.
2.7 below.
160PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
2.7: A ball falling through a viscous liquid The ball accelerates at first but finally attains a uniform velocity known as terminal velocity.
At first the equation of motion is given by mg – v – u = ma Where v = viscous force, u = upthrust, m = mass of the ball, g = accn due to gravity and a = acceleration of the ball in motion.
When the terminal velocity is reached, a = 0, The equation becomes; Mg - V - U = 0 (cid:222) mg = V + U.
(Mg = w) Or V = W-U This constant velocity (v) is termed the terminal velocity.
Fig.
2.8 shows the variation of velocity with time as an object dropped inside a viscous liquid attains termined velocity.

Similarities • Both forces oppose relative motion between surfaces.
• Both depend on the nature of the materials in contact.
Differences • Friction does not depend on area of surfaces in contact; viscosity depends on areas of surfaces in contact.
• Friction is dependent on normal reaction, viscosity is not.
• Friction occurs in solids, viscosity takes place in liquids and gases (fluids).
• Friction does not depend on the relative velocities between two layers; viscosity depends on the relative velocity between layers.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Momentum and Impulse 3.1.1 Momentum Definition The momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and its velocity.
If a body of mass m moves with a velocity v, then its momentum p is given by: P = mv Unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second (kgms-1).
Momentum is a vector, its magnitude is the numerical value of the product m x v and its direction is the direction of v. 166PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Bodies moving in a straight line possess “linear momentum” while rotating bodies have “angular momentum”.
3.1.2 Impulse Definition Impulse is defined as the product of the average force on the particle and the time during which it acts.
If a force F acts for a short time t, the impulse I is given by I = F x t Impulse is a vector with magnitude equal to the product F x t, and direction same as that of the force F. The unit of impulse is Newton – second (Ns).
Worked examples 1 A body of mass 4.0 kg moves with a velocity of 15 ms-1.
Calculate the momentum of the body?
Solution P = mv :.
p = 4kg x 15m S = 60 kg ms-1 2 An average force of 30N hits a stationary ball for a time of 0.025.
What is the impulse experienced by the ball?
Solution I = Ft :.
I = 30 N x 0.02s = 0.6 Ns 167PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.2 Newton’s Laws of Motion 3.2.1 Newton’s First Law of Motion Statement Newton’s law of motion states that every object continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
Importance of Newton’s first law (i) The law identifies inertia as an inherent property of a body at rest or moving with a constant velocity.
Inertia is thus a property of matter and may be defined as the reluctance of a body to change its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless an external force acts on it.
The mass of a body is a measure of its inertia.
The greater the mass of a body, the greater its inertia and vice versa.
(ii) Newton’s first law explains why passengers in a fast moving vehicle tend to move forward when the vehicle stops suddenly, or jers backwards when the vehicle suddenly speeds off, since there is little or no force to restrain them.
For this reason motorists are advised to use seat belts (or safety belts) while traveling in their cars.
(iii) Newton’s first law also explains what force does, although it does not suggest how it should be measured.
3.2.2 Newton’s Second Law of Motion Statement Newton’s second law states that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the force causing motion and takes place in the direction of that force.
Importance of Newton’s Second Law (i) It enables us to define an absolute unit of force which remains constant under all conditions.
(ii) It gives a measure of force as product of mass and acceleration.
(iii) It gives an operational definition of force as the rate of change of momentum.
168PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS According to Newton’s Second Law, F α change in momentum time taken for the change i.e.
F α mv – mu t where m, u, v, t are mass, initial velocity, final velocity and time respectively of motion of the body acted upon by a force, F. \ F α mv – mu or f m(v – u) t t \ F α ma, where v – u = acceleration, a. t F = k ma, where k = constant.
In the S.I.
unit system, F is in Newton, m in kilogram, and the acceleration, a in meter per sec squared (ms-2).
The Newton is chosen such that K has a value of 1.
\ F = ma Definition The Newton is defined as the unit of force which gives a mass of 1kg an acceleration of 1ms-2.
Worked examples 1.
A mass of 5.0 kg is acted upon by an unbalanced force of 25N.
What acceleration does the force give the mass?
Solution F = ma 25N = 5 kg x a \ a = 25N/5 kg = 25kgms-2/5 kg = 5ms-2 2.
A stone of mass 900 g is pushed along a floor by a horizontal force of 20N.
A frictional force of 8N opposed the motion of the stone.
Calculate the acceleration given to the stone.
169PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution Unbalanced force = (20 – 8) N = 12N F = ma 12N = 900 kg x a 1000 \ a = 12 x 1000 ms-2 900 = 13.33 ms-2.

A steel ball of mass 0.1 kg fell from a height of 8 m onto a hard surface and bounced back to a height of 2 m. Calculate the change of momentum.
If the ball was in contact with the hard surface for 0.15s, find the force exerted on the surface (g = 10 ms-2) Solution Velocity v of the ball on hitting the floor is given by v 2 = u2 + 2gh i.e.
v = (cid:214) 0+2 x 10x8 m = (cid:214) 160 m2 s2 \ v = 12.65 ms-1 let the velocity with which the ball left the surface after impact be U , 1 At maximum height the (final) velocity is zero.
Hence 0 = u 2-2gh 1 \ 0 = u 2-2 x10 m x 2 m 1 s2 \ u 2 = 40m2 1 s2 i. u = (cid:214) 40m2 = 6.32 ms-1 1 s2 170PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Change in momentum = mv + mu , i.e (mv-(-mu,)) 1 = 0.1(12.65+6.32) = 1.897 kgms-1 (or Ns) (Note that if the momentum before hitting the surface is positive, then momentum after hitting the surface is negative.
Hence change in momentum is mv-(-mu,) = mv + mu ) 1 Force = Change in momentum time = 1.897 Ns 0.15s =12.646N =12.6N 3.2.3 Newton’s Third Law Statement Newton’s third law of motion states that to any action there is an aqual and opposite reaction.
Example of Newton’s Third Law in operation 1.
If you hit your head against the wall, you exert some force on the wall and the wall in turn exerts an equal and opposite force on your head.
If the force you exerted on the wall is sizeable, then pain you would feel on your head is a confirmation of Newton’s third law.
This implies that forces are always paired.
No single force exists in isolation.
R Block of wood Surface of table W Fig.3.1: Wooden block resting on a table ii.
If you place an object (e.g.
a wooden block) on a table, it will remain at rest at the spot you left it (Fig.3.1).
The block exerts on 171PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the table a force equal to its weight.
The table exerts on the block a reaction force, R, equal and opposite of W. since the two forces balance, the block remains at rest on the table.
iii.
The recoil of a gun, If you fire a bullet from a gun, you will observe that the gun jerks backwards or recoils (Fig.3.2).
The force propelling the bullet forward (action) must be equal to the recoil force (reaction) acting on the gun (i.e.
opposite).
The jerking of the gun (which you will fell in your hand) is actually due to the conservation of momentum.
Fig.
2.3.2 Recoil of a gun 3.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum 3.3.1 Statement of Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum The principle of conservation of linear momentum may be stated in different ways as follows: i.
In any system of colliding objects, the total momentum is always conserved provided that there is no net external force acting on the system.
OR ii.
The total momentum of an isolated or closed system of colliding bodies remains constant OR iii.
If two or more bodies collide in a closed system, the total momentum after the collision is equal to the total momentum before the collision.
Closed System: A closed or isolated system is a system on which no external forces act.
The only forces 172PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS acting in a closed system of colliding bodies are those due to the collisions.
The principle of conservation of linear momentum follows from Newton’s seconds and third laws of motion.

173PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Since we have defined momentum as mass x velocity equation (4) means that the total momentum of the system before the impact is equal to the total momentum after the impact.

The kinetic energy after collision is less than the kinetic energy before collision Hence, (i) m u + m u = m v + m v 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 (ii) E > E k1 k2 Where E is the total K.E before impact and E is the total K.E after k1 k2 impact.
OR 1 m U 2 + 1 m U 2 > 1 m v 2 + 1 m v 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 i.e ∑ KE before > ∑ KE after where ∑ EK before is the total Kinetic Energy before impact and ∑ EK after is the total Kinetic Energy after impact In inelastic collision, the colliding bodies usually stick together and move as a unit after collision, so as that v = v = v. 1 2 Hence Total kinetic energy before= 1 m u 2 +1m u 2 and 1 1 2 2 2 2 Total kinetic energy after = 1 m v2 + 1 m v 1 2 2 2 2 or EK =1 (m m )v 2 1 2 2 1 m u 2 +1 m2 u 2 > 1 (m +m ) v 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 176PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Study explosion and compare it with elastic and inelastic collision 3.4 More Applications (Examples) of Newton’s Law and the Conservation of Linear Momentum Law 3.4.1 How Walking is Possible A person walks by pushing with his/her foot against the ground and the ground exerts an equal and opposite force on the person (Fig.3.5) Fig...3.5: How walking is possible It is this reaction force of the ground on the person walking which moves him or her forward.
Thus a person walking is actually pushed forward by the reaction force of the ground on him and not by his on her own push.
3.4.2 Jet and Rocket Propulsion Fig.
3.6: Jet propulsion: action and reaction forces The principle of conservation of linear momentum and Newton’s third laws are also in 177PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the propulsion of jet aircraft and the rockets used for launching satellites.
Gases are burnt in the combustion chambers of the engine.
When jets of hot gases are expelled downwards through the tail nozzle at high speeds, from rocket or aircraft, an equal opposite momentum is given to the rocket or aircraft causing it to move.
3.4.3 The Lawn Sprayer Fig.3.7: the lawn sprayer The lawn sprayer is a device used to water a lawn or garden (Fig.3.7).
It combines Newton’s third law, the law of conservation of momentum and the principles of a couple in its operation.
Water issues from the forward and backward nozzles of the sprayer at the same speed.
The reaction forces due to the thrust of the water from the two jets constitute a couple whose moment causes the sprayer to rotate and so water the lawn or garden.
Worked example A rocket burns fuel at the rate of 200 g s-1 and is ejecting all the gas in one direction at the rate of 400 ms-1.
Find the maximum weight the rocket can have if it is going to move vertically upwards.
Solution Mass of gas per second = 200 kg s-1 1000 Velocity of expulsion = 400 ms-1 Momentum change per second = 200 x400 kg ms-2 1000 From Newton’s second law, we have 178PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS F = w 200 x 400 F = 1000 \ F = 80N 3.5 Inertial Mass and Weight 3.5.1 Inertial Mass Mass was defined by Newton as the “quantity of matter in a body”.
We have seen from Newton’s first law that “inertia”, the reluctance of a body to change its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, is an inherent property of matter.
The mass of a body can also be defined as “a quantitative measure of the inertia of a body”.
The more the mass a body has, the greater the force required to change its state of or uniform motion in a straight line and the greater the force required to give an acceleration M (cid:181) F .
Thus a this inherent property of matter is also called “inertial mass”.
Definition The inertial mass of a body is a property of matter which represents the resistance of the body to any kind of force whatever.
The mass of a body gives a quantitative measure of its inertial mass.
3.5.2 Weight Definition The weight of a body is the force acting on the body due to the earth’s gravitational pull.
The weight (w) of a body is given by W = mg where m is the mass of the body and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
3.5.3 Weight of a Body Inside a Lift 179PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.3.8: Weight of an object in a lift Suppose you are standing in a lift or elevator.
Two forces act on you: (i) your true weight (w = mg) acting vertically downwards, and (ii) the reaction R of the floor of the elevator on you acting upwards.
We will use two forces to consider the apparent variation in your weight (which you will feel) as the lift: (a) is stationary (b) accelerates upwards (c) accelerates downwards, or (d) falls freely under gravity, if the cable is cut.
(a) When the elevator is stationary or moves with constant velocity (Fig..3.8a), the acceleration, a = o and we have that W = mg = R…………………………….. (1) If you are standing on a spring scale, it will record your true weight.
180PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (b) When the lift accelerates upwards with an acceleration a (Fig.3.8.b), you will also be pulled up with an acceleration a while still standing on the floor of the lift.
The unbalanced force (F) acting on you is given by F = ma =R , = mG 1 \ R , = ma + mg = m (a+g) 1 Therefore your apparent weight W , when the elevator moves upwards 1 with acceleration a (and which is balanced by R ,) is given by 1 F = ma = R, -mg \ R, = ma + mg = m (a+g) (c) Therefore your apparent weight W, when the elevator moves upwards with acceleration a (and which is balanced by R) is given by W = R = m (a+g) ……………………….
1 1 (2) It is clear from (1) and (2) that.
W > W. 1 You will therefore feel yourself pressing downwards (R ,) on the 1 floor with a larger force than when the lift is at rest.
Your apparent weight (W ,) as recorded by the scale will be greater 1 than your true weight (W).
(c) When the elevator accelerates downwards with acceleration, a (Fig.3.8c), the unbalanced force on you is F= ma = mg = R 2 iii.
W = R = m (g-a) …………………… (3) 2 2 The scale on which you stand will read this value W .
From (2) 2 and (3) it is clear that W>W , hence your apparent weight, W 2 2 will be less than your true weight and you will feel ligher.
(d) In this case, the lift cable is cut and it falls freely with an acceleration, a = g (Fig.3.8d).
You will also fall freely with a = g. when this happens, we see from (3), that W = m (g-a) =o 3 181PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Thus you will appear to have no weight (i.e.
weightless).
You will exert no force on the floor and the floor will exert no force on you.
The scale reads zero.
3.5.4 Satellites and Weightlessness Without gravity Earth With gravity Fig.3.9: Free-fall of satellites: Weightlessness Persons and objects inside a satellite orbiting close to the earth are said to experience weightlessness.
This weightlessness is similar to the one you would feel in a freely falling elevator as already discussed.
When a satellite moves round in an orbit close to the earth, the force of gravity forces it to “fall” out of its natural straight line path (Fig.3.9).
While orbiting round the earth, the earth’s gravitational pull is just enough to provide the centripetal force mv 2 required for the orbital movement, where m r is mass of the satellite, v its speed and r the radius of the orbit.
Thus mv 2 = mg r The satellite therefore falls all the time.
It does not strike the ground, however, because its initial horizontal velocity causes it to miss the surface of the earth.
As a result of this free fall situation, every person and object within the satellite is also falling freely under the gravity.
Hence such persons and objects within the satellite appear to be weightless (.i.e experience seeming weightlessness) 182PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Worked example An object of mass 70 kg rests on a spring weighing machine inside a lift.
The lift ascends with an acceleration of 2.5 ms-2.
Calculate the reading of the weighing machine.
What will the reading of the machine be if the velocity of the lift is constant?
(g = 10 ms-2) R a = 2.5ms-2 W Fig.
3.10 Solution (i) The unbalanced force F is given by F = ma = R- mg \ R = m (g+a) = 70x (10+2.5) =875N (ii) When the velocity is constant, acceleration is zero R = m (g+o) = mg =70x10 =700N SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Distinguish between momentum and impulse and state the relationship between them.
An object of mass 5 kg moving with a velocity of 30 ms-1 is suddenly hit by another body B moving in the same direction.
If the velocity of A is changed to 50 ms-1 in the same direction, calculate the impulse received by it.
183PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 2.
State Newton’s laws of motion.
Show how the second law enables us to define an absolute unit of force which remains constant under all conditions.

If the body is in contact with the floor for 0.1 sec.
find the force exerted on the body.
3.
Explain what is meant by the term “inertia” of a body.
A mass of 5 kg on a horizontal table surface with coefficient of friction 0.2 is connected to a second mass of 10 kg over a frictionless pulley.
If g= 10 ms-2, calculate the acceleration of the system when released.
4.
Why does a body in a lift appear to be weightless when the lift is A body of mass 10 kg is to be given an acceleration of 20 ms-2.
Find the force required when the acceleration is (i) vertically upwards,(ii) horizontal and the body moves over a surface whose coefficient of friction is 0.5.
(Take g=10 ms-2) 5.
State the principle of conservation of linear momentum.
A ball of mass 50 kg moving with a velocity of 10 ms-1 collides with another ball of mass 60 g moving with 5 ms-1 in the opposite direction.
If the two balls stick together after collision, find the magnitude and direction of their common velocity.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you learned linear momentum when we discussed the influence of unbalanced forces on bodies, the notion of objects and the laws governing such objects.
You also learned the collision between bodies and the laws governing various types of collisions.
5.0 SUMMARY 1.
Momentum (p) of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity (p = mv) 2.
Impulse (I) is the product of the force and the time during which the force acts (I =n).
Impulse acts only for a short time.
3.
Newton’s laws of motion are as follows: First law: Every object continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
This law leads to the idea of “inertia” which is the 184PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS tendency of a body to preserve its state of rest or uniform motion.
Second law: The rate of change of momentum is proportional to the impressed force and takes place in the direction of the force.
This law leads to the law F = ma.
Third law: Action and reaction are equal and opposite.
4.
Principle of conservation of linear momentum states that when two or more bodies act on one another their total momentum remains constant that is conserved provided there are no external forces acting on the bodies.Such a system of bodies is called an isolated or closed system.
5.
In elastic collisions, both the linear momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
In inelastic collision, linear momentum is conserved but kinetic energy decreases.
6.
Mass is the quantity of matter in a body.
It is also a measure of the inertia of a body.
Mass is constant all over the earth.
7.
“Inertial mass” is a measure of the tendency of a body to resist a change in momentum.
According to Newton’s second law of motion, F (cid:181) a, the constant of proportionality is the inertial mass.
8.
Weight of an object is the force with which the earth pulls the body to the earth’s centre.
Weight varies from place to place because the acceleration due to the earth’s gravity (g) varies from place to place and weight of an object w=mg.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept, Definition and Examples of Simple Machine A machine enables us to overcome a large resistance or load by applying a small effect.
A machine enables us to do work more easily and conveniently than could be done without it.
Its purpose is to exert force on an object which is usually applied to the machine.
Sometimes the force which the machine exerts is in a different direction from that of the applied force.
3.1.2 Definition A machine is a device or tool which allows a force (or effort) applied at one point to overcome a resisting force (or load) at another point.
3.1.3 Examples of Simple Machines You already know some of the simple machines which you come across in your everyday life.
These machines are the lever, pulleys, pliers wheelbarrows, nut-crackers, the wedge, wheel and axle, inclined plane, screw jack and many others.
3.2.1 Definitions of (1) Force Ratio (ii) Velocity Ratio (iii) Efficiency of a Machine • Force ratio or mechanical advantage We define efforts as the force applied to a machine and load as the force or resistance overcome by the machine.
The ability of a machine to overcome a large load through a small effect is seen as Force Ratio or Mechanical Advantage (MA).
This is given by: 188PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Force ratio or mechanical advantage MA = LOAD EFFORT The load you will take as the output force and the effort as the input force.
You can therefore define mechanical advantage or force ratio by: Mechanical Advantage or Force Ratio =Output force Input force i.e.
MA or FR =Output force Input force You will note that the mechanical advantage of a machine is influenced by friction in the parts.
You will use part of the effort applied to overcome friction and part to overcome resistance or lift a load.
• Velocity Ratio (VR) We define Velocity Ratio (VR) as the ratio of the distance moved by the effort and the load in the time interval distance moved by effort (e) VR = distance moved by load (l) The Velocity Ratio depends on the geometry of the machine.
It is independent of friction.
For an ideal machine, that is, a machine that has no friction, also called a perfect machine, worked done by machine = work done on machine.
Therefore, Load distance moved by load = effort × distance moved by effort.
or load distance moved by effort (e) = effort distance moved by load (l) = Velocity Ratio Hence for an ideal or perfect machine mechanical advantage = velocity ratio.
• Efficiently (E) f We define the Efficiency (E) of a machine as: f E = Useful work done by the machine × 100% f Work put into the machine.
189PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Usually, the efficiency of a machine is expressed as a percentage.
That is, EF = useful work done by the machine x 100% Work put into the machine Note that work (W) =force x distance You know that a perfect or ideal machine has a 100% efficiency.
This means that all the work done by the effort is wholly used to overcome the load.
You also know that in practical machines; the efficiency is usually less than 100% because of friction in the moving parts of the machine.
Part of the effort applied is used to overcome frictional forces which are always present.
Hence, the useful work done by the machine is less than the workdone by the effort on the machine.
3.2.2 Relationship between Mechanical Advantage (Force Ratio), Velocity Ratio and Efficiency For any machine, we know that: Efficiency (E) = work done on load × 100% f Work done by effort Load (L) x distance moved by load (L) x 100% = Effort (E) distance moved by effort (e) L × l × 100% = L ÷ e .
× 100% = E e E l (cid:222) L × l × 100% ....(1) E e where l and e are the distance moved by the load L and the effort E respectively in the same time interval.
For mechanical advantage (MA) and Velocity Ratio (VR), we have the following rotationships: Mechanical Advantage, M. A.
= L .......(2) E Velocity Ratio, V. R. = e .......... (3) l You will substitute equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) to obtain 190PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS E L x l x 100% Efficiency ( f) = E e = L ‚ e x 100% E l MA x 100% = VR This implies that Efficiency (E) = MA x 100% f VR Mechanical Advantage, Velocity Ratio and Efficiency are ratios of similar quantities and so have no units.
3.3 Numerical Problems and Force Ratio, Velocity Ratio and Efficiency of Simple Machines Worked examples 1 A simple machine has a VR of 5 and an efficiency of 90%.
It is used to raise a load of 2.kg through a height of 10 m in 5s.
Calculate: (a) The force ratio (FR) of the machine (b) The work done (W) on the load, and (c) The power (P) developed.
(Take g = 10 s-2 ) Solution (a) Efficiency (E) = FR × 100% f VR \ FR (MA) = E × VR f 100 = 90 × 5 = 450 = 4.5 100 100 The Force Ratio of the machine is 4.5 (b) Load = 2.5 kg × 10 ms-2 = 25N Work done on load = load × distance moved by load = 250N × 10 m = 250 J.
191PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The work done on the load is 250 J (c) Power developed = Work done Time taken = 250 = 50W 5s The power developed is 50 W 2.
A machine whose efficiency is 80% is used to lift a load of 1000N.
Calculate the effort put into the machine if it has a velocity ratio of 6.
Solution Effiency (E) = MA (FR) 100% = 80% f VR MA = 80 .
6 100 (cid:222) MA or FR = 6 × 80 100 = 480 = 4.8 100 But FR= load = 1000 Effort Effort 1000 \ 4.8 = Effort Effort = 1000 =208.33 N 4.8 the effort put into the machine is 208.33 3 The efficiency of a machine is 70%.
Find in joules the work done by a student using this machine to raise a load of 75 kg through a vertical distance of 3 m (g = 10 ms-2) 192PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution Efficient % = Work done by the machine x 100% Work done on the machine (cid:222) 70 = 75 10 x 3 x 100 100 work done by student 100 \ work done by student = 75 x 10 x 3 x100 70 = 3214.29 Joules The work done by the student by using the machine to raise the load is 3214.29J.

3.4.
Force Ratio, Velocity Ratio and Efficiency of Simple Machines 3.4.1 Lever The lever is one of the simplest machines we know.
You can overcome a large resistance by the application of a small force with it.
The lever consists of a stiff bar or rigid rod supported at the fulcrum or pivot about which it can rotate.
If you apply an effort (E) at one point 193PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS of the lever, it will lift a load (L) or overcome a resistance at some other point.
The diagram is shown below in Fig.
4.1 a b E Fulcrum L or Pivot Fig.
4.1: The lever The lever operates on the principle of moments.
According to this principle, we can state from Fig.
4.1 that: E x a = Lx b ..... (4) where: a is the distance of the effort from the fulcrum; b is the distance of the load from the same fulcrum.
From equation (4), L = a E b That is Force Ratio = Velocity Ratio where a/b is ratio of the two arms of the lever FR = That is: efficiency (Ef) = 1 VR • Types of Levers We have three classes of levers: first order, second order and third order.
This classification is dependent on the relative position of the effort, load and fulcrum.
• First Order Levers Here, the fulcrum (F) or pivot is between the load and the effort.
194PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS F E F Fig.
4.2: lst order lever Examples The crawbar, a pair of scissors or pincers, claw hammer and pliers.
The velocity ratio is usually greater than 1 but could be less than or equal to 1.
• Second order levers In the second order lever, the load (L) is between the effort (E) and the fulcrum or pivot.
E F L Fig.
4.3: 2nd order lever Examples Wheelbarrow and nutcrackers The mechanical advantage and velocity ratio are always greater than 1.
• Third order levers: Here, effort (E) is between load (L) and the fulcrum (F).
195PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS E Fulcrum F Load (L) Fig.
4.4: 3rd order lever Examples: forceps, tongs, forearm.
The force ratio and velocity ratio are less than 1.
3.4.2 The Inclined Plane You have seen lorry drivers use this type of machine to raise heavy loads such as drums of oil, up a sloping plank to the high floors of L lorries.
The sloping plank is an example of an inclined plane.
As shown in Fig.
4.5, it is a rigid plane which is kept inclined to the horizontal at a certain angle, q (a) 196PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS B E (a) h L q 90o O A (b) Fig.
4.5: The inclined plane (a) loading in lorry through an inclined plane (b) schematic of the inclined plane with load As the applied force or effort E moves along OB, at an angle o to the horizontal, the load L is lifted up through a vertical height AB.
Thus, the velocity ratio is given by: distance moved by effort VR = distance moved by load = OB = 1 AB sin q VR = 1 Sin q If friction forces are absent, you will have FR= VR = 1 .
.
sinq But friction along the plane affects the efficiency and the FR will be less than VR.
3.4.3 The Pulleys The pulley system is one of the most widely used types of machine.
You often see pulleys being used at construction sites to raise or lower heavy loads.
As you can see, a simple pulley is a fixed wheel hung on a suitable support with a rope passing round its groove as shown in Fig 4.6.
197PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Rope Fixed wheel So F F Rope L E So L Fig.
4.6 :A simple pulley E E Fig.
4.7: Pulley system (a) 4 pulleys (b) 5 pulleys A load L is attached at one end of the rope and an effort E is applied at the other end.
If you neglect the weight of the rope and the frictional forces, the effort (E) applied to the rope will be equal to the load lifted because the tension on the rope will be same throughout.
Hence, L = E and FR = 1 Also, 198PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The distance moved by the effort So = the distance moved by load So.
Hence, VR =1 You will realize that in practice, the effort has to lift the load (L) and also overcome the friction which hinders the pulleys from turning freely.
Thus, there may be a mechanical disadvantage.
However, you will still have the advantage in the use of such a pulley in that one can stand on the ground and use one’s body weight in addition to his muscle to pull downwards on the rope and raise the load upwards.
You know that this is easier than lifting the load directly upwards.
You can also make use of such a single pulley to change the direction in which a force is to be exerted.
You can always determine the VR of a pulley system from the number of pulleys.
The VR of a pulley system is to equal to the number of pulleys.
For instance, in the block and tackle system of pulleys shown in figure 4.7, the VR of (a) having 4 pulleys is 4 while that of (b) having 5 pulleys is 5.
You will also note that • The MA (FR) increases as the number of pulleys increases • If efficiency is 100%, MA is equal to the VR, however, owing to friction and weight of pulleys, the efficiency is always less than 100%.
• Efficiency gets less as the number of pulley increases.
• With a particular pulley system, the greater the load to be lifted, the greater the efficiency.
This is because the weight of the pulleys attached to one load is less in proportion to the load.
199PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4.4 Wheel and Axle a b E L = Weight Fig.
4.8: Wheel and axle Do you know that the wheel and axle is equivalent to a lever?
The effort arm is the radius of the wheel a, and the load arm, the radius of the axle b in this case, E x 2p a = L x 2p b From which L a Mechanical advantage = = E b Here, you note that as the effort arm completes one revolution, the load is raised by the circumference of the axle.
Therefore, 2 p a a Velocity ratio = = 2 p b b Here again, in the ideal case, the efficiency is 100%.
However, owing to friction, its value is less than 100% in a practical case.

4.9: The Screw mechanisms You are familiar with the screw jack used to lift a car so as to change /one of its wheels.
They are examples of screw mechanism (Fig.
4.9).
We call the vertical distance P between successive threads, the pitch.
When you move the load through a distance P, the effort moves through a distance equal to the circumference of the handle of th screw driver in Fig.
4.9(a) or through the circumstances of the circle traced out by the lever arm.
Fig.
4.9(b) Therefore, Velocity ratio = 2 p r P With a high value of r compared with p, it is possible to obtain a high velocity ratio and therefore a big mechanical advantage.
In the jack, friction reduces the mechanical advantage considerable such that the efficiency is usually below 50%.
201PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4.6 The Wedge The wedge is a combination of two inclined planes.
You may have noticed some people use it to split wood or rock into piece or to widen an opening.
Examples of wedge – type of machines are axes, chisels, knives, and other cutting tools usually used by builders to separate bodies which are held together by large forces.
This is shown in Fig.
4.10.
E c = t o c o B Axe C c = L R 1 R q Handle A (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig.
4.10: The wedge We noticed that when the users drive in the wedge by the effort force, a much larger force is exerted to each side by the wedge surface.
Thus, as the wedge is driven in a distance x , the surfaces being separated are 1 moved apart through a distance c as shown in Fig.
4.10.
If we take the length of the wedge to be L and its thickness to be t, then the mechanical advantage (neglecting frictional forces) is given by load c = L M.A = = 1 Effort c t 2 M. A.
= Slant height of wedge Thickness of wedge You will note that a thin wedge has a higher mechanical advantage than a short thick one; or the smaller than angle O between the slant heights, the greater the M.A.
202PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.5 Simple Machines as Components of Complex Machine – The Bicycle 3.5.1 The gear wheels belt A shafts B (b) (a) B Fig.
4.11: Principle of gears Principle of gears Gear wheels are commonly used in cars, bicycles and cranes.
In these machines you will apply the principle of the wheel and the axle to the two wheels (often toothed wheels) of different radii connected by a belt and rotating on separate shafts.
Here both the load and the effort are applied to the shafts and velocity ratio is given by.
number of teeth on driven wheel (A) VR = Number of teeth on driving wheel (B 3.5.2 The Bicycle C 2b 2a Hub wheel Pedal Back wheel Front wheel Sprocket wheel Fig.
4.12: The bicycle You are aware that the bicycle uses two cog wheels, the sprocket wheel which is rapidly attached to the back wheel of the cycle.
The cogs on the 203PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS two wheels are evenly separated.
When the pedals and sprocket wheel complete a revolution, the hub wheel rotates through 2 p a revolutions.
2p b and the back wheel does the same.
You will notice that the back wheel has moved through a distance of 2p C x a b when the pedals complete a revolution.
We regard the friction between the tires and the ground as constituting the load while the effort is applied on the pedals.
If we take L to be length of the pedal crank, and the distance moved by effort in one revolution is 2p l, then, velocity ratio equals 2 p i = b i 2 p ac ac b The velocity ratio and the mechanical advantage (or force ratio) is considerably less than 1.
But a rapid movement of the load compared with the effort is achieved.
3.6 Effect of Friction on Simple Machines and Methods of Reduction In this unit, you have noted how frictional forces add to the load which has to be overcome by effort.
The presence of friction between the moving parts of machines as mentioned in Module 2 unit 3.3 makes it impossible for any machine to have an efficiency of 100%.
This is because part of the effort applied is used to overcome frictional forces and the remainder is utilized to do useful work.
The work done in overcoming friction is ‘useless’ or wasted energy’ and it appears as heat in the moving parts of machines.
In order to improve the efficiency of machines you will try to reduce the friction present between the moving parts of the machine by : 1 Lubricating which prevents metal surfaces from rubbing against each other and; 2 Using ball bearings or roller bearings between the two surfaces in contact.

5.0 SUMMARY • A machine is any device which allows a large weight or resistance to be overcome by a small effort.
• Mechanical Advantage or Force Ratio is defined by M.A = Load Effort • Velocity Ratio V.R distance moved by effort in the same time = distance moved by load Efficiency = Work output x 100% Work input = M.A x 100% VR • M.A depends on friction but V.R is independent of friction.
• In this lever machine, V.R is the ratio of the lengths of two arms of the lever.
The M.A increases with an increase in this ratio.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Forms of Energy and World Energy Sources 3.1.1 Concept of Energy Energy is the mainspring of all life and of all the activities of mankind.
It may be defined as an ability or capacity to perform work.
You use energy in your home in the following ways: • Chemical energy stored in the food you eat helps you in walking, playing, doing household work and other duties.
• Chemical energy in wood or load or kerosene is converted by combustion to heat energy for cooking your food, and heating purposes.
210PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Light energy that falls on your eyes enables you to see things; • Sound energy that enters your ears makes you hear; • Electrical energy operates most appliances such as fan, TV sets, radios, electric pressing irons, refrigerators and other appliances in your home.
3.1.2 Energy Sources You know that the sun is the main source of energy in the universe.
However, we can identify other sources which we have classified under: • Natural sources which include food, sun, wood, coals, natural gas, oils and fats, tides/waves, wind, waters.
• Manufactured sources include energy from batteries, generators, electricity from the mains.
• Petroleum products include that from kerosene, gasoline and refinery gases (methane, ethane, propane and butane).
3.1.3 Forms of Energy You are aware that energy can exist in different forms.
Among these are: • Chemical energy (stored in food and other fuels) • Kinetic energy (associated with motion).
• Gravitational potential energy (associated with height above the ground).
• Elastic potential energy (stored in springs, rubbers, stretched bows, catapults).
• Nuclear energy (stored in nucleus of atoms).
• Heat energy (flows from one point to another as a result of temperature difference between the point.
• Sound energy (produced by vibrating objects – violins, guitars, piano, drums).
• Light energy (produced by light bulbs) • Mechanical energy (associated with machines at work) • Electrical energy (taken in by TV set and other electrical appliances).
• Magnetic energy (associated with magnetism) • Solar energy (associated with the sun).
3.2 Concept and Measurement of Work 3.2.1 Concept of Work 211PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS In every day life, different people apply the term work to any form of activity that requires the exertion of physical or mental effort.
However, in Physics (or in mechanics), we use the term in a very specific sense.
We say that work is done whenever a force is applied to cause a body to move.
When you push a car a certain distance, you are said to do work.
When no movement takes place after you have applied a force to a body such as a car, no work is done.
Work is said to be done whenever a force moves its point of application a distance in the direction of the force.
3.2.2 Measurement of Work You will measure work by obtaining the product of force moving a body and the distance moved by the body in the direction of the force.
That is, if a force F moves a body a distance S in the direction of dthe force, the work done is given by: Work = Force x displacement i.e.
W = F x S -------(1) The S.I.
unit of work is Joule (J) The Joule is equivalent to Newton – metre (Nm).
In general, when a constant force F at an angle q = with the direction of motion causes a body to move a distance, S, we define the work done by W = F Cos θ x S -------------- (2) where F cos θ is the component of F in the direction of motion.
F θ F Cos θ S Fig .1.1: W = F Cos θ x S Work is a scalar quantity You can also obtain equation (2) by resolving S in the direction of force 212PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS i.e.
S Cos θ (cid:222) W = F Cos 0 x S or F x S Cos θ (3) When the force and the motion are in the same direction, θ = 0; W = F x S Cos 0 = F x S (4) But, if the force is at right angles to the displacement, it has no component in the direction of the displacement.
Hence, F Cos 90 = 0; work done = 0.
3.2.3 Work Done in a Force Field (a) Lifting a body (b) Falling bodies (a) Lifting a body You know that to lift a body through a height h, a pulling force must be applied to overcome the weight of the body.
When an object is lifted upwards vertically, work is done against the force of gravity or against the weight of the body.
You will obtain the magnitude of the work done from Work = force x distance = mg x h = mgh (5) where m = mass of the body, g = acceleration due to gravity h = height (b) Falling bodies 213PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS When a body falls freely under gravity, we say that the earth’s gravitational force does work on the body.
For instance, if a body of mass m, falls through a vertical distance h, the work done by gravity on the body is obtained from.
W = mgh.
Also, if a body of mass m rolls down a hill of height h and length l, the work done is mgh.
In this case, you will still use the vertical height (h) in the calculation and not the length of the slope ℓ Worked examples 1.
A body of weight 200 N falls freely through a height of 10 m, what is the work done?
Solution Work done = mgh Weight (force) = 200N, height = 10 m Work done = 200N x 10 m = 2000 J (2) A boy lifts a load of weight 200N through a vertical height of 1 m before putting it on his load.
When he finds that the load is too heavy to carry him quickly drops the load in its original place.
What is the work done by the boy ?
\ Solution Work done = zero.
Reason: No displacement.
(3) A load is pulled 7 m along a horizontal floor by a constant force of 30N which acts at 400 to the horizontal.
Calculate the work done by the force.
Solution 214PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Work done = F Cos θ x S F = 300N; θ = 40o ; S = 7 m .
.
Work done = 30 Cos 40o x 7 = 30 x 0 .766 x 7 = 160.87J 3.3 Concept and Measurement of Energy 3.3.1 Concept of Mechanical Energy We have already said that anything capable of doing work has energy.
This means that a person pushing a car along the road is doing work on the car.
So far as the car moves some distance.
A mango fruit falling from the top of the tree does work and therefore possess energy.
Can you mention other situations in which the application of force cause a body to move.
All of them possess energy.
There are many forms of energy but here, you will concentrate on the study of mechanical energy.
Mechanical energy is classified into two types namely Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy.
3.3.2 Potential Energy (P.E) Potential energy is simply ‘stored energy’ or energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position or state.
The stored energy is used to do work when the body is free to move Examples of potential energy are: • a magnet at rest in a magnetic field (magnetic potential energy).
• An electric charge at rest in an electric field (electric potential energy).
• a coiled spring when stretched or compressed (elastic potential energy.
• petrol, wood, and other fuel sources burn when they burn, chemical potential energy is released, • a body at rest in a gravitational field e.g.
a mango fruit on a mango tree, gravitational potential energy.
215PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.3.3 Kinetic Energy (K.E) Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion.
Examples of kinetic energy are; - a student running a race.
- an object falling freely under gravity.
- electrical charges in motion.
- any object in motion.
3.3.4 Measurement of Energy (i) Potential energy (P.E) (ii) Kinetic energy (K.E) (i) Measurement of Potential Energy (P.E) Gravitational potential energy as you know depends on the weight and height of an object above the surface of the earth.
To lift an object at a constant speed under gravity, you must exert a force, which is equal to its weight.
The work you do when you lift a body of mass m at a uniform speed through a height h is mgh.
The work done in lifting the body to a height h, is stored and can be recovered in the form of kinetic energy by allowing the body to fall through a distance h. The potential energy of a body is not an absolute quantity.
You will measure its magnitude relative to some reference position.
To measure the gravitational potential energy P.E of a body, you will measure the mass of the body and its height above a reference level h. This is given by P.E = mgh.
The potential energy of an object in other force fields which act on the object is calculated in much the same way.
First, you will select a reference point and then obtain the potential energy at some other point as the work done in moving from the reference point to the position of the body in the force field.
ii Measurement of Kinetic Energy (K.E) 216PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The kinetic energy of a body in motion depends on both its mass m and speed v. To obtain the kinetic energy of a body in motion you will use the formula K.E = 1/2 mv2 ........................…(6) For you to obtain a value for the kinetic energy of a body you will know its mass and speed.
For instance, suppose an object of mass m moves with a horizontal velocity u and is gradually brought to rest in a distance S by a constant horizontal force F acting on it.
The kinetic energy of the body has been used in doing work against the opposing force F. Therefore, kinetic energy originally possessed by the body = work done against F = F x S But F = ma where a = retardation of the object.
Hence F F x S = Mas You will recall from the relation V2 = U2 + 2as That since v = 0, a is negative (i.e.
retardation) Therefore, V2 = U2 + 2as becomes 0 + u2 – 2as (cid:222) U2 + as 2 Also, KE + F x S = mas You can now substitute ½ u2 for as in the above.
When you do that, K.E becomes K.E = F x S + mas = ½ mu2 ie K.E = ½ mu2 ..................................…(7) kinetic energy = ½ x mass x (velocity)2 217PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Worked Examples 1.
A bullet of mass 0.5 kg was fired with a speed of 300 m/s.
Calculate its kinetic energy.
Solution K.E = ½ mv2 (m = 0.5 kg, v = 300ms-1) = ½ x 0.5 x (300)2 = 22500J ===== 2.
A body of mass 50 kg is raised to a height of 15 m. What is the potential energy of the body (g = 9.8 m/s-2).
Solution P.E = mgh = 50 x 9.8 x 15 (m = 50 kg, g = 9.8 ms-1 h = 15m) = 7350J ==== 3.4 Concept and Measurement of Power Let us consider two boys Chika and Ali who are carrying an equal load mb each from the ground floor to the first floor of a building.
The amount of work done by Chika and Ali in lifting is exactly the same.
However, if Chika accomplishes the task before Ali, we say that Chika works at a faster rate than Ali.
That is, Chika has more power than Ali.
Also, you do the same amount of work in lifting your weight when you climb up a staircase 10 metres high either in 15 seconds or in 25 seconds.
But, you do not work at the same rate.
You work faster when you climb it in 15 second ss than in 25 second.
In Physics, the work done in unit time is called power.
- Power is defined as the rate of doing work or using energy.
Power = Work done or energy expended Time taken 218PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Usually, work is measured in joules and time in seconds, so, power is expressed in joules per second.
One joule per second = 1 watt.
Therefore, work is measured in watts (W).
A power of one watt is too small for practical use.
So, we usually measure power in a larger unit called a kilowatt (KW).
Worked Example 1.
A boy of mass 25 kg walks up a flight of stairs 8 metres high in 32 seconds, calculate the power of the boy (g = 9.8 ms-2) Solution Power = Work done Time taken Work done = mgh = 25 kg x 9.8 ms -2 x 8 m Time taken = t = 32 s. \ Power = 25 x 9.8 x 8 = 1960 32 32 = 61.25 W ====== 3.5 Transformation and Conservation of Mechanical Energy 3.5.1 The Law of Conservation of Energy The law of conservation of energy states that in an isolated or closed system, the total amount of energy is always constant, although energy may be changed from one form to another.
When we talk about an isolated or closed system, we mean a group of objects that neither receives energy from nor gives energy to objects outside the system.
For mechanical energy being considered here, the law simply shows that the sum of the P.E.
and K.E is always constant for a given body, but the energy may change from P.E to K.E or from K.E to P.E.
3.5.2 The Principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy in a Conservative Field 219PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS You will note that the above principle is true in a conservative field.
An important aspect of a conservative force is that the work done by such a force is recoverable.
For example, if you do a work against a gravitational force in raising a body to a height h above the ground, that work is recovered when the body falls a distance h back to its original position.
The earth’s gravitational field is an example of field containing conservative forces.
In such a conservative field, total mechanical energy is conserved.
Friction is an example of a non-conservative force.
We noticed that when friction acts between the moving parts of a machine, some mechanical energy is lost but it reappears in the form of heat and the total energy which is now mechanical plus thermal energy remains constant.
The general principle of the conservation of energy states that the total energy in a given system is always constant or energy can neither be created nor destroyed although it can be transformed from one form to another.
3.5.3 The Conservation of Mechanical Energy of a Falling Body A B h l C Fig.1.
2: Conservation of mechanical energy Here, let us consider a body of mass m at rest at a point A, of height h above the ground level.
As the body falls, its PE changes into KE.
What it loses in PE is equal to what it gains in KE At A the total energy is all PE and is given by mgh.
There is no KE because the body is at rest.
220PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Total energy at A = mgh If the ball falls to another point B at height l above the ground, P.E at B = mgl and K.E at B = ½ mv 2 B V 2 = u2 + 2 gS B = 0 + 2 g (h-l) \ K.E = ½ mv 2 ½ m x 2 g (h-l) = mg (h-l) B = Total energy, P.E + K.E =mgl + mg (h-l) = mgh At C, the lowest level, h = 0 P.E = mg x 0 = 0 K.E = ½ mv 2 C Usually v 2 u2 + 2 bs, we have C = V2c = 0 + 2 gh K.E = ½ m x 2 gh = mgh Total energy = P.E + K.E = mgh As you have seen, the total energy of the body at each point A, B, or C is a constant (mgh) although the energy is all potential at A, partly potential and partly kinetic at B and all kinetic at C. The total mechanical energy is therefore constant or conserved in a conservative field.
221PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.5.4 The Conservation of Mechanical Energy Involved in a Swinging Pendulum A B h K.E = O D P.E.
= mgh K.E = O C (P.E.
= mgh P.E.
= O P.E is max.)
K.E = ½ mv2 (K.E.
is max.
at C ) Fig.
1.3: Energy transformation in the motion of a simple pendulum Now we will consider energy transformation in the motion of a swinging pendulum.
A simple pendulum consists of a bob attached to a string the other end of which is suspended from a firm, a support.
When the pendulum swings from end to end, the energy of the system changes from potential to kinetic and vice versa.
At each stage of the swing, the total energy remains constant.
The pendulum swings from the highest point A through the centre of the swing C to the other highest point B, At C, the bob is at the lowest position.
Therefore, the P.E of the system is zero.
Also at C, the speed of the pendulum is maximum and so the K.E is maximum at this point.
That is, At C, P.E = 0 K.E = ½ mv2 (maximum).
As the bob moves from C to B, the K.E at C is gradually transformed to P.E with the P.E becoming maximum at B which is at a height h above C. 222PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS At the B, the total energy is potential energy and is equal to mgh.
This is also the P.E at A which is at the same height above C as B.
That is, At B and A, P.E = mgh (max) K.E = 0 You can find the maximum velocity of the swinging bob that occurs as the bob passes through C. If you take this Velocity to the v max, since total energy is always conserved, you will have: ½ mv2 = mgh max (K.E at C) = (P.E at A or B) Therefore, V2 = 2 gh max V x = (cid:214) 2 gh ..............................................… (8) ma You have seen that at A and B, the energy is all P.E.
At C, energy is all K.E.
At any intermediate point such as D, the energy is partly potential and partly kinetic.
At each point however, the total energy (P.E + K.E) is constant and is equal to mgh.
Here also, you have seen that the total energy of the body remains constant.
Although there is transformation of energy from P.E to K.E, but, there is no loss or gain in its total energy.
This confirms the law of conservation of energy.
However, you will observe from experience that a pendulum bob left swinging on its own will eventually come to rest after some time.
This is because its energy is gradually used up in moving the air around it.
That is, in doing work against air resistance.
Worked example A stone of mass 500 g is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 30 ms-1 Find (a) the potential energy possessed by the stone at its greatest height; (b) the kinetic energy of the stone just before it hits the ground.
(g = 9.8 ms-2) 223PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution (a) Using v2 = u2 + 2 gS where v = 0 ms-1 (stone momentarily at rest).
g = - g (because it acts in opposite direction to that of u) When you substitute for v and g in the equation above, you obtain 0 = u2= + 2( - g) S 0 = u2 – 2g S 2g S = u2 S = u 2 2 g U = 30 ms-1, g = 9.8 ms-2 and S = (30 ms -1 ) 2 2 x 9.8 ms2 = 45.92 m ===== This is the greatest height reached by the stone.
Therefore, the potential energy of the stone at a height, h, of 45.92 m is given by Potential energy = mgh = 0.5 kg x 9.8 ms-2 x 45.92 m = 225 J ==== The potential energy possessed by the stone at its greatest height is 225J The kinetic energy of the stone just before it hits the ground equals the potential energy possessed by the stone at its greatest height i.e.

As a result of these forces, it is not easy to dislodge the molecule of a solid because any external force applied on the solid is stiffly resisted by the intermolecular forces.
In this unit, we shall study the behaviour of those solids which change their shape or size when a sufficiently strong external force is applied to them and return to their original shape or size when the applied force is removed.
Specifically we shall study Hooke’s law which governs the relationship between the stretching force and the extension produced by it in an elastic material.
We shall also discuss Young’s modulus of elasticity and study the work done in stretching or compressing spring and elastic strings.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit you will be able to: • explain the elastic properties of substances • state Hooke’s law and explain the meaning of the terms such as stress, strain, elastic limit, young’s modulus • describe and carry out an experiment to verify Hooke’s law 228PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • draw a graph of load versus extension for an elastic material  before the elastic limit is reached, and  beyond the elastic limit • solve simple problems on Hooke’s law and on work done in stretching or compressing a spring and elastic string.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept of Elasticity Solids tend to change their shape or size when sufficiently strong external forces are applied to them and to return to their original shape or size after the forces causing the change are removed.
Solids which retain their shape or size after the force causing the change has been removed are said to be ‘elastic’, and this property of solids is called elasticity.
Definitions (1) Elasticity is the ability of a substance to regain its original shape and size after being distorted by an external force.
(ii) An elastic material is one that regains its original shape and size after the distorting external force has been removed.
3.1.1 Hooke’s Law 3.1.2 Statement of Hooke’s Law Hooke’s law states that, provided the elastic limit of an elastic material is not exceeded, the extension, e, of the material is directly proportional to the applied force, F. Mathematically, F a e i.e F = K e ………………………… (1) where k is the constant of proportionality called elastic constant or force constant or stiffness of the material.
From (1), K = F ………………………………….. (2) e If F is in newtons and e in metres, then K is in newtons per metre (Nm-1) 229PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Definition: Elastic constant or stiffness of an elastic material is the force required to produce unit extension of the material.
The working of the spring balance is based on Hooke’s law.
In this case F = mg, the weight of the body which is proportional to e, the extension of the spring.
3.2 Verification or Demonstration of Hooke’s Law Extension L O Load Fig.
2.1b: Graph of extension against load.
Figure 2.1a Hook’s law Fig.2.1: Verification or demonstration of Hook’s law You can verify or demonstrate Hooke’s law using experimental set up as shown in Fig.2.1 as follows: (i) Obtain a spiral spring and attach one end of it to a firm support.
To the other end attach a scale pan which has been previously weighed.
(ii) Attach a pointer, P, to the spring with plasticize and arrange vertical scale over which the pointer movement can be read.
Set up the whole apparatus as shown in the Fig.
2.1.a (iii) Note the initial pointer reading on the scale and call it ℓ.
230PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (iv) Add weights to the scale pan in equal steps of about 0.05 kg and note and record the pointer reading for each increasing load.
Note that the total load stretching the spring in each instance is the weight in the scale pan plus the weight of the scale pan.
(v) Remove the load from the scale pan in equal steps also and note the record the corresponding pointer readings.
(vi) Record your readings as shown in the table below: Scale reading Load Load Load Average Extension increasing decreasing reading (vii) Plot a graph of extension against load.
If the total maximum load has not extended the spring permanently, the graph obtained will be a straight line graph passing through the origin (Fig.2.1b).
Since the graph is a straight line, it means that the extension of the spring is directly proportional to the load.
Hence, Hook’s law is verified.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1 Explain what is meant by (a) elasticity, and (b) elastic material?
2 State Hooke’s law and show how the law leads to the idea of stiffness of the elastic material.
State the unit (S.I.)
in which stiffness is measured, showing clearly how this unit may be derived.
3 Describe an experiment to verify Hooke’s law using a graphical method.
231PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 4 Suppose you performed Hooke’s law experiment and obtained a set of readings of loads and their corresponding extensions.
Sketch the graph of; (a) Extension against load, (b) Load against extension.
State two important similarities and one difference between the two graphs.
3.3 Graph of Extension against Load for a Permanently Strained Elastic Material Load Extension (a) B E • Y• Y P • • • E P • O O Load Extension P = Proportionality Limit E = Elastic Limit Y = Yield point OE = Elastic Region EB = Plastic Region Fig.
2.2: Graphs of (a) extension against load (b) load against extension up to breaking point If, in the Hooke’s law experiment, you continue to increase the load until the spring wire snaps or breaks, the graph of extension against load will be as shown in figure 2.2 above.
The graph is a straight line up to OP, followed by the curved part PEYB which rises slowly initially and then sharply.
Along OP, the straight portion of the graph, Hooke’s law is obeyed and the extension is proportional to the load.
232PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS P is called the ‘proportionality limit’.
However, up to the point E (slightly above P) which is called the ‘elastic limit’.
The spring will return to its original length if the applied force is removed.
Definition The elastic limit of an elastic material is the limit of force beyond which the stretched material does not return to its original length when the stretching force is removed.
Beyond the elastic limit, E, the material loses its elasticity.
The region OE from the origin to the elastic limit E is called the ‘elastic region’.
The difference between the ‘proportionality limit’ P and the ‘elastic limit’ E is that, strictly speaking, Hooke’s law holds up to P, but elasticity holds up to E. Beyond E, the wire stretches rapidly with increasing load and then enters the ‘elastic region’ which begins at E. In this ‘plastic region’ the wire does not return to its original length upon removal of the stretching force.
At Y, the ‘yield point’ the material is said to have ‘yielded or lost all elasticity permanently and has become ‘plastic’.
Definition Yield point is the point beyond the elastic limit in which the elastic material has yielded all its elasticity permanently and has become plastic.
The difference between the “elastic region” (OE) and the “plastic region” (EB) is that in a latter, a sudden and rapid increase in the extension for any slight increase in load.
B is the ‘breaking point’ where the material may finally ‘break’ or ‘snap’.
It corresponds to the maximum possible extension that can be produced in the material.
Worked examples 1.
A force of 10N is required to extend the length of a spiral spring by 4 cm.
Find the extension of the spring when a mass of 360 g is suspended from its end (g = 10ms-2).
233PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution By Hook’s law, F = ke \ k = F e = 10N 0.04 m when a body is suspended, the weight w should produce an extension, e \ W = mg = k x e \ e = mg k = 360kg x 10N 1000 kg = 1000 N 4 m = 1.44 x 10-2 m = 1.44 cm.
2 An elastic material is stretched 45 mm by a force of 3 N. Calculate the additional force which will stretch the material 50mm, if the elastic limit is not exceeded.
Solution By Hook’s law, F = k.e \ k = F = 3 N e 45 x 10-3m Let the force stretching the material 50 mm be F \ F = k.e = k x 50 x 10-3m = 3N x 50 x 10-3 m 45 x 10-3m 1 = 3.33N \ Additional force = (3.33 – 3.00) N = 0.33 N 234PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4 Young’s Modulus of Elasticity Suppose a wire of length ℓ (m) and cross-sectional area A (m2) is extended through e (m) by a force F (N).
(a) The ratio of the force to the area, F/A is called the stress or ‘tensile’ of the elastic material.
Stress = F …………………………(1) A (b) The ratio of the extension, e to the original length, ℓ of the wire i.e e is called the tensile strain of the wire.
ℓ \ Strain = e …………………………………… (2) ℓ From (1) F = stress x A ……………………………….
(3) From (2) e = Strain x ℓ…………………………………(4) By Hooke’s law, F = ke \ Stress x A = k x Strain x ℓ \ Stress = kℓ x strain A \ Stress = k1 strain where k1 = constant = kℓ A \ Stress = k1 …………………………………… (5) Strain OR Stress a Strain Hence Hooke’s law can also be stated as follows: The tensile stress of the material is directly proportional to its tensile strain provided the elastic limit is not exceeded.
235PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The constant of proportionality, k1 (see equation (5) above) is called Young’s modulus of elasticity and is represented by the symbol, .
૪ \ Young’s modulus ( ) = Stress ૪ Strain \ = F A ૪ e ℓ The unit of is Nm-2 (Newton per square metre) the same unit as ૪ stress, since strain has no unit.
Dimension of = Dimension of stress ૪ Dimension of strain = Dimension of stress = Dimension of force Dimension of Area = MLT-2 L2 = ML-1T-2 236PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.5 Work Done in Springs and Elastic String Natural i length i + e Compression -e p e P1 load m F = mg (N) Fig.
2.3: Work done in extending or compressing a spring Consider a spring of unstretched length, ℓ (m).
Suppose a force F (N) causes an extension (or compression) e (m).
The force in the wire has increased from an initial value of zero at P to a value of F at ‘P’.
The work (W) done in stretching the spring through the extension is given by: W = Average force x extension = Initial force + final force x extension 2 \ W = O + F x e 2 \ W = 1/2 Fe ………………………………… (1) But F = ke (Hooke’s law) \ W = 1/2 k.e2 ……………………………… (2) This work done is stored as potential energy in the material which can do work when the stretching force is removed and the material regains its original length.
237PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS This type of stored energy is applied in the working of many spring clocks and toys.
The energy is stored in the clock spring (or toy spring) which is compressed by winding.
3.6 Elastic Potential Energy Definition The elastic potential energy of a stretched or compressed material is the ability of the material to do work.
Elastic potential energy arises because work is done in stretching or compressing the material as we have seen in the previous section W = 1/2 Fe = 1/2 ke2 Where F is the maximum stretching (or compressing) force, e is the extension (or compression) and k is the force constant or stiffness of the material.
Example (or application) of elastic potential energy: When you stretch the rubber of a catapult and project a stone, the elastic potential energy stored in the rubber is converted into the kinetic energy of the flying stone according to the law of conservation of energy.
Worked examples 1.
An elastic material is stretch 1.2 cm by a mass of 96g suspended from one end of it.
What is the elastic constant of the material?
Solution Weight of object = stretching force = 960 x 10 N (W = mg) 1000 = 9.6 N Extension = 1.2 10-2 m F = ke = k x 1.2 x 10-2 N 238PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS \ k = 9.6 Nm-1 1.2 x10-2 = 800 Nm-1 2.
A spiral spring is compressed by an external force in such a way that 0.08J of energy is stored in it.
If the elastic constant of the spring is 400Nm-1, calculate the compression of the spring.
Solution Energy stored in the spring, W = Fe = 1/2 ke2 W = 1 k e2 2 \ 0.08J = 1 x 400N x e2 2 \ e2 = 0.08 x 2 m2 400 \ e = 0.02m SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.

You will learn the effects of heat and change of state and expansion, their explanation using the kinetic molecular theory.
Also, you will learn expansivity and explanation of temperature changes using molecular theory.
Finally, you will learn the applications of expansivity in your daily life.
242PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the time you finish this unit, you will be able to: • explain temperature, expansion, change of state and vaporization using the kinetic molecular theory • solve simple problems involving linear, area and volume expansivity.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept of Heat and Temperature When you touch a kettle of boiling water, you will feel a burning sensation.
You will say that the water is hot.
Also, if you hold ice block, your hand feels chilly and you conclude that the water is cold.
We describe an object which has been given heat energy as hot.
When we place a kettle of cold water on a heating stove, after a few minutes, the water feels hotter because it has been given heat energy.
Similarly, we describe as cold a body from which heat energy has been removed.
For instance, keeping a bottle of water in a refrigerator, you must have experienced that heat always flows from a hot object to a cold object.
Heat energy is the energy that is transferred from a hot object to a cooler object as a result of their difference in temperature.
Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of an object.
Temperature is a property of an object which decides which way heat will flow when it is placed in contact with another object.
Usually heat flows from a body of higher temperature to one at lower temperature.
The instrument for measuring temperature is the thermometer.
3.2 Effects of Heat Here we look at some effects of heat on an object.
You may have identified some of this yourself in your everyday life.
These effects are summarized as follows: Addition of heat to the body will cause: (a) Change in temperature of the body except during a change of state.
(b) Change of state of the body solid to liquid, liquid to gaseous state.
(c) Expansion of the body.
243PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (d) Change in the physical property of a body such as the electrical resistance, magnetic properties conductivity, elasticity, density and colour of the body.
(e) Themionic emission- the emission of electrons from the surface of the metal.
(f) Change in chemical properties of the body.
(g) Changes in pressure and volume of gases.
3.3 Kinetic Molecular Theory We consider kinetic molecular theory and its assumptions.
In addition, we use it to explain major concepts in this unit.
The molecular theory of matter assumes the matter is made up of atoms that aggregate in molecules.
The molecule is a group of atoms of the same or different elements joined together in a simple proportion.
These molecules are under the influence of two types of forces: (i) Attractive forces which prevent the molecule from moving apart and (ii) repulsive forces which prevent the molecule from moving closer.
There is normally a balance between these forces in a substance.
In solid substances, the attractive forces between molecules are so strong that the molecules do not move about freely.
The molecules only vibrate about their mean positions maintaining a fixed shape and volume.
In liquids, the molecules are loosely held together by weak attractive forces.
The molecules are free to move about within the liquid and are always in a state of random motion.
Molecules of solids and liquids are held together by intermolecular forces.
In gases, the force of attraction between the molecules is very weak.
The molecules are therefore in constant motion having overcome the intermolecular force.
They move very freely at a very high speed.
They are always in the state of random motion and take up the shape and volume of their container.
The kinetic molecular theory assumes that: (i) Every substance is made up of tiny particles called molecules 244PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (ii) The molecules are in a constant state of random motion, colliding elastically with one another and changing their direction as a result.
(iii) There is always an attractive force between the molecules.
(iv) The volume of the gas molecule is negligible compared with the volumes of the gas container.
3.3.1 Kinetic Theory Explanation of Temperature We say that the molecules of a substance are in constant motion, therefore, they possess kinetic energy.
The temperature of the body is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its molecules.
When you add heat to a substance, the motion of the molecules increases resulting in an increase in the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the substance, thus, an increase in its temperature.
On the other hand, when you remove heat from a body, the motion of its molecule decreases resulting in reduction in their average kinetic energy and a decrease in temperature.
It follows therefore, that the temperature of a body is related to the average kinetic energy of its molecules.
3.3.2 Kinetic Theory Explanation of Expansion When we heat a substance, it increases in size, we say it expands.
When the substance cools, it contracts i.e reduces in size.
According to the kinetic molecular theory, when an object is heated the molecules acquire more kinetic energy which enables them to overcome their intermolecular forces resulting in increase in vibration of the molecules and their displacement about their mean positions.
The average distance between the molecules of the substance becomes larger leading to an increase in the size of the substance.
The increase depends on the strength of the intermolecular forces.
If these forces are strong, the expansion will be small and vice versa.
The intermolecular forces are stronger in solids than in liquids and weakest in gases.
Therefore, when heat is applied, gases expand more than liquids and liquids expand more than solids.
245PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.3.3 Kinetic Molecular Theory Explanation of Change of State You are aware that substances exist in any of the three states of matter; solid, liquid and gas.
With the help of heat energy, it is possible to transform a substance from one state to another.
Change of state refers to the process of transforming a substance from one state of matter to another.
When a solid is heated its temperature increases until it reaches a certain maximum temperature at which the molecules acquire maximum kinetic energy.
At this maximum temperature, further heating does not increase the kinetic energy of the molecules but the heat energy (latent heat) is used to break down the intermolecular forces binding the molecules of the solids in a regular pattern.
The molecules then melt and move about freely as they are in the liquid state.
The maximum temperature is the melting point of the solid.
Also, the change from liquid to gas takes place in a similar fashion.
The liquid temperature increases as it is heated and reaches its maximum temperature at which the molecule acquires maximum kinetic energy.
Further heating (latent heat) supplies the needed energy to overcome the forces of attraction between the liquid molecules and changes the liquid to vapour without temperature change.
The molecules are then practically independent of each other and exist as a gas.
The energy needed in this case is much greater than from solid to liquid and the latent heat is much greater.
Removal of heat energy from a substance results in a reverse process.
The heat required to break down the intermolecular forces of attraction in a solid is the latent heat of fusion.
The latent heat of vaporization is the heat needed to overcome the forces of attraction between the molecules of the liquid.
3.4 Expansivity Solids expand when heated and contract when cooled.
You can observe this in simple laboratory experiments such as: • Ball and ring experiment: 246PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS When cold, a metal ball can just pass through a metal ring.
On being heated strongly for some minutes, it expands and can no longer pass through the ring.
When it cools, it contracts and passes through the ring again.
(a) Ball passes through the ring (before heating) (b) Ball does not pass through the ring (after heating) Fig.
3.1 • Bar and guage experiment • • Bar Bar • Guage • guage Before heating After heating Fig.
3.2: Bar and guage The bar in Fig.
3.2 just fits into the guage at ordinary room temperature.
After heating, the heated bar expands in length when hot and can no longer fit into the guage.
When cooled to the room temperature, the bar contracts and fits once more into the guage.
247PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Bimetallic strip; Different substances expand by different amounts for the same temperature range.
You can observe this in the heating of bimetallic strip shown in Fig.
3.3.
Iron Wooden handle brass (a) Before heating Fig.3.3: Expansion of a solid (bimetallic strip) Before heating the bimetallic strip of brass and iron riveted together has equal length.
After heating, the strip bends as shown above because brass expands more than iron for a given temperature rise.
3.4.1 Linear Expansivity You can determine the extent which a unit metal substance changes in length when it temperature changes by one degree.
This quantity is known as linear expansivity of the metal substance.
It is represented by the symbol a (pronounced alpha).
• The linear expansivity (a ) of a substance is defined as the increase in length per unit length per degree rise in temperature.
In symbols, this is equivalent to: a = ℓ - ℓ = e …………….. 2 1 (i) ℓ (q -q ) ℓ q 1 2 1 1 Where: a = linear expansivity ℓ = length of metal at temperature q 1 1 ℓ = length of metal at temperature q 2 2 248PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS q = temperature rise given by q - q 2 1 e = expansion or increase in length ℓ - ℓ 2 1 a = Increase in length original length x temperature rise Unit per oC or per k (k-1) • The statement that the linear expansivity of brass is 0.000018 k-1 or 0.000018/oC means that a unit length of brass expands by 0.00018 units when it is heated through 1k (or 1oC) rise in temperature.
3.4.2 Determination of Linear Expansivity Fig.
3.4: Measurement of linear expansivity The apparatus shown in Fig.
3.4 is used in the determination of linear expansivity of a solid.
Carefully measure the original length ℓ of a metal rod (about 50 cm) 1 with a metre rule.
Enclose the rod in a fixed jacket between a fixed stop A and a micrometer guage B, so that no movement of the rod can take place at A while the other end at B is free to move.
Run cold water through the jacket.
Adjust the micrometer screw until it just touches the B end of the rod.
Record the guage’s first reading (e ) and the initial 1 temperature ( q ) of he rod from the thermometer placed inside the 1 jacket.
Unscrew the micrometer screw guage from the end B of the rod to leave enough space for the rod to expand.
Pass hot steam through the jacket 249PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS for several minutes to allow the rod expand as a result of this heating.
Screw the guage to make contact with the rod again and take a new reading of the guage (e ).
Repeat the process until the reading of the 2 screw guage becomes constant.
Take the final steady temperature (q ) of 2 the rod from the thermometer inserted into the steam jacket.
Calculate the linear expansivity from the equation; Linear expansivity (a ) = expansion (or change in length) Original length x temperature change a = e – e = e 2 ℓ (q - q ) ℓ q 1 2 1 1 b 3.4.3 Area Expansivity ( ) When we heat a solid, it expands in all directions that is the length, breath and height.
This results in an increase in area as well as in volume of the solid.
This increase in area when the body is heated is known as area or superficial expansion.
It is represented by the symbol b (pronounced beta).
Definition The area or superficial expansivity, b , of a solid is the increase in area per unit area per degree Kelvin increase in temperature or the fractional increase in area per Kelvin rise in temperature.
Area expansivity b = change in area .
Original area x temperature rise b = A –A = a 2 1 ………………(2) A x (q -q ) A q 1 2 1 1 Where: a = increase in area A –A 2 1 A = area at temperature q 2 2 A = area at temperature q 1 1 q = q -q 2 1 3.4.4 Volume or Cubic Expansivity ( ) ૪ An increase in volume when a body is heated is known as cubic or volume expansion.
We denote cubic expansivity with the symbol ૪ pronounced gamma.
250PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Definition The volume or cubic expansivity , is the increase in volume of a ૪ substance per unit volume per Kelvin rise in temperature or the fractional increase in volume per Kelvin rise in temperature.
Cubic expansivity ( ) = change in volume ૪ Original volume x temperature rise = V – V = v ………… (3) ૪ 2 1 V (q - q ) V q 1 2 1 1 Where v = increase in volume V – V 2 1 V = volume at temperature q 2 2 V = volume at temperature q 1 1 q = q - q 2 1 a 3.4.5 The Relationship between Linear Expansivity ( ), Area b Expansivity ( ) and Cubic Expansivity ( ) ૪ If a is the coefficient of linear expansivity of a metal, its area expansivity (b ) and volume expansivity ( ) are related (a ) by: ૪ b = 2a = 3a ……………………………….
(4) ૪ We can also write the following: ℓ = ℓ (1 + aq ) 2 1 A = A (1 + qb ) = (A + 2aq ) 2 1 1 V = V (1 + ) = (V + 3aq ) 2 1 ૪ 1 where the symbols retain their previous meaning.
251PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Worked Examples on Expansivity 1 In an experiment to determine the linear expansivity of a solid rod, the following readings were obtained: Initial temperature of rod (q 1) = 18oC Original length of rod (ℓ1) = 50.0 cm Final temperature of rod (q 2) = 98oC Final length of rod (ℓ2) = 50.8 cm Calculate the (a) linear, (b) area and (c) volume expansivity of the rod.
Rise in temperature = 98oC – 18oC = 80oC Expansion of rod = Increase in length = 50.8 cm – 50.0 cm = 0.8cm Solution (a) linear expansivity = expansion original length x temperature change = 0.8 = 0.0002 per oC 50 x 80 (b) area expansivity (b ) = 2a = 0.0002 x 2 = 0.0004 per oC (c) cubic expansivity ( ) = 3a = 3 x 0.0002 ૪ = 0.0006 per oC 2 The coefficient of linear expansivity of a metal is 1.8 x 10-5 cm per degree Celsius.
A cube of the metal has each length as 2.5 m. Find the area of each surface and the volume of the cube if it is heated through a temperature of 60oC Solution Coefficient of linear expansivity a = 1.8 x 10-5 Coefficient of area expansivity b = 2a = 2 x 1.8 x 10-5 = 3.6 x 10-5 Coefficient of volume expansivity = 3a = 3 x 1.8 x 10-5 = 5.4 x 10-5 ૪ Area of each surface A 2 = A (1 + 2 aq ) 1 = 6.25 (1 + 3.6 x 10-5 x 60)m 252PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS = 6.26m2 The volume of the cube V 2 = V (1 + ) 1 ૪ = 15.63 (1 + 5.4 x 10-5 x 60)m = 15.69 m3 3.5 Some Applications of Expansion Here are some of the applications: • Gaps are left between rails in railway lines to allow for free expansion and contraction of the rails.
Without the gaps, the rail joints will swell up on hot days, the railway line will buckle and trains would be derailed.
• The end of the steel structure of long bridges rests on rollers which allow for the expansion and contraction of the bridge without weakening the structure.
• Telegraph wires are allowed to sag when fixed in the warm, raining season, so that they do not snap when they contract in the cold harmattan.
• A bimetallic strip is used in the thermostat, a device for maintaining steady temperature.
Thermostats are used in electric laundry irons, immersion heaters for hot water tanks, refrigerators and airconditioners.
• Balance wheel of watches are also made of bimetallic strips without which increase of temperature will increase the diameter of the balance wheel thereby weaking the elasticity of the hair spring and causing the watch to lose time.
• A thick glass tumbler cracks when hot water is poured into it because the inside of the tumbler expands more rapidly than the outside and causes a strain in the glass.
A type of glass known as pyrex is used for making laboratory beakers and flasks to avoid the above effects.
Pyrex has low thermal expansivity.
• Other applications of expansion of solids is in: 253PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS - riveting - the fixing of metals tyres on the metal wheels in locomotives; - in the expansion loops in steam pipes.
3.6 Expansion of Liquids Liquids like solids expand on heating and contract on cooling.
You can observe liquid expansion with the following activity using the apparatus shown in Fig.
3.5.
Capillary tube Rubber bung Flask Coloured water Gauge Heat Fig.
3.5: Liquid expansion on heating Fill the flask with coloured water to the brim.
Fit the rubber bung with a good length of the capillary tube projecting outside the flask as shown in Fig.
3.5.
Heat the flask gently with the bunsen burner and observe the coloured liquid in the narrow tube.
Remove the liquid and observe the movement of the liquid level in the tube.
You will observe that the liquid level initially falls slightly and then rises slowly and steadily as more heat is applied.
This is because on the application of the heat, the glass first expands faster than the liquid, hence, the fall of the liquid level.
As more heat is applied, the expansion of the liquid increases more than that of the glass and the liquid rises in the narrow tube.
On removal of heat the liquid contracts and the level of liquid in the tube is seen to fall.
By using different liquids, following the same process above but using the apparatus shown in Fig.
3.6, you will also observe that liquids 254PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS expands by different amounts when heated through the same temperature ranges.
Fig.
3.6 : Different liquids expand differently You will observe that in the three flasks, the level of liquids in the tube first falls and then rises steadily.
The level of alcohol is the highest followed by benzene and least is water.
3.6.1 Real and Apparent Expansivity In the last activity, we observe that when a liquid in a container is heated, both the liquid and the container expand.
The expansion of the liquid as observed is the apparent expansion.
This is always less than the true or real expansion of the liquid.
It is therefore necessarily to distinguish between the real and the apparent cubic expansion of the liquid.
Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container real = apparent + ૪ ૪ container ......................... (5) ૪ • The real (or absolute) cubic expansivity ( ) of a liquid is the ૪r increase in volume per unit volume per degree rise in temperature.
• The apparent cubic expansivity ( ) of a liquid is the increase in ૪a volume per degree rise in temperature when the liquid is heated in an expansible vessel.
The apparent expansivity of a liquid is obtained by weighing a density bottle empty and then fills with the liquid.
The bottle with the contents is then heated in a warm water bath.
As the temperature increases, the glass and the liquid expand and the liquid overflows.
The bottle is then 255PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS taken out of the water bath, cleaned and reweighed to determine the mass of liquid expelled.
The apparent expansivity is calculated from: apparent = mass of liquid expelled ……….
(6) ૪ mass of liquid remaining x rise in temperature 3.6.2 The Anomalous Expansion of Water We know from the foregoing that most liquids expand when heated and contract when cooled.
Water is an exception to this rule as it behaves in an anomalous way when cooled.
It contracts on cooling from a higher temperature until the temperature falls to 4oC.
At 4oC, it starts to expand if cooled further below this temperature to 0oC.
That is water expands when cooled from 4oC to 0oC.
As a result of this, a given mass of water has its least volume and its highest density at 4oC.
This anomalous behaviour of water is illustrated in an experiment known as Hope’s experiment.
3.6.3 The Importance of Anomalous Expansion of Water in Nature The anomalous expansion of water is important to us because it makes ponds, lakes and rivers to freeze from the top surface rather than from the bottom.
As a result, Marine lives can survive during winter since ice forms at the surface of the water while the bottom of the lake remains at 4oC a temperature warm enough for aquatic animals such as fishes.

We noted that heat is a form of energy (thermal energy) while temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.
In this unit we shall restate the difference between heat and temperature and discuss the various methods of measuring temperature.
The relationship between pressure and temperature of a gas, the different types of scales used in temperature measurement and types of thermometers will be treated.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Construct a device for measuring the temperature of the body • Use the variation of o Pressure of a gas with temperature o Expansion of solid, liquid or gas with temperature 260PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS o Electrical resistance of a material, to measure the temperature of the body.

• describe the absolute scale of temperature and explain the meaning of the absolute zero of temperature • convert a given temperature in the Celsius scale to a temperature in the Kelvin scale and vice versa • describe the kinetic molecular model of temperature.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Heat and Temperature Heat is a form of energy which can be transformed into other forms of energy.
It is also called “thermal energy” and always flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature, if the two bodies are in contact.
It is a measure of the internal energy of a body.
The quantity of heat contained in a body depends on the mass of the body and its temperature.
The unit of heat is the joule (J).
Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.
It is related to the energy of movement (kinetic energy).
It is also a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a body.
The unit of temperature is degree Celsuis (0C) or Kelvin (K).
3.2 Principle Used in Temperature Measurement In measuring the temperature of a body we use the principle that certain physical properties of some substances vary with temperature.
Any physical property of a substance which varies in a known way and can easily be measured is employed in an instrument called “thermometer” to measure temperature.
The substance whose physical property that is used is called a “thermometric substance”.
Table 4.1 below presents a summary of the types of thermometers and their thermometric substances.

potential difference (or copper and current) between two constantan) metal junctions at different temperature.
5.
Bimetallic thermometer Two dissimilar The differential metals (e.g.
iron expansion of the two and copper) metals of the bimetallic strip.
3.3 Temperature Scales 3.3.1 Fixed Temperature Points of a Thermometer A thermometer has two reference temperatures or “fixed points”, namely: (a) The upper fixed temperature point (b) The lower fixed temperature point.
Definitions (a) The upper fixed point of a thermometer is the temperature of steam from pure water boiling at standard atmospheric pressure of 760 mm of mercury.
(b) The lower fixed point of a thermometer is the temperature of pure melting ice at the standard atmospheric pressure of 760mm of mercury.
262PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (c) The fundamental interval (or temperature interval) is the difference in temperature between the upper and lower fixed points of a thermometer.
The fundamental interval of a thermometer is usually calibrated to give readings of temperature values between the upper and lower fixed points.
The calibration of this interval depends on the scale of temperature chosen for the thermometer.
3.3.2 Types of Temperature Scales Three types of scales that are in common use are as follows (i) Fahrenheit scale (ii) Celsius scale (iii) Kelvin (absolute or thermodynamic) scale.
Fig.
4.1 shows the three scales with their upper and lower fixed points and their fundamental intervals.
Fig.
4.1 Fig.
4.1: Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin scales of temperature (a) Fahrenheit Scale (oF) (i) Lower and upper fixed points are 32oF and 212oF respectively.
(ii) Fundamental interval is divided into 180 equal parts (i.e.
212 – 32 = 180) each of which defines one degree Fahrenheit (1oF) in this scale.
263PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (b) Celsius Scale (oC) (i) Lower and upper fixed points are 00C and 1000C respectively.
(ii) Fundamental interval is divided into 100 equal parts or degree, each equal to 10C.
(c) Kelvin or Absolute Scale (K) (i) Lower and Upper fixed points are 273K and 373K respectively.
(ii) Fundamental interval is divided into 100 equal parts or units each of which is called one Kelvin (K).
You should note well that in this scale temperatures are not measured in degrees but in units called Kelvin (K).
Hence the unit symbol K is written without the degree sign.
The zero on the Kelvin scale is equal to -273oC (i.e.
OK = -273oC).
It is called the “absolute zero” Definition The absolute zero temperature is the temperature at which the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure, which is steadily cooled below 0oC, would theoretically become zero.
Conversion Formulas (i) Conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius: Scale suppose X of corresponds to a temperature of yoC.
212oF 100oC x y 320F 00C Fig.
4.2 Fahrenheit Celsius Scale Scale 264PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS By proportions: X – 32 = Y – 0 212 – 32 100 – 0 x – 32 = y 180 100 Y = 100 ( x -32) 180 Y = 5 (X – 32) 9 where X is in oF and Y is in 0C.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 (i) Give two examples of conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Conversion from Celsius to Kelvin Absolute Scale We have seen that OK = -273oC or 00C = 273 K Hence, if t oC corresponds to T on the absolute scale, then T = t + 273 You should note that although the fixed points on the Celsius and Kelvin scales are different, a temperature change of 1oC (on the Celsius scale) is equivalent to a temperature change of IK (on the Kelvin scale).
Determination of Temperate on a Celsius Scale You can determine an unknown temperature 0 in the Celsuis scale as follows: 1.
Identify a physical property of a substance which varies in a known way with temperature and which can easily be measured.
2.
Measure the value of the physical property at the lower fixed point, 00C.
3.
Measure the value of the physical property at the upper fixed point, 1000C 4.
Finally measure the value of the physical property at the unknown temperature 00C 265PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS X 1000C 100 X q 0C 0 X 00C 0 Fig.
4.3 Let value of physical property at 00C = X 0 Let value of physical property at 1000C = X 100 Let value of physical property at q 0C = X 0 If change in physical property is directly proportional to change in temperature, then using proportions, we have X - x = q – 0 0 C q o x – x 100 - 0oC 100 o 0 = xo - x o 100 x - x 100 o 0 = x - x x 100 o o x100 - x o This method can be used to measure an unknown temperature where a calibrated thermometer is not available.
Worked example The upper and lower fixed points of a certain thermometer are 30cm apart.
On a certain day, the length of mercury thread in the thermometer is 9 cm above the ice point.
What is the temperature recorded by the thermometer on (a) Celsuis scale (b) Kelvin scale?
266PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution 1000C X100 373K 30cm 00C Xt T 00C X 273K 0 Fig.
4.4 (a) Using proportions, we have q – 0 9 100 - 0 = 30 0 = 9 100 30 0 = 9 x 100 = 300C 30 (b) Again using proportions, we have T - 273 = 9 373 - 273 30 T - 273 = 9 100 30 T - 273 = 9 x 100 = 30 30 T = 30 + 273 = 303K Alternatively for (b), once 0 has been obtained in (a), we can apply the conversion formula as follows: T = t + 273 T = q + 273 T = 30 + 273 = 303K 267PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (c) Constant Volume Gas Thermometer Scale (i) Upper fixed point is the triple point of water.
Definition The triple point of water is the temperature at which ice liquid water and water vapour coexist in equilibrium.
(ii) Lower fixed point is the absolute zero or Ok (-273oC).
The scale is usually calibrated at these two fixed points and other temperatures are obtained by measuring the pressure of the gas at the unknown temperature and making use of the definition of temperature in the scale given below.
Determination of Temperature on the Constant volume Gas Thermometer Scale.
Suppose the unknown temperature = T Let temperature of the triple point of water = T = 273.16K tr Let pressure of gas at the unknown temperature = P T Let pressure of gas at triple point of water = P tr Using T = P , we have 1 1 T P 2 2 T = Pr T P tr tr T = P T 273.16 P tr T = P x 273.16 T P tr For elementary work, where ice point is used instead of the triple point, we have T = P x 273.16 T P ice (d) Standard Thermometer Scale Early experiments measured temperature with mercury thermometers and often found that different instruments gave different readings for the same temperature.
Other types of thermometers such as the platinum resistance or the gas thermometers which were used later had the same problem.
It became clear that one type of thermometer based on one 268PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS scale of temperature would have to be taken as standard.
Gas thermometers, either the constant volume or constant pressure types, showed the closest agreement over a wide range of temperatures.
They were also very sensitive, accurate and highly reproduceable.
It was observed that as the pressure was lowered (approaching zero), all gas thermometers indicate the same reading.
Lord kelvin suggested that the standard scale of temperature should be based on an imaginary ideal gas with properties that were those of real gases at very low i.e it obeyed Boyle’s law.
He proposed that the product of the pressure and volume of this ideal gas should be used as the thermometric property of the gas.
Thus if P , P are the pressures and 1 2 V , V the volumes of the gas at temperatures T T , then 1 2 1 2 T = P V ……………….
(1) 1 1 1 T P V 2 2 2 If the volume is kept constant, then we have T = P ……………..(2) 1 1 T P 2 2 Which gives a definition of temperature on the constant – volume gas thermometer scale.
If however, pressure is kept constant, we have T = V …………………..(3) 1 1 T V 2 2 which gives a definition of the temperature on the constant-pressure gas thermometer scale.
For practical reasons (among which were the extreme sensitivity of the steam point to pressure changes) another upper fixed point, the triple point of water, was chosen to replace the steam point as the upper fixed point on the proposed standard temperature scale.
The absolute zero (OK) was chosen as the lower fixed point.
As it has already been pointed out either the constant-volume or constant-pressure gas thermometer could be reliably used for measuring temperatures in this scale since at low pressures all gases (including the imaginary ideal gas) give the same reading.
However, the constant – volume gas thermometer has been chosen and hence the standard thermometer scale “is the same as the constant-volume gas thermometer scale” It is also called “ideal gas scale “or thermodynamic temperature scale.
We have already defined unknown temperature on this scale as follows: 269PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS T = P x 273.16 T P tr where T is the unknown temperature, P is the pressure of the gas at the T unknown temperature, T, P is the pressure of the gas at the triple point tr of water and 273.16 is the triple point of water.
(d) International Practical Temperature Scale (IPTS) Measuring temperatures on the standard thermometer scale (or ideal gas scale) using the constant –volume gas thermometer is a tedious exercise.
The international temperature scale (ITS) was therefore proposed and adopted as a more practical scale for general use.
The scale consists of eleven primary fixed points ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.81K) to the freezing point of gold (1337.58K), which have been accurately determined on the ideal gas scale by a constant volume gas thermometer and also some other secondary fixed points.
Particular types of thermometer are specified for measuring temperatures over a certain range using agreed formulas.
At the fixed points, there is agreement between the IPTS and the Kelvin scale, the differences at the intervening temperatures being usually negligible.
3.4 Types of Thermometer 3.4.1 Liquid – in – Glass Thermometer This is the most common type of thermometer.
Temperature is measured by measuring the volume of a fixed mass of liquid inside the thermometer owing to change in temperature.
Mercury and alcohol are the common liquids used in this type of thermometer but mercury thermometers are more commonly in use.
Mercury is preferred because.
(i) It is easily seen (ii) It expands almost uniformly with increase in temperature, (iii) It does not stick to or wet glass (iv) Its temperature range, -39oC to 357oC, is convenient for normal use.
Figure .4.5 shows a mercury-in-glass thermometer with fixed points indicate in the Celsius and Kelvin scale of temperature.
The thermometer is made sensitive by: (a) using thin glass for the bulb to enable the liquid in the bulb to assume the temperature of its surrounding very quickly, 270PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (b) using a narrow capillary tube of uniform bore to make it possible for small temperature changes to cause large changes in volume of mercury (or length of mercury thread).
(c) using a liquid of high expansivity such as mercury (note the properties of mercury listed above earlier).
Fig.
4.5: Mercury –in – glass thermometer Water as a thermometric liquid Water is unsuitable as a thermometric liquid for the following reasons: (i) It has a small range of expansion – it freezes at 0oC and boils at 1000C (ii) It does not expand uniformly and between 00C and 40C it contracts when heated and expands when cooled (anomalous expansion).
(iii) It wets glass (unlike mercury it leaves traces of water as it moves on the glass.
(iv) It is colourless, making the mercury in glass difficult to read.
271PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4.2 Comparison of Mercury and Alcohol as Thermometric Liquids The following (Table 4.2) shows the comparison of mercury and alcohol as thermometric liquids.

Points 1-5 above represent the advantages of mercury over alcohol as a thermometric liquid while points 6 and 7 represent the advantages of alcohol over mercury (or the disadvantage of mercury over alcohol).
Other types of liquid – in – glass thermometer.
Apart from the type of mercury –in-glass thermometer commonly used in schools and hospitals, we also have (a) Clinical Thermometer This type of thermometer is used in hospital for measuring the temperature of the human body.
It has range of 35oC to 43oC because the normal temperature of a healthy person is about 37oC but may rise to about 41oC during high fever.
This is illustrated in Fig.
4.6 below: Fig.
4.6: Clinical thermometer (b) Maximum and Minimum Thermometer This type of thermometer is used by weathermen in the meteorological department to record maximum and minimum temperature for a day in meteorological stations.
.
The information is used to predict weather.
Six’s combined maximum and minimum thermometer named after the inventor, James Six, is most commonly used.
Fig.
4.7 illustrates the major features of the thermometer.
Two steel indices A and A , 1 2 floating in the alcohol in both aims of the tube, are used to read the minimum and maximum temperatures respectively.
When temperature rises, the alcohol expands pushing the mercury round the thermometer.
As a result the steel index A is pushed upwards.
Its 2 lower end indicates the maximum temperature, which is read from the attached scale.
Decrease in temperature cause the alcohol to contract so 273PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS that mercury moves up the minimum arm, pushing the steel index A 1 upwards.

4.7: Six’s maximum and minimum thermometer The lower end of this index (A ) indicates the minimum temperature 1 reached.
Tiny springs attached to A and A enable them to remain in 1 2 positions to which they have been pushed.
A magnet is used to reset the indices by bringing them in touch with the mercury column more.
3.4.3 Gas Thermometers Liquid-in-glass thermometers are not very suitable for very accurate measurements of temperature.
This is mainly because the glass containing the mercury or alcohol also expands with the liquid in an irregular manner.
Again such thermometers have relatively small temperature range determined by the boiling and freezing points of the liquids used.
For accurate temperature measurements, gas thermometers are used.
They are usually of two main types: constant-pressure gas thermometers in which the pressure or volume respectively of a fixed mass of gas increases linearly as temperature increases.
Constant volume gas 274PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS thermometers are more commonly used than their constant – pressure counter – parts.
Constant Volume Gas Thermometer Fig.
4.8 shows the main features of a constant volume gas thermometer.
It consists of a flask containing dry air or nitrogen connected to a manometer tube by means of a capillary tube.
The mark A is the constant volume mark.
In order to measure the pressure of the gas in the flask , the height of the mercury reservoir B is adjusted until the mercury level in the capillary tube reaches the level A, the Fig.
4.8: Constant volume gas thermometer h = difference in mercury levels in the manometer at A and B (measurement in cm), H = height of mercury barometer (atmospheric pressure) then the pressure (p) of the gas in the flask is given by the total pressure on the gas P = the total pressure on the gas (H + h) cm mercury where H = atmospheric height.

4.9 shows the main features of a platinum resistance thermometer which makes use of the fact that the electrical resistance of a metallic conductor changes proportionally with its temperature.
If the temperature increases, the resistance also increases.
Fig.
4.9: Platinum resistance thermometer The thermometer consists of a long thin platinum wire wound (non- conductively) round a small spool made of mica or silica.
The ends of the wire are connected to a resistance measuring device such as the metre bridge.
If a given platinum wire has a resistance R at 0oC, R at o 100 1000C and R at an unknown temperatureq , then the unknown q temperature is given by q = R - Ro x 100oC q R100 - Ro 276PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS In most cases, the temperature scale may be calibrated to read the temperature directly.
Platinum resistance thermometers are useful for measuring very low and very high temperatures, usually of range – 1800 to 1,1500C.
3.4.5 Thermoelectric Thermometer Fig 4.10: Thermoelectric thermometers A thermoelectric thermometer is essentially a thermocouple and works on the principle of the thermometer.
It consists of two different metals, e.g.
copper and constantan joined at the ends.
One end, the hot junction, is heated (or cooled) while the other end, the cold junction, is kept constant at the temperature of melting i.e.
so that a current (usually in milliamperes) flows along the metals.
The thermometer is connected in series to a potentiometer which measures the e.m.f across the ends of the metals in millivolts.
The value of the e.m.f depends on the difference between the temperature of the hot and cold junction.
Suppose E = emf at 00C (ice point) o E = emf at 1000C (steam point) 100 E = emf at the unknown temperatureq , o Then q = E - Eo x 1000C q E - E 100 o Thermoelectric thermometers are particularly useful for measuring very high temperatures in industry.
Advantages of the thermometer are as follows: (i) It is very sensitive and can measure rapidly changing or momentary temperatures (ii) It can measure high temperature up to 5000C.
(iii) It is very small in size and so can measure the temperature at a point.
277PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4.6 Optical Pyrometers When it is required to make accurate measurements of very high temperature, optical pyrometers are used.
This is done by observing the radiation from the hot body and the process is called pyrometer and the instrument used a radiation pyrometer or optical pyrometer.
Optical pyrometers make use of the principle that very hot substances change colour at certain known temperatures.
For example the temperature of steel, when it is below red heat, can be judged by its colour.
Temperatures below red heat can also be estimated by the use of paints which change colours at known temperatures.
Radiation pyrometers can be used to measure temperatures (e.g.
of furnaces) only above red-heat which is about 600oC.
They fall into two major classes: (i) Optical radiation pyrometers, which respond only to visible light and (ii) Total radiation pyrometers , which respond to the total radiation from the hot body, heat and light Fig.
4.11: Optical radiation pyrometer The principle of the commonest type of optical radiation pyrometer also known as the “disappearing filament” optical pyrometer is illustrated in Fig.
4.11.
Light from the hot source and the tungsten filament lamp is made to pass through a red filter of a known wavelength range before it reaches the eye.
The eyepiece of the instrument (not shown in the figure but between the eye and the filter) is focused upon the filament of the tungsten light .The hot source, S whose temperature is required is then focused by the objective lens, L so that its images also lies in the plane of F. The light from both the hot source and the filament passes through 278PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the red filter (of red glass) before reaching the eye.
Both of them (source and filament) therefore appear red.
If the body is brighter than the filament, the filament appears dark on a bright background.
If the filament is brighter than the source, it appears bright on a dark background.
By adjusting the current through it, the temperature of the filament is adjusted until it merges as nearly as possible into its background.
It is then as bright as the body or source and is said to have “disappeared’.
The rheostat R which adjusts the current as well as the ammeter A which measures the current are both mounted on the body of the pyrometer.
The ammeter is usually calibrated to read the temperature directly in degrees Celsius.
Radiation pyrometers of this type can measure temperatures up to 10000C (i.e range between 6000C and 10000C but more elaborated pyrometers can be adjusted to measure much higher temperatures.
Generally the range of a radiation pyrometer can be extended by introducing a green filter between objective lense L and 1 the filament lamp.
This reduces the brightness of the red filter.
When this is done, a second scale on the ammeter is provided for reading the temperature accurately when such a green filter is inserted Summary of Ranges, Advantages and Disadvantage of Thermometers Table 4.3 presents a summary the ranges, advantages and disadvantages of the common types of thermometers discussed.

You will learn to explain the modes of heat transfer using kinetic molecular theory.
In addition, you will learn the important concepts of heat energy – the heat capacities, their measurements and determination.
Finally, you will learn Newton’s law of cooling and cooling correction.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the time you finish this unit, you will be able to: • explain conduction, convection and radiation in terms of kinetic molecular theory • know the difference between good and bad conductors of heat using metals water and air as examples • explain the relationship between the heat supplied to a substance and o its temperature change at constant mass o Its mass at constant temperature changes • explain the terms specific heat capacity and thermal capacity • explain why there is unequal rise in temperature for different substances of the same mass supplied with the same quality of heat • state the assumptions underlying the experiments involving the measurements of heat capacities • calculate unknown qualities using the relation h = mc D t when no change of state is involved • state Newton’s law of cooling • explain the Newton’s law of cooling; and the cooling correction.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Conduction of Heat It is an everyday experience that when you dip a silver spoon into a hot tea, the handle of the spoon very quickly feels hotter than it was before.
The heat from the hot tea has been transferred along the metal handle to the other end of the spoon by the process of conduction.
287PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Conduction of heat is a process by which heat energy is transferred through a material, the average position of the particles of the material remaining the same.
Heat energy is always transferred when different parts of a solid body are at different temperatures.
The direction of heat transfer is always from the hotter to the cooler parts of the solid.
3.1.1 Good and Bad Conductors of Heat Most metals such as copper, aluminum, silver, iron, allow heat energy to pass through them very easily.
We refer to such materials as good conductors of heat.
They are used where heat is required to travel quickly (eg the cooking utensil).
On the other hand, we refer to those materials which do not allow heat to pass easily through them as poor conductors of heat or insulators.
Examples of such materials are most non-metals such as water, air, wood, plastic, cloth, cotton wool, cork.
The handle of a cooking utensil is made of wood or plastic which are insulators so that heat cannot be conducted quickly through them.
The ability of a metal to conduct heat is known as its thermal conductivity.
3.1.2 Experiment to compare the thermal conductivities of materials Water Copper Tank Brass Iron WoodLead Fig.
5.1: Comparison of thermal conductivities An experiment to compare the conductivity of different substances is illustrated Fig.
5.1.
A metal container has rods of different materials but of the same length and diameter fitted into holes in one of the sides by means of corks as 288PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS shown.
The rods are first dipped into molten paraffin wax; when they are withdrawn, a coating of wax solidifies on them.
Boiling water is then poured into the container so that the ends of the rods are heated to the same temperature.
The wax on the rods begins to melt from the hot ends and after some time, it is found that the wax has melted to different distances along the rods, with the copper rod having the longest length, followed by aluminum, iron, lead while the wooden rod hardly melts at all.
This indicated that the different substances have different thermal conductivities.
Thus, in this experiment, copper has the greatest while wood has the least thermal conductivity.
3.1.3 Explanation of Conduction in Terms of Kinetic Molecular Theory Layers of molecules ABCD Boiling Direction of heat transfer Water Fig.
5.2: Molecular explanation of conduction Heat is transferred through solids mainly by conduction because of the nature of solid molecules which are very close together.
When we heat a portion of solid directly as shown in Fig.
5.2, the solid molecules that are directly heated (layer A) absorb the heat and vibrated faster than before the heat was applied.
They do not move from place to place because of the strong forces of attraction between them.
As they vibrate, they pass on some of their heat energy to their neighbours (layer B) which is turn vibrate faster and pass on some of the heat to the next layer of molecules (c), and so on..
The heat continues to move in this way until it reaches the end of the solid.
All the molecules of the solid eventually vibrate more rapidly about their fixed positions.
We say that thermal energy is transferred along the solid although the average position of the molecules remains unchanged.
When heat is transferred in this way, it is said to be conducted along the body.
289PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.1.4 Thermal Conductivity of Liquids and Air Boiling water Heat Ice wraped in wire gaize Fig.
5.3 Water, a bad conductor of heat Water and other liquids are poor conductors of heat.
The only exception is mercury which is a metal in liquid form.
You can verify that water is a poor conductors of heat by the following simple experiment.
You will wrap a piece of ice in wire gauze to make it sink to the bottom of a test tube of water.
Heat the top of the water as shown in Fig.
5.3 (to prevent convection).
You will observe that the ice does not melt even when the water at the top of the tube boils.
This shows that water is a bad conductor of heat.
To show that air is a poor conductor of heat, hold your hand very close but not touching the side of a kettle of boiling water.
You can feel the radiation but your hand is not burned although separated from the kettle by a thin layer of air.
3.1.5 Practical applications of Good and Bad Conductors Here, we will consider the following practical applications of good and bad conductors • Cooking pots and frying pans –made of metals to ensure quick transfer of heat from the fire to the food being cooked.
The handles of cooking utensils are made of insulators so that the utensils when hot can be held comfortably by the handles.
• Home cooling in the tropics – asbestos ceiling and thatched-roof houses prevent heating up of houses because their materials are insulators and do not conduct the heat from the sun into the room.
290PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • The use of cloth to keep warm – clothes keep us warm by trapping air (poor conductors) around the body.
Clothing made from woollen and fur materials are worn in the cold climates to retain heat and keep the body warm.
• Use of rugs on floors – Heat transferred from one’s foot to the floor is conducted away quickly by the floor and the foot feels cold but the rug does not conduct away heat rapidly.
It heats up to the temperature of the foot.
• Cotton wool and air used as insulators to reduce to the minimum the loss of heat in calorimeters.
This is called lagging.
3.2 Convection of Heat through Liquids and Gases You have seen that liquids and gases are generally poor conductors of heat.
However, heat is effectively transferred in them by convection.
• Convection is the process by which heat is transferred in a liquid or gas by the actual movement of the heated fluid from the hotter to the colder parts.
3.2.1 Convection Current in Liquids You can observe convection in liquids by performing this simple activity.
You will fill about two-thirds of a large round bottomed flask with water.
Drop a tiny crystal of potassium permanganate, using a long glass tube, at the bottom of the flask.
Heat the bottom of the flask just below the crystal gently and observe the movement of the coloured liquid.
You will observe that the colour streaks of the potassium permanganate rises upwards from the bottom of the flask where the heat was applied.
The streaks curve downwards at the top of the water as shown in figure 5.4 below.
291PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Drop crystal of potassium permanganate Water Convection current Potassium permanganate crystal Heat Fig.
5.4: Convection current in liquid The upward movement of the coloured streaks is due to convection and the circulation of the liquid is called convection current.
The movement of the convection current is explained as follows: The heated liquid at the bottom of the vessel expands and rises up because warm water has a smaller density than cold water.
The ascending water carries some heat with it and the colder, denser water falls to the bottom where it gets heated itself and also rises.
This sets up convection current which circulates continually.
3.2.2 Explanation of Convection in Terms of Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT) We explain convection in terms of KMT as follows: When the water is heated below, its molecules at the point of heating gain more kinetic energy, expand by vibrating farther away from their 292PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS fixed position, become less dense and therefore rise.
The denser molecules from the top sink to the place of those that have risen above.
These molecules in turn get heated and rise.
With the heating, upward warm currents and downward cooler currents are established until the water boils.
3.2.3 Convection Current Artificial/Natural Current Gases expand much more readily than liquids.
As a result, convection currents are easily set up in gases when their temperature rises.
Here, you will study the diagrams (Fig.
5.5) illustrating convection current in nature: Land and sea breezes, showing convection current in gases.
Fig.
5.5: Land and sea breezes 3.2.4 Practical Applications of Convection Current Convection current is important to us in the following ways: • Land and sea breezes: In daytime, the sun warms the land to a higher temperature than the sea, because land has a lower specific heat capacity than sea-water and the sea is always in motion.
The warm air above the land rises, and cooler air from the sea moves in and takes its place.
The convection current is completed by the air in the upper atmosphere moving down in the opposite direction, and we have sea breeze.
At night, the temperature of the land drops much faster than that of the sea.
As a result the sea is warmer than the land.
Convection current is set up in the opposite direction to the daytime.
We call the breeze moving from the land to the sea land breeze.
The process is illustrated in Fig.
5.5 above.
293PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Convection current is used in house ventilation, in motor car cooling systems in domestic hot water systems, and air conditioning of rooms.
• Glider pilots use convection current as air lift for their gliders.
• Winds are caused by convection currents in the atmosphere,.
Near the equator hot air rises, and cooler and denser air from the Polar Regions flows in and takes its place.
3.3 Radiation of Heat You experience radiant heat (heat energy given out by radiation) in your daily life heat from the sun and by warming yourself by the fire side.
It requires no material medium.
Radiation is the process by which heat is transferred from a hotter to a cooler place without heating of the intervening medium.
We refer to radiation as electromagnetic wave of the type called intra red.
It travels with the velocity of light (3 x 108m51).
It can be detected by a radiometer and a thermopile.
3.3.1 Emission and Absorption of Radiation by Different Surfaces We know that different types of surfaces at the same temperature unit or radiate heat at different rates depending on the nature of the surface.
For a given temperature, a dull black surface radiates most and a highly polished surface radiates least.
You can verify this by performing this simply experiment.
Dull black Highly polished surface surface Cork falls Cork holds firm as war melts Wax does not melt Wax melts Bunsen burnes first Fig.
5.6: Comparison of heat absorption by two surfaces 294PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS You will use two sheets of thin plates, one painted black and the other highly polished as shown in Fig.
5.6.
Attach a cork to the reverse side of each plate using a candle wax.
Place a hot object like Bunsen burner or burning candle half way between the two surfaces fixed vertically facing each other and a few centimetres apart.
After a few minutes, you will notice that the wax behind the dull black surface begins to slide off the plate.
The wax behind the polished surface does not melt and the cork remains fixed.
From this activity you can conclude that the dull black surfaces are better absorbers of radiant heat than polished surface.
Also, good emitters of heat are good absorbers.
Heat energy falling on a body is partly absorbed and partly, reflected.
Black surfaces are good absorbers and poor reflectors; poor absorbers are good reflectors of heat.
3.3.2 Applications of Radiation • Heat from the sun gets to us by the process of radiation.
• House roofs in the tropics as well as factory roofs are brightly painted in shiny aluminium colour to reduce absorption of heat during the day.
It also reduces the heat loss by radiation at night.
• It is not advisable to wear a dark coloured jacket in hot sunshine because it will absorb heat and make the wearer feel hot and uncomfortable.
Also, a brightly painted car is preferred to a black-painted car in Nigeria and other hot tropical countries.
The black-painted car will absorb and retain heat from the sun and inside the car will be very hot.
• Petrol storage tanks are sprayed with silver paints to reflect heat rays falling on it.
• A teapot has a silvery surface and an electric iron has a silvered surface base in order to make each capable of retaining its heat for a long period.
* A fire-fighting suit is bright and shiny so that it does not absorb much heat to burn the fire man.

296PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4 Heat Capacity and Specific Heat Capacity 3.4.1 Heat capacity – definition, symbol and unit As you know, the supply of heat to a substance increases the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the substance hence, an increase in temperature of the substance.
The average kinetic energy gained by the molecules per degree Celsius rise in temperature is the heat (thermal) capacity of the substance.
Definition The heat capacity of a substance is defined as the heat energy required to raise the temperature of the substance by 10C (or 1K).
Symbol C; S .I.
unit: joule per Kelvin (J/K).
3.4.2 Specific Heat Capacity – Definition, Symbol and Unit From simple experiment, we know that equal masses of different substances require different quantities of thermal (heat) energy to raise them through the same temperature range.
To take care of these differences and to make it possible to calculate the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance through a definite temperature range, the idea of specific heat capacity was introduced.
Definition Specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance by 10C (or IK).
Symbol C; S.I unit joule per kilogram per Kelvin (Jkg-1K-1) You will note that Heat capacity of a substance C = Mass of the substance x specific heat capacity of the substance.
297PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS When the temperature of a substance changes, heat energy given out (or received).
Q = mass x specific heat capacity x temperature change.
In symbols: C = mc …………………….
(1) and Q = mc (q - q ) …………….
(2) 2 1 where C = heat capacity of the substance Q = heat energy M = mass of substance C = specific heat capacity of the substance q 2 = higher temperature q 1 = lower temperature (q - q ) = temperature change) 2 1 We call Q the quantity of heat – it is sometimes denoted by H. 3.5 Measurement of Specific Heat Capacity of a Substance We call the instruments designed for experiments to measure quantities of heat and specific heat capacities calorimeters.
The simple calorimeter used in school laboratories is usually made of copper which is a good conductor of heat.
This enables it to reach the same temperature as its contents quickly.
The calorimeter is placed inside a larger container and the two are separated by layers of lagging material- a poor conductor of heat.
To ensure an even temperature, a stirrer is provided while the lid prevents evaporation of the liquid in the calorimeter.
Here, we are going to consider two methods of determining the specific heat capacities of solids and liquids.
3.5.1 Method of Mixtures (i) Specific heat capacity of solids by the method of mixtures.
298PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Thermometer String Boiling water Solid of unknown heat capacity Heat Source Thermometer Stirrer String Outer container Lagging material Calorimeters Solid Calorimeter Fig.
5.8: Determination of specific heat capacity by the method of mixtures In this experiment, the solid (eg a metal block is first weighed and its mass recorded .
it heated in boiling water as shown in Fig.
5.8 for some minutes to allow it assume the temperature of the boiling water.
The solid is then quickly transferred to a copper calorimeter which had been previously weighed empty and when about half-full of water.
The initial temperature of the water in the calorimeter is taken before the hot solid is transferred into it.
The mixture of solid and water in the calorimeter is gently stirred to attain even temperature.
The highest temperature attained is recorded.
The specific heat capacity is calculated as follows: Mass of calorimeter = m (kg) 1 Mass of calorimeter + water = m (kg) 2 Mass of solid = m (kg) 3 Initial temperature of water and calorimeter = q 0 C 1 Temperature of solid in boiling water = 1000C Temperature of mixture = q 0 C 2 Mass of water = (m - m ) kg 2 1 Specific heat capacity of water = 4200Jkg K -1 -1 Specific heat capacity of copper = 420 J kg K -1 -1 Let specific heat capacity of metal = CJ kg K -1 -1 299PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Heat lost by hot metal = m c (100 - q ) J 3 2 Heat gained by water = (m – m ) x 4200 x (q - q ) J 2 1 2 1 Heat gained by calorimeter = m x 420 x (q - q ) J 1 2 1 Assuming no heat is lost to the surrounding and no heat is equally gained, we have that: Heat lost by the solid = heat gained by the calorimeter and water.
M3C [(100 - q ) = (m - m ) x 4200 + (m x 420)] (q - q )....(3) 2 2 1 1 2 1 You can calculate the value of c for the solid from equ (3) if the values of the other variables are known.
Precautions You will take the following precautions when performing the above experiment in the laboratory.
• Lag the calorimeter to prevent heat exchange with the surroundings.
• Transfer the hot metal quickly to the calorimeter without splashing • Stir the mixture gently (ii) Specific heat capacity of liquids by method of mixtures.
We carry out this experiment as above.
But here, we use a liquid of unknown specific heat capacity instead of water in the calorimeter.
We also use a solid of known specific heat capacity.
The specific heat capacity is again calculated as follows: Mass of calorimeter = m (kg) 1 Mass of calorimeter + liquid = m (kg) 2 Mass of solid = m (kg) 3 Initial temperature of liquid + calorimeter = q 0C 1 Temperature of mixture = q 0 C 2 Temperature of hot solid = 1000C Specific heat capacity of copper calorimeter = 420Jkg -1 K -1 Known specific heat capacity of metal = C J kg -1 K -1 1 Let specific heat capacity of liquid = C J kg -1 K -1 2 Heat lost by hot metal = M C (100 - q ) 3 1 2 Heat gained by calorimeter = M x 420 x (q - q ) 1 2 1 Heat gained by liquid = (M - M ) x C x (q - q ) 2 1 2 2 1 300PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Since, heat gained = heat lost We have M x 420 x (q - q ) + (m - m ) x C x (q - q ) 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 = M C ( 100 - q 2) ………(4) 3 1 The specific heat capacity of the liquid C would then be calculated from 2 equ.
4 when all the other variables are known.
3.5.2 Electrical Method Specific heat capacity of solid by electrical method Fig.
5.9: Measurement of specific heat capacity of solid by electrical method.
Two holes are bored in the block whose specific heat capacity is to be measured as shown in Fig.
5.9.
The block is weighed .A thermometer and an electrical heater are respectively inserted in each of the holes.
A little oil is dropped in each hole to help establish a good thermal contact with the block.
The metal block is surrounded with a lagged jacket to reduce heat losses.
The initial temperature of the block is noted and the electrical heater is switched on.
The current is allowed to flow for some time until the temperature rises by about 150C.
The exact time of flow of a known current is measured with a stop-watch and the initial and final temperatures of the metal block are measured by the thermometer.
The specifc heat capacity is calculated as follows: Let: Mass of block = m (kg) Value of steady current = 1 (A) Value of p.d.
across heater = V(v) 301PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Temeprature rise of block = q 0C Time of flow of currnt = t (secs) Specific heat capacity of block = C(Jkg -1K-1) Heat supplied by current = H = 1Vt joules.
Heat required to raise the temperauter of block By q 0C = mc q Assuming no heat loss to the surroundings, we have.
1Vt = Mc q C = 1vt J kg -1 K -1 …………….5 mq (iii) Specific heat capacity of a liquid by the electrical method Fig.
5.10: Determination of specific heat capacity of liquid by electrical method In this experiment, the apparatus is set up as shown in Fig.
5.10.
First, we weigh a plastic container and then reweighed when about two –thirds full of the liquid (e.g.
water).
We then connect the ammeter, voltmeter and heating coil as shown in the circuit.
A plastic stirrer and a thermometer are then fitted into the container through holes in the wooden lid.
The initial temperature of the liquid is read and recorder.
The current is now switched on end the rheostat adjusts to give a suitable steady current for about 3 minutes.
This is followed by stirring the liquid gently as it is being heated.
The current is then switched off and the final temperature read.
302PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS We calculate the specific heat capacity of the liquid as follows: Mass of liquid = mkg Initial temperature of liquid= q 0C 1 Final temperature of liquid = q 0C 2 Current flowing in circuit = IA Voltage across heating coil = V volts Time of flow of current = t seconds Let the specific heat capacity of liquid = CJkg-1K-1 Rise in temperature Heat gained by liquid = mc (q - q ) joules Electrical energy supplied 2 1 to liquid = 1vt joules Heat gained by liquid = electrical energy supplied This implies that : MC (q 2 - q 1) = 1Vt C = 1 vt ………………...7 M(q - q ) 2 1 Precautions • Cooling the water with ice to about 100Cbelow room temperature to reduce heat lost to the surrounding.
• Heating water until its final temperature is about 100C above room temperature for above reason.
3.6 Newton’s Law of Cooling • Newton’s law of cooling stats that for a small difference of temperature between body and its surrounding , the rate at which a body loses heat is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
The law is approximately true in still air only for a temperature excess of about 200oC or 300oC.
It is true for all excess temperature in conditions of forced convection of the air, i.e.
in a draught.
At low excess temperature less than 10oC, radiation is the major contributing factor to the rate of cooling of an object.
3.6.1 To demonstrate Newton’s law of cooling, we plot a temperature (q ) – time (t) cooling curve for hot water in a calorimeter placed in a draught (Fig.
5.11(a)) 303PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS If Q is the room temperature, then the excess temperature of the water R is (q - q ).
At various temperature such as q in Fig.
5.11 (b), we may R draw targets such as APC to the curve.
The slope of the target in degrees per second, gives us the rate of fall of temperature when the water is at the temperature q .
If we then plot these rates against the excess temperature q - q , as in R Fig.
5.11 ( c ), we will obtain a straight line passing through the origin.
The result of the experiment shows that the heat lost per second by water and calorimeter is proportional to the rate of fall of the temperature.
This is in agreement with Newton’s law of cooling.
3.6.2 Correction for Heat Losses in Calorimetry When a hot body is transferred to a liquid in a calorimeter, the temperature of the liquid and the calorimeter rises rapidly above that of the surrounding.
From Newton’s law of cooling, you can deduce that an amount of heat is lost to the surrounding because allowance is not made for this when reading the final temperature of the mixture.
As a result, the final temperature recorded is less than the actual final temperature and correction has to be made for this.
Newton’s law of cooling enables us to estimate the heat lost in an experiment in the method of mixtures.
In doing this experiment, we take the temperature of the mixture at half minutes intervals and plot it against time as shown in Fig.
5.12.
304PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS temp Qc p c Q R t Time 1 Fig.
5.12: Cooling correction The broken line shows how we would expect the temperature to rise if no heat were lost, we have therefore to estimate the difference, P, between the plateau of this imaginary curve and the crest of the experimental curve, C. P is known as the cooling correction.
That is, the temperature to be added to the observed final temperature to compensate for loss of heat (the cooling correction).
As a precaution, you may cool the liquid initially to an amount of temperature (about 100C) below room temperature so that the temperature rise above room temperature at steady state should be equal to the fall in temperature of the liquid below room temperature before transferring the solid into it.
Worked examples A lump of copper of unknown mass is heated to 1000C.
If the final temperature is 550C when dropped in 250 g of water at 40oC, calculate the mass of copper, (specific heat capacity of water is 4200 Jkg-1K-1, copper is 380J kg-1 K-1) Solution Let the mass of copper in kilogram = Mc Heat in joule lost by copper = Heat in joule gained by water Mc x C x (q - q ) = m x c x ( q - q ) 2 1 2 1 Mc x 380 x (100 – 55) = 0.25 x 4200 x (55 - 40) (cid:222) mc = 0.25 x 4200 x 15 = 0.92 kg 380 x 45 The mass of copper is 0.92 kg 305PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (2) An electric heat rated 20v 60w, fitted into a metal block supplied heat to the block of mass 2kg, and specific heat capacity of 460 J kg-1 K -1.
Calculate the temperature rise in the block if the current flows for 15 minutes Solution Power of heater = 1v = 60w Heat produced by heater in 15 minutes = power x time (in seconds) = 60 x 15 x 60J = 54000J.
Let temperature rise in metal block = q K Heat gained by metal block = 2 x 460 x q J.
Heat produced by heater = Heat gained by metal block = 54000 = 2 x 460 x q q = 54000 = 58.7k or 58.7oC 2 x 460 The temperature rise in the block is 58.7 K or 58.70C.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 310PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.1 Latent Heat 3.1.1 Concept of latent heat You must have observed that when sufficient heat is given to a solid it melts into liquid.
If heat continues to be supplied, the temperature remains constant until all the solid has changed to liquid.
The heat supplied to melt the solid is called latent heat because the temperature gave no indication of the heat required to change from a solid to a liquid.
Also, if the liquid is heated further, its temperature rises until it reaches a constant temperature.
Then, it begins to change into vapour or gas Again this heat is called latent heat because of change of state from liquid to gas which gave no indication of heat required to change the substance from liquid to gas.
That is during change of state, Solid (heat) Liquid (heat) Gas (Constant temperature) (Constant Temperature) Temperature remains constant although heat is being supplied.
The heat supplied or removed, which causes a change of state without a change in temperature is called latent heat.
It is called latent (meaning hidden) heat because it is not made apparent by a change in temperature.
3.1.2 Molecular Explanation of Latent Heat You already know that the molecules of a solid are kept in average fixed position by strong forces of attraction.
Latent heat represents the energy used in breaking down the forces which hold the molecules of a solid in a regular pattern.
In liquid, it is the energy required to overcome the forces of attraction between molecules of a liquid.
The molecules are then practically independent of each other and exist as gas.
3.1.3 Types and Definitions of Latent Heat There are two types of latent heat namely: i.
Latent heat of fusion (melting) (from solid to liquid) ii.
Latent heat of vaporization (gas or vapour) (from liquid to gas) 311PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Definitions i.
Latent heat of fusion of a solid is the heat energy that is used to change a solid at its melting point to liquid at the same temperature (the energy is stored in the hot liquid) ii.
The specific latent heat of fusion of a solid is the energy required to melt 1kg of the solid at its melting point.
It is equal to the energy given out by 1 kg of the liquid in order to solidify at the freezing point.
If Q heat energy is supplied to melt mass M of solid at its melting point, then the specific latent heat L is given by L = Q M Q = ML where: L = specific latent heat Q = heat energy M = mass of solid at melting point Unit Jg-1 or Jkg -1 iii.
Latent heat of vaporization of a liquid is the heat energy that is used to change a liquid in its boiling point to liquid at the same temperature (the energy is stored in the vapour) iv.
The specific latent heat of vaporization of a substance is the heat required to change unit mass of it from liquid at its boiling point to vapour without a change in temperature.
3.2 Numerical Problems on Latent Heat i.
A bucket has a mass of 1 kg and specific heat capacity of 378 kg-1 k-1.
It contains 4 kg of water at 40oC.
When 0.91 kg of ice at 0oC is added and completely melted the temperature of water is 18.2 oC.
What is the specific latent heat of fusion of ice?
(Assume no heat exchange with the surroundings) 312PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Solution Since no heat is lost to the surrounding: Heat lost by water + heat lost by bucket = Heat used for melting ice + heat gained by iced water from 00C to 18.20C .
Eqn…….
(1) Recall that heat lost: Q = MC (q - q ) 2 1 where Q = heat energy C = heat capacity of the substance M = mass of substance q = higher temperature 2 q = lower temperature 1 Hence: Heat lost by water = 4 x 4200 x (40 -18.2) J Heat lost by bucket = 1 x 378 x (40 -18.2) J Heat gained by iced water = 0.91 x 4200 x (18.2 – 0)0C Heat used to melt 0.91 kg of ice = 0.91L where L = the specific latent heat.
To obtain the specific latent heat of the fusion of ice we will substitute the above values in ‘eqn 1’ and solve for L. That is Heat lost by water + heat lost by bucket = Heat used for melting ice + heat gained by iced water from 00C to 18.20C (cid:222) MC (q - q ) for water + MC (q - q ) for bucket 2 1 2 1 = ML for ice + MC (q - q ) for iced water 2 1 (cid:222) [4 x 4200 x (40 – 18.2)J)]+ [(1x 378 x (40 – 18.2)J)] = 0.91L + [0.91 x 4200 x (18.2 - )J] 0.91L = [4 x 4200 x (40 – 18.2) J)] + [(1 x 378 x 40 – 18.2)J] - [0.91 x 4200 x (18.2 – 0)J] = 366240 + 8240.4 – 69560.4 = 374480.4 – 69560.4 \ L = 304920 0.91 = 335076.92 Jkg-1 313PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS ii.

6.1: Latent heat of fusion by method of mixture 314PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS To determine the specific latent heat of fusion of solid (ice) by method of mixture, we use the apparatus as set up in the diagram above.
The calorimeter is weighed empty and reweighed when it is about half-filed with water whose temperature is about 50C above room temperature.
Some small ice blocks are dried with blotting paper and then added to the water in the calorimeter.
The mixture is gently stirred and more dry ice added until the temperature of the mixture is about 50C below room temperature.
The lowest temperature of the mixture is noted after all the ice particles has melted.
The calorimeter is reweighed to find the mass of ice added.
The result is then calculated as follows: Assuming Mass of calorimeter = M 1 Mass of calorimeter + water = M 2 Mass of calorimeter + water + ice = M 3 Then: Mass of water = M - M 2 1 Mass of ice = M - M 3 2 If: Original temperature of water = q 0C 1 Final temperature of mixture = q 0C 2 Specific heat capacity of water = 4200(Jkg-1) Specific heat capacity of calorimeter + Material = C(Jkg-1) Specific latent heat of fusion of ice = l(Jkg-1) Heat required to melt the ice = (M - M ) l(joules) 3 2 Heat required to raise the temperature of melted ice from 0C to q 0C 2 =(M - M ) x 4200 x q (joules) 3 2 2 Heat lost by the calorimeter and water in cooling from q to q 1 2 = (M , C + (M - M x 4200)] (q - q )J 1 2 1) 1 2 Since: Heat gained = Heat lost (M - M ) l + ((M - M ) x 4200) (q - q ) 3 2 3 2 1 2 From the above equation, the latent heat of fusion l can be calculated.
Precautions You will take the following precautions when performing the above experiment in the laboratory: 315PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Use only dry pieces Add small quantity of ice at a time Stir the mixture gently to obtain even temperature.
ii By electrical method Electrical immersion heaters (12 v supply) Pieces of ice Filter funnels Retort stands Beakers (a) Experimental (b) Control Fig.
6.2: Latent heat of fusion by electrical method To determine the specific latent heat of fusion of solid (ice) by electrical method, we use the apparatus as set up in the diagrams above (Fig.
6.2) A 50W immersion heater is placed in a glass filter tunnel and some pieces of ice are packed round the heater.
The heater is connected to a 12v supply with the circuit as shown in Fig.
6.2a.
Since ice will melt at room temperature the same set-up is arranged as in figure 6.2b with the heater not connected to the 12v supply.
This forms a control for the experiment.
Two similar beakers of the same mass are used to collect drip water by placing one below each beaker.
Quickly empty the beakers when the drip rates from the funnels appear to be the same.
Then replace them and switch on the current.
Ensure that the heater is in good thermal contact with the ice throughout the 316PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS experiment.
Allow current to flow for about 200 seconds and note the value of the current and the potential difference.
When the drip rate appear to be constant again, remove the beakers and weigh them with their contents.
Use your result to calculate the specific latent heat of fusion in the following manner: Assuming these results are obtained: Mass of the experimental beaker + water = M 1 Mass of the control beaker + water = M 2 Mass of the ice melted by electrical heating = M - M 2 1 Current = I Potential difference = V (12v) Time of flow of current = t Energy supplied to ice = VIt This implies that: Energy supplied to melt 1 kg of ice = Energy supplied to ice Mass of ice melted by electrical heating = V x I x t = Vit Jkg-1 M - M M - M 2 1 2 1 You should note that: 1.
If Q heat energy is supplied to melt mass m of solid at its melting point then the specific latent heat L is given by L = Q M Q = ML 2.

Note the temperature of the water.
Pass dry steam into the water until the water temperature rises by about 250C above room temperature.
Note the final temperature and find the mass of steam by reweighing the calorimeter and its content.
Tabulate your readings as shown below: Mass of calorimeter = M 1 Mass of calorimeter + water = M 2 Mass of calorimeter + water + steam = M 3 Initial temperature of water + calorimeter = q 0C 1 Final temperature of mixture = q 0C 2 Temperature of steam = 1000C 318PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Let: Specific latent heat of vapourisation of steam = L(Jkg-1kg-1) Mass of water = M - M (kg) 2 1 Mass of steam = M - M (kg) 3 1 Specific heat capacity of water = 4200(Jkg-1k-1) Specific heat capacity of calorimeter material = c(Jkg-1k-1) Heat lost by steam in condensing = (M - M )joules 3 2 Heat lost by condensed steam in cooling from 1000C to q 0C = (M - M ) x 4200 x (100-q )J 2 3 2 2 Heat gained by water and calorimeter = (M - M ) x 4200 x (q - q ) + M x C (q - q ) 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 Since Heat gained = Heat lost (M - M ) x 4200 x (q - q ) + M C (q - q ) 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 = (M - M )L + (M - M ) x 4200 x (100- q ) 3 2 3 2 2 Hence L, the specific latent heat of vaporization can be calculated from the above equation.
Precautions: While performing the above experiment you should take the following precautions: Use only dry steam Take care to prevent the calorimeter from receiving or losing heat from or to its surroundings.
Cool the water to about 100C below room temperature before passing the steam.
Continue to pass the steam until the temperature of mixture is about 100C above room temperature.

Place a polystyrene (polyphenylethene) cup (beaker) on one side of a balance and partly fill it with water.
Suspend an immersion heater in the water so that it is clear of the sides and bottom.
Switch on the current.
When the water is boiling, pour leadshots into the other pan until balance is almost obtained.
As the water boils off, the two sides will balance.
At this instance start a stop-watch.
Do not allow any condensed water vapour to drop back into the cup.
Now, place a 20 g mass on the pan beside the cup.
When 20 g of water boils off, the two sides will again balance.

The heat is the latent heat used in causing the transformation from liquid to vapour.
The phenomenon is utilized in the working principles of some common household devices such as: (i) Pressure cooker (ii) The refrigerator (iii) The air conditioner.
Later in this unit, we would discuss the working principle of these devices.

321PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.5 Melting and Boiling Point 3.5.1 Melting point You know that the melting point of a substance is the temperature at which the substance changes from solid to liquid state (without further change in temperature) To find the melting point of a solid, you should follow this procedure listed below: i.
Put a solid substance (e.g naphthalene) in a tube and melt it by heating the test tube through a beaker of boiling water.
The molten naphthalene should half-fill the test tube.

6.6 : Heating and cooling curves of naphthalene 323PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Observation and Results You would observe that as the solid is heated, the temperature rises.
At a certain stage, the temperature remains constant until all the solid has changed to liquid.
This is shown by the flat portion (plateau) of the graph (Fig.
6.6a) after which the temperature starts to rise again.
This temperature at which the naphthalene melts is constant and is called the melting point of the solid naphthalene.
When the naphthalene is cooling, energy is abstracted from it.
At a stage, the liquid naphthalene starts to solidify.
This is shown in the flat (plateau) portion of the cooling curve (Fig.
6.6b) after which the temperature starts to fall.
This temperature at which a liquid changes to a solid is called the freezing point of the liquid.
You should note that the melting point and the freezing point of a substance are the same.
3.5.2 Boiling point The boiling point of a substance as you know is the temperature at which the substance begins to boil and changes from liquid to gaseous state (without further change in temperature).
To find the boiling point of a substance (Water).
For you to determine the boiling point of a liquid, you should follow those steps below: 324PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Retort stand with clamps Thermomete r Conical flask Water o o o o o o Bunsen burner (Source of heat) Fig.

Table of Values Temperature (0C) Time (sec) 325PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (b) Graph Temperature (0C) Boiling ----------- Point Time Fig.
6.8: The boiling point of a liquid (water) Observation and result You must have observed that as you heat the water in the conical flask, its temperature rises and the liquid evaporates.
As the heating is continued, the temperature is found to rise until the water begins to boil.
During boiling bubbles of air formed inside the liquid rise to the surface.
The temperature of the liquid remains steady during boiling.
This is indicated in the flat portion of the graph (plateau) Fig.
6.8 this constant temperature is called the boiling point of the liquid.
3.5.3 Effects of Impurities and Pressure on the Melting and Boiling Points of a Substance The melting and boiling points of a substance are affected by pressure and impurities.
You can verify these by investigating these scientific observations.
i.
Effect of pressure on boiling point Increase in pressure increases the boiling point of a liquid.
The pressure cooker is a practical application of the effect of pressure on boiling point.
Increased pressure of the trapped air (gas) above the liquid in a pressure cooker raises the boiling point of the liquid.
Thus a high cooking temperature is reached very fast.
Hence, food is cooked faster in the pressure cooker.
326PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS ii.
Effect of pressure on the melting point of ice (or freezing point of water) Increased pressure lowers the melting point of ice (or the freezing point of water).
This can be shown by passing a piece of wire with heavy weights attached to both ends through a block of ice as shown in Fig.
6.9 below: Freezing above wire Wire cut through ice Ice block Wire Weight Fig.
6.9: Effect of pressure on melting point The piece of wire cuts through the block of ice but the block remains solid behind the wire.
The ice directly below the wire melts because the increased pressure lowers the freezing point.
The wire passes through the ice.
Above the wire, decreased pressure raises the freezing point of the melted ice and the water freezes again.
The above process is known as regelation.
iii.
Effect of impurities on the boiling point of a substance Impurities raise the boiling point of a pure solvent.
Thus, the boiling point of a solution of salt in water is higher than that of pure water.
iv.
Effect of impurities on the melting point of a substance The melting point of a pure solid is lowered by the presence of impurities.
For instance, a freezing mixture of ice and salt has a lower 327PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS temperature than 00C, the freezing point of pure water (or melting point of ice) 3.6 Evaporation and Boiling 3.6.1 Concept of evaporation You are familiar with the concept of evaporation.
You know that evaporation is the change of liquid to vapour without the application of heat to the liquid.
It is a slow and quiet process which takes place at all temperatures.
This phenomenon can often be seen in our daily lives.
For instance; i. when a piece of wet cloth is spread out in the open during harmattan, it dries up quickly; ii.
liquids left in shallow open containers soon disappear; iii.
when some liquid perfume is poured into a cup and left uncovered, the cup is found to be empty after few hours.
3.6.2 Factors that affect the rate of evaporation Can you guess the factors that affect the rate of evaporation?
Compare your answers with these factors that affect the rate of evaporation.
They are: i.
Temperature – Evaporation is more rapid if the surrounding temperature is higher.
This is because the process of evaporation involves absorbing the latent heat of vaporization from the surroundings.
The warmer the surroundings, the more the amount of heat supplied by it to provide the latent heat of vaporization.
ii.
Pressure – The greater the pressure, the slower the evaporation and vice versa.
If an open container of water is placed inside a bell-jar from which air has been pumped out (reduced pressure), evaporation takes place at faster rate.
iii.
Area of liquid surface exposed – The greater the surface area of liquid exposed, the more rapid will be the evaporation.
iv.
Dryness of the air – The drier the air (i.e the less water vapour it contains) the quicker the evaporation.
Water droplets on a watch- glass evaporate faster if left in the open than when covered with a bell jar.
As the water evaporates, the air in the bell jar gets filled with water vapour and this slows down the evaporation.
In the 328PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS case of the watch glass in the open, the water vapour quickly escapes into the open air and more evaporation takes place.
This is the reason why wet clothes dry faster in dry weather than in wet weather.
v. Motion of the Air – Wet clothes placed in the draft from a fan will dry up sooner than if placed in still air.
The air stream or wind removes the vapour and brings fresh and drier air into contact with the liquid.
Hence, evaporation is more rapid.
vi.
Nature of the Liquid – Different liquids evaporate at different rates.
The lower the boiling point of a liquid, the greater will be the rate of evaporation.
For example, mercury with a boiling point of 3570C hardly evaporates while either (boiling point 350C) evaporates very rapidly.
Liquids like ether which evaporates rapidly are called volatile liquids.
3.6.3 Concept of boiling Boiling occurs when a substance in the liquid state is thrown into violent agitation as a result of continuous supply of heat to the liquid molecules.
3.6.4 Evaporation and boiling Whether a liquid changes rapidly into its gaseous state by boiling or by slow evaporation, it requires the same amount of latent heat to do so.
In the case of boiling, this heat is supplied by the heat source.
In the case of evaporation where there is no particular heat source, the liquid obtains its latent heat of vaporization from the surroundings.
329PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Evaporation Boiling i This is the change from liquid to This is the change from vapour state at temperature below liquid to vapour state at the normal boiling point boiling point of the liquid.
ii Evaporation takes place at all Boiling takes place at a fixed temperatures temperature for a particular liquid.
iii.
It occurs when molecules escape It takes place throughout the from the surface of a liquid volume of the liquid iv.
It is influenced by pressure, It is influenced by pressure and temperature, dryness of the the amount of impurities atmosphere, wind and amount of present in the liquid exposed area of the liquid v. It takes place slowly and proceeds It occurs at a constant rate for more rapidly as the temperature a particular temperature increases.
vi.
It is a silent phenomenon It is a noisy phenomenon vii.
It causes cooling It does not cause cooling 3.7 Vapour and Vapour Pressure 3.7.1 Concept of Vapour As you know a liquid changes into vapour if sufficient heat energy is supplied to it.
The change from liquid to vapour takes place throughout the entire liquid at a particular temperature.
3.7.2 Concept of Vapour pressure If a liquid is allowed to evaporate in a closed container, the vapour formed will exert a certain pressure.
This is known as vapour pressure.
3.7.3 Saturated and unsaturated vapour i.
Saturated vapour – A saturated vapour is one that is in contact with its own liquid in a closed space.
The pressure exerted by such a vapour is the saturated vapour pressure (S.V.P).
330PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The saturated vapour pressure varies with temperature as shown in Fig.
6.10.
S.V.P Fig.
6.10: Saturated vapour pressure (S.V.P) vs temperature The saturated vapour pressure of water is approximately equal to the external pressure when water boils.
It does not obey the gas laws.
100oC ii.
Unsaturated vapour – An unsaturated vapour is one that is not in contact with its own liquid in a closed space.
The gas laws are approximately obeyed in such a vapour.
According to the kinetic theory, the number of molecules leaving the liquid during evaporation is greater than those returning to the liquid in an unsaturated vapour.
On the other hand, there is equal number of molecules leaving and returning to the liquid in a saturated vapour.
At higher temperatures, the energy of the molecules increases and more molecules are then able to leave the liquid and the saturated vapour pressure will thus increase.
3.8 Concept of Sublimation This is a process whereby some solid substances when heated, change directly into gaseous state without the intermediate liquid state.
For example, solid iodine and solid carbon dioxide changes from solid state to gaseous state without changing to the intermediate liquid state.
331PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.9 The Working Principle of Some Common Devices You have seen that whenever liquid is converted into vapour, heat is absorbed from the liquid or any object in contact with it.
This heat is the latent heat used in causing the transformation from liquid to vapour.
The absorption of the latent heat from the liquid brings about a fall in its temperature.
The faster the evaporation, the greater is the fall in temperature.
This phenomenon is utilized in the working principle of these common household devices.
i.
The Refrigerator The cooling effect of evaporation is used in a refrigerator.
The volatile liquid used is usually liquid ammonia or Freon.
Ammonia evaporates inside coiled copper tubes surrounding the freezing compartment, assisted by a pump which reduces the pressure.
As it evaporates in these coils, the ammonia absorbs heat from the surrounding air, thus cooling the inside of the refrigerator and its contents.
The vapour produced is pumped away and expressed in a condenser where it condenses to liquid ammonia.
The heat released during this condensation is quickly dissipated by an arrangement of cooling fans at the back of the refrigerator.
The liquid is recycled through the evaporator coil (Fig.
6.11).
The process is repeated.
This sets up a continuous circulation of liquid and vapour.
332PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Freezing compartment Vapour Liquid Pump Cooling fins Fig.
6.11: Household electric refrigerator ii.
Control of humidity (Air conditioning) The humidity of an enclosure could be controlled to suit our personal comfort.
The basic principle of the working of an air conditioner is illustrated in Fig.
6.12 below.
Evaporator Cool air moves into the room Warm air in the room Warm air from Fig.
6.12 : Domestic air conditioner outside the room Condenser Hot air 333PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The air conditioner contains a powerful fin which draws air from outside to inside the enclosure (e.g a room, a car).
It first cleans the air by removing dust particles from it.
It further humidifies the air to a specified value (to make it cold) before circulating it within the enclosure.
The humidity value of the circulating air is usually controlled by setting the air conditioner to certain convenient levels.
Air conditioners are generally found in cars, public buildings, offices, ships and so on.
iii.
Pressure Cooker The basic principle of the working of the pressure cooker is based on the fact that increased pressure raises the boiling point of water.
Substances inside a pressure cooker are heated at about a pressure of 2 atmosphere.
Such a high pressure can raise the boiling point of water to about 1200C.
Food items will cook more quickly when subjected to such a high temperature condition inside a pressure cooker (Fig.
6.13) Variable cooling valve Safety valve + Handle Water boils at 120oC Source of heat Fig.
6.13: A pressure cooker Pressure cookers are found very useful by people and explorers in mountainous areas of the world where atmospheric pressure is generally lower than normal, where water can boil at 910C.
This makes cooking to be expensive in terms of time and fuel.
Pressure cookers are usually used to remedy the situation.
334PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.10 Humidity The atmosphere contains varying amounts of water vapour.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere.
i Relative humidity If the air is saturated or nearly saturated with water vapour, it is described as very humid.
If the air is highly unsaturatged it is said to be dry.
Humid weather makes one feel uncomfortable as perspiration does not evaporate easily from the skin into the already unsaturated air.
Also, very dry air evaporates the moisture from the skin too rapidly.
This is harmful to the skin.
A comparison between the amount of moisture actually present in the air with the amount of moisture it can hold when saturated is termed relative humidity.
This is expressed as a ratio which indicates the extent to which air is saturated with water vapour.
Mass of water vapour in a given volume of air Relative Humidity = Mass of water vapour required to saturate the Same volume of air at the same temperature When the atmosphere is fully saturated with water vapour, the relative humidity reaches 1. also, since the pressure exerted by the water vapour is proportional o its mass per unit volume, the relative humidity can also be expressed thus: Pressure of water vapour present in the air Relative Humidity = Saturated vapour pressure at the same air pressure ii Dew point This is defined as the temperature at which water vapour present in the air is just sufficient to saturate it.
It is dependent upon prevalent atmospheric conditions like temperature, wind and the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere.
For instance, when ice blocks are kept inside glass tumbler, moisture would form on the outside surface of the tumbler after sometime.
This is because the cold glass surface cools the air around it to temperature at which the water vapour contained in the air is sufficient to saturate the air.
Saturated vapour pressure at dew point Relative Humidity = Saturated vapour pressure at original Temperature of air 335PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.11 Humidity and Weather The need for effective weather forecasting is becoming very important in all countries of the world.
However, to achieve a good level of accuracy in such weather forecasting, it requires accurate determination of the humidity level of the air.
This job in most cases is left for the meteorologist (specialists in aspects of atmospheric physics).
Their reports concerning humidity and weather are found very useful in scheduling or flights in airports, navigation, radio transmission, factories, food storage, farming etc.
Also, the construction of certain household equipment such as refrigerators, air conditioners and the like require knowledge of how to keep the relative humidity of an enclosure at a specified level.
The formation of clouds, rain, fog, hailstone and snow depends among other things on the relative humidity of the atmosphere.
3.12 Formation of Dew, Mist, Fog and Rain i Formation of dew It is a common experience that in the evening, the ground and the air in contact with it begins to cool as they lose heat through radiation.
A clear sky and still air may cause temperature air to fall even lower so that the air becomes nearly saturated with water vapour.
Furthermore, the surfaces of some objects particularly grass and other plants, give off water vapour, This adds to the amount of vapour in the air.
When compared with the surrounding air, these surfaces are good conductors and lose heat sooner than the air.
As the temperature of the ground and the grass falls below the dew point, the moisture in the surrounding air will condense and be deposited in their surfaces as dew.
If the dew point is below 00C, the vapour changes into the solid form of ice crystals called frost.
ii Formation of mist and fog If the air near the surfaces of the land cools until it reaches dew point, the water vapour begins to condense around tiny dust particles in the atmosphere.
These particles have surfaces on which the condensed vapour collects.
Such a collected of water particles is known as mist.
A thick mist is called a fog.
The water particles of the mist or fog are small enough to float in air.
When they become larger, they fall as rain.
336PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS iii Clouds and rains A thick mist formed high up in the atmosphere is referred to as a cloud.
During the day, the land mass is warm and the warm air containing water vapour rises above the land.
As the air moved upwards, it expands (due to reduced pressure at high altitudes) and becomes cooler.
This cooling process, if continued long enough, causes the air to become saturated and its water vapour eventually condenses to form tiny droplets of water.
When this happens, a cloud begins to form.
The tiny droplets of water combine to form larger drops which fall as rain.
You should note that not all clouds are formed as water droplets.
Some clouds like the fleecy cirrus clouds which form at great heights are composed of ice crystals because the water vapour in the air condenses at a height where the temperature is below freezing point.
Raindrops that are carried by strong convection currents to greater altitudes becomes frozen as they are cooled below 00C by the cold air at such heights.
These frozen raindrops fall as hail.

Also, you will learn how to state, verify and derive the general gas equation for the ideal gas based on the laws.
Finally, you will learn about other laws governing the real gases.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Expansion of Gases We classify substances in the gaseous state as gases or vapours.
You know that a gas has no volume of its own but takes the volume of its containers.
The volume of a gas is changed by varying the pressure of the gas or by changing the temperatures of the gas.
Thus, the pressure, volume and temperature of a gas may change when any one of the quantities change.
Hence, the thermal expansion of a gas is complicated by the fact that the volume can be altered by a change of temperature and of pressure.
For us to study the behaviour of a gas with respect to the three variables: volume, temperature and pressure, we investigate the relation between two of the variables while the third one is kept constant.
341PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.1.1 Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gas and its Assumptions We use the kinetic molecular theory of gases to explain the effect of temperature on the volume and pressure of a gas.
The theory makes the following assumptions.
• A gas is considered to be made up of a large number of molecules acting like elastic spheres.
• The molecules are in a state of constant motion knocking against each other and the walls of the containing vessel.
• The particles exert attractive forces on one another.
• The particles possess kinetic energy due to their motion.
• The volume of the molecules of a gas is negligible compared with the volume of the container.
3.2 Boyle’s Law Here, we will consider the relationship between the pressure and the volume of a fixed mass of a gas given by Boyle’s law in 1660.
3.2.1 Statement of Boyle’s law Boyle’s law states that the pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided that the temperature is kept constant.
In symbols, Boyle’s law is written as P = 1 or PV = constant V Where P = pressure V = Volume of a fixed mass of gas.
3.2.2 Verification of Boyle’s law We can verify Boyle’s law in the laboratory using simple apparatus shown in Fig.
7.1.
342PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Air h cm Closed glass Open glass tube B Tube C Fig.
7.1: Verification of Boyle’s law To do this, we entrap a fixed mass of dry air with mercury is a closed glass tube of uniform cross-section attached by rubber tubing to a mercury reservoir.
The volume V of the dry air is proportional to the length L of the air column because the tube is of uniform cross-sectional area.
The pressure and volume of the dry air are varies by the open limb vertically up or down.
The length which we read from the metre scale is taken as the volume of the gas while the atmospheric pressure (Po) is read from a fortin barometer.
When the mercury surface in B is lower than that in C, the pressure (P) of gas is given by: P = (Po + h) cm Hg But, when the mercury surface in B is higher than that in C, the gas pressure (P) is given by.
P = (Po + h) cm Hg.
By lowering or raising the tube B we would obtain a set of readings of L and h. A table of these readings is then made as shown below in Table 7.1. l cm h (Po ± h)cm 1 cm -1 cm l 343PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The values obtained in an earlier experiment when used in plotting graphs give the following result as shown in Fig.
7.2 • Graph of P against V (ie Po + h against L) gives a curve as shown in Fig.
7.2a.
• Graph of P against 1 (ie Po + h against 1 ) V l is a straight line graph passing through the origin as shown in Fig.
7.2b.
The straight line graph indicates that the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume of air or any gas at constant temperature.

7.2: Graph of Boyle’s law You will take the following precautions when performing this experiment.
• Ensure that the entrapped air is dry by adding a small quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid into the tube before adding mercury.
• Ensure that there is no air bubbles in the mercury.
344PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • Ensure constant temperature by allowing the system to attained the temperature of its surrounding.
You will do this by waiting for a few minutes after each variation of h and L. • Take the readings when the mercury levels are steady and avoid parallax error of the metre rule while reading it.
Worked example The pressure of a fixed mass of gas is 96 cm Hg when the volume of the gas is 5.0 m3.
Find the pressure of the gas when its volume becomes 7.0 m3.
Assume the temperature is constant.
Solution From Boyle’s law PV = constant at constant temperature = P V = P V 1 1 2 2 96 x 5 = P x 7 2 P = 96 x 5 2 7 = 68.57 cm Hg 3.2.3 Use of Kinetic Theory to Explain Boyle’s Law Now, let us consider a given mass of gas at constant temperature.
At this constant temperature, the average velocity of the gas molecules is constant and the number of collisions they make per unit area of the wall of the containing vessel is also constant.
Hence, the gas exerts a certain constant pressure, P, on the walls of the vessel.
If we now double the original volume of the gas, the gas molecules will be spread out and it will take longer time to bombard the walls and hence, fewer impact per second.
As a result, the pressure of the gas will be halved.
Thus, at constant temperature, volume of a gas increases as pressure decreases.
On the other hand, if we halve the original volume of the gas, the gas molecules will be more closely pack and then it will take less time to bombard the walls of the containing vessel.
The gas pressure increases (double) as more impact per second are made.
Hence, at constant temperature, decrease in volume of a gas leads to increase in pressure.
345PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS This means that the pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely with its volume at constant temperature in accordance with Boyle’s law.
This is illustrated diagrammatically in Fig.
7.3 P4 P P 3 P 2 2 3 4 1 1 Fig.
7.3: A representation of Boyle’s law 3.3 Charles’ Law Here we will consider the connection between the change in volume with temperature change of a fixed mass of gas kept at constant pressure published by Charles in 1787 and independently by Gay-Lussac in 1802.
3.3.1 Statement of Charles’ Law Charles’ law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas increases by 1/273 of its volume at 00C per degree Celsius rise in temperature provided its pressure remains constant.
We can also state Charles law using Kelvin temperature scale.
You are aware that a temperature toC on the Celsius scale is related to an absolute or Kelvin temperature T by the equation T (K) = 273 + toC Using the Kelvin scale therefore, Charles’ law can be stated as The volume of a fixed mass of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature if its pressure remains constant.
In symbols, we express Charles’ law as V (cid:181) T ; if pressure is kept constant V = KT Or V = K T (cid:222) V = V 1 2 T T 1 2 where 346PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS V = volume; T = Kelvin temperature; K = a mathematical constant; V = volume of gas at temperature T ; V = volume of gas at 1 1 2 temperature T of gas at constant pressure.
2 3.3.2 Verification of Charles’ Law We can verify Charles’ law in the laboratory using the apparatus shown in Fig.
7.4 below.
S Metre rule Thermometer Capillary tube t A Vair B Heat Fig.
7.4: Investigation of volume - temperature change (constant pressure) To do this verification, we trap a column AB of air by a length of sulphuric acid which dries the air or by a length of mercury in a capillary tube T of uniform diameter.
The capillary tube is sealed at the lower end and is attached to a halt-metre rule S by rubber bands.
The whole arragement is now placed inside a deep vessel filled with enough water to cover most of the tube T as shown.
The water is now warmed with a burner, stirred gently with a thermometer suspended in the vessel of water.
After a suitable temperature rise the temperature t is recorded as well as the length AB of the air colum from the reading as the rule S. The length AB of the air column is proportional to the volume V of the air.
We can obtain more readings of t and V by heating the water further to higher tempratures.
The readings are as shown in Table 7.2.
Table 7.2 : Readings of temperature and the corresponding volume 347PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS t/oC V When values obtained in an earlier experiment were used to plot a graph of volume V against temperature toC, using zero (0oC) on the temperature axis, the resulting graph was as shown in Fig.

10C.
Fig.
7.5 :Volume – temperature change graph (constant pressure) You can see from Fig.
7.5 above that we obtained a straight line graph.
Because we have performed this experiment at constant pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure plus that due to the height of the liquid column, we conclude that the volume of a fixed mass of gas increases linearly as the temperature rises when the pressure is kept constant If you are to perform this experiment, you have to take these precaustions.
• Take temperature when the thermometer reading is steady • Stir the water continuously to ensure even temperature.
• Ensure that the bore of the capillary tube is clean and dry.
• Use only dry air to gas.
• Carry out the experiment slowly to allow heat time to pass through the thick wals of the capillary tube and bring the gas to the same temperature as the water in the vessel.
3.3.3 Cubic Expansivity of a Gas 348PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS You can also use Charles’ law experiment to obtain the value of the cubic expansivity of a gas at constant pressure.
This is defined as: Increase in volume per unit volume at 00C per degree Celsius rise in temperature.
That is, if = cubic expansivity of a gas ૪ V = volume at temperature 00C o V = volume at temperature t oC t Then = vt - vo ૪ Vo x t We have from careful experiments obtained the fraction in the ૪ equation above to be same for all gases and is equal to 1/ .
273 You know the cubic expansivity of a gas unlike that of solids and liquids is the same irrespective of the nature of the gas.
Also, the cubic expansivity of a gas is calculated from the fractional increase of its volume at 00C?
Worked example 1.
A fixed mass of gas is heated at contnat presure from 250C to 80oC.
If the volume at 250C is 150 cm3, what volume will it occupy at 800C.
Solution From Charles’ law V = V 1 2 T T 1 2 V = 150 cm3 ; V = ?
1 2 T = (273 + 25 ) K = 298 K 1 T = ( 273 + 80 ) K = 353K 2 Substituting in the above equation gives us 150 = V 2 349PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 298 353 = V2 = 150 x 353 cm3 298 = 177.
68 cm3 The volume to be occupies by the gas at constant pressure and at 800C is 177.68 cm3.
2.
The volumes of a fixed mass of gas at constnat pressure are 150 cm3 at 00C and 178 cm3 at 800C.
Calculate the cubic expansivity of the gas .
Solution You will recall that the cubic expansivity ( ) of a gas is given by the ૪ equation = Increase in volume from 0 0 C ૪ Volume at 00C x temperature rise That is, R = V - V 1 o V x t o = 178 - 150 150 x 80 = 28 12000 = 2.33 X 10-3 /0C or 2.33 X 10-3/k 3.3.4 Use of Kinetic Molecular Theory to Explain Charles’ Law To do this, let us consider a fixed mass of a gas confirned in a vessel at constant pressure.
Now, if we heat this gas, the molecules acquire more K. E., move faster and collide more often with the walls of the vessel.
As a result, increases the pressure they exert.
For us to maintain a constnat pressure, we then increasae the volume of the containing vessel to allow the same mass of gas to travel a longer distance before striking the walls of the container.
Thus an increase in temperautre leads to an increase in the gas volume.
This is in agreement with Charles’s law.
350PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4 Pressure Law or Gay- Lussac’s Law Here, we will consider the connection between the pressure change with temperature of a fixed mass of gas maintained at constant volume.
This connection was given by Gay-Lussac in 1802 and these are two alternatives of stating the relation (law).
3.4.1 Statement of Pressure Law • We can now state the law in the two alternative ways thus: The law states that the presure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume increase by ½73 of its pressure at 00C for every degress Celsius (or Kelvin) rise in temperature.
We write the above in symbols as Pt = Po 1 + t 273 where Po = pressure at temperature 00C Pt = Pressure at temperature t0C.
The alternative way of stating the pressure law is: • The pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
In symbols, we state the law as P a T Or P = constant T That is, P = P 1 2 T T 1 2 3.4.2 Verification of Pressure Law Fig.
7.6 below shows one of the forms of apparatus we use to verify Pressure law.
It consists of a large bulb F filled with dry air; a mercury manometer with one side BC open to the atmosphere.
This is connected to F by a very narrow tube D. We place the bulbs F inside a large vessel and cover it completely with water as shown in Fig.
7.6.
351PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
7.6: Pressure – temperature change apparatus (constant volume) First, we record the initial temperature t of the gas.
We then raise or lower the open side BC of the manometer until the top of the mercury on the other side reaches the level L. We then read and record the height h of the mercury column above L and the atmospheric pressure A.
We warm the air in the bulb F by heating the water round the bulb and stirring it gently.
At a suitable temperature rise of between 15 to 200C, we take away the burner and raise BC until the mercury level on the other side again reaches L. We then read and record the new difference in levels, h, between B and L; and the temperature t. We repeat these experimental procedures with higher temperature for the air.
In each case, BC is raised until the mercury level on the other side is at L. Thus, maintaining the volume of the air constant.
We read and record the corresponding values of h and t. These readings are as shown in Table 7.3 below.
Table 7.3: Readings of temperature and the corresponding values of h and p t/0C h / mm Hg P ( = A + h or A – h) Using the values from the table, we plot a graph of the pressure P against temperature t at constant value.
If B is above L, p = A + h but if B is below L, P = A – L. 352PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS In an earlier experiment, we obtained a straight line AB which showed that at constant volume, the pressure of a gas varies uniformly or linearly with temperature.
A typical graph of an earlier experiment is shown in Fig.
7.7 below.
* Pressure (P) * B * * * * R* * * * Po P t* Pt Q P o P Z 0 40 temp.
/0C Fig.
7.7: Graph of pressure againt temperature (volume constant) From the result of the above experiment, we can deduce that for all permanent gases and dry air, the pressure increases by about 1/273 of its pressure at 00C for each degree Celsius rise in temperature.
Hence, the pressure expansivity of gases is the same as the volume expansivity.
Therefore, we define the pressure expansivity of the gas as = Increase in pressure from 0 0 C ૪ Pressure at 00C x temperature rise Symbolically, = p - p ૪ t o P x t o or P = P 1 + t t o 273 Worked example The pressure of a car type at 100C is 0.20N /mm2.
What would be the pressure if the temperature rises to 250C.
Solution Recall that from Pressure law, 353PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS P a T at constant volume Therefore, P = T 1 1 P T 2 2 = 0.20 = 273 + 10 = 283 P 273 + 25 298 2 P = 0.20 x 298 = 0.21 N/ mm2 2 283 3.4.3 Use of Kinetic Molecular Theory to Explain Pressure Law Do you remember that heat is a form of energy and that when a gas is heated the molecules gain kinetic energy and move about faster.
As a result, the momentum changes produced by the molecules at the walls per impact is greater.
This also leads to increase in the number of impacts of each molecule per second because of the increase in speed.
Thus, the pressure increases with rise in temperature at content volume.
This is statement of Gay-Lussac’s law or Pressure law.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1 (a) State and describe experiments to verify: (i) Boyle’s law (ii) Charles’s law (iii) Pressure law.
(b) Use kinetic molecule theory to explain the above laws.
2.
Describe as fully as you can the kinetic picture of a gas and show how its accounts for the change in pressure when the temperature of a gas is increased at constant volume.
3.
The pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume increase from 60 cm of mercury at 100C to 95 cm of mercury at 800C.
What would be the pressure of the air at 00C?
4.
A fixed mass of air occupying 500 cm3 at 150C was heated to 850C.
What was its new volume?
3.5 Ideal or the General Gas Law 3.5.1 The General Gas Law or Equation 354PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS From the gas laws we know that the volume of a gas depends on both its temperauture and are pressure.
We can sum up the relationship between these three variable – volume, temperature and pressure to obtain the general gas law.
We have that.
From Boyle’s law, PV = constnat if T is constant from, From Charles’ law, V = constant if P is constant T From the Gay – Lussac’s or pressure law, P = constant at contact volume T We can combine any two of these three equations to obtain the general gas equation.
That is, PV = K T where K is a constant for a fixed mass of gas.
(cid:222) p V = P V 1 1 2 2 T T 1 2 Where P V are the gas pressure and volume at temperature T and P V are 1 1 1 2 2 the gas pressure and volume at temperature T .
2 We can use the general gas equation to find any of the variable in the equation when the other two are known.
For instance, if we know the initial volume of a gas, we can determine the final volume when both its pressure and temprature changes.
That is, V = P V T 2 1 1 2 P T 2 1 You have to note that 355PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • The law does not hold good when a gas is near its liquefying temperature.
• The relationship ‘PV/T = constant’ is a law for an ideal gas.
It assumes that the attraction between the gas molecules and the volume they occupy are both neglible.
But, this is not the case for a real gas.
3.5.2 The Ideal Gas Equation The ideal gas equation relate generally presure, volume and absolute temperature of a fixed mass of gas as we have already discussed in the general gas equation of section 3.5.1 above .
That is, PV = constant T However, for an ideal gas, at standard temperature and pressure, for 1 mole of gas we have PV = RT where R is a constant known as the molar gas constant and its value is 8.31J mol -1 K -1 The above equation is refrred to as the Ideal gas equaton.
It holds true for all gases.
For n moles, however, we have PV = nRT Or PV = nR T The above equation is the general form and is called the equation of states of an ideal gas.
3.6 Conversion to Standard Temperature and Pressure (S.T.P) You have seen that the volumes of gases changes remarkely with changes in temperature and pressure.
For this reason, it is not easy to compare result of experiments between countrie or towns across the world having temperate and tropical climates.
This observation made scientist to choose 00C or 273K and 760 mm Hg or 1.01 x 105 Nm-2 to be the standard temperature and pressure (s. t. p. ) at which gas volumes are 356PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS given.
This makes it easy and possible for us to compare volumes of different masses of a gas.
3.7 Intermolecular Energy and Forces We know from common experience that forces exist between molecules.
These intermolecular forces arise from two main causes:the potential energy (interactions with surrounding molecules and is electrical in nature) and thermal energy (the kinetic energy which depends on the temperature of the substance concerned) of the molecules.
The intermoleular forces between molecules decrease rapidly as the distance between molecules increases.
Thus for small distances between molecules (solid or liquid) the intermolecular forces are repulsive and increases rapidly as the separation is reduced.
The forces between molecules vary in the form shown in Fig.
7.8 below .
/I/*t shows the variation of the potential energy V between two molecules at a distance r apart.
V+ A F = - dV dt Repulsive r < r Attractive o r > r o Equilibrium M R = rRepulsive O o r < r B r o o D C G X Y Fig.
7.8 : Molecular potential energy and force At the point B, the intermolecular energy is zero.
For distances shorter than OB, the force is negative.
Along the part AB, the P.E is positive.
The force between the molecules is always given by F = -dv/dr = - potentital gradient.
At distances greater than OB, the force is attractive.
It increases with distance, reaches a maximum and then decrease rapidly.
Along CD, the force is attractive and it decreases with distance r according to an inverse – power of r. Along ABC, the force is repulsive.
This variation of F with r is illustrated in figure 7.8.
At C, the 357PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS minimum P.E point of the curve, the molecules are at their normal distance apart in the absence of thermal energy.
At this equilibrium distance, the attractive and repulsive forces balance each other.
If the molecules are closer ( r < ro), they repel each other.
If they are further apart (r > ro), they attract each other.
For gases molecules, the molecules are far apart that the intermolecular attractions are small.
As the molecules are brought closer by compressing the gas, the force of attraction increases, passes through the maximum and then decreases to zero at B where it exists in liquid phase.
Small cohesive force exist in gases.
The intermolecular attraction between molecules of liquids is larger than that of gaes because they are closer together.
This makes liquid to have definite volume and higher cohesion than gases.
The intermolecular forces between solid molecules are very strong and are much more than that of liquids and gases.
This makes them to have definite shape their atoms and molecules have definite pattern or lattice.
Thus, solids are less compressible than liquids.
3.8 Pressure Calculations Here, suppose a cubical box of side 1 contains N molecules of gas each of mass M. A typical molecule of this gas will have a velocity C at any instant with components of U, V and w respectively in the direction of the three perpendicular axes 0 , 0 , 0 as shown in Fig.
7.9. x y z Hence C2 = U2 + V2 + W2.
Z w c L v u + L O X L Fig.
7.9 :Calculation of gas pressure Suppose a molecule of the gas in this box moves and collide with the box on the face x due to the component of the velocity u.
358PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Momentum before impact = mu Momentum after impact = -mu Therefore, momentum change on impact = mu - ( - mu ) = -2 mu Time taken for the molecule to move across the cube to the opposite face and back to x is 2l/u Therefore Momentum change per second momentum change = time 2mu mu 2 = = 21/u l force on x mu 2 = l You know that Pressure on x = force area This implies that pressure on x = force mu 2 mu 2 …….
(i) = = area l x l2 l3 For N molecules in the cube, in the x direciton we have P = mu 2 + mu 2 + mu 2 + ……………+ mu 2 N 1 2 3 l3 l3 l3 l3 P = m ( u + u 2 + u 2 + ……….+ u2 ) ……(ii) 1 2 3 N l3 where U 2, U 2, u 2 …….U2 are components of velocity of various magnitudes 1 2 3 N in the OX direction.
If U2 represents the average or mean value of all the squares of the velocity components in nthe OX direction, that is, U 2 = u 2 + u 2 + u 2 + ………+ u 2 1 2 3 N Which implies that 359PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS N u 2 = u 2 + u 2 + u 2 +………u 2 1 2 3 N N Then equation (ii) becomes P = N mu 2 ………………….
(iii) l3 Now, if we consider a larger mumber of molecules of varying speed in randon motion, the mean square of the component speed in any of the three axes is the same.
That is 2 = 2 = 2 U V w For each molecule, however C2 = u2 + v2 + w2 Thus, the mean square C-2 is given by 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 C U V w Therefore 2 = 2 U 1/3 C From equation (iii) 2 P = 1 NmC 3 l3 The number of molecules per unit volume n = N/l3 Hence, P = 1/3 nmC-2 ………………..(i) where n is in molecules per metre3, m in kilogram and c in metre per second.
Unit of pressure: newton per metre2 (Nm-2) 3.9 Introduction of Temperature We can move a step further by considering the volume of gas containing N molecules.
The number of molecules per unit volume is n = N or n = N V l3 Thus, the pressure of a gas from equ (1) becomes 2 2 P = 1/3 nmC = 1 N mc 3 V Therefore 2 …………………….
(2) PV = 1/3 NmC Equation (2) is similar to the equation combining Boyle’s law and Charles’ law PV = RT 360PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS We can by making kinetic theory consistent with the observed behaviour of a gas, write 1/3 N mc-2 = RT ……………….
(3) Here, we assume that the mean square speed of the molecules 2 is C proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
The kinetic energy of a molecule moving with a speed c is ½ MC2.
Thus, the kinetic energy of translation of the random motion of the molecule of a gas is ½ mc2.
Relating ½ mc2 to the temperation enables us to put eqn (3) in the form RT = 1/3 N mc2 = 2N (1/2 mc-2) 3 where ½ mc2 = 3 R T…………(4) 2 N Thus, the average kinetic energy of translation of a molecule is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
We note that the ratio R/N is a universal constant .
R is the gas constant .while N is the number of molecule.
R = K N where k is the gas constant per molecule and also universal constant called Boltzmann’s constant.
Substituting K in eqn.
(4) gives us ½ Mc2 = 3KT ……………………..(5) 2 Boltzmann’s constant relates energy to temperature and is usually given in joules per degree.
K = ½ mc 2 3 T 2 The value of k is 1.38 x 10-23 Jk -1.
3.10 Deductions from the Ideal Gas Equation.
361PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS i Determination of the value of root mean square (r ms ) speed ( (cid:214) C2 ) You will recall from equation (1) that P = 1/3 nm 2 …………….
(i) C where n = number of molecules per unit volume ( N/V).
Nm = total mass M of the gas per volume Substituting the above in equ (i) gives us p = 1/ m 2 …………………(6) 3 C V You know that density ρ is mass per unit volume.
Therefore, when we substitute ρ for m/v in eqn (6) we have P = 1/ e C-2 ………………….
(7) 3 Or p = 1 2 C ρ 3 which gives us C-2 = 3p …………..(8) ρ The square root of 2 is called the root – mean – square speed.
C That is C-2 = 3p ρ But p = RT V Hence root-mean –square (rms) speed 2 = 3RT …………………(9) C M Since ρ = m/v and v = 1 unit volume To find the value of the root-mean-square.
2, we subatitute C 362PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS known values of ρ and p for hydrogen at STP.
At STP ρ for hydrogen = 0.09 kgm-3 P = g ρ H Where g = acceleration due to gravity 9.81 ms-2 ρ = density of mercury = 13600 kgm3 H = barometer height = 760 mm = 0.76 m Substituting the above in eqn (8) gives us 2 = 3p = 3 x g ρ H C ρ ρ of hydrogen 3 x 9.81 x 13600 x 0.76 = 0.09 = 304188.
48 0.09 = 3.37 x 106 m2S-2 Therefore, the root mean square, C 2 is C 2 = 3.37 x 106 = 1838.

He carried out an experiment to investigate this relationship and the result of his investigtion is commonly referred to as Graham’s law of diffusion.
Graham’s law of diffusion states that at constant temperature and pressure the rate of diffusion of a gas through porous material is inversely proportional to the square root of its density.
363PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS In symbols, 1 Rate of diffusion a ρ iii Avogadro’s law Avogadro (1776 – 1856), an Italian professor put forward a hypothesis that illuminated Chemistry as Newton illuminated mechanics.
This hypothesis he puts forward was accepted in the middle of 19th century anad is now known as the Avogadro’s law.
Avogadro’s law states that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contained equal number of molecules.
We recognize 1cm3 of gas at STP as containing 2.6 x 1019 molecules.
Avogadro,s law enables comparison of gas masses by chemical methods.
iv Daltons’ Law of Partial Pressure According to Dalton in 1801, the total pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures which each individual gas would exert if it were confined alone in the volume occupied by the mixture.
This statement first credited to Dalton is generally referred to as Dalton’s law of Partial Pressure.
The law states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of the individual gases assuming each gas occupies the volume of the mixture at the same temperature.
We express the law mathematically as P = P + P + P ………….P total A B C z where total = total pressure of the mixture and P , P , P ……..p are the A B c z partial pressures exerted separately by the individual gases A, B, C, …………Z that make up the mixture.
v Maxwell’s Distribution Law 364PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS You are aware that the speed of individual molecules vary over a wide range of magnitude.
Therefore, there is a characteristic distribution of moleculsr speeds for a given gas which depends on the temperature.
Even gases which have the same initial molecular speed v later change their speeds because of collisions.
Many of these molecules do not have speeds near zero.
(ie << Vrms) or much more than Vrms (>> rms).
Because these extreme speeds require an unlikely sequence of preferential collisions.
C Maxwell solved this problem of distribution of speeds in a large number of molecules of a gas in his law – Maxwell’s Distribution law Maxwell’s molecular speed ditribution law states that for a sample of gas containing N molcules, that N = 4p N (m/ 2 p KT ) 3/2 V2 e –mv2kT V Where N (v)dv is the number of molcules in the gas sample having speeds between v and v + dv.
That is N = (cid:242) ¥ N (v) dv o Unit molecules / ( cm/s) T is the absolute temperature, k is boltmann’s constant and m is the mass of a molecule.
For a given gas, the speed distribution depends only on temperature.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Concept of Light Light (optics) is a form of energy which causes the sensation of vision.
This energy association with light is known as luminous energy and it is the energy which causes the sensation of vision when it falls on our eyes.
3.1.1 Nature of light As you know, there are two views about the nature of light namely; (i) Light as particle (Corpuscular theory); (ii) Light as matters (Wave theory); According to the corpuscular theory light consists of a stream of minute weightless particles given off by the source.
On the basis of this theory, interference and diffraction of light cannot be explained while the photoelectric effect could be explained satisfactorily by assuming that light exists in discrete particles known as photons.
On the other hand, the wave theory considered light as a form of disturbance spreading out from its source.
On the basis of this theory, the phenomena of interference and diffraction of light could be satisfactorily explained while that of the photoelectric effect cannot be explained by it.
On the basis of these experimental observations, we accept that light sometimes behaves like waves and at others times likes particles.
Thus the wave properties of light are used to explain phenomenon such as interference and diffraction while the particle nature of light is used to explain the photoelectric effect.
Hence, we speak of the wave – particle 371PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS duality of light.
These two aspects of light (wave and particle) cannot be observed in a single experiment.
In recent times, however, the wave nature of light has been accepted as a better option.
In this regard, light is perceived to consist of waves – like packets of energy called photons with a traveling speed of 3 x 108 ms-1 3.1.2 Sources of Light Visible light is a form of energy which our eyes can detect.
Visible light is divided into two sources namely the luminous sources and the non- luminous sources.
(i) Luminous sources: These are light sources that generate and emit light by themselves (give out light of their own).
Examples are the sun, stars, electric lamp, burning flames, TV screen, fire – flies, some deep – sea fishes and other artificial light sources.
The light they produce enter our eyes.
(ii) Non - luminous sources: These are light sources that do not give out light on their own.
They depend on the natural or artificial light sources to illuminate them.
They reflect light from luminous objects for them to be seen.
Examples include moon, wood, pages of book, road sign.
Luminous sources illuminate them and make them appear luminous.
3.1.3 Properties of Light When light strikes an object, it may be, depending on the nature of the material: (i) Reflected, absorbed or transmitted; (ii) Partly absorbed, party reflected or partly transmitted.
3.1.4 Transmission of Light Opaque materials – They partly absorb and partly reflect light energy but do not transmit light at the surface.
Examples are wood, brick wall or a sheet of cardboard.
Transparent Objects – They transmits most of the light energy falling on it such that the object can be seen.
It reflects and absorbs very little.
Examples are glass and clear water.
372PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Translucent Object – They allow light to energy to pass through them in such a way that the object cannot be seen.
Examples include glass sheet used for certain windows and waxed sheet.
3.1.5 Rays and Beams of Light The direction or path along which light energy travels is called a light ray.
They are indicated in diagrams by thin lines with arrow heads which indicate the direction of travel of the light.
A collection of rays is called a beam.
There are three types of beams namely: (i) Parallel beams – A parallel beam is one in which the rays of light are parallel to one another.
Examples of parallel rays are rays from search light.
(ii) Convergent beam – A convergent beam is one in which all the rays of light converge or meet at a point.
Convergent beam can be produced using hand lens.
(iii) Divergent Beam – A divergent beam is one in which all the rays of light come from a point and spread out or diverge from that source.
Lights from lamps are examples of divergent beam.
(i) parallel beam (ii) convergent beam (iii) divergent beam Fig.
1.1: Rectilinear propagation of light 3.2 Rectilinear Propagation of Light You know that rectilinear propagation of light simply means that light travels mainly in a straight line.
This is illustrated in Fig.
1.1.
Eye (a) Candle light can be seen by the eye 373PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Eye (b) Candle light cannot be seen by the eye Fig.
1.2: Rectilinear propagation of light Two natural effects result from the rectilinear propagation of light.
These are the formulation of shadows and eclipses.
Also, the principle of operation of the pin – hook camera depends on the fact that light travels in straight lines.
3.2.1 Shadows A shadow is an area in which light rays from a source cannot reach.
It occurs because light travels in a straight line.
Shadows are produced by the obstruction of light by an opaque object.
For instance, when light rays arrives at an opaque obstacle (one that absorbs Light), the rays just graze the edges of the obstacle and produce the outline of a shadow.
The kind of shadow obtained depends on the size of the luminous object (source of light) sending out the rays.
374PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.3 Shows how shadows are formed Umbra Small source -ray –box lamp Fig.
1.3: Shadows (a) small source (b) Large source In Fig.
1.3 a, we used a small light source (point source) of light to produce a sharp shadow of an opaque solid ball B on a screen placed behind B.
The shadow is uniformly dark.
When the lamp is replaced by a large source such as a pearl lamp P the shadow produced is no longer uniformly dark.
This is illustrated in Fig.
1.3b.
Light does not reach the region of full darkness (umbra), the inner most shadow region.
The edge of the umbra corresponds to the rays NM and OP which graced B at the edge.
As we move away from the edge the darkness diminishes in intensity.
Here also, there is an outer light or grey area known as the penumbra or partial shadow.
In this region, the light is partially blocked by the opaque object.
At point in the screen, the ray PQX indicates that X receives light from small part NP of the pearl lamp while point Y receives light from another small part OQ.
This is indicated by the ray QRY.
Thus the regions X and Z are in partial shadow (penumbra) as shown by the grazing rays OMS and NRZ.
Other points above S and R on the screen are illuminated by the whole of the lamp and as such no shadow is obtained there.
375PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.2.2 Eclipses Do you know that an eclipse is formed as a result of the shadow cast by one heavenly body on another?
That is, the eclipse of the sun and of the moon are direct result of the formation of shadows caused by the revolution of the Earth round the Sun.
As we have earlier discussed, the sun is a luminous object while the Moon and the Earth are both non- luminous objects.
At certain times during these movements, the three bodies will lie in a straight line.
This results in the formation of shadows.
(i) Eclipse of the Sun An eclipse of the sun occurs when the Moon, an opaque body, comes between the Sun and the Earth.
This is illustrated in Fig.
1.4. c b a d e (a) (b) Fig.
1.4: Eclipse of the sun At this instance, the shadows of the Moon will be cast on the Earth’s surface.
People living in the part of the Earth directly in the Moon’s shadows are cut off from the Sun’s view.
They are in the Umbra region of the Moon’s shadow.
This experience, for those at the Umbra (Total darkness) region of the Moon’s shadow is called an Eclipse of the Sun or Solar Eclipse and it lasts for just a few minutes.
Those living at the penumbra (partial darkness) regions of the Moon’s shadow experience partial Eclipse because at these regions, the sun is only partially covered.
The appearance of the sun from various parts of the Earth is illustrated in Fig.
1.4b.
376PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS A person at a, as shown in Fig.
1.4a, sees a total Eclipse, another at b and d sees a partial Eclipse while another at c or e sees no eclipse.
Annular Eclipse On some occasions, the Earth and the Moon may be in positions such that the rays at the moon’s edge intersect before reaching the Earth (Fig.
1.5), thus forming an annular eclipse.
a a Moon a Anmilar eclipse Fig.
1.5.: Annular eclipse That is, a ring of light is formed around the shadow of the moon.
An observer in a position a of the Earth would experience the annular eclipse as a ring of light round the moon.
(ii) Eclipse of the Moon An Eclipse of the moon occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the moon.
This is illustrated in Fig.
1.6.
Fig.
1.6: Eclipse of the moon The Earth, being an opaque body, casts a shadow on the moon.
That is, the Moon is in the Earth’s shadow.
This leads to the formation of the Eclipse of the Moon or Lunar Eclipse just like the Solar Eclipse, Lunar eclipse can be total or partial.
Also, since the Moon’s orbit round the Earth does not lie in the same plane as that of the Earth’s orbit round the 377PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Sun, partial Eclipses of the Moon do not occur every time the Moon and the Sun are on the opposite sides of the Earth.
3.2.3 The Pinhole Camera Are you aware that the pinhole camera is the earliest camera?
It makes use of the fact that light travels in straight lines.
This camera consists of a light proof box, one end of which has a small hole made with a pin or needle point.
The opposite end has a screen made of tracing paper or ground glass.
Light from an object in front of the pinhole passes through it and forms an image on the screen.
If the screen is replaced with a photographic paper or film, a picture of an object can be taken.
You can make a simple pinhole camera by removing the cover from a closed box such as the cardboard boxes used for packing sugar cubes or bournvita tin.
Remove one face of it and replace it with either semi- transparent or translucent paper to serve as screen thereby sealing it again from outside light.
Make a pinhole at the centre of the face of the box (tin) opposite the screen (semi-transparent or translucent paper).
Paint the inside of the box (tin) black so as to absorb stray light due to reflection in order not to fall on the screen.
Fig.
1.7 represents a simple pinhole camera and how it forms images.
Fig.
1.7: Pinhole camera and images formed In Fig.
1.7, OB represents the object in front of the camera.
Light enters through the pinhole P and an inverted image IM is formed on the screen.
If the hole is very small, the image will be very sharp, clear, but dim due to limited amount of light passing through it.
On the other hand, if the whole is large, the image will be bright but blurred.
378PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS If the screen is replaced by a photographic film or plate, the pinhole camera can then be used to take photograph of still objects but it requires a long time of exposure to enable the image to be developed on the film or plate.
In recent times, however, converging lens of appropriate local length is used to bring all rays from many pinholes or wide hole on an object to a single image by bringing all rays from a point on an object to a single point image on the screen even when the rays are incident on different parts of the lens.
This gives rise to a sharp image of the object on the screen.
Linear magnification produced by the pinhole camera Definition Magnification is the ratio of the size (or height) of the image to the size (or height) of the object.
You can compare the size of an object and its image by using the ratio: Size of image =Linear magnification Size of object Or Height of the image = Linear magnification Height of the object Or Distance of the image from pinhole = Linear magnification Distance of the object from pinhole Or Length of camera = Linear magnification Distance of object from pinhole Symbolically, M = h = v i h u o Where M = linear magnification h = height of the image i h = height of the object o v = perpendicular distance of the image to the pinhole u = perpendicular distance of the object to the pinhole 379PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.3 Numerical Examples (i) The height of an object placed at a distance of 30 cm from the hole of a pinhole camera is 20 cm.
If the length of the camera is 15 cm, calculate the magnification produced by the camera and the height of the image.
Solution Magnification = length of camera distance of object from pinhole = height of image (h) i height of object (h ) o Length of camera =15 cm Distance of object from pinhole = 30 cm Height of image = h = h i i Height of object = h = 20 cm o (cid:222) Magnification = 15 = 1 = 0.5 30 2 Also M = h = h i i h 20 cm o i.e 1 = hi 2 20 (cid:222) 2h = 20 i h = 20 = 10 cm i 2 (ii) The distance between the pinhole and the screen is 8 cm, calculate the minimum distance from the pinhole of a body 2.0 m tall.
If a full length picture of him is required on a photographic plate of length 25.0 cm.
Solution Magnification (m) = height of the image (h) i Height of the object (h ) o = distance of the Image from pinhole (v) distance of the object from pinhole (u) 380PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Image distance v = 8cm Object distance u = ?
Image height h = 25 cm i Object height h = 2.0 m = 200 cm o Magnification = h = v i h u o (cid:222) h v i h u o 25 cm = 8 cm 200 cm u 25u = 200x 8 u = 200 x 8 = 64 cm 25 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 (1) List at least five light sources you come across in your immediate environment.
(2) With the aid of diagrams explain how total and partial eclipse of: (i) the Sun (ii) the Moon are formed (3) Construct a simple pinhole camera using improvised box or closed can.
Use the camera to focus on a named object and answer the following questions.
(i) Is the image of the object erect?
(ii) How sharp is the image?
(iii) It is observed that the pinhole camera is not generally used in taking photographs of objects.
Why?
(4) An object stands 15 m away from a pinhole camera which is 10 cm long if the height of the object is 25 m, what is the height of its image?
3.4Reflection of Light at Plane Surfaces Earlier in this unit, you have learned that we see non-luminous objects because of the light they reflect.
As you know, the light originates from some luminous object such as the Sun, an electric lamp or other 381PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS luminous sources.
When light rays fall on the surfaced of an object, it is absorbed, transmitted or reflected.
Sometimes, however, a combination of the above processes may occur.
When light strikes on a surface, the way it is reflected depends on the nature of the surface.
There are two types of reflections namely Regular and Diffused reflection resulting from two types of surfaces namely smooth or polished surface and rough or irregular surfaces.
The two types of reflection are illustrated in Fig.
1.8 below.
Incident ray of Incident light Plane mirror Rays of light Paper (rough surface) (smooth surface) Diffusely reflected rays Reflected rays of light of light (a) Regular reflection (b) Diffused reflection Fig.
1.8: Regular and diffused reflection Regular Reflection When parallel beam of light strikes smooth or polished surfaces such as plane mirror, the rays are reflected parallel to one another in one definite direction from the point where they strike the surface as a result of the nature of the surface.
This is termed Regular Reflection (Fig.1.8a).
Diffused Reflection When parallel beam of light strikes rough surfaces such as paper, person’s face or clothing materials, the rays are scattered because of the lack of smoothness or grain of the surface.
Parallel rays of light incident on such Surfaces are reflected in different directions.
This reflection is termed scattered, irregular or diffused reflection (Fig.
1.8b).
3.5Laws of reflection There are two laws of reflection at plane surfaces.
These are: (i) The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
(ii) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
382PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The laws are illustrated in Fig.
1.9 Angle of Plane mirror Incident ray Incidence Normal i Point of r incident Reflected ray Angle of reflection Fig.1.9: Laws of reflection Plane mirror surfaces consist of plane glasses silvered at the back-Light rays are reflected at the silvery at the back by preventing light rays that strikes the glass from passing through the glass.
Plane mirrors are used in investing the laws of reflection in school laboratories.
(xiii) Verification of the first law of reflection The apparatus is set up as shown in Fig.
1.10.
Fig.
1.10: Verification of the first law of reflection Direct the incident ray from a light source (ray box or candle light) to traverse along the surface or the plane of the board.
You will observe that it is only when the incident ray is visible on the board that the reflected ray will also be distinctly visible on the board.
This shows that the incident and reflected rays are in the same plane.
Since the mirror is placed perpendicular to the board, the normal to the mirror also lies in the same plane as the incident and reflected rays.
(xiv) Verification of the Second Law of Reflection 383PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Using Optical pins Fix a sheet of paper firmly on a drawing board.
Mount a plane mirror vertically along a line AB on the paper and support it with plasticine or wooden block (Fig.
1.11a).
Eye Fig.
1.11a: Verification of the second law of reflection using optical pins Draw a normal ON.
That is a line ON perpendicular to the mirror at N to biset AB at right angles.
Draw lines (one at a time) on the paper making angles such as 200, 300, 400, 600 and 700 to O N. Fix two pins P and Q in front of the mirror along the first line making angle 200 to ON (see Fig.
1.11a).
Use two other pins RS to fix at points in front of the mirror where the eye sees them in line with the images P1 and Q1 of P and Q in the mirror.
The line PQ represents the reflected ray.
Remove the pins and produce lines PQ and RS to meet at a point N on AB measure the angle of incidence ί (the angle between the incident ray and the normal) and the angle of reflection r (the angle between the reflected ray and the normal).
Repeat the experiment for angles 300, 400, 600, and 700, measure and record the angles of incidence ί and the corresponding angles off reflection r in each case.
Tabulate your result.
You will observe that each set of angles, angle of incidence ί and the corresponding angle of reflection r, are always equal.
- Using a Ray Box set up the apparent as before (Fig.1.11a) 384PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.11b: Verification of the second law of reflection using a ray box Place a ray box in such a way that a single ray follows the drawn line for angle 200, line AN.
Mark the reflected ray BN with two dots.
Use the edge of the incident ray and the corresponding edge of the reflected ray if the ray is thick to obtain accurate result.
Draw other lines for angles 300, 400, 600 and 700 in turn, using the ray box, direct the ray (incident ray) along the drawn lines and mark each reflected ray direction as you did for angle 200.
Measure and record the angles of incidence l and the corresponding angles of reflection γ. tabulate your readings.
You will also observe here that in all cases, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection r. Note that the angles of incidence and reflection are always measured from the normal ON (perpendicular) to the mirror.
3.5.1 The Principles of Reversibility of Light You must have observed in the experimental verification that a light ray directed to wards a mirror say AN will be reflected along BN in accordance with the laws of reflection of light.
This observation is illustrated in Fig.
1.12.
If light ray is incident along BN, it will emerge along AN after reflection.
385PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
1.12: Principle of reversibility of light Thus, the path of the light ray is seen to be reversible.
This observation is a general principle in optics and is known as the principle of reversibility of light.
Definition The principle states that the path of light ray is reversible It therefore follows that if a person standing at point A can see the image of an person standing at point B, the person at point B, can likewise see the image of the person at A.
3.6 Formation of Images at Plane Mirror Surfaces If you look at the front of a plane mirror, you will see the image of yourself.
Your image appears to be behind the mirror but it is not actually there, it cannot be caught in a screen.
Now consider a situation where a candle light is placed in front of a plane mirror to serve as an object (Fig.
1.13).
Fig.
1.13: Image of an object O observed in a plane mirror 386PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The upright image of the candle light appears to an observer as if it is located at I behind the mirror from which the light rays enter the eye.
This observation can be explained thus: Two incident rays OA and OC from the tip O, of the candle light strike the plane mirror at A and C and are reflected as AB and CD respectively in accordance to the laws of reflection.
After reflection, the rays appear to the observer’s eye as if the rays are coming from the tip of the image I of the candle light in the mirror.
You can see that I is the point of intersection of the two reflected rays produced backwards.
Also a ray ON normal to the mirror is reflected back along NO.
This ray meets the other two rays at I when produced backward and the distance ON is equal to NI.
Actually, no rays come from I because AB and CD are diverging from each other according to the laws of reflection.
The image of the candle light in the mirror is said to be a virtual image and cannot be received on a screen.
• An image is a picture of an object formed by a reflecting surface.
• A real image can be received on a screen.
• It is produced by actual intersection of rays of light.
• A virtual image cannot be received on a screen it is produced by apparent intersection of rays of light.
3.7 Locating Images in Plane Mirrors 3.7.1 Method I The image of an object O such as a pin in a plane mirror M can be located as described below: (i) Mount a plane mirror on a flat board and erect an optical pin O in front of the mirror.
View the image of the object pin O in the mirror (Fig.
1.14) Erect two other pins A and B in line with the image I of the pin observed in the mirror.
Repeat with two more pins in a different position such as C and D. After taking the pins away, produce the lines AB and CD until they intersect.
This point of intersection behind the mirror is the position of the image I.
Measure the distances ON and IN.
You would see that ON is equal to IN 387PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS I image N D A O C Object B Fig.
1.14: Locating images in plane mirrors 3.7.2 Method II It is also possible to locate the image position by the no – parallax 1 method.
You can do this by using two optical pins P , and P mounted 1 2 on a cork as shown in Fig.
1.15.
Search pin P image 2 P 1 Object Fig.
1.15: No parallax method 3.7.3 Image of Large Object –Lateral Inversion The image of large object is drawn by taking one point after another on the object and locating its corresponding image using either method I or Method II above.
Lateral Inversion This is the effect of plane mirror on large objects placed in front of it.
The image appears like a reversal of the object (Fig.
1.16).
388PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS B A Mirror AB Fig.
1.16: Image of large object showing lateral inversion Lateral inversion is due to the fact that the object is perpendicularly opposite its image behind the mirror.
3.7.4 Characteristics of Images Formed by Plane Mirror From the forgoing you must have noted the following characteristics of images formed by plane mirror.
(i) It is the same size as the object; (ii) Each part is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it; (iii) It is laterally inverted (ie turned around); (iv) It is erect (ie upright) (v) It is virtual 3.8 Deviation of Reflected Ray by Rotated Mirror If a mirror is turned through an angle, the reflect ray of any light incident on it is turned through twice that angle.
That is, if the direction of an incident ray on a mirror is kept constant and the mirror is rotated through an angle, the reflected ray will be rotated through an angle, the reflected ray will be rotated through twice that angle.
This is illustrated in Fig.
1.17.
The mirror initially in the position MM is rotated through an angle q to the position M1M1 389PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The incident ray AP is normal to MM and is reflected back along its own path.
When the mirror is rotated to the position M1M1, the normal to the mirror becomes PN at that point of incidence P. This makes an angle of q with PA.
Thus the angle of incidence on M1M1 is q as well as the angle of reflection.
Hence, the direction PA to the direction PB through an angle of rotation equal to 2q .
3.9 Images Formed by Inclined Mirrors The number of images formed by inclined mirrors depends on the angle of inclination of the mirrors.
For instance, when two mirrors are inclined at a angle q , the number of images, n, formed by the two mirrors is given by the formula.
n = 360 0 -1 q Where n = number of images formed; q = angle between the two mirrors; and 360 0 = is always approximated or rounded up to the nearest n higher whole number when a fraction is obtained.
For example, if two mirrors are inclined at an angle of 900, then, the number of images formed by the mirrors is n = 360 0 -1 = 360 0 -1 i.e (4-1) images = 3 images This is illustrated in Fig.
1.18.
Fig.
1.18: Images formed in two mirrors inclined at right angles 390PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS As illustrated in Fig.
1.18 above, two mirrors are inclined at right angles to each other and a candle stick is placed between than.
As you can see, the number of images formed is three and these are: (a) The image (I ) of the candle formed by mirror AC; 1 (b) The image (I ) of the candle formed by mirror BC; 2 (c) The coincident Image (I ), which is a combination of the images of I 3 1 and I formed by both mirrors.
2 3.10 Images Formed by Parallel Mirrors Have you ever noticed that when two mirrors A and B are placed parallel to each other and an object O is place between then that multiple images are formed?
This is illustrated in Fig.
1.19.
A B X2 X1 O Y1 Y2 Fig.
1.19: Multiple images by two parallel mirrors As illustrated, when an object O is placed between two parallel mirrors A and B, multiple images of the object will be formed.
In the Fig.
1.19, X is the image of the object O formed by A and Y is the image of the 1 1 object O formed by B. X is the image of image Y formed by mirror A 2 1 and similarly, Y is the image of image X formed by mirror B.
That is, 2 1 as the images act as objects for further formation of images in the mirrors, an infinite number of images are formed by the parallel mirrors.
However, as the number of images increases, the images become fainter because a little light is diffused and absorbed at each reflection.

(iii) The Sextant – This is an instrument used by navigators for finding the angle of elevation of the Sun and other celestial bodies it depends on the constant deviation of rays striking two mirrors inclined at a fixed angle.
(iv) Kaleidoscope – This is a toy which makes use of two plane mirrors inclined at an angle of 6o0 to each other.

Periscope The instrument consists of two mirrors fixed facing each other at an angle of 450 to the line joining them.
A ray from an object enters the eye of an observes by successive reflections from the mirrors A and B.
This enables the observers to see an image of the object.

393PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 5.0 SUMMARY • Light is perceived to consist of wave like packets of energy called photons with a traveling speed of 3x108 ms-1 • Visible light is a form of energy which our eyes can detect.
It is divided into two sources namely the luminous source and the non–luminous sources.
• Luminous sources generate and emit light by themselves.
Non luminous sources do not give out light on their own but depend on natural or artificial light sources to illuminate them.
• When light strikes an object, it may be, depending on the nature of the material: (i) reflected, absorbed or transmitted; (ii) partly absorbed, partly reflected or partly transmitted.
• A ray is the path taken by light energy.
A beam is a collection of rays.
• Shadows and eclipse occur because light travels mainly in a straight line.
• The laws of reflection are: (i) The incident ray, the reflected and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
(ii) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
• An image is a picture of an object formed by a reflecting surface • A real image can be received on a screen and is produced by actual intersection of rays of light.
• A virtual image cannot be received on a screen and is produced by apparent intersection of rays of light.
• The image formed in a plane mirror is virtual, laterally inverted, the same size as the object and as far behind the mirror as the object is in front.
• The number of images formed by inclined mirrors depends on the angle of inclination of the mirrors • When two mirrors are inclined to each other at an angle q , the number of images in formed by the two mirrors is given by the formula.

Also, you will, learn how to draw ray diagrams to show how images are formed by concave mirrors, use ray diagrams to locate image position at different object positions.
Furthermore, you will learn practical applications of curved mirrors especially in car headlamps and driving mirrors.
Finally you will learn about the sign convention, the mirror formula and its application.
396PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the time you finish this unit, you will be able to: • Draw ray diagrams to show the formation of images by curved mirrors; • Explain some practical applications of curved mirrors; • Locate image positions by using curved mirror; • Investigate the relationship between object distance (u), image distance (v) and focal length (f) of the curved mirror.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Types of Curved Mirror We have two types of curved mirrors namely the concave and the convex mirrors.
They are made silvering a glass surface which is part of a sphere.
If the outside surface of the spherical part is silvered and the inside surface of the reflecting part, the resulting mirror is called a concave mirror.
On the other hand, if the inside surface is silvered and the outside surface is the reflecting part, the resulting mirror is called convex mirror.
This is illustrated in Fig.
2.1 Reflecting Reflecting surface Surface B Principal Principal B Axis axis c F p f c P v v Silvered Silvered Surface A surface A Fig.
2.1: Curved mirrors (a) Concave or converging mirror (b) Convex or diverging mirror 397PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.1.1 Terms Used in Curved Mirrors We use the following terms illustrated in Fig.
2.1 in describing the essential parts of a spherical mirror.
• The aperture: the width (AB) of the mirror • The pole (p): the centre of the reflection surface of the curved mirror.
• The Centre of Curvature (c) = the centre of the sphere of which the mirror forms a part • The Radius of curvature (r) = the distance CP.
It is the radius of the sphere of which the mirror forms a part.
• The Principle Axis: the line PC from the pole to the centre of curvature.
• The Principal Focus (f): The principal focus (f) of a curved mirror is that point on the principal axis to which incident rays parallel and close to the principal axis converge or from which they appear to diverge after reflection.
• The Principal Focus of a concave mirror is said to be a real focus because the reflected rays pass through it while that of a convex mirror is a virtual focus because the reflected rays do not pass through it.
This is illustrated in Fig.
2.2.
• The Focal Length (f): the distance (f-p) from the principal focus to the pole.
It is half the radius of curvature.
That is f = r/2.

2.2: Principal focus of concave and convex mirrors Principal rays for locating images in a curved mirror When ever you want to construct ray diagrams, you will use the following principal rays to locate the image position of your object.
(i) For a concave mirror Rule1 • Incident rays parallel to the principal axis are reflected through the principal focus.
Rule1 P C F Rule2 Incident rays passing through centre of curvature meet the mirror 1 at right angle and so are reflected back along their own paths.
Rule2 p 399PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Rule3: Incident rays passing through the principal focus are reflected parallel to the principal axis.
c f p Any two of the rays are sufficient for you to locate an angle.
(ii) For a convex mirror Rule1: Incident rays parallel to the principal axis are reflected so that they appear to come from the principal focus.
F P P Rule2: Incident rays traveling towards the centre of curvature meet the mirror at right angles and so are reflected back along their own paths.
F C 3.2 Image Formed by Curved Mirrors The size, nature and position of an image formed by a curved mirror depend on the position of the object from the pole of the mirror.
You can study there by the use of an illuminated object, a concave mirror and a screen.
To do this, you will place the concave mirror on a stand and allow light from the illuminated object to fall centrally on it by the adjustment of the height of the mirror.
The mirror is slightly turned to one side so as to form an image where possible on the screen.
You can do this for various object positions.
400PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS If you use a convex mirror, you will obtain an erect and virtual image smaller than the object position.
Also, you can always obtain the images formed by curved mirrors by scaled ray diagrams.
To do this, you will make use of the ‘principal rays’ discussed in 3.1.3.
The point I to which these reflected rays intersect represents the required image of O, the top of the object lies on the axis, since the ray XCP strikes the mirror normally at p and is reflected straight back.
This is illustrated in Fig.
2.3 for concave mirror and 3.4 for convex mirror.

2.3: Images formed by concave mirror You will observe that in the ray diagrams, OB represents rays parallel and close to the principal axis (rilr1) which after reflection passes through f. Ray OC passes through the centre of curvature C (rule2) and is reflected back on its on path.
402PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.2.2 Images Formed by Convex Mirror -*-*- Fig.
2.4: Image formed by concave mirror From Fig.
2.4 you see that convex mirror produced only virtual erect and diminished images.
The image is formed at the intersection of the reflection rays produced backwards (in broken lines) and is formed behind the mirror (virtual).This is the case for all positions of the object in front of the mirror.
3.2.3 Distinction between Real and Virtual Images You will now note the following distinction between real and virtual images.
Real Image Virtual Image (a) can be received on a Cannot be received on a Screen.
Screen (b) Produced by actual Produced by apparent inter intersection of rays of -section of rays of light.
light 3.3 Uses (Applications ) of Curved Mirrors Here, we are going to discuss some practical applications of images formed by curved mirrors at various objects by curved mirrors at various object positions.
• Object between F and P of a concave mirror The concave mirror, at this object position is used as dentist mirror, make – up mirror and showing mirror because the image formed in this position of object is enlarged, erect and virtual.
• Object at f of a concave mirror At the object position, the concave mirror is used for torch.
Also, parabolic (not spherical) concave mirrors are used in car headlamps and searchlight.
They produce a wide parallel beam of light of constant intensity when a small light source is placed at its focus.
Spherical concave mirrors are not used because they do not provide parallel beam of constant intensity (Fig.
2.5).
403PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Parabolic mirror Parallel beam of light Fig.
2.5: Parabolic mirror • Object between f and c At the object position, concave mirrors are used in some kind of flood light • Object at c Concave mirror is used as projector lamp in this object position.
• Concave mirrors are also used as reflectors in reflecting telescope and microscopes.
• Convex mirrors are used as driving mirrors because they always give an erect image of an object behind the driver.
In addition, they provide a wider field of view than a plane mirror of the same aperture.
This makes it possible for the driver to see objects with in a large angle.
Wide Field of view Eye Convex mirror Fig.
2.6: Field of view with a convex driving mirror 404PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 (1) With the aid of ray diagrams, illustrate the characteristics of image formed by a concave mirror when an object is placed (i) Between F and P (ii) at F, (i) between F and C (ii) at C; (iii) beyond C, and (iv) at infinity (2) In what situations would the image formed by a convex mirror be useful?
(3) Distinguish between real and virtual images.
(4) What is meant by the radius of curvature and the principal focus of a concave mirror?
3.4 Measurement of Focal Length of a Concave Mirror 3.4.1 Quick but Approximate Method A simple and quick method of finding an approximate value of the focal length of a concave mirror is to focus the image of a distant object on a screen.
To do this, you will hold a concave mirror with its reflecting surface facing a distant object such as a widow pane at an angle (Fig.
2.7).
You will also hold a screen, may be a piece of cardboard sheet.
Move the screen in front of the mirror until the sharpest image of the mirror window forms on it.
Measure the mirror distance between the screen and the mirror.
This value is the approximate value of the focal length of the mirror.
Fig.
2.7: Focal length by quick and approximate method 405PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Since the mirror is at a considerable distance away from the windows, the rays from it may be considered as parallel rays when they strike the mirror.
They will therefore come to a focus after reflection at the principal focus.
3.4.2 The Mirror Equation Method In this method you will make use of the relationship between the object distance u, the image distance v and the focal length of a spherical mirror the relationship is expressed in the equation.
I + I = I - - - - - - -- - (1) U V F In using this equation, you will first obtain the approximate focal length of the concave mirror using the method in paragraph 3.4.1 above.
You will need an illuminated object (the cross wire of a ray box or a candle stick), a screen, and a concave mirror.
Set up the apparatus as shown in Fig.
2.8 Fig.
2.8: Focal length by the mirror equation method Place the illuminated object at distance of about 3/2 f in front of the mirror and adjust the screen position until a sharp image is obtained.
Measure and record the object distance (distance from the object to the concave mirror), u and the image distance (distance from the screen to the concave mirror), v. Repeat the produce for at least six object distance, u, and obtain the corresponding values of image distance, v. Tabulate your readings as in the Table 2.1 below.
Table 2.1: Values of u and the corresponding values of v 406PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS u v uv U+V uv U V 1/u 1/v 1/u +1/ u+v v 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 Table B.
Table A.
You can now obtain the value of F from your readings in Table 2.1 in the following ways.
• Add the values of uv / u+v in Table A and find the average.
The result is the experimental value of f. • Add the values of 1/u + 1/v in Table B and find the average.
The result is 1/f from which you will the determined the value of F. F is the reciprocal od the value btained.
• Plot a graph of uv against u + v You will obtain a straight line graph.
The slope of this graph is equivalent to f, see Fig.
2.9 (a) • Plot a graph of 1/v against 1/u.You will obtain a graph with intercepts on both axes.
Each of the intercepts gives you a value of 1/f.
From this value, find the reciprocal to obtain the value.

2.9b).

2.9(a): Graph of uv against (u + v) 1 cm-1 v 1/f 1 1/ucm -1 F Fig.
2.9(b): Graph of 1/v against 1/u.
3.5 The Mirror Formula and Sign Conventions You can solve any problem on spherical mirror of small aperture by drawing to scale ray diagrams as in paragraph 3.2 above.
You can also use an equally valid method, the algebraic formulae which connect the object distance u, image distance v, focal length f, and magnification m. For a concave mirror, 1/v + 1/u = 1/f - - - - - - (1) from experimental determination of focal length it was found that 408PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 1/v + 1/u = 1/f Also the magnification m = v/u ----------- (2) For us to extend the usefulness of the above equations to virtual images as well as to convex mirrors, it is necessary to adopt what is called a sign convention.
The sign convention tells us when to add a position (+) or a negative (-) sign to each of the distances.
Two commonly used type sign conventions are presented below for you to study and use.
3.5.1 The Sign Convention Real is positive New Cartesian • Real objects and real images • Distances measured to the right are considered to be a of the mirror are positive.
positive distance from the mirror.
• Distances measured to the left of the mirror are negative.
• Virtual images are at a negative distance from the • Focal length of convex mirror is mirror.
negative • Focal length of a concave • Focal length of a convex mirror mirror is positive is positive.
• Focal length of a convex • Distances are measures from the mirror is negative Pole of the mirror.
The mirror is positioned with its face to the left.
3.5.2 Mirror Formulae The mirror equations are: (i) 1/u + 1/v = 1/f (Real is positive sign convention) or 1/v - 1/u = 1/f (New Cartesian sign convention) Where u = object distance from the mirror v = object distance from the mirror f = focal length of the mirror.
(ii) m = height of image = v/u 409PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS height of object where M = Linear magnification (iii) f = r/2 Where r = Radius of curvature of mirror f = Focal length of mirror.
Application of the Mirror Formulae in Solving Numerical Problems Work Examples (1) An object 3 cm tall is placed 12 cm from a concave mirror of focal length 8 cm.
find the image position and its height.
Solution u = 12, f = 8.
Using the mirror formula 1/u + 1/v = 1/f (Real is positive convention).
Substituting in the above equation gives 1/12 + 1/v = 1/8 1/v = 1/8 - 1/12 1/v = 1/24 v = 24 The image position is 24 cm.
Magnification M= v/u = 24/ 12 = 2 Height of the image = (3x2) cm = 6 cm.
(2) An Object is magnified five times by a concave mirror of radius of curvature 30 cm.
What is the object position if the image is (a) real and (b) virtual?
Solution (a) When the image is real M = v/u = 5/1 If u = x V = 5x (image is real).
410PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Using the mirror formula: 1/u + 1/v = 1/f r = 30cm (cid:222) f = /2 = 30/2 = 15cm ૪ Substituting in the formula gives 1/x + 1/5x = 1/15 5 + 1 = 1 .
5x 15 6 / 5x = 1 /15 5x = 6 x 15 = 90 x = 90 / 5 = 18 cm.
The object position when the image is real is 18 cm.
(b) When the image is virtual m = v / u = 5 /1 f = r /2 = 30 / 2 = 15cm If u = x V = -5x (image is virtual).
Substituting the values in the mirror formula we have 1/x - 1 / 5x = 1/ 15 5 + 1 = 1 .
5x 15 4/5x = 1/15 5x = 4 x 15 = 60 x = 60/ 5 = 12cm The object position when the image is virtual is 12 cm.
3.6 Defects of Spherical Mirrors You will observe spherical aberration when the aperture of a spherical mirror is large.
You will notice that a beam of light parallel to the axis does not converge to the principal focus.
Such a mirror brings rays close to the principal axis to a focus further away from the pole of the mirror than the focus.
In addition, it is found that the reflected rays are tangents to a curve known as a caustic curve.
The inability of such spherical 411PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS mirror of wide aperture to bring all parallel rays to the same focus is known as spherical aberration.
In order to avoid this phenomenon, spherical mirrors of small apertures are usually used.
Also, parabolic mirrors, where all parallel rays are brought to a single focus are used.
To avoid blurred images due to spherical aberration, parabolic mirrors are used to produce parallel beams in search lights, torch lights and car headlamps.

(a) What is the magnification produced?
(b) What magnification will be produced if the object is placed 30 cm from the mirror?

Also, you learned how to locate images formed by curved mirrors by scale drawings and calculations.

You will also learn the laws of refraction – the statements of the law and their verifications.
Furthermore you will learn about real and apparent depths in solids and liquids and the relationship between them.
In addition, you will learn the measurement of refractive index of glass and liquid using Snell’s law and ‘real and apparent depths’.
Finally, you will learn about critical angle and total internal reflection as the applications of total internal reflection.
414PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the time you finish this unit, you will be able to: • explain how the direction of light changes as it travels from one medium into the other • measure angles of incidence and refraction and hence deduce a value for the refractive index of a given material • explain the meaning of critical angle and total internal reflection stating the conditions under which they occur • establish the relationship between critical angle and refractive index and apply it to the solution of simple problems • trace light rays through a triangular prism and obtain graphically the value of the angle of minimum deviation.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Refraction of Light 3.1.1 Concept of Refraction If you consider the path taken by a ray of light as it travels from one medium to another say from air to water, you will observe that the direction of the ray changes instantly at the boundary separating the two media (air and water).
This instant change in the direction of light ray at the boundary of two transparent media is referred to as the refraction of light.
This phenomenon called refraction is evident in the following every day observations: i.
The bottom of clear pond appearing to be nearer the surface than it really is; ii.
A rod or spoon appears bent or broken when it is partially immersed in water; iii.
When a thick glass block is placed on a printed page, the letters under the block appear raised relative to those not under the block.
A rod appears bent in water 415PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS A rod Water (a) a rod appears bent in water (b ) P h ysics is a b ra n ch o f sc ie n c e Glass block Fig.
3.1: Demonstration of refraction effects Definition Refraction is the bending of a light ray as it crosses the boundary between two media of different densities thereby causing a change in its direction.
Refraction is due to the difference in the speed of light in different media.
If we consider a ray of light traveling from a medium A to another medium B as shown in Fig.
3.2 P Incident ray Angle of incidence Medium A 0 Medium B Angle of refraction r Refracted R Fig.
3.2: Ray of light traveling from one medium to another 416PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The incident ray PO is the path along which the light travels in the first medium.
The angle of incidence (i) is the angle which the incident ray makes with the normal to the surface at O.
The incident ray is refracted as it enters the second medium and it travels along the path OR.
This ray OR is called the refracted ray.
The angle between the refracted ray and the normal to the surface at O is called the angle of refraction(r).
Speed of light is more in medium of less optical density.
Rays of light traveling from low optical dense medium to light optical dense medium bend towards the normal.
On the other hand the rays of light traveling from high optical dense medium bend away from the medium.
3.1.2 Refraction of Light through Rectangular Glass Block Let us study the refraction of light at air glass boundary using a rectangular glass block.
To do this, you will place a thick rectangular glass block (or slab) horizontally on a cardboard sheet and draw the outline of the block with a pencil.
Direct a light ray from a ray box into the glass block surface AB along a line PO inclined at an acute angle to the normal ON.
The light ray is refracted in the glass CD.
Mark two points along the path of this ray.
Join the point by a line SR and produce it to meet the glass – air boundary at the point R, Remove the glass block.
Using a pencil, draw a line to join the points R and O.
This line RO represents the path of the light ray in the glass block.
N Incident ray O A A ir B Glass R Refracted ray C D R Emerge ray E S 1 NN Fig.3.3: Refraction through a rectangular glass block You will notice that the line RS is parallel to the line PO (Fig.
3.3).
The line PO is known as the incident ray, OR is the refracted ray while RS is 417PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the emergent ray.
The angle (i) between the incident ray and the normal at O is the angle of incidence.
The angle (r) between the refracted ray OR and the normal at O is the angle of refraction.
The angle (e) between the emergent ray RS and the normal at R is the angle of emergence.
You may have also noticed that when the light travels from air to glass, it is refracted towards the normal; when it travels from glass to air, it is refracted away from the normal.
This is a general phenomenon earlier mentioned and is due to the different in densities of the two media in which the incident and refracted rays travel.
That is: • When a ray of light travels from a less dense medium to a denser medium, the ray will be refracted towards the normal.
• A light ray passing from a denser medium to a less dense medium will be refracted away from the normal.
Note that if the incident ray is along the normal NO- at an angle of 900 to the side AB, ( i = O ).
It will pass straight through the glass and emerges on the surface CD without a change of direction.
Note also that there is no deviation or change in the direction of the emergent ray when compared with the incident ray.

Remove the prism and use a protractor to draw a normal ON to AB at a point O between A and B.
Now, consider the passage of light rays through this triangular glass prism (Fig.
3.5).
A Refracting angle of prism Angle of deviator (d) N Incident ray O d i e r emergent ray B C Fig.
3.5: Refraction through triangular prism Consider one such ray PQ incident on the prism side AB.
The incident, the refracted and the emergent rays are as shown in Fig 3.5.
Here, the emergent ray is not parallel to the incident ray but it is at an angle to it.
The prism deviates the incident ray through an angle d and is known as the angle of deviation.
It is the angle between the incident ray and the emergent ray of light passing through the prism.
This angle of deviation depends on: (i.)
The angle of incidence (ii) the refracting angle (A) of the prism and (iii) the refractive index of the material of the prism.
It has been proved from experimental results that the angle of deviation (d) varies with the angle of incidence (i) as shown in Fig.
3.6 419PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (a) A dm = D e r (b) d D i = e i Fig.
3.6: At minimum deviation ¡ = e Figure 3.6 shows that there is a minimum angle of deviation (D) which occurs when the incident and emergent rays are equally inclined to their respective surfaces.
Also, the ray passes symmetrically through the prism and the angle of incidence equal angle of emergence (i = e).
At minimum deviation, the refractive index (n) of the glass, the refracting angle (A) of the prism and the angle of minimum deviation (D) are related by the equation.
n = Sin ½ ( A + D ) sin ½ A 3.2 Laws of Refraction The phenomenon of the refraction of light was first observed in 300 BC by Euclid, a Greek mathematician.
An Egyptian Ptolomy was the first to 420PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS record the values of the angles of incidence and refraction but he could not find the relationship between these angles.
However in 1621 a mathematician, willebrod Snell formulated the exact relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction.
Hence, the law is known as Snell’s law of refraction.
3.2.1 Statements of Laws of Refraction There are two laws governing the refraction of light.
These are: i The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence all lie on the same plane.
ii The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for a given pair of media.
The second law is the Snell’s law and it may be expressed as: Sin i = constant Sin r For a given pair of media where ί = angle of incidence r = angle of refraction n = the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the fist medium.
The refractive index n is a number which gives a measure of the refraction or bending of light as it travels from one medium to another.
When light travels from air to glass, the refractive index of glass is given by η = Sine of angle of incidence in air a g Sine of angle of refraction in glass When light travels from glass to air then the refractive index η is given g a by η = Sine of angle of incidence in glass g a Sine of angle of refraction in air From the principle of the reversibility of light we have that a η g = 1/ η g a Also, because refraction is due to the change in the speed of light as it travels from one medium to another, the refractive index is given by 421PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS η = speed of light in air (vacuum) a g speed of light in glass.
3.2.2 Verification of Snell’s Law Snell’s law can be verified by performing an experiment using a rectangular glass block.
To do this, place the glass block on a sheet of paper and trace the outline with a pencil.
Draw a normal ON and the draw lines making angles of 300, 400, 500, 60o and 700 with then normal ON.
Direct a single ray of light from a ray box along one of the lines making angles of say 300 with the normal.
This is now the incident ray PO.
Mark two point TS where the light emerges from the glass block with a pencil.
This ray TS is the emergent ray – join the two points and produced the line to cut the glass block at R (fFg.
3.7).
Remove the glass block and join the points.
OR.
Draw a normal YRZ at point R where the emergent ray line or represents the refracted ray in the glass.

Measure and tabulate the angle of incidence (ί) and their corresponding angles of refraction (r) as shown in Table 3.1 below.
Table 3.1: Experimental values of the incident angle (i) and their corresponding angles of refraction (r) for a glass block Angle of incidence Angle of refraction Sin ί Sin r (i) (r) 300 400 500 600 700 Evaluate and record sin ί and sin r. Use the values to plot sin ί on the vertical axis and sin r on the horizontal axis.
Obtain the slope of the graph as shown in Fig.
3.8 below.
A Slope = AB CB = Change in sin ί change in sin r C B = Ŋ Sin r Fig.
3.8.: Graph of sin ί against sin r When sin ί is plotted against sin r, a straight line graph passing through the origin is obtained as show in Fig.
3.8 which proves that the ratio sin ί sin r is a constant.
That is sin ί / sin r = constant.
Hence, Snell’s verified.
The slope of the graph gives the refractive index for the glass block used.
(ii.)
We can also verify Snell’s law with optical pins in the experiment instead of a ray box.
Here optical pins are used to represent the 423PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS incident ray while sighting pins are used to locate the emergent ray.
Two pins MN are fixed on the line normal MO making angle 300 with the normal NO to represent the incident ray.
A sighting pin X is moved along CD until it appears to be in same straight line as MN when viewed through the glass block.
A second pin Y is fixed so that X and Y appear coincident with the image of M and N in the glass block.
This is illustrated in Fig.
3.9 m N N A O B D R C X y Fig.
3.9: Verification of Snell’s law The glass block is then removed and the incident ray is drawn through M and N while the emergent ray is drawn by joining the point O at which the line MN meets the glass surface to the point R where the emergent ray leaves the glass surface.
The angles of incidence and refraction are measured and the produce and repeated for various angles of incidence.
This is followed by plotting the graph of sin ί against sin r. Again, the graph is a straight line passing through the origin indicating sin ί / sin r is a constant and the slope gives the value of the refractive index.
Thus, Snell’s law is also verified and found to be true.
424PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.3.1 Real and Apparent Depths There appears to be an upward displacement of the bottom of a vessel containing water when viewed upward.
An object inside water appears to be closer to the surface than it actually is.
That is, the depth appears to be shallower than the actual depth.
This apparent depth is caused by refraction (Fig.
3.10) Eye Air Water A pparent dept Real depth Fig.
3.10: Real and apparent depths The rays from an object O under water do not travel straight to the eye but are refracted away from the normal as they leave the water surface.
When these rays are produced backwards, they meet at I where the rays appear to be coming from –the virtual image of O.
Thus, the observer sees the object as though it was at I.
The apparent depth is the distance of I from the surface of the water while the distance of the object O from the surface is called the real depth.
In the same way, if a thick glass block is placed on a printed page, the letters under the block will appear raised relative to those not under the block.
This is already illustrated in Fig.
3.1b.
3.3.2 Relation of Refractive Index to Real and Apparent Depths We can show how the real and apparent depths are related to the refractive index of the medium.
You know that the refractive index for rays of light traveling from air to water is given by the relation Sin ί (in air) n = 425PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Sin r (in water) Suppose an incident ray from an object O in water bends away from the normal as it travels from water to air in accordance to refraction effects.
This is illustrated in Fig.
3.11.
B P Q Air I Water N O Fig.
3.11: Relation between refractive index and real and apparent depths (Points Q and A are close to each other) From the principle of reversibility of light, light traveling in the opposite direction from air to water would follow the same path.
Recall that: Refractive index, η = Sin i Sin r This implies that η Sin — PAB Sin — OAN But — PAB = — QIA(corresponding angles) and — OAN = — QOA (alternate angles) Therefore Sin — QIA η = Sin — QOA QA / AI QA x AO = = QA/ AO AI QA 426PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS AO = AI Since the eye sees both rays OQ and OA, they must be close to each other.
Hence AL = QI and AO = QO (cid:222) QO η = QI That is, Real depth h = Apparent depth.
The above is a general formula and can be used to calculate the apparent depth if the refractive index and the real depth of a medium are known.
3.4 Measurement of Refractive Index 3.4.1 Measurement of Refractive Index of Solid (glass) Using (i) Snell’s law (ii) Real and apparent depths (i) By Snell’s law This follows same procedure as the verification of Snell’s law already discussed and illustrated in section 3.2.2.
(ii) By real and apparent depths The refractive index of glass can be determined by the real and apparent depth method.
This is illustrated in Fig.

3.12: Finding the refraction index of glass block by real and apparent depth methods This is done by fixing an object pin P with plasticine vertically touching one side of a rectangular glass block mounted on a cardboard paper placed on a laboratory table.
A search pin on a sliding cork is then mounted above the rectangular glass block using retort stand and damp as shown in Fig.
3.12.
The object pin P is then viewed through the block from the opposite side of the pin as the search pin is moved back and forth until there is no parallax between the object pin P and its image P1 as seen through the glass block.
The real thickness (depth) D and the apparent thickness (depth) d of the glass block are measured.
The refractive index n of the glass is the then calculated using the formula: Refraction index, η = real thickness(depth) D = apparent thickness (depth) d 3.4.2 Measurement of Refractive Index of Liquid (water) Using (i) Snell’s law (ii) Real and apparent depths (i) By Snell’s Law A straight – sided transparent Perspex box of water is placed on a sheet of cardboard paper and it outline ABCD is drawn using a sharp pencil.
A ray box is then adjusted to give a narrow beam of light.
The narrow beam of light is directed to strike the box of water surface AB at point O an acute angle such that the incident ray PO makes an angle of incidence i say 600 to the normal ON.
The light beam comes out into the air at R in the same direction as the incident beam at O but is displaced sideways.
The point Q and R are marked on the emergent ray.
The water box is then removed and the points PORQ are joined as shown in Fig.

3.13: Finding the refractive index of water using Snell’s law The angle of incidence i and the corresponding angle of refraction r are measured and recorded.
Following r are same procedure, four different values of the angles of incidence say 500, 400, 300 and 200 and their corresponding angles of refraction are obtained.
The result is than tabulated in a composite table such as Table 3.2 below.

(ii) By real and apparent depths.
We can also find the refractive index of a liquid (water) by the real and apparent depth methods illustrated in Fig.
3.13 429PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Measuring Cylinder Retort Stand Water Search Pin Apparent Cork depth Real Depth Large pin P’ Object pin P Fig.
3.14: Finding the refractive index of ware by real and apparent depth methods In this method an optical pin is placed at the bottom of a beaker to serve as the object P. Water is then poured into the beaker until it is about three – quarters full.
A search pin is attached horizontally to a sliding cork and it is moved up and down until it coincides with the apparent position of the pin as seen from above the liquid.
At this point there is no parallax between the object pin p and the image pin P1.
The real and apparent depths of the pin from the surface of the water are than measured and the refractive index of the liquid (water) is calculated using the formula: Refractive index, η = real depth apparent depth 3.4.3 Determination of the Refractive Index of Glass by the Method of Minimum Deviation of Light through a Glass Prism In this experiment, the path of a single ray of light through a triangular prism is traced using either the optical pins no – parallax method or a ray box.
The angle of incidence i of say 300 of the ray of light at the face AB and the corresponding angle of emergent e at the face AC are obtained, measured and recorded by drawing normal at G and L respectively.
This is done by joining the emergent ray HK and producing it to meet the incident ray FG produced at a point M. the angle of deviation d is also measured and recorded.
This illustrated in Fig.
3.14.
430PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS F ¡ m G r d e L k H B C Fig.
3.15: Determination of refractive index of glass using triangular prism The above procedure is repeated for several other values of angles of incidence ¡ say 400.450, 500, 550 and 600, aid the corresponding values of emergent angles e and angles of deviation d measure and recorded in each case.
The result is tabulated in the headings shown in Table 3.3 below: Table 3.3: Experimental values for determining refractive index using triangular prism Angle of Angle of Angle of incidence ί (0) emergent e (0) deviation d (0) (d – e) (0) 30 40 45 50 55 60 A graph of (d – e) on the vertical axis against ί on the horizontal axis is then plotted from which the intercepts on both axes are determined.
The mean of these intercepts is determined, using the magnitude of the intercepts (ie disregarding the negative sign).
This gives the value of A, the refracting angle of the triangular prism.
That is, the mean of the values of the magnitude of the intercepts on both axes is equal to the refracting angle A the triangular prism.

3.16: Graph of (d-e) against i A graph of d on the vertical axis against I on the horizontal axis is also plotted.
From this graph (Fig.3.17), the minimum value of d (ie D) is determined and the value of I at this minimum deviation D is read from the graph.
d Dm = D= 370 ¡ = e i Fig.
3.17: Graph of d against i showing minimum deviation D These values of A and D are then substituted in the equation η = Sin ½ (A + D) Sin ½ A From which the value of the refraction index n of the glass is then calculated.
The result of experiments show that as the angle of incidence increases, the angle of deviation, d, decreases, until at a certain minimum value, 370, the angle of deviation begins to increase for any further increase in the angle of incidence.
Hence the graph is a curve.
432PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS In this experiment the refractive index n of the prism material can also be worked out from the values of angles of incidence I and the corresponding angles of refraction r from the relation.
Refractive Index, η = Sin ¡ Sin r Either by plotting the graph of sin ¡ against sin r as in section 3.2.2 or by finding the mean value of the ratio of Sin ¡ for each set of reading as in Sin r section 3.4.2 3.5.1 Critical Angle and Total Internal Reflection When ever light is incident on the interface between two media, there is usually a weak reflected ray in addition to the refracted ray (Fig.
3.18) Incident ray Weak reflected R efra cte d ray r ra y l l Air Air Plane bounding Water or glass Water or glass r l l Refracted ray Incident Weak reflected ray ray Fig.
3.18: Refraction and partial reflection A striking change occurs when the situation is reversed optically so that light passes from glass to air.
When light passes through an optical dense medium to meet the surface of less dense one, as the angle of incidence I is increased, the angle of refraction r also increases until it is 900.
In that case, the refracted ray is along the interface (surface) of the two media.
• Critical angle c is the angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the less dense medium is 900.
The value of the critical angle C depends on the nature of the two media or their relative refractive indices.
(It is about 420 for crown glass the most common type of optical glass).
• Total internal reflection occurs when the incident angle I is more then the critical angle C. At this point all incidents light is 433PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS reflected back to give strong reflected ray.
There is no refraction.
Hence total internal reflection (Fig.
3.19).
Weak reflected ray Incident Weak reflected ray ray Strong reflected l l l ray Glass Glass Glass Air Air Air Strong No refraction reflected total reflection ray Strong reflected ray (a) l < c (b) l = c (c) l > c Fig.
3.19: Illustration of total internal reflection Total internal reflection cannot occur when light is incident in air on a glass block.
This is because the angle of refraction in the glass is always less than the angle of incidence.
Therefore, even when the angle of incidence in air is nearly 900, a refracted ray is obtained.
Reflection always occurs at air- glass boundary but this reflection is only partial because most of the light passes into the glass (water).It is therefore important to note that: For total internal reflection to occur • Light must travel from an optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium; • The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle.
3.5.2 Relationship between Critical Angle C and Total Internal Reflection You will recall that from Snell’s law we have for a ray passing from: • air to glass, a Ŋ g Sin ί = Sin r Therefore, applying the principle of reversibility of light, for a ray passing from: • Glass (denser medium) to air (less dense medium), g Ŋ a Sin r = Sin ί 434PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS That is, the refractive index n of the denser medium is given by η = Sin r Sin I When ί = C, the critical angle r = 900 Hence η = Sin 90 0 = 1 .
Sin C Sin C Since η = 1/ sin C ie η sin C = 1 Sin c = 1/n In general, refractive index η = 1/ sin (critical angle) (cid:222) Sin C = 1/η Generally, the critical angle in the denser medium is given by Sin C = η / η a b Where n is the absolute refractive index for the optical denser medium.
b n - is the refractive index for the less dense medium.
a Since C cannot be greater than unity η must always be greater than n .
b a 3.5.3 Applications of Total Internal Reflection Total internal reflections are the basis for explaining the working principle of some of the phenomena we experience in nature and some optical instruments.
For instance the working of prism periscope, prism binoculars, bicycle reflectors, reflectors on road , light guides optical fiber are explained on the basis of total internal reflection.
Also, the phenomena of image, fish and cat’s eyes view are some natural observations that are explained on the basis of total internal reflection.
Now let us consider some of them: (i.)
Optical fiber The principle of total internal reflection is used in optical fibers.
The optical fiber (Fig.3.20) is made up of a fine strand of glass coated with another type of glass of lower refractive index.
It is constructed in such a 435PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS way that light rays falling on the interphase between the two types of glass always undergo total internal reflection as shown in Fig.
3.20.
Low refractive High refractive index Fig.
3.20: Optical fiber action When light enters one end of the fibre at an angle less than say 600, it is refracted towards the normal by the inner glass.
The refracted ray impinges on the boundary between the two types of glass and undergoes total internal reflection.
The light emerges at the other end after undergoing many repeated total internal reflections at the walls of the optical fibre.
Uses • They can be used as light guides to enable the image of an object at one end to be seen at the other.
• They can be fitted with an objective and an eyepiece and inserted into the stomach or throat to study the internal structure.
• They are used for electrical and engineering purposes such as in telecommunications and TV transmission, the electrical impulses are converted into light signals which are then transmitted via these fibres.
(ii) Mirage Mirage is one of the natural phenomenons that can be explained on the basis of total internal reflection.
This occurs at the boundary of a hot and a cold gas.
On a hot day for instance the air in contact with the ground gets very much hotter than the layer above the ground.
The hotter air is optically less dense than the colder air above the ground.
The refractive index of air depends on its intensity.
Hence, the lower hotter layers have a lower refractive index than the layers above then.
Rays of light passing through these different layers of air are refracted due to the gradual change in density.
Therefore a ray from part of the sky passing from colder to warmer air layer (from denser to a less dense medium) bends gradually from the incident direction until it enters a layer of air near the ground at B where total internal reflection occurs.
This ray is then reflected upwards into the dense air as illustrated in Fig.
3.2.
436PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Hot air layer varging n Sky C Observer B Pool Total internal reflection Fig.
3.21: Image After undergoing refraction in a gradual upward direction, the ray enters the eye of an observer at C as if it comes from A.
It gives the illusion of a reflecting pool of water in the road some distance away.
I am sure you must have experienced this illusion on a hot day while on a car moving on a tarred road.
People may sometimes see illusions of inverted images of trees in a pool of water below the actual tree for the reason explained above especially around hot deserts because of the intense heat there.
3.6 Numerical Examples (i.)
The apparent depth of a liquid in a big jar is 6 m when its real depth is 8 m. What is the refractive index of the liquid?
Solution Refractive index of liquid = Real depth Apparent depth ie n = real depth apparent depth = 8/6 = 4/3 437PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS ii The angle of incidence of a ray of light striking an equilateral triangular prism is 450.
If the refractive index of the prism is 1.5, and the refracting angle is 600, calculate (a) the angle of refraction at the first face, (b) the angle of emergence Solution (a) let r be the angle of refraction at the first face, AB using n = sin ί sin r 1.5 = sin 45 0 sin r Sin r = sin 45 0 1.5 = 0.7071 1.5 = 0.4714 \ r = Sin-1 0.4714 Angle of refraction r = 28.130 (b) M 600 G x e ¡ r N H B C Let the emergent angle be e as shown above.
x = 900 - r (MN normal to AB) = 900 - 28-130 = 61.870 438PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 90o + y = 600 + x (exterior angles of triangle AFG) y = 600 + 61.
870 - 900 = 31.870 Note that the incident ray at the second face AC is FG and the refracted ray is GH.
Thus applying the principle of reversibility of light, a light ray incidence on AC along HG will be refracted along GF.
Hence Refractive of index prism = Sin e Sin y ie 1.5 = Sin e Sin y Sin e = 1.5 x Sin 31.870 = 1.5 x 0.5280 e = sin-1 0.7920 Angle of emergence e = 52.37o SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Refraction through Lenses Refraction through lenses involves the change in direction of light rays.
A lens is any transparent material with two faces of which at least one is curved.
It causes a beam of light passing through it to either converge or diverge.
3.1.1 Types of Lenses We have two types of lenses namely convex lens and concave lens.
• A convex lens is a converging lens.
It makes a parallel beam of light falling on it to converge.
It is thicker at its centre than at its edges.
• A concave lens is a diverging lens.
It makes parallel beams of light falling on it to appear to diverge from a point.
It is thinner at its centre than at the edges.
We have various forms of convex and concave lenses but the most commonly used ones in school laboratory experiments are the biconvex and the biconcave lenses.
Plano- convex and Plano – concave lenses are used in optical instruments while concavo – convex and convexo – concave are used as contact lenses to correct defective vision.
Most lenses are made from glass, a few are made with quartz or plastic.
The eye has a crystalline biconvex lens.
These are shown in Fig.
4.1.

4.1: Types of lenses 3.1.2 Terms Used in Lenses We have some important parameters associated with a lens.
They are defined as follows: • The optical centre (c) (Fig.
4.2) of a lens is the point through which rays of light pass without being deviated by the lens.
• The principal axis is the line passing through the optical centre of the lens and joining the centre of curvature of its surfaces.
• The principal focus (f) of a converging or convex lens is the point to which all rays parallel and close to the principal axis converge after refraction through the lens.
• The principal focus of a diverging or concave lens is the point from which all rays parallel and close to the principal axis appaear to diverge after refraction through the lens.
• A lens has two principal foci because light may pass through a lens from either direction.
• Focal length (f) is the distance between the optical centre and the principal focus of the lens.
• The power (p) of a lens is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length and is measured in diapers when f is in meters.
The shorter the focal length f the greater will be the power of the lens.
• The principle of reversibility of light states that, the path of a light ray is reversible.
Because of the principle of reversibility of light, rays originating from f and passing through the convex lens will emerge parallel to the principal axis.
443PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS • The principal focus of a converging lens is real, that of a diverging lens is virtual.
• Lenses whose thicknesses are small in comparism with their focal lengths are referred to as thin lenses.
For such lenses, the two foci are symmetrically placed with respect to the optical center of the lens.
The terms associated with lenses are illustrated in Fig.
4.2 below.

4.2: Terms associated with lenses 3.1.3 Rules for Constructing Images Formed by: (i) Convex (Converging) lens (ii) Concave (Diverging) lens (i) Rules for convex (converging) lens.
You will obey the following rules when constructing images formed by convex (converging) lens.
Rule 1: Incident rays parallel to the principal axis are refracted through the principal focus.
444PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS F¢ C F Rule 2: Incident rays passing through the optical center are undeviated F¢ C F Rule 3: Incident rays passing through the principal focus emerge parallel to the principal axis after being refracted through the lens.
F C f You can use any two of the three rays to locate an image.
(ii) Rule for concave (diverging) lens.
The following rules will guide you when constructing images formed by concave (diverging) lens.
Rule 1: Incident rays parallel to the principal axis are refracted away from the principal focus.
F C F 445PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Rule 2: Incident rays passing through the optical centre are undeviated.
F C F 3.2 Formation of Images by Lenses You should note that light rays incident on a converging lens converge to form a real image on the other side of the lens after passing through the lens.
For a diverging lens, the rays from an object diverge to form a virtual image of the object.
When you know the distance of an object from the lens and the focal length of the lens, you can obtain the position and nature of the image by the construction of ray’s diagrams.
To do this, you will employ the rules for constructing images formed by lenses discussed in 3.1.3 above.
3.2.1 Formation of Images by a Convex (Converging) Lens You will locate the position and determine the nature of the image formed by a convex lens by following these construction steps.
(i) Choose a suitable scale for the construction (ii) Draw a straight vertical line MW (Fig.
4.3.)
to represent the position of the lens and mark the position of the focus F according to the scale.
Represent the focal length with CF.
(iii) Represent the object by drawing an arrow line OA perpendicular to OC,OC should correspond to the distance of the object from the lens (iv) and OA, the height, (v) Draw a ray AP parallel to the principal axis from the top of the OA, According to rule 1, ray AP is refracted through F1 (vi) Draw another ray AC through the centre of the lens C. This ray passes straight through without changing direction (rule 2).
(vii) The point of intersection B of the two emerging rays PB and CB represents the top of the image.
(viii) Now, complete the image by drawing B1 normal to the principal axis.
(ix) Measure the image distance from C and the image height B1, convert to the actual values using your scale.
446PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Ray diagrams for various object positions are presented in Fig.

4.3: Image formed by convex (converging) lens 3.2.2 Formation of Images by a Concave (Diverging) Lens You will observe by drawing ray diagrams for a concave lens that the image is virtual, erect and diminished.
It is always on the same side of the lens as the object and between the object and the lens.
These image characteristics are for all object positions.
This is illustrated in Fig.
4.4.A concave lens is usually used in spectacles for the correction of short sightedness because of its qualities.

4.4: Images formed by concave (diverging) lens These ray diagrams were constructed using the rules listed in section 3.1.3 (ii).
450PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.3 Practical Applications (uses) of the Convex (Converging) Lens We use the convex (converging) lens in many optical instruments.
Some of them are listed below.
• When the object is between F and lens, the lens is used as eye lens of many instruments, magnifying glass, spectacles for long sight.
• When object is at F, it is used at theatre and stadium spotlights.
• When object is between F and 2F, it is used as objective lens of microscopes and projectors.
• When object is at 2F, it’s used in copying camera.

3.5 Lens Formulae and Sign Conventions 451PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.5.1 Sign Conventions You have already learned the sign conventions in Module 4 Unit 2 for the case of curved mirrors.
A similar situation applies for lenses.
We have that for; • New Cartesian convention i The optical centre is taken as the origin for measuring all distances.
ii Distances measured against the incident light are negative.
iii Distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are positive.
If the object is always placed to the left of the lens, this convention implies that all distances to the left of the lens are negative, while all those to the right are positive.
• Real – is – positive convention (i) The optical centre is taken as the origin for measuring all distances.
(ii) Distances of real objects and images are positive.
(iii) Distances of virtual objects and images are negative.
When you use the real – is – positive convention, you will take the focal length of converging lens to be positive because the lens has a real principal focus.
On the other hand, you will take the focal length of a diverging lens to be negative because the lens has a virtual principal focus.
3.5.2 Linear Magnification You will recall that the linear magnification (m) produced by mirrors is the ratio.
M = height of image height of object This is also true for a lens.
You will easily see this relationship from the following ray diagrams in Fig.
4.5.
F 452PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS O F C F B V U 453PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (a) Converging lens P B v C O I F F (b)Diverging lens Fig.4.5: Ray diagrams for lens formula You can see from Fig.
4.5 (a) and (b) that triangles C1B and COA are similar.
It therefore follows that: M = height of image 1B 1C = = height of object OA OC That is, M = distance of image from lens distance of object from lens In symbols, V M = U Where, M = linear magnification V = image distance U = object distance 454PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.5.3 Lens Formulae We can derive the formulae relating u, v, m and f by either theoretically from the geometry of ray diagrams or practically from the result of experiments.
Here, our derivation is theoretical from the geometry of ray diagrams.
Also, the real – is positive sign convention is adopted.
Recall that for thin lenses, distances are measured from the optical centre of a lens.
Distances measured to real foci, images and objects are positive, distances measured to virtual foci, images and objects are negative.
From figure 4.5, you can see that: triangles CIB and COA are similar also, triangles FIB and FCP are similar Therefore, for the converging lens, The magnification M IB V = = OA U because ∆F IB and ∆ FCP are similar.
Also, IB FI M = = CP FC because ∆S FIB and FCP are similar From figure 4.5 (a) FI = v – f and FC = f This implies that v – f M = F 455PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Therefore, v v – f M = = u f From the above, we have that v v- f = u f vf = uv – uf Dividing through by v gives us vf uv - uf = v v v f = u _ uf .
v Dividing through by u gives us f _ u _ uf u u vu f _ 1 - f .
u v Dividing through by f gives us F = 1 - f .
uf f vf 1/u = 1/f -1/v Rearranging, we have, 1/u + 1/v = 1/f The above relation is the lens formula.
For the diverging lens, you can also, by a similar procedure, using the two pairs of similar triangles obtain two expressions for the magnification m. That is, m = -v/ u = - f + v -f or m = v/u = - f + v f The above will lead you to 1/v + 1/u = 1/f as in that of converging lens.
456PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.6 Determination of the Focal Length of a Converging Lens by the Measurement of Object and Image Distances Fig.
4.6 (a):Image of distant object: Quick and approximate methods Fig.
4.6(b): Focal length of a converging lens by u, v measurements You can use the lens formula to obtain the focal length of a converging lens, by measuring the object and image distances.
You will first obtain the approximate value of f by the Quick but approximate method (Fig.
4.6 ).
You will do this by focusing the image of a distant (a) object on a screen using a lens.
Place the lens in front of the screen and adjust it until a sharp image of a distant object (Fig.
4.6a) is obtained in the screen.
Measure the distance between the lens and the screen which is the approximate value of the focal length.
Rays coming from the distant object are parallel rays and therefore converge to the principal focus of the lens after refraction.
Now, having obtained the approximate focal length, f, of the lens, set up the apparatus as shown in Fig.
4.6(b).
Place an illuminated object at a known distance, u, greater than f in front of the lens.
Adjust the position of the screen on the other side of the lens until you obtain a sharp image of the object on the screen.
Measure the 457PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS distances u and v from the ray box to the lens (u) and the screen t o the lens (v).
Repeat the procedure for five other values of u and obtain the corresponding values of v. Tabulate your readings as in Table 4.1.
Table 4.1: Values of u and the corresponding values of v u v uv u+v uv/ u +v 1 2 ֽ ֽ ֽ 6 Table A u v 1/u 1/v 1/u +1/v 1 2 ֽ ֽ ֽ 6 Table B You can obtain the value of f from your readings in Table 4.1 in the following ways: • Add the values of uv / (u + v) in table A and find the average.
The result is the experimental value of f. • Add the values of 1/u + 1/v in table A and find the average.
The result is 1/f from which you will then determine the values of f. f is the reciprocal of the value obtained.
Plot a graph of w against (u + v).
You will obtain a straight line graph.
The slope of this graph is equivalent to f. Obtain it (Fig.
4.7 ).
(a) 458PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Plot a graph of 1/v against 1/u.You will obtain a graph with intercepts on both axes.
Each of the intercepts gives you a value of 1/f.
from these values; find the reciprocal to obtain the value of f (Fig.
4.7 ).
(b) Fig.

4.7(a): Graph of uv against (u + V) 1/vcm-1 1/f 1/f 1/ucm-1 Fig.
4.7(b): Graph of 1/v against 1/u.
You will always take the following precautions when you deal with light rays and optical experiments: • Use sharp pencil in drawing ray diagrams to obtain neat traces.
• Avoid parallax when measuring with the metre rule.
• Ensure proper alignment of object, lens or mirror and the screen.
• Ensure that a sharp image is properly focused on the screen.
• Ensure that optical pins (if used) are vertical and well spaced.

In this unit you will learn to apply the knowledge you acquired from the earlier units to explain the working of cameras, human eyes, projectors, microscopes and telescope.
You will also learn to describe these optical instruments with respect to the nature and functions of their various parts.
465PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the time you finish this unit you will be able to: • construct a model of a box camera • explain the formation of images by the camera and the projector by tracing rays of light through them • explain the roles played by some parts of the eyes in the formation of image on the retina • compare and contrast the eye and the camera • state the defects of the eye and their causes • identify the type of lenses for correcting the various defects of the eyes • trace the paths of light rays through simple and compound microscopes and telescopes.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Simple Camera and Projector 3.1.1 The Camera – Features and Operations Fig.
5.1: A lens camera The features and operations of the lens camera - Consist of a light – tight box which contains a convex lens in front and a film at the opposite end - The lens converges the incident rays from objects.
- the film serves as a screen on which the image is received 466PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS - characteristics of image formed  Real  Inverted  Diminished - Focusing screw alters the distance of lens from film in order to always focus the image on the film - Diaphram controls the amount of light entering the camera.
This is made possible by the variable aperture or hole.
- Shutter controls the amount of light entering the camera.
It has variable speed and therefore can open for different lengths of time (exposure time).
The extent to which the diaphragm and the shutter combine to determine the amount of light entering the camera depends on:  Sensitivity of the film;  Brightness of the object; and  Kind of effect that is wanted.
3.1.2 The Project –Features and Operations The projector is an instrument for projecting on a screen an enlarged image of transparent object such as a slide.
That is a projector is used for showing enlarged image of transparent slides and films on a white screen.
Fig.
5.2: The slide projector - A powerful source of light is essential as the light on the screen has to spread over many times greater than that on the slide (film) in order to achieve the high magnification required.
The camera projector magnification could be as high as 100 times.
The powerful but small light source illuminates the object which is usually non- luminous A converging mirror placed behind the light source helps to direct the light onto the film or slide.
This source of light is at the 467PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS focus of the first lens aid the second lens converges the parallel beam upon the projection lens.
The convergent beam illuminates the slide (film).
- The projection lens is adjusted so that the slide (film) is just beyond its principal focus.
- The slide (film) must be placed upside down so that the image on the screen appears the right way up.
- A device to absorb the intense heat from the source of light is usually interposed between the condenser and the slide ( film) or a fan is incorporated to send a cooling draught on the slide (film) to prevent it from over heating - Characteristics of image formed  Real  Enlarged The principle of the slide project is used in cine- projector, photographic enlargers and several other devises.
3.2 The Human Eye 3.2.1 The features and operations of the human eye L e n s Aqueous humoLurris R e tinS paot w Pupil YelloBlind Spot C ornea Ciliary Muscle Optic nerve V itreous Fig.
5.3: Optical features of the human eye - The cornea is transparent and allows light rays to pass through to meet the eye lens.
- The eye lens focuses the image of the object on the retina.
468PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS - The sensitive retina sends message to the brain by way of optic nerve.
- The pupil is a hole in the middle of the iris.
It appears black because no light is reflected from it.
- The iris is the coloured portion of the eye.
It adjusts the size of the pupil to vary the amount of light that enter the eye through the pupil - The cilliary muscle alters the focal length of the eye lens inorder to focus images on the retina (an action referred to as power of accommodation of the eye).
The contraction and relaxation of the cilliary muscles vary the thickness of the lens (ie the focal length).
- The aqueous humour is a transparent liquid and fills the space between the cornea and the lens - The vitreous humour is a jelly - like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina.
3.2.2 The action of the eye The normal eye in the relaxed state is focused on infinity known as the far point .
- Near point and far point: the nearest point at which an object can be clearly seen is called the near point.
The farthest point at which an object can be clearly seen is called the far point.
- To see near objects clearly, the cilliary muscles increase the curvature of the eye lens and so enable it to focus the divergent light.
Accommodation is effective upon the near point.
- For young children, the near point may be as close as 7.5 cm.
- The least distance of distinct vision for the normal eye is 25 cm.
(a) 469PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS (b) Fig.
5.4: Near point and far point - Accommodation: This is the ability of the eye to focus both near and far objects on the retina through the action of the ciilliary muscle by which the focal length of the lens is altered.
- Binocular vision: This is the combination of the two over- lapping views of an object seen by both eyes in such a way as to create the right sense of distance and depth.
By binocular vision we get a proper perspective of an object.
- Persistence of vision: A clear image formed on the retina gives a sensation of vision which remains for a short but definite time.
The retention of the vision of the image is known as the persistence of vision.
if a light thicker at a very short interval of about ten times per second, it appears to the eye as a continuous source of light owing to the persistence of vision.
This phenomenon is made use of in the production and showing of motion pictures.
A rapid succession of separate pictures cast on the screen appears to have continuity and can depict motion.
If the speed of the successive pictures is reduced, the continuity is broken and the moment in the sequence becomes jerky or a thickening effect observed.
3.2.3 The Defects of Vision and their Corrections The principal defects of vision which can be corrected with lenses are short sightedness ( myopia) , long sightedness ( hypermetropia), loss of accommodation (presbyopia) and astigmatism..
These eye defects are corrected by the use of suitable spectacles or by contact lenses which are placed to fit closely on the cornea.
We are going to consider these eye defects and their corrections under these headings: meaning, cause and corrections.
i.
Short Sightedness (Myopia) Meaning: This is the ability of a person to see near objects clearly but not distant objects.
This eye defect is called short- sightedness.
470PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Cause: it is caused by a person’s eye ball being too long and so focus distant object in front of the retina.
The far point for the eye is much nearer than the normal eye.
Correction: A short – sighted person should wear a concave (diverging) spectacle lens.
This spectacle lens (concave) is used to form a virtual image of a distant object at the person’s far point as illustrated in Fig.
5.5.
Fig.
5.5: Short – sightedness and its correction Parallel rays from a distant object appear to diverge from a far point (the principal focus of the spectacle lens) and make them appear to come from a near distance.
The short – sighted person has no problem of seeing near object closer to the eye than 25 cm because with the spectacle, the near point is slightly further away from the eye.
ii.
Long – Sight (Hypermetropia) Meaning: This is the ability of a person to see distant object clearly but not near object.
Common example is those who require glasses to read but not to see distant object.
471PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Cause: it is caused by the person’s eye ball being two short or eye lens being too thin or the optical system of the eye being too weak so that rays from the normal near point ( 25 cm) are brought to focus beyond, instead of on, the retina.
That is, rays from near objects focus behind the retina.
Correction: A convex (converging) lens is used for the correction of long- sight.
The focal length should be such that it would produce a virtual image of an object placed 25 cm away at the person’s near point (Fig.
5.6).
iii.
Loss of Accommodation (Presbyopia) Meaning: This is the loss of elasticity of the eye-lens.
That is, the eye – lens tends to become inelastic and unable to accommodate.
The far point usually approaches the eye while the near point recedes.
Cause: It is caused by increasing age which makes the eye-lens to become inelastic and unable to accommodate.
Correction: It requires two pairs for its correction.
A concave pair for viewing distant object and a convex pair for viewing near objects.
The two pairs may be combined in one frame with the top and bottom parts having different powers (bifocal spectacles).
iv.
Astigmatism Meaning: this is when the focusing power of the eye is different in different planes.
The horizontal lines may appear in focus while the vertical lines are not seen distinctly: This is caused by the distortion of the curvatures of the cornea or of the eye-lens.
Correction: It is corrected by shaping the spectacle lens so as to have different curvatures in different directions.

The differences  The human eye has the power of accommodation.
That is, can vary its lens focal length.
While the focal length of the camera is fixed.
 The distance between the lens and the retina is fixed in the human eye.
In the camera, the distance between the lens and the film can be varied  The eye can suffer from the defect of vision unlike the camera.
 The eye is a biological organ while the camera is mechanical device, leading to other differences.

3.3 Simple and Compound Microscopes 3.31 The Simple Microscope or Magnifying Glass For viewing near object, the simple microscope or magnifying glass is a convex lens which is used to produce magnified images of small objects.
The objects are usually placed nearer to the lens than the principal focus so that an erect virtual and magnified images seen clearly at 25 cm from the normal eye.
Magnification of the object produced by the lens is given by the formula M= 1- D f = 1 + D F ( image is virtual ) Where M = angular magnification D = least distance of distinct vision (for a normal eye, D= 25 cm) F = focal length of the lens.
Thus, the image subtends a larger visual angle than that produced when the object itself is placed 25 cm form the unaided eye and therefore looks bigger.
This is illustrated in Fig.
5.8.
475PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
5.8: Simple microscope or magnifying glass The simple microscope is used for reading small print and for studying biological specimen in the laboratory 3.3.2 The Compound Microscope For scientist to produce higher magnification than that produced from a simple microscope, a combination of two convex lenses is used in an arrangement called the compound microscope.
The compound microscope consists of two convex lenses fitted at the opposite ends of a tube.
The tube is mounted on a stand so that it can be lowered or raised for focusing.
The object is placed under and close to the lower lens which has a very short focal length and is called the objective lens.
The final magnified image is viewed through the upper lens which has a longer focal length.
This lens is called the eyepiece.
The eyepiece has a comparatively larger focal length than the objective lens.
The compound microscope generally has a horizontal platform under the objective lens on which the object to be viewed is placed.
Usually there is a converging micro which serves to concentrate light on the object.
The object to be magnified is placed in front of the objective such that the object distance you is greater than the focal length of the objectives.
This forms a magnified, inverted and real image of the object at I, as illustrated in Fig.
5.9 Fig.
5.9: A compound microscope 476PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS If the eye piece is adjusted correctly, I , will fall between the eyepiece 1 and its principal focus f as shown.
Then a magnified and virtual image e of I , will be produced at I .
Hence, the eye piece behaves just like a 1 2 magnifying glass.
The final image of an object produced by a compound microscope is highly magnified and inverted.
The observer can adjust the eyepiece so as to obtain distance of about 25 cm (least distance of distinct vision for normal eye).
The magnifying power M of the compound microscope is the product of the magnification due to the two lenses.
That is, magnification M = M 1 X M where M, is the magnification produced by the objective lens and 2 M is the magnification produced by the eyeprice.
Thus, a microscope 2 with a magnifying power of 300 will show an object 300 times as large as it would appear to the naked eye from a distance of 25 cm.
3.4 The Telescope The telescope is an instrument for viewing distant objects such as the stars and planets.
There are many types of telescopes in use but, basically, a telescope is either designed to be used for observing objects on the earth’s surface - the terrestrial telescope or for observing celestial objects- the astronomical telescope.
All telescopes consists of objective convex lens or concave mirror of long focal length because of the distance of the objects to be viewed and an eyepiece lens of short focal length for producing magnified image.
3.4.1 The Astronomical Telescope An astronomical telescope is used to view very distant objects like the planets and the stars.
It makes use of two convex lenses O and E as its objectives and eyepiece respectively as earlier stated.
The objective has a long focal length and the eyepiece a short focal length.
Owing to the great distance of the object from the telescope, the light rays from any point on the object are very nearly parallel on reaching the objective.
Astronomical telescope can either be adjusted such that its image is formed at infinity (normal adjustment) or at a fairly near point.
For instance i.
When the final image is formed at infinity as illustrated in Fig.
5.10 the telescope is said to be in normal adjustment.
477PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
5.10: An astronomical telescope in normal adjustment In such an adjustment, the two lenses are arranged such that the distance between them is equal to the sum of their individual focal lengths ( fo+ fe).
In this case, the objective lens converges parallel rays from all points in the object and forms a real, inverted and diminished image I 1 on its focal plane.
The focus of the eyepiece coincides with that of the objective.
Therefore, the eyepiece forms a virtual image of this image (which now serves as object) at the focal plane at infinity and this is the image that will be seen by the eye.
Hence the total length of the telescope is the sum of the focal lengths of the objectives and the eyepiece.
In other words, if the position of the eyepiece is adjusted such that I 1 (the real image) is made to fall on the principal focus of the eyepiece, the final image will be formed at infinity ii.
On the other hand, an astronomical telescope can also be adjusted such that its image is formed at a fairly near point to the eyepiece.
In this case, the position of the eyepiece is adjusted such that I, (the normal image) falls between the eyepiece and its principal focus fe, a magnified and virtual image of I, is then formed at I 2 as illustrated in Fig.
5.11.
478PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
5.11: Final image at near point astronomical telescope Here, the eyepiece of the astronomical telescope performs exactly the same function as the eyepiece of the compound microscope.
You can see from Figs.
5.10 and 5.11 that the final image of the object produced by an astronomical telescope is inverted.
The magnification produced by the astronomical telescope is given by the ratio of the angle subtended at the eye by the image of a distant object when a telescope is used to the angle subtended at the unaided eye by a distant object.
That us, the angular magnification of the telescope.
This angular magnification is given by M = a/a where a = h/fe and a = h/fo where fe and fo are the eyepiece and objective focal lengths respectively (Figs.
5.10 and 5.11) and h is the height of the real image I.
This implies that magnification M= fo / fe.
479PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.4.2 Reflecting Astronomical Telescope This is another form of astronomical telescope.
It makes use of a large concave parabolic mirror with a polished coating of aluminum on the reflecting surface.
The concave parabolic mirror serves as the objective of the telescope.
It has a large diameter that enables it to gather a lot of light and also a long focal length which enhances increase in magnification of the image in order to reveal minor details in the object.
The use of these two properties – large diameter and long focal length of concave mirrors are not easily obtained in convex lenses.
This telescope is very effective in the sense that it is able to collect as much light rays as possible from distant stars and planets thereby produces a fairly sharp image.
Therefore, the most powerful telescopes are the reflecting ones.
Parallel rays from a distant object are reflected at the objective concave mirrors.
These reflected rays are intercepted by a small plane mirror before they form a real image I (Fig.
5.
12).
This image is magnified in 1 the usual way by the eyepiece coverging lens Fig .5.12: Reflecting astronomical telescope Telescopes that use concave mirror as objectives are referred to as reflector or refectory telescopes while those that use lens as objectives are called a refractor or refracting telescope.
3.4.3 The Terrestrial Telescope This is a modified astronomical telescope for viewing distant objects on the earth surface.
The difference between the terrestrial telescope and the astronomical telescope is that a convex lens is put in between the objective and the eyepiece so that a final image in erect position, but with the size unchanged is obtained.
480PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS For instance, if a convex lens C of a suitable short focal length fc is placed at a distance d= fo+ 2fc from the objective as illustrated in Fig.
5.13 a, magnified and erect image will be produced by the eyepiece.
Fig.
5.13: Terrestrial telescope In the terrestrial telescope, the lens C acts as an erecting lens and re- inverts the image I , formed by the objective.
The re- inverted image I 1 2 falls at the distance 2fc from C and is of the same size as I The 1. eyepiece is adjusted such that a magnified image of 1 is obtained.
The 2 final image I observed is an erect image of the object.
3 The terrestrial telescope is longer than the astronomical telescope by four times the focal length of the erecting lens.
Also, distant objects appear near and in their natural orientation (that is, upright) when viewed through the terrestrial telescope.
3.4.4 The Galilean Telescope The Galilean telescope uses convex lens of long focal length as the objective and a concave lens of short focal length as the eyepiece.
Parallel rays from distant object refracted by the objective lens are supposed to form a real image I , at its principle focus, fo.
But, before 1 this image could be formed, the concave eyepiece intercepts the converging rays and makes them to diverge as illustrated in Fig.
5.14.
481PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
5.14: The Galilean telescope Thus, the eyepiece forms an erect, virtual and magnified image at I2 .
In this situation, the distance between the two lenses, mounted on common axes is equal to the difference between their focal lengths (ie, d = fo- fe).
Thus, the distance between the objective and the eyepiece in a Galilean telescope is approximately the difference in their focal length (fo-fe) this design is often mounted in pairs for low power binocular used as “opera glasses” and night glasses.
They give a very small field of view except with very low magnifications, but as they only use two lenses to give an erect image, the light loses within them are relatively small.
3.4.5 The Prism Binoculars The prism binoculars consist of a pair of astronomical telescopes each of which is fitted with two right – angled isosceles prisms.
The arrangement of the two prisms serves a similar function to that of the erecting lens of a terrestrial telescope.
That is, they revert the image formed by the objective and present an erect image of the object to the viewer.
That is, in the prismatic binoculars, each side consists of an astronomical telescope effectively folded in three.
One half of this arrangement of astronomical telescope is illustrated in Fig.
5.15.
Fig.
5.15: Action of one half of prism binoculars 482PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The re- inversion of the image is done in two stages, by two lateral inversions using 45o reflecting prisms which in addition to laterally inverting as a mirror would do, also displace the rays sidewards so that they return along the next limb.
The two prisms are set so that the right - angle edges are horizontal and vertical in the figure- not parallel to one another The first prisms P turns the real inverted image formed by the objective in a horizontal direction (turns the image round and corrects for lateral inversion ) while the second prism Q turns this image the right way up).
This erect image of the object is presented to the eyepiece which subsequently magnifies it.
Without the prisms the image would be upside down and laterally inverted.
The major advantage of prism binoculars is that they can give wide field of view with a reasonable high magnification.

Specifically, you will learn about the white light spectrum, its combination and production.
You will also learn about the primary, secondary and complementary colours.
In addition you will learn about mixing of colour pigments (paints), colours of object in white lights and light filters.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the time you finish this unit, you will be able to: • obtain the spectrum of white light • show dispersion of white light by a triangular prism • explain the formation of rainbow and why objects appear the way they do.
486PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Concept of Dispersion of Light Dispersion as you know is the breaking up of or separation of white light into its component colours when it is passed through a glass prism.
It is due to the fact that different colours of white light travel at different speeds through the glass.
As a result of which each colour is refracted in a slightly different direction or angle through the glass.
That is each colour has its own wavelength, velocity and refractive index of refraction.
Thus, white light is split up into seven colours: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.
We remember these colours by picking the first letter of each colour to form ‘ROYGBIV.‘ 3.2 White Light Spectrum When a ray of light is inclined obliquely on a glass prism, it emerges deviated and separated into its component colours- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet (ROYGBIV), due to refraction.
These colours resulting from the separation (i.e.
dispersion) of white light make up the spectrum which is generally referred to as the white light spectrum.
Sir Isaac Newton was the first to observe in an experiment that when white light is passed through a prism, an elongated coloured patch of light is obtained on a screen placed behind the prism.
This coloured pattern now referred to as the spectrum of white light consists of the Red, Orange, yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (ROYGBIV) earlier mentioned.
An observation of the spectrum shows that the red light is deviated least while the violet light is deviated most.
Because red is deviated least from its original direction in air, its change of speed on entering glass is least and as such its speed in glass is greatest .Violet is deviated most on entering glass and it has the least speed has in glass.
The white light spectrum is illustrated in Fig.
7.1.
Fig.
7.1: Dispersion of white light resulting into the white light spectrum 487PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS If another identical prism is placed to intercept the refracted rays as shown in Fig.
7.2 a, the same arrangement of colours will energy on the screen.
This time, however, the colours will be more widely separated.
On the other hand, if the second prism is inverted as shown in Fig.
7.2b, the colours will disappear and only a patch of white light will be visible on the screen Fig.
7.2 a: Dispersion of white light spectrum Fig.
7.2b: Recombination of white light spectrum The disappearance of the colours was due to their recombination to reproduce white light.
Hence white light spectrum is the band of colours formed when white light passes through a prism.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Divide a circular disc into seven parts and paint each part with one of the ROYGBIV colours (Fig.
7.3).
Fig.
7.3: Newton’s colour disc Spin the colour disc to make it rotate at high speed.
You will observe that the colours are mixed.
These colours you can see seem to be white.
488PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Now slow down the rotation of the disc.
As you do this, you will notice the individual colours again.
Monochromatic light You should note that if light of one wavelength (α) and colour (monochromatic) is passed through a prism refraction; occurs without dispersion.
That is, if red light passes through a prism it will come out as red light (Fig.
7.4).
prism Red light Red light Fig.
7.4: No dispersion with monochromatic light 3.3 Production of Pure Spectrum Have you noticed that the spectrum produced by a prism (Fig.
7.1) is an impure spectrum because the different colours overlap.
If you have not, perform that simple experiment illustrated in Fig.
7.1 to observe the spectrum.
A pure spectrum is that in which the colours are clearly separated or distinct from each other.
To produce such a pure spectrum, prism is used in combination with converging lenses of as shown in Fig.
7.5 below.
Fig.
7.5: Production of pure white light spectrum 489PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS The apparatus consists of these components – source of white light, slit, two convex lenses, one triangular prism and a screen.
The narrow slit illuminated by a bright source of white light produces a series of narrow coloured images which minimizes the chances of over lapping colours.
This sources of white light is placed at the focal point of the first lens (i) This enables the converging lens ( i) to produce a white parallel beam of light as the light incident on it are refracted.
As you already know the prism disperses the beam of light into its component colours while the converging lens (ii) collects the different colours and converges them differently on the screen.
The screen is placed at the focal plane of the converging lens (ii) so that the coloured bands of the spectrum will appear well defined while the slit is placed at the principal focus, f, of the converging lens (i) to ensure that parallel rays are produced by the lens.
Production of clear spectrum is also ensured by using a very fine slit and a bright light source.
This pure spectrum consists of Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.
Red is least deviated while Violet is the most deviated.
3.4 Primary, Secondary and complementary Colours 3.4.1 Primary Colours Primary colours are red, green and blue, they are called primary colours because it is not possible to produce them by mixing other colours.
When three primary coloured lights are mixed they produce white light.
3.4.2 Secondary Colours Secondary colours are those colours that can be obtained by mixing any two primary colours.
Examples are yellow, cyan and magenta.
They are produced by mixing two primary colurs such as • Green + blue= cyan (secondary colour) • Red + blue = magenta (secondary colour) • Green + red = yellow ( secondary colour) This is illustrated in Fig.
7.6 below.
490PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
7.6: Additive colour - mixing of lights 3.
4.3 Complementary Colours If two colours, one primary and the other secondary are such that when mixed give white colour, then they are said to be complementary colours.
Examples are: • Yellow + blue = white • Cyan + red = white • Magenta + green = white This is also illustrated in Fig.
7.5 above.
3.5 Mixing of Coloured Pigments (paints) In contrast to the mixing of colored light, when blue and yellow paints are mixed, the result is green not white.
The colours of pigments (paints) are the result of the kinds of light they reflect.
For instance, yellow paint reflects red, yellow and green light and absorbs the rest.
On the other hand, blue paint reflects blue and green light and absorbs the rest.
But, when yellow and blue paints are mixed the only colour reflected by both components of the mixture is green, which is thus the colour of the mixture.
This mixture of paints is known as colour mixing by subtraction (Fig.
7.7) it is different from mixing of coloured lights which are pure colours called mixing by addition 491PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
7.7: Subtractive colour -mixing of paints The primary colours for paints unlike lights are red, yellow and blue.
They are the basis for all other colours of paint and cannot be produced by mixing.
When a primary colour is mixed with a secondary colour on the opposite side of the triangle, the result will be black as shown in Fig.
7.7.
3.6 Colours of Objects The colours of objects in white and coloured lights depend on the colours in the light incident or falling on them and also on the absorption and reflection of these lights by the objects.
A white object appears white in daylight because it reflects equally all the colours of the spectrum.
Also the colours of opaque objects seen are the colours of light that are reflected.
The following are some examples: • Rose flower appears red because it reflects red light and absorbs the other colours • White objects reflect all the colours of the spectrum and appear white.
• Black objects absorb all the colours of spectrum and appear black.
That is, objects appear to be of a certain colour because they reflect light of those colours and absorb the rest.
Primary colours will reflect or transmit only their respective colours.
Other colours will reflect or transmit other colours along with their own colours Light filters are transparent- coloured sheets which allow light of the colour of the filter to pass through while absorbing all other colours in 492PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS the incident light they are made of gelatin and coloured with various dyes.
3.7 Light Filters Filter papers are used to absorb light of various colours from the spectrum of white light.
Generally, a filter paper absorbs all other colours except that of the filter.
For instance; • When a red filter is placed on the path of white light, only red light passes through ; • When a green filter is placed on the path of a red light, no light passes through.
Hence, there is a black appearance.
An unusual situation occurs when a yellow filter is placed on the path of white light.
This time all other colours are absorbed except yellow, green and red.
Subtractive colour- mixing also results from the super- position of two colour filters.
A combination of two filters results in the transmission of only those colours which are common to both of them.
3.8 Formation of Rainbow Have you seen a rainbow before?
It is a natural phenomenon sometimes seen after a rain.
It is formed in the same way as a spectrum is formed by a glass prism.
Here, rain drops or drops of water suspended in the air after rainfall act as prisms which disperse the white beam of light into seven colours of the rainbow.
The viewer can see the rainbow only if he is in a position to receive the refracted rays of the sunlight.
This is illustrated in Fig.
7.8.
493PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Sometimes, two rainbows are seen namely the primary and the secondary rainbows i.
The Primary Rainbow The primary rainbow is brighter than the secondary rainbow.
It is caused by light rays which undergo one internal reflection inside the rain drop.
When a horizontal light ray enters a water droplet at point A, dispersion takes place (Fig.
7.9 a) At R , the coloured rays undergo total internal 1 reflection and they exist from the water droplet at B where further refraction occurs.
The violet ray is refracted the most and the red ray the least.
The red ray which emerges from each droplet makes a larger angle of about 42o with the horizontal than the violet ray that makes about angle 40 o also with the horizontal.
a.
One internal b, Two internal reflections reflection inside inside droplet droplet Fig.
7.9: Formation of rainbow- dispersion of sunlight by rain drops Other droplets seen by the observer at the same angle with the horizontal produce the same colour.
Hence, an arc of the colour, red is seen by the observer.
Other coloured rays emerge at different angles to the horizontal.
Thus, an arc of coloured bands- the rainbow – is seen in the sky.
This band has red on its outer edge and violet on the inner edge (Fig.
7.10).
494PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS Fig.
7.10: Primary and secondary rainbows ii.
The Secondary Rainbow Secondary rainbows may occasionally be seen in addition to the primary ones.
This is caused by light rays which undergo two internal reflections inside the rain drops.
This causes the coloured bands of such rainbow to be in the reverse order.
That is, it has violet on its outer edge and red on its inner edge ( Fig.
7.10) .
In the secondary rainbow , the red rays are at angle of 50o and the violet rays at 540 to the horizon 3.9 The Electromagnetic Spectrum You have seen that the spectrum of white light obtained from sun- light consists of seven colours.
Beyond each end of this coloured spectrum (visible light) are the invisible rays (spectrum) of radiant energy called infra-red and ultraviolet rays.
These rays are also emitted by the sun.
These rays cannot be seen but they cause certain materials to 495PHY 001 ACCESS PHYSICS fluorescence and also affect photographic plates.
They are known as ultra-violet rays.
Radio waves, infra-red rays, the visible rays (from red to violet) ultra- violet rays, x-rays and gamma rays are all electromagnetic waves.
These waves make up the electromagnetic spectrum.
They all travel through a vacuum with exactly the same speed and differ only in having different wavelengths.

The secondary colours are yellow, cyan and magenta • Paint (pigments) are mixed by a process of subtractive colour- mixing.
The primary colours for paint are red, yellow and blue.
• Light filters are transparent coloured sheets which allow light of the colour of the filter to pass through while absorbing all other colours in the incident light.
• The rainbow is caused by dispersion of sunlight by water droplets left suspended in the air by the rain • The electromagnetic spectrum is made up of radio waves, infrared rays, the visible rays (from red to violet), ultra- violet rays, x-ray and gamma rays.
