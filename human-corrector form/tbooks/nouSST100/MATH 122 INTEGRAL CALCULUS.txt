TABLE OF CONTENT INTRODUCTION WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS COURSE COURSE AIM COURSE OBJECTIVES WORKING THROUGH THIS COURSE COURSE MATERIALS STUDY UNITS TEXTBOOKS ASSESSMENT TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENT COURSE OVERVIEW INTRODUCTION This course is the second of the two calculus courses that you are required to study.
In the introduction of calculus, you were informed about the importance of the course calculus to humanity.
Also you were informed about those categories of students which need calculus as a working tool for their respective programmes in the National Open University of Nigeria.
Therefore, in this introduction, you might not be told what you are already familiar with about the subject calculus.
However, for emphasis, the second course of calculus deals with the branch of calculus known as ‘Integral Calculus’ or ‘anti-differential calculus’.
Interestingly, this second course in calculus happens to be the first that was known to the early mathematicians in the sense that the study of computation of areas under a curve is older than the study of differential calculus.
If you know the distance function of a moving object you can find the velocity by differentiating the distance functions.
In this place you will be given the velocity and will be required to find the distance a body travels within a specific interval of time.
In other words, integral calculus deals with the inverse operation of differentiation.
It extends the concept of addition to enable you to find the sum of a continuously changing quantities then integration continues where finding the sum of changing quantities by discrete method fails.
Thus integral calculus is widely used in most situation that requires finding the sum of quantities like computing the areas under curves, volumes generated by rotating certain solids along their axis of symmetry, the length of arc, work done by moving a body along a straight line etc.
NOUN 3MTH 122 Integral Calculus In this course, you will study one of the major applications of integral calculus, learn the computation of areas under one or more curves.
In unit 1 you will be introduced to the simple numerical method of computing area under a curve.
Then in unit 9 the use of integration will be introduced in finding the areas bounded by curves.
The relationship between the area under a curve and the definition of definite integration was what lead to the symbol Ѕ of integration to be an elongated S, where S stands for a sum.
As was done in calculus, I emphasis has been placed on the technique of integration so that you can narrow your guess work appreciably.
The solved examples provided throughout in the study units will enable you work through the course effortlessly.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THE COURSE.
In this course, you will learn how to compute areas under a curve.
You learn theorem (without proof) that connects integration and differentiation and called them inverse operations to each other i.e.
integration is the inverse operation of differentiation.
You will use this theorem which is known as fundamental theorem of integral calculus to develop techniques of indefinite integration.
You will learn how to use integration to compute the areas bounded by two curves, the volume generated by solid of revolution, the distance covered by a moving body with a known constant velocity etc.

STRATEGIES FOR STUDYING THE COURSE Integration involves finding a function whose denuative is the integrand.
As such it involves certain level of guess work.
In view of this, you are required to spend much time reviewing your differential calculus and trigonometry functions.
Thus NOUN 6MTH 122 Integral Calculus differential calculus is a necessary tool you need to develop your skills in techniques of integration.
Therefore, you are required to spend 4 hours or more studying each unit.
Because of the time required to study a unit, this course has been designed to contain only 10 units instead of 20 units.
You are required to spend about one hour or more on the solved examples of each unit.

He used ingenious methods to compute the area bounded by a parabola and a chord.
See Fig (1.1).
In this unit, you will study how to develop necessary tools of calculus to compute areas under curve as a mere routine exercise.
The area under a curve gave birth to the second branch of calculus known as integration.
The tools that will be developed here will naturally lead to the definition of integration in the next unit – unit 2.
Recall that the word to integrate connotes “whole of” which could be interpreted to mean “find the whole area of”.
This concept is what will be introduced in this unit and this will be fully developed in the next unit.
NOUN 9MTH 122 Integral Calculus 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to correctly i. approximate area under a curve by the sum of areas of rectangles inscribed in the curve.
ii.
approximate the area under a curve by the sum of the areas of rectangles circumscribed over the curve.
iii.
define a partition of a closed interval (a, b) iv.
compute the exact value of the area under a curve by the limiting process.
3.1 AREA UNDER A CURVE You are quite familiar with the computation of the areas of plane figures such as triangles, parallelogram trapezium, regular polygons etc.
Interestingly, you studied in elementary geometry that the area of a regular polygon can be computed by cutting it into triangles and sum up the areas of the triangles.
You are also aware t hat the area of a circle is p r2.
This formula was derived by the method of limit.
You could recall that the limit of the areas of inscribed regular polygons as the number of sides approaches infinity is equal to the area of the circle.
See Fig.
1.2 a-c Inscribed polygons Inscribed polygons Inscribed polygons of 4 sides of 6 sides of 8 sides Fig.
1.2a Fig.
1.2b Fig.
1.2c Let y = f(x) be a continuous function (see the first course on calculus i.e.
calculus I unit 4 for definition of continuous function) of x on a closed interval [a, b].
In this case for better understanding, you assume that the f(x) is positive in the closed interval i.e.
f(x) > 0. for all XE [a, b].
Then the problem to be considered is to calculate the area bounded by the graph y = f(x) and the vertical lines y = f(a) and y = f(b) and below by the x – axis as shown in Fig.
1.3.
NOUN 10MTH 122 Integral Calculus Y 0 X a b Fig.
1.3 You can start by dividing the area into n thin strips of uniform width Δx = (b-a) by lines perpendicular to the x – axis at the end points x = a and n x = b and many intermediate points which can be numbered as X X Xn- 1, 2, 1 (see fig 1.4).
Y f(x ) B C 1 F f(x ) 2 f(x ) n-1 A D E 0 a = X X X .
.
.
X X X X 0 1 2 n-2 n-1 n =b Fig.
1.4 The sum of the areas of these n rectangular strips gives an approximate value for the area under the curve.
To put the above more mathematically, you can define the area of each strip in terms of f(x) and x.
Given that Δx = x – a = 1 NOUN 11MTH 122 Integral Calculus x -x = .. = b-x .
For example the area of the rectangular strip ABCD in Fig.
2 1 n-1 1.4 above is given as: Area of ABCD = f(x ) .
(x -x ) = f(x ) Δx 2 1 0 2 Example: Suppose f(x) = x2-3 in Fig 1.5 with n = 6 were a = 2, b = 8, dx = 8-2 = 6 Therefore: dx = 1 i.e.
you have 6 rectangular strips.
2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Fig.
1.5 Area is given as sum of f(2) Δx = 1.1 = 1 f(3) Δx = 6.1 = 6 f(4) Δx = 13.1 = 13 f(5) Δx = 22.1 = 22 f(6) Δx = 33.1 = 33 f(7) Δx = 46.1 = 46 In fig.
1.4 above the area under the curve is larger than the sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangular strips numbered 1 to 6 i.e.
sum of areas of strips = 1+6+13+22+33+46 = 121 which is less than area under curve.
Example: Using the same example Y = x2-3 use circumscribed rectangular strips instead of inscribed ones to compute the area under the curve.
See Fig.
1.6 NOUN 12MTH 122 Integral Calculus Y 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 X 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Area is given as the sum of f(x) .
Δx = 6.1 = 6 f(x) .
Δx = 13.1 = 13 f(x) .
Δx = 22.1 = 22 f(x) .
Δx = 33.1 = 33 f(x) .
Δx = 46.1 = 46 f(x) .
Δx = 61.1 = 61 Area = 6+13+22+33+46+61 = 181 As should be expected this area is greater than the area under the curve f(x) = x2-3.
In the computation with the circumscribed rectangular strips the sides of the rectangles are assumed in this case to be the points of the function in their respective subintervals.
In the case of the inscribed rectangles, the sides of the rectangles are the minimum values of the function in their respective subintervals.
Therefore the area under the curve lies between the sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangles and the sum of the areas of the circumscribe rectangles.
This takes to the issue of limit.
Therefore it will be right to say as n α Δx 0 this implies that the NOUN 13MTH 122 Integral Calculus Lim (Max Area – Min Area) = 0 as Δx 0.
From the foregoing, you can now define the area under curve as the limit of the sums of the areas of inscribed (circumscribed) rectangles as their common base of length dx approaches zero and the number of rectangles increases without bound.
In symbols you can write the above limit as: A = lim [f(x ) Δx + f(x ) Δx +..+ f(x )] Δx n ∞ 0 7 n-1 = lim [f(x ) Δx + f(x ) f +..+ f(x )] Δx n ∞ 1 2 n-1 OR n-1 n A = lim ∑ f(x ) dx = lim ∑ (fx ) dx k k n x n x 1K=10 1 K=1 Exercise: Repeat the above example using n = 10.
Find the difference between the sum of areas of the inscribed rectangle (i.e.
the minimum area) and the sum of areas of the circumscribed rectangles (i.e.
the maximum area).
3.2 PARTITION OF A CLOSED INTERVAL Let [a, b] be a bounded closed interval of real numbers.
A partition of a closed interval [a, b] is a finite set of points P = {a = x , x , x , .., x , x } where 0 1 2 n-1 n-b a = x < x < x < .. < x , x = b 0 1 2 n-1 n Example: P = {0 1/6, 1/3, ½, 2/3, 5/6, 1} and , Q = {0, ¼, ½, ¾, 13 are both partition of {0, 13} PUQ = {0, 1/6, ¼ , 1/3, ½ , 2/3, ¾, 5/6 1} is a partition of [0, 1] PnQ = {0, ½, 1} is a partition of [0,1] See fig.

r-1 r Given a partition of P[a = x , x , …, x = b] the length of the subinterval s are 0 2 n the same and it is denoted by Δx = x- x r r r-1 This equal to the length of the interval [a, b] divided by the number of subintervals n i.e.
Δx = b – a r n Example: Δx for p is 1 – 0 = 1/6 6 Δx for Q is 1 – 0 = ¼ 4 Not in all case you will get subintervals of the same length.
Example is PUQ The length of x – X = 1/6 – 0 = 1/6 1 0 The length of x – X = ¼ - 1/6 = 1/12 2 1 NOUN 15MTH 122 Integral Calculus Such partitions in which the subintervals are not of the same length are called irregular partition.

You have studied that as the number of partitions of a closed interval [a, b] is increased without bound the value of the sum of the areas of the rectangles (inscribed or circumscribed) approaches the exact value of the NOUN 19MTH 122 Integral Calculus area under the curve in the given interval [a, b] that is the limit of the sum of areas of the rectangles is equal to the exact area under the given curve as the number n of partition tends to infinity or the length dx of the subinterval of the partition tends to zero.

Using the above estimate you applied the concept of limit to get the exact value of the area under a curve.
These methods were applied to functions or graphs that could easily be sketched i.e.
not too complicated functions.
In this unit, you will be introduced to the famous path taken by Leibniz and Newton in showing how exact areas can be computed easily by using integral calculus.
It is necessary you refer once more to unit 1 of this course before embarking on this one.
It will help you have a proper grasp of this unit if you do so.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to:  Define the definite integral of a function within an interval [a, b].
 Evaluate definite integrals of function.
 State the fundamental theorem of integral calculus.
3.0 DEFINITION OF DEFINITE INTEGRAL In unit 1, you studied that the sum of the areas of inscribed rectangles gives a lower (minimum) approximation of the area under the curve of the function f(x).
If you list all the values of the function f(x) in a given interval [a, b] and take the least among these value you will have what is known as the infimum of f(x) for all xЄ [a, b] NOUN 22MTH 122 Integral Calculus i.e.
Inf f(x) XЄ[a, b].
let Inf f(x) = M and XЄ P[a, b] r when dx = x-x .
then the area is M. dx.
The sum of such area is r r r-1 r r A = ∑ M (x – x ) is called the Lower Sum of the function f(x).
L r r r-1 If you take the maximum value of f(x) within [a, b] and find their areas i.e.
M = ∫up f(x) XЄ [x x] then the Upper sum for the areas is given as r r-1 r A = ∑ M(x – x ) u r r r-1 r=1 No known concept has been introduced.
You are rewriting sum of areas of a rectangles inscribed under the curve f(x) as A = ∑ M (x – x ) and the sum L r r r-1 of areas of rectangles circumscribed over f(x) as A = ∑M x – x ) u r r r-1 Once you keep the fact you will not run into any difficulty understanding what follow next.
Definition: The unique number I which satisfies the inequality A (P)≤ I ≤ A (P) for all partitions P of [a, b] is called the definite L u integral (or more simply the integral of f on [a, b] and is written as: I = ∫bf(x)dx a This symbol Ѕ dates back to Leibniz and it is called he integral sign.
It is an elongated S, which represents sum.
The numbers in this case are called the limits of integration.
The expression ∫ b f(x) dx (read integrating from b to a a with respect to x) In the above definition, it has been assumed that f(x) is continuous in the closed [a, b].
This condition guarantee the existence of a number I such that A (p) ≤ I ≤ A (p) L L The prove of the above theorem could be found in the text suggested for further reading given at the end of this course.
A If f(x) ≥ 0 X Є[a, b] then I = ∫bf(x)dx = Area under the curve f(x) NOUN 23MTH 122 Integral Calculus a Example A Given that f(x) = K XЄ[a, b] show that ∫bf(x)dx = K(b – a) a Solution: Let P = {u, x , x , x , .., x = b} be any partition of [a, b] o 1 2 n A Since f(x) = K XЄ [a, b] the f(x ) = f(x ) = … = f(x ) 0 1 n Let A (P) = ∑ m∆X = K∆X + K + ∆X +..K∆X L r 1 2 n = K(∆X +...+∆X ) = K(b-a) 1 n Also A (P) = ∑M∆X = K(b-a) u r r But A (P) ≤ ∫bf(x)dx ≤ A (P) L u a then K(b-a) ≤ ∫bf(x)dx ≤ K(b-a) a ∫bf(x)dx = K(b-a) Example Given that f(x) = x show that ∫bxdx = ½ (b2-a2) a Solution: Let P{ax x , .. , x , = b} be an arbitrary partition of [a, b].

Either by the limiting process discussed in unit or by direct evaluation as was done in the previous section.
Such process might prove very laborious for certain classes of functions.
In this section you will examine the direct connection between differential calculus and integral calculus.
This connection was made possible by looking at the summation process of finding areas and volumes and the differentiation process of finding the scope of a target to a curve.
It is quite interesting that the process of carrying out inverse differentiation yields an easy tool of solving the summation problem.
So you will now discuss the proof of the fundamental theorem concept behind the theorem is that before you can evaluate a definite integral Sbf(x)dx you will first of all find a function Fl(x) whose derivative is f(x).
i.e.
a A F1(x) = f(x) XЄ (A, B).
You will now as first step study the proof of the following theorem: NOUN 26MTH 122 Integral Calculus Theorem 1: If f(x) is a continuous function on [a, b], the function F(x) defined on [a, b] by setting F(x) = ∫xf(t) dt a is a(i) continuous function on [a, b] and (ii) satisfies F1(x) = f(x) for all x in (a, b).
Proof: You will begin with xЄ [a, b] and show that Lim F(x+h) – F(x) = f(x) h O- h In figure 2.1 F(x +h) = area from a to x + h f(x) f(x+h) F(x) 0 a x h x+h b F(x) = area from a to x F(x + h) - F(x) = area from x to x + h (Area = base x height) F(x + h) – F(x) = area from x to x + h f(x) if h 0 h h (note f(x) = height of the area under curve in Fig.
2.1 If x < x + h ≤ b then F(x+h) – F(x) = ∫x+hf(t)dt – ∫xf(t)dt a a (since from statement of theorem F(x) = ∫xf(t)dt) a It follows therefore that F(x+h) – F(x) = ∫x+h(f(t)dt + ∫af(t)dt a x = ∫x+h(f(t)dt x Let M = maximum value of f(x) on [x, x+h] h and m = minimum value of f(x) on [x, x+h ] h NOUN 27MTH 122 Integral Calculus since M (x+h – x) = M .h h h and m (x+h – x) = m .h h h therefore, M = upper sum (see UNIT 1) h and m = lower sum (see UNIT 1) h therefore m .h ≤ ∫x+hf(t)dt ≤ M .h h h x = m .h ≤ F(x+h – F(x) ≤ M h h h. h since f(x) is a continuous function on [x, x + h] therefore Lim m .h = f(x) = lim M .h h h h 0- h 0- thus lim F(x+h) – F(x) = f(x) .
I h 0 h In a similar manner you can show that if X Є (a, b), then Lim F(x+h) – F(x) = f(x) I h 0+ h Now if xЄ (a, b) then equation (I) and (II) hold Thus Lim F(x+h) – F(x) = f(x) H 0 h and lim F(x+h) – F(x) = F1 (x) h 0 h therefore F1(x) = f(x) since F1(x) exists then F(x) must be continuous on (a, b).
Before you prove the fundamental theorem of calculus.
Look at this definition.
Definition: A function F(x) is called an anti-derivative for f(x) on (a. b) if and only if (i) F(x) is continuous on (a, b) and (ii) F1(x) = f(x) for all XЄ (a, b) Using the above definition you can rewrite theorem 1 as NOUN 28MTH 122 Integral Calculus If f is continuous on (a, b) then F(x) = ∫xf(t)dt The above now says to you that you can construct or find an anti-derivative for f(x) by integration f(x).
The next theorem you are going to study will tell you that you can evaluate the definite integral ∫hf(x)dx by finding an anti-derivative for f(x).
a The Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus: Let f(x) be continuous for all xЄ (a, b) If P(x) is an anti-derivative of f(x) for all xЄ (a, b) then ∫af(x)dx = P(b) – P(a) a Proof: In theorem 1, the function F(x) = ∫xf(t)dt a is an anti-derivative for f(x) for all XЄ (a, b).
If P(x) is another anti-derivative for f(x) for all xЄ (a, b), then it implies that both P(x) and F(x) are continuous for all XЄ (a, b) and also will satisfy that P1(x) = F1(x) for all XЄ (a, b).
There exist a constant C such that F(x) – P(x) = C Since F1(x) = P1(x) and derivative of a constant is zero i.e.
F(x) – P(x) = C F1(x) – P1(x) = 0 Since F(a) = 0 then P(a) + C = 0 and C = -P(a) This implies that F(x) = P(x) – P(a) for all XЄ (a, b) Thus F(h) = P(b – P(a) (x = b) Since F(b) = ∫bf(t)dt = P(b)-P(a) a which is the required result.
3.3 EVALUATION OF DEFINITE INTEGRAL You are now set to seek or construct anti-derivates F(x) which will evaluate the definite integral given as ∫bf(x)dx NOUN 29MTH 122 Integral Calculus a Example: Find ∫bxdx a Solution Let F(x) = ½x2 as an anti-derivative Then ∫bxdx = ½ (b2 – a2) a Find the ∫bxndx when n is a positive integral the anti-derivative to use is a F(x)= 1 xn+1 n+1 F1(x) = xn ∫bxn = F(b) – F(a) a = 1 (bn+1 – aa+1) n+1 Notation: ∫bf(x)dx = [F(x)]b = F(b) – F(a) a a thus ∫bx4dx [ 1 x4+1]b = 1/5 (b5 – a5) a 4+1 a Example: ∫2(6x5-2x3-x)dx Let F(x) = x6 – 2x4 – x2 4 2 then ∫2(6x5 – 2x3 – x)dx = [x6 – 1x4 – x2]4 1 2 2 1 = 3960.

hyperbolic functions and then inverses, exponent and logarithm functions.
All these you studied in the first course in calculus.
However, the reverse process i.e.
anti-differentiation is some how not as straight forward process as the differentiation.
The reasons being that there are no systematic rules or procedures for anti-differentiation.
Rather success on techniques of anti-differentiation depends much more on your familiarity with differentiation itself.
So before embarking on the study of this unit, it might be worth the time to practice some of the differentiation in calculus I.
Do not be discouraged when you come across functions whose derivatives are not very common.
In this unit and subsequent ones you will study some basic methods of anti-differentiation.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: (i) evaluate indefinite integral as anti-differentiation.
(ii) Recall notations for integration and (iii) Recall properties of indefinite integration (iv) Evaluate indefinite integrals using the properties of indefinite integration.
(v) Integrate differential equations that are separable.
3.0 INDEFINITE INTEGRATION In this section an informal definition of what is anti-differentiation will be given.
Suppose that the derivative of the function is given as: dy = f(x) dx and you were asked to find the function y = F(x).
For example you are given the differential equation.
dy = 2x.
NOUN 35MTH 122 Integral Calculus dx From your experience with differentiation you can easily know that y = x2 since dy = 2x dx Interestingly, it is not only y = x2 that can be differentiated to give dy = 2x.
dx Other function like y = x2- 1, y = x2 + 2, y = x2 + a, y = x2 + 4 can be differentiated to yield dy = 2x dx In general any function of this form y = x2 + c, where C is any constant will yield a differential equation of this type dy = 2x dx You are now ready to take this definition.
Definition 1: An equation such as dy = f(x) which specifies the derivative as dx a function of x (or as a function of x and y) is called a differential equation.
For example dy = sine dx is differential equation Definition 2: A function y = F(x) is called a solution of the differential equation dy = f(x) if over domain a<xcb F(x) is differentiable and dx d F(x) = F1(x) = f(x) dx in this case F(x) is called an integral of f(x) with respect to x.
Definition 3: If F(x) is an integral of the function f(x) with respect to x so is the function F(x) + C an integral of f(x) with respect to x, where c is an arbitrary constant.
If d F(x) = f(x) so also is F(x) + C i.e.
d [F(x) + C] = dx dx d F(x) + C dc = df(x) + 0 = F1(x) = f(x) dx dx dx From the above if y = F(x) is any solution of dy = f(x) then all other solutions are contained in the formula y= F(x)+C dx where C is an arbitrary constant this gives rise to the symbol.
∫f(x) dx = F(x) + C – (1) where the symbol S is called an integral sign (see unit 2).
Equation 1 is read the integral of f(x)dx is equal to F(x) plus C since dy = 2x and a typical dx solution is F(x) = x2 + C. then d F(x) = 2x = d(x 2 +C) dx dx = y = x2 + C NOUN 36MTH 122 Integral Calculus and dy = d (x2 + C) = 2x dx dx Example: If y = x dy = 1 dx = ∫dydx = ∫1dx = x + C dx In other words, when you integrate the differential of a function you get that function plus an arbitrary constant.
Example: Solve the differential equation dy = 4x3 dx Solution: let dy = 4x3 dx then dy = 4x3dx integrate both side you get ∫dy = ∫4x3dx but d(x2)=4x3dx.
dx therefore y = ∫4x3dx = ∫d(x4) = x4 C. Example: Solve the differential equation dy = 2x + 1 dx = dy = (2x + 1) dx but d(x2 + x) = 2x + 1 dx therefore ∫dy = ∫ (2x + 1)dx becomes y = ∫ dx2 + x) = x2 + x + C. compare ∫d(F(x) ) = F(x) with the result of UNIT 2.
Example: Solve the following differential equation: (1) dy = x2 – 1 (2) dy = 1 + x dx dx x2 (3) dy = x (4) dy = 2x + 3 dx y dx (5) dy = (x2 + √x)dx (6) dy = 3x2-2x+3 dx dx (7) ds = 3t2-2t-6 (8) dv = 5u4-3xu2-1 dt du (9) dx = 8√x (10) dy = (2x2- 1) NOUN 37MTH 122 Integral Calculus dt dx x2 Solution: dy = x2- 1 dx = dy (x2 – 1)dx ∫dy = S(x2-1)dx but d( x 3 – x) = (x2-1)dx 3 therefore: y = ∫d( x 3 -x) = x 3 – x +C 3 3 (2) dy = 1 + x dx x2 ∫dy = S(1 + x)dx x2 d(-1 + x 2 ) = (1 + x) dx x 2 x2 y = ∫d( x 2 – 1) = x 2 - 1 + c 2 x 2 x (3) dy = x dx y ∫ydy = ∫x dx d( y 2 ) = ydy and d( x 2 ) = xdx 2 2 therefore: ∫ydy = ∫d(y2) 2 ∫d( y 2 ) = ∫d( x 2 ) 2 2 = y 2 = x 2 + C 1 2 2 y2 = x2 + 2C 1 y2 = x2 + C NOUN 38MTH 122 Integral Calculus (4) dy = 2x + 3 dx ∫dy = ∫ (2 + 3) dx y = ∫d(x2 + 3x) = x2 + 3x + C (5) dy = (x2 + √x) dx dy = (x2 + √x) dx ∫dy = ∫ (x2 + √x)dx y = ∫d( x 3 + 2x3/2) = x 3 + 2x3/2 + C 3 3 3 3 (6) dy = 3x2 – 2x – 5 dx dy = 3x2 – 2x – 5 ∫dy = ∫ (3x3-x2-5x) = x3-x2-5x+C (7) ds = 3t2 – 2t - 6 dt ∫ds = ∫ (3t2 – 2t – 6)dt ∫ = ∫d(t3-t2-6t) = t3- t2 – 6t + C (8) dv = 5u4 – 3u2 - 1 du ∫dv = ∫ (5u4 – 3u2- 1)du V = ∫d(u5- U3 – U) = U5 – U3 – U + C (9) dx = 8√x dt dt dx = 8√x dt = ∫dx = ∫8 dt √x ∫d(2√x) = ∫d(8t) 2√x + C = 8t + C x t 2√x = 8t + C + C x t NOUN 39MTH 122 Integral Calculus 2√x = 8t + C, where C = C + C x t (10) dy = (4x2 – 1) dx x2 ∫dy = ∫ (4x2 – 1)dx x y = ∫d( 4x 3 – 1) = 4x 3 – 1 + C 3 x 3 x Exercise: Evaluate the following: (1) ∫dx (2) ∫ (x + 1)3dx x5 (3) ∫ (ax2 +b)dx (4) ∫ ( x 3 + 1 ) dx x6 (5) ∫ ( x 3 – 1 )dx (6) ∫ (t2 – a) (t2 – b)dt x2 (7) ∫ (√x – 1)dx (8) ∫ (5x)4dx x1/3 x5 (9) ∫dx (10) ∫ (x – 1)2 + 1 )dx √1+x (x+2)2 Ans: (1) -1 4x4+C (2) ¼ (x + 3)4 + C (3) 1/3ax3 + bx + C (4) -1 5x 3 + 2 + C 10 x5 (5) ½ (x 3 + 2) (6) 1t5+ 1(b-a)t3 – abt + C x 5 3 (7) 2/3 x3/2 – 3/2 x2/3 + C (8) 125 + C 3x15 (9) 2√x + 1 + C (10) 1/3(x – 1)3 – 1 + C (x+1) 7.1 Properties of Indefinite Integral NOUN 40MTH 122 Integral Calculus So far, you would have been doing much of guess work to find an appropriate anti-derivative that will fit the answers above you will now be given some properties of indefinite integral.

∫du = u + c (2) A constant may be moved across the integral sign Sadu = aSdu 1 (3) The integral of the sum of two differentials is the sum of their integrals ∫ (du + dv) = ∫du + ∫dv (4) The integral of difference of two differential is the difference of their integrals ∫ (du - dv) = ∫du - ∫dv (5) As a consequent of 2, 3 and 4 above, you have that ∫a(du ± dv) = a∫du ± a ∫dv ∫du ± du ± du …du = ∫du ± ∫du ± .. ± ∫du 1 2 3 h 1 2 h (7) If n is not equal to minus 1, the integral of Undu is obtained by adding one to the exponent dwindling by the new exponent and adding an arbitrary constant ∫undu = U n+1 = C n + 1 Find the following Example (1) ∫ (5x10 – x8 + 2x)dx = ∫5x10dx – ∫x8dxt ∫2xdx = 5x 10+1 – x 8+1 + 2x 1+1 10+1 8+1 1+1 = 5x11 – x 9 + x2 + C 11 9 (2) ∫x3/2dx = x 3/2+1 = x 5/2 3/ +1 5/ 2 2 = 2/5 x5/2 (3) ∫ 3x + 1dx Let u = 3x+1 NOUN 41MTH 122 Integral Calculus then du = 3 = du = 3dx dx Therefore ∫√3x+1dx = ∫u1/2 du 3 here dx = du 3 therefore 1/3Su1/2 du = 1/3 u 1/2+1 ½+1 = 1 2u3/2 = 2U3/2 3 3 9 = 2(3x+1) 9 (4) ∫√- 1 dx Let U = 4x – 1 du = 4 = dx = du dx 4 then ∫√4x-1dx = ∫u1/2 du 4 ¼ ∫u1/2 du = U 1/2+1 = 2(4x-1)3/2 + C ½+1 12 Examples: Evaluate the following integrals (i) ∫√1=4x (ii) ∫3 1 + x dx (iii) ∫ 5 2x+1 (iv) ∫ 4 4x - 2 (v) ∫ 6 6x + 4 Solution: (i) ∫ √1-4xdx let U = 1- 4x then du = 4, dx = -du dx 4 therefore ∫√1-4x dx = ∫u1/2(-du) = - ¼ ∫u1/2du = - 1 [2u3/2] = - 1(1-4x)3/2 + C 4 [3 ] 6 NOUN 42MTH 122 Integral Calculus (ii) ∫ 3 1 + x dx then du = 1 du = dx dx therefore ∫ 3 1 + x dx = ∫ u1/3du = 3u4/3 = 3(1 + x)4/3 + C 4 4 (iii) ∫ 5 2x 1 dx let U = 2x + 1 then du/dx = 2 = dx = du/2 therefore ∫ 5 2x +1 dx = ∫ U1/5 du = ½ [ 5U 6/5 ] = 5(2x+1)6/5 C 2 6 = 5(2x + 1)6/5 + C 12 (iv) ∫ 4 4x-2 dx let U = 4x - 2 then du = 4dx dx = du/4 ∫ 4 4x -2dx = ¼ ∫U1/4 du = ¼ [4/5(4x-2)5/4] = 1/5 (4x-2)5/4 (v) ∫ 6 6x+4 dx let U = 6x + 4 then dx = du/6 ∫ 6 6x+4 dx = 1/6 ∫U1/6 du = 1/6.6/7 (6x+4)7/6+C = 1/7 (6x + 4)7/6 + C Exercise: Evaluate the integrals (1) ∫ (8x7 – 6x5 – x4 + 3x3 + 2) dx (2) ∫ (6x + 1)1/6dx (3) ∫ (1 – 4x)1/4dx (4) ∫ (4 – 10x)1/10dx (5) ∫ (x – 1)1/3dx Ans: NOUN 43MTH 122 Integral Calculus (1) x8 – x6 – x 5 + 3x4 + 2x + C 5 4 (2) 1 (6x+1)7/6 + C 7 (3) -1(1 – 4x)5/4 + C 5 (4) -1(4 – 10x)11/10 + C 11 (5) 3(x – 1)4/3 + C 4 3.2 Application of Indefinite Integration Most elementary differential equation could be solved by integrating them .
Example: Solve the differential equation given as dy = f(x) dx dy = f(x) dx ∫dy = Sf(x) dx y = Sf(x) dx Such class of differential equation is used to solve various types of problems arising from Biology, all branches of engineering, physics, chemistry and economics.
In application of indefinite integral the value of the arbitrary constant must be found by applying the initial conditions of the problem that is being solved.
Therefore before continuing it is important that you know more about this arbitrary constant C. Example: Let dy = 2x dx then y = x2 + C The graph of y = x2 for C = 0 is given in Fig.
3.1 NOUN 44MTH 122 Integral Calculus Y 2 C 2+ x 1 = Y 2C + x Y= 2 = x 3 Y 2 C + x = Y 4 X C 2+ x Y= Fig.
3.1 Any other integral curve y2 + C can be obtained by shifting this curve y = x2 through a vertical displacement C. In Fig.3.1 such vertical displacements give rise to a family of parallel curves.
They are parallel since the slope of each curve is equal to 2x.
This family of curves has the property that for any given part (x , y ) where x ˛ 1D (i.e.
D is the domain of definition) there is o o o only one and only one curve from the family of curves that passes through the part (x , y ).
Hence the part (x , y ) must satisfy the equation o o o o Y = x 2 + C o o i.e.
C = y – x 2 so for any particular point (x y ) C can be uniquely o o o o be determined.
This condition that y = y and x = x imposed on the differential equation o o du/dx = 2x is referred to as initial condition.
You will use this method to solve problems on application of integration.
Example: Total profit P(x) from selling X units of a product can be determined by integrating the differential equation of the marginal profit dp/dt and using some initial conditions based on the market forces to obtain the constant of integration.

This process is summed up in the fundamental theorem of integral calculus.
For a review, consider evaluating the integral ∫f(x)dx what you have studied in unit 2 and 3 is to find a function F(x) such that d/dxF(x) = f(x) – 1 then F(x)+C = ∫f(x)dx.
The process of finding F(x) that satisfies equation 1 above is the difficult aspect and that is why differentiation is taught before integration.
So far, all you have been doing is making a good guess for the function F(x) which is dependent on how familiar you are with differentials of functions.
In this unit you will study how to make the guesswork a lot easier.
This will be done by introducing firstly the use of differentiation formulas along side their integration formulas, second, by applying some techniques that will be developed here based on the knowledge of function as well as t heir respective derivative.
Since it is the anti-derivative that gives the solution to the integral it is necessary once again you review basic rules and formulas for derivatives of function in the course calculus I.
The emphasis in this unit would be on developing skills rather than finding specific answer to any given problem.
Therefore as was done in the previous units a particular example might be solved several times with different NOUN 60MTH 122 Integral Calculus methods.
Therefore the examples in this unit have been kept fairly simple so that you would be able to develop the necessary skills expected of your.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly 1.
Recall differential formulas and their corresponding integrals 2.
Evaluate integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions 3.
Evaluate integrals involving products of even powers of sines and cosines 4. to develop techniques and methods for evaluating integrals of any function formed by functions of the trigonometric functions.
3.0 BASIC FORMULA The first requirement for skill in integration is a thorough mastery of the formulas for differentiation.
Therefore, a good starting point for you to develop the skill required of you in this course is for you to build your own table of integral.
You may make your own note in which the various sections are headed by standard form like SUndu and then under each heading include several examples to illustrate the range of application of the particular formula.
Therefore, what will be done in this unit is to list formulas for differentiation together with their integration counterparts.

/u/ u2 - 1 3.1 INTEGRATION INVOLVING POWERS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS From the above basic formula you have that: (1) ∫un du = u n+1 + C for n „ –1 n + 1 and (2) ∫un du = ln/u/+C n = 1 This could be used to evaluate integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions.
Example: Find ∫ sinn ax cos ax dx Let u = sin ax du = acos ax dx then du = cos ax dx, un = sinn ax a therefore: ∫ sinn ax cos ax dx = ∫ un du a = n n + 1 + C NOUN 62MTH 122 Integral Calculus a(n + 1) using equation (1) above you get (3) ∫ sinn ax cos ax dx = sin n+1 ax + C a(n + 1) with equation (2) you get n + 1 (4) ∫ cos ax dx = 1 ln /sin ax/+C sin ax a Interestingly this is the same result arrive at when you derive the formula for ∫ cot u du = ∫ cos ax dx = ln/sin u/ + C sin ax In a similar manner you can find ∫cosn ax sin ax dx Let u = cos ax du = -a sin ax Un = cosn ax then ∫ cosn ax sin ax dx = ∫ uu(-du) = - U n+1 C n + 1 for n ≠ 1 therefore ∫cosn ax sin ax dx = -cos n+1 ax C (n + 1)a for n = 1 ∫ sin ax dx -1ln/cosax/ + C cos ax a this is the same as ∫ tan ax dx i.e.
∫ tan ax dx = -1. ln/cos ax/ + C = 1 ln/sec ax/ + C a (see 3.2 of Unit 4) Example: Try finding ∫ sin3 x dx you find out that the above method does not work because there is cos x side of it to give d (sin x)/ therefore, another method has to be tried.
Recall that sin3x = sin2x sin x = (1 – cos2x) sin x sin3x = sin x – cos2x sin x then let u = cos x du = -sin x ∫ sin3 dx = ∫ sin x dx - ∫cos2x sin x dx = -cos x + cos 3 x + C 3 NOUN 63MTH 122 Integral Calculus The above give rise to a formula or technique for integrating odd powers of sin x or cos x i.e.
cos2n+1 x = cos2n x cos x but cos2n x = (cos2 x)n = (1 – sin2 x) therefore cos2n+1 x = (1-sin2 x)n. cos x let u = sin x du = cos x dx therefore ∫ cos2n+1 x dx = ∫ (1 – sin2 x)n cos x dx = ∫ (1 – u2) du.
What follows next is to expand the expression (1-u2) du where u = cos x smf ∫ cos2n+1x dx = -∫(1-u2)n du where u = sin x Example: Find (1) ∫cos3 x dx ii ∫ sin5 x dx Solution: ∫ cos2n+1 x dx = ∫(1 – u2)n du 2n + 1 = 3 n = 1, u = sin x therefore: ∫ cos3 x dx = -∫ (1 – u2) du = u – u 3 3 = sin x – sin 3 x + C 3 (optimal) = sin x – sin x + sin 2 x cos x 3 3 = sin 2 x cos x - 2 sin x 3 3 (ii) ∫ sin5 x dx 2n + 1 = 5 n 2, u = cos x therefore ∫ sin5 x dx = ∫ (1 – u2)2 du = ∫ (1 – 2u2 + u4) du = u – 2u 3 + u 5 + C 3 5 therefore ∫ sin5 x dx = cos x – 2 cos3 + 1 cos5 x + C 3 5 (optimal) = 1 cos4 x sin x + 4 cos2 x sin x + 8 sin x + C 5 15 15 Example: Find ∫ secx tan x dx Solution: ∫ sec x tan x dx = ∫ 1 sin x = ∫ sin x Cos x cos x cos2 x NOUN 64MTH 122 Integral Calculus then ∫ sec x tan x dx = ∫ cos-2 x sin x dx therefore ∫ cos-2 x sin x = -cos -2+1 + C -2 + 1 = cos -1 x + C -1 = -1 + C cos x = sec x + C Example: Find ∫ tan4 x dx recall that sin2 + cos2 x = 1 therefore tan2 x = sec2 x – 1 then ∫ tan4 x dx = ∫ tan2 x. tan2 x dx = ∫ tan2 x (sec2 x – 1) dx = ∫ (tan2 x sec2 x – tan2 x) dx = ∫ tan2 x sec2 x - ∫ (sec2 x – 1) dx = ∫ (tan2 x sec2 x) dx - ∫ sec2 x dx + ∫ dx let u = tan x du = sec2 x dx therefore ∫ tan4 x dx = ∫ u2 du - ∫ du - ∫ dx = u 3 - u – x 3 = 1 tan3 x – tan x + x + C 3 Therefore, for n = even you can derive the formula using the technique above.
∫ tann x dx = ∫ tann-1 x (sec2 x – 1) dx = ∫ tann-2 x sec2 x) dx - ∫ tann-2 x dx = ∫ (tann-2 x sec2 x) dx - ∫ (secn-2 x – 1) dx = ∫ (tann-2 x sec2 x ) dx - ∫ secn-2 + dx = ∫ tan n-1 - ∫ tann-2 x dx n – 1 Example: Find ∫ tan2 x dx n= 2, therefore n – 1 2 – 1 = 1 therefore ∫ tan2 x dx = tan x - ∫ tan0 x dx 1 = tan x – x The above formula also works for the case n is odd.
Let n = 2m + 1 then after m steps it will be reduced by 2m leaving ∫ tan x = -ln/cos x/ + C. NOUN 65MTH 122 Integral Calculus From the two examples above, you can see the usefulness of the two trigonometric identities.
sin2 x + cos2 x = 1 and tan2 x + 1 = sec2 x in evaluating integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions such as (a) odd powers of sin x or cos x (b) any integral powers of tan x (or cot x ) and (c) even powers of sec x (cos x u) To get the integral C of even powers of sec x all you need do is to express sec2 x in terms of tan2 x and then use the reduction process above to get the integral.
Example: Find ∫ sec4 x dx = ∫ sec2 dx sec2 x = ∫ sec2 x (1 + tan2 x) dx = ∫ sec2 dx + ∫ tan2 x sec2 x dx = ∫ /+ tan2 x dx + ∫ u2 du where u = tan x and du = sec2 x dx.
∫ u2 du = u 3 + C 3 but ∫ tan2 x dx = tan x – x ∫ secu x dx = ∫ dx + ∫ tan2 x dx + tan 3 x + C 3 You can now derive the integral for any even powers of sec x Example: Find ∫ secn x dx Solution: let ∫ sec2 x dx = ∫ (sec2n-2 x) (sec2 x) = ∫(sec x )2(n-1) sec2 x dx = ∫ (sec2 x )n-1 sec2 x dx = ∫ (1 + tan2 x)n-1 sec2 x dx = ∫ (1 + u2)n-1 du (where u = tan x and du = sec2 x dx) where (1 + u2)n-1 can be expanded by the binomial theorem and then the result will be integrated term by term as; Exercises: (i) ∫ sin3 x dx (ii) ∫ tan2 4x dx (iii) ∫ cos5 x dx NOUN 66MTH 122 Integral Calculus (iv) ∫ cot3 x dx (v) ∫ cos3 x sin2 x dx (vi) ∫ secu x tan u du (vii) ∫ dx (viii) ∫ cosn x sin x dx (ix) ∫ cos2 x sin 2x dx sin x (x) ∫ cos x4 3x dx Ans: (i) 1/3 cos3 x –cos x + C (ii) tan4 x – 4x + C (iii) sin x – 2 sin3 x + 1/5 sin5 x + C (iv) -cot 2 x – ln/sin x / + C 3 2 (v) sin 3 x - sin 5 x + C (vi) ln(cosec x – cot x) + C 3 5 (vii) ln(cosec x – cot x) + C (viii) - cos n+1 x + C 2 n + 1 (ix) -cos 3 2x + C (x) -1cosec2 3x cot 3x -2 cot3x 6 9 9 7.2 INTEGRATION OF EVEN POWERS OF SINES AND COSINES In the previous section you have studied how to integrate odd powers of sin x and cos x.
You will attempt to evaluate integrals of even powers of sines and cosines by applying the same technique used above for odd powers i.e.
∫ sinn x cosm x dx where m or n is an even numbers.
that ∫ cos ½ x sin3 dx evaluate the integral.
Recall that 3 is odd as such sin3 x = sin2 x sin x = (1 – cos2 x) sin x. therefore: ∫ cos ½ x sin3 x dx = ∫ cos ½ x 91 – cos2 x) sin x dx for u = cos x du = sin x dx.
therefore: ∫ cos ½ x (1 – cos12 x) sin dx = ∫ u ½ (1 – u2) du = ∫ (u ½ - u) du = 2 u 3/2 - u 2 3 2 = 2cos 3/2 x = cos 2 x + C NOUN 67MTH 122 Integral Calculus 3 2 If in the above you have sin4 x instead of sin3 x then you have to evaluate ∫ cos ½ x sin4 x dx Then using the above method will fail because sin4 x =(1 – cos2 x)2 which give ∫ cos ½ x sin4 x dx = ∫ cos ½ x (1-cos2 x)2 dx missing above is –sin x dx = du that goes with the cos x.
Therefore, there is a need to use another trigonometric identity.
The one that will be used is given as sin2 x = ½ (1 – cos 2x) and cos2 x = ½ (1 + cos 2x).
Note: The above identities are derived by adding or subtracting the equations cos2 x + sin2 x = 1 and cos2 x – sin2 x = cos 2x Recall ∫ sin4 x dx = ∫ (sin2 x)2 dx = ∫ [ ½ (1 – cos 2x]2 dx = ∫ ¼ (1 – 2 cos 2x + cos2 2x) dx = ¼ ∫ (1 – 2 cos 2 x + ½ (1 – cos 4x) dx = ¼ [x – sin 2x + x – 1 sin4 x] 2 8 = 3 x – ¼ sin 2x = 1 sin 4x + C 8 32 Example: Find ∫ sin2 x cos2 x dx Here both powers are even.
Let sin2 x = (1 – cos2 x) Therefore sin2 x cos2 x = (1 – cos2 x) cos2 x ∫ sin2 x cos2 x dx = ∫ (cos1 x – cos4 x) dx ∫ cos2 x dx - ∫ cos4 x dx ∫ cos2 x dx = ∫ ½ (1 + cos 2x) dx = x + sin 2x 2 4 ∫ cos4 x dx = ∫ (cos2 x)2 dx = ∫ [ ½ (1 + cos 2x)]2 dx = ∫ ¼ [1 + 2 cos 2x + cos2 2x] dx = ¼ [1 + 2cos 2x + ½ (1 + cos 4x)] dx NOUN 68MTH 122 Integral Calculus = 3x + ¼ sin 2 x + 1 sin 4x 8 32 ∫ sin2 x cos2 x dx = x + sin 2x + 3x + ¼ sin 2x + 1 sin 4x 2 4 8 32 = 7 x ½ sin 2x + 1 sin 4x + C 8 32 Example: Find ∫ cos6 x dx ∫ cos6 x dx = ∫(cos2 x)3 dx = ∫ 1 (1 + cos 2x)3 dx 8 = 1 ∫ (1 + 3 cos 2x + 3cos2 2x + cos3 2x) dx 8 = 5 x + ¼ sin 2x + 3 sin 4x -1 sin3 2x + C. 16 64 48 Exercises: Find the following integrals: (i) ∫ sin2 x cos4 x dx (ii) ∫ sin2 4t dt (iii) ∫ cos2 6x dx (iv) ∫ sin6 x dx (vi) ∫ cos4 ax dx Ans: (i) x – sin4x + sin 3 2x + C (ii) x – sin 8x + C 16 64 48 2 16 (iii) 5 x + ¼ sin 2x + 3 sin 4x - 1 sin3 2x + C 16 64 48 (iv) 5 x – ¼ sin 2x - 3 sin 4x + 1 sin3 2x + C 16 64 48 (v) 3 x + ¼ sin 2ax + 1 sin 4ax + C 8 32 3.3 POWERS AND PRODUCTS OF OTHER TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS NOUN 69MTH 122 Integral Calculus In this section, you shall evaluate two types of integrals (1) ∫ tanm x secn x dx and (2) ∫ cotm x cosexn dx Example: When n is even you write tanm x secn x = tanm x secn-2 x sec2 x and then express secn-2 in terms of tan2 x using sec2 x + 1 = tan2 x.
Example: ∫ tan3 x sec2 x dx let u = tan x du = sec2 x dx.
then ∫ tan3 x sec2 x dx = ∫ u3 du = u 4 + C = tan 4 x + C 4 4 When n and m are both odd you write tan x secn x = tanm-1 x secn-1 sec x 1an u and express tanm-1 x in terms of sec2 x using tan2 x = sec2 x – 1 Example: ∫ tan3 x sec3 x dx tan3 x sec3 x = tan2 x sec2 x tan x sec x and tan2 x = (sec2 x – 1) therefore: ∫ tan3 x sec3 x dx = ∫ (sec 3x – 1) sec2 x sec x tan x dx = ∫ (sec4 x – sec2 x) sec x tan x dx (but u = sec x, du = se x 1 an x du) therefore ∫ tan3 x sec3 x dx = ∫ (u4 – u2) du = u 5 – u 3 + C 5 3 = sec 3 x – sec 3 x + C 5 3 you can do the same for cotm x cosecn x in a similar manner.
That is for ∫ cotm x cosecn x dx when n is even you write out cotm x cosecn x = cotm x cosecn-2 cosec x and express cosecn-2 in terms of cot2 x using NOUN 70MTH 122 Integral Calculus cosec2 x = cot2 x + 1 Example: ∫ cot5 x cosec4 x dx = ∫cot5 x cosec2 x cosec2 x dx = ∫ cot5 x (cot2 x + 1) cosec2 x dx = ∫ cot7 cosec2 x dx + ∫ cot5 x cosec2 x dx (u = cot x du = -cosec2 x dx).
= -cot 8 x - -cot 6 x + C 8 6 In similar manner when m and n are both odd you have cotm x cosexn x = cotm-1 x cosecn-1 x cosec x cot x and then express cotm-1 x in terms of cosec2 x using cot2 x = cosec2 x – 1 Example: ∫ cot5 x cosec3 x dx = ∫ cot4 x cosec2 x cosec x cot x dx = ∫ (cosec2 x – 1)2 cosec2 x cosec x cot x dx = ∫ (cosec6 x – 2 cosec4 x + cosec2 x) cosec x cot x dx u = cosec x du = - cosec x cot x dx = ∫ (u6 – 2u4 + u2) (-du) = -u 7 + 2 u 5 – u 3 + C 7 5 3 = -cosec 7 x + 2cosec 5 x – cosec 3 x + C 7 5 3 Exercises Find 1.

The use of inverse trigonometric functions or trigonometric identifies will be needed.
In this unit the method or process used in deriving formulas for integrals of functions in the previous unit will be adopted.
2.0 OBJECTIVES In this unit you should be able to correctly; (i) recall basic differential formulas and corresponding integrals as stated in UNIT 5.
(ii) Use these basic formulas to evaluate integrals involving √a2-u2, a2 + u2, u2, - a2, and a2 – u2 (iii) evaluate integrals of rational functions with ax2 + b x + C as denominator.
3.0 INTEGRALS INVOLVING √a2 ≠u2 and a2 ≠u2 Recall that d (arc tan u) = 1 du dx 1 + u2 dx therefore ∫ d (arc tan u) = ∫ 1 du d 1+u2 therefore arc tan u + C = 1 – (I) 1+u2 NOUN 73MTH 122 Integral Calculus Example: Find the integral of 1 i.e.
∫ du a2 + u2 a2 + u2 To evaluate the above you factor out a2 from a2 + u2 i.e.
a2 + u2 = a2 (1 + (u)2) a let z = u, adz = du a then a2 + u2 = a2(1 + z2) therefore: ∫ du = 1 ∫ adz = 1 ∫ dz a2+u2 a2 1+z2 a 1+z2 = 1 tan-1 z a thus ∫ du = 1 arc tan u + C – II a2+u2 a a Example: Find ∫ du 9 + u2 Solution ∫ du = ∫ du = 1 arc tan u + C a+u (3)2+u2 3 3 You have to review some trigonometric identities you studied in MATH 111.
Example: (i) 1 – sin2 x = cos2 x (ii) 1 + tan2 x = sec2 x and (iii) sec2 x – 1 = tan2 x. let u = a sin x then u2 = a2 sin2 x Multiplying identity (1) through by a2 you get: a2(1-sin2n) = a2 cos2 x.
– (i) a2 – a2 sin2 x = a2 cos2 x.
– (ii) NOUN 74MTH 122 Integral Calculus but u2 = a2 sin2 x therefore equation (II) becomes a2 – u2 = a2 cos2 x In similar manner, if a2 + a2 tan2 x = a2 sec2 x and u2 = a2 + ax2 x then a2 + a2 tan2 x = a2 + u2 = a2 sec2 x.
If a2 sec2 x – a2 = a2 tan2 x and u2 = a2 sec2 x then u2 – a2 = a2 tan2 x. thus: (1) a2 – u2 = a2 cos2 x,; u = a sin x (see fig.
6.1) (2) a2 + u2 = a2 sec2 x ; u = a tan x (see fig.
6.2) (3) u2 – a2 = a2 tan2 x ; u = a sec x (see fig.
6.3) The above trigonometric identities you were given in equations (1) to (3) are equivalent expressions of the Pythagorean Theorem.
See fig.

6.1 √a2+u2 u = tan x u a x and u = cos x a √a2+u2 = a sec x = a2 sec2 x Fig.
6.2 u u = sec x √u2-a2 a x √ u 2 – a 2 = tan x a a u2 – a2 = a2 tan2 x Fig.
6.3 Example Find ∫ du /a/>u √a2-u2 NOUN 75MTH 122 Integral Calculus Solution: let u = a sin x du = a cos x dx then a2 – u2 = a2 cos2 x ∫ du = ∫ a cos x dx = ∫ dx = x + C √a2 – u2 √a2 cos2 x if u = a sin x u = sin x a and x = arc sin u a therefore ∫ du = arc sin u + C - III √a2-u2 a (B) The usefulness of trigonometric identities in evaluating special types of integrals is numerous.
Functions not involving trigonometric function can be integrated by expressing them in terms of trigonometric identities and then using standard integration formulas to evaluate them.
In integration by method of completing the square is introduced in this unit.
Example: Find ∫ du √25-u2 here a2 = 25 a = 5 From above u = 5 sin x du = 5 cos x dx ∫ du = ∫ 5 cos x dx = ∫ dx = x + C √25 – u2 √25 cos2 x therefore x = arc sin u + C 5 Example: Find ∫ du a >0 √a2+u2 Let u = a tan du = a sec2 x dx but a2 + u2 = a2 + a2 tan2 x = a2 (1 + tan2 x ) = a2 sec2 x then ∫ du = ∫ a sec 2 x dx = ±∫ sec x dx √a2+u2 √a2 sec2 x Recall that ∫ sec x dx = ln/sec x + tan x/ + C1 NOUN 76MTH 122 Integral Calculus i.e.
∫ sec x (tan x + sec x) dx = ln/ssec x + tan x/ + C1 tan x + sec x Hence ±∫ sec x dx = ln/sec + tan x/ + C1 If you let x = arc tan u x˛ (-p / , p / ) 2 2 then sec x will be positive and ∫ du = ∫ sec x dx √a2 + u2 = ln/sec x + tan x/ + C recall that you let a2 + u2 = a2 sec2 x sec x = √ a 2 +u 2 a and tan x = u a Then ∫ du = ln/√ a 2 +u 2 + u/ + C1 √a2+u2 a a let C = C1 – ln a you then have that ∫ du = ln/√a2+u2 + u/ + C.__ IV Example: Find ∫ du √16 + u2 Solution: let a2 16 a = 4 then by direct substitution into IV you get ∫ du = ln /√16 + u2 + u/ + C √16+u2 Example: Find ∫ du lu/>a>0 √ u2 – a2 Solution: You can start by trying the substitution u = a sec x then du = a sec x tan x dx but u2 – a2 = a2 sec2 x – a = a2 (sec2 x – 1) = a2 tan2 x You will then have that ∫ du = ∫ a sec x tan x dx = ∫ a sec x tan x dx √u2-a2 √a2 tan2 x a tan x NOUN 77MTH 122 Integral Calculus = ± ∫ sec x dx therefore x = arc sec u 0 < x < p a but tan x >0 whenever 0 < x < p / .

Example Find ∫ du √u2 -64 Solution: let a2 = 64 a = 8 Thus by direct substitution into equation (V) you get that ∫ du = ln/u + √u2 – 64/ + C √u2-64 Example: Find ∫ √9 – u2 du Solution: let u = 3 sin x, du = 3 cos x dx.
then 9 – u2 = (9 – 9 sin2 x) = 9(1 – sin2 x) = 9 cos2 x therefore: ∫ √9 – u2 du = ∫ √9 cos2 x 3 cos x dx = ∫9 cos2 x dx NOUN 78MTH 122 Integral Calculus From Unit 5 sec 3.3 you have that ∫ 9 cos2 x dx = 9/2 ∫(1 + cos 2x) dx = 9/2(x + sin 2x) + C 2 = 9/2 x + 9 sin 2x + C 4 therefore: ∫ √9 – u2 du = 9 arc sin u _ u √9 – u2 + C 2 3 2 Example: Find ∫ u 2 du √4 – u2 Solution: let u = 2 sin x and –p <0 < p 2 2 du = 2 cos x dx 4 – u2 = 4 – 4 sin2 x = 4 cos2 x therefore ∫ u 2 du = ∫ 4 sin 2 x 2 cos x dx = ∫ 4 sin2 x dx √4-u2 √4 cos2 x From unit 5 sec 3.3 you have that 4 ∫ sin2 x dx = 4 ∫ (1 – cos 2x) dx 2 = 2x – 2 sin x cos x + C = 2(arc sin u – ( 4 – u 2 ) + C 2 4 Example: Find ∫ dx √1 – 4x2 Solution: let 2x = sin u, 4x2 = sin2 u 2 dx = cos u du 1 – 4x2 = 1 – sin2 u = cos2 u therefore: √1-4x2 = √cos2 u = cos u hence ∫ dx = ½ ∫ cos u du = ½ ∫ du √1-4x2 cos u = ½ u + C but u = arc sin 2x NOUN 79MTH 122 Integral Calculus = ½ arc sin 2x + C Example: Find ∫ xdx √4 + x2 Solution: let x = 2 tan u dx = 2 sec2 u du 4 + x2 = 4 + 2 tan2 u = 4 (1 + tan2 u) = 4 sec2 u ∫ x dx = ∫ 2tan u.2 sec 2 u du = ∫ 2 tan u sec u du √4+x2 √4 sec2 u = 2 sec u + C = √4 + x2 + C Example: Find ∫ dx √(x-1)2 + 4 Solution: let z = x – 1 , 2dz = dx 2 4 + (x -1)2 = 4(1 + Z2) ∫ dx = ¼ ∫ 2 dz = ½ ∫ dz (x-1)2 + 4 1+Z2 1 + Z2 = ½ arc tan z = ½ arc tan (x – 1) + C 2 Exercises: Find the following integrals (i) ∫ dx (ii) ∫ √16 + x2 dx (9 – x2)3/2 (iii) ∫ dx (iv) ∫ √25 – 4x2 x√9x2+4 (v) ∫ x 2 dx (vi) ∫ dx √9 – 4x2 √1-16x2 dx (vii) ∫ cos x dx (viii) ∫ √1 – x 2 √2-sin2 x 16 (ix) ∫ dx (x) ∫ x dx x√a2+x2 √25-4x2 Ans: (i) x + C (ii) ½ x √16 + x2 + 8ln/x+√16+x2/+C NOUN 80MTH 122 Integral Calculus (iii) ½ ln/√ 9x 2 + 4 – 2 / + C 3x (iv) x √25 – 4x2 + 25 arc sin 2x + C 2 4 5 (v) -x √9 – 4x2 + 9 arc sin 2x + C 8 16 3 (vi) ¼ arc sin 4x + C (vii) arc sin ( √ 2 sin x) + C 2 (viii) x √16 – x2 + 2 arc sin x + C 8 4 (ix) -1 ln/ a + √ a 2 + x 2 / + C a x (x) - ¼ √25 – 4x2 3.1 INTEGRAION BY COMPLETING THE SQUARE OF ax2 + bx + C Given a quadratic function of this form f(x) = ax2 + bx + C by completing the square it can be reduced to the form a(u2 + A) i.e.
ax2 + bx + C = a(x2 + bx) + C a = a(x2 + bx + b 2 ) + C – b 2 a 4 4a = a(x + b)2 + 4ac – b 2 2a 4a if you let u = xt b and A = 4x-b 2 2a 4a2 then ax2 + bx + C = a(u2 + A).
When the integral involves the square root of ax2 + bx + C then you have to consider only the case for which √a(u2+A) will have only real roots.
Example: Find ∫ dx √x2+2x NOUN 81MTH 122 Integral Calculus Solution: x2+2x = ∫√(x +1)2 -1 = √u2 – 1, u = x + 1; du = dx then ∫ dx = ∫ du √x2+2x √u2 – 1 = ln/u + √u2-1/ + C = ln/(x+1) + √x2 + 2x/ + C Example: ∫ dx √x2 – 8x √x2 – 8x = √(x – 4)2 - 16 let u = x – 4 and du = dx then √x2 = 8x = √u2 – 16 therefore: ∫ dx = ln/u √u2 – 16/ C = ln/x – 4 + √x2-8x/ + C Example: Find ∫ dx x2-10x+29 Solution: x2 – 10x + 29 = x2 – 10x + 25 + 4 = (x -5)2 + 22 therefore: ∫ dx = ∫ dx = ∫ du x2-10x + 29 22 + (x-5)2 22 + u2 where u = x – 5, du = dx thus ∫ dx = ∫ du = ½ arc tan u + C x2–10x+29 22+ u2 = ½ arc tan (x -5) + C 2 Example: Find ∫ dx √3–x2+2x Solution: √3-x2+2x = √-(x2 – 2x) +3 = √-(x2-2x+1)+1+3 = √-(x-1)2 + 4 = √4 – u2 where u = x – 1 du = dx then NOUN 82MTH 122 Integral Calculus ∫ dx = ∫ du = arc sin u + C √3-x2+2x √4 – u2 = arc sin x – 1 + C 2 Example: Find ∫ dx 4x2+4x+10 Solution: 4x2 + 4x + 10 = 4(x2 + x) + 10 = 4(x2 + x + ¼ ) + 10 – 4/4 = 4(x + ½ )2 + 9 let u = x + ½ du = dx then ∫ dx = ∫ du 4x2+4x+10 4u2 + 9 = 1/6 arc tan 2u + C 3 = 1/6 arc tan 2x + 1 + C 3 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have studied techniques used in evaluating integrals involving √a2+u2, √a2 – u2, √u2 – a2, a2 + u2, ax2 + bx + C, and √ax2+bx+C.

You start by making a guess and determine whether the differentiation of your guess can give you the function you want to integrate.
The techniques you have studied so far are all trying to narrow your guess to the exact solution.
Therefore in this unit you will study rational functions can be integrated by first resolving the rational function into partial fractions.
The method of resolving rational fraction into partial fraction before integration is called integration by method of partial fractions.
Also there are functions that are formed as a product of exponential functions and trigonometric function.
Finding, integrals of such product functions can only be possible by making use of the product rule studied in the first course in calculus i.e.
calculus I.
This type of integration by which the product rule is applied is known as integration by parts.
All these techniques are studied in order to make it easier for you to evaluate integrals of function without making a wide guess.
So endeavour to practice the examples given here and in the previous units.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: i. integrate certain types of rational functions by method of partial fractions.
ii.
evaluate integrals of product functions by method of integration by parts.
3.0 INTEGRATOINS BY PARTIAL NOUN 85MTH 122 Integral Calculus In the course in algebra MTH 111 you studied how to split a rational function into a sum of fractions with simpler denomination.
You were told that the process of doing this is called the method of partial fractions.
It is advisable that you review this method of partial fraction in the materials given to you for the course in algebra.
You could recall that x + 7 = x – 7 = 2 + 1 6 + x –x2 (3-x)(2+x) 3-x 2+x therefore if you want to integrate a rational function of this type, ∫ f(x) dx g(x) There are two things you will check before you decide to use the method of partial fractions.
These are as follows: 1.
The degree of f(x) should be less than the degree of g(x).
If this is not the case, you must perform a long division, then resolve the remainder into partial fraction.
2.
The factors of g9x) should be known by you.
Example: Find ∫ x + 7 dx 6+x-x2 Solution: The degree of x + 7 is lower than that of 6+x – x2.
The factors of 6+x – x2 are (3-x)(2+x) Therefore, ∫ x + 7 dx = ∫ 2 dx + ∫ dx 6 +x-x2 3-x 2+x = -2ln/3-x/+ln/2+x/+C.
Example: Evaluate ∫ 4x 2 – 24x + 11 (x+2)(x – 3)2 Solution: The degree of 4x2 – 24x + 11 is less than that of (x+2)(x – 3)2 4x 2 – 24x + 11 = A + B + C (x + 2)(x – 3)2 x+2 x-3 (x-3)2 i.e.
4x2 – 24x + 11 = (A + B) x2 + (C – 6A – B)x + 9A – 6B + 2C Equating coefficient and solving the resolutions simultaneous equations yields NOUN 86MTH 122 Integral Calculus 4x 2 – 24x + 11 = 3 + 1 - 5 (x+25 x – 3)2 x+2 3-3 (x-3)2 therefore ∫ 4x 2 – 24x + 11 dx = ∫ 3 du + ∫ dx - ∫ 5dx (x+2)(x-3)2 x+2 x-3 (x-3)2 = 3ln/x+2/+ln/x-3/+ 5 + C (x-2) Example: Find ∫ 6x + 1 3x3+12x2-2x-3 Solution: 3x3 + 12x2 – 2x – 3 = (4x2 -1)(2x + 3).
Then 6x + 1 = A + B + C (4x2-1)(2x+3) 2x -1 2x+1 2x+3.
6x + x = A (2x+1)(2x+3) + B(2x-1)(2x +3) + C(2x-1)(2x+1) By equations coefficients and solving the resulting simultaneous equation you get 6x + 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 (4x2-1)92x+3) 2(2x-1) 2(2x+1) 2x + 3 therefore: ∫ 6x + 1 dx = ½ ∫ dx + ½ ∫ dx - ∫ dx 3x3+12x2-2x-3 2x-1 2x+1 2x+3 = ¼ ln/2x-1/+1/ ¼ ln/2x+1/- ½ ln/2x+3/ + C. Example: Find ∫ 3x 2 dx 1 + x3 Solution: 3x 2 = A + Bx + C 1 + x3 1 + x 1 – x + x2 Therefore 3x2 = A(1 – x + x2) + (Bx + C) (1 + x) Equations coefficient solving the resulting simultaneous equations yields 3x 2 = 1 + 2x – 1 1+x3 1+x 1-x+x2 therefore: ∫ 3x 2 dx = ∫ 1 dx + ∫ 2x – 1 dx 1+x3 1+x 1-x+x2 Example: Find ∫ x + 3 NOUN 87MTH 122 Integral Calculus 4x3+4x2-7x+2 Solution: 4x3+4x2 – 7x + 2 = (2x – 1)(2x -1)(x + 2) then x + 3 = A + B + C (2x-1)2(x +2) 2x-1 (2x-1)2 x + 2 hence x + 3 = A (2x-1)(x+2) + B(x+2) + C(2x – 1)2 Equating coefficients and solving the resulting simultaneous equations yields x + 3 = - 2 + 7 + 1 (2x-1)2(x+7) 25(2x – 1) 5(2x - 1) 25(x + 2) therefore: ∫ x + 3 dx = -2 ∫ dx + 7 ∫ dx + 1 ∫ dx 4x3+4x2-7x+2 25 2x-1 5 (2x-1)2 25 x+2 = -1 ln/2x-1/ - 7 + 1 ln/x+2/+C 25 10(2x-1) 25 Exercises: Find the following integrals (1) ∫ dx c (2) ∫ 3x – 1 dx (x+1)(x+2) (2+x)(x-3) (3) ∫ x – 5 dx (4) ∫ 2x 2 + x + 6 dx (x-1)(x+4) 4x2 – 4x – 3 (5) ∫ x – 3 dx (6) ∫ 5 dx x2+2x–8 1+3x+ 2x2 (7) ∫ x 2 dx (8) ∫ x 3 + x + 1 dx 2x2 – 3x – 2 x2 – 1 (9) ∫ 2 – x 2 dx (10) ∫ x 3 dx (2x+1)3 (x-1) (x2+x+4) (x2+1) Ans: (1) ln(x+1) – ln/x +2/ + C (2) 7/5 ln/x+2/ + 8/5 ln/x-1/ + C (3) 9/5 ln/x+4/ - 4/5ln/x – 1/ + C NOUN 88MTH 122 Integral Calculus (4) x – 3 ln/2x + 1/ + 3 ln2x – 3/ + C 2 4 2 (5) 7 ln/x + 4/ - 1 ln/x – 2/ + C 6 6 (6) 5ln (2x + 1) – 5ln/x + 1/ + C (7) x - 1 ln (2x + 1) + 4 ln/x -2/ + C 2 20 5 (8) ½ x2 + 3 ln/x-1/+ ½ ln/x + 1/ + C (9) 7 + 13 - 1 ln/2x + 1/+ 1 ln/x – 1/ + C 24(2x+1)2 36(2x+1) 27 27 (10) 13 ln/x2 + x + 4/ - √ 15 arc tan (2x_+ 1) -3 ln/x2 +1/ 20 30 √15 20 - 1 arc tan x 10 3.1 INTEGRATION BY PARTS The method of integration by parts owns its origin to the differential of a product.
That is d(uv) = u dv + v du – (i) or udv = u dv – v du - (ii) integrating equation (ii) you get ∫ u dv = ∫ d (uv) - ∫ vdu ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.
+ C – III Equation III above expresses one integral ∫ u dv, in terms of a second integral ∫ u dv.
The idea behind this method is that, if by appropriate choice U and dv, the second integral is simpler than the first, you may be able to evaluate it quite simply and as such arrive at the solution.
Example: Find ∫ x sin x dx Solution: let ∫ x sin x dx = -∫ x d (cos x) then using the formula for integration by part given in equation III above you have that v = cos x therefore ∫ x sin x dx = ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du = -cos x (x) + ∫ cos x dx = -x cos x + sin x + C NOUN 89MTH 122 Integral Calculus Example: ∫ xe-x dx.
Solution: Use integration by parts with u = x, du = dx, dv = e-x dx, v =-e-x Therefore ∫ xc-x dx = -xe-x - ∫-e-x dx = -xe-x – c-x + c In above example, it is possible to choose u and v differently i.e.
∫xe-x dx = ∫udv u = e-x, du = -e-x dx dv = x dx v = x 2 2 then integration by parts you get ∫ xe-x dx = x 2 e -x - ∫ - -x x 2 dx 2 2 The above is true but the resulting integral on the right is harder than the given one on the left.
Therefore, you should be cautious when factoring the integrand into u and dv.
With more examples, you get use to this technique of integration by parts.
Examples: Find ∫ ln x dx Solution: u = lnx, dv = dx, du = 1 dx x therefore ∫ ln dx = xlnx - ∫ x.
1 dx .
x = xlnx – x.
+ c. Example: Find ∫ arc cos x dx Solution: u = arc cos x du = - dx √1-x2 dv = dx, v = x. therefore ∫ arc cos x dx = uv -∫vdu = x arc cos x -∫ -x dx √1-x2 but ∫ x dx = -∫ u du where y2 = 1 – x2 √1-x2 y -∫ dy = -y + c = -ydu = + x dx √1-x2 + C NOUN 90MTH 122 Integral Calculus therefore: ∫ arc cos x dx = x arc cos x - √1-x2 + C Example: Find ∫ xe x dx (x + 1)2 Solution: After several attempts it is found that the following factors for the integrand will work.
Let u = xex du = 1 dx (x + 1)2 du = (xex + ex) dx = ex (x + 1) dx v = - 1 x + 1 therefore: ∫ xe x dx = uv - ∫ vdu = xe x - ∫ e x (x + 1) (x + 1)2 (x+1) -(x + 1) = -xe -x + ∫ ex dx x + 1 = - xe x + ex + C x + 1 = e x + C x + 1 3.1.1 REPEATED INTEGRATION BY PARTS Some integration may require that you apply the method of integration by parts two or more times.
Example: Find ∫ x2ex dx.
Solution: Applying integration by parts you get: u = x2, dv = ex dx du = 2x dx, v = ex therefore ∫ x2 ex dx = ∫udv = uv - ∫ v du = x2ex - ∫2xexdx To find ∫ 2x ex dx, you apply integration by parts again.
By letting NOUN 91MTH 122 Integral Calculus u = 2x dv = ex dx du = 2 dx v = ex then ∫2x ex = ∫ udv = uv - ∫ v du = 2x ex - ∫ 2ex dx = 2x ex – 2ex + C hence ∫ x2 ex dx = x2 ex – 2x ex + 2ex + C Example: ∫ x(lnx)2 dx Solution: let u = (lnx)2 du = 2ln x dx X dv = x dx v = x 2 2 thus ∫ x(lnx)2 dx = ∫ udv = vu - ∫ vdu = x 2 (lnx)2 - ∫ x 2 .
2lnx dx 2 2 x = (xln x) 2 - ∫ xln x dx 2 To evaluate ∫ x lnx dx, you apply integration by parts the second time.
i.e.
u = lnx du = dx dv = x dx v = x 2 x 2 therefore ∫ xln x = x 2 .
lnx - ∫ dx .
x 2 2 x 2 = x 2 lnx - ∫ x dx = x 2 lnx - x 2 + C 2 2 2 4 thus ∫ x(lnx)2 = (xln x) 2 - x 2 lnx + x 2 + C 2 2 4 Example: Find ∫ x3 ex dx Solution: You will apply integration by parts three times to get the solution.
∫ x3 e-x dx NOUN 92MTH 122 Integral Calculus dv = e-x dx, u = x3 du = 3x2dv v = ex.
∫ x3e-xdx = uv - ∫ vdu = -x3e-x- ∫ -e-x 3x2 dx 3∫e-x x2 dx = 3[uv - ∫vdu] u = x2 dv = e-x dx, du = 2x dx, v = -e-x 3∫ e-x x2 dx = 3 –x2 e-x -3 ∫-e-x 2x dx.
+ 6∫e-x x dx = 6[uv - ∫ vdu] u = x, du = dx, dv = e-x dx, v = -e-x 6∫e-x x dx =-6x e-x -6 ∫ -e-x dx = 6xe-x + 6e-x + C therefore: ∫ x3e-x dx = -x3 e-x – 3x2 e-x – 6x e-x – 6 e-x + C = e-x (-x3 -3x2 – 6x -6) + C Example: Find ∫ ex sin x dx Solution: let u = ex, du = ex dx du = sinx dx v = cos x Let I = ∫ ex sin x dx therefore I = uv - ∫ v du = -ex cos x - ∫ - cosx ex dx.
∫ cos x ex dx integrate by parts again by letting u = ex du = ex dx, dv=cosx dx.
v = sin x then ∫ cos x ex dx = ex sin x - ∫ sin x ex dx.
Therefore I = -ex cos x + ex sin x – I (since I = ∫ sinx e2 dx) 2I = -ex cos x + ex sin x. therefore I = e x (sin x – cos x) 2 ∫ sinx ex dx = e x (sin x – cos x ) + C 2 Exercise: Evaluate the following integrals (1) ∫ xex dx (2) ∫ x cos x dx (3) ∫ x2 e2x dx (4) ∫ x2 e-x dx (5) ∫ xe2x dx (6) ∫ ln (x2 + 1) dx NOUN 93MTH 122 Integral Calculus (7) ∫ x sec2 x dx (8) ∫ x3 ex2 dx (9) ∫ x2 cos x dx (10) ∫ e2x sin x dx (11) ∫ x tan2 x dx (12) ∫ e2x cos x dx Ans (1) xex – ex + C (2) cos x + x sin x + C (3) 1e2x ( x 2 – x + ¼ ) + C 2 2 (4) -e-x (-x2 + 2x – 2) + C (5) e2x (x – ¼ ) + C 2 (6) xln (x2 + 1) – 2x + 2 arc tan x + C (7) x tan x + ln (cos x) + C (8) –x3 cos x + 3x2 sin x – 6 sin x + 6x cos x + C (9) x2 sin x – 2 sin x + 2x cos x + C (10) e2x (- cos x + 2 sin x) + C 5 5 (11) x tan x – x 2 - ln (1 + tan 2 x) + C 2 2 (12) e2x ( 2 cos x + 1 sin x) + C 5 5 4.0 CONCLUSION You have studied two techniques of integration.
The method of partial fraction requires that you factorize the denominator so that you could have simpler factors which in turn will be easier to integrate.
Also you used the technique of integration to integrate product of functions that are somehow difficult to integrate.
Breaking up the integration into parts by applying the product rule for differentiation yields simpler integrands that you are already familiar with in previous units of this course.
In the next unit you will study a technique which is very similar to the technique of integration by parts.
In this unit various solved examples have been provided for you.
This is because understanding the examples will enable you to know at glance if a particular integration should be carried out by any of the techniques studie in this unit.
Doing all the exercises provided in this unit will also sharpen your skills in the use of the techniques studied in the unit.

The previous unit ended with the technique of integration by parts.
In this unit you shall extend the method of integration by parts to derive what is known as reduction formulas for certain categories of product functions.
The reduction is derived by applying the method of integration by parts repeatedly until the power of one of the product functions is reduced to 1 or 0. the second technique that will be studied in this unit involves using an appropriate substitution which makes it possible to integrate all rational expression of sin x and cos x, then the substitution 2 arc tan u = x transforms the integral ∫ f(x) into the integral of a rational function of u, which can be evaluated by techniques studied in previous units.
The third technique that will be studied in this unit involves using appropriate substitution for rational expression containing some radicals such as √x, x3/4, √1-ex etc.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly (1) derive reduction formulas for integrals such as (i) ∫ cosn x dx, (ii) ∫ sinn x dx, (iii) ∫ eax cos bx dx, etc (2) evaluate integrals of rational functions of sin x and cos x using the substitution u = tan x/2.
(3) evaluate integrals rational functions involving radicals and fractional powers of x.

NOUN 96MTH 122 Integral Calculus 3.0 REDUCTION FORMULAS Repeated application of integration by parts could reduce the power of a function from n, say + 1 or 0.
Thus a formula could emerge from the above application that can be used for evaluating integrals which are similar.
Given the integral ∫ x2 ex dx which you are quite familiar with in unit 7.
The integral above requires two integration by parts.
Each integration lowers the power of x by one until x disappears.
In a similar way the integral ∫ x3ex dx requires three integration by parts and the integral ∫∫ x4 ex dx require four integration by parts.
This process can continue for any power of x say n. Thus to evaluate the integral ∫ xn ex dx requires n integration by parts.
Example: Obtain a reduction formula for the integral J = ∫ xn ex dx.
n Solution: Integrate by parts setting u = xn, du = nxn-1 dx, dv = ex v = ex.
Then J = ∫ xn ex dx = uv - ∫ v du n therefore J = xnex - ∫ nxn-1 ex dx n = xn ex – n ∫ n-1 Thus the reduction formula is given as J = xn ex - n∫ ---- (A) n n-1 Example: Find ∫ x6x e dx x Solution: Use the reduction formula of equation (A) to evaluate J .
By the 4 reduction formula in equation (A) n = 6, that is J = x6 ex - 6∫ 6 5 By the reduction formula with n = 5 J = x5 ex – 5 J 5 4 By the reduction formula with n = 4 J = x4 ex – 4 J 4 3 Thus J = x6 ex – 6 (x5 ex – 5 J ) 6 4 = x6 ex – 6x5 ex + 30 ∫ 4 But by repeated use of the reduction formula J = x4 ex - 4∫ 4 3 = x4 ex – 4(x3 ex - 3∫ ) 2 = x4 ex – 4x3 ex + 12(x2 ex - 2∫ ) 1 = x4 ex – 4x3 ex + 12x2 ex – 24 (xex - ∫ ) o = x4 ex – 4x3 ex + 12x2 ex – 24xex + 24ex + C thus J = ex (x4 – 4xn + 12x2 – 24x + 24) + C 4 therefore J = ex (x6 – 6x5 + 30 (x4 – 4x3 + 12x2 – 24x + 24) + C 6 NOUN 97MTH 122 Integral Calculus = ex (x6 – 6x5 + 30x4 – 120x3 + 360x2 – 720x + 720) + C Example: Obtain a reduction formula for ∫ sinn x dx.
Solution: You can write J = ∫ sinn x dx = ∫ (sinn-1x)(sin x) dx n and integrate by parts with u = (sin x)n-1 du = (n-1)(sin x)n-2 cos x dx dv = sin x dx v = -cos x therefore ∫ sinn x dx = (sin x)n-1 (-cos x) + ∫ (n-1) sin xn-2 cos2 dx therefore = J sinn x dx = (sin x)n-1 cos x + (n-1) ∫ sinn-2 x (1- sin2 x) dx n = (sin x)n-1 cos x + (n-1) ∫ sinn-2 x dx - ∫ sinn x dx J = (sin x)n-1 cos x + (n-1) ∫ – (n-1) J n n-2 n collecting like terms you get (n-1) ∫ + ∫ = (sin x)n-1 cos x + (n-1) ∫ n n n-2 n ∫ = (sin x)n-1 cos x + (n-1) ∫ n n-2 dividing through by n you obtain Jn = ( sin x ) n-1 cos x + n-1 ∫ n-2 n n In the above the reduction formula lowers the power of sin x by two.
Therefore, repeated application will reduce ∫ to ∫ or ∫ accordingly as n is n o 1 even or odd i.e.
J = ∫ sin x dx = cos x + C n J = ∫ dx = x + C o Example: ∫p /2(sin x)6 dx 0 Solution: set J = ∫II/2(sin x)6 dx n Using the reduction formula of the last example, you get Let J = (sin x) 5 cos x + 5 J 6 4 6 6 for brevity you write NOUN 98MTH 122 Integral Calculus J = I, + 5 [ sin 3 x cos x + 3 J ] 6 2 4 4 = I + 5 [I + 3 [I + ½ J ] 2 3 o 6 4 I = ( sin x) 5 cos x /II/2 = (sin II/2 ) 5 cos II/2 – (sin o) 5 cos o = 0 1 6 0 6 6 I = 0, I = 0 2 3 hence J = 5 (¾)(1/2 J ) = 5 (¾)( ½ )(x)/II/2 6 o 6 6 0 = 5 .

You will apply integration by part again by letting u = eax and dv = sin bx dx.
then du = aeax dx and v = - 1 cos bx b hence (B) ∫ sin bx eax dx = - e ax cos bx - ∫ - a eax cos bx dx b b = - e ax cos bx + a ∫eax cos bx dx therefore: substituting equation (B) into equation (A) you get ∫ eax cos bx dx = e ax sin bx - a (- e ax cos bx + a ∫ eax cos bx dx) b b b b = e ax sin bx + a eax cos bx - a 2 ∫eax cos bx dx b b2 b2 collecting like terms you get ∫ eax cos bx dx (1 + a 2 ) = e ax (sin bx + a cos bx) b2 b b therefore ∫ eax cos bx dx = eax ( sin bx + a cos bx) ( b 2 ) b b a2+b2 = eax ( sin bx + a cps bx) + C a2 + b2 Example: Find ∫e2x cos 3x dx Solution: Using the above reduction formula you have that a = 2 and b = 3 then ∫ e2x cos 3 x dx = e2x(3 sin 3x + 2 cos 3x) + C 4 + 9 = e 2x (3 sin 3 x + 2 cos 3 x) + C 13 Example: Find ∫ex/2 cos 2/3 x dx.

An appropriate substitution of u = tan x/ 2 might reduce the problem of integrating such class of rational functions of sinx and cox to a problem of integrating a rational function of u.
This in turn can be integrated by the method of partial fraction studied in unit 7.
Example: If f(x) is a rational expression in sinx and cosx, then the substitution u = tan x/2 transforms the integral ∫ f(x) dx into the integral of a rational function of u.
Solution: A typical way to explain the above is to start by expressing cosx and sinx in terms of u. i.e.
cos x = 2 cos2 x - 1 = 2 - 2 sec2(x) 2 = 2 - 1 = 2 - 1 + tan2(x) 1 + u 2 = 1 - u 2 1 + u2 therefore: cos x = 1 - u 2 , u = tan x 1 + u2 2 and sin x = 2 sin x cos x = 2 sin x/2 .
cos2 x NOUN 101MTH 122 Integral Calculus 2 2 cos(x/2) 2 = 2 tan (x/2) .
1 - sec2 x 2 = 2 tan (x/2) .
1 + tan2 (x/2) = 2u .
1+u2 therefore sinx = 2u , u = tan x/2 1+u2 x = 2 ac tan u dx = 2 du .
1+u2 Use the above tools to evaluate (1) ∫ sec x dx Solution: ∫ sec x dx = ∫ dx cos x from above cos x = 1 – u 2 dx = 2 du 1 + u2 1 + u22 therefore: ∫ dx = ∫ 2 du .
1 + u 2 = 2∫ du cosx 1+u2 1 – u2 1-u2 by partial fractions you arrive at 2 ∫ du = ∫ A du + ∫ B du 1- u2 1- u 1 + u = ∫ du + ∫ du 1 – u 1 + u = ln /1-u/+ln/1+u/+C = ln/1+u/ + C 1- u but u = tan x/2 thus ∫ dx = ln/ 1 + tan x/2 / + C 1 – tax x/2 NOUN 102MTH 122 Integral Calculus Example: ∫ dx .
1 + 2cos x Solution: let cos x = 1 - u 2 1 + u2 then 1 + 2 cos x = 1 + 2 ( 1 – u 2 ) = 1 + u 2 + 2 – 2u 2 1 + u2 1 + u2 = 3 – u 2 1 + u2 dx = 2 du .
1 + u2 therefore: ∫ dx = ∫ 2 du .
1 + u 2 = ∫ 2 du 1 + 2cosx 1 + u2 3 – u2 3-u2.
therefore: ∫ 2dv = 2∫ du = 1 (∫ du - ∫ du ) 3 – u2 u2 – 3 √3 u + √3 ∫ u - √3 = 1 (ln/u + √3/ - ln/u - √3/) + C √3ln/ tan 2/2 + √ 3 / + C tan2/2 - √3 Example: Find ∫ dx .

∆xr and the integration of f(x).
You discovered that when f(x) is continuous on a≤ x ≤ b then the limit lim ∑f(x) ∆x = F(b) as ∆x 0.
In unit 1 you applied the above when finding the area under the curve of f(x) within the interval [a,b].
In this unit you shall extend the concept of area under a curve to the following, area between two curves.
Distance traveled can be calculated by integrating the velocity v = f(t) of the body.
Here v = f(t) ≥ 0 1 and continuous function of t within a specified interval of time t. In the next unit calculation of volumes of a solid of revolution will be treated as wellas computing the work done by a body.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly (i) evaluate area between two curves (ii) calculate the distance traveled by a body moving with a velocity v = f(t) (iii) calculate volumes of any solid of revolution 3.0 AREA BETWEEN TWO CURVES Suppose you consider two continuum functions f(x) and f(x) in a closed interval [a, b].
Suppose that f (x) ≥ f (x) for all XЄ [a, b].
Then the curve of 1 2 f (x) is always above the curve of f (x).
(see fig.

9.1 To calculate the area between the two curves you will consider the area under curve f(x) and the vertical lines x = a and x = b then the area above curve f (x) and the vertical lines x = a and x = b.
To understand this cut out a 2 rectangular STRIP OF WIDTH ∆X.
You will not find it difficult to know that the length of the rectangular strip is y – y .
Therefore, the area of 1 2 rectangular strip is (y – y ) .∆ = [f (x) – f (x)].∆x.
Using the concept studied 1 2 1 2 in unit 1, the area under the two curves will be given by the sum of the areas of the rectangular strip i.e.
b A ≈ ∑ [f (x) – f (x)] ∆x = ∫ (f (x) – f (x) dx 1 2 1 2 a If you allow ∆x 0 then you can obtain the exact area as b A = lim ∑ [f (x) – f (x)] ∆x = ∫ (f (x) – f (x) ) dx 1 2 1 2 a ∆x 0 Example: Find the area bounded by the parabole y = -2x.
Solution: The first step is to know which curve is the upper boundary and which is the lower boundary.
This can be achieved by plotting the curves on the same rectangular axes.
See fig.

Y A 4 NOUN 110MTH 122 Integral Calculus X -10 -1 2 4 10 BC y = - 3X y = 4 – x2 Fig 9.2 Second step is to know where the curves intersect.
This you can do by finding points that satisfy both equations simultaneously.
That is you solve 4 – x2 = -3x x2 – 3x – 4 = 0 (x – 4 Xx + 1) = 0 x = 4 or -1 Thus the curves intersect at A(-1, 3) and B(4, - 12).
For values of XЄ [ -1, 4] the curve y = 4 –x2 is above the line y = -3x by an amount (4 – x2) – (-3x) = 4 + 3x – x2 therefore the area between the two curves is given as ∫4 (4 + 3x – x2) dx = 4x + 3x 2 - x 3 /4 -1 2 3 -1 = 125 6 sq units Example: Find the area bounded the parabola y = x2 – 2 and the strainght line y = 2x + 1.
Step1.Plotting the curves on the same graph gives you what you find in Fig.

Consider two f(x) and g(x) shown in Fig 9.4 y f(x) b x a x x 1 2 g(x) Fig 9.4 In fig 9.4 neither f(x) or g(x) remains positive, i.e.
f(x) > g(x) XЄ [a x ] and 1 1 XЄ [x , b] while g(x) > f(x) for XЄ [x , x ].
Then the area is given as ∫x f(x) – 2 1 2 1( a g(x)) dx + ∫x (g(x) – f(x)) dx + ∫b(f(x) – g(x) dx = ∫x/f(x) – g(x)/dx + ∫x /f(x)- g(x)/dx 2 2 x x a x 1 2 1 NOUN 112MTH 122 Integral Calculus Under each integral sign, the upper curve is written first.
If you compute just ∫b (f(x) – g(x) dx the areas will be counted with opposite signs and may cancel out to give you a zero value.

Then the distance traveled is given as: b b ∫ds = ∫ f(t) dt a a b S = ∫ f(t) dt a So if you integrate the velocity function you can get the distance traveled by a body.
Example: A boy enters a car at time t = 0.
After tsecs, the velocity of the car is 10t3m/s.
How far does the car move during the first 1 sec?
Solution: Think of the time t = 0 and t = 1 sec.

2 2 Solution: ∫ f(t) dt = ∫ 92t + 1) dt 0 0 2 = t2 + t / 0 = 6m Example: A ball is thrown up from the ground at t = 0.
At time t its velocity is 30 – 20t m/s.
After 3secs, the ball hhits the ground.
How far has it traveled?
Solution: In this example, you will encounter a negative velocity which will result to negative distance.
This is simply because of the fact that at the NOUN 117MTH 122 Integral Calculus maximum height attained the ball falls back towards the ground.
The movement backwards is measured as negative velocity and negative distance (see Fig 9.10).
0 t/2 t Fig.
10 v = f(t) ≥0 tЄ[0, t/2] v = f(t) ≤0 tЄ[ t/2, t] t t/5 t Therefore S = ∫/f(t)/ dt = ∫ /f(t)/ dt + ∫ /f(t)/ dt 0 0 t/2 Apply the above to the problem you set t = 3, v = 30 – 20t 7 3/2 3 then ∫ /30 – 20t/ dt = ∫ (30 – 20) dt + ∫ (20t – 30) dt 0 0 3/2 3/2 3 = 30t – 10t2/ + 10t2 – 30t/ 0 3/2 = 45 + 45 = 45m 2 2 3 In the above example, ∫ (30 – 20t)dt = 0.
This is because the ball moves 0 45/2m with positive velocity (upwards) and 45/2m with negative velocity (downwards).
The integral, however, counts these distances with opposite signs so they cancel out.

You observed that when the curves crossed one another, the sum of the areas cancel out.
As such caution is applied when finding areas bounded by two crossing curves.
That is the curve that is above within a given region is ued first in the integral.
You have studied how distance traveled by a body with a constant.
Velocity can be calculated by integrating the velocity function within a given interval of time.

And (ii) volume of a solid.
The method that will be adopted in finding the volume of a solid by integration is to slice the solid into numerous thin pieces, each of which is approximately a familiar shape of a known volume.
The above could be executed in four steps (1) choose a method of slicing the solid (2) choose a variable x which locates the typical slice and find the range of values of x that applies to the problem.
(3) compute the volume f(x) dx of a typical slice and finally (4) find anti-derivative (integration) of f(x) and compute ∫bf(x)dx where xЄ[a, b].
a The four steps enumerated above will be useful in finding volumes of any solid by integration.
2.0 OBJECTIVES: After studying this unit, you should be able to: (i) compute the work done by applying a force on an object alng a line.
(ii) Compute the volume of a solid.
3.0 WORK When a constant force F(N) is applied along a distances in the work done, (Nm) is the product of force and distance.
i.e.
Work = W = F.s suppose an object is moved along a straight line fro x = a to x = b by a force of magnitude f(x).
Dividing the interval [a, b] into sub-intervals of length ∆x then the work done moving the object from xei to xi is approximately -1 f(xl).∆xi since ∆x0 this force is constant.
The total work done will then be the sum of work done in each subinterval.
This is given as: b Total Work = ∫ f(x) dx a Example: Suppose at each point of the x – axis there is a force of (3x2 – x + 1)N pulling an object.
Find the work done in moving it from x = 1 to x = 3.
NOUN 121MTH 122 Integral Calculus 3 3 Solution: Work = ∫(3x2 – x + 1) dx = x3 – U x U + x/ 1 = 24 An interesting example of this can be derived from Newton’s Law of Gravitation.
Example: Given that two bodies pull at each other with a force F = k Mm where M and m afd their masses respectively and x is distance between x2 Them.
If one of the bodies is fixed at origin, how much work is done in moving the other body from x = 1 to x = 3?
(Assume k, M, and m are known)?
Solution: 3 W = ∫ f(x) dx = ∫ kMn dx 1 x2 3 3 = kMm∫ 1 dx = -kMm 1 / = 2 kMn.
1 x2 x 1 3 For most springs, there is a law governing their functions.
According to the law known as Hooke’s law when a spring is stretched a short distance there is a compressing or restoring force proportional to the amount of stretching.
This force is given as F = cx where x is the amont the spring has been displaced from its natural or unstressed length and c is a spring constant.
Beyond this range, the spring will become unreliable and unpredictable.
Example: A spring has a natural length of L = 0.20m.
A force of 1N streches the spring to a length of 0.21m.
Find the spring constant.
Find the amount of work required to stretch the spring from its natural length to a length of 0.22m.
Calculate the amount of work done in stretching the spring from 0.21m to 0.22m.
Solution: F = 1, extra length = .20 – 21 = 0.1m then F = cx 1 = c(0.1) c = 1/0.1 = 10.
To calculate the work done in stretching the spring 0.02m beyond it natural length, you have W = ∫0.02 10x dx = x2/.02 = 2 + 10-3N 0 0 NOUN 122MTH 122 Integral Calculus To find the work done in stretching the spring from a length of 0.21m to a length of 0.22m you compute W = ∫0.02 10x dx = 1.5 x 10-3N.
0.01 Example: Find the work done by a force f(x) = 2x + 3 N in moving an object from x = 1m to x = 5m.

3.1 VOLUMES In this section you will study how to find the volumes of solids by integration.
Before doing this, you will compute the area of circle and then extend the same methd to that of computing the volumes of solids.
Examples: Find the area of a circle of radius r. Where the circumference is given as C = 2Лr.
Solution: Step 1.
Cut the circle into this concentric rings (Fig 10.0) r dx Fig.
10.0 NOUN 123MTH 122 Integral Calculus Step 2: Let x denote the distance of a ring from the centre as shown in Fig 10.1 here 0 ≤x ≤ r. Step 3: The length of any ring is given as 2Лx and the width is dx.
Thus the area of a typical ring is given as 2лx dx.
The area of the circle is therefore given as the sum of areas of the concentric rings.
r i.e.
A = ∫ 2лx dx.
0 = Лx2/r = Лr2 which is the area of a circle with radius r. Volume of Revolution: The volumes of many solids can be found by the method of slicing describd above.
Before you continue it is necessary to define what is meant by solid of revolution A solid which has a central axis of symmetric is called a solid of revolution.
Most solid that will be consider in this unit are solid of revolution.
For example, a cone, a cylinder, a bucket etc.
To find the volume of such solid displayed in fig.
10.1 you irst consider the area under the region AB of the curve y = f(x) revolved about the x - axis y y = f(x) A x 0 a b d v Fig 10.1 through 3600.
Each point on the curve represents a circle with centre on the x-axis.
A solid of revolution as displayed in Fig 10.1 hs two circular plane ends cutting the x-axis at x = a at x = b.
As ws done in the example of the area of a circle.
Let v be the volume of the solid of revolution from x = a up to any value XЄ (a, b) see Fig 10.2 y y + dy NOUN 124MTH 122 Integral Calculus x x + dx x a dx Fig 10.2 Showing a cross section of solid of revolution Suppose thee is an increment in x i.e.
dx with a corresponding increment in y, dy and increment in V, dv.
In fig 10.2 he volume of the slice with thickness dx is given by dv and is enclosed between two cylinders of outer radius y = dy and inner radius y.
Thus Лy2 sx = sv ≤Л (y + sy)2 dx Лy2 ≤ sv ≤ Л(y + sy)2 ___ (A) sx hence as sx 0 , sx 0 and sv dv sx dx thus (A) becomes y2 ≤ dv ≤ Лy2 dx dv = Лy2 integrating both sides you have V = ∫ Лy2 dx where y = f(x) a continuous function and V is the volume of solid generated when the curve y = f(x) is rotated through 3600 around the x-axix between the limits x = a and x = b.
Example: The region in the x-y plane bounded by the curve y = x2, the line x = 0 and x = 3 and the x = axis is revolved about x – axis.
What is the resulting volume?
Solution: See Fig (10.3) V = ∫3 Лy2 dx 0 y = x2 NOUN 125MTH 122 Integral Calculus V = ∫3Л x4dx 0 0 3 = Лx 5 /3 = 243Л 5 0 5 Fig 10.3 Example: Let the region be revolved around the y –axis from x = 0 to x = 2.
