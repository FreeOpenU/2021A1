EXERCISE 6 STUDY OF PROCEDURE FOR STOCK VERIFICATION AND MAINTENANCE OF APPARATUS 6.1 INTRODUCTION Earlier in this course you have read about the requirements of laboratories.
You also know that these requirements can be for consumable and non-consumable nature.
Once such items are purchased and put into the stock of the laboratory, it becomes important to monitor their availability, use and maintenance.
All the records related to the purchase, use and maintenance of lab items should be entered into the register.
You have already read about such registers i.e., inventory register/stock register in Unit 5 of the LOM course.
In the previous exercises you have learnt how to make purchases for lab requirements and make entries in the stock register.
In the present exercises you will perform activities regarding study of stock register and physical verification of the articles present in the lab as recorded in the stock registers.
You will also be involved in preparing the list of missing or the excess items and writing to the dealers about servicing and maintenance of the apparatus.
Objectives After completing this exercise you should be able to check the stock register, verify the physical presence of articles present hi the lab as per the stock register, prepare the list of the items that are found missing subsequent to stock verification, and communicate with the dealers about repair, servicing or maintenance of the apparatus/instruments.
Useful Instruction You should go through Unit 5 of the LOM course before doing this exercise.
This exercise is a mix of demonstration and hands on activities.
Take the help of your counsellor in case you do not understand any aspect of stock register and stock verifications.
Before actually doing this exercise go through the text of this exercise thoroughly.
6.2 REQUIREMENTS  Stock register of a science laboratory  Loose paper sheets  Pen  Pencil  Rubber 6.3 ACTIVITY 1 VERIFICATION OF STOCK REGISTER A stock register is an important component of any official establishment in which records related to purchase, use and maintenance of all the items is documented.
The first activity regarding stock register is a demonstration activity.
Your counsellor will discuss the various components of stock register in your group.
Procedure On opening the stock register, you will see that the first page contains a certificate which certifies the total number of pages in that register.
This page is signed by two persons.
Generally, one of these is a lab assistant/technical assistant and the other is the Head of the Department or administration incharge.
After knowing the number of pages you must physically verify the presence of the certified number of pages in the stock register.
If any page of this register is found missing bring it to the notice of your counsellor.
As you have read in Unit 5 of this LOM, few pages after the certificate page of the register are the index pages (content pages) that indicate the name of the articles and the number of sequence pages assigned to each article.
You may also recall that the names of the articles are given in alphabetical order.
Now match the list of articles on index page(s) with the respective sequence pages.
In case you find a sequence page missing, you can check it from the index and find out the items about which the information is missing.
You can see in the pages annexed (Stock Register and Stock Book) to this exercise two examples of the sequence pages of the stock registers.
As stated earlier you may find small variations in different registers, however, the main information is the same in every register.
6.4 ACTIVITY 2 VERIFICATION OF STOCK ITEMS Now you know that a stock register is the key for the verification of all the items purchased from time to time.
Let us now perform the second activity of this exercise i.e., stock verification.
Procedure Verify the physical presence of the items kept in the stock that are listed in the register.
For this choose any alphabet in the index and take at least two items listed under that alphabet.
You should select the items that are listed serialwise and not randomly.
Say for example under the letter 'A' you will find in alphabetical order, the name of all the items beginning with the letter 'A' that are present in the stock, e.g., alcohol, ammeter, analogue multimeter, autoclave, etc.
Likewise you will find the list of articles under alphabets B, C ....... and so on up to Z.
Now from the index find out the sequence pages of the articles you have chosen to verify.
For example from the page 'A' of the index of stock register you have selected "autoclave".
From the index find out the sequence page number(s) allotted to "autoclave".
Open these sequence pages and read the information given about "autoclave".
Make a note of the article and its details like brand (make), details of issues such as purchase date and number, net quantity etc.
In this way you select two items, check the details of these items in the sequence pages and prepare a list in the columns under report I.
You should not repeat the items, which other students of your group are dealing with.
In your group all the students should preferably select different items.
Show the list of the items, you have to verify, to your counsellor and take his/her approval.
Seldom it may also happen that sequence pages about any item are completely missing.
If so is the case inform your counsellor.
You have to write the make/brand and quantity mentioned in the last entry from the specified pages of the stock register in the table given under Report I.
For Mode-1 students: All the four Activities of this Exercise are to be performed at the individual level at the work centre.
S. No.
Name of item Make Quantity 1 2 6.5 ACTIVITY 3 PREPARATION OF A LIST OF MISSING/SURPLUS/ NON FUNCTIONAL ITEMS After the second activity you will enter into Activity 3 i.e.
verification of the stock leading to preparation of a list of items that are missing, surplus, broken or nonfunctional.
As indicated in Activity 2 after going through the indexed list of the items alphabetically in the stock register you must verify the physical presence and status of these items in the laboratory.
For example again take the case of an 'autocalve'.
Now visit the lab/store and see whether it is physically present in the lab or not.
If it is present, check whether the specifications and information given about the autoclave in the stock register match with the autoclave available in the lab.
Also see in what condition it is.
Is it in working condition, if not, can it be sent for servicing or repair?
You must also verify the quantity of the stock available and number of items used with the latest entries in the issue and balance columns of the register.
After completing this exercise you should prepare a list of the items missing, surplus broken or non-functional, if any, in alphabetical order.
If the item is non-functional, write whether it is repairable or non-repairable.
In case of the non-functional items one should contact the dealer for repair.
Regular maintenance of the apparatus is also an important activity for any science laboratory.
You will perform this as the next activity.
The apparatus/instruments) that has become non-functional, beyond repair or obsolete needs to be disposed off.
You will perform the activity related to the disposal of such an instrument later in this course.
For this exercise select the same two items as taken for Report I.
Check the details of the status of these items from the lab/store and write the information in the table given under Report II.
Show this report to your counsellor.
Report II S. No.
Name of the Item Missing/Surplus Broken/Non-functional: Repairable/Non- repairable 1.
2.
6.6 ACTIVITY 4 MAINTENANCE OF APPARATUS Regular maintenance of the lab items such as apparatus/instruments) is a necessary exercise in any laboratory.
Maintenance includes proper cleaning, regular servicing, repairing and proper storing to keep the apparatus/ instrument(s) in proper working condition.
In this activity you will learn to contact the dealer for the servicing or repairs of the apparatus/instrument.
Servicing of the instruments can be done in the following two ways.
I.
According to the service contract with the firm/agency from where you have acquired the apparatus/instrument.
(Generally in such cases payment for service contract for a specific time such as one year is made while making the purchase or immediately after the warranty period is over.
This type of servicing is called preventive maintenance and the contract is renewed annually.
The apparatus/ instrument(s) can be serviced regularly without the annual contract also.
But in such cases payment is to be made every time the servicing is done.
II.
As and when any apparatus/instrument goes out of order and needs repair.
This type of servicing is known as repair maintenance.
When the instrument is under service contract, the firm or the agency sends its own people at required intervals for servicing/repair of that instrument.
A record of the contract and the servicing of the instrument(s) is maintained in the lab.
In this activity you will write a letter to the firm/agency about servicing/ repair/replacement of the instrument you have purchased from that dealer.
The firm/agency will send an engineer to look into the type of problem and rectify it.
After the work is accomplished you should check that the repair/servicing work is successfully accomplished i.e., the instrument is now in perfect working condition.
If payment is to be made for the servicing/repair work, you must sign the bills submitted by the dealer and give the same to your superior responsible for processing and payment of the bill.
By now you know how to write an official letter.
Given below is the format of the letter you will use to write to the dealer for repair, service or replacement of a laboratory equipment.
Show your letter to your counsellor.
The detail information about the equipment should be clearly mentioned in the letter.
The name of the item, its detail and information about the dealer/manufacturer will be provided to you by your counsellor.
All the students in your group should write individual letters.

You have learnt that most of the electrical accidents like shock, fire, etc.
occur often due to the neglect of fundamentals of electricity.
The cause may be as simple as an improper wiring, a wrong choice of the fuse or wire (over- or underrated), or a problem with the earthing of the equipment.
You have learnt about the theoretical basis of these functional aspects of electricity.
You would have appreciated that through proper electrical maintenance/safe conduct, the mishaps due to electrical equipment can be minimised.
In this exercise we intend to provide you with some practical experience in electrical maintenance.
You will do activities like, calculating the amount of current drawn by given appliance/instrument/equipment, suggesting proper procedures for wiring a plug, constructing a continuity testing device and using it to check the earthing of an appliance.
This will enable you to observe general precautions in the laboratory and undertake (if required) preliminary steps like, checking the wire / fuse / earthing of an appliance, if it is not working properly.
It is like giving a first aid till the doctor (electrician in the present case) comes.
We do not intend to make electricians out of you.
Objectives After performing the activities under this exercise you should be able to:  calculate the current drawn by a given instrument/equipment /appliance and suggest a fuse rating and the kind of plug to be used for the appliance,  connect a plug to the wire of an appliance,  construct and test the continuity testing device, and  check the effectiveness of earthing in a given appliance using the continuity testing device.
Useful Instruction You are advised to give a reading to Unit 11 before taking up this exercise.
7.2 ACTIVITY 1 TO CALCULATE CURRENT DRAWN BY THE GIVEN APPLIANCES AND SUGGEST PROPER FUSE RATING AND PLUG TYPE In subsection 1.2.2 of Unit 1 of the course Hazards in Laboratory and Laboratory Safety (hereafter referred to as HLLS), you have learnt how to calculate the current drawn by an appliance by using the formula, 1= W/V.
You are going to use this formula here to calculate the current rating of the given appliances.
7.2.1 Requirements Any 4-5 electrical appliances in the lab.
7.2.2 Procedure  Take any appliance/ equipment in the laboratory e.g., the oven, electric heater, sodium lamp, immersion rod, the vacuum pump, autoclave, heating mantle, refrigerator, incubator, electrical balance or any other electrical equipment.
 Locate the specification plate of the equipment.
Normally it is fixed at the back side or under the instrument or on the side panels.
 Note down the wattage of the equipment and calculate the operating current after noting down the mains voltage, use the formula / = W/V.
 Suggest the fuse rating for the equipment on the basis of current calculation.
 Write down the type of plug (6/16 A) to be used for the same.
 Repeat the procedure for at least three more equipment/appliances.
 Show the table to your counsellor for evaluation.
7.2.3 Report The details of operating current, suggested fuse rating and recommended plug are given below.
S. No.
Name of the Wattage Mains Operating Suggested* Type of plug equipment (W) voltage (V) current (I) fuse rating recommended I=W/V 6A/16A 1.
2.
3.
4.
You would recall that suggested fuse rating is 20% (1/5 time) larger than the calculated current Therefore, suggested fuse rating = calculated current  6/5 7.3 ACTIVITY 2 WIRING A PLUG TO AN APPLIANCE In the previous activity, you worked out the operating current of different electrical equipment/appliances and suggested proper fuse and plug ratings for the same.
In this activity you will take any one equipment, without a plug attached to its cable and learn how to connect a suitable plug to it.
You may be knowing the procedure or might have connected plugs a number of times; yet you are expected to do this activity because it is linked to the next activity.
Also, in the course of doing it, you might pick up some important tips.
7.3.1 Requirements Screwdriver - 1 Wire stripper - 1 6/16APlug-l Electrical appliance (any, without plug) - 1  7.3.2 Procedure  Unscrew the plug top with the help of a screwdriver.
Remove one of the screws on the wire clamp and loosen the other.
 Cut away about 50 mm of the outer sheath of the flex, taking care not to damage the insulation on the three separate wires.
 Fasten the sheath firmly under the clamp so that the terminals in the plug are not under strain.
 Cut the wires to reach about 10 mm beyond the appropriate terminal.
You would recall from unit 1, subsection 1.2.1 of the HLLS course, that the green, red and black wires are to be attached to the earth, live and neutral terminals, respectively.
 Use the wire strippers to remove sufficient insulation to expose enough wire to make the connections taking care not to damage the wires.
 Twist the strands of each wire in turn and fit them into the hole or loop them clockwise around the terminal and tighten the screw.
 Check that there are no stray 'whiskers' of bare wire which could cause short circuits with in the plug and check that the wires are connected to the correct terminals.
 Check that the screws holding the wires in place are tight enough.
 Refit the plug top with the help of a screwdriver.
 Draw a diagram showing the connections you have made.
You may use colour pencils to make it very clear and, show the plug to your counsellor.
7.3.3 Report The plug has been connected as per instructions and submitted for scrutiny.
The drawing of the same is given below.
7.4 ACTIVITY 3 TO ASSEMBLE A CONTINUITY TESTING DEVICE AND TO USE IT FOR CHECKING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EARTHING IN AN APPLIANCE In subsection 1.2.4 of Unit 1 of course HLLS, you read about earthing as an essential requirement for all instruments which are not insulated.
Since improper earthing is a potential electric hazard in the laboratory, we must ensure that all the appliances are properly earthed.
To perform this simple but extremely important act of electrical maintenance, you need a device and also know how g are 'to use it.
In this activity you are going to assemble and handle such a device.
7.4.1 Requirements Cell holder - 1 Bulb holder - 1 Wire - 1 Bulb (2.0 V) - 1 Cells (1.5V) - 2 Plug (6/16 A) - 1 Screwdriver - 1 Crocodile clips - 1 pair Wire stripper - 1 7.4.2 Procedure There are two parts of this activity.
Part A deals with the assembling of the continuity testing device (CTD) and Part B deals with checking the effectiveness of earthing.
The procedures for these two are given under these two heads.
A.
Assembling the Device  Take three pieces of wires about half a meter long each.
 Connect one of the terminals of the cell holders to one of the terminals of the bulb holder using a wire.
 Connect the second terminal of the bulb holder to second piece of wire.
 The third piece of wire is attached to the second terminal of the cell holder.
 Connect a crocodile clip each to the two unconnected ends of the wire.
 Insert the cells in the cell holder in proper position, ensuring that the (+) and (-) terminals of the cells are according to the (+) and (-) sign marked on the holder.
 Insert the bulb in the bulb holder.
 Short the two unconnected terminals and check whether the bulb is  glowing or not - if it does not glow, there is a possibility that the bulb is not fitted properly.
You can consult your counsellor at this stage.
If the bulb glows, your device is ready.
Draw a sketch of the device you have assembled in the space provided in the subsection 7.4.3.
IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE PLUG'S EARTH AND LIVE PIN IT INDICATES DANGER.
B.
Checking the Continuity and Effectiveness of Earthing in an Equipment/Appliance  Take any appliance, say, a heater or an oven or any instrument used in tin lab and locate where the lead is entering the instrument.
Open the plate covering it with the help of a screwdriver.
 You will see three connections there which may be differently placed in different appliances.
Locate and identify E, L and N for earth, live and neutral connections, respectively.
If you look closely these are normally written near the connecting screws.
 Clamp one of the ends of the continuity testing device on to the earth pin of the plug and other one on the earth connection in the appliance.
A bright glowing bulb indicates the continuity.
 Repeat the above with live (L) and neutral (N) pins also by connecting the live pin of the plug to the live pin of appliance and the neutral to the neutral.
 To check the effectiveness of earthing, fit one end of the CTD to earth pin 1 on the plug and other to the chassis of the appliance.
A bright glow indicates good earth while a dim glow means the earthing is poor.
The bulb would not glow if there is no earth circuit.
 Record your observations in the table given in the next subsection.
7.4.3 Report 1.
The diagram of the assembled CTD is given below.

You would have realised from personal experience (if any) and in the course of your study of Unit 1 of the HLLS course that these services can also be potential hazards in the laboratory.
For example, water can get sprinkled on an electrical socket by a leaking tap leading to a short circuit followed by, may be a fire.
In case of an eventuality, probably the first and foremost step would be cutting down the supply of gas, electricity, or water to the lab.
This necessarily means that one must know the respective control points.
In fact, this exercise is intended to familiarise you regarding the source and the control points of all these essential services.
Objectives After completing this exercise you should be able to:  locate the source and control points of gas/electricity/water supply in the  lab you have visited,  describe the distribution of these services in the lab, and  state the measures to be taken in case of emergency situations concerning  their supply.
Useful Instructions You may perform this exercise preferably in a chemistry lab.
This exercise can be performed in a group of 3-4 students.
You may read Unit 1 and Unit 11 before taking up this exercise.
For Mode-1 students: This exercise is an individual level Activity to be performed at the Work Centre.

EXERCISE 9 IDENTIFICATION OF COMPRESSED GASES AND STUDY OF THEIR HANDLING AND STORAGE 9.1 INTRODUCTION You would recall from your study of Unit 1 of the course HLLS, that LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and other compressed gases can pose a danger in the lab.
The gas (LPG) supply distribution has been covered in the previous exercise and the main danger associated with it i.e.
fire is dealt in the next exercise.
In the context of compressed gases you had learnt about the colour codes used to indicate the content and nature of the gas in the cylinder.
You would have realised that these cylinders being heavy objects are potential mechanical hazards.
The hazards of gas cylinders are further increased by the toxic/ reactive properties of their contents.
You have learnt about the precautions to be observed in the storage and handling of these gas cylinders.
In this exercise you will be using the gas cylinder colour codes to identify the contents of the gas cylinder and study about their storage and handling in the lab.
Objectives After doing this exercise you should be able to:  identify the contents of the gas cylinder by observing the colour code,  state the nature of the gas present in the cylinder,  explain the steps to be taken in case of gas cylinder leakage, and  assess the compressed gas storage and handling in the lab.

You also learnt about various types of fire extinguishers available to stop fire and also how to use the extinguishers effectively.
As you are aware, the laboratories, especially the chemical j laboratories, pose a potential risk of fire due to the nature of work being done; and the chemicals being stored and used.
Appropriate provisions for the storage and handling methods go a long way towards minimising the hazards.
We have discussed these aspects in Unit 2 and Unit 3 of the HLLS course.
Nevertheless, there is always a probability of fire.
A suitable training to the technical staff of the laboratory is essential for effectively dealing with fire accidents.
In this exercise, you will be doing two activities related to the fire safety measures.
In the first activity you are going to survey the labs for their fire preparedness i.e.
how well the labs are equipped with fire fighting mechanisms in case of a mishap.
In the second activity you will learn about the use of a fire extinguisher.
Objectives After you have completed this exercise, you should be able to:  list all the fire extinguishers available in the labs and relate them to the type of fire they can be used for,  locate the fire alarm in the lab/institution, and  handle/use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.
Useful Instructions 1.
You are advised to read Unit 2 of the HLLS course again before you take up this exercise.
2.
Ensure that there is a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher available in the lab.
3.
Before starting this activity carefully read the instructions given on the extinguisher.
10.2 ACTIVITY 1 TO SURVEY A LAB FOR ITS FIRE PREPAREDNESS As said earlier in this activity you are going to survey the labs of the institution where you are working at.
Look for the fire safety measures adopted by it.
(Prepare a critical report in the light of what you have studied in Unit 2 of HLLS.
You may  look for different types of fire extinguishers available in the lab.
 make a list of all the types of fire extinguishers and the type of fire they can be used for.
 note the condition of fire extinguishers, their date of inspection or validity.
 check for the positioning and accessibility of the extinguishers.
 conduct a survey to find out how many members of the staff are aware of the placement of fire alarms and use of fire extinguishers.
 look for alternative exit routes and emergency phone numbers in case of an outbreak of fire.
 record your observations in the table and respond to the statement given under report.
10.2.1 Report The following table gives details regarding fire extinguishers in the laboratory s. Type of fire Number of fire Type of fire Date of inspection/ No.

Yes/No (ii) The use of fire extinguishers was known to lab staff.
Yes/No (iii) Alternative exit routes to be used in case of an outbreak of fire were present.
Yes/No (iv) A list of emergency phone numbers was available in the lab.
Yes/No 10.3 ACTIVITY 2 TO LEARN THE USE OF A CARBON DIOXIDE FIRE EXTINGUISHER All chemical laboratories should be provided with carbon dioxide and / or dry chemical fire extinguishers.
Carbon dioxide fire extinguisher is most suitable because labs contain a variety of chemicals and instruments / electronic equipment.
Carbon dioxide extinguisher requires skills for the effective use and these skills can be acquired easily.
This activity is designed as a demonstration exercise where your counsellor would create a mock fire and show how to extinguish it with the help of a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.
You have to write the description of the demonstration in your own words.
10.3.1 Requirements Carbon dioxide fire extinguisher Flammable liquid like petrol, alcohol etc.
10.3.2 Procedure  A mock fire may be created by spilling a flammable liquid like alcohol, petrol etc.
and lighting it at a safe place away from the equipments and working benches.
 The extinguisher is removed from the wall.
Taking a proper position, the extinguisher is opened and the discharge is directed at the base of the fire starting near the edge of the fire as explained in subsection 2.4.2 of Unit 2 of the HLLS course.
 The fire is driven towards the far edge until all the flames are extinguished.
 The extinguisher is closed and replaced on the wall.
10.3.3 Report A brief description of the demonstration exercise is given below.
______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ EXERCISE 11 CLASSIFYING AND HANDLING OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS 11.1 INTRODUCTION You have studied about chemical hazards in Unit 3 of the HLLS course and would have learnt that many chemicals are hazardous.
A good practice is to exercise caution in handling all chemicals and minimize your exposure to them.
Further, you would have realised that the labels on the containers / bottles of the chemicals carry a great deal of important information regarding the nature of the chemicals, their important physical properties, potential risks and corresponding warning symbols besides statutory instructions regarding safe usage.
A familiarity with the use/interpretation of labels so as to identify the potential hazard of a chemical and the precautions to be taken in handling and storage o chemicals are very important for everybody working in the laboratory.
Fume cupboard is an important component of a chemical laboratory.
A knowledge of when and how to use a fume cupboard is also important for a laboratory worker.
This exercise has been designed keeping these objectives in mind.
It consists of two activities.
The first activity is a familiarization activity.
It gives you a chance to look into the label of some common chemicals and interpret the same to get information about the chemicals.
The second activity is a demonstration activity.
In this activity, your counsellor would demonstrate how fume cupboard is useful in handling of hazardous chemicals and their reactions.
Objectives After completing this exercise, you should be able to:  explain the significance of the labels of the bottles containing different chemicals,  classify different chemicals into different hazard types they belong to,  draw the hazard symbol for the different hazard, and  describe a fume cupboard and its use in the laboratory.
Useful Instruction You are advised to read subsection 3.3.2 of Unit 3 of the HLLS course before you take up this exercise.
11.2 ACTIVITY 1 TO CLASSIFY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS BASED ON THE INFORMATION GIVEN ON THE LABELS 11.2.1 Requirements Bottles containing chemicals (generally used in a lab)  20 in number.
11.2.2 Procedure For this activity, your counsellor will provide you with around 20 bottles of different chemicals.
Take any two bottles at a time from the lot to your seat.
Read the labels of the bottles carefully and try to gather as much information as you can for a given chemical.
Record the same in the table given below.
An example has been given to guide you for the same.
You will have to record on the similar fashion for at least ten bottles of chemicals.
CARE: Don't hold the bottles from their neck.
You may use a tray for carrying them.

*For identifying class, refer to subsection 3.3.1 of Unit 3 of the HLLS course and see that a given chemical may belong to more than one type of hazard class.
Note: What do you observe?
Do you realise that the common chemicals you lave been handling casually at your laboratory (if any, with which you are working) are quite hazardous and need special care in handling.
You may preserve this table and display it at a convenient place in the laboratory where you work.
You may make this table more exhaustive.
11.3 ACTIVITY 2 TO LEARN THE HANDLING OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS: USE OF FUME CUPBOARD You have read in Unit 2 of the course LOM and Unit 3 of the course HLLS about the importance of fume cupboard and its usage.
There are many chemicals which are very corrosive causing serious burns to skins and eyes and give away poisonous vapours when the container is opened.
Bromine, carbon tetrachloride and organic solvents are some examples.
Also, there could be a chemical reaction which results in the production of corrosive fumes with violent reaction, foul smell etc.
for example, nitration, benzoylation and bromination reactions etc.
For such chemicals and chemical reactions, a fume cupboard is to be used.
You know how a fume cupboard looks like.
Your counsellor will demonstrate some chemical reaction showing the use and significance of fume cupboard.
11.3.1 Requirements Apparatus and Chemicals - to be arranged by the counsellor depending upon the experiment to be carried out in the fume cupboard.
Fume cupboard 11.3.2 Procedure Observe carefully the demonstration of the reaction carried out by your counsellor in the fume cupboard.
Submit the report to your counsellor in the format given below.
11.3.3 Report A schematic diagram of the fume cupboard is given below.
Positions for supply of gas, water and electricity and, ventilation is indicated.
A brief description of the experiment is given below: ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ The fume cupboard is needed for the experiment for the following reason(s): ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ EXERCISE 12 STUDY OF STERILIZATION AND SAFE DISPOSAL steps METHODS OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS 12.1 INTRODUCTION In any laboratory dealing with biological experiments, hazards can occur mainly due to chemicals and biological materials.
In the previous exercise you have done the activity of classifying hazardous chemicals and you also learnt the skill of handling such chemicals.
In this exercise you will carry out the activities related to the disposal of biological materials after the experimental work with such materials is over.
Disposal activities are related to microorganisms and dead animals.
Since these materials cause contamination and infections very rapidly, more care is required in their disposal.
Disposal of plant materials is comparatively simpler.
Put all the used plant materials in a disposable bag, seal or tie the bag and put it in the waste collecting bins.
Objectives After completing this exercise you will be able to:  sterilize and dispose off microbial cultures,  dispose off the carcass of laboratory animals and the experimental animals treated with radioactive materials.
Useful Instructions It is advisable that you should go through Unit 4 of the course HLLS before going for this exercise.
Handling the microbes and dead animals requires precautions.
It is important to wear gloves and aprons while doing the activities and wash the hands with disinfectant before and after doing the activity.
12.2 ACTIVITY 1 DISPOSAL OF MICROBIAL CULTURES After the study is finished microbial cultures should not be left in the laboratory or taken out of the laboratory alive because availability of the medium can help many other types of microbes to grow in abundance, and as you are aware many of the microbes are pathogenic.
The non- pathogenic microbes also cause problems like infections if they grow in abundance.
12.2.1 Requirements Autoclave Microbial cultures - liquid/solid Disinfectant Spatula Disposable bags 12.2.2 Procedure Steps 1 to 3 and step 5 are demonstration steps and will be performed by your counsellor.
Observe these steps carefully.
1.
The cotton plugs/caps of the test tubes, flasks and bottles containing microbial cultures are loosened so that during autoclaving adequate heat can penetrate into the bottle/test tube/flask to kill the microbes.
2.
The cultures in glass flasks, bottles, tubes and petridishes at 15 psi are autoclaved for 15 minutes at 120°C so that the microbes are killed.
If a pressure cooker is used for this purpose, it is to be heated for 30 minutes after the pressure is formed.
3.
After pressure in the autoclave is completely down, i.e.
at zero, the lid of the autoclave is opened.
The glassware containers are allowed to cool down for some time and then taken out carefully one by one from the autoclave so that culture material is not spilled out.
4.
After the counsellor has taken out the glassware from the autoclave, with the help of a spatula empty the autoclaved culture material from the flasks/bottles/test tubes/petriplates in a disposable bag and seal the bag.
5.
This autoclaved culture material can be disposed off by two methods: (i) burying, (ii) incineration.
You will learn the process of burying while performing Activity 3 of this exercise.
Incineration means heating the material at a very high temperature so that biological material is turned into ash.
The incineration is done to destroy the dead culture materials and medium completely so that nutrients are not available for regrowth of microbes.
Keep the material to be incinerated in a heat-resistant container.
Put this container in the incinerator and switch it on.
Do not open the incinerator when the switch is on or until the temperature has come down to zero after the incineration process is over.
Your counsellor will demonstrate the process of incineration for you.
6.
You can dispose the autoclaved material by any of these methods that is available at your study centre.
If you undertake the incineration process, collect the ash in a paper bag, seal it and put this bag in the collecting bin.
For burying, put the autoclaved culture material in a disposable bag and seal it and follow the steps given in Activity 3.
12.2.3 Report Explain in your own words the observed procedural steps of autoclaving of culture materials.
______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 2.
Why is autoclaving necessary before the disposal of culture material?
______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 12.3 ACTIVITY 2 STERILIZATION OF GLASSWARE Activity 1 and Activity 2 are related activities.
Whenever you require the glassware for doing an experiment you can follow the procedure given in Activity 2 independent of Activity 1.
However, Activity 2 has to be performed along with Activity 1.
The glassware used for microbial studies need to be cleaned and sterilized properly.
If not done so, the glassware will get contaminated which can cause health problems as well as contamination of experimental microbial cultures that are used for the purpose of study.
12.3.1 Requirements Glassware like flask, petri plates, test tubes, pippettes Disinfectant Cleaning brush Liquid soap solution Bucket Enamel tray/Steel tray Aluminium foil/Brown paper Oven Cardboard boxes 12.3.2 Procedure 1.
Soak the emptied glassware in disinfectant or liquid soap solution overnight.
If you use disinfectant, dip the glassware in soap solution before washing, Rub clean the glassware with a brush and thoroughly clean with water.
2.
Air dry the washed glassware by keeping them open in the tray.
Cover the petriplates with the lids.
Wrap the glassware with aluminium foil and then keep in the oven for 16 to 18 hours at 160°C for dry sterilization.
You have already read in Unit 3 of THE LOM course about the functioning of a hot air oven.
After sterilization you can reuse the glassware for further work.
3.
Do not leave the sterilized glassware in the open.
Pack them into the packets/boxes until you use them next.
You should sterilize the newly purchased glassware before using them by the method describe above.
In any lab there can be certain apparatus that are delicate and cannot withstand heat such as plastics.
Disinfect these by cleaning and wiping with spirit or any other germicidal chemical used in your study centre/work place.
Dip them in liquid soap solution overnight, wash, air dry and pack them in boxes/packets.
12.3.3 Report Now that you have performed this activity, answer the following questions: 1.
How many glassware items did you sterilize?
2.
What disinfectant have you used for soaking the glassware?
3.
For how long did you keep the washed glassware in a hot air oven?
4.
How did you pack the sterilized glassware?
12.4 ACTIVITY 3 DISPOSAL OF CARCASS After the experiment with an animal is over, the dead animal, i.e.
carcass should not be left in the laboratory.
The dead animals start decaying and putrefying by invasion of microbes and this leads to contamination and foul odour in the lab.
The carcass may be of two types: (1) untreated animals (2) radioactive-treated animals.
You must take care to wear apron and gloves while handling dead animals especially the ones treated with radioactive material.
As said earlier this activity is a demonstration activity.
12.4.1 Requirements Experimental animals Digging and scooping equipment Disposable bags 12.4.2 Procedure 1.
After the dissection experiment is over the dead animals are put in disposable paper bags and the bag is sealed.
Animal tissues and excreta should also be put and sealed in disposable bags.
2.
The packet containing the carcasses, tissues and excreta is taken to a place which has been marked for burying of such biological materials.
3.
A deep pit is dug at the marked place, the packet is put in this pit.
The pit is covered with litter and soil.
If the pit is not dug deep and not covered properly, scavenging and wild animals like hyenas, wolves, dogs etc.
will dig up the pit, may eat the carcass and leave everything in the open.
If the wild animals eat the carcass treated with radioactive material they may fall sick and transmit the radioactivity to other fellow life forms.
To ensure that the pit is not dug up by such animals the pit should be dug deep enough.
4.
The size of the pit depends on the number and size of animals.
For one animal like a frog or a rat a pit of approximately 2'  2'  2' size should dug.
5.
A similar pit is dug to bury the microbial culture materials for their disposal.
12.4.3 Report The following queries are related to this activity.
Tick mark the option that stands correct after your observation.
1.
What kind of bag was used for disposing off the animal(s) and animal materials(s)?
Jute bag/Paper bag/Polythene bag/Cloth bag.
2.
How was the bag sealed?
By folding/By tying/By using tape/By using staples 3.
How deep was the pit?
1'/2'/4'/8' 4.
What material was used for covering the pit?
Soil/Pebbles/Litter/All the three.

The Convenor of the Committee shall submit the report to the Head of the Institution (i.e., the Counsellor).
5.
The Head of the Institution gives his/her approval (in the report itself) suggesting the mode of disposal as (a) 'sale or open auction' or (b) 'to be written off.
6.
You assume that steps have been taken for disposal.
7.
Part II of the report is illustrative of the entry to be made in the stock register/inventory register regarding the disposal of the item.
This entry helps in arriving at the final stock balance.
An extract of the page of the stock register is given as a table in Part II.

Note: (a) and (b): The entries for these columns may be taken from the relevant stock/inventory registers.
(c): Reserve price is the minimum price at which an item may be sold.
The committee has to use its judgement or imagination in fixing reserve price.
 For obsolete and functional items, reserve price may be approximately fixed on the basis of its worth.
 In the case of non-functional items, reserve price may be fixed based on the scrap value.
The scrap value is the approximate price fixed depending on the usable constituents of an item just as a dealer of waste materials does.
 In extreme cases, the Committee may recommend writing off the item, if it is of no commercial value and, the reserve price is taken as zero.
(d): The reason for disposal may be given as: 'unserviceable' or 'obsolete' or 'nonfunctional and of no commercial value' Part II Making Entry in the Extract of the Relevant Page of the Stock Register Name of the item: Name of the stock register: Page no.

(date).
EXERCISE 14 DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL WASTES 14.1 INTRODUCTION In this activity, your Counsellor will perform some experiments illustrating the principles behind some of the disposal procedures.
These principles are given below along with examples of wastes which could be disposed of using particular methods.
1.
Dissolution and dilution Water soluble/ miscible chemical wastes which are harmless in high ° dilution may be run into the drainage with plenty of water.
It may be noted that alkali wastes also come under this category of treatment.
Examples: Acetone, methanol, ethanol, dioxan, acetic acid, ethyl methyl ketone, ammonia (solution), hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid, dimethyl sulphoxide, hydroquinone , p-benzoquinone.
ammonium sulphide, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide.
2.
Evaporation  Highly volatile liquid wastes could be disposed of by effective ventilation.
Example : Diethyl ether.
 Moderately volatile liquid wastes can be absorbed on sand and left for evaporation in an open area.
Examples: Ethyl acetate, hexane, petroleum ether, amyl alcohol, carbon disulphide and carbon tetrachloride.
3.
Emulsification Water immiscible liquid wastes can be emulsified using soap or detergent solution and then run into the drainage.
Examples: Benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, carbon disulphide, cresols, chlorobenzene, and chloroform.
4.
Chemical reactivity  The substances which react violently or produce flame on contact with water can be given suitable chemical treatment to convert them into nonreactive form before running into the drainage.
Example: Sodium metal.
 Those substances which generate heat on mixing with water are treated carefully with large quantity of water in a safe area.
Example: Calcium oxide.
 Acidic chemical wastes are first treated with large quantity of sodium carbonate and then with a large quantity of water.
The treatment with sodium carbonate neutralises the acid since the former is a base.
Apart from acidic waste, bromine waste is also treated using this method.
Examples: Perchloric acid, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, tin (IV) chloride, bromine, chromium trioxide and chromyl chloride.
 Some water immiscible and hazardous materials can be washed into the drainage after changing them into soluble compounds.
Examples: Aniline and iodine.
After carefully watching the demonstration experiments, you have to indicate the linkages between  the principles mentioned above, and  the chemical waste disposal methods discussed in Subsection 5.4.2 of Unit 5 of HLLS for five chemical wastes that will be specified by your Counsellor.
Entries for acetone have been provided as an example in the table given in Sec.
5.4 (HLLS).
For Mode-1 students: The Resource Person will perform the demonstration experiments.
Objectives After observing the demonstration experiments, you should be able to:  state the need for understanding the characteristics of a chemical waste before disposing the same in garbage or drainage, and  explain the principles behind the chemical waste disposal procedures of the demonstration experiments performed by your Counsellor.
Useful Instruction Before observing the demonstration experiments, you are advised to go through Subsec.
5.4.2 of Unit 5 (HLLS) for these and other methods of chemical waste disposal.
14.2 REQUIREMENTS Chemicals The following materials are common for the whole batch of students at the Study Centre, since this is a demonstration exercise.
Acetone (or ethyl methyl ketone or glacial acetic acid or methanol or dioxan) 1 ml Sodium hydroxide (or potassium hydroxide) 1 pellet Diethyl ether 1 ml Ethyl acetate (or hexane or carbon disulphide or petroleum ether or carbon tetrachloride) 1 ml Toluene (or benzene or nitrobenzene or chlorobenzene or chloroform) 1 ml Soap or detergent solution 10 ml Sodium metal 5 small pieces Ethanol (or propan -2-ol) 50 ml Concentrated sulphuric acid 2 ml Sodium carbonate 40 g Calcium oxide (freshly heated and cooled lime stone is 2 g preferable) 2 g Aniline 5 ml 5 ml 2 M Hydrochloric acid 10 ml 10 ml Sodium thiosulphate crystals 5 g 5 g Iodine 2 crystals Apparatus Test tubes 10 Watch glasses 2 100 ml beakers 5 China dish 1 14.3 PROCEDURE Your Counsellor will be performing the following experiments.
You are advised to observe the disposal methods carefully.
Experiment 1: Test for studying miscibility /solubility in water Acetone and sodium hydroxide are tested individually for miscibility/solubility in water.
Experiment 2: Test for studying volatility Diethyl ether and ethyl acetate are tested for volatility using watch glasses.
Experiment 3: Test for studying the process of emulsification Miscibility of toluene is tested with  water and,  soap or detergent solution.
Experiment 4: Test for studying suitable chemical treatment for changing the chemical nature of a substance which is highly reactive with water The reactivity of sodium is tested with  water,  ethanol, and  ethanol containing anhydrous sodium carbonate.
In case ethanol contains considerable water, flame also could be seen during the reaction between sodium and ethanol.
It is preferable to use 2-propanol, if available.
Anhydrous sodium carbonate is helpful in removing water partly from ethanol and, in facilitating a mild reaction by separating sodium pieces during the reaction between sodium and ethanol.
Experiment 5: Test for studying water treatment method for a substance which is fairly reactive with water Reactivity of calcium oxide with water is tested.
Experiment 6: Test for studying suitable chemical treatment for changing the chemical nature of acidic substances The difference in reactivity of sulphuric acid with water is tested in the absence and, presence of sodium carbonate.
Experiment 7: Test for studying suitable chemical treatment for changing; the chemical nature of organic bases which are immiscible with water Miscibility of aniline with water is tested in the absence and, presence of dilute hydrochloric acid.
Experiment 8: Test for studying suitable chemical treatment for changin; the chemical nature of iodine Reactivity of iodine is tested with  water and,  sodium thiosulphate solution.
14.4 REPORT The linkages between the principles mentioned in Section 14.1 of this exercise, and the chemical waste disposal methods discussed in Subsec.
14.4.2 of Unit 14 are given in the following table for five chemical wastes: Name of the chemical Name of the principle of No.

14.1 of this exercise of Unit 14 Acetone Dissolution and dilution I (a) EXERCISE 15 ATTENDING TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS 15.1 INTRODUCTION By doing this exercise, you will learn how to deal with emergency situations arising out of laboratory accidents.
You are aware that a tense situation arises once an accident takes place.
Amidst anxiety and tension, it becomes difficult to plan and execute remedial measures.
No doubt that wiser action will be to identify the causes for the possible accidents and to take preventive measures.
Besides, it is better to be prepared with a plan for follow up actions at least for those accidents which are likely to occur.
In order to face an emergency situation properly, the following would be of great help: (i) Knowledge of first aid procedures (ii) First aid box (properly maintained) (iii) List of emergency contact phone numbers (iv) Communication skill for contacting fire service/hospitals/doctors etc.
It is desirable for you to know the procedure for preparing accident report.
This exercise contains a number of activities requiring your participation at the individual level for some and as a member of a group for others as shown below: * At the individual level, you will be involved in the preparation of  list of contact phone numbers to be used during emergency time,  first aid box, and  a report for an imaginary accident.
* As a member of a group, you will  prepare charts indicating first aid procedures, and  attend a session in which your Counsellor will arrange for demonstration of some first aid procedures.
The contents of Units 1 (on gas related emergencies), 2 (on fire related emergencies) (HLLS COURSE) and the present one could help you in getting adequate training for handling lab related emergencies.
Objectives After doing this exercise, you should be able to:  prepare a list of contact phone numbers required for handling laboratory accidents,  state the contents of first aid box,  assemble an improvised first aid box,  design charts indicating the first aid actions to be taken during common laboratory accidents, and  prepare report for an accident.

You observe the contents.
As part of this activity, you are also to assemble the contents of first aid box as per Table III.
It is advisable to procure all the first aid materials from medical/general merchant shops.
It is also useful to know how to prepare improvised first aid materials such as bandage etc.
This practice will help you in offering first aid to a bleeding victim using locally available materials.
With this purpose, you will assemble a first aid box which contains both  first aid materials (sterilised cotton wool, burnol tube, safety pins, scissors and dettol bottle) which are to be purchased form medical/general merchant shops and  improvised items (clean dressings, clean cotton pads, bandage rolls of various sizes, padded spoon and swab sticks).
Improvised items: To prepare items using locally available source materials.
Preparation of Improvised Items (A) Using a thoroughly washed and sun-dried old and thin cloth of 1½ metres length (which may be cut from an old muslin cloth), prepare the following four items: (i) Individually wrapped clean dressings: You cut one piece each of following sizes using the thin cloth: 1"1"; 2"2"; 2"4"; 6"4" and 6"6" Fold each of them such that the edges are inside and wrap them in clean news papers.
The clean dressings, clean cotton pads, and swab sticks are useful to treat cases of bleeding.
The bandage rolls are useful in keeping the dressing and cotton pad in position.
Bandages help in controlling bleeding and in preventing or reducing swelling.
(ii) Clean cotton pads in separate packets: You are advised to cut one piece each of clean cotton pads of thickness 1/2" and sizes l"l", 6"4" and 6"6".
Cover each from top and below with thin cloth of same size and wrap each with a portion of news paper sheet.
(iii) Bandage rolls: Using thin cloth, cut one piece each of sizes 3'l", 3'2!/ " and 3'3½" 2 and 3'5" and roll each of them separately.
Recommended sizes of roller bandages or bandage rolls for various parts of the body are as follows: Fingers 1" Head and arms 2½ " Leg 3½ " Trunk 5" (iv) Padded spoon: A stainless steel spoon is to be covered with a clean cotton pad of thickness 1/2" and size l"l" prepared in (ii) above.
The padded spoon is useful for keeping the mouth open during resuscitation.
(B) Swab sticks: Wash three sticks taken from a fresh broom.
Cut them into 6" size.
Cover each of them with a bud of cotton.
(C) Triangular bandages: Using a thoroughly washed piece of thick cloth, you can prepare triangular bandages.
You have to cut diagonally a thick piece of cloth of size 38"38" into two pieces.
Each piece is a triangular bandage.
When not is use, the bandage has to be kept folded.
Triangular bandages are used in cases of fracture or severe bleeding.
Old newspaper sheets could also be used in these cases to support the affected area.
Using these materials and, others mentioned in Table II in Sec.
15.2 of this exercise, assemble the first aid box as per Table III.
Keep these materials in a cardboard box or metal box and paste a green paper on it.
A red cross mark may be made on it.

15.3.3 Activity 3: Preparation of Guidance Charts for First Aid Your Counsellor will form groups of four students.
Using the materials from the sections of Unit 6 (HLLS course) mentioned in each case below, each group has to prepare in chart papers the set of guidelines for the first aid concerning the following: (1) Chemical burns (Sec 6.7) (2) Slight bleeding (Sec 6.8) (3) Splashes on the eyes (Subsec 6.10.3) (4) Ingestion of chemicals (Sec 6.7) (5) Thermal burns (Subsec 6.10.1) (6) Shock (Sec 6.9) (7) Electric shock (Sec 6.5) (8) Fainting/unconscious casualties (for cases of breathing and heart beat stoppage - write details of three steps for resuscitation given under the headings, 'Opening the airway, mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration and heart massage for restoring circulation' in Sec.
6.6).
Each of you have to prepare charts for two first aid procedures.
One example is given below.
You may use coloured chart papers as also a format of your choice.
First aid for chemical burns 1.
* Wash the affected area with large amount of running water to remove the chemical substance completely.
* If water is in short supply, wipe the affected area using a clean cloth before the wash. * In case of splash of insoluble chemicals, use soap along with water.

- this might be the question arising in your mind.
If you have not already guessed from the above title, the central theme of this exercise is - oral communication.
While developing this course as a holistic training package, the course-team was quite conscious not to miss out on the component of communication skills.
You had a fairly good grind regarding the development of written skills through your earlier exercises.
Also, Unit 8 (LOM course) entitled 'Scientific Reporting' familiarized you with the theoretical elements and the ways of communication by means of written words.
The main purpose of this exercise is to impress upon you the importance, and the ways of developing and refining the oral communication skills as this is the most commonly used form of communication.
We all use oral communication in one form or the other in our day to day life but its forms of usage at home and at the place of work are different in many ways.
If you work in an academic institution, or a governmental laboratory, then you must be familiar with group discussions, debates, panel discussions, brainstorming sessions, seminars and symposia, and so on.
These are some of the formats of oral communication.
For this exercise, we have chosen the format of group discussion.
This, we thought would be an ideal format considering the time constraint.
The other advantage of this format is that a number of students can share a common platform at a given time, and the audience can also gain by listening to them.
Now your attention is drawn to the main title of the exercise that reads 'Group Interaction....... ' why interaction, and not discussion?
This is because we expect each and every individual in the group to participate actively and share his/her viewpoints and experiences through this exercise.
Another point, whenever you come across the term discussion in this exercise, read it in the sense of interaction.
Objectives While undertaking this exercise and after its completion, you should be able to:  share with your peer group, the relevant information/ knowledge/opinions with regard to the selected topic of discussion;  describe the necessary preparations required for organizing, and participating in a group interaction session;  explain the advantages of such an interaction;  freely interact with your peer group, and others at your workplace about the day to day work, as well as the problems faced, and if required suggest possible corrective measures too; and  critically reflect on the topic discussed.
16.2 HOW TO ORGANISE AN INTERACTION SESSION?
How should we begin?
What are the norms?
What is the time slot?
Any assessment criteria?
These and many such questions may be coming to your mind.
The guidelines given below would help you find answer to all such questions as well as guide you as to how to carry out this exercise.
How to form a group?
-You could begin with by forming your group.
An ideal group has 3 to 5 (maximum number) participants.
Once your group is formed, convey the names of your group members to your counsellor.
Deciding on a topic of discussion - Next identify the topic for interaction.
Eight themes are given in the following section.
You may either choose any one of these, or take any topic other than the ones mentioned here, and decide on the focus of your topic.
The guidelines provided for each of these themes are merely suggestive.
You are free to develop your own set of points for discussion.
After final agreement on the topic and its focus, it will be useful to jot down the objectives.
This would help you to focus your discussion sharply.
The role of each individual in the team - With the mutual consent of the team, each individual can choose his/her role in the group, one person can become a convenor of the team and coordinate the activities of the team including the preparation and circulation of a write-up (more details regarding this are given below).
Another person from the group can become the chairperson whose task is to facilitate a smooth, purposeful transaction of ideas, opinions and information among the participants during the Interaction Session.
The chairperson is also expected to boost the morale of the team, bring in the inhibited participants; and give equal opportunities for discussion to all the group members.
While doing all these he/she also has to watch out that anything in the Interaction Session may not hurt the sensitivities of any person.
Yet another person can be a recorder also known as rapporteur, who can keep a written record of the issues taken up, the suggestions that emerged, the consensus, any strong or differing opinions of the panelists.
Notes-taking itself is a task requiring intense concentration.
Therefore the recorder is usually exempted from participating directly in the discussion.
Any one participant may volunteer to sum up the salient points of discussion.
This job could also be done either by the chairperson or the recorder, this you can decide amongst yourselves.
Your counsellor would always be there, if you need any help.
Knowing the relevant details regarding the Interaction Session - Make sure to enquire about all the details regarding the interaction session, viz., date, time, duration and venue from your counsellor, well in advance.
We feel that a time slot of 1½ to 2 hours duration should be sufficient for one such group interaction session.
This means, you have to do all your home-work or any preparation earlier.
That time is not counted in the time slot mentioned above.
Preparing for the Interaction Session - It is a necessary step for an endeavour like this.
It involves making an in-depth study and thinking deeply about the chosen topic.
In this process one explores the literature, and interacts with people.
This helps in clarifying many points, widening one's perspective and developing an insight into the topic.
We advise you to undergo this rigour.
Rest assured, not only would the quality of your presentation, but also the quality of your participation in the interaction would be of high order!
Preparing and Circulating the Write-up - In order to have a fruitful interaction it is essential that your team prepares a one-page write up - the precise topic, its objectives, and the line of discussion to be taken up at the interaction session.
The write-up may be prepared by the convenor, or any person from the team.
It is always helpful that the person handling this job should interact, and take the inputs of the team members, before finalising the write-up.
This exercise would help the team as a whole to know the exact focus of the discussion.
It would be useful, if the write-up is circulated among the participants at least one day in advance, so that they can concretise their thoughts and reactions to the issues mentioned therein.
Some copies of the write-up should also be kept handy for the desirous persons from the audience.
What to carry for the Interaction Session - Remember to bring along the paper(s) on which you have noted down your points earlier for easy recall, and other things such as transparencies, pictures and so on, that you intend to use in the session.
Some loose sheets/writing pad and pen/pencil should not be forgotten.
Arrangements at the Interaction Session - After you have assembled at the venue at the designated hour, take your seat.
Make sure that the seating arrangement is such that you are able to easily view or rather establish eye contact with your other team members.
Three such seating plans are given in Fig.
16.1.
Fig.
16.1: (a) A seating arrangement for a small group, (b) An arrangement for a larger discussion group, (c) Another arrangement for the discussion group along with audience How to participate effectively in the session - Here are some points, a mix of norms and tips, that would help you to make your interaction session a success and an experience to remember.
The foremost requirement is - a thorough preparation, and clear thinking about the various facets of the proposed topic of discussion.
Once you have occupied your seat, bring yourself to the level of your best concentration and alertness.
Remember to be a patient listener to the points raised, the arguments developed, the explanations made and the data presented during the discussion.
Participate unhesitatingly in the discussion and express your viewpoints freely.
Always seek the permission of the chairperson before speaking.
Try to be perceptive to the sensitivities of people and take the utmost care not to hurt the feelings of any one.
While you speak, your tone should be moderate, firm and audible to all.
Note down any points coming to your mind while the discussion is on, and you can take them up subsequently in the discussion, at the right moments.
Assessment Criteria for the Session - This is a mandatory exercise carrying a weightage often marks (the break-up is given below).
You would be assessed by your counsellor.
The assessment criteria given below would give you an idea of the elements important for a session like this.
Items of assessment Weightage (out of 10) (i) Extent of prior-preparation 1 mark (moderate/extern ive) (ii) Aspects of oral communication skills 4 marks (a) Language clarity (simple and short sentences, familiar words, active verbs) (b) Style, tone and voice quality (friendly, clear, measured neutral tone) (c) Readiness to speak with facts and evidence for developing the argument (d) Alertness in picking up the thread (concentration and presence of mind, quick recall) (iii) How do you carry your self during the session?
3 marks (a) Posture (b) Composure (c) Self-confidence (d) Extent of involvement (e) Capacity to handle differences of opinions (f) Ability to listen (iv) Academic content 2 marks (a) Understanding the topic (b) Accurate knowledge of the relevant facts Participation in the interaction session: is it compulsory?
- As mentioned earlier, you have to participate compulsorily in one of the interaction sessions.
If there are some more of such sessions, we suggest you to attend as many of them as you can, for the purpose of enrichment.
16.3 SOME THEMES FOR DISCUSSION Given below are eight themes, along with some discussion points.
We suggest you to go through all of them quickly and then either choose any one of them or take up a new theme not mentioned here.
These guidelines are just to give you idea about some of the ways of developing a discussion.
16.3.1 Use of Live Animal Material for Experimentation Under this topic a variety of issues can be taken up.
Some of the issues that can be raised are listed below (as Topic 1,2 and 3) along with the guidelines.
Topic 1: Procuring and storing animal materials.
(i) You can begin by asking for a clarification or reaching a common understanding regarding the oft-used terminology, for instance, animal cages, breeder, experiment, Institutional Animals' Use Ethics Committee, and so on.
(ii) The process of acquiring live materials  Prior information required - number of students, the kind of experiment, precise time of requirement, the rightful source for procuring material.
(iii) Receiving and stocking the live materials  Preparation to be made in advance  Examining the actual storage conditions  Thinking and preparing for likely emergencies from past experiences, for instance, coping with extreme ambient temperature conditions  Adequate preparations for stocking live materials causing minimum suffering to them - Animal house, animal cage conforming to the standards, training of the attendant, duration of storage, making arrangements for looking after the animals during off-hours and on holidays.
Topic 2: Conducting experiments on animals.
(i) The qualifications or experience of the person(s) performing experiments on animals, (ii) Comfortable conditions provided, and animals looked after well before and after the experiment, (iii) Use of anaesthetic to prevent suffering to the animal(s), (iv) Relieving an animal from its suffering, (v) Knowledge of the regulatory principles laid down for conducting the experiments on animals, (vi) Keeping records for any checks by the Institutional Animals' Use Ethics Committee.
Topic 3: Ethical issues concerning use of animals for experimentation and educational purposes.
(i) Animals procured, handled and looked after according to the regulatory principles laid down, (ii) Minimising the use of live animal material; trying other alternatives, (iii) Optimum utilisation of a living being, but without causing any kind of suffering to it, (iv) Proper/decent disposal of the dead animals, (v) Are the available regulatory procedures enough?
What more is required in them?
What are the non-relevant portions that could be deleted?
(vi) The regulatory principles alone, are not enough.
These need a back-up of self-discipline and self-check.
16.3.2 Judicious use of Plant/Animal Material for Lab.
Purposes Live or preserved biological material is an essential requirement in all bio-labs.
This material needs to be brought in regularly for immediate use or for replenishment of the stocks.
It is a common sight to see a large portion of the material brought, later being dumped as waste.
Can we think of making a judicious use of the biological material be it of plant origin or animal?
(i) Making the right judgment of the amount of material required for use in the lab.
Just enough, and no shortage Minimal wastage (ii) Dealing with the 'left-overs'  Fixing for future use  Making Herbarium/Museum specimens based on need  Providing it to others who are looking for it.
 Putting to various uses, e.g., flowers can be processed for making dry arrangements/greeting cards during free time.
 Wastes could be buried in a pit for making organic manure, this could reduce the daily garbage load; manure formed could be used in flower pots/gardens.
All this not only adds to the aesthetics of a place, but is also very satisfying.
