7.0 REFERENCES AND OTHER MATERIALS 1.0 INTRODUCTION Before starting any discussion in trigonometric ratios, you should be able to: (i) Identify the sides of a right-angled triangle in relation to a marked angle in the triangle.
If this is not the case do not worry.
You can quickly go through this now: In the diagram see.
Fig.
(i.)
showing a A c B a Fig (i) NOUN 11MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Right-angled triangle ABC, right angled at B, with angle at C marked q and the sides marked a, b, c, AC = b is called the hypothenus AB = c i.e.
the side facing the marked angle q at C is called the opposite side of the angle at C adjacent side to the angle at C. (ii) Again, you should recall that the ratios of two numbers "x and y" can either be expressed as x/ or y/ .
If you have forgotten this, please, refresh your y x memories for this is important in the unit you are about to study.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to • define trigonometric ratios of a given angle.
• State the relationship between the trigonometric ratios • Locate the quadrant of the trigonometric ratios of given angles • Find the basic angles of given angles.
3.1.l.
TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS Having refreshed your minds on the sides of a right-angled triangle and the concept of ratios you are now ready to study the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine and tangent).
This has to do with the ratio of the sides of a right-angled triangle.
Here is an example.
a In ∆ABC, with A < B = 90° and < C = q and the sides of ∆ABC, NOUN 12MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY AB c = marked a, b, c, respectively, then AC - b = opposite side to the angle at C is sine q or simply sin q .
Hypotenuse In ∆ABC see Fig 8 1.12 A b c Ө C B a A fig: 1.12 = adjacent side to the angle C is called Cosine q or simply Cos q and in fig: 1.13 Hypotenuse Below AB c ------ = A BC a fig: 1.13 = Opposite side, to the angle C is called tangent q or tan q from the above ratios, NOUN 13MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Adjacent side to the angle C you can see that sin q opposite side ÷ adjacent side = cosq hypothenus hypothenus using the notation of the sides of ∆ABC sin q c a = cosq b ÷ b c opposite side = a adjacent side tan = q In the above, at an acute angle and with the knowledge that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180o.
What do you think will happen to the trigonometric rations?
This takes us to the relationships between trigonometric ratios.
3.1.2.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS.
B Fig: 1.14 In ∆ABC in fig 1.14 with the usual notations < B = 900 and < C = q , therefore < A = 90 - q .
Once more finding the trigonometric ratios in relation to the angle at A.
Sin (90o – q ) = BC = a = opposite side to angle A AC b hypothenus = COs q Sin (90o – q ) = AB = c = opposite side to angle A AC b hypothenus = Sin q You might happen wonder what happens to tan (900-0), this will be discussed later.
In summary, given ∆ABC as shown Sin q = Cos (900 - q ) NOUN 14MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Cos q = sin (90° -q ) and Sin q = tan q Cosq The conclusion from the summary of these trigonometric ratios is that the sine of an acute angle equals the cosine of its complement and vice versa.
Thus sin 300 = cos 600, cos 50° = sin 400 etc.
(these angles are called complementary angles because their sum is 90o 1 .e.
30° + 60° = 90°, 50° + 40 = 90oetc) Now go through the examples above carefully and try this exercise.
(1) Find the value of q in the following (i) cos q ° = sin q (ii) sin 35° = cos q (iii) sin 12° = Cos q (iv) cos 73° = Sin q .
In case you are finding it difficult, the following are the solutions.
Solutions: (i) Cos 50° = sin (90° - q ) =sin (90° -50°) = sin 40° (because 50° + 40° = 90°) (ii) Sin 35° = cos (90° - 35°) = Cos 55° ( since 35° + 55° = 90°) (iii) Sin 12° = Cos (90° - 12°) = Cos 78° (iv) Cos 73° = Sin (90° - 73°) (2) Find the trigonometric ratios in their following triangle B Solution: Since there is the measurement of a side missing i.e.
AC, and the triangle is right - angled ∆, Using Pythagoras theorem to find the missing side BC2 = AB2 + AC2 (Pythagoras theorem) Substituting for the sides 52 = 42 + AC2 25 = 16 + AC2 25 - 16 = AC2 9 =AC2 NOUN 15MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY \ AC = (cid:214) 9=3, then since.
sin q = AB = 4 = 0.8 BC 5 cosq = AC = 3 = 0.6 BC 5 tan q = AB = 4 =1.33° AC 3 (3) In the following, angle q is acute and angle α is acute.
Find the following trigonometric ratios.
8 15 (a) sin α (b) cos α (c) tan α (d) cos q (e) sin q (f) tan q Solutions: (a) sin α = BC = 15 AC 17 (b) cos α = AB = 8 AC 17 (c) tan α = BC = 15 AB 8 (d) cos q = BC = 15 AC 17 (e) sin q = AB = 8 AC 17 (f) tang = AB = 8 BC 15 You can notice from example (3) that since the sum α and q is 90° (i.e.
α + q 90°)that: Sin α = Cos q and Cos α = Sin q .
This again shows that α and q are complementary angles.
NOUN 16MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Having known what trigonometric ratios are, you will now proceed to finding trigonometric ratios of any angle.
3.3 TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS OF ANY ANGLE.
It is possible to determine to some extent the trigonometric ratios of all angles using the acute angles in relation to the right-angled triangle.
But since all problems concerning triangles are not only meant for right angle triangles, ~it is then good to extend the concept of the trigonometric ratios to angles of any size (i.e.
between 0° and any angle).
To achieve the above, you take a unit circle i.e.
a circle of radius I unit, drawn Fig: 2.0 In the Cartesian plane (x and y plane) the circle is divided into four equal parts each of which is called a quadrant (1st, 2nd, 3rd.
4th respectively).
Angles are either measured positively in an anti clockwise direction (see fig 2.1) Positive NOUN 17MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig: 2.1 Or negatively in a clockwise direction.
Fig: 2.2 Example.
In the diagrams below Positive +70 ° = - 290° + 10° = -350 Note: Since this concerns angles at a point their sum is 360°.
But angles of sizes greater than 360° will always lie in any of the four quadrants.
This is determined by NOUN 18MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY first trying to find out how many revolutions (one completed revolution = 360°) there are contained in that angle.
For example, (b) 390° contains 1(360°) plus 30° i.e.
390° = 360° + 300, 30° is called the basic angle of 390° and since 30° is in the first quadrant, 390° is also in the first quadrant.
(a) 600° = 360° + 240°, since 240° is in the third quadrant, 600° is also in the third quadrant.
To find the basic angle of any given angle subtract 360° (1 complete revolution) from the given angle until the remainder is an angle less than 360° , then locate the quadrant in which the remainder falls that becomes the quadrant of the angle.
Now have fun with this exercise, Exercise: Find the basic angles of the following and hence indicate the quadrants in which they fell.
(1) 670° (2) 740° (3) 1998° (4) 2002° (5) 2106° (6) 544° Are you happy, Now, move to the next step.
To determine the signs whether positive or negative of the angles and their trigonometric ratios in the four quadrants; First, choose any point P(x, y) on the circle and O is the center of the circle.
Fig: 2.3 q P = r, is the radius and OP makes an angle of α with the positive x - axis.
Since P is any point, OP is rotated about 0 in the anti clockwise direction, Hence in the 1st quadrant (0° < q < 90° ), using your knowledge of trigonometric ratios.
NOUN 19MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Sin α = PA = +y = y/r is positive q P +r cos α = q A = +x = x/r is also positive q P +r tan α = q P = +y = y/x is also positive q A +x Therefore in first quadrant (acute angles) all the trigonometric ratios are positive.
2nd quadrant (90 < α ° < 180°) (obtuse angles) Fig: 2.4 In ∆PBO , < at O is 180 - α, here BO is - x (it lies on the negative x axis) but y and r are positive.
The trigonometric ratios are Sin (180 -α) = PB = +y = y/r is positive PO +r Cos (180 -α) = BO = -x = -x/r is negative PO +r Tan (180 - α) = PB = + y = -y/x is negative BO -r So, only the sine of the obtuse angle is positive, the other trigonometric ratios are negative.
Guess what happens in the 3rd quadrant (reflex angles).
3rd quadrant 180 < α° < 270° (reflex angles) NOUN 20MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Note q P = r (i.e.)
the radius is always positive.
Reference is made to 180°, so the angle is (180 + α)° or α - 180° Fig: 2.5 Sin(α -180°) –y/+r = - y/r which is negative Cos(α -180°) = -x/r = - x/r is negative tan(α -180°) - - y/-x is positive so if the angle α lies between 180° and 270° the sine, cosine o9f that angle are negative while the tangent is positive.
4th quadrant 270° <α< 360° (Double Reflex angles) y NOUN 21MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig 2.6 Here PA is negative but OA and OP are positive.
Sin (360 – α) = - y/+r = -y/r is negative Cos (360 – α) +x/+r = x/r is positive Tan (360 - α) = -y/+x = -- y/x is negative.
Here again sine and tangent of any angle that lies between 270° and 360° are negative the cosine of that angle is positive.
Looking at the figures above, it is seen that the sign of a cosine is similar to the sign of the x - axis( and coordinate) while the sign of a sine is similar to the sign of y - coordinate (i.e.
y - axis).
The signs can then be written in the four quadrants as shown below see fig: 2.7 NOUN 22MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig 2.7 Fig 2.8.
Figure 2.8 is a summary of the signs in their respective quadrants, thus going in the anticlockwise direction, the acronym is; (1) CASt(from the 4th to 1st to 2nd and then 3rd) (ii) ACTS (from 1st 4th 3rd then 2nd ) Clockwise (iii) All Science Teachers Cooperate (ASTC) (from the 1st 2nd --> 3rd -> 4th ).
The letters in figure 2,8 (marked quadrants) show the trigonometric ratios that are positive.
(iv) SACT (2nd -> 1 st -> 4th -> 3rd ) (v) TASC (3rd --> 2nd -> 1 st -> 4th) NOUN 23MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Example: Indicate the quadrants of the following angles and state whether their trigonometric ratios of each is positive or negative.
(1) 155° (11) 525° (iii) 62° (iv) 310° (v) 233° Solution: (1) 155° lies between 90° and 180° and therefore is in the 2nd quadrant.
The sine of 155° is positive while the cosine and tangent, of 155° are negative.
Thus: sin 155° is + ve but cos 155° and tan 155° are negative using the tabular form No Angles Quadrant Positive trig, Negative trig.
ratios ratios 1 155o 2nd sin cos and tan 2nd sin cos and tan 525" =360" +165° the 2 basic angle is 165° 3 62o Ist sin, cos and tan none 4 310o 4th cos sin, and tan 5 233o 3rd tan sin and cos Alternatively, the solution can be thus 1.
155° is in the 2nd quadrant, here only the sin and cosec are positive.
sin(1550) = +sin (180 - 155°) =sin 25° cos 155° = - cos (180 - 155°) = - cos 25° tan 155° = - tan (180 - 155) = - tan 25° 2.
525°; the basic angle of 525° is gotten by 525° = 360° + 160° (one complete revolution plus 165°) .'.
525 = 165 the basic angle lies in the 2nd quadrant and so 525 is in the 2nd quadrant where only the sin is positive sin 525° = sin 165° = sin (180 - 165) = sin 15° cos 525° = - cos (180-165) - cos 15° tan 525° = - tan(180 - 165) = - tan 15° NOUN 24MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 3.
62°, this is in the first quadrant, where all the trig.
Ratios are positive, therefore sin 62° = + sin 62°; cos 62° = + cos 62° ; tan 62° = + tan 62°; 4.
310° is in the 4th quadrant where only the cosine is positive, thence.
sin 3100 = - sin (360 - 310) = - sin 50° cos 310° = + cos (360 - 310) = + cos 50° tan 310° = - tan (360 -310) = - tan 50° 5.
233° is in the 3rd quadrant, only tan is positive, so: sin 233° = - sin (233 - 180°) = - sin 53° cos 233° = -cos (233 - 180°) = - cos 53° tan 233° = + tan (233 - 180°) = + tan 53° Exercise 2.1 Show in which of the quadrant each of the following angles occur and state whether the trigonometric ratio of the angle is positive or negative.

You should have also learnt that the value of any angle depended on its basic angle and its sign depends on the quadrant in which it is found.
Thou now understand that the most commonly used trigonometric ratios are the sine , cosine and tangent; and the basic angle q lies between O° and 360° i.e.
O° <_q <_ 360° 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have seen that the trigonometric ratios with respect to a right- angled triangle is Sin q = opposite i.e.

You also saw the relationship between the sine and cosine of any angle, nothing was mentioned about the relationship of the tangent except that it is the sine of an angle over its cosine.
Also in our discussion, form our definition of ratios only one aspect is treated i.e.
Xy or x : y what happens when it is y : x .
An attempt to answer this question will take us to the unit on the reciprocals of trigonometric ratios - secant, cosecant and cotangent.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define the reciprocals of trigonometric ratios in relation to the right- angled triangle.
• Establish the relationship between the six trigonometric ratios • Use trigonometric tables to find values of given angles.
3.1 TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS II From the previous units, using DABC, right-angled and B and with the usual notations fig.
2.1 (a) the knowledge of the ratio NOUN 29MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY a Fig.
2.1 Of two numbers "x and y" expressed as x/y was used to find the sine, cosine and tangent of q .
In this unit, the expressed as y/x will be used thus in fig 2.1 (a) Sin q = AB = c AC b Cos q = BC = a and AC b Tan q = AB = c BC a.
Now if this relationship is viewed in this order.
C a Fig: 2.1 (b) AC = hypothenus = b it is called cosecants or cosecs AB opposite c AC = a = adjacent BC c Opposite is called cotangent opposite of q or cot q .
Now study the above ratios carefully, what can you say of their relationship?
This leads us to the following sub-heading RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS.
As you can see sin 6 and cosc 6 for example are related in the sense that Sin q = opposite = c from fig: 2.1(a) hypothenus b and cosecq = hypothenus = b from fig: 2.1(b) opposite c NOUN 30MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY which means that cosecq = 1 Opposite hypothenus = hypothenus opposite = b c This then means that cosec q is the reciprocal of sin q and sin q is the reciprocal of cosec q .
From the above ratios also, you can see ; Exercise l: (i) find the other reciprocals.
Now try this.
the above example serves as a guide.
(ii) verify that cos q / sin q = cot q for any triangle.
Is this surprising.
This is the beauty of the trigonometric ratios Note from the sum of angles of a triangle giving 180°, the following relations can be proved.
a Fig; 2.22 You should recall that in unit 1, Sin (90o - q ) = cos q and Cos (90° - q ) = sin q now let us, see the tangent.
Tan (90° -q ) = BC/AC in fig: 2.2 i.e.
= a/c = cot q Also sec (900 – q ) = cosec q .
This brings us to the conclusion that the tangent of an acute ngle is equal to the cotangent of its complement.
I.e.
cot 30° = tan 60° and tan 10° = cot 80°; also sec 10° = cosec 80 ° NOUN 31MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Now go through these examples 1.
Find the value of 0 in the following (a) sec q = cosec 30° (b) sin 50 = ?
(c) cot 20° = tan q (d) sec 40° = cosec q Solution: (a) cosec 30° = sec (90 - q ) cosec 30° = sec (90 - 30°) = sec 60° (b) 1/sin 50° = cosec 50° (c) cot 20° = tan (90° - q ) =tan (90° - 20°) = tan 70° (d) sec 40° = cosec (90 - q ) = cosec(90 - 40°) = cosec 50° 2.
In the diagram, on the right find the folloiwing: (a) sec q (b) cosecq (c) cot q 15 (a) sec q = hypothenus = 1 = 17 adjacent cosq 15 (b) cosec q = 1 = hyhothenus = 17 sinq opposite 15 (C) cot q = 1 = adjacent = 15 tanq opposite 8 Now move to the next step, the relationship between trigonometric ratios of other angles.
It has been established that: NOUN 32MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (1) the secant of any angle is the reciprocal of the cosine of the angle i.e.
sec q = 1/cos q (2) cosec q = 1/sin q and (3) cotan q = 1/tan q It then means that whatever applies to the trigonometric ratios their reciprocals, so the following are true in the first quadrant i.e.
; O ° < q < 90° (acute) all the reciprocals trigonometric ratios are positive.
Sec q -> cosec q and cotan q In the second quadrant 90 q < < 180 (obtuse) since only the sine is positive only its reciprocal the cosecant will also be positive in the third and fourth quadrants respectively only the tangent and cotangent for 180 < q < 270 are positive and cosine and secant in 270 < 0 < 360 are positive respectively.
So the following relationships are established 1. sec q = cosec (90° - q ) cosec q = sec (90° - q ) tan q = cot (90° - q ) cot q = tan (90° - q ) 2. sec (180 - q ) is negative, q lies between 90° and 180° cosec (180 - q ) is positive cot (180 -q ) is negative.
3. sec (q - 180) is negative, q lies between 180° and 270° cosec (q - 180) is negative cot (q - 180) is positive 4. sec (360° - q ) is positive, q lies between 270° and 360 ° cosec (360 -q ) is negative cotan (360 - q ) is negative having seen the relationships between the trigonometric ratios and their reciprocals, let us move on to find angles using the trigonometric tables.
3.2.1 USE OF TRIGONOMETRIC TABLES In the trigonometric tables for sine, cosine and tangent of angles can be used to find the values of their reciprocals.
In the four figure tables available only the tables for sine, cosine and tangent are available so whatever obtains in their case also applies to their reciprocals.
NOUN 33MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY The exact values of the trigonometric ratios obtained using the unit circle may not be accurate due to measurement errors.
So to obtain the exact values of the trigonometric ratios, you use the four figure tables or calculators.
The tables to be used here are extract of the Natural sine and cosine of selected angles between 100 and 890 at the interval of 61 or 0.10 .

Example: Find the value of the following angles: (i) sin 20 .
60 (ii) cos 300 121 (iii) sin 700 481 (iv) cos 40.
70 Solutions: (I) From the sine table to find sin 20 .
60 look at the left hand column marked x get to the number 20 and move across to 0.
6 on the top now their intense gives 0.3518 .'.
sin 20.60 =0.3518 (II) For cos (300 121), go to the natural cosine table look for 300 along the first column (x0) , either and move across unit 1 you fet to 121.
The value at this intersection is 0.8643.
\ cos (300 121) = 0.8643.
(III) Sin (700 481) = 0.9444 (iv) Cos (40 .
70) = 0.7581 A times, there might have problems involving minutes or degrees other than the one given in the table.
You have to use the difference table when such is the case.
for example Find (1) sin (200.
151) (II) cos (500 171) Solutions: (i) From the sine table (WAEC) sin (20 12) = 0.3453 plus the difference for 3 = 8 (from the difference column at the extreme right of the sine table) \ sin (20 151 ) = 0.3461 Alternatively you can look for sin (20° 181) and then subtract the difference of 31 thus Sin (20° 181) = 0.3469 Is the difference for 31 = -8 NOUN 35MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Sin (200 151) 0.3461 You see that either way the value of sin (20° 151) is 0.
3461 Note that the values of then (20° 151)is the same in the two methods above but in most cases, the values are not there are slight differences at times.
(ii) From the cosine table cos (50° 171) is nearer cos 50 18 cos (50° 18) = 0.
6388 plus the diff.
Forte= +2 0.6390 \ cos (500 171) = 0.6390 OR cos (50° 121) = 0.
6401 minus the diff.
For 51 = -12 cos (50° 171) = 0.
6389 Observe that the difference was added to the first method is cos 50° 181 and subtracted from the second method i.e.
cos 50° 121 .
This is because the angle increases, the value reduces in cosine.
You can have a critical look at the tables for cosine.
It is good to note that the values of sine increases form O to 1 while the values of cosine decreases from 1 to O.
The same methods as used in finding the tangent of angles from their tangents tables.
For angles greater than 90°, the same tables are used in finding their trigonometric ratios but firstly, you de4termine the quadrant and sign of the angle and treat accordingly.
Examples: Find (1) sin 120° (2) sin ( - 30)° (3) cos ( - 10° ) (4) cos 260° Solutions: (1) Sin 120° is in the second quadrant and sine is positive = sin (180 - 1200 = sin 60° and since sin 60 is positive, from the sine table.
Sin 120° = + sin 60° = 0.8660 (2) Sin (-30°) is in the fourth quadrant, where the sine is negative.
NOUN 36MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY \ ( - 30°) = - sine (360 - 30) = - sin 330° = - sin 30° from the sine table sin 30° = 0.5000 \ - sin 300 _ - 0.5000 (3) Cos (- 10) lies in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive.
\ cos ( -10) = cos (360 - 10)= cos 350° = cos 10° \ cos ( -10) the cosine table is 0.9848 \ cos (- 10) = 0.9848 (4) Cos (260°) is in the 3rd quadrant where cosine is negative = cos (260 - 180°) = cos 80°.
From the cosine table cos 80 = 0.1736 and since cosine is negative in the 3rd quadrant cos 2600 = - cos 800 = - 0.1736 3.3.2 USE OF LOGARITHMS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS A times you might be faced with problems which require multiplication and direction in solving triangles.
Here the use of tables of trigonometric functions becomes time consuming and energy sapping.
It is best at this stage to use the tables of the logarithms of trigonometric functions directly.
Examples: Find (1) log cos 20° 61.
Solution: The use of the tables of cosine will allow you to (1) find cos 20° 61 from the table .
(ii) find this value from the common logarithm table i.e.
cos .
(20° 61.)
= 0.9391 (from Natural cosine) Then log 0.9391 =ī.9727 (from common logarithm) But using the logarithm table of cosine go straight and find log 20° 61.
\ log cos (20° 61) = ī .
9727 Here you can see that applying the log cos table is easier and faster.
(ii) Log sin (24° 131 ) Log sin (24° 131 ) = ī.
6127, Plus difference for 11 = + 0.0002 (cot from the difference table at the right hand extreme column) \ log sin 24° 131 = ī .
6029 (iii) log tan 40° 171 from the log tangent table; NOUN 37MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY log tan 40° 171= ī.
9269 plus the diff.
For 51 = + 8 log tan 40° 171= ī.
9277 Alternatively, you can look for the logarithm: log tan 40° 181 = ī .
9 284 minus the deff.
for 11 = - 2 log tan 40° 181 = ī.
9282 The two results in this case are not the same.
The second result is preferable because the smaller the difference the more accurate the value of the angle being sort for.
If the angles are in radius convert to degrees.

4.0 CONCLUSION In unit 1 and 2, you have learnt, the definition of the trigonometric ratios and their reciprocals, and how to find the trigonometric ratios of any given angle and the use of trigonometric tables in finding angles.
You should hive also learnt that the value of any angle depends on the basic angle and its sign depends on the quadrant in which it is found.
However, you need be aware that the most commonly used trigonometric ratios are the sine cosine and tangent and the basic angle 0 lies between O° and 360 i.e.
0 < 0 < 360.

1.0 INTRODUCTION Very often you see relations like y = sin q R is possible to find the value of y, if q is known.
On the other hand the need might arise to find the value of q when y is known.
What do you think can be done in this case?
In the example above i.e.
y = sin q , sine is a function of an angle and also the angle is a function of sine.
In this unit, you shall learn the inverse trigonometric functions, sometimes called circular functions, the basic relation of the principal value and trigonometric ratios of special angles 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 900 , 180°, 270° and 3600 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of the units you should be able to: - define inverse trigonometric functions - find accurately the inverse trigonometric functions of given values.
- Determine without tables or calculators the trigonometric ratios of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°, 270 ° and 360°.
- Solve problems involving inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric ratios of special angles correctly.
3.1 INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS (CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS) 3.1.1.
DEFINITION AND NOTATION The trigonometric ratios of angle are usually expressed as y = sin q (where y and q represents any value and angle respectively).
Or y = cos q NOUN 42MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Or y = tan q .
The above are example when the values of q is known.
When the value of q is unknown and y is known the above relations can be expressed as: q = (Sin-1 y) written as arc sin y read as ark sin y or q = (Cos-1 y), written as arc cosy read as ark cos y or 0 = (Tan-1 y) written as arc tan y read as arktany Note capital letters are used for the first letters of the trig.
ratios.
These relations arcsin, arccos and arctan are called the inverse trigonometric functions or circular functions.
Thus, in the above examples, 0 is called the inverse sine or inverse cosine or inverse tangent of y.
Example: (a) if sin q = 0.4576, then q = sin-1(o.4576), meaning that q is the angle whose sine is 0.4576 or the sine of q is 0.4576 (b) if cos q = 0.8594,at then q = cos-1(0.8954), which implies that q is the angle whose cosine is 0.8594 or cosine of q = 0.8954.
(c) if tan q = 2.
1203, then tan-1 (2.
1203) shows that q is the angle whose tangent is 2.1203 or the tangent of q is 2.1203.
PROCEDURES FOR FINDING INVERSE TRIGONOMETREIC FUNCTIONS Having been conversant with the use of the trigonometric tables, the task here becomes easy.
In finding the inverse trigonometric ratio of any angle, first look for the given value on the body of the stated trigonometric table and, read off the angle and minute under which it appeared.
If the exact value is not found, the method of interpolation(i.e.
finding the value closest to it and finding the difference between this closest value and the original value, then, look for the difference under the minutes in the difference column) can be adopted.
Example 1 Find the value of the following angles (a) sin-1 (0.1780) (b) cos-1 (0.2588) (c) tan-1 (1.1777) NOUN 43MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY this question can also be stated thus: Find y if; (a) siny = 0.1780 (b) cosy= 0.2588 (C) tan y = 1.1777 Solutions: 1(a) From the sine table (Natural sine table) through the body the value 0.1780 (or a value close to it) is located.
The value is 0.1771 found under 10° 12'.
The difference between 0.1780 and 0.17711 is 9.
This is found under 3 in the difference column.
So in tabular form .. 0.1771 = 10° 121 plus difference fog -9 = + 31 0.1780 = 100 15' \ the angle whose sine is 0.1780 is 10° 151 Alternatively 0.1788 can be located under 10 18 and difference between 0.1788 and 0.1780 is 8 but 8 cannot be found in the difference column so choose the number nearest to 8 i.e.
9 found under 31 \ 0.1788= 10° 181 plus difference for 9 = + 3 1 0.1779 = 10° 151 .'.
the angle whose sine is approximately equal to 0.1780 (0.1779) i.e 10° 151 q = 10° 151 b) Cos q = 0.2588 from the cosine table, the value 0.2588 is found under 75° 01 the angle whose cosine is 0.2588 is 75° .. q = 75° c) tan q =1.
1777, from the natural tangent table the value closest to 1.1777 is 1.1750 found under 49° 361 .
The difference between the two values is 27 which is found under 41 .. 0.1750 = 49° 361 plus the difference for 27 = + 41 0.1777 = 49° 401 In the above examples all angles are acute angles.
The inverse trigonometric functions can be extended to any angle.
3.1.2 INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF ANY ANGLE.
NOUN 44MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY The inverse trigonometric functions here are extended to include values of given angles between 0° and 360° and beyond Example 2: Find the value of 0 between 0° and 360° in the following: (a) sin q = 0.8964 (b) cos q = - 0.6792 (c) tan q = 0.2886 Solutions: (a) sin q = 0.8964 =:> q = sin-'(0.8964) .'.
q = 63° 411 ; Since sin q is positive then the angle must either be in the 1st or 2nd quadrant thus Fig 3.10 In the first quadrant q = 63o 411 and in the 2nd quadrant q = 180 – 63o 411 = 116o 191.
(b) Cos q = 0.6792 From the cosine tables q = cos -1 0.6792 = 47o 101 but cosine q is negative, therefore q lies either in the 2nd or 3rd quadrant.

Fig : 3.12 In the 2nd quadrant q = 180 - 16° 61= 1630 541 in the 4th quadrant q = 360 - 16° 61 q = 343° 541 Note from the previous units there are several values of q with the same value but in different quadrants.
For example sin 30° = sin 150° = sin 390° = sin 750° etc, hence the inverse trigonometric functions are many valued NOUN 46MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY expressions.
This mean that one value of q is related to an infinite number of values of the function.
Hence to obtain all possible angles q of a given trigonometric ratio either add or subtract (360° K ) where K is any integer- positive, negative or zero Example 3 Find all possible angles of 0 in example 2(a), (b) and (c) above.

Hence to find all possible angles of given angle: (1) find the basic angles of the given value (ii) add or subtract (360k°) where k is either a positive negative or zero integer.
3.1.3 PRINCIPAL VALUES OF INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS.
In this section, attention should be found on the value which lies in a specified range for example: (i) for sin-' y, the range of values are -p /2 (-90°) to p /2 (-90°).
This value is called the principal value of the inverse of sine denoted by sin-ly (smalls).
For example if sin -1 1/(cid:214) 2 = 45° or p /4 radians then the principal value of the inverse of sin 1/(cid:214) 2 is sin-1 1/(cid:214) 2 = 45° or p /4 (since it is within the range).
NOUN 47MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (ii) If y = cos q , then q = cos-1 y, is the inverse cosine of y. and the principal value of the inverse of cosine is the value of q in the range 0° to p (180°).
This is the same for arc cot q , and arc sec q Example, if cos-1 1/(cid:214) 2= 45°, then arc sec q the principal value Cos-1(- 1/(cid:214) 2) = -p /4(-45°) the principal value is cos-1/(cid:214) 2) = -p /4(135°) (iii) The principal value of the inverse of tangent is the value of q in the range -p /2 (- 90°) to +p /2 (- 90°).
This is the same for arc cosec q .
Example of principal values The principal value of; (a) Tan-1(-1) = -p /4 = (45°).
(b) Cot-1(cid:214) 3= p /6 (30°) (c) Sec-1(-2) = 2/3p (120°) The relationship between the values of an inverse function and its principal value is given by the formulae below (Vygodsky 1972: 366).
(i) Arc sin x = k p + (-1)k arc sin x (ii) Arc cos x = 2kp ± arc cos x (iii) Arc tan x = kp + arc tan x (iv) Arc cot x = kp + arc cot x, where k is any integer positive, negative or zero.
Hence Arc sin, Arc cos, Arc tan denotes arbitary values of inverse trigonometric functions and arcsin, arcos, arctan denotes principal values of given angles.
Example: (a) Arc sin½ = kp + (-1)k arc sin ½ = kp + (-1)k x p /6 or k(180°) + (-1) k 30° fork= 0, Arcsin ½ = 0 x p + (-1)° p /6 = p /6(30)° k=1, = Arcsin 1/2 = l x p + (-I)' p /6 = p - p /6 = 5p /6 (150°) k=2, = Arcsin 1/2 = 2 x p + (-I)2 p /6 = 2p + p /6 = 13p /66 (390°) k=3, = Arcsin 1/2 = 3 x p + (-I)3 p /6 = p 3+ p /6 = 17p /6 (510°) k=-1, = Arcsin 1/2 = -1 x p + (-I)-' p /6 = - p - p /6 = -7p /6 (-210°) Note the angles in radians can be converted to degrees (see angles in brackets) Exercise 3.1 NOUN 48MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (1) write down the values of (a) sin-'(- 1/2) (b) cos-'(-1) (c) tan-'(-1) Ans: (a)-211110°, 330° (b) 180° (c) 135°, 315° (2) Use tables to evaluate: (a) tan-' 2 (b) cos-1 (1/4) (c) sin-' (3/5) Ans: (a) 63° 26' (b) 88° 26' (c) 36° 26' (3) Find the value of the following angles: (a) sin-1(0.7509) (b) cos-1 (0.9219) (c) tan-' (2.574) Ans: (a) 48° 40' (b) 212° 48' (c) 68° 46' 4.

3.2 TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS OF COMMON ANGLES The angles 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° are called common angles because they are frequently used in mathematics and mechanics in physics.
Although the trigonometric ratios of common angles 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, (and multiples of 90° up to 360° ) can be found from the trigonometric tables, they can be easily determined and are widely used in trigonometric problems.
3.2.l.
THE ANGLE OF 30° AND 60° Consider an equilateral triangle ABC of sides 2cm.
An altitude AD (see fig; 3.2) A NOUN 49MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig: 3.2 An altitude AD (see fig 3.2) Bisects < BAC so that < BAD = < CAD = 30° < ABC = < ACB = 60° by Pythagoras theorem AD = (cid:214) 3 units.
Hence, the value of the trigonometric ratios of 60° and 30° are Sin 60°= (cid:214) 3/2 and sin 30° = 1/2 Cos 60° = 1/2 and cos 30° = (cid:214) 3/2 Tan 60° =(cid:214) 3 and tan 30° = I(cid:214) 3 Cot 60° = 1/(cid:214) 3 and cot 30° (cid:214) 3 Sec 60° = 2 and see 30o =-2/(cid:214) 3 Cosec 60° = 2/(cid:214) 3 and cosec 30° = 2 3.2.2.
THE ANGLE 45° Consider a right-angled isosceles triangle ABC with AB= BC = 1 unit, <B=90° and<A=<C=45° AC = (cid:214) 2 units (Pythagoras theorem) NOUN 50MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig 3.21 Hence the trigonometric ratios of 45° are sin 45° = 1(cid:214) 2 Cos 45° = 1/(cid:214) 2 Tan 45° = 1 Cot 45' = 1 Sec 45°=(cid:214) 2 Cosec 45° = (cid:214) 2 3.2.3.
ANGLES 0° AND 90° It is difficult in practical problems to find angles 0° and 90° in a right - angled triangle as acute angles but with extended trigonometric functions, these angles are considered.
(see fig 3.22 below) Using a unit circle let P (x, y) be any point on the circle.
If q P, is rotated 1 about 0 in the anti clockwise direction through an acute angle q , then q A is the projection of q P, on the X - axis and q B is the projection of q P, on the Y- axis NOUN 51MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY In ∆Pq A I Sin q = P A but P 0 = 1 unit (unit radius) 1 1 P 0 1 \ Sin q = P A = y coordinate of P 1 1 = projection of OP, on the Y-axis cosq = OA = OA= OA but OA = BP 1 OP 1 1 .. cos q = BP = x coordinate of P 1 1 = projection of 0 P on the X-axis 1 Thus if P is any point on a circle with center 0 and unit radius and OP makes an angle with the X-axis, then the sine and cosine of any angle may be defined thus: Sin q = y coordinate or the projection of OP on the y-axis and cos q , x coordinate or the projection of OP on the x-axis Thus for angles 0° and 90° Sin 90° = y coordinate = 1 cos 90° = x coordinate = 0 (90° has no projection on the x axis) tan 90° = sin 90 0 = 1 = α (infinity) cos900 0 Fig: 3.2.3 Similarly for 0° Sin 0° = y coordinate = 0(0° has no projection on y-aixs) cos 0° = x coordinate NOUN 52MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY = 1 (0° lies on the x-axis tan 0° = sin 0 0 = 0 cos0° 1 = 0 Alternatively; In a right-angled triangle ABC, with < A = 90° and < C = q which is very small Fig: 3.2.4.
The ratios of q are: Sin q = AB BC Cosq = AC BC tan q = AB AC also sin β = AC BC tan β = AC AB When q gets smaller and smaller, R becomes larger and larger, these are expressed thus as q tends to O i.e.
q ---- 0 β tends to 90° i.e.

Graph of y = sin q (by projection) 3.1.
GRAPHS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS In drawing the graphs of trigonometric ratios, abscissa (x-axis) is taken as the independent variable and the ordinate (y-axis) as the dependent variable.
This is so because the values of arc dependent on the values of x.
The following explains this 3.1.
GRAPH OF y = sin q The graph of y = sin 0 will show the relationship between 0 and sin 0.
This graph can be drawn in two possible ways.
Method 1: from table values Steps: (a) assign different values to 0° at intervals of 30° to 360 ° i.e.
0 = 0°, 30°, 60°, 90° ...,360° (b) find the corresponding values of sin 0 , this is used to from the table of values (c) choose a suitable scale then plot the values (d) join the plotted points with either the free hand or a broom stick to get a smooth curve.
This curve is then the graph of y = sin q .
Thus following the steps, the table of values approximated to 2 decimal places is.

Let 4cm represent 1 unit on the sin q axis i.e.
the vertical or y-axis.
The points arte then plotted on a graph sheet and is joined by a broom stick (see over leaf graph of y = sin q This means that the length from the height point on the graph to the x-axis is 1.
Method 2: Projection Steps: (a) Construct a unit circle and mark out correctly the angles of q = 0°, 30°, 60°, ... to 360° (see fig 4.2).
(b) Draw the x and y axis as in other graphs (c) Draw a horizontal line through the center of the circle to meet the x- axis.
(d) On the x-axis at 30o interval, mark out the angles 0o, 30°, 60°, .. to 360°.
(e) Draw dotted horizontal lines from the angles of sectors marked on the unit circle to meet the vertical lines from their corresponding values at the x-axis at a point.
(f) Join these points, then the graph of y = sin q is obtained see fig 4.2.
Properties of the graph of y = sin q 1.
The graph of y = sin q or the sine curve is a continuous function i.e.
it has no gaps between the values => no break 2.
The value of sin q increases from q at 0° to that 90° and then decreases to - 1 at 270 and back to 0° at 360°.
3.
The sine curve repeats itself at intervals of 360° [or comes to coincidence with itself upon a translation along the axis of abscissa(x- axis)by some amount].
It is called a period (or cycle) of the function.
In this or cycle is 360°.
4.
The height of the graph P D (amplitude) in the sine curve is l. NOUN 62MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 3.1.2 GRAPH OF y = cos q for 0 < q < 3600 The graph of y = cos q is similar to the sine curve i.e.
graph of y = sin q .
Here again the table of values for q and cos q is shown below at the intervals of 300 Table 2: Table of Values for y = cos q 0 q 0o 30o 60o 90o 120o 150° 180o 210o 240o 270o 300o 330o 360o Cos q 1 0.87 0.5 0 -0.5 -0.87 -1 -0.87 -0.5 0 0.5 0.87 1 These points are plotted as in the sine curve and joined to give the cosine curve thus cos q Fig 4.3Graph of y = cos q Method 2: Projection A The graph of cos q may be drawn in a similar way to that of sine.
In this case the values of cos q = sin (90 - q ).
The universally used method of plotting graph is the method by the use of table of values.
So the cosine curve will not be shown by the projection method here properties of the cosine curve.
NOUN 63MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 1.
The cosine curve is continuous 2.
The minimum value is continuous the minimum values i.e.
- 1.
So like the sine curve, it lies between -1 and 1.
3.
The graph repeats itself at the interval of 360° and the function is also called a periodic function with periodical 360° 4.
The length of graph of y = cos q (amplitude) is 1.
Note the curves of the sine and cosines are identical because they have the same wavelength.
The differences are that: (1) The sine curve goes from 0 to 1 while the cosine curve goes from 1 to 0 and (2) Since cosq = sin (90 - q ), the difference between the curves is 90° 3.1.3 THE GRAPH OF y = tan q The graph of y = tan 0 is treated as in the case of the sine and cosine curves thus the table of values is shown in tables 3 Table 3: Table of values for y = tan 0, 00 <_ 0<_ 360° q 0o 30o 60o 90o 120o 150° 180o 210o 240o 270o 300o 330o 360o Tan q 0 0.58 1.73 α -1.73 -0.58 0 0.58 1.73 α -1.73 -0.58 0 Scale: Chose suitable scales: here the scales chosen are: 1 cm for I unit at the q -axis (x-axis) 2cm for 1 unit at the tan q axis (y-axis) the graph of y = tan q is shown in fig 4.3 below.
NOUN 64MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Properties of the graph of y = tan q 1.
The tangent curve is discontinues because tan q is not defined at 90° and 270° respectively i.e.
tan 90o = tan 270o = α 2.
The graph of y = tan q has 3 parts namely 0° -> 90°, 90° 2700, 3600 3.
The tangent curve indefinitely approaches the vertical lines at 90° and 270° but never touches them.
Such lines (at 90° and 270°) are called asymptotes(here the curve approaches straight line parallel to the y- axis and distance from it by ± 90°, ±270°, ±450° etc.
but never reaches these straight lines.
Put in another form, the lines at 90° and 270° are said to be asymptotic curves.

APPLICATIONS OF GRAPHS OF TRIGONOMETRIC Functions: composite functions.
Example: (i) (a) Draw the graph of y = sin 20 for values of q between q and 360° (b) useyour graph to find the value of the following when q (ii) 25o (iii) 35o (iv) 50° Solution: (i) make a table of values thus for sin 2q ° q 0o 30 o 45 o 60 o 90 o 120 o 135 o 150 o 180 o SIN 0 0.87 1.0 0.87 0 -0.87 -1 -0.87 0 2q Note when q = 30° sin 20 = sin (2x 30) = sin 60° = 0.87 etc.
(ii) Chose a suitable scale for clarity Here the scale of 1 cm to 30° on the 0 axis and 4 cm to 1 unit on the sin 20, axis since no value of sin 20 exceeded 1.
(iii) Plot the points.
Here use graph sheet for a clearer picture of the graph.
(a) the angles being sort for are then marked out on the q (x-axis) and a vertical line drawn from it to the graphs wherever it NOUN 68MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY touches the graph, draw a horizontal line to the y -axis (sin 2q ) axis then read off the values or its approximations (b) q = 25° means that sin 2q = sin 2 x25° = sin 50°.
Then 50° lies between 30° and 60° so its value will be between the values of 30°(0.5) and 60° (0.87).
This value is approximately 0.85 (see graph below) (c) q = 35° means that sin 20 = sin 2x 35° = sin 70° 70° lies between 60° and 90°.
So its value will be between the values of 60° and 90° i.e.
(0.87 and 0).
From the graph it is approximately 0.49 (d) q = 50° -----> 2q = sin 2x50 = 100° .'.

This also applies to cosine, secant and cosecant.
Amplitude is always a positive number.
4.0 CONCLUSION Having treated the graph of trigonometric functions and their reciprocals and also in this unit, you have seen that the treatment of graphs here are the same with the treatment of graphs of algebraic functions, the only difference is in the values assigned to the independent variable (x) which in this case are angles.
The processes are the same thus (1) table of values (2) choice of scales (3) plotting of the points and joining it is believed that the treatment of graphs of trigonometric functions, will enable you see the interrelatedness of function waves, motions etc.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have attempted to draw the graphs of trigonometric functions, their reciprocals and inverse functions.
The properties of these graphs of trigonometric functions were highlighted such as: (i) The sine and cosine curves are continuous functions while the tangent and cotangent are discontinuous functions.
NOUN 72MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (ii) The periodicity of a function is the interval at which the graph repeats itself and such functions are called periodic functions example, the sine, cosine, tangent etc are periodic functions.
(iii) The periodicity for the sin, cos, sec and cosec is 360° while that of the tan and cot is 180° (iv) The amplitude or the length of a graph is the distance between the highest point and the x-axis of the function (v) The sine and cosine curves lies between -1 and 1 and they have the similar shape because cos q - sin (90 - q ) 7.0 REFERENCE Backhouse, J.

For example; sin q = tan q ; 1 = cosec q cos q sin q NOUN 74MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY cos q = cot q ; 1 = sec q sin q cos q If these relations are true for any given value of q such relations are called trigonometric identities, provided the functions are defined.
This unit will focus on trigonometric identities, which should form the basis for proving other identities, Compound angles, difference and product formulae, multiple and half angles and finally trigonometric equations, which are embedded in them.

Sin q = c -----> b sin c _____________ (1) b Cos q = a -------> b cos q = a ____________ (2) B NOUN 75MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY By Pythagoras theorem a2 + c2 = b2, so substituting the values of a and c from (1) and (2) we obtain; ( b cos q )2 + (b sin q )2 = b2, simplifying b2 COS2 q + b2 sin q = b2 , dividing through by b2, we have Sin2q +cos2q = 1 OR cos2q + sin2 = 1 Also Sin2q = 1 - cos2 q and Cos2 q = 1 – sin2q Example: 1.
Without tables or calculators find (a) sin260° + cos2 60° (b) sin2330° + cos2330° Solution: (a) sin260o = (cid:214) 3/2 and cos260° = ½ and substituting into sin260° + cos260°, gives; 2 (b) sin 330° = -sin 30° = -1/2 and cos 330° = cos 30 = (cid:214) 3/2 substituting into the given expression sin2 330° + cos2 330° to obtain; since this relation sin2q + cos2q =1, holds true for all values of q , it is then a trigonometric identity.
From the above trigonometric identity Sin2 + cos2 = 1, the following trigonometric identities can be deduced: Sin2 q + cos2 q =1 NOUN 76MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Divide through by cos q , this becomes Sin 2 q + cos 2 q = 1 Cos2q cos2q cos2q but sin 2 q = tan q and 1 = secq cos2q cos q sin 2 q + 1= 1 gives sinq 2 + 1 = Sec2q cos2q cos q cosq = Tan2q + 1 = sec2q = sec2q - 1 = tan2q Again, if we divide sin2q + cos2q = 1 by sin2q , it becomes Sin 2 q + cos q 1 sin2q sin2q sin2q , but cos q = cot q and 1 = cosec q sin q sin q 1 + cot2q = cosec2q Cosec2q - 1 = cot2q Other relations which can be deduced are (1) tan q x cot q = 1 (2) cos q x sec q = 1 (3) sin q x cosec q = 1 (4) 1- cos 2 q Note that 1 - cos2q = sin2q sin 2q 1- cos 2 q = sin 2 q sin2q sin2q NOUN 77MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY .'.
1- cos2 q = 1 Hence from these sin2q examples it can be deduced that knowing the value one of the trigonometric functions of an acute angle is possible to find the value of the others.

TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATIONS.
Trigonometric equation is an equation involving an unknown quantity under the sign of a trigonometric function.
Techniques for solving trigonometric equations.
: (1) take care to see that the transformed equation is equivalent to the original equation.
(8) reduce the given equation to an equation involving only one trigonometric ratio where involving only one trigonometric ratio where possible.
This is about the simplest way of solving a trigonometric equation, example 3+ 2 cos q = 4 sin2q , it is convenient to express this equation in terms of cos q since sin2q = 1 - cos i.e.
3+ 2 cos q = 4 (1- cos2q ) the solve the equation as a quadratic equation in one variable (cos2q ) (3) when the terms of the equation have been squared or you have performed some transformed that do not guarantee equivalence, check all the solutions to avoid less of roots.
Example: 1.
Solve the equation, giving values of q from 0 to 360 inclusive.
(a) 3 - 3 cos q = 2 sin2 q (b) cos2 q + sin q + 1 = 0 Solution (a) 3-3cosq = 2sin2 q , here the members of the equation can be expressed as cos q since sin q = 1 – cos2 q \ 3 - 3cos q = 2(1 - cos2q ) = 3-3cosq = 2-2cos2q = 2cos2q - 3cos q +1 = 0.
NOUN 78MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY This is a quadratic equation in cos q and thus can be solved by any of the methods of quadratic equation.
By factorization 2cos q - 3cos q + 1 = 0 gives; (2 cosq - 1) (cos q - 1) = 0 either 2cosq - 1 = 0 OR cosq - 1 = if 2cosq - 1 = 0 =:> cos = ½ and cos q is +ve \ q = cos-1 ½ = 60° or 300° if cos q = 1, q = cos-1 1 = 0 or 360° \ the values of q which satisfy the equation within the given range of 0 < q < 360° are q = 0°.
60°, 300° and 360°.
(b) Cos2 q + sinq + 1 = 0 It is easier to transform Cos2 q to 1-sin q to form an equation of powers of a sin2q .
Thus; (1 - sin2 q ) + sin q + 1 = 0 1-sin2 q + sin q + 1 =0 =:> 1-sin2 q + sinq + 2 = 0 Factorizing: (sin q - 2)(sin q +l) = 0 .'.
either sinq -2 = 0 or sin q + 1 = 0 if sinq -2 =0 => sin q =2 and q = sin-1 2 This value of q does not satisfy the given equation because sinq lies between -1 and 1 to satisfy the given equation.
So q = sin -1 2 is not a solution if sin q + 1 = 0.
Sin = - 1 => q = sin-1(-1) = 270° \ q = 270° is the root of the equation becomes it falls within the range 0 < q < 360° 2.
Find all the solutions of the equation in the interval 0 < q < 360° 16cos2q + 2sin q = 13 Solution Cos2q = 1 sin2 q , this will be substituted into the equation to give; 16(1- sin2 q ) + 2sin q = 13 NOUN 79MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 16 – 16 sin2 q +2sin q = 13 = 0 =:> 16sin2 q - 2sin q - 16 – 13 = 0 => 16sin2 q -2sin - 3 = 0 Factorising gives (8sinq + 3)(2sin q - 1) =0 .'.
either 8sinq + 3 = 0 OR 2sinq - 1 = 0 so, if 8sin0 +3 = 0 =:> sinq = -3/8 q = sin-1(-3/8) = sin-1(-0.375) From the tables 0 = -22°.
This lies either in the third or fourth quadrant since sinq is negative \ q = 180 + 22° 2' or 360° - 22° 2' = 202° 2' or 337° - 58' if 2sinq = 1 = ===> sin q = ½ =:> q = sin-1 ( ½ ) .'.
q = 30° since sinq is positive, q is either in the first or second quadrant .'.
q = 30° or 180° - 30° = 30 ° or 150° \ the solution of the equations for 0 < q < 360° is q = 30, 150°, 202° 21' and 337° 58' .

x = (cid:214) 169= ± 13 .'.
sin q = 5/±13 and cos q = ±12/±3, but q is obtuse, hence sin q = 5/13 and cosq = -12/13 .'.
sin q = 5/13 and sec q = 1/cosq gives; sec q = -1 - -13 12 12 13 4.
Prove the following identities: sec2q + cosec2 q = sec q cosec2 q Solution: In problems of this sort, start from whatever expressions (either left hand side or right hand side) to show that it is equal to the other (right hand side or left hand side) whichever is simpler Thus starting from the left hand side (LHS) Sec2 q + cosec2 q = 1 + 1 Cos2q sin2q Simplifying gives sin 2 q + cos q Cos2q sin2q But sin2 q +cos2q = 1 \ sin 2 q + cos q = 1 Cos2q sin2q Cos2q sin2q = 1 + 1 Cos2q sin2q = sec2q x cosec2q = sec2q x cosec2q = RHS Note that in examples 1 and 2 we concentrated only on angles in the first revolution or basic angles.

In this unit, we shall discuss, the solution of triangles (all types of triangles) in which case finding all the angles and sides of a triangle when the following are known either; (1) 2 sides and an included or non included angle or angles and a side and (2) the three side or three angles are given .
Several methods are used in the solution of triangles but here, we shall consider two important ratios - the sine and cosine rules, which make use of the definitions of sine and cosine of an angle.
In providing solutions, the following are to be remembered (1) the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180° (2) the angles are in proportion to their sides, NOUN 95MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY these information help in the fixing of the shape of a triangle(the angle opposite the greater side is bigger than the angle opposite the smaller side).
The angles of elevation and depressions are defined and is used in the calculation of heights and distances in practical problems 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, the students should be able to: • derive the sine and cosine rules • apply the sine and cosine rules correctly to solutions of triangles • deduce the correct area of triangle using trigonometric ratios is ½ a b Sin C or ½ b c sin A or ½ ac sin B • define angles of elevation and depression • apply trigonometric ratios to angles of elevation and depression in finding heights and distances.
3.1 SOLUTION OF TRIANGLES 3.1.1 SINE RULE So many of you must have used the sine rule without knowing its proof.
Here is a proof of the Sine Rule The Sine Rule is for any triangle (acute or obtuse angled).
Hence, Given any triangle ABC with the usual notations see fig 6.1 (a) and (b) below.
A C a Fig 6.1 (a) NOUN 96MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY B D Fig 6.1 (b) Fig 6.1 9a) is an acute angled triangle and fig.
6.1 (b) is an obtuse - angled triangle: Given; ∆ABC as shown in figs 6.1 (a and b) above Required to prove (R.T.P) ; a = b = c (sin rule) sin A sin B sin C Construction: Draw AD perpendicular to BC (fig 6.1 a) Or Draw AD perpendicular to BC produced (fig 6.1 b) Proof: in ∆ABD in fig 6.1a.
_________________ (1) Sin B = x/c, this means that C sin B = x _________________ (2) Also in ∆ADC in fig 6.1 a.
Sin C = x/b => b sin C = x, this means that in both (1) and (2) X = c sin B = b sin C and dividing both sides by Sin B Sin C gives.
c = b _______________ (3) sin C sin B In fig 6.1 b the obtuse angled triangle In ∆ADC Sin B = x/c => c sin B= x ________________(4) NOUN 97MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Sin (180 -C) = x but sin (180 - C) = sin C (the sin q of an obtuse B angle is equal to the sine of its supplement i.e.
both angles sum up to 180°) .'.
Sin C = x/b => b sin C = x ____________ (5) dividing both sides c Sin B = b Sin C = x by Sin B Sin C gives c = b sin C sin B So in both the acute and obtuse angled triangles the same results were obtained if the perpendicular is dropped from C to AB, it can also be proved that (you can try this) a = b = c sin A sin B sin C. This is the Sine Rule.
Here A is angle at A and a is the side opposite the angle at A, the same applies to B and b and C and c. Note that this sine rule can be written as sin A = sin B = sin C a b c The sine rule is used to solve a triangle when; (i) any two sides and any one side is given and (ii) any two sides and a non-included angle is given.
Example 1 1.
Solve the following triangles ABC which have; (a) < A = 25° 25', < B = 62° 51' and a = 3.
82cm.
(b) <A = 112° 2', a = 5.23 cm and b = 7.65cm (c) <C = 125° 43', a = 4.2cm and c = 8.2cm.
Solutions: Remember to make a sketch of the triangle putting into consideration the conditions.
(a) in ∆ ABC, since two angles A and B and one side a is given we need to find < C and sides b and c.; NOUN 98MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY substituting the values of <A and <B into the equation gives; 25° 52' + 62° 15' + <C = 180 \ < C = 180 - (25° 52' +- 62° 15') =180 – 88o 7' = 91o 53' \ < C 91° 53' Fig 6: 2.
To get the sides b and c using the sine rule a = b = c , any Sin A sin B sin C two of these equations can be used thus: 3.82 b sin(25°45') sin(62°15' ) = b sin 25° 52' = 3.82sin(62° 15') \ b = 3.82 sin(62°15') = 3.82 sin(62.25) sin 25°52' sin(25.87) You can use your calculator or logarithm tables here for easy calculations.
In the example calculations was used.
b = 3.380652755 = 7.75 cm 0.4363307212 .'.
b = 7.75 cm for c, any of the two equations can also be applied.
NOUN 99MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY a c sin A sin C 3.82 c sin 25.870 sin 91:88 = c sin 25 .
87° = 3.82 sin91:88° 3.82 sin 91° :88' ===> sin 25.87 3.817943802 C = 0.4363307212 C = 8.75cm \ < c =91.88°,b=7.75 cm and c=8.75cm.
Note this values are in agreement with the condition that "greater angles face greater sides.
(b) < A = 112° 2' and a = 5.23 cm and b = 7.65cm observe here that the side a = 5.23 facing angle A is smaller than the side b = 7.65cm and it is not possible to have a triangle with two obtuse angles, hence side should be greater than b and since this is not the case.
The triangle has be opposite the larger angle (try to solve this triangle, what did you observed?)
(c) <C = 125° 43°, a = 4.2 cm and c = 8.2cm.
Solution There is a possible solution here since < C which is larger has a side c greater than side a.

Required to Prove: c2 = a2 + b2 - 2a b cos C (cosine rule) Construction: Draw a perpendicular from A to B C (fig 6.3a) and from A to BC produced (fig 6.3b.)
Proof: in fig:6.3a in ∆ABC.
b2 = x2 + y2 (1) (Pythagoras theorem) in ∆ABC, c22 = (a -x)2 + y2,by simplification, c2 -a2-2ax+x2 +y2 but x2 + y2 = b2 in (1) substituting c2 = a2 - 2ax + b2 (2) In ∆ABC, cos C= x/b => b cos C = x NOUN 102MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY so substituting for x in (2) gives c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C .'.
C2 - a2 + b2 - 2abcos C Proof: in fig 6.3b.
(Obtuse angled triangle) In ∆ADC, b2 =X2+ y2 (ii) (Pythagoras theorem.)
In ∆ABD, C2 = (a+ x)2 + y2(Pythagoras theorem.)
Simplifying gives, c2 = a2 + 2ax +Y?
(2) But x2 + y2 = b2 (1) So substituting in (2) for b2 gives c2 = a2 +b2 + 2ax In ∆ADC, cos(180 - c) = x/b , but cos (I80 - C) Since < C is obtuse is - cos Ctherefore; -cos C = x/b ====> -bcosC = x So substituting for the value of x in (2) , you obtain: C2 = a2 + b2 + 2a ( - b cos C) C2 = a2 + b22 - 2ab cos C. This is the same result as for the acute angled triangle.
And this is the Cosine Rule: C2 = a2 + b22 - 2ab cos C Also by renaming the angles and /or re-drawing the perpendiculars the following cosine rules can also be proved (try it) a2 = b2 + c2 - 2ax cosA OR b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos B The cosine rule is applied in the solution of triangles when the following are given: (1) two sides and an included angle or (2) three sides.
NOUN 103MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Example: 2 1.
Solve triangle ABC, with; (a) A= 42°.
83°, b = 7.23 cm and C = 5.46cm.
(b) <B = 150 .3°, a = 8.91 cm and c = 5.26 cm.
(c) C = 4.05, a = 2.25cm and b = 6.24 cm Solution: Note always remember to make a sketch of the triangle, noting that the angles should represent its type (acute or obtuse) and the sides should be proportional.
Fig 6.4.
Since we are looking for the side a the cosine rule is to be used since b and c are given using: A2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos A and substituting b = 7.23 cm, C = 5.46cm and A = 42.83o which were given into the formula and simplifying gives: A2 = (7.23)2 + (5.46)2 - 2 (7.23)(5.46) cos 42.83 = 52.2729 + 29.8116 - (14.46)(5.46) (0.7334) = 52.2729 + 29.8116 - 57.9015 = 82.0845 - 57.9015 = 82.0845 - 57.9015 = 24.183 a2 = 24.183 a =(cid:214) 24.183 = 4.9176 .'.
a = 4.92cm NOUN 104MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Here the positive square root of a was taken because we are dealing with lengths.
To find the angles either use the sine or cosine rule whichever is easier for you (Now we try both rules) (a) using the sine rule Sin C = sin A this means that c a a sin C = c sin A and then sin C = c sin A a so substituting for the values of c = 5.46cm, A = 42.83° and a = 4.92 cm into the equation gives; sin C = 5.46 sin42.s3 = 0.754403732 4.92 .'.
<C = sin-1 (0.7544) = 48.98° = 49° (b) Using the cosine rule: C2=b2+a2 - 2abcosC From here, even one can make cos C the subject of the formula thus: COs C = a 2 +b 2 - C 2 2ab and substituting the values of a = 4.92cm, b = 7.23cm and c = 5.46cm, we obtain cos C = (4.92) + (7.23) - (56) 2(4.92)(7.23) = 24.2064 + 52.2729 - 29.8116 71.1432 cos C = 46.6677 = 0.6559685255 NOUN 105MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 71.1432 .'.
<C = cos-1 0.6559685255 = 49.40687 = 49.01o So the two methods (a) and (b) gave the same value for but it is usually easier to sue the sine rule in finding the missing angles.

48° Note from our earlier discussion on the proofs of the sine and cosine rules the quickest/easiest method used in the solution of triangles depends on the information given, which are summarized below: 1.
Given three sides of the triangle as in example 2(C) NOUN 108MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Cos A = b 2 + c 2 - a 2 2bc OR Cos B = a 2 + c 2 - b 2 2ac OR Cos C = a 2 +b 2 -c 2 2ab Can be used to find any of the two angles and the third angles is found, by the use of the sum of the interior angles of a triangle i.e.
<A+<B+<C=180° 2.
Given two angles and one side In example 1(a), two angles and one side is given, the sine rule is used here, to find the length of the sides thus: a = b sin A sin B because < C can easily be found by 180 - 62.25 -25.87 = 91 .88° or a = c to find the side C. sin A Sin C 3.
Given two sides and an included angle in this figure, NOUN 109MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY < B is given which lies between the two given sides a and c. The cosine rule is used a in example 2(a) above to find the side to b then the sine rule is used to find either < A or < C then the third angle can be found by the sum of angles of triangle theorem 4,.
Given two sides and a non - included angles that is the angle does not lies between the two given sides.
Two cases are treated here.
Case 1: When the given angle is acute two possible triangles can be drawn as follows: Fig6.6 If the side opposite the given angles B in this case is less than the other given angle C i.e.
b < c as in Fig 6.6. above.
This means that < C will have two values(acute and obtuse) Case II When the side opposite the given angle is greater as in Fig 6.7 below, only one triangle is possible (b > c and ^B is acute) Fig: 6.7 NOUN 110MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY In both cases the sine rule is used to find one of the angles and the side can be found by either the sine or cosine rule Example: Solve the triangle A BC with C = 10.46°, c = 2.25cm and a = 6.24cm.
A 2 b 2 Solution In the figure above, there are two possible triangles since c < a i. e. 2.25 < 6.24 using the sine rule to find < A sin A sin C a c =Sin A = a sin C c = 6.24sin10.46 = 0.5034960036 2.25 sin A = 0.5034960036 A = sin-1( 0.5034960036) A= 30.23 ° But A is either acute or obtuse.

A = 30.23° or (180 - 30.23°) NOUN 111MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY = 30.23° or 149.77° so when < A = 30.23° < B = 180 - 30.23 -10.46 (sum s < of ∆) 180 - 40.69 = 139.31o and when <A=30.23° < B = 180 - (149.77 + 10.46) = 180 - 160.23 = 190 .

So we can define the angle of elevation as the angle that lies between the observers eye level (horizontal plane) and the line of sight when the observer tries to see something above him/her.
Similarly, the angle of depression is the angle between the observer's eye level and the ground when the observer is above the ground see fig.

Fig: 6.10c.
From the above figures it can be easily seen that angle of elevation and angle of depression are alternate angles (two horizontal lines are ).
These two angles are frequently used in the application of trigonometric functions to triangles.

1.0 INTRODUCTION Very often people talk about finding their bearings.
Have you ever taken out time to find out what this means/ has it any relation with mathematics?
Why should one bother about his/her location?
The answer to these questions shall be provided in this unit many a time, when walking along the road or traveling by air or 'ship, the compass is displayed in front of the Geologists, Surveyors Pilots or Navigators or sailors.
This instrument makes them have a focus on their journey or gives sense of direction.
In this unit, the place of the cardinal point or compass in relation to the location of places shall be discussed.
This will form the basis of our solution to practical problems.
The bearing is a means of locating the angular inclination between two or more objects in different positions.
Note: In trigonometry (positive) angles are measured in the anticlockwise direction but in bearing, the angles are measured in the clockwise direction, that is from the first quadrant to the fourth quadrant to the third, the second and back to the first depending on the location of the object whose bearing is sought.
In the treatment of bearing, the following should be borne in mind.
NOUN 116MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (i) all measurement of angles start from the North pole (clockwise direction) previously the letter N or S comes before any angular measure but this is no longer conventional rather we now use the three digit number referred to as "true bearing" Example instead of N 30 E, we now write 030°.
This is for easy location of the quadrant where the place or object or point is.
(ii) Write the angle derivation starting from the north to the desired line 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to • explain clearly the term bearing • locate the bearing of given places • apply trigonometric ratios to problems involving bearings.
3.1 BEARING The compass has eight cardinal points namely, North (N), South (S), East(E), West(W),North East(NE), North West(NW), South East(SE) and South West(SW).
the diagram is in figure 7.1 below N NE W E SE S Fig 7.1 Using fig.
7.1 as an example the bearing of S from O (center) is obtained by measuring the angle from the North in the clockwise direction to the line joining O and S i.e to OSSO the bearing of S from O is 180° in this case (see arrow) NOUN 117MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Example In the diagram below find the following W Fig 7.2a.
P Fig 7.2b.
(a) the bearing of P from O (b) the bearing of A from O.
Solution: (a) the bearing of P from O is the angle OP makers with the North Pole measured in the clockwise sense so here it is 90 + 48 = 138° i.e.
the angle measured from North to the line OP in the clockwise direction.
(see fig 7.2b.)
(b) The bearing of A from O is 40° written as cardinal points, it is written N 40° E In which case the letter N will be written first and E or W after the angle.
In cardinal points the bearing of P from O might be written as S 42° E = 138°.
NOUN 118MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Note it is always better to use the three digit number (true bearing) for easy identification of the quadrant where the place or point is located.
2.
State the bearing of each of the following directions (a) N, (b) E (c) SE (d) S (e) W and (f) NW S Fig.
7.3 Solution: Since bearings are measured in the clockwise direction from the North the bearing are as follows: (a) N = 000° (it has no inclination) (b) E = 090° (90° from the North Pole) (c) SE = 90 + 45° = 135° (SE is half way between the fast and the South) (d) S = 180° (e) W = 270° (f) NW = 315° 9270° + 45°) again because NW is half way between the North and the West.
3.
In the figure on below what is the bearing of E NOUN 119MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (a) A from O (b) B from O (c) C from O (d) O from A Solution (a) the bearing of,&from O is 057° (b) the bearing of B from O = 180° + 30 = 210° (c) the bearing from C from O = (270 + 49) = 319° (d) the bearing of O from A - this is got by first drawing a cardinal point at A see diagram below.
A now lies on the East - West line, the alternate angle is located N 237o W E N 57o W E S 55o Fig 7.4 Therefore the bearing of O from A is 180 + 57° = 237° (starting from the North pole at A to the line 0 A (see arrow above) Also finding the bearing of O from D , the same procedure is followed, hence the bearing of O from D = 270 + 55° = 325° NOUN 120MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Exercise 7.1.
Now try this as an exercise.
In the figure below find the following: N V W E Z S (a) the bearing of X from O = 070 (b) the bearing of Y from O = 45o (c) the bearing of Z from O = 195o (d) the bearing of V from O = 195o (e) the bearing of O from X = 2500 (f) the bearing of O from Y = 3250o (g) the bearing of O from Z = 015o (h) the bearing of O from V.= 100o The answers to the above exercise are written in red to serve as a check on your progress.
Now substituting the values a = 15km because it is facing angle A, B = 12km and C = 9km or b = 9km and c = 12km, the most important side has been determined and that is the side facing the angle A .'.
Cos A= 12 2 +9 2 -15 2 2x12x9 144+81-225 216 225 - 225 = 0 = 0 216 216 NOUN 121MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY ====>CosA=0 .'.
A = cos-1 0 = 90° .'.
A=<XYZ=90° Hence the bearing of Z from Y is then calculated from the North Pole in Y to the line joining Y and Z i.e.
Y Z 90° + 60 = 150° 4.
The calculate the bearing of X from Z the sine rule is first applied to find part the angle of Z thus: 15 = 12 sin A sin Z 12 sin A '.
sin Z = 15, but A = 90° from (b) sinZ= l2sin90 = 12 = 0.8 15 15 Z = sin-1 (0.8) = 53.13°, Then the bearing of X from Z (see diagram) Remember the angle at Z should be 90 - 30° - 53, 13° = 6.87° (see diagram) Practical Example On Bearing 1.
Femi traveled a distance of 12km from X on a bearing of 060° to Y.
He then travels a distance of 9km to a point Z and Z is 15km from X.

(c) Calculate the bearing of X from Z. NOUN 122MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Solution In drawing the diagram above, Femi moved from X to Y so the angle is between the North in X to Y i.e.
from the North pole in X to the line XY and the distance stated from Y to Z is on a different bearing.
To find the bearing draw the four cardinal points in Y and read off.
(b) A repeat of the diagram is made here, Solution In drawing the diagram above, Femi moved from X to Y so the angle is between the North in X to Y i.e.
from the North pole in X to the line XY and the distance stated from Y to Z is on a different bearing.
To find the bearing draw the four cardinal points in Y and read off.
NOUN 123MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (b) A repeat of the diagram is made here, Let the < X Y Z in ∆ X Y Z be denoted by A and since the three sides of the triangle are known, the cosine formula is used - a2 = b2+c2 - 2bccosA \ cos A = b 2 +c 2 - a 2 2bc \ X = 20sin30 sin 105 20 x 0.5 = 10.3528km 0.9659 \ x = 10.4km (3 sig figs).
So the distance between the two village is 10.4km (b) Let the distance between Lokoja and the villager be represented by y km Again applying the sine rule, we obtain.
20 = y sin 105 sin 450 20sin45 o \ y = sin 105 = 20 x 0.7071 0.9659 y = 14.64km NOUN 124MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY the distance between Lokoja and the village Z is 14.6km (3 sig figs) Exercise 7.2 1.

i.e.
