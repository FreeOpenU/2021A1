7.0 REFERENCES AND OTHER MATERIALS 1.0 INTRODUCTION Before starting any discussion in trigonometric ratios, you should be able to: (i) Identify the sides of a right-angled triangle in relation to a marked angle in the triangle.
If this is not the case do not worry.
You can quickly go through this now: In the diagram see.
Fig.
(i.)
showing a A c B a Fig (i) NOUN 11MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Right-angled triangle ABC, right angled at B, with angle at C marked q and the sides marked a, b, c, AC = b is called the hypothenus AB = c i.e.
the side facing the marked angle q at C is called the opposite side of the angle at C adjacent side to the angle at C. (ii) Again, you should recall that the ratios of two numbers "x and y" can either be expressed as x/ or y/ .
If you have forgotten this, please, refresh your y x memories for this is important in the unit you are about to study.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to â€¢ define trigonometric ratios of a given angle.
â€¢ State the relationship between the trigonometric ratios â€¢ Locate the quadrant of the trigonometric ratios of given angles â€¢ Find the basic angles of given angles.
3.1.l.
TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS Having refreshed your minds on the sides of a right-angled triangle and the concept of ratios you are now ready to study the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine and tangent).
This has to do with the ratio of the sides of a right-angled triangle.
Here is an example.
a In âˆ†ABC, with A < B = 90Â° and < C = q and the sides of âˆ†ABC, NOUN 12MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY AB c = marked a, b, c, respectively, then AC - b = opposite side to the angle at C is sine q or simply sin q .
Hypotenuse In âˆ†ABC see Fig 8 1.12 A b c Ó¨ C B a A fig: 1.12 = adjacent side to the angle C is called Cosine q or simply Cos q and in fig: 1.13 Hypotenuse Below AB c ------ = A BC a fig: 1.13 = Opposite side, to the angle C is called tangent q or tan q from the above ratios, NOUN 13MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Adjacent side to the angle C you can see that sin q opposite side Ã· adjacent side = cosq hypothenus hypothenus using the notation of the sides of âˆ†ABC sin q c a = cosq b Ã· b c opposite side = a adjacent side tan = q In the above, at an acute angle and with the knowledge that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180o.
What do you think will happen to the trigonometric rations?
This takes us to the relationships between trigonometric ratios.
3.1.2.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS.
B Fig: 1.14 In âˆ†ABC in fig 1.14 with the usual notations < B = 900 and < C = q , therefore < A = 90 - q .
Once more finding the trigonometric ratios in relation to the angle at A.
Sin (90o â€“ q ) = BC = a = opposite side to angle A AC b hypothenus = COs q Sin (90o â€“ q ) = AB = c = opposite side to angle A AC b hypothenus = Sin q You might happen wonder what happens to tan (900-0), this will be discussed later.
In summary, given âˆ†ABC as shown Sin q = Cos (900 - q ) NOUN 14MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Cos q = sin (90Â° -q ) and Sin q = tan q Cosq The conclusion from the summary of these trigonometric ratios is that the sine of an acute angle equals the cosine of its complement and vice versa.
Thus sin 300 = cos 600, cos 50Â° = sin 400 etc.
(these angles are called complementary angles because their sum is 90o 1 .e.
30Â° + 60Â° = 90Â°, 50Â° + 40 = 90oetc) Now go through the examples above carefully and try this exercise.
(1) Find the value of q in the following (i) cos q Â° = sin q (ii) sin 35Â° = cos q (iii) sin 12Â° = Cos q (iv) cos 73Â° = Sin q .
In case you are finding it difficult, the following are the solutions.
Solutions: (i) Cos 50Â° = sin (90Â° - q ) =sin (90Â° -50Â°) = sin 40Â° (because 50Â° + 40Â° = 90Â°) (ii) Sin 35Â° = cos (90Â° - 35Â°) = Cos 55Â° ( since 35Â° + 55Â° = 90Â°) (iii) Sin 12Â° = Cos (90Â° - 12Â°) = Cos 78Â° (iv) Cos 73Â° = Sin (90Â° - 73Â°) (2) Find the trigonometric ratios in their following triangle B Solution: Since there is the measurement of a side missing i.e.
AC, and the triangle is right - angled âˆ†, Using Pythagoras theorem to find the missing side BC2 = AB2 + AC2 (Pythagoras theorem) Substituting for the sides 52 = 42 + AC2 25 = 16 + AC2 25 - 16 = AC2 9 =AC2 NOUN 15MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY \ AC = (cid:214) 9=3, then since.
sin q = AB = 4 = 0.8 BC 5 cosq = AC = 3 = 0.6 BC 5 tan q = AB = 4 =1.33Â° AC 3 (3) In the following, angle q is acute and angle Î± is acute.
Find the following trigonometric ratios.
8 15 (a) sin Î± (b) cos Î± (c) tan Î± (d) cos q (e) sin q (f) tan q Solutions: (a) sin Î± = BC = 15 AC 17 (b) cos Î± = AB = 8 AC 17 (c) tan Î± = BC = 15 AB 8 (d) cos q = BC = 15 AC 17 (e) sin q = AB = 8 AC 17 (f) tang = AB = 8 BC 15 You can notice from example (3) that since the sum Î± and q is 90Â° (i.e.
Î± + q 90Â°)that: Sin Î± = Cos q and Cos Î± = Sin q .
This again shows that Î± and q are complementary angles.
NOUN 16MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Having known what trigonometric ratios are, you will now proceed to finding trigonometric ratios of any angle.
3.3 TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS OF ANY ANGLE.
It is possible to determine to some extent the trigonometric ratios of all angles using the acute angles in relation to the right-angled triangle.
But since all problems concerning triangles are not only meant for right angle triangles, ~it is then good to extend the concept of the trigonometric ratios to angles of any size (i.e.
between 0Â° and any angle).
To achieve the above, you take a unit circle i.e.
a circle of radius I unit, drawn Fig: 2.0 In the Cartesian plane (x and y plane) the circle is divided into four equal parts each of which is called a quadrant (1st, 2nd, 3rd.
4th respectively).
Angles are either measured positively in an anti clockwise direction (see fig 2.1) Positive NOUN 17MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig: 2.1 Or negatively in a clockwise direction.
Fig: 2.2 Example.
In the diagrams below Positive +70 Â° = - 290Â° + 10Â° = -350 Note: Since this concerns angles at a point their sum is 360Â°.
But angles of sizes greater than 360Â° will always lie in any of the four quadrants.
This is determined by NOUN 18MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY first trying to find out how many revolutions (one completed revolution = 360Â°) there are contained in that angle.
For example, (b) 390Â° contains 1(360Â°) plus 30Â° i.e.
390Â° = 360Â° + 300, 30Â° is called the basic angle of 390Â° and since 30Â° is in the first quadrant, 390Â° is also in the first quadrant.
(a) 600Â° = 360Â° + 240Â°, since 240Â° is in the third quadrant, 600Â° is also in the third quadrant.
To find the basic angle of any given angle subtract 360Â° (1 complete revolution) from the given angle until the remainder is an angle less than 360Â° , then locate the quadrant in which the remainder falls that becomes the quadrant of the angle.
Now have fun with this exercise, Exercise: Find the basic angles of the following and hence indicate the quadrants in which they fell.
(1) 670Â° (2) 740Â° (3) 1998Â° (4) 2002Â° (5) 2106Â° (6) 544Â° Are you happy, Now, move to the next step.
To determine the signs whether positive or negative of the angles and their trigonometric ratios in the four quadrants; First, choose any point P(x, y) on the circle and O is the center of the circle.
Fig: 2.3 q P = r, is the radius and OP makes an angle of Î± with the positive x - axis.
Since P is any point, OP is rotated about 0 in the anti clockwise direction, Hence in the 1st quadrant (0Â° < q < 90Â° ), using your knowledge of trigonometric ratios.
NOUN 19MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Sin Î± = PA = +y = y/r is positive q P +r cos Î± = q A = +x = x/r is also positive q P +r tan Î± = q P = +y = y/x is also positive q A +x Therefore in first quadrant (acute angles) all the trigonometric ratios are positive.
2nd quadrant (90 < Î± Â° < 180Â°) (obtuse angles) Fig: 2.4 In âˆ†PBO , < at O is 180 - Î±, here BO is - x (it lies on the negative x axis) but y and r are positive.
The trigonometric ratios are Sin (180 -Î±) = PB = +y = y/r is positive PO +r Cos (180 -Î±) = BO = -x = -x/r is negative PO +r Tan (180 - Î±) = PB = + y = -y/x is negative BO -r So, only the sine of the obtuse angle is positive, the other trigonometric ratios are negative.
Guess what happens in the 3rd quadrant (reflex angles).
3rd quadrant 180 < Î±Â° < 270Â° (reflex angles) NOUN 20MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Note q P = r (i.e.)
the radius is always positive.
Reference is made to 180Â°, so the angle is (180 + Î±)Â° or Î± - 180Â° Fig: 2.5 Sin(Î± -180Â°) â€“y/+r = - y/r which is negative Cos(Î± -180Â°) = -x/r = - x/r is negative tan(Î± -180Â°) - - y/-x is positive so if the angle Î± lies between 180Â° and 270Â° the sine, cosine o9f that angle are negative while the tangent is positive.
4th quadrant 270Â° <Î±< 360Â° (Double Reflex angles) y NOUN 21MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig 2.6 Here PA is negative but OA and OP are positive.
Sin (360 â€“ Î±) = - y/+r = -y/r is negative Cos (360 â€“ Î±) +x/+r = x/r is positive Tan (360 - Î±) = -y/+x = -- y/x is negative.
Here again sine and tangent of any angle that lies between 270Â° and 360Â° are negative the cosine of that angle is positive.
Looking at the figures above, it is seen that the sign of a cosine is similar to the sign of the x - axis( and coordinate) while the sign of a sine is similar to the sign of y - coordinate (i.e.
y - axis).
The signs can then be written in the four quadrants as shown below see fig: 2.7 NOUN 22MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig 2.7 Fig 2.8.
Figure 2.8 is a summary of the signs in their respective quadrants, thus going in the anticlockwise direction, the acronym is; (1) CASt(from the 4th to 1st to 2nd and then 3rd) (ii) ACTS (from 1st 4th 3rd then 2nd ) Clockwise (iii) All Science Teachers Cooperate (ASTC) (from the 1st 2nd --> 3rd -> 4th ).
The letters in figure 2,8 (marked quadrants) show the trigonometric ratios that are positive.
(iv) SACT (2nd -> 1 st -> 4th -> 3rd ) (v) TASC (3rd --> 2nd -> 1 st -> 4th) NOUN 23MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Example: Indicate the quadrants of the following angles and state whether their trigonometric ratios of each is positive or negative.
(1) 155Â° (11) 525Â° (iii) 62Â° (iv) 310Â° (v) 233Â° Solution: (1) 155Â° lies between 90Â° and 180Â° and therefore is in the 2nd quadrant.
The sine of 155Â° is positive while the cosine and tangent, of 155Â° are negative.
Thus: sin 155Â° is + ve but cos 155Â° and tan 155Â° are negative using the tabular form No Angles Quadrant Positive trig, Negative trig.
ratios ratios 1 155o 2nd sin cos and tan 2nd sin cos and tan 525" =360" +165Â° the 2 basic angle is 165Â° 3 62o Ist sin, cos and tan none 4 310o 4th cos sin, and tan 5 233o 3rd tan sin and cos Alternatively, the solution can be thus 1.
155Â° is in the 2nd quadrant, here only the sin and cosec are positive.
sin(1550) = +sin (180 - 155Â°) =sin 25Â° cos 155Â° = - cos (180 - 155Â°) = - cos 25Â° tan 155Â° = - tan (180 - 155) = - tan 25Â° 2.
525Â°; the basic angle of 525Â° is gotten by 525Â° = 360Â° + 160Â° (one complete revolution plus 165Â°) .'.
525 = 165 the basic angle lies in the 2nd quadrant and so 525 is in the 2nd quadrant where only the sin is positive sin 525Â° = sin 165Â° = sin (180 - 165) = sin 15Â° cos 525Â° = - cos (180-165) - cos 15Â° tan 525Â° = - tan(180 - 165) = - tan 15Â° NOUN 24MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 3.
62Â°, this is in the first quadrant, where all the trig.
Ratios are positive, therefore sin 62Â° = + sin 62Â°; cos 62Â° = + cos 62Â° ; tan 62Â° = + tan 62Â°; 4.
310Â° is in the 4th quadrant where only the cosine is positive, thence.
sin 3100 = - sin (360 - 310) = - sin 50Â° cos 310Â° = + cos (360 - 310) = + cos 50Â° tan 310Â° = - tan (360 -310) = - tan 50Â° 5.
233Â° is in the 3rd quadrant, only tan is positive, so: sin 233Â° = - sin (233 - 180Â°) = - sin 53Â° cos 233Â° = -cos (233 - 180Â°) = - cos 53Â° tan 233Â° = + tan (233 - 180Â°) = + tan 53Â° Exercise 2.1 Show in which of the quadrant each of the following angles occur and state whether the trigonometric ratio of the angle is positive or negative.

You should have also learnt that the value of any angle depended on its basic angle and its sign depends on the quadrant in which it is found.
Thou now understand that the most commonly used trigonometric ratios are the sine , cosine and tangent; and the basic angle q lies between OÂ° and 360Â° i.e.
OÂ° <_q <_ 360Â° 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have seen that the trigonometric ratios with respect to a right- angled triangle is Sin q = opposite i.e.

In this unit, the expressed as y/x will be used thus in fig 2.1 (a) Sin q = AB = c AC b Cos q = BC = a and AC b Tan q = AB = c BC a.
Now if this relationship is viewed in this order.
C a Fig: 2.1 (b) AC = hypothenus = b it is called cosecants or cosecs AB opposite c AC = a = adjacent BC c Opposite is called cotangent opposite of q or cot q .
Now study the above ratios carefully, what can you say of their relationship?
This leads us to the following sub-heading RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS.
As you can see sin 6 and cosc 6 for example are related in the sense that Sin q = opposite = c from fig: 2.1(a) hypothenus b and cosecq = hypothenus = b from fig: 2.1(b) opposite c NOUN 30MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY which means that cosecq = 1 Opposite hypothenus = hypothenus opposite = b c This then means that cosec q is the reciprocal of sin q and sin q is the reciprocal of cosec q .
From the above ratios also, you can see ; Exercise l: (i) find the other reciprocals.
Now try this.
the above example serves as a guide.
(ii) verify that cos q / sin q = cot q for any triangle.
Is this surprising.
This is the beauty of the trigonometric ratios Note from the sum of angles of a triangle giving 180Â°, the following relations can be proved.
a Fig; 2.22 You should recall that in unit 1, Sin (90o - q ) = cos q and Cos (90Â° - q ) = sin q now let us, see the tangent.
Tan (90Â° -q ) = BC/AC in fig: 2.2 i.e.
= a/c = cot q Also sec (900 â€“ q ) = cosec q .
This brings us to the conclusion that the tangent of an acute ngle is equal to the cotangent of its complement.
I.e.
cot 30Â° = tan 60Â° and tan 10Â° = cot 80Â°; also sec 10Â° = cosec 80 Â° NOUN 31MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Now go through these examples 1.
Find the value of 0 in the following (a) sec q = cosec 30Â° (b) sin 50 = ?
(c) cot 20Â° = tan q (d) sec 40Â° = cosec q Solution: (a) cosec 30Â° = sec (90 - q ) cosec 30Â° = sec (90 - 30Â°) = sec 60Â° (b) 1/sin 50Â° = cosec 50Â° (c) cot 20Â° = tan (90Â° - q ) =tan (90Â° - 20Â°) = tan 70Â° (d) sec 40Â° = cosec (90 - q ) = cosec(90 - 40Â°) = cosec 50Â° 2.
In the diagram, on the right find the folloiwing: (a) sec q (b) cosecq (c) cot q 15 (a) sec q = hypothenus = 1 = 17 adjacent cosq 15 (b) cosec q = 1 = hyhothenus = 17 sinq opposite 15 (C) cot q = 1 = adjacent = 15 tanq opposite 8 Now move to the next step, the relationship between trigonometric ratios of other angles.
It has been established that: NOUN 32MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (1) the secant of any angle is the reciprocal of the cosine of the angle i.e.
sec q = 1/cos q (2) cosec q = 1/sin q and (3) cotan q = 1/tan q It then means that whatever applies to the trigonometric ratios their reciprocals, so the following are true in the first quadrant i.e.
; O Â° < q < 90Â° (acute) all the reciprocals trigonometric ratios are positive.
Sec q -> cosec q and cotan q In the second quadrant 90 q < < 180 (obtuse) since only the sine is positive only its reciprocal the cosecant will also be positive in the third and fourth quadrants respectively only the tangent and cotangent for 180 < q < 270 are positive and cosine and secant in 270 < 0 < 360 are positive respectively.
So the following relationships are established 1. sec q = cosec (90Â° - q ) cosec q = sec (90Â° - q ) tan q = cot (90Â° - q ) cot q = tan (90Â° - q ) 2. sec (180 - q ) is negative, q lies between 90Â° and 180Â° cosec (180 - q ) is positive cot (180 -q ) is negative.
3. sec (q - 180) is negative, q lies between 180Â° and 270Â° cosec (q - 180) is negative cot (q - 180) is positive 4. sec (360Â° - q ) is positive, q lies between 270Â° and 360 Â° cosec (360 -q ) is negative cotan (360 - q ) is negative having seen the relationships between the trigonometric ratios and their reciprocals, let us move on to find angles using the trigonometric tables.
3.2.1 USE OF TRIGONOMETRIC TABLES In the trigonometric tables for sine, cosine and tangent of angles can be used to find the values of their reciprocals.
In the four figure tables available only the tables for sine, cosine and tangent are available so whatever obtains in their case also applies to their reciprocals.
NOUN 33MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY The exact values of the trigonometric ratios obtained using the unit circle may not be accurate due to measurement errors.
So to obtain the exact values of the trigonometric ratios, you use the four figure tables or calculators.
The tables to be used here are extract of the Natural sine and cosine of selected angles between 100 and 890 at the interval of 61 or 0.10 .

Example: Find the value of the following angles: (i) sin 20 .
60 (ii) cos 300 121 (iii) sin 700 481 (iv) cos 40.
70 Solutions: (I) From the sine table to find sin 20 .
60 look at the left hand column marked x get to the number 20 and move across to 0.
6 on the top now their intense gives 0.3518 .'.
sin 20.60 =0.3518 (II) For cos (300 121), go to the natural cosine table look for 300 along the first column (x0) , either and move across unit 1 you fet to 121.
The value at this intersection is 0.8643.
\ cos (300 121) = 0.8643.
(III) Sin (700 481) = 0.9444 (iv) Cos (40 .
70) = 0.7581 A times, there might have problems involving minutes or degrees other than the one given in the table.
You have to use the difference table when such is the case.
for example Find (1) sin (200.
151) (II) cos (500 171) Solutions: (i) From the sine table (WAEC) sin (20 12) = 0.3453 plus the difference for 3 = 8 (from the difference column at the extreme right of the sine table) \ sin (20 151 ) = 0.3461 Alternatively you can look for sin (20Â° 181) and then subtract the difference of 31 thus Sin (20Â° 181) = 0.3469 Is the difference for 31 = -8 NOUN 35MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Sin (200 151) 0.3461 You see that either way the value of sin (20Â° 151) is 0.
3461 Note that the values of then (20Â° 151)is the same in the two methods above but in most cases, the values are not there are slight differences at times.
(ii) From the cosine table cos (50Â° 171) is nearer cos 50 18 cos (50Â° 18) = 0.
6388 plus the diff.
Forte= +2 0.6390 \ cos (500 171) = 0.6390 OR cos (50Â° 121) = 0.
6401 minus the diff.
For 51 = -12 cos (50Â° 171) = 0.
6389 Observe that the difference was added to the first method is cos 50Â° 181 and subtracted from the second method i.e.
cos 50Â° 121 .
This is because the angle increases, the value reduces in cosine.
You can have a critical look at the tables for cosine.
It is good to note that the values of sine increases form O to 1 while the values of cosine decreases from 1 to O.
The same methods as used in finding the tangent of angles from their tangents tables.
For angles greater than 90Â°, the same tables are used in finding their trigonometric ratios but firstly, you de4termine the quadrant and sign of the angle and treat accordingly.
Examples: Find (1) sin 120Â° (2) sin ( - 30)Â° (3) cos ( - 10Â° ) (4) cos 260Â° Solutions: (1) Sin 120Â° is in the second quadrant and sine is positive = sin (180 - 1200 = sin 60Â° and since sin 60 is positive, from the sine table.
Sin 120Â° = + sin 60Â° = 0.8660 (2) Sin (-30Â°) is in the fourth quadrant, where the sine is negative.
NOUN 36MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY \ ( - 30Â°) = - sine (360 - 30) = - sin 330Â° = - sin 30Â° from the sine table sin 30Â° = 0.5000 \ - sin 300 _ - 0.5000 (3) Cos (- 10) lies in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive.
\ cos ( -10) = cos (360 - 10)= cos 350Â° = cos 10Â° \ cos ( -10) the cosine table is 0.9848 \ cos (- 10) = 0.9848 (4) Cos (260Â°) is in the 3rd quadrant where cosine is negative = cos (260 - 180Â°) = cos 80Â°.
From the cosine table cos 80 = 0.1736 and since cosine is negative in the 3rd quadrant cos 2600 = - cos 800 = - 0.1736 3.3.2 USE OF LOGARITHMS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS A times you might be faced with problems which require multiplication and direction in solving triangles.
Here the use of tables of trigonometric functions becomes time consuming and energy sapping.
It is best at this stage to use the tables of the logarithms of trigonometric functions directly.
Examples: Find (1) log cos 20Â° 61.
Solution: The use of the tables of cosine will allow you to (1) find cos 20Â° 61 from the table .
(ii) find this value from the common logarithm table i.e.
cos .
(20Â° 61.)
= 0.9391 (from Natural cosine) Then log 0.9391 =Ä«.9727 (from common logarithm) But using the logarithm table of cosine go straight and find log 20Â° 61.
\ log cos (20Â° 61) = Ä« .
9727 Here you can see that applying the log cos table is easier and faster.
(ii) Log sin (24Â° 131 ) Log sin (24Â° 131 ) = Ä«.
6127, Plus difference for 11 = + 0.0002 (cot from the difference table at the right hand extreme column) \ log sin 24Â° 131 = Ä« .
6029 (iii) log tan 40Â° 171 from the log tangent table; NOUN 37MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY log tan 40Â° 171= Ä«.
9269 plus the diff.
For 51 = + 8 log tan 40Â° 171= Ä«.
9277 Alternatively, you can look for the logarithm: log tan 40Â° 181 = Ä« .
9 284 minus the deff.
for 11 = - 2 log tan 40Â° 181 = Ä«.
9282 The two results in this case are not the same.
The second result is preferable because the smaller the difference the more accurate the value of the angle being sort for.
If the angles are in radius convert to degrees.

You should hive also learnt that the value of any angle depends on the basic angle and its sign depends on the quadrant in which it is found.
However, you need be aware that the most commonly used trigonometric ratios are the sine cosine and tangent and the basic angle 0 lies between OÂ° and 360 i.e.
0 < 0 < 360.

1.0 INTRODUCTION Very often you see relations like y = sin q R is possible to find the value of y, if q is known.
On the other hand the need might arise to find the value of q when y is known.
What do you think can be done in this case?
In the example above i.e.
y = sin q , sine is a function of an angle and also the angle is a function of sine.
In this unit, you shall learn the inverse trigonometric functions, sometimes called circular functions, the basic relation of the principal value and trigonometric ratios of special angles 0Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 900 , 180Â°, 270Â° and 3600 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of the units you should be able to: - define inverse trigonometric functions - find accurately the inverse trigonometric functions of given values.
- Determine without tables or calculators the trigonometric ratios of 0Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 90Â°, 180Â°, 270 Â° and 360Â°.
- Solve problems involving inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric ratios of special angles correctly.
3.1 INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS (CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS) 3.1.1.
DEFINITION AND NOTATION The trigonometric ratios of angle are usually expressed as y = sin q (where y and q represents any value and angle respectively).
Or y = cos q NOUN 42MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Or y = tan q .
The above are example when the values of q is known.
When the value of q is unknown and y is known the above relations can be expressed as: q = (Sin-1 y) written as arc sin y read as ark sin y or q = (Cos-1 y), written as arc cosy read as ark cos y or 0 = (Tan-1 y) written as arc tan y read as arktany Note capital letters are used for the first letters of the trig.
ratios.
These relations arcsin, arccos and arctan are called the inverse trigonometric functions or circular functions.
Thus, in the above examples, 0 is called the inverse sine or inverse cosine or inverse tangent of y.
Example: (a) if sin q = 0.4576, then q = sin-1(o.4576), meaning that q is the angle whose sine is 0.4576 or the sine of q is 0.4576 (b) if cos q = 0.8594,at then q = cos-1(0.8954), which implies that q is the angle whose cosine is 0.8594 or cosine of q = 0.8954.
(c) if tan q = 2.
1203, then tan-1 (2.
1203) shows that q is the angle whose tangent is 2.1203 or the tangent of q is 2.1203.
PROCEDURES FOR FINDING INVERSE TRIGONOMETREIC FUNCTIONS Having been conversant with the use of the trigonometric tables, the task here becomes easy.
In finding the inverse trigonometric ratio of any angle, first look for the given value on the body of the stated trigonometric table and, read off the angle and minute under which it appeared.
If the exact value is not found, the method of interpolation(i.e.
finding the value closest to it and finding the difference between this closest value and the original value, then, look for the difference under the minutes in the difference column) can be adopted.
Example 1 Find the value of the following angles (a) sin-1 (0.1780) (b) cos-1 (0.2588) (c) tan-1 (1.1777) NOUN 43MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY this question can also be stated thus: Find y if; (a) siny = 0.1780 (b) cosy= 0.2588 (C) tan y = 1.1777 Solutions: 1(a) From the sine table (Natural sine table) through the body the value 0.1780 (or a value close to it) is located.
The value is 0.1771 found under 10Â° 12'.
The difference between 0.1780 and 0.17711 is 9.
This is found under 3 in the difference column.
So in tabular form .. 0.1771 = 10Â° 121 plus difference fog -9 = + 31 0.1780 = 100 15' \ the angle whose sine is 0.1780 is 10Â° 151 Alternatively 0.1788 can be located under 10 18 and difference between 0.1788 and 0.1780 is 8 but 8 cannot be found in the difference column so choose the number nearest to 8 i.e.
9 found under 31 \ 0.1788= 10Â° 181 plus difference for 9 = + 3 1 0.1779 = 10Â° 151 .'.
the angle whose sine is approximately equal to 0.1780 (0.1779) i.e 10Â° 151 q = 10Â° 151 b) Cos q = 0.2588 from the cosine table, the value 0.2588 is found under 75Â° 01 the angle whose cosine is 0.2588 is 75Â° .. q = 75Â° c) tan q =1.
1777, from the natural tangent table the value closest to 1.1777 is 1.1750 found under 49Â° 361 .
The difference between the two values is 27 which is found under 41 .. 0.1750 = 49Â° 361 plus the difference for 27 = + 41 0.1777 = 49Â° 401 In the above examples all angles are acute angles.
The inverse trigonometric functions can be extended to any angle.
3.1.2 INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF ANY ANGLE.
NOUN 44MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY The inverse trigonometric functions here are extended to include values of given angles between 0Â° and 360Â° and beyond Example 2: Find the value of 0 between 0Â° and 360Â° in the following: (a) sin q = 0.8964 (b) cos q = - 0.6792 (c) tan q = 0.2886 Solutions: (a) sin q = 0.8964 =:> q = sin-'(0.8964) .'.
q = 63Â° 411 ; Since sin q is positive then the angle must either be in the 1st or 2nd quadrant thus Fig 3.10 In the first quadrant q = 63o 411 and in the 2nd quadrant q = 180 â€“ 63o 411 = 116o 191.
(b) Cos q = 0.6792 From the cosine tables q = cos -1 0.6792 = 47o 101 but cosine q is negative, therefore q lies either in the 2nd or 3rd quadrant.
NOUN 45MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig : 3.11 In the 2nd `quadrant q = 180 - 470 10 = 132 Â° 50~ In the 3rd quadrant q = 180 + 47Â° 101= 2270 101 (c) tan q = - 0.2886, here q = 160 6` but since tan q is negative, q lies either in the 2nd or 4th quadrants.
Fig : 3.12 In the 2nd quadrant q = 180 - 16Â° 61= 1630 541 in the 4th quadrant q = 360 - 16Â° 61 q = 343Â° 541 Note from the previous units there are several values of q with the same value but in different quadrants.
For example sin 30Â° = sin 150Â° = sin 390Â° = sin 750Â° etc, hence the inverse trigonometric functions are many valued NOUN 46MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY expressions.
This mean that one value of q is related to an infinite number of values of the function.
Hence to obtain all possible angles q of a given trigonometric ratio either add or subtract (360Â° K ) where K is any integer- positive, negative or zero Example 3 Find all possible angles of 0 in example 2(a), (b) and (c) above.
(a) given sin q = 0.8964 and q = 63Â° 411 and q = 116Â° 191 These two VALUES OF q ARE THE BASIC ANGLES \ ALL POSSIBLE ANGLES OF q ARE 630 411 Â± (3 60kÂ°), where k = â€¦-1,0,+1,+2,+3â€¦.. and 116Â° 191 Â± (360kÂ°), where k = k = -1,0,1,2,3â€¦â€¦ (b) given cos q = - 0.6792 and q was found to be 132Â° 50' and 227Â° 10' these are the basic angles, So all possible angles of q , therefore are 132Â° 50' Â± (360k)Â° for k = .
.
., - - 1,0,1,2,... (c) Given tan q = - 0.2886, q equals 163Â° 54' and 343Â° 54' Here all possible angles of 0 are 1630 54' Â± (360kÂ°) and 243Â° 54' Â± (360kÂ°) for k = ..., -1,0,1,2, ...
Hence to find all possible angles of given angle: (1) find the basic angles of the given value (ii) add or subtract (360kÂ°) where k is either a positive negative or zero integer.
3.1.3 PRINCIPAL VALUES OF INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS.
In this section, attention should be found on the value which lies in a specified range for example: (i) for sin-' y, the range of values are -p /2 (-90Â°) to p /2 (-90Â°).
This value is called the principal value of the inverse of sine denoted by sin-ly (smalls).
For example if sin -1 1/(cid:214) 2 = 45Â° or p /4 radians then the principal value of the inverse of sin 1/(cid:214) 2 is sin-1 1/(cid:214) 2 = 45Â° or p /4 (since it is within the range).
NOUN 47MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (ii) If y = cos q , then q = cos-1 y, is the inverse cosine of y. and the principal value of the inverse of cosine is the value of q in the range 0Â° to p (180Â°).
This is the same for arc cot q , and arc sec q Example, if cos-1 1/(cid:214) 2= 45Â°, then arc sec q the principal value Cos-1(- 1/(cid:214) 2) = -p /4(-45Â°) the principal value is cos-1/(cid:214) 2) = -p /4(135Â°) (iii) The principal value of the inverse of tangent is the value of q in the range -p /2 (- 90Â°) to +p /2 (- 90Â°).
This is the same for arc cosec q .
Example of principal values The principal value of; (a) Tan-1(-1) = -p /4 = (45Â°).
(b) Cot-1(cid:214) 3= p /6 (30Â°) (c) Sec-1(-2) = 2/3p (120Â°) The relationship between the values of an inverse function and its principal value is given by the formulae below (Vygodsky 1972: 366).
(i) Arc sin x = k p + (-1)k arc sin x (ii) Arc cos x = 2kp Â± arc cos x (iii) Arc tan x = kp + arc tan x (iv) Arc cot x = kp + arc cot x, where k is any integer positive, negative or zero.
Hence Arc sin, Arc cos, Arc tan denotes arbitary values of inverse trigonometric functions and arcsin, arcos, arctan denotes principal values of given angles.
Example: (a) Arc sinÂ½ = kp + (-1)k arc sin Â½ = kp + (-1)k x p /6 or k(180Â°) + (-1) k 30Â° fork= 0, Arcsin Â½ = 0 x p + (-1)Â° p /6 = p /6(30)Â° k=1, = Arcsin 1/2 = l x p + (-I)' p /6 = p - p /6 = 5p /6 (150Â°) k=2, = Arcsin 1/2 = 2 x p + (-I)2 p /6 = 2p + p /6 = 13p /66 (390Â°) k=3, = Arcsin 1/2 = 3 x p + (-I)3 p /6 = p 3+ p /6 = 17p /6 (510Â°) k=-1, = Arcsin 1/2 = -1 x p + (-I)-' p /6 = - p - p /6 = -7p /6 (-210Â°) Note the angles in radians can be converted to degrees (see angles in brackets) Exercise 3.1 NOUN 48MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (1) write down the values of (a) sin-'(- 1/2) (b) cos-'(-1) (c) tan-'(-1) Ans: (a)-211110Â°, 330Â° (b) 180Â° (c) 135Â°, 315Â° (2) Use tables to evaluate: (a) tan-' 2 (b) cos-1 (1/4) (c) sin-' (3/5) Ans: (a) 63Â° 26' (b) 88Â° 26' (c) 36Â° 26' (3) Find the value of the following angles: (a) sin-1(0.7509) (b) cos-1 (0.9219) (c) tan-' (2.574) Ans: (a) 48Â° 40' (b) 212Â° 48' (c) 68Â° 46' 4.

Find the value of Arc cot(cid:214) 3 Ans: Arc cot(cid:214) 3 = k p +arc cot(cid:214) 3 where k is any integer = k p + p /6 for k = 0, Arc cot(cid:214) 3 = p /6 = 30Â° (angles in radians) k = 1, Arc cot(cid:214) 3 =p + p /6= 6 =210Â° k = -l, Arc cot(cid:214) 3 = p + p /6 = -5p /6 = -150Â° etc.
3.2 TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS OF COMMON ANGLES The angles 0Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 90Â° are called common angles because they are frequently used in mathematics and mechanics in physics.
Although the trigonometric ratios of common angles 0Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 90Â°, (and multiples of 90Â° up to 360Â° ) can be found from the trigonometric tables, they can be easily determined and are widely used in trigonometric problems.
3.2.l.
THE ANGLE OF 30Â° AND 60Â° Consider an equilateral triangle ABC of sides 2cm.
An altitude AD (see fig; 3.2) A NOUN 49MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig: 3.2 An altitude AD (see fig 3.2) Bisects < BAC so that < BAD = < CAD = 30Â° < ABC = < ACB = 60Â° by Pythagoras theorem AD = (cid:214) 3 units.
Hence, the value of the trigonometric ratios of 60Â° and 30Â° are Sin 60Â°= (cid:214) 3/2 and sin 30Â° = 1/2 Cos 60Â° = 1/2 and cos 30Â° = (cid:214) 3/2 Tan 60Â° =(cid:214) 3 and tan 30Â° = I(cid:214) 3 Cot 60Â° = 1/(cid:214) 3 and cot 30Â° (cid:214) 3 Sec 60Â° = 2 and see 30o =-2/(cid:214) 3 Cosec 60Â° = 2/(cid:214) 3 and cosec 30Â° = 2 3.2.2.
THE ANGLE 45Â° Consider a right-angled isosceles triangle ABC with AB= BC = 1 unit, <B=90Â° and<A=<C=45Â° AC = (cid:214) 2 units (Pythagoras theorem) NOUN 50MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Fig 3.21 Hence the trigonometric ratios of 45Â° are sin 45Â° = 1(cid:214) 2 Cos 45Â° = 1/(cid:214) 2 Tan 45Â° = 1 Cot 45' = 1 Sec 45Â°=(cid:214) 2 Cosec 45Â° = (cid:214) 2 3.2.3.
ANGLES 0Â° AND 90Â° It is difficult in practical problems to find angles 0Â° and 90Â° in a right - angled triangle as acute angles but with extended trigonometric functions, these angles are considered.
(see fig 3.22 below) Using a unit circle let P (x, y) be any point on the circle.
If q P, is rotated 1 about 0 in the anti clockwise direction through an acute angle q , then q A is the projection of q P, on the X - axis and q B is the projection of q P, on the Y- axis NOUN 51MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY In âˆ†Pq A I Sin q = P A but P 0 = 1 unit (unit radius) 1 1 P 0 1 \ Sin q = P A = y coordinate of P 1 1 = projection of OP, on the Y-axis cosq = OA = OA= OA but OA = BP 1 OP 1 1 .. cos q = BP = x coordinate of P 1 1 = projection of 0 P on the X-axis 1 Thus if P is any point on a circle with center 0 and unit radius and OP makes an angle with the X-axis, then the sine and cosine of any angle may be defined thus: Sin q = y coordinate or the projection of OP on the y-axis and cos q , x coordinate or the projection of OP on the x-axis Thus for angles 0Â° and 90Â° Sin 90Â° = y coordinate = 1 cos 90Â° = x coordinate = 0 (90Â° has no projection on the x axis) tan 90Â° = sin 90 0 = 1 = Î± (infinity) cos900 0 Fig: 3.2.3 Similarly for 0Â° Sin 0Â° = y coordinate = 0(0Â° has no projection on y-aixs) cos 0Â° = x coordinate NOUN 52MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY = 1 (0Â° lies on the x-axis tan 0Â° = sin 0 0 = 0 cos0Â° 1 = 0 Alternatively; In a right-angled triangle ABC, with < A = 90Â° and < C = q which is very small Fig: 3.2.4.
The ratios of q are: Sin q = AB BC Cosq = AC BC tan q = AB AC also sin Î² = AC BC tan Î² = AC AB When q gets smaller and smaller, R becomes larger and larger, these are expressed thus as q tends to O i.e.
q ---- 0 Î² tends to 90Â° i.e.
Î²---- 90Â° B-->A and BC-->AC as AB--> 0 Sin 0Â°=AB --> 0 = 0 = 0 BC AC AC Cos 0Â° = AC -> AC =1 BC AC Tan 0Â°= AB -> 0 = 0 AC AC Sin 90Â° = AB --> AC = 1 AC AC Cos 90Â° = AB 0 = 0 BC AC Tan 90Â° = AC -> AC NOUN 53MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY AB 0 Or since 0Â° and 90Â° are complementary angles then Sin q = cos (90 - 0) = cos 90Â° =0 Cos 0Â° = sin (90 -0) = sin 90' = 1 Tan 900 = sin 90 = 1 = Î± cos 90 0 Here is the summary of the common trigonometric ratios.

Graph of y = sin q (by projection) 3.1.
GRAPHS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS In drawing the graphs of trigonometric ratios, abscissa (x-axis) is taken as the independent variable and the ordinate (y-axis) as the dependent variable.
This is so because the values of arc dependent on the values of x.
The following explains this 3.1.
GRAPH OF y = sin q The graph of y = sin 0 will show the relationship between 0 and sin 0.
This graph can be drawn in two possible ways.
Method 1: from table values Steps: (a) assign different values to 0Â° at intervals of 30Â° to 360 Â° i.e.
0 = 0Â°, 30Â°, 60Â°, 90Â° ...,360Â° (b) find the corresponding values of sin 0 , this is used to from the table of values (c) choose a suitable scale then plot the values (d) join the plotted points with either the free hand or a broom stick to get a smooth curve.
This curve is then the graph of y = sin q .
Thus following the steps, the table of values approximated to 2 decimal places is.

Let 4cm represent 1 unit on the sin q axis i.e.
the vertical or y-axis.
The points arte then plotted on a graph sheet and is joined by a broom stick (see over leaf graph of y = sin q This means that the length from the height point on the graph to the x-axis is 1.
Method 2: Projection Steps: (a) Construct a unit circle and mark out correctly the angles of q = 0Â°, 30Â°, 60Â°, ... to 360Â° (see fig 4.2).
(b) Draw the x and y axis as in other graphs (c) Draw a horizontal line through the center of the circle to meet the x- axis.
(d) On the x-axis at 30o interval, mark out the angles 0o, 30Â°, 60Â°, .. to 360Â°.
(e) Draw dotted horizontal lines from the angles of sectors marked on the unit circle to meet the vertical lines from their corresponding values at the x-axis at a point.
(f) Join these points, then the graph of y = sin q is obtained see fig 4.2.
Properties of the graph of y = sin q 1.
The graph of y = sin q or the sine curve is a continuous function i.e.
it has no gaps between the values => no break 2.
The value of sin q increases from q at 0Â° to that 90Â° and then decreases to - 1 at 270 and back to 0Â° at 360Â°.
3.
The sine curve repeats itself at intervals of 360Â° [or comes to coincidence with itself upon a translation along the axis of abscissa(x- axis)by some amount].
It is called a period (or cycle) of the function.
In this or cycle is 360Â°.

In this case the values of cos q = sin (90 - q ).
The universally used method of plotting graph is the method by the use of table of values.
So the cosine curve will not be shown by the projection method here properties of the cosine curve.
NOUN 63MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 1.
The cosine curve is continuous 2.
The minimum value is continuous the minimum values i.e.
- 1.
So like the sine curve, it lies between -1 and 1.

The graph repeats itself at the interval of 360Â° and the function is also called a periodic function with periodical 360Â° 4.
The length of graph of y = cos q (amplitude) is 1.
Note the curves of the sine and cosines are identical because they have the same wavelength.
The differences are that: (1) The sine curve goes from 0 to 1 while the cosine curve goes from 1 to 0 and (2) Since cosq = sin (90 - q ), the difference between the curves is 90Â° 3.1.3 THE GRAPH OF y = tan q The graph of y = tan 0 is treated as in the case of the sine and cosine curves thus the table of values is shown in tables 3 Table 3: Table of values for y = tan 0, 00 <_ 0<_ 360Â° q 0o 30o 60o 90o 120o 150Â° 180o 210o 240o 270o 300o 330o 360o Tan q 0 0.58 1.73 Î± -1.73 -0.58 0 0.58 1.73 Î± -1.73 -0.58 0 Scale: Chose suitable scales: here the scales chosen are: 1 cm for I unit at the q -axis (x-axis) 2cm for 1 unit at the tan q axis (y-axis) the graph of y = tan q is shown in fig 4.3 below.
NOUN 64MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Properties of the graph of y = tan q 1.
The tangent curve is discontinues because tan q is not defined at 90Â° and 270Â° respectively i.e.
tan 90o = tan 270o = Î± 2.
The graph of y = tan q has 3 parts namely 0Â° -> 90Â°, 90Â° 2700, 3600 3.
The tangent curve indefinitely approaches the vertical lines at 90Â° and 270Â° but never touches them.
Such lines (at 90Â° and 270Â°) are called asymptotes(here the curve approaches straight line parallel to the y- axis and distance from it by Â± 90Â°, Â±270Â°, Â±450Â° etc.
but never reaches these straight lines.
Put in another form, the lines at 90Â° and 270Â° are said to be asymptotic curves.

APPLICATIONS OF GRAPHS OF TRIGONOMETRIC Functions: composite functions.
Example: (i) (a) Draw the graph of y = sin 20 for values of q between q and 360Â° (b) useyour graph to find the value of the following when q (ii) 25o (iii) 35o (iv) 50Â° Solution: (i) make a table of values thus for sin 2q Â° q 0o 30 o 45 o 60 o 90 o 120 o 135 o 150 o 180 o SIN 0 0.87 1.0 0.87 0 -0.87 -1 -0.87 0 2q Note when q = 30Â° sin 20 = sin (2x 30) = sin 60Â° = 0.87 etc.
(ii) Chose a suitable scale for clarity Here the scale of 1 cm to 30Â° on the 0 axis and 4 cm to 1 unit on the sin 20, axis since no value of sin 20 exceeded 1.
(iii) Plot the points.
Here use graph sheet for a clearer picture of the graph.
(a) the angles being sort for are then marked out on the q (x-axis) and a vertical line drawn from it to the graphs wherever it NOUN 68MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY touches the graph, draw a horizontal line to the y -axis (sin 2q ) axis then read off the values or its approximations (b) q = 25Â° means that sin 2q = sin 2 x25Â° = sin 50Â°.
Then 50Â° lies between 30Â° and 60Â° so its value will be between the values of 30Â°(0.5) and 60Â° (0.87).
This value is approximately 0.85 (see graph below) (c) q = 35Â° means that sin 20 = sin 2x 35Â° = sin 70Â° 70Â° lies between 60Â° and 90Â°.
So its value will be between the values of 60Â° and 90Â° i.e.

This also applies to cosine, secant and cosecant.
Amplitude is always a positive number.
4.0 CONCLUSION Having treated the graph of trigonometric functions and their reciprocals and also in this unit, you have seen that the treatment of graphs here are the same with the treatment of graphs of algebraic functions, the only difference is in the values assigned to the independent variable (x) which in this case are angles.
The processes are the same thus (1) table of values (2) choice of scales (3) plotting of the points and joining it is believed that the treatment of graphs of trigonometric functions, will enable you see the interrelatedness of function waves, motions etc.

For example; sin q = tan q ; 1 = cosec q cos q sin q NOUN 74MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY cos q = cot q ; 1 = sec q sin q cos q If these relations are true for any given value of q such relations are called trigonometric identities, provided the functions are defined.

Sin q = c -----> b sin c _____________ (1) b Cos q = a -------> b cos q = a ____________ (2) B NOUN 75MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY By Pythagoras theorem a2 + c2 = b2, so substituting the values of a and c from (1) and (2) we obtain; ( b cos q )2 + (b sin q )2 = b2, simplifying b2 COS2 q + b2 sin q = b2 , dividing through by b2, we have Sin2q +cos2q = 1 OR cos2q + sin2 = 1 Also Sin2q = 1 - cos2 q and Cos2 q = 1 â€“ sin2q Example: 1.
Without tables or calculators find (a) sin260Â° + cos2 60Â° (b) sin2330Â° + cos2330Â° Solution: (a) sin260o = (cid:214) 3/2 and cos260Â° = Â½ and substituting into sin260Â° + cos260Â°, gives; 2 (b) sin 330Â° = -sin 30Â° = -1/2 and cos 330Â° = cos 30 = (cid:214) 3/2 substituting into the given expression sin2 330Â° + cos2 330Â° to obtain; since this relation sin2q + cos2q =1, holds true for all values of q , it is then a trigonometric identity.
From the above trigonometric identity Sin2 + cos2 = 1, the following trigonometric identities can be deduced: Sin2 q + cos2 q =1 NOUN 76MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Divide through by cos q , this becomes Sin 2 q + cos 2 q = 1 Cos2q cos2q cos2q but sin 2 q = tan q and 1 = secq cos2q cos q sin 2 q + 1= 1 gives sinq 2 + 1 = Sec2q cos2q cos q cosq = Tan2q + 1 = sec2q = sec2q - 1 = tan2q Again, if we divide sin2q + cos2q = 1 by sin2q , it becomes Sin 2 q + cos q 1 sin2q sin2q sin2q , but cos q = cot q and 1 = cosec q sin q sin q 1 + cot2q = cosec2q Cosec2q - 1 = cot2q Other relations which can be deduced are (1) tan q x cot q = 1 (2) cos q x sec q = 1 (3) sin q x cosec q = 1 (4) 1- cos 2 q Note that 1 - cos2q = sin2q sin 2q 1- cos 2 q = sin 2 q sin2q sin2q NOUN 77MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY .'.

TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATIONS.
Trigonometric equation is an equation involving an unknown quantity under the sign of a trigonometric function.
Techniques for solving trigonometric equations.
: (1) take care to see that the transformed equation is equivalent to the original equation.
(8) reduce the given equation to an equation involving only one trigonometric ratio where involving only one trigonometric ratio where possible.
This is about the simplest way of solving a trigonometric equation, example 3+ 2 cos q = 4 sin2q , it is convenient to express this equation in terms of cos q since sin2q = 1 - cos i.e.
3+ 2 cos q = 4 (1- cos2q ) the solve the equation as a quadratic equation in one variable (cos2q ) (3) when the terms of the equation have been squared or you have performed some transformed that do not guarantee equivalence, check all the solutions to avoid less of roots.
Example: 1.
Solve the equation, giving values of q from 0 to 360 inclusive.
(a) 3 - 3 cos q = 2 sin2 q (b) cos2 q + sin q + 1 = 0 Solution (a) 3-3cosq = 2sin2 q , here the members of the equation can be expressed as cos q since sin q = 1 â€“ cos2 q \ 3 - 3cos q = 2(1 - cos2q ) = 3-3cosq = 2-2cos2q = 2cos2q - 3cos q +1 = 0.
NOUN 78MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY This is a quadratic equation in cos q and thus can be solved by any of the methods of quadratic equation.
By factorization 2cos q - 3cos q + 1 = 0 gives; (2 cosq - 1) (cos q - 1) = 0 either 2cosq - 1 = 0 OR cosq - 1 = if 2cosq - 1 = 0 =:> cos = Â½ and cos q is +ve \ q = cos-1 Â½ = 60Â° or 300Â° if cos q = 1, q = cos-1 1 = 0 or 360Â° \ the values of q which satisfy the equation within the given range of 0 < q < 360Â° are q = 0Â°.
60Â°, 300Â° and 360Â°.
(b) Cos2 q + sinq + 1 = 0 It is easier to transform Cos2 q to 1-sin q to form an equation of powers of a sin2q .
Thus; (1 - sin2 q ) + sin q + 1 = 0 1-sin2 q + sin q + 1 =0 =:> 1-sin2 q + sinq + 2 = 0 Factorizing: (sin q - 2)(sin q +l) = 0 .'.
either sinq -2 = 0 or sin q + 1 = 0 if sinq -2 =0 => sin q =2 and q = sin-1 2 This value of q does not satisfy the given equation because sinq lies between -1 and 1 to satisfy the given equation.
So q = sin -1 2 is not a solution if sin q + 1 = 0.
Sin = - 1 => q = sin-1(-1) = 270Â° \ q = 270Â° is the root of the equation becomes it falls within the range 0 < q < 360Â° 2.
Find all the solutions of the equation in the interval 0 < q < 360Â° 16cos2q + 2sin q = 13 Solution Cos2q = 1 sin2 q , this will be substituted into the equation to give; 16(1- sin2 q ) + 2sin q = 13 NOUN 79MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 16 â€“ 16 sin2 q +2sin q = 13 = 0 =:> 16sin2 q - 2sin q - 16 â€“ 13 = 0 => 16sin2 q -2sin - 3 = 0 Factorising gives (8sinq + 3)(2sin q - 1) =0 .'.
either 8sinq + 3 = 0 OR 2sinq - 1 = 0 so, if 8sin0 +3 = 0 =:> sinq = -3/8 q = sin-1(-3/8) = sin-1(-0.375) From the tables 0 = -22Â°.
This lies either in the third or fourth quadrant since sinq is negative \ q = 180 + 22Â° 2' or 360Â° - 22Â° 2' = 202Â° 2' or 337Â° - 58' if 2sinq = 1 = ===> sin q = Â½ =:> q = sin-1 ( Â½ ) .'.
q = 30Â° since sinq is positive, q is either in the first or second quadrant .'.
q = 30Â° or 180Â° - 30Â° = 30 Â° or 150Â° \ the solution of the equations for 0 < q < 360Â° is q = 30, 150Â°, 202Â° 21' and 337Â° 58' .

Find without table, the value of sec q , sinq if tan q = -5/12 Solution; Using a right angle triangle fix the sides of the triangle using the knowledge 5 12 Fig; 5.1 That tan q is Opposite.

x = (cid:214) 169= Â± 13 .'.
sin q = 5/Â±13 and cos q = Â±12/Â±3, but q is obtuse, hence sin q = 5/13 and cosq = -12/13 .'.
sin q = 5/13 and sec q = 1/cosq gives; sec q = -1 - -13 12 12 13 4.
Prove the following identities: sec2q + cosec2 q = sec q cosec2 q Solution: In problems of this sort, start from whatever expressions (either left hand side or right hand side) to show that it is equal to the other (right hand side or left hand side) whichever is simpler Thus starting from the left hand side (LHS) Sec2 q + cosec2 q = 1 + 1 Cos2q sin2q Simplifying gives sin 2 q + cos q Cos2q sin2q But sin2 q +cos2q = 1 \ sin 2 q + cos q = 1 Cos2q sin2q Cos2q sin2q = 1 + 1 Cos2q sin2q = sec2q x cosec2q = sec2q x cosec2q = RHS Note that in examples 1 and 2 we concentrated only on angles in the first revolution or basic angles.

In this unit, we shall discuss, the solution of triangles (all types of triangles) in which case finding all the angles and sides of a triangle when the following are known either; (1) 2 sides and an included or non included angle or angles and a side and (2) the three side or three angles are given .
Several methods are used in the solution of triangles but here, we shall consider two important ratios - the sine and cosine rules, which make use of the definitions of sine and cosine of an angle.
In providing solutions, the following are to be remembered (1) the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180Â° (2) the angles are in proportion to their sides, NOUN 95MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY these information help in the fixing of the shape of a triangle(the angle opposite the greater side is bigger than the angle opposite the smaller side).
The angles of elevation and depressions are defined and is used in the calculation of heights and distances in practical problems 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, the students should be able to: â€¢ derive the sine and cosine rules â€¢ apply the sine and cosine rules correctly to solutions of triangles â€¢ deduce the correct area of triangle using trigonometric ratios is Â½ a b Sin C or Â½ b c sin A or Â½ ac sin B â€¢ define angles of elevation and depression â€¢ apply trigonometric ratios to angles of elevation and depression in finding heights and distances.
3.1 SOLUTION OF TRIANGLES 3.1.1 SINE RULE So many of you must have used the sine rule without knowing its proof.
Here is a proof of the Sine Rule The Sine Rule is for any triangle (acute or obtuse angled).
Hence, Given any triangle ABC with the usual notations see fig 6.1 (a) and (b) below.
A C a Fig 6.1 (a) NOUN 96MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY B D Fig 6.1 (b) Fig 6.1 9a) is an acute angled triangle and fig.
6.1 (b) is an obtuse - angled triangle: Given; âˆ†ABC as shown in figs 6.1 (a and b) above Required to prove (R.T.P) ; a = b = c (sin rule) sin A sin B sin C Construction: Draw AD perpendicular to BC (fig 6.1 a) Or Draw AD perpendicular to BC produced (fig 6.1 b) Proof: in âˆ†ABD in fig 6.1a.
_________________ (1) Sin B = x/c, this means that C sin B = x _________________ (2) Also in âˆ†ADC in fig 6.1 a.
Sin C = x/b => b sin C = x, this means that in both (1) and (2) X = c sin B = b sin C and dividing both sides by Sin B Sin C gives.
c = b _______________ (3) sin C sin B In fig 6.1 b the obtuse angled triangle In âˆ†ADC Sin B = x/c => c sin B= x ________________(4) NOUN 97MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Sin (180 -C) = x but sin (180 - C) = sin C (the sin q of an obtuse B angle is equal to the sine of its supplement i.e.
both angles sum up to 180Â°) .'.
Sin C = x/b => b sin C = x ____________ (5) dividing both sides c Sin B = b Sin C = x by Sin B Sin C gives c = b sin C sin B So in both the acute and obtuse angled triangles the same results were obtained if the perpendicular is dropped from C to AB, it can also be proved that (you can try this) a = b = c sin A sin B sin C. This is the Sine Rule.
Here A is angle at A and a is the side opposite the angle at A, the same applies to B and b and C and c. Note that this sine rule can be written as sin A = sin B = sin C a b c The sine rule is used to solve a triangle when; (i) any two sides and any one side is given and (ii) any two sides and a non-included angle is given.
Example 1 1.
Solve the following triangles ABC which have; (a) < A = 25Â° 25', < B = 62Â° 51' and a = 3.
82cm.
(b) <A = 112Â° 2', a = 5.23 cm and b = 7.65cm (c) <C = 125Â° 43', a = 4.2cm and c = 8.2cm.
Solutions: Remember to make a sketch of the triangle putting into consideration the conditions.
(a) in âˆ† ABC, since two angles A and B and one side a is given we need to find < C and sides b and c.; NOUN 98MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY substituting the values of <A and <B into the equation gives; 25Â° 52' + 62Â° 15' + <C = 180 \ < C = 180 - (25Â° 52' +- 62Â° 15') =180 â€“ 88o 7' = 91o 53' \ < C 91Â° 53' Fig 6: 2.
To get the sides b and c using the sine rule a = b = c , any Sin A sin B sin C two of these equations can be used thus: 3.82 b sin(25Â°45') sin(62Â°15' ) = b sin 25Â° 52' = 3.82sin(62Â° 15') \ b = 3.82 sin(62Â°15') = 3.82 sin(62.25) sin 25Â°52' sin(25.87) You can use your calculator or logarithm tables here for easy calculations.
In the example calculations was used.
b = 3.380652755 = 7.75 cm 0.4363307212 .'.
b = 7.75 cm for c, any of the two equations can also be applied.
NOUN 99MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY a c sin A sin C 3.82 c sin 25.870 sin 91:88 = c sin 25 .
87Â° = 3.82 sin91:88Â° 3.82 sin 91Â° :88' ===> sin 25.87 3.817943802 C = 0.4363307212 C = 8.75cm \ < c =91.88Â°,b=7.75 cm and c=8.75cm.
Note this values are in agreement with the condition that "greater angles face greater sides.
(b) < A = 112Â° 2' and a = 5.23 cm and b = 7.65cm observe here that the side a = 5.23 facing angle A is smaller than the side b = 7.65cm and it is not possible to have a triangle with two obtuse angles, hence side should be greater than b and since this is not the case.
The triangle has be opposite the larger angle (try to solve this triangle, what did you observed?)
(c) <C = 125Â° 43Â°, a = 4.2 cm and c = 8.2cm.
Solution There is a possible solution here since < C which is larger has a side c greater than side a.

Required to Prove: c2 = a2 + b2 - 2a b cos C (cosine rule) Construction: Draw a perpendicular from A to B C (fig 6.3a) and from A to BC produced (fig 6.3b.)
Proof: in fig:6.3a in âˆ†ABC.
b2 = x2 + y2 (1) (Pythagoras theorem) in âˆ†ABC, c22 = (a -x)2 + y2,by simplification, c2 -a2-2ax+x2 +y2 but x2 + y2 = b2 in (1) substituting c2 = a2 - 2ax + b2 (2) In âˆ†ABC, cos C= x/b => b cos C = x NOUN 102MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY so substituting for x in (2) gives c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C .'.
C2 - a2 + b2 - 2abcos C Proof: in fig 6.3b.
(Obtuse angled triangle) In âˆ†ADC, b2 =X2+ y2 (ii) (Pythagoras theorem.)
In âˆ†ABD, C2 = (a+ x)2 + y2(Pythagoras theorem.)
Simplifying gives, c2 = a2 + 2ax +Y?
(2) But x2 + y2 = b2 (1) So substituting in (2) for b2 gives c2 = a2 +b2 + 2ax In âˆ†ADC, cos(180 - c) = x/b , but cos (I80 - C) Since < C is obtuse is - cos Ctherefore; -cos C = x/b ====> -bcosC = x So substituting for the value of x in (2) , you obtain: C2 = a2 + b2 + 2a ( - b cos C) C2 = a2 + b22 - 2ab cos C. This is the same result as for the acute angled triangle.
And this is the Cosine Rule: C2 = a2 + b22 - 2ab cos C Also by renaming the angles and /or re-drawing the perpendiculars the following cosine rules can also be proved (try it) a2 = b2 + c2 - 2ax cosA OR b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos B The cosine rule is applied in the solution of triangles when the following are given: (1) two sides and an included angle or (2) three sides.
NOUN 103MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Example: 2 1.
Solve triangle ABC, with; (a) A= 42Â°.
83Â°, b = 7.23 cm and C = 5.46cm.
(b) <B = 150 .3Â°, a = 8.91 cm and c = 5.26 cm.
(c) C = 4.05, a = 2.25cm and b = 6.24 cm Solution: Note always remember to make a sketch of the triangle, noting that the angles should represent its type (acute or obtuse) and the sides should be proportional.
Fig 6.4.
Since we are looking for the side a the cosine rule is to be used since b and c are given using: A2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos A and substituting b = 7.23 cm, C = 5.46cm and A = 42.83o which were given into the formula and simplifying gives: A2 = (7.23)2 + (5.46)2 - 2 (7.23)(5.46) cos 42.83 = 52.2729 + 29.8116 - (14.46)(5.46) (0.7334) = 52.2729 + 29.8116 - 57.9015 = 82.0845 - 57.9015 = 82.0845 - 57.9015 = 24.183 a2 = 24.183 a =(cid:214) 24.183 = 4.9176 .'.
a = 4.92cm NOUN 104MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Here the positive square root of a was taken because we are dealing with lengths.
To find the angles either use the sine or cosine rule whichever is easier for you (Now we try both rules) (a) using the sine rule Sin C = sin A this means that c a a sin C = c sin A and then sin C = c sin A a so substituting for the values of c = 5.46cm, A = 42.83Â° and a = 4.92 cm into the equation gives; sin C = 5.46 sin42.s3 = 0.754403732 4.92 .'.
<C = sin-1 (0.7544) = 48.98Â° = 49Â° (b) Using the cosine rule: C2=b2+a2 - 2abcosC From here, even one can make cos C the subject of the formula thus: COs C = a 2 +b 2 - C 2 2ab and substituting the values of a = 4.92cm, b = 7.23cm and c = 5.46cm, we obtain cos C = (4.92) + (7.23) - (56) 2(4.92)(7.23) = 24.2064 + 52.2729 - 29.8116 71.1432 cos C = 46.6677 = 0.6559685255 NOUN 105MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY 71.1432 .'.
<C = cos-1 0.6559685255 = 49.40687 = 49.01o So the two methods (a) and (b) gave the same value for but it is usually easier to sue the sine rule in finding the missing angles.
Then <^B = 180Â° - (<Ã¢ + <c) (sum <s of âˆ†) = 180 - (42.83 + 49.01) = 180 - 91.84 < ^B = 88.16Â°, therefore the missing parts are: a = 4.92cm, < ^B = 88.16Â° and < = 49.01o Fig: 6.4 Using the cosine rule b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos B and substituting values of: a=8.91cm, c=5.26cmand<^B into the formula, we obtain b2 = (8.91)2 + (5.26)2 - 2(8.91) (5.26) cos 150.

cos A = 0.9947293447 and < A = cos-1 (0.9947) = 5.88Â° again using cosine rule to obtain thus: Cos A b 2 + c â€“ a 2 substituting the values of a, b, c as above into the 2 formula gives 2bc Cos = (2.25) 2 + (6.24) 2 - (4.05) 2 2(2.25)(6.24) = 5.0625 + 38.9376 - 16.4025 28.08 \ cos C = 0.9828205128 so <C = cos-1 0.982828205128 <C = 10.64Â° By the knowledge of the angle sum of a triangle B is then calculated thus <A+<B+<c= 180 \ <B = 180 -< A - <C = 180 - 5.88 - 10.64<B = 163Â°.
48Â° Note from our earlier discussion on the proofs of the sine and cosine rules the quickest/easiest method used in the solution of triangles depends on the information given, which are summarized below: 1.
Given three sides of the triangle as in example 2(C) NOUN 108MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Cos A = b 2 + c 2 - a 2 2bc OR Cos B = a 2 + c 2 - b 2 2ac OR Cos C = a 2 +b 2 -c 2 2ab Can be used to find any of the two angles and the third angles is found, by the use of the sum of the interior angles of a triangle i.e.
<A+<B+<C=180Â° 2.
Given two angles and one side In example 1(a), two angles and one side is given, the sine rule is used here, to find the length of the sides thus: a = b sin A sin B because < C can easily be found by 180 - 62.25 -25.87 = 91 .88Â° or a = c to find the side C. sin A Sin C 3.
Given two sides and an included angle in this figure, NOUN 109MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY < B is given which lies between the two given sides a and c. The cosine rule is used a in example 2(a) above to find the side to b then the sine rule is used to find either < A or < C then the third angle can be found by the sum of angles of triangle theorem 4,.
Given two sides and a non - included angles that is the angle does not lies between the two given sides.
Two cases are treated here.
Case 1: When the given angle is acute two possible triangles can be drawn as follows: Fig6.6 If the side opposite the given angles B in this case is less than the other given angle C i.e.
b < c as in Fig 6.6. above.
This means that < C will have two values(acute and obtuse) Case II When the side opposite the given angle is greater as in Fig 6.7 below, only one triangle is possible (b > c and ^B is acute) Fig: 6.7 NOUN 110MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY In both cases the sine rule is used to find one of the angles and the side can be found by either the sine or cosine rule Example: Solve the triangle A BC with C = 10.46Â°, c = 2.25cm and a = 6.24cm.

So we can define the angle of elevation as the angle that lies between the observers eye level (horizontal plane) and the line of sight when the observer tries to see something above him/her.
Similarly, the angle of depression is the angle between the observer's eye level and the ground when the observer is above the ground see fig.

Fig: 6.10c.
From the above figures it can be easily seen that angle of elevation and angle of depression are alternate angles (two horizontal lines are ).
These two angles are frequently used in the application of trigonometric functions to triangles.

1.0 INTRODUCTION Very often people talk about finding their bearings.
Have you ever taken out time to find out what this means/ has it any relation with mathematics?
Why should one bother about his/her location?
The answer to these questions shall be provided in this unit many a time, when walking along the road or traveling by air or 'ship, the compass is displayed in front of the Geologists, Surveyors Pilots or Navigators or sailors.
This instrument makes them have a focus on their journey or gives sense of direction.
In this unit, the place of the cardinal point or compass in relation to the location of places shall be discussed.
This will form the basis of our solution to practical problems.
The bearing is a means of locating the angular inclination between two or more objects in different positions.
Note: In trigonometry (positive) angles are measured in the anticlockwise direction but in bearing, the angles are measured in the clockwise direction, that is from the first quadrant to the fourth quadrant to the third, the second and back to the first depending on the location of the object whose bearing is sought.
In the treatment of bearing, the following should be borne in mind.
NOUN 116MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (i) all measurement of angles start from the North pole (clockwise direction) previously the letter N or S comes before any angular measure but this is no longer conventional rather we now use the three digit number referred to as "true bearing" Example instead of N 30 E, we now write 030Â°.
This is for easy location of the quadrant where the place or object or point is.
(ii) Write the angle derivation starting from the north to the desired line 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to â€¢ explain clearly the term bearing â€¢ locate the bearing of given places â€¢ apply trigonometric ratios to problems involving bearings.
3.1 BEARING The compass has eight cardinal points namely, North (N), South (S), East(E), West(W),North East(NE), North West(NW), South East(SE) and South West(SW).
the diagram is in figure 7.1 below N NE W E SE S Fig 7.1 Using fig.
7.1 as an example the bearing of S from O (center) is obtained by measuring the angle from the North in the clockwise direction to the line joining O and S i.e to OSSO the bearing of S from O is 180Â° in this case (see arrow) NOUN 117MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Example In the diagram below find the following W Fig 7.2a.
P Fig 7.2b.
(a) the bearing of P from O (b) the bearing of A from O.
Solution: (a) the bearing of P from O is the angle OP makers with the North Pole measured in the clockwise sense so here it is 90 + 48 = 138Â° i.e.
the angle measured from North to the line OP in the clockwise direction.
(see fig 7.2b.)
(b) The bearing of A from O is 40Â° written as cardinal points, it is written N 40Â° E In which case the letter N will be written first and E or W after the angle.
In cardinal points the bearing of P from O might be written as S 42Â° E = 138Â°.
NOUN 118MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Note it is always better to use the three digit number (true bearing) for easy identification of the quadrant where the place or point is located.
2.
State the bearing of each of the following directions (a) N, (b) E (c) SE (d) S (e) W and (f) NW S Fig.
7.3 Solution: Since bearings are measured in the clockwise direction from the North the bearing are as follows: (a) N = 000Â° (it has no inclination) (b) E = 090Â° (90Â° from the North Pole) (c) SE = 90 + 45Â° = 135Â° (SE is half way between the fast and the South) (d) S = 180Â° (e) W = 270Â° (f) NW = 315Â° 9270Â° + 45Â°) again because NW is half way between the North and the West.

In the figure on below what is the bearing of E NOUN 119MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (a) A from O (b) B from O (c) C from O (d) O from A Solution (a) the bearing of,&from O is 057Â° (b) the bearing of B from O = 180Â° + 30 = 210Â° (c) the bearing from C from O = (270 + 49) = 319Â° (d) the bearing of O from A - this is got by first drawing a cardinal point at A see diagram below.
A now lies on the East - West line, the alternate angle is located N 237o W E N 57o W E S 55o Fig 7.4 Therefore the bearing of O from A is 180 + 57Â° = 237Â° (starting from the North pole at A to the line 0 A (see arrow above) Also finding the bearing of O from D , the same procedure is followed, hence the bearing of O from D = 270 + 55Â° = 325Â° NOUN 120MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY Exercise 7.1.
Now try this as an exercise.
In the figure below find the following: N V W E Z S (a) the bearing of X from O = 070 (b) the bearing of Y from O = 45o (c) the bearing of Z from O = 195o (d) the bearing of V from O = 195o (e) the bearing of O from X = 2500 (f) the bearing of O from Y = 3250o (g) the bearing of O from Z = 015o (h) the bearing of O from V.= 100o The answers to the above exercise are written in red to serve as a check on your progress.
Now substituting the values a = 15km because it is facing angle A, B = 12km and C = 9km or b = 9km and c = 12km, the most important side has been determined and that is the side facing the angle A .'.

sin Z = 15, but A = 90Â° from (b) sinZ= l2sin90 = 12 = 0.8 15 15 Z = sin-1 (0.8) = 53.13Â°, Then the bearing of X from Z (see diagram) Remember the angle at Z should be 90 - 30Â° - 53, 13Â° = 6.87Â° (see diagram) Practical Example On Bearing 1.

NOUN 123MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY (b) A repeat of the diagram is made here, Let the < X Y Z in âˆ† X Y Z be denoted by A and since the three sides of the triangle are known, the cosine formula is used - a2 = b2+c2 - 2bccosA \ cos A = b 2 +c 2 - a 2 2bc \ X = 20sin30 sin 105 20 x 0.5 = 10.3528km 0.9659 \ x = 10.4km (3 sig figs).

4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, we have proved the two most important relations in the solution of triangle.
These are the sine and cosine rules.
The formula for the area of a triangle and parallelogram were derived.
Also we saw the interrelations between the sine and cosine rules in solving triangles and the rules that must be observed before any solution would be possible.
The importance of trigonometry in solving problems on heights and distances were illustrated through the angles of elevations and depressions.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have learnt that to solve triangles the following information must be given before the application of the sine or cosine rules.
1.
(a) three sides or (b) two sides and an included sides or (c) two angles and a side or (d) two sides and a non - included angle In the case of (d) care should be taken to find the possible triangles that might be formed when the given angle is acute.
2.
When the side opposite a bigger angle is less than the other side there will be no solution, 3.
The angle of elevation is formed when you look up to see an object and the angle of depression when you look down to view an object.
4. the area of triangle and parallelogram were found using trigonometric ratios.
5. sine rule states that: a = b = c sin A sin B sin C NOUN 129MTH 133 TRIGONOMETRY where a, b, c, are the sides of a triangle and A, B, C its angles.
This rule can also be written as: sin A = sin B = sin C a b c 6.
Cosine rule states that: a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc Cos A b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac Cos B (only one of these is used at a time ).
c2 = a2 + b2 -2ab Cos C It can also be stated as: Cos A = b 2 + c 2 - a 2 2bc Cos B = a 2 + c 2 - b 2 2ac Cos C = a 2 + b 2 - c 2 2ab With these, you can feel relaxed and enjoy this all-important unit 6.0 TUTOR â€“MARKED 1.
