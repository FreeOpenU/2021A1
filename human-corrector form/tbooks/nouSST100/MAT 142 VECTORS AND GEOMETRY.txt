Introduction You are going to be introduced to a new way of representing quantities.
In this case they have both magnitude and directions unlike other quantities.
Having seen the picture of what a vector is, you will then discuss its representation.
The study of Vectors greatly simplifies the study of mechanics.
2.0.
Objectives At the end of this Unit you should be able to: - - State the difference between vectors and scalar.
- Represent vectors.
3.0.
Scalar and Vectors.
You must be aware of the units of measurements for mass, temperature, density and others.
You don't need to specify your temperature towards the North or East.
It is just 98.4°F for a normal body.
These types of quantities are referred to as Scalar quantity.
NOUN 12MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 3.1.1 Definition of Scalar A Scalar is that quantity which possesses only magnitude Example 1: Apart from mass, temperature and density mentioned above, other examples of Scalar are energy, speed, length and time.
3.1.2.
Displacement Example 2: Consider your movement from your house to the study center, all you need to give is the distance.
But in corning to the center you must have passed through many routes involving turning from one direction to another.
If you `turn' through two different corners, with the same magnitude of distance, you should be able to differentiate them by the different directions (routes) you have to turn.
In this situation, you will say your displacement is xkm in the direction 6° which is quite different from displacement of xkm in the direction a° if a≠ Ө because it is a vector quantity.
Example 3: Also imagine a car travelling at a regular `speed' of 60km/h round a circular track as in figure V1, the direction of PI is different from PZ or P3 or P4, that is, at every turn its `velocity' changes because it is a vector quantity.
Fig.
VI 3.1.3.
Definition of Vectors A vector quantity is that which has both magnitude as well as direction.
NOUN 13MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Example 4: Vector quantities are force, momentum, velocity, acceleration, displacement, and electric field.
Exercise 1: i.
Which of these is a vector?
(a) Speed (b) Distance (c) Length (d) Force (e) Mass.
ii.
Which of these is a scalar?
(a) Force (b) Velocity(c) Distance (d) Displacement (e) Weight.
Solution (1) (d) force (ii) Distance.
3.2.
Representations of Vectors.
3.2.1 Vector Specification A directed line segment represents vector quantities with an arrowhead showing its direction V2.
You can use capital letter AB with an arrow to denote the line segment.
` You refer to A as the initial point or origin and B as its terminal point.
You denote BA as - AB to differentiate between the two directions; you could also represent vectors by small letters with a curl under them or bold e.g.
u or v NOUN 14MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY You could also use angles (Bearing) measured from the North in a clockwise direction to represent the direction and a scale drawing of a line segment to represent the magnitude.
Example 5: Draw a Vector a of magnitude 3 cm and direction 210°.
Solution: See figure V3.
210ْ Fig.
V3 3.2.2.
Vector Routes from the Origin.
Since you have been told that vector must originate from a point, you will now choose a specific origin (0, 0) on the coordinate axis.
There, a unit movement on the x - axis is denoted i and on the y - axis j.
A unit vector is a vector whose magnitude is one.
If the terminal point of your vector is at point (3, 4) while the initial point is on the origin (0, 0) then you can represent your vector u = 3i + 4j as simple as a column vector (34).
Fig.
V4.

V4 Exercise 2 Represent the given velocity by vectors, using a convenient scale.
(a) 120km/h in the direction 150° Solution Scale: 1 cm represents 30km/h.
Length of line representing The vector is 120 = 4cm 30 v 4cm Fig.
V5 In figure V5, v is the required velocity.
Example 6.
Represent the following Vectors on the rectangular axis.
(a) 5i – 4j (b) 4i + 5j (c) (-3, -5) Solution: See figure V6 (on graph sheet), NOUN 16MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Fig.
V6 4.0.
Conclusion You are now ready to work with vectors in the next unit, since you can now represent it.
You must remember to put the arrows on the vectors to show the direction.
You should also put a curl (~) under any letter used to represent a vector.
Draw vectors on graphs as ordered pair of points on the x - y plane.
5.0.
Summary In this unit you have been introduced to vectors and scalar, and you learnt that: - Scalar are quantities with only magnitude like speed or mass.
NOUN 17MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY - Vectors are quantities that must be specified with both magnitude as well as directions e.g.
velocity and weight.
- You can represent vectors by directed line segment AB or BA, u or ordered pairs of point (x, y) on the coordinate and this is denoted xi + yj i and j are unit vectors in the direction of x and y - axis respectively.

References and other Resources 1.0 INTRODUCTION It is very important to define terms in mathematics.
As a language of science the major concepts involves using terms correctly.
This is why you must learn to use the definitions in this unit in other units in this course.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit you should be able to: - Define equal vectors, Negative vectors, and Null vectors - Recognize how scalar multiples of vectors give the definitions of Null vectors, parallel vectors and negative vectors.
3.1.1.
Equal Vectors: You will say two vectors u and v are equal if they have the same magnitude and directions, regardless of the position of the vectors.
NOUN 19MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY In figure V 1, AB = CD B D A C Fig.
VI 3.1.2.
Negative Vectors: If you have a vector with opposite direction to another vector a, but having the same magnitude, you denote it –a 3.1.3 The difference of vectors The difference of two vectors u and v, you denote as u-v, and it is the sum of u+ (-v).
That is, the sum of the vector u, and the (additive inverse of vector v) negative vector v. 3.2.1 Null vectors In a particular case of u+ (-v), if u=v then their difference will give you the null vector or zero vector i.e.
u-u=0.
Note that the zero vector exists in this case.
As it could mean a movement from A to B, and back to A from B; then the resultant will be zero.
Generally, you could then have Null vector or a Proper vector.
NOUN 20MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 3.2.2 Scalar multiples of vectors The Scalar product of u denoted mu where m is a scalar, is a vector having the same direction, but is multiplied by its magnitude.
You should note that if m is 0, you have a null vector, if m > 0; you have a parallel vector u and if m < 0, and if m = l, then you have a negative vector u, (- u).
Example 1: Forces f , f , f , f , f ; acted on a body, find the force needed to prevent the 1 2 3 4 5 body from moving.
Fig.
V3 Solution: The force needed to prevent the body Q from moving is the negative resultant -R = (F, + F + F + F + F ) which when added R + (-R) gives the 2 3 4 5 zero vector 0.
So you will have -R = - (F, + F + F + F + F ).
2 3 4 5 Exercise 1 Two vectors u and v have the following lengths and directions: u with length 2cm and direction 180°, and v with length 3cm and direction 030°.
Construct accurate diagrams to show: (i) u (ii)-u (iii) v (iv) -2v NOUN 21MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Fig V4 (ii) -u = 2cm direction 000° (iv) -2v = cm direction 2 10° 3.0 Conclusion Vectors, although being specified by both magnitude and direction, still posses certain properties like any other number in the number system.
In order to appreciate these properties you need to be able to define certain terms in vector algebra.
Each of this special vectors will come in very useful in further studies of vector algebra.
4.0 Summary You have learnt in this unit, the following definitions: 1.
Equal vectors - Vectors with same magnitude and directions.
2.
Negative vectors - Vectors with the same magnitude, but in opposite directions.
3.
Difference of vectors - The sum of a vector and the negative of another vector, u+(-v).
4.
Null vectors - The sum of a vector and it's negative, u+(-u)= 0.
5.
Scalar multiples, mu, of vector u, where m is scalar - It is a vector with the same direction (except where m<0), but having a scalar multiple of its magnitude.
NOUN 22MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 6.
In scalar multiple, mu, of u - If m=0, you have a null vector; If m>0, you have parallel vector to u; and if m<0, and I m 1=1, then you have a negative vector -u.
5.0 Tutor marked – Assignment If u is a vector of length 4cm in the direction 035°, v is a Vector of length 2cm in the direction 120° and w is a vector of length 3cm in the direction of 270°, draw an accurate diagram to show (i) u (ii) v (iii) w (iv) -3v, -5/3w 6.0 References and other Resources Murray R.

Introduction.
The operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication formula in the algebra of numbers of scalars are, with suitable definition, capable of extension to algebra of vectors.
In this Unit you will be learning about these and the laws of vector Algebra.
2.0.
Objectives At the end of this Unit you will: - Draw accurate diagrams to show the laws of vector algebra.
- Prove given statements using the triangle and parallelogram law of vector addition.
3.1.1 The Sum of or resultant of a Vector; Consider your movement from a point A to B to C, The total distance of your journey will be AB + BC And on a straight line A B C You could say the distance is AC NOUN 24MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 3.1.2 Triangle Law Similarly if a vector AB is followed by a vector BC with the initial point B of BC, the terminal point of vector AB, then the sum AB + BC is, a vector AC which will close the triangle ABC.
This is the triangle law; it gives the sum or resultant of two vectors.
Fig.
V6 3.1.3 The Parallelogram Law of Vector Addition.
Suppose the two vectors to be added up have the same initial point or origin, then their sum or resultant is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed, based on the two given vectors, where the three have the same initial point.
B D Fig.
V7 From figure V7, you can see that the parallelogram law is an extension of the triangle law.
Since AB + AD = AC for parallelogram law, but AB + BC = AC according to triangle law because BC = AD (opposite sides Of a parallelogram) you can extend these laws to three or more vectors, and the word displacement could be used for resultant.
Example I An automobile travels 6km in the direction 000, then l0km in the direction 045°.
Represent these displacements graphically and determine the resultant displacement NOUN 25MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY (a) Graphically, (b) Analytically.
N B 45ْ R 6km 0 Fig.
V8 Graphically- Construct figure V8 and measure Ө with a protractor for the direction of R. Measure the distance OB.
Multiply it by 2km the chosen scale, to give you the magnitude of the resultant R. From the measurement, the vector R has magnitude 7.4 x 2 = 14.8 km and direction 028°.
Analytically Using cosine rule, R 2 = 62 + 102 - 2 x 6 x 10 [-cos (180 - 45°)] = 36 + 100 + 12 cos 45ْ R = 220.85 = 14.86km To calculate 0, use Sine Rule.
Sin Ө = Sin (180 - 45) 10 14.85 .
Sin Ө= 0.4758 .*.
Ө = Sin-' 0.4758 = 28° .'.
You have the same result.
NOUN 26MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Example 2 Add the following Vectors.
AB - AC + BC - DC + DB Solution.
AB - AC + BC - DC + DB = CA + BC + CD + DB + DB = AC + CA + CB = 0 + CB = CB Note how you use the triangle law to add AB + BC = AC with B the middle letter canceling out.
3.2.1 Laws of Vectors Algebra If u, v and w are vectors and m and n are scalar, u + v = v + u (commutative law for addition) u + (v + w) = (u + v) = w (associative law for addition).
mu = um (commutative law for multiplication) m (nu) = (mu) u (Associative law for multiplication).
(m + n) u = nu + nu (Distributive law) m(u + v) = mu + mv (Distributive law).
You are now given the authority to treat vectors like any other number in the real number system.
You must remember, however, that multiplication, in this case is referring to scalar multiplication only.
You are going to learn later about products of vectors.
3.2.2 Proof of commutative law of addition NOUN 27MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Exercise 3 Show that addition of vectors is commutative i.e.
u + v = v + u Solution: Draw Fig.
V9, A A parallelogram OABC Formed by Vectors OA = u, and OC = v u R=u + v U + v = AO + AB or OC + CB R = v + u O That is u + v = v + u v C Fig.
V9 Exercise 4 Show that the addition of vectors is associative i.e.
u (v + w) = (u + v) + w Solution: Let vector OP = u, and PQ= v then OP + PQ = PQ = u + v I.e.
u + v = OQ See Fig.
V 10 = v + w= OP + PR = OR NOUN 28MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY I.e.
u + (v + w) = 0R Also OQ + QR = OR i.e.
(u + v) + w = OR Since OR = OR, then u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w 4.0.
Conclusion You can treat vectors like any other number in the real number system.
You can add by using triangle or parallelogram law.
You can subtract by using negative vectors.
You can multiply by a scalar in this unit, and later by other vectors.
The vector algebra also obeys the laws of normal algebra since it is commutative, associative, and distributive.
5.0 Summary You have learnt in this unit the following; l. Triangle law of vector addition which gives the resultant of two AB+BC=AC 2.
The parallelogram law of vector addition gives the resultants of two vectors with the same initial point.

Introduction In the last units you used the graphical methods to determine the resultant (sum) of two or more vectors.
There is therefore, from the graphs and construction, a need to find an easier way to do this.
In this unit, you will come across vectors, resolved into its components i, j, and k. The sum therefore is just the sum of the coefficients of the components of the vectors.
From this a lot of other results will be arrived at, which you must take note of as you will need them in other units.
2.0.
Objectives On successful completion of this Unit you should be able to: - Express vectors in terms of its components i, j, k. - Add vectors successfully using the components.
NOUN 31MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY - Calculate the magnitude of vectors successfully.
- Use position vectors to calculate relative vectors of two given points.
- Calculate correctly, the Unit vector of a given vector in its direction.
3.1.1 Unit Vectors You refer to a vector with a unit magnitude (1 unit) as a unit vectors.
Therefore if a is the magnitude of vector u, the a unit vector in the direction of a is .u usually denoted e = u with u ≠ o u U u This implies you can represent a vector as its magnitude multiplied by its unit vector in its direction i.e.
u = ue u 3.1.2 The rectangular Unit Vector 1, j, k. (1, 1, 1) Consider the initial points of vector u, v and w, fixed at an origin represented by a corner of a cube as in fig.
V 13.
You will have an important set of unit vectors, having their initial point at O and in the direction of the x, y, z and of a three dimensional rectangular co- ordinates system.
Fig.
V13 These unit vectors, you denote i, j, k in the direction x, y, and z respectively.
3.1.3 The Right-handed (rule) Rectangular Co-ordinate System NOUN 32MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY As you must have observed from the cube in fig.
V 13, any corner of the cube could have been chosen, and any side of the cube could be the x or y or z- axes.
Z X Y To remove this confusion, you have a rule referred to as the right handed rule.
This rule is assuming, first of all that you are a right handed person.
Secondly that you have used the screwdriver before, with your right-hand.
If you are to loosen a screw, think of the movement of your thumb, as the screw rotates anti-clockwise through 90° from x to y, y to z and z to x.
Once you agree with this convention, it will be easy to carry out operations on unit vectors.
3.1.4 Position Vector or Radius Vector.
u = x ,i + y + z k with x, y, z, the components of a in the x, y, and z 1 1j 1 direction and the magnitude u = √ x2 + y2 + z2 In particular, if you have r = xi + yj + zk, you referred to r as the position vector or radius vector, r, from point O (0, 0, 0) the origin to a point (x, y, z), a corner of the cube as in fig.
V 14 r= | r | = √x2 + y2 + z2 NOUN 33MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Fig V l 4 3.2.0 Scalar and vector field Just as in the 2-dimensional space x - y-axis, you could plot points as you should have done while drawing graphs.
In other words, you are aware of the ordered pairs of points (x, y) which is possible once you treat x, and y as variable and y as a function of x, y = f(x).
This will make the next definition easy for you to understand.
3.2.1 Scalar field If to each point (x, y, z) of a region R in space, there corresponds a number or scalar Φ (x, y, z), then you call Φ (a) Scalar function of position or Scalar point function, and you say that a scalar field Φ has been defined in R Example: Φ (x, y, z) = x3y - z2 defines a scalar field.
3.2.2 Vector Field.
If to each point (x, y, z) of a region R in space there corresponds a vector v (x, y, z), then you call v a vector function of position or vector point functions and you say that a vector field v has been defined in R. NOUN 34MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Example 7 (a) If the velocity at any point (x, y, z) within a moving fluid is known at a certain time, then a vector field is defined.
(b) v (x, y, z) = xy2i -2yz3j + x2zk defines a vector field.
A vector field, which is independent of time, is called a stationary or steady state vector field.
Simply put the last two examples in section 3.2.1. and 3.2.2. is just an attempt to inform you that just as you can have scalar functions of (x, y, z), you can also have vector function of (x, y, z) in the scalar field (space) and vector field (space) respectively you should note that i, j, k are non-collinear vectors.
4.0 Conclusion You can now add and subtract vectors easily.
All you need is what you have learnt in this unit - the components of the vector in the x, y, and z-axes.
Expressing vectors in terms of its components will help you carry out a lot of functions concerning vectors.
You now know that there is the `vector field' as well the `scalar field'.
5.0 Summary In this Unit you have learnt the definition of: (a) e = u the unit vector in the direction of u. u u (b) i, j, k are the unit vectors in the direction of x, y, and z-axes.
(c) The right-handed rule assumes, and expects movement in an anti clockwise direction from x - y, y - z and z - y and so on i.e.
x ---> y--- > z~ x--+ y... in choosing an origin and fixing the axes.
(d) The position vector or radius vector r = xi + yj + zk represents the components of vector v from point, O (0, 0, 0), the origin, to a point (x, y, z), a corner of a cube.
(e) The magnitude or modulus of r is r = √x2+y2+z2.
(f) A scalar field or vector field, which is independent of time, is called a stationary or steady state scalar or vector field.

References and other Resources 1.0 Introduction Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction.
For this reason, the method of addition or resultant needs to be thoroughly explored by you.
It is for this reason that you are being presented with different ways of achieving this.
You already learnt the representation graphically of vectors, and its sum through such diagrams.
In unit 4, you were introduced to the definition of unit vectors especially i, j, and k. You will, therefore, in this unit, deal with components of vectors, which are the smaller, parts whose sum represent the vectors.
From this concept, a lot of other results will be arrived at, which we must take note of.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: Write vectors in terms of its components i, j, k. NOUN 37MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 3.1.1 Components of a Vector in terms of i, j, k You have learnt in the previous section how all vectors can be represented as u = ue .
i.e.
the magnitude of the vector multiplied by its unit vector.
U You will now have e as a unit vector in the direction of the x, y, and z-axes U called i, j, k respectively.
The implication of an origin like this is that of a vector u=x i + y j + z k with 1 1 1 x , y , z , € R. 1 1 1 x i, y j and z k are referred to as the rectangular component vectors or 1 1 1 simply component vectors of u in the x , y , and z , directions.
1 1 1 x , y , and z , are referred to as the rectangular components or simply 1 1 1 components of u in the x, y and z directions.
With these definitions or representation, you are now in a better position to deal with vector algebra.
The magnitude of u =x i + y j + z k is √x 2 + y 2 + z 2 without drawing the 1 1 1 1 1 1 diagram as in unit 2.
3.1.2 Non - Collinear Vectors.
Non-collinear vectors are vectors which are not parallel to the same line, and so when their initial points coincides, (in this case at (0, 0, 0).
They determine the planes that make then up.
i.e.
x - y plane, y - z plane, and z - x plane, using the right - handed (thumb) rule.
'.
you say vectors i, j, k are mutually perpendicular.
Example 2 Show that if x u + y v + z w = x u + y v + z t. 1 1 1 2 2 2 Where u, v, and w are non - coplanar Then x = x , y = y , and z = z .
1 2 1 2 1 2 Solution: You can write the, equation as (x - x ) u + (y - y ) v + (z - z ) w = 0.

Solution: Let r be the position vector of any point P on the line through A and B.
Fig.
V12.
From the figure V12.
OA + AP = OP or a+ AP = r I.e.
AP = r and you have B Fig.
V12 OA + AB = OB a + AB = b i.e.
AB = b -a Since AP and AB are collinear (lie on the same line or parallel to the same line).
AP = t AB or r - a = t (b - a).
NOUN 39MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Then the required equation is r = a + t (b - a) or r = (1 - t) a + tb which compares to the general equation of a straight line y = mx + c. If the equation is written (1 - t) a + tb - r = 0 the sum of the coefficient of a, b and r is 1 - t + t - 1 =0.
This implies that P is always on the line joining A and B does not depend on the choice of origin O. Alternatively, you can solve this problem by the method below.
Since AP and PB are collinear, then they are ratios of each other say A0.
-00 .
AP: PB = in: n or nAP = mPB Using the position vector above.
AP = r- a, PB = b – r .'.
n (r - a) = m(b - r) which transforms to r = na + mb m +n And you call this the symmetric form.
3.2.1 Relative Vectors Please note the use of the position vector leads to what you will call relative vectors.
If a is the position vector of A and b the position vector of B, then the position vector B relative to A is vector AB = b - a.
(note the order of the letters).
Example I Write AC, BD, and EF in terms of their relative vectors.
NOUN 40MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Solution: AC = c - a, BD = d - b, EF = f - e. 3.2.2 The Sum of Resultant of Vectors in Component Form: Example 1 (a) Find the position vectors or r, and r for the point (2, 4, 3) and Q (1, l 2 -5, 2) of a rectangular coordinate system in terms of the unit vectors i, j, k.

Introduction The issue of vectors being collinear on non-collinear, cannot be overemphasized.
The consequence of this concept is what this unit will bring out to you.
Problems in plane geometry and co-ordinate geometry are simplified for you, once you consider them under vector algebra.
You should take note of every diagram- the directions of the arrows showing the vectors, and how a simple statement given to you is eventually used to solve an example.
2.0.
Objectives At the end of this Unit, you should be able to: - Use the position vectors of two given points to express the line joining them (Relative Vectors) - Calculate correctly the magnitude of the given vectors.
- Use the given vectors to show if they are linearly dependent or linearly independent.
- Prove theorems based on collinearity or non-collinearity of vectors.
3.1.1.
Definitions of collinear vectors You will recall that when the triangle law of vector addition was discussed in the previous units, you learnt that if, AB, and BC are not on a Straight line the resultant AC is the vector closing the triangle ABC.
The NOUN 45MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Statement AB + BC = AC the very obvious, if they are on the same line.
Fig V13 In the first case (a) you have collinear vectors A and B, but in the second case (b) A, B, and C are said to be non-collinear vectors.
Also, if vectors AP and PB are collinear, P being a point on AB, such that the ratio AP: PB=m: n or nAP=mPB.
P If r is the position vector of P, and a and b are the position vectors of A and B respectively, then you can say n (r-a) = m (b-r), which transforms into r= n a + m b or na+mb=(m+n)r. m + n 3.1.2 Mid-point theorem Example 4 Prove that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and have one half of its magnitude.
Solution: Draw figure V 14.
Note the directions AB, BC, CA of the vectors c, a, and b respectively for the triangle to be in equilibrium.
NOUN 46MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY C b fig V 14 EF = EB + BF ½c - ½a = ½ (c - a) AC = -b = AB + BC = c-a EP = ½ AC which proved that EF is parallel to AR and is ½ of its magnitude This is the midpoint Theorem.
3.1.4 Division of a line Segment (Collinear Vector) Let the position vector of points P and Q relative to an origin be given by p and q respectively.
If R is a point which divides line PQ into segments, which are in the ratio m: n, then you will write the position vector of R as r = m p + n q which is a familiar statement in geometry.
m + n This means (m + n) r = mp + nq, which gives you a rule for collinearity of points.
3.2.1 Centroid If r .
r ... r are the position vectors of masses m , m …m respectively 1 2 n 1 2 n relative to an origin O.
Then the position vector of the Centroid can be proved as r = m r + m r + ... m r 1 1 2 2 n n m + m ... m I 2 n NOUN 47MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Simply put, the Centroid represents the weighed average or mean of several vectors.
Exercise 2 A quadrilateral PQRS has masses l, 2, 3 and 4 units located respectively at its vertices A (-l, -2,.
2), B (3, 2, -1), and D (3, 1, 2).
Find the coordinates of the Centroid.
Solution The position vector of the Centroid is C = p + 2 q + 3 r + 4 s 1 +2 +3 +4 Where, p= -i - 2j + 2k, q = 3i + 2j - k r = i -2j + 4k and s=3i+ j+2k c = (lx-1+2x3+3x1 +4x3)i + (lx-2+2x2+3x-2+4 x 1)j + (1x2 +2x(-1)+3x4 +4 x2) k 10 = 20 i + 0 j + 20 k 10 .'.
c =2i + 2k which will give the coordinate as (2, 0, 2).
3.2.2.
Linearly Dependent and Independent Vectors.
If you can represent the sum of given vectors r , r and r by a single vector r 1 2 3 4 i. e. r = r + r + r 4 1 2 3.
Then you can say r is linearly dependent on r , r and r and that r , r , r and 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 r constitute a linearly dependent set of vectors.
On the other hand r , r and r 4 1 2 3 are linearly independent vectors.
To understand this concept, think of the graph of y = 2x + 3 where you choose independent values of x to calculate y for a table of values.
So the values of y depend on your choice of values of x and you can say (rightly so) that y is the dependant variable, or simply put, the subject of the formula is the dependent variable.
NOUN 48MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY So in general - the vectors A, B, C,.... are called linearly dependent if you can find a set of scalars a, b, c.... not all zero, so that aA + bB + cC+...=0 Otherwise they are linearly independent.
Exercise 3 Give vectors u, v and w below, determine whether the vectors are linearly independent or linearly dependent.
(a) u = 2i + j - 3k, v = i - 4k and w = 4i + 3j – k Solution Let a, b, c, be scalar such that a(2, 1,-3)+b(1 0 -4) +c(4 3 - ])=O.
If a, b, and c exist, then u, v and w are linearly dependent.
.'.
2a + b +4c = 0... (1) a + 3 c = 0 ... (2) -3a - 4b - c=0 ... (3) From (2) a = - 3c.
Substituting in (1) you will have -6c+b+4c = 0 i.e.
-2c+b=0.
.'.
b = 2c.
.'.
a:b:cis-3c :2c :c =-3 :2 : 1 .'.
a=-3, b=2, and c= 1.
To check, in (1), (2) and (3) above, 2(-3) + 3 + 4(1) = -6 + 2 + 4 = -6 + 6 =0 -3 + 3 = 0. and +9 – 8 – 1 = 9 – 9 = 9.
.'.
- 3 u + 2v + w = 0 and so u, v and w are linearly dependant since 3u = 2v + w NOUN 49MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 4.0.
Conclusion Vectors could be collinear or non-collinear.
- Collinear vectors can be proved by the equation r=(nr,+mr2)/(in+n), or (m + n)r=nr +mr , where r is the position vector of a point on the line 1 2 joining r and r , dividing it in the ratio m : n l 2 - You can use the knowledge of Collinearity and non-Collinearity of points to prove the mid-point theorems.
- The vectors A, B, C, ... are called linearly dependent, if you can find a set of scalar a, b, c .... not all zero, such that aA + bB + cC + ... = 0.
Otherwise they are linearly independent.

Once again the consequence of this concept will be treated.
You will prove theorems in geometry based on the on the non-collinearity of points.
You will also learn about linearly dependent vectors.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you will be able to - Define non-collinear vectors.
- Prove the condition for non-collinear vectors.
- Prove theorems in geometry using the idea of non-collinear vectors.
- Prove that given vectors are linearly dependent.
3.1.1 Non-collinear and collinear vectors You will recall that when the triangle law of vector addition was discussed in the previous units, you learnt that if, AB, and BC are not on a straight line the resultant AC is the vector closing the triangle ABC.
The statement AB + BC = AC is the very obvious, if they are on the same line.
NOUN 52MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Fig V13 In the first case Fig V13 (a) you have collinear vectors A and B, but in the second case Fig V 13 (b) A, B, and C are said to be non-collinear vectors.
3.1.1 Definition of non-collinear vectors Non-collinear vectors are vectors that are not parallel to the same line.
Hence when their initial points coincide, they determine a plane.
A Fig.
V14 See Figure V 14 3.1.2 Proof of a condition for non-collinear vectors Example 1 Prove that if a and b are non-collinear that Xa + yb=0 implies x = y = 0.
Solutions: Suppose x ≠ 0, then you will have xa - yb = 0 implying xa = -yb And a = -y b .
NOUN 53MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Which implies that a is a scalar multiple of b and so must be parallel to the same line (collinear).
You can see this is contrary to the hypothesis a and b are non-collinear.
.'.
x = 0, them yb = 0, from which y = 0.
Example 2 If x a + y b = x a + y b where a and b are non-collinear, 1 1 2 2 then x = x , and y = y .
1 2 1 2 Solution You can write x a + y b = x a + y b as 1 1 2 2 x a + y b - (x a + y b) = 0 and so, 1 1 2 2 (x - x ) a + (y - Y ) b = 0.
1 2 1 2 Hence, from example 1, x - x = 0, y - y = 0 1 2 I 2 Or x = x , y = y 1 2 1 2 This you can interpret in words as two vectors are equal if their corresponding (scalar) coefficient are equal or their sum is zero.
The above result can be extended to the three dimensional situation.
If a, b and c are non-coplanar (note here you are talking about planes rather than lines) then xa + yb + zc = 0, implies x = y = z = o And further that if x a + y b + z c = x a + y b + z c, 1 1 1 2 2 2 where a, b and c are non-coplanar, then x = x , y = y and z = z 1 2 1 2 1 2 3.1.3 To prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other Prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Solution Let ABCD be the given parallelogram with diagonals intersecting at P. From Figure V 15 .'.
BD= b - a and BP = x (b - a) because BD and BP are collinear You also have AC = a + b, and so AP = y (a + b) From triangle ABP, AB = AP + PB = AP – BP and you NOUN 54MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY then have a = y (a + b) - x( b – a ) = (x + y)a + (y - x)b Since a and b are non-collinear, from Example 1, x + y = 1 and y - x = 0i.e.
x = y = ½ and so P is the mid-point of both diagonals.
In conclusion you say that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

Solution: Draw figure V 16 Note that in naming figures you must go A ---> B --> C -+ D without a break, clockwise or anti-clockwise.
NOUN 55MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Fig V16 In the Fig.
V16, you are having the sides as vectors a, b, c, and d. and the midpoints P, Q, R, S. of its sides.
Then you will have that, PQ = ½ (a + b), QR = ½(b + c), RS = ½(c + d) and SP = ½(d + a).
But from the directions of the vectors on the parallelogram, it is in equilibrium, which implies a + b + c + d + = 0 .'.
PQ = ½(a + b) = -½(c + d) = SR and QR = ½ (b + c) = ½ (d + a) = PS This implies that the opposite sides are equal and parallel (equal vectors) and so PQRS is a parallelogram (definition of a parallelogram).
3.0 Conclusion Vector could be collinear or non-collinear.
- For non-collinear vectors a and b, xa + yb = 0 = x = y = 0.
- You can use the knowledge of Collinearity and non-Col linearity of points to prove the following theorems amongst others: NOUN 56MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY (i) That the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
(ii) If straight lines connect the midpoints of the consecutive sides of any quadrilateral, the resulting quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

Introduction The Rectangular resolution of the vectors is necessary because you have seen that vectors can be easily added if it is written in its components form.
If all that you are given, therefore is the magnitude and direction, you will be required to resolve (breakdown) the vectors into its components.
This unit will help you to achieve this aim.

If you choose to use the angle inclined to the perpendicular axis then it will be the sine multiplied by the magnitude.
This is easily done since the two angles are complementary.

References and other Resources 1.0 Introduction In this unit you will be introduced to the first product of vectors; the scalar or dot product.
This product gives a scalar result and so the term `dot' product.
The algebraic laws on this product will give you an easy way to calculate these products, so pay attention to the laws.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Define scalar or dot product - State the algebraic laws on dot product - Calculate easily, without diagrams, the dot product of two given vectors.
3.1.1 Product of Vector There are two ways a vector can be multiplied as opposed to the scalar multiplication in the previous unit.
NOUN 66MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY These are the Dot or Scalar Product, and the vector or cross product.
In this unit you are learning about the Dot or Scalar Product.
3.1.2 The Dot or Scalar Products.
Definition: The Dot or Scalar Product denoted u.v (u dot v) is defined as the product of the magnitude of a and v and cosine of the angle θ2 between them you write in symbols.
u.v = uv cos q θ≤≤ q ≤2p This product gives a scalar, Since u, v, and Cosθ are scalar, and so the term scalar product.
3.2.1 Algebraic Laws on Dot Product 1. u.v = v.u (commutative) 2. u.
(v + w) = u.v + u.w (distributive) 3. m (u.v) _ (mu)v = u.
(mv) 4. i.i = j.j = k.k = l x l cos 0 = l x lx l = l but i.j = j.k + k.j = 1 x 1 x cos 90° = 1 x 1 x 0 = 0 From this you once again have a very easy way to find the dot product of the vectors.
If u = x i + y j + z k and v = x j + y j + z k 1 1 1 2 2 2 Then u.v = (x i + y j + z k) (x i + y j + z k) 1 l 1 1 2 2 =(x , x + y y + z , z ) 1 2 1 2 1 2 Since i.j = j.k = j.i = q and only same unit vectors multiply to give 1 Example 1.
Prove that u.v = v.u the commutative law.
Solution: u.v = uv cos q = v. u Since uv = vu are scalar.
And q is the angle between u and v 3.2.2 The dot product of perpendicular vectors The dot product of perpendicular vectors is zero.

The word dot comes from the way you write this product a.b and the result is always an ordinary number or scalar, hence the term scalar product.
NOUN 69MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Despite the definition a.b = ab cos q , you have seen how easy it really is to get the Dot product by simply adding the products of the coefficients of i, j and k. This is due to the Algebraic laws of vector Algebra.
You are now ready for the next Units, which will use the consequence of the Algebraic laws to derive some results.

You can define the projection of a vector (the component) u along any other vector v using the concept of Scalar product.

Since PQ = q - r is perpendicular to p, then (q - r).
p=0 or r.p=q.p is the required equation of the plane in vector form.
i.e.

Solution You will show, first, that the vectors from a triangle.
You will need to apply the triangle law to the sides of the triangle by checking if u + u + w = 0 OR (i) u + v = w or n + w = v or v + w = u that is, will the sum of two of the vectors give the third vector (Fig.

Again by trial u.w = 0. from u.v = (3i - 2j + k) .
(i - 3j + 5k) = 3 + 6 + 5 = 0 v.w = (3i - 2j + k).
(2i + j - 4k)= 6 – 2 – 4 = 6 – 6 = 0 and so the triangle is right angled.

References and other Resources 1.0 Introduction One of the consequences of dot products is the direction cosine.
This is a concept involving the use of unit vectors, which you are already familiar with.
The coefficient of the components of this unit vectors gives the direction cosines.
From this simple calculation, a lot of other concept will be learnt by you.
In this you will learn about this consequence of dot product and the direction cosine.
3.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you will be able to: - Calculate the direction cosines of a given vector - Calculate the angles to which a given vector is inclined to the co- ordinate axis - Find the equation of a plane passing through a point and the perpendicular to the line joining two given vectors NOUN 80MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 3.1.1 Direction cosines If you have a vector reduced to its unit vector, then the magnitude is 1.
You can then find the inclination of the vector to the axis easily as it will be 1 cos a , 1 cos β, and 1 cos ỵ represent the vectors inclination to the x, y, and z axes respectively.
To make this easy all you need is to reduce the vector into its unit form, then the coefficient of i, j and k represent cos a , cos β and cos y respectively.
You refer to this coefficient as the direction cosine of the vector, since they express the vector's inclination to the axis.
Example 1 Find the direction cosines of the line joining the points (3,2, -4) and (1-2,2) Solution Let A (3, 2, -4) and B (l, -1, 2) Then AB = b – a = (1 - 3)I + (-1 - 2)j + (2 - (-4))k = -2i - 3j + 6k The Unit vector e = -2 i -3 j + 6 k r √(2)2 +(-3 )2 +62 = 2 i - 3 j + 6 k √49 = -2 i - 3 i + 6 k 7 The direction cosines are -2, -3, 6 7 7 7 Exercise 3.
Find the acute angle which the line joining the points (1 -3, 2) and (3, -5, 1) makes with the coordinate axis.
Solution: a = i- 3j + 2k b = 3i - 5j + k r = b – a NOUN 81MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY = (3 - 1) i + (-5 -(-3) )j + (i - 2)k = 2i - 2j – k .'.
e = 2 i - 2 i - k r √4+ 4+ 1 = 2 i - 2 j - k 3 The direction cosines are 2, -2, -1 3 3 3 and the angles are Cos-1 2, Cos-1 -2, and Cos-1 -1 3 3 3 to x, y, and z axis respective.
You will have 48.2°, 48.2° and 70.5° Example 2 Find the angles which the vector u = 3i - 6j + 2k makes with the coordinate axes.
Solution From the previous unit, you should know you are to look for the direction cosines of the vector u to start with.
u = 3i - 6j + 2k e = 3 i - 6 j + 2 k .e.
u r √9 + 36+4 u = 3 i - 6 j + 2 k 7 The direction cosines are 3, - 6 and 2 7 7 7.
Let a and β and y represent the required angle.
.'.
a , the inclination to the x-axis is a = cos-1 3 = 64.1° 7 NOUN 82MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY β, the inclination to the y - axis is R = cos-1 - 6 7 =180° - cos-1 6 7 = 180° - 31 ° = 149° and y, the inclination to the z -axis is y =cos-12 = 73.4° 7 Exercise 1 Find the acute angles which the line joining the points (3, -5, 1) and (1 - 3 + 2) makes with the coordinate axes.
Solution: You should use relative vector for UV = v - u to get the position vectors of The line joining u and v where u =3i - 5j+ k, and u = i - 3j + 2k.
.'.
UV = v - u = (1 -3)i + (-3 + 5)j + (2 - 1)k r = -2i + 2j + k.
.'.
The direction cosines of r will be the coefficient of the unit + vector e in the direction of r. e = -2 i + 2 j + k v √4+ 4+ 1 = -2 i + 2 j + 1 k 3 3 3 and a = cos-12, β = cos 2, y= cos-1 1 3 3 3 .'.
a = 48.2°, 48.2°, and 70.5° Note that a should have been cos-1 2/3 which will give 180 - 48.2°, but the question demand for `acute' angle not the obtuse angle, which is only adjacent to the acute angle 48.2°.
NOUN 83MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY Exercise 2 For what values of p are the vectors u = 2p - i + pj - 4k and v = pi - 2j + k perpendicular?
Solution You need to show that the dot product u.v = 0 will imply the solved P. u.v = (2p x p) + (p x -2) + (-4 x 1) = 0 = 2p2 - 2p -4 = 0.
A quadratic divide through by 2 equation in p p2 – p – 2 = 0 Factorize to get (p - 2)(p + 1) = 0.
.'.
p = 2 or -1 3.1.3.
Orthogonal Unit Vector Example 3.
Show that u =2i - 2j + k/3, v =i + 2j + 2k/3 and w = 2i + j - 2k/3 are mutually orthogonal unit vectors.
Solution u.v = (2 x 1) + (-2 x 2) + (1 x 2) = 2 – 4 + 2 =0 3 3 3 3 3 3 9 9 9 v.w = (1 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (-2 x 2) = 2 + 2 – 4 = 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 9 9 9 u.w = (2 x 2) + (-2 x 1) + (I x -2) = 4 – 2 – 2 = 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 9 9 9 This proves that they are perpendicular or to use the word in the question, `orthogonal'.
That they are unit vectors is easily proved by your writing each vector a mu, mv, mw where m is a scalar in this case 1/3 and that the magnitude of u, v, w are each √9 = √1 = 1.
9 From the definition of unit vector as a vector whose magnitude is one, you have your proof.

u, v, w are mutually orthogonal unit vectors.
3.1.4 To prove that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
Example 4 Prove that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
Solution: Draw a rhombus ABCD as in figure V27 DB = OA + AB = u + v DC + CA = DA .'.
CA= DA – DC = u - v v Fig.
V27 DB.
CA = (u + v).
(u - v) (Difference of two squares) =u2 -v2 = u2 – u2 = 0.
Since u = v being a rhombus, all sides are equal.
You can now conclude that the diagonals DB and CA are perpendicular, because their dot product is zero.
4.0 Conclusion In the study of mathematics, the language of science, every effort is made to reduce any fear associated with calculations.
This unit is one of such efforts e.g.
The existence of direction cosines makes it easy for you calculate a lot of quantities such as: NOUN 85MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY - The inclination of a vector to the axis.

Introduction In the last Unit you were introduced to Scalar or Dot product.
In this Unit, an attempt will be made to pick as many examples as possible where the Dot product is applied in calculations including plane Geometry.
These calculation have been made easier by the use of dot product even though they are in three dimensions.
You will appreciate these examples, if you are going on to study physics- related subject or higher Geometry.
2.0 Objective At the end of this Unit, you should be able to: - calculate work done by a given force on a particle through a given displacement using dot product.
- determine when the work done on a particle is zero, and maximum.
- calculate accurately the Direction Cosines of a vector, hence, find the inclination of the vector to the axis.
NOUN 87MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY - calculate the perpendicular to a given plane - calculate the distance from the origin to a given plane.
3.1.1 Work expressed as a scalar Product.
Work expressed as a Scalar product work is defined as the force applied multiplied by the distance moved in order words, if there is no distance or displacement of the object, then work done is zero, this also occurs when the F is perpendicular to the displacement .
In terms of Scalar Product, let a force F be applied on an object at an angle 0 to the direction of its displacement d. Then W = (F cos θ) d = F.d Work is maximum when the force F is parallel to the displacement.
Example 1 Find the work done in moving an object along a vector r = 3i + 2j -5k, if the applied force is F = 2i - s – k Solution: Work done = F.r = (2i - j - k) - (3i + 2j - 5k) = (2 x 3) + (-1 x 2) + (-1 x -5) = 6 - 2 + 5 = 11 - 2 = 9 Exercise 1 Find the work done in moving an object along a straight line from (3, 2, -1) to (2, -l, 4) in a force field given by F = 4i - 3j + 2k Solution: The resultant displacement is d = r – r = (2 - 1 , 4) - (3, 2, -1) 2 1 = -i -3j = 5k .'.
work done W = F.d = (4i - 3 j + 2k).
(-i - 3j + 5k) = (4 x -1) +(-3 x -3) + (2 x 5) NOUN 88MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY = -4 + 9 + 10 = 19 - 4 =15 3.1.2 Perpendicular vectors Example 2 Prove that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
Solution: Draw a rhombus ABCD as in figure V28 DB = OA + AB = u + v DC + CA = DA .'.
CA = DA – DC = u - v v Fig.
V28 .'.
DB.
CA = (u + v).
(u - v) (Difference of two squares) =u2 –v1 = u2 - u2 = 0.
Since u = v being a rhombus, all sides are equal.
You can now conclude that the diagonals DB and CA are perpendicular, because their dot product is zero.
3.2.1 Perpendicular to a plane Determine a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of u and v. Where u = 2i - 6j - 3k and v = 4i - 3j - k. Solution: NOUN 89MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY You chose a vector w = w i + w j + w k to be perpendicular to the plane of u 1 2 3 and v. what you mean here is that w is perpendicular to both u and v and so their dot product will be zero each.
w.u = 2w - 6w -3w = 0 1 2 3 2w -6W = 3W ---- (1) 1 2 3 w.v = 4w + 3w - w = 0 1 2 3 4w + 3w = w ----- (2) 1 2 3 Solve (1) and (2) simultaneously to express w and w terms of w .

1 2 3 Then you can say w.u =0 w.v since w is perpendicular to both u and v. w.u = 4w - w + 3w =0 1 2 3 .'.
4w + 3w = w -------- (1) 1 3 2 w.v = -2w + w - 2w = 0 1 2 3 2w + 2w = w --------- (2) 1 3 2 Now solve (1) and (2) simultaneous to express w and w in terms of w .
4w l 3 2 1 + 3w = 2w +2w 3 1 3 4w - 2w = 2w - 3w 1 1 3 3 2w = -w or w = -2w 1 3 3 1 NOUN 90MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY w = -1w 1 3 2 Subs.

Equation of a plane.
Example 3 Find an equation for the plane perpendicular to the vector u = 2i + 3j + 6k, and passing through the terminal point of the vector v = i = 5 j - 3 k. Solution let r be the position vector of P (x, y, z) on the plane, and Q the terminal point of v in figure V29 using relative vectors, PQ = v - r and is perpendicular to u, NOUN 91MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY then you say (v - r).
u = 0. v - u = r. u = 0 (Distributive law) v.u = r. u is the required equation of the plane, in vector form since it gives the condition required.
You can then write this in the rectangular form as (xi + yj + zk) (2i + 3j + 6k) = (i + 5j + 3k).
(2i + 3j + 6k) 2x + 3y + 6z =(1 x 2)+(5 x3) + (3 x 6) = 35.
That is the equation for the plane is 2x + 3y + 6z =35 Exercise 3 Given that u = 3i + j + 2k and v = i - 2j - 4k are the position vectors of points p and Q respectively.
(a) Find an equation for the plane r passing through Q and perpendicular to line PQ.
Solutions: You must find PQ first.
Using relative vectors, without diagram, PQ = v - u v – u = (1 - 3)i+ (-2- 1)j + (-4 - 2)k = 2i - 3j - 6k Then you let r = xi + yj +zk be an arbitrary point on the plane whose equation is required, (r - u).
(u - v)=0.
r.(u - v ).= (u - v) v ( Distributive law) or (xi + yj + zk).

You will learn two approaches to the calculation, and so have a choice of which you find easier.
2.0 0bjectives At the end of this unit you should be able to calculate correctly the cross product of two or three vectors using the expansion or determinant method 3.1.1 The Cross Product Definition The cross or vector product of u and v is a vector w = u x v. The magnitude of u x v is defined as the product of the magnitude of u and v and the sine of the angle θ between them.
The direction of the vector w = u x v is perpendicular to the plane of u and v = 2i – j + 5k and such that u. v and w from a right - handed system.

The magnitude of u. v is the same as the area of a parallelogram with side u and v. 7.
If u x v = 0 and u and v are not null vectors.
Then u and v are parallel.
Remember your right-handed rule i - j - k - i - j but if reversed, you get minus.

Remark.
Which is not too bad once you remember the ruler.
Here is a hint you could use:- Let your mind be fixed on the right order of the alphabets i, j, k. Same letters give zero.
Two different letters that sound right, give the missing letter.
e.g.
i x j = k, j x k = i.
But when the two letters are in the wrong order, the result is still the missing letter, but negative e.g.
j x i = - k, i x k k x j = -i.
Of course the determinant removes all these problems from the calculation.
Now you have an example to complete, so go ahead and do it right this time.

Introduction In this unit, you are presented with different application of Vector or cross product and you will discover why you refer to mathematics as the language of Science.
You should, take time to study and practice the exercises and examples given.
2.0 Objectives At the and of this unit, you should be able to • Calculate accurately, the area of triangle, parallelogram, square and rhombus using given data's.
• Recognize and use the definitions of quadrilaterals with their difference or common properties 3.1.1 Definitions of types of quadrilaterals At this point, you should, revise the definitions of the quadrilaterals and their properties.
• A quadrilateral is a 4 -sided polygon (quad.)
• A rectangle is a quadrilateral with each angle as right angle (90°) • A square is a rectangle with all sides equal.
• A rhombus is a quad with all sides equal in length.
• A parallelogram is quad.
with two.
Pairs of parallel sides.
NOUN 103MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY • A trapezium is a quad.
With one Pair of parallel sides • A kite is a quad, with a diagonal as line of symmetry From these definitions, you can conclude that rectangles, squares, and rhombuses are parallelograms.
But the diagonals of rectangle do not intersect at right angles, while those of rhombus and square bisect each other at right angle.
Also, the diagonals of the square are equal but those of rhombus are not equal.
3.1.1 Area as a Vector.
Usually you think of Area as a Scalar quantity.
However, in many applications in physics (e.g.
in fluid mechanics or in electrostatics) you also want to know the orientation of the area.
Suppose you want to calculate the rate at which water in a stream flows through a wire loop of a given area.
This rate will obviously be different if we place the loop parallel or perpendicular to the flow, when the loop is parallel, the flow through it is Zero.
So you will now see how the vector product can be used, to specify the direction of an area, 3.1.2 Area of parallelogram = h /v/ = /u/ sin θ v = /u x v/ Fig.
V30.
i.e.
the area of a parallelogram with vectors u and v as sides is the modulus of its cross product.
Fig.V30 3.1.4 Area of Parallelogram, given diagonals.
Example 2 NOUN 104MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY The diagonals of a parallelogram are given by a = 3i - 4j -k and b = 2i + 3j-6k.
(a) Show that the parallelogram is a rhombus (b) Find the Area of the parallelogram.
Solution:- (a) a. b = (3x2) + (-4x3) + (-1x-6) = 6 -12 + 6 =12 - 12 =0 :.
The diagonals are perpendicular :.
The figure could be rhombus or square a = 9+16+1 =26.
2 b = 4+9+36 =49 =7.
2 Since the magnitudes of the diagonals are not equal, it follows that the parallelogram is a rhombus.
(b) The Area of the parallelogram is ½ab sin θ where θ is the angle between the diagonal which in this case is a right angle.
½ab sin θ = ½a x b = I j k ½ 3 -4 -1 2 3 -6 =½(24 + 3)i - (-18 + 2)j + (9 + 8) k = ½ (27i + 16j +17k) =½√272 + 162 + 172 = ½√729 + 256 + 289 = ½√1247 = ½ (35.31) = 17.7 sq.units.

3.2.1 Parallel vectors.
If u x v = 0 and if u and v are not Zero, show that u is parallel to v. Solution If u x v = 0, then you have I uv I sinθ, = 0.
Then sin θ = 0 and θ is 0° or NOUN 106MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 180°.
Example 1 Show that u x v 2 + u.v 2 = l u l2 lvl2 Solution = u x v 2 + | u.v| 2 = uv sin θ 2 + uv cos θ 2 e = u2 v2sin2θ + u2v2cos2θ = u2v2 (sin2θ + cos2θ) = u2v2 x 1 (sin 2θ + cos2θ = 1) = u2v2 4.0 Conclusion The applications of the definition of vector or cross product, in many fields of learning snake calculation easier and faster.
It is useful in Area of plane shapes.
With vector as sides you should take note of the type of information given, and required in a problem for example if you are given two points, and Q, you might need to get the relative vector q - p to express PQ as a vector.
But you might be given the vector representing PQ already as just u = xi + y j + z k. Just take time to read questions carefully before answering them.

3.2.1 Angular velocity.
A rigid body rotates about an axis through point O with angular speed ώ The linear velocity v of a point P of the body with position vector r is given by v = ώ x r where ώ is the vector with magnitude 1ώI whose direction is that in which a right handed screw would advance under the given vocation.
The vector ώ is called the angular velocity.
Exercise 2.
The angular velocity of rotating rigid body about an axis of rotation is given by ώ = 4i + j – 2k.
Find the linear velocity of a point P on the body whose position vector relative to a point on the axis of rotation is 2 i - 3 j+ k. Solution v = ώ x r ώ = 4i + j - 2k r = 2i - 3j + k. NOUN 110MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY .'.

The torque due to a force F which acts on a particle at position r is defined by г = r x F You may wish to know that torque is a measure of the ability of an applied force to produce a twist, or to rotate a body .
Note that a large force applied, parallel to r would produce no twist, it would only pull.
Only F sin θ, i.e.
the component of F perpendicular to r produces a `torque.
e The direction of torque is along the axis of rotation.
This is precisely what the equation i = r x F is telling you.
For example, since r x r is a zero vector, a force along r yield zero toque.
The direction of i is given by the right-handed rule (Fig.

References and other Resources 1.0 Introduction Having gone through scalar or dot product, vector on cross product, there is need to ask the question, what if you have more than one vector to multiply.
This is the purpose of this unit.
Not only will you have to learn low to get triple products, but you will have to differentiate between the dot and the cross products when it come to triple vectors.
You should take note of the `order' in which results are given.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to - Find the scalar triple products - Calculate correctly the volume of a parallelepiped given the sides as vectors.
3.1.1 The dot and cross product of three vectors The dot and cross multiplication of three vector u, v and w may produce meaningful products of the form (v .
v), u.
(v x w) and u x (v x w).
From examples and exercise you will learn how to evaluate these products.
NOUN 114MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY 3.1.2 Laws of triple products.
The following laws will guide you in your attempts at calculating triple products.
1.
(u .
v) w = u (v x w).
This implies read the question carefully to recognize the order of the vectors in the products.
3.1.3 Scalar triple products or box products 2. u.
(v x w) = v. (w x u) = w. (u .
v) you should observe, once again the order or right - hand rule in these product (uvw), (vwu), (wuv) and note that since (u x v) = - v x u, you cannot effort to do things your own way.
These results u.
(v x w) = v. (w x u) = w. (u .
v) you will refer to as the scalar triple products or box product.
3.1.4 Volume of parallelepiped.
The scalar triple products or box products u.
(v x w) = v. (w x u) = w. (u.v) also represents the volume of a parallelepiped having u, v and w as edges, or the negative of this volume, according as u, v and w, do or do not form a right - handed system.
3.1.5 Box products in components forms Analytically, let u = u, i + uj + uk, v = vj + vj + uk, and w = wj+ wk.
Then u.
(v x w) = u u u 1 2 3 v v v 1 2 3 w w w 1 2 3 Determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficient of the 3 vectors u, v and w in component form.
You can continue the laws now.
3. u x (v x w) = (v x w) x w, i.e.
You cannot use the associative law for cross products.
3.2.1 Vector triple products NOUN 115MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY u x (u x w) = (v. w) v - (u. v)w and (u x v) x w = (u.w)v - (v.w)u The product u .
(v x w) you should refer to as the scalar triple products or box product [u, v, w], but the product u x (v x w) should be referred to as the vector triple products.
You should also note that you could write u .
(v x w) as u .
(v x w).
However you cannot have out the brackets in vector triple product u x (v x w).
Example 1 Evaluate (2i - 3j) .
[(i + j - k) x (3i - k)] Solution = i j k 2 -3 0 1 1 -1 3 0 -1 = 2(-l - 0) + 3(-1 - (-3) + 0 (0-3) = -2 + 3 (-1 + 3) + 0 = -2 + 3 (2) = 6 – 2 =4 Note that 2i - 3j = 2i - 3j + 0k and 3i – k = 3i – k = 3i + 0j - k Example 3 Prove that (u x v).
(v x w) x (w x u) = (u. v x w)2 Solution Let a vector p = v x w Then p x (w x u) = w (p .
u) - (p. v) Substitute p = v x w to get, = (v x w) x (w x u) = w (v x w .u) – u (u x w .w) NOUN 116MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY = w (u. v x w) – u (v. w x w) = w (u. v x w) And so you have, (u x v) .
(v x w) x (w x u) = (u x w).
w (u. v x w) = ( u x v .w)(u. v x w) = (u. v x w)2.
Example 4 Given u=i - 2j - 3k, v = 2j - k and w = i + 3j - 2k, find.
(a) (u x v) x w(b) u x (v x w) Solution.
(a) (u x v) x w = (u .

You have the scalar Triple product, which will give you a scalar result.
You can represent the scalar triple product as the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficient of the three vectors involved.
The right-handed system must be taken into consideration when writing out the order of the scalar Triple or box product and the vector Triple product.
You, using the absolute value of scalar triple product of the vectors representing the adjacent sides can calculate the volume of a parallelepiped.

While the vector triple product will yield a vector.
The scalar triple product of u , v w could be defined as u .
(v x w ) = /u / v x w/ cos β where β is the angle between u and the vector v x w. Now you can see why it is scalar.
The scalar triple product u .
(v x w) can also be interpreted by you as the components of u along v x w.The geometrical meaning of the scalar triple product is that its absolute vale represent the volume of a parallelepiped with u , v and w as adjacent sides.
(fig.
Vi) The magnitude of the scalar triple products u , (u x v ) is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped having sides u , v and w .
3.2.4 Properties of the scalar triple products NOUN 121MAT 142 VECTORS & GEOMETRY If you inter change two rows of matrices the sign is reversed for the determinate.
And so you have u, (v x w ) = - u .
(v x w) = - u.
(w x v) Interchanging the rows twice you get u.
(v x w) = v. (w x u) = w. (u x v).
The geometrical significance of this result is that these three products represent the same volume.
And since dot product is commutative, you can write u, (v x w) = (v x w).
u = (u x v).
w and for any constant k, [k u .
(v x w)] = k [u.
(v x w)] If u.
(v x w) = o, then the volume of the parallelepiped is zero and so u.
(v x w) and coplanar, as already discussed i.e.
they lie on the same plane.
3.25 Equal vectors in scalar triple products Since u x v is perpendicular to u from definition of cross product, then u.
(u x v) = 0.
In other words, if any two rectors in the scalar triple products are equal it becomes zero.
Exercise 1 The volume of a tetrahedron is one sixth of the volume of a parallelepiped the three sides of a tetrahedron are given by u = 2i + 3j - 4k, v = i + 2j-k and w = 2i + 3j + 4k Find the volume of the tetrahedron.

(v x w) x (w x u) = (u.
(v x w)2 Solution Let a vector p = v x w Then p x (w x u) = w (p. u) - (p. w) Substitute p = v x w to get, (u x w) x (w x u) = w (v x w. u) – u (v x w. w) = w (u. v x w) – u (u. w x w) = w (u. v x w) And so you have, (w x v).
(v x w) x (w x u) = (u x v).
w ( u. v x w) = (u x v. w) (u. v x w) = (u. v x w).

You refer to the sets of vectors u, v and w, and u, v and w as reciprocal sets of systems of vectors if u. u = v. v1= w. w1= 1 and u1.
v = u1.
w = v1.u = v1.
w = w1.
u = w1.
v = 0 In other words, the dot product of reciprocal sets of vectors is 1.
You can easily remember this by recalling that the product of a number and its multiplicative inverse e.g.
(cid:1) x 3/ is 1, the multiplicative identity.
2 You can also use the cross product to define the reciprocal sets of vectors.
The sets u v w and u1, v1 and w1 are reciprocal sets of vectors if and only if u' = v x w v' = w x u and w' = u x v u. v x w u. v x w u. v x w Where u. v x w ≠ 0.
You should take note of the denominators, which are all the same and are the box product of the vectors.

You should, however be very careful which product you are involved with, and so what formula to use.
The necessary and sufficient condition for the vectors u, v and w to be coplanar is that u.v x w = 0.
The scalar triple products u.v x w can be interpreted by you as the components of u along v x w. To complete the vector algebra, you were given the sets of vectors reciprocal to a given set of vectors, just like the inverse of a number in the Real number system.
