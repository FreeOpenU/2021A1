6 ivIntroduction This course calculus I, which is also known as differential calculus, is the first of the two calculus courses that will be offered by all 100 level students wishing to have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, chemistry) physics, mathematics education, physics education, chemistry education, social sciences, computer science and computer science education.
This course could serve as a reference course for all who wish to model real life situations that will involve optimization or predication of resource or commodities.
A vary good starting point is to ask you to attempt to provide an answer to this question "what is calculus" calculus is the word used in the Roman empire to describe a little pebble that was used in counting.
But today the word is used to describe that branch of mathematics that extends the basic concept of elementary algebra and geometry into a new tool used in solving a variety of real-life problems.
Calculus is now one of the important mathematical tools in solving most work of life.
For example you could use it in the prediction of the orbit of earth satellites, in study of inertial navigation systems and radar systems.
In the modeling of economy, social and psychological behavior calculus is widely used.
Calculus is useful in solving problems in the field of business, biology, medicine, animal husbandry and political science.
The history of discovery of differential calculus could be traced back to 2nd half of the seventeenth century, when Sir Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727) was able to explain the motion of the planets about the sun as a consequent of the result known today as the Law of gravitational attraction.
In 1675 a German Mathematician Gottfried Whilhem Leibniz (1646 - 1716) introduced the famous and basic notation dx andds which you will use in this course and the second course respectively.
Other mathematicians since then have contributed to the growth and development of differential calculus among such are Bernoulli of Busel, Taylor, Lagrange and Maclaurin.
This course will consist of ten units divided into 2 modules.
In the first module you shall be introduced to basic mathematical concepts such as real numbers functions, units and continuity.
Differentiating a function from first principles is shield in the first module.
In the second module you will acquire techniques of differentiation of functions such Sin x, Cos x, Log x, ex, Cosh x, Sinh x, arc sinh x, arc cosh x, and arcsinh x. you will also apply these techniques in sketching the graph of curves, solving problems of minimization and maximization of values of functions, finding rates at which quantity vary deriving the formula for the equation of tangent and Normal to curves at a given point and MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS evaluation of the velocity and acceleration of a moving body in a give interval of time.

Basics properties of real numbers is the first topic or concept you are required to study in this course.
There are reasons among others why real numbers should be the first topic to study in this course.
Firstly numbers are very important in all calculations, a fact you are already familiar with Secondly, the properties of numbers is very essential to the development of calculus.
Lastly, all the topics in mathematics that you will be required to study during your programme will involve the use of some properties of real numbers.
1MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS In view of the above you should endeavor to carefully study all the topics covered in this unit and as well as complete all assignment Materials learnt in this unit will help you in understanding all other topics you will learn throughout this course.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading through this unit you should be able to: 1.
List correctly all types of numbers 2.
Recall 3 basic axioms of a real number system 3.
Identify all types of intervals 4.
Define 4 properties of absolute value of a real number 5.
Define a bounded set.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Sets When you collect items of similar characteristics or functions together, you could say that you have a ‘set of such items’.
For example, you can have a set of books, a set of furniture, a set of dissecting instruments etc.
Therefore you could define a set as a collection of distinct (definite distinguishable) objects which are selected by means of certain rules or description.
Hence a set is a mathematical concept used to describe a list, collection or a class of objects, figures etc.
The objects in the list or collections are called elements or members of the set Example of Sets 1) The students of national Open University 2) {1,2,3,4...... }Set of Natural Numbers 3) The set of stalls in a market Sets are denoted by single capital letters A, B, C etc.
or by the use of braces, for example, {a, b, c} denotes the set having a, b, and c as members or elements.
You will now be introduced to some specific sets, and symbols associated with them which you will likely use throughout this course 2MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Specific Sets Symbols Statements 1.Null or Empty set ø It is a Set which has no member.
2.
An element of Set α˛ A a is an element of A 3.
Not an element of bˇ A b is not an element of A 4.
Universal Set largest Set containing all elements પ under considerations (largest Set containing all Sets).
5.
Subset A(cid:204) B A is a subset of B or BcA (each element of A also belong to B).
Specific Sets Symbols Statements 6.
Proper Subset A(cid:204) B A is a proper subset of B (A is subset of B) A\B B has at least one element Which is not in A.
7.
Union of Sets A¨ B This is the set of all elements which belong to A or B i.e: AVB = {x : x E A or x(=-BI 8.
Intersection of Sets A∩B This is the set of all element which belong to A and B both i.e; A(V= {x:xcA and xEB} SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Look around where you are right now identify 10 different objects.

Decoration etc.
Classify each of the identified objects.
3MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.2 Real Numbers You will continue the introduction to the course for differential calculus with the study of real numbers.
You are already familiar with the following types of real numbers.
i.
Natural Numbers The set of positive whole number/1,2,3,4,....., are called natural numbers.
The letter N is used to denote the set of natural numbers.
These numbers are used extensively for counting processes.
For example, they are used in counting elements of a set.
You can represent this numbers as N= {X:X =1,2,3,...) set of.
ii.
Integers Next in line to the set of Natural Numbers is another set that makes subtraction possible i.e, it allows you to find the solution to a simple equation as x + 2 = 6.
This set is derived by adding the set of negative numbers and zero to the set of Natural numbers.
It is called the set of integers and it is denoted by the letter Z or I.
Hence the set of integers is given as Z = {x:x = ..., -3 -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ---} iii.
Rational Numbers You can see a gradual building up process in the various stages of development of numbers.
That is, in order for you to be able to carry out division and multiplication correctly, you need to enrich or add a new set of numbers to the set of integers.
So that you will be able to find a solution to equations like 2x = 3.
Therefore if we add the set of Negative and positive fractions to the set of integers we get a new set of numbers called the set of Rational Numbers.
The word `rational' is from the word ratio.
Since 2:1 = 2/1 and 1:2 = ½.
Set of rational numbers could be given as that number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers of the form p/q, where p and q are relatively prime integers, i.e; p and q have no common division other than 1.
The set of rational number is denoted by the letter Q.
4MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS iv.
Irrational Numbers A number which is not rational is irrational.
Irrational numbers are not expressible as p/q.
The set of irrational is denoted by the letter IQ Examples of such numbers are √2,√3, √7 log P , etc.
The above number can be written as infinite decimal i.e; or decimal that does not repeat itself.
Rules Governing Addition of Number Given that a,b, and c belong to the set R of real numbers then; A1.
R is closed under addition a+b ˛ R ( This implies that the sum of any two real number must be a real number) A2.
Addition is commutative a+b = b+a A3.
Addition is associative (a+b}+c= a+(b+c) A4.
Existence of additive identity 0+a= a+0 = a (i.e; 0 is the additive identity) A5.
Existence of additive inverse a+b = b+a = 0 (i.e; corresponding to each a˛ R there is b˛ R such that a+b = 0 → b = -a) similar to the rules for addition you have those for multiplication, still assuming that a, b and c R the.
MI.
R is closed under multiplication.
If as ˛ R (i.e the product of any two real numbers is a real numbers) M2.
Multiplication is commutative cb = bc M3.
Multiplication is associative (bc) = (ab) c 5MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS M4.
Existence of multiplicative identity -a.
1 = 1.a = a (1 is the multiplication identity) M5.
Existence of multiplication inverse ab = ba = 1 (i.e; corresponding to each a˛ R a 0, there is b˛ R b=a-' such that b=a-1 D1 Multiplication is distributive over addition a(b+c) = a.b + a.c The set of real numbers combined by means of the two band operations namely addition (+) and multiplication (.)
as expressed above forms a field.
The above rule Al-A5, M1M5 and D1 are known as the field axioms.
Because of the field axioms satisfied by elements of the set of real number, the set R is a field.
Question: Is the set of rational numbers a field?
The third axiom possessed by the set of real numbers is the axiom of order.
Thus there exist an ordering relation between any two elements of the set of real number.
The relation is denoted by the symbol > or < which is read as `greater than' or `less than'.
If a-b =0 then a=b or b=a.
If a-b then a>b or b<a.
The properties of the order axiom will be stated based on `>' (the ones based on < are implied) v. Real Numbers The union of the set of rational (Q) and irrational (IQ) form the set of real number.
It is denoted by the letter R. You can visualize the development of real numbers system in a flow chart below: 6MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS REAL NUMBER R Rational number Irrational Number Q IQ Integer Z Natural Number N In symbols we have this relationship NCZ - CQ, Q ˙ I Q = O and Q ¨ I Q = R N (cid:204) Z (cid:204) Q, Q ˙ I Q = ˘ , Q U I Q = R From the above relationship what can you say about the following statements?
1.
All integers are natural numbers 2.
All rational numbers are real numbers 3.
Some rational numbers are natural numbers 4.
Not all real numbers are rational numbers 5.
All natural numbers are irrational numbers.
3.3 Basic Axioms of Real Numbers You are already familiar with the four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of real numbers.
From the last section you noticed that each arithmetic operation is directly or indirectly involved in the stages of the built-up of the structure of real numbers.
This built up is derived from a set of fundamental axioms or truths which is turn are used to deduce other mathematical results or formulation.
Such axioms are categorized into the following.
For example; The extend axiom says that the set of real numbers has at least two distinct elements Next is how any two or more elements of the set of real numbers could be added.
You must be familiar with addition.
You will now see that addition of two or more real numbers is carried out under some specific rules.
7MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS i.
If a, b and c belong to R then the law of trichotomy holds.
Either a>b, a=b or b>a ii.
If a>b and b>c then a>c (i.e.
; `>' is transctive) iii.
If a>b then a+c > b+c (i.e; addition is monotone) iv.
If a>b and c>o then ac>bc (i.e.
; multiplication is monotone) Remark: If a˛ R and a>o then a is said to be positive.
If on the other hand a<o then a is said to be negative.
If a = 0 then a is to be non-negative.
* So far you have studied.
Open Interval If a < b 3.4 Interval and Absolute Value In this section you will continue the study of properties of real number by reviewing the concept of the real number line.
After which you will be introduced to what an interval is and how a solution set of an inequality could be represented as a set of point in an interval.
Real numbers can be represented as points on a line called the real axis or number line.
There is one-to-one correspondence between the members of the set of real numbers and the set of points on the number line.
Commonly known to you is the fact that the set of real numbers to the right of 0 is called the set of positive numbers, while the set of real numbers to the left of 0 is called the set of negative numbers.
0 is neither positive nor negative.
√2 I I O I I I -4 -1 1 3 Figure 1: Showing the number line.
Remark: The one-to-one correspondence between the real numbers and the points of the number line makes it possible for us to use point and members interchangeably.
8MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Definition of an Interval Let ab˛ R and a<b then the set of all real numbers contained between a and b is called an interval, these two real numbers a and b, Bare, referred to as the end points of the interval .
Open Interval If a<b then the set of real numbers specified by the inequalities{x: a<x <b} is called an open interval and is denoted by (a, b) have a and b are not member of this set of real number.
Closed Interval If a<b, then the set of real numbers specified by the inequalities (x: a≤x≤b} is called a closed interval and is denoted by [a,b].
All points between a and b as well as a and b belong to this set [â;b].
Half Open or Half Closed Interval The set specified by the inequalities.
{x:a≤x<b} or {x:a<x≤b} is called half open or half closed interval and is denoted by [a,b) or (a,b].
Infinite Interval The set of all numbers less than or equal to a given number c or the set of numbers greater than or equal to a given number c is called an infinite interval i.e the set{x:a≥c} = [c, a ) {x:x≤c}= [-a , c) {x:x˛ R}= [-a , a ) {x:x>c}= [c, a ) {x:x<c}= [-a , c) 3.5 Bounded Sets You will now learn about bounded sets and use it to identify intervals that are bounded or unbounded Upper Bounds.
9MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Upper Bound Lets S be a non-empty subset of R. If there exist a number K˛ R such that x≤k, for all x˛ S then the set S is said to be bounded above.
And K is known as an Upper bound.
Supremum If there is a least member among the set of Upper bounds of the set S, this member is called Least Upper Bound (LUB) or Supremum of the set S and is denoted as Sup.
S. Example: Given that, S={1, 3, -1, -2, 4, 10} i) List 4 Upper bounds for S ii) Identify the Supremum for S Solution From the definition above any number K such that xc-s and x≤k, is an Upper bound i.e.
K= {10,11,12, 13,) The least among the k's is 10 therefore the Sup S = 10 Example let (i) S={x:x = 2} Then Sup.
S = 2 why?
Lower Bounds Let S be non-empty subset R. if length of Interval The number (b-a) is called the length of the interval (a,b), and [a,b] You are familiar with inequalities and you could recall that to solve an inequality is to find the set of numbers that satisfy it.
Inequalities play such an important role in calculus, that is imperative that you know how to use the concept of interval to represent the set of solutions that satisfy a given inequalities.
Example: Solve the inequality 2-2x≥4 Solution: 2 (1-x)≥4 (divide by 2) 10MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 1- ≥2 (subtracted 1) x≥- 1 (multiplied by - 1) Solution in set is given in the interval [ -l, a ) SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Solve the following inequalities: i.
3x -3 ≥ 9 ii.
4x – 8 ≥ 10 iii.
4x – 7 ≥ -10 Absolute Value You are familiar with the distance between zero and a point on the number line.
You are equally aware that length or distance cannot have a negative value.
Let the distance between 0 and a be denoted by the symbol.
(cid:231) a(cid:231) (cid:231) x(cid:231) = distance between 0 and x (cid:231) a-b(cid:231) = distance between a and b or b and a therefore (cid:231) a(cid:231) >0.
You can define the absolute value of a number x as the distance between the point x and zero which satisfy the following conditions: i.
(cid:231) x(cid:231) = x if x > 0. ii.
(cid:231) x(cid:231) = x if x < 0 iii.
(cid:231) x(cid:231) = 0 if x = 0 Example: (cid:231) -3(cid:231) = 3 (cid:231) 3(cid:231) = 3 (cid:231) 0(cid:231) = 0 The relation (cid:231) k(cid:231) = x, x>0 is equivalent to the relation -x ≤k≤x (cid:222) k˛ [-x, x] 11MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Some properties of Absolute value: l. (cid:231) a(cid:231) = a = (cid:231) -a(cid:231) 2.
(cid:231) ab(cid:231) = (cid:231) a(cid:231) (cid:231) b(cid:231) 3.
(cid:231) a(cid:231) 2= a 2 4.
(cid:231) a+b(cid:231) ≤(cid:231) a(cid:231) +(cid:231) b(cid:231) triangle inequality 5.
(cid:231) a- b(cid:231) ≥ (cid:231) 1a(cid:231) - (cid:231) b1(cid:231) *Remark Properties 3 and 4 imply that the sum of the length of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the length off the third side.
Example: Show that: i.
(cid:231) a+b(cid:231) ≤(cid:231) a(cid:231) +(cid:231) b(cid:231) ii.
(cid:231) a+b(cid:231) ≥ (cid:231) 1a(cid:231) -(cid:231) b1(cid:231) Solution: l.

*Remark: The supremum of a set if it exists is unique.
The same applies to infimum of a set in other wards there cannot two distinct elements called the Sup S. Examples: given the set s = (-4, -3, -1, 0, 2) i. list 5 lower bounds of set S ii.
identify the infimum Solution: i. let k be the set of lower bound of s then k = (-10, -6, -8, -5, -4) ii.
the greatest member of set k is -4.
Therefore inf S =-4.
Bounded Set Let S be a non-empty subset of R. if there exist a number k˛ R such that (cid:231) x(cid:231) =x for all x ˛ s then the set S is said to be bounded.

16MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS UNIT 2 BASIC PROPERTIES OF REAL NUMBERS CONTENTS 2.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Definitions of a Function 3.2 Representation of Function 3.3 Basic Elementary Functions 3.4 Individuals and Absolute Value 3.5 Transcendental Functions 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION The concept of functions and its corresponding definition as well as its properties are very crucial to the study of calculus.
Simple observation of any physical phenomena has made it imperative for us to be interested in how variable objects are related.
For example, you are familiar with how distance traveled by a body freely falling in a vacuum is related to the time of the fall or how the concentration of a medicine in the blood stream is related to the length of time between doses, or how the area of a circle is related to the to the radius of the circle.
The types of relationship between two variables in this unit will be considered, also the study of the concept of a function is very important since the properties of functions -are what you will use whenever you want to find the derivative of a function.
It is important you study carefully and diligently all the various types of functions and their characterization.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to 1.
Define a function 2.
Identity all types of functions 3.
State the domain and range of a function 4.
Combine functions to form a new function.
17MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definitions of a Function You will start the study of this unit with the definitions of a function and its various forms of representation.
Definition 2.1 A function is a rule which establishes a relationship between twosets.
Suppose X and Y are two sets, a function f from X to Y is a rule which attributes to every member x˛ X a unique member y˛ Y and it is written as f : X→ Y (which reads `f is a function from X to Y) The set X is called the domain of the function, while the set Y is called the co-domain of the function.
Another definition of a function is given below as: Definition 2.2 A variable y= f (x) (in words f (x) reads f' of x) is to function of a variable x in the domain X of the function if to each value of x˛ X there corresponds a definite value of the variable y˛ Y.
Basically every function is determine by two things: (1) the domain of the first variable x and (2) the rule or condition the set of ordered pairs (x,y) must satisfy to belong to the function.
You will have a better understanding of the definitions above after going through the following examples.
Example 1 Let the domain of x be the set X={-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} Assign to each value of X the number; Y= 2x The function so defined is the set of pairs (-2, -4), (-1,-2), (0,0), (1,2) and (2,4) 18MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example 2 f : N→Z, defined by f (x) =1-x is a function since the rule f (x)=1-x assigns a every member x˛ N to a unique member of the set Z.
Z is a set of integers.
Example 3 If to each number in the set x˛ (-1, 2) we associates a number y = x2 +1 then the correspondences between x and x2 +1 defines a function.
3.2 Representations of Function In the above definition of a function you were introduced to the concept of a domain .From the definition of a function ,the domain of a function could be defined as the set of value for which a function is defined.
The independent variable x is a member of the domain.
The dependant variable y that corresponds to a particular x-value is called the image of the x-value.
The set of value taken by the independent variable y is called the range of the function.
The range is the image of the domain.
Any method of representation of function must indicate the domain of the function and the rule that the ordered pairs (x,y) must satisfy in order to belong to the function> In this unit you will study two basic methods of representing a function namely: 1.
Analytical method (i.e.
; representation by means of a mathematics formula) 2.
Graphical method 1.
Analytical Representation This is given by a formula which shows you how the value of the function corresponding to any given value of the independent value can be determined.
Example refer to example 5.5. in Unit 5.
The formulas y=x2 +1 and y = 3-x specify y as a function of x.
In the above example the domain of the function is assumed to be a subset of R for which the formula, representing the function makes sense.
19MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 2.
Graphical Representation A function is easily sketched by studying the graph of the function.
In unit .... you would be required to plot the graphs of certain function so materials of this section will be useful to you then.
Let us define what a graph of a function is Definition 4.
The graph of the function define by y= f (x) is the set of points in a rectangular plane whose co-ordinate pairs are also the ordered pairs (x,y) or [x, f(x)] of the function.
Another way you can view the above definition is to look at the steps of describing or drawing the graph of the function y = f (x) .
To do this you choose a system of coordinate axes in the x-y plane.
For each x˛ X, the ordered pair [x, f (x)] determines a point in the plane (see fig.
1) Y [x,ƒ(x)] ,ƒ(x) O X Fig.
1.
You will come across graphs of each type function that will be considered in this unit, the role each graph plays in understanding their respective functions will then become clearer to you.
3.3 Basic Elementary Functions You will continue the study of function by considering the various types of functions and their graphs 20MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 1.
Constant Functions The simplest function to study is the constant functions.
A constant function have only one constant value y for all values of belonging to the domain.
i.e.
,ƒ(x)= a for all x˛ X where X is the domain of the function (see fig 2) You noticed that the graph of a constant function is a straight line parallel to the x- axis.
Y a ,ƒ(x) = a * X O Fig.
2 In fig.2.
,ƒ(x) =a is a graph parallel to the x-axis at a distance (cid:231) a(cid:231) units from the x-axis.
2.
Polynomial Function 1.
Any function that can be expressed as .
,ƒ(x)) = a xn + a xn-1+ a xn-2 + -----+ o 1 2 x + a (A) n-1 n where a , ,,, a ........ a , are constant coefficients is called a 1 1 n polynomial function of n degree.
You can derive various forms of functions with different graphs by varying the value of n. 21MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example 1 - If you substitute n =1 into expression (A) above you get a linear function i.e., .
ƒ(x) = a x+ a o 1 The graph is in Fig.
3a.
2.
If you put n=2 in expression a you get a quadratic functions.
i.e.
ƒ(x) = a x2+ a x + a o 1 2 See Fig 3b.
3.
If you substitute n=3 into expression (A) you get a cubic function i.e.
ƒ(x) = a x3+ a x2 + a x + a o 1 2 3 You could continue this process as much as you want.
Y ƒ(x) = x2 a = 1 o (a = a ) = 0) 1 2 X ƒ(x) = x - 1 (a = 1 ) o (a = -1) 1 Y 22MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS -1 1 X -1 get equate for MathCAD 3.
Identify Function There is a function that assigns every member of the set domain to itself.
Let X be domain of the function then ,ƒ(x) = x for all x˛ X.
In some other textbooks identify function are denoted as Ix.
The graph of an identity function is a straight line passing through the origin (see Fig 4) Y X Fig 4 4.
Algebraic Function 23MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS When two polynomial are combined together to construct a function of this form.
P(x) = a xn+.....+ a o n Q(x) b xm+.....+ b o m The above function is called a rational algebraic function.
Example ,ƒ(x) = 2x x - 1 3.4 Transcendental Function This is a. class of functions that do not belong to the class of algebraic functions discussed above.
They are very useful in describing or modeling physical phonemic.
Therefore you need to study them because they will be needed in the subsequent units.
1.
The Exponential Function A function ,ƒ(x) = ax where a > 0 and a – 1 is called an exponential function.
A special case of an exponential function is where a = e i.e.
,ƒ(x) = ex this function is know as the natural exponential function.
Its graph is shown in Fig.
5 Y Y =℮X 3 - ` 2 - 1 - O -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 Fig.
5.
2.
Logarithm Function 24MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Any function ,ƒ(x) which has the property that: fƒ(x, y) =,ƒ(x) + ,ƒ(y) for all x, y > 0 is called a logarithm function Example: Let ,ƒ(x) be a logarithm function then ƒ(1) = ƒ(1 .
1) = ƒ (I) + ƒ (1)= 2ƒ (1) (cid:222) ƒ (1) = 2ƒ (I) (cid:222) ƒ (I)=0 for x > 0 ƒ (l) = ƒ (x .1/x ) = ƒ (x) + ƒ (1/x) = 0 (cid:222) ƒ (1/x) = - ƒ (x).
Let x > 0 and y > 0 then ,ƒ(y/x)= ,ƒ(y-1/x)= ƒ (y) + ƒ (1/x) Since ,ƒ(1/x) = - ,ƒ(x) then ,ƒ(y/x) = ,ƒ(y) - ƒ(x) Let ,ƒ(x) = log x.
Then log (x/y) = log x - log y.
And log (y/x) = log y - log x. Log (1/x) = - log x.
2.
The Natural Logarithmic Function The ,ƒ(x) = Ln (x) where x ± 0 Is called the natural logarithmic function.
Its graph is shown in fig.
6.
(this function derived its definition from calculus see unit...) 25MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS X 0 1 2 3 4 3.
The Trigonometric Function The function define as: ,ƒ(x) = Sinx, ,ƒ(x) = Cos x,,ƒ(x) = tanx.
,ƒ(x) =Cot x, ,ƒ(x) = Cosec x, and ƒ(x) =Sec x. are called trigonometric functions.
4.
Inverse Trigonometric Functions The function define as ƒ(x) Sin -1-x, ,ƒ(x) =Cos-lx,,ƒ(x) = tan-lx.
are called inverse trigonometric functions.
5.
Hyperbolic Functions There are classes of function that can be form by combing the exponential function.
For example: ,ƒ(x) =℮ X +℮ -X = Cosh x 2 ,ƒ(x) =℮ X - ℮ -X = Sinh x 2 These functions are very useful in computing the tension at any point in high-tension cables you see in some of the highways across the country.
They are also important in solving some 26MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS classes of problems in calculus.
The rules governing them are like that of the trigonometric functions.
The functions: Cosh x = 1/2(℮ X +℮ - X ) (cash reads gosh x) and Sinh x = 1/2 (℮ X +℮ - X ) ( sinh reads cinch x) may be identified with coordinates of point (x,y) on the unit hyperbola x2-y2 = A Recalled that the functions sin x and cos x with the point (x, y) on the unit circle x3 + y2 = 1 in some text trigonometric functions are called circular functions.
So the name hyperbolic is formed from the word hyperbola.
Other hyperbolic functions like tanh x, Coth x, Sech x, and Cosech x can be derived from cosh x and sinh x.
6.
Inverse Hyperbolic Functions The functions Y= sinh-l x, Y = Cosh-Ix, are called inverse hyperbolic functions.
Others are Y= tanh-l x, Y= Cech-lx, Y=Cosech-lx, 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you have studied the definitions of a function.

In other words a function is investigated by characterization of its variation (or its behaviour) as the independent variable changes.
The classification of the variety of function is very vast.
The following types defined in this unit is by no means this unit you continue the study of functions by considering special features that` characterize a function.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Types of Functions Zero of a function: The value of x for which a function vanishes, that is for which f(x) = 0 is called The Zero (or root) of the function.
29MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example la.
The function ,ƒ(x) = x2-3x+2 has two roots i.e.
; x=2 or 1.
One of the roots of the function.
,ƒ(x) = x3-2x2 - 5x + 6 is 1.
i.e., ,ƒ(1) = 13 - 2.12 - 5.1 + 6 = 0 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Find other roots of the above function.
1.
Even and Odd Functions A function y =,ƒ(x) is said to be even, if the changes of the sign of any value of the independent variable does not affect the value of the function.
F(-x) _ F(x) .
i. e, ƒ(-x) = ,ƒ(x) " x˛ X A function y = ,ƒ(x) is said to be odd if the change of sign of any value of the independent variable results in the change of the sign of the function i.e.
; ƒ(-x) = -,ƒ(x) Example The function y = x2 is an even function while the function y = sin x and y = x3 are odd functions.
Remark: Arbitrary functions such as y = x +1, y = 2 sin x + 3 Cos x can of course be neither even nor odd.
2.
Periodic Function A function y = ,ƒ(x) is said to be periodic if there exists a number n „ 0 such that for any x belonging to the domain of the function the values x + n of the independent variable also belonging to the domain of the function and the identity.
,ƒ(x + n) = ,ƒ(x) holds where n is called the period of the function.
1 30MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example If ,ƒ(x) is a periodic function with period n the ƒ(x + n) =,ƒ(x + 2n) = ,ƒ(x) Generally for any periodic function ƒ (x) with period n. ƒ (x + nk) = ƒ (x)for any x˛ Z, k˛ N, A simple example of a periodic function is the function ƒ(x) =s i nx or ƒ(x) Cosx.

Monotonic Functions A function is said to be monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing within a given interval.
The study of monotonic function is an important concept in the application of calculus, this will be treated in the last two units of this course.
You will now consider explicit definitions of a monotonic increasing function and monotonic decreasing function within a given interval.
31MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Definition l: A function ƒ(x) is said to be monotonic increasing in an interval.
If x < x (cid:222) ƒ (x ) < ƒ(x ) 1 2 1 2 for any two points x1, x ˛ I, 2 If ƒ (x ) < ƒ (x ) then the function ƒ(x) is said to be strictly 1 2 increasing.
Definition 2:A function ƒ (x) is said to be monotonic decreasing in an interval I If x < x (cid:222) ƒ (x ) > ƒ(x ) 1 2 1 2 for any two points x1, x ˛ I 2 If ƒ (x ) > ƒ (x ) then the function ƒ(x) is said to be strictly 1 2 increasing.
Example The function y = x2 is monotonic decreasing in the interval (- ∞ , 0] and monotonic increasing in the interval [0, ∞ ).

32MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Determine whether the following functions are monotonic increasing or decreasing in the interval (o, ∞ ): i. ƒ (x) = 2x ii.
ƒ (x) = 2-x iii.
ƒ (x) = 23 iv.
ƒ (x) = 2 4.
Bounded Functions Recall the definition of a bounded set defined in Unit 2.
You will now use the same concept to define a bounded function.
If a function ƒ(x) assumed on a given interval I a value M which is greater than all other values ( i.e.
; ƒ(x) < M for all x˛ I) then the function f (x) is said to be bounded above.
The M is called the greatest value of the function ƒ(x) at that interval I.
Similarly, if there is a constant M such that all other values of the functions is greater than (i.e.
; ƒ (x) >M for all x˛ 1) then we say that ƒ (x) is bounded below and the value M is called the least value of the function ƒ (x) in I.
Definition of a Bounded Function: A function f (x) is said to be bounded in an interval 1.
If there exists a number k˛ R such that ƒ(x) K for all x˛ I y Lvle alternatively, if given M, ƒ (x) > M in the interval I we say ƒ (x) in bounded, below Example 1 The function ƒ (x) = 2x+1 is bounded in the interval [-2,2] i.e ƒ(-2) ƒ(2) is bounded in the interval (-2, 2).
2.
The function ƒ(x) = 2x2-3x+2 is bounded in the interval x˛ [o,2] SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 33MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Determine whether the following function are bounded in the given intervals.
i. ƒ (x) = x2 – 4x + 4 x˛ (-∞, ∞ ).
ii.
ƒ (x) = x2 – 4x + 4 x˛ (2, 10).
iii.
ƒ (x) = 2 + x + x2 x˛ (-1, 2 ).
3.2 Inverse Function Domain and Range: since the domain and range will be useful in the study of inverse of a function you have to briefly review the concept as you have studied the fact that one of the ways a function can be determined is through the domain of the function i.e.
the set containing the first variable for which a function makes sense.
You shall consider some few examples of domain of a given function.
Example i.
Given the function ƒ (x) =X2, x is a real number.
Here the domain of ƒ is the set of all real numbers.
The range is therefore R+ = [o, ∞ ).
In symbols you write.
D= {x: x˛ R} and R = [y; y˛ R+}.
ii.
Given the function ƒ (x) =x -1 , x is a real number.
Here the domain of ƒ is the set of all real numbers greater than 1.
i.e.
; D = {x: x >1 } Since any other value of x will result to the square root of a negative number which does not make sense in the set of real numbers.
The range R = {y : y˛ R+} iii.
Given the function ƒ (x ) = ___1___ = _____1__ the domain x2-1 (x-1) (x+1) D = { x : x˛ R, x ≠ - 1 or 1}.
If x = -1 or 1 the value of the function will be meaningless.

Let the function f assign to each state in Nigeria its capital city.
State the domain of f and its range.
You will continue the study in this section by giving definitions of certain features of functions.
(there have been kept purposely for this moment.)
1.
Onto Functions Let the function y = ƒ (x) with domain of definition X {i.e.
the admissible set of values of x) and the range Y (the set of the corresponding values of y).
Then a the function y = ƒ(x) is an Onto function if to each point or element of set there corresponds a uniquely determined point (or element) of the set Y, i.e., if every point in set Y is the image of at least one point in set X.
Example: consider the function shown in fig 11 ƒ ƒ a x a y b y b c y (A) (B) Fig 11.
The function Fig.

The function in Fig.
(B) is not an onto function Example: The function ƒ (x) = x2 is an Onto function SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 5 Give reason why the function in the Fig.
(a) above is an onto function and the other one in Fig(b) is not.

One-to-One Function Let the function y = ƒ(x) be an onto function.
If in addition each point (or element) of set X corresponds to one and only one point (or element) of set Y then the function y = ƒ(x) is said to be one to one function.
Example The function y =x2 is an onto function and not a one to one function.
Whereas the function y = x3 is an onto function as well as a one to one function (see fig 12) y y = x3 0 x Fig 12.

(b) In fig.

Y = x3 is one to one function.
In Fig.
12.
(b) the horizontal lines intersects the graph in more than one point thus the ƒ(x) = x2 is not a one to one function.
3.3 Composite Functions Generally functions with a common domain can be added and subtracted.
That is, if the functions ƒ (x) and g(x) have the same domain.
Then: (f ± g) (x) = ƒ(x) ± g (x) Example: Let ƒ (x) = x2 and g(x) = 3x - 2 Then ƒ (x) + g(x) = x2 + 3x - 2 The above concept can be extended to the case of multiplication.
i.e.
; given that ƒ (x) and g(x) have the same domain then ƒg (x) = ƒ(x) g(x).
Using the above example we have that: ƒ(x) g(x) = x2 (3x - 2) = 3x3 -2x2 Division is also allowed between functions having the same domain.
Let ƒ (x) = 2x and g(x) = x - 1 37MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Then; ƒ (x) = 2x g(x) x-1 There is another way function can be combined which is quite different from the ones described above.
In this case two function ƒ (x) and g(x) are combined by first finding the range of ƒ (x) and making it the domain of g(x).
This idea is shown in fig 13. g ﴾(x) ƒ(x) g(x) X Y Z The function you get by first applying ƒ to x and then applying g to ƒ (x) is given as g ﴾(x) and called the composition of g and ƒ and is denoted by the symbol g o ƒ ( which reads g circle ƒ ) i.e.
; (go ƒ) (x) = g ﴾(x)) Example 1.
Given that ƒ (x) = 1/x and g(x) = x2 + 1 ƒog= ƒ ﴾g(x)) = ____x___ x2 +1 goƒ= g o ﴾ (x)) = 1/x2 + 1.
= __ x 2 + 1 ___ x2 2.
Given that ƒ(x) = x2 and g(x) = x + 1 goƒ = g ƒ﴾(x)) = x2 + 1 38MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ƒog = ƒ﴾g (x)) = (x + 1) 2 = x2 + 2x + 1 In the two examples above you can easily conclude that goƒ ≠ ƒog The composition of functions can be extended to three or more functions.
Example Let ƒ (x) = x - 1, g(x) = x2 + 1,h(x) = 2x.
Then hogo ƒ = h (go ƒ) = h ﴾g ﴾(x)) ) =2 (x- 1)2 + 1) = 2x2 – 4x +4 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 6 Give that ƒ (x) = x, g(x)=x-1, h(x) = √x -1 Find the following composite functions.

A function that will have an inverse must fulfill the function, since the inverse function is a unique function in respect of the original function.

43MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS UNIT 4 LIMITS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Definitions of a Limit of a Function.
3.2 Properties of Limit of a Function 3.3 Right and Left Hand Limits 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the last units, you have been adequately introduced to the concept of a function In this unit you will be indorsed to the concept of the limit of a function.
This is one of the most important concept in the study of this course calculus.
Generally, it is believed that calculus begins with the idea of a limitations process.
The history behind the study of limits of function is an interesting one and it will be nice if you hear some of the story.
A French mathematician by name Joseph Lious Lag range (1736 - 1813) was among the first mathematicians that initiated the concept of limits.
This was followed by another French mathematician Augustine-Lious Cauchy (1789-1837) and a Czech priest by name Bernhard Bolzono (1781-1848).
However the present day definition of limit is largely due to the work of Heinrich Edward Heine and Karl Weiestrass.
In this unit an attempt to be a bit expansive in the study of the limit of functions will be made.
Therefore you should be more patient when studying the materials of this unit.
Bear in mind that discussions on the concept of limit of a function will easily be re-introduced into the concept of continuity of function in unit 4 and 5.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly; 1. define a limit of a function 44MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 2. show that the limit of a function is unique 3. evaluate the limit of a function 4. to evaluate the right and left hand of a function.
5. use the "˛ , d " method to prove that a number ℓ is the limit of a function at a given point.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Limit of a Function In this Section; you will begin the; concept of limit shall be studied by first presenting it in an informal and intuitive manner.
You are familiar with the word "limit".
It gives you the picture of a restriction or boundary.
For example consider a regular polygon with n sides inscribed in a circle.
As you increase the sides of the regular polygon then each side of the n-side regular polygon gets closer to the circumference of the circle.
Here if you consider sides of the polygon as the independent variable denoted by n and the shape of the regular polygon as the dependent variable then the shape of the n-sided regular polygon approaches the shape of the circle as n approaches infinity (see fig 13) Fig.
13.
In this case we say that the limit of inscribed n-sided regular polygon is the circle as n tends to ¥ .
Now consider the function ƒ (x) = x2 -1 what is the value of ƒ (x) when x is near 1 ?
In table 2.
X 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 ƒ (x) 1.
.99 .96 .91 .84 .75 .64 .51 .36 0.19 0 Table 1 45MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS X 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2 ƒ 2.61 0 .21 .44 .69 .96 1.25 1.56 1.89 2.24 3 (x) Table 2 You can see that as x gets closer and closer to 1 ƒ (x) approaches 0. so the value of ƒ (x) can be made to get closer to 0 by making x get closer to 1.
This is expressed by saying that as x tends to l, the limit of ƒ (x) is 0.
Another way is to start by noting that a function ƒ (x) could be observed to approach a given number L as x approaches a known value x .
That is o once a number ℓ is identified as x approaches x, without insisting that ƒ (x) must be defined at xo then we can write that Lim ƒ (x) = ℓ In other words we say that the limit of the function ƒ (x) as x approaches or tends to x,, is the number ℓ or as x tends to xo , ƒ (x) tends to ℓ or for x approximately equal to xo ƒ (x) is approximately equal to ℓ In the above definition you will observed that there are two important things to note namely.
1. the existence of the unique number ℓ , and 2. the fact that the function need not be defined at the point x .
o What is more important is that the function is defined near the number x o Consider the following example that will further explain the concept of limit.
ƒ (x) (x) = ℓ ƒ (x) O 46MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Fig.
14.
In fig(14), the curve represent the graph of ƒ (x) .
The number xo appears in the x-axis, the limit ℓ appears in the y-axis.
As x approaches x from either side (i.e.
; along the x-axis).
ƒ (x) approached ℓ along the o y-axis.
Examples: Find the limit of the functions as x 1 1. ƒ (x) = ___1__ x - 1 2. ƒ (x) = __1___ (cid:231) x- 1 (cid:231) 3. ƒ (x) = x 2 -1 x - 1 Solutions: 1. ƒ (x) =__1__ in the graph of ƒ (x) as x approaches 1.
(see graph below x - 1 Y X I From the right ƒ (x) becomes arbitrary large.
Larger than any pre-assigned positive number.
As x approaches curve from the left ƒ (x) becomes arbitrarily large negative-less than any pre- 47MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS assigned negative number.
In this case ƒ (x) cannot be said to approach any fixed number.
The above gives a clear picture where the limit of function does not exist as x approaches a given point for a fuller understanding, you will consider two more examples.
1. ƒ (x) =__1__ (see fig.
16) (cid:231) x- 1 (cid:231) I Fig.
16.
In fig.
16, as x approaches 1 from the left and the right 2. ƒ (x) becomes arbitrary large.
In this case 2. ƒ (x) becoming arbitrary large cannot approach any fixed number ℓ .
Therefore ƒ (x) =__1__ does not have a limit as x tends to 1.
(cid:231) x- 1 (cid:231) 2. ƒ (x) =_ x 3 - 1 __ (see table A & B below) x- 1 X 0 .1 .2 .5 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9 1 ƒ (x) 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2 Table A X 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2 ƒ (x) 0 .21 .44 .69 .96 1.25 1.56 1.89 2.24 2.61 3 Table B At a first glance ƒ (x) is not defined at the point x = 1, since division by zero is impossible.
Recall that in finding the limit of 48MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS function at a given point xo it is not required that ƒ (x) must be defined at xo.
The above is a clear example of functions having limits at points where they are not defined.
You will meet other examples of such function as you progress in this course.
In tables A & B the limit of the function as x tends to 1 is 2.
By direct evaluation you can simplify: ƒ (x) =_ x 3 - 1 __ as x- 1 ƒ (x) =_( x – 1)(x +1) = x + 1 x- 1 Therefore lim.
as x- 1 of ƒ (x) = x + 1 is 1 + 1 = 2.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Determine whether the function 1. ƒ (x) =_ x 2 - 4 2. ƒ (x) = 1__ x- 1 x- 2 have limits as x approaches 2.
If so, find the limits.
3.3 Properties of a Limits of a Function A formal definition of limit is hereby given.
Definition : The number ℓ is said to be the limit of the function y = f(x) as x tends to x if for any positive number ˛ > o (however small) we o can find some positive number d such that: (cid:231) fx- ℓ (cid:231) < ˛ whenever o < (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d o Using the above definition it can be shown that the limit of the function f(x) = 3x -1 is equal to 2 as x tends to 1.
To prove the above insufficient to show that for ˛ > o you can find d > o such that the inequalities: (cid:231) (3x- 1) - 2 (cid:231) < ˛ (cid:222) o < (cid:231) x- 1 (cid:231) < d is satisfied equivalently.
(cid:231) 3x- 1 - 2 (cid:231) = (cid:231) 3x- 3 (cid:231) = 3 (cid:231) x- 1 (cid:231) < ˛ 49MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (cid:222) (cid:231) x- 1 (cid:231) < ˛ /3 Since x must be near 1 as much as possible we chose d = ˛ /3.
Hence: x -1 < d = ˛ /3 , which is the required proof.
Remark: The definition above implies that the distance between f (x) and L must be small as much as the distance between x and x o is.
Recall that the absolute value of a number 1.1 is a distance function (see unit 1) The method of the proof used above is called the "˛ , d proof'” in this course you will get a better view about the definition if you go through another example when the graph of the function is shown with the limit indicated Examples: show that the limit of f (x) = x2 as x approaches (tends to ) 2, is ℓ=4 (Use the ˛ , d proof) Solution: In finding the solution to the above you have to show this: For any positive number ˛ > o you look for another positive number d > o such that the inequalities (cid:231) x2 - 4 (cid:231) < ˛ whenever o < (cid:231) x- 2 (cid:231) < d is satisfied Note that: (cid:231) x2 -4 (cid:231) = (cid:231) (x -2)(x+2) (cid:231) = (cid:231) x -2 (cid:231) (cid:231) x+2 (cid:231) is the product of a factor (cid:231) x +2 (cid:231) that is near 4 and a factor (cid:231) x -2 (cid:231) that is near 0 when x is near 2.
If x is required to stay within, say, 0.2 of 2 then you will have a situation like this: 2-0.2 < x < 0.2+2 = 1.8 x < 2.2 and 3.8 < x + 2 < 4.2.
As a result (cid:231) x2 - 4 (cid:231) 4.2(cid:231) x -2 (cid:231) Now 4.2 (cid:231) x -2 (cid:231) < ˛ proved (cid:231) x-2 (cid:231) < ˛ /4.2 50MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Therefore you could choose d , as the min {0.2 ˛ /4.2 } if you do then you will have that: (cid:231) x2 -4 (cid:231) < ˛ when 0 < (cid:231) x -2 (cid:231) < d See Fig.
17.
4 + ˛ 4 4 - ˛ 1 2- d 2 2 +d 3.4 Right And Left Hand Limits A function f (x): could have one limit as x approaches x from the right o and another limit as x approaches xo from the left.
Recall that in the above definitions of limits of function the word "arbitrarily close" was loosely used, to describe the approach of x to xo without indicating how x should approach xo how x should approach x .
If x approaches xo o from the right-hand side: i.e., for values of x > x you write that: x-3 x o o and for values of x < x you write x x o o and say that x approached x from the left hand side.
o Definition: If lim f (x) = ℓ and x x o where ℓ + is called the right hand limit of the function f (x) and L- is the left hand limit of the same function f (x) .
51MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Remark: If the limit of a function exists as x x then o lim f (x) = lim f (x) x x + x x + o o Example: Investigate the limit of the function defined by f(x) = -1.x < 0 1.x > 0 as x approaches 0.
Solution From the above f (x) = -1 for x < 0 (cid:222) x 0o f(x) = -I and x 0¥ f(x) =1 Thus lim f(x) does not exit.
Hence lim f(x) does not exist x x .
o An interesting function you would not like to miss when dealing with one-sided limits is the greatest - integer function defined as; [x] = greatest integer x 0 Example: Investigate the limit of the function F defined by: f (x) = [x] as x approaches (see Fig.
18) Y X -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 52MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Fig.
16.
In fig 16, the function is 0 at 0 and remain 0 to 1 jumps to 1 remain 4 throughout the interval [1,2).
At 2 the function jumps to 2 remain 2 in the interval [2,3) at 3 jumps to 3 and remains 3 in the interval [3,4) and so on.
To investigate the limit we take values less than 3 and values greater 3. f(x) = [x] = 3 " x ˛ [3, 4) f(x) = [x] = 2 " x ˛ [2, 3) Therefore: Lim f(x) = 2 x 3.
Lim f(x) = 3 x 3+.
Since lim f (x) „ lim f (x) x 3- x 3+ Then the lim f (x) does not exist x 3 Generally for the greatest -integer function: lim [x] =x and lim [x] = x - 1 o o x x + x x + o 0 Example: g(x) x2 x > 0 (cid:214) x x < 0 investigate the limit as x 0 Solution lim g(x) = 0 and lim g(x) = 0, hence lim g(x) = 0 x x + x x + x x 0 0 0 53MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS You shall now look at one of the most important properties of the limit of a function.
This is the uniqueness property.
Uniqueness: If the limit of a function f (x) exists as x approaches x it is o unique.
The above property is a theorem which you will be required to give the proof.
Example: Proof that if the limit of a function f (x) as x approaches x 0 exists it is unique.
Proof: Let lim f (x) = ℓ 1 x x 0 Another one for the same function f (x) be given as: lim f (x) = L 2 You will be required to show that: L = ℓ by providing that the assumption L „ L leads to absurd 2 1 2 1 result that: (cid:231) L - L (cid:231) (cid:231) L – L (cid:231) 2 1 2 2 By definition of limit: for any positive ˛ > 0 there is d > 0 1 1 (cid:231) f (x) - L (cid:231) < ˛ 1 1 when 0 < (cid:231) x– x (cid:231) < d o 1 and for ˛ > 0 there is d > 0 2 2 such that (cid:231) f (x) - L (cid:231) < ˛ 1 2 when 0 < (cid:231) x– x (cid:231) < d o 2 Let 0 < (cid:231) ℓ – ℓ (cid:231) = (cid:231) ℓ - f (x) + f (x) - ℓ L 1 o 2 2 (cid:231) (cid:231) ℓ – f (x) (cid:231) + (cid:231) f (x) - ℓ L (cid:231) (By triangle 2 2 inequalities) < ˛ + ˛ ) by definition above 1 2 54MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ˛ ½ (cid:231) ℓ – ℓ (cid:231) and ˛ ½ (cid:231) ℓ - ℓ (cid:231) 1 = 1 2 2= 1 2 Then ½ (cid:231) ℓ – ℓ (cid:231) < ˛ + ˛ 1 2 1 2 = ½ (cid:231) ℓ – ℓ (cid:231) + ½ (cid:231) ℓ – ℓ (cid:231) = (cid:231) L – L (cid:231) 1 2 1 2 1 2 (cid:231) L – L (cid:231) < (cid:231) ℓ – ℓ (cid:231) which is absurd or 1 2 1 2 contradictory.
Hence he assumption that ℓ „ ℓ is false.
1 2 Therefore ℓ = ℓ which is the required result.

You will begin by considering the following theorems on limits of functions Theorem 1: If lim ƒ(x) = ƒ and lim g(x) =g x x x x o o 57MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS then 1. lim [ƒ(x) + g(x)l = ƒ + g x x o 2. lim [x ƒ(x) = x ƒ x x o The proof of the (1) of the theorem will follow the pattern used in proving the uniqueness property.
Proof.
Let ˛ > 0.
To prove (1) above you must show that you can find d > 0 such that: If 0 < (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d then (cid:231) [ƒ(x) + g(x) – ([ƒ( + g)(cid:231) o Note that: (cid:231)ƒ (x) + g(x) – (ƒ + g)(cid:231) = (cid:231) {ƒ(x) - ƒ) + (g(x) – g)(cid:231) £ ƒ(cid:231) (x) - ƒ + (g(x) – g)(cid:231) (by triangle inequality) You will make ƒ(cid:231) (x) - g(x) – (ƒ + g)(cid:231) less than ˛ by making (cid:231)ƒ (x)- ƒ(cid:231) and (cid:231) g(x)- g(cid:231) each less than ½ ˛ > 0 Since ˛ > 0 this implies that ½ ˛ > 0 Since by the statement of the theorem lim ƒ(x)- ƒ and lim g(x)- g x x x x o o therefore there will exist two number d >0 and d >0 such that 1 2 If 0 < (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d then ƒ(cid:231) (x)- ƒ(cid:231) < ½ ˛ o 1 and If 0 < (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d then (cid:231)ƒ (x) - ƒ (cid:231) < ½ ˛ and (cid:231) g(x)- g(cid:231) > o 2 ½ ˛ 58MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Now set ƒd = minimum of d andd 1 2 Therefore ƒ(cid:231) (x) - g(x) – (ƒ + g)(cid:231) = (cid:231)ƒ (x)- ƒ(cid:231) + (cid:231) g(x)- g(cid:231) < > ½ ˛ + > ½ ˛ ˛ Thus it is shown that if: If 0 < (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d ƒ(cid:231) (x) + g(x) - (ƒ+g)(cid:231) < ˛ o 2 Which is the required proof.
2.
To prove that lim k ƒ (x) = k ƒ x x o Let ˛ > 0.
You must find d > 0 such that: If 0<1 (cid:231) x-xo (cid:231) < s then (cid:231) k ƒ (x) = k ƒ (cid:231) < s There are two cases to consider: 1. when k = 0 2. k „ 0 If k =0 then (cid:231) 0- 0 (cid:231) < ˛ when 0< (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d o From the above any value for d > 0 will do.
To prove the case k „ 0.
Since lim ƒ (x) = ƒ x x o then there is d > 0 such that ˛ If 0 < (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d then ƒ(cid:231) (x) - ƒ(cid:231) < (cid:231) k(cid:231) o From the last inequalities you have that (cid:231) k (cid:231) (cid:231)ƒ (x) - ƒ(cid:231) < ˛ (cid:222) (cid:231) k ƒ(x) - ƒk(cid:231) < ˛ which is the required proof.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 If lim ƒ (x) =ƒ and lim g(x) =g x x x x o o 59MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Show that: lim ƒ (x) - g(x) = ƒ- g x x o The result of the last two theorems can be extended to any finite number of function.
Example: If lim ƒ (x) =ƒ , limƒ (X) =ƒ ... 1 1 2 2 x x x x o o lim f (x) = f then o n x x o lim ( k , ƒ (x) + k ƒ (x) +........+ k ƒ (x)) = k ƒ + k ƒ 1 1 2 2 n n l 1 2 2 + ....... k ƒ 3 3 x x o 3.3 Products and Quotients of Limits You shall now consider further theorems on limits (the t proof are beyond the scope of this course).
Theorem2: If lim ƒ (x) = ƒ and lim g(x) =g x x x x o o Then (I) lim ƒ (x) = ƒ and g(x) = f g x x o (II) lim 1 = 1 g(x) „ 0, g„ 0 g (x) g x x o (III) lim ƒ(x) = ƒ ƒ(x), „ 0, g„ 0 g(x) x x o Theorem3.
Let ƒ(x), g(x) and h(x) be functions defined on an interval I containing a o, except possible the functions are not necessary defined at xo, such that: ƒ(x) g(x) h(x) for all x ˛ I and lim ƒ (x) = lim h(x) = ℓ 60MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS x x x x o o then = limg(x) = ℓ x x o From the above theorems it easy to conclude that every polynomial ƒ (x) = a xn + a xn+ a xn-1 +........ + a + a n 1 1 1 o satisfies lim ƒ(x) = ƒ(x ).
o x x o Examples Evaluate the following, limits: i. lim (2x2 -5x + 1) = 2(2)2-5(2) + 1 = 2.4 -10+1 = x 2 ii.
lim (3x5- 6x4 - 3x2 + x + 10) = x 0 iii.
lim (x5- x3 – 4x2 + x +1) = (1)5 - (1)3 - 4(1)22 + (cid:231) 1 (cid:231) = -2 x x o As consequence of theorem 2 you can see that if P and Q are two polynomials and Q (x ) ≠ 0 then o lim p(x) = P(x ) o Q(x) Q(x ) o x x o if Q(x ) = 0 o then lim p(x) = does not exist.
Q(x) Examples Find the limits of the following functions.
i.
2x-1 = 4-1 = 3 = 3 x2 -3 4-3 1 x 2 ii.
lim x 2 +x +1 = 1 + 1 = 3 = 1 x2 + 2x 1 + 2 3 x 1 iii.
2 - x = 2 - 4 = -2 = -1 61MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 4x 8 8 4 x 2 iv.
lim ( 3x – 2x + 1) = 3 – 6 + 1 = -2 3.5 Infinite Limit In this section you will be studying about functions whose limits tends to infinity as x approaches a given number.
If a function ƒ(x) increases or decreases without bound as x tends to certain point xo we say that ƒ(x) diverges.
That is for a function ƒ(x) if corresponding to every number K˛ R there is d > 0 such that if o< (cid:231) x- x (cid:231) < d then ƒ (x) > k o Then ƒ (x) is said to approach + ¥ as x tend x in symbols you o write it as lim ƒ(x) = + ¥ x x o It is possible to have a situation whereby point ℓ< ¥ as x increases or decreases without bound.
In other words a function ƒ(x) is said to tend to ℓ as x +¥ as if to each there is a number k ˛ R such that: If x > k then (cid:231)ƒ (x) - ℓ (cid:231) < ˛ symbolically this could be represented as: lim ƒ (x) = ℓ x x 0 In a similar manner ƒ(x) is said to tend to L as x - ¥ , if to each ˛ >0 there K˛ R such that x <k (cid:222) (cid:231)ƒ (x) - L (cid:231) < ˛ In symbols you write lim ƒ(x) = ℓ x x o Example 1 Take a look at the graph of the function ƒ(x) = x , x > 0 (see fig.

The function is a decreasing function.
As x gets longer and larger ƒ(x) gets smaller and smaller.
This suggest that 1 = 0 Lim x x a also as gets smaller and smaller the function ƒ(x) gets bigger and bigger the value 0 ~(x) takes arbitrary large value.
In this case 1 = + ¥ Lim x x a SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Draw the graph of ƒ(x) = 1 x > 0 investigate the limit as x 1. x tends to 0.
2. x tends to - ¥ Finally it could be possible that ƒ(x) increases or decreases without bound just as x also increases or decreases i.e.
given an arbitrary number k, there exists k ˛ R such that x > k, (cid:222) ƒ(x) > k .
In that case you write 2 2 symbolically: Lim ƒ(x) = ¥ ¥ x a - For the case x<k and ƒ (x) > k you write l 2 Lim ƒ (x) = ¥ 63MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ¥ x a - and for the case of x < k l and ƒ (x) < k you have Lim ƒ (x) = ¥ 2 ¥ x - For each of the following function.

You have seen how the graph of a rational function could aid in evaluating infinite limits.

In this section the word continuous has almost the same meaning.
That is a function is continuous in the sense that you plot the graph continuously without lifting your pencil from the graph paper.
In calculus it is demanded that functions must be continuous at points or interval of investigations that is why you must study this unit with some care.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this you should be able to correctly: 1. define a continuous function at the part x = x o 2. recall properties of continuous function 3. state theorems on continuous function.
4. state the 3 conditions for continuity of a function at a given part.
5. identify parts of continuity and discontinuity of a function.
71MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definitions of a Continuous Function Consider The Graph shown in Fig.
(21 a) and Fig (21b .
● ● O a Fig.
21 b.
In Fig 21a the function changes abruptly at the part a: whereas the graph in Fig.21b is continuous.
Definition: A function f (x) is said to be continuous at the point x = xo if and only if: Lim f (x) = f (x ) o x x o 72MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS The above definition can be broken down into 3 main conditions a function must satisfy for it to be continuous at the point x = x o Definition: A function f(x) is said to be continuous at the point x = x if the following 3 conditions are satisfied.
o 1. f (x) must be defined at x = x o 2. lim f (x) = L must exist x x o 3. f (x ) - L o Examples: a.
Is the function f (x) = x2 - 4 continuous at the point x Solution: Checking for the 3 conditions.
1.
Let x =2, f (x) = 22 - 4 = 0 2. lim x2 - 4 = 0 x 2 3. lim x2 - 4 = f(2) = 0 x 2 b.
Is the function f (x) = _ 1__ continuous at point x = 1 x - 1 Solution: i. let x = 1 f (x) _1_ = _1_ 1-1 0 Since division by zero is not possible then f (x) is not defined at the point x = 1.
Needless to check for the remaining conditions you can conclude by saying that f (x) =__1__ is not continuous at the point x =1 x - 1 Definition: A function f (x) which is not continuous at the point x = x is said to be discontinuous at that point.
o 73MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example: Determine the points of discontinuities of the function f (x) =__x__ x2 - 9 Solution: The same manner a function is said to be continuous (on the left) at x = x if.
lim f (x) = f (x ) o o x x o Just as the case of limit, a function is said to be continuous at x = x if it o is both continuous from left and from right at x o 1.
Function that are Continuous on R Every polynomial function is continuous on R.
i.e.
; f(x) = a xn + a , x n-1 + ...+ a , x + a - 1 n n n-1 n In unit I section 3.3 it was shown that i. e. ; lim f(x) = f(x ) for all polynomial o Thus f (x ) is continuous.
2.
The Trigonometric Functions For examples f (x) = sin x and f (x ) = cos x are continuous on R (cid:231) sin x (cid:231) < (cid:231) x (cid:231) and (cid:231) cos x (cid:231) < 1 for all x ˛ R see the graph of sin x and cos x at Fig.

3.
Removable Discontinuity It has earlier been defined that a function that is not continuous at a point x = x is discontinuous at that point.
However o there are basically two types of discontinuities.
If for any function f (x), the lim f (x) „ f (x ) initially, but x x o o by redefining the function f (x) is done in such a way that f (x ) = o lim f (x) x x o then the point x is said to be a point of removable discontinuity o of f (x).
Example: Show that f (x) = x - 4 x - 2 Has a removable discontinuity at point x = 2.
Solution: Since f(x) is not defined at x = 2.
But by appropriate factorization the function.
f (x) = (x - 2)(x + 2) = x + 2 x – 2 then lim x=2 = f(2) = 4 x 2 Hence at x = 2 is a point of removable discontinuity.
75MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS A very simple way to solve this is to define the domain of the function.
You can easily see that the domain D is given as D = { x; x ˛ R, x „ -3 or 3) Therefore the points of discontinuity are -3 and 3.
Finally, another definition of limit will now be given using the familiar ˛ , d + symbol.
Definition: A function f (x) is said to be continuous at the point x = x if for ˛ > 0 there is d > 0 such that o If (cid:231) x - x (cid:231) < d then (cid:231) f (x) - f (x ) (cid:231) < ˛ o o Remark: The above definition is an extension of the definition of a limit.
In the above if we replace f (x ) with L and remove the restriction o that f (x ) must be defined you get back definition of a limit.
o Example: Show that the function f (x) = x2 is continuous at the point x = 2.
Solution; Let ˛ > 0 if you can find a d > 0 Such that If (cid:231) x - 2 (cid:231) < d then (cid:231) f (x) - f (x ) (cid:231) < ˛ o Note that f(2) = 0 and (cid:231) x2 - 4 (cid:231) = (cid:231) (x – 2(x + 2) (cid:231) = (cid:231) x + 2 (cid:231) (cid:231) x – 2 (cid:231) By keeping x close to 2 we make the factor x - 2 as small as we please and the second factor x + 2 gets close to 4.
If the domain D = [-2, ]say then we can be sure that the factor (x + 2) 4.
76MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS If x ˛ [ -2, 2] then X + 2 10 and (cid:231) f( x) – f (2) (cid:231) < ˛ When (cid:231) x – 2 (cid:231) < d m Provided that d £ ˛ /10 If ˛ > 0 then (cid:231) f( x) – f (2) (cid:231) 10 (cid:231) ( x – 2 (cid:231) < ˛ if (cid:231) x – 2 (cid:231) < ˛ /10 = d In fact the function in the above example is continuous for all points in the interval 1 = [ - 2, 2].
When such happens the function f (x) is said to be uniformly continuous on the interval 1.
3.3 Properties of Continuous Functions 1.
Uniform Continuity A function f (x) is said to be continuous in an interval I.
If for ˛ > 0 there is a d > 0 (depending on alone) such that: If (cid:231) x – x (cid:231) < d then (cid:231) f( x ) – f (x ) (cid:231) < e 1 2 1 2 2.
Continuity of Function From Left and Right of a Point A function f (x) is said to be continuous (on the right ) at a point x = x o If lim f (x) = f (x ) x x o o With f (x) defined at x = 2.
You can say that f (x) is now continuous at the point x =2.
Type II: Non-Removable Discontinuity If for a given function f (x) the right hand and left hand limits as x x exist but are unequal i.e.
; o Lim f (x) „ Lim f (x) x x x x o o or if either the Lim f (x) or Lim f (x) x x x x o o 77MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS does not exist then the function f(x) is said to have a non- removable discontinuity x x o Example The function f (x) = sin ( 1/x ) is continuous except for x = 0.
The function has non-removable discontinuity at x = 0.
Both right and left hand limits do not exist.
Example Determine whether the function f (x) = [x] (the greatest integer function) is continuous at the point x = 3 Solution: Lim [x] = 3 x x o and lim [x] = 2 x 3 Since Lim f (x) „ Lim f (x) x 3+ x 3- Then the function f (x) has a non-removable discontinuity at x = 3.
See Fig 23.

78MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS The above gives us a picture of a function that is one sided continuous.
In fig.
23. the function is continuous from the right and discontinuous from the left.
5.
Continuity on [a,b] If a function f(x) is defined on closed interval [a, b) the most continuity we can possibly expect is: 1.
Continuity at each point xo of the open interval (a, b).
2.
Continuity from the right at a, and 3.
Continuity from the left at b.
Therefore any function that satisfies conditions 1 to 3 above is said to be continuous on [a, b] Functions that are continuous on a closed interval are of special interest to mathematicians, because they possess certain special properties which discontinuous function do not have.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Draw the graph of the above function.

Example The function f(x) = (cid:214) 1 – x2 is on the in [-1, 1] SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Draw the graph of the above function.
3.4 Algebra of Continuous Functions Recall the theorem, on limits you studied in the last Unit.
You will now do the same for continuous function.
Using the following theorems it can be shown that continuity is preserved through algebraic operations on functions.
79MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS That is: Theorem 1: If the functions f(x) and g(x) are continuous at the point x = x then the o sum f(x) + g(x) is continuous at x = x o Fortunately enough the proof of the above theorem is not complicated in the sense that all that is required for a function to be continuous at a point x = x is that lim f(x) = f(x ) o o From the theorems of limits (see Unit 3).
The lim f(x) + g(x) = lim f(x) + lim g(x) x x x x o o Therefore the function f(x) + g(x) is continuous since lim f(x) + g(x) = lim f(x ) + g(x ) o o x x o Theorem 2: If the functions f(x) and g(x) are continuous at the point x = xthen the o sum f(x) + g(x) is continuous at x = x o Proof: Let lim f(x) = f(x ) and o x x o Let lim g(x) = g(x ) since o x x o they are continuous at x = x o Therefore lim f(x) .
g(x) = lim f(x) .
lim g(x) = f(x) .
g(x) x x x x o o hence the function f(x) g(x) is continuous at x = x o Theorem 3: If the functions f(x) and g(x) are continuous at the point x = x then the o function f(x) / g(x) , g(x) „ 0 is continuous at x = x 1 o Proof: 80MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS The proof is similar to the one above if left as an exercise for you (good proving).
Theorem 4: If the functions y=f(x) is continuous at the point x = x and z = g(y) is o continuous at y = y where y = f(x ) o o o Then the function z = g ( f(x ) is continuous at point x = x o o.
The Proof follows from the fact that Lim f(x) = f(x ) o x x o and lim g(y) = g(y ) = g(f(x ) o o y y o hence gf(x) is continuous at x = x o Example: Use the theorems on continuous function to determine whether the following functions are continuous at the given points.

This theorem is important in that once a continuous function is defined and it is a one to one function then it becomes easy for you to determine whether the inverse function is continuous.
The concept of continuity of functions brings out the hidden beauty in the study of both differential and integral calculus.
Theorem 5: Continuity of Inverse Function 83MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS If f(x) is continuous on an interval I and either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing and one to one in the interval I, then there exists an inverse function f-1(x) which is continuous and one to one and either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

This will be done by looking at the slope of a line, which you will extend to general case of slope of a curve.
Then you will apply the concept studied in unit 2 to study the limiting process of a function along the given line.
After which you use the concept of a slope of a curve and a target at a given point on the curve to solve two type of problems among others namely: 1. given a function ƒ(x), determine those value of x (in the domain of ƒ(x) ) at which the function is differentiable 2. given a function ƒ(x) and a point x = x at which the function is o differentiable find the derived function you will finally extend this to differentiation of a polynomials functions.
A section on solved problems has been included to sharpen your skills in differentiation.
This unit is a formal bridge between concept studied so far in units 1 to 4 and those you will be studying in units 6 to 10.
Therefore carefully read and understand all definitions and solved examples given in this unit – wishing you a successful completion of this unit.
Below are the objectives of this unit.
87MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly: 1. define the slope of a point on a curve.
2. define the derivative of a function at a given point x = x o 3. evaluate the derivative of a function using the limiting process (i.e.
∆ - process or from first principle).
4. derive standard formula for differentiation of polynomials 5. find the derivative of polynomials functions using the ∆ - process or a standard formula.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Slope of a Curve You will start the study this unit by reviewing the following: i. the coordinate system ii slope of a line 1.
The Coordinate System This is the system that contains i) a horizontal line in a plane extending indefinitely to the left and to the right and which is known as x axis or axis of abscussas ii) a vertical line in the same plane extending indefinitely up and down this is known as the y- axis or aixs of ordinates.
A unit is the chosen for both axis.

Showing the coordinate system.
2.
The Slope of a Line You are also familiar with the concept of increment.
For example.
If a body starts at a point Q (x , y ) and goes to a new 1 1 1 position Q (x , y ) you say that its coordinates have changed by an 1 2 2 increment ∆x (i.e.
delta x) and ∆y(i.e delta y).
Let a body move from point p(2, 4) to Q(4, 6) as shown in Fig (25).
Find ∆x and ∆y.
6 Q(2, 4) 5 ∆y 0 4 P(2, 4) ∆x 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 Fig 25.
∆ x = 4 - 2 = 2 ∆ y = 6 – 4 = 2.
89MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Generally if P(x, y ) and Q(x , y ) are two given points then l 1 2 2 ∆x = x2 - x if P Q 1 ∆x = x – x if Q P 1 2 ∆y = y – y if P Q 2 1 ∆y = y – y if Q P 1 2 Using the above you can now turn your attention to finding the slope of a line the idea here is that lines in any coordinate plane rise or fall at a constant rate as we move along them from left to right unless, of course they are horizontal or vertical.
You can define the slope or gradient of line as the rate of rise or fall as you move from left to right along the given line.
Example Describe the slope of the line L in fig 26.
Y Q(x – y ) 2 2 P(x – y ) 2 1 X Fig.
26.
As you move from P to Q along line L, the increment ∆y = y is called 2 the rise from P to Q.
The increment ∆x = x – x is called the run from P 2 1 to Q.
Since the line L is not vertical line then ∆x ≠ 0 .
The slope of the line L can now be defined as rise = ∆y = y - y = m 2 2 run ∆x x - x 2 l Remark m = y – y y - y 2 1 = 1 2 x - x , x - x 2 1 1 2 90MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example Let P (4, -2 ) and Q (-3 , 2) then the slope of the line joining P and Q is given as: m = 2- (-2) 4 -2 -2 -4 = = = - 3 - 4 -7 4-(-3) 7 Slope of a Curve You will now extend method of finding the slope of line to finding the slope or gradient of curve.
To do this you start by finding the slope of a secant line through P and Q by two points on the curve C. See Fig.
27.
Y Q(x , y ) 2 2 P(x , y ) 1 2 X Fig.
27 In fig 27. the slope of the secant line PQ is given as Slope of PQ y – y = ∆y 2 11 x – x ∆x 2 11 The goal is to find the slope of the curve at point P to achieve this goal you hold P fixed and move Q along the curve towards P as you do so, the slope of the secant line PQ will vary.
As Q moves closer and closer to P along the curve the slope of the secant line varies by slope of the secant line varies until it approaches a constant limiting value.
This limiting value is what is called the slope of the curve at point P. See Fig 28.
91MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Q(x , y ) 2 2 Q1 Q11 Fig 28.
In fig.
27 you will notice that as the secant line PQ moves along the curve towards the point P the slope of the secant line approaches or tends to the slope of the target line at the point P. Interesting the increment ∆x tends 0 as Q --->P.
Thus it will right to say that the limiting position to the tangent line TP.
Therefore the slope of the secant line has a limiting value approximately equal to the slope of the tangent line.
Example Find the slope of the curve Y = x2 at the point (x , y ) 1 l Solution Since the point P(x, y) lies on the curve then its co-ordinate must l l satisfy the equation.
y= x2 i.e.
y = x2 l i Let Q(x , x ) be a second point on the curve y = x2.
2 2 If ∆x = x - x =:> x = ∆x + x 2 1 2 1 And ∆y = y - y => y = ∆y + y 2 l 2 l Since the point Q is on the curve limits coordinates must satisfy the equation y = x2 that is y = x 2 2 2 2 92MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Hencey + ∆y= (x + ∆x)2 = x 2 + 2x ∆x + (∆x)2 1 1 = x 12+ 2x ∆x + (∆x)2 - y 1 l \ ∆y = x 2 + 2x ∆x + (∆x)2 -x 2 1 1 1 =2x1 ∆x + (∆x)2 .
.
... (A) To find the slope of the line PQ you divide both sides of equation (A) by ∆x ≠ 0 and equation A becomes: ∆y = Qx + ≠x = slope secant PQ ∆x Q(x , y ) 1 1 0 0 P(x1, y1) Fig.
29.
As Q gets closer to P along the curve ∆x approaches zero and the slope of PQ gets closer to 2x 1 i. e. ∆y 2x, as ∆x ---> 0 ∆x By definition this means that ∆x--~0 The value of this limit is the slope of the tangent to the curve or slope of the curve at the point (x, y).
Since the point (x y ) is chosen arbitrarily l l l, 1 (i.e.
can be any point on the curve y = x2) you could remove the subscript 1 from x and replace x by x.
Then the slope of the tangent will l l be given as m = 2x.
93MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS This is the value of the slope of the curve at any point P(x, y) on the curve.

3.2 Definition of Derivative of a Function In this section you will use the concept of the slope of a curve at a given point to defined the derivative of function at a given point Let P (x , y ) be a point on the curve where; 1 1 x = x +∆x 1 1 And y = ∆y + y, 2 In Fig 29 below ∆y = ƒ(x +∆x) - ƒ(x) Y Q ƒ(x + ∆x) ∆y ƒ(x ) P ∆ x X x x + ∆x Fig 29.
94MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Then the slope the PQ (i.e.
secant) is: M = ∆y = ƒ (x + ∆) - ƒ(x) .
.
... ∆ S ∆xx ∆x If the slope of the secant m approaches a constant value when ∆x s gets smaller and smaller, then this constant value is the limit of m ∆x tends to zero.
This limit is defined to be the slope of the s tangent (m ) to the curve at point p (x y).
The mathematics to 1 1 describe the above could be symbolized as follows.
M = 1im m = lim ∆y = lim = ƒ(x + ∆x) 1 s - ƒ(x) ∆x ∆x Q ﬁ P ∆ x ﬁ 0 ∆ x ﬁ 0 If the slope of the secant ms approaches a constant value when ∆x gets smaller and smaller, then this constant value is the limit of m as ∆ x tends to zero.
This limit is defined to be the slope of s the tangent (m) to the curve at point P(x, y) .
The mathematics to t describe the above could be symbolized as follows.
M = lim m = lim ∆y = lim ƒ (x + ∆x) t s - ƒ(x) ∆x ∆x Q ﬁ P ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 The limit above if it exists is related to ƒ(x) at the point x by writing it as ƒ (x) ( read ƒ prime of x).
which is define as ƒ(x) = lim ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) ∆x ∆ x ﬁ 30 The above limit may exist only for some or all values of x in the domain of definition of the function ƒ(x).
That is the limit may fail to exist for other values of x belonging to the domain whenever the limit exist for any point x, belonging to the domain, then the function ƒ(x) is said to be differentiable at the point x.
Remark All the curves used for or mentioned so far are assumed to be smooth (i.e.
continuous) In the previous unit it was mentioned 95MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (and it is by definition) that a function that is continuous at a function that is a limit at that point.
Since continuity implies existence of lim ƒ(x).
It will be shown later that a function that is differentiable at the point x = x , x ﬁ x o o is continuous at the point x = x .
o Example In the previous section 3.1 it was shown that the slope of the curve y =x2 at a given point x is 2x.
This implies that the function y = x2 possess a derivative whose value at a point x is given to you that the function ƒ1(x) =2x.
Example Let us find ƒ1(x) for the function given as ƒ (x) = 3x +2.
Solution: This will be curried out in the steps/stages as follows: Step 1: For the given function ƒ(x) = 3x + 2 you start by defining ƒ(x + ∆x).
This is given as ƒ (x + ∆x) = 3 (x + ∆x) + 2 (i.e.
by direct substituting x + ∆x for x).
\ ƒ (x+ ∆x) =3x + ∆x +2.
And ƒ (x) = 3x+2 Step 2: Subtract ƒ(x ) from ƒ (x + ∆x) i.e.
ƒ (x+ ∆x) - ƒ (x) -3x + 3∆x + 2 - (3x - 2) = 3∆x Step 3: Divide result of step 2 by ∆x ƒ (x + ∆x) - f (x) = 3∆x =3 ∆x ∆x 96MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Step 4; Evaluate the limit as ∆x ----> 0 ƒ1(x) = lim ƒ(x + ∆x) - ƒ(x) - s ∆x The above process from step 1 to step 4 is referred to as "differentiating from first principle" Example Find the ƒ1(x) if ƒ(x) = x2 + 3x Solution: Proceed as before.
Step 1: Write out ƒ(x + ∆x) and ƒ(x) ƒ(x + ∆x) = (x + ∆x)2 + 3(x + ∆x) = x2 + 2x ∆x + (∆x) + 3x + ∆x ƒ(x) = x + 3x Step 2: Subtract ƒ (x) from ƒ(x + ∆x) i.e.

There exist functions that are continuous at given points but not differentiable at those points.
Example Is the absolute value function, which you are very familiar with (see unit 1) This function ƒ(x) = /x/ is continuous at x = 0 but not continuous at x = 0 see fig 5.6.
106MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS The limit ƒ1(0) does not exist i.e.
ƒ1(0) = lim ƒ(0+ h) – ƒ(0) = h = -1 h h h ----> 0+ ƒ1(0) = lim ƒ(0+ h) – ƒ(0) = -h = -1 h h h ----> 0- Since lim ƒ(x) ≠ lim ƒ(x) h-->0+ h-->0- then ƒ1(x) at x = 0 does not exist 4.0 CONCLUSION You have studied how to find the slope a line you have extended this to finding the slope of a curve by evaluating the limit of the slope tangent line at a given point on the curve.
You have related the value of this limit with the slope of the curve at any point.
You have defined this limit whenever it exist as the derivative of the function at the point x.
You have used these definitions to find the derivative of certain functions such as: y = k, y = x, y = x2, y = 1/x, y =(cid:214) x, and y = kxn by the method of limiting process.
You are now posed to use materials studied here to find derivatives of sum, product quotients of functions in the next unit.
Make sure you do all your assignment correctly.
You will definitely need them, because you will refer to them directly or indirectly in this remaining part of this course.
107MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 5.0 SUMMARY The principle of using limiting processes to derive the derivatives of a function is called the first principle.
The principle must be well understood because it is very useful in Advanced Analysis which you will study as you progress in the study of Mathematics.

108MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS UNIT 3 RULES FOR DIFFERENTIATION I CONTENT 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Differentiation of sum of functions 3.2 Differentiation of difference of functions 3.3 Differentiation of product of functions 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor marked assignments 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this unit you will learn a few simple rules for differentiation of all sorts of functions constructed from the ones you are already familiar with so far you have observed that the study of differential calculus started with the study of behaviour of functions and their limits at different points.
In the previous unit you studied that functions that are differentiable are continuous.
This implies that rules governing the results on continuous functions in respect of algebra of continuous functions can easily be extended to differentiable functions.
In this unit you will formulate rules based on theorems on limits and theorems on continuous functions you will be expected to apply the rules formulated in this unit to differentiate sum and product of polynomials function.
You will then use the same rules throughout the remaining part of this course.
Until the following study style will be adopted; first the rules will be stated with example.
Then the rules will be justified.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly.
i) derive the following rules for differentiation a.
Sum rule b.
Difference rule c. Product rule ii) differentiate all types of polynomial functions.
109MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Differentiation of Sum of Functions Sum Rule The derivative of the sum of finite number of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.
i.e.
d(u + v) = du + dv dx dx dx.
Solution The proof for the case of the derivative of the sum of two functions u and v will be given first after which the prove of a finite sum will then follow.
Example 1 Let u = x2, v = 2/x find d/dx (u+v) d (x2 + 2/x) = d (x2) + d (2/x) = 2x – 2 dx dx dx x2 Now let y = u + v where u = u (x) and v = v(x) both u(x) and v(x) are differentiable Let ∆x be an increment in x which will give a corresponding increments in y, and v given as ∆y, ∆u and ∆v respectively.
Then ∆y = (u + ∆u) + (v + ∆v) ∆y = (u + ∆u) + (v + ∆v) - (u + v) ∆y = ∆u + ∆v ∆x ∆x ∆x (divide by ∆x) lim ∆y = lim ∆u + ∆v = lim ∆u + lim ∆v ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆y = ∆u + ∆v 110MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ∆x ∆x ∆x \ d (u + v) = ∆u + ∆u dx ∆x ∆x which is the required result.
If y =u+ v+ w Then y = z, where z = v + w ∆y = ∆u + ∆v but dz = ∆v + dw ∆x ∆x dx dx ∆x dx ∆y = ∆u + ∆v + dw ∆x ∆x ∆x dx This can be extended to a finite sum of differentiable functions i.e.
if y = u + u +....... +u then 1 2 n d (u + u + .. + u) = du du +…….+ du l 2 1 + 2 2 dx dx dx dx Example 2 Find dy if y = 3x3 + 2x2 + x + 1 dx Solution First find the derivative of each of the term and then add the result.
dy = d(3x 3 ) + d(2x 2 ) + d(x) + d(1) dx dx dx dx dx =3.3x2 +2.2x + 1 +0 = ax2 + 4x + 1 Example 3 Find the dy/dx if.
(i) y = x3 + 1/x (ü) y = 1/3 x3 + ½ x2 + 2x (iii) y = 5x7 + 4x5 + l0x (iv) y = x4 + 5x2 + 1 111MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Solutions (i) y = x3 + 1/x dy = d (3x 3 ) + d (1/x ) = 3x2 - 1 dx dx dy x2 (ii) y = 1 x3 + 1 x2 + 2x 3 2 dy = d ( 1/3x3) + d ( ½ x2) + d (2x) dx dx dx dx = 3.
1/3x2 + 2.
½x +2 = x2 + x + 2 (iii) y = 5x7 + 4x5 + l0x dy - d(4x) + d(5x 2 ) + dy(1) dx dx dx dx = 4x3 + 2.5x + 0 = 4x3 + l0x In unit 5, it was shown that d(ku) = k du where k is a constant and u is a differentiable function.
dx dx 3.2 Differentiation of Difference of Functions The above will be used to establish the difference rule.
Difference Rule: The derivative of the difference of a finite number of functions is the difference of the individual derivatives.
d(uv) = udv + vdu dx dx dx.
Example 4 Find dy/dx if y = x2 (x - 1) Let u = x2 and v = x - 1 112MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Then uv = x2(x - 1) = x2 - x d(uv) = d (x 3 - x) = d (x 3 ) = d(x) dx dx dx dx In unit 2 you studied that the product of two functions will result to another function.
For some complicated functions it might not be very easy to carry out a straight forward multiplication or find the product before differentiable.
Therefore arises the need to find a rule that will side track finding of the product of functions before differentiation.
That rule is what you will derive now.
Product Rule Suppose y = uv is the product of two differentiable functions of x then the derivative is given as: d(uv) = udv + vdu dx dx dx Proof: Let y = uvwhere u and v are differentiable functions of x.
Let ∆x be an increment in x which will result in a corresponding increments in y, a and v given as ∆y, ∆u and ∆x respectively.
Then ∆y + y = (u + ∆u) (v + ∆v) = uv + v ∆u + u ∆v + ∆u ∆v Subtract y from ∆y + y you get ∆y = u v + v∆u = u ∆v + ∆u ∆v - u v = v∆u + u∆v + ∆u∆v Next divide by ∆x ≠ 0 ∆y = v ∆u + u ∆v ∆v ∆v ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆x Evaluate the limit of dy/dx as ∆x ﬁ 0 you get lim ∆y = lim v ∆u + u ∆x ∆v ∆v ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 = v llim ∆u + u lim ∆v + lim ∆u lim ∆v 113MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ∆x ∆x ∆x ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 The lim ∆u = lim ∆u ∆x = du .
0 = 0 ∆x dx ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 dy = v du + u dv + 0. dv dx dx dx dx dy = v du + u dv dx dx dx This can now be extended to the case of product of a finite number of functions: i.e.
if y = u u u ...u then l 2 3 n d(uu u ....u ) = du (u ….u ) + u du (u …..u ) l 2 3 n 1 2 n l 2 3 n dx dx dx +....+ (u.....u ) du l n-1 n dx Example 5 Differentiate the following functions (i) y = (x2 - 1) (x + 3) (ii) y = (x3 – 2x) (x2 - 1) (iii) y = (x2 + 1) (2x2- 1) (x - 1) (iv) y = (x2 - 1) (3x - 1) (x4 - 1)(3x2 - 1) Solutions (i) y = (x2 - 1) (x + 3) let u =(x2 - 1) and v = (x + 3) then dy = u du + v dv = (x2 – 1) d(x + 3) + (x + 3) d(x 2 –1) dx dx dx dx dx 114MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS = (x2 - 1) 1 +(x + 3) (2x) = x2 - 1 + 2x2 + 6x = 3x2 + 6x - 1 (ii) y = (x3 - 2x) (x2- 1) Let u = (x3 - 2x) v + (x2- 1) dy = u du + v dv = (x3 - 2x) d (x 2 - 1) + (x2 – 1) d(x – 2x) dx dx dx dx dx = (x - 2x) (2x) + (x2 - 1) (3x3 - 2x) = 2x4 - 4x2 + 3x4 - 3x2 - 2x2 + 2 = 5x4 - 9x2 +2.

This unit will follow the same concept used in the previous unit.
The introductions in unit 7 will fit perfectly as an introduction to this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: (1) Derive the formula for quotient rule from first principle using the limiting process.
(2) Derive the Chain rule.
(3) Differentiates all types of rational functions with denomination of this type a xn + a xn-1 +.... + c/n l 120MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Differentiation of Quotient of Functions Quotient Rule.
The derivation of the quotient of two functions is given as: i.e.
d u = v du - u dv dx v dx dx v2 v ≠ 0 Example 1 Find dy/dx if y = x 2 - 2 x - 1 Solution Let u = x2 - 2, v = x - 1 d = (x-1)2x - ( x 2 -2) = 2x 2 - x 2 - 2 (x -1) (x -1)2 Quotient Rule Suppose y = u/v v ≠ 0 Is the quotient of two differentiable functions of x then the derivative is given as d u = v du - u dv dx v dx dx v2 v ≠ 0 Proof: Let y = , where u(x) and v(x) are both differentiable at a domain where 121MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS v ≠ 0.
Let ∆ x be an increment in x in the given domain.
Then ∆ y, ∆ u and ∆v are corresponding increments in y, u and v respectively.
Then 1.
∆y + y = (u + ∆u) where ∆v + v ≠ (v + ∆u) subtracting y from ∆y + y you get ∆y = u + ∆u - u v + ∆u v = uv + v∆u – uv - u∆v v(v + ∆v) 2. v∆u - u∆v v(v + ∆V) division by ∆x ≠ 0 yields d u = v du - u dv dx v dx dx v2 v ≠ 0 Taking the limit as ∆x tends to zero you obtain 3. lim d = lim v ∆u -u ∆v ∆x ∆x v(v + ∆x) ∆x ﬁ 0 Lim v ∆u - lim u ∆v ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x lim v (v + ∆v) ∆x ﬁ 0 As ∆x ﬁ 0 lim (v + ∆v) = 1im v lim (v +∆v) = lim v ( lim v + ∆v) = v(v+0) Recall that lim ∆v = Iim ∆v ∆x = dv .0 ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 lim v(v + ∆v) = V2 ∆x ﬁ 0 122MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Hence from (3) you get: v du - u dv dx dx V2 dy = lim ∆y dx ∆x Example 2 If y = x 2 + 2 Find dy x3 dx Solution Let u=x2 + 2, v = x3 Then dy = (x 3 ) (2x) - (x 2 +2) (3x 2 ) dx (x3)2 2 - 3(x 2 +2) x2 x4 Example 3 Differentiate the following functions if (i) y = x3 + 1 x - 1 (üi) y = x 2 + 1 (cid:214) x + 1 (iv) y = 3x 2 +2x+1 x2 -1 Solution 123MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS dy (x -1)3x 2 - x 3 + 1 = 3x 2 (x 3 + 1) - dx (x-1)2 x-1 (x-1)2 (ii) y = x + 1 u = x + 1, v = (cid:214) x (cid:214) x dy = x – ½ (x + 1) (x -1/2 ) dx x = 1 - 1 (cid:214) x 2 = x – 1 2x3/2.
(üi) y = x 2 + 1 u = 3x2 + 2x + 1, v = x2 - 1 x + 1 dy = (6x + 2)(x 2 -1) - 2x(3x 22 + 2x + 1) 6x + 2 - 2x(3x 2 +2x+1 x2 – 1 (x2 – 1)2 Let u = g(x) and y = un then dy du" du dx = dx = nun-1 dx Recall that in unit 5 you proved that dy = mxn-1 when u = x.
You will use the dx same principle to show the above, i.e.
Let y = un where u is a differentiable function of x and n˛ N. Therefore ∆y and ∆u are corresponding increment in y and u respectively.
Then y + ∆y = (u + ∆u)n By trinomial equation you get that: y + ∆y = un + nun-1 ∆u + (terms in u and higher powers of (∆u) .
From the above subtract y from y + ∆y You get: 124MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS dy = nun-I du + 0 dx dx (iv) y = (x+1)4 (x - 1 )3 (x2 + 1)2 Let u = (x + 1)4, v = (x- 1 )3, w = (x2 + 1)2 Then du = 4 (x+1)3 dv = 3(x- 1 )2dw = 4x (x2 + 1) dx dx dx dy = 4 (x 1)3 (x - 1 )3 (x2 + 1)2 3(x -1 )4 (x + 1)2 (x - 1 )2 dx + 4 (x + 1)4 (x - 1 )3 (x2 + 1) If n is negative instead of y = un you have Using the quotient rule you will get that dy = d 1 un d(l) - 1 d(un) Un dx dx dx dx (un)2 u2n dy = ( - nun-1 u-2n) du dx dx Given that: (1) y = x4 + l (2) Y = x3(x - 1) -2 x4 (3) y = 2x(4x2 - 3)-3 Find dy/dx in each case.
Solutions (1) y = x4 + 1 = x4+X-4 x4 dy = 4x - 4/x5 dx 125MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (2) Y = x3(x - 1)-2 let u =x3 v = (x - 1)-2 dy = 3x2(x-1)-2 – 2x3 (x - 1)3 dx 3x 2 - 2x 3 (x - 2)2 (x - 2)3 (3) y = 2x(4x2 - 3)-3 let u = 2x v = (4x2 - 3)-3 dy = 2 - 48x 2 dx (4x2 - 3)3 (4x2 - 3)4 3.2 The Chain Rule for Differentiation You will now learn how to differentiate composite functions, which you studied in unit 2. i.e.
if ƒ (x) and g(x) are functions defined in the same domain then ƒ og =ƒ( g (x) ) Remark: Now suppose that u(x) is a differentiable functions of x, then u (x) changes du times as fast as x does.
If ƒ changes n times as fast as g and g changes n times as dx fast as w, then ƒ changes mn times as fast as w. Suppose a function y = ƒ (g(x)) where ƒ and g are both differentiable functions of x.
Then dy = d [ f (g(x)) ] dx dx This implies that by the above remark ƒ (g(x) ) changes ƒ 1(g(x)) times as fast as g(x) And g(x) changes gl(x) x g1(x) times as fast as x. ƒ 1 (g(x) g1 (x) is the derivative of ƒ (g(x) with respect to x .
which means that d [ƒ (g(x)) ] = ƒ l (g(x) g1 (x) .
The above is called the chain rule for the differentiation of a composite function (i.e, function of function).
In the previous section you have studied that if u is a differentiable 126MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS function of x and y = un then dy = nun-1 du for n e Q dx dx The coefficient of the term dy of the above equation can be written as dx nun-1 dy dx dy = dy , du dx du dx To prove the chain rule you assume that y = ƒ (u) is differentiable at point u = u , then an increment ∆u will produce a corresponding 0 increment ∆y is y such that: ∆y = f1(u ) ∆u + e 1 ∆u _______ (A) 0 If u = g(x) is a differentiable at a point x = x , then an increment ∆x 0 produces a corresponding increment ∆y such that ∆u = g1 (x ) ∆x + e ∆x ________ (B) 0 2 If e ﬁ 0 then ∆u ﬁ 0 1 And if e ﬁ 0 then ∆x ﬁ 40 2 Combining equations (A) and (B) you get: ∆y = (ƒ 1(u ) e ) ∆x (gl (x ) + e 2) __________ (C) 0 1 0 Dividing equation (C) by ∆x ≠ 0 you get ƒ 1(u ) g1 (x ) + ƒ 1(u ) e + g1 (x ) e + e e _______ (D) 0 0 0 2 o l l 2 Taking limits on both side D you get lim ∆y = lim ƒ 1(u ) g1 (x ) + ƒ 1(u ) e + g1 (x ) e + e e 0 0 0 2 o l l 2 (E) ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ O (E) But as ∆x ﬁ 0 (cid:222) e ﬁ 0 (cid:222) ∆u ﬁ 0 (cid:222) e ﬁ 0 2 1 Then Equation (E) becomes 127MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS dy = ƒ 1(u ) g1 (x ) 0 0 dx x0 which is dy du du u dx x o o since x and u are chosen arbitrarily then 0 0 dy = dy .

In order to be able to solve a large number of problems it is important to study the derivative of certain class of functions.
You already know that if a function ƒ is a one to one function then ƒ has an inverse ƒ -1.
The question now is suppose ƒ is a differentiable and one to one function.
Will the inverse function ƒ -1 be differentiable?
And under what conditions will (ƒ -1) exist.
This is one question among others that you will be able to answer in this unit.
In addition problems of relating to motion of a body a along a curve can only be fully described if the derivative known.
In this unit higher derivations of function will be discussed so that you and others may be able to solve completely the problem of motion rte: a body along a curve.
Optimization of scarce resources can easily be solved with the knowledge of higher derivatives of function most of the functions that have been treated so far are expressed explicitly in terms of one independent variable x.
There are certain functions that might not be 133MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS expressed explicitly, such function fall into the class of functions known as implicit function.
They are so called in the sense that dependant and independent variables are expressed implicitly.
Finding derivatives of such functions will be discussed; it will save you the time of trying to express the dependent variable in terms of the independent variable before differentiating y.
2.0 OBJECTIVES Therefore after studying this unit you should be able to 1) Differentiate the inverse of a function 2) Evaluate higher derivatives of any given function.
3) Differentiate an implicit function 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.0 Differentiation of Inverse Functions You could recall that the inverse of the function y = x3 is given as y = x1/3 (see Unit 2) If y = x1/3 dy - 1 x1/3 -1 x-2/3 and x ≠ 0 dx 3 In the above example the function y = x3 is a one to one function and also a differentiable function.
Also the function y = x1/3 is a one to one and also differentiable at a specified domain provided x ≠ 0.
You recall that in unit 2 you studied that the composite function of ƒ (x) and its inverse ƒ -1(x) in any order yields the identity function.
i.e.
ƒ (ƒ -1(x)) = ƒ (ƒ -1(X)) = x Using the function ƒ (x) = x3 you have that ƒ -1 (x) = xl/3 Then ƒ (ƒ -1(x)) = (x1/3)3 = x And ƒ (ƒ -1(x)) = (x3 )1/3= x Using the above illustration, you can now differentiate the composite function given as ƒ (ƒ -1 (x)) = x 134MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS i.e.
d [ƒ (ƒ -1 (x))] = dx dx dx Using the chain rule studied in Unit 6.
Let ƒ -1 (x) = g (x) Then ƒ (g(x)) = x.
But d [ƒ (g(x)) ] = ƒ '1 (g(x)) = dx = 1 dx dx ƒ 1 (g(x)).
g1(x) = 1. ƒ 1 (g(x)) This gives the derivative of inverse of a function i.e.
(ƒ -1(x)) = 1 ƒ 1 (g(x)) Example Let ƒ (x) = x3 Find (ƒ -1(x)) Solution (ƒ -1(x))1 = 1 = 1 = 1 ƒ 1(ƒ 1(x)) 3(ƒ -1(x))2 3(x1/3)2 1 3x2/3 by direct differentiation of y = x you get: dy = x. dx Example Let ƒ (x) = x3 + 1 find the derivation of the inverse Solution ƒ (x) = x3 + 1; ƒ 1 (x) = 3x2 135MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS inverse ƒ -1 (x) = (x – 1)1/3 (ƒ -1(x))1 = 1 = 1 = 1_____ (ƒ -1(x))1 3(ƒ -1(X))2 3((x - 1)1/3)2 The derivative of inverse of the function ƒ (x) = xn .
, x > 0 Given that ƒ (x) = xn and ƒ 1 (x) = x 1/n ƒ 1(X) = nxn-1 therefore (ƒ -1(x))1 = 1 = 1 _ ƒ 1(ƒ -1(x)) n(ƒ -1(x))n-1 d [x 1/n] = 1 x1/n-1 1 = 1 dx n n(x1/n)n-1 n x1-1/n 1 x1/n-1 n Thus for x > 0 and ƒ 1(x)=x1/n d [x 1/n] = 1 x1/n-1 _____________ (A) dx n and for x ≠ 0 and n odd d [x 1/n] = 1 x1/n-1 dx n Examples Find the derivative of the following functions.
(I) y = x½ (II) y = xI/7 (III) y = xp/E (IV) y = x2/5 (V) y = x4/3 (VI) y = x -5/3 136MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Solutions (I) y = x1/2 = dy = 1 x-1/2 dx 2 (II) y = x1/7 = dy = 1 x-6/7 dx 7 (III) y = xp/E Let xp/q = (x1/q)p d [xp/q] d ( [ x1/q])p dx dx Let u = x I /q then y = up dy = dy .
du dx du dx dy = p u p-1 and du = 1 x 1/q -1 du dx q dy = p u P-1 1 x 1/q-1 = p(x 1/q )p-1 .
1 x1/q-1 dx q q (IV) y = x2/5 dy = 2 x2/5-1 = 2 x- 3/5 dx 5 5 (V) y = x4/3 dy = 4 x 4/3- 1 = 4 x 1/3 dx 3 3 137MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (VI) y = x-5/3 dy = -5 x -5/3-1 = -5 x-8/3 dx 3 3 The above equation (B) could be extended to the case f (x) = u where u is to the case f (x) = u; where u is a differentiable functions of x. i.e.
d (u(x) )p/q = P [u(x)]p/q – 1 d [u(x)] dx q dx For the above to make sense, then u (x) ≠ 0 when q is odd and u (x) > 0 when q is even.
Example (1) If y = [ (x2 - 1)1/5] then dy = 1 (x2-1)1/5-1 2x dx 5 2x (x2 – l )-4/5 5 (2) Evaluate d [ 2x2 -7]1/3] = 1 (2x2 -7)-2/3 .

x).
Such functions are said to be explicit functions.
However, there are functions such as x2y = 2xy2 + 6 This type of such is expressed implicitly.
To obtain an explicit expression of an implicit expression you resolve in transpose (make subject of formula) the equation in the dependant variable or one variable Example 2x2 + 3y = 6 transposing for y yields y = 2x 2 - 6 -3 However there are implicit functions where it will not be possible to solve for y.
Example of such functions are (1) x2 + xy4 + y3x + x3 =2 (2) x2 + xy2 + 5x3 + y2 = 1 In the above although it is not possible to solve for y, they can be differentiated by the method of known as implicit differentiation.
Appropriate applications of the rules for differentiations u, u v, u l/n , U, etc.
which you have studied in unit 6.
You should be able to carry out implicit differentiation.
The next question that comes to your mind 139MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS should be "what is implicit differentiation" this question is best answered by finding the derivative of the functions.
x2 + xy4 + y3x + x3 = 2 Solution: Differentiating both sides of the equation you get d (x2) + d (xy4) + d (y3x) + dx 3 = d(2) dx dx dx dx dx =2x + dx, y4 + x d(y) 4 + y3 dx + x d(y) 3 +3x2= 0 dx dx dx dx = 2x + I. y4 = 4xy3 dy + y3 + 3x y2 dy + 3x2 = 0 dx dx = (2x + y4 + 3x2 + y3) + (4xy3 + 3x y2) dy = 0 dx dy = - (2x + y 4 + 3x 2 + y 3 ) dx 4xy3 + 3xy2 Implicit differentiation is useful in finding the slope of a tangent to curves.

Example By differentiating the equation x2 + y – y2 implicitly show that dy = 2y - x dx 2x + y Solution: Differentiating with respect with y you have: d(x 2 ) d(xy) – d(y 2 ) = 0 dy dy dy 2x dx + x + y d - 2y = 0 dy d dx (2x + y) = 2y – x dy dx = 2y – x dy 2x + y 3.3 Higher Order Differentiation You will start this section with the study of second derivative of a function where it exist and then extend it to higher order.
143MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Let y = ƒ (x) be a differentiable function of x.
Then it has a derivative given as dy = ƒ 1 (x) dx ƒ 1 (x) is a function let: Then g1(x) = d 2 y which is the second derivative of function y = ƒ (x) .
dx2 Which is written as d 2 y or ƒ 11 (x) dx2 Example Let y = 4x3 Find d 2 y dx2 Solution dx = d (4x3) = 12x2 dy d d 2 y = d (12x2) = 24x dx2 d Example y = x3 - 2x2 + x. find d 2 y dx2 dy = d (x3 - 2x2 + x )=3x2 – 4x + 1 dx d d 2 y = (3x2 - 4x + 1) dx2 = 6x - 4 Since you now know what a second derivation of higher order.
The idea here is that so long as you have differentiability, you can continue to differentiate y = ƒ (x) from dy dx 144MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ƒ 1(x) and dy = ƒ 1(x) to form dy = ƒ 11(x) and dy = ƒ 11(x) to form dy = ƒ111 (x) dx dx2 dx2 = dx3 And so on until you get to an nth order i.e.
d(y) = dy , d dy = d 2 y dx dx d dx dx2 d d 2 y d 3 y d d 3 y = d 4 y d dx2 dx3 d dx3 dx4 d (d n-1 g) = dny d dxn-1 dxn Example Let y = x5 + x4 + x3 + 1 Then dy = 5x4 + 4x3 + 3x2 dx d 2 y = 20x3 + 12x2 + 6x dx2 d 3 y = 60x3 + 24x2 + 6x dx3 d 4 y = 120x + 24 dx4 d 555 y = 120 dx5 d 6 y = 0 dx6 d > 1y = d 8 y = … = d "y = 0 dx1 dx8 dxn In the above example all derivatives of order higher than 5 are identically zero.
You can see that derivative of a polynomial function is again a polynomial function.
This implies that polynomial functions have derivatives of all order so also, is all rational functions.

152MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS UNIT 2 DIFFERENTIATION OF LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Differentiation of the Logarithm Function 3.2 Logarithmic Differentiation 3.3 Differentiation of Exponential Functions 3.4 Differentiation of the Function au 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION So far you have studied differentiation of functions such as polynomials and rational functions.
In this unit you will be studying differentiation of two special functions namely natural log and exponential which have practical applications in real life problems such as computation of compound interest accruing from money deposited or borrowed from financial institutions.
Another application where the differentiation of these two special functions could be applied is in the prediction of growth or decay of a radioactive substance.
The two functions natural logarithm and exponential functions that will be subject of study in this unit, are related to one another because one is the inverse functions of the others.
That is ƒ-1(natural logarithm) = exponential function and the ƒ-1 (exponential function) is the natural logarithm.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly: 1) Differentiate logarithmic functions 2) Carry out logarithmic differentiation 3) Differentiate exponential functions 4) Find the derivative of the function au 5) Find the derivative of the function log u. a 153MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Differentiation of the Logarithm Functions You will review some properties of logarithm functions you are already familiar with.
(1) x = 1og y if ax = y a (2) the log of a product = the sum of the logs.
Keeping the above in mind you should be able to recall the following: let ƒ (x) = log x then ƒ (x, y) = ƒ (x) + ƒ (y) …….. (I) suppose ƒ (x) = 1 then ƒ (1) = ƒ (1 .
1) = ƒ (1) + ƒ (1) = 2 ƒ (1) (cid:222) ƒ (1) = 2 ƒ (1) (cid:222) 0 = ƒ (1).
......... (II) if this is true for x > 0 Then 0 = ƒ (1) = ƒ (x .
1/x) = ƒ (x) + ƒ (1/x ) (cid:222) = ƒ (1/x) = ƒ (x) ………….. (III) Taking x > 0 and y > 0 then ƒ (y/x) = ƒ (y .
1/x) = ƒ (y) + ƒ (1/x) = ƒ (y) – ƒ (x) (Using equation II) ƒ (y/x) ƒ (y) – ƒ (x) ................... (IV) Still keeping x > 0 and using equation I you get ƒ (x .
x .
x.... x) = ƒ (xn) = ƒ (x) + .....+ ƒ (x) = n ƒ (x) ƒ (xn) = n ƒ (x).
154MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Replacing ƒ (x) by log x you get the 3 basic properties.
(1) log (x y) = log x +log y (2) log(y/x) = log x – log y (3) log (xp) = p log x.
You will now attempt to derive a formula for the derivative of a logarithm function.
Let log x = ƒ (x) and x > 0 where ƒ is assumed to be a non- constant differentiable function of x which has all the properties of a logarithm stated above let ∆x be an increment resulting in a corresponding increment in ƒ(x).
Then the difference quotient can be formed as ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ(x) ∆x __________ (A) Since ƒ (x) is a logarithmic function.
You can re-write the above equations (A) as ƒ (x +∆) - ƒ (x) = ƒ (x+∆x) = ƒ (1+ ∆x) x x Hence ƒ (x +∆) - ƒ(x) = ƒ (x+∆x) ∆x x Multiplying equation (B) x/x and noting that f (l) = 0 you get ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) = 1 ƒ (1 + ∆x/x) – ƒ (1)) ∆x x ∆x/x Taking limits of equation (C) as ∆x -----> 0 you get Lim ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) lim 1 lim ƒ (1 + ∆x/x) – f (1) = I ∆x x ∆x/x ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 ∆x ﬁ 0 155MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS = 1 lim ƒ (1 + ∆x/x) – f (1)) ∆x/x ∆x ﬁ 0 ƒ 1 (x) = 1/x f 1(1) (cid:222) d [ f(x) ] = d [log x] = 1 where ƒ 1 (x) = 1 dx dx x (Since f is a non-constant function ƒ 1(1) ≠ 0).
If u is a differentiable positive function of x (i.e.
u(x) > 0 and ul (x) exist) Then d (l nu ) = d lnu du = 1 du dx du dx u dx Example: Find d log(x2 + 1).
dx Solution Let u = x2 + 1 here u > 0 " e R. Then d (x2 + 1).
= 1 2x = 2x _ dx x2 +1 x2 +1 Example: Find d log 1 _ dx x2 + 1 Solution Let u = 1 here u > 0 V x e R. x2 + 1 Then d log 1 d (log u) = 1 du dx (x2 + 1) dx u dx = x2 +1 - 2x = - 2x _ (x2 + 1)2 (x2 + 1) Example: Show that d (log /x/ ) = 1 dx x 156MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Solution: For x > 0 d (log /x/ ) = d (log x) = 1 /x/ = x for x > 0 dx dx x For x < 0, / x/ = x .
Therefore d (log /x/ ) = d (log -x) dx dx Here let u = - x du = - 1 d (u) = 1 dx dx u d (log /x/ ) = 1 .
( -1) = 1 .
( -1) = 1 dx u x x Example: Find d log /1 - x2 / dx Solution Let u = 1- x2, then d log /u/ dx = 1 .
- 2x = - 2x = 2x 1 - x 1 – x2 x2 -1 Example: Find d log x 4 , x ≠ 1. dx x - 1 Solution Let u = xΔ du = (3x - 4)x 3 x + 1 dx (x-1)2, Then d log = 1 .
du = x – 1 .
(3x - 4)x 3 dx u dx x4 (x – 1)2 = (3x - 4) x(x – 1) 3.2 Logarithmic Differentiation The Natural Logarithm: In previous section you have differentiated a general logarithm function.
That is the base to which the logarithm is 157MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS taken was not mentioned.
Every logarithm studied so far are mainly of two types log x or log x.
The latter is the one you will study in this l0 e section.
Remark: The natural logarithm is that function ƒ(x) = log x that is the e logarithm to base e (the number e is taken after Leonard Euler (1707 -1783)(There are logarithm to base other than e or 10.)
The interesting thing about the study of differentiation of the natural logarithm is that its definition depends so much on calculus.
You will consider the definition after you have studied the second course on calculus i.e.
integral calculus.
You have to make do with the fact that Ln x = log x = the natural logarithm.
e The above satisfies all the basic properties of a logarithm function reviewed in the previous section.
In practice it has been observed that finding the derivatives of certain functions could be a difficult task.
But with appropriate application of the natural logarithm, derivatives of such functions could easily be found.
The method involves taking the natural logarithm Ln of both sides of the given equation before differentiation.
This method is called logarithmic differentiation.
Example Suppose y =ƒ(x) Find dy/dx Step 1. take natural logarithm both sides Ln y = In ƒ (x) _______ (I) Step 2.
Differentiate both sides with x d (In y) = d (In ƒ (x) ) ________ (II) dx dx dy = y d (In ƒ (x)) dx dx Let y = un u(x) is a differentiable function of x.
Taking log of both sides you get: 158MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Lny =1n Un Lny = nln U d (Iny) = d (nlnu) dx dx 1 dy = n ( 1 du ) y dx u dx dy = n y ( 1 ) du dx u dx = nu n du (since y = un) u dx = nun-1 du dx Which is the same result derived in unit 7.
Example: Find dy/dx If y = x x+l , x > 0 Solution Y = x x+1 (taking natural log of both sides) Ln y = ln (xx+1) Lny = x + 1 In x (differentiate with x) 1 dy = In x + (x+1) y dx x dy = ln x+ (x+1) y = ln x + ( x + 1 ) xx+1 dx x x =(xlnx + x + 1)xx Example: Find dy if y = (x 2 + 1) 3 (2x -1) 2 dx (x2 + I) 159MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Solution: Y = (x 2 + 1) 3 (2x -1) 2 (taking In of both sides) (x2 + 1) (x 2 + 1) 3 (2x - 1 ) 2 Lny = 1n (x2 + 1) Lny = In (x2 + 1)3 + In (2x -1)2 - In (x2 + 1) d (lny) = d 31n (x2 + 1) + 2 1n (2x -1) - In (x2 + 1) dx dx 1 dy = 3 .2x + 2 _ .2 - 2x__ y dx x2 +1 2x - 1 x2 + 1. dy = 6x + 4 - 2x .

The function ƒ (x) = ex for all real number x is called the exponential function.
At this stage you will review some properties of the exponential function which you are already familiar with.
(I) log ex = x for all real number x (II) ex > 0 for all real number x (III) elogx = x for all x > 0 (IV) ex+y = ex ey for all real x and y (V) ex-y = ex/ey for all real x and y The derivative of the exponential function is the exponential function.
This singular property distinguishes it as the only indestructible function.
i.e.
_____________ (I) To prove the above you start by noting that Taking the derivative of both sides of equation(2) you get: d (log ex) = d (x) d .
dx _______________ (3) You can write equation (4) above in a general form.
By letting y = e° where u is a real and differentiable function of x. i.e.
dy = d ( eu) by applying dx dx the chain rule for differentiation you get that 162MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS dy = eu du dx dx Example: find dy if dx (I) y = e(cid:214) x (III) y = e (x+1)2 (IV) y = e(cid:214) x +I (V) y = e(x+1)3 Solutions (I) y = e(cid:214) x = eu where u = x2 dy = eu du = e (cid:214) x .

You have applied rules of differentiation to differentiate the sums, products, quotients and roots of these functions.
In this unit you will be differentiating the class of functions which are periodic.
Such periodic function are best studied using trigonometric ratios such as sine and cosines.
You are already familiar with trigonometric ratios of cosines and sines in your SSCE/GCE mathematics.
Their properties are briefly studied here as (see Fig 9.1) (i) sin q = y (ii) cos q = x/r (iii) tan q = (iv) cosec q = r/y (v) sec q = r/x and (vi) cot = x/y Y P(x, y) r q X 0 x N 172MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS The trigonometric ratios given above are structured by placing an angle of measure q in standard position at the center of a circle of radius r and finding the ratios of the sides of the triangle O PN.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly: i) derive the derivation of the function y = sin x from first principle.
ii) derive the derivatives of trigonometric function such as cos x, tan x, cosec x and sec x. iii) differentiate combination of various types of trigonometric functions.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Differentiation of Sines A good starting point for the differentiation of the trigonometric ratio of sine is imbedded in the concept of evaluating the limit.
Lim sin q where q is measured q q ﬁ q in radian ( a radian measure is uniteless) Fig 9.2 r s q q ( in radian) = s/r Prove that Lim sin q q is 1 q q ﬁ q 173MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS From the above a direct calculation will not be possible because division by zero is not possible.
Therefore, you have to go through a formal proof of the above since you will need to find the derivative of the function ƒ(x) = sin u.
Proof Let q > O and also measured in radian Let q be a small angle at the center of the circle (see Fig 9.3) or radian radius r = 1 Y Q X Fig 9.3.
In fig 9.3 OP and OA are side of the angle 0.
OA is the targent to the cicle at point A and meets side OP at Q.
Note that Area of AOPA = ½ base x height = ½ (OA) (h) = ½ (1) (OP sineq ) = ½ (1) (1)sinq = ½ sinq Area of sector OPA = ½ r2 q = ½ (1) 2 q .
Area of ∆OQA = ½ (OA) (QA) = ½ (1) (tan q ) = ½ tan q .

In this unit you will study how to differentiate their respective inverses.
The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are very useful in evaluating integral, of a certain trigonometric functions.
Therefore your understanding of this unit will help you tremendously in the course on integral calculus i.e.
calculusis.
In this unit you shall also differentiate a special class of function that is derived as a combination of exponential ex and e-x which you are already familiar with in previous units.
These combination produce functions that are called hyperbolic functions.
They are engineering problems.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly: 1) differentiate the inverse trigonometric functions such as arc(sin u) , arc (cos u) arc (tan u), arc (sec u) and arc (cosec u).
2) Find the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic function of arc (sin hu) and arc (cos hu) etc.
187MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Differentiation of Inverse Sine and Cosines Functions In this unit you will use the knowledge you acquired when you studied unit 2 and unit 9 to study the inverse of a trigonometric function.
This section is important because the concept you will study here will be useful in the second course of calculus.
Recall that the inverse of a function ƒ(x) is that function.
ƒ -1(x) for which its composite with ƒ(x) yields the identical function: i.e.
ƒ (ƒ -1 (x)) = ƒ 1 (ƒ (x)) = x.
You could begin the study of differentiation of trigonometric functions by examining the inverse of the sine function.
Consider the equation x = sin y In this equation you can show that infinitely many values of y corresponds to each x in the interval [-1,1 ] i.e.
only one of these values y lies in the interval - p , p 2 2 .
For example if x = ½ then you might wish to know the values of all angles y such that sin y = ½ .
These two angles y = 30° and y = 150° will come readily to your mind.
Multiples of these two angles will give the sine value to be ½ .
i.e.
sin 30° = ½ , sin 150° = ½ .
sin k y = ½ for k = 1, 2, ..., and y = p /6, note that 1500 = 5(30°).
Consider the graph of y = sin x as shown in fig.
9.3.
188MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Y 1 - -p / X - -1 If you interchange the letters(variables) x and y in the original equation y = sin x you will clearly see the what is being discussed so far in this section .
That is x = sin y, x ε [ -l, 1 ] and In the interval [- p /2, - p /2] the function f (x) = sin x is a one to one function (see Fig 9.3 no horizontal line cuts the graphs only once).
Therefore within the interval [- p /2, - p /2] the inverse exist and it called the inverse sine function and it is written as y = arc sin x (or sin-' (x)) (see Fig 9.4 and 9.5.)
Remark: You will use the arc sin x frequently to represent the inverse sine function.
The notation sin-1(x) could be used if you are sure you will not confuse it with the function 1 sin x.
189MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Y Y = sin x - 1 X - p /2 p /2 - -1 Fig: 9.5 In Fig 9.4 the function y = sin x is a continuous so also is y = arc (sin x).
The function dy = d (sin x) = cos x dx d2 is defined in the interval - p , p and there is no x ε - p , p 2 2 .

such that cos x = 0.
So also the derivative of the inverse sine function does not take any value zero in the open interval ( -1, 1 ) i.e.
d (arc sin x) ≠ 0 " x ε ( - 1, 1 ) With the above information you can now proceed to derive a formula for the derivative of arc sin x.
Let ƒ (x) = sin x Then ƒ -1(x) = arc sin x Note that ƒ (ƒ -1(x)) = x.
Therefore d - (ƒ (ƒ -1 (x)) = d (x) = 1 dx dx 190MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (cid:222) d sin(arcsin x) =1.
dx (cid:222) cos(arcsin x) d (a arcsin x) =1.
dx Hence d (arcsin x) = 1 _ dx cos(a arcsin x) = 1 (cid:214) 1 – sin2 (arcsin x) note that : cos2 x + sin2 x = 1 (cid:222) cos x = (cid:214) 1- sin2x) thus d (arc sin x) = 1 dx (cid:214) 1 – x2 note also that; sin(arc sin x) = x then (sin(arc sin x)2 =x2) you could also derive the above formula by applying implicit differentiation Given that: y = arc sin x (cid:222) sin y = x then (cid:222) d (sin y) = dx d dx cos y dy = 1 dx dy = 1 = 1 dx cos y (cid:214) 1- sin2 y putting y = arc sin x and sin y = x you get : d (arc sin x) = 1 dx (cid:214) 1- x2 let y = arc sin u where u is a differentiable function of x.
191MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Then; d (arc sin u) = 1 du dx (cid:214) 1 - u2 dx.
Differentiation of Inverse Cosine Given that y = arc cos u Let cos y = u Then d (cos y) = dy dx dx -sin y dy = dy dx dx dy = -1 dy dx sin y dx sin y = (cid:214) 1- cos2 y. where cos y = u Therefore d (arc cos u) = 1 du dx (cid:214) 1 - u2 dx.
Differentiation of Inverse Tangent Given that y = arc tan u Let tan y = u then d (tan y) = du dx dx sec2 y dy = du dx dx dy = 1 du dx Sec2 y dx.
(note that if tan2 y = sec2 y and tan y == u) 192MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS therefore dy = 1 du = 1 du dx 1 + tan7y dx 1 + u2 dx hence d (arc tan u) = 1 du dx 1 + u2 dx.
Differentiation of arc sec u.
Given that y = arc sec u Let sec y = u d (sec y) = du dx dx sec yt an y dy = du dx dx dy = 1 du dx sec y tan y dx (note that tan y = ± (cid:214) sec2 y – 1 and sec y = u) therefore dx u ± (cid:214) u2 – 1 dx.
hence d (arc tan u) = 1 du dx /u/(cid:214) u2 - 1 dx.
DIFFERENTIATION OF y = arc cot u Give y = arc cot u Let cot y = u d (cot y) = du dx dx 193MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS - cossec2 y dy = dx dx dx dy = - 1 du dx cosec2 y dx (but cosec2 y =1 + cot2 y, cot y = u) then d (arc cot u) = 1 du dx 1 + u2 dx.
DIFFERENTIATION OF y = arc cosec u.
Given that y = arc cosec u.
Then cosec y = u - cot y cosecy dy = du dx dx dy = - 1 du dx cot y cosecy dx.
but cot y = ± (cid:214) cosec2 y – 1 cosec y = u then dy = - 1 du dx u(cid:214) u2 – 1 dx.
Therefore d (arc tan u) = 1 du dx /u/(cid:214) u2 - 1 dx.

These combinations occur in two basic forms ½ (ex + e-') and ½ (ex - e-x).
They occur so frequently that they have to be given a special attention.
The types of function described above are known as hyperbolic functions (see unit 2 sec 3.2 for more details).
Definition: The hyperbolic sine and cosine are functions written as Sin h x = ½ (ex + e-x)and Cos h x = ½ (ex - e-x) (Recall that the word hyperbolic is formed from the word hyperbola see unit 2 sec.
3.2).
Given sin h x and cos h x defined above you can easily form other hyperbolic function of tangent cotangent, secant and cosecant by noting that Sin h x = ½ (ex + e-x)and Cos h x = ½ (ex – é-x) Then 1. tan h x = sin h x = e x – e -x cos h x ex + e-x 196MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 2. cot h x = cos h x = e x – e -x sin h x ex + e-x 3. cosec h x = 1 = 2 sin h x ex + e-x 4. sec hx = 1 = 2 cos h x ex + e-x You will briefly review some of the identities associated with hyperbolic functions they follow the same pattern with those derived for trigonometric functions.
Note that the equation of a unit hyperbola is given as x2 - y2 = 1 if you put x =cos h q and sin h q = y then x2 = cosh2 q and y2 = sin h2 q (cid:222) cos h2 - sin h2 q = 1 _________ (1) Then by substituting appropriately you get the following identities 1- tan h2 q = cosec h2 q __________ (2) cot h2 q - 1 = cosec h2 q ___________(3) The identities will be useful in finding the derivative of inverse hyperbolic functions.

You have been exposed to numerous examples involving the differentiation of these function discussed.
Some of the examples were repeated in another format for example some of the examples used in unit 8 were used to explain the concept of differentiation of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
This is a deliberate attempt so that you will master the technique studied in this unit.
The differentiation of inverse function of trigonometric and hyperbolic will be very useful when studying the next course on calculus that is integral calculus.
Make sure you go through the example thoroughly because you will need them in the second course in calculus.

The second derivative is used to determine points at which the curve is concave upward or concave downwards or information could then be used to sketch the curve of a given functions.
In this unit you will study how to use both the first and second derivative to sketch the graph of a function at every points of the graph.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: 1) Use the first to determine 209MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (i) points at which the given curves is increasing i.e.
dy > 0. dx (ii) Points at which the a given curve is decreasing i.e.
dy < 0 dx and (iii) Points at which a given curve is stationary i.e.
dy = 0 dx (2) Use the second derivative to determine points at which a graph is concave upwards or concave downwards.
3.1 Significance of The First Derivative to Curve Sketching You will now consider the application of differentiation to curve sketching some curve could easily be sketched with the knowledge of the first and second derivatives of the function and the points where the first derivatives vanish i.e.
equal to zero.
You have already studied functions that are monotonic increasing or decreasing within an interval (see unit 2, section 3.2).
You could determine whether a function is monotonic decreasing or increasing in a given interval.
This is done by checking if the value of the first derivative within the given interval is positive or negative.
This is stated as follows: A function y = ƒ(x) is monotonic (i) increasing in x ε [a, b] if dy > 0 " x ε [a, b] dx (ii) decreasing in x ε [a, b] if dy < 0 " x ε [a, b] dx (iii) constant (stationary) in x ε [a, b] if dy = 0 dx Example Use the above stated facts to sketch the curve y = x2 for x ε [-10, 10].
Solution y = x2 dy =2x when x = 0 dy = 0 dx dx 210MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Start by first considering the values of dy/dx = 2x at points on the left of x = 0.
For x ε [-10, 10].
dy = 2x < 0 (decreasing) dx For the values of dy =2x at points on the right of x = 0. dx i.e.
x [-10,10]; dy =2x > 0 (increasing) dx (see fig: 10.
1 ) g constant n si a e cr n I -10 g n 10 si a e rc n i Fig 10.2 211MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example Let y = x3 dy = 3x2 dx when x = 0, dy = 0 dx The values of dx/dy at points to the left and right of the point x = 0 is given as (i) for.
x [-10, 0]; dy =3x2 > o (increasing) (ii) for.
x [0, 10]; dy =3x2 >- o (increasing) dx see fig 10.2.
Example Given y= 1 x3 + x2 - 8x + 1 3 dy = x2 + 2x - 8 dx = (x - 2) x (x + 4 ) = 0 x = 2 or - 4.
As before you will consider values of dy dx respectively.
i.e.
at points to the left and right of 2 and – 4 respectively.
i.e.
At x = 2 2. dy > 0 for all x ε (2, α ) i.e.
increasing at the right side of dx dy < 0 for all x ε (-4, 2) between - 4 and 2 dx 212MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS dy > 0 for all x ε ( -α , - 4) dx (see Fig 10.3) 3.2 Significance of the Sign of Seemed Derivative Curve Sketching The above sketch could be improved if you apply the information you get by taking the second derivative of the function under investigation.
A quick look at the graph shown in Fig.
10 3. shows that within the interval x ε (- 4, 1o) the graph is concave upward.
Within the interval x x ε (-10, - 4) the curve is concave downward.
Once you find the point at which dy/dx = 0 (i.e.
the turning points along the curve y = ƒ(x).
Then by finding the second derivative d2y/dx2 you can determine which of the turning points (i.e.
points at dx/dy = 0) is the concave upwards or downwards.
Definition: If d 2 y exists and d 2 y > 0 , dx2 dx2 for all x in a specified interval 1, then dy/dx is said to be increasing in I and the graph of ƒ(x).
is said to be concave upwards.
If d 2 y < 0 for all x ε I, the dy is decreasing in I. dx2 dx So that the graph of y = f(x).
is said to be concave downwards.
213MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.3 Curve Sketching Definition of Points of Inflection A point where the curve changes its concavity from downwards to upwards or vice versa is called a point of inflection This occurs where d 2 y = 0 or where d 2 y does not exists.
dx2 dx2 Example y = 3x1/3 dy = x-2/3 dx at x= 0 dy is not defined.
dx So the point x = 0 is a point of inflection for the y = 3x1/3 Example Given that y = ƒ(x).
Let the following explain the behaviour of the curve.
(1) At point x = a dy 1 = 0 if x = ± a dx The curve increases or decreases as indicated below.

Let the curve cut the y - axis at the point y = b, x = 0.
Let the curve cut the x- axis at the points -x and x sketch the l 2 given curve.

On step 5 use the information about the curve increasing and decreasing i.e.

222MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS UNIT 2 MAXIMUM – MINIMUM AND RATE PROBLEMS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Definition of Global and Local Minimum and Maximum Values 3.2 Application of Differentiation to Maximum and Minimum 3.3 Application of Rate Problems 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignments 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this unit you will study how to use first and second derivative of a function to solve optimization problems in social sciences, physics, chemistry, engineering etc.
That is any problem where the information on how small or how big a given quantity should be is needed.
It assumed that such problem should be able to be modelled by any mathematical formula.
By differentiating such a function you can determine it minimum or maximum value.
Differentiation could be applied to problems where it necessary to determine the rate at which a quantity is changing with respect to another quantity.
There are various classes of problems that could be solved by appropriate application of differential calculus the ones enumerated in this unit and some where else is the course is by no mean exhausture.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly: 1) use first and second differentiation of a function to solve problems where the minimum amount of resources or material is required.
2) Use first and second differentiation of a function to solve problems where maximum value of a resources or material needed or should be attained 3) Use differentiation of a function to determine the rate at which a given quantity is changing with respect to another quantity.
223MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Global and Local Minimum ad Maximum Value In this section you will be able to use both first derivative and where necessary the second derivative to solve problems of classical optimization in economics, engineering, medicine and physics etc.
The words minimum and maximum give the impression of a problem where you may wish to determine how small (minimum) or how large (maximum) a variable quantity may attain.
You will start by considering the following important definitions.
Definition: A function ƒ(x) is said to have a local (or relative) maximum at point x = x if o ƒ (x) > ƒ (x + h) o For all positive and negative value of h however small It is said to have a local (or relative minimum at point x = x if o ƒ (x) < ƒ (x + h) for all values of h however small.
o Definition: A function ƒ (x) is said to have an absolute (global) maximum at x = x if f(x) > ƒ (x) for all values of x in the domain of o definition.
It is said to have an absolute (global minimum at x = xo if ƒ (x ) < ƒ (x) for all values of x in the domain of definition.
o Example In Fig 10.5, you will notice that there are five turning points i.e.
stationary points the points at which dy = 0 dx Y A C E B D X X o 224MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Points E and C are points where the curve attains maximum or local maximum, while at point A the curve attains an absolute maximum or global maximum within the interval x ε [0, x ] point B is a local o maximum point while point D is a global minimum point.
Example: Given that y = x + 9/x dy = (1 – 9 ) = (x2 – 9) = 0, x = ± 3 dx x2 The point x = -3 is a relative maximum and not global maximum (see Fig 10.4) The point x = -3 is a relative minimum point.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Explain why the point x = 3 is not a global minimum for the curve given as y = x + 9 x (Hint consider points near x = 3) Example if y - 3x4- 16x3 +24x2 + 1 Determine whether the function has a maximum or minimum points.
Solution Y = 3x4 - 16x3 - 24x2 - 1 dy = 4.3x3 - 3.16x2 - 2.24x dx = 12x3 - 48x2 - 48x = 12x(x2 - 4x + 4) = 12x(x -2)(x - 2) =0 x = 0,or 2.
To determine which of the two points is a maximum or minimum the second derivative of these points will have to be evaluated i. e. d 2 y = 3.
12x2 - 2.48x + 48 dx2 = 36x2 - 96x + 48 225MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS At x = 0, d 2 y = 48 dx2 d 2 y > 0 is a point of global minimum.
dx2 At x = 2 d 2 y = 36(2)2 - 96(6) + 48 = 0 dx2 Look at points near 2.
Increasing decreasing 2 Y Y = 3x4 – 16x3 + 24x2 + 1.
X 2 Therefore the point x = 2 is a point of inflection.
3.2 Application to Minimum and Maximum Problems It time to use the theory explained above to solve practical problems that call for the minimization or maximization of values of a function.
Example: Find two possible positive numbers whose product is 36 and whose sum could be made relatively small Solution You could start by making a guess based on the fact that the factors of 36 that are positive are: 226MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (6, 6), (9, 4), (36, 1), (12, 3), (2, 18).
Taking their sum you see that 12 < 13 < 15 < 20 < 37.
So the number could is 6.
It could be cumbersome to solve such a problem if the number is very large, find factors of a possible short cut is to apply differentiation.
We need to note, that x and 36/x are two numbers whose product is 36.
Their sum is given as a function y = ƒ(x) x The issue at stake is to see the positive values of x that will give the problem is now reduced to the problem of minimization of the value of the function y = x + 36 Since y = x + 36 x d = 1 + 36 = 0 dx x2 ==> x2 – 36 = 0 d 2 y = + 72 dx2 x3 if x = - 6 d 2 y < 0 maximum point dx2 if x = 6 d 2 y > 0 minimum point.
dx2 Therefore the answer is x = 6.
227MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Example The management of a manufacturing company found out that their profit was not enough as that wish it should be.
A mathematical formulation gives the cost of production and distribution as N a.
The selling price is N x.
The number sold at a given period is put at n = K/ (x2 - a) + C(100 - x2) where K and C are certain constants.
What selling price will bring a maximum profit to the company.
Solution The first thing to do is to find or formulate an equation that gives the total profit for the company.
Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost i.e.
P = N (n x - n a).
= (x - a) (K/(x - a) + C (100 - x) = K+C (100-x) (x-a) dp = C[(100-x) 1 +(x-a)-1] dx dp = 0=:> 100 – x = x – a dx 2x = 100 - a x = 100 + a 2 N x is the selling price therefore x > 0 .
Having this in mind you find d 2 P = - 23C hence C > 0. dx2 To guarantee that d 2 P < 0. dx2 100+a The selling price that give the maximum profit is given as x = 2.
228MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Hence the above shows that the selling price is determined by the cost of production and distribution.
Example An open storage tank with square base and vertical sides is to be constructed from a given amount of plastic material calculate the dimensions that will produce a maximum volume.
Solution The formula for the volume of a rectangular box is given as V = base x height (see Fig.
10.6) Let base = x2 (square base of side = x) \ V=x2h Total surface area of tank = Total amount of material h x x x x Therefore A = 4 x h + x2 Solving for h you get but V = x2h = x 2 (A - x 2 ) = x (A - x2 4x 4 229MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS = ¼ [(A – x2 - 2x2)] Let dv = 0 =:> [(A - x2 - 2x2)] = 0 dx (cid:222) A = 3x2 => x = ± (cid:214) A/3 Since x represent sides of the tank definitely x > 0 therefore x = ± (cid:214) A/3 To check if this value of V you evaluate second derivative at x = (cid:214) A/3 i.e.
d 2 y = 1 (-6x) < 0 dx2 4 for x > 0 d 2 v < 0.
Thus x = (cid:214) A/3 dx2 is a maximum point for the function V = x2 h. Therefore the dimension that will yield maximum volume is given as x = (cid:214) A/3and h = A - x 2 = A - A/3 = 1 (cid:214) A/3 4x 4(cid:214) A/3 2 Thus x = x = (cid:214) A/3, h = x = ½ (cid:214) A/3 This is dependent on the surface area of tank chosen.
In the next example you will consider the case where you will seek to minimize the amount of material to be used.
Example Given a storage rectangular tank with a square base can contain 32m2 of water.
Find the dimensions that require the least amount of material to construct such a tank.
(Neglect the thickness of the material and the waste in construction.
Solution Let V = x2 h be the volume of the rectangular tank (see Fig 10.
6) But V = -32m3 therefore 32 = x2 h 230MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (cid:222) 32 = h x2 Since the amount required to build the tank is equal to surface area of the tank which is given as A = 4 x h + x = 4x ( 32) + x2 = 128 + x2 x2 x \ d A = - 128 + 2x dx x2 equating to zero you get -128 + 2x = 0 x2 \ -128 + 2x3 = 0 x3 = 64. x = 4 For x = 4 d A = 0. dx To check if x = 4 is a minimum point you evaluate d2A/dx2 at x = 4 i.e.
d 2 A = 256 + 2 dx2 x3 Since x > 0 =:> d 2 A = 4 + 2 = 6 > 0 dx2 Thus at x = 4 the function has a minimum value.

3.3 Application to Rate Problem You have already study that the derivative of a function gives its rates of change.
In other words suppose you have a qualities y which varies with another quality x, them the rate of change of y with respect to x is given as dy/dx.
You would have study this type of problem under the topic variation during your course of study in your preparation for the GCE 0 level or SSCE examination.
That is y is increasing or decreasing with respect to x as according as dy/dx is positive or negative.
This situation was described under the section on application to curve sketching, i.e.
dy/dx > 0 implies that the function y = ƒ (x) is increasing while dy/dx == ƒ (x) is decreasing Example: Suppose the amount of petrol y litres in a car tank after traveling x kilometers is given as y = 30 – 0.02x Then dy = -0.02 dx The negative sign means that y decreases as x increases.
Hence the amount of petrol in the car's tank is decreasing at the rate of 0.02 It.
I km.
Example: A circular sheet of material has a radius of 4cm.
At what rate is the area increasing with respect to the radius?
If the 235MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS radius increases to 4.2cm, what is the approximate increase in the area.
Solution Let radius of circular sheet be r cm and the area be represented as A cm 2 Therefore A =p r2 (area of a circle with radius r) The rate of increase of A with respect to r is given as d A = 2p r dr Thus if r = 4cm them dA = 2p (4) = 8p cm dr But dA = 2p r dr Let ∆A and ∆r be small changes in area and radius respectively The ∆A = 2p r ∆r Since r = 4 and ∆r = 0.2 = (4.2 - 4) cm Then ∆A = 2p (4) 0.2 = 1.4p Therefore the approximate increase in area is 1.4p cm2.
Example: A spherical balloon is inflated with gas.
If its radius is increasing at the rate of 2cm per second, how fast is the volume increasing when the radius is 8cm (see Fig 10.9) Solution The volume at time t is expressed in terms of the radius at time t by the formula v(t) = 4 p (r(t))3 3 dv(t) = 4p ( r(t) )2 dr dt dt 236MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS r(t ) If at time t the radius is 8 cm Then dv(t) = 4p (8)2 .2 = 512p .
dt This implies that the volume is increasing at the rate of 512p cm3 per second.
Example: water ns into a large concrete conical storage tank of radius 5 and its height is 1om (see Fig 10.10) at a constant rate of 3m3 per minute.
How fast is the water level rising when the water is 5m deep Solution: In this case the list of variable quantities will be given Quantities that are changing is V = the volume (m) of water in the tank at time (t) x = the radius (m3) of the Surface of the water at time t. y = the depth (m) of water in the tank at time t. 237MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS C Fig.

The function establishing a relation between the variable quantities is given as 1. v = 1p x2y (this is volume of cone = 1 p r2h.)
3 3 The function is better expressed in terms of only one variable x or y .
You can expressed it in terms of y alone.
By noting that in Fig 10.10 ∆ ABC and ∆DEC are similar triangles.

In this unit you will study how to estimate the changes produced in a function y = ƒ(x).
when x changes by a small amount ∆x.
In other words if there is a change in x by a very small amount ∆x, then there will be a corresponding changes ∆y in y.
The approximate estimate.
An important rate of change of distance with respect to time.
Which corresponds to the speed if a body in motion.
Of moving object at a given instant of time could be computed using the derivative of the distance function.
The second derivative of the distance function will produce the acceleration of the moving body.
The objective to achieve in the study of this unit is hereby studied.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to (i) Find the approximate value of the change in y = (x) if there is a small change in x.
(ii) To compute the velocity of a moving body at a given instant of time.
(iii) Compute the acceleration of a moving body at a given instant of time.
243MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Application to Approximation 3.1.1 Differential You will start the study of the application of differentiation by examining the concept of "differential" of y and x where ƒ (x).
= y.
Definition: If x is the independent variable and y = ƒ (x).
has a derivative at xo, say, define dx to be an independent variable with domain = R and define dy to be dy = ƒ 1(x).
dx.
You will now consider two types of changes that can take place within a specified domain of a function.
Let y = ƒ (x).
then an increment ∆x in x produces a corresponding increment ∆y in y .
Given that: Lim ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) = ƒ 1 (x) ∆x ﬁ 0 but ƒ 1(x) lim ƒ 1 (x) ∆x ∆ ∆x ﬁ 0 then lim ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) – ƒ 1 (x) ∆x = 0 ∆x The difference ƒ(x +∆x) - ƒ (x) is called the increment of ƒ from x it x + ∆x and is denoted by the symbol: ∆ ƒ = ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) The product ƒ 1(x) ∆x is called the differential at x with increment ∆x and is usually denoted by d ƒ: i.e.
d ƒ = ƒ l (x) ∆x.
Given that: ƒ ( x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) = ƒ 1(x) ∆x.
+ y(x) 244MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS for a very small ∆x.
∆ ƒ ≈ d ƒ .
where lim g(x) = 0 ∆x ∆x ﬁ 0 since y = ƒ (x) you could re-write the above as: ∆y (cid:222) dy then dy = ƒ 1(x) dx let x = ƒ (t) and y = g(t) then dx = ƒ 1(t)dt and dy = gl (t)dt, if dt ≠ 0 and ƒ 1(t) ≠ 0 then dy = g 1 (t) f1 (t) from the above you can say that a function y = ƒ (x) is the product of the derivative of the function and dx Example: The dimension of a square is x cm.
(i) how do small changes is x affect the area given as A =x2 Solution ∆ ƒ = ƒ (x + ∆x) - ƒ (x) = ƒ (x + ∆x)2 - x2 = 2x ∆x + (∆x)2 (cid:222) ƒ d = ƒ 1(x) ∆x = 2x ∆x The error of the estimate is the difference between the actual change and the estimated change that is ∆ ƒ - d ƒ = (∆x)2 245MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS If ∆x ﬁ 0 then this error ﬁ 0 .
Example: Use differentials to determine how much the function.

This is defined as the distance traveled by a body divided by the time it takes the body to arrive the distance.
i.e speed = distance time In the above the motion must occur along a straight line.
Such as 0 S (motion of car along a straight road) However it might be a tricky question if you want to know the speed of a body in at a given instant along a curve.
For example: The motion of a rocket fired into the air to be able to describe how fast the rocket is rising after say a few second it is fired might not be very clear as finding the speed of the car along a straight road.
To be able to know the speed of the rocket one must know the function that described the motion of the rocket in the air.
Again one must be able to know how fast the rocket is rising after it is fired for every single point in the curve describing the motion.
Un other words to be able to know how fast such a body is traveling one must know the velocity of the body at a given instant.
You are aware that to find the velocity of a body all you need to do is to find the distance between the staring or initial point and point at which you want to find the velocity.
i.e.
Average velocity = Dist (t ) - Dist(t ) o 1 t - t 1 o 249MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS where t = initial time and t = time traveled The above formula cannot o 1 give you the value of instantaneous velocity which is the object of study in the section.
Let a body travel along a curve ƒ (t) = t2, if you sub divide the entire time it took to cover this curve in a given interval of time t [t , t in a o 1 subinterval of length h .
Then the average velocity between to and to th will be given as; ƒ (toth) - ƒ (to) h The smaller h is the closer thus average velocity is to (2t + h).
so at the o time t = t this average velocity is 2t .
Take a closer took again at o o equation (1) you will agree that the average velocity at a given instant in the same process used in deriving the slope of a curve y = ƒ (t) at the point t = to thus the velocity of the body at time to is the same numerically with the slope of y = ƒ (t) = t2 at t = t .
o Definition: If ƒ (t) is the position of a moving body at time t, its velocity is defined as ; d ƒ (t) = lim ƒ (tth) - ƒ (t) dt h h -----> 0 its speed is defined as d ƒ (t) dt the above implies that you might have a negative velocity.
This always happen in the case of falling bodies.
In most textbooks the velocity of a body is represented as y. i.e.
if y = ƒ (t) then d ƒ (t) = y dt Example A shot is fired from a top of Abia Tower at Umuahia which is at a height 100 + 24t - 12t2 After t seconds.
Find (i) its velocity after 2 seconds (ii) its maximum height (iii) its velocity as the bullet hits the ground.
250MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Solution Let y (t) = 100 + 24 = - 2t2 Then d ƒ (t) = y(t) = 24 - 4t dt (i) After 2 saec t = 2.
\ y(2) = 24 - 4.2 = 16 m2/sec.
Since y(2) > 0 it implies that the bullet is rising.
Ans.
= 16m2/sec.
(ii) The maximum height can only be attained at the maximum value of y(t) i.e.
y(t) = 0, => 24 - 4t = 0 t = 6.
Y(12) = 100 + 24.6 - 2(6)2 =172 Observe that when the velocity = 0.
Then the bullet will start to fall down.
This occurs at the instant the bullet attain it highest point (see Fig 10.12) t 6 10 20 Fig 10.12.
At time t = 6 y(6) = 0 Y(16) = 172m.
is the maximum height Ans.
=172m.
(iii) When the bullet hits ground y(t) = 0 251MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS .'.
100 + 24t - 2t2 = 0 ==> t2 -12t -50 = 0 -12 ± (cid:214) 144 + 4.50 2 12 ± (cid:214) 344 = 12 ± 18.547 2 2 = 15.274 (see Fig 10.12) at = t = 15 .274. y(15.274) = 24 - 4 (15.274) = -37.096.
Ans.
-37.096 m/s.
This should be expected Since the bullet is falling down in practical terms the speed = 1 -37.096 m/s/ = 37.01 Compare to the rising speed of 16m/s at t = 2.

(iv) 12.5 10 20 3.3 Application of Differentiation to Acceleration If you applied brakes on a moving car it moves slower and slower it velocity decreases.
This implies that velocity, of a moving body can either be increasing decreasing or constant.
Definition : If the velocity of a moving body at t is given as v(t) the acceleration of the body is given as dv(t) - v(t) dt Put simply acceleration is the derivative of the velocity, i.e.
if measures the rate of change of velocity during motion.
If ƒ(t) represent the distance covered by a moving body after t second.
Then d 2 (cid:242) (t) = acceleration.
dt2 Simply put acceleration is the second derivative of the equation of the distance covered after t seconds.
Example A stone thrown above the ground attains a height of 100 + 24t -8t after t seconds.
253MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS Find the acceleration at time t. ƒ (t) = 100+ 241 - 8t2 ƒ (t) = 24 - 16t f (t) = -16 m/s.
Ans.
= -16m/s.
Example The distance covered by a moving body after t seconds is given as ƒ (t) = t3 - 3t3 + 2 Find the (i) acceleration of the body at t = 2 (ii) At what time will the acceleration equal to zero.
Solution ƒ (t) = t3 - 3t2 +2.
ƒ (t) = 3t2 - 6t ƒ (t) = 6t - 6.
At t = 2 ƒ (2) = 2.6-6 = 6m2 /see.

Ans: (i) 6m2/sec.
(ii) 1.

You could recall that this idea was extensively discussed in unit 6.You then use the slope of the tangent to compute the slope of the normal to the curve at the same point.
So it is necessary you review the slope f a curve studied in unit 6.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to correctly: (i) Find the slope of a tangent to a curve by method of differentiation.
(ii) Find the slope of a normal to a curve by the method of differentiation (iii) Derive the point-slope equation of a tangent at a given point of a curve.
(iv) Derive the point - slope equation of a normal at a given point of curve.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Point-Slope Equation of a Line Let a line L pass through the point P (x, y) and let Q (x, y) any other l l pint on the curve.
The slope of the line L is given as: 258MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS m = y - y 1 x - x 1 y – y = m (x –x ) ------ I 1 1 The above equation I is known as the point-slope form of the equation of the line L. Since it givens the equation of the line is terms of a single point P(x y ) on the line and the slope m of the line.
That is why it is 1 1 called the point -slope equation of a line.
Therefore once you know the coordinate of just one point on the curve and you can determine the slope of the tangent-line at that point by method of differentiation.
Then you can easily form the equation of the tangent -line by using equation I above.
Example: Given that the slope of a line is 2 and the line passes through the point P (2, - 2).
Write the equation of the line Solution Using point-slope formula y - y = m (x-x ) 1 1 and given that m = 2 x = 2 and y = - 2 1 1 1 1 then you have that: y- (-20) = 2(x-2) y = 2 = 2x-4y = 2x -6 which is the required equation of a line.
3.2 Equation of a Tangent to a Curve In unit 5 you studied that the slope of the curve y = f (x) at any given point is given as: m= (dy) = f1 (x) dx Which is also the slope of the tangent to curve y = f (x) at the given point (x y ).
1 1 Therefore the equation of a tangent - line to a given curve y = f(x) at a given point (x , y ).
On the curve can be written as; 1 1 259MTH 112 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS y -y = m (x-x ) 1 1 y - y = dy (x -x ) 1 1 dx (x , y ) 1 1 = f1(x ) (x-x ).
1 1 Therefore tangent is given as; y = f1(x )(x – x ) + y 1 1 1 3.3 Equation of Normal to Curve The normal is the line that is peculiar to the tangent.
As such if m is the slope of the tangent passing through the point (xl, yl) then the slope of the normal passing through the [point (xl yl) is given as; M = -1 N M T Since M = f1 (X1) T Then M = -1 N f (x ) 1 Therefore the equation of the normal line at point (x , y ) is given as; 1 1 y = -1 (x –x ) + y 1 1 f(x ) 1 Where y = f (x).
Examples Write the equation of the tangent to the following curves at the given points.

(ii) dy = 3x2, m = 3(x ) 2 = 3 (-1)2 = 3.

5y = -4x + 11 Equation of normal is Y = 5 (x – 1) + 2 4 4y = sx – 5 = 4y = 5x -3.
