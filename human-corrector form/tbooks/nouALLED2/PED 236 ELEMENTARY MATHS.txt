This can be conceived as steps of equal sizes along a line as shown below, with positive numbers to the right of zero and negative numbers to the left of zero.
-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 1: Number Line 1  This line is called a number line.
We can use it to perform the operations of addition.
A walk forward can be taken as positive numbers and a walk backward can be taken as negative numbers.
2.0 Objective At the end of this unit, you should be able to: i. correctly interpret positive and negative integer ii.
carry out the basic operations on integer.
ii.
identify daily life examples of position and negative number.
3.0 Main body 3.1 Meaning of Integer and Basic Arithmetic Operation An integer is any positive or negative whole number.
Basic arithmetic operation in integers are the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers.
We have idea about counting numbers and all counting numbers are positive numbers.
The opposite of positive is negative in the number line.
The numbers to the right of zero are positive numbers and the numbers to the left of zero are negative numbers.
The more a positive number move away from zero the bigger the number, but the more a negative number move away from zero the smaller the number i.e – 1 is greater than – 10.
3.2 Daily Life Example of Positive and Negative Numbers 1.
Let us take the ground level as our zero point.
A man that is tapping a palm tree is above the ground level, so the position of that man is positive.
On the other hand if a man is digging a well, the man is below the ground level.
The position of such a man is negative since he is under the ground.
So it can be said that positive distance are above the ground and negative distance are below the ground.
2.
If a man is said to moves ten (10) spaces to his right (forward) and then moves seven (7) spaces to the left (backward).
What is the man position from the starting point.
The man position forward is positive + 10 and the position backward is negative – 7.
His position is 3 spaces to the right from the starting point.
This can be written as +3.
3.
If a woman that lives in story building walks six (6) steps upstairs, and walks fourteen (14) steps downstairs.
What is her final position.
Her final position is 8 steps downstairs.
This can be written as -8.
2 3.3 Integers and Number Lines (a) Draw a horizontal line and divide it into equal parts.
Mark the starting point as zero.
(i) To the right of zero are positive numbers as shown below.
The arrow shows that the line continues indefinitely.

6: The four cardinal point.
Examples Location of points on the number line.
1.
If a straight road runs east-west through point o. the distances east of 0 are positive and the distances west of 0 are negative.
2.
If a straight road also runs from North-South thought point 0.
The distance north of zero is positive and that of south of zero is negative.
3.
Express the positions of the points below in terms of positive or negative distance.
(i) A is 15km west of 0.
(ii) B is 18km west of 0.
(iii) C is 20km east of 0.
(iv) D is 8km east of 0.
4  N Answer B A D C W E 18km 15km 8km 20km S (i) The distance of A is – 15km (ii) The distance of B is – 18km (iii) The distance of D is + 8km (iv) The distance of C is + 20km (4) From the above question, what is the distance between (i) A and D (ii) A & C (iii) B & D (iv) B & C (v) A & B (vi) C & D Answer (i) 15km + 8kn = 23km (ii) 15km + 20km = 35km (iii) 18km + 8km = 26km (iv) 18km + 20km = 38km (v) 18km - 15km = 3km (vi) 20km – 8km – 12km Self Assessment Exercise (1) In the pairs of number below, put the correct sign (> or <) between them; (a) -8, +6 (b) 0, -5 +4 (c) -2, +4 (d) -4, -8 (e) 10, -8 (2) Arrange the following numbers in orders, smallest first and represent it on a number line -8, +8, 0, -1, -15, -6, + 18, +1.
5 (3) When you move 8 steps to the west and then 10 steps to the east.
What is your present position from the starting point?
(4) A bucket of water was drawn from a well 18m deep and was taken to a story building 20m above the ground what is the final position of the bucket of water.
3.4 Addition of Integers Positive and negative numbers are called directed numbers.
When we move to the right hand or upwards we count positive numbers.
We count negative, when we move to the left or downward, depending on whether we use the horizontal or vertical number line.
We use the arrow signs to show the direction of movements.
3.4.1 Using Number Line Example 1 If I Count 4 steps to the right from the point zero, and from the present position count another 6 steps to the right.
Where will my final stop be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Therefore 4 + 6 = 10 Example 2 From point zero, count 8 steps to the right the count 6 steps to the left.
The final stop is at positive 2.
-8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Therefore +8 –(+6) = 2 Example 3 From point zero count 8 steps to the left and then 5 steps to the right.
The final stop is at negative -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6 (-8) + 5 = -3 Example 4 rom zero count 7 steps to the left and again another 6 steps to the left.
The final stop is at negative 13.
-15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 Therefore (-7) +(-6) = -13.
3.5 Subtraction of Integers Subtraction is the opposite of addition.
Example 1 From the point zero, move 10 steps to the right and then 4 steps to the left.
The final stop is at positive 6.
-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Therefore 10 – 4 = 6.
Example 2 From the point zero, move 5 steps to the right and 8 step to the left.
The final stop is at negative 3.
-11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Therefore 5 – 8 = – 3 .
Note: In subtraction, if the negative number is greater than the positive number the normal addition should be done but the answer will taken a negative sign.
i.e take the small number away from the big number, but the answer will have a negative sign since the bigger number has a negative sign.
7 (3) Evaluating without number line (a) (-9) – (-3) When there is a negative (minus) sign in between two numbers (each in a bracket), the negative sign will change whatever sign is in the following bracket.
If it is positive sign, it will change to negative sign and if it is negative signs, it will change to positive sign i.e (-9) – (-3) will now read (-9) +3 which will be done as – (9-3) = -6.
(b) 29 – (-18) will now read 29 + 18 = 47 (c) (-17) – (-28) will now read (-17) + 28 which will be done as 28 – 17 = 11 (d) -38 – (+ 5) will now read - 38 – 5 which will be done as - (38 + 5) = -43 4.0 Conclusion This unit considered the basic operations on integer.
The use of number lines in integer operations.

3.0 Content (1) Prime number are integer which is only divisible by 1 and itself; that is a prime number has only two factors which is 1 and itself.
Examples of primes numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
What is an Index?
It is an integer placed above and to the right of a number.
For example 53, 3 is the index of 5 and in 94, 4 is the index of 9.
In 53 above, 5 is the base number and 3 is the power.
So it is in 186 and 94, 18 and 9 are the base while 6 and 4 are the powers respectively.
The number 53 are read as “5 raised to power 3” Examples if prime numbers (1) Express 16 as the product of power of its primes 2 16 16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 2 8 That is 2 in 4 places which can also be written as 24 2 4 16 = 24 2 2 1 (2) Express 18 as a product of power of its prime 2 18 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 3 9 i.e 18 = 2 x 32 3 3 1 10 Express the number below as product of power of its prime.

While that of division is simply done by subtraction.
The indices to be multiplied or divided must be of the base.
3.5 Logarithm Using logarithms of numbers, multiplication problems can be done (solved) by simple addition while division problem can be solved by simply subtraction.
It can also be used in the problem and roots of number.
Recall (i) Log = 101 (ii) Log 100 = 2 10 10 (iii) Log 1000 = 3 10 Comparing 100 = 102 and Log 100 = 2 it can be see that the index in the first equation which is 10 2 is the same as the logarithm of the second equation which is also 2.
It is clear that the logarithm of the number 100 to base 10 gives the power to which the number 10 must be raised to get 100.
Examples 10,000 = 104, Log 10,000 = 4 10 10,000 = 105, Log 10,0000 = 5 10 Note: The representation of Log 100 reads logarithm of 100 to base 10.
10 Looking for the logarithm of a positive number of base 10 is the power to which 10 must be raised to obtain that particular member.
That is Log P = R which mean 10 10R = P 16 Now express the numbers below in form of logarithm.
(i) 1000 = 103 which is Log 1000 = 3 10 (ii) 1 = 100 which is Log 1 = 0 10 (iii) 10 = 101 which is Log 10 = 1 10 (iv) M = 10n which is Log M = n 10 In most cases the base number is omitted.
When the base is not written it is assumed to be in base 10.
The numbers are not always in tens.
It can be any number.
The logarithm of a number are of two parts.
The whole number part and decimal parts.
The whole number part is called the characteristics and the decimal part is called the mantissa.
The relationship between indices and logarithm.
Express the equations below in index form.
(i) Log 1000 = 3 (ii) Log x = C 10 10 (iii) Log M = P 10 Self Assessment Test 1.
How many parts is the logarithm of a number made up of and what are the parts.
2.
Express in the form of logarithm (i) am = n (ii) Mx = P 3.
Express in index form (i) Log 1.4 = 0.1461 (ii) Log 5.02 = 0.7160 10 10 3.5.1 Calculation of Logarithm to Base 10 (1) Number Greater than 1 Any number of the form M x 10n is said to be in standard form.
So a number can be expressed in standard form.
Examples Express in standard form (i) 576.23 (ii) 0.05247 (iii) 0.000689 Solution (i) 575.23 = 5.763 x 102 (ii) 0.05237 = 5.237 x 10-2 (iii) 0.000689 = 6.89x 10-4 17  The logarithm of a number is made up of the characteristics and the materials.
In finding the logarithm of a number the calculator can be used.
In some calculator, the number is entered before pressing the log button.
In others you press the log button before you enter the number.
3.5.2 Using the Four Figure Table First look for the characteristic of the number and then the mantissa.
Characteristics The characteristics is always one less than the digits in a whole number (i.e the numbers before the decimal point where there is a decimal number).
Count these digits then subtract 1.
Examples (1) Find the characteristics of the numbers below (i) 5678 (ii) 678.902 (iii) 12 3 (iv) 93281.1 Solution (i) 5678 has 4 digits Therefore characteristic is 4 – 1 = 3 (ii) 678.902 has 3 digits before the decimal point Therefore characteristics is 3 – 1 = 2 (iii) 93281.1 has 5 digits before the pt Therefore characteristic is 5 – 1 = 4 Mantissa This is read from the four figure table (logarithm table).
Now get your logarithm table and let start.
We shall use the sample of the logarithm table below.
Consider Log 5678 18 Logarithms of Numbers Antilogarithms of Numbers 19 Using the table to look at the mantissa of 5678 it is read like this; 56 under 7 difference 8. that is look for the number 56 under the column x.
When you get to 56 move along the row of 56 and stop in column 7 of that row and the number corresponding to 56 index 7 is your answer, keep it.
This is 7536.
Then go the differences section (column) index column under column 8 we have 6 which must be added to 7536 to give the final mantissa i.e 7536 + 6 = 7542.
What is the character i.e of 5678?
4 digits, character i.e.
is 3.
Hence Log 5678 = 3.7542 Examples Find the logarithm of (1) 3875 (2) 14.32 (3) 432.1 Solutions (1) Character i.e = 3 Mantissa – Read off 38 under 7 Differences 5 from the log logarithm table you will get 5883 Log3875 = 3.5883 (2) Log14.32 = 1.498 (3) Log432.1 = 2.6356 Number less than 1 These characteristic are usually less than 1 (that is negative).
It is 1 greater than the number of zero immediately in front of the decimal point.
Write the number in standard form and the index will be the characteristic.
Examples (1) Write down the character of the following.
(i) 0.00234 (ii) 0.0456 (iii) 0.687.
Solutions (i) 0.00234 = 2.34 x 10-3; characteristics = 3 (ii) 0.0456 = 4.56 x 10-2 Characteristic = 2 (iii) 0.687 = 6.87 x 10-4 Characteristic = 1 20 (2) Find the logarithm of the following (i) 0.000678 (ii) 0.003256 Solutions (i) Log0.0001678 0.000678 = 6.78 x 10-4 Check 67 index 8 in this question no difference Log0.00678 = 4.8312 (ii) Log0.003256 0.003256 = 3.256 x 10-3 Log0.003256 - 3.5127 Self Assessment Test (1) Find the logarithm of the numbers below.
(a) 4568 (b) 0.00254 (c) 0.000765 (d) 0.01371 (2) 2268 (3) 1256 The Anti-Logarithm Table The table is used to get the original number whose logarithm is given.
To get the anti- logarithm, you will read off the Mantissa only from the anti-logarithm table.
That is helps us to find the decimal point in the number gotten from the anti-logarithm table.
That is done after adding 1 to the characteristic.
Your count should be from the left hand side of the answer.
Examples Find the anti-logarithm of the numbers below.
(1) 2.7658 (2) 0.3254 (3) 2.6541 Solution (1) In the anti-logarithm table look for .76 under 5 difference 8.
You will get 5832.
Add 1 to the characteristic i.e 2 + 1 = 3.
Count 3 decimal places from the left and place the point in the appropriate place.
583.2 (2) In the same way, check .32 under 5 differences 4.
It gives 2115, characteristic 0 + 1 =1.
Final answer 2.115.
21 (3) Check .65 under 4 differences 1.
Gives 4509; characteristic 2 + 1 = -2 + 1 +1.
That is move backward is 4 by 1 place and place the decimal point i.e 0.4509.
(which is the same as 4.509 x 10-2).

They are rational and irrational (non-rational) numbers.
1 Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as exact fractions or ratios; such as 2, 3 , 2 2 7 4 0.8, 64 which will give , , ,  8.
1 2 5 Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as ratios, such as '.
'  3.141592....., the decimal containing without recurring.
Other examples 31.752050..., 28 5.291502.... etc Irrational numbers of this types are referred to as surds.
Surds that have number under the square root sign as the same are called like surds, for 5 example 5, are like surds.
4 3.6.1 Basic Facts of Surds (1) Mn  M x n (2) M n  M  n 25 M M (3)  n M (4) M  n  M  n   (5) n M  n2 M These factors are useful when simplifying surds.
Simplification of Surds As much as possible, express the number under the square root sign as product of two factors, one such be a perfect square.
Then simplify the surd by taking the square root of the perfect square.
Examples (1) Simplify (a) 8, (b) a2b, (c) 128, (d) 75 Solution (a) 8 2x2x2 4x2, 8 4x2 4x 2  2x 2 2 2 (b) a2b  a2x b axax ba b   (c) 128  64x2 128  64 x 2 8x 28 2 (d) 2 752 25x 3 2 25x 32x5x 310 3 There can also be a reverse process of the last example.

Simplification of such surds must first be done before any addition or subtraction.

Then the whole numbers will be taken with whole numbers and surds will be taken with surds.

To rationalize the denominator means to make the denominator into a rational number, usually a whole number.
To do this, you have a multiply the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by a surd that makes the denominator rational which will not in any way affect the original numbers.

To rationalize this surd, we use the idea of the difference of two  2 squares.
For example, to rationalize M  n we multiply it by M  n to give M n, which is a rational number M  n and M  n are said to be conjugate of another.

We will also consider, the use of fractions in our daily life and human activities and how fractions can be changed to decimals and percentages and vice versa.
2.0 Objectives By the end of the unit, you will be able to: 1. describe a fraction 2. demonstrate a fractional part of a whole 3. find an equivalent fraction to a given fraction and determine whether the two given fractions are equivalent or not.
4. state what proper and improper fractions are.
5. represent a named fraction in symbol.
6. reduce a given proper fraction to its lowest term or lower an equivalent fraction to the least denomination.

8. change decimals to percentages and percentages to decimals.
3.0 Main Body 3.1 The Meaning of Fractions The above circle is divided into 4 equal parts.
One (1) of the parts is shaded.
The shaded portion can be represent in a fraction form.
This fraction tells how the shaded part is related to the whole.
1 The shaded part can be written as with one as numerator and four (4) the denominator.
4 36 Note: The number above the line is called the numerator, while the one below is called the denominator.
The numerator represents the shaded part of the whole and the denominator also represent the equal parts into which the whole has been divided.
In the same way, if a whole is divided into ten (10) equal parts and three (3) parts are 3 shaded, the faction representing this is written as .
The three is number while ten (10) is the 10 denominator.
Note: A common fraction can be seen as a short form of writing a division problem.
If you are 5 asked to share 5 mangos between 8 people which can be written as 58 or .
The fraction line 8 indicates division.
The numerator is called the dividend and the denominator is called the divisor.
Note: A fraction represents a whole (number) and not two numbers.
Take a look at the figure above again the shaded portion is one of the four equal parts.
It is one 1 3 quarters, it is .
The three unshaped parts called three quarter, is written as .
4 4 Naming and representation of fractions go on as illustrated above.
The table below extends the system.

Both can be written as 20 204 5 4 35 353 11 remainder 2 3 20 35 The fraction and are called improper fraction; because the numerators are not less than 4 3 their denominator i.e the denominators are less than the numerators.
2 35 2 Note: When we divide 35 by 3 it will give 11 i.e 11 3 3 3 2 The fraction 11 is called a mixed number.
This is because it has a whole number as well as a 3 fraction part.
All numbers that have a whole as well as a fraction are called mixed numbers e.g 5 1 1½ , 3 , 3 etc 6 8 3.4.1 Changing Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions Mixed number can be express as a single fraction.

4 3.6 Multiplication of Fractions We have learn how to carry out addition and subtraction on fractions.
In this section, we are going to learn about the multiplication of fractions.
This we will do in four ways: (1) multiplication of fraction (2) division of fraction (3) simultaneous multiplication and division of fractions and (4) word problems leading to multiplication or/and division of fractions Objective At the end of this section, you should be able to: i. multiply two or more fractions together and express the product in its lowest terms 61 ii.
divide a fraction by another fraction and express the results in lowest terms.
iii.
carry out multiplication and division simultaneously iv.
solve some word problems that involves multiplication or division over fraction.
If we have fractions of the form a c ac x  b d bd If can be seen that in multiplication of fraction we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.
The product numerators becomes the numerator of the answer and the product of the denominators becomes the denominator of the answer.
If the numerator and denominator have common factor(s), you reduce the answer to its lowest term.
Example (1) Evaluate the following 2 3 5 3 4 3 5 3 (a) x (b) x (c) x (d) x 5 7 9 4 7 8 6 15 Solutions 2 3 2 3 6 (a) x  x  5 7 5 7 35 5 3 5 3 15 (b) x  x  9 4 9 4 36 4 3 4 3 12 4 3 (c) x  x    7 8 7 8 56 4 14 5 3 5x3 15 15 1 (d) x     6 15 6x15 90 15 6 Even if mixed fractions are involved the procedure is the same.

That is units must be under units, the decimal points under the decimal points….
and so on.
For example, if you are ask to add 75.32 and 7.5.
The work must be set out as: 75.32 +5.5 64 After the work have be set out in the right order as above, addition and subtraction are done ine the same way as you do for whole numbers, but always remember to write down the decimal point when you come to it.
Examples 1.

But if the divisor contains a decimal fraction, make an equivalent division such that the divisor is a whole number.
To do that: (a) count how many places to the right the digits in the divisor must move to make it a whole number.
(b) move the digits of both numbers to the right by this number of places.
(c) divide as usual.

We have learnt how to expressed numbers in the power of prices.
There will be three sections.
Section 1 will deal with numbers in base ten, section 2 will be number in other bases and section 3 will be conversion from one base to another.
2.0 Objective At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (1) Write numbers in base ten (2) Write numbers in other bases (3) Convert number from one base to another 3.0 Main Body 3.1 Numbers in Base Ten (Denary) Some people traditionally count in 5s or use market days.
When counting week days we count in 7s.
When counting seconds or minutes will count in 60s.
In the present days it is general for people to count in 10s.
75  The digits that are used to represent the numbers are 0,1,2, 3,4,5,7,8,9.
The value of the digit is known by the place it occupied in the number.
For example 6825 is the same as 6000 + 800 + 20 + 5 6825 In standard form we have 6000 = 6 x 103 800 = 8 x 102 20 = 2 x 101 5 = 5 x 100 When, we put all together, we have : 6835 = 6 x 1000 + 8 x 100 + 2 x 10 + 5 = 6 x 103 + 8 x102 + 2 x 101 + 5 x 100 Note: Since it is based on the power of ten it is called the base ten system.
Examples (1) Write the expansion form of the following base ten numbers.

The binary system is one of the most importance system after the base ten system.
Its importance is because it is used all over the world by all counters for numerical calculations.
The binary system are made up of, only two number (digits), that is 1 and 0.
Computer contains a large number of switches.
There are two switches, one of the switch represent 1 which is `on’ and the other represent 0 which is `off’.

This gives 1 with no remainder.
Next digit, since 2 is greater than 1, 2 in 1 is 0 remainder 1 write down 0 under 1.
We now convert the 1 to 3 since the base of the divided is 3, and add it to the next digit to give 3 + 1 = 4.
How many 2 in 4.
There are two 2 remainder 0.
Write down the 2 under the next 1.
Next 2 divide 1 is 0 remainder 1, write down under 1.
We now convert the 1 to 3 since the base of the dividend is 3 and add it to the next digit which is 1 to give 3 + 1 = 4.
How many 2 in 4.
There are two 2 in 4 remainder 0.
Write down the 2 under the last 1.

When we give the distance and the time that cars, planes or trains use to cover distances, it is always written in approximate, when we talk of populations of a place or state it is always the estimated one.
The population of Benin is estimated to be 8.1 million.
In this unit, you will be taught various forms of approximations and how they are computed.
You will also learn how to deal with problems involving sharing commodities, contributions, and consumptions and making provisions in our world of inequalities.

(c) 186.75 = 187 to 3 sf.
(d) 186.75 = 186.8 to 4 sf.
Here, the rounding off is carried after the number of significant figures are indicated.
(3) Approximate 0.08567 to (a) 1 st. (b) 2 sf.
(c) 3 sf.
Solutions (a) 0.08567 = 0.09 to 1 st.
The zeros before the first real number is not a significant figure.
The rounding off is done after the first real number.
(b) 0.08567 = 0.086 2 sf.
(c) 0.08567 = 0.0857 3 sf.

3.
A farmer needs 10 men to clear his farm in 5 days.
How many men will he need, if he must finish clearing the farm in 3 days.
3.5 Proportion This is a relation between two variable in which one of the variable is as multiple of the other.
Example 1.
A man gets N1000 for 10 days of work.
Find the amount for (a) 5 days (b) 30 days (c) y days Solution For 10 days the man gets N1000 For 1 day the man will get N1000  10 = N100 92 (a) For 5 days the man will get 5 x N100 = N500 (b) For 30 days the man will get 30 x N100 = N 3000 (c) For y days the man will get y x N100 = N100y The above method is call the unitary method.
By unitary method, we first find the rate for one unit before answering the set question.
Examples Mr. Ojo bought 20 birds for N600.00 (a) How much will buy 13 birds?
(b) How much will buy 8 birds?
(c) How many birds can N4,620.00 buy?
Solution (a) 20 birds cost N6600.00 1 bird will cost N6600 20 = N330 6600 13 For 13 birds = N x 4290 (or N330 x 13) 20 1 6600 8 (b) For 8 birds = = N x 2640 (or N330 x 8) 20 1 (c) If N330 can buy 1 bird.
How man birds can N4,600.00 buy 4020   14 birds 30 3.5.1 Direct Proportion A direct proportion is a proportion in which one variable increases as a result of the other variables increase.
Example 3 The cost of 5 books is N480.00.
Find the cost of 8 books.
Here as the books increase in number, the money to buy it also increases.
5 books cost N480.00 93 480.00 1 book cost N 96.00 50 2 books will cost N96.00 x 2 3 books will cost N96.00 x 3 and so on  10 books will cost N96.00 x 10 = N9600.00 Such proportion are called direct proportion.
There are some proportion that are not direct.
Example 4 Six man can weed a plot in 18 days.
How many days will it take 9 men to weed the same plot?
6 men weed the plot for 18 days 1 man will weed the plot for 18 x 6 day 18x16  9 men will weed the plot for N  12 days 9 In the above example, the number of days decreases as the number of men increases.
Proportion of this natural is called inverse proportion.
3.5.2 Ratio This is a way of comparison, it allows us to compare the magnitude of two or more things that are related.
Both parts of a ratio may be multiplied or divided by the same number.
It is usual to express ratios as whole numbers in their lowest terms.
Notation a By way of notation, ratio can be written as (i) atob (ii) a:b (iii) b In (i) & (ii), the number corresponding to the first number of the ratio is usually written first while the number corresponding to the second number of the ratio comes next.
In (ii) ratio is expected as a fraction.
The first number of the ratio becomes the numerator while the second number of the ratio becomes the denominator.
Since ratio can be express as fraction it behaves like fraction.
But ratio are usually reduced to the lowest form.
Note that in ratio; (a) the quantities being compared must be in the same unit.
(b) Ratio has no unit 94 Expressing One Quantity as a Ratio of Another Quantity Examples (1) Express 60 kobo as a (a) ratio to N1.00 (b) ratio to N1.80 Solution (a) 60 kobo: N1.00 60 kobo: 100 kobo = 60:100 = 6:10 = 3; 5 (b) 60 kobo: N1.80 60 kobo: 100 kobo 60:180 6:18 1:3 (c) Express 10mm as a ratio of 7cm 3.
Express 3 days as a ratio of 3 weeks 4.
Express 15mins as a ratio of 1 hr Solutions = 10mm: 7cm Since 10mm 10mm:70mm = 1cm = 10:70 = 1:7 3.
3 days: 3 weeks Since 7 days 3 days: 21 days = 1 weeks 3:21 1:7 Sharing Quantities in a given Ratio The sharing of quantities is usually best done through the use of ratio, in our every day activities.
The Federal Government use ratio in the sharing of nation resources to states based on 95 their population.
In financial partnerships, profits are usually shared in the ratio of the amount contributed by the partners.
Sharing are done in our homes based on needs or age of the children.

3.0 Main Body 3.1 Expansion by Removing Brackets An algebraic expression may be of the form a(b+c).
In order to expand this expression, you remove brackets.
In removing the brackets, you must observe certain rules.
These includes: 1. if there is a positive (+) sign in front of the bracket, any sign connecting the terms inside the bracket must remain unchanged.
For example, a(b+c) = ab+ac.
2. if there is a negative (-) sign in front of the bracket, any sign connecting the terms inside the bracket must change.
For example, -a(b+c) = -ab-ac.
Examples Remove brackets from the following expressions.
(1) P(q2) (2) 5(Pb) (3) r(7s15) (4) 3t(2st) (5) 3(a2 2) (6) 6(a1)5(a3) Solutions 1.

(1) a(a1) (2) a(a1) (3) 3(a3)b 3.2 Factorisation by Taking Common Factors When factorizing an algebraic expression involving two or more terms, you look for the common factor among the terms and take it out.
A common factor is number of letter you can find in all the terms of the expression.
Taking out the common factor will imply introducing brackets.
The common factors(s) could be a letter, a number or both.
Consider the expression, rprsrt.
You can observe that r is common to the three terms in the expression.
If you take out this common factor r you will have: rp + rs + rt = r (p + s + t).
Consider another expression; 5r2 10rt15rs.
You will observe that 5 is a common factor and r is also a common factor.
If you take out this common factor (5r), you will have 5r2 10rt15rs5r(r2t3s).

For example, 4P + 40 = 10P + 12 is an equation.
The unknown in this equation is P. Since the highest power of P in the equation is 1, the equation is called a linear equation.
The above equation can only be true if p has a particular numerical value.
To solve an equation means to find the particular numerical value of the unknown, in this case (P).
Examples: Solve the following equations.
1.
4P + 42 = 10P + 12 2.
4s – 6 = 22 3.
11 = 9t – 16 4.
16 + 8p – 14 = 8 – p 5.
2t + 19 – 5t = t – 5 6.
3 – (3a – 7) = 43 7.
6(10r -2) = 8 (6r + 4) 8.
7(5p -4) – 10(3p – 2) = 0 9.
3(6 + 7y) + 2(1 – 5y) = 42 10.
3x – [3(1 + x) – 2x] = 3 Solutions 1.
4P + 42 = 10P + 12 Collect like terms by bringing the numbers together and the terms with P together.
Remember that when a term crosses an equality (=) sign, the sign of the term is changed.
42 – 12 = 10P – 4P simplifying, we have 30 = 6P Since 6 is a common factor of 30 and 6, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6. this gives: 30 6P  6 6 5 = P or P = 5 104 2.

16 + 8p – 14 = 8 – p Collect like terms 8p + p = 8 + 14 – 16 9p = 22 – 16 9p = 6 Divide both sides by 9 9p 6  9 9 2 p = 3 5.
2t + 19 – 5t = t – 5 Collect like terms 2t – 5t – t = -5 – 19 2t – 6t = -24 105  -4t = -24 Divide both sides by -4 4t 24  4 4 t = 6 6.
3 – (3a – 7) = 43 Remove brackets 3 – 3a + 7 = 43 Collect like terms -3a = 43 – 7 – 3 -3a + 43 - 10 -3a = 33 Divide both sides by -3 3a 33  3 3 a – -11 7.

7(5p – 4) – 10(3p-2) = 0 Remove brackets 35p – 28 – 30p + 20 = 0 Simplify 35p – 30p – 28 + 20 = 0 106  5p – 8 = 0 5p = 8 Divide both sides by 5 5p 8  5 5 8 3 p =  1 5 5 9.

Now, what is this certain number?
Make a representation for it.
Let the certain number be x. multiply x by 4.
This gives 4 x.
The question say 4 x is the same as adding 15 to x.
That is: 4x = x + 15 Collecting like terms gives: 4x – x = 15 Simplify 3x = 15.
Divide both sides by 3 3x 15  3 3 x = 5 2.

It will help you to understand the nature of these equations and the different methods of finding solutions to them.
In addition to the methods that will be discussed in this unit, we also employ the use of graphs in finding solution to quadratic and simultaneous equations.
This aspect (graphical solution) will be considered in unit 3.
You are encourage to study the unit carefully.
Make sure your understand one step before moving to the next.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit, you should be able to do the following: 1. factorise quadratic expressions 2. solve quadratic equations 3. solve simultaneous equations using elimination method 4. solve simultaneous equations using substitution method 3.0 Main body 3.1 Factorisation of Quadratic Expressions A quadratic expression is one in the form ax2 + bx + c where a, b, and c are constants and a is not equal to zero.
For example 2x2 – 5x + 3 is a quadratic expressions.
It is also possible to 117 have more than one unknown in a quadratic expression.
For example 3x2 + 5xy + 2y2 is a quadratic expression with two unknown x and y.
Note that the highest power of the unknown is always two.
There are three methods we can employ in factorizing a quadratic expression.
Method One: Difference of Two Squares Note: The difference of the square of two quantities is equal to the product of their sun and their difference.
Consider the expression (a + b)(a - b).
Removing brackets we have a2 – ab + ab – b2 Simplify, gives a2 – b2.
That is (a + b)(a – b) = a2 – b2 Therefore when factorizing a term of difference of two squares, first write each term as a square.
Consider the following.
1.
P2 – 4 P2 = (P)2 - 4 = -(2)2 P2 – 4 = P2 – 22 P2 – 4= (P + 2)(P-2) 2.
4a2 – 9 =(2a)2 – 32 = (2a + 3)(2a – 3) 3.
5P2 – 45q2 Neither 5 nor 45 is a perfect square.
But 5 is a factor of 45.
So divide both terms by 5.
Which give P2 – 9q2 Write each term as a square.
(P)2 – (3q)2 = (P + 3q)(P – 3q) 4.
16h2 - 25 = (4h)2 – (5)2 = (4h + 5)(4h – 5) Method Two: Factorization by inspection Suppose we want to factorise the expression a2 + 6a + 8.
118  Our goal is to write a2 + 6a + 8 in the form ( ) ( ) and fill the brackets.
We know that a will appear first in the brackets and a2 = a.a. Then, a2 + 6a + 8 = (a+…)(a+…).
The next step is to look for two numbers such that their product is + 8 and their sum is + 6. the number pairs which have their product as + 8 are: +8 and +1 -8 and -1 +4 and +2 -4 and -2.
In order to know the right pair to pick, check which of the pairs will have their sum to be +6.
(+8) and (+1) = +9 (-8) and (-1) = -9 (+4) and (+2) = +6 (-4) and (-2) = -6 Since +4 and +2 gives the correct sum, we conclude that a2 + 6a + 8 = (a + 4)(a + 2) Examples: Factorise the following expressions.
i. x2 – 10x + 16 look for two numbers whose products is + 16 and sum is – 10.
16 = -8x – 2 - 10 = x -8 and -2 x2 – 10x + 16 (x – 8)(x – 2) ii.
m2 – 11m + 28 look for two numbers whose product is +28 and sum is -11.
These are –7 and -4 m2 – 11m + 28 = (m – 7)(m – 4) Method Three: Factorisation by Grouping To factorise by grouping we must have a number of terms that we can put into groups.
For instance, if the quadratic expression has three terms you must find a way to make it four terms so that you can group in twos.
Consider the following examples.
1. x2 + 7x + 10 119  + 7x can have be express as 5x + 2x.
We have choosen + 5x and + 2x because the product of 5 and 2 is 10 and the sum of 5 and 2 is 7.
That is x2 + 7x + 10 = x2 + 5x + 2x + 10 = (x2 + 5x) + (2x + 10) = x(x + 5) + 2(x + 5) = (x + 5)(x + 2) 2. x2 – 10x + 21 -10x = -7x – 3x Note: that it is only -7 and -3 that have a product of + 21 and a sum of -10 x2 – 10x + 21 = x2 - 7x - 3x + 21 = (x2 - 7x) + (3x - 21) = x(x - 7) - 3(x - 7) = (x + 7)(x - 3) Alternatively Find the product of the 1st and last terms.
x2 x 21 = 21x2 Look for two numbers, such that their product is 21x2 and their sum is – 10x (the middle terms).
Factors of 21x2 sum of factors 21x and x 22x -21x and – x -22x -7x and – 3x -10x +7x and + 3x + 10x The right factors are - 7x and – 3x.
So we substitute these for – 10x in the expression.
x2 - 10x + 21 = x2 - 7x - 3x - 21 = (x2 - 7x) - (3x - 21) = x(x - 7) - 3(x - 7) = (x - 7)(x - 3) 3.
4x2 – 37xy + 9y2 -37xy can be express as - 36xy – xy This is because 4x2 x 9y2 = 36x2y2.
Two factors whose product is 36x2y2 and sum is -37xy (the middle term) are – 36xy and –xy.
120 =(4x2 – 36xy) – (xy – 9y2) =4x(x – 9y) – y(x – 9y) (x – 9y)(4x – y) Self Assessment Exercise 1 Factorise the following quadratic expressions (i) Using inspection method (ii) Using grouping method (a) t2 + 9t – 22 (b) 6p2 – 13p – 7 3.2 Quadratic Equations Consider the equation x2 – 3x + 2 = 0 The 1st step in solving this equation is to factorise the expression on the left hand side.
You can employ any of the methods of factorization discussed in section 3.1 that is most appropriate.
x2 – 3x + 2 = (x – 2)(x -1) that is (x – 2)(x – 1) = 0.
When the product of two terms is zero, is either of the terms is zero or both terms are zero.
So if (x – 2)(x -1) = 0. either x – 2 = 0 or x – 1 = 0 if x – 2 = 0, then x = 2 if x – 1 = 0 then x = 1  x = 2 or 1 These values (2 and 1) are called the roots of the quadratic equation.
This implies that solving a quadratic equation is the same as finding the roots of a quadratic equation.
Examples Solve the following quadratic equations.
(1) x2 – 7x + 10 = 0 (2) 2P2 – 5P – 3 = 0 (3) 16n2 + 8n + 1 = 0 (4) 4t2 – 49 = 0 (5) 6m2 = m + 1 Solutions 1 x2 – 7x + 10 = 0 121 This can be factorised by inspection (x -5)(x – 2) = 0 Either (x – 5) = 0 or x – 2 = 0 if x – 5 = 0 if x - 2 = 02 Then x = 5 then x = 2 That is x = 5 or 2 You can check whether your answer is correct by substituting the answers into the equation.
x2 – 7x + 10 = 0 When x = 5, x2 – 7x + 10 52 – 7 x 5 + 10 = 0 25 – 35 + 10 = 0 -10 + 10 = 0 When x = 2, x2 – 7x + 10 = 22 – 7 x 2 + 10 =4 – 14 + 10 = -10 + 10 = 0 2.
This shows that the answers x = 5 or 2 are correct 2p2 – 5p – 3 = 0 This can be factorised by grouping, 2P2 x -3 = -6p2 Two factors whose product is 6p2 and sum is – 5p are -6p and p. Substitute these for -5p in the equation.
That is 2p2 – 6p + p – 3 = 0 (2p2 – 6p) + ( p – 3) = 0 2p(p – 3) + (p – 3) = 0 (p – 3)(2p + 1) = 0 Either p – 3 = 0 or 2p + 1 = 0 If P – 3 = 0 then, P = 3 If 2P + 1 = 0, then, 2P = -1 1  P = - 2 122 3.
16n2 + 8n + 1 = 0 This can also be factorised by grouping.
16n2 x 1 = 16n2 Two factors whose product is 16n2 and sum equal to 8n are 4n and 4..
Substitute these for 8n.
That is 16n2 + 4n + 4n + 1 = 0 (16n2 + 4n) + (4n + 1) = 0 4n(4n + 1) + (4n + 1) = 0 (4n + 1)(4n + 1) = 0 Either 4n + 1 = 0 n =  1 twice 4 4.
4t2 – 49 = 0 Note that the left hand side is a difference of two squares.
So express each term as a square.
(2t)2 – (7)2 = 0 (2t + 7)(2t – 7) = 0 Either 2t + 7 = 0 or 2t – 7 = 0 7 t = + , 2 5.
6m2 = m + 1 Rearrange the equation to give a quadratic expression on the left hand side and zero on the right hand side.
That gives 6m2 – m – 1 = 0 This can be factorised by grouping 6m2 x – 1 = -6m2 two factors whose product is -6m2 and sum equals –m are -3m and 2m.
substituting these for –m in the equation gives 6m2 – 3m + 2m – 1 = 0 (6m2 – 3m) + (2m – 1) = 0 3m(2m -1) + (2m – 1) = 0 (2m – 1)(3m – 1) 123 Either 2m – 1 = 0 or 3m + 1 = 0 If 2m – 0 = 0 then 2m = 1 and m = 1 2 If 3m – 1 = 0 then 3m = 1 and m = 1 2 m = 1 or 1 2 3 Self Assessment Exercise 2 Solving the following equations 1. q2 + 7q + 12 = 0 2. n2 – 4n = 0 3.
25t2 = 9 3.3 Simultaneous Linear Equations Simultaneous Linear Equations are a pair of linear equations in two variables say x and y.
The pair of values of x and y are such that they satisfy the equations simultaneously (at the same time).
To solve a pair of simultaneous equations, you can use graphical method, elimination method or substitution method.
Elimination and substitution methods will be discussed in this unit, while graphical method will be treated in unit 3.
Elimination Method In this method of solving simultaneous linear equations, you eliminate one of the unknowns and solve for the other.
Then, the solved one is substituted into any of the equations to find the value of the unknown earlier eliminated.
Consider the following examples.
Examples Using the method of elimination solve the following simultaneous equations.
1. a + b = 7; a – b = 3 2.
5p – 3q = 8; 2p – 5q = 7 1 3.
15s + 2t = 7; 10s + = 3 2 Solutions a + b = 7; a – b = 3 1.
Write down the equations and label them.
a + b = 7 - - - - - - (i) 124  a – b = 3 - - - - - - (ii) Think of how to eliminate any of the unknowns, either a or b.
Since the coefficients of b in both equations are numerically the same, both having opposite signs, b will be eliminated if both equations are added.
Equation(i) + Equation (ii) gives; a + b + a – b = 7 + 3 a + a = 7 + 3 2a = 10 10 a = = 5 2 substitute 5 for a in equation I (you can also substitute for a in equation ii).
This is gives 5 + b = 7 b = 7 – 5 b = 2 That is a = 5 & b = 2 (2) 5p – 3q = 8; 2p – 5q = 7 Let 5p – 3q = 8 - - - - - (i) 2p – 5q = 7 - - - - - (ii) Find a way to equalize the coefficient of any of the unknowns in both equations.
Multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation ii by 5 and label them equation 3 and 4 respectively.

5p – 3(-1) = 8 5p + 3 = 8 5p = 8 – 3p = 5 5 P = 1 5 (3) The solution is q = -1 & p = 1 t 15s + 2t = 7; 10s + = 3.
Let 2 15s + 2t = 7 - - - - (i) t 10s + = 3 - - - - (ii) 2 Multiply (i) by 1 and (ii) by 4 (i) x1 = 15s + 2t = 7 - - - - (iii) (ii) x4 = 40s + 2t = 12 - - - (iv) Subtract (iii) from (iv) 40s + 2t – 15s – 2t = 12 – 7 40s – 15s = 12 – 7 25s = 5 5 s = 25 1 s = 5 Substitute 1 for S in (i) 5 1 15 x + 2t = 7 5 3 + 2t = 7 2t = 4 4 t = = 2 2 1 That is, S = and t = 2.
5 126 Substitution Method In this method of solving simultaneous linear equations, you write one of the unknown in terms of the other unknown and substitute this expression into the second equation.
Let us now solve the examples above using substitution method.
(1) a + b = 7 - - - - - - (i) a – b = 3 - - - - - - (ii) From equation (i) a = 7 – b Substitute 7 – b for a in equation 2.
7 – b – b = 3 7 – 2b = 3 -2b = 3- 7 -2b = -4 4 b = = 2 2 Substitute 2 for b in equation (i) a + 2 = 7 a = 7 -2 a = 5 That is a = 5 and b = 2 (2) 5p – 3q = 8 - - - - - (i) 2p – 5q = 7 - - - - - (ii) From equation (ii) 75q p = 2 Substitute for P in equation (i) 75q 5 - 3q = 8 - - - (iii)  2  Multiply equation (iii) by 2 to clear the fraction.

The equations can also be solved by adopting the methods discussed earlier in this unit.
All you need to do is to study the question carefully to find out whether elimination or substitution method will be most appropriate at any point in time.

These graphs are called algebraic graphs.
Solving equations graphically involves calculating a range of values of the unknown for which the equation is true or are true simultaneously.
These points are then plotted on a Cartesian plane.
Using a graph paper.
The vertical and horizontal lines drawn on the plane are called axes, y is used to label the vertical axis while x is used to label the horizontal axis.
This unit is designed to give an understanding of how to solve different types of equations using graphs.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit, you should be able to pilot: 1. graphs of linear equations 2. graphs of quadratic equations 3. graphs of simultaneous equation 136 3.0 Main Body 3.1 Graphs of Linear Equations Consider the equation, y – x = 3 This is a linear equation.
Note that the highest power of the unknown is one.
From that equation, we have: y = 3 – x.
Pick a range of values of x and calculate the corresponding value of y.
Suppose x = -1,0,1,2,3,4.
When x = (-1) y = 3 – (-1) y = 4 When x = 0 y = 3 – 0 = 3 When x = 1 Y = 3 – 1 = 2 When x = 2 y = 3 – 2 = 1 When x = 3 y = 3 -3 = 0 Representing this in a table gives x -1 0 1 2 3 y 4 3 2 1 0 The figure below is the graph of ( x + y = 3) The scale is 1cm to 1 unit.
If scale is not given, you can choose your own scale.
137  Note that the graph is a straight line graph.
Linear equations always give a straight line graph.
Consider another example.
Using a scale of 2cm to 1 unit on the x axis and 1cm to 1 unit on the y axis, plot the graph of y = 3x + 5 with values of x ranging from -2 to +2.
Solution y = 3x + 5.
When x = -2.y = 3(-2) + 5 = -6 + 5 = -1 When x = -1 y = 3(-1) + 5 = -3 + 5 =2 When x = 0 y = 3(0) + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5 When x = 1 138 y = 3(1) + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 When x = 2 y = 3(2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 x -2 -1 0 1 2 y -1 2 5 8 11 The scale of the vertical and horizontal axes can be the same and they can also differ.
Self Assessment Exercise 1 Plot the graphs (1) y = 2x + 5 for values of x ranging from 0 to 5 (2) 2x + y = 1 for values of x ranging from 8 to 8.
139 3.2 Graphs of Quadratic Equation Recall that in a quadratic equation, the highest power of the unknowns is two.
Graphical solution of quadratic equations follows the same procedure as graphical solution of linear equations.
A table of values of x and y is developed by calculating corresponding values of y for a range of values of x.
Consider the following examples.
(1) Plot the graph of the quadratic equation: y = 2x2 – 2.
That is, values of x from – 3 to 3 Solution y = 2x2 – 2 When x = -3 y = 2(-3)2 – 2 = 2(9) – 2 = 18 – 2 = 16 When x = -2 y = 2(-2)2 -2 = 2(4) -2 = 8 – 2 = 6 When x = 1 y = 2(-1)2 – 2 = 2(1) – 2 = 2 – 2 = 0 When x = 0 y = 2(0)2 – 2 = 2(0) – 2 = 0 – 2 = -2 When x = 1 y = 2(1)2 – 2 = 2(1) -2 = 2 – 2 = 0 When x = 2 y = 2(2)2 – 2 = 2(4) -2 = 8 – 2 = 6 When x = 3 y = 2(3)2 – 2 = 2(9) – 2 = 18 – 2 = 16 x -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 y 16 6 0 -2 0 6 16 140  Scale: 1cm to 2 units on y axis.

The process involved in changing the subject of a formula will be explicitly discussed.
You are therefore encouraged to read through the unit carefully and get acquainted with the facts.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 1. explain the meaning of subject of formulae 2. identify the subject of a formula 3. change the subject of a formula 4. substitute in formula to find the numerical value of a named variable 3.0 Main body 3.1 Subject of Formulae A formula is an equation which contains two or more variables.
The equation describes the relationship between the different variables.
For example, the equation V = U + at is a formula which represents the velocity of a moving object where V = Final Velocity U = Initial Velocity 154  a = acceleration t = time taken Also, the equation PTR I  100 is the formula for simple interest I = simple interest P = Principle T = Time R = Rate The first variable of the formula, that is, the variable which is expressed in terms of the other variables, is called the subject of the formula.
In the examples above, V and I are the subjects of the first and second formulae respectively.
In the same vain the formulae y = MC2 and 2x2 + 1 = y have y as subject in each case.
Self Assessment Exercise 1 Identify the subject in each of the following 1 2a11 1 1 1 1.
S Ut at2 (2) F = Ma (3) y (4)   2 2 S v u 3.2 Changing Subject of Formulae In a formula there are many variables.
the variable which is expected in terms of the others is called, the subject of the formula.
The subject of a formula can be changed by rearranging the formula to express another variable in term of others.
The procedure is like that of solving equation, solving for the variable to be made the subject of the formula as solution of the equation.
For example.
V = U + at Subtract at from both sides.
V – at = U or U = V – at The subject of the formula V = U + at has been changed from V to U a or t can also be made the subject of the formula.
Consider the following steps.
V = U + at 155 Subtract U from both sides.
V – U = U + at - U Simplifying, we have V – U = at Divide both sides by t V U at  t t This gives V U V U aora t t Again, V = U + at Subtract U from both sides.
It gives V – U = at Divide both sides by a.
This gives V U V U tort a a A question that is likely to be on your mind at this junction is how do I know the arithmetic operation to carry out?
How do I know when to add, subtract, divide or multiply?
The guiding rules are as follows.
The subject of a formula must stand alone on its side of the equation.
Therefore, operation that will result in removing all the other variables from that side of the formula is what must be carried out.
Consider the following examples.
(1) Make x the subject of each of the following x 1 (i) n = 4ax (ii) P (iii) y = 3x + 5 (iv) y x2a 2 3 Solution (i) n = 4ax Divide both sides by 4a 156 n 4ax  4a 4a n n xor x 4a 4a x (ii) P 2 Multiply both sides by 2 x P x 2  x2 2 2P = x or x = 2P (iii) y = 3x + 5 Subtract 5 from both sides y – 5 = 3x + 5 – 5 y – 5 = 3x Divide both sides by 3 y5 3x  3 3 y5 y5 x or x  3 3 1 (iv) y  x2a 3 Multiply both sides by 3 1 3 x y  x2a x3 3 3y = x2a Divide both sides by a 3y x2a  a a 3y  x2 a Take the square roof of both sides 3y  x2 a 157 3y 3y xor x a a qb  2.

Make M the subject of the formula.
2 3.3 Substitution in Formula It is important for you to be able to find the numerical value of a variable in a formula when the values of the other variables are given.
The process is called substitution.
It involves replacing the variables with the values given, then simplifying to get the numerical value of the variable whose value was not given.
Consider the following examples.
(1) Given that S = 5t + 3t2.
Find S when t = 2, 4 and 6.
Solution S = 5t + 3t2 When t = 2 S = 5(2) + 3(2)2 S = 10 + 3(4) S = 10 + 12 S = 22 When t = 4 S = 5(4) + 3(4)2 S = 20 + 3(16) S = 20 + 48 S = 68 When t = 6 S = 5(6) + 3(6)2 S = 30 + 3(36) S = 20 + 108 S = 138 (2) Given that V = 9x + 5.

The form of linear inequalities is similar to that of linear equations except that instead of the symbol = (equality) in linear equations, some other symbols are used in linear inequalities.
These symbols and their meanings includes the following: > is greater than < is less than > is greater than or equal to < is less than or equal to  is not equal to Consider a class in a school having x number of students.
If x is equal to 50, then, it can be expressed as x = 50.
This is an equation.
But if there are less than 50 students in the class, then, x < 50.
This is an inequality.

They are of various types.
It can be identify by the size of the lines and their angles.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Identify by name the various typed of triangles 2.
Identify the general properties of triangles and specific properties of each type.
3.
Solve problems on any basic type of triangles.
4.
Know some of the theorems of triangles.
3.0 Main Body 3.1 Triangles Definition: A triangle is a plane shape, bounded by three straight lines.
169 Types (1) Scalene triangle (2) Isosceles triangle (3) Equilateral triangle (4) An acute-angled triangle (5) A right-angled triangle (6) An isosceles right angled triangle (1) Scale Triangle: This is a triangle in which no sides are equal and angles are also equal.
C A B Scalene Triangle (2) Isosceles Triangle: This is a triangle in which two of the three sides are equal.
The two angles facing the equal sides (i.e.
angels at the base) are also equal.
R /PQ/=/QR/ & < RPQ = <PQR P Q PQ is called the base of isosceles triangle RPQ (3) Equilateral Triangle: In this type of triangle all three side are equal and the three angels are also equal (i.e 600).
/AB/=/BC/=/CA/ <ABC = <BCA = <CAB = 600 A B C 170 4.
An acute-angled Triangle: In this triangle the three angles are acute angles (all three are angles less than 900).
X 600 720 520 Y Z 5.
A right-angle Triangle: This is a triangle in which one of the angles is a right-angle (i.e 900).
<UVW = 900 U V W Right-angled triangle 6.
An Isosceles Right-angled Triangle: This is a triangle in which the two sides that contain the right-angle are equal.
Since the two sides are equal, the two angle are also equal.
A C B Isosceles Right-angle triangle 171 3.2 Properties of Triangle Theorem 1: The exteriors angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of two interior opposite angle.
Given: ABC Prove: that <ABC + <BAC = <ACD A B C Construction: Through point C draw a line parallel to line AB (or AB) produce line BC to point D. A a F a 1 c b b B 1 D C Proof: From the above diagram a = a (alternative angles AB//CF) 1 b = b (corresponding angles AB//CF) 1  a + b = a + b 1 1 <ACD = <ABC + <BAC Theorem 2 The sum of the angles of a triangle is two right angles i.e.
1800 Proof.
Using the above diagram and from the proof above.
We have shown that  a + b = a + b + c. Let us add angle c to both side 1 1 We have a + b + c = a + b + c. 1 1 But a + b + c are adjacent angles on a straight line.
(Angles on straight is 1800) 1 1  a + b + c 1800 1 1  a + b = c = 1800 Hence the sum of angles of ABC = 2 right angles.
172 Examples In the diagram below find < x given /AB/=/AC/, BC//DE & <ADE = 680 A x B C D E Solution Given /AB = /AC/ BC/DE and < ADE = 680 <ADE = < ABC = 680 (corresponding angles since BC//DE) Since /AB/ = /AC/, which means <ABC = <ACB = 680 (base angles of an isosceles triangle) <ABC + x = 1800 (adjacent angles on a straight line) x = 1800 - < ACB x = 1800 – 680 = 1120 3.3 Conditions for Congruency Two triangles are congruent if they are equal in all respect in terms of sides, angles and area.
(1) Two triangles are congruent if each of their corresponding sides are equal.
(i.e if the three are sides equal an abbreviation for reference is SSS).
A Z Y C B X /AB/=/XZ/,/BC/=/YZ/ and /AC/=/YX/ 173 So ABC = XYZ (SSS).
(2) There is said to be congruent in two triangles, if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two side and the included angle of the other (abbreviation for reference is SAS).
P V W   U Q R /PQ/=/UV/, /QR/=/VW/ <PQR=<UVW and PQR=UVW(SAS) 3.
Two triangles are said to be congruent if two angels and one side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding angles and one side of the other triangle (abbreviation for reference is ASA) A Q P x q y x O B C /BC/=/PQ/, <ABC = <OPQ and <BCA = <PQO  <ABC = OPQ (AAS) 4.
Two triangles are said to be congruent if the two triangles are right-angled such that, the hypotenuse and one side of the triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and corresponding side of the other triangle (abbreviation for reference is RHS).
X A C Y Z B 174  /XY/=/AB/, /XZ/=/AC/, and <XYZ = <ABC = 900  XYZ = ABC (RHS) 3.4 Similar Triangles (i) Definition Two triangles are said to be equiangular to each other, if the angles of one triangle, taken in other, are respectively equal to the angles of the other in the same order.
1.
Two triangle are said to be similar if they are equiangular to one another.
A P B C Q R <A = <P, <B = <Q, <C = <R ABC and PQR are similar.
2.
If two triangles are equiangular then their corresponding sides are proportional.
3.
If two triangles are equiangular then they are similar and hence their corresponding sides are proportional (from the above diagram).
Hence ABC, & PQR are similar implies that AB BC AC AB PQ   or  PQ QR PR BC QR Examples P 1 X Z Q R Y 175 From the above diagram X, Y, Z are points on the sides of PQR such that /QX/ = /RY/ & /RZ/ = /QY/, If /PQ/=/PR/, prove that (i) /XY/ = /YZ/ (ii) Angle XYZ = Angle XQY or <XYZ = <XQY Solution Proof: From the figure above.
In s XQY and YRZ /XQ/=/YR/ (given) <XQY = <YR Z (base of isosceles) XQY = YRZ (SAS) (i) Hence /XY/ = /Y Z) (ii) <XQY = 1800 – (<QXY+ <XYQ) (Sum of angles in a ) and <XYZ = 1800 – (<XYQ+ <ZYR) (Sum of angles on a straight line) Since <QYX = <ZYR = <XYZ is common  <XYZ = <XQY A A 2.
V 9cm X y y 6cm 6cm 7cm 7cm B B C C Find the value of V in the above diagram Solution Consider AXY and ABC, <AXY = <ABC (corr.
agnles XY//BC) <AYX = <ACB (Corr.

In the figure below /AD/ = 4cm, /DE/ = 6cm and /AC/ = 8cm find /BC/ A 600 D 8cm 4cm 6cm 600 B C E Solution In ABC and EDB <BAC = <BED (given 600) <CBA = <EBD (same angle) <EDB = <ABE (sum of angles of a ) EDB is similar to ABC /EB/ /BD/ /DE/    / AB/ /BC/ /CA/ Substituting the given value /EB/ 4 6    AB/ /BC/ 8 4 6 /BC/ 8   or  /BC/ 8 4 6 4x8 32 1 3 /BC/  5 5 cm 6 6 6 3 177 3.5 The Mid-Point and Intercept Theorem 1.
The Mid-Point Theorem The line joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangles is parallel to the third side and equal to half of it.
A M N B C /BC / If M, N are the mid-points of AB and AC respectively.
Than (i) /MN/ // 2 /MN/ /BC/ (ii) MN/BC 3.6 Pythagoras’ Theorem It says that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides in a right-angled triangle.
[The hypotenuse in the use side facing the right-angle (900)].
A hypotenuse (h) Opposite (O) B adject (a) C (Hypotenuse)2 = (opposite)2 + (adject)2 (AC)2 = (AB)2 + (BC)2 i.e h2 = O2 + a2 Applications of the Pythagoras Theorem The Pythagoras, rule can help to solve many problem such as calculating lengths when two sides of a right angled triangle are known.
178 Examples (1) Find the length of AC in the figure below A 6cm B C 8cm By Pythagoras rule AC2 = AB2 + BC2 AC2 = 62 + 8 = 36 + 64 = 100 AC  100  10cm (2) Find the value of x is the figure below.
