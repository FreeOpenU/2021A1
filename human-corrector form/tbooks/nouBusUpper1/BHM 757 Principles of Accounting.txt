This is common and traditionally presented in double entry.
However, this is not always the case especially in small business units that employ incompetent book-keepers to man the recording of the business activities.
What is common to such is keeping the records by entering the transactions once only-single entry.
As a result, some items of transaction may be missing .This therefore brings about incomplete records.
AFTER STUDYING THIS UNIT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO • Explain the term incomplete record: • Explain the different methods of collecting data for preparation of Final account from incomplete records • Prepare final account of enterprises from incomplete records.
3.1 INCOMPLETE RECORDS The implication of an incomplete record therefore is lack of proper record-keeping, profits is rarely shown, total sales figure and even total purchases figure may be missing.
The profit can, thus be calculated if the opening capital and the closing capital are known.
As peculiar to small scale business, profit realised is usually ploughed back which will in turn increase the capital base.
For instance, if the opening capital is N5,000 and the closing capital reads N 6, 250 (assuming that there is no drawing).
The profit generated for the period in question will be calculated as thus: N Closing Capital 6250 Less Opening Capital 5000 Now, lets assume that there is a drawing of =N350.
The net profit will be calculated as: N N 9  Closing Capital 6250 Add Drawings 350 6600 Less Opening Capital 5000 Net profit 1660 Illustration 1: The book-keeper of Garba Mini Market had the following details as at 31st December.
1990 and 31st December , 1991 .

If it is prepared on the basis of double entry, then it will be called a balance sheet.

To get the net profit therefore, the following formula is adopted.
Opening capital + profit -drawing = closing capital By making the profit a subject of formular, it gives this Profit = Closing Capital + Drawing -Opening Capital = N12,270 + 500- 10,500 = N 270.
Generally speaking, this method of ascertaining profit is adopted if and only if there is inadequate information to prepare the trading, profit and loss accounts where this is available the method of calculating profit may be unsatisfactory for it will be more preferable to locate the profit through the preparation of profit and loss account.
To do this therefore, requires that all the missing figures relating to the profit or loss should be found.
This is usually done by drawing up the account for such missing items.
For instance, in case where the sales figure and purchases figure are missing, the two can be located by drawing up the total debtors and total creditors control arecscpoeucntti v ely.
Once all related items have been considered, the balancing figure in the creditors control a/c will request the credit purchases.
If there are cash sales, the cash sales figure will be in the sales a/c to arrive at the total sales made during the period.
The same things are applicable to the purchase a/c when there are cash purchases.
The amount of individual expenses will bpere p are as well, where necessary.
Exercise Taiwo Owolabi started business on I April, 1983 with the sum of N 8000 which he paid into bank A/C.
In the first three months of the trading year ended 30 June, 1983.
The following transactions took place.
i) The sum of N 10000 was borrowed from the Rosy Lam Society on a long term mortgage.
The money was paid into the bank immediately.
ii) Free hold premises costing NI6000 were bought by cheque.
iii) Purchase of stock-in-trade were made on credit totalling N6960 iv) Credit sales were N7,100 v) Payment by cheque were as follows: N Furniture & Fittings 900 Rate & Insurance 284 Alteration to premises 92 Salaries 290 Private expense 600 Trade credits 4400 6566 iv) Receipts from trade debtors paid into the bank week -N6240 11  Required: (a) Calculate the amount of Taiwo Owolabi's (1) Capital expenditures (2) Revenue expenditures For the quarter ended 30 June, 1983 (b) (1) The gross profit (2) The cost of goods sold for the quarter ended 30 June, 1983.

5.0 SUMMARY Financial record keeping by an inexperience book-keeper i.e.
single entry book keeping is known as an incomplete record.
In this type of record profit is rarely shown, total sales figure and even total purchases may be missing.

UNIT 2 ADJUSTMENT BEFORE PREPARING FINAL ACCOUNTS I 12  Table of Content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Prepayment 3.2 Accruals 3.2.1 Accrued Income 3.2.2 Income received in advance 3.3 Bad Debt 3.3.1 Bad Debt recovered 3.4 Discount 3.4.1 Discount allowed 3.4.2 Discount receivable 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further Reading 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION In preparing the final accounts i.e.
trading profit and loss Accounts and balance sheet that shows a meaningful operational and financial position of a business of an organization, some adjustment have to be made.
The adjustments may be in respect of prepayment, accruals, bad debts, discount and depreciation.
In this unit, you will learn about all this adjustments.
Because of the importance oadf ju stthmeesne ts , the study of how to make this adjustment before preparing the final accounts is very important.
13  This is the second unit of this course and it covers a period of one hour.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Explain what prepayment, accruals, bad debt and discount and be able to make adjustments for them.
• Distinguish accruals from prepayment.
• Identify discount payable and receivable.
• Explain accruals income.
3.1 Prepayment The term prepayment is used to denote any expenses which has been paid for in advance.
That is the expenses have been paid but the benefit of the payments are usually made for expenses like insurance, rents and rates, wages and salaries etc.
If on the other hand, a payment made now is for the benefit enjoyed in the prior period such a payment is regarded as payment in arrears.
3.2 Accruals Any expenses that is due for payment but which remains unpaid is called an accrual or accrued expenses.
It is thus a liability which needs to be settled within one year (i.e.
current liability).
The fact that an expense is due but it has not been paid does not means that it should not be charged against the profit of the year in which it is due.
If this is not done, it implies that the matching concept has not been exercised and so the profit would be overstated in the light of this, the accrued has to be added to the expenses paid to determine the amount of the expense to be transferred to the profit and loss account for the year .
3.2.1 Accrued Income An accrued income is that which is due for collection but which has not be received.
For example, if a building is let out on monthly basis and after the last day of the month the rent due is not yet received, the rent receivable will be classified as accrued rent income.
However, an accrued income is an asset which should have a debt entry.
In short, when there is an accrued accounting entry is to debit the accrued income account and credit the income account.
3.2.2 Income Receive Advance Just as organization or individuals pays in advance, so they at times, receive in advance.
The income received in advance may be termed prepaid income.
It is thus a liability because benefit enjoyed is one for which the service for the income received has not been provided.
The prepaid income is therefore a liability.
To enter any prepaid income that occurs in the book of account debit the income account and credit the prepaid income account.
14  3.3 Bad Debt A debt is regarded as being bad if the debtor for one reason or the other can no longer settles his debt.
In other words, if the debtor is declared insolvent or bankrupt and so, the debt becomes irrecoverable, then such a debt is refer to as a bad debt.
Specifically, bad debts may occur in the situations of death, bankruptcy and sometimes incapacitation.
An outstanding debt may either be partly or entirely bad.
It is partly bad when part of it is recovered and the balance is not.
It is entirely bad when the whole of the debt is irrecoverable.
Whenever a debt is declared bad, there is a need to close the debtors account by writing off the debt.
3.3.1 Bad Debt Recovered Sometimes a debt which had been written off may become recoverable some years later.
When the debt is now settle, it is called a bad debt recovered.
When such situation arises, the best way of recording the bad debt recovered is by debiting cash account and crediting the bad debt recovered account then the value of the bad debt recovered would be transferred to the credit side of the profit and loss account as revenue thus closing the bad debt recovered account.
3.4 Discount This is an inducement offered by a creditor to debtors to pay promptly (cash discount).
• A deduction from the selling price of an article generally allowed by a wholesaler to a retailer, that is, trade discount.
• With reference to bill of exchange, to discount a bill means to acquire it by purchase for a sum less than its face value, the amount of this discount depending partly on the length of the unexpired term of the bill and partly on the amount of risk involved.
• When a recently issued stock falls below its issued price, it is said to stand at a discount.
3.4.1 Discount Allowed Discount allowed is an incentive given to encourage the debtors to settle their account or debts promptly.
On the other hand, the provision for discounts allowed is the amount set aside from the profit to cater for the discounts allowed in case the need to give such discounts arises.
However, the major reason behind the creation of the provision for discounts allowed is similar to that behind creating provision for bad debts.
No wonder the accounting treatments of the two are closely similar.
3.4.2 Discount Receivable Discount received is a rebate from a supplier when he is paid within a stipulated period.
If it is envisaged that discount will be received from a supplier as a result of the credit purchase made now, then a provision would be for discounts receivable (i.e.
discounts on creditors).
However, such a provision is regarded as an asset because a certain amount of money is estimated to be received in future.
Thus, unlike the other provision earlier discussed, the provision is then credited in the profit and loss account for the year in which it is made because it increases the profit.
Exercise: (a) Distinguish between Discount allowed and Discount Receivable.
(b) What is Bad debt?
(c) Distinguish between Accruals and prepayment.
15  (d) What is an Accrual Income?
4.0 CONCLUSION In this second unit of the course you have learned about the importance of adjustments in preparing trading profit and loss account and the balance sheet without which a true and fair position of an organization financial position can not be know.
You have also learned about the concept of accruals and prepayment.
Discount allowed and discount receivable and bad debt which must all be adjusted for before preparing the final accounts.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have dealt with the adjustment necessary before the preparation of final accounts which the future and fair position of the organization can not be ascertain.
We have also learned about the concepts of accruals, prepayment, discount payable and receivable.

Having understood all these adjustments and the reasons why the adjustments were made, there is the need for you to know how to treat these adjustments in the book of account.
In this unit, you will learn how these adjustments are treated in the book of account.
That is when to debit and credit an account and why the accounts are credited or debited in respect opfr e payment, accruals and bad debts.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: • Explain Prepayment, Accruals and Bad Debts.
• Record in the above in the Journal proper and the Ledger.
3.1 PREPAYMENTS The term prepayment is used to denote any expense which has been paid for in advance.
That is, the expenses have been paid but the benefit of the payment has not been enjoyed.
Prepayments are usually made for expense like insurance, rent and rates, wages and salaries, such a payment as a payment in arrears.
When prepayment is made for an expense: Debit prepaid Expenses A/C with the amount of prepayment Credit Expenses A/C When the actual expense due for a period is transferred to the profit and loss account: Debit Profit & Loss A/C with the balance transferred Credit Expenses A/C 17  The above method of treating prepayment is regarded as separate accounts methods because there are separate accounts for both the expenses and prepaid expense (asset).
There is however, a mixed account method where the accounting treatment is made for an expense and pexreppeanisde on a single account.
3.2 ACCRUALS The fact that an expense is due for payment but it has not been paid does not mean that it should be charged against the profit of the year in which it is due.
If this is not done, it implies that the matching concept has not been exercised and so.
the profit would be overstated.
In the light of this, the accruals have to be added to expense paid to determine the amount of the expense to be transfer to the profit and loss account for the year.
Summarily, the accounting treatment for accruals is: When expense is paid for: Debit the expenses A/C with the amount paid Credit the Cash bank A/C When accruals arises: Debit the expense A/C with the amount of the accrued Credit accrued expenses A/C When the actual balance of the expense due for the year is transferred to the profit and loss account: Debit Profit & Loss A/C with the amount transferred Credit Expense A/C 3.3 BAD DEBT Whenever a debt is declared bad, there is a need to close the debtor's account by writing off the debt.
This is done by debiting the bad debt account and crediting the debtor's account.
At the end of the period, the bad debt total would be transferred tothe debt side of the profit and loss account as a loss incurred during the year in which the bad debt occurs.
Illustration I : On January I, 1992, the debt balance of the account of Kun le in the book of Yemisi was N3990.
Kunle left the country and it was decided that his account be written off as bad debt at the end of the year .
Write up the necessary accounts in the book of Yemisi, using the above information Solution : Kunle AIC 1992 N 1992 N Jan I Balance b/f 3900 Dec 3 Bad debt 3900 ===== ===== Bad Debt AlC 1992 N 1992 N Dec 31 Kunle 3900 Dec 31 P& L A/C 3900 18  ===== ===== Profit & Loss AlC (Extract) 1992 Bad Debts 3900.
Bad Debts Recovered Of course the method illustrated in unit 1 for dealing with the above is good but the better way of recording the event is by first re-instating the bad debt recovered in the concerned dacecbotourn'st.
This is necessary in order to have the detailed history of the debtor's a account as a guide for granting further credits in future.
The summary of the steps involved in recording a bad debts recovered especially when it occurs some years after the occurrence of the bad debt, is shown below.
Debit Debtors A/C Credit Bad Debts Recovered A/C (to re-instate the debt recovered in the debtors A/C) Debit Cash A/C Credit Debtor's A/C (when cash is received from the debtor) Debit Bad Debt Recovered A/C Credit Profit & Loss A/C (to close the balance of the P & L A/C at the end of the year) This therefore indicate that necessary accounts involved when bad debts are recovered aDreeb: t or's A/C, Bad Debt's A/C, cash A/c, Bad Debts Recovered A/C and the P & LSo mAe/tCim.
e , sales A/C may be prepared especially when the sales transaction takes place in the year under consideration.
However, the recoverability of a bad debt may be in the year within which the debt is written off.
This calls for different accounting treatments.
Illustration 2: When a bad debt is recovered some years later, Adeniyi started a new period on January 1, 1980 with a debit balance of N5820 on the account of Tokunbo.
On February 8, Tokunbo paid N3500 he made before he was declared insolvent.
His account was therefore written at the end of the year .
On June 15, 1981, Tokunbo restores properly his business and paid the balance which was formerly written off his account.
Enter the transactions above in the above years 1980 and 1981.
Solution: In the book ofAdeniyi: Tokunbo A/C 1980 N 1980 N Jan I Balance b/f 5820 Dec 3 Bad debt 3500 Dec 31 Bad Debts 2320 5820 5820 ==== ===== 1981 1981 N 1981 N 19  June Bad debts recovered 2320 June 15 Cash 2320 ==== ==== Cash AlC 1980 N Feb 8 Tokunbo 3500 1981 June 15 Tokunbo 2320 Bad Debt AlC 1980 N 1980 N Dec 31 Tokunbo 2320 Dec 31 P & L A/C 2320 ===== ===== Bad Debts Recovered AlC 1981 N 1981 N Dec 3 I P & L A/C 2320 June 15 Tokunbo 2320 ===== ===== Profit & Loss AlC 1981 N 1981 N 1980 Bad Debts 2320 1981 Bad debts recovered 2320 Illustration 3: When bad debt is recovered during the year, it is written off.
The book of K. Balogun showed a balance of N 1270 on the account of Taiwo on January 1,1990.
The account was entirely written off as bad debt on August 20.
On 25th December, Taiwo settle his account by issuing cheque.
Enter the above in the necessary ledger accounts of K. Balogun at the end of the year.
1990.
Solution: Taiwo A/C 1990 N 1990 N Jan 1 Balance b/f 1,270 Aug 20 Bad debt 1270 ===== ==== Dec 25 Bal debts 1270 Dec 25 Bank 1270 ==== ===== Bad Debt A/C 1990 N 1990 N Aug 20 Taiwo 1270 Dec 25 Taiwo 1270 ===== ===== 20  Profit & Loss A/C 1990 N 1990 N Dec 25 Taiwo 1270 Explanatory Note: Bad debts recovered account is not opened because the bad debts account had not been closed to the profit and loss account by the time the bad debt was recovered.
Similarly, bad debts account was not closed to profit and loss account because the debt was not recovered on December 25th while the profit & loss account is to be drawn on 31st December.
The treatment is merely to reverse the entries made in the bad debts account and the debtors account.

4.0 Conclusions Prepayments, Accruals and Bad debts are an integral part of account which must be understood before advancing in account, without which understanding the principle of account will be very difficult.
5.0 Summary Prepayments are payments made now for the benefit to be enjoyed tomorrow such payments are regarded as payments in arrears, while Accruals are expenses that are due for payment now but which remains unpaid, these are called accruals or accrued expenses.
Bad debts is regarded as being bad if the debtor for one reason or the other refused to settle his debts.
22  In account, prepayment is deducted from the payment concerned in the profit and loss account and added to the current assets in the balance sheet, accrual is an expenses in P & L account which is added to the expenses concerned and shown in the balance sheet as a current liability.
Bad debt is treated in the same way as accrual in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet.

In this unit you will learn about Discount, Discount allowed and Discount Receivable and their accounting treatment.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit you should be able to: • explain what is meant by discount, discount allowed and discount receivable and their provision.
• Record discount allowed and discount received in the book of account.
3.1 DISCOUNT This is an inducement offered by a creditor to a debtor to pay promptly or buy in Large quantity.
That is the debtor being encouraged to buy more because of the reduced price.
3.1.1 DISCOUNT ALLOWED This is the discount given to our customer i.e.
our debtors for buying more (buying in quantity) or pay in on time (paying promptly).
This is an expenses in the profit and loss account.
3.1.2 DISCOUNT RECEIVABLE This is the discount given to us by our supplier for paying them on time or buying in larger quantity.
This is an income in the profit and loss account and it is thus debt to the P & L account.
3.2 PROVISION FOR DISCOUNTS ALLOWED Discount allowed is an incentive given to encourage the debtors to settle their debts promptly.
On the other hand, the provision for discounts allowed is the amount set aside from the profit to cater for the discount allowed in case the need to give such discount arises.
However, the major reason behind the creation of the provision for bad debts.
No wonder, the accounting treatments of the two are closely similar.
As it is done with the provision for bad debts, two methods can be used to treat the provision for discounts allowed on debtors.
24  Note that the value of the discount allowed is calculated on the total debtor's loss bad debt that occurred and the discount allowed in a particular period.
, Illustration 1 : On January I, 1984, the provision for discount allowed account had a balance of N 500.
During the year, the total discount allowed amounted to N 390.
On 31st December, the balance on the debtors account stood at N15,000 and on the date, a provision for discount allowed was decided to be created at 2%.

3.3 PROVISION FOR THE DISCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Discounts received is a rebate received from a supplier when he is paid within a stipulated period..
If it is envisaged that discount will be received from a supplier as a result of the credit purchase made now, then a provision would be made for discount receivable (i.e.
discounts on creditors).
However, such a provision is regarded as an asset because a certain amount of money is estimated to be received in future.
Thus, unlike the other provisions earlier discussed, the provision for discount receivable accounts has a debit balance.
This same provision is then credited in the profit and loss account for the year in which it is made because it increases the profit.
Illustration 2: On January I, 1993, Bajepade has the balance of N240 on his provision for discounts receivable account.
During the year, the amount of the discounts actually received was N5000.
At the end of the year, the creditors was valued at N20,000.
It was decided that the provision for the discounts receivable be maintained at 2% on sundry creditors.
Required: Write up all necessary ledger accounts at the end of the year using the above information.

4.0 CONCLUSION Provision for discount allowed is the benefits allowed to debtors which is a loss to the business and it is debited to profit and loss account while provision for discounts received is an income i.e.
deducted from total debt to be paid by the business.
It credited to profit and loss account.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have successfully explained what discount, discount receivable, discount allowed and their provision meet to a business; and their accounting treatment.
Discount received on creditors is an income to the profit & Loss account while discount allowable on debtors is an expense to the firm and are thus debited to the profit and loss account.

UNIT 5 MANUFACTURING ACCOUNTS I 27  Table of Content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objective 3.1 Manufacturing Accounts 3.2 Summary of the Analysis 3.3 Illustration 1 3.4 Illustration 2 3.5 Storing manufacturing goods at market value 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further Reading 7.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION The significance of the final accounts of a business can not be overlooked in that the main purpose of a business is to make profit and so the operational results and their functional position of business is best disclosed via the final accounts.
However, the final accounts which have been treated so far i.e.
in your 1st semester (introduction to accounting) are those of a trading company which only buys and resells goods.
There are some other businesses whose activity ims a n utofa c ture and then sell the goods so produced.
The final accounts of such a manufacturing company have an inclusion of manufacturing account.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: • Distinguish between manufacturing account and the trading account.
• Understand the terms used In manufacturing account, trading account and the balance sheet for a manufacturing concern.
• Prepare manufacturing Account, trading Account and balance Sheet for a manufacturing concern.
3.1 MANUFACTURING ACCOUNT The manufacturing account simply put is the account employed to show the lost of gmoaondusf a ctured.
The account gives the analysis of the costs in terms of the prime cost, factory overhead expenses and total manufacturing or production cost.
Components of the prime cost are: direct materials, direct wages and discount expenses.
• Direct materials cost is the cost of raw materials that can be traced directly to the goods manufactured.
To compute the cost of raw materials consumed, in the production process; the following items need to be considered (a) opening stock of raw materials (b) purchase of raw materials ( c ) carriage inward of raw materials (d) returns outward of raw materials (if any) (e) materials rejected or used in another production time (if any) 28  o cost of raw materials consumed is calculated this: o a + b + c + d – e – f The calculation follows the procedure involved in calculating the cost of goods sold in the trading accounting of trading business.
* Direct wages is the cost of labour which can be directly identified with the production.
The wages paid to a machine operative is a direct wage for this is traceable to tmhean u fgaocotudrse s .
This is unlike the remuneration of a factory supervisor or factory cleaner which are indirect expenses.
.
* Direct expenses are those identifiable with particular units of production.
(a) Cost of hiring a special plant or machine for production of a special order.
(b) Cost of chemical materials differing from direct raw materials.
(c) Royalties paid e.g.
those paid to investor(s) for use of a patent in respect of goods produced.
The summation of the direct cost of materials wages and expenses (prime costs) does not give the total manufacturing cost.
This is because there are some other costs incurred in the factory which can not be directly traced to the goods produced.
These are termed the factory overhead expenses.
The factory overhead expenses include remuneration of factory supervisor and factory manager, works power, factory rent and rate, lighting, depreciation of machinery installed in the factory, works interval transport, repairs to works.
materials store keeping, cleaners wages and other indirect expenses relating to the factory.
More often than not, at the end of a particular period, there will be a stock of partly completed goods.
This is what is termed work-in-progress.
The opening stock of .
work-in-progress less than closing stock of work-in-progress gives the change in work-in-progress.
The addition of the prime cost, factory overhead expenses and the change in work-in-progress gives the total manufacturing cost.
3.2 SUMMARY OF THE ANALYSIS o Prime cost = Direct materials + Direct labour expenses o Production or manufacturing cost = Prime cost + factory overhead expenses + work-in- progress However, all these costs analysis are debited to the manufacturing account.
When the total cost is ascertained, the manufacturing account is closed by transferring the cost to the trading account by debiting the trading account and crediting the manufacturing account with the production cost.
Then, the trading, profit and loss account and the balance sheet of the company can be prepared in the usual form.
Meanwhile.
The operating expenses in the profit and loss account mneacye s sbaeri l y classified under: o Administrative expenses including administrative and secretarial workers salaries, legal and accountancy charges, depreciation of office fixed assets, office rent and so on.
o Selling and distribution expenses, consisting of all expenses incurred in the course of selling the goods.
o Financial expenses comprising bank charges.
interest on loan, discounting charges etc.

3.5 STORING MANUFACTURING GOODS AT MARKET VALUE Obviously, a company decide to be buying and selling goods instead of manufacturing and selling.
But the main aim of profit maximization as encouraged some investors to engage in production activities.
The idea is that if a company decides to produce certain items the production cost of such items may be less than the purchase price if the company is to buy them from Outside suppliers.
In order that the manufacturing account could show the profit realized in the course of production ~the manufactured of finished goods are usually transferred to store at the cost plus a mark up representing the profit realized by producing the items.
This will have no effect on the net profit realized if on the other hand, the goods are transferred purely at cost.
The only effect of this system of recording is that the gross will be split into two, one in respect of the mark up, the other in respect of the trading.
Exercises: I) What is prime cost?
2) Explain the difference between direct and indirect cost.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about manufacturing account, the important terms in manufacturing account like direct materials, principles, work-in-progress and how to calculate them.
You have also learnt about the preparation of manufacturing account.
trading, profit and loss accounts and the balance sheet.
You also learnt about storing manufacturing goods at the market price.
34  5.0 SUMMARY.
Prime Cost = Direct materials + Direct Labour + Direct Expenses Production or Manufacturing Cost = Prime Cost + Factory overhead expense + work- in-progress However, all these costs analyzed are debited to the manufacturing account when the total cost is ascertained, the manufacturing is closed by transferring the cost to the trading account by debiting the trading account and crediting the manufacturing accounting production cost.
Then the trading, profit and loss account and the balance sheet of the company can be prepared in the usual form.

In this unit you will learn further about manufacturing account and related important points.
In case of trading concerns, you can find out the cost of goods and the gross profit by preparing trading account.
But a manufacturing concern has to first prepare another account cmaallneudf a cturing account with the help of which it works out the cost of goods produced.
The cost of goods produced is then transferred to the Trading Account for ascertaining the cost of goods sold and the gross profit.
A manufacturing concern purchases raw materials from the market and converts them into finished goods for sale.
The cost of goods produced thus includes two major cost; (i) cost of raw materials consumed and (ii) Cost of conversion.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: * Prepare manufacturing account and calculate cost of goods produced.
3.1 COST OF RAW MATERIALS CONSUMED: This represents the cost of raw material used in course of manufacturing which can be worked out by adjusting the opening and closing of raw materials.
For example, a firm purchased raw materials worth N 650,000 during 1997 and its stock of raw materials on January 1, 1987 opening stock was N70,000 and on December 31, 1987, the cost-of- raw materials consumed during 1987 will be worked out as follows:- Opening stock of raw materials 70,000 Add: Purchase of Raw materials 650,000 720,000 Less Closing stock of raw materials 90,000 Cost of raw materials consumed 630,000 36  The direct expenses incurred on the purchases of raw materials such as freight, import duty, dock, dues, cartage, import duty, also be included in the cost of raw materials consumed.
But the usual practice is to show them separately on the debit side of the Manufacturing Account.
3.2 COST OF CONVERSION This includes all expenses incurred in the factory such as wages paid to labour.
Salaries osuf p ervisory staff, factory rent and rates, motive power, repairs to plant and mdeapcrheicnieartiyo,n on plant and machinery etc.
All these expenses are debited to the Manufacturing Account.
Look at the figure I for the T. Format of a Manufacturing Account.

Cutting of cloth in readymade garments factory and metal cutting in engineering factories are some examples of scrap.
Any amount realised from the sale of scrap must be adjusted in the cost of gporooddusc e d. Hence, it is credited to the Manufacturing Account.
3.3.2 WORK-IN-PROGRESS : It is quite likely that at the end of the year, there may be certain goods which are still in the process of manufacture.
Such goods are called 'semi-finished goods' or 'work.
in-progress'.
There will always be some work.in-progress at the beginning as well as at the end of the accounting year.
Their cost must be adjusted while working out the cost of goods produced.
Hence, the opening work-in-progress is shown on debit side of the manufacturing account while the closing work-in- progress is shown on its credit side.
3.3.3 STOCK OF FINISHED GOODS Besides the stock of raw materials and semi-finished goods every firm will have the stock of finished goods.
This is to be adjusted in the cost ofgoods produced, Hence, it is not shown in the manufacturing account.
As you learnt earlier, it will be shown in the trading account.
Exercise: I.
Distinguish between: (a) Cost of goods sold and cost of goods processed (b) Direct expenses and indirect expenses (c ) Trading account and manufacturing account 2.
Find out the cost of goods sold from the following figures extracted from the books of Allied Ltd. for the year 1987.
N Stock ( I: I: 1987) 50000 Purchases 1000000 Sales 1,500,000 38  Purchases Returned 50,000 Stock (31:1:1987) 70,000 Direct Expenses 60,000 Indirect Expenses 100,000 Answer: N 990,000 4.0 CONCLUSION : You have learnt that a manufacturing concern has to prepare manufacturing account bperefoparer in g the trading and profit and loss account.
Though considered desirable but many firms do not do so because it is not compulsory.
You will also generally be asked to prepare only the trading account without preparing such manufacturing account.
In such a situation you will show all items of manufacturing account in the trading account itself.
In other words, cost of rmawat e rials consumed, expense on purchases of raw materials, all manufacturing expense.
tohpee n ing and closing work- in-progress, sale of scrap, etc will also be shown in the common practice i.e.
the items like depreciation and repairs to plant and machinery and factory building will be shown in the profit and loss account and not in the trading account.
5.0 SUMMARY The manufacturing concern may also prepare a manufacturing account for ascertaining the cost of goods produced which is then transferred to the trading account for ascertaining the cost of goods sold and the gross profit, this however is not compulsory.
Most manufacturing concern prepare trading account directly by showing all expenses incurred in the factory (including cost of raw materials consumed), in the trading account itself.

The accounting records are equally important for welfare organization, which may not be doing any business such as clubs, societies, eindsutcitauttiioonnasl, h ospitals etc.
they are basically charitable organization which function without any profit motives.
They are usually termed as non-trading concerns.
Such organizations also have to keep proper records of their receipt and payment and match their expense with incomes.
This is a legal.
2.0 OBJECTIVE 40  After studying this unit, you should be able to: * explain the accounting records maintained by non-trading concerns * prepare receipts and payment account 3.1 ACCOUNTING RECORDS OF NON-TRADING ORGANIZATIONS The non-trading organizations like clubs, societies etc.
differs from the trading organization in several respects.
They normally do not indulge in buying and selling of goods and accepting or receiving bills of exchange.
The major sources of their income usually are subscriptions from members; donations etc and most of their transaction are cash transactions.
Hence, they need not maintain as many books of account as the trading organizations do.
The main objective of keeping records in such organization is to meet the statutory requirement and exercise control over the utilization of funds.
Hence, they usually maintain a cash book to record all receipts and payments (or separate cash receipt journal and cash payment journal to provide the necessary details) and other books like members register, minute book stock register, etc.
You are fully conversant with cashbook.
Let us have a brief idea about the other books.
* Members Register: Most charitable institutions are organised as society which are registered with the registrar of societies.
They are requires to keep full record of their subscribers (called members) Hence, they maintain a members register which show their names, addresses, date of admission.
* Minutes' books: The societies function of the basis of decisions taken by the general body of members and their managing committee.
They have to keep the proceedings of the meeting of general body and that of the managing committee.
Minutes book ipse r m aa n ent record of the decisions taken from time to time.
* Stock Register: Every society possesses fixed assets like furniture office equipment etc they have to keep complete record of these items in-a register called 'stock register' which shows date of purchase, quantity purchased, and the amount at which purchased etc.
Similarly, they also keep a stock register for consumable items like stationery, sport materials etc which in addition to the details of purchases will also show tchoenisru mption and balances.
The non-trading organization also maintain ledger containing the account of all incomes expense, assets and liabilities.
This facilitates the preparation of final accounts at the end of the accounting year.
3.2 FINAL ACCOUNTS You know the final accounts usually consist of a profit and loss account and a balance sheet.
In case of non-trading organizations however, this include: (i) Receipts and Payments Account (ii) Income & Expenditure Account, and (iii) balance Sheet.
You will notice that non-trading organization has to prepare a receipts and payments account in addition to the income & expenditure account (it is similar to profit and loss account) and the balance sheet.
You know that the profit & loss account and the balance sheet are usually prepared with the help of trial balance.
But in case of non-trading organization the practice is to prepare the income and expenditure account and the balance sheet straight from the receipts and payments account is very important for the non-trading concern and should be prepared very carefully.
It does not mean however that the non-trading organization should not prepare the trial balance at all.
In fact, if the organization has followed double entry system they must prepare a trial balance for checking the arithmetic accuracy of postings into ledger accounts.
This would also help preparation of receipts and payments account.
3.3 RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS ACCOUNT While preparing the final accounts from incomplete records (in your previous studies) you had some idea of the receipts and payments account.
So you know that it is simply a summary of cash bank transactions for the year.
It gives full information about all receipts and payments under 41  different heads and prepared with the help of the cash book.
The cash book contains a record of all receipts and payments in a chronological order but the receipts and payments account will simply show the total amount received or paid under each head.
For example, a club receives subscribers from it members on different dates in a year.
These are recorded in the cash book separately on those dates.
But in receipts and payments account, the total amount of subscriptions received during the year will appear as one item on its debit side.
Similarly, salaries paid to the staff will appear in cash book every month whereas the receipts and payments will simply show the total amount salaries paid during the year on its credit side.
You will recall that the opening balance in receipts and payments account represents the cash and bank balances at the beginning of the year whereas the difference between the totals of the two sides reflects the closing cash and bank balances.
Look at illustration I and see how receipts & payments account is prepared for a club.
Illustration 1 : From the following information of lion club for the year ended Dec. 31 1987, prepare a receipt & payments account DR CR Particulars Amount Particulars Amount N N Balances on 1/187 Lighting & Heating 4600 Cash in hand 600 Secretary's Honorarium 3700 Cash at bank 6400 General Expense 20,150 20150 Subscriptions Life membership 1986 -2400 Subscriptions 3000 1987 -36700 Furniture purchase 3000 1988- 300 39400 Wages 34,000 Restaurant and Bar Balances on payment 100000 31/12/87 Restaurant & Bar sales 120000 Cash in hand 500 Interest on investment 1050 Cash at bank 4500 Solution: Receipts and Payments Accounts for the year ending December 31, 1987 DR CR 42  Receipts Amount Payments Amount N N To balance b/d By Restaurant and Cash In hand 600 Bar 100000 Cash at bank 6400 7000 By Wages 3400 To Annual Subscriptions 1986 - 2400 By Lighting & Heating 4600 1987- 36700 By Secretary's Honorarium 3700 1988- 300 39400 By General 20150 To Restaurant & Bar 12,000 Expenses sales Interest on investment 1,050 Furniture purchase) 3000 To life membership balance c/d subscriptions 3000 Cash in hand 500 Cash at bank 4500 5000 N170,450 N170,450 Main Features: (i) It is a real account (ii) It is a summary of cash book.
All receipts are shown on the debit side and all payments on the credit side (iii) No distinction is made whether the payment has been made in cash or by cheque.
In other words, cash and bank items are merged except in case of opening and closing balances.
(iv) It includes all receipts and payments whether they are of revenue or capital nature.
(v) It shows total receipt and total payment under each head irrespective of the year to which it relates.
For example in illustration I subscriptions related to 1986 as well as 1988 have been included because the amount were actually received during 1987.
(vi) The closing balance represents the cash and bank balances at the end of the year.
Exercise: State whether the following statements are True or false.
43  (a) The non-trading concerns mainly refer to welfare organizations which function without profit.
(b) The major sources of income for non-trading concerns are subscription donation etc.
(c) The main objective of keeping accounts for a non-trading concern is to find out its profit or loss.
4.0 CONCLUSION The non-trading concerns like solicitors, clubs, educational institution, hospitals etc also maintain a proper record of their financial transactions.
It is not only a legal requirement for all registered bodies.
But it is also considered desirable for effective control of funds.
5.0 SUMMARY The accounting records of the non-trading concerns are based on the same Principles as those applicable to trading concerns.
However, the nature of their incomes and expenses is slightly different and most of their transactions are cash transaction.
Hence, their main book of original entry is cash book.
They also maintain ledger which shows all the concerned accounts.

In this unit, you will learn about the income and expenditure account, the difference between receipts and payments account and income and expenditure account and the balance sheet of a non-trading organization.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: * explain and prepare the income and expenditure account of a non-trading concern.
* Explain the difference between receipt and payment account and the income and expenditure account.
* Explain the balance sheet of a non-trading organization.
3.1 INCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNTS The income and expenditure account serves the same purpose for non trading organization as the profit and loss account for a trading organization.
It is also prepared exactly in the same manner as the profit and loss account i.e.
all income are shown on the credit side and all expense and losses on the debit side.
However, in case of non-trading concerns, the excess of income over expenses losses is not termed as profit.
It is called Excess of Income over Expenditure or Surplus, in case of cooperative society, similarly the excesses of expense and losses over income is termed as Excess of Expenditure over Income or Deficiency.
45  As stated earlier, the income and expenditure account is prepared with the help of receipts and payments account and the additional information available.
You know the income and expenditure account will show incomes and expenses only for the period to which it relates and that too on accrual basis.
Hence, while taking figures from receipts and payments account, you will have to make the necessary adjustments.
For example, if the amount of subscriptions received during 1987 includes N200 relating to 1986.
It should be deducted for purposes of computing the income from subscriptions.
Similarly, if certain amount of subscriptions relating to 1987 is still to be received (outstanding), it would not appear in the receipts and payments account.
But, it has included in the income from subscriptions for 1989 and so added thereto.
Another precaution you have to take relates to the distinction between capital and revenue items.
In the income and eaxccpoeunndti,t uyroeu are to include only the revenue items, the capital items will be ignore.
Then, you will also have to provide the necessary amount of depreciation on all fixed assets and make provisions for doubtful debts.
The items do not appear in the receipts and payments account.
Let us now list the steps to be followed for preparing the income and expenditure account from the receipts and payments account.
o Go through the receipts side for ascertaining all items of income and the payment side for all items of expenses and losses.
o Ignore opening and closing balances o Ignore capital receipts and capital payments o Ignore receipts and payment relating to the preceding and the following years.
If however a receipt or payment includes any amount which relates to the preceding or the following year, the same should be deducted.
o Add the outstanding amounts to the respective items of income and expense.
o Provide for depreciation and doubtful debts if required.
• If any fixed asset has been sold during the year, complete the amount of profit or loss on such a sale and show the same in the income and expenditure account.
Note that the sale of old sports materials is not to be regarded as sale of a fixed asset.
The total amount received from such sale is an income.
Let us prepare the income and expenditure account from the receipts and payments account given in illustration 1.
Income & Expenditure Account for the year ending December 31, 1987 DR .
CR Expenditure Amount Income Amount N N To Restaurant & Bar By Subscriptions 36900 expense 100000 By Restaurant & To wages 34000 Bar sales 120000 To lighting and By Interest on heating 4600 investment 1050 To secretary's Honorarium 3700 By excess of To general expenses 20150 Expenditure over 4700 income N162,450 N162,450 ====== ====== You will observe that, in addition to opening and closing balances, the following items of receipts and payment have been ignored.
46  * Annual subscriptions for 1986 * Annual subscription for 1988 * Life membership subscriptions (it is regarded as capital receipt) * Purchase of furniture 3.2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS ACCOUNT AND INCOME AND EXPENDITURE- While preparing the receipts and payments account and the Income and expenditure account, you must have noticed that they differ in many ways.
The various points of difference csuanm m baer iz ed as follows: Receipts and Payment A/C Income and Expenditure A/C * It is the summary of the cash book It is like a profit and loss account.
* It is a real account and records cash It is a nominal account and records cash transactions only as well as non-cash transaction.
It is prepared on accrual basis.
* Includes opening cash and Does not include the opening cash bank balances and bank balance.
* Also includes capital receipts and Includes only the revenue items.
capital payments * Shows receipts on the debit side and Shows income on the credit side and payments on the credit side expense the debit side.
* Includes items relating to preceding Concerns only with the amounts related or succeeding year to the current year .
* Ignores the outstanding expenses Includes all income and expenditure and income which are due but not received or paid.
* Does not include depreciation Includes depreciation * Closing balance represent cash in Closing balance represents surplus or hand and cash at bank (or overdraft) deficiency of Income over expenditure.
3.3 BALANCE SHEET The balance sheet of a non-trading organization is prepared in the same manner as that of the other organizations.
It shows all assets and liabilities as at the end of the year in the usual way.
However, the excess of assets over liabilities in their case is termed as Capital Fund or General Fund and not capital as in case of the trading concerns.
The capital fund actually comprise the excess of income over expenditure and other incomes like life- membership fees, entrance fees, 47  etc which have been capitalized from time to time.
Effectively it constitutes the capital of the institution.
Sometimes you may also have to prepare the balance sheet as at the beginning.
This is required mainly to ascertain the opening balance of capital fund.
.
Exercise: List the steps you will follow in preparing the income and Expenditure Account from the Receipts and Payments Account.
4.0 CONCLUSION The non-trading concerns like societies club, educational institutions, hospitals etc also maintain a proper record of their financial transactions.
It is not only a legal requirement for all registered bodies.
But it is also considered desirable for effective control of funds.
The accounting records of the non-trading records are based on the same principles as those applicable to trading concerns.
However, the nature of their income and expenses is slightly different and most otrfa n s athcetiior n s are cash transaction.
Hence, their main book of original entry is cash book.
They also maintain ledger which shows all the concerned accounts.
5.0 SUMMARY The final accounts of non-trading organization consists of (i) receipts and payments accounts (ii) Income and expenditure accounts (iii) balance sheet.
The receipts and payments account is simply a summary of all cash transactions relating to the accounting year which begins with the opening cash and bank balances and ends with their closing balances.
The income and eaxccpoeunndtistu reo n the other hand like profit & loss account, is prepared for ascertaining the surplus (excess of income over expenditure) or deficiency (excess of expenditure over income).
The Balance Sheet is prepared in the usual manner which shows the assets and liabilities of the organization including the capital fund.

You have learnt that the final accounts of non-trading concerns are prepared almost in the same manner as those of other.
Of course, the nature of their incomes and expenditure is sdliifgfhertelyn t from those of the trading concerns.
There are those of the trading concerns, there are a number of items which are peculiar to non-trading concerns and their treatment in final accounts need to be clarified.
In this unit you will hear about two of those peculiar items i.e subscriptions and donations.
2.0 OBJECTIVE (After studying this unit, you should be able to: * explain and record subscription in the final accounts.
* explain donation and record it in the final account.
3.1 SUBSCRIPTIONS In case of trading concerns the subscriptions refer to the annual charges paid for journals or for the membership of some organization and so are treated as an expenditure.
But in case of non- trading concerns, subscriptions paid by their members are a source of income.
They are first shown as a receipt in receipts and payment account and then as an income in the income and expenditure account.
The receipts and payment accounts however shows the amount osuf b scriptions actually received during the current year.
But the income and expenditure account include only that amount of subscriptions which relate to the current year, whether received or not.
Let us clarify this point with the help of an example.
A club received N10000 as subscriptions during 1988 of this, N200 relate to 1987 and N 1000 to 1989 (received in advance).
Then the subscriptions amount to N 4000 re1ating to 1988 were still outstanding.
In this case, the receipts and payments account will show a receipt of N IOOOO for subscriptions.
But the Income and Expenditure account will show N 11000 as income from subscription worked out as follows.
N Subscriptions Received 10000 Less Subscriptions relating to 1989 (Outstanding at the beginning) 2000 8000 Less Subscriptions relating to1989 (Received in advance ) 1000 7000 Add Subscriptions relating to 1988 50  Not yet received (Outstanding at the end) 4000 Income from Subscription from 1988 11000 Thus you find that a number of adjustment have to be made to the amount of subscriptions received in order to work out the amount of income from subscriptions for the current year which is to be shown in the income and expenditure account.
ILLUSTRATION 1: From the following, extract receipt & payments account and some additional icnofmorpmuateti tohne, i ncome from subscriptions from the year ended December 31, 1988 and show how _subscription will be recorded in the final account.

received in advance outstanding on as on 31/12/88 2000 31/12/88 for 1987 700 for 1988 4000 4700 Note: 52  i) Subscriptions received for the year 1988 are given separately in the receipts and payments account.
The amount does not include any subscription received for pervious year or next year so no adjustments need be made in respect thereof.
ii) Subscription outstanding as at 31/12/88 amounts to N4,700.
It includes N700 for subscriptions still outstanding for 1987. hence, the subscription outstanding for 1988 are taken as N4,700 3.4 DONATIONS The charitable institutions often receive voluntary contributions from various sources.
They are termed as donations and are a source of income for the institutions.
All donations are recorded on the receipt side of the receipt & payment account.
But whether they will be shown as income and expenditure account or not depends upon whether the aremcoeiuvnetd for a specific purpose or is in the nature of general donations.
If it is received for a specific purpose like construction of a building or giving prizes to sportsmen, it will not be shown in the income & expenditure account.
It is taken to the Balance Sheet and shown on the liabilities side as an addition to the building fund or prizes fund, as the case may be.
If however, it is a general donation of recurring nature and the amount received is small, it may be recorded as income in the income & expenditure account.
But if the amount received is large and is of non- recurring nature, it may be capitalized and added directly to the capital fun (general fund) on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.
The size and nature of the Institution will help you to decide whether the amount of general donation is small or big.
In most of the cases the treatment may be clearly indicated in the question.
Exercise: Select the most appropriate alternative.
(a) Subscription received in advance are shown on the: (i) Credit side of the income and expenditure account (ii) Assets side of the balance sheet (iv) Liabilities side of the balance sheet (b) Subscription due but not yet received are shown on the: (i) On the liabilities side of the balance sheet (ii) On the asset side of the balance sheet (iii) On the credit side of the balance sheet - 4.0 CONCLUSION There are a number of items which are peculiar to a non-trading organization these peculiar items are equally important to these organizations as they are paramount to preparing their annual final account.
5.0 SUMMARY Certain items (peculiar items) need special care while preparing the final account of non-trading organization, these items includes subscriptions and donations which are dealt with in this unit.
The remaining peculiar items shall be dealt with in the following units.

These are some of the peculiar items in accounts of non-trading organization.
Note this unit must be read in conjunction with unit 20.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: * explain the peculiar items in the account of non-trading organization and deal with the accounts proper.
54  3.1 ENTRANCE FEES It is a common practice in clubs and societies to change entrance fee (admission fees) from the new members at the time of their admission, It is usually treated as income and shown as such In the Income and expenditure account But some clubs charge exorbitant amount as entrance fee to limit admission of new members.
In such a situation, It is argued that the entrance fees is in the nature of premium charged from new members towards the capital cost incurred oesnt a b ltihseh m ent of the club by old members and therefore it should be capitalized.
However, this argument is not applicable to educational institution in the absence of any specific instruction in the question the entrance fees should be treated as a routine income and shown on the credit side of the income and expenditure account.
In case it is to be capitalized, it should be added straight to the capital fund as shown in the balance sheet.
3.2 LIFE MEMBERSHIP FEES Certain institutions also provide for life members and charge fees from persons who opt for it.
The amount of subscription received from them is termed as life membership fees and it is treated as capital receipt.
In other words, the life membership fee is not shown in the ienxcpoemndei t u raen adc c ount It is directly added to the capital, fund as shown in the balance sheet.
3.3 LEGACIES Legacy denotes the amount (or property) received as per the will of the deceased donor.
This type of donation is not a recurring phenomenon.
It happens once in a while and the amount received is generally large.
Hence, the practice is to capitalize it and show straight in the balance sheet.
However, the small amounts of legacies received from time to time may be shown in the income and expenditure account.
3.4 SPECIAL FUNDS.
The institutions often create special fund for special purposes such as .Prize Fund, ’Sport Fund’, etc.
any income received on account of special fund investments should be added to the fund concerned.
Similarly any expense incurred on such specific purpose should also be deducted from the special fund.
These transactions are not shown in the income & expenditure account Fexoar m ple a club may maintain a special fund for meeting expenses on sports activities.
In such a situation, the interest income on sports fund investments should be added to the sports fund and all expense on sport should be deducted there-from.
The same thing is applicable to endowments created for specific purpose.
But endowment may also represent a general fund.
In that case, the income from endowment funds is treated as normal incomes and credited to the Ienxcpoemndei t u&re a ccount 3.5 SALES OLD NEWSPAPERS The sale of old newspapers is of a recurring nature and is credited to the Income & expenditure account.
3.6 SPORT MATERIALS USED In case of sports clubs, the expenditure on sports materials is a common item.
But you know the materials purchased in accounting year may not be fully consumed.
Some materials may still be in stock.
Hence, to ascertain the exact amount of expenditure chargeable to the income aenxdp e nditure account of the year, you have to work out the amount of materials consumed by adjusting the opening and closing stock of such materials in their purchases.
For example, sport club has an opening stock of sport materials amounting to N2000 on January 1, 1988.
It purchased 55  sports materials for N 8000 during the year and had a stock material worth N 3000 on December 31, 1988.
This means the club consumed sport materials amounting to N 7000 during the year worked out as follows: N Sport materials consumed during 1988 Opening stock 2000 Add purchase 8000 10000 Less closing stocks 3000 7000 The amount charged to the income and expenditure account for 1988 on account of smpaotretrsi a ls will be N7,000.
It is also possible that the club receives certain amount by selling the used sports materials like bats and balls.
This will be an income of the club and should be credited to the income & expenditure account.
You must remember that such income is not taken into account while working out the amount of spots materials consumed because such income arises out of the consumed materials themselves.
Similar treatment may be adopted for ascertaining the amount of stationery and printing materials consumed by such organizations or tinned provisions consumed in the restaurant.
3.7 HONORARIUM The Institutions often take the help of outsiders (who are not employees of the institutions) for some work of the organization.
For example, inviting academicians or professional for special lectures or some artists to give performances.
The amount paid to them for such services is termed as honorarium, which is shown as an expense in income and expenditure account.
Trehmeu neration paid to the secretary or treasurer may be termed as honorarium because they are not the employees of the organization.
Exercise: From the following information, compute the amount to be debited to the income and expenditure account in respect of printing and stationery.
N Opening stock 30000 Purchase of printing & stationery 50000 Closing stocks 20000 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about a number of items which are peculiar to non- trading concerns and their treatment in final account, this items includes: entrance fees, life membership fleegeas,c i es, sales of old newspapers, sport materials used and honorarium.
You should keep what you learn about these items in your memory for further studies.
5.0 SUMMARY The non-trading organization may prepare a trail balance, but the receipts & payments account constitute the major source for the preparation of income & expenditure and balance sheet.
Certain items like subscriptions, entrance fees, donations, legacies, special funds etc need special care while preparing the final accounts of such organization.

Hence, N 560 of the Income from Investments (7% on N 16000 for 6 months) has been added to building fund and the balance (N40) has been credited to income and expenditure account.
3.
The total amount of income from investments (N 7OO) is outstanding and has been shown on the asset side.

Sometime you may be asked to prepare tshtaiste m ent from the trial balance of trading organization itself as is the case .
Infact there is nothing peculiar about it.
You already know how to prepare the profit and loss account and the balance sheet from given trial balance.
Follow the same procedure for the preparation of tihneco me & expenditure account and balance sheet.

It commences with the opening cash and bank balances, shows all receipts and payments made during the year, and ends with the closing cash and bank balances while recording the receipts and payments in this account, no distinction is made between capital and revenue items as both are to be included.
Similarly, whether amount received or paid relates to the current year, the preceding years or the following year it is fully recorded in the receipts and payments account.
You know it is prepared normally with the help of cash book and ledger (or the trial balance).
But sometimes you may be asked additional information.
In such a situation, you must remember that the income aenxdp e nditure account shows those items which are of revenue nature and records only saumcohu n ts which relates to the current year.
The capital items and receipts and payments relating to the proceeding and the following years are to be excluded.
Then, it also includes the amount of expense and incomes which are yet to be paid or received (outstanding).
Hence, while calculating the amount of each receipt and payment on the basis of the respective income and expenditure as 63  given in the income and expenditure account, you will have to make necessary adjustments in their amounts.
Let us clarify this with the help of an example.
Suppose, the ienxcpoemndei t u raen adc c ount for the year ending December 31, 1988 shows the income from subscriptions as N9000 which includes N800 for subscription outstanding at the end and N600 for subscriptions received in advance during 1987.
It is also observed that during 1988 N 700 was received for subscriptions relating to 1989 and N 400 for subscriptions outstanding at the end of 1987.
Now the amount on account of subscription during 1988 will be worked out as follows: N Income from subscriptions 9000 Less Outstanding at the end 800 8200 Add Outstanding at the beginning 400 8600 Less subs.
Received in advance during 1987 600 8000 Add Subs.
Received in advance during 1988 700 N8700 Thus, you will notice that for calculating the amount of subscriptions received we madajkuest m ents in the income from subscriptions which are just the reverse of what we would do while calculating the income from subscriptions with the help of the figure given in the receipts and payments account and the additional information.
This applies to all items of receipts and payments.
Exercise: I) The income & expenditure account shows an income from subscription at N20000, subscriptions accrued at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year were N 2000 and Nre3sp0e0c0t iv ely.
The figure of the subscription received appearing in the receipts and payments account will be (a) N 2300 (b) N 24000 (c) N 22000 2) The Income and Expenditure Account shows salaries and wages at N24000 .
salary paid for the previous year rounding to N2000 and outstanding for the current year amounted N3000.
The amount of the salaries and wages shown in Receipts and payments Account will be.
a) N22,000 b) N24,000 c) N22,000 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have learnt about the preparation of income & expenditure account and the balance sheet from a trial balance.
And the preparation of receipts and payments account from income and expenditure account.
5.0 SUMMARY In case of non-trading organization, we normally prepare the income and expenditure account and balance sheet from the receipts and payments account and other information.
These statements can also be prepared from a trial balance if given.
Sometimes however, the receipts and payments 64  account itself may have to be prepared from the income an expenditure account and ointhfoerrm ation.
In such a situation, each item of receipt and payment will have to be worked out by making necessary adjustment in the respective incomes and expenses.
The capital receipts and capital payments will also have to be found out and included in the receipts and closing payments account.
The opening and closing balances of cash and bank may be taken from the opening and closing balance sheets.

This unit (unit 12) intend to build on what you learnt in unit 11 i.e in addition you will also learn about the preparation of the final accounts of professionals like doctors, solicitors etc whose main job is to provide some personal services as consultants and not involved in trading of goods in this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: * prepare opening and closing balance sheets from Receipts & Payments and Income & Expenditure Accounts.
* Prepare final accounts of professionals.
3.1 PREPARATION OF BALANCE SHEET FROM RECEIPTS & PAYMENTS ACCOUNT AND INCOME & EXPENDITURE ACCOUNTS Sometimes, the receipts & payments account as well as the income & expenditure Account are given and you may be required to prepare the opening and closing balance sheets.
In such a situation, you will have to ascertain the opening and closing balances of various items by making item-wise comparison of the receipts and payments account and income & expenditure account.
This will help you mainly to ascertain the amounts of various outstanding and prepaid expense and income.
As for the fixed assets, the opening balances are generally given under aindfdoirtmioantailo n .
Their closing balances can be easily ascertained by taking into account the additions (and disposal, if any) made during the year as given in the Receipts & payments Account and after adjustment the amount of depreciation as given in the income & expenditure account.
67  3.2 FINAL ACCOUNTS OF PROFESSIONALS The professionals like doctors, solicitors, etc whose main job is to provide personal service as consultants and not trading in goods, maintain books of account like a non-trading concern.
The prepare their final accounts also in the same manner.
The only difference relates to the Income and Expenditure Account which in case of professionals is term as receipts and payments account.
It is so, because they account for their income on cash basis, though the expense are included on accrual basis.
In other word, they take into account the outstanding expense but not the outstanding income.
They adopt cash basis recording income on the ground that their debtors are of a very uncertain nature so that a fee may not be considered as earned until the cash is received, not only that the professional can not file suit for recovery of their fees.
There are two methods which can be adopted with regard to the outstanding fees opfr o f etshseio n als: (i) Ignore the amount of outstanding fees altogether i.e.
do not include it in the incomes at all; or (ii) Include it first in the income as outstanding fee and then make provision for doubtful debts equal to 100% of this amount.
The second method is considered better because the outstanding fees is duly brought into account.
As for the balance sheet, the outstanding fees are shown on the assets side and 100% provision for doubtful debts is deducted there from thus reducing its amount to nil.
Look at the illustration below and see how the final accounts of a professional are prepared.

UNIT 13 74  TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS OF CREDIT Table of content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objective 3.1 Types of instruments of credit 3.2 Bill of exchange 3.3 Promissory note 3.4 Distinction between bill of exchange and promissory note 4.0 Terms and due date of a bill 5.0 Conclusion 6.0 Summary 7.0 Further readings Tutor marked assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION: In your previous unit you learnt about various subsidiary books commonly used in the business for recording certain transactions.
The businessman can also maintain separate subsidiary books for the transactions relating to bills of exchange.
But the number of such transaction is usually small and therefore one may prefer to record them in the Journal itself.
In this unit, we shall first discuss the mature of various instruments of credit including bills of exchange and promissory notes.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: Identify various instrument of credit.
Define bill of exchange Define promissory note Distinguish between bill of exchange and promissory note.
3.1 TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS OF CREDIT Selling goods on credit has become a very common phenomenon in business.
The produce takes raw material on credit and supplies the finished goods to the wholesalers on credit.
Twhheo l esalers in turn provide the credit facilities to the retailers.
The retailers also sell on credit to some of the ultimate consumers.
Credit may also be granted by a money lender, a bank or a financial institution.
Credit is generally provided by obtaining a written document cinasllterudm ent of credit.
The serves a proof for eminence of credit.
The most cinosmtrmumonelnyt s oufs ecdre d it are: i) Bills of Exchange ii) Promissory Notes and 75  3.2 BILL OF EXCHANGE When a seller grants credit to his customers, he would like to have some written document from the buyer to pay the amount on a specified date, on otherwise the payment may not be made on time.
Such a written undertaken generally takes the form of a bill of exchange or a promissory note.
A bill of exchange is drawn by the seller (a creditor) on the buyer (a debtor) asking him to pay the specified amount after a specified period to him or his order, or to a person named in bill, according to the negotiable instrument Act 1882, a bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument.
The above definition makes it clear that there are three parties to a bill of exchange.
They are: Drawer: a person who draws the bill Drawee: a person who accepts the bill Payee: a person who is to receive the payment.
Suppose A Sells goods to B and draws on him a bill for N1000 for two months payable to C. In this example “A” is the drawer, “B” is the drawee and “C” is the payee.
In most of the cases, however, the drawer himself is the payee, look at figure 1.1 for specimen of a bill of exchange.
In this case Dapo draws a bill on Leke for two months for N1000 payable to himself.
Figure 1.1 Bill of Exchange Lagos August 1, 1987 N1000 Revenue Stamp Two months after date pay to me or my order, The sum of One thousand Naira only, for Value received.
To Leke K. Dapo Ibadan Signature When the bill of exchange is drawn it is sent to the drawee for his acceptance.
The drawee has to affix is signature across the bill as a mark of his acceptance and return it to the drawer.
Thus, a bill of exchange has the following features It must be in writing It must contain an order The order must be unconditional It must be signed by the maker of the instrument.
It is made by the creditor It must be for a specified amount and specified period It should be duly accepted by the debtor.
76  3.3 PROMISSORY NOTE As stated earlier a written undertaken by the buyer to make payment on a specified date can take the form of a bill of exchange or as promissory note.
You have learnt that a bill of exchange is drawn by the seller and accepted by the buyer.
A promissory note, on the other hand, is written by the buyer promising the seller to pay a specified amount after a specified period to him, or his order.
It can be defined as “An instrument in writing (not being a bank note or a currency note) containing an unconditional undertaking.
Signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money to, or to the order of a certain person, or to the bearer of tihnest r ument .
In case of a promissory not there are only two parties they are: Maker a person who makes the note and promises to pay the amount.
Payee – a person who is to receive the amount.
Suppose A sells the goods to B and B writes a promissory note in favour of A.
In this example B is the maker and A is the payee.
You should note that no acceptance is required in case of a promissory note because it is made by the person who has to make the payment.
Look at figure 1.2 for the specimen of a promissory note.
In this cases Leke promises to pay N1000 to Dapo.
Figure 1.2 Promissory Note Lagos N1000 August 1, 1987 Revenue Stamp Two months after date I promise to pay Dapo or Order, the sum of One thousand Naira only for Value received.
To Dapo Leke Lagos Signature Thus a promissory not has the following features: It must be in writing It must be an undertaken to pay The undertaken must be unconditional It must be signed by the maker of the instrument It is made by the debtor It must be for a specified amount and period 3.4 DISTINCTION BETWEEN BILL OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTE 77  Keeping in view the features of a bill of exchange and a promissory note, following distinctions can be made between the two: BILL OF EXCHANGE PROMISSORY NOTE ______________________________________________________________ It is an unconditional order It is an unconditional promise to pay to pay It is made by the creditor It is made by the debtor Acceptance by the debtor No acceptance is required is necessary There are three parties to aThere are only two parties to a Bill of exchange Promising note When the bill is dishoured Noting is not necessary It is better to get it noted by the Notary public.
A bill of exchange is a bill receivable (B/R) for the drawer or the payee and a bill payable (B/P) for the drawee.
Similarly a promissory not is a bill receivable for the payee and a bill payable for the maker.
A bill receivable is an asset for the business whereas a bill payable is a liability.
For accounting purposes no distinction is made between bill of exchange and the promissory note.
3.5 TERM AND DUE DATE OF A BILL A bill is generally written for a defined period of time say two months (60 days), three months (90 days).
Etc.
The period of a bill is called ‘Term’ or ‘Tenor’ of a bill, the date of which the bill falls due is called ‘the ‘due date’ or the ‘date of Maturity’.
The due date is calculated by adding three days of grace to the actual period of the bill’ for example, a bill drawn on April 1 for a period of three months will be come due for payment on July 4 (add three months and three days to April, you arrive at July 4th.
If the due date is a public holiday, the bill becomes due on the previous working day.
In the above example, if July 4 were to be a public holiday, July 3 would be treated as the due date.

2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: o Record transaction relating to bills in the journal of drawer, drawee and e ndorse.
80  3.1 TREATMENT OF BILL BY THE HOLDER AND ITS ACCOUNTING As pointed out earlier no distinction is made between a bill of exchange and a promissory note for accounting purpose when a bill or a promissory note is received by the person who is entitled to receive its payment, he becomes a holder of the bill.
It is a bill receivable for him.
He will pass the following journal entry in his book at the time of receiving the bill or promissory note drawn in his fovour.
Bills Receivable A/C DR To Drawee (Being acceptance received from the drawee) The holder of the bill can deal with it in the following three ways: He may retain it till the date of maturity He may discount it with his banker and receive the amount less discount, immediately.
He may endorse it in favour of his own creditor Let us now study what journal entries are to be passed in each case.
3.1.1 RETAINING THE BILL When the holder of the bill decides to retain the bill till the date of maturity no further entry is required till that date.
If on the date of maturity the bill is dis honoured he will pass the following entry.
Bank A/C DR To Bills Receivable A/C (Bill payment received) 3.1.2 DISCOUNTING THE BILL If the holder of the bill needs fund he can approach the bank for encashment of the bill before due date.
The bank will make the payment of the bill after deducting some interest.
The process of encashing the bill with the bank before the date of maturity is called discounting a bill’ and the interest charged by bank is called ‘discount’.
When a bill is discounted the holder of the bill (drawer) will pass the following journal entry in his books.
Bank A/C DR Discount A/C DR To Bill receivable A/C (Being bill discounted) On the date of maturity, payment of a discounted bill will be received by the bank and not by the drawer.
Hence, at the time of payment, the drawer will not pass any entry in his book.
3.1.3 ENDORSING THE BILL When the holder of the bill endorses the bill to a third party, the bill is said to be endorsed.
He is called the endorser and the party to whom it is endorsed is called endorses.
At the time of 81  endorsement, the following journal entries will be passed in his books of the endorser and the endorsee.
________________________________________________________________ Books of Drawer (Endorser) Books of Endorsee ________________________________________________________________ Endorsee (Creditor) DR Bills receivable A/C DR To Bill Receivable A/C To Endorser (Drawer) (Being bill endorsed) (Being bill received) On the date of maturity, the payment will be received by the endorsee.
Hence, at the time of payment the endorser will not pass any entry in his books.
However endorsee will pass the following entry in his books.
Bank A/C DR To Bill Receivable A/C (Being payment received) 3.2 TREATMENT OF BILL BY THE ACCEPTOR AND ITS ACCOUNTING For the person who accept a bill of exchange or makes a promissory note, it is a bill payable.
He will pass the following journal entry in his books when he accepts a bill or make a promissory note.
Drawer (Creditor) DR To Bills payable A/C (Being bill accepted) When a bill is discounted or endorsed by the holder of the bill, the drawee is not required to pass any entry in his books.
He comes into picture only when the bill becomes due for payment, when he makes the payment on due date, he will pass the following journal entry in hirirse s p ebcotoivke of the fact whether the bill is retained, discounted or endorsed.

In such a situation the holder of the bill gets an endorsement from the Notary Public.
The purse of such notation is to establish the facts of presentation and the dishonour.

The holder of the bill has to pay a small charge for service of the Noting Public.
It is called ‘noting charges’.
These noting charges are to be borne ultimately by the drawee.

when the drawee foresee that he would not be able to honour the bill on due date and requested the drawer to draw a new bill in lieu thereof, you also learnt about retiring of the bill i.e when the drawee offer the payment before the due date.
In this unit, you will study about accommodation bills and bills sent for collection and how they are treated or recorded in the books of accounts.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: • Explain the nature of accommodation bills and their accounting treatment • Explain bills sent for collection and their accounting treatment.
3.1 ACCOMODATION BILLS Normally a bill in drawn by the seller on the buyer by the lender on the borrower.
In other words, a bill is drawn for some debt.
Sometimes, a bill is drawn even when no debt is involved.
This is done primarily to help or accommodate a fellow businessman and is called an accommodation bill.
When such a bill is drawn and accepted, the drawer discount it with the bank and the money so raised is either fully utilized by him or share with the drawee before or on the due date, the drawer remits the amount utilized by him to the drawee and the drawee meets the acceptance on the due date by making payment to the bank with which the bill had been discounted.
The parties can also draw separate bills on each other.
In such a situation, each party discount his own bill with the bank and utilizes the payment.
When the bills become due for payment they meet tahcecierp tances and settle their accounts.
From the above discussion it is clear that there can be three types of arrangements in case of accommodation bill.
They are as follows: i) A bill is drawn for accommodation of the drawer only.
ii) A bill is drawn and the proceeds are shared by drawer and drawee.
iii) One bill each is drawn by both the parties on each other i.e two bills are drawn.
The accounting treatment of accommodation bill is similar to the treatment of normal bills.
However, in, case of accommodation bills you should remember that if the amount of the bill is shared by both the parties, the amount of discount charged by the bank is to be borne by both parties.
It is shared in the same proportion as the amount utilized by each party.
A suitable entry for proportionate amount of discount shall also be passed in the journals of both parties.
Look at illustration I below and see how entries are passed when the bill is drawn and accepted for mutual accommodation.
101  ILLUSTRATION 1 On January 1, 1988 Woolmer drawe a bill on Steele for N600 for three months.
Steele accepts the bill and returns it to Woolmer who discounts it for N585 and remits one third of the proceeds to Steele.

In other words the bills are sent for collection to the bank as and when they fall due.
The bank will credit the account of the drawer when it receives the payment of the bill.
Generally, no entries are passed when bills are sent for collection.
An entry is made in the cash book when an intimation about the payment is received from the bank.
But, some accountants prefer to record the entries even when the bills are sent for collection.
In that case the following entries will have to be made in the journal of the holder for the bill sent for collection.
• Bills sent for collection A/C Dr To Bills Receivable A/C Being bill sent for collection • On receipt of intimation from the bank That the payment has been received against the bill, the journal will be: Bank A/C To Bills sent for collection A/C Dr (Being bill sent for collection honoured) • If the bill is dishoured, the journal entry will be: i) Bills Receivable A/C Dr To bills sent for collection A/C (Being bill sent for collection dishonoured) ii) Drawee Dr 103  To Bills Receivable A/C (Being bill dishonoured) Note that no entry is passed in the books of the drawee for bills sent to bank for collection.

The basic objective of preparing the consignment Account is to ascertain the profit or loss on each consignment.
Similarly, when some persons join hands to carry out a specific job or a project (called joint venture) each person called co-venture would like to ascertain his share of profit or loss from the joint venture business.
For this purpose they record the transactions related to the joint venture business in their own books or prepare a separate set of books alltogether.
In this unit you will learn how various transactions related to the joint venture business are recorded when separate set of books are prepared and when the co- venturer decide to record them in their own books without preparing a separate set.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: • Explain the meaning and importance of joint venture.
• Distinguishing joint venture from partnership and consignment.
3.1 JOINT VENTURE When two or more person join together to carry out a specific business venture and share the profit on an agreed basis it is called a ‘Joint Venture’.
Each one of them who join as a party to the joint venture is called co-ventures’ No firm name is normally used for the Joint Venture Business because it’s duration is limited to a short period.
During this period, the co-venturers are free to carry on their own business as usual, unless agreed otherwise.
The business relationship amongst the co-venturer come to an end as soon as the venture is completed.
Thus a joint venture is some kind of a temporary partnership between two or more persons who have agreed to jointly carry out a specific venture.
The joint venture are quite common in construction business, consignment, sale and purchase of property.
Underwriting of shares and debentures etc.
for example, A and B agreed to construct a college building for which they pooled their resources and skills.
A pNr6o0v0id,0e0s 0 and B N400,000 as capital.
In this example, joining hands by A and B to construct a building is a Joint Venture.
A and B are co-venturers .
They will share the profits in the ratio of 6 and 4 (same as the ratio of their Capital).
From the above discussion the essential features of a joint venture can be listed as follows: • It is formed by two or more persons • The purpose is to execute a particular venture or project • No specific firm name is used for the joint venture business • It is of a temporary nature.
Hence, the agreement regarding the venture automatically stands terminated as soon as the venture is completed.
• The co-venturers share profit and loss in the agreed ratio.
However, in the absence of any other agreement between the co-venturers, the profits and losses are to be shared equally.
• During the tenure of joint venture, the co-venturers are free to continue with their own business unless agreed otherwise.
The main advantages of a joint venture are: 3.1.1 ADVANTAGES • Sufficient Resources: Since two or more persons pool their resources, there is sufficient capital available.
• Ability and Experience: In joint venture the different venturers may be having different skills and experience.
The benefit of their common wisdom will be available to the venture.
• Spreading of Risk: The co-venturers agree to share the profits and losses in a particular ratio.
This implies that the risk is also borne by them in that ratio.
110  3.2 JOINT VENTURE AND CONSIGNMENT Even though both consignment and joint venture are in the nature of an agreement between different parties, there are many points of differences between the two.
The main pdoififnetrse n c eosf a re as follows.

3.3 JOINT VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP Though Joint Venture is in the nature of a temporary partnership but in the strict legal sense, it is not a partnership.
Both in join venture and partnership some business is carried on by two or more persons and the profits are shared by all of them.
But there are some basic differences between the two.

3.4 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT Broadly speaking, account of a joint Venture business can be kept in any one of the following four ways: • In the books of one co-venture.
In case the business is not very large, only one of the Venturers may be entrusted with the task of recording the transactions in his books.
In that case all other co- venturers will send their contribution to such venturer and he will open a Joint Venture Account and the personal accounts of other co-venturer in his books.
• In the books of all the co-venturers: when all co-venturers are working actively, each one of them shall open a Joint Venture Account and the personal accounts of other co-venturers in his books.
In such a situation each co-venturer informs others about the transactions undertaken by him so that they can incorporate them in their books.
• Memorandum Joint Venture Account: Sometimes each co-venturer records only such transactions as are directly concerned with him.
In that case he cannot work out the profit or loss because his books do not include all transactions of the joint venture.
Hence, for calculating the profit or loss of the joint venture, a memorandum joint venture account has to be prepared by incorporating all transactions related to the joint venture.
Thereafter the Joint Venture Account is completed and closed.
• Separate set of Books: Sometimes for the sake of convenience, a Separate set of books are maintained for the joint venture.
Under this system a, Joint Bank Account, a Joint VAecncotuurnet and the personal accounts of all the co-venturers are to be opened in the independent set of books of account.
EXERCISES State whether each of the following statement is True or False.
112  1.

2.
A joint venture has a definite life.
3.
Joint venture is the same thing as consignment.

4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you learnt about Joint Venture as when two or more person join together to carry out a specific business venture and share the profit on an agreed basis.
You also learnt about hdeif f erence between joint venture and partnership and the difference between Joint Venture and Consignment.
5.0 SUMMARY Joint Venture is a temporary partnership between two or more persons who have agreed to undertake jointly a specific project or job.
On the completion of the project or the job, the joint venture will automatically come to an end.
The joint venture differ from consignment and partnership in may ways.
The accounts for the joint venture business can be kept in four ways: (i) all recording be done in the books of one co-venturer only (ii) the accounting records be maintained by each one of them in their own books (iii) each co-venturer record his own transaction relating to the joint venture and on the completion of the project a memorandum Joint Venture Account is prepared to find out the profit or loss or (iv) separate set of books of account may be maintained for the joint business and joint account be opened in the bank.
Under the first method only one co-venturer records the joint venture transactions who opens a Joint Venture Account and the personal accounts of other co-venturers.
Under the second method each co-venturer opens a Joint Venture Account and the personal accounts of other co-venturer.
The Joint Venture Account serves the purpose of profit and Loss Account under their method, no Joint Venture Account is maintained.
Each Co-Venturer simply opens the personal accounts of other co-venturers and for ascertaining the profit or loss of the venture, a memorandum Joint Venture Account is prepared.

In this Unit you will learn how various transactions relating to the Joint Venture business are recorded and when the Co-Venturers decide to record them in their own books without preparing a separate set of books.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this Unit you should be able to: • Record Joint Venture transaction in the books of one Joint Venturer.
• Record Joint Venture transaction in the books of all Joint Venturer.
• Prepare memorandum Joint Venture Account.
3.1 RECORDING IN THE BOOKS OF ONE CO-VENTURER If Joint Venture business is not very large, the task of recording transactions can very well be entrusted to one of the Co-Venturers.
He will prepare a Joint Venture Account and personal accounts of other co-venturers.
The Joint Venture Account is prepared for ascertaining the profit or loss of the joint venture.
The personal account of other co-venturers are prepared to find out the amount due from them.
As stated earlier, each co-venutrers is also entitled to carry on his own business and these transactions will be in addition to what he records in respect of his obwusnin ess.
The following journal entries are passed in his books before preparing the necessary accounts of the joint venture.
• When the Co-venturers send their contribution Cash / Bank A/C DR To Co-Venturer’s Personal A/C • When the goods purchased for the Joint Venture: Joint Venture A/C DR To Cash / Bank A/C • When the goods are supplied form his own stock by the Co-Venturer who is recording the transactions: 115  Joint Venture A/C DR To purchases A/C Here we are crediting Purchases Account because he is supplying the goods from his own stock at cost.
But if the goods are supplied by him at a price other than the cost price, we shall credit the Sales Account instead of the Purchases Account.
• When the goods are supplied by other coventurers Joint Venture A/C DR Co-Venturers Personal A/C CR • When some expenditure is incurred on account of the Joint Venture.
Joint Venture A/C DR Cash / Bank A/C But, if expenses are paid by a Co-Venturer other than the one-who is recording the transactions, then the entry will be: Joint Venture A/C DR Co-Venturer’s Personal A/C Here we have debited the Joint Venture Account because it is an expenditure on account of the Joint Venture business.
• When the Co-Venturer recording the transaction sells the goods.
(a) For cash Cash / Bank A/C DR To Joint Venture A/C (b) For Credit Sales Debtor’s Personal A/C DR Joint Venture A/C • When Cash is received from debtors: Cash / Bank A/C DR Debtor’s Personal A/C • When some cash discount is allowed to the debtor making payment, or some bad debt are incurred: Joint Venture A/C DR Debtor’s Personal A/C • When sales are made by other co-venturers: Co-Venturer’s Personal A/C DR Joint Venture A/C • When some cash or bills receivable are received from other co-venturers.
On account of sales made by them.
Cash / Bank / Bill Receivable A/C DR Co-Venturer’s Personal A/C • When the co-venutrer’s recording the transactions is entitled to some commission or salary.
Joint Venture A/C DR Commission/Salary A/C 116  Joint Venture Account is debited as it is an expenditure related to the Joint Venture business.
• When unsold stock of joint venture is taken over by the co-venturer recording the transactions: Purchases A/C DR Joint Venture A/C If the unsold stock is taken over by some other Co-Venturer, the journal entry will be: Co-Venturer’s personal A/C DR Joint Venture A/C After passing the above entries, the Joint Venture Account is prepared.
The balance of this account will show either profit or loss which is to be shared by all the coventurers in their profit sharing ratio.
This will required the following further entries: (a) If it show profit: Joint Venture A/C (his own share) To Co-Venturer’s personal A/C (Individually for their share) (b) If it result in loss Profit & Loss A/C (his own share of loss) Co-Venturer’s Personal A/C (Individually for their shares) Joint Venture A/C After closing the Joint Venture Account, we have to find out the amount due to other CVoen- turers.
When this amount is sent to them we record the following entry.
Co-Ventruer’s Personal A/C DR Cash / Bank A/C 3.2 REOCRDING IN THE BOOKS OF ALL CO-VENTURES Under the second method, all transactions relating to the joint venture are recorded in the books of all the co-venturers.
In order to complete the joint venture account in the books of all co-venturers, each co-venturer sends the necessary information about his dealings to the other co-venturers.
There is not much of a difference in the recording of transactions between the first and the second method.
We will be having similar entries in the joint venture accounts in each co-venturer’s books who shall all open the personal accounts of other co-venturers.
See recommended text book to clearly understand the recording of transactions under the first and the second method.
3.3 MEMORANDUM JOINT VENTURE ACCOUNT METHOD In the method discussed above each co-venturer records all transactions relating to the joint venture in the Joint Venture Account opened in his books.
But, under the memorandum Joint Venture Account method each co-venturer will record only those transaction relating to the joint venture which are directly concerned with him, and not those of others.
Under this method each co-ventruer opens a Joint Venture Account including the name of the other co-venturer.
For example, if A and B are partners in a joint venture, then, in the books of A it will be termed as ‘Joint Venture with B Account.
Each co-venturer will record only such transactions which are 117  actually effected by him.
For example if goods are purchased by A, for the joint venture it will recorded only by A and not other co-ventures.
Similarly, if co-venturers goods are sold by B, it will be recorded in the books of B only.
This account is in the nature of a personal account and therefore, will not disclose the profit or loss of the venture.
For that purpose we prepare an additional account called ‘MEMORANDUM JOINT VENTURE ACCOUNT’ This is like profit and loss A/C.
Let us say A and B enter into a Joint Venture and certain transactions have taken place for which the following entries will be passed in each co-venturer’s books.
• A purchases goods for cash: This transaction shall be recorded in the books of A only.
The entry will be: Joint Venture with B A/C DR Cash A/C • A incurs some expenditure on account of the joint venture: Joint Venture with B A/C DR Cash A/C • B Sells goods for cash: No entry will be made in A’s books.
But the following entry will be made in B’s books: Cash Account DR Joint Venture (with A) A/C • B Sends money to A: (a) It shall be recorded in B’s book as follows: Joint Venture with A A/C DR Cash / Bank A/C (b) It shall be recorded in A’s book as follows: Cash / Bank A/C To Joint Venture with B A/C As stated earlier, for ascertaining the profit or loss on the joint venture, we prepare a memorandum joint venture account.
This account is prepared exactly on the pattern of profit and loss account.
Since this account does not form part of the double entry system, the word ‘memorandum’ is prefixed.
The method of preparing this account is very simple.
It is prepared on the basis of information supplied by all the co-venturers.
The debit entries appearing in the personal accounts of all co- venturers are written on the debit side of the memorandum account and the entries appearing on the credit side of those account are shown on the credit side of the memorandum joint venture account.
However, you should remember that the transaction which do not relate to an item of expense or income are to be excluded from this memorandum account.
The difference in the total of the debit side and the credit side represents profit or loss.
The profit or loss thus calculated is then shared by the co-ventruers in the agreed profit sharing ratio.
Each co-ventruer will record only his share of profit or loss.

UNIT 20 JOINT VENTURE.
ACCOUNTING TREATMENT II Table of content 120  1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Interest in joint venture transactions 3.2 Separate set of books 3.3 Treatment of cash discount 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further readings 7.0 Tutor marked assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the previous Units on consignment you have studied how various transactions relating to the consignment are recorded in the books of the concerned parties.
The basic objectives of preparing the consignment Account is to ascertain the profit or loss on each consignment.
Similarly, where some persons join hands to carry out a specific job or a project (called joint venture) each person called co-venturer) would like to ascertain his share of profit or loss from the joint vbeunsitnueres s. For this purpose they record the transactions related to joint venture business in their own books or prepare a separate set of books altogether.
In this unit you will learn about interest in joint venture transaction, treatment of cash discount and when and how separate set of books are prepared 2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: • Prepare and explain separate set of books for the joint venture business.
3.1 INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION When the co-venturers invest money in Joint Venture business and receive back the amount on different dates.
It is quite usual for them to agree to calculate interest at a certain rate.
Each co-venturer is entitled to receive interest on the amounts invested by him and pay interest on the amounts received by him.
You should remember that only the net interest receivable from, or payable on to, the co-venturer is recorded in the Joint Venture Account.
Thus, the net amount of interest is also taken into account before ascertaining the profit or loss on joint venture 3.3 SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS So far you have studied the methods of recording joint ventures transactions where no separate set of books were maintained.
Now we shall study another method where co-venturers agree to keep separate set of books for recording the joint venture transaction.
When separate set of books are maintained, the joint venture transactions are recorded as a separate accounting entity on the basis of double entry principles.
Under this method the following accounts are opened: 1.
Joint Bank Account 121  2.
Joint Venture Account 3.
Personal accounts of each co-venturer Joint Bank Account is a real account like the ordinary Bank Account.
All co-venturers pay or deposit their contribution in this account.
The joint venture Account is like a profit & loss account which shows all the expenses and incomes of the joint venture.
The personal accounts of the co- venturers simply show their contributions in the form of goods, cash or expenses and the amounts received by them.
Let us now see the various journal entries which are normally recorded under this method.
• When co-venturers contribute their share of capital: Joint Bank A/C DR To co-venturers Personal A/Cs • When a co-venutrer contributed in the form of goods: Joint Venture A/C DR To co-venturer’s Personal A/C • When purchases are made for joint venture: If on Cash DR Joint Venture A/C To Joint Bank A/C • If on Credit: Joint Venture A/C DR To Creditor’s Personal A/C Note that when goods are purchased for the joint venture business, you will debit the joint venture account not the purchases account.
• When expenses are incurred on account of joint venturer: (a) If paid out of Joint Bank A/C DR Joint Venture A/C To Joint Bank A/C (b) If paid by a Co-Venturer: Joint Venture A/C DR To Co-venturer’s Personal A/C • When goods are sold: (a) For cash sales: Joint Bank A/C DR To Joint Venture A/C (b) For credit sales: Debtor’s Personal A/C DR To Joint Venture A/C • When Creditors are paid: Creditor’s Personal A/C DR To Joint Bank Account • When amounts are received from debtors: 122  Joint Bank A/C DR To Debtor’s Personal A/C • Any commission, interest, etc.
payable to a co-venturer: Joint Venture A/C DR To Co- venturer’s personal A/C • Unsold stock taken over by a co-venturer: Co-venturer’s Personal A/C DR To Joint Venture A/C Now if we balance the Joint Venture Account it will disclose the amount of profit or loss made on the joint venture which is to be shared by the co-venturers in their profit sharing ratio.
The entries for the distribution of profit or be loss will be follows: (a) In case of profit: Joint Venture A/C DR To Co-venturer’s Personal A/Cs • In case of loss: Co-venturer’s Personal A/Cs DR To Joint Venture A/C This close the Joint Venture Account.
After transacting the amount of profit or loss to the co- venturer’s personal accounts, you can find out the amount payable to each one of them.
When the payment is made, the journal entry will be as follows: Co-venturers Personal Account DR To Joint Bank A/C You will notice the balance in the Joint Bank Account will be sufficient to pay off all the co- venturers, and when the above entries are passed all the accounts will be closed.
3.3 TREATMENT OF CASH DISCOUNT: When some cash discount is allowed by the creditors it will be an item of gain for the joint venture.
Hence it is credited to the joint venture account.
The journal entry will be: Creditors Personal A/C DR Joint Venture A/C Similarly, when some cash discount is allowed to the debtors it will be an item of loss for the joint venture and, therefore, is debited to the Joint Venture Account.
The journal entry will be: Joint Venture A/C DR To Debtors Personal A/C The same entry is passed in case of bad debts.
EXERCISES What is memorandum Joint Venture Account.
4.0 CONCLUSION 123  In this unit you have learnt about, interest in joint venture transactions, separate set of books of account i.e on completion of the project a memorandum joint venture account is prepared to find out the profit or loss or separate set of books of accounts may be maintained for the joint business and a joint account be opened in the bank.
You also learnt about the treatment of cash discount.
5.0 SUMMARY The joint venture account serves the purpose of Profit and Loss Acount, under the third method no Joint Venture Account is maintained each Co-Venturers simply opens the personal Accounts of other co-venturers and for as-certaining the profit or loss of the venture a memorandum Joint Venture is prepared.
When any of the methods is followed no separate books are maintained for the Joint Venture business.
All transactions are recorded in the books of the cthoe-mvesnetluvreesr.s U nder the fourth method of separate set of books are prepared for the joint venture business treating it as a separate according entity, and all transactions are recorded satcrcicotulyn ti ng to the double entry system.
The main accounts prepared under this method are: (1) Joint Ventures Account (2) Joint Banking Account and (3) The Personal Accounts of the co- venturer.
In this case also the Joint venture Account serve the purpose of a Profit and Loss Account.

124  UNIT 21 CONCEPTS OF CONSIGNMENT Table Of Content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 What Is Consignment 3.2 Parties To Consignment 3.3 Features Of Consignment 3.4 Distinction Between Sale And Consignment 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further Readings 7.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION The producers often make use of Selling Agent and ‘Distributors’ in their channel of distribution.
This is particularly true of the agricultural goods.
The Selling Agents/Distributors act in various ways.
One of the methods used is to receive the goods on consignment basis.
Under this system the agent receives the goods and undertakes to sell it on behalf of the consignor.
He often settles the account of the consignor after all the goods received from him have been sold.
This involves certain peculiarities in accounting.
In this Unit you will learn about various concepts relating to consignment and basic framework of accounting for consignment transactions in the books of the consignor and the consignee.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit, you should be able to: 125  o Explain the meaning of consignment o Distinguish it from sale o Identify the parties involved in consignment and describe their relationship o Explain the distinction between sale and consignment 3.1 WHAT IS CONSIGNMENT You know that goods are often sent by the producer on consignment basis to the selling agents or distributors.
Let us now understand what exactly we mean by consignment, how does it differ from sales and what kind of relationship exist between the consignor and the consignee.
When goods are sent by a manufacturer or a trader to an agent to be sold by him on commission basis and at the risk and account of the former, they are said to be sent on consignment.
In other words a producer/trader forwards his products to his selling agents, appointed at different places, to sell them on his behalf for an agreed commission the process of sending goods on this basis by one firm to another for sale is known as “consignment” and this transaction is c“aclolnedsi g n ma e nt Transaction”.
The consignment is “Outward Consignment” for the person who sends the goods and an “Inward consignment” for the person who receives the goods for sale.
3.2 PARTIES TO CONSIGNMENTS You know that in consignment the goods are sent by one person to another for sale by the latter on behalf of the former.
Therefore, there are two parties involved: the person who sends the goods and, the person to whom the goods are sent.
The person who send the goods to the agent is called the consignor and the person to whom the goods are sent for sale is called the consignee.
If ‘X’ sends goods to ‘Y’ for sale, ‘X’ is known as consignor and ‘Y’ consignee.
The consignor is the principal and the consignee is the agent.
The mutual relations are governed by the law of Agency and of course by the terms of the contract between themselves.
The consignee is a special kind of agent who is in possession of the goods.
He passes the title of the goods to those who buy from him even if he sell the goods in contravention to the principals instructions.
Suppose, the consignor instructs the consignee not to sell the goods below a certain price.
If the consignee sells the goods below the stipulated price, the buyer will have more advantages to the gcoonosdisg.nTohre m ay, of course ask the consignee to pay damages for braking the terms of the contract with him.
Like all agents, the consignee must render true accounts to the consignor, be faithful to him, and act according to his instructions.
He is entitled to remuneration and reimbursement of expenses incurred by him on behalf of the consignor.
3.3 FEATURES OF CONSIGNMENT • Goods are forwarded by the consignor to the consignee with an objective of sale at a profit.
• Under the consignment, goods are to be treated as the property of the consignor and to be sold at his risk entirely.
The consignee does not buy the goods, he merely undertakes to sell them on behalf of the consignor.
He is not responsible for any loss or even for any destructions or damage to the goods.
But the consignee should not show any negligence.
• The consignor does not sell the goods to the consignee.
Therefore, he cannot ask the consignee to pay the price of the goods unless they are sold and the sale proceeds are actually realized.
• The consignee agrees to sell the goods for an agreed rate of commission and is allowed to deduct his commission due from the sale proceeds.
126  • The agent enters into the picture only when he sells the goods and realizes the amount.
He becomes indebted for amounts realized on behalf of the principal.
The relationship between the consignor and the consignee is that of a principle and an agent.
• As it is not a sale, whatever the consignee does is on behalf of the consignor and therefore, all legitimate expenses incurred by the consignee for receiving and selling the goods should be reimbursed.
• Any stock remaining unsold with the consignee belongs to the consignor.
• As the consignee acts on behalf of the consignor the profit or loss on sale of good sent on consignment belongs to the consignor.
3.4 DISTINCTION BETWEEN SALE AND CONSIGNMENT Although the possession of goods is transferred from one person to the other both in case of sale and in case of consignment, they differ from each other in various ways.
The difference between an out right sale and the goods sent on consignment has been explained as follows: 127  No and Item Sale Consignment 1.

The agents sell goods on behalf of the manufacturer or the trader.
The person to whom the goods are sent is called the consignee and the sender of the goods is called the consignor.
The relationship between the consignor and the consignee is that of principle and agent.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have successfully been introduce to the concept of consignment i.e sending goods from one party to the order.
The sender of the goods is the consignor while the person to whom the good is sent is known as the consignee.
The relationship between the two is a principal and agent relationship under the consignment, goods are to be treated as the property of the consignor and to be sold at his risk entirely.
There is a fine distinction between sale and consignment.

They are proforma Invoice, account sales, non-recurring and recurring expenses, and commission advance.
etc.
These are going to be explained in this unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: 130  Explain the Important terms in consignment account 3.1 PROFORMA INVOICE: Since the, goods are sent on consignment cannot be treated as sales, the consignor does nporetp are proper invoice.
He simply prepare a Proforma Invoice and sends it to the consignee along with the goods dispatched.
This is prepare with a view to inform the consignee about the price of goods, expenses incurred, Mode or transportation and Minimum sale price at which the goods are to be sold.
3.2 ACCOUNT SALES: As the Consignee is an agent and he’s selling the goods on behalf of consignor, he has to furnish the details of sale proceeds, expenses, commission, etc, to the consignor.
He furnishes all these details by means of a statement called ‘Account Sales’.
This shows the quality and description of goods sold, sale proceeds realized, the expenses incurred by the consignee, commission due to him, and the balance amount payable by him to the consignor.
While preparing the Account Sales, the consignee will deduct all expenses incurred by him in relation to the consignment and the commission due to him.
The remittance made in advance, if any, are also to be deducted from the balance so obtained.
The consignee will send a bank draft or his acceptance for the balance due to the consignor.
3.3 COMMISSION: It is the remuneration paid to the consignee by the consignor in consideration of the services rendered by the former in selling the goods consigned.
This Commission can be divided into two types (i) Ordinary Commission and (ii) Special Commission.
(i) Ordinary Commission: It is a commission usually paid as a fixed percentage on gross sale proceeds.
The term commission normally denotes ordinary commission, unless specified otherwise.
The consignee is not responsible for any bad debts and he does not guarantee the payment from all those who buy on credit so long as he is getting ocordminmairsys i on only.
(ii) Special Commission: This is the Commission which the consignee gets over and above the ordinary commission.
It can be sub-divided into two categories (a) ocovmerm-riidssiniogn , (b) Del Credre Commission (a) Over – riding Commission: This is an extra Commission allowed over and above the normal Commission and is generally offered when the agent is required to put in hard work either in introducing a new product in the Market or where he is entrusted with the act of supervising the performance of other agents in a particular area.
This Commission is also given for sales at prices higher than the price fixed by the consignor.
(b) Del Credre Commission: usually, all the losses are borne by the Consignor.
Sometimes the Consignor expects that the consignee should also be responsible for recovering the debts and bear the loss on account of bad debts if any.
In order to Compensate him for this responsibility, he is given some extra Commission called ‘Del Credre Commission’.
Such Commission is calculated on the total sales, unless there is special agreement to the effect that it is to be paid only on the amount of credit sales.
Payment of this Commission imposes extra liability on the consignee and induces him to deal in a prudent and caution manner.
3.4 EXPENSES: Expenses relating to consignment of goods are divided into two categories: 131  (i) Non-recurring Expenses: All the expenses which are incurred for bringing goods to the consignee are nonrecurring in nature such expenses are generally incurred on tchoen s ignment as a whole.
The non-recurring expenses will be incurred partly by the consignor and partly by the consignee.
(ii) Recurring Expenses: These expenses are incurred after the goods have reached the consignee’s place.
They are recurring in nature because they may be incurred repeatedly by the consignor and the consignee.
The examples of recurring expenses incurred by the consignor are: advertising, discount on bills, commission on collection of cheques, traveling, expenses of salesman, bad debts, etc.
The example of recurring expenses incurred by consignee are; rent, insurance, sales promotion, etc.
3.5 ADVANCE: It is a common trade practice for the consignor to demand some advance from the consignee as security for the goods dispatched to him.
It may be in the form of cash or bank draft or in form of a bill of exchange.
The consignee will send some amount as an advance before or after he receives the goods from the consignor.
The advance received from the consignee should not be credited to consignment account as it is not a part of the sale proceeds.
The advance will be adjusted against the amount due from the consignee when the accounts are finally settled.
In some cases, a bill may be drawn on the consignee if he is not in a position to pay advance money.
The consignor can discount the Bill with his bankers.
In such a case the value of the bill (as advance) so accepted will be deducted from sale proceeds.
The discount paid to the bank can be straight away charged to the profit and loss Account as it represent cost of raising finance.

For this purpose the consignor prepares a consignment account relating to each consignment to which all concerned expenses including the cost of goods consigned are debited and the sales proceeds and the closing stock are credited.
In addition, he also maintain a consignee’s account in order to complete the amount due from him.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit you should be to: * record various consignment transaction in the Journal.
3.1 BOOKS OF THE CONSIGNOR 133  You know each transaction is recorded first in a subsidiary book and then posted to the respective account in the ledger.
All transactions related to consignment therefore, are first recorded in the Journal.
The entries passed in respect of various transactions are as follows: i.
Goods dispatched to the consignee: As you know the consignment of goods cannot be treated as a sale of goods.
Therefore, sales Account will not be credited.
In its place, an account called ‘Goods sent consignment Account will be credited and the consignment account is debited with the cost of the goods consigned.
Thus the journal entry will be as follows: If consignments have been sent to more than one consignee, the consignment accounts may be distinguished by adding the names of the places to the consignment account (for example consignment to calcuta Account, consignment to Gonda Account, etc.)
ii) Expenses incurred by the consignor: All expenses incurred by the consignor on consignment of goods are debited to the consignment Account and are thus added to cost of goods consigned.
The entry would be: Consignment A/C DR To Cash/Bank A/C (Being the expense incurred on the consignment) iii.
Advance made by the consignee: The amount of advance received from the consignee cannot be treated as sale proceeds, and so should not be credited to the consignment Account.
It is treated as follows.
Cash/Bank/Bills Receivable A/C DR To consignee’s A/C (Being an advance from the consignee) iv.
Bill received from the consignee discounted with the bank: If the consignor gets the bill receivable discounted from his bankers, the entry will be: Bank A/C DR Discount A/C DR To Bills Receivable A/C (Being bill discounted with the bank) v. Receipt of account sales from the consignee: when the goods are sold out, the consignee will send the Account sales to the consignor intimating him the total sales to the amount of his expenses and commission.
The following three entries will be recorded in this connection.
(a) For sales made by the consignee: Consignee’s A/C DR To consignment A/C (Being gross proceeds of sales) (c) For consignee’s expenses: Consignment A/C DR To Consignee’s A/C (Being expenses incurred by the consignee in dealing with consignment) 134  (d) For consignee’s Commission: Consignment A/C DR To Consignee’s A/C (Being Commission Payable on sale Proceeds) vii.
Goods returned by the Consignee: Sometimes deftective or obsolete goods are returned by the consignee to the consignor.
When such goods are received, the journal entry will be: Goods sent on consignment A/C DR To consignment A/C (Being goods returned by the consignment) vii.
Bad debts incurred: When the consignee is entitled to del credre commission no entry for bad debts is to be passed as such loss is to be borne by the consignee himself.
But when del credre commission is not paid, the loss on account of bad debt is to be borne by theconsignor Consignment A/C DR To Consignee’s A/C (Being Value of Bad debts) viii.
Remittance by the consignee in full settlement: The balance amount will have to be remitted by the consignee to the consignor on settlement.
The following entry will be recorded, when the consignee remits to the consignor.
Cash/Bank/Receivable A/C DR To consignee’s A/C (Being balance due from the consignee received) ix.
Profit loss on consignment: when you balance the consignment Account, it reveals profit or loss.
If the total of credit side is more than the total of debit side, it is a profit and if the total of debit side is more than that of he credit side, it is a loss.
The profit or loss is transferred to the profit and loss Account and thus the consignment Account is closed.
The following entries will be recorded: a.
If there is a profit: Consignment A/C DR Profit and Loss A/C (Being profit on consignment) b.
If there is loss: Profit & Loss A/C DR Consignment A/C (Being loss on consignment) (x) Closing entry for goods sent on consignment: Goods sent on consignment Account is closed to the Trading Account.
The entry is as follows: Goods sent on consignment A/C DR Trading A/C (Being goods sent on consignment account closed) (xi.)
Unsold stock with the consignee: It is quite possible that all the goods sent on consignment are not sold by the consignee up to the date on which final 135  accounts are prepared.
Some goods may remain unsold.
Known as the consignment stock.
This should be properly valued and credited to the consignment account.
You will learn about the valuation of unsold stock in the next unit.
However the entry for consignment stock will be Consignment Stock A/C DR Consignment A/C (Being unsold goods with the consignee) (a) attach content of (a) here (a) you have learnt hoe to record consignment transaction in the journal of the consignor.
Now let us see how various accounts effected are shown in the ledger and how profit or loss on consignment is worked out.
The consignor usually maintains the three accounts.
3.2 CONSIGNMENT ACCOUNT It is prepared by the consignor showing all transactions relating to a particular consignment.
The objective of this account is to ascertain net profit/loss arising from each consignment.
Once goods are consigned by the consignor, its cost is desisted to the consignment Account along with various expenses incurred by the consignor and the consignee in dealing with that particular consignment.
The commission due to the consignee is also debited to the consignment Account.
When Del credre Commission is not paid the bad debts, if any are also to be debited to this account.
Once the goods reach the consignee some of these will be unsold and the rest sold either on cash or on credit.
Irrespective of the type of sale, the entire sale proceeds will be shown on the credit side of the consignment Account.
The unsold goods are treated as consignment stock and credited to this Account.
If some goods are found unsuitable for sale, the consignee will send them back to the consignor and the same will appear on the credit side.
After all these items are recorded, the consignment Account is balanced.
The difference between the debit and credit totals ocof n signment Account is regarded as profit or loss which is transferred to the profit and lAocssc o unt and the consignment Account stands closed.
It is infact a nominal account and is just like Trading and Profit and Loss Account about which you have studied earlier in final accounts.
Therefore, the principles applied to Trading and Profit & Loss Account hold good for this account also.
Like Trading and Profit & Loss all expenses and purchases are debited to this account and all sales and incomes are credited.

Should be studied together.
In unit 6 you learnt about the Journal entries required for various transactions in consignment.
In this unit you will study the account that are prepared in the consignment transaction such as consignor’s A/C, Bad debt A/C, commission A/C and the entries that are needed to be passed in the book of the consignee.
2.0 OBJECTIVE 138  After study in this unit you should able to: * record all transactions relating to the consignment in the journal and then post them to the relevant accounts including consignors’ Accounts including consignors Account in the book of the consignee.
3.1 BOOKS OF THE CONSIGNEE The Consignee mainly prepare a consignor’s account in his book to find out what is finally due to the consignor.
He record all transactions relating to the consignment first in the Journal and them post then to the relevant account (including consignor’s account) in the ledger.
The Journal entries passed by the consignee are: * Receipt of goods from the consignor: No entry is passed by the consignee when he receives goods from the consignor because receipt of goods on consignment does not amount to purchases of goods by him.
He keeps them on behalf of the consignor for which he usually maintain an inwards consignment book.
* Expenses incurred by the Consignor: No entry is passed by the Consignee.
* Advance made by the consignee Consignor’s A/C DR To Bank / Bill Payable A/C (Being advance made by the Consignee) * Bill discounted by the Consignor with the bank: No entry is passed by consignee.
* Sale of goods by the consignee Cash A/C (Cash Sales) DR Consignment Debtor’s A/C DR (Credit Sales) To Consignor’s A/C (Being goods Sold) * Expenses Incurred by the consignee: Being an agent of the consignor, all legitimate expenses incurred by the consignee related to the consignment are to be reimbursed by tchoen s ignor, the entry will be: Consignor’s A/C DR Cash / Bank A/C (Being expenses incurred on consignment) * Commission due to the consignee: This should include all types of commission due to the consignee: The entry will be Consignor’s A/C DR Commission A/C (Being Commission due on sales) * Return of goods to consignor: No entry will be passed in the books of the consignee as no entry was passed at the time of receipt of the goods.
* Payment Received from Debtors 139  Cash / Bank A/C DR To consignment Debtors A/C (Being amount collected from Debtors) * Bad debts incurred (a) If consignee does not get del credre commission all bad debt are to be borne by the consignor himself.
The entry will be Consignor’s A/C DR To consignment Debtors A/C (Being bad debts on consignment) (b) If del credre commission is paid to the consignee, the bad debts are to be borne by him.
The entry will be: Bad Debts A/C DR To consignment Debtor’s A/C (Being bad debts incurred on consignment) * When the bills payable accepted in favour of consignor is met on the due date: Bills payable A/C DR (Being bills payable honoured) * Remittance in final settlement consignor’s A/C DR To Cash/ Bank Account To Bills Receivable Account (Being payment of the balance due to the consignor) * Unsold stock in possession of the consignee: No entry will be passed for unsold goods in the books of the consignee as no entry is passed when he received goods from the consignor.
* Profit or Loss on Consignment: No entry is passed for profit or loss on consignment as the consignee is not concerned with it.
The consignee also prepares ledger accounts after passing all the journal entries.
Tcohnes i gnor’s Account and commission Account are the two important accounts prepared by consignee in his books.
Of course, he will also do the postings to the other accounts such as consignment debtors account, consignment expenses account and bills payable account, etc.
But these are of less importance, hence not discussed here.
3.2 CONSIGNOR’S PERSONAL ACCOUNT: This is the main account in consignee’s ledger which is prepared for working out the amount due to the consignor.
Whatever amount he receives from sales of goods is credited to this account.
All expenses incurred by the consignee in relation to consignment, the commission due to him and the advance given by him to the consignor will be debited to this account.
Further, if the consignee does not get del credre commission the bad debts on account of credit sales are also debited to the consignor’s Account.
The balance of this account indicates the amount payable to the consignor.
This account is just the opposite of the consignee’s Account in the book of the consignor.
* Commission Account: This is nominal account.
It shows the income earned by the consignee for the services rendered by him.
All types of commission whether, ordinary or special, due to the consignee is credited to this account.
The commission account, will be 140  debited with bad debts if the consignee is to bear such loss because of del ccroemdrmei s sion FORMAT DR COMMISSION ACCOUNT DR N N To Bad debts XXX By consignors XXX A/C A/C (Consignment To Profit & XXX Commission) Loss A/C (balance) __________ __________ XXXX XXXX EXERCISE (1) Explain why the consignee does not pass any entry for (a) Goods sent on consignment (b) Profit or loss on consignment (c) Closing Stock (2) Explain the importance of del credre commission.
4.0 CONCLUSION The Relationship between the consignor and the consignee is that of a principal and an agent.
While sending goods to the consignee the consignor sends proforma invoice which gives full details about the goods consigned.
After the goods has been sold, the consignee pArcecpoaurenst s aalne s , giving full details about the number of units sold and price plus the expenses incurred.
5.0 SUMMARY In other to work out the profit or loss on each consignment and amount due from consignee, the consignor prepares consignment Account, Goods sent on consignment Account and consignee’s personal account in his ledger for each consignment.
The consignee on the other hands, mainly prepares two accounts in sin his books.
Commission Account and consignor personal Account.
This helps him to know the amount due to the consignor and his income from commission.

UNIT 25 CONSIGNMENT ACCOUNT II (UNSOLD STOCK) Table Of Content 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Direct Recording In The Ledger 3.2 Valuation Of Unsold Stock 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further Readings 7.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the previous unit you learnt about the basic accounting frame work relating to the goods sent on consignment basis i.e the entries to be passed in the books of consignor and the consignee.
You know the methods of working out the profit on each consignment when all the goods are sold out.
In practice you will find that at the time of submitting the account sales, some goods may remain unsold.
Then there is also a possibility of loss while the goods are in transit or while they are lying in the warehouse of the consignee.
Such loss may occur due to normal or abnormal causes.
In this unit you will learn how the value of unsold goods is worked out and recorded in books of account.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: * Record consignment transaction directly in the ledger account of the * consignor and the consignee.
* Compute the value of unsold stock.
3.1 DIRECT RECORDING IN THE LEDGER You know for each consignment the consignor prepares the consignment account, the goods sent on consignment account and the commission account in his books.
In unit 24 you learnt that all transaction relating to consignment are first recorded in the Journal and then posted into the above mentioned ledger accounts.
Sometimes, you may be asked to prepare the ledger account directly 142  i.e without passing any journal entries.
You should therefore learn how to prepare these account directly.
You should debit the consignment Account with the cost of goods Consigned, expenses incurred by the consignor, expenses incurred the consigned’ commission; and credit it with sales (both cash and credit ) and the goods returned by the consignee by the consignee.
The consignee’s Account will be debited with the sales made by him and credited with his expenses commission arenmd it tance made to the consignor.
The consignor Account in the books of consignee is just the reverse of consignee’s Account in consignor’s books.
It is debited with the expenses ,incurred by the consignee, the commission due to him and the remittance made to the consignor on account; and credited with the total amount of sales.
3.2 VALUATION OF UNSOLD STOCK In practice, you will find that at the time of submitting the account sale, a part of goods consigned will still be unsold and will be lying with the consignee.
In order to calculate the true profit or loss on consignment the unsold stock should be valued and accounted for.
Let us therefore learn first how the unsold stock is valued.
You know that valuation of unsold stock is usually done at cost.
Cost in case of consignment stock would include the cost at which the goods are consigned plus the proportionate non recurring expenses i.e all those expenses incurred till the goods reach the warehouse of the consignee.
You should note that all non-recurring expenses, whether incurred by the consignor or by the consignee, are to be taken into account.
In the absence of details of expenditure incurred by the consignee, all expenses incurred by him are to be taken as recurring expenses and thus are not to be considered in the calculation of closing stock in other words, while valuing the closing stock we add such proportionate expenses to the cost price that have been incurred up to the time the goods are brought to the place of the consignee.
Any other expenses paid by the consignor or the consignee after the point will not be considered, as these expenses do not add to the value of the goods.
Such expenses are warehouse rent, selling expenses, carriage outwards, warehouse insurance, discount etc.
• Following expenses are usually added for calculation of closing stock Carriage and Freight Loading Charges Customs Duty Clearing Charges Dock dues Carriage paid up to the warehouse unloading charges • Following are the expenses which are not considered or calculation of closing stock Warehouse rent Discount Bad Debt Insurance of the goods in the warehouse selling and distribution expenses.
You will notice that all expenses incurred by the consignor are considered for valuation of the closing stock.
The problem arises only in case of consignee’s expenses.
The consignee expenses which are to be included in the value of closing stock are those expenses which are incurred till the goods reach the warehouse of the consignee.
Any other expenses incurred thereafter are ignored for purposes of closing stock ILLUSTRATION 143  A sent goods worth N10,000 to B and paid N1200 for packing and N800 for Insurance.
B took delivery of the goods and paid N2000 for freight N400 for cartage and unloading N600 fwoarr e house rent, N400 as selling expenses and N800 Insurance.
B sold three fourth of the goods for N1800.
Required Calculate the value of closing stock EXERCISE: On Jan, 1980 Olufemi Consigned 180 packs of Lux Soap to Adewale costing N25 each.
Olufemi paid the following expense bills on the consignment transport service, N130, insurance, N150.
After the voyage, it was ascertained that 5 packs were lost in transit for which he received a compensation from the insurer on Jan. 15.
As at 31st Jan., the expenses insurance incurred by Adewale include: import duty N100; selling expenses, N90, storage N80, where house wages N45.
He had sold 160 pack at N32 before he fell sick after recovery, he resumed transactions on Feb by Feb 20, he sold everything at N35 per pack.
Incurring selling expenses, N20 commission of 5% was agreed on sale (Round the figures up to the nearest naira) Required Calculate the value of unsold stock at 31st January 1980.
4.0 CONCLUSION Sometimes the consignee is not able to sell all goods consigned to him.
He is left with some unsold stock, the cost of which must be shown on the credit side of the consignment Account before calculating the profit on consignment.
The cost of unsold stock shall include proportionate amount of non-recurring expenses.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit you have learned about the valuation of non sold stock in order to calculate the true profit or loss on consignment and that the unsold stock should be valued and accounted for.
You also learned about the expenses that are included in the calculation of closing stock such as carriage and freight, clearing charges, loading charges etc and expenses which are not considered in the calculation of closing stock like discount, bad debt, selling and distribution expenses etc.
The accounting treatment of unsold stock is also covered in this unit.

2.0 OBJECTIES After studying this Unit you should be able to: • Compute the value of Unsold Stock • Record the Unsold Stock in the book of the Consignor 3.1 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF UNSOLD STOCK Since the value of Unsold Stock affects the profit or loss on any consignment, its valuation and recording in the books of consignor is very import.
It is shown on the Credit side of consignment Account for which the following journal entry will be passed.
Consignment Stock A/C DR To Consignment A/C (Being the value of closing stock) The consignee, however, will not pass any entry for the closing stock, it is because he is not the owner of the goods and does not pass any entry even when he receives or returns the goods.
3.2 WORKING NOTES • Closing Stock Valuation Number of closing Units X Cost Price Per Unit + Non – recurring Expenses X Closing Stock Units No of Units Consigned (Non-recurring Expenses include all the expenses of Consignor and clearing charges paid by the Consignee) 146  • Goods Returned to the Consignor: The goods returned are to be valued at Cost Price only.
They should not include any other expenses.
However, all the expenses incurred by the consignee to return the goods should be considered as the expenses on that Consignment.
So the consignment Account is debited and the Consignee’s Account Credited with the amount of expenses incurred on returns.

UNIT 27 CONSIGNMENT ACCOUNT IV (LOSS OF GOODS) Table Of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Normal Loss 3.2 Abnormal Loss 3.2.1 Effect Of Abnomal Loss On Valuation Of Closing Stock 1.3 Where Normal And Abnormal Losses Occur Simultaneously 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further Readings 7.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION In this unit you will learn about the treatment of normal and abnormal losses which may take place in transit or in the warehouse of the consignee and their impact on valuation of stock and the profit on consignment.
Under consignment arrangement, when goods are transferred from one place to another, there is a possibility of loss in transit.
The loss can also take place in the warehouse of the consignee.
The 150  loss may occur due to factors like evaporation, leakage, mishandling e.t.c.
or due to some accident or theft.
Such losses can be broadly divided into two types – normal and abnormal losses.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: o Explain the Nature of normal and abnormal losses o Computer the value of unsold goods in case of normal loss o Explain the treatment of normal and abnormal losses of goods and their impact on profit.
3.1 NORMAL LOSS Let us discuss the exact nature of this loss and its accounting treatment, normal loss is a loss which is due to the inherent nature of the goods consigned.
It may arise in the process of loading and unloading of goods, breaking of bulk piece into smaller ones, weighing or due to evaporation, processing etc.
for example while loading or unloading or weighing coal, some part is bound to fall down in powdered form.
Similarly the petroleum products are bound to loose weight due to evaporation or leakage.
This type of loss is unavoidable.
It can be reduced to some extent but cannot be eliminated altogether since this loss occurs in the ordinary course of business and as on account of inner characteristics of the goods, it is called a normal loss.
Normal loss is not shown separately in the books of accounts.
The cost of normal loss is spread over the remaining units, thereby increasing the cost par unit of the goods.
For example 10,000 tons of coal is sent on consignment costing N100 each.
The normal wastage is 2% i.e.
200 tons.
Let us see how normal loss leads to an inflated cost price per unit.
Total cost of 10,000 = N1,000000 (10,000 x 100) Total Units = 10,000 tons Normal loss = 200 tons Remaining Units = 9,800 tons N1,000000 will no be the cost of (9,800) tons as the cost of normal loss is borne by the remaining units.
The cost per unit will therefore be 1,000000 = N102.04 9,800 Approximately.
As stated earlier, no separate entry is passed for the normal loss.
The effect of this is reflected in the valuation of closing stick only.
If the consignee is able to sell all the goods so that there is no stock left unsold, the question of normal loss becomes irrelevant.
The problem arises only when some goods are left unsold with the consignee, In that case we shall first calculate the inflated cost per unit as explained above and then the closing stock shall be valued by multiplying the number of units in Stock with the inflated cost per unit.
The value of closing stock can also be computed directly (without calculating the inflated cost per unit) with the help of the following formula.
Total cost of Goods consigned x Unsold Units Remaining Units Remaining Units = Total consigned – Normal loss Unsold = Remaining Unit - Unit Sold.
151  3.2 ABNORMAL LOSS The loss which occurs due to negligence, inefficiency or some accident is treated as abnormal loss.
For example loss of goods due to fire, floods, earth quakes, riots, war theft etc.
such a loss does not occur on account of inherent nature of the product but on account of the operation of certain external forces.
Abnormal loss is calculated in the same manner as the value of closing stock.
In other words, in order to calculate the abnormal loss all the proportionate non-recurring expenses incurred up to the point of loss are also added to the cost of abnormal loss units.
The formula for calculation of abnormal loss is as follows: Cost of Abnormal Loss Units = No of Abnormal Loss Units X Cost Per Unit + Non – recurring Expenses up to the point of loss X No of Abnormal Loss Units No of Units Consigned Since the abnormal loss is not incidental to the consignment.
It should be shown separately in the books of accounts.
The total abnormal loss is credited to the Consignment Account.
The following entry is passed in the books of the consignor.
Abnormal Loss A/C DR To consignment A/C Being loss on account of … Such an abnormal loss may be i) Uninsured ii) Partially Insured (iii)Fully Insured When the loss is uninsured: In case the abnormal loss is not insured with an insurcaonmcep a ny, the total amount of the loss is transferred to Profit & Loss Account by passing the following entry.
Profit & Loss A/C DR To Abnormal Loss A/C (Being Abnormal Loss transferred to P & L A/C) When the loss is partially insured: In case the abnormal loss is insured and the claimfo l lowing entry is passed.
Insurance Company’s A/C DR Profit & Loss A/C DR To Abnormal Loss A/C (Being partial claim admitted) Insurance company will be debited with the amount of claim admitted and only the balance amount (total loss minus the claim) is transferred to Profit and Loss Account.
When the loss is fully insured: In case the loss is fully insured and the total “Claim” is admitted by the Insurance company, the following entry will be passed.
Insurance Company’s A/C DR To Abnormal Loss A/C (Being claim fully admitted) 152  Nothing is transferred to the profit and Loss Account as the claim for the whole amount of loss had been admitted by the insurance company.
No loss is to be borne by the consignor.
3.2.1 EFFECT OF ABNORMAL LOSS ON VALUATION OF CLOSING STOCK: The value of closing stock is also effected in case of abnormal loss.
Abnormal loss may occur either in the warehouse of the consignee or in transit.
Let us see the effect of abnormal loss on the closing stock under both situations.
When the abnormal loss occurs in the warehouse of the consignee the valuation of closing stock is not affected because the expenses incurred after reaching the warehouse of the consignee are not to be taken into account for the purpose.
Hence, the normal formula will be followed for the valuation of closing stock.
You have learnt that when abnormal loss occurs in the warehouse of the consignee the closing stock valuation is not affected.
But it is not so when the abnormal loss occurs in transit.
The closing stock valuation is also affected due to abnormal loss in transit because some non-recurring expenses may be incurred after the loss has taken place.
Hence, when such loss occurs in transit, you will have to distinguish between the non-recurring expenses incurred before the loss and the non-recurring expenses incurred after the loss.
The non recurring expenses incurred before the loss relate to the total units.
Consigned whereas the non-recurring expenses incurred after the loss relate to the remaining units (total units minus abnormal loss units) only.
So, the expenses before the loss wpriollp o r tbioe n ately divided amongst the total units, whereas the expenses incurred after the loss will be proportionately divided amongst the remaining units.
3.3 WHERE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL LOSSES OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY In your earlier study, you learnt about the normal loss and the abnormal loss on the consignment.
But it is quite possible that both normal and abnormal losses occur simultaneously in connection with the same consignment.
In such a situation, the abnormal loss will be calculated in the same consignment.
In such a situation, the abnormal loss will be calculated in the same manner as discussed in section 3.2.
But, the valuation of closing stock needs special attention as the normal loss is also involved.
In order to calculate the value of closing stock the following procedure will be followed: i) Take the total lost of goods consigned and add all the non-recurring expenses incurred by the consignor as well as the consignee.
ii) Deduct the quantity and cost of abnormal loss from the total number of goods consigned and the cost as obtained in (i) above respectively iii) Deduct the quantity of normal loss from the quantity worked out in (ii) Above without making any adjustment in cost.
iv) Now you will be left with the cost of goods of the good units with the consignee.
Calculate cost per unit of these units by dividing the cost (remaining after deducting the cost of abnormal loss) by the number of good units.
v) Multiply the number of unsold units with the cost per unit obtained in (iv) above to arrive at the value of unsold stock 153  EXERCISES How will you treat abnormal loss if (a) Loss is fully Insured Loss is uninsured Loss is partly insured Define Normal Loss Explain Abnormal Loss 4.0 CONCLUSION When goods are consigned, it is possible that some are lost in transit or destroyed while it is lying in the consignee’s warehouse.
Such losses may occur either due to the inherent nature of goods or due to some accident.
The first is called normal loss and the second abnormal loss.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit you have learnt about Normal and abnormal loss.
The normal loss is not sahnoywwnh e re in the bills of account.
It simply inflates the cost per unit of goods consigned and therefore affects the revaluation of closing stock and the profit.
But the abnormal loss requires special treatment in the books of account of the consignor.
The cost of such loss is worked out in the same manner as the cost of unsold stock and credited to the consignment Account.
Any amount received from the insurance company must be subtracted from the abnormal loss before it is transferred to the profit and loss Account.

You know that the goods sent on consignment are recorded in consignment Account at cost price.
Sometimes, the consignor does not want to reveal the cost of goods to the consignee and , therefore, invoices the goods at a price which is higher than cost price.
Such price is know as invoice price.
In this unit you will learn about the concepts of invoice price and how to calculate the cost price and the invoice price.
2.0 OBJECTIVE 155  After studying this Unit you should be able to: • Explain the meaning of invoice price and the reasons for consigning goods at Invoice price.
• Compute cost price and invoice price in different situations.
3.1 CONCEPTS OF INVOICE PRICE In Unit 26 you learnt that when the consignor sends goods on consignment to the consignee, he records it in his books at cost and the same is reflected in the proforma invoice.
Sometimes, the consignor does not want the consignee to know the actual cost of goods sent to him, in that case he would consigne the goods at a price other than the cost price.
Such price would generally be higher than the cost.
It is called the invoice price in other words the invoice price is equal to the cost price plus a certain amount of profit.
Apart from the intension of not revealing the cost of goods to the consignee there are a number of other reasons why the consignor consignes the goods at invoice price.
These are : • i) The consignee will not be able to assess the profit earned on consignment and therefore may not demand a higher commission.
• ii) If the consignee knows about the actual cost of goods he may resort to some dishonest practices such buying goods for himself at a lower price and then selling them at a higher price in the market.
• iii) It would give a fair idea to the consignee of the minimum price at which he is to sell the goods.
You should know that invoice price is not the same thing as selling price.
The invoice price the price at which the consignor sends the goods to the consignee whereas the selling price is the price at which the consignee sells the goods to the customers.
Let us take an example in order to clearly understand the difference between the three prices i.e.
the cost price, the invoice price and the selling price.
Surpose Gopel consigns goods worth N15000 to his agent Ashok at an invoice price of N18,000.
Ashok sells the goods at N20,000.
In this example the cost price (CP) of the goods is N15,000, the invoice price (IP) of the goods is N18000 and the selling price (SP) of the goods N20,000.
You will observe that the IP is higher than CP whereas SP in higher than the CP as well as the IP, and that the SP and the IP are not same.
If however, the consignor directs the consignee to sell the goods at invoice price itself, then the SP and the IP will be the same.
3.2 CALCULATION OF COST PRICE AND INVOCIE PRICE You know the relationship between the invoice price (IP) the cost price (CP) and profit.
This can be expressed in the form of an equation as follows.
IP = CP + Profit With the help of the above equation, you can find out the missing figure i.e.
If any two figures are given the third one can be worked out for example, if the CP is given as 150 and the profit as N50, the invoice price will be IP = CP + Profit = 150 + 50 = N200 Similarly, if invoice price and profit are given as N200 and N50 respectively the cost price will be 156  IP = CP + Profit 200 = CP + 50 CP = 200 – 50 = N150 In the above examples the profit is given as an absolute figure.
But, in many cases the profit may be given in the form of a percentage either on cost price or on invoice price.
In that case, the calculation of missing price may become difficult of course, if the percentage of profit is based on the price the figure of which is given, you may not face much problem.
But if the percentage of profit is based on the price, the figure of which is not given, you may find it difficult to work out the profit and so also the missing price.
Let us take different situation where the profit is given in the form of a percentage and we have to work out the missing price.
These situations are: • 1) CP is given and profit is given as a percentage of CP, you have to work out IP.
• 2) CP is given and profit is given as a percentage of IP, you have to work out IP.
• 3) IP is given and profit is given as a percentage of IP, you have to work out CP.
• 4) IP is given and profit is given as a percentage of CP, you have to work out CP.
Let us take them one by one and find out the missing figure with the help of examples.
1.
CP is given and the profit is given as a percentage on CP.
Suppose the CP of a product is N200 which is invoiced at 20% profit on cost.
The IP will be calculated as follows: IP = CP + Profit IP = 200 = 20 x 200 100 1 IP = 200 + 40 IP = N240 2 .CP is given and the profit is given as percentage on IP.
Suppose CP of a product is N200 which is invoiced at 20% profit on IP, IP will be calculated as follows.
Let us assume that the IP is X IP = CP + Profit X = 200 + 20 x X 100 X = 200 + 20 X 100 X - 20 x = 200 100 1 0 0 x - 2 0 x = 200 100 80 x = 200 157  100 x = 200 x 100 = N250 80 So the IP is N250 and the Profit is N50 Now you can verify that the profit is 20% on invoice price.
Profit = 20 of IP 100 = 20 x 250 100 = N50 1.
IP is given and the profit is given as percentage of IP: Suppose the IP of a product is N500 and profit is 25% on IP.
The missing figure i.e.
the CP is worked out as follows; IP = CP + Profit 500 = CP + 25 X 500 500 = CP + 125 CP = 500 - 125 CP = N375 2.
IP is given and the profit is given as a percentage of CP: Suppose the IP is N600 and profit 20% on CP then CP will be calculated on follows: CP Let us assume CP to be X 1P = CP + 20 X 100 600 = 100X + 20X 100 600 = 120 X 100 X = 600 x 100 120 X = N500 So the CP is N500 and profit is N100.
Now you can verify that profit is 20% on cost.
158  Profit = 20 CP 100 x = 20 x 500 100 = N100 EXERCISE Indicate whether the following statements are True or False a) Consignor always consigns goods at invoice price b) Invoice price is always equal to selling price c) Consignor consigns the goods at invoice price to conceal the actual profit earned on consignment.
3.0 CONCLUSION Sometimes, in order to conceal the actual profit earned on consignment the consignor invoices the consignee at a price which is higher than the cost.
This is called invoice price.
The invoice price is equal to the cost price plus a certain amount of profit.
There are a number of reasons why the consignor consigned goods at invoice price these included concealment of profit to prevent the consignee from demanding higher commission etc.
4.0 SUMMARY In the Unit you have learnt about the concepts of invoice price i.e.
consignor consigning good to the consignee at a price higher than the cost, and the reasons why the consignor engage in the practice.
You also learnt about the calculation of cost price (CP) and invoice price (IP) with different variables.

In a situation where goods are sent to the consignee at invoice price, the entry for the goods sent on consignment is also recorded at the invoice price which would need an adjustment for loading at the time of computing the profit on consignment.
In this unit you will learn about items which involve loading and the adjustment for loading.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying his Unit you should be able to: • Explain the meaning of loading and pass necessary entries for its adjustment in Consignment Account.
• Prepare books of the consignor and the consignee based on Invoice price.
3.1 DEFINITION You know that the invoice price is obtained by adding a certain amount of profit to the cost price.
The amount of profit which is added to the cost in order to arrive at the invoice price is called loading.
In other words, loading is the difference between the invoice price and the cost price.
Loading = IP - CP For example, if the invoice prices is N10,000 and the cost price is N7500, the amount of loading will be Loading = IP - CP or Number of Units x (IP per Unit - CP per Unit) = 10000 - 7500 = N2500 If the invoice price or the cost price is given and the profit (loading) is given in the form of a percentage either on IP or CP, the loading can be worked out directly in the same manner as we worked out the IP or CP in the example under 3.2 in Unit 27.
3.2 ITEMS WHICH INVOLVE LOADING Loading is usually involved in all such items which are recorded at the invoice price in the consignment Account.
These items are: • Opening Stock • Goods sent on Consignment 162  • Goods Returned by the consignee • Closing Stock You have to compute the loading in respect of all the above items and make necessary adjustments in books of the consignor.
3.3 ADJUSTMENT OF LOADING You know the profit is the difference between selling price and cost price.
In cAocncsoigunntm pernetp a red earlier, the goods sent on consignment and the other related items were shown at cost.
Hence you had no problem in computing the profit.
But, when the goods on consignment and other related items are shown in the consignment account at Invoice price, it bneeccoesmsaersy to adjust the loading in the consignment Account so as to bring down the invoice price to the level of cost.
If such adjustment is not done, the profit figure will be in correct.
There is also a possibility that the consignment Account shown loss because the difference between the selling price and the invoice price is generally small which cannot cover all expenses.
Look at tihlleu s tration below and see the difference between the actual profit and the profit wadijtuhsotumt e nt.
The profit thus calculated will be the difference between sales and invoice price.
N Cost Price 15,000 Invoice Price 18,000 N3,000 Loading N20,000 Sale Price 20,000 Profit without Adjustment N5000 Actual profit From the above illustration it is clear that if no adjustment is made the profit will be N2,000 whereas the actual profit is N5000.
Therefore, in other to calculate the actual profit earned on any consignment all the items shown tot at invoice price are to brought down to the level of cost by adjusting the amount of loading on each of them.
Let us now take the items involving loading one by one and see how the necessary adjustments are made.
OPENING STOCK: Opening Stock is always shown on the debit side of consignment Account.
In case the stock is at invoice price, the difference between the Invoice price and the cost price of the stock will be shown on the credit side of the consignment Account by passing the following journal entry consignment A/C DR To Consignment A/C (Being the unloading on the goods send on consignment) Goods sent on Consignment: Goods sent on Consignment are shown on the debit of consignment Account.
In order to nullify the effect of invoice price, the difference between the invoice price and the cost price in respect of goods sent on consignment will be shown on the credit side of he consignment account by passing the following journal entry.
Goods sent on consignment A/C DR To Consignment A/C 163  (Being unloading of goods sent on consignment) Goods returned by the consignee: As the return of goods is shown on the credit of consignment Account, the adjustment for the loading will be made on the debit of Consignment Account with the help of the following journal entry Consignment A/C DR To Goods sent on consignment A/C (Being loading on goods returned) Closing Stock: Since Closing Stock is shown on the credit side of consignment Account, the adjustment for the loading will be made on the debit side with the help of the following journal entry.
Consignment A/C DR To Stock Reserve (Being unloading on Closing Stock) Thus you will observe that the adjustment entry for loading in the consignment Account made on the opposite side of the original entry.
For example the closing stock is shown on the credit side of the consignment Account.
Whereas its adjustment is shown on the debit side of the consignment Account.
This is how the effect of loading in consignment Account is centralized and the invoice price is brought down to the cost level.
You should remember that the adjustment for loading is to be made in the book of the consignor only.
The consignee does not record any entries for the items involving loading.
Therefore no adjustment is needed in his books.
ACCOUNTING FOR GOODS SENT AT INVOICE PRICE You have learnt about the concept of invoice price, the calculation of loading involved and adjustment entries to be passed in respect of all items involving loading.
As for the recording to transaction for goods consigned at invoice price, the treatment in books of the consignee is not affected at all.
Even in the books of the consignor all entries remain the same.
But, the amounts with which the four items involving loading (opening stock, goods sent on consignment, goods returned by the consignee, and closing stock) will reflect the invoice price.
Then, at the time of working out the profit on consignment, you will have to pass the necessary adjustment entries for the loading involved in respect of all the four items as stated earlier.
EXERCISE Indicate whether the following statement are True or False.
(i) Sending goods at invoice price shall result in less profit in the consignment Account, if no adjustment is made for the loading.
(ii) Loading on closing stock will be nullified by debiting stock reserve Account and crediting closing stock account.
(iii) All the entries of adjustment for loading are recorded in the books of consignee.
(iv) What is loading Name the items that involve loading 4.0 CONCLUSION 164  The difference between the invoices price IP and the lost price CP is called loading.
This affect four items shown in the consignment Account Viz; (i) goods sent on consignment (ii) greotoudrn e d by the consignee (iii) opening consignment stock and (iv) closing consignment stock.
In order to work out the actual profit, the effect of loading on all these items has to be nullified, otherwise the consignment account will show profit which is less than the profit actually earned.
5.0 SUMMARY: Loading can be found out by subtracting CP from IP, the calculation of loading is simple when both CP and IP are given.
But it needs special attention when the loading is given as a percentage of CP or IP and only the figure of IP or CP is given.
In such a situation, the formula IP = CP + P is used for the calculation of loading or the cost price, invoice price which ever is not given.
For the adjustment of loading involved in different items, we have to pass the necessary journal entries in the books of the consignor.
However, the books of the consignee are not affected by loading because his books do not include any entry in respect of the four items involved.

165  UNIT 30 ROYALTIES ACCOUNTS 1 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objective 3.1 Types Of Royalties 3.2 Accounting Treatment For Royalties 3.3 Explanatory Note 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Further Readings 7.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 1.0 INTRODUCTION In the last unit i.e unit 29 you learnt and concluded Bill of exchange and its accounting treatment.
In this unit you will study the Royalties accounts.
Simply put, the term royalty is defined as the payment to a person/organization for the use of asset, right or privilege belonging to such a person/organization.
2.0 OBJECTIVE After studying this unit you should be able to: 166  • Explain royalties • Identify various types of royalties • Record transactions relating to royalties account i.e.
accounting treatment for royalties.
3.0 TYPES OF ROYALTIES The major types of royalties include mining royalty, patent royalty and copy right royalty.
• Mining Royalty: Payment for an extraction of minerals from the ground.
• Patent Royalty: Payment for the use of patent right • Copy Right Royalty: Payment made by a publisher of a book to another The royalty may take the form of fined amount per unit of output produced.
(Though this is very rare).
The common form is that a certain minimum amount (called minimum rent) is payable per annum even if the actual amount for the use of right or asset is lesser than the minimum rent established.
But if the use of the asset results in higher value of royalty payable, the higher value will be considered.
However, in a situation where the minimum amount is paid despite the low activities that results in an actual amount of royalty lesser than the minimum set, the excess of the minimum over and above the actual amount is technically called short workings.
It should be understood that the agreement between the owner and the user of a right may provide that the short workings could be recouped in the following year(s).
This is to reduce the royalty payable where the activities result in royalty being in excess of the minimum rent in the subsequent periods as a way of setting off part or all the short workings that might arise in the previous periods.
Sometimes a time limit may be set for the recoupability of the short workings so that when the time given (say three years) elapses, the short-workings will no longer be recoupable.
Hence it will be regarded as a loss transferable to the profit and loss account of the year in which the short workings breeccooumpea b le.
It is pertinent to note that royalty, being an expense traceable to the number of units produced, is a direct expense and so, it is transferred to the debit side of the operating or manufacturing account as applicable.
It should also be noted that at the end of an operational period, the balance of recoupable short workings will appear in the balance sheet as a current asset item.
3.2 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR ROYALTIES The accounting treatment for a royalty is as follows: • When the royalty becomes payable, Debit Royalty A/C ] with the amount of Credit minimum Rent A/C ] the royalty payable • When the short workings occur; Debit short workings A/C with the amount of short workings Credit Minimum Rent A/C that occur • To make account for the landlord, Debit minimum Rent A/C with the minimum rent or actual royalty Credit Landlords A/C payable (which ever is higher) • When the Land lord is paid, 167  Debit Lands A/C with the actual amount paid Credit Cash/Bank A/C • When the Short workings are recouped Debit Minimum Rent A/C with the amount at Credit short workings A/C short workings recouped.
• When the short workings become recoupable Debit profit and Loss A/C with the amount of short workings regarded Credit Short workings A/C irrecoupable • When the royalty payable is transferred to the operating/manufacturing A/C Debit Operating/Manufacturing A/C with the amount of the royalty Credit Royalty A/C payable transferred ILLUSTRATION International Quarry Limited Obtained a lease of land from Abula State Government (A.S.G) on January 1, 1988.

In this unit you will learn about sub-lease and the accounting treatment under sub-lease.
Sometimes, a lessee may be given a privilege to sub-lease part of the right to somebody sub-lease.
In this case, the accounting treatment for royalties of the sub-lease requires a modification.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit you should be able to: • Explain sub-lease and its modification • Record the accounting transaction i.e.
accounting treatment under sub-lease.
3.0 SUB-LEASE For clarity sake, the royalties in respect of lease will be called royalties payable while that in respect of sub-lease will be called royalties receivable.
The short workings in respect of the lease will be called short working recoverable while called short workings allowable or rsouyspaletnys e .
Similarly, minimum rent in respect of the lease will be called minimum rent payable and that in respect of the sub-lease will be called minimum rent receivable.
If on the order hand the sub-lease rate is higher than the lease rate the excess must be transferred to the credit side of the Profit and loss account as profit.
Generally, it will be unreasonable for a sub-lease to be at the a rate lower than the lease rate.
Rather, it is usually higher or maintained at the same rates.
If the royalties payable and royalties receivable are at the same rate, the royalties receivable will be transferred to royalty payable 174  account at the end of the period so that the net royalties payable will be transferred toop e rtahtein g account.
