.8 MODULE 1: THE NATURE AND TYPOLOGIES OF ORGANISATIONS 15 UNIT 1 –Clarification of concepts and Typologies of organisations 1.0-Introduction: There are basically two types of organisations; the public organisation and the private organisation.
These two are similar in their modes of operation, though distinct in terms of ownership.
Both organisations have legal charter, capital stock and board of Directors as well as management body which is responsible to the board.
They both provide goods and services to the public on a commercial basis.
However, the private organisations are absolutely profit oriented and are owned by private individuals who are not officials of the government, even though the government provides for its regulatory framework.
The public organisations on the other hand are established by specific statutes for the provision of certain social and welfare services.
Public Organisations in some instances provide commercial services.
Its powers, duties and matters relating to finance and personnel are usually contained in the legislative acts, decrees (Decrees were most popular during militar y regimes) or edicts which establishes them.
(Oyediran et-al.2005: pg 119).
Both the private and public organisations are explained in details below with specific emphasis on the detailed classification, the scope and organisational structure of these organisations.
2.0-Aims and Objectives The aim and objective of this unit is to introduce and expose you to the general understanding of organisations: Public and Private.
It is believed that at the end of this unit, you will be able to; -Define both public and private organisations and the basis of their typology -Know the importance of organisations -Explain in details the characteristics of organisations -Discuss the problems facing organisations and ways of solving them 3.0-Main Content 3.1-Definition of Organisation Organisation can be defined as the act of putting into systematic relationship all those elements and activities essential for the satisfaction of purpose.
According to Milwand G.E “It is the process of dividing work into convenient task or duties, of grouping such duties in the form of posts, delegating authority to each post, and appointing qualified staff to be responsible that the work is carried out”.
(ARBITRAGE, 2009) Bretch defines organisation as involving the design of suitable structure by -explicit definition of roles, positions and jobs -Departmentation that groups positions into specialised activities -Hierarchical authority relationships to cement the departments into an orderly rational structure with channels for delegation of authority from the top to the bottom of the organisation.
Argyris on the other hand defines organisations as “intricate human strategies designed to achieve certain objectives.
This definition is closely related to that given by Simon as 16 “...Systems of behaviour designed to enable humans and their machines to accomplish goals, organisational goals must be a joint function of human characteristics and the nature of the task environment.
(G.A Cole; 1987) These varied definitions suggest that there is no universally acceptable or a superior definition or even a more preferred definition of organisation.
But one fact is quite clear, that it involves organising a social entity, which has the following features; a purpose, People and Structure.
The discussions on organisation in this unit cover the above mentioned three features which are key variables in both public and private organisations.
These variables are in constant interactions with; -The goals of the Organisation -The Technology/Skills available -The culture of the organisation (Its Values, beliefs.e.t.c) (Cole, 1987;pg 8) These variables interact with each other leading to a change.
It is important for you to understand that when these variables are successfully managed leading to a balance, the organisation becomes stable, when they are not managed successfully; it leads to instability and consequently unstable growth.
Self Assessment Exercise 1; In what ways do public organisations differ from private organisations?
3.2.
The Typologies of Organisations Typologies of Organisations can be based on the following;- 1-Typology based on Membership; these include Voluntary, Military and Philanthropic organisations.
It also includes Co-operation with stake holders, board of directors, managers and staff.
Family business made up of people related by blood or marriage.
2-Typologies based on Decision Making Strategy This typology of organisation is based on four decisional modes corresponding to four organisational structures developed by James Thompson and Arthur Toden to include; -When there is agreement on the objectives as well as on values in which decision is rational.
- When there is agreement on the objectives and values, the decisional model is judgemental i.e.
self-governing.
-When there is agreement on values, or on objectives, the decisional mode is compromise.
The organisation is a representative body i.e.
the national assembly.
-When there is no agreement on objectives or values, the decisional mode is inspirational.
This situation is characterised by absence of any formal organisation i.e.
a mob.
3-Typology based on societal Function This typology was developed by Talcot Parson to include the following functions 1-Organisations which perform adaptation function 2-Organisations which perform Achievement Function 3-Organisations which perform integration function 4-Organisations which perform latency function 4-Typology based on Prime beneficiary Organisations classified according to the beneficiaries of their major activities to include; 17  -Mutual benefit organisations -Business concerns in which owners are prime beneficiaries -Service organisations in which prime beneficiaries are the clients -Commonwealth organisations in which the prime beneficiaries are the public at large.
5-Typology base on Model of funding All the other typologies are useful in understanding the operations of modern organisation.
The implication of this is that once an organisation is funded either completely or in part by the government, the attitudes of the organisation and its member’s expectation of the public are different.
3.3.
The importance of organisations Organisations are important in the sense that they play an important role in grouping humans and machines together in a stable and flexible pattern to carry out their duties in the organisation.
Organisations do that through -Stating objectives -Analysing Jobs -Defining Jobs and Functions -Allocating Staff Based on Competence -Coordinating the organisational activities/Departments -Establishing Physical Conditions -Measuring Operational Effectiveness -Adjusting Organisational Structure to cope with environmental Changes -And Re-aligning Objectives.
Organisations are involved in all the activities that cover actual staffing, Job definition and selection, training and welfare activities applied in various fields to ensure that initial targets and objectives are realised.
This implies that for organisations to be successful and positive of it’s role, it has to remain focus and constantly striving to improve understanding and cooperation.
The successful integration of these processes to form an effective organisation as a whole depends upon a management(Public Administration) that is able to understand that no two people are the same in an organisation because each person possess a slightly different mental make-up that affects his/her view, that attitudes affect ones view of the organisational structure, that there is a wide range of reasons why individuals remain on the job, and that views affect the roles of individuals in organisations.
This is very important because if it is misunderstood by employees, it affects the entire functions of the organisation.
3.4.
The Basic Characteristics, Structure and Organisation of organisations Public organisations can best be grouped into two;-The civil service and the public corporations.
The civil service mainly concerned with the implementation of public policies.
The public corporations on the other hand are enterprise of government responsible for the provision of certain services but independent of direct legislative control.
It is very necessary for us to throw more light on certain features of public organisations and its operations before we move further.
18 Public organisations consist of certain basic features.
These basic characteristics were clearly identified by Oyediran et al (2005;pg 121) in their work “New Approach Government “to include the following; 1.
Public Organisations are State owned 2.
They are created by specific government Statutes which define their powers and relations with other governmental institutions 3.
They have a legal personality, i.e., they have a life of their own, can sue and be sued, hold property, enter into contracts, etc.
4.
In theory, public organisations are independently financed through their own revenue and loans.
5.
They are not subject to parliamentary financial scrutiny, such as that in which departments of government are subjected.
6.
Their employees are civil servants employed directly by government and subject to conditions determined by the government.
7.
Public organisations that are Corporations are usually administered by boards which are appointed by ministers.
These public organisations are controlled and managed by the government, Board of directors and management.
The government through the minister is responsible for the appointment of Board members and some senior members of the corporation spokesperson at the legistlature.The administrative control of the corporation rest with the Board’s chairman and members.
While management is responsible for effectively carr ying out the policy of the corporation.
Private organisations on the other hand are private non-governmental organisations, and are judged by their profit drive activities.
They are not often operated within the purview of accountabotiliy.But the Public organisations are constraints by their bounds to obtain public accountability The most important similarity between the two is the fact that both use human and material resources to achieve their objective.
And both of them are interested in socio- economic matters.
Note.
Although most public corporations are not set up primarily for profit, they are expected to find ways of self sustenance.
This is also a strategy to avoid over dependence on government.
Self Assessment Exercise 2; List and explain the basic characteristics of organisations.
3.5 Problems confronting Organisations 1-Integration.Which is how to integrate individual needs and organisational goals.
2-Social Influence.
The problem of distributions of power and sources of power and authority.
3-Collaboration.The problem of producing mechanisms for the control of conflict.
4-Adoption.The problem of responding appropriately to changes induced by the environment.
5-Revitalization.The problem of growth and decay.
6-Undue interference in their activities by the government of the day.
19 These problems confront both public and private organisations and can all be handled through the following ways;- 1-Organisations can achieve integration through Humanistic-Democratic ethos, understanding the personality of individuals and harmonising those needs with that of the organisation.
2-An absolute reliance on legal-rational power and the complete separation of management from the ownership of offices, as a means of suppressing negative and unintended effects of authority is the best method of handling social influence in organisations.
3-Collaboration can simply be achieved through the application of the rule of hierarchy and the rule of coordination in the resolution of conflicts.Professionalisation and specialisation as well as the promotion of interdependence is a step in the right direction.
4-Predictable task routine and adventitious ways of handling jobs helps in handling unanticipated consequences of environmental changes, thereby promoting adaptation.
5-Consatnt revisions of the entire organisational process, in terms of technologies, raw materials, man power, norms and values of society will help organisations to cope with the problems of revitalisation and decay.

Organisations as we have discussed can be classified into two broad categories; the private which are owned by individuals and the Public which are State owned.
These organisations are responsible for the realisation of organisational objectives and for adjusting organisational scope to cope with environmental challenges.
These functions are achievable because by nature they have certain levels of autonomy to enable them function effectively.

31 Unit 3.
T HE S CO PE OF PU B L IC A DMI N I ST R A T IO N 1.0 I nt r odu ct i on Public Administration serves as the ball bearings of government.
It is that part of the vehicle which must function with the minimum of friction if the goals of the state are to be achieved and realised.
It is not just about governmental regulations of individual and group conduct, protection, assistance and service that government provides, but Public administration activities fall into four broad categories;- -The protection of society as a whole.eg ,the police and fire protection, health care, national defence,education,safeguarding the environment, and conserving natural resources ;Promotional activities or assistance to particular economic and social groups e.g.
farmers, factory workers, businessmen, women and children in industry, the aged, and the unemployed; Proprietary activities where government owns and operates enterprises serving for the public e.g.
postal services, port facilities, municipal water, electric-power; Regulation of particular business or activities through such agencies as the inter-state commerce commission, the Federal Reserve board, the national labour relations board, and others.
(Polinaidu, 2005).
In this unit, we will explain in details the scope of public administration as there are varied opinions to it.
At the end of it all we would have understood fully where governmental activities start and stop.

The unit has been able to explain the characteristics of Public Administration as the non- political public bureaucracy operating in a political system, it is under the direction of political leadership, it is the monopoly of the state, government in action, the policy making unit, it is inter- disciplinary in theory, a practical discipline, an ongoing process and it differs significantly from private administration especially in its emphasis on public good.
Public Administration can be differentiated from the private administration on four main principles which include; Uniformity, external financial control, ministerial responsibility and managerial return.
Public Administration serves as the basis of government.
It is the administrative machinery of government right from the ancient empires, and covers such political ideology as capitalism and socialism.
Public Administration also serves as an instrument for implementing laws and policies, providing continuity when government change, provides a wide variety of services in the public interest, protects life and property,facilitate,promote and manage services and it is essentially for the development of civilisation.
We have been able to identify in this unit the major approaches to the study of public administration which include among other the Historical approach, Institutional approach, Legal Approach, behavioural Approach and its relationship with other subjects.
Though all these approaches have their limitations, but all the same, they generally help improve the functioning of government.
The unit concludes with a discussion on the Scope of Public Administration as the ball bearings of government.
As that body involved in the protection of society, and in advancing promotional activities of government and the assistance to groups, propriety activities and the regulation of particular businesses.

Public Organisations are created to deliver social services, make and implement policies and also to safeguard life and property among other functions.
These enormous responsilities require the use of power, authority and at time the use of force to carry them through.
And in other to make these organisations responsible to the society, accountability measures have been put in place to ensure that these organisations do not misuse the powers given to them in the discharge of their duties and also measures put in place to ensure that they function with the minimum level of friction.
The unit is also explains the legislative control through elected representatives, which is done through debates, motions, questions, budgetary control and parliamentary committees.
The Executive also control public organisations through policy making, budgetary system framing, recruitment and law making.
In order to ensure proper accountability, the unit also explains the judicial remedies for law suits against government officials to ensure that the citizen’s rights are safeguarded and that the rule of law is upheld even in the discharge of public responsibilities.

We were able to state clearly in this unit that the responsibility of office holders is to be accountable to the people in the discharge of responsibility.Varoius measures of 73 accountability have been devised by all democratic states of which we have used India majorly as our example and Nigeria sparingly.
This is because public accountability has become so central because of the ever increasing importance and functions of public administration in modern states.
The control of these public organosations comes in the form of; - legislative control, which is done through elected reperesentatives; Debates and discussions, which provide an opportunity to review government policies and their implementation; Resolutions/Motions adopted as control and check of abuse of office; Questions, which is the most contentious means of vocal control of representatives; Budgetry control, where budget proposals are extensively debated before they are voted upon.
Public accounts are examined by the public accounts committees to suggest any amendment, correcteness and economic aquracy among others.
Public officers and individuals can also seek redress whenever there is prejudice to the rights of such persons due to lack of jurisdiction, payment error of law and facts.
Redress can also be sought in situations which range from errors of law, abuse of authority and negligence.
It is important that this unit mention and explain the remedies available to redress some of these administrative lapses to include:-Habeas corpus, which is meant to provide immediate relief from arbitrary confinement or restrain.Mandamus,which is meant to compel public officials to perform an official duty which they fail to perfom;Prohibition,is issued to prevent a lower court not to exercise its powers of authority over a matter by a higher court; Certiorari is meant to order an inferior court to transfer its records of proceedings of a case to a higher court to determine its legality , and Quo Warranto is issued by a supreme court to inquire into the legality of claims.
However, these remedies are limited by the fact that, it is not all administrative actions that are subject to judicial control and the judiciary can only intervene on a matter only upon the request by of the injured parties.

In this unit, we have been able to successfully explain the entire process of public accountability and control of public offices as a means of safeguarding against the misuse of power and abuse of public authority, which arises out of the ever-increasing functions and importance of public administration in the development of society.
These control range from legislative control; which include debates and discussions, Resolutions and motionsd, questions, budgetry control and parliamentary committees.
This legislative though effective is limited by the fact that it neither has the time nor expertise to effectively control all the spheres of administration.
We also discussed the executive control of public administration which lies with the minster, who are responsible for the control of their ministries or departments.Thius is so because the policies made by the chief executive is implemented by the civil servants.
This executive control is exercised through political directions by the minister.
It is also exercised through approval of budgets and recruitments.
74 Judicial control plays an important role in upholding the sanctity of the constitution and protecting the rights and liberties of the people.
This control is exercised when there is lack of jurisdiction, errors in law, errors in fact finding, procedure and abuse of authorities.
There are however a range of remedies available for redress in case the control measures do not perfectly fit in, these include; Habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari and Quo Warranto.These remedies are at times limited by a number of factors which include;-The fact that not all government actions are subject to judicial control and secondly the availability and willingness of affected parties to seek redress.

It is commonly held that the unplanned "anarchic" nature of society and capitalist production necessitates bureaucratic regulation to prevent economic and social chaos.
Thus the bureaucracy is merely the by-product of an administrative structure that separates the workers from the actual management of the economy.
Since the owners make the decisions, all others must ultimately take their orders from this small group.
Since that would be impracticable in an industrial economy, the problem must be handled by a division of responsibility which in turn entails layers of bureaucracy.
The government makes the decisions which are then filtered down the bureaucratic pyramid.
This means that the workers must wait to be told what to do by their immediate superiors, who in turn must wait for instructions from their superiors, and so on.
It is important to realize that these bureaucratic features are a product of capitalism itself, rather than the nature of large-scale production.
Where capitalist property relations prevail, it is futile to fight against bureaucrac.To change the situation it is necessary first of all to eliminate private ownership of the means of production.
Bureaucracy was the inevitable consequence of the development of property relations at a given stage in the division of labour and in economic integration.
Consequently, it is also inevitable that at some point there will be no further need for an administrative apparatus separated from society, because subjective and objective conditions will be ripe for direct self-administration.
The bureaucracy has come to be known as the public service in most countries of the world and in Nigeria in particular.
It has certain features that make for the attainment of organised goals and allot for the effective utilisation of human and material resources for the collective good of society and also for the attainment of common good.
The bureaucracy which has been associated to the works of Marx Weber in trying to explain the organised task can be carried out in society following laid down rules and regulations.
This will be the main concern of the unit under discussion and we will try as much as possible to explain also the origin of the Bureaucracy and its main characteristics.

The bureaucracy is in no doubt an organised form of administration with certain characteristics such as the formalisation of relationships, a system of rules, authority and hierarchy.
This hierarchical arrangement of offices encourages formalisation of routine activities, specialisation and precision.
The bureaucracy though the most practiced form of organisation has its own limitations.
For example, a system of determined rules and procedures which might offer predictability can also frustrate those who are ambitious and result oriented.
On the other hand, the strict adherence to procedures also exaggerates routine activities leading to time wastage and delays.
However the bureaucratic problems can be handled by encouraging innovations, participatory management and the little allowance for flexibility for the bureaus.

We have been able to identify in this chapter the merits of the bureaucracy.
These include formalisation of procedures, which helps to cope wastages; routinisation of work which lead to specialisation among others.
The unit also identified the limitations of the bureaucracy, particularly strict adherence to rules and procedures which can lead to frustration to those who are ambitious and result oriented.

108 The concept of people’s participation in administration has been widely proclaimed time and again.
This is so because the entire notion of democratic politics rest on the workability of active citizen’s involvement in the holding and sharing of power and responsibility of government and public office.
The system of citizen participation promotes liberty and equality, encourages the people’s voice, their concerns, and promotes the interest of the majority and to safeguard accountability and ventilation of public grievances.
The citizen’s participation can be formal or informal, direct or indirect, and it can take so many forms from policy formulation and policy evaluation all aimed at promoting good governance and speedy development.
There are certain problems that have inhibited the participation of citizens ranging from lack of awareness, poverty and general apathy of the people.
But most importantly, they can overcome these problems by electing their representatives at the local, state and national level, participate in enlightenment programmes, joining and actively participating in political parties and institutions.
Therefore the people themselves need adequate knowledge of administrative norms, genuine support for the public goals and positive evaluation of government efforts.
It is also important to beware that over the years these citizens’ efforts have been threatened by corruption, citizen’s ignorance and discrimination.
Thereby making the citizens to become what the leaders want thereby denying them the benefits of participation and development.

We have been able to discuss in this chapter the concept of people’s participation in administration as core to the promotion of development and as a means of ensuring accountability in governance.
The unit also explained the means of ensuring the participation of the citizens in administration either formal or informal.
It is quite clear from our explanation that the participation of the citizens is not without its problems, but most importantly the advantages of participation far outweighs the problems that have limited the effective utilisation of this means.
6.0Tutor Marked Assignment; -Identify and explain the means of citizen’s participation in Administration.
-Discuss the significance of people’s participation in the Administration of its country.

In a broad sense, public Administration refers to the art and science of managing governmental affairs.
It denotes the means, arrangements and processes by which policies, programmes, purposes and goals of governments are fulfilled.
Public Administration takes place at all levels of government- Local, National and International.
It is a body of officials who are concerned with the organization and functioning of governmental administration in a state that is, the civil service state.
The civil service designates the entire body or specialised part of the executive arm of government whose primary responsibility is the implementation of the policies and programmes of the government.
The employees of the government who carry out these functions, that is administrative and executive duties are called civil servants.
A British scholar defines them as those servants of the crown, other than holders of political or judicial offices, who are employed in the civil capacity and whose remuner ations is paid wholly and directly out of monies voted by parliament.

3.1 The evolution of the Civil Service in Nigeria The civil service in Nigeria is a colonial heritage of public administration.
During colonial rule, the upper echelon of the civil service was dominated by Europeans on who were concentrated executive, judicial and legislative powers.
What became a major attempt in establishing a central public service emanated from the acceptance of the Nigerianisation Report of 1st January,1949.Later a caretaker central Public Service Commission was constituted on 3rd May,1952 under the provision of Section 169 of the Nigeria Order-in- Control(Constitution) of 1951.
The Federal Public service (Civil service) was established on the 1st of April, 1954 through a provision under section 174 of the Nigeria Order-in-Council of 1954.
Thus, this could be regarded as the genesis of our present day civil service.
And with the evolution of the modern state and the adoption of the concept of separation of powers, the civil service emerged as an organ of the executive responsible for advising the executive on policy directions and the implementation of decisions.
-The civil service is thus in this light is suppose to assist the government in the formulation of policy by providing the necessary data.
-To implement the decisions, that is the approved policies of government without fear or favour -To ensure that when advising government, the civil servant sets out the wider and more enduring considerations against the exigencies of the moment so that the conveniences of today does not become the embarrassment of tomorrow.
Self Assessment Exercise 1; Explain the evolution of the civil service in Nigeria.
3.2 Definition and composition of the public service.
The public service refers to all organisations that exist as part of government machinery for implementing policy decisions and delivering services that are of value to citizens.
It is used to describe a service rendered by government institutions to the public for the promotion of the common good.
It is a mandatory institution of the state under the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as outlined in chapter VI of the Constitution under the title: Executive, Part 1(D) and part II (C) which provides for a public service at the Federal and state levels of government.
The public service in Nigeria comprises the following: 119 1-The civil service often referred to as the core service consisting of line ministries and extra-ministerial agencies.
2-The public bureaucracy, or the enlarged public service, made up of the following: a) Services of the state and national assemblies b) The judiciary c) The armed forces d) The police and other security agencies e) Paramilitary services (immigration, customs, prisons, etc) f)parastatals and agencies-including social service, commercially-oriented agencies,regulatotry agencies, educational institutions, research institutions.
(Public Service Reforms,1999) 3.3 The structure of the civil service in Nigeria during the colonial era.
The structure of the civil service during the colonial; era was that of a central Agency responsible for managing various governments functions into departments i.e.
Public works,Treasury,Trade,e.t.c.The major purpose of government then was the provision of security and limited social services.
These were provided timely and efficiently.
However, with the attainment of political independence in 1960 and the eventual transition into as Republic in 1963,these departments transformed into ministries and Ex-tra Ministerial Establishments with greater responsiibities.This was the position until 1967 when the Nigerian civil War commenced.
With the end of the Civil war in 1970, there emerged the period of the oil boom that gave Nigeria sudden wealth through multiple foreign exchange earnings on the sales of crude oil.
Nigeria also was confronted with the problem of rehabilitating its war devastated economy.
In an attempt to do this, the Policy of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Reconciliation was introduced.
This meant; -Increase in government responsibilities -Increase involvement of government in the provision of social and economic services -Diversification, expansion and erection of new infrastructures, such as roads, schools, hospitals, industries and housing, e.t.c.
This resulted in the expansion of government Ministries and the creation of so many extra- Ministerial Establishments, some of which became branded parastatals.These parastatals were largely the creation of the military and they were often made through Decrees that granted them enormous autonomy in the management of their day to day functions.
Consequently, by 1999 when the last military regime left office, the Federal Public Service consisted of about 26 Ministries and over 400 Extra-Ministerial Departments and Parastatals.They were divided into two categories ;The civil Service with a workforce of about 273,392,while the Extra-Ministerial Departments/Par astatals had a work force of about 1.8 million.
The public service then had a total workforce of about 1,433,392 Public Servants, servicing a growing population of 120 million people up-till the year 2003, when its recent reforms commenced.
Only 26% of these workforces were civil servants under the control of the Federal Civil Service Commission.
120 Since then the population of the civil servants increased and the number of ministries and parastatals grew considerably.
A peep into the distribution of these government Agencies called parastatals indicated that the Federal Ministry of Health had 77 of them, Federal Ministry of Science and Technology had 40, Federal Ministry of Education had 41,Federal Ministry of Agriculture had 34,while the Federal Ministry of Power and Steel had 27 to mention a few.
The result of this growth reveals some facts, that;- 1-Managing these parastatals had become a problem 2-Most of them were either over-bloated, or not properly staffed 3-There was duplication in the mandate/Functions 4-They were unable to provide timely and efficient services for which they were set up 5-They became a major source of waste of public funds 6-They became cesspit of corruption, resulting in the over-bloating of contracts, loss of public confidence and great out cry for something to be done urgently.
Self Assessment exercise 2; What are the major challenges that came with the growth and expansion of the civil service?
3.4 Characteristics of the Nigerian Civil Service The civil servants are servants of the government.
They are found in various ministries of government, headed by political heads called ministers or commissioners.
They are responsible for planning, advising on and implementing polices not for making them.
The term civil servant cover the official’s of local government and public cooporations.The definition also excludes holders of political office, ministers, and holders of judicial office and members of the armed forces.
A general term which embraces the officials in both the civil service and those in the other government services is public servants.
Members of the civil service recognise themselves as belonging to a unified service.
A number of factors contribute to this idea of unification.
These are outlined below: 1.
Recruitment follows similar line throughout the administration and is governed by a single body-the civil service commission.
2.
General control is exercised by the treasury.
This is done through its supervision of the recruitment, promotion and training of civil servants.
The treasury also keeps the records of all members of the administrative class.
3.
Arrangements are made by the cabinet office for the coordination of the activities of the ministries.
4.
The idea of a single civil service is fostered by the establishment of common professional and social institutions.
Furthermore, the civil servants are encouraged to join their staff associations, which all have professional, cultural and recreational features.
These are: a) Permanence b) Neutrality c) Anonymity and d) Impartiality.
121  Permanence Civil servants are career government employees, rated and employed under a merit system in which the principle of Federal character is also applied.
Their jobs are tenured, that is permanent, in contrast to those of political appointees which start and end with the individual administrations i.e.
elected political office holders.
The continuity of the civil servants job helps administration in carrying out government policies effectively.
Governments come and go, but the civil service remains.
Neutrality This is the basic concept underlying the civil service system.
The philosophy is that civil servants are politically neutral and will remain loyal and dedicated to the ruling party of government of the day.
They are expected to perform their duties without showing favour or sympathy to any party or group.
Civil servants are not allowed to engage in partisan politics.
Although they may belong to political parties and vote at elections as citizens demonstrating their civic rights, but their views should not affect the loyalty with which they serve governments of the day.
Those who are interested in partisan politics are required by the civil service rules to resign their appointments from the service.
Such political neutrality is necessary to retain public confidence in the administration and to prevent the victimisation of known political opponents.
When there is a change of government, no civil servant is dismissed merely because his political views are contrary to those of the new government.
Impartiality This refers to the principle that the civil servants are expected to serve all parties fairly, showing no bias or favour to any particular groups or party.
To ensure that no doubts is cast upon their impartiality, civil servants may not write or speak on controversial public issues.
Under the official Secrets Act information gained by civil servants in the course of their duty must not be divulged.
Anonymity Civil servants are not held responsible in relation to the discharge of their duties.
They do not receive any praise or blame for any good or defective policy.
Ministers are constitutionally responsible to the presidency for all the acts of the officials of their departments done in the course of their duties.
In some cases, ministers may be forced to resign their appointments for any defective policy designed by civil servants under them.
It is the convention that no mention should be made in the House of Representatives, of a minister’s permanent subordinates (That is, the civil servants), either by way of praise or of criticism.
3.5a Functions of the Civil Service 1-The civil service assist in the formulation of policy.
The political head .i.e.
the minister or commissioner looks to his career officials to provide them with expert technical and administrative advice.
While the minister is ultimately responsible to the cabinet and legislature for his/her departments, they must depend considerably on the experience and wisdom of senior civil servants i.e.
the permanent secretary, directors, deputy directors and assistant directors.
2-The civil servants are in charge of the administrative machine.
They give the necessary directives which put the decisions of government into effect.
Once 122 government policies are known, the higher civil servants ensure that the policies are implemented.

3.6 Measuring the performance of Public Service The Performance of the civil service can be measured through the established criteria on global minimum standard for measuring the performance of state bureaucracies and capacities.
These are:- 123 -Demonstrable ability and capacity to deliver goods and services to the people of Nigeria in cost- effective, efficient and timely manner, -Existence of state institutions that are guided by high ideals of the public service in carrying out their mandates in a fair, equitable, transparent and accountable manner, -Perception by the citizens that the state institutions are respectful of citizens rights, interest and generally demonstrate respect for the laws of the land.
-The legitimate use of physical force and coercion, -Safe and secured environment that allow citizens to carry out their daily routines without fear, encumbrances and hindrances other than those imposed by law, -General perception that justice is dispensed justly, fairly, equitably and in a very timely manner -And legitimate enforcement of laws.
Rules and regulations that is not selective or perceived to be tainted with bias.
3.7 The role of the civil service in national development include in the areas of;- -Strict obedience to the rule of law and due process.
-Political and economic stability of the country -Sustenance and integration of our rich cultures -Maturity Capital and financial Markets -Cooperate governance -Availability of core competence -Favourable investment climate The civil service in the word of Amb Ahmed Al-Gazali chairman of the civil service commission in 2007, said Nigeria has taken a lot of giant strides in the development of the country, while apportioning failures where necessary.
These moves are as follows; 1-The sustenance of the Nigerian nation as an entity, as well as it’s unity in diversity, is a bond which the civil service nurtured, despite deep ethnic and cultural diversities of the component units.
2-Through the instrumentality of the civil service bureaucracy, the colonial creation known as Nigeria in 1914,became transformed to the present 36 states structure of a federal system of government in response to the yearnings and aspirations of the multi-ethnic groups that constitute the Nigerian State.
3-During the colonial era and immediately before Nigeria independence in 1960, the purpose of the service was the provision of governance for revenue collection, provition of security and limited social services, such as health care, education, sanitation and pipe born water in selected cities of the country, these was provided by the public works department, health department, education department e.t.c to a limited population who then constituted the elites.
4-With the attainment of independence and the emergence of oil boom in the 1970’s,the civil service was able to provide expansion in its scope of activities in the areas of construction of new infrastructures,education,health,housing,agriculture,other social services and increase in national income, as well as per capita income.

He explained further that the civil service was able to perform these functions effectively because;- -The civil servants were assured of the fact that their political bosses would not get at them for taking the right and correct actions that might not be politically correct or palatable to the powers that be.
-In Britain for example, this type of protection for the civil servant was guaranteed with the institution of public service commission which was introduced in the country in 1853, but in the United States of America, the political executive controlled the power of recruitment, promotion and discipline in the public service.
The system which emerged in the United States became known as the “Spoils or patronage” system as opposed to the “merit system” in practice in Britain of, which we inherited at independence.

The civil service during the colonial era was strictly driven by the observance of efficient and dynamic rules and regulation to enable it perform it’s primary responsibility; which is the protection of life and security.
Its evolution can be traced to the Nigerianisation report of 1st Jan, 1949 to the order-in-council of 1954.
As an organ of the executive, it is responsible for advising the executive on policy directions and implementations.
In Nigeria it comprises of the public bureaucracy, parastatals and agencies.
The scope of the civil service in Nigeria increased significantly with the oil boom of 1970’s to include the provision of social services, which led to the establishment of several departments and parastatals that have to cope with the expansion and increased responsibility.
There are certain features of the civil service which have come to define it’s existence; Permanence; Neutrality; Anonymity and Impartiality.
These features aid in the civil service in the performance of its functions particularly in the modern world; quasi legislative functions and public orientation functions.
But most importantly, their performance can be measured in terms of ideals, perceptions, observance of laws and due process.

We have been able to look at the origin of the public service in Nigeria and their functions from the colonial era to the present day.
The civil service in the past performed very limited functions in terms of providing security and safety of life.
But with the oil boom of the 1970’s, it’s functions enlarged to include the provision of social services and quasi-judicial functions.

Various countries reform their civil service from time to time in line with particular needs of such countries.
It is therefore, difficult to generalise about reforms in civil services.
Africans 127 have demonstrated a great passion for revising and reorganising the structural bases for their governments.
This has been brought t about by the natural desire to render government more efficient and also accommodate the new services expected by the public.
Demand for these change have been promulgated under the title of reforms and in many instances the need for reforms have been supported by logic and practical needs.
The problem at hand is if these reforms have resulted into the anticipated benefits.
Note; The willingness to engage continually in experimentation in this field is evidence of ongoing operational inefficiencies and a faith that more suitable combinations may one day be found.
However, the mere legality or constitutionality of administrative action does not guarantee acceptability by the public.
We shall, therefore, limit ourselves to the 1988 reforms of the civil service in Nigeria.
This is because Nigeria had it’s major civil service reform referred to as the Dotun Philips Civil Service Review Panel in that year, though the committee for the review was set up in 1985 by the Federal government.
We shall make further attempts to itemise other reforms in terms of their contents for comparism purposes.

3.1 Conceptual definition of the Civil Service Reforms Reforms connote a deliberate and planned change.
It refers to any intervention which is aimed at producing fundamental change in the public service in it’s conduct and operation.
Examples of such interventions are administrative actions.
While they may produce short term quantitative improvements, public service reform is a systematic intervention aimed at improving the structure, operations, systems and procedures of the public service to enable its transformation as a multi-faceted agent of change, and as in our case Nigeria, as a veritable instrument of national cohesion and socio-economic development.
Reform is neither a quick fix nor a random injection of solutions.
Reform is a sustained process that is people-focused based on the realisation that while it’s target is the people, it’s tool for achieving the desired change is also the people, an aspect of good governance we talked about earlier.
3.2 The principle underlying the public service reform.
The principle underlying past and ongoing reforms of the public service are that: 1-The Nigerian Public Service is crucial but deficient; 2-The public service faces enormous problems and challenges which must be addressed; 3-A reformed service is key to meeting the development challenges of the 21st century; 128 4-Nigeria’s dream of a better future can only be realised by modernising the machinery of government-the public service; 5-Reform provides the platform for applying a combination of strategies and approaches to resolve the crisis of governance and undevelopment.
6-It is aimed at reinvigorating the public service and revitalising it.
7-The need to halt the erosion of public confidence in government and fulfil the heightened expectations of the citizenry in the delivery of democratic dividends.
8-Pressures arising from regional and global development initiatives.
9-Pressures from international development partners for reforms as conditionality for wining their support and for access to their grants.
10-Emergence of civil societies exerting additional pressures on government to adhere to tenets of good governance.
Self Assessment exercise 1; what are the major principles underlying the public service reforms?
3.3 Chronology of Administrative Reforms to Re-invigorate the Public Service.
Successive administrations in Nigeria instituted various administrative reviews and reforms to reinvigorate the public service, some of which predated Nigeria’s independence.
From 1945 till date, the initiatives range from installing more appropriate structures and conditions of service to issues of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the service and lately ensuring service delivery improvements.
The salient features of each initiative are listed below: 1-Tudor Davis Commission, 1945; -Reviewed wages and general conditions of service.
2-Harragin Salary Review Com mission, 1946; -Reviewed wages and general conditions of service; and -Divided the civil service into senior and junior service (2 distinct compartments) 3-Gorsuch Commission, 1951; -Reviewed Remunerations and structure of the service, noted absence of viable middle category and created 5 main grades.
4-Hewn Committee, 1959; -Proposed integration of Ministries and Departments -Defined the roles and functions of Permanent Secretaries 5-Mbanefo Salaries and Wages Commission, 1959; 129 -Reviewed Salaries and Wages.
6-Morgan commission, 1963; -Reviewed salaries/wages of junior staff of federal government and private establishments -Introduced for the first time the minimum wage in Nigeria on geographical basis.
7-Elwood Grading Team , 1966; -Examines anomalies in the grading of the posts to proposed uniform salaries for officers performing identical duties.
8-Adebo Salaries/Wages Commission, 1971; -Proposed establishment of a public serviced review commission to examine: the role of the public service commission; structure of the civil service; conditions of service and training agreements.
9-Udoji Comm ission.1972; -Focused on the issue of increasing efficiency and effectiveness within the context of meeting the challenges of a development oriented society; -Introduce a new conception of management which is results oriented, concentrating attention and resources on identified priority action; -Introduced open Reporting System for performance evaluation; -Established a unified Grading and Salary Structure covering all post in the service; and -created a Unified senior Management Group for Administrative and professional Cadres for central management of career.
-Recommended a new single public service staffed and led by professionals and officers possessing the requisite knowledge and skills who can apply the acquired knowledge and skills in establishing goals and achieving targets.
-Underscored the need for every public service manager to be trained in project management, management by objective and programme budgeting.
-Recommended the adoption of project management as a tool for interminsterial task execution for broadening of skills and competences and ensuring better integration of government services.
-Recommended more delegation of human resource management functions to ministries, Departments and Agencies.
-Recommended decentralisation of machinery for staff consultation and negotiation.
-Recommended speedy treatment of disciplinary cases arising in the face of complicated disciplinary procedures and canvassed for the recognition of civil service.
-Recommended the institution of an ombudsman at the federal and state levels for reviewing administrative decisions which are considered unjust.
130 Self Assessment Exercise 2; What are the major components of the Udoji’s Reform of 1972?
10- The Dotun Philips 1988 Civil service reform s The element of the 1988 civil service reforms are;- 1-The minister not the permanent secretary, becomes the chief executive and accounting officer of his ministry.
If there were anything suspicious about payments to be made by the minister as the chief accounting officer, the auditor general was empowered to alert the president to warn the minster about the possible misappropriation for which the minister would be liable or responsible.
This was to ensure proper accountability.
2-The permanent secretary was now called Director- general and his appointment was entirely political i.e.
he would retire with the government that appointed him.
He might, however, be reappointed by a new administration.
Any one so appointed had the right to reject such appointment and remain in service if he did not wish to retire.
3-Another result of the reform was the professionalization of ministries.
Each officer made his career in the ministry or department of his choice.
The system of centralised pooling of administrative, executive and clerical officers was discontinued .Each civil servant spent his entire career in a ministry, thus ending the inter- ministry transfer of officers.
4-Each ministry was responsible for the appointment, discipline and promotion of it’s staff, under the general guidelines provided by the Federal Civil Service Commission.
The Federal Civil Service Commission was given the power to appoint staff from grade level 07 to Grade Level 10; the ministries appointed officers of Grade level 11 and above in their departments.
5-By virtue of the reform, the Federal Civil Service Commission: a) Spelt out the responsibilities of the employees of the ministries; b) Monitored the ministries to ensure compliance with the guidelines and general existing civil service rules; c) Served as an appellate body on all personnel matters and kept records of employees of the entire civil service; d) Trained civil servants, with emphasis on specialisation and professionalism e) Reviewed the organisation and method ,grading and pay, and general management services of the entire civil service; and ` f) Managed the pension scheme, pending the reorganisation of the civil service pension scheme.
6-The horizontal structure of the civil service was based on three departments: a) personnel department b) finance department c) planning department 131 A ministry may have five additional operations departments for handling of it’s basic functions.
The total number of departments must not exceed eight.
A vertical structure in a ministry, designed to further professionalism and specialisation, consisted of divisions, which could be broken down into branches.
These branches could be further broken into specialised sections.
7-each ministry set up its own personnel management board, with its committees.
It’s composition must be shown a fair geographical spread.
The principle of Federal Character was applied in the recruitment of officers from GL O7 to 10.Merit was the criterion for promotion of officers from GL 07 to GL 10.From GL 11,promotions became political .The civil service commission ,however , remained an appellate body for an aggrieved or dissatisfied officer.
8-The central bank and the ministry of budget and planning were located in the office of the president, while the productivity, prices and incomes board was located in the ministry of finance and economic development.
9-The office of the head of service was abolished at the federal level .The secretary to the government remained wielding considerable undisputed political and administrative powers.
Following the restoration of democracy in Nigeria on May 29th, 1999, the civilian government of President Olusegun Obasanjo quickly overturned the 1998 civil service reforms –to the relief of Nigerians.
With this action, the full functions of the civil service commissions were restored .Other significant effects of the reversal were that: 1-The office of the head of service was restored.
2-The title permanent secretary, was restored, (in place of the Director- general) and the position was entirely insulated from politics.
3-The permanent secretary become, once again, the chief executive officer of his ministry 4-The so-called professionalization of ministries was discontinued, with the restoration of centralised pooling staff.
5-Merit was fully restored as the criterion for the promotion of officers at all levels.
(Oyediran et-al, 2005:117/118).
11-The Ayida Review Panel, 1995; -Recommended the abrogation of the Civil Service Reorganisation Decree No.43 of 1988 and a return to the status quo.

We have been able to analyse in this unit that reform is a journey not a destination, which requires careful planning and diligent implementation.
This is because the public service is 132 ver y important as an instrument for change and implementing government policies and should be given the deserved high priority.
For reforms to succeed, it requires building new capacities for effective management, broad collaboration and broad support to enable it cope with the 21st century challenges and deliver services effectively and efficiently.
This is because the public service needed to be altered considerably in order to inject some confidence in government by citizens who have helplessly watched the declining fortunes of the nation over the years.
This is necessitated by the fact that nations are moving from government to governance and the public service has to reflect that change.
And since the role of government has changed considerably, it requires the transformation of the public service along the pattern of change.

We have been able to look at the definition of the civil service reforms particularly the one that emphasise planned actions aimed at inducing improvement in the system.
The unit also outlined the underlying principle for public service reform to include but not limited to meeting up with the challenges of the 21st century.
The unit was able to identify and state the major content of reforms from 1945 to 1995 in order to help you clearly understand the changes that took place over the years.
The unit concluded that the civil service is the only instrument responsible for moving government to it’s required state.

134 Good governance is a relatively new term that is often used to describe the desired objective of a nation-state’s political development.
The principles of good governance, however, are not new.
Good governance is, in short, anti-corruption whereas authority and its institutions are accountable, effective and efficient, participatory, transparent, responsive, consensus- oriented, and equitable.
These are the major characteristics of good governance as outlined by the United Nations.
The World Leaders at the 2005 World Summit concluded that good governance is integral to economic growth, the eradication of poverty and hunger, and sustainable development.
The views of all oppressed groups, including women, youth and the poor, must be heard and considered by governing bodies because they will be the ones most negatively affected if good governance is not achieved.
For good governance to exist in both theory and practice, citizens must be empowered to participate in meaningful ways in decision-making processes.
Governance as it relates to the civil service forms the central theme of this part.
It begins by giving different definitions of the concept of governance from various perspectives.
Having defined governance, the various functions of governance .The above functions of government cannot be adequately and effectively executed without the government embracing the principles of good governance.
In recognition of this fact, the unit also explains the institutional conditions necessary for good governance.
We will also attempt to highlight it’s principles and various dimensions as well.

3.1 Definition of Governance.
The term governance has been variously interpreted to suit legal systems, political systems, economic systems or ideologies.
However, one string that runs through the definitions is that governance has to do with the relationship between the government and the governed.
Various institutions and agencies have also given their own definitions of the term ‘governance’.
These have been done in such a way as to either give credence to it’s (agency’s) operations or it’s goals.
The following are good examples: i.
Governance has been described as: “the set of values, policies and institutions by which a society manages economic, political and social processes”.
ii.
Governance has also been described “as the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country’s economic and social resources for development”.
Other definitions include: 135 iii.
The process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented.
iv.
The framework of rules, institutions and practices that set limits and provide incentives for the behaviour of individuals and organisations.
(Agbakoba & Ogbonna, 2004) 3.1 a Rights-based definition: Governance has been described as: the process whereby public institutions conduct public affairs, manage public resources and guarantee the realization of human rights”.
In this regard, governance is seen as the process through which those charged with the regulation of people’s conducts and the management of resources have as their basic guide and target, the guarantee of basic rights of those that are led.
The rights – based approach to governance is meant to integrate the norms, standards and principles of international human rights systems into the plans, policies and processes of development.
The norms and standards are those enshrined in international (including regional and sub – regional) treaties and declarations.
Essentially, this approach has it’s foundation in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which proclaimed human rights “as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”.
It is worthy to note that countries have their own human rights laws and standards too.
These are expressed in their respective constitutions.
They are equally given different names.
But these notwithstanding, countries are under obligations arising from their acceding to various human rights treaties “to respect, protect and fulfil” all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural.
In effect, this approach tends to emphasize the fact that governance worldwide should be measured or assessed on grounds of it’s political, social and economic policies complying with both local and international human rights obligations.
To this end, public resources should be managed in such a way and manner as to guarantee the basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
Self Assessment Exercise 1; Define governance from the human rights perspective.
3.1 b Economic-based definition: This perception tends to view governance as a means whereby the resources of a people are managed towards development.
It recognizes government as an institution that oversees these resources, makes laws governing their uses and allocation; and above all channel these resources to engender the needed development.
This approach to governance is championed by international financial institutions, donor and economic development agencies.
It has thus been opined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that: “The concept of governance is concerned with the management of the development process, involving both the public and private sectors.
It encompasses the functioning and capability of the public sector, as well as the rules and institutions that create the framework for the conduct of both public and private business, including accountability 136 for economic and finance performance, and regulatory frameworks relating to companies, corporations and partnerships.” In every legal or political system, there are rules guiding resource allocation and exploitation.
This is to ensure even distribution of resources.
Taxes and other revenues are imposed and collected for or by the government.
In this same system also, there are natural and human resources which are to be harnessed by the government.
The manner in which the government does the above for the overall benefit of the people and to enhance development is known as governance.
3.1 c Political/Administrative definition: Governance in this guise is seen as an administrative process through which the State (institutions of governance) administers it’s human and natural resources for the benefit of the people.
Towards this end, the UNDP has stated that: “Governance can be seen as the exercise of economic, political and administrative authority to manage a country’s affairs at all levels.
It comprises the mechanisms, processes and institutions, through which citizens and groups articulate their interest, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations and mediate their differences.” The main drivers in this approach to governance are government institutions and the Civil Service.
This definition is predicated upon the fact that the constitution confers legislative, executive and judicial powers upon certain persons and institutions, the exercise of which will either constitute good or bad governance.
Governance in this respect being the ability of the concerned institutions of government to play creditably, their rightful roles of legislating for the order, peace and good governance of their area of operation; executing government policies for the public good and creating a forum for the adequate redress of wrongs.
Another important area is that of creating opportunities for interest articulation and aggregation.
Individual members of any given society should be able to form groups or elect to join any of their choice.
Governance entails government being able to make good use of these diverse interests for the benefit of the society at large.
3.2 Elements of Good Governance 1.
Public Participation: Good governance presupposes the participation of the citizens in the art of governance and decision making.
It is the modern form of decentralization of powers, this time the recipient being the citizens.
Participation in local governance will not only involve access to decision making but also access to information.
2.
Accountability and transparency.
It is important that the affairs of governance are conducted with as much openness and sincerity as possible.
This will not only give the citizen the desired trust in government but also check improprieties and allow for the needed development.
The case of the local government becomes more special because of it’s proximity to the people.
Thus, it is important for leaders at the local government level to observe the tenets of accountability and transparency.
Doing otherwise will lead to loss of faith in democracy and further underdevelopment.
137 3.
Respect for the rule of law and Human Rights: Good governance entails the recognition of the rule of law and its corresponding pillars of separation of powers and respect for human rights.
There cannot be good governance without constitutionalism and by extension, the respect for fundamental freedoms.
Each arm of government should be independent with distinct powers.
4.
Efficient and effective public sector management: An efficient Civil service is the foundation of any successful government.
The civil service is responsible for implementing and executing government’s policies.
If the civil service is weak and corrupt, then the ends of governance will be defeated.
The local government should ensure that its manpower at every time is highly motivated and efficient.
Regular training and re – training should be embarked upon and anti – corruption measures put in place to check corruption.
Self Assessment Exercise 2; List and explain the elements of good governance.
3.3 The Three Access Principles of Governance.
Access to Information is defined as the ability of citizens to obtain governmental information in possession of public authorities.
the information referred to here relates to any issue of governance affecting the citizen in any way.
this includes (but not limited to) the right to know government expenditure and revenue (the budget), information on the wealth and sources thereof of a public official, access to documents that affect his rights like court documents or those of a commission.
Access to Participation is defined as the opportunity for citizens to provide informed, timely, and meaningful input and influence decisions on general policies, strategies, and plans at various stages of either formulation or implementation by the government or the community in which they live in.
individuals may for instance, engage in electoral processes, testify at hearings and meetings, serve on advisory committees, have direct contact with public officials, express views and opinions through the media, or engage in some form of protest action.
Access to Justice is defined as the ability of citizens to turn to impartial arbiters to resolve disputes over access to information and participation in the decisions making.
Such impartial arbiters include mediators, administr ative courts (commissions) and formal law courts amongst others.
The citizen can for instance sue the government over an act of a public official or an unfavourable or unlawful policy.
The citizen can also proceed against a fellow citizen for any violation of right.
Access to justice does not stop at suing but includes a favourable climate to prosecute the case, i.e., the cost and duration of litigation.
Litigation must be affordable and speedy.

3.4 Dimensions of Good Governance 1.
Political Dimension: 138 Governance as we have seen involves the exercise of powers by an elected few over other persons.
Good governance is that in which citizens have input in the business of government.
Such participation usually begins with the involvement of the citizens in the electoral process.
Since the local government is the closest to the people, it becomes imperative for local government councils to ensure mass participation in governance through the engagement of the civil society in decision making.
The political dimension of good governance also entails that people be allowed to form political groupings through which they canvass for elective positions.
In the same vein, it presupposes that citizens be guaranteed the right to vote and be voted for in elections.
Such elections should be periodic, free and fair.
Another manifestation of good governance is in the area of prevention and management of conflict.
Good governance entails that government of the day should be able to hold forth and be in total control of the lives of the people.
Government should be able to curtail the excesses of the masses, whilst not infringing their fundamental freedoms.
Conflicts of ethnic, linguistic, political or religious characters are prevalent in any given human society.
In entrenching good governance, government should be able to prevent these conflicts by harmonizing all the diverse interests and also, manage these conflicts so as not to endanger the peace and corporate existence of the society.
The local government will find a veritable partner in the traditional institutions in the task of conflict prevention.
It is, therefore, suggested that though the local government wields political power, it should involve traditional rulers in taking decisions that will affect the lives of the people or in settling disputes.
2.
Economic Dimension: The primary object of enthroning any government is to provide for the welfare of the people and the needed economic development.
Good governance thus requires government to formulate credible economic policies targeted at the realization of these objectives.
The true test of good governance is not, however, in the beauty of these but in their end results, which is, the translation of the policies into development.
Thus, good governance should be able to provide the much-needed development, attain the desired goals and affect progressively, the lives of the citizens.
The local government should ensure prudent management of it’s resources so as to attain the desired goals.
It should evolve a scale of priorities and set targets for achieving them.
No matter the policy it chooses at a particular time, the effect on the lives of the people should first be borne in mind.
3.
Human Development Dimension: In any political system, the target of government is to create conducive environment for all to live a happy, fulfilling and long life.
Human development is that development that results in enhancing the capacity of people to live long healthy lives, acquire relevant skills and knowledge that will enable them to access employment, earn higher incomes, increase their productivity and improve their quality of life.
Good governance seeks to attain human development by placing high premium on the citizens and the future generations.
139 The human development dimension of governance is also aimed at eliminating poverty, promoting human dignity and rights and providing equitable opportunities for all through the observance of the basic tenets of good governance.
The central themes of human development are building human capacity, promoting human dignity and the realization of all human rights, economic, social, cultural, civil and political.
The importance of human development is expressed in the annual evaluation of Human Development Index (HDI) published annually by the World Bank.
The HDI contains measures in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), per capita income, life expectancy and adult literacy level.
Human development in most developing countries is still being assaulted by factors such as poverty, illiteracy and HIV/AIDS.
Good governance aims at eliminating these retrogressive factors.
Just as in other tiers of government, human beings form the foundation of the local government.
However , unlike other tiers of government, the local government is the closest to the people.
Every person lives in a local government be it rural or urban.
Human development should thus be the aim of every local government.
This may prove to be a herculean task for the local government due to funds.
But suffice it to say that with the involvement of the other stakeholders like the civil society, the local government will find itself on the right path towards attaining its goals.
4.
Gender Equality: Equality between men and women has come to be recognized as a human right, a democratic and economic imper ative.
Women still constitute the bulk of the poorest households; have limited access to productive resources, power and decision-making, education and training as well as adequate health services.
Good governance will seek to recognize women’s worth and equality with men.
This must be complemented with various policies and legislations aimed at enhancing women’s living conditions, access to employment, political participation, and better access to credit and other productive resources as well as inheritance rights.
In a nutshell, the notion of gender equality is aimed at eliminating the marginalization of women and eliminating the discrimination that is prevalent in our societies.
The local government as the cradle of democracy should evolve policies that will eradicate obnoxious customs and traditional practices which set to relegate women and other individuals to the background.
3.5 Institutional Conditions for Good Governance.
Stable policy environment: Unpredictable policies, risk of economic disruption has a negative influence on the ability to deliver good govenrnenance.Whereas continuity of political leadership, adequate degree of institutional independence, clear and functional division of task between the political arm and the administration and an equitable legal framework to secure human rights, including freedom to work, organise and express opinions.
140 In this context transparency and accountability will be ensured in the use of public resources, which is a strong condition for the attainment of good governance and industrial harmony.
Clear Delineation of the role of the state: The idea of the state as primarily a facilitator of production and growth is predicated on the fact that the state provides institutional infrastructure (organisations, human and legal elements e.t.c) within which the economy and the private sector could more effectively operate as a facilitator of growth and developoment.This is a panacea for responsible governance and sustained development.
Adequate indigenous institutional structures for development policy formulation and implementation: The lack of adequate indigenous institutional machinery for development policy formulation and implementation has militated against the evolution of structures appropriate for the promotion and management of development in each country and Nigeria in particular.
Public institutions have to be equipped in order to manage development policies effectively through the promotion of popular commitment to government activities, standards of institutional effectiveness and managerial capacity, proper policy analysis, appropriate information and proper planning.
These efforts will all be sustained through adequate development of indigenous institutional structures that have the capacity to deal effectively with external agencies.
Popular participation: An increasing number of African countries subscribe to the concept of popular participation.
Thus, the need to develop an institutional framework that promotes such .This process has to promote the involvement of the masses at all levels of policy making, and the ruling class should also imbibe the culture of transparency and accountability to the people as part of their entire process of good governance.
Popular participation implies greater role of peoples and institutions whether or not they are called non-governmental organisations .Getting more popular participation in its various forms into the system is an element to achieve good governance, because it encourages political authorities to change attitudes and be ready to listen and that helps achieve accountability.
Self Assessment Exercise 3; List and explain the Institutional conditions for good governance.

The critical importance of good governance and adequate institutional capacity to support the realisation of sustainable and equitable growth cannot be overemphasised.
This is because Good governance is seen as the first prerequisite for the realisation of sustainable and equitable development.
Equity is a cornerstone for good governance which can be achieved through equitable sharing of the burden of adjustment cost and a reduction in the prevailing levels and patterns of elite consumption.
Good governance require that the government makes consistent efforts to promote the welfare of the people through policies aimed at achieving equitable and sustainable growth in per capita income while providing safeguard for national and personal security.
Good governance further requires broad popular involvement in the formulation and implementation of government policies.
Good governance is important for the removal of distortions of fiscal reforms and is an important step towards sustainable and equitable growth.
141 One ver y important element of modern thinking is the universal recognition of the fundamental importance of existing institutional capacity to the achievement of sustained and sustainable development.
The need for the public sector and particularly the civil service to manage the process of structural adjustment has also increased enormously.
Several examples were given to illustrate the critical importance of institutional capacity to deliver good governance.
For instance, consensus can be reached among policy makers on the need for exchange rate devaluation.
This would have to be decided upon on the basis of the institutional capacity to administer a structure of multiple issues.
The process of enhancing sustainable institutional capacity for development policy management is however complex but can be achieved through good governance and improvement in manpower,procedures,structures and organisation of the civil service in other to enhance overall institutional infrastructure will depend on the adoption of a long term multi-dimensional and integrated approach towards indigenous institutional development.
During the last Century also, there has been a considerable rethinking on the ways the governments now conduct their business.
They are now looking more and more towards innovative solutions to respond to an increasing number of new and complex environmental and global problems and pressures, which are further accentuated in a developing, multi- linguistic, and a multi-cultural country like Nigeria for example, having diversity of social and religious systems and tremendous ecological, cultural and external constraints.
It is thus natural that students of good governance and public administrationists all over the world, more specifically in Nigeria must now concern themselves increasingly with more vital issues beyond the realm of mere regulation and maintenance of law and order, to Citizen Participation in Governance.

The Nigerian Public sector just like any other in the world has faced several problems.
Some of these are general and can be found in almost all public administrations, while some are peculiar to the third world countries.
The civil service has witnessed a number of problems.
Some of these problems are manmade, in other words they are avoidable, while some are structural due to colonial inheritance and years of military rule where rules and regulations are suspended.
The civil service has thus witnessed series of suggestions to better improve the effective and efficient delivery of services.
The problems will be discussed in our main content below including the suggested solutions to these problems These countries have an administration that is not transferred to them from their colonial masters and without any semblance of the local needs of the people nor is it borne out of any local initiative.
Thus, with the increase in government responsibilities, the public sector was faced with a lot of problems ranging from those inherited from the colonial masters and those that arise from the day to day running of the system itself.
150 Government on its part has made several attempts to solve these problems.
But this unit will enumerate some of them and also allow room for you to identify others you have noticed that are not necessarily mentioned here.

The problems of public administration worthy of mentioned include;- 1.One central problem of public administration according to Rodee et al(1983;pg 230) is the modern democratic state of increasing the efficiency of governmental performance without sacrificing the basic democratic principles of government and making its officers and employees to remain responsible to the sovereign people.

2- The establishment of the steering committee on reforms chaired by the minister of finance.
3- Establishment of the bureau of public service reforms to serve as the coordinating and operating hub secretariat of the public service reform process.
4- Establishment of the service delivery unit to monitor adherence to the service delivery charter to be developed by all public sector institutions.
5- Establishment of the policy and programmes monitoring unit, in the office of the president, to build a comprehensive policy database for monitoring the process of implementation of government policies and programmes.

In view of the foregoing, the Nigeria public service has witnessed a lot of successes through the establishment of unity in the appointment, promotions and establishment of a strong and 156 virile service in the sustenance of the Nigeria Nation as an entity.
The civil service has through it’s quota system ensured unity in diversity despite deep cultural and ethnic diversities of the component units.
Government and in particular through the civil service as a bureaucracy was able to attain visible strides in the expansion of public service capacities to provide for it’s citizens several social services such as water,electricity,roads,transportation and even human capital development.
Unfortunately, corruption, ethnicity, civil unrest, conflict, incompetence, overdependence on foreign support, coupled with limited insight on the part of the leadership of the sector crept in and has been responsible for the rapid retrogression into a near failed sector .These also deteriorated the entire public system and gradually abandoning the tenets of commitment and service to the people, with the huge sector investment wasting and in some cases vandalised by those placed under it’s care.
For the public service to effectively play it’s role it must embrace impartiality, anonymity and confidence in hard work must be restored .The public service must serve as the bastion of continuity and development driven.
It must not be politicised in other to allow it successfully play it’s role.
The public servant must be provided with an option available in the shaping of policies.
It is important that the public service be insulated from politics and career civil servants should be allowed to perform traditional functions of implementing government policies and programmes without fear or favour in accordance with approved procedure.

In this unit, we have been able to identify and discuss the problems of the public service particularly in Nigeria.
These problems ranges from corruption, civil unrest, ethnicity and bad leadership among others.
We have clearly identified the ways in which these problems can be solved.
These include a proactive public service, a committed public service and that which is driven by observance to dynamic rule and regulations.
A public service that motivates it’s workforce and is also committed to solving conflicts by promoting unity in the country.
