Through this course therefore, you will be encouraged to develop an enquiring attitude towards Partial Differential Equations and relate the lessons learnt to the universe around you and which abounds with ceaseless applications of Partial Differential Equations.
It is the objectives of this course to build upon the lessons learnt in the prerequisite course, and formally to introduce to you the more advanced concept of Partial Differential Equations with the view to greater strengthening your understanding of the underlying principles at work upon which developmental research in this highly specialised area of mathematics are based, THE COURSE: MTH 422 Partial Differential Equations This course comprises a total of seven Units distributed across four modules as follows: Module 1 is composed of 2 Units Module 2 is composed of 2 Units Module 3 is composed of 2 Units Module 4 is composed of 1 Unit Module 1 Unit 1 will bring you up to speed on the Essential Definitions pertinent to the study of Partial Differential Equations.
In this unit we will show you how to recognize First Order Equation, Quasi – Linear Equations and use the Method of Lagrange in solving them.
In Unit 2 we will guide you through a test case scenario where you shall apply Partial Differential Equation to the formulation of the Conservation Law and ultimately derive the conceptual Development of Shock.
Module 2 will allow you to work with General First Order Equation in Unit 1 focusing on the Cauchy Method of Characteristic for Partial Differential Equation.
In Unit 2 you will be shown that there are three Types of Solution; the Complete Solution (Integral), the General Solution (Integral) and the Singular Solution respectively.
Module 3 will allow us move up to higher order Partial Differential Equations; specifically Second Order Partial Differential Equations in Unit 1 where you shall learn about their Classifications and the Tricomi’s Equation, its Characteristics and learn about the Case of Two Independent Variables.
We shall see that expediency at times dictates that we apply Transformation of Independent Variables in arriving at a solution for Partial Differential Equations in Unit 2 with the view to recognizing the Regular Case, the Hyperbolic case and the Elliptic Case.
Unit 1 of Module 4 brings to the fore the Cauchy Problem which you shall learn; as well as the Characteristics Problem, the Fundamental Existence Theorem and you shall complete this course only after knowing and understanding the Kovalevsky theorem.

SUMMARY Each of the four modules of this course has been designed to stimulate your interest in Partial Differential Equations through fundamental conceptual building blocks in the study and application of Partial Differential Equations to practical problem solving.
Module 1 premises this course with the statement of the Essential Definitions to be found in the study of Partial Differential Equations and proceeds through First Order Equations, Quasi – Linear Equations and the Method of Lagrange.
It is closed with a study of the Application of Partial Differential Equations to the Conservation Law which is developed to the concept of Shock – a consequence of an abrupt discontinuity.
Module 2 treats General First Order Equation with particular reference to Cauchy Method of Characteristic.
It presents the three Types Of Solution of Partial Differential Equations - Complete Solution (Integral), General Solution (Integral) and Singular Solution Module 3 focuses on the higher order Partial Differential Equations commencing with the Second Order.
This module Classifies Partial Differential Equations an lays emphasis on the Tricomi’s Equation, its Characteristics and treats the Case of Two Independent Variable.
It further proceeds to the Transformation of Independent Variables where three cases are highlighted; the Regular, the Hyperbolic and the Elliptic Cases.
Module 4 which closes the course takes on the Cauchy Problem and Characteristics Problem.
It is partly occupied with the Fundamental Existence Theorem; the Cauchy problem as well as the Cauchy Kowalevski theorem You will feel more at ease with Partial Differential Equations and life will never be the same again by the time you compete this course.
In order to achieve this however, my advise are - make sure that you have enough referential and study material available and at your disposal at all times, and – devote sufficient quality time to your study.

How are they rendered graphically and how do we solve them?, this unit addresses these questions with a tour of the basics of partial differential equations; particularly on an introduction to the methods for deriving solution.
2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (i) Properly define the term partial differential equation (ii) Classify first order equations (iii) Investigate the methods for constructing solutions for partial differential equations (iv) Solve quasi – Linear Equations (v) Explore the many definitions applied in deriving solutions (vi) Apply the method of Lagrange in deriving solutions for partial differential equations 4 MTH 422 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 3 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 ESSENTIAL DEFINITIONS In some elementary course we encountered many physical problems that are modelled by ordinary differential equations and have learnt some of the basic solution technique for such equation.
We shall now expand our view by examining partial differential equations.
Our Approach will deal with i) Existence and Uniqueness of solutions.
ii) Stability of solution to small perturbations.
iii) Methods for constructing solutions.

We examined partial differential equations from the perspectives of existence and uniqueness of solutions, stability of solution to small perturbations around the solution as well as the different methods for constructing solutions 5.0 SUMMARY Partial differential equations can be generically classified into families and methods of solution for classes categories based on their properties.

All are treated in this unit.
2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (i) Categorise the different types of solution of partial differential equations (ii) Know the methods used in deriving complete solution (iii) Understand what a general solution means (iv) Explain why some partial differential equations are singular solutions 3 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 TYPES OF SOLUTION We observe that the general solution of the 1st order pde 1.9.1 is an expression involving an arbitrary function of one variable.
43 MTH 422 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS This naturally is the extension of the result that the general solution of an order of first order involves one arbitrary constant 3.1.1 COMPLETE SOLUTION (INTEGRAL) Any solution of the form   Z  x,y,a,b 1.16.1 Where a, b are arbitrary parameters represents two parameter family of surfaces.
No systematic rule determining the complete integral is available.
The complete integral is significant in the sense that the envelope of any family of solution of the 1st order equation 1.11 depending on some parameter is again a solution.
Indeed equation 1.9.1 defines the tangent plane of a solution and as a result, if a surface has the same tangent plane as a solution at some point in space, then it also satisfiers the equation there.
The envelope of a family of solutions is also a solution since it’s in contact at each of it’s points with one of these earlier mentioned solutions.
3.1.2 GENERAL SOLUTION (INTEGRAL) The general solution of 1.9.1 can thus be obtained from the complete integral if we prescribe the 2nd parameter b, say b = b(a) as an arbitrary function of a.
