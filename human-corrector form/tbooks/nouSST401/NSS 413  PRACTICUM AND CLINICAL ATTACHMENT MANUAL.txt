Nursing as a practice-related profession involves both theory and clinical practice.
It involves the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains.
The Clinical practice/attachment is an important component required before graduation by any student undergoing degree programme in Nursing.
This course guide provides hints on clinical practical for students at the 400 Level meant to further equip the students and to provide effective and qualitative nursing care for patients at the three levels of care.
NSS 413: Practicum and Clinical Attachment has been designed to provide opportunity for the nursing personnel running programmes to determine the level of clinical attachment by students in the programme some of whom might have left the clinical due to other professional assignments (administrative and ad-hoc duties).
Prior to taking this course, the BNSc programme has exposed students to basic scientific skills at the lower levels of study such as NSS 201: Foundations of Nursing, NSS 211: Human Anatomy , NSS 213: Human Physiology I and NSS 214: Human Physiology II, at the 200 Level, NSS 311: Nature of Nursing, NSS 314: Applied Sciences, NSS 316: Concise Behavioural Science, NSS 321: Medical and Surgical Nursing I, and NSS 322: Medical and Surgical Nursing II at the 300 Level and NSS 403: Medical and Surgical Nursing III, NSS 404: Medical and Surgical Nursing IV at the 400 Level.
