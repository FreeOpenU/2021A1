It was soon discovered that atoms are made of elementary particles.
1.1 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you will be able to:  Highlight the constituents of an atom  Explain nuclear size, nuclear masses and nuclear forces.
1.2 MAIN CONTENT 1.2.1 NUCLEAR STRUCTURE Although there are numerous elementary particles, the only relevant particles in our earthly life and in nuclear reactors, which we are going to discuss, are photons and the particles that constitute material, that is, protons, neutrons, and electrons.
Among these, the proton and neutron have approximately the same mass.
However, the mass of the electron is only 0.05% that of these two particles.
The proton has a positive charge and its absolute value is the same as the electric charge of one electron (the elementary electric charge).
The proton and neutron are called nucleons and they constitute a nucleus.
An atom is constituted of a nucleus and electrons that circle the nucleus due to Coulomb attraction.

1) Species of atoms and nuclei are called elements and nuclides, respectively.
An element is determined by its proton number (the number of protons).
The proton number is generally called the atomic number and is denoted by Z.
A nuclide is determined by both the proton number and the neutron number (the number of neutrons denoted by N).
The sum of the proton number and neutron number, namely, the nucleon number, is called the mass number and is denoted by A (A=Z+N).
Obviously, a nuclide can also be determined by the atomic number and mass number.
In order to identify a nuclide, A and Z are usually added on the left side of the atomic symbol as superscript and subscript, respectively.
For example, there are two representative nuclides for uranium, described as (cid:2870)(cid:2871)(cid:2873)(cid:1847) and (cid:2870)(cid:2871)(cid:2876)(cid:1847).
If the atomic symbol is given, the atomic number (cid:2877)(cid:2870) (cid:2877)(cid:2870) can be uniquely determined; thus Z is often omitted like 235U and238U.
The chemical properties of an atom are determined by the atomic number, so even if the mass numbers of nuclei are different, if the atomic numbers are the same, their chemical properties are the same.
These nuclides are called isotopic elements or isotopes.
If the mass numbers are the same and the atomic numbers are different, they are called isobars.
If the neutron numbers are the same, they are called isotones.
The above examples for uranium are isotopes.
Summarizing these and rewriting the constitution of an atom, we obtain Figure 2.
Fig.2 Constitution of an atom (No.
2) 5 A nuclide is any nuclear specie, with the combination of neutrons and protons i.e.
AX , A= z atomic mass, Z = atomic number = number of proton = number of electrons while number of neutron, N = (A - Z).
- nuclides with the same Z = Isotopes - nuclides with the same A= Isobars - nuclides with the same N= Isotones - nuclides with the same A and Z but different states of excitations = Isomers - the charge distribution within the nucleus can be assumed uniform with charge density given by; (cid:1842)((cid:1870)) = (cid:3096)(cid:3116) ((cid:3293)(cid:3127)(cid:3267)) (cid:2869)(cid:2878)℮ (cid:3277) Where (cid:2025) = density at the nuclear centre (cid:2868) (cid:2025) R= radius at which ρ falls to (cid:2868)(cid:3415) 2 b= measures how rapidly the density falls to zero at the nuclear surface.
R =(cid:2025) (cid:1827)(cid:2869), r =1.23x10-15m (cid:2868) o (cid:2871) R = radius of nucleus This implies that - the volume of nucleus is proportional to number of particle A - charge density P(r) decreases slowly with increasing A.
- 1 a.m.u.= 1.6660053 x 10-27kg.
= 931MeV To show that the electron is not a constituent of the nucleus.
Uncertainty principle is applied here.
- Typical nuclear are less than 10-14m in radius - Therefore for an electron to be confined within such nucleus, the uncertainty in its position may not exceed 10-14m.
- The corresponding uncertainty in the electrons momentum is: 6  p  x h 6.6251034    2 23.14 1.0551034JS1 and.x  2r  21014m  1.0551034 p   x 21014  5.2751021kgms1 - If this is uncertainty in the momentum of the electron, the momentum itself must be at least comparable in magnitude.
- The K.E.
of the electron of mass, m may be put as follows: 2 T  2m wherem91031kg 91031kg1.61019eV 1.441049eV 5.27510212  21.441049 9.7107eV 97MeV From the above, it follows that if the electrons are present inside the nucleus, their K.E must be of the order 97MeV.
But experimental data reveal that no electron in the atom has energy greater than 4MeV.
This clearly reveals that e-s do not exist in the nucleus.
Excess mass and Packing fraction Excess mass is defined as the difference between the masses of the nucleons (M) and the atomic mass (A).
This implies that excess mass = (M - A), which can either be either positive or negative.
Packing fraction (f) can be defined as the ratio of the excess mass to the atomic mass.
This implies that packing fraction is expressed as (M – A)/A= f. It is only Carbon -12 that has its M - A = 0.
7 1.2.2 THE NUCLEUS The alpha ( ) scattering experiment led to the discovery of a nucleus of an atom.
The mass of the atom seems to be concentrated at the nucleus and it is surrounded by cloud of electrons which makes the entire atom electrically neutral.
One of the goals of Rutherford’s -scattering is the determination of the radius (R) of the nucleus that is as -particle approaches the gold nucleus it slows down due to coulomb force but later speeds up on its way-out.
The coulomb repulsive force in the region close to the scattering gold nucleus is given by 2eZe F  4b2 o The time of operation of force b t  v The force produces a momentum,∆(cid:1868), which is perpendicular to the direction of -particle.

1.2.3 NUCLEAR BINDING ENERGY AND SEPARATION ENERGY Binding energy is the energy that must be supplied to dissociate the nucleus into separate nucleus or the energy released when the separated nucleons were assembled into a nucleus.
B (A, Z) = [ZM + NM – M(A,Z)] 931MeV --------------------- (1) H N Also, the difference between the actual nuclear mass and the mass of all the individual nucleus is called the mass defect (Md) which is equal to W – M. Binding energy is a measure of cohesiveness of a nucleus that is between the proton and neutron.
Also, a more useful measure of cohesiveness is the binding energy per nucleon   B A,Z MeV      ZM  NM M A,Z 931 A H N A ----------------- (2) From equation (1) the mass of a nucleon becomes.

SEPARATION ENERGY The work necessary to separate a proton, neutron, deuteron or -particle from a nucleus is called Separation Energy.

If Sn or Sp is plotted against A, there are some areas of discontinuities at A=2, 8, 20, 50, 82, 126 (magic numbers).
The energy required to remove magic numbers are higher than ordinary numbers.

This decay occurs in nuclide in order that they may attain stability.
This disintegration or decay occurs with the emission of some particles or energy.
3.1 OBJECTIVES After going through this unit, you will be able to:  Explain radioactivity and its kinematics.
 Highlight and list the properties of particles released during radioactivity.
 Explain the radioactive series  Explain age determination using radioisotopes.
3.2 MAIN CONTENT 3.2.1 STABILITY OF NUCLIDES (cid:1840) The stability of nuclides is mainly determined by the atomic mass (A) and the ( (cid:3415) ) ratio.
(cid:1852) (cid:1840) (cid:1840) The condition for the stability of eight elements is (cid:3415) =1, and for heavy elements, (cid:3415) ≈ 1.5 (cid:1852) (cid:1852) Nuclides that are not stable due to this ratio seek stability by undergoing inter-nuclear 15 (cid:1840) spontaneous transformation which shifts the (cid:3415) ratio to a more stable configuration.
During (cid:1852) this transformation, the following could occur: 1.
1p 1n 0V.
1 0 1 2.
1n  1p0V.
0 1 1 3.
particles may be emitted (that is 2 protons and 2 neutrons) 4.
Splitting of nucleus into two nearly equal fragments through nuclear fission.
Radioactivity can therefore be defined as the tendency of unstable nuclides, seeking to become stable through the emission of particles and energy.
The emitted particles during radioactivity are referred to as nuclear radiation.
Nuclear radiation can well be referred as ionizing radiation because they have sufficient energy to cause the production of ion pairs in any medium which they pass through.
The most common particles usually emitted are ,,and particle.
−(cid:2235)−(cid:2198)(cid:2183)(cid:2200)(cid:2202)(cid:2191)(cid:2185)(cid:2194)(cid:2187)(cid:2201) The nuclear transformation equation for an - particle is given by:   AX  A4Y 4HE 4 Q Z Z2 2 2   238U  234TH  4HE 4 Q 92 90 2 2 Properties 1.
- particles can be stopped by a thin sheet of paper 2.
They cause intense ionization in air 3. a group of - particle emitted from the same type of nuclides usually have definite velocity and energy.
4.
- particles cover a definite distance in a given material practically without any loss of intensity and suddenly in a small distance are absorbed completely.
The definite distance traveled with a given material is called the RANGE -- Particles The nuclear transformation equation for an -particle is given by: AX  AY 01 V Q Z Z1 1 14C 14N 0 V Q 6 7 1 16  Properties 1.
They cause less ionization in air 2.
100 times more penetrating than particle and can penetrate a sheet of aluminum, a few millimeters thick.
3.
A particular - active element emits - particles with energies varying between zero and certain maximum.
This maximum energy is called the end point energy.
X-RAYS AND (cid:2237) RAYS.
These are part of electromagnetic radiation.

(≈ 100 times).
Owing to their large energies, they can  dislodge electrons not only from outer orbits but from inner orbits.
The ability of the ray to be able to dislodge electrons from both the outer and inner orbit can be done in the following ways: 1.
Photoelectric effect 2.

3.2.2 KINEMATICS OF RADIOACTIVITY When a nucleus disintegrates by emitting particle ,,or capture an electron from an atomic shell (k-capture).
This process is called Radioactive decay.
All nuclear decay follows a single law called a Decay law.

3.2.3 RADIOACTIVE SERIES Radio nuclides that are related constitute a decay chain or series.
The successive daughter products are formed through the emission of and particles leading to stable end-product.
There are four known series in nature but that of neptinium is artificial.
They are 1.
Thorium 4n 25 2.
Neptinium 4n+1 3.
Uranium 4n+2 4.
Actinium 4n+3 There are also some, that are not of large atomic number e.g.
40K and all these constitute a source of radioactivity in the earth crust.
Branching Normally, a particular radio nuclide is supposed to decay through either and decay.
In some cases some will decay through and or both.
This phenomenon is known as branching.
E.g.
214Bi α β- 210 Tl 214Po Age Determination using Radioisotopes Radioactivity is the best clock in determining or usually applied to estimate the absolute age of geological materials because it is totally not affected by environmental changes of natural processes like earthquakes, storms etc Some of the radioisotopes that are useful for geological age dating include 87Sr / 87Rb, 14C/ 12C, Pb / U, Pb / Th etc.
The half life of these radioisotopes are usually use for determining the age ranges of interest.
The determination of geological ages is done very often by the lead method which involves A X A4 Y4Q X Z2 z   238u emission of 8 4x  206pb 92 z 82   235u emission of 7 4x  206pb 92 z 82   232Th emissionof 6 4x  206pb 90 z 82 These are natural decay series in which after sufficient time e.g.
billion years only uranium and lead are the elements left in appreciable amounts.
This is because all elements in the uranium series are in secular equilibrium with the parents except (cid:2870)(cid:2868)(cid:2874)(cid:1842)(cid:1854) which is not in (cid:2876)(cid:2870) secular equilibrium.

These particles exhibit different characteristics when they are emitted.
Therefore, it is important we study these particles in detail to enable us handle them properly when they are released.

 Understand the properties of these particles when they are released.

RANGE OF -PARTICLE - particles are densely ionizing and lose their energies in quick succession in air or any medium.
The number of ions pairs produced per unit length is called specific ionization (S.I) The mean distance travelled by -particle before absorption is called range.
32 The intersection of -particle with atoms or molecules of a medium are purely statistical and as a result they do not have the same range as in air.
Range, R = 318E3/2 An empirical relation between the range of -particle and disintegration constant is given by Geiger Nuttal Law (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859)(cid:2019) = (cid:1827)(cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859)(cid:1844)+(cid:1828) -decay paradox Because -particle is a tightly bound entity we can assure it pre-exists in the nucleus before its emission.
For a -particle to come out or go into the nucleus it implies it must have an energy in the neighborhood of the potential well of the nucleus.
The energy of -particle usually ranges between 4-8Mev which is far less than what is required to surmount the potential barrier.
Classically it is impossible to understand this because it has no chance of leaving the nucleus.
In 1928, George Gamow and independently with others applied wave mechanics to the problem of -decay paradox and they were able to resolve it.
They considered an -particles as a matter wave.
This implies that -particle as a finite probability of penetrating the wall of thickness where it undergoes series of collisions per second.
It was also discovered that the probability of finding the -particle outside the nucleus is small but not zero.

2) It is also an energy transition between two definite energy states.
3) Mono-energetic β-rays forming a line spectrum are expected.
1 From the figure above, most of the electrons are emitted with only (cid:3415) of the energy.
3 2 Therefore, this makes one to imagine where the remaining of the (cid:3415) of the maximum energy 3 would have gone to.
Since measurements like momentum and angular momentum are not conserved.
These suggest that a third particle must exist that always accompany the β-decay.
It was detected to be neutrino((cid:2020)).

A nucleus is usually left in an excited state after emitting either or rays then it is de- excitated by emitting gamma rays.
Gamma rays are emitted with discrete and definite energies which is an indication of the nuclear structure.
The energy carried away is ∆(cid:1831) = ℎ(cid:1858).
When the mean life time of the excited nucleus is >10-65, the daughter nucleus is said to exhibit nuclear isomerism.
Yk and Y are nuclear isomers and are chemically and physically the same.
The difference is that Yk is more energetic than Y and it eventually emits the energy as γ ray and returns to ground state.
Sometimes, instead of γ ray being emitted, this excess energy of the excited nucleus may be transferred to an extra nuclear electron to get it from its shell (usually K or L shell).
This process is called internal conversion.
Kinetic energy of converted electron is 36 (cid:1837)(cid:1857) = ∆(cid:1831) −(cid:1828)(cid:1857) (cid:1828)(cid:1857)−(cid:1854)(cid:1861)(cid:1866)(cid:1856)(cid:1861)(cid:1866)(cid:1859) (cid:1857)(cid:1866)(cid:1857)(cid:1870)(cid:1859)(cid:1877) (cid:1867)(cid:1858) (cid:1857)(cid:1864)(cid:1857)(cid:1855)(cid:1872)(cid:1870)(cid:1867)(cid:1866) ∆(cid:1831) = (cid:1831) − (cid:1831) (cid:3036) (cid:3033) Generally, because of internal conversion, the yield of γ rays in a particular decay ˂100%.
Some of the spikes observed in continuous β – spectrum is usually due to internal conversion process.

This interaction has made of possible to be used in diagnosis, researchers industries X-ray and radiotherapy.
Because of the fundamental difference in energy transfer.
Radiation can be categorize into four 1.
Heavy charged particles 2.
Fast electrons particles 3.
Neutrons electrons particle 4.
Protons electrons particles Cross section and interaction co-efficient The probability that an interaction will take place is expressed in cross sections.
Cross section actually describes the effective area which the interaction center or entities presents to the radiation which if traversed by the radiation, it ensures that an interaction occur.
probof interaction p  no.of conc.centerarea probof interaction p  particle fluence,Q is expressed in m2 or in barns 45 1barns 1028m2.
Linear attenuation co-efficient is given as (cid:3031)∅ = −(cid:2020)(cid:1856)(cid:1864) ∅ ∅ = ∅ (cid:1857)(cid:2879)(cid:3091)(cid:3031)(cid:3039) (cid:3042) Where (cid:2020) = (cid:1868)(cid:2012) that is probability of interaction per unit length.
Also number of atoms per unit volume of substances (cid:1866) = (cid:3015)(cid:3250)(cid:3096) = (cid:3015) (cid:3014) (cid:3023) 6.1 OBJECTIVES After going through this unit, you will be able to:  Explain parameters used in quantifying the amount of radiation interacting with matter.
 Explain how the different categories of radiation interact with matter.
6.2 MAIN CONTENT 6.2.1 HEAVY CHARGED PARTICLE INTERACTION This interaction can be divided into 3 broad groups which are: a. interaction with individual electron of the atoms which leads to excitation or ionization of atoms and this collision can be; i. Inelastic - sufficient energy received for excitation.
ii.
Elastic - energy received is less than the smallest energy difference of the atomic level.
It may be hard or soft collision.
It may also be fast or slow depending on projectile velocity and orbital velocity b. Interaction with nuclei if incoming particle is heavy compared with electrons.
c. Interaction with the whole coulomb field surrounding an atom.
This occurs when the incident particle is of low energy or heavy particle with low velocities.
The outcome of a collision or interaction is determined by: i. velocity of collision, V ii.
Distance of closest approach of the participants.
iii.
The range of the potential which governs the interaction between the incident particle and the target.
46 For heavy particles like particles interacts with the coulomb forces between positive and negative charges in matter.
It then dissipates its energy in succession to the electron through inelastic collision which then results in either excitation or ionization.
The number of ion produced per unit distance is called specific ionization.
The linear rate of energy loss or linear stopping power S for heavy charged particle in a given absorber is (cid:3031)(cid:3006) (cid:1845) = − (cid:3031)(cid:3025) (cid:2869) S increase as the particle velocity decreases that is (cid:1845) ∝ (cid:3023) For a non-relativistic particle, 4e4Z2NB(Z V) S  1 Beth's formula M V2 o Where M - rest mass of electron 0 V-velocity of heavy particle e - Electronic charge Z - Atomic number of the absorber atom B(Z V) - Beth’s formula 1 ln2M V2  V2 V 2  B(Z V)  Z o ln1  o  1  I  C2 C2  I = average ionization potential of absorption While for a non-relativistic charged particle lnMoV2  1 1 B(Z V)  Z ,S   1  I  V2 E 6.2.2 BETA RAYS (FAST ELECTRONS) The energy lost by fast electrons is due to excitation and ionization as well.
Majorly, energy are usually lost due to; a).
Scattering of the fast electrons because they are colliding with another electron in target.
The energy loss per unit length D (cid:3031)(cid:3006) − (cid:3416) (cid:3031)(cid:3051) (cid:1829) = (cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1864)(cid:1864)(cid:1861)(cid:1871)(cid:1861)(cid:1867)(cid:1866) 47 (cid:3031)(cid:3006) − (cid:3416) b).

(Usually for electrons with energy greater than rest mass energy).
Therefore, the total linear specific energy loss is; dE dE dE  c r dX dX dX dE c dX E8 and  dE 7w r dX c).

iii.
Describe one of the ways by which energy is lost when an electron interact with matter.
6.2.3 PHOTONS Interaction of E-M radiation (i.e.
X and γ rays photons) Under an energy region of 0.01 - 10MeV, most interactions γ and X-rays can be explained under three different modes a. Photoelectric effect b. Compton effect c. Pair production a).
Photoelectric Effect This is a kind of interaction whereby an incident photon transfers all its energy to the electron in a target and therefore these electrons are emitted as photoelectrons with a kinetic energy given as below; (cid:1831) = (cid:1831) −(cid:1831) (cid:3032) (cid:3082) (cid:3003) The incident photon must have an energy greater than or equal to (cid:1831) of the electron to the (cid:3003) nucleus of the target.
48 Therefore, vacancies are created at the K-shells and filled by electrons from higher shells which results into X-rays.
The cross section of the photoelectric effect is given as; (cid:2026) = (cid:2012)(cid:1831) (cid:2879)(cid:2875)(cid:3415)(cid:2870)(cid:2025)(cid:1852)(cid:2873) (cid:3017).
(cid:3006) (cid:3082) (cid:2025) (cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1856) (cid:1852)(cid:2873) are density and atomic number of the absorbing material or target.
(cid:2012) is constant b).
Compton Effect This is a situation whereby the incident photon collides with the orbital electron of the target and the incident photon and orbital electrons are scattered at different angles.
Observations i.
Reduction in photon energy from hv  hv1.
ii.
Frequency is changed from v  v1 (reduced).
iii.
The wavelength of photon increases from1 .
iv.
Energy of scattered electron is (hv – hv1).
v. The increase in wavelength is given as h 1  1cos M C o Where M is the rest mass of the atom of which the electron is used.

The energy of the scattered photon is; 49 E E   1  E  1  1cos M C2   o vii.

c).
Pair Production.
This occurs when  rays with sufficient energy interacts with the atom of the target in the coulomb field of the nucleus and disappears with electron position pair in place of it.
The energy equation of the process is given as hv = E - +(cid:1831) + 2M C2 e (cid:3032)(cid:3126) o Pair production can only take place if greater than or equal to 2M C2 = 1.02MeV.
o 50 The position is an unstable particle once its kinetic energy = 0, it annihilates with the electron to form a photon which either escapes from the medium or interacts with the medium either photoelectrically or photocompton.
(cid:2026) = (cid:1829)(cid:1852)(cid:2870)(cid:2012)(cid:1864)(cid:1866)(cid:1831) (cid:3043).
(cid:3043) (cid:3082) The net effect of the three in γ-ray passing through an absorbing material or the linear cross- section is an exponential attenuation given by (cid:1835) = (cid:1835) (cid:1857)(cid:2879)(cid:3097)(cid:3051) (cid:3016) 6.2.4 NEUTRONS The kind of reaction a neutron undergoes depends on its energy.
Neutrons are classified according to their energy; 1.
High energy neutron greater than 10MeV 2.
Thermal neutrons is the same as average kinetic energy of gas molecules = 0.025eV.
All neutrons at the time of their birth are fast but are slowed down (thermalizing) by colliding them elastically with atoms in their environment.
After the slowing down, they are now been absorbed by nuclei of the absorbing material and interaction takes place.
The interaction of neutron is different from past discussion because, it does not show a variation between the atomic mass and energy.
The interactions instead produce; 1.
Recurring nuclei 2.
Subatomic particles 3.
Photons which undergo previous processes.
Generally neutrons may collide with nuclei and undergo; 1.
Elastic collisions Fast neutrons react with low atomic number absorbers.
The neutron is scattered with a reduced energy because part of the energy have been transferred to the recurring nuclei e.g.
1H (n n) 1H.
(Here the nucleus moves).
, 2.
Inelastic collisions If the neutron is of low energy, the neutron may be momentarily captured by the nucleus and then emitted with diminished energy leaving the nucleus in an excited state and may return to its ground state with the emission of photon e.g.
16O(n, n)16O.
(Here the nucleus does not moved but brushed).
If another particle is produced after interaction, it is called non-elastic 51 collision e.g.
16O (n,) 13C.
Thermal neutrons are captured by nuclei with reaction cross section as 1 1  E     o v E  E o Passage of neutrons through a moderating material The process of slowing down fast neutrons is known as moderation or thermalization and this is done by making use of moderators (element with low atomic mass) e.g.
graphite and heavy water, in such a way that no reaction is lost by absorption but merely have their kinetic energy being reduced by elastic collision with nuclei of the moderator.

From past max discussion we have been dealing with flux of neutron, but now we want to discuss about one which will now be a statistical problem.
Let’s assume the neutron is scattered between angle andd and the energy (that is E and E + dE) between E and E+dE.
It will be observed that the entire range of energy through which the neutron can be scattered is between 1.
E = E (from glancing) and (2) E = αE 1 0 1 0 (from head on collision).
This implies that (cid:1831) −(cid:2009)(cid:1831) = (cid:1831) (1−(cid:2009)) (cid:3042) (cid:3042) (cid:3042) The probability P(E)dE that a neutron will have an energy E between E and αE is 1.
0 o The probability that it will lie between E and E+dE (cid:2869) = P(E) = (cid:3006)(cid:3290)((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3080)) ∫(cid:3006)(cid:3290) (cid:1842)((cid:1831))(cid:1856)(cid:1831) = ∫(cid:3006)(cid:3290) (cid:3031)(cid:3006) = 1 (cid:3080)(cid:3006)(cid:3290) (cid:3080)(cid:3006)(cid:3290)(cid:3006)(cid:3290)((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3080)) Therefore, the average energy (E) of a neutron after a series of scattering or the probability that a single collision will make a neutron have energy E is  E EP(E)dE EdE (E) Eo   E  E P(E)dE Eo E 1 E 0 o 1   Eo EdE E 1 Eo 0 E 1 E2 0     E 1  2  0 E 0 1    E 2 2E 2 2E 1 0 0 0 53 1    E 212 2E 1 0 0 1     E 1 1 21 0  1 E (1) 2 0 Average log energy decrement This is used to obtain the average number of collisions which a fast neutron, will make before its energy E is reduced to thermal energy E. 0 t Take E = E t Log energy decrement is log E – log E = log (E /E) e o E e o Therefore average log = [log (E /E)] e o E E    o log 0 P(E)dE E E   o = ∫(cid:3006)(cid:3116) (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859)(cid:3437)(cid:1831)(cid:2868)(cid:3415) (cid:3441) (cid:3031)(cid:3006) −−−−−−−(1) (cid:3080)(cid:3006)(cid:3116) (cid:1831) (cid:3006)(cid:3290)((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:3080)) E dE Since  o 1 E E (1) o o (cid:1831) Then put x = (cid:3415) (cid:1831) (cid:2868) For limits to change For E = E ; x = 1 o And E = αE = x = α o (cid:1831) From x = (cid:3415) , (cid:1856)(cid:1831) = (cid:1831) (cid:1856)(cid:1876) (cid:1831) (cid:2868) (cid:2868) (cid:1831) And log (cid:2868)(cid:3415) = -log (cid:1876).

Also, the distance travelled by the thermalized diffusion length and it is defined as the thickness of the slowing down medium.
