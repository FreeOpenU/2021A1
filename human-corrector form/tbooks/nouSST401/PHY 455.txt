National Open University of Nigeria 4 NATIONAL OPEN UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA INTRODUCTION You have studied the behaviour of gases under controlled conditions.
The knowledge you gained in your study of gas laws shall now be extended to atmospheric gases.
The atmosphere itself is a relatively thin gaseous envelop that surrounds the Earth.
It provides the air we breathe and protects us against some harmful radiations from the Sun.
You certainly know the statement of Snell’s law.
In this course, we shall use Snell’s law to explain some of the observed characteristics of radio waves.
At the end of this course, you should be able to answer each of the following questions.
Why does most of our weather occur within the troposphere?
What is the importance of the ionosphere in relation to radio-wave propagation?
How does the temperature at any point in the atmosphere depend on height?
What happens within the saturation region?
How can we relate the internal energy, the enthalpy and the entropy to the temperature and specific volume of a pure substance?
What are the effects of the troposphere on radio wave propagation?
How does the flow of radiant energy change as one moves through an atmosphere that emits and absorbs radiation?
What are the factors responsible for the broadening of spectral lines?
The answer to each of these questions is of interest to us because the phenomena involved have significant effects on our life here on Earth.

It contains gases, clouds and other air-borne particles called aerosols.
The terrestrial atmosphere provides protection against the harmful radiations from the sun.
It also helps to maintain warm temperatures on the Earth.

MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Earth’s Atmosphere 3.1.1 Layers of the Atmosphere The atmosphere of the Earth is composed of different layers.
It starts from the surface of the Earth and thins out with height until it merges with space.
In terms of the variation of temperature with height, the layers of the atmosphere are a) the troposphere, b) the stratosphere, c) the mesosphere, and d) the thermosphere.
16 These layers are listed in order of increasing height.
Thus, the troposphere is the lowest layer followed by the stratosphere, the mesosphere and the thermosphere.
The thermosphere is the highest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere (in terms of temperature).
In terms of composition, the atmosphere is classified into two: a) the homosphere (upto 85km height), and b) the heterosphere (above 85km height).
In the homosphere, the mean molecular mass is constant due to mixing.
In the heterosphere, the mean molecular mass varies due to diffusive separation.
In terms of the escape properties of neutral particles, the terrestrial atmosphere is called the exosphere.
3.1.2 Troposphere The troposphere is the first layer above the surface of the Earth.
It stretches from the surface of the Earth to an altitude of about 10 kilometres.
The gases in the troposphere are predominantly molecular nitrogen N  and molecular oxygen 2 O .
The troposphere contains 90% of the mass of the Earth’s atmosphere.
It 2 also contains 99% of all the water vapour present in the atmosphere.
Within the troposphere, temperature deceases with height at the rate of about 6.5 oC per kilometer.
This rapid decrease in temperature with height is almost linear.
It continues until the temperature reaches a local minimum value which defines the upper boundary of the troposphere known as the tropopause.
At the tropopause, the temperature remains constant.
The tropopause may lie somewhere between 10km and 15km above the surface of the Earth.
17 All our day-to-day activities occur within the troposphere: the top of Mount Everest lies within the troposphere; air planes fly within the troposphere; and 99% of all atmospheric weather is confined to the troposphere.
It is the decrease in temperature with height that promotes vertical motion of the atmosphere.
This explains why most of our weather occurs within the troposphere.
3.1.3 Stratosphere The stratosphere lies above the tropopause.
In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude.
The increase in temperature with height continues until a local maximum is reached at a height of about 50 kilometers.
This local maximum defines the stratopause.
The stratopause is the upper boundary region of the stratosphere.
The stratosphere is very stable.
For that reason, many jet planes fly within the stratosphere.
However, stratospheric air remains sufficiently dense to enable hot air balloons to ascend to altitudes of between 15km and 20km.
Helium balloons are capable of rising to a height of about 35 kilometres.
The ozone layer exists in the stratosphere.
The stratospheric region is relatively calm.
The variation of stratospheric temperature with height is not as rapid as the variation of tropospheric temperature with height.
The stratosphere is relatively warm because the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by oxygen and ozone.
3.1.4 Mesosphere The mesosphere lies above the stratopause.
In the mesosphere, the temperature decreases with altitude up to a local minimum.
This local minimum, called the mesopause, defines the upper boundary of the mesosphere.
At the mesopause, the temperature can be as low as -90oC.
This is the lowest 18 temperature anywhere in the entire terrestrial atmosphere.
The mesopause is located at an altitude of about 80 kilometres.
Meteors are found in the neighbourhood of the mesopause.
3.1.5 Thermosphere The thermosphere lies above the mesopause.
It extends to an altitude of about 500 kilometres.
The air in the thermosphere is extremely thin.
Large amounts of nitrogen and oxygen atoms are produced through the process of photo- dissociation of the dominant N and O molecules.
Above the mesopause, the 2 2 temperature increases dramatically to an overall maximum value that may exceed 1000K.
Beyond this point, the thermospheric temperature remains almost constant with altitude.
The thermosphere includes the ionized portion of the atmosphere called the ionosphere.

19 3.1.6 Exosphere The exosphere continues beyond the thermosphere.
The transition region between the thermosphere and the exosphere is known as the exobase.
The region above the exobase is still called the exosphere.
The exobase is located at a height of about 600km.
In this portion of the exosphere, the neutral densities are so low that collisions become unimportant.
For this reason, the upper atmosphere can no longer be characterized as fluid.
The space shuttle orbits around the Earth within this region of the exosphere.

3.2 Ionosphere 3.2.1 Layers of the Ionosphere The ionosphere is that part of a planetary atmosphere where ions and electrons are present in quantities sufficient to affect the propagation of radio waves.
The ionosphere extends from an altitude of about 60 kilometres to an altitude of about 2000 kilometres.
20 The composition of the atmosphere changes with height.
As a result, the ion production rate also changes with height.
This leads to the formation of the following three distinct ionization peaks: a) the D layer, b) the E layer, and c) the F layer.
The ionosphere is a very important region of the atmosphere because of its influence on radio waves.
3.2.2 D Layer The D layer is mainly responsible for the absorption of high frequency (HF) radio waves.
The absorption is strongest for radio frequencies below 10MHz.
The absorption becomes progressively smaller as the frequency increases.
The absorption is higher in the day and lower at night.
The ionization is due to Lyman series-alpha hydrogen radiation at a wavelength of 121.5 nanometre (nm) which ionizes nitric oxide NO.
Thus, the dominant ions are NO and O The D layer 2 extends in height from about 40km to 90km.
The electron density of the D layer is about 2.5109m3 in the day.
The electron density diminishes to a negligible value at night.
3.2.3 E Layer The E layer lies above the D layer.
It is the region of the ionosphere between an altitude of about 90km and an altitude of about 160km.
In relation to the solar zenith angle and solar activity, the electron density in the E layer behaves in a regular manner.
In the daytime, the electron density may reach about 21011m3.
This is high enough to reflect radio waves with frequencies of several megahertz.
21 At night, the electron density of the E region may decrease to about 1010m3.
The E region can only reflect radio waves that have frequencies lower that 10MHz.
The ionization is due to soft X-ray (1nm-10nm) and far ultraviolet (UV) solar radiations which ionize molecular oxygen O .
The dominant ions are O 2 2 and NO.
At night, the primary source of ionization is no longer there.
For that reason, the E layer begins to disappear.
An increase in the height of the E layer increases the range over which radio communication (through reflection) is possible (Fig.
2).
C H 2 2 H 1 Ground Ground R R2 1 F ig.
2: Increasing the height of the E layer (from H to H ) increases the range (from R to R ).
1 2 1 2 The E region peaks at an altitude of about 100km.
However, sporadic E propagation (Es) is also possible.
It is characterized by small clouds of intense ionization.
Such clouds can reflect radio waves ranging in frequency from about 25MHz to about 225MHz.
Sporadic-E events occur most frequently during the hot season.
Occasionally, the sporadic-E event may also occur during the cold season.
As a result of the sporadic-E events, some propagation channels (which 22 are generally unreachable) can open up.
This may last for just a few minutes.
It may also have an extended period of several hours.
3.2.4 F Layer The F layer lies above the E layer.
Its behaviour is fairly irregular.
It is usually classified into a number of anomalies such as the equatorial anomaly and the seasonal anomaly.
The day-time electron density is quite different from the night- time electron density.
In the day, the average peak value of the electron density is about 21012m3.
At night, the average peak value of the electron density falls to about 21011m3.
The F region is responsible for reflection of radio waves.
According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the F region extends to the magnetospheric shock boundary.
This magnetospheric shock boundary is several earth radii away.
However, some scientists believe that the F region stops at about 800km above the surface of the Earth.
When classified according to its composition, the atmosphere above this point is called the protonosphere.
When classified according to its dynamic property, the protonosphere is called the magnetosphere.
In the F region, the dominant ion is O.
In terms of high frequency (HF) communications, the F region is the most important part of the ionosphere.
Ionization of the atomic oxygen O is due to extreme ultraviolet solar radiation 10100nm.
The F region is thickest and most reflective of radio waves on the side of the Earth facing the Sun.
During the day, the F region splits into two layers.
These two layers are called the F and F layers.
Above the F region, 1 2 there is a region in which the density decreases exponentially with height.
This region is known as the topside ionosphere.
The topside ionosphere extends to an altitude of a few thousand kilometres.
23  The ionosphere is an extremely interesting medium.
In going from the D-region to the upper F region, the electron density varies over four orders of magnitude.
In the D region, the ionosphere manifests a collision-dominated behaviour.
Here, the electron collision frequency is as high as 8107 per second.
In the upper layer of the F region, the ionosphere manifests a collisionless behaviour.
As a result, the concept of frozen-in magnetic field becomes applicable.
The ionosphere exhibits non-linear properties due to the fact that the region is inhomogeneous and anisotropic.
The Luxembourg effect (or cross-modulation) is a good example of the non-linear properties of the ionosphere.
Idealized ionization profiles of the ionosphere are presented in Fig.
3.
The ionization profiles show how the electron density changes with height at temperate latitudes near sunspot maximum.

Auroras are the light produced when protons and electrons from the Sun travel along the Earth’s magnetic field lines above the North Pole (and above the South Pole) and excite neutral atoms and 24 molecules.
The aurora associated with the North Pole is sometimes called the northern lights; the aurora associated with the South Pole is sometimes called the southern lights.
The aurora is a spectacular display of lights requiring tens of thousands of volts to produce.
This fascinating display of energy takes place within the ionosphere (60-200km above the surface of the Earth).
In particular, the aurora borealis over northern Canada occurs at a height of about 100 kilometres.
The aurora is beautiful, spectacular, and splendid.
They appear in the form of majestic, colourful, irregular lights in the night sky.
The aurora has various shapes, colours and structures.
They appear almost every night in the sky of the north and south poles.
The aurora is a large-scale electrical discharge phenomenon in the high-altitude atmosphere, resulting from quantum leaps in oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
Above an altitude of about one hundred kilometres, oxygen and nitrogen atoms (and molecules) are energized and/or ionized by energetic electrons.
In the transition region between the Earth’s atmosphere and the near-Earth space, electrons are in abundance.
The electrons are accelerated to high energies by electric fields in the magnetosphere.
As the energetic electrons stream along the magnetic field lines, they strike and excite atoms and molecules of oxygen and nitrogen.
When these excited particles are de-excited, they emit the colourful radiation, known as aurora, over the polar sky.
The colour, shape and intensity of aurora depend on the nature of the electromagnetic forces that shoot the electrons downward into the upper atmosphere.
3.4 Solar Wind The surface of the Sun is like a pot of boiling water.
Bubbles of hot, electrified gas circulate from the interior to the surface of the Sun.
This gas is made of 25 electrons and protons in the fourth state of matter known as plasma.
As the circulation continues, the plasma continuously bursts out into space.
This steady stream of ionized plasma, which escapes from the solar corona and pervades the whole interplanetary space, is known as the solar wind.
Solar wind is mainly composed of electrons and protons.
However, about 10% of the solar wind are helium ions.
The solar wind induces geomagnetic activity by variation of its pressure and magnetic field.
At the orbit of the Earth, the solar wind has a density of about 10 particles per cubic centimetres, a temperature of about 10,000,000 K (equivalent to about 1 keV) and an average speed of about 500 km/sec.
In general, though, the solar wind blows with speeds ranging from 400km/sec to 2,500km/sec.
It carries a million tones of matter into space every second.
In particular, the solar wind carries mass away from the Sun at the rate of about 1.81027 erg/sec.
Yet, the effect of the solar wind remains negligible in the overall mass-energy balance of the Sun.
The magnetic fields from the Sun are embedded in the solar wind.
These magnetic fields have a strength of only about 10nT at the orbit of the Earth.
They are about 3,000 times weaker than the magnetic field of the Earth (at the surface of the Earth).
It is neither the mass nor the speed of the solar wind that makes it potent.
It is the energy stored in the plasma and the magnetic fields associated with the plasma that enable the solar wind to shape the protective magnetic shield of the Earth known as the magnetosphere.
Less than 1% of the solar wind actually penetrates the magnetosphere.
Yet, it is enough to generate millions of amps of electric current in our atmosphere.
It is also enough to cause occasional storms in the space around the Earth.
26 Every eleven years, the Sun reaches a peak period of activity called the solar maximum.
A few years later, a quiet period called the solar minimum follows suit.
The Sun-Earth system is driven by this 11-year solar cycle.
During the solar maximum, there are many sunspots, eruptive prominences, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
All these events have strong influence on communications and other technologies here on Earth.
3.5 Electromagnetic Coupling Electromagnetic coupling arises as a result of the interaction of the magnetized solar wind with the geomagnetic field of the Earth.
When a supersonic solar wind first encounters the geomagnetic field, a free-standing bow shock is formed.
As a result, the solar wind is deflected around the Earth in a region known as the magnetosheath (Fig 4).
The subsequent interaction of the magnetosheath flow with the geomagnetic field leads to the formation of the magnetopause.
Fig.
4: The interaction of plasma with the magnetosphere (after Moore, 1987).
27 The magnetopause is a relatively thin boundary layer that serves to separate the magnetic field of the solar wind (also known as interplanetary magnetic field, IMF) from the geomagnetic field.
The separation is accomplished by means of the current system of the magnetopause.
However, the magnetopause current layer does not provide a perfect shield.
This explains why a portion of the magnetic field of the solar wind penetrates the magnetopause and connects with the geomagnetic field (Fig.
4).
The connection of the IMF and the geomagnetic field occurs in a region known as the polar cap.
The connected field lines are referred to as open lines.
The intermediate region that lies between the polar region (i.e.
open field line region) and the low-latitude region is called the auroral oval.
3.6 Geomagnetic Storms and Substorms The magnetosphere is the near-Earth region of space where the dynamics are governed by the internal geomagnetic field.
The solar wind is a highly conducting, collisionless, magnetized plasma.
Its behaviour is governed by the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.
The solar wind magnetic field (or interplanetary magnetic field IMF) penetrates the magnetopause and connects with the geomagnetic field.
The aurora oval contains dipolar magnetic field lines.
The field lines are closed.
However, as the solar wind blows across the Earth, the dipolar magnetic field lines are distorted (Fig.
4).
On the dayside, the field lines are compressed.
On the nightside, the field lines are elongated to form a very long geomagnetic tail.
The geomagnetic tail plays a dominant role in the dynamic processes associated with the magnetosphere.
For instance, the geomagnetic tail acts as an energy reservoir that powers magnetospheric dynamic processes.
28 The magnetosphere has several distinct regions.
Each of the regions has its characteristic plasma properties.
The tail lobes at high latitudes are regions of low plasma density and low energy.
The plasma sheets are hot regions of high plasma density and high energy.
In the inner magnetosphere, large populations of high energy particles are trapped.
These trapped particles are electrons and ions.
They reside in the ring current and in the Van Allen radiation belts.
For this reason, the inner magnetosphere is the most hazardous region for technological systems.
The solar wind changes constantly, and the magnetosphere responds to such changes.
The dynamic response of the magnetosphere to varying conditions of the solar wind (and the interplanetary magnetic field) is called magnetospheric substorm.
During the periods of south wind IMF, the energy input is enhanced.
The energy extracted from the solar wind is stored in the form of magnetic energy in the magnetotail.
This defines the growth phase of the substrom.
About an hour later, the magnetotail becomes unstable, and the energy stored is dissipated in driving some highly dynamic magnetospheric processes.
After about four hours, the energy dissipation stops.
This marks the end of the substorm process.
Sometimes, large disturbances in the near-Earth space environment are caused by coherent solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field structures that originate from violent events (like coranal mass ejections or solar flares) from the Sun.
Such large disturbances in the near-Earth environment are called geomagnetic storms.
Geomagnetic storms are generally associated with major disturbances in the geomagnetic field and strong enhancement of the injection of energetic particles into the outer part of the Van Allen radiation belt.
Typically, the injected flux of ions has energies of the order of 100keV, while the injected flux of electrons has energies of the order of 100MeV.
29 Thus, a geomagnetic storm may be described as an intense disturbance of the Earth’s magnetosphere resulting from a sudden change in the dynamic pressure of the solar wind at the magnetopause.
The disturbance may propagate toward the lower altitudes, into the ionosphere, where a traveling ionospheric wave is set up.
3.7 Impact of Space Weather on Human Activity Space weather is defined in terms of the response of the near-Earth space environment to the violent and stormy events emanating from the Sun.
But, why do scientists study space weather?
It is an established fact that modern technological systems are vulnerable to the effects of some dynamic processes taking place in the Sun.
For instance, the geomagnetic storm of March 24, 1940 caused a temporary disruption of electrical services in New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Quebec and Ontario.
On the 9th and 10th days of February 1958, a geomagnetic storm caused a power transformer failure in the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.
On the 2nd day of August 1972, the following technical problems were reported: a) A 230,000-volt transformer at the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority exploded.
b) In Canada, the Minatoba Hydro recorded power drops from 164 to 44 megawatts (in a matter of minutes) in the power being supplied to Minnesota.
c) The Bureau of Reclamation Power Station in Water Town (South Dakota) was subjected to large swings in power line voltages upto 25,000 volts.
d) Wisconsin Power and Light reported voltage swings upto 25,000 volts.
e) Madison Gas and Electric reported voltage swings upto 25,000 volts.
f) Wisconsin Public Service Corporation also reported voltage swings upto 25,000 volts.
30 Obviously, these technical problems are traceable to hostile space weather.
Scientists study space weather in order to help protect both space-based and ground-based technical and biological systems.
The technical systems are all the bye-products of technology which are vulnerable to the harsh space environment.
The biological systems include humans as well as other living things that may be adversely affected by space weather.
Many scientists believe that solar activity affects more than just satellites and power grids.
For instance, the magnetic activity that accompanies sunspots and active regions can produce dramatic changes in the level of ultraviolent and soft X-ray emissions.
These changes are capable of altering the dynamics, temperature and chemistry in the affected layers.
This situation may affect the weather conditions of the Earth negatively.
As a result, humans may be directly affected.
It is therefore, important that we understand the Sun and the dynamic processes that give rise to space weather.
In this way, we can be better prepared to deal with all the adverse effects which space weather has on the Earth.

INTRODUCTION The terrestrial atmosphere contains gases, clouds and other air-bone particles called aerosols.
A gas may expand (or be compressed) in different ways.
A gas may also be heated (or be cooled) in different ways.
In this unit, you shall be introduced to two different processes involving expansion, compression, heating and cooling of a gas.
You shall also be introduced to the basic principles of thermodynamics.
40 2.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you shall be able to (i) discuss the first law of thermodynamics.
(ii) derive an expression for the work done by an ideal gas undergoing isothermal expansion.
(iii) derive the equation of a reversible adiabatic process.
(iv) discuss how temperature changes in an adiabatic process.
(v) describe the concept of enthalpy and internal energy of a system.
3.
BASIC CONCEPTS 3.1 First Law of Thermodynamics For a closed system that undergoes no changes in kinetic or potential energy, the differential form of the first law of thermodynamics states that QU W, where Q is the change in the heat content of the system, U is the change in the internal energy of the system, and W is the element of work done by the system.
The internal energy of the system U is given by U cT, v where c is the specific heat capacity of the gas at constant volume, and T is v the change in the temperature of the gas.
In general, the specific heat capacity at constant volume c is given by v U  c  ,   v  T  v where T is the temperature of the gas.
The element of work W done by the system is given by W  pV, 41 where p is the pressure of the gas, and V is the change in the volume of the same gas .
For an ideal gas, the equation of state is pV nRT, where n is the number of moles, R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature of the gas.
The parameter R is numerically equal to 8.314 J mol1K1.
In practice, a gas may expand (or be compressed) in different ways.
The gas may also be heated (or be cooled) in different ways.
In what follows, you shall be introduced to two different processes involving expansion, compression, heating and cooling of a gas.
The two process are the isothermal process and the adiabatic process.
3.2 Isothermal Process An isothermal process is one which takes place at constant temperature.
For one mole of an ideal gas, the equation of state may be written as pV RT, where symbols have their usual meanings.
In an isothermal process, the temperature T is constant.
Thus, the equation of state of an ideal gas undergoing isothermal process is pV k, where k is a constant.
Hence, you may write k p .
V This implies that the pV curve must be a rectangular hyperbola (Fig 1).
42  p T T 3 V T 2 1 Fig.
1: The pV curve of a gas undergoing isothermals process (T T T ).
1 2 3 In an isothermal expansion, work is done by the system on the surroundings.
The element of work W done by an ideal gas undergoing isothermal expansion is W  pV.
Therefore, the work done in expanding from V to V is 1 2 W dW V 2 W   pdV V 1 V 2RT  W   dV    V  V 1 V 2 dV W  RT V V 1 W RTlog VV2 e V 1 W RTlog V log V  e 2 e 1 V  W  RTlog  2 .
e V   1 43 The work W done by the gas is equal to the quantity of heat Q required to do the work.
Thus, the heat Q required is also given by V  Q RTlog  2 .
e V   1 Now, for an isothermal process, pV k, where k is a constant.
pV  pV 1 1 2 2 V p  2  1 V p 1 2 Hence, the work done, in an isothermal process, may also be written as  p  W QRTlog  1 .
e p   2 This quantity of heat Q must be supplied to the system that is doing work on the surroundings in order to keep the temperature constant.
Otherwise, the temperature of the system falls, and the process ceases to be isothermal.
In the case of an isothermal compression, work is done on the system by the surroundings.
In this case, the heat Q must be removed from the system in order to keep its temperature constant.
Otherwise, the temperature rises, and the process ceases to be isothermal.
Perfect isothermality is a highly idealized concept.
It is impossible to realize it in practice.
For instance, the heat Q cannot flow through the walls of the vessel unless there is a temperature difference across the walls.
Therefore, the temperature of the gas is bound to fall a little in an isothermal expansion.
Also, the temperature of the gas is bound to rise a little in an isothermal compression.
However, if the process is slow, and the gas is held in a thin, well-conducting 44 vessel surrounded by a constant-temperature bath, the process becomes approximately isothermal.
3.3 Adiabatic Process 3.3.1 Equation of Reversible Adiabatic Change An adiabatic process is one which takes place at constant heat.
In an adiabatic process, the temperature may change but no heat enters or leaves the system.
Consider an adiabatic process in which a unit mass of an ideal gas expands from an initial volume V to a final volume V .
The first law of thermodynamics implies 1 2 that the heat dQ supplied to the system is given by dQ= dU+ dW, (1) where dU is the increase in the internal energy of the system and dW is the external work done by the system.
You will recall that dU = c dT and dW = pdV, so that v dQ= c dT+ pdV, (2) v where c is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, dT is the rise in v temperature, dV is the increase in volume, and pis the pressure of the gas.
For a reversible adiabatic change dQ= 0.
Thus, Equation (2) reduces to c dT+ pdV = 0. v - pdV \ dT = .
(3) c v Recall that the equation of state for a unit mass of an ideal gas is pV = RT.
(4) 45  Differentiating Equation (4), you obtain pdV+Vdp= RdT pdV +Vdp \ dT = (5) R Equating the RHS of (5) to the RHS of (3), pdV +Vdp - pdV = R c v Cross-multiplying, you obtain c (pdV +Vdp)= - RpdV, v so that c (pdV +Vdp)+ RpdV = 0. v Hence, c pdV + cVdp+ RpdV = 0.
(6) v v But c and c are related to the gas constant R in the following way: p v R= c - c .
(7) p v Using (7) in (6), you get c pdV + cVdp+ (c - c )pdV = 0 p v p v c pdV + cVdp+ c pdV- c pdV = 0. v v p v cVdp+ c pdV = 0. v p c Vdp+ p pdV = 0. c v If you set g= c c , you obtain p v Vdp+ gpdV = 0.
Dividing each term by pV, you get dp dV + g = 0. p V 46 Integrating, you find that dp dV ò + gò = constant.
p V or log p+ glog V = a, e e where a is a constant.
Applying the elementary laws of logarithm, you obtain log p+ log Vg = a e e or log (pVg)= a e That is, pVg = ea where a is a constant.
Therefore, you may write: pVg = constant, (8) since a is a constant.
Equation (8) is the equation of a reversible adiabatic process.
3.3.2 Temperature Change in an Adiabatic Process Recall that the general gas equation is pV = RT (1) so that RT p= V and æRTö pVg = çççè V ÷÷÷÷ø.Vg 47 i.e.
pVg = RTVgV- 1 or pVg = RTVg-1.
(2) But the equation of an adiabatic process is pVg = constant, \ RTVg-1 = constant.
(3) Equation (3) is the equation for an adiabatic temperature change.
3.4.3 Work Done in an Adiabatic Process The work W done by a unit mass of gas undergoing adiabatic expansion is given by V 2 W = ò pdV (1) V 1 Since the process is adiabatic, it follows that pVg = b (2) where b is a constant given by b = ea.
Thus, p= bV- g (3) Hence, the work W becomes V 2 W = òbV- gdV V 1 V 2 W = bòV- gdV V 1 éV- g+1 ùV2 W = b ê ú ê- g+1ú ë û V 1 48 b W = (V1-g- V1-g) (4) 1- g 2 1 Now, Equation (4) states that p= bV- g, so that pV = bV- g×V or pV = bV- g+1.
(5) Expanding (4), you obtain 1 W = (bV1-g- bV1-g), 1- g 2 1 so that 1 W = (pV - pV) (6) 1- g 2 2 1 1 since, pV = bV- g+1.
Equation (6) represents the work W done by the system when a unit mass of an ideal gas expands adiabatically from some initial volume V to a final volume V .
1 2 3.5 Enthalpy and Internal Energy Recall that the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as follows: dQ= dU+ pdV.
(1) If the pressure p is constant then there is really no difference between pdV and d(pV).
For instance, d(pV)= pdV +Vdp, and if the pressure p is constant, then dp= o 49 so that d(pV)= pdV + 0.
Thus, for a constant-pressure process, d(pV)= pdV.
(2) In this case, the first law of thermodynamics becomes dQ= dU+ d(pV).
dQ= déU+ (pV)ù. ë û This implies that dQ= d(U+ pV).
By defining a new thermodynamic property H such that.
H = U+ pV, (3) you find that, at constant pressure, dQ= dH.
This new thermodynamic property H is called the enthalpy of the system.
It follows, therefore, that dH = c dT.
(4) p You may wish to compare Equation (4) with the expression for the change in the internal energy dU of the system, namely, dU = c dT.
(5) v Equation (5) shows that the specific heat capacity at constant volume c may be v written as: æ¶Uö cv = çççè¶T ø÷÷÷÷ .
(6) V Equation (4) shows that the specific heat capacity at constant pressure c may p be written as 50 æ¶Hö cp = çççè¶T ø÷÷÷÷ .
(7) p These principal specific heat capacities play a significant role in the treatment of air and water vapour.
3.6 Specific Heats for Ideal Gases A useful relation exists between the principal specific heats and the universal gas constant R. This relation may be expressed as follows: R= c - c (1) p v You had earlier met this relation in your study of the equation of an adiabatic process.
In what follows, you shall be introduced to a method of deriving the above relation.
You will recall that the change in the internal energy of a system is given by dU = c dT.
(2) v Also, the change in the enthalpy of the system is dH = c dT.
(3) p If Eq.
(2) is subtracted from Eq.
(3), you obtain dH- dU = c dT- c dT.
p v or dH- dU = (c - c )dT.
(4) p v But, dH = dU+ d(pV).
i.e.
dH = dU+ d(RT), since pV = RT.
51 \ dH- dU = RdT (5) Comparing (4) and (5), you find that RdT = (c - c )dT p v or R= c - c .
p v The equation given above shows that the difference of the principal specific heat capacities is numerically equal to the gas constant.
For air at room temperature, the molecular weight M = 28.97, c = 1.005KJ kg.oC, c = 0.718KJ kg.oC, R= 287.1J kg.K and g= 1.4. p v For water vapour at room temperature, the molecular weight M = 18.02, c = 1867J kgoC, c = 1407J kg.oC, R= 460.6J kg.K and g= 1.33. p v 3.7 Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics The second law of thermodynamics may be stated in any of the following ways: a) It is impossible to construct a device which operates in cycle and whose sole effect is to transfer heat from a cooler body to a hotter body.
(This is the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics).
b) It is impossible to construct a device which operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the production of work and exchange of heat with a single reservoir.
(This is the Kelvin-Plank statement of the second law of thermodynamics).
Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics shows heat flows from a high-temperature region to a low temperature region in the absence of other effects.
Thus, when a hot body is brought into contact with a cold body, the hot 52 body becomes less hot and cold body becomes less cold.
It is not possible for the cold body (in contact with a hot body) to be become more cold unless additional effects are brought to bear upon the system.
Kelvin-Plank statement shows that it is not possible to construct a device which will operate continuously while receiving heat from a single reservoir and producing an equivalent amount of work.
Thus, a perpetual-motion machine cannot be built.
In general, any quantity which may be represented as an exact differential is a property (or point) function.
This means that the quantity is a function of the state of the system.
If the cyclic integral of a differential vanishes, then the differential is an exact differential.
dQ It turns out that, for a reversible process, the cyclic integral of is zero.
That is, T ædQö òÑçççè T ø÷÷÷÷ = 0. reversible dQ Thus, the quantity is an exact differential which may be denoted by ds.
In this T case, dQ ds= , T where s is another new property of the system called entropy.
It is important to note that entropy is so defined only for reversible processes.
For such a reversible process a change in entropy may be with written as a2ædQö Vs= s2- s1= òçççè T ø÷÷÷÷ , a1 reversible 53 where a and a are, respectively, the appropriate lower and upper limits of the 1 2 integration.
Here, a and a are two state points associated with the process.
1 2 In general, a 2 dQ s - s ³ ò , 2 1 T a 1 where the equality holds for a reversible process and the inequality holds for an irreversible process.
A reversible process is an idealized state path.
A process is said to be reversible if the initial state of the system can be restored following exactly the same state path in reverse direction with no observable effects on the system and its surroundings.
In practice, it is impossible to find a perfectly reversible process.
Since all real life processes are irreversible, we conclude that the entropy is always greater than zero.
4.

You have seen the difference between an isothermal process and an adiabatic process.
You have found how the enthalpy of a system relates to its internal energy.
You have also noted that the entropy of any real-life process is always greater than zero.

INTRODUCTION The air we breath is a very useful gas.
The water we drink is a very useful liquid.
Without air and water, it would be impossible for any living thing to survive on 63 Earth.
In this unit, you shall be introduced to some of the most important properties of air, water and water vapour.
2.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you shall be able to (i) describe the different elements that make up the air.
(ii) describe the porperties of air and water vapour at room temperature.
(iii) discuss the saturation regions using a pT diagram.
(iv) distinguish between moisture and quality of the liquid-vapour saturation region.
(v) relate the internal energy, enthalpy and entropy to the temperature and specific volume of a pure substance.
3.
MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 The Air Around Us The air we breathe is readily available near the surface of the Earth.
It is made up of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.9%) and other gases (0.1%).
At room temperature, the mean molecular weight of air, M = 28.97; the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, c = 1.005kJkg-1K-1; the specific heat capacity at p constant volume; c = 0.718kJkg-1K-1; the gas constant, R= 287.1Jkg- 1K- 1; and the v c ratio of the principal specific heat capacities, g = p = 1.4. c v For water vapour at room temperature, the molecular weight, M = 18.02; the specific heat capacity at constant pressure c = 1867 Jkg- 1K- 1; the specific heat p 64 capacity at constant volume, c = 1407 Jkg-1K-1; the gas constant, v R= 460.6Jkg- 1K- 1; and the ratio of the principal specific heat capacities, c g = p = 1.33. c v 3.2 Water and its Vapour Ordinary water may exist in seven phases, namely, (i) a pure solid phase known as ice; (ii) a pure liquid phase commonly known as water; (iii) a pure vapour phase called steam; (iv) an equilibrium mixture of liquid and vapour phases , (v) an equilibrium mixture of liquid and solid phases; and (vi) an equilibrium mixture of solid and vapor phases.
(vii) an equilibrium mixture of solid, liquid and vapour phases.
Fusion takes place when a solid changes to a liquid; vaporization takes place when a liquid changes to a vapour; sublimation takes place when a solid changes directly to a vapour.
(At atmospheric pressure, the sublimation temperature for CO is about -780C).
2 3.3 Macroscopic Properties of Pure Water Consider a piece of ice at state point S. If the piece of ice is heated at constant pressure the temperature rises until the fusion line is reached.
As soon as the fusion line is encountered, melting starts.
The melting process continues at constant temperature until all the solid ice is changed to liquid.
Further heating produces an increase in the temperature.
The temperature of the liquid water continues to rise until the vaporization line is encountered.
As soon as the vaporization line is reached, the liquid water begins to change to vapour.
65  Figure 2 demonstrates how water behaves when its temperature and pressure change.
The pressure p is atmospheric.
The horizontal line, passing through 0 the solid phase (S), the liquid phase (L) and the vapour phase (V), is a constant- pressure line.
It shows that water at atmospheric pressure may be made to exist in solid, liquid and vapour phases.
p Fusion line GAS Critical point e ur LIQUID B Pressp0 AS L V Vaporization SOLID line Triple point Sublimation line VAPOUR T Temperature Fig.
2: Pressure-temperature diagram for water (after Holman, 1980).
The vaporization process continues at constant temperature until all the liquid water is changed to water vapour.
Additional heating produces a rise in the temperature of the vapour.
At atmospheric pressure, the fusion temperature for water is 0oC and the vaporization temperature is 100oC.
Figure 2 also shows that the freezing point is altered by a change in pressure.
An increase in pressure lowers the freezing point.
Figure 2 also shows that a change in pressure alters the vaporization point.
In particular, an increase in pressure raises the vaporization temperature of water.
66  The p- T diagram shown in Fig.
2 is not drawn to scale.
In practice, the fusion line is almost vertical and a large increase in pressure is needed to lower the melting temperature substantially.
The solid-liquid mixture is represented by the fusion line; the liquid-vapour mixture is represented by the vapour line; and the solid-vapour mixture is represented by the sublimation line.
The triple point is the state point where it is possible to maintain an equilibrium mixture of the solid phase, the liquid phase and the vapour phase.
At the triple point, all the three phases of water co-exist in equilibrium.
At the critical point, the pure vapour phase has identical properties with a pure liquid phase at the same temperature and pressure.
The surface meniscus separating the liquid phase from the vapour phase vanishes at the critical point.
At super-critical temperatures and pressure, it is no longer possible to observe a distinction between the liquid phase and the vapour phase.
3.4 Saturation Regions 3.4.1 Liquid-Vapour Saturation Region The fusion line, the vaporization line and the sublimation line represent saturation regions.
The fusion line represents the saturation region between the solid phase and the liquid phase; the vaporization line designates the saturation region between the liquid phase and the vapour phase; the sublimation line represents the saturation region between the solid phase and the vapour phase.
The vapour present in such a mixture is called a saturated vapour.
In the saturation regions, the temperature and the pressure remain constant.
However, there is a significant change in the specific volume (i.e volume per unit mass) in the saturation regions.
67 To quantify the properties of the liquid-vapour saturation region, we define the quality x of the saturation region as the fraction of mass present in the vapour phase.
We also define the moisture y as the fraction of mass present in the liquid phase.
Obviously, the sum of the two fractions must be equal to unity.
Therefore, we may write.
x+ y= 1 or y= 1- x (1) or Moisture = 1- x, where mass in the vapour phase x= total mass m 3.4.2 Wet Mixture A wet mixture is a liquid-vapour mixture that has a quality x which is less than 100%.
The subscripts s,l and v shall be used to represent solid phase, liquid phase and vapour phase, respectively.
The lower-case “v” shall also be used to designate specific volume (i.e v= V m).
This means that the specific volume of a saturated liquid becomes v while the specific volume of a saturated vapour l becomes v .
Of course, the total volume V is given by v V = mv + mv , (2) l l v v and the total mass mis given by m= m + m , l v so that the specific volume v of an equilibrium liquid-vapour mixture would be given by 68 V v= , (3) m where m is mass of the liquid phase and m is mass of the vapour phase.
Thus, l v mv + m v v= l l v v m m m v= l v + v v m l m v or v= yv + xv .
l v v= (1- x)v + xv , l v where x= m m and y= m m. v l Hence, v= v - xv + xv , l l v or v= v + (v - v )x. l v l Thus, v= v + xv , (4) l lv where, v = v - v. (5) lv v l Equation (4) relates the specific volume (v) to the specific volume in the liquid phase (v ), the specific volume in the vapour phase (v ) and the quality (x) of the l v saturation region.
3.4.3 Super-Cooled Liquid and Super-Heated Vapour A compressed liquid is one which exists at a temperature that is lower than the saturation temperature corresponding to its pressure.
A compressed liquid is also called a sub-cooled liquid.
A Superheated vapour is one that exists at a 69 temperature greater than the saturation temperature corresponding to its pressure.
3.4.4 Energy Properties of a Pure Substance How many independent properties are necessary to define the state of a simple, pure substance?
Only two independent properties are necessary to define the state of a simple, pure substance.
The two independent properties are temperature and specific volume.
Why not pressure?
In the saturation regions, temperature and pressure are not independent properties.
Infact, a line of constant temperature is also a line of constant pressure in all the saturation regions.
Temperature, pressure and specific volume are not the only properties of interest when considering pure substances.
Other important properties include the specific internal energy u and the specific enthalpy h. These energy properties may be expressed as functions of temperature T and specific volume v in the following why: u= u(T,v), and h= h(T,v).
Equation (4) relates the specific volume v to v ,v and x since l v v= v + xv l lv in the wet mixture region.
By a similar argument, you may write u= v + xv (6) l lv and h= h + xh (7) l lv in the wet mixture region.
Here, 70  u = u - u (8) lv v l and h = h - h, (9) lv v l where u is the internal energy of vaporization and h is the enthalpy of lv lv vaporization.

Finally, the entropy s is another property that is extremely useful in solving practical problems.
Like the specific internal energy u and the specific enthalpy h, the entropy s may be written in the characteristic form s= s + xs , (10) l lv where s = s - s, (11) lv v l 71 and s is the entropy of vaporization.
lv All these properties of a pure-substance are usually tabulated.
In order to solve a practical problem, it is often necessary to consult appropriate tables.
Typical values may be found in Table 1.
Exercise (1) Given that the pressure is 150kPa and that the quality is 1%, determine.
(i) the specific volume v, (ii) the enthalpy h, and (iii) the entropy s of water.
Solution (1) (a) The saturation region has 1% quality at 150kPa.
We therefore consult Table 1 to obtain the following values: v = 1.0528´ 10- 3m3kg- 1 l v = 1.159m3kg-1 v h = 467.11kJkg-1 l h = 2226.5kJkg- 1 lv s = 1.4336kJkg-1K-1 l s = 7.2233kJkg-1K-1 v The quality x= 1%= 0.01.
(i) The specific volume v is v= v + xv , l lv where 72 v = v - v .
w v l Thus, \ v= (1.0528´ 10-3)+ (0.01)(1.159- 1.0528´ 10-3) v= (1.0528´ 10- 3)+ (0.01)(1.1579472) v= 0.012632272 \ v» 0.0126.
(ii) The specific enthalpy h is h= h + xh l lv h= 467.11+ (0.01)(2226.5) h= 467.11+ 22.265 \ h= 489.375 (iii) The entropy s is s= s + xs l lv s= 1.4336+ (0.01)(7.2233- 1.4336) s= 1.4336+ (0.01)(5.7897) s= 1.4336+ 0.057897 s= 1.491497 \ s» 1.4915 4.

The lower atmosphere and the upper atmosphere.
The lower atmosphere starts from the ground and stops at a height of about 100 kilometres.
The upper atmosphere starts from a height of about 100 kilometres to the near-Earth spaces.
However, each region may be sub-divided into different layers.
In this unit, you shall be introduced the dynamics of the neutral atmosphere.
2.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you shall be able to (i) classify the atmosphere into various distinct layers.
(ii) derive an expression for the vertical diminution of pressure with height.
(iii) discuss the density profile in the lower atmosphere.
(iv) relate the partial pressure of a saturated water vapour to temperature, latent heat and specific gas constant of the water vapour.
(v) discuss the effects of the troposphere on radio wave propagation.
3 MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 Layers of the Atmosphere The atmosphere of the Earth may be classified in terms of (i) temperature, (ii) ionization, (iii) magnetic field, and (iv) radio wave propagation.
86 In terms of temperature, the atmosphere may be classified into four distinct layers, namely (i) the troposphere, (ii) the stratosphere, (iii) the mesosphere, and (v) the thermosphere.
In terms of magnetic field the atmosphere may be classified into two layers, namely (i) the dynamosphere, and (ii) the magnetosphere.
In terms of radio wave propagation, the terrestrial atmosphere may be classified into two (i) the troposphere, and (ii) the ionosphere.
The ionosphere is a dispersive medium in which propagation is frequency dependents.
The troposphere is a non-dispersive medium that is largely neutral.
Table 1 shows one possible classification scheme for the terrestrial atmosphere.

3.2 The Governing Equations 3.2.1 Equation of State In order to discuss the neutral atmosphere effectively, you need to have a good understanding of (i) the equation of state (gas equation), (ii) the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, and (iii) Snell’s law.
Charles’ law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas is directly proportional to its temperature, provided that the pressure remains constant.
Thus, at 88 1 constant-pressure, all gases expand by a constant amount (equal to of the 273 volume at 0oC) for every 1oC rise in temperature.
This is known as Charles’ constant-pressure law.
Conversely, if the volume is kept constant, all gases  1  equal to of their pressure at 0oC for every 1oC undergo an increase in pressure    273  rise in temperature.
This is known as Charles’ constant-volume law.
Thus, Charles’ law states that the ratio of volume to temperature of a fixed mass of gas is constant i.e.
V constant, T provided that the pressure remains constant.
Boyles’ law states that the volume of a fixed mass gas is inversely proportional to its pressure, provided that the temperature remains constant.
Thus, at constant temperature the product of pressure and volume remains constant.
This implies that pV constant.
In the light of these laws, the equation of state for an ideal gas may be formulated as follows: pV nkT 1 where p is pressure V is volume, n is number of molecules, T is absolute temperature and k is Boltzmann constant.
You may, however, choose to define the temperature T (in energy units) such that T kT.
In this case, the equation of state reduces to pV nT, or 89   n  p T. 2   V  By defining the number density N as the number of molecules per unit volume, you obtain n N  .
3 V Hence, Eq.
(2) may be written, in the light of Eq.
(3), as p NT, 4 where N is the number density.
3.2.2 Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium expresses the balance between the gravitational force at any point and the pressure gradient at that point.
Thus, the hydrostatic equation may be expressed as dp g, 5 dz where p is the pressure,  is the mass density, g is the acceleration due to gravity and z is the height.
Equation (5) implies that the change in pressure dp may be expressed as dpgdz.
6 Equations(4) and (6) imply that dp gdz  p NT or dp dz  7 p H 90  where the scale height H is given by NT H  .
8 g The scale height H may be defined in terms of the mean molecular mass m at any given height.
Noting that the total mass M of the molecules is given by M V, you find that nmV , 9 since M nm.
Equation (9) indicates that the mean molecular mass m is given by V  m 10    n  Equation (3) and (10) show that the mean molecular mass m is given by  m .
11 N Equation (8) may now be rewritten as  N T  H      g or  1 T  H  .
   m g Therefore, the scale height H may be written as T H  , 12 mg where m is the mean molecular mass at a given height.
By integrating Eq.
(7) from some reference height z  z at a pressure p p  to an o o arbitrary height zat a pressure p, you obtain the following: 91 p dp z dz   p H p z o o z dz ln pp  po H z o z dz ln pIn p  o H z o  p  z dz ln   p H   o z o p  z dz exp  p  H  o  z  o  z dz p p exp .
13 o  H   z  o Equation (13) shows how the pressure p varies with height z .
It shows that the pressure decreases exponentially with height.
Clearly, a large scale height is associated with the low-pressure regions of the atmosphere.
Equation (13) may also be used to find the distribution of the number density with height.
You will recall that p NT 4 so that , at some reference point where p p and T T , the number density o o N is given by the expression o p  N T .
o o o Hence, you can take appropriate ratios to obtain p NT  , p N T o o o so that 92  NT  p p  .
14 o N T   o o But, Eq (13) shows that the pressure p is given by  z dz p p exp , 13 o  H   z  o so that Eq.
(13) assumes the form  NT   z dz p   p exp  o N T o  H   o o   z  o or  N T   z dz N  o o exp  15  T   H   z  o Equation (15) shows that the number density N diminishes exponentially with height too.
It indicates that a large scale height is associated with a light gas.
In an isothermal atmosphere the temperature remains constant and the scale height becomes constant too.
In consequence, Eq.
(13) reduces to  zz  p p exp  0 , 16   0 H   where p is the pressure at some reference height z .
0 0 Also, in an isothermal atmosphere, the temperature remains constant so that T T .
In this case, Eq.
(15) reduces to o  zz  N  N exp  0 , 17   o H   where N is the number density at some reference height z .
0 93 3.2.3 Snell’s Law Snell’s law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant.
That constant is a measure of the refractive index.
When a radio signal passes through the atmosphere, its direction changes due to refraction.
Consider a neutral atmosphere that is horizontally stratified into m layers.
If the ionospheric refraction is neglected then the total change in the direction of a radio signal passing through the atmosphere can be found by repeatedly applying Snell’s law to each layer of the atmosphere (Fig.
2).
In this case, Snell’s law is given by n sin sin .

3.2.4 Water Vapour The troposphere contains both water vapour and dry air.
The amount of water vapour varies with time and location.
On the other hand, the composition of dry air does not vary significantly with height.
To understand water vapour one needs to have a good knowledge of some vapour-related quantities like 94 (i) mixing ratio, (ii) partial pressure of vapour, and (iii) relative humidity.
3.2.5 Mixing Ratio A mixture of dry air and water vapour is called moist air.
The mixing ratio gives a measure of the amount of moisture in the air.
The mixing ratio w is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapour to the mass of dry air.
Thus, m m  V  m  m   w v  v   v  d  v , 1 m  V m   V   V   d d d where  is density of water vapour and  is density of dry air.
v d The equation of state holds for a fixed mass of gas.
It also holds for a mixture of gases.
Now, the equation of state pV RT 2 can be written in terms of the specific volume and the specific gas constant for the ith gas as follows: pV mRT 3 i i where R is the specific gas constant and m is the mean molecular mass of the i i R ith gas.
Of course, the specific gas constant R  , where R is the universal i m i gas constant.
Equation (2) can also be re-written in terms of the specific volume as follows: pV mRT, i i or 95 m  p i RT,    V  i or pRT, 4 i i m where  is the density of the ith gas defined by  i .
Thus, the pressure p i i V may be written as pRT.
i i V 1 (Note that the specific volume v is mass per unit volume i.e.
v   ).
i i m  i i If this new version of the equation of state is applied to water vapour, you obtain eRT 5 v v where e is the partial pressure of water vapour.
If the same version of the equation of state is applied to dry air, you get p  peR T 6 d d d where p is the total pressure of the moist air and R is the specific gas constant d of dry air.
The mixing ratio may therefore be defined in the light of equations(5) and (6).
From Eq.
(5), you see that e   .
7 v RT v From Eq.
(6), you find that pe   .
8 d R T d But, the mixing ratio  w v 9  d 96 or e pe w  , RT R T v d or e R T w  d , RT pe v or eR w d , R pe v or e w , 10 pe where  is the ratio of the specific gas constant for dry air to the specific gas  R  constant for vapour i.e.
 d .
R   v Experiments show that the specific gas constants R and R are given by d v R 23706001Jkg1K1, d and R 4615250003Jkg1K1, v so that R  d 0622.
11 R v The partial pressure of water vapour is typically about 1% of the total pressure of the moist air.
It can be shows that mixing ratio w is roughly equal to the specific humidity q i.e.
wq.
97 3.3 Saturation Region 3.3.1 Partial Pressure of Saturated Air In a closed system, equilibrium will be established when the number of water molecules passing from the liquid phase to the vapour phase is equal to the number of water molecules passing from the vapour to the liquid phase.
Any vapour that meets this requirement is called a saturated vapour.
A mixture of vapour and air under equilibrium conditions is called a saturated air.
When a saturated air comes in contact with an unsaturated air, diffusion begins to take place.
Molecules of water move from areas of higher concentration of water vapour to areas of lower concentration of water vapour.
The partial pressure of a saturated water vapour depends on the temperature.
A warm air can contain large amounts of water vapour.
When the warm air is cooled, the surplus of the water vapour (over and above the saturation value) at the new temperature condenses to form water.
The condensation process leads to energy release.
The energy released per unit mass is equal to the latent heat of vaporization.
Two more latent heats exist: the latent heat of fusion and the latent heat of sublimation.
The latent heat of fusion is the energy required to change a unit mass of ice to liquid water at the same temperature.
The latent heat of sublimation is the sum of the latent heat of fusion and the latent heat of vaporization.
By extension of Eq.
(10), the saturation mixing ratio w may be defined as sat e w  sat 13 sat pe sat If the total pressure p is significantly higher than the saturated partial pressure e of the water vapour then the saturation mixing ratio becomes 98 e w  .
14 sat p The relative humidity r is the ratio of the mixing ratio to the saturation mixing h ratio.
Thus, provided that p is large compared with both e and esat, the relative r humidity h is given by  e   e  r   sat  h  p  p  e p   p e sat e  .
e sat hence, w e r    15 h w e sat sat It is often necessary to express the relative humidity in percentage.
In this case the two expressions for relative humidity become: 100w 100e r  % %, 16 h w e sat sat where r is the relative humidity and p is large compared with both eand e .
h sat 3.3.2 Propagation Delay The condition of the troposphere has a profound effect on radio wave propagation.
A radio signal suffers delay by a neutral atmosphere.
The total delay depends on the refractivity along the path of the radio signal.
The refractivity itself depends on primary parameters like temperature and pressure.
99 Fermat’s principle is the basic physical law governing radio wave propagation.
Fermat’s principle shows that light and other electromagnetic waves will follow a path between two points which involves the least travel time.
To understand this, let us define the optical (or electromagnetic) distance S between the source and the receiver as: S cdt, 19 where c is the speed of light and t is time.
Let us also define the electromagnetic path s as: svdt, 20 where v is the propagation speed given by ds v .
21 dt Now, the refractive index n of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in free space to the speed of light in the medium i.e.
c n , 22a v or c v , 22b n where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v is the speed of light in the medium.
Equations (21) and (22) indicate that ds c  , dt n so that ndscdt, 100 and, therefore, c nsds dscdt.
23 v Equations (19), (22) and (23) show that the electromagnetic distance c S cdt nsds ds.
24 v The excess path length D caused by the troposphere is given by   Dnsdsdsdsdl .
25     s l The excess path length D is also called the delay.
It is measured in the slant direction caused by the troposphere.
The right-hand side of Eq.
(25) is the sum of two excess path lengths: the first term represents the excess length caused by the propagation delay; the second term represents the excess path length caused by the bending of the radio signal.
3.3.3 Refractivity N The refractive index n is always a small number (in the neighbourhood of 1).
It is often more convenient to work with a parameter with large spread.
For that reason, the refractivity N is often used.
In relation to the refractive index n, the refractivity N is defined by the expression N n1106.
27 Evidently, the range of values of the refractivity can be much more manageable than the corresponding range of values of the refractive index.
For instance, in the ionosphere the values of refractivity N ranges from zero to about 300, 101 whereas the values of the refractive index n remains clustered in the neigbourhood of unity.
The neutral atmosphere contains both dry air and water vapour.
For this reason, the refractivity N can be split into a dry air component and a water vapour component.
Thus, we may write N N N , 28 d v where N is the refractivity of dry air and N is the refractivity of water vapour.
d v This is a wise decision since the dry air content remains nearly constant in time whereas the water vapour content varies widely in time and space.
For frequencies upto 20GHz, the refractivity may be written, as a function of temperature and partial pressure, in the following manner:  p  N  k d Z1, 29   d  1 T  d and  e e  N  k k Z1, 30   v  2 T 3T2  v where Z is the compressibility factor of dry air, Z is the compressibility factor  v for water vapour and k i1,2,3are dimensional constants.
The unit of k and k i 1 2 is Kelvin per millibar; K mbar1.
The unit of k is Kelvin squared per millibar 3 K2 mbar1.
For an ideal gas, the compressibility factor is equal to 1.
Any departure of Z from unity accounts for the non-ideal behaviour of the affected gas.
Fortunately, the compressibility factor for both dry air and water vapour is roughly equal to 1, so that Z Z 1.
d v 102 Thus, dry air and water vapour may be treated as ideal gases.
In this case, Eqs (29) and (30) reduce to p N k d , 31 d 1 T and e e N k k , 32 v 2T 3T2 respectively .
Above the troposphere, there is practically no more water vapour.
Thus, at high altitudes the contribution of the wet refractivity to the total refractivity becomes small.
This is so because, the wet refractivity drops much faster than the dry refractivity as the height increases.
The propagation delay depends on both the refractivity and the path of the radio signal.
In turn, the refractivity depends on both temperature and pressure.
We therefore require adequate information on the temperature and the pressure in order to determine the propagation delay.
4 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have been introduced to different ways of classifying the atmosphere into distinct layers.
You have seen how the equation of state and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium may be used to derive expressions that give the pressure and the density profiles.
You found that the partial pressure of water vapour is about 1% of the total pressure of a moist air.
You also found that the mixing ratio is roughly equal to the specific humidity.
Finally, you have seen that the refractivity depends on both temperature and pressure.
In turn, the 103 propagation delay depends on both the refractivity and the path of the radio signal.

INTRODUCTION A wealth of information is available on the electromagnetic spectrum of gas clouds and stellar atmospheres.
The electromagnetic spectrum of interest ranges from metre radio waves (i.e.
photons with energies less than 10- 6eV) to hard X- rays and g- rays(i.e.
photons with energies greater than 106eV).
As radiation travels through a gas cloud or stellar atmosphere, its intensity changes.
The change in intensity of the radiation depends on a number of factors.
In this unit, you shall be introduced to the basic spectroscopic concepts and radiation transfer mechanisms.
114  2.
OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you shall be able to (i) distinguish between intensity and flux, and relate luminosity to flux.
(ii) derive the equation of radiative transfer.
(iii) discuss the concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).
(iv) apply the LTE approximation of the equation of radiative transfer to radio waves.
3.
BASIC CONCEPTS 3.1 Meaning of Radiative Transfer How does the flow of radiative energy change as one moves through a gas that emits and absorbs radiation?
How can one predict the spectrum that emerges from a given gas cloud or stellar atmosphere as a function of direction and frequency?
How can one produce a model of the cloud or stellar atmosphere, for a given energy input, in order to be able to predict how the temperature runs through the cloud or stellar atmosphere?
These are some the questions which scientists workings on radiative transfer seek to answer.
3.2 Intensity, and Flux Intensity and flux are the two fundamental measures of energy flow.
Intensity is the energy flow in a particular direction through a unit area per unit time per unit solid angle, where the unit area is perpendicular to the chosen direction defined by the solid angle.
Flux is the net energy flow through a unit area per unit time, summed over all directions, where the unit area is fixed as being perpendicular to the direction in which the net flow of radiation is proceeding.
Thus, the flux is obtained by summing the intensity over all directions.
115  For an isotropic intensity, the positive and negative contributions will cancel out reducing the flux to zero.
Quantitatively, the flux F and the intensity I are related by the expression F = òIcosqdW (1) where dW is an element of the solid angle, and q is the angle between the fixed direction defined by flux and the variable direction defined by the intensity.
The intensity is measured per unit area perpendicular to the line of sight.
The flux is measured per unit area perpendicular to the fixed direction of the net flow of energy (Fig.
1).
This explains why a projection factor (cosq) appears in Eq.(1).
Flux Intensity d  Unit area Fig.
1: Flux and intensity Scientists are usually interested in monochromatic intensities and fluxes e.g.
intensity per unit frequency interval at the frequency v. Here, such specific intensities and fluxes are denoted by I and F respectively.
The quantities I n n and I are related by the following integral: n 116 I = òI dn.
(2) n By solving for intensity as a function of direction and integrating, you obtain the net flow of radiation (i.e flux) proceeding from a stellar atmosphere or gas cloud.
3.3 Luminosity L The luminosity L of a star is closely related to the flux F .
Consider a spherical star of radius R. If the flux evaluated at the surface is F , then the luminosity L is given by L= 4pR2F Thus, for a point object at a distance d, the luminosity is given by L= 4pd2F, so that the flux becomes L F = .
4pd2 In the case of an extended object, resolved in angle by the telescope, the intensity received from various parts of the body is called the surface brightness of the object.
If the object has uniform surface brightness, then the intensity is independent of distance.
3.4 Radiative Transfer Equation Consider a pencil of radiation of frequency n traveling in the atmosphere.
As the radiation travels a distance ds, its specific intensity changes according to the expression.
dI = e ds- k ds, (3) n n n where  is the emission coefficient,  is the absorption coefficient and I is the v v v specific intensity.
The optical depth t along a direction r is defined by the equation n 117  dt = - k dr, (4) n n where r makes an angle q with ds.
Now, you can write dt - k = n (5) n dr on account of Eq (4).
Using Eq (5) in Eq (3), you get ædt ö dIn = ends+ çççè drn÷÷÷÷øInds (6) The presence of the projection factor cosq implies that dr= cosqds (7) Using Eq(7) in Eq (6), you find that æ dt ö dIn = ends+ çççècosqndsø÷÷÷÷Inds or æ 1 ö dIn = ends+ çççècosq÷÷÷÷øIndtn Dividing each term by dt , you obtain n dI ds æ 1 ö dtn = en dt + çççècosq÷÷÷÷øIn.
(8) n n Eq (7) implies that æ 1 ö ds= çççècosq÷÷÷÷ødr (9) Using Eq (9) in Eq (8), you get dI æ 1 ö dr æ 1 ö dtn = ençççècosqø÷÷÷÷dt + èçççcosqø÷÷÷÷In.
n n Multiplying across by cosq,you get 118 dI dr cosq n = e + I .
(10) dt n dt n n n Now, it is easy to see that dr 1 = - (11) dt k n n on account of Eq.
(5).
Using Eq.
(11) in Eq.
(10) you obtain dI e cosq n = - n + I dt k n n n or dI e m n = I - n , (12) dt n k n where the projection factor m= cosq.
(13) Equation (13) is the basic equation of radiative transfer.
It has with the following sign convention: (i) I is positive outwards (towards the observer).
n (ii) t is positive inwards (starting from zero at a surface “nearest” the n observer).
(iii) s is positive inwards (staring from zero at a surface nearest the observer).
The ratio of the emission coefficient to the absorption coefficient defines the source function S .
Thus, the source function S is given by n n e S = n .
(14) n k n where  and  are the emission and absorption coefficients respectively.
v v 119 3.5 Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) In the stellar atmosphere, it is impossible to achieve complete thermodynamic equilibrium.
If there were complete thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperature would be the same everywhere with no temperature gradient to drive an outward flow of radiation.
Besides, if the temperature were the same everywhere, then the radiation field would be isotropic so that the positive contributions and the negative contributions would cancel out, resulting in zero flux.
No doubt, a complete thermodynamic equilibrium cannot occur in stellar atmosphere.
However, a sufficiently small region of the stellar atmosphere may attain roughly the same temperature.
In this case, the affected region may be characterized by a single local temperature.
Such a small region is said to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).
The LTE approximation greatly simplifies the solution of the equation of radiative transfer.
For instance, when LTE reigns, the ratio e k depends only on the n n temperature T, and the source function S is simply the Planck function B (T).
n n Thus, under LTE conditions, the source function S may be written as n 2hn3 é hn ù- 1 S = B (T)= êexp - 1ú , (15) n n c2 êë kT úû where n is frequency, h is Planck’s constant, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and c is the speed of light.
Planck’s law can also be written in terms of the wavelength l .
To do this, we require that B dn= - B dl n l or 120 dn B = - l .
(16) dl B n The negative sign indicates that the wavelength decreases with increasing frequency.
Now, the velocity of light is equal to the product of the frequency and the wavelength.
Thus, c= nl or n= cl - 1.
Differentiating the above expression, you find that dn = - cl -2 (17) dl Comparing Eq (16) and Eq (17), you get B - l = - cl - 2 B n or æc ö Bl = çççèl 2ø÷÷÷÷Bn.
(18) But, Planck’s function B (T) is given by v 2hn3 é æhnö ù- 1 Bn(T)= c2 êêexpçççèkTø÷÷÷÷- 1úú ë û so that æc ö 2hn3 é æhnö ù- 1 Bl (T)= çççèl 2ø÷÷÷÷.
c2 êêexpèçççkTø÷÷÷÷- 1úú .
ë û c Also, the frequency v may be written as v= so that l æc ö 2h æcö3é æhc ö ù- 1 Bl (T)= çççèl 2ø÷÷÷÷×c2 ×èçççl ø÷÷÷÷ êêexpèçççl kTø÷÷÷÷- 1úú .
ë û 121 Simplifying, you find that B (T) is given by l 2hc2 é æhc ö ù- 1 Bl (T)= l 5 êêexpçççèl kT÷÷÷÷ø- 1úú .
(19) ë û 3.6 Application to Radio Waves Radio waves have long wavelengths and low frequencies.
For that reason, the hn quantity is very small.
In particular, hn= kT.
kT Now, consider the exponential term in Eq (15).
Rewrite the exponential function as æhnö expçççèkTø÷÷÷÷= ex, where hn x= .
kT The power series development of ex is x2 ex = 1+ x+ +L (20) 2!
Recall that the following inequality holds: hn= kT.
This implies that hn = 1, kT or x= 1.
(21) Since x= 1, you may retain only the first two terms of the power series expansion of ex.
Thus, you may write ex » 1+ x (22) 122 or æhnö hn expçççèkT÷÷÷÷ø» 1+ kT .
(23) Using Eq.
(23) in Eq (15), you find that B (T) reduces to v 2hn3 éæ hnö ù- 1 Bn(T)» c2 êêçççè1+ kT÷÷÷÷ø- 1úú , ë û or 2hn3æhnö- 1 Bn(T)» c2 çççèkT÷÷÷÷ø or 2hn3ækTö Bn(T)» c2 çççèhn÷÷÷÷ø Hence, the Planck’s function B (T) assumes the form v æ2kTö Bn(T)» çççè c2 ø÷÷÷÷n2.
(24) Equation (24) gives a particularly simple version of B (T).
It applies only when v LTE reigns and the affected frequency is so low that hv= kT.
You have seen that radio waves satisfy the required condition, hn= kT.
For this reason, it is appropriate to use the expression for source function given by Eq.
(24) when dealing with radio signals.
In terms of the wavelength, Eq.
(19) may be processed as follows: 2hc2 é æhc ö ù- 1 Bl (T)= l 5 êêexpçççèl kT÷÷÷÷ø- 1úú ë û For radio signals, hc= l kT so that 123 æhc ö hc expçççèl kTø÷÷÷÷» 1+ l kT .
Thus, in terms of l , the source function becomes: 2hc2 é hc ù- 1 B (T)» ê1+ - 1ú l l 5 êë l kT úû or 2hc2 æhc ö- 1 Bl (T)» l 5 ×çççèl kTø÷÷÷÷ or 2hc2 l kT B (T)» × .
l l 5 hc Again, the Planck’s function B (T) assumes the following simple form: l 2ckT B (T)» .
(25) l l 4 Equations (3), (4), (12), (15), (19) (24) and (25) form the basis for discussion of transport of continuum radiation.
However, the source function S may depart n significantly from the Planck’s function B (T) if strong spectral lines are involved.
n In that case, S resembles the direction-averaged mean intensity J defined by n n 1 J = ò I dW, n 4p n where W is solid angle.
For such strong spectral lines, the LTE approximation breaks down.
For that reason, we must replace the LTE conditions by the assumption of a statistically steady state in each atomic energy level.
We shall return to this case in your study of line profiles.
124 4 CONCLUSION In this unit, you have been introduced to the concept of intensity, flux and luminosity.
You have derived the equation of radiative transfer.
You have seen that LTE approximation can greatly simplify the expression for the source function in the equation of radiative transfer.
Finally you have applied the LTE approximation of the equation of radiative transfer to radio waves.

(xviii) the LTE approximation can greatly simplify the source function in the equation of transfer.

A spectral line is formed whenever an electron jumps from a higher energy level to a lower energy level.
In this unit, you shall be introduced to the transition rules, the formation of spectral lines and the profile of such spectral lines.

(ii) apply the transition rules to atomic energy levels.
(iii) discuss degeneracy of atomic levels.
(iv) deduce the shape of a spectral line, given its normalized profile.
(v) discuss line broadening.

MAIN CONTENTS 3.1 Transition A transition is said to occur when an electron jumps from one energy level to another.
When a transition occurs, a spectral line is formed.
In the case of strong spectral lines, the source function may depart significantly from the Planck’s function, resembling more the direction-averaged mean intensity J  which is given by 1 J  I d.
 4  For such spectral lines, we replace the conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) by the assumption of a statistically steady state in each atomic energy level.
Recall that a spectral line is formed whenever an electron jumps from a higher energy level to a lower energy level.
Conversely, an absorption line is formed when an electron jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level.
Consider a radiating atom.
Suppose that a line is formed by transition between two bound levels i and j, where j i.
Let  denote the continuum.
For an 138 optically thin emission line (i.e a case where  is small), the emergent intensity  I of such an emission line (after passing through a plasma) is given by ji I n A dV, ji j ij ji where n is the population of the upper atomic level from where the electrons j jump to the lower level i during the emission of the quanta (photons) h , and V ji is the volume of the plasma radiating the line  .
The population n of the energy ji j level j in an atom (or ion) depends on n a) the ratio j , where n is the total number of atoms (or ions) in that n ion ion particular ionization state; n b) the ionization equilibrium ion , where n is the elemental abundance; n elem elem n c) the abundance of the element relative to hydrogen, elem , where n is the n H H number density of hydrogen; and d) the number density of hydrogen, n .
H Each energy level in an atom (or ion) is characterized by four quantum numbers: (i) the principal quantum number n, (ii) the spin quantum number s, (iii) the angular momentum quantum number l, and (iv) the total angular momentum quantum number j.
A photon is emitted when an electron jumps from a higher energy level characterized by n,s,l, j to a lower energy level characterized by n,s,l, j.
Conversely, a photon is absorbed when an electron jumps from a lower energy level n,s,l, j to a higher energy level n,s,l, j.
If the atom contains more than 139 one electron, then you use the lower-case letters s,land j to denote the angular momenta for a particular electron and the upper-case letters S,Land J to denote the angular momenta of the entire atom.
In this case, the electrons are arranged in shells.
According to Pauli’s exclusion principle, no two electrons, may have the same set of quantum numbers.
Thus, the energy level of the entire atom may be symbolized by n,S,L, J while the energy level of any single electron may be denoted by n,s,l, j.
The principal quantum number is always denoted by the lower-case letter n. Suppose that electrons jump from an upper level j denoted by n,S,L, J to a lower level i denoted by n,S,L, J.
Electrons that jump from level j to level i will emit a spectral line of frequency  given by ji E E   j i , ji h where E is the energy of the upper level j and E is the energy of the lower j i level i.
On the other hand, an absorption line is formed when electrons jump from the lower level i to the upper level j.
In the case of absorption, the photon is absorbed by the electron and the energy of the photon is used to raise the electron to a higher energy level.
3.2 Transition Rules 3.2.1 Transition Rules in the Absence of a Magnetic Field A transition occurs when an electron jumps from one energy level to another.
In spectroscopy, it is quite possible to predict the transitions that will occur under a given condition.
In this way, the frequencies of the resulting set of emission (or absorption) lines can also be predicted.
This is possible because the quantum numbers n,S,L, J obey certain transition rules.
In particular, an electron can 140 jump, only if the change in quantum numbers is consistent with the following rules: (a) SS SS 0 S 0.
(b) LL or LL1 LL0  LL1 L0  L1 Combining the two results, you obtain L0 or 1 .
L1,0,1.
(c) JJ or JJ 1 JJ 0  JJ 1 J 0  J 1 Combining these two results, you obtain J 0 or 1 J 1,0,1.
Note: 1.
There is no restriction on the principal quantum number n. 2.
The transition from J0 is for bidden.
3.
Parity must change by1.
(Parity is the sum of the l-values of all the electrons).
4.
The fact that s0 implies that spin is conserved.
141 3.2.2 Degeneracy of Atomic Levels The transition rules stated above are sufficient in the absence of magnetic field.
If a magnetic field is applied, however, the total angular momentum J may be pointed only in certain “quantized” directions with respect to the direction of the magnetic field.
In this case, J may be pointed in such a way that its projection along the applied magnetic field can only take one of the following values: J, J 1, J 2, ,J.
This gives a total of 2J 1 sub-levels.
These 2J+1 sub-levels are often indistinguishable.
The projection of J along the magnetic field is called the magnetic quantum number denoted by M .
It is the fifth quantum number.
The magnetic quantum J number M indicates that a level is composed of 2J 1 sub-levels.
Such a level J is said to be degenerate.
The degree of the degeneracy is the number 2J 1.
The degree of degeneracy is also called the statistical weight g of that particular level (i.e.
g 2J 1).
The statistical weight g represents the number of electrons that can occupy a given level without violating Pauli’s exclusion principle.
When there is a transition between one degenerate state A and another degenerate state B, there will be transition between certain sub-levels of state A and certain sub-levels of state B.
However, there will be no transition between some sub-levels of state B and some sub-levels of state B.
The magnetic quantum number M shall communicate with each other only when certain rules J for M are obeyed.
These rules for M are stated below: J J M M or M M 1,.
J J J J M M 0 M M 1 J J J J 142 M 0 M 1 J J Combing the two results, you obtain M 0 or 1 J M 0,1 J M 1,0,1.
J Example (1) Make a schematic representation of a) aspectral line between two degenerate levels J 2and J 1, in the absence of a magnetic field.
b) the allowed components (of the spectral line) when degeneracy is lifted due to the application of a magnetic field.
Solution (1) a) In the absence of a magnetic field, one spectral line is observed (Fig.
1a).
J  2 J 1 143 b) In the presence of a magnetic field, the degeneracy is lifted and the sub- levels appear separately as shown in Fig.

M J 2 1 0 J=2 -1 -2 LINE 1 0 J=1 -1 INCREASING MAGNETIC FIELD 3.2.3 Forbidden Transitions In the classical treatment, a series expansion of the radiation field can be obtained.
The dominant term is the electric dipole contribution.
This is a good first approximation if other terms are neglected.
In quantum theory, the dipole term corresponds to the electron transitions.
It is governed by the quantum number rules of Eqs(4) and (5).
In the classical treatment, there are other less important terms such as the electric quadrupole term and higher (electric and magnetic) terms.
In the quantum picture, there are “forbidden” transitions which do not obey the rules set down in Eqs(4) and (5).
Such transitions my still give rise to observable spectral lines.
These spectral lines may not be important under the laboratory (high- density) conditions.
However, under low-density conditions, the spectral lines resulting from the “forbidden” transitions become quite significant.
The selection 144 rules for magnetic dipole radiation are SS, which implies that S 0   L L, which implies that L0   6 J J or J J 1, which imply that J 0,1  nlnl, which implies that nl0   Thus, the transitions which give rise to magnetic dipole radiation must take place between levels within one and the same term.
(The only parameter that may differ by 1 is the total angular momentum quantum numberJ ).
3.3 Line Profile 3.3.1 Absorption Lines All the information about the physical properties of astronomical objects comes from the study of the spectra.
In particular, by studying the strengths of the absorption lines, we can deduce stellar masses, temperatures and compositions.
Light from a source can be dispersed into a spectrum by means of a prism or a diffraction grating.
Different sources have different spectra.
For instance, the spectra of a quasar consist of a continuous spectrum (or continuum) with narrow spectral lines superimposed.
These lines are mostly absorption (Fraunhofer) lines, but sometimes bright emission lines, are also observed.
The continuous spectrum comes from the hot surface of the source nucleus.
Atoms in the atmosphere absorb certain characteristic wavelengths of this radiation leaving dark “gaps” at the corresponding points in the spectrum.
3.3.2 Electron Lifetime and Levels Let us now take a closer look at the equation h E E, E E.
ji j i j i If the energy levels E and E were sharply defined, an infinitely narrow spectral j i line would be emitted when an electron jumps from energy level j to energy level 145 i.
This would correspond to an infinitely long lifetime of the electron in that energy level.
The frequency spread  and the lifetime t are related by the expression: t 2, 7a or Dividing both sides of Eq.
(7a) by 2 you get ,  t 1.
  2 But, by definition of angular frequency, you know that 2, so that 2, and  .
2 Hence, Eq(7a) reduces to  t 1.
  2 or 2 t 1    2  so that t 1.
7b Multiplying both sides of Eq(7b) by the Planck’s constant h, you get ht  h. 8 But, E h, so that 146 Eh.
9 Hence, using Eq(9) in Eq(8), you find that Et  h. 10 Here, E is a measure of the sharpness of the energies; t is a measure of the electron lifetime; h is Planck’s constant;  represents the spread of a spectral line of frequency .
At this stage, you may wish to compare Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle with the foregoing discussion.
Equation (9) shows that a sharply defined energy E corresponds to an infinitely narrow spectral line v, and Equation (10) shows that an infinitely narrow spectral line  corresponds to an infinitely long lifetime t.
The conclusion here is obvious: if a particular atomic energy level is sharply defined then any electron in that energy level will have an infinitely long lifetime.
3.3.3 The Lorentzian Line Profile Evidently, the lifetime of an electron in any energy level is finite.
Therefore, the energy level must also have a finite width.
This fact was expressed quantum mechanically by Weisskopet and Wigner in the following probability distribution law:   A dE P E dE  j , 11 j h 1 A2 42EE 2 4 j h2 j where E is the mean energy of the energy level j and A is the probability of j j transition from level j to all other possible levels E. Thus, the energy of a level with mean energy E is distributed as shown in Eq(11).
j Equation (11) defines the line profile.
Its curve is called a damping profile or a   dispersion curve.
Clearly, the probability distribution P E has a maximum value j 147   when EE 0 i.e.
when EE .
This implies that most of the atoms have energies j j in the neighourhood of the mean energyE .
j When an electron jumps from level j to level i, the intensity of the resulting spectral line is given by A  A I hv A j i , 12 ji ji ji 1 2 42   2 A  A  E E E 4 j i h2  i j  where A is the probability of transition from level j level i. ji Equation (12) can be simplified by setting  A A and noting that E hv while j i E E E E h .
Equation (12) can then be processed as follows: i j j i ji  I  E A ji ji ji 12 42 EE E 2 4 h2  i j   I  E A ji ji ji 12 42hh 2 4 h2 ij   E A ji ji 42 12 h2v2 2h2v vh2v2 4 h2 ji ij E A   ji ji 2 42  h2v2 2v vv2 4 h2 ji ij so that E A  I  ji ji .
ji 2 42vv 2 4 ji Dividing the numerator and the denominator 42, you obtain 148 E A  ji ji    42  I  .
13 ji  2   2  vv   162  ji For a constant decay probability A , Eq(13) may be simplified further by setting ji E A 1 14 ji ji and I  15 ji v so that  1   .

The line shape  is called the given by Eq(16) is called Lorentzian profile and the parameter Lorentzian width.
The damping constant  A A is the sum of the decay j i constants of the two energy levels involved in the electron jump.
3.3.4 Line Broadening The wings of a spectral line will be weak while the core of the spectral line  remains strong.
Line broadening is a measure of the spread of the frequency of the emitted spectral line on either side of the core.
Line broadening can be divided into three classes: 1) natural line broadening; 2) doppler line broadening; and 3) collisional (or pressure) line broadening.
149 The natural line broadening is always present.
The Doppler line broadening is due to the motion of the observed atoms in different directions with different velocities.
The resulting Doppler shift produces a spread in the frequency of the observed line.
Collisional (or pressure) line broadening is due to the effects of other particles on the radiating atom.
Doppler broadening is always proportional (in wavelength units), to the wavelength of the centre line.
Natural and collisional broadenings do not show any systematic trend with the centre wavelength.
However, collisional broadening is always proportional to the number of colliding particles per unit volume (and, by extension to pressure).
Let us consider the Doppler line broadening and the collisional (or pressure) line broadening in detail.
3.3.5 Doppler Line Broadening Doppler broadening is due to the motion of individual atoms in a hot gas.
The thermal motions of the atoms (or ions) produce particles which are moving away from an observer, and particles moving toward the observer.
This situation gives rise to Doppler effect.
The frequency v of a spectral line emitted by an atom moving with velocity v along the line of sight is given by r v  vvv  r .v ,   o  c  o where v is the rest frequency of the spectral line and c is the speed of light.
o Clearly, v is positive when v is negative.
Also, v is negative when v is r r positive.
A negative value of v implies that the radiating atom is moving away from the observer (i.e v is positive).
This gives rise to a shift in the wavelength of r a visible line towards the ‘red end’ of the optical spectrum.
In this case, a redshift is said to have taken place.
The observed frequency is lower than the rest frequency of the emitted line (i.e.
the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength of the spectral line).
150 If the radiating atom is moving toward the observer then v is negative.
In this r case, the shift v in frequency of the spectral line is positive.
A positive value of v gives rise to a shift in the wavelength of a visible spectral line toward the ‘blue end’ of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The observed frequency is higher than the ‘rest frequency of the spectral line (i.e.
the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength of the line).
When the Doppler broadening of a spectral line is entirely due to the thermal motion of the radiating particles, the width of such a line is called the Doppler width v .
D In terms of the frequency, the Doppler width v is given by D 1 v 2kT  2 v  o ,   D c  m  where v is the frequency of the undisturbed line centre, T is temperature, m is o the mass of the particle and k is Boltzmann’s constant.
In terms of the wavelength, the Doppler width  is given by D 1 2kT  2   o ,   D c  m  where  is the wavelength of the undisturbed line centre,  , and the o D o profile  is now normalized with respect to .
 Notice that the expression for the shift in wavelength  (or frequency shift v ) D D is closely related to the expression for the thermal velocity v (written in terms of o the temperature T ) of the radiating particles.
151 3.3.6 Gaussian Profile The thermal motions of individual atoms are not the only motion of interest here.
Sometimes, the radiating atoms may possess a thermal velocity component as well as a nonthermal (turbulent) velocity component.
In this case, the Doppler width is modified to accommodate the nonthermal component in the following way: 1  2kT  2   o 2 .
  D c  m  The profile  of the Doppler broadened line is then given by  v v  2 1  v    exp  , v vD  vD   where the Doppler width is again defined by v 2kT v  o  D c m In terms of the wavelength, the profile assumes the form  2 1   D expD  .
This is a bell-shaped profile called the Gaussian profile.
The Gaussian profile falls to half its maximum height (or depth) when the exponential term is equal to half i.e.
when  2   1 exp   .
    2  D  In this case, 2   1   loge2, D 152 2     loge1loge 2, D 2     log 2log 1,   e e D 2   2   loge1, D 2     loge2,   D   log 2,  e D and  log 2 D e The full width at half height (FWHH) of the line profile is defined as the wavelength separation between the points when the profile drops to half its maximum height (or depth) on EITHER side of the line centre.
On one side of the line centre,  log 2 On the other side of the line D e centre,  log 2 also.
Thus, the full width at half height is given by the sum D e of the two equal values of  i.e.
FWHH  log 2 log 2 D e D e or FWHH 2 log 2 D e Substituting the value of log 2, you obtain e FWHH 1.667.
D This result is applicable to both the absorption and emission line profiles.
However, the actual line will suffer radiative transfer effects (like saturation) 153 which may reduce the dip in an absorption line and hence increase the observed FWHH.
4 CONCLUSION In this unit, you were introduced to the basic transition and selection rules that are useful in understanding the formation of spectral lines.
You studied the Lorentzian profile and the Gaussian profile.
You were able to use the normalized profile to deduce the shape of a spectral line.
You have seen the three mechanisms by which a spectral line may be broadened.
5 SUMMARY Having gone through this unit, you now know that (i) a spectral line is formed whenever an electron jumps from a higher energy level to a lower energy level.
(ii) the emergent intensity I of an optically thin emission line is given by  I n A h dV,  j ij ji where n is the population of the upper atomic level j (from where the j electrons jump to the lower level i during the emission of the photons), hv is the energy of the emitted photons, and V is the volume of the ji plasma radiating the line of frequency v .
ji (iii) the energy level in an atom is characterized by (a) the principal quantum number n; (b) the spin quantum number s; (c) the angular momentum quantum number l; and (d) the total angular momentum quantum number j.
154  (iv) a photon is emitted whenever an electron jumps from a higher energy level defined by the set of quantum numbers n,s,l, j to a lower energy level defined by a new set of quantum numbers n,s,l, j.
(v) a photon is absorbed whenever an electron jumps from a lower energy level n,s,l, j to a higher energy level n,s,l, j.
(vi) if the atom contains more than one electron, then, the lower-case letters s,l, j are used to denote the angular momenta of a particular electron and the upper-case letters S,L,J are used to denote the angular momenta of the entire atom.
(In all cases, the principal quantum number is denoted by the lower-case letter, n).
(vii) the energy level of a particular electron is symbolized by n,s,l, j while the energy level of the entire atom is symbolized by n,S,L,J.
(viii) according to Pauli’s exclusion principle, no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers.
(ix) an electron that jumps from an upper level j to a lower level i will emit a spectral line of frequency v given by ji E E v  j i , ji h where E is the energy of the upper level j and E is the energy of the j i lower level i.
(In this case, an emission line is produced) (x) an electron that jumps from the lower level i to the upper level j will absorb a photon of frequency v given by ij E E v v  j i , ij ji h 155 where h is Planck’s constant.
(In this case, an absorption line is produced).
(xi) a transition is said to occur when an electron jumps from one energy level to another.
(xii) an electron cannot jump from one energy level to another unless the following conditions are met: a) SS , which implies that S 0 b) LL or LL1, which imply that L0,1 c) JJ or JJ 1, which imply that J 0,1 (xiii) the transition from J0 to J 0 is forbidden since parity must change by 1.
(xiv) there is no restriction on the principal quantum number, n. (xiv) if a magnetic field is applied, the total angular momentum J must be pointed in such a way that its projection along the magnetic field can only take one of the following values: J, J 1, J 2, ,J, giving a total of 2J 1 sub-levels that are often indistinguishable.

156 (xviii) the degree of degeneracy (i.e.
statistical weight) g represents the number of electrons than can occupy a particular level without violating Pauli’s exclusion principle.
(xix) when there is a transition between one degenerate state A and another degenerate state B, there will be transition between only certain sub-levels of state A and certain sub-levels of state B which obey the selection rule for the magnetic quantum number.

(xxii) no spectral line is infinitely narrow (as that would imply that the life-time of the electron emitting the line is infinitely long).
(xxiii) according to Weisskopf and Wigner, the fact that the life-time of an electron is finite implies that the following probability distribution law holds: A dE PE dE  j , j h 1 A2 42EE 2 4 j h2 j where E is the mean energy of the energy level j and A is the j j probability of transition from level j to all other possible levels E. (xxiv) the normalized profile  of the spectral line produced when an electron v jumps from level j to level i is given by  1   , v 42   2 vv 2  0 2 where  is the Lorentzian width.
(xxv) line broadening can be divided into three classes: 157 1) natural line broadening, 2) doppler line broadening, and 3) collisional (or pressure) line broadening.
(xxvi) Doppler broadening is due to the thermal motions of indiving atoms (or ions) toward (and away from) the observer.
(xxvii) in terms the frequency v, the Doppler width v is given by D 1 v 2kT 2 v  0 ,   D c  m  where v is the frequency of the undisturbed line, T is temperature, m 0 is mass and k is Boltzmann’s constant.
(xxviii) the natural broadening is always present.
(xxix) collisional (or pressure) broadening is due to the effects of other particles on the radiating atom.
