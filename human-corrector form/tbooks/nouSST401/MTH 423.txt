Integral equations bear a very close kinship with differential equations and quite often, problems may be formulated either in differential form or in integral form.
Very often, Integral Equations cannot be solved analytically and a numerical approach has to be adopted; particularly for equations over arbitrarily profiles.
It is the desire of the author that through this course, you will be encouraged to develop an enquiring attitude towards Integral Equations and relate the lessons learnt in this course to the world around you.
Furthermore; you are encouraged to build upon the lessons learnt in the prerequisite course, strengthen your understanding of the underlying principles at work in the application of Integral Equations.
THE COURSE: MTH 423 Integral Equation This course comprises a total of seven Units distributed across four modules as follows: Module 1 is composed of 3 Units Module 2 is composed of 2 Units Module 3 is composed of 3 Units Module 4 is composed of 2 Units In Module 1 we shall commence this course with a visit to the Preliminary Concepts of Linear Integral Equation where we shall take a look at a loaded elastic string and the Shop Stocking Problem.
Unit 2 shall see you Converting Ordinary Differential Equations into Integral Equations which shall be swiftly followed by your learning the Transformation of Sturm - Liouville Problems to Integral Equation.
You shall be taught how to classify Linear Integral Equation Integral Equations and find Approximate Solutions to Integral Equations in Unit 3.
You shall learn that the Volterra Integral Equations are integral equations with an integration limit containing one of the variables of integration in Module 2.
You will learn to use the Resolvent Kernel to solve this class of Integral Equations in Unit 1.
Also you shall discover that for many Integral Equations, you must carry out a Laplace Transformation to arrive at a solution; and tat the consequence of this is the inverse transform which implies Convolution.
This will bring you to the subject of Convolution Type Kernels in Unit 2; where the Fredholm Equations serve as a veritable platform for you.
Fredholm Equations with Degenerate Kernels and the General Method of Solution shall be studied by you in Unit 1 of Module 3.
Unit 2 will make you more conversant with Eigenfunctions, Eigenvectors and Symmetric Kernels, and you should have known how to easily Represent a Function by a Series of Orthogonal Functions and Expand Kin Eigenfunctions.
Of the several definitions and theorems which you will be introduced to shall be those related to Positive Kernels and convergence – a necessary condition for determining a solution for Integral Equations in deriving a numerical solution.
This Unit ends with the statement of the Hilbert - Schmidt Theorem.
Our final Module, 4 will take you through the processing of 1st Eigenvalue Integral Transforms via Laplace Transforms, Convolution Theorem and Inverse Laplace Transform in Unit 1 while in Unit 2 the application of the transform and Fourier Integral Equations will be the concluding part of your study your MTH 423 course.

These equations bear a close kinship with Differential Equations suggesting that a Differential Equation can be formulated as an Integral Equation and vice-versa.
The analytical method remains the standard method of solving Integral Equations, however, where the analytical method fails; the equation can be solved numerically.
Let us commence with two common problems to illustrate the basic concepts of linear Integral Equations; loaded elastic string and the shop stocking problem.
2 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (i) Appreciate the basic concepts underlying linear integral equations (ii) Investigate the equations which describe the displacement of a loaded elastic sting 5 MTH 423 INTRGRAL EQUATION (iii) Treat the shop stocking problem 3 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 LINEAR INTEGRAL EQUATION: PRELIMINARY CONCEPTS Let us take a look at some problems, the types of which we encounter every day and which give rise to integral equation 3.1.1 A LOADED ELASTIC STRING O  Q a A η  β Y W Consider a weightless elastic string as shown in the above figure, stretched between two horizontal points O and A and suppose that a weight W is hung from the elastic string and that in equilibrium the position of the weight is at a distance from O and at a depth Y below OA.
If W is small compared to the initial tension T in the string, it can be assumed that the tension of the string remains T during the further stretching.
The vertical resolution of forces gives the equilibrium equation      T   T  a W O Where AO  a (1.1) The drop Y due to a weight W situated a distance  along the string from O is given by   Y  W aTa (1.2) The drop Y in the string at a distance x from O is given by Y  xy , 0x (1.3) 6 MTH 423 INTRGRAL EQUATION     y  ax a, xa (1.4) Eliminating y, these two results can be written in the form   y  W G x, T (1.5) where     G x,  x a a, 0 x    ax a,  xa (1.6)   Suppose now that the string is loaded continuously with a weight distribution W x per unit length.
Then, the elementary displacement at the point distance x from O, due to the weight distribution over  x is     y  W  G x, T 0 x,a (1.7) On integrating, displacement due to the complete weight distribution is given by yx  T1 aGx,Wd, 0 xa (1.8) 0 Thus, the displacement of the string is given in terms of the weight distribution.
However, if we are given the displacement of the string, what is the weight distribution?
In this case, we can sew site to eqn.

Wx  Ta y11x (1.10) 7 MTH 423 INTRGRAL EQUATION 3.1.2 THE SHOP STOCKING PROBLEM   A shop starts selling some goods.
It is found that a proportion K t remains unsold at time t after the shop has purchased the goods.
It is required to find the stock at which the shop should purchase the goods so that the stock of the goods in the shop remains constant (all processes are deemed to be continuous).
Suppose that the shop commences business in the goods by purchasing an amount A   of the goods at zero time, and buys at a rate Q t subsequently.
Over the time interval     K t Q d (1.11) Thus, the amount of goods remaining unsold at time t, and which was bought up to that time, is given by.
AKt  tKtQd (1.12) 0 This is the total stock of the shop and is to remain constant at its initial value and so AKt  tKtQd (1.13) 0   And the required stocking rate Q t is the solution of this integral eqn.
4.0 CONCLUSION Having understood the processes involve in the two illustrative problems, it is easy to; by extension; formulate similar solutions for a vast array of problems.
5.0 SUMMARY The two problems presented demonstrate how to formulate and derive an integral equation for a suitably structured problem.
It also demonstrates the process of solving the integral equation developed 8 MTH 423 INTRGRAL EQUATION 6.0 TUTOR MARKED ASSIGNMENTS 1.
Apart from the Loaded Elastic String and the Shop Stocking Problem, can you make a list of 5 different types of problems which can be solved using Integral Equation?

A transport company distributed workshops within a metropolis which receives and repair its broken down vehicles.
The workshop manager discovers that he must always reroute a Y(t)% of his workshop allocation of vehicles to alternative location every day as he cannot accommodate them in his workshop overnight, and he calls you in to tell him the optimum number of requests for repairs he should entertain every day such that the workshop is 100% utilised when all related processes are assumed to be continuous?

There are two problems which are of interest here, namely   Ly  f x x  x x (1.23) 1 2 and   Ly r x y 0 x  x x (1.24) 1 2 13 MTH 423 INTRGRAL EQUATION Px, qx and rxare continuous in the interval x  x x , and in additionPxhas 1 2 a continuous derivative and does not vanish.
The differential equation (1.23) corresponds to a displacement ycaused by some forcing function f, and the differential equation (1.24) forms, together with the boundary condition, an Eigenvalue problem.

now x y 2l, and so the later series is dominated by the series with nth term nK 2lKn1 (2.29)   n1!
This is the typical term of an exponential series and so if follows that the series 2.23   for R x, y, always converges.
    The uniqueness of the solution follows easily because, if Q x , Q x are both A B solution, then, Q x Q x,  xKx, yQ yQ ydy (2.30) A A A B 0 Since the resolvent kernel series converges for all values of if the original kernel n bounded.

We consider one set of these conditions.
3.3 LEMMA 3.1   Suppose K x, y is continuous and sup   o x 1K x, y  M o y 1 Then, the series (3.3) is uniformly convergent for   M1.
It is continuous and     the series may be integrated term by term.
Also, R x, y; is for each x, y an analytic function of the complex variable  inside   M1.

Note that in this case we have only 48 MTH 423 INTRGRAL EQUATION proved convergence for   M1, whereas for the Volterra equations it was true for all finite.
