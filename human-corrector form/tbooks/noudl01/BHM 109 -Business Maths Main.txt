The marks you obtain from these assignments will count towards the final mark you obtain for this course.
Further information on assignments will be found in the Assignment File itself and later in this Course Guide in the section on assessment.
ii  Presentation Schedule The Presentation Schedule included in your course materials gives you the important dates for the completion of tutor-marked assignments and attending tutorials.
Remember, you are required to submit all your assignments by the due date.
You should guard against falling behind in your work.
Assessment Your assessment will be based on tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) and a final examination which you will write at the end of the course.
Tutor Marked Assignments (TMA) Every unit contains at least one or two assignments.
You are advised to work through all the assignments and submit them for assessment.
Your tutor will assess the assignments and select four which will constitute the 30% of your final grade.
The tutor-marked assignments may be presented to you in a separate file.
Just know that for every unit there are some tutor-marked assignments for you.
It is important you do them and submit for assessment.
Final Examination and Grading At the end of the course, you will write a final examination which will constitute 70% of your final grade.
In the examination which shall last for two hours, you will be requested to answer three questions out of at least five questions.
Course Marking Scheme This table shows how the actual course marking is broken down.
Assessment Marks Assignments Four assignments, best three marks of the four count at 30% of course marks Final Examination 70% of overall course marks Total 100% of course marks How to Get the Most from This Course  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS In distance learning, the study units replace the university lecture.
This is one of the great advantages of distance learning; you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suits you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to the lecturer.
In the same way a lecturer might give you some reading to do, the study units tell you when to read, and which are your text materials or set books.
You are provided exercises to do at appropriate points, just as a lecturer might give you an in-class exercise.
Each of the study units follows a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the subject matter of the unit, and how a particular unit is integrated with the other units and the course as a whole.
Next to this is a set of learning objectives.
These objectives let you know what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
These learning objectives are meant to guide your study.
The moment a unit is finished, you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If this is made a habit, then you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.
The main body of the unit guides you through the required reading from other sources.
This will usually be either from your set books or from a Reading section.
The following is a practical strategy for working through the course.
If you run into any trouble, telephone your tutor.
Remember that your tutor‟s job is to help you.
When you need assistance, do not hesitate to call and ask your tutor to provide it.
In addition do the following: 1.
Read this Course Guide thoroughly, it is your first assignment.
2.
Organise a Study Schedule.
Design a „Course Overview‟ to guide you through the Course.
Note the time you are expected to spend on each unit and how the assignments relate to the units.
Important information, e.g.
details of your tutorials, and the date of the first day of the Semester is available from the study centre.
You need to gather all the information into one place, such as your diary or a wall calendar.
Whatever method you choose to use, you should decide on and write in your own dates and schedule of work for each unit.
3.
Once you have created your own study schedule, do everything to stay faithful to it.
The major reason that students fail is that they get behind with their course work.
If you get into difficulties with your schedule, please, let your tutor know before it is too late for help.
4.
Turn to Unit 1, and read the introduction and the objectives for the unit.
ii  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 5.
Assemble the study materials.
You will need your set books and the unit you are studying at any point in time.
6.
Work through the unit.
As you work through the unit, you will know what sources to consult for further information.
7.
Keep in touch with your study centre.
Up-to-date course information will be continuously available there.
8.
Well before the relevant due dates (about 4 weeks before due dates), keep in mind that you will learn a lot by doing the assignment carefully.
They have been designed to help you meet the objectives of the course and, therefore, will help you pass the examination.
Submit all assignments not later than the due date.
9. Review the objectives for each study unit to confirm that you have achieved them.
If you feel unsure about any of the objectives, review the study materials or consult your tutor.
10.
When you are confident that you have achieved a unit‟s objectives, you can start on the next unit.
Proceed unit by unit through the course and try to pace your study so that you keep yourself on schedule.
11.
When you have submitted an assignment to your tutor for marking, do not wait for its return before starting on the next unit.
Keep to your schedule.
When the Assignment is returned, pay particular attention to your tutor‟s comments, both on the tutor- marked assignment form and also the written comments on the ordinary assignments.
12.
After completing the last unit, review the course and prepare yourself for the final examination.
Check that you have achieved the unit objectives (listed at the beginning of each unit) and the course objectives (listed in the Course Guide).
Tutors and Tutorials The dates, times and locations of these tutorials will be made available to you, together with the name, telephone number and the address of your tutor.
Each assignment will be marked by your tutor.
Pay close attention to the comments your tutor might make on your assignments as these will help in your progress.
Make sure that assignments reach your tutor on or before the due date.
iii  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Your tutorials are important therefore try not to skip any.
It is an opportunity to meet your tutor and your fellow students.
It is also an opportunity to get the help of your tutor and discuss any difficulties encountered on your reading.
Summary This course would train you on the concept of multimedia, production and utilization of it.

Figures are major instrument used for expression, especially where large data are involved.
It makes expression very concise in explanation and interpretation.
This makes it important for us to know how mathematical symbols and logic could be used.
1  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Solve simple problems using mathematical symbols and logic.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition Mathematics is the science of numbers and shape.
It can also be applied to some real life happening.
Example includes Arithmetic algebra (using of symbols or letters).
Symbol in this context is a letter that is made to represent a statement or an argument.
Example, let „p‟ represent the statement “She is tall and beautiful” and the letter „q‟ represent the statement “She is intelligent”.
Therefore p and q can be regarded as a statement also meaning “She is tall, beautiful and intelligent.” Hence, Logic is the science of reasoning or explaining events.
In other words, it could still be defined as the study and analysis of a mathematical proposition as to ascertain the Truth Value of the proposition.
The TRUTH VALUE of a proposition is termed “T” if it is true and “F” if it is false.
Example 1 Given that 2 + 3 = 4, the Truth Value of this statement is False i.e.
„F‟.
Example 2 Lagos is a cosmopolitan state.
The Truth Value of this is True „T‟ Te Truth Value Table can be used to depict or analyze the Truth Value of any mathematical statement.
Example 3 Find the Truth Table of p q, meaning (p and q).
p Q p q T T T T F F 2  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Meaning, “if p is true, q is true; then p and q must be true”.
Also, “if p is true, q is false; then p and q must be false”.
This shall be expansible in this further study.
3.1 Some Objectives of Symbolic Logic Reasoning 1.
Logical reasoning could be used to ascertain or analyze complicated business argument.
2.
It could be used to decode equivalent, negation or contradictory propositions.
3.
It could be used to analyze a statement.
4.
It could be used to form composite statements from simple ones using logical connectives.
5.
It could be used to ascertain the Truth Value of a statement.
3.2 Definition of Basic Logical Terms A statement or (proposition) in the context of logic is a declarative sentences or an expression of words which are either true or false, but cannot assume both.
3.3 Types of Statement There are two types of statements: simple and composite (compound) statements respectively.
Example of Simple Statement 1.
Mr. Alakija is the H.O.D 2.
I am an undergraduate 3.
Rose flower is red 4.
2 + 5 = 4 5.
Accra is in Nigeria The proposition/statement/ascertain (1 – 5) above are simple ones and can either be true or false.
However, a composite statement is the use of connectives to combine two or more simple statements to form just one.
3  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Example of Composite Statements 1.
Mr. Alakija is the H.O.D and I am an undergraduate 2.
Accra is in Nigeria implies that 2 + 5 = 4 The Truth Value of a composite statement is determined by the Truth Value of each of the simple statements and the way they are connected.
3.4 Connectives These are expressions; phrases or symbols that are made used of, to join (combine) two or more simple statements together in order to form a composite statement.
Examples of connectives used in logic are: Name Meaning Symbol i.
Conjunction “and”  ii.
Disjunction “OR”  iii.
Negation “NOT” ~ iv.
Conditional “If ….
Implies that”  or  v. Bi – implication “if and only if”  Other connectives could be used but must be defined properly.
3.5 Tautology and Contradiction The negation of contradiction is a tautology, while the negation of tautology is a contradiction.
3.6 An Argument It is said to be formed when the conjunction of a set of simple mathematical statements gives rise to another mathematical statement (conclusion).
An argument may be valid or invalid.
If the conclusion derives its support from its support from its premises, the argument is said to be valid, otherwise invalid.
Example 1 Let p: Lagos is in Nigeria q: Nigeria is in West Africa r: It means that Lagos is in West Africa.
4  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS The above argument is valid i.e.
r derives its supports from p and q respectively.
3.7 Algebra of Propositions Any logical statement can be represented by the letter p, q, r… The fundamental property of a logical statement is that it is either true or false but not both.
3.8 Conjunction (pq) p  q represent the conjunction of p and q by „and‟.
Example 2 Let p be “It is sunning” and q be “The day is windy”.
Then p  q means “it is sunning and the day is windy”.
Recall the symbol () represents intersection of two sets.
p  q = {x / x p  x  q} The Truth Value of the composite statement p  q satisfies the following property.
If p is true and q is true, then p  q is true; otherwise p  q is false.
Example 3 Consider the following four propositions i. Garri is from cassava and 5 + 2 = 3 ii.
Garri is from yam and 5 + 2 = 7 iii.
Garri is from yam and 5 + 2 = 6 iv.
Garri is from cassava and 5 + 2 = 7 Considering the statements (i) to (iv), only proposition (iv) is true, and (i), (ii), (iii) are false because in each case, one of the simple statement is false.
The above proposition can be written in tabular form thus: 5  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Statements p q (p q) i) T F F ii) F T F iii) F F F iv) T T T Remark This is the exact order the statement above follows, but in the final presentation, the Truth Value Table must be formulated considering Truth first before False.
Please see the acceptable way below: Statements p q (p q) iv) T T T i) T F F ii) F T F iii) F F F 3.9 Disjunction (p  q) Any two statements can be combined by the word “or” (), to form another statement.
The disjunction of p and q is denoted by p  q.
Example 4 Let p be “It is raining” and q be “The weather is cold”.
Then, p  q means that “It is raining or the weather is cold”.
The symbol () can be used to define union of two sets.
Thus: p  q = x/x pxq Note that, the (p  q) satisfies the following property; If p is true or q is true or both p and q are true, then (p  q) is true: otherwise (p  q) is false.
Hence, consider the Truth Table below: 6  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS p q (p q) T T T T F F F T T F F F Example 5 Consider the following four statements: i. Garri is from cassava or 5 + 2 = 4 ii.
Garri is from yam or 5 + 2 = 7 iii.
Garri is from cassava or 5 + 2 = 7 iv.
Garri is from yam or 5 + 2 = 6 Only (iv) is false, every other proposition is true; since at least one of the propositions is true.
3.10 Negation If (p) is a given proposition, its negation is denoted by (~ p) meaning it is not (p), or it is false that (p).
Example 6 Let (p) be Garri is from yam; therefore (~ p) means, “It is false that Garri is from yam”.
Then, the Truth Value of the negation of statement satisfies the property.
If (p) is true, (~ p) is false.
Consider the Truth Value of negation below: P (~ p) T F F T 7  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Further Examples If (p) is the statement 5 + 2 = 6, then (~ p) is the statement 5 + 2  6 3.10.1 Conditional (p  q) Conditional statement is of the form “if p then q” Moreso, (p  q) can also be read as: i. p implies w ii.
p is sufficient for q iii.
q is necessary for p iv.
p only if q v. q if p or vi.
if p then q or vii.
q follows from p or (p  q)satisfies the following property: The conditional (p  q) is true unless (p) is true and (q) is false.
In other words, a true statement cannot imply a false statement.
His can be stated in tabular form, thus: p q (p  q) T T T T F F F T T F F F Example 7 Consider the following statements: i.
IF Garri is from cassava then 5 + 2 = 6 ii.
If Garri is from Yam then 5 + 2 = 7 iii.
If Garri is from cassava then 5 + 2 = 7 iv.
If Garri is from yam then 5 + 2 = 7 Here, only (i) is false, because true statement cannot imply false statement, Garri is from cassava is true, 5 + 2 =6: while all other statements are true.
8  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 3.10.2 Bi-conditional (p  q) Consider the statement of the form “p if and only if q” or (p if q) and can be denoted by (p  q).
(p  q) satisfies the following property: If (p) and (q) have the same Truth Value, then (p  q) is true.
If (p) and (q) have opposite Truth Value, then (p  q) is false.
Consider the True value of Bi-conditional statement p Q (p  q) T T T T F F F T F F F T Example 8 Consider the following statements: i. Garri is from cassava if and only if 5 + 2 = 6 ii.
Garri is from yam if and only if 5 + 2 = 7 iii.
Garri is from cassava if and only if 5 + 2 = 7 iv.
Garri is from yam if and only if 5 + 2 = 7 Hence, statements (iii) and (iv) are true and statements (i) and (ii) are false.

Write a proposition, which describes each of the following statements: 1.
(p  q) 2.
(p  q) 3.
(  q) 4.
(p  q) 5.
(~ p  ~ q) 6.
~ (~ p  ~ q) Solution 1.
(p  q) Reads “The goods are standard and The goods are expensive” 10  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 2.
(p  q) Reads “The goods are standard or The goods are expensive” 3.
(~~ q) Reads “It is not false that the goods are expensive” 4.
(p  q) Reads “The goods are standard if and only if the goods are expensive” 5.
~ (~ p  ~ q) Reads “It is not true that the goods are standard or the goods are expensive” 6.
~ (~ p  ~ q) Is equivalent to (p  q) Example 1.2 Let (p) be “she is tall” and (q) be “She is dark” Write each of the following statements in symbolic form using p and q: a) “She is tall and dark” b) “She is tall or dark” c) “She is neither tall nor dark” d) “It is false that she is tall or dark” e) “She is tall or she is short and dark” f) “She is tall but not dark” Solution a) (p  q) b) (p  q) c) (  p ~ q) = ~ (p  q) d) (~p  q) e) p (~ p  q) f) ( p  ~ q) Example 1.3 Use the Truth Value Table to express the following statements: a) (p  q)  (p  q) b) p ~ (p  q) 11  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Solution a) (p  q)  (p  q) P Q (p  q) (p  q) (p  q)  (p  q) T T T T T T F F T F F T F T T F F F F F b) p ~ (p  q) p q (p  q) ~ (p  q) p ~ (p  q) T T T F T T F F T T F T F T T F F F T T Example 1.4 By using the Truth Value Table, prove the following: a.

10.1.4 Converse/Inverse and Contra-Positive Statements If p  q is a conditional statement, then (if q then p) is called the converse statement of the conditional statement.
Example 1.6 Let p be the statement “2 + 2 = 5” and, q be the statement “Abuja is in U.K” Then p implies q, i.e.
p  q, i .e.
2 + 2 =5 implies that Abuja is in U.K.
The converse is that Abuja is in U.K. then 2 + 2 =5.
Example 1.7 13  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Let p be the statement “It is born again” and, q be the statement “He can see the kingdom of God Then, (~ p) Is “He is not born again” (~ q) Is “He cannot see the kingdom of God”.
 ~ q ~ p is called the contra-positive of p  q.
He cannot see the kingdom of God implies that he is not born again.
Where ~ p  ~ q is the inverse of p  q.
He is born again implies that He can see the kingdom of God.
4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, Logic as science of reasoning has been thoroughly dealt with in this section.
However, some real life happenings have been demonstrated in the examples and even in the summary below.
5.0 SUMMARY Consider proposition p and q respectively.
The converse of p  q and q is q  p The inverse of p  q is ~ p  ~ q While, the contra-positive of p  q is ~ q  ~ p The Truth Table of the above propositions, converse, inverse and contra- positive are show below: p q ~ p ~ q p  q ~ p ~ q ~ q ~ p q  p T T F F T T T T T F F T F T F T F T T F T F T F F F T T T T T T The analysis of the table above is: p  q  ~ q  ~ p, Contra-positive p  q  ~ p  ~ q, Inverse.

Say , let A = 3i+4j-5k be a vector.
Then, A = [3, 4, -5] is a row matrix.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  Inter-marry science and economic words using vector as a mathematical model of simplifying and solving problems.
45  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Vectors DEFINITION SCALARS: Scalars are quantities, which are completely specified by numbers, which measure their magnitude in terms of some chosen units, but have no definite direction in space.
Examples are: speed, energy, mass, density, time, length, work, temperature e.t.c.
Other quantities exist in engineering and science; however which have the property of direction, in addition to magnitude and these are called VECTORS” DEFINITION VECTOR: A vector is a physical quantity, which has magnitude and direction.
It can also be defined as a directed line segments.
Examples are: velocity, acceleration, displacement, force, e.t.c.
3.1.1 Types of Vectors These are:  Free Vectors,  Time and related Vectors,  Point located Vectors and  Position Vector.
1.
Free Vectors: These have magnitude and direction but have no particular position associated with them e.g.
Displacement.
A displacement vector 20km north is the same in Lagos, Ojo, or anywhere.
2.
Time Related Vectors: These are located along a straight line e.g.
Force.
Force acting on a rigid body always moves along their lines of action without changing its effect on the body.
3.
Point Located Vectors: this is a vector whose position in space is fixed in addition to its magnitude and direction.
e.g a position vector.
46  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 4.
Position Vector: this is a vector say PQ which is drawn from a fixed point P which gives the displacement of the point Q from the point P. The point P is called the initial point while the point Q is called the end point of the position vectorPQ.
3.1.2 Vector Representation A vector can be represented by directed line segment, where the length and direction of the segment corresponds to the magnitude and direction of the vectors.
B Y A AB A a A A 0 X 0 As can be seen above, a vector can be represented by ABAB or a Thus, the modulus (absolute value) of a vector aor ABis that positive number which is a measure of the length of the directed segment.
The modulus of ais denoted by a or AB 3.1.3 Definitions i. a is equal to „a‟ if „a‟ (the measure) is greater than zero i.e.
positive.
ii.
a is equal to zero if „a‟ = 0. iii.
a is equal to (- a) if „a‟ is less than zero.
47  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Mathematically, a can be stated thus: a If a  0 a = 0 If a = 0 -a If a  0 Specia l Cases i.
If AB = 0, then A = B and this is called a zero vector.
ii.
If AB = 1, then ABand this is called a unit vector.
This is represented as, or , respectively.
a b iii.
AB= BA are vectors of the same magnitude but in opposite direction.
B B a A a A A A   iv.
Equal Vectors: Two vectors aand b are said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction.
    If aandb , then = a and b .
Equal direction means that they are parallel 48  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Example Suppose that from Anthony Campus (A), a car moves 50km due east Maryland (M) and then 30km North east to Sheraton (S).
It would seem reasonable to say that the car has moved the distance represented by the length „AS‟ in the direction A to S. S 30km A 50km S 3.1.4 Vectors Addition The addition of two vectors is defined by the triangular rule   LetABandBCrepresent aandb , therefore the addition of ABandBC is      a+ b and is defined by a+ b =c .
C c b A B a AB+BC =AC , called resultant vector.
  To find the sum of two vectors aandb , we draw them as a chain; starting from the second where the first vector ends.
The sum cis then given by the single vector joining the start of the first to the end of the second vector.
If the point A, B and C are collinear (i.e.
Lie on the same straight line).
49  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS The law of vector addition still requires that AB+BC =AC .
Thus, A C B Although the ∆ABC has now vanished The sum of a number of vectors AB, BC, CD, DE can be obtained by drawing the vectors as chain and then systematically apply the triangular law of addition i.e.
: AB+ BC= AC AB+ BC+ CD= AC + CD = AD AB+ BC+ CD +DE = AD + DE = AE B C D A E Example 1 Find the sum ofAB, CB, CD, ED.

A good application of intercept of two lines is the “Market Equilibrium”.
Consider a linear demand and supply functions respectively.
At a point when the demand equals the supply, it simply means that intercepts of demand and supply functions.

Lines AB and CD can be solved simultaneously to evaluate the values of x and y respectively.
Example 7 Find the coordinate of the point of interception of the lines: (a) 2x + 3y = 5 (b) x + 2y = 3 Solution 2x + 3y = 5 ……………………..… ………………………….
(1) x + 2y = 3 ……………………….. ……………..…………….
(2) Equation (2) multiplies by 2 and subtract from Equation (1): 2x + 3y = 5 ……………… ……………………………..…….
(3) 2x + 4y = 6 ……………… ……………………..…………….
(4)  -y = 1  y = 1 Substitute y = 1 into eqn.
(1) or (2): 2x + 3y = 5  2x + 3(1) = 5  2x + 5 - 3 = 2  x = 1.
Thus, the coordinate of the point of interception is (1, 1).
Example 8 If UAC Foods use 10 bags of flour and 5 tins of butter to produce 100 raps of gala and UTC uses 15 bags of flour and 8 tins of butter to produce 120 raps of gala.
Find how many raps of gala that can be produced from 30 bags of flour and 15 tins of butter.
Solution Let F represent bag of Flour and T represent tin of Butter,  UAC: 10F + 5T = 100 …………………………………………….. (1)  UTC: 15F + 8T = 120 …………………………………………….. (2) 80  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Equations (1) and (2) can be solved simultaneously, Equation (1) divided by 5 and multiplies by 8, then subtract from equation (2): 16F + 8T = 160 ……………………………………………..……….. (3) 15F + 8T = 120 ……………………………………………..……….. (2) (3) – (2) F = 40 …………………………………………….. (4) Substitute F = 40 into eqn.
(1):  10F + 15T = 100  10(40) + 5T = 100  400 + 5T = 100  5T = 100 – 400 = -300 300  T = = -60 5  T = -60 ……………………………………………………….
(5)  The required equation is: 30F + 15T =?
…………………………………………..……….. (6) Substitute equations (4) and (5) into eqn.
(6):  30F + 15T =?
 30(40) + 15(-60) = 1200 – 900 = 300 raps of gala.

 The coordinate of the point of interception is (1, 2) y y  The equation of the line of P(1, 2) and slope2 is given by: m = 1 xx 1 y2  2 =  y - 2 = 2(x -1)  y - 2 = 2x - 2  y = 2x.

3 3.8 Application of Straight Lines to Business Demand: This is the amount of goods requested for by customers at any point in time.
The demand curve is the relationship between quantity and price of goods The demand curve can be represented in many forms such as Linear, Quadratic, Cubic etc.
Since we are concerned with straight lines in this section, we would be giving examples of linear demand curves.
Example 11 11 boxes of Lux soap are demanded for, each box costs N300.
20 boxes of Premier soap are also required by customers, each box costs N350.
Draw up a demand curve showing the relationship between demand for both products.
Solution The general demand function is given as q = mp + c; where: q is the quantity of goods demanded for; m is the gradient of demand function; p is the price of goods; and c is the constraint or intercept on demand function.
For Lux soap: When price (p) = N300, demand (q) = 11.
The demand equation is given as; 84  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 11 = 300m + c ………………………………………………… (1) For Premier soap: When price (p) = N350, demand (q) = 20.
The demand equation is given as; 20 = 350m + c ………………………………………………… (2) Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we have: 11 = 300m + c….
 c = 11 – 300m.
20 = 350m + c ………………………………………………….
(2).
Substitute c in equation (2), we have: 20 = 350m + 11 – 300m  20 = 50m + 11  50m = 9  m = 0.18.
Substitute m in equation (2), we have: 20 = 350(0.18) + c  20 +63 = c  c = -43.
From the general demand function is q = pm + c. Hence, the demand function of customers for Lux and Premier soap is given as: q = 0.18p - 43.
This shows the functional relationship between demands for both products.
3.9 Inequalities With inequalities, we can define intervals on the number scale.
This will enable graphs of functions to be easily defined.
Functions of inequalities can be Linear, Quadratic, etc.
Example 12 Solve and graph the following functions: 85  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS i.
18x – 3x2 > 0. ii.
(x + 3)(x – 2)(x – 4) < 0.
Solution i.
18x – 3x2 > 0.
Consider f(x) = 18x – 3x2 = 0.
 3x (6 – x) = 0.
 x = 0 or x = 6.
We determine the sign of 18x – 3x2 > 0 for the following intervals: x < 0; 0 < x < 6; and x > 6.
Picking numbers arbitrary for the above intervals, we fins out that x is satisfied for all x on the interval 0 < x < 6. x f(x) = 18x – 3x2 1 15 2 24 3 27 4 24 5 15 Graph of 18x – 3x2 > 0 f(x) 30 25 20 15 86 1 2 3 4 5  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS ii.
(x + 3)(x – 2)(x – 4) < 0.
Consider f(x) = (x + 3)(x – 2)(x – 4) = 0.
 x -3, 2, 4 respectively.
We consider the following intervals: x < -3; -3< x < 2; 2 < x > 4; and x > 4.
87  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Picking numbers arbitrary for the above intervals, we fins out that x is satisfies the following intervals x < -3 and 2 < x < 4. x f(x) = (x + 3)(x – 2)(x – 4) -4 -48 -5 -126 -6 -240 3 -6 Graph of (x + 3)(x – 2)(x -4) -6 -4 -2 2 4 6 50 100 150 200 250 4.0 CONCLUSION As in the summary 5.0 SUMMARY Straight line graph is dealt with, both parallel and perpendicular lines and their relationship to business problems.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to solve simple problems involving equation of a circle.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition A circle is the locus of a curve (equidistant from a point).
A circle could be described by its centre (fixed) and its radius.
The radius is the distance between the centre of the circle and the circumference.
y B(x, y) r A(a, b) X To form the equation of the circle, whose centre is the point A (a, b) and radius, „r‟ joined to point B(x, y) on the circumference.
Distance AB = r = (ya)2 (xb)2 …………………………… (1) Squaring both sides, we have: r2 = (y – a)2 + (x – b)2……………………………………………… (2) 90  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS This is the required equation.
Suppose the centre of the circle is located at the origin meaning that a = 0, b = 0; then the equation becomes: r2 = (y – 0)2 + (x – 0)2 = y2 + x2 …………………………...………… (3) This is equation of the circle with centre at the origin In gradient the equation (2) can be expanded thus: r2 = (y – a)2 + (x – b)2 = y2 – 2ay + a2 + x2 – 2bx + b2  y2 + x2 – 2ay – 2bx + a2 + b2 – r2 =0 …………………..………… (4)  y2 + x2 – 2gx – 2fy + (a2 + b2 – r2) =0 …………………………… (5) Where –a = f, -b = g and let a2 + b2 – r2 =c  y2 + x2 – 2gx – 2fy + c =0 …………………...…………………… (6) Example Find the equation of the circle centre (2, -3) and radius 4.
Solution The equation of the circle centre (2, -3) and radius 4 is: y (x, y) 4 91 (2, -3 )  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS  y2 + 6y + 9 + x2 – 4x + 4 = 16 [y – (-3)]2 + [x – 2]2 = 42  y2 + 6y + 9 + x2 – 4x + 4 = 16  y2 + x2 – 4x + 6y - 3 = 0.
3.2 Properties of Equation of a Circle 1.
The coefficient of the two variables x and y must be the same; 2.
There must be no term in xy and; 3.
The equation must be second degree or simply in second degree of x and y respectively.
Example Find the coordinate of the centre and the radius of the circle y2 + x2 – 14x -8y + 56 = 0 Solution The circle x2 + y2 – 14x -8y + 56 = 0 ……………………………….. (1) Collecting like terms:  x2 -14x + [ ] y2 – 8y + [ ] = -56 ………………………..………… (2) Fill-up the bracket to make each equation to be perfect square.
Find the half of the coefficients of x and y and square them and add to both sides: 1  { (14)}2 = [-7]2 = 49 ……………………………...…………… (3) 2 1  { (8)}2 = [-4]2 = 16 …………………………………………… (4) 2 92  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Equation (2) becomes:  x2 – 14x + 49 + y2 – 8y+ 16 = -56 + 49 + 16  x2 – 14x + 72 + y2 – 8y+ 42 = 9  (x – 7)2 + (y – 4)2 = 32 (7, 4) are the coordinates or centre of the circle, while 3 is the radius.
Alternative Solution Comparing x2 + y2 – 14x – 8y + 56 = 0 with x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, which is the general form.
 2g – 14  g = -7, and 2f = -8  f = -4 Where a and b are the coordinates, recall that –a = g and –b = f  a = 7, b = 4 (the coordinates).
Also, c = g2 + f2 – r2  56 = (-7)2 + (-4)2 – r2  56 = 49 + 16 – r2  r2 = 65 - 56  r2 = 9  r = 3 (the radius) Hence, the circle has centre (7, 4), radius 3.
4.0 CONCLUSION As in the summary 5.0 SUMMARY In summary, this unit discourses equation of circle.
Simple problems involving equation of circle and some properties of circle is also discoursed.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  State the properties on limits,  obtain limits at infinity,  identify the variables that could affect limits,  solve problems involving limits.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition Limits describe what happen to a function f(x), as its variable x approaches a particular number, say c. If the value f(x) is k as x approaches c, then, the number k is said to be the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches c. This statement can be written mathematically as: lim = k, or lim f(x) = f(c) xc xc  f(c )= k. The symbol xcmeans as x tends to c. It should be note that, if the function f(x) does not get closer and closer to a number as x gets closer to c, then, it means that the function f(x) has no limit as xc.

Consider a function f(x); f(x)is said to be continuous at the point x = c if the following holds: 1. f(x) exists as x  c 2.
If lim f(x) exists xc 3. lim f(x) = f(c) xc Example x2 25 Show that f(x) = is discontinuous at x = 5 x5 Solution x2 25 (x5)(x5) lim  lim lim(x5)5510     x5  x5  x5 (x5) x5 52 25 0 But f(5) =  ,undefined 55 0 Recall lim f(x) = f(5) x5  f(x) is not continuous at x = 5.

g(x) are continuous at x = c; f(x) 3.
Also ' quotient function is continuous at x = c, g(x) provided g(x) ≠ 0 at x = c. Example 1 kx + 3 for x < 2 Given the function H(x) = 3x2 – x + 3 for x ≥ 2 Find the values of „k‟ for which H(x) is continuous for all real values of k.

Example 2 OFN pig farms bid for the production and supply of 550kg piglet to U.A.C Nigeria Limited as follows: The fixed cost of producing the first 50 piglets is N25,000.00 and the variable cost, each is N500.00.
111  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS However, the variable cost per piglet of producing the next 50 piglets is N250.00 with a fixed cost of N30,000.00, while the variable cost per piglet for producing between 100 and 200 piglets is N 20.00 with a fixed cost of N35,000.00.
If a provision of N5,000.00 is made fro casualties and other necessities, find: i.
A functional model that describes the cost of producing the piglets; ii.
The points of discontinuity of the cost function; and iii.
The average cost of producing 50, 100 and 200 copies respectively.
Solution You will recall that the fixed cost is the cost that does not vary with the level of production.
Now, let y be the number of the piglets to be produced and supplied.
The cost of producing / supply of the first 50 piglets is: 300y + 25,000 ………………………………………………… (1) The cost of producing / supply of the next 50 piglets is: 250y + 30,000 …………………………………………………… (2) The cost of producing between 100 and 200 piglets is: 120y + 35,000 …………………………………………………….
(3) 300y + 25,000 for 0  y  5 0 f(xy) = 250y + 30,000 for 50  y  100 120y + 35,000 for 100  y  200 Therefore, the points of discontinuity are 50 and 100, since the points break the domain of the C(y) into three (3) intervals.
Thus (i):  limC(y)#300(50)#25,000#40,000 y50 112  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS  limC(y)#2500(50)#30,000#42,500 y50  limC(y)#250(100)#30,000#55,000 y50  limC(y)#120(100)#35,000#47,000 y50 Note that lim C(y)  lim C(y), also lim C(y)  lim C(y), y50 y50 y100 y100 (ii) Therefore, the function is discontinuous at y = 50 and y = 100.
Total Cost (iii) Average cost = Number of Piglets  Average cost of producing 50 piglets Total Cost of producing 50 piglets = 50 300(50)25,000 40,000 =  50 50 = N800  Average cost of producing 100 piglets Total Cost of producing 100 piglets = 100 250(100)30,000 55,000 =  100 100 = N550  Average cost of producing 50 piglets Total Cost of producing 200 piglets = 200 120(200)35,000 59,000 =  200 200 = N295 4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, all polynomial functions are continuous, as are all rational functions, except where undefined, i.e.
where their denominators are zero.
Consequently, for any function to be continuous, the limit must exist.
113  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 5.0 SUMMARY We discussed about limit, if the functional values f(x) of a function f draws closer to one and only one finite real number L for values of x as x draws closer to a from both sides, but does not equal a, L is defined as the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is written lim f(x)  L xa Furthermore, we discussed continuity.
A continuous function is one which has no breaks in its curve.
It can be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper.
A function is continuous at x = a if the three properties mentioned above exists.
Practical examples related to business were illustrated.

At point of inflexion, the turning points are equal (a double stationary point).
At point of inflexion, the value of the stationary point at the second derivative is zero(0).

The resource limitations are represented graphically by areas which when combined form a feasibility region.
The point on the feasibility region boundary that optimizes the objective function (usually maximizing profit or minimizing costs) is found by plotting an arbitrary value of the objective function on the graph and moving it away from (for maximization) or towards (for minimization) the origin until the last point of the feasibility region is obtained.
In order to apply linear programming, there must be as its title suggests a linear relationship between the factors.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to:  examine and identify the field of application of linear programming such as : 1.
Mixing problems.
2.
Limited capacity is allocated to products so as to yield maximum profits.
3.
Transportation problem.
4.

6.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Method of Linear Programming 140  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS Linear programming reduces the kind of problems outlined above to “series of linear expressions” and then uses these expressions to discover the best solution to achieve a given objective.
3.2 Step in Linear Programming Step 1: Define the constraints (i.e.
the limitations that must be placed on the variables.
Step 2: Graph the constraints.
Step 3: Define the objective function.
Step 4: Manipulate the objective function to find the optimum feasible solution.
Linear programming is best illustrated by means of an example: Example 1 (Graphical Method) Bolat Properties Nigeria Limited took the construction of chalets and roads in AJIBOLA ESTATE, LEKKI.
Each chalets and road constructed passes through material-purchases process and constructing or assembling process.
One chalet which makes a contribution of N50T, takes six hours material purchasing time, and four hours construction or assemblage time.
While one road makes a contribution of N40T, takes three hours material purchasing time and eight hours construction time.
There is a maximum of thirty-six purchasing of materials hours available each week and forty-eight construction hours respectively.
Let x be the number of chalets constructed each week.
y be the number of roads constructed each week.
If 1 chalet requires 6 hours for material purchase, Then, x chalets requires 8x hours for material purchase.
If a road requires 3 hours for material purchase, Then y roads require 3y hours for material purchase.
Hence, total time to purchase materials is (6x + 3y) hours.
Similarly, the total time required to construct x chalets and y roads is (4x + 8y) hours.
Step 1: Define the Constraints.
The constraints are the amount of time available for material purchases and construction.
141  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS The best way of setting out the constraints is to place the units available on the left and those utilized on the right; the inequality sign is the link.
Constraints Available Utilized Material purchased 36 ≥ (6x + 3y) Construction time 48  (4x + 8y) In addition, the logic constraints must be stated i.e 0  x and 0  y.
These simply states that there cannot be negative amounts of chalets and roads.
Hence, the constraints are: i.
6x + 3y  36. ii.
4x + 8y  48.
Step 2: Graphical Constraints.
Thus, x and y are each set to zero in turn and value of y and x computed in those circumstances.
For the equation: 6x + 3y = 36.
36 When x 0,y  12.
3 36 When y 0,x  6.
6 For the equation: 4x + 8y = 48.
48 When x 0,y  6.
8 48 When y 0,x  12.
4 It is then necessary to decide which side of the equality represents the feasible solution space.
Where the constraint is of the formaxby c, as in both of the above cases, the values of x and y can lie anywhere on the line or below it.
If the constraints is of the formaxby c, x and y can only lie on the line or above it.
This is the above example, x and y must be on or below the line 6x3y 36and on or above the line4x8y 48; they must also be0.
142  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS i.e.
Not below the x-axis and not to the left of the y-axis.
The constraints can now be represented graphically: y 12 11 10 6x + 3y = 36 9 8 7 6 P 5 Q 4 4x + 8y = 48 3 2 1 R 0 x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The area OPQR which is shaded represents the feasible solutions i.e.
Combinations of the two products which are achievable given the constraints.
The problem is to find the optimum solution.
Step 3: Define the Objective Function The objective is to maximize contribution C, given by: c 50x40y Step 4: Manipulate the Objective (Function) There are two approaches to this final step: a) By inspection, it is cleat that the maximum contribution will lie on one of the corners; P, Q, R-!
be optimal solution can be leached simply by calculating the Contribution at each; or b) By drawing an Iso-contribution fine, which is a line where a point represents an equal contribution.
This is the recommended approach particularly for more complex problems.
143  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS 3.3 Slack Slack is the amount by which a resource is under utilized.
It will occur when the “optimum point does not full the given resource line.
In the above example, the optimum point Q lies on both the material purchase and construction time lines; therefore, both resources are fully utilized.
This can be checked from the constraint inequalities by solving the two simultaneous equations for the two constraints boundaries.
Point Q is the intersection of the lines.
6x + 3y =36 …………………………………………… (1) 4x + 8y = 48 ……………………………………………….. (2) x (2) – 2 x (1) gives: 18y = 72 72 y   4.
18 Substituting y into (1) gives:  6x + 3(4) =36.
 6x = 36 – 12=24.
x = 24/6 = 4 x = y = 4.
Thus, the maximum contribution is obtained when four chalets and four roads per week are constructed.
The maximum contribution is: C = 50x + 40y,  C = 50(4) + 40(4),  C = 200 + 160.
 C = N360T.
From the constraint inequalities, x = y =4, Material purchasing time available: = 36.
Utilized = 6x + 3y = 6(4) + 3(4) = 24 + 12 = 36.
Construction time available: equals 48, (Utilized = 4x + 8y = 4(4) + 8(4) = 16 + 32 = 48.
Hence, all available time in both department is Utilized.
144  BUSINESS MATHEMATICS If, however, the optimum had been at P(x = 0, y = 6), then because P does not lie on the material purchase time line, there would be slack material purchasing time.
Material purchasing time utilized = 6x3y (6 x 0 ) (3 x 6)  18; Slack = 36 – 18 = 18 hours Slack is important because unused resources can be put to another use e.g.
hired out to another construction company?
