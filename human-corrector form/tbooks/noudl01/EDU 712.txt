9EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT At the end of the course, you will need to submit a practicum report, and a letter to certify your presence at the institution where you practised.
The course should take you about 17 weeks in total to complete.
Below you will find listed all the components of the course, what you have to do and how you should allocate your time to each module in order to complete the course successfully on time.
Course Materials Major components of the course are: 1 Course Guide 2 Study modules 3 Introduction letter to an establishment 4 Assignment File 5 Presentation schedule Study Units Module 1 Theoretical Information on the Following The meaning and purposes of practicum in Educational Management Guidelines on the practicum exercise Planning for the commencement of practicum The first week of the practicum Keeping a log book Participant’s contribution to institutional management Procedure for supervision Report writing The final days of practicum Institutional response in practicum Module 2 Practical Aspects Involving Documents Needed for the Practicum The first module is an indepth explanation of the meaning and purposes or relevance of the practicum exercise.
The detail guidelines and instructions to be strictly adhered to are also enumerated, the plans that could be put in place for the actual commencement of the practicum and the detail of the essential things to do in the first week of the practicum.
The next aspect concerns the actual performance of the participant and the function of the supervisor in the success of the practicum.
The second module is a vital one that gives a comprehensive feedback of the 10 EDA712 MODULE 2 two exercises (practicum) in the form of report writing, and gives an institutional evaluation of the performance of the participants.
Each of the modules consists of specific objectives, direction for study, reading materials and other sources.
All these will help you to have an understanding of what is expected of you during the practicum period.
The Assignment File In this file you will find all the details of the work you must submit to your tutor for marking.
The mark you obtain for these exercises will count towards the final work you obtain for this course.
Further information on assignment will be found in the Assignment File itself and later in this course Guide in the section on assessment.
The Presentation Schedule The presentation schedule included in your course materials gives you the important dates for the semester for the completion of tutor-marked assignments, and for attending tutorials.
Remember to submit all your assignments by the due date.
You should guard against falling behind in your work.
Assessment There are three aspects to the assessment of the course.
First, there is full attendance at the practical venue, second, an evaluation (supervision) of the practicum exercise and lastly, the submission of a written report on the practicum, by the student.
In tackling the assessment, you are expected to apply information, knowledge, experiences and techniques gathered during the course.
Your final report on the practicum must be submitted to your tutor for formal assessment in accordance with the deadline stated in the Presentation Schedule and the Assignment File.
Your internal/in- house supervisor will account for 20% of your course mark.
The external supervision from NOUN will evaluate you for 30% and the final report submitted after the practicum period will be 50% of your total course mark.
Tutor-Marked Assignment Supervision will be carried out in two phases, one by the internal supervisor, that is, the head of your establishment and the other by the external supervisor who is from NOUN.
11EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT Supervision involves an observation of your activities and performance, and the basic information in your log book.
The external supervision will come up at least two times before the expiration of the six weeks practicum.
If for any reason you will not be available for supervision, contact your supervisor or the Study Centre before the time so that the possibility of an extension will be worked out.
Final Grading For the purpose of the practicum, a written report will be submitted not later than a week after the exercise will be fixed, and it will have a value of 50% of the total course grade.
The report will be expected to follow the format that has been laid down for the course.
The final grading covers information on all that happened during the practicum.
Course Marking Scheme The following table lays out how the actual course marking is broken down.
Table 1: Course Marking Scheme Assessment Marks Internal Supervision To account for 20% of course mark External Supervision To account for 30% of overall course mark Final Grading (Practicum 50% of overall course mark Report) Total 100% of course marks How to Get the Most from this Course In distance learning, the study module replaces the university lecturer.
This is one of the improved aspects of distance learning; you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace, and at a time and place that suits you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to a lecturer.
In the same way that a lecturer might set you some readings to do, the study module guides you on how to undertake the practical work (Practicum).
Just as a lecturer might give you an in-class exercise/orientation.
Just as a lecturer might give you in-class exercise, your study units follow a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the subject matter of the unit and how a particular unit is integrated with the other units and the course as a whole.
Next is a set of learning objectives.
12 EDA712 MODULE 2 These objectives inform you about what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
You should use these objectives to guide your study.
When you have finished the unit; you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If you make a habit of doing this, you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.

It is designed to develop in the students the relevant skills that are required of them in the management of educational institutions in the executive capacity.
This course is one of the first semester courses for the 700 level programme of M.Ed Educational Administration and Planning, and it is a compulsory course.
It is expected that students will be able to broaden their knowledge of educational management when they are exposed to the practice and realities of various institutions.
In this module, you will be given all the theoretical information about the practicum.
Such information will include the following: • The meaning and purposes of practicum • Guidelines for the practicum exercise • Procedures for the commencement of the practicum • Commencement of practicum 19EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT • Participants’ contribution to the practice of management • Writing the practicum report • Supervision • Winding up the practicum • End of practicum formalities 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this module, you should be able to: • explain the meaning of practicum and the purposes for which it was introduced; • read and list the guidelines on the practicum exercise; • describe the procedure for the commencement of practicum; • identify the various functions expected of them during the period of practicum; • demonstrate an acquisition of basic management principles and practices; • illustrate how the management principles were practicalized and subsequently reported; • discuss management principles and practices intelligently with C.E.O, school principals, heads of departments and supervisors • write a final report of their experiences during the practicum period.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Meaning and Purposes of Practicum in Educational Management Practicum is an activity that has to do with the practice of acquiring knowledge and skills in a particular field or discipline.
In the case of Educational Management, the practicum is organised to assist the students to gain experience and also expose them to the actual practice of the numerous theories and concepts, skills and principles that might have been studied during the course work.
It is, therefore, an experiential skill-building/perceptorship course in educational management.
Students shall be acquainted with all aspects of administration in educational institutions.
It will be an enriching experience for the student in areas of leadership, decision – making, planning, organizing, staffing, coordination and possibly budgeting where the need arises.
The practicum period will also assist the student to exhibit some personal characteristics and qualities expected of an 20 EDA712 MODULE 2 Administrator/Manager.
Such qualities include maturity, tactfulness, intelligence, kindness, sympathy, honesty, being considerate, accommodating and impartial as the case may be.
Students are, therefore, to observe, study and evaluate the educational administrators/ managers in the establishments that they are undertaking the practicum in their activities and also to promote the quality of educational management in these establishments.
3.1.1 Guidelines for the Practicum Exercise in Educational Management The practicum exercise will be carried out for a period of six weeks in the semester.
During this time the student is expected to be in the organization 5 days of the week and for a minimum of 4 hours a day.
Type of Establishment or Organization: it is advisable that students should identify educational institutions such as: Ministry of Education Local Government Secretariat/Local Government Education Authority (LGEA) State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Zonal Schools Board/Education Districts Secondary Schools Primary Schools Technical Schools Universities Colleges of Education Polytechnics Other Education Agencies such as WAEC, NECO, NERDC, NTI, NABTEB, NIEPA and Private Schools with a population of not less than 1,000 students.
3.1.2 Relationship with the Establishment By training, an administrator is expected to be receptive, polite, diligent, friendly, trustworthy, warm and tactful; this list of human relations practices is inexhaustible.
Therefore, it is expected that all these will find expression with the relationship of the student and the establishment where the practicum will take place.
Students are expected to establish good rapport with their host (organization) to make their stay or period of practicum a fruitful one.
All laws and regulations governing the establishment are binding on such students.
21EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT 3.1.3 Procedure for the Commencement of the Practicum A formal letter of introduction will be made available to students from the National Open University of Nigeria.
The student has a duty to identify an establishment among the recommended educational institutions.
When a participant has secured a place in an establishment, he/she has to inform the Study Centre Manager of the name of the institution, the time/period he/she will be available and other relevant information.
The student should negotiate with the institution for a position that will enable him/her to practise effectively.
These are temporary positions meant for the period of the practicum exercise.
Examples of such positions are: Administrative Officer, Duty-Master, House Mistress/Master, Form Masters, Public Relations Officer, Vice-Principal, Guidance Counsellor, Acting Head of Department, School Inspector, Secretary at staff meetings, Examination Officer, Games Master/Mistress, and so on.
3.1.4 Commencement of the Practicum The first week of the practicum is usually referred to as the week of orientation.
The participant/student has to familiarize himself/herself with the establishment.
It is expected that when the participant officially reports to the Chief Executive of the institution, he/she will be introduced to the top hierarchy of the establishment and to other important and relevant units or divisions.
The trained administrator needs to go a step further by being friendly with the people in the establishment.
By so doing, he gets to learn more of the environment and the different functions.
This will assist the student to be able to identify an institutional need where he/she can be of use.
In the absence of any immediate need, the student should be thinking of any new innovation that could be introduced to help improve the establishment.
Sometimes, the head of the establishment could assign a problematic task to the student.
This should be seen as a challenge and an opportunity to gain experience and put into practice the many concepts, skills, principles and theories of management that have been studied.
It is also expected that the student will establish good rapport with the institution and the staff to assist him obtain on the spot information clarification of problems and expectedly by being involved in solving such problems.
22 EDA712 MODULE 2 Where it is possible, the student could share the period of six weeks among as many units as he/she desires to assist in having a broader experience and exposure.
During the period of orientation, the student has the opportunity to under-study the officers and get to know their style of administration.
Keeping a Log Book: This is a very important activity and it commences immediately the practicum takes off.
The student is expected to keep this Log book in order to be able to record his/her daily activities in the institution, whether favourable or otherwise for the six weeks of practicum.
3.1.5 Participants’ Contribution to the Practice of Management Apart from introducing new innovation, participants should watch out for these areas as a guide in writing or compiling their reports and experiences.

Security and safety measures 3.1.6 Supervision of Practicum This is an important aspect of the practicum exercise.
In order that the institution, the student and the organizers of the programme benefit from the practicum, it is imperative that an evaluation exercise is carried out.
In this context, the tutor from the National Open University will visit the 23EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT student on practicum at least twice.
It is suggested that this visit should come within the space of three weeks from the commencement of the exercise when it is expected that the student would have stabilized himself/herself.
The second supervision could take place during the 5th or 6th week of the practicum exercise.
The supervisor is expected to inspect the log book and based on report of daily activities, advise the student in areas where there is need for improvement.
The supervisor is also expected to oversee the activities carried out by the student on the day of the visit so as to practically assess the student on the spot.
All such comments are meant to improve the activities throughout the period.
The student should make it a duty to see the supervisor at least twice before the end of the practicum period.
First in the early weeks of commencement and second in the latter weeks of the exercise.
This is to assist in solving any problem that the student may confront.
There is also an internal assessment to be conducted by the head of the institution, so that the student can have a fair assessment, altogether.
There are two different forms designed specifically for the supervision; forms A and B, for the external and internal supervisors respectively.
3.1.7 Writing the Practicum Report (Format) This report is to be written by the student.
It is expected to be a build-up of all the events that took place during the six weeks of the practicum and to come up under the following sub-headings: 1.
Introduction 2.
Profile of the Organisation including instrument of establishment and its organisation of administration 3.
Operational functions of the Organisation 4.
Schedules on Attachment to reflect the major divisions under which the student worked 5.
Observations 6.
Conclusion 7.
Recommendation.
The report should be submitted in triplicate not later than one week after the end of the practicum period.
The complete report should be processed and neatly bound.
3.1.8 Winding up the Practicum Just as a familiarization/orientation process was undertaken at the beginning of the practicum exercise, it is also imperative to wind up the practicum by going to the sections, or departments to inform the staff members about the completion of the practicum.
24 EDA712 MODULE 2 There should be an organised formal meeting with the head of the establishment, the heads of department and other personnel where need be.
The student should be able to write an official report to formally end the practicum exercise.
3.1.9 End of Practicum Formalities At the end of the practicum period of six weeks, the university will appreciate a letter of certification from the establishment where the student had the practicum.
Such a letter would be used as an official evidence of the student’s participation and attendance at the institution.
Also, at the end of the Practicum and its evaluation, the Study Centre Director is to forward the underlisted to the Dean, School of Education, National Open University of Nigeria, Headquarters, Victoria Island, Lagos: 1.
Log Book 2.
Supervisors’ Report (Internal and External) 3.
Student’s Report.
4.0 CONCLUSION Management has become the central activity of any enterprise.
It determines the rate and quality of progress of the enterprise as well as its effectiveness.
In more specific terms, and from the point of view of what is usually referred to as administrative process or management function, it implies directing, planning, programming, personnel and equipment management, output and time control, the conduct of meetings and communication in all feasible directions.
Educational administration is important both as a human activity and as an intellectual discipline.
Therefore, practicum in educational management is to provide prospective practitioners with some basic tools in the field of administration.
Finally, it is necessary to state that educational management and educational administration are terms used interchangeably, because the processes of administration and management are identically defined by their functional elements.
25EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT 5.0 SUMMARY In this module, we have been able to discuss the various aspects of the theoretical background to the course on practicum in educational management.
We examined its meaning and purposes, the guidelines, procedure, commencement, participation and contribution of the student, the place of supervision, and the writing of the practicum report.

It is designed to develop in the students the relevant skills that are required of them in the management of educational institutions in the executive capacity.
This course is one of the first semester courses for the 700 level programme of M.Ed Educational Administration and Planning, and it is a compulsory course.
It is expected that students will be able to broaden their knowledge of educational management when they are exposed to the practice and realities of various institutions.
In this module, you will be given all the theoretical information about the practicum.
Such information will include the following: • The meaning and purposes of practicum • Guidelines for the practicum exercise • Procedures for the commencement of the practicum • Commencement of practicum 39EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT • Participants’ contribution to the practice of management • Writing the practicum report • Supervision • Winding up the practicum • End of practicum formalities 9.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this module, you should be able to: • explain the meaning of practicum and the purposes for which it was introduced; • read and list the guidelines on the practicum exercise; • describe the procedure for the commencement of practicum; • identify the various functions expected of them during the period of practicum; • demonstrate an acquisition of basic management principles and practices; • illustrate how the management principles were practicalized and subsequently reported; • discuss management principles and practices intelligently with C.E.O, school principals, heads of departments and supervisors • write a final report of their experiences during the practicum period.
10.0 MAIN CONTENT 10.1 The Meaning and Purposes of Practicum in Educational Management Practicum is an activity that has to do with the practice of acquiring knowledge and skills in a particular field or discipline.
In the case of Educational Management, the practicum is organised to assist the students to gain experience and also expose them to the actual practice of the numerous theories and concepts, skills and principles that might have been studied during the course work.
It is, therefore, an experiential skill-building/perceptorship course in educational management.
Students shall be acquainted with all aspects of administration in educational institutions.
It will be an enriching experience for the student in areas of leadership, decision – making, planning, organizing, staffing, coordination and possibly budgeting where the need arises.
The practicum period will also assist the student to exhibit some personal characteristics and qualities expected of an 40 EDA712 MODULE 2 Administrator/Manager.
Such qualities include maturity, tactfulness, intelligence, kindness, sympathy, honesty, being considerate, accommodating and impartial as the case may be.
Students are, therefore, to observe, study and evaluate the educational administrators/ managers in the establishments that they are undertaking the practicum in their activities and also to promote the quality of educational management in these establishments.
10.1.1 Guidelines for the Practicum Exercise in Educational Management The practicum exercise will be carried out for a period of six weeks in the semester.
During this time the student is expected to be in the organization 5 days of the week and for a minimum of 4 hours a day.
Type of Establishment or Organization: it is advisable that students should identify educational institutions such as: Ministry of Education Local Government Secretariat/Local Government Education Authority (LGEA) State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Zonal Schools Board/Education Districts Secondary Schools Primary Schools Technical Schools Universities Colleges of Education Polytechnics Other Education Agencies such as WAEC, NECO, NERDC, NTI, NABTEB, NIEPA and Private Schools with a population of not less than 1,000 students.
10.1.2 Relationship with the Establishment By training, an administrator is expected to be receptive, polite, diligent, friendly, trustworthy, warm and tactful; this list of human relations practices is inexhaustible.
Therefore, it is expected that all these will find expression with the relationship of the student and the establishment where the practicum will take place.
Students are expected to establish good rapport with their host (organization) to make their stay or period of practicum a fruitful one.
All laws and regulations governing the establishment are binding on such students.
41EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT 3.1.3 Procedure for the Commencement of the Practicum A formal letter of introduction will be made available to students from the National Open University of Nigeria.
The student has a duty to identify an establishment among the recommended educational institutions.
When a participant has secured a place in an establishment, he/she has to inform the Study Centre Manager of the name of the institution, the time/period he/she will be available and other relevant information.
The student should negotiate with the institution for a position that will enable him/her to practise effectively.
These are temporary positions meant for the period of the practicum exercise.
Examples of such positions are: Administrative Officer, Duty-Master, House Mistress/Master, Form Masters, Public Relations Officer, Vice-Principal, Guidance Counsellor, Acting Head of Department, School Inspector, Secretary at staff meetings, Examination Officer, Games Master/Mistress, and so on.
3.1.6 Commencement of the Practicum The first week of the practicum is usually referred to as the week of orientation.
The participant/student has to familiarize himself/herself with the establishment.
It is expected that when the participant officially reports to the Chief Executive of the institution, he/she will be introduced to the top hierarchy of the establishment and to other important and relevant units or divisions.
The trained administrator needs to go a step further by being friendly with the people in the establishment.
By so doing, he gets to learn more of the environment and the different functions.
This will assist the student to be able to identify an institutional need where he/she can be of use.
In the absence of any immediate need, the student should be thinking of any new innovation that could be introduced to help improve the establishment.
Sometimes, the head of the establishment could assign a problematic task to the student.
This should be seen as a challenge and an opportunity to gain experience and put into practice the many concepts, skills, principles and theories of management that have been studied.
It is also expected that the student will establish good rapport with the institution and the staff to assist him obtain on the spot information clarification of problems and expectedly by being involved in solving such problems.
42 EDA712 MODULE 2 Where it is possible, the student could share the period of six weeks among as many units as he/she desires to assist in having a broader experience and exposure.
During the period of orientation, the student has the opportunity to under-study the officers and get to know their style of administration.
Keeping a Log Book: This is a very important activity and it commences immediately the practicum takes off.
The student is expected to keep this Log book in order to be able to record his/her daily activities in the institution, whether favourable or otherwise for the six weeks of practicum.
3.1.7 Participants’ Contribution to the Practice of Management Apart from introducing new innovation, participants should watch out for these areas as a guide in writing or compiling their reports and experiences.

Security and safety measures 3.1.6 Supervision of Practicum This is an important aspect of the practicum exercise.
In order that the institution, the student and the organizers of the programme benefit from the practicum, it is imperative that an evaluation exercise is carried out.
In this context, the tutor from the National Open University will visit the 43EDA712 PRACTICUM IN EDUCATION MANAGEMENT student on practicum at least twice.
It is suggested that this visit should come within the space of three weeks from the commencement of the exercise when it is expected that the student would have stabilized himself/herself.
The second supervision could take place during the 5th or 6th week of the practicum exercise.
The supervisor is expected to inspect the log book and based on report of daily activities, advise the student in areas where there is need for improvement.
The supervisor is also expected to oversee the activities carried out by the student on the day of the visit so as to practically assess the student on the spot.
All such comments are meant to improve the activities throughout the period.
The student should make it a duty to see the supervisor at least twice before the end of the practicum period.
First in the early weeks of commencement and second in the latter weeks of the exercise.
This is to assist in solving any problem that the student may confront.
There is also an internal assessment to be conducted by the head of the institution, so that the student can have a fair assessment, altogether.
There are two different forms designed specifically for the supervision; forms A and B, for the external and internal supervisors respectively.
3.1.7 Writing the Practicum Report (Format) This report is to be written by the student.
It is expected to be a build-up of all the events that took place during the six weeks of the practicum and to come up under the following sub-headings: 1.
Introduction 2.
Profile of the Organisation including instrument of establishment and its organisation of administration 3.
Operational functions of the Organisation 4.
Schedules on Attachment to reflect the major divisions under which the student worked 5.
Observations 6.
Conclusion 7.
Recommendation.
The report should be submitted in triplicate not later than one week after the end of the practicum period.
The complete report should be processed and neatly bound.
3.1.8 Winding up the Practicum Just as a familiarization/orientation process was undertaken at the beginning of the practicum exercise, it is also imperative to wind up the practicum by going to the sections, or departments to inform the staff members about the completion of the practicum.
44 EDA712 MODULE 2 There should be an organised formal meeting with the head of the establishment, the heads of department and other personnel where need be.
The student should be able to write an official report to formally end the practicum exercise.
3.1.10 End of Practicum Formalities At the end of the practicum period of six weeks, the university will appreciate a letter of certification from the establishment where the student had the practicum.
Such a letter would be used as an official evidence of the student’s participation and attendance at the institution.
Also, at the end of the Practicum and its evaluation, the Study Centre Director is to forward the underlisted to the Dean, School of Education, National Open University of Nigeria, Headquarters, Victoria Island, Lagos: 1.
Log Book 2.
Supervisors’ Report (Internal and External) 3.
Student’s Report.
11.0 CONCLUSION Management has become the central activity of any enterprise.
It determines the rate and quality of progress of the enterprise as well as its effectiveness.
In more specific terms, and from the point of view of what is usually referred to as administrative process or management function, it implies directing, planning, programming, personnel and equipment management, output and time control, the conduct of meetings and communication in all feasible directions.
Educational administration is important both as a human activity and as an intellectual discipline.
Therefore, practicum in educational management is to provide prospective practitioners with some basic tools in the field of administration.
Finally, it is necessary to state that educational management and educational administration are terms used interchangeably, because the processes of administration and management are identically defined by their functional elements.
