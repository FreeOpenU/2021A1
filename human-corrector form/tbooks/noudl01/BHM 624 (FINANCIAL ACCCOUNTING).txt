This unit will cover the meaning of Accounting, and consider, whether Accounting is a science or an art.
Derived from the definition, the accounting cycle will be explained before considering the concepts and conventions which guide in accounts preparation.
Lastly, the purpose and uses of accounts will be discussed with emphasis on the categories of user groups of accounting or financial information.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Explain the meaning of accounting; - Say whether accounting is a science or an art; - Enumerate and discuss the accounting concepts and conventions; - Explain the various uses of accounting information; and - Discuss the accounting cycle.
1 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 AN OVERVIEW OF ACCOUNTING 3.1 Definition of Accounting Accounting can be viewed from different perspectives by authors, teachers and practitioners, but can best be thought of as a process of handling information of economic or financial in nature.
This information forms the basis for financial reporting.
The process could be seen in the light of the following: - As an activity performed by Accountants and their supporting staff; - As a system comprising several interrelated and interdependent parts; - As a technique of management for planning and control purposes, and - As a discipline of study.
Accounting is basically a service function designed to inform management and other interested parties like analysts, investors, creditors, shareholders, about the financial implications and their effects on the organisation.
From the foregoing, therefore, Accounting can be said to be the language of business; it can be seen as a management tool, as their reports provide the basis for planning, and initiating control measures.
A generally accepted definition of Accounting has it that it is “the art of recording, classifying and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at best, of a financial character, and interpreting the result thereof”.
At this point, let us mention the two major branches of accounting, which are: - Financial accounting - Management accounting.
Details of these would be given in Unit 2.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain what Accounting means.
2 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.2 Accounting: A Science or An Art?
Arguments exist as to whether Accounting is a science or an art.
Interestingly, these arguments reveal some features of accounting which may be of benefit, especially, to a new entrant into the discipline, to understand its methodology.
Accounting is not a natural science like chemistry or physics, although by the benevolence of more modern definitions of science, it is scientific to the extent that it applies scientific methods of observation, experiment and measurement in the course of processing financial information for use by management.
On the other hand, art stresses the human attributes of imagination and judgement.
Accounting tends to draw from both science and art, but cannot be said to belong to either one.
As a science, it is a body of organised knowledge and uses systematic procedures to obtain results.
However, it is not an exact science because its results are not conclusive.
For example, given the same set of economic data, two Accountants can reach different conclusions.
On the other hand, it is not an exact art because it employs a great deal of human skill rather than judgement.
From the foregoing, accounting can be referred to as a management science because it is a tool of management for planning and control.
It can be called a social science as well.
In conclusion, therefore, accounting is neither science nor art in the strictest sense of it.
Self-Assessed Exercise Is accounting a science or an art?
3.3 The Accounting Cycle From the generally accepted definition of accounting in 3.1 above, derives the Accounting Cycle, which refers to series of stages necessary to produce the financial reports.
The stages are: - identifying of transactions - measuring of economic changes - recording of transactions in the relevant books - communicating of financial information associated with economic events.
Please, note that the objective of the Accounting system is to produce financial reports about the organisation.
3 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the Accounting Cycle.
3.4 Accounting Concepts and Conventions There are seven basic concepts or principles in Accounting, modified by three conventions, which have been adopted as a general guide to practice.
3.4.1 The Business Entity Concept This concept suggests that the business is separate from the owner.
Therefore, all accounts are kept in respect of the business entities which are distinct from persons who own or manage them.
It then follows that the personal financial affairs of the owners are never intermingled with those of the business for which the accounting is being performed.
3.4.2 Money as a common unit of Account This concept speaks to the fact that accounts are expressed in monetary terms which can be added or subtracted.
This gives a meaningful financial description.
The implication of this concept is that any information that cannot be measured in naira terms, such as the quality and experience of workers, is usually not included in the financial statements.
3.4.3 The Cost Concept The historical cost concept, as this may be called, says that assets (resources acquired by a business) are reflected at cost, which means that for their subsequent treatment in the measurement of the income of the business, the price paid on such acquisitions form the basis instead of their real or market values.
3.4.4 The Going Concern Concept This concept assumes that the business will continue operations for the foreseeable future, that is, it has no plans to either liquidate or cut down significantly any major line of its operations in the nearest future.
4 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.4.5 The Accrual Concept The concept accommodates all revenues and expenses to be received or charged in a given accounting period irrespective of what is actually received or paid.
3.4.6 The Concept of Duality The duality concept determines that the financial situation of the enterprise be represented in terms of the basic accounting equation.
Thus, it recognises that each transaction involves two entries in the same set of accounts, that is, every credit must have a corresponding debit and vice versa.
This will be treated in details under the Double Entry system.
3.4.7 Realization Concept The realization concept assumes that revenue is earned on the day which it is realised, and that is, when goods are transferred to the customer in exchange for a valuable consideration.
3.4.8 Accounting Conventions You will recall that we said that there are three conventions which guide the application of the concepts in practice, and they are as follows: - Conservatism / Prudence Here, the profit is understated while all possible losses are anticipated and taken into books, all possible future profits will be ignored.
- Consistency There should be consistency in the use of a particular accounting method for a reasonable period of time so that comparisons between accounting periods will be meaningful.
- Materiality The size of an amount will influence its treatment in the books of account, depending on individual entities.
Therefore, what may be considered material in any circumstance is judgemental.
5 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Self-Assessed Exercise Name and discuss four accounting concepts and two conventions.
3.5 Purpose / Uses of Accounting We can categorise the various uses of accounts and their user groups as follows: - Direct Users The direct uses of accounts made by the managers and shareholders are for planning and control purposes.
While the managers use accounting information to assess the viability of the business and to make future decisions, shareholders require the information to know whether the business is doing well or not, profit-wise.
- Indirect Users Those in this group include financial analysts, creditors, investors, tax authorities, employees and customers.
For example, the prospective investor would like to be assured of the security and profitability of his investment; the creditor will determine whether a business will be able to pay its debt as and when due; the employees will even use the information to bargain for a better package; and the tax authorities will be able to calculate the tax liabilities.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the user groups of accounting information.
4.0 CONCLUSION Accounting can be regarded as the language of business.
The information, when generated, serves both as tool for planning and control, and evidence of financial position.
Shareholders, managers, financial analysts, creditors, investors and the tax authorities, use accounting information as of benefit.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have defined accounting and classified it into two major branches.
We have also explained that Accounting is neither a science nor an art, but can best be regarded as a management science discipline.
6 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Attempts were made to explain the accounting cycle.
Also, we discussed the seven accounting concepts and three conventions.
Lastly, the uses of accounting information were discussed under the categories of the direct and indirect users.

7 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 2 INTRODUCING FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONTENTS Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Introducing Financial Accounting 3.1 Definition of Financial Accounting 3.2 Purpose of Financial Accounting 3.3 Focus of Financial Accounting 3.4 Financial Accounting and Management Accounting Compared 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In Unit 1, we mentioned that there are two major branches of accounting, namely; Financial Accounting and Management Accounting.
Unit 2 is designed to define these branches, and emphasize the purpose and focus of financial accounting.
In addition, there will be a comparison of these branches, which will dwell greatly on their focus.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Define Financial accounting; - Explain the purpose and focus of financial accounting; - Make a comparison between financial accounting and management accounting.
3.0 INTRODUCING FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1 Definition of Financial Accounting Financial accounting can be defined as the process of collecting, recording, presenting, and analysing/interpreting financial information for the users of financial statements.
These users include: the creditors, investors and government.
Financial accounting is mainly historical and reports the overall results of the firm‟s operations during a given period and its financial conditions.
8 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Self-Assessed Exercise What do you mean by Financial Accounting?
3.2 Purpose of Financial Accounting The purpose of financial accounting is to report, in aggregate financial terms and during a given period, the overall results of the organisation‟s operations.
More importantly, the financial strengths and weakness feature prominently in the report since factors/parameters such as profit or loss and net worth are stressed.
The reports are made available to the army of external users to make the necessary appraisals.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the purpose of Financial Accounting.
3.3 Focus of Financial Accounting Financial Accounting focuses on users external to the firm such as the investors (both existing and potential), government, lenders, tax authorities, credit suppliers.
For example, government uses the reports to obtain data required for compiling aggregate statistics of economic activity, economic growth, capital formation, etc.
On the other hand, the banks (lenders) would need the information to appraise the credit worthiness of the borrowing firm as well as keep track of its financial soundness all through the period of indebtedness.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the focus of Financial Accounting relative to the users of accounting information.
3.4 Financial Accounting and Management Accounting Compared The comparison will be considered from the perspective of the following areas: - Focus While financial accounting focuses on the users external to the organisation, management accounting attends to the internal organisation requirement for planning and control.
9 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING - Scope of Report Financial accounting reports on the overall results of the firm‟s operation within a given period whereas management accounting generates detailed financial and/or quantitative information relative to the different aspects of the organisations performance during a given period highlighting areas of concern to management for decision-making.
- Considered Factors Financial accounting is interested in showing profit or loss whereas management accounting considers batch/unit or process cost.
- Description of Report While financial accounting reports historically, management accounting produces more current and forward-looking information needed for decision making.
Self-Assessed Exercise Compare Financial Accounting and Management Accounting.
4.0 CONCLUSION Financial Accounting addresses the needs of external users of financial information.
Comparatively, Management accounting pays attention to the internal organisation‟s requirement for accounting information necessary for planning and control purposes.
5.0 SUMMARY We have been able to define financial accounting, and discussed its purpose and focus.
A comparative analysis of financial accounting and management accounting was made using such bases as focus, scope of report, considered factors and description of report.

11 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 3 BASIC BOOK KEEPING CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Basic Book-keeping 3.1 Meaning of Book-Keeping 3.2 Objectives of Book-Keeping 3.3 Books of Account 3.4 Accounting Information Generating Process 3.5 The Double Entry System 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION This unit is packaged to deal with preliminary matters relating to recording procedures in Accounting – Basic Book-keeping and the Double Entry System.
Here, we shall discuss the meaning and objectives of book-keeping.
What are books of account?
And how do we explain the Accounting Information Generating Process?
These questions would receive answers in this unit.
In addition, we would explain and apply the principles of the double entry system in recording business transactions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Define book-keeping; - Discuss the objectives of book-keeping; - Discuss the books of account; - Explain the Accounting Information Generating process; - Describe and apply the principles of double entry system of book-keeping.
3.0 BASIC BOOK-KEEPING 3.1 Definition of Book-Keeping Book-keeping which resulted from a practical business need, can be said to be a subset of Accounting or a record-making place of the accounting process.
It can be defined as “the act of recording all money 12 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING transactions so that the financial position of an undertaking and its relationship to both its proprietors and to outside persons can be readily ascertained”.
It is important to note that book-keeping lays emphasis on regular and systematic method of recording, how the records are maintained in the books, the right classification and summarisation so that the users of accounts can find the information contained in the books meaningful.
The transactions for which record are maintained and the nature and scope of the records themselves differ from business to business.
Self-Assessed Exercise What is book-keeping?
3.2 Objectives of Book-Keeping From the meaning of book-keeping given in 3.1 above, the objectives of book-keeping include the following: - To provide information about the conduct and position of the business; - To provide a permanent and systematic record of financial transactions; - To provide record for the value of various items of transactions; - To ensure the arithmetical accuracy of financial records; - To ascertain the financial worth of an undertaking at any given time; - To provide records of profit or loss at any given time; - To assist in the detection of fraud and other irregularities; - To provide financial records for comparative purposes; - To provide aid to planning and control; - To provide a basis for taxation.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the objectives of Book-keeping.
3.3 Books of Account The Books of account consist of the subsidiary books and the ledger.
Recording of transactions start from the subsidiary books to the ledger.
13 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  Subsidiary Books The subsidiary books, the Day books, books of original entry, and the books of prime entry all mean one and the same thing.
These books exist to provide periodic totals for posting into the ledger.
Please, note that transactions are not normally posted from the source documents (invoices, receipts, etc.)
directly to the ledger.
Subsidiary books are books into which transactions are recorded on a daily basis from the source documents and from which postings are made periodically to the relevant accounts in the ledger.
This practice prevents the ledger from containing too many details.
The subsidiary books normally used in financial accounting are: o Sales Day book (or sales journal) for recording credit sales.
o Purchase Day book (or purchases journal) for recording credit purchases.
o Returns Inward Day book (or returns inward journal or sales returns day book) for recording returns from customers.
o Returns Outward Day book (or returns outward journal or purchases returns day book) for recording returns to suppliers.
o Cash book for recording receipt and payment of money.
o Journal proper for recording other transactions like: - the purchase and sale of fixed assets on credit; - opening entries; - correction of errors; - transfer from one account to another; - taking of goods by the owner from the business for his private use; - end-of-period adjustments; and - any other transaction which cannot be recorded in any of the other subsidiary books.
Illustration: Purchase of fixed asset on credit Ndale Systems Limited purchased a motor vehicle on credit at a cost of N1.8 million from Coscharis Motors on 31st October, 2005.
14 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The journal to record this transaction will appear as follows: DR CR N N Motor Vehicle Account 1,800,000 Coscharis Account 1,800,000 Being cost of motor vehicle purchased on credit from Coscharis Motors on 31st October, 2005.
 Ledger The ledger is the main or principal book of account where accounts are maintained for income, assets, expenses as well as individuals (or organisations) who may be debtors or creditors to the firm.
Entries made or posted into the ledger (usually in summarised form) are expected to be preserved over a reasonable period.
As we said earlier, the ledger is written-up periodically, and is the ultimate destination of all entries made in the subsidiary books.
Below is an example of a Ledger Account: Dr. Motor Vehicle Account Cr..
Date Particulars Folio Amount Date Particular Folio Amount Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the Books of Account with emphasis on the relationship/correlation between the books of original entry and the ledger.
3.4 Accounting Information Generating Process This process involves a sequence of activities from gathering, sorting and extracting data, from the source documents, to the preparation of 15 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING financial reports.
This process is clerical, fairly routine and at times mechanistic.
The figure below says it all about the nature and sequence of the activities involved: SOURCE DOCUMENTS (Invoices, Receipts, Bank Tellers, etc.)
Recorded in S UBSIDIARY BOOKS Posted to THE LEDGER (Debtors/Creditors/General Ledger) Checked by trial balance FINANCIAL REPORTS The Information Generating Process Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the Accounting Information Generating Process.
3.5 The Double Entry System The Double Entry system of book-keeping hinges on the “Duality Concept” which we explained in Unit 1.
Recognising that every transaction involves the “receiving” and the “giving” of values, the double entry system (or principle) requires that the dual effect of every transaction should be recorded.
For every debit entry, there is a corresponding credit entry and vice versa.
Let us note here that credit is given to the giver of the value always while the receiver is debited.
Therefore, every transaction has to be recorded twice between accounts in the same set of books to ensure that a complete record is obtained.
This principle has its origin from the Italian merchants of the 14th century.
Let us illustrate with the following example: 16 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Olabisi & Company Limited sells a generator to Mrs. A.J.
Thompson for N2,000.00 only.
This is a sales transaction where there is a purchaser and a seller.
The company is parting with a generator and receiving cash in return; Mrs. Thompson is giving away cash and getting a generator in return.
With the double entry rule in mind – “debit the receiver, credit the giver”, we shall record the sales transaction as follows: In Thompson’s Books: Dr.
Purchases Account Cr.
Olabisi & Co 12,000.00 (Cash) Dr. Cash Account Cr.
Olabisi & Co 12,000.00 (Purchases) In Olabisi’s Books: Dr. Cash Account Cr.
Thompson 12,000.00 (Purchases) Dr.
Purchases Account Cr.
Thompson 12,000.00 (Cash) In double entry system of recording, it is necessary to analyse the effect of each transaction in respect of “who gives and who receives” to determine who to debit and who to credit.
As a guide in posting ledger account, entries on the DEBIT side increases in assets, expenses and 17 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING losses while entries on the CREDIT side increases in liabilities, income and profits.
Self-Assessed Exercise Describe the double entry system of book-keeping.
4.0 CONCLUSION Book-keeping can be seen as a record-making phase of the accounting process, the activity of which, amongst others, provide meaningful information about the conduct and position of the business to users of accounts.
The information generating process of accounts involves a sequence of activities from gathering, sorting and extracting data from the source documents to the preparation of financial reports.
Necessary entries, made in both the books of original entry and the ledgers, should obey the double entry principle of book-keeping which identifies the “giver” and “receiver” in every transaction and “debits” or “credits” accordingly.
The double entry system has the added advantage of maintaining a complete record of transactions both from the viewpoint of the business and those the business deals with.
5.0 SUMMARY We have seen book-keeping as laying emphasis on the regular and systematic method of recording that provide information to users of accounts.
We also considered the objectives of book-keeping in details.
In addition, we were able to explain the accounting information generating process as well as answer that the books of account consist of the subsidiary books and the ledger.
Finally, the principle of double entry has told us that for every debit, there must be a corresponding credit entry, and this forms the basis of recording economic transactions to show the effect which is either an increase or a decrease in the particular account concerned.

19 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 4 THE CASH BOOK, PETTY CASH BOOK AND THE IMPREST SYSTEM CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 The Cash Book, Petty Cash Book and the Imprest System 3.1 Nature and Uses of the Cash Book 3.2 Treatment of items in the Cash Book 3.3 Columnar Cash Books 3.4 The Petty Cash Book and Voucher 3.5 The Imprest System 3.6 Posting the Petty Cash Book 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In Unit 3, we listed the cash book as one of the books of prime entry.
It is also a ledger.
The existence of the cash book in any organisation, be it profit-making or non-profit making, needs not be overstressed because of dealings with money (cash-in-hand or cash-at-bank).
And the recording procedures for cash using the cash book become very essential.
This unit will deal with the nature and uses of the cash book as well as the treatment of items in the cash book.
Columnar cash books will be explained and demonstrated also.
Furthermore, the petty cash book and the imprest system will not be left out.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Discuss the nature and uses of the cash book; - Distinguish between the treatments given to various items in the cash book; - Demonstrate the columnar cash books; - Define a petty cash book and the imprest system; - Effect posting in the petty cash book using the petty cash vouchers.
20 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 THE CASH BOOK, PETTY CASH BOOK AND THE IMPREST SYSTEM 3.1 Nature and Uses of the Cash Book One of the main books of account is the cash book.
Kindly recall that we had said earlier that the cash book is both a subsidiary book and a ledger.
It is a book of prime entry where cash receipts and payments are recorded immediately after transactions have taken place and on daily basis, and a ledger where the daily recorded transactions are summarised periodically and transferred to the final accounts.
From the foregoing, please note that the cash book is not posted into the ledger but balanced and the relevant figures carried to the balance sheet.
Usually, the cashier maintains the cash book.
The operation of a cash book is very important in accounting because it provides a means of controlling the amount held at all times.
The dual use of the cash book in an organisation becomes clear when we consider or take cognisance of the fact that cash constitutes the most fluid form of asset of the organisation which is easily prone to losses or abuses.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the dual use of the cash book.
3.2 Treatment of items in the Cash Book  Contra Entry: Contra entry is when the double entry for a transaction appears on both sides of the cash book.
Therefore, contra entries do not require recording in another account because entry has taken place within the cash book.
These entries are made when surplus cash is transferred to the bank or the withdrawal of cash from the bank for use.
The entries here will be to credit cash and debit bank or debit cash and credit bank in the columnar cash book which we shall consider in 3.3.
 Cash Cash receipts are debited in the cash column while payments are credited in the cash column.
 Cheques Cheques received from customers are debited in the bank column while cheques issued to suppliers are credited.
21 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  Cash Discounts Cash discounts are rebates granted to a buyer or debtor for making cash payments within a shorter time period than the normal credit period.
This implies that the seller accepts an amount smaller than the invoice value in full settlement of the account.
If it is a two – column cash book (to be considered shortly), they are posted directly to the ledger but if it is 3 three – column cash book, they will be recorded in the cash book.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the treatment of any two items in the cash book.
3.3 Columnar Cash Books  Single – Column Cash Book Dr. Cash Account Cr.
Date Particulars Folio Amount Date Particular Folio Amount (N) (N) The above is a format for the single – column cash book, which is like a ledger account with one column each for debit and credit; thus, making provision for cash transaction only.
This is used to record the receipts and payments of cash, typical of small businesses whose transactions do not involve cheques/bank.
 Two – Column Cash Book This is the commonest form of cash book.
As the name implies, the two – column cash book makes provision for two columns, one each for cash and bank transactions.
The format is shown as follows: 22 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Dr. Cash Account Cr.
Date Particulars Folio Cash Bank Date Particular Folio Cash Bank Here, all cash and cheque receipts are debited in the appropriate column while payments by cash and cheque are credited accordingly.
The cash book is usually balanced at the end of the month.
Example: Bello Trading Company brought forward balances of N2,000.00 and N13,200.00 for cash and bank respectively, from June, 2004 account.

Discounts allowed to debtors are listed as debits while those received from credits are credited.
The discount columns save time although they are not part of the double entry system because they are not expected to balance each and also in posting out.
Total debits, at the end of the period, are debited to the Discount Allowed account while the total credits are transferred to the Discount Received account.
The corresponding entries are usually made in the various personal ledger accounts of debtors and creditors.
We shall illustrate the three-column cash book now.
Example: Mike started a small business with N80,000.00 on January 2, 2005 which he paid into a bank account for the business on the same date.
His transactions for the rest of the month were as follows: 5/1/05 Purchases by cheque N27,300.00 6/1/05 Credit purchases N25,200.00 Electricity paid by cheque N500.00; Rent N700.00 by cheque 7/1/05 Drew cash for office use N1,200.00 Sales by cheque N42,520.00 Sales by cash N480.00 Sales on credit N50,000.00 8/1/05 Paid creditors by cheque N15,100.00 and received discount of N300.00 9/1/05 Cash sales N17,115.00; cash wages paid N500.00 10/1/05 Paid into bank the sales made on 9/1/05; Stationery bought by cash N50.00 12/1/05 Received from customers cheques for N39,200.00 and allowed discount of N800.00 15/1/05 Drew cash from bank for office use N200.00 16/1/05 Servicing and repairs by cash N120.00 Purchases by cash N20,000.00 Purchases by cheque N5,000.00 Purchases on credit N45,000.00 20/1/05 Sales by cash N37,500.00 Sales by cheques N17,000.00 22/1/05 Paid creditors N27,900.00 by cheque and received discount of N100.00 25 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Cash sales N2,000.00 which was immediately lodged into the bank.

3.4 The Petty Cash Book and Voucher It is certain that in almost every organisation, there will be a great deal of small cash payments to be made.
Records of these payments could be kept separate from the main cash book.
The petty cash book is a record, in columnar format, of small cash payments made on a day-to-day basis.
The columnar ruling of the petty cash books is designed to enable small payments to be analysed according to expenditure head and posted in totals to the ledger periodically.
This book is maintained by the petty cashier under the supervision of the main cashier.
The petty cash voucher shows the amount of money required the purpose and nature of expenditure involved, and the account to be charged.
The petty cash voucher is required before making any payment.
It must be duly authorised before payment is made out of the petty cash float.
The format of the voucher varies from organisation to organisation.
However, it is the instrument from which posting is done to the petty cash book.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the petty cash book and the petty cash voucher.
3.5 The Imprest System This is basically a system of funding petty cash which reimburses the petty cashier with the total amount expended.
By this, the total amount which the petty cashier has is restored to the float (fixed amount) with which he started.
Therefore, total payments added to the imprest balance will, at all times, remain equal to the float.
Self-Assessed Exercise What is the Imprest System?
3.6 Posting the Petty Cash Book We shall use the following exercise to illustrate posting into the petty cash book: The following is a summary of petty cash transactions of a business organisation for the month of June, 2004.
The business maintains a petty cash float of N5,000.00.
28 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING N June 1 Petty cash float given to petty cashier June 3 Postages 200 June 5 Transport fare 450 June 8 Cleaning materials 350 June 9 Stationery 170 June 14 Petrol for delivery van 880 June 16 Taxi fare 390 June 20 Postages 180 June 21 Disinfectant for cleaning toilet 280 June 23 Petrol for general manager‟s car 660 June 24 Service of delivery van 400 June 28 Writing materials 310 June 30 Transport fare 120 You are required to rule up a petty cash book with columns for Postages, Transport, Travelling, Cleaning, Stationery and Motor Expenses and enter the month‟s transactions, entering the re-imbursement on 30th June, 2004 necessary to restore the imprest.

For example, N380.00 will be debited to postages account, N960.00 debited to transport and travelling account and so on.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain how posting is made in the petty cash book.
4.0 CONCLUSION The cash book is both a book of original entry and a ledger.
Entries into the cash book must obey the double entry principle.
The cash book provides a means of controlling cash.
To take care of sundry small day- to-day cash payments in an organisation, the petty cash book becomes relevant.
It plays the role of a subsidiary book.
The funding of petty cash is through the imprest system.
5.0 SUMMARY We have discussed the nature and uses of the cash book as well as distinguished between the treatments given to various items in the cash book.
Also, we explained and demonstrated the use of the columnar cash books.
Furthermore, we considered the usefulness of the petty cash book and voucher, as well as the imprest system.
Amongst other advantages, the imprest system enables control to be kept over the series of frequent small expenditure of the organisation because all petty cash disbursements must be duly authorised/approved.

Therefore, the generated accounting information are presented to various interested parties for their respective decisions.
How are the accounting information presented?
This will be the focus of Unit 5.
We shall find out that accounting information are presented through the medium of periodic financial statements or financial reports, done in consonance with specified accounting and legal standards relating to the style and content of presentation.
We shall look at the objectives and structure of financial reports, and discuss the Trading and Profit and Loss Account, and the Balance Sheet, under the structure.
Also, capital and revenue components of the structure will be explained.
Finally, we shall consider the treatment of account receivable and payable items of the reports.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Discuss the objectives and structure of financial reports; - Discuss the components, and demonstrate the formats of the Trading and Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet 33 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING - Distinguish between the capital and revenue items of the financial statements; and - Discuss the difference between Accounts receivable and accounts payable.
3.0 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.1 Objectives and Structure of Financial Reports The periodic financial reports comprise two major statements – the Trading and Profit and Loss Account, and the Balance Sheet.
While the Trading and Profit and Loss account measures the net income or surplus arising from the operations during the period under review, in order to know how actual profits compared with the expected, the balance sheet discloses the financial position of the enterprise (relating to the assets, liabilities and capital) as at a particular date, usually the last day of the accounting period.
The Trading and Profit and Loss account provides the yardstick for measuring the extent to which an enterprise has succeeded in attaining its profit making objective.
It also shows the relationship between costs and revenues which serve as basis for decision aimed at improving future performance.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the objectives and structure of financial reports.
3.2 Trading and Profit and Loss Account The Trading and Profit and Loss account matches a period‟s revenues with the costs associated with generating those revenues.
Two components of the trading and profit and loss account are: - Trading account which discloses gross profit; - Profit and Loss account which discloses the net profit.
However, for a manufacturer, it is also useful to prepare “Manufacturing Account” which we shall consider later.
Gross profit is the difference between sales proceeds and the cost of goods sold in a trading account while net profit is the gross profit less the expenses of the business in the profit and loss account.
The trading and profit and loss account of a sole trader (concerned with buying and selling) using the vertical format would appear as follows: 34 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Trading and Profit and Loss account for the period ended 30/6/xx N N Sales X Opening Stock X Add: Purchases X Available Stock X Less: Closing Stock X Cost of Sales X Gross Profit X Less: Wages X Rent X Sundry expenses X Total Expenses X Net Profit X 3.3 The Balance Sheet The balance sheet, which is often prepared on the historical cost basis, can be seen as a collection of the residual values of assets, liabilities and capital carried over from one accounting period into the next, to continue the running of the enterprise as a going concern.
Thus, the balance sheet lists a business‟s assets, liabilities and capital at a particular point in time.
Assets are stated at book value, which may be historical or market value, but not at realisable value (Book value is the amount of money that was paid to acquire a particular asset while the net realisable value of an asset is the money that might be possible to get by selling the asset).
Fixed Asset is any asset, tangible or intangible, acquired for retention by an entity for the purpose of providing a service to the business, and not held for resale in the normal course of trading.
35 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The balance sheet of a sole trader using the vertical format would appear as follows: Balance Sheet as at 30/6/x N N Fixed Assets: Vehicles X Current Assets: Stock X Debtors X Cash at bank X Cash in hand X X Less: Current Liabilities: Creditors X Net current assets (CA less CL) X Total Assets X Capital Account: Balance at beginning of period X Add: Net Profit for period X X Less: Drawings for period X Retained profit X Balance at end of period X Let us look at an example: The following trial balance was extracted from the books of Alaba Enterprises on 31st December, 2004: Dr. Cr.

Required: (a) Prepare a Trading and Profit and Loss account for the year 2002 (b) Extract a Balance Sheet for Bamijoko Enterprises as at 31st December 2002 3.4 Capital and Revenue Items The ability to measure capital and revenue as well as the inter- relationship between them, is very important in accounting practice because capital generates revenue and it is this ability to generate revenue that gives value to capital.
There are capital and revenue items of receipts as well as capital and revenue expenditure items.
It is very important to distinguish between these items as their treatment differ in the books of account.
It is also necessary in the determination of profit made by the enterprises and explain why certain items go to the Trading and Profit and Loss account and others go to the Balance Sheet.
Capital and Revenue Receipts Capital receipts comprise the initial capital paid by the owner(s) of the business as well as loans and proceeds of sale of any of the assets.
On the other hand, revenue receipts are the cash received from sales of goods, discounts received, commission, interest on investment and all such monies arising from rendering services or in the normal course of business transactions in the current period.
41 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Capital and Revenue Expenditure “Capital expenditure consists of expenditure, the benefit of which is not fully consumed in one period, but spread over several periods”.
These are fixed assets like land and buildings and new factory which are acquired for the purpose of earning income or increasing the earning capacity of the business.
Revenue expenditure are those incurred in one period of account and whose full benefit is consumed within the same period.
Examples include travelling and fuelling expenses, repairs, postages, interest on loan and salaries and wages.
Usually, it is the revenue expenditure that is charged against revenue receipts to determine the profit made by a business in a given accounting year.
Self-Assessed Exercise 1.
What do you understand by capital receipts?
Give two examples.
2.
Distinguish between capital and revenue expenditures and give three examples of each.
3.5 Treatment of Account Receivable and Payable Accounts receivable, also known as “Debtors”, is given rise to when allowance is made for payments to be effected sometime later after the sales transactions have been concluded and the goods changed ownership for the reasons that buyers need goods and services that they cannot pay for immediately, and sellers sell more through credit sales.
Credit sales are recorded in the sales journal and accounts receivables are current assets to the organisation.
Accounts payable, on the other hand, are normally current liabilities to the enterprise.
They are also known as “Creditors” which arise as a result of credit purchase transactions.
Accurate record of accounts payable is important to avoid an omission that will lead to an overstatement of profit.
Credit purchase transactions are recorded in the purchase journal.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the difference between accounts receivable and accounts payable.
42 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 4.0 CONCLUSION Financial reports – basically, the Trading and Profit and Loss account and the Balance Sheet – are necessary to inform management and other interested outside parties about the performance as well as the financial position of the enterprise which form the basis for their respective decisions.
Capital and revenue items would need to be distinguished or categorised properly to enable the financial reports give a true reflection of the financial affairs.
Also, due care should be taken in deciding on, and recording matters, relating to accounts payable and accounts receivable in order to have a good relationship between current assets, current liabilities and profit.
5.0 SUMMARY We have seen and discussed how accounting information is presented to all interested parties by focusing on the Trading and Profit and Loss account as well as the Balance Sheet.
While the trading and profit and loss account ascertains the gross profit on sales and the net profit or loss for the period, the balance sheet ascertains the financial position of the business at the end of the accounting period.
Also, the capital and revenue items of the financial reports have been discussed with emphasis on their proper distinction, recognition and recording.
Lastly, we considered the treatment of account receivable and account payment items.

44 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 6: BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENTS Table of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Bank Reconciliation Statements 3.1 Bank Statements and Reconciliation 3.2 The Bank Reconciliation Statement 3.3 Method of Bank Reconciliation 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION In Unit 4, we considered the Two-Column Cash Book which provides two columns, one each for cash and bank transactions.
Therefore, this cash book brings together the cash and bank accounts maintained by an organisation.
Usually, the business transacts with the bank while the bank transacts with the business.
The cash book records al the business transactions with the bank, and for al the bank‟s transactions with the business, a bank statement records the proceedings.
However, the balance on the cash book is rarely if ever the same as the balance on the bank statement.
Therefore, in this unit, we shall examine the need to agree our bank balance obtained from the cash book to the bank statement balance issued by the bank.
Also, we shall consider the factors that are responsible for the differences in both balances, how they are treated and how reconciliation statements are prepared.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Explain why the bank balance obtained from the cash book differs from the bank statement; - Discuss the need for bank reconciliation statements; - Prepare the bank reconciliation statements to agree with the two balances.
45 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 BANK RECONCILIATIONSTATEMENTS 3.1 Bank Statements and Bank Reconciliation Banks send monthly or periodical statements to their customers – individuals, associations, corporate entities, etc.
A bank statement shows details of bank‟s transactions (deposits, withdrawals and charges) with their customers during a given period.
At the end of the period to which the statement relates, it would indicate the balance in the account taking note of the credits (deposits) and debits (withdrawals and charges).
Earlier in the introduction, we noted that it is difficult for the cash book balance to agree with the balance on the bank statement, why?
One reason can be attributed to timing differences.
For example, a cheque payment may be recorded in the cash book when it is issued.
The bank only records such a cheque when it is paid by the bank, which may be several days or even weeks later (unpresented cheque).
Other examples are outstanding deposits and uncredited lodgements.
Secondly, some items may appear in the bank statement but yet to be entered in the cash book, and these include bank charges, bank interest paid (on overdrafts) or received (on deposits), standing orders and direct debts, credit transfers (where a receipt has been paid direct into the organisation‟s bank account), cheques returned unpaid, and unauthorised debits due to genuine mistakes or fraud.
Therefore, bank reconciliation is the process of investigating the difference in both balances and attempt to agree them.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain why the cash book is rarely if ever the same as the balance on the bank statement.
3.2 The Bank Reconciliation Statement This is a statement prepared to agree the balances of both the bank statement and the cash book.
Apart from this function, the bank reconciliation statement helps to ensure that:  All deposits and withdrawals have been entered correctly.
 No unauthorised debits have been made in the account.
 Frauds and errors are detected early and corrected.
46 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The reconciliation process is to verify the entries by ticking the credit side of the bank statement to the debit side of the cash book and vice versa.
Any unticked entries in either the statement or the cash book represents items given as examples in explaining the reasons why balances in the statement and the cash book don‟t agree.
The items could be treated as follows:  Unpresented Cheques have been deducted in the cash book already but not in the bank statement.
Either we add it back to cash book balance or deduct from bank statement balance.
 Direct debits are either added to cash book balance or deducted from bank statement balance.
 Uncredited lodgements are either added to the statement balance or deducted from cash book balance.
 Frauds and errors should be investigated and corrected.
Self-Assessed Exercise 1.
Define the bank reconciliation statement.
2.
Discuss the bank reconciliation process.
3.3 Methods of Bank Reconciliation There are two methods of bank reconciliation:  Update the cash book by recording items in the bank statement not in it, and then, reconcile the adjusted cash book balance to the statement balance.
 Do straight reconciliation.
We shall demonstrate both methods in the following illustration: On 31 July, 2004, Adekunle Ajani received a bank statement which showed a balance of N198,000 whereas the bank column of the cash book showed a balance of N140,000.
After comparing the entries in both, the following items were revealed as accounting for the difference: 29 July 2004 Dividend received from ABC Ltd. credited by bank not yet recorded in the cash book amounts to N16,000.
30 July 2004 Payment of N10,000 by standing order not yet recorded in the cash book.
30 July 2004 Transfer charges (N300) and bank commission (N700) not yet recorded in the cash book.
47 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 31 July 2004 Interest of N24,000 credited by bank not yet entered into the cash book.

A process of bank reconciliation which involves investigating the differences in both balances is employed to agree the balances.
This leads to the generation of a bank reconciliation statement.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have examined the need to agree our cash book balance to the bank statement balance.
We considered, also, reasons for the differences in both balances, and how they could be reconciled.
Two methods were employed to illustrate/demonstrate how bank reconciliation statements are drawn.

Kindly refer to unit 5 and recall that the formats for the presentation of the Trading and Profit and Loss account, and the Balance Sheet, were those for a sole trader (sole proprietorship).
Like other profit-oriented organisations, it is very necessary to keep and maintain accounts for sole proprietorships which enable the operators to ascertain the profits earned or losses incurred.
Various reasons could be adduced as to why the operators would want to have an idea of profits earned such as: (i) To ascertain or assess the capacity to obtain loans from banks or private individuals; (ii) To assist them to make future plans; (iii) To know how attractive their ventures are to prospective investors or would-be buyers; (iv) To know the profit for income tax purposes; (v) To know whether the concerns are doing well or not.
This unit will give attention to the characteristics, equity and drawings of/in sole proprietorships as well as their nature of tax.
51 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Discuss the characteristics of one-man business; - Explain the equity composition of sole proprietorship; - Explain “drawings” in relation to sole proprietorship; - Discuss the nature of tax in one-man business.
3.0 ACCOUNTS OF SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS 3.1 Characteristics of One – man business One – man business (or sole proprietorship business), as the name implies, is a business concern owned by one person who often is also engaged actively in the running of the business.
The sole owner subscribes to all of the equity capital of the business which in most cases are raised from personal savings or soft loans obtained from relations and friends.
All incomes also accrue to the owner.
Other characteristics of one – man business include the following: (i) A sole proprietorship has no distinct legal entity.
Even when it is registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, the owner and the business cannot be separated; (ii) The owner has freedom to deal with the organisation‟s assets without any restrictions imposed by law; (iii) Because of the limited amount of assets which a sole proprietorship business controls, it is often small and can be recognised easily; (iv) Its capacity to borrow (especially from banks) is limited by the asset base; (v) It has very high risk because of the inseparability of the owner with the business; (vi) The business outfit often goes by the name of the owner, and operates within a confined location, usually, not more than two branches; (vii) The structure is fairly simplistic in nature.
From the foregoing, it would appear that the compact nature of the sole proprietorship business should not present much difficulty in its accounting.
However and often times, smallness may impede the ability of the business to engage capable/competent hands to carry out the accounting function and ensure good financial control.
Consequently, the accounting records kept may be incomplete and lack the essential 52 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ingredients.
These may impinge on the preparation of acceptable financial statements.
Self Assessed Exercise Discuss the characteristics of a sole proprietorship business.
3.2 Equity of a sole proprietorship As mentioned above, the sole owner subscribes to all of the equity of the business.
The equity is made up of capital contributions in cash or kind at commencement or at a later date by self through personal savings, relations and friends, and all profits earned in the business since its inception but which have not been withdrawn.
This can be shown in the annual balance sheet as follows: N Capital b/f XX Add: Amount introduced during the year X Profit earned during the year X XX Less: Drawings during the year X Capital c/f XX It is very clear, therefore, that the capital of a sole proprietor is not fixed but varies from year to year depending on the: (i) Amount of capital introduced; (ii) Amount of profit earned; (iii) Extent of drawings; (iv) Degree of disinvestment (where fixed asset of reasonable value is taken out of the business for personal use).
Let us quickly say that there is no legal restrictions on drawings; prudence is the watchword.
Also, the proprietor is free to increase the capital position at anytime.
However, this flexible position of the sole proprietor in his unrestricted rights in dealings that affect the equity of the firm and the absence of legal ties could be disadvantageous in terms of the ability of the business to enter into certain types of transactions – especially, borrowing-where it would appear that the rights of the other party may suffer.
With this situation, the sole proprietor would be constrained in his ability to obtain capital or to grow.
Self Assessed Exercise The capital of a sole proprietor is not fixed but varies from year to year.
Explain this statement.
53 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.3 Drawings The sole proprietor‟s drawings during the year affect the equity.
Drawings speak to the periodic withdrawals made by a sole proprietor (who is actively engaged in the management of the business) in anticipation of profits.
As we stated earlier, drawings are not regulated and tend to fluctuate from month to month depending on the personal commitments of the proprietor.
Drawings can also be taken in kind when the owner takes out some of the goods which the business trades in.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the features of drawings.
3.4 Nature of Tax A business which has a legal entity normally pays tax on its income just as any natural person does.
In the case of sole proprietorship, however, since it is not a legal entity, it is not bound to pay tax.
Recall that here is a situation where the business cannot be separated from the owner, and that being the case, the income of the business is considered to be that of the owner for tax purposes.
The sole proprietor is required to declare such income, amongst others, in the annual tax returns for personal income tax assessment and payment.
Self-Assessed Exercise What are the tax implications for a sole proprietor?
4.0 CONCLUSION The sole proprietorship business has no legal entity; both the business and the owner are inseparable.
The owner subscribes to all of the equity of the business and the capital varies from year to year.
The proprietor makes periodic withdrawals known as “drawings” in anticipation of profits to attend to his personal commitments.
The business is not liable to tax because of its legal status.
Instead, the owner is taxed as a person based on the income of the business.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have looked at some guides necessary to keep the accounts of sole proprietorships.
Apart from discussing the characteristics of one – man business, we considered the equity composition.
Furthermore, we explained drawings in relation to sole 54 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING proprietorship, and discussed the nature of tax.
The proprietor and not the business is liable to tax.

Therefore, for a partnership to exist:  the association must be engaged in a business which may be a trade or a profession;  the trade or the profession must be carried on together, jointly, for the benefit of all the partners; and  there must be an intention to earn a profit.
The above description, therefore, distinguishes a partnership from a political, religious, social, or philanthropic club or association.
A partnership agreement, which need not necessarily be in written form (although it is advisable or wiser that any agreements between the partners be reduced to writing as this will tend to lead to fewer possibilities of misunderstandings and disagreements between partners), will govern the relationships between the partners, including:  name of organisation, the type of business, and duration;  capital to be introduced by partners;  division of profits between parties, including salaries since not all the partners may be employed by the partnership on a full- time basis.
Such salaries will be normal operating expenses;  drawings by partners; 57 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  arrangements for dissolution, or on the death or retirement of partners;  settling of disputes;  preparation and audit of accounts.
At this juncture, it is necessary to note that, although the partnership agreement creates a legal relationship between the partners, the partnership itself is not a legal entity.
With the above backgrounder, the unit (being the first part of the three to consider Accounts of Partnerships) will attempt to distinguish companies from partnerships.
The unit will also consider accounting treatments relative to admission of a new partner, profit ratio after admission of a new partner as well as goodwill in partnerships.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Distinguish between companies and partnerships; - Explain the accounting treatments relative to admission of a new partner; - Work out the profit ratio after admission of a new partner; - Discuss goodwill in partnerships.

3.2 Admission of a new Partner Before we look at the different dimensions of admitting a new member relative to the accounting procedure, let us start from the very beginning when establishing the partnership.
Each partner contributes an amount of capital.
A fundamental principle for the accounting treatment is that all aspects of an individual partner‟s contributions, charges to and charges by the partnership must be accounted for separately.
Recall that 59 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING in the books of the sole proprietor, two accounts are opened for the owner:  Capital account;  Drawings account.
However, in the books of the partnership, three accounts will be opened for each of the partners, namely:  a capital account;  a drawings account;  a current account.
Partners‟ capital accounts are referred to as “fixed capital accounts” because they are not used to record drawings or shares of profits but rather:  capital introduced or withdrawn by new or retiring partners;  revaluation adjustments.
Current accounts are used to deal with the regular transactions between the partners and the firm.
Most commonly, these transactions are share of profits, interest on capital and partners‟ salaries.
Drawings are made against the partners‟ share of anticipated profits.
Drawings account is debited and cash credited to record drawings.
At year end, drawings account is closed off to the individual partner‟s current account and crediting drawings account.
Let us note that drawings do not mean appropriation of profit.
Now let us look at the accounting procedures involved in the different dimensions of introducing or admitting a new partner.
(i) A new partner is admitted into the business when the capital base of the partnership is not affected: An existing interest in a partnership (that is, each partners‟ share of the total capital and of the profits) can be acquired by a new partner through direct purchase from the existing partners.
This means that the assets and liabilities (capital base) of the partnership remain unchanged even though a new partner is admitted.
An Example: Peter, James and John, being partners agree to sell N60,000 interests to Andrew on equal basis (N20,000 each).
The capital accounts of the partners prior to the purchase reflected the 60 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING following balances: Peter – N50,000; James – N100,000 and John – N150,000.
The journal entries for the above will be: N N Dr. Cr.
Peter 20,000 James 20,000 John 20,000 Andrew 60,000 (Being the transfer of partnership capital to a new partner) By the above journal, the capital account of the three old partners is reduced by N20,000 each and a new capital account is set up for Andrew (the new partner).
Note that the admission of Andrew does not bring new cash into the partnership; the cash paid by Andrew to acquire the interests goes to the individual old partners.
Total partnership capital and assets remain the same; what has changed is the structure of the partnership capital – Peter: N30,000; James – N80,000; John – N130,000; Andrew – N60,000.
(ii) A new partner can be admitted through an additional investment in the partnership: This dimension increases total partnership capital and assets.
The underlisted steps should be followed to determine the appropriate entries in the partnership accounts when a new partner invests in the partnership: o Determine the total amount of the agreed capital after the new investment.
o Ascertain the new partners‟ share of the capital to arrive at the proper credit to the new partner‟s capital account.
o Adjust the capital accounts of the partners if the asset values are changed or if bonuses are given to old or new partners.
o Adjust the book values of the partnership assets, especially, if the total capital of existing partners plus the capital invested by the new partner does not equal the agreed capital arrived at in bullet 1 above.
(The acquisition of a new partnership interest by investment can be effected at book value.
Alternatively, the interest can be purchased at more or less than the book value).
61 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING An Example: Osagie and Haruna are partners with N55,000 and N35,000 balances in the capital accounts respectively (after adjustment of assets to market value).
Profits and losses are divided 60% to Osagie and 40% to Haruna.
A new partner, Jumbo acquires ¼ interest in profits and in the capital by investing additional assets.
The profit ratios specified in the new partnership agreement are 45%, 30% and 25% for Osagie, Haruna and Jumbo respectively.
Effect the appropriate entries.
With investment at book value, Jumbo pays in N30,000 for ¼ interest.
The new total capital and assets is N120,000.
Jumbo‟s share in the book value is N30,000 and this is equal to the cash brought in.
No further adjustments are required since the total assets are equal to the new agreed capital.
The journal entries will be: N N Dr. Cr.
Cash 30,000 Jumbo 30,000 (Being Jumbo‟s admission to a 25% interest in a total capital of N120,000) (iii) A new partner is admitted with a bonus credited to the old partners: The partners (Osagie and Haruna) agreed that the total capital and total assets are to be N125,000, and the new partner, Jumbo, pays in N35,000 an amount, greater than the recorded value of his capital (N31,250).
Jumbo is paying a bonus of N3,750 to the partnership (in expectation of superior profit performance), which is divided between Osagie and Haruna in the profit sharing ratio that existed between them.
The relevant entries are: N N Dr. Cr.
Cash 35,000 Osagie: Capital 2,250 Haruna: Capital 1,500 Jumbo: Capital 31,250 62 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (Being Jumbo‟s admission by investment in a total capital of N125,000) (iv) A new partner is admitted with Goodwill credited to the old partners: As in (iii) above, Jumbo pays in N35,000 for ¼ interest, which payment exceeds the book value of his proportionate share of tangible assets.
The partners agreed that Goodwill is to be recorded, with its value determined from Jumbo‟s contribution.
Let us make the following deductions: o Jumbo contributed N35,000 for ¼ interest in total capital.
Therefore total capital after his contribution is N140,000 (N35,000 x 4).
o The assets of the old partnership were valued at N90,000.
So the total tangible assets are now: N Assets 90,000 Cash (New investment) 35,000 125,000 o The difference between the total capital and the total tangible assets of the partnership is the value of goodwill, that is, N15,000 (140,000 – N125,000) which belongs to the old partnership and is to be shared between Osagie and Haruna in the profit ratio.
(Goodwill will be treated in details in 3.4).
The following entries are relevant: Dr. Cr.
N N Goodwill 15,000 Osagie: Capital 9,000 Haruna: Capital 6,000 (Being Goodwill determined by Jumbo‟s admission) Jumbo‟s investment will be recorded in the journal as follows: Dr. Cr.

Self-Assessed Exercise 1.
Explain the different scenarios of admitting a new partner.
2.
What are the steps to be taken in determining the appropriate entries in the partnership accounts when a new partner invests in the partnership?
3.3 Profit Ratio after admission of a new Partner Here, we shall consider the method for calculating the profit and loss sharing ratio for partners after the admission of a new partner since the old sharing ratio would have been overtaken by events.
The old partners, in some cases, may wish to retain their former relative positions.
Sometimes too, they may prefer changes.
However, whatever is the case, the new profit ratio has to be determined/established and included in the revised agreement.
An Example: Jerome and Shedrack, being partners in business, share profits and losses in the ratio of 60% and 40% respectively.
The partners agreed to admit Lambert to a 25% interest.
You are required to determine the new profit sharing ratio for the partners.
The calculation will be as follows: Total net profits 100% Less: Lambert‟s share 25% Balance for Jerome and Shedrack 75% Ratio for Jerome (60% of 75%) 45% Ratio for Shedrack (40% of 75%) 30% Therefore, the new profits ratio is 45%, 30% and 25% for Jerome, Shedrack and Lambert.
64 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Self-Assessed Exercise If Kay and Ker‟s profits ratio in the partnership business before admitting Kan to a 15% interest was 70% and 30% respectively, what will be the partners‟ new sharing ratio after Kan was admitted?
3.4 Goodwill in Partnerships We shall consider the meaning, valuation and treatment of goodwill relative to the partnerships.
Goodwill refers to the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business which can be valued and expressed in monetary terms.
It is a force that attracts customers; it makes a new partner to contribute capital over and above the saleable values of the tangible assets.
The goodwill possessed by a firm may be due to, among others, the:  Monopoly enjoyed by the business;  Reputation of the company in terms of quality of goods and services;  Management skill and reputation of the partners, and the value of the labour force;  Location of the business premises;  Possession of the trade marks, patents, or well-known businesses name over the years.
In the valuation of goodwill, custom plays a great role in many sorts of business.
Let us discuss a few of the methods: (i) The average profits of a given number of past years multiplied by an agreed number: Thus, it is common to learn of three years‟ purchase of the net profits as the basis for valuing goodwill.
For example, if the average net profit made by XYZ Company for the past five (5) years is N2,000 per annum, on the basis of three years‟ purchase of the net profits, goodwill will be valued at N6,000 (N2,000 x 3).
Please, note that this method is purely arbitrary.
(ii) The average gross income of the business for a number of past years multiplied by an agreed number: Professional firms usually adopt this method.
65 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (iii) The value of the business: The value of the business is estimated by reference to the expected earnings and the yield required, and from the figure arrived at, the value of the net tangible assets is deducted, the difference being taken to represent the value of goodwill.
For example, the estimated future accrued profits of the partnership (less partners‟ remuneration of N2,500) is N7,500.
If yield at 10% per annum is expected and the value of the tangible assets is N50,000, what is the value of the goodwill?
 Capital value of business (7,500 x 10) N75,000 Less: Value of tangible assets N50,000 Value of goodwill N25,000 Kindly refer to 3.2 for the treatment of goodwill in partnership accounts.
Self-Assessed Exercise Define goodwill and discuss the methods of its valuation.
4.0 CONCLUSION Although the partnership agreement or deed creates a legal relationship between the partners, the partnership itself is not a juristic person.
Each partner, in the partnership books, has a capital account, drawings account and a current account.
When a new partner is admitted, the profit sharing ratio of the old partners changes; a new ratio to include the new partner has to be established and included in the revised agreement.
Goodwill is an important factor is determining a new partner‟s contribution to the partnership.
5.0 SUMMARY We have been able to define partnership, and distinguished between it and company.
In the partnership, we have discussed the admission of a new partner under different approaches as well as the accounting procedures.
We also looked at the profit ratio after admission of a new partner which has to change and form part of the revised agreement document.
Goodwill – an intangible asset, which makes a new partner contribute to the partnership over and above the saleable values of the tangible assets – was discussed as well.
66 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENTS 1.

The profit sharing ratio in the new partnership agreement if Alfa is to be admitted on the payment of N120,000, which is to be 1/6 of the total new capital, as his interest, will be 48%, 35% and 17% for Alabo, Rotimi and Alfa respectively.
You are required to show the asset of the old and new partnership and the goodwill.
Also, show the old partners‟ shares of goodwill since it was agreed that it should be shared in their profit and loss sharing ratio.

It will be important to expose you to the order of priority by which assets are distributed as well as the accounting treatment of non-cash assets as they are converted into cash before any assets are distributed to creditors and partners.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - State the order of priority in the distribution of assets during a partnership dissolution; - Treat the conversion of non-cash assets into cash for distribution to creditors and partners; - Prepare dissolution of partnership accounts when assets are realised piecemeal.
3.0 ACCOUNTS OF PARTNERSHIPS II 3.1 Retirement and Dissolution of Partnerships The decision to dissolve and terminate the activities of a partnership is known as liquidation or dissolution or winding-up of affairs.
While contemplating dissolution, there should be a clear perception of the order of distribution of partnership assets as well as a determination and 68 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING distribution of gains and losses arising during the process of realisation.
Fortunately, the Partnership Act provides for the following order of distribution of partnership assets in the event of termination and liquidation of the company, which should be respected: - Creditors of the company; - Creditors of the individual partners; - Partners‟ loan to the company; - Partners‟ capital.
At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that during the period of liquidation, some of the company‟s non-cash assets may be converted into cash by realisation (and this segment deals with the situation when all assets are realised in full), liabilities are settled to the extent possible, and each partner‟s residual interests are settled to the limit permitted by the remaining cash.
Gains and losses arising during the realisation period are given the same treatment as gains and losses from operations; thus, they are distributed to the partners‟ capital accounts in the profit and loss ratio.
Example: On 30th June, 2001, the partners of Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele Company decided to dissolve the partnership and distribute all assets to the creditors and to the partners.
After appropriate adjustments to reflect events since the close of the financial year, the following balance sheet was prepared: Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele Balance Sheet N N Fixed Asset (at cost less depreciation): Land 8,000 Buildings (cost N80,000; Depreciation N38,000) 42,000 Equipment (cost N140,000; Depreciation N50,000) 90,000 140,000 Current Assets: Cash 20,000 Debtors 18,000 Stock 30,000 Prepaid Insurance 600 68,600 208,600 Represented by: Partners‟ Capital: Oluwole 84,000 Osuji 39,200 Bamidele 68,400 191,600 69 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Current Liabilities: Creditors 6,000 Notes payable 10,000 Accrued interest 200 Tax payable 800 17,000 208,600 The partnership agreement provides for a profit and loss ratio of 50%, 20% and 30% for Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele respectively.
As part of the efforts to wind-up the partnership business, the following transactions took place in July and August: (i) The equipment was sold for N72,000; (ii) The land and buildings were sold to Zaki Ltd. For N60,000; (iii) All stocks were sold for N24,800; (iv) The insurance were surrendered for the premium of N400; (v) All creditors and taxes payable were paid; (vi) N16,600 was collected from debtors and the balance written-off; (vii) N10,400 representing the face value of the note and interest due to maturity was deposited in a special account with Chartered Bank; (viii) All remaining assets were distributed to the partners.
We are required to give accounting treatment to the recording of the dissolution.
Solution: Let us adopt a procedure where we treat each asset as a sub-realisation account, thus, the amount realised from the sale of an asset is debited to such an account and the loss or gain credited and the account is closed to the realisation account.
The cash book is debited with the proceeds.
We journalise the individual accounts as they are realised which brings out the essence of dissolution clearly.
Therefore, the journal entries for the July and August transactions will be as follows: N N (i) Cash 72,000 Accummulated depreciation (Equipment) 50,000 Realisation Accounts 18,000 Equipment 140,000 (Being the sale of Equipment at a loss) 70 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (ii) Cash 60,000 Accummulated depreciation (Building) 38,000 Building 80,000 Land 8,000 Realisation Accounts 10,000 (Being the sale of land and building at a gain) (iii) Cash 24,800 Realisation Accounts 5,200 Stock 30,000 (Being the disposal of stock at a loss) (vi) Cash 400 Realisation Accounts 200 Prepaid insurance 600 (Being the cancellation of insurance and collection of unexpired premium) (v) Creditors 6,000 Tax payable 800 Cash 6,800 (Being the liquidation of creditors and taxes payable) (vi) Cash 16,600 Realisation Accounts 1,400 Debtors 18,000 (Being the collection of debtors and the writing-off of bad debts) (vii) Special Fund (Chartered Bank) 10,400 Realisation Accounts 200 Accrued interest 200 Cash 10,400 (Being the additional interest due to maturity of note and the deposit of fund in Chartered Bank) (viii) Capital: Oluwole 7,500 Capital: Osuji 3,000 Capital: Bamidele 4,500 Loss on Realisation 15,000 (Being the distribution of loss on realisation to partners) Please, note that the loss of N15,000 is the debit balance on the realisation account which after the journal entries have been posted, and appears thus: 71 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Dr. Realisation Account Cr.

What are the issues to consider when contemplating dissolution?
2.
Outline the order of priority for assets distribution at partnership liquidation.
3.2 Piecemeal dissolution of Partnerships Here, we shall consider the treatment of partnership dissolution when assets are realised piecemeal.
The winding-up of partnership may take place within a short period or it may be over an extended period.
The 72 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING case of the extended period is when it is not possible to liquidate all obligations at the time it is convenient to end the partnership.
As in the example of Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele partnership in 3.1 above, negotiations for the disposal of assets may take sometime and the payment for assets so disposed may be delayed.
In this situation, therefore, what is usually done is to make payments to partners in instalments as cash becomes available for distribution.
It is necessary, in piecemeal dissolution, to give special attention to losses which may occur.
For example, all assets not yet realised could be regarded as potential losses and temporarily allocated to the partners before any cash distribution.
The reason for this is to reduce the possibility of distributing more to a partner than that which he will be entitled to eventually.
We can use the method of „Greatest Possible Loss‟ to treat this.
Example: Using the balance sheet of Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele (3.1 above), the partnership agreement also provides for a profit and loss ratio of 50%, 20% and 30% respectively.
As part of the efforts to wind-up the partnership, we will assume that all available cash was first distributed to the partners on 31 July, 2001, after all current assets have been realised and all liabilities settled; but before the sale of the fixed assets and immediately after the creation of the special fund in the Chartered Bank of N10,400.
On this 31st July, 2001, cash of N44,600 is available for distribution; but before this the partners‟ capital balance was N191,600.
Therefore, the greatest possible loss will be N147,000 (N191,600 – N44,600).
At this point, let us note that two kinds of losses in the greatest possible method are: - losses already suffered through realisation and dissolution; - possible losses in the future.
In the above example, the past loss was N7,000 (that is, loss on the realisation of current assets) and the maximum future loss was N140,000 (that is, the book value of assets not yet converted).
Throughout the process of dissolution, the maximum loss will consist of the two kinds until the process is completed when actual loss and the greatest possible loss will be identified.
The greatest possible loss is allocated/distributed to the partners according to the profit and loss ratio.
Therefore, on 31st July, 2001, the amounts that can be safely paid to each partner are indicated as: 73 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Oluwole, Osuji & Bamidele Partnership Statement of Capital Balances as at 31st July, 2001 Particulars Total 50% 20% 30% N Oluwole Osuji Bamidele Balances as at 30/6/2001 191,600 84,000 39,200 68,400 Greatest possible loss 147,000 73,500 29,400 44,100 Cash to be distributed 44,600 10,500 9,800 24,300 On August 31, all the assets have been realised for N132,000.
Therefore, the greatest possible loss will be N15,000 (N147,000 – N132,000).
The statement of capital balances in August will be: Oluwole, Osuji & Bamidele Partnership Statement of Capital Balances as at 31st August, 2001 Particulars Total 50% 20% 30% N Oluwole Osuji Bamidele Balances as at 1/06/2001 147,000 73,500 29,400 44,100 Greatest possible loss 15,000 7,500 3,000 4,500 Cash to be distributed 132,000 66,000 26,400 39,600 The statement of capital balances is not the same as the statement for distribution to partners which is prepared when the affairs of the partnership are terminated.
Below speaks: Statement of Distribution of Assets to Partners Oluwole, Osuji & Bamidele from 1st July – 31st August, 2001 Particulars Total 50% 20% 30% N Oluwole Osuji Bamidele Cash distributed: 31st July, 2001 44,600 10,500 9,800 24,300 31st August, 2001 132,000 66,000 26,400 39,600 Total Distributed 176,600 76,500 36,200 63,900 Loss on Realisation 15,000 7,500 3,000 4,500 Capital Balances as At 30th June, 2001 191,600 84,000 39,200 68,400 74 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Self-Assessed Exercise 1.
What is the “Greatest Possible Loss” in relation to piecemeal asset sharing at dissolution?
2.
Mention the two kinds of the “Greatest Possible Loss”.
4.0 CONCLUSION Dissolution takes place when partners decide to dissolve and terminate the activities of a partnership.
Apart from having a clear perception, it is necessary to respect the order of distribution of the partnership assets in the event of termination and liquidation.
Dissolution can take place when all assets are realised in full or when assets are realised piecemeal.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have discussed the methods of dissolution of partnerships when all assets are realised in full as well as when assets are realised piecemeal.
We have seen the order of priority by which assets are distributed in the course of liquidation according to the Partnership Deed.
Also, we dwelt on the accounting treatment of non- cash assets as they are converted into cash before any assets are distributed to creditors and partners.

76 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 10: ACCOUNTS OF PARTNERSHIP III CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Accounts of Partnership III 3.1 Withdrawal of a Partner 3.2 Death of a Partner 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION We shall conclude our discussion on Accounts of Partnerships in this unit.
Earlier in units 8 and 9, we had explained what a partnership is, and distinguished between it and a company.
We had considered also, admission of a new partner as well as treatment of goodwill in partnership.
In addition, we looked at the different dimensions of partnerships dissolution.
The focus of this unit is the accounting treatment relative to the withdrawal or death of a partner.
If a partner withdraws, what are the methods of repayment of his capital and other benefits?
And if a partner dies, what are the procedures for closing partnership books?
These questions will guide our discussion.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Prepare the books of a partnership when any partner is withdrawing; - Ascertain the amount due to the retiring partner and how it should be repaid; - Close the partnership accounts on the death of a partner.
3.0 ACCOUNTS OF PARTNERSHIPS III 3.1 Withdrawal of a Partner A retiring partner, in the absence of any agreement, is entitled to have all partnership assets (including goodwill) revalued on a proper basis as at the retirement date.
Any appreciation or depreciation so revealed should be taken into account in calculating the amount due to him.
The total 77 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING amount so ascertained to be due is normally a debt by the firm to the retired partner.
An agreement may, however, be made between the partners whereby, in the event of the retirement of a partner, the remaining partners should assume, personally, the liabilities for the amount due.
Thus, the debt is no longer due by the firm but by the partners individually in the ratio agreed upon.
Before we go on, let us state that a retired partner remains liable for the partnership debts at the date of retirement.
However, when a new partner is introduced, by a contract of novation (substituted liability), the creditor may agree to look to the new partner in place of the old.
The partnership will adopt any of the following methods in settlement of debts due (value of capital and share of goodwill) to the retired partner:  Outright payment (lump sum, once and for all).
 By agreed instalments over a period of years, interest being allowed on the diminishing balance of the amount due.
 The amount due may be regarded as a loan to the partnership to carry the right of either a fixed rate of interest or a share of the profits of the firm.
 An annuity may be paid for life or for an agreed number of years or for the life of some of his dependants.
Let us explain and illustrate some of these.
(i) Repayment by Instalments: Here, the value of the retired partner‟s capital and share of his goodwill are ascertained and credited to a loan account, and repaid by instalments with interest running on the outstanding balance.
Then, the amount due to a retired partner is removed from being part of the partnership‟s capital.
Example: Zak, a partner in a firm retired on 31st March, 1990, and his share of capital and goodwill was ascertained to be N76,000.
It was arranged that this should be paid out by annual instalments of N20,000 to include principal and interest on the outstanding balance at 5% per annum.
The first payment was made one month after retirement, and subsequent payments were made on the anniversary of the date of retirement.
Show 78 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING the account in the partnership‟s books until liquidation.
Ignore income tax.

Usually, agreement in respect of the interest payable and the conditions for repayment are entered into at the date of retirement.
Where an option was given to the continuing partners to purchase the share of the retired partner and the option was exercised, the retired partner would not be entitled to further share of the partnership‟s profits.
His capital would be transferred to the capital account of the continuing partners who must pay him according to the terms of the agreement.
(iii) Repayment by Annuity: It could be agreed to settle the retiring partner by way of annuity for a certain number of years or for life.
A method of dealing with this matter in the partnership‟s books is to transfer the amount due to an annuity suspense account 79 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (which must be credited with interest at a fixed rate per annum) and profit and loss account is debited annually with the annuity paid.
If the credit balance on the Annuity Suspense Account is exhausted during the life time of the annuitant, subsequent instalments be borne by the partners and debited to divisible profit.
If the annuitant should die before the credit on the Annuity Suspense Account exhausts, the balance remaining on the account would be a profit to the continuing partners and should be transferred to their capital accounts in the proportion in which they share profits.
It is not advisable to transfer such profits to the profit and loss accounts or to the partners‟ current accounts since they do not normally represent liquid resources.
Revaluation Approaches Two methods of revaluation approach may be applied in ascertaining the amount due to a retiring partner: (i) Payment in excess of book value of assets: Suppose P, Q and R, being partners, with capital balances of N600,000, N800,000 and N600,000 respectively, and sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2.
P retires, and after revaluation of assets, the other partners agreed to pay him N800,000.
Therefore, the remaining partners, Q and R, will be charged with the excess of payment over book value of the capital balance of the retiring partner.
Usually, the bonus paid to the retiring partner is allocated to the remaining partners on the basis of their profit and loss ratio, which is 3:2.
The entries will be: Dr Cr N N Capital: P 600,000 Capital: Q 120,000 Capital: R 80,000 Liability to P 800,000 (Being the withdrawal of P from the partnership) This approach is highly favoured where the recognition of goodwill is difficult to be justified.
80 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (ii) Payment less than book value: A partner may sell his interest in a partnership by accepting less than the book value of his interest if he sees a poor prospect for the firm or needs working capital for personal reasons.
Using the example of P Q R partnership, suppose P is willing to withdraw and accepts to be paid N500,000, a bonus of N100,000 (which will be allocated on the basis of their 3:2 profit and loss ratio) will accrue to the remaining partners.
The entry will be: Dr Cr N N Capital: P 600,000 Capital: Q 60,000 Capital: R 40,000 Liability to P 500,000 (Being the withdrawal of P from the partnership) However, it will be observed from the above entry that the net assets of the partnership were not revalued.
Example: T, K and O were in partnership, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1.
T retired on 31st December, 1999, and it was agreed that an annuity of N9,000 per annum should be paid to him by the continuing partners, through the partnership, and he accepted this undertaking in full settlement of the balance due to him.
The balance sheet of the outfit before revaluation of assets on 31st December was as follows: T K O Balance Sheet N N Partners‟ Capital: T 90,000 K 50,000 O 40,000 180,000 Net assets (excluding goodwill) 180,000 81 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING To ascertain the amount due to T, goodwill was valued at N60,000, and the net assets were valued at N30,000 in excess of the amounts at which they stood in the books.
No goodwill account was raised and there was to be no alteration in the book amounts of the net assets.
Prepare the new capital account and the new balance sheet after T‟s retirement.
Solution: New Capital Account: T K O Balance b/f 90,000 50,000 40,000 Revaluation of assets: Goodwill 60,000 Net assets 30,000 Net assets 90,000 45,000 30,000 15,000 Transfer of T‟s to K and O - 90,000 45,000 135,000 170,000 100,000 Surplus on revaluation of assets per contra written-off in new profit sharing ratio 60,000 30,000 „K‟ and „O‟ – Balance of T‟s capital transferred 135,000 Balance c/f - 110,000 70,000 135,000 170,000 100,000 The New Balance Sheet after T‟s Retirement: N N Partners‟ Capital: K 110,000 O 70,000 180,000 Represented by: Net assets (excluding goodwill) 180,000 Self-Assessed Exercise 1.
What alternatives may be taken by a partnership in settlement of a retiring partner?
2.
Discuss the revaluation approaches in determining the amount payable to a retiring partner.
3.2 Death of a Partner Usually, a partnership is dissolved at the death of a partner.
The surviving partners and the executor of the estate of the deceased partner must negotiate a settlement for the partner‟s interest in the firm where 82 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING there are no specific provisions for settlement.
Alternatively, and as provided for in the Partnership Act 1890 (Section 42), where any member has died and the surviving partners carry on the business of the firm with its capital without any final settlement of account between the firm and the executors of the dead partner, the executors, in the absence of an agreement, is entitled to 5% interest per annum on the amount of his share of the partnership assets.
Example: O, A and U are partners in business, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of ¼: 1/8: 5/8.
The yearly accounts are made up to 30th September.
O died on 31st March, 1999, and A and U continued the business without paying out O‟s share of the partnership‟s assets or settling accounts with his trustee until 30th September, 1999.
The balance sheet as at 30th September, 1998 showed O‟s capital to be N16,000.
The partners‟ drawings during the year to 30th September, 1999 were N1,800, N500 and N3,500 for O, A and U respectively.
There was no agreement for interest on capital but O and A were each to be credited with a salary of N1,000 per annum.
Subject to this charge, the profits for the year ended 30th September, 1999 were N11,600, which may be assumed to have accrued evenly throughout the year.
Required: Show the balance of profits and salary due to each partner, and the total amount due by A and U to O‟s Estate at 30/9/99, assuming that O‟s trustee does not propose to apply to the court for a share of profits.

The Realisation account will also be debited with any expenses of realisation, and cash credited.
84 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (ii) Debit cash and credit realisation account with the amount realised on the sale of the assets.
Where any of the assets is taken over at a valuation by any of the partners, debit such partners‟ capital accounts and credit realisation account with the agreed price.
(iii) Pay-off the liabilities, crediting cash and debiting sundry creditors.
Any discount allowed by creditors on discharging liabilities should be debited to the creditors‟ accounts and credited to Realisation Account.
(iv) The balance of Realisation Account will be the amount of the profit or loss on realisation, which will be divided between the partners in the proportion in which they share profits and losses, and transferred to their capital accounts.
(v) Pay-off any partners‟ advances as distinct from capital, first setting-off any debit balance on the capital account of a partner against his loan account.
(vi) The balance of the cash book will now be exactly equal to the balances on the capital accounts, provided they are in credit; credit cash and debit the partners‟ capital accounts with the amounts paid to them to close their accounts.
In case the capital account of any partner be in debit after being debited with his share of the loss, or credited with his share of the profit on realisation, the cash will be insufficient by the amount of such debit balance to pay the other partners the amount due to them.
If the partner whose account is in debit pays to the firm the amount of his indebtedness, the other partners‟ capital accounts can then be closed by the payment of cash.
However, if he is unable to do so, the deficiency must be borne by the solvent partners, in proportion to their capitals and not in the proportion in which they share profits and losses (Refer to the case of Garner Versus Murray).
Example: A, B and C with unequal capitals, share profits and losses equally.
They decided to dissolve the partnership, and the Balance Sheet after asset realisation and liabilities discharged is stated as follows: 85 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Dr. Balance Sheet of ABC Cr.
N N Capitals: A 600 Cash 500 B 400 Capital: C – Overdrawn 200 _____ Deficiency of assets 300 1,000 1,000 “C” is insolvent, and is unable to contribute to anything towards either his overdraft on capital or his share of the loss on realisation.
Close their books.
Solution: The loss on realisation of N300 should first be debited in the profit sharing ratio to the partners‟ accounts, thus, reducing A‟s capital to N500 and B‟s to N300; and increasing C‟s deficit to N300.
A and B would introduce cash of N100 each to make good their shares of the deficiency, and thus, restore their capitals to N600 respectively.
Then, the balances remaining in the books would be as shown by the reconstructed balance sheet below: Dr. Reconstructed Balance Sheet Cr.
N N Capitals: A 600 Cash 700 B 400 C‟s Capital overdrawn 300 1,000 1,000 The only true assets which the cash of N700 represents, would be shared between the solvent partners of A and B in proportion to their capitals as follows: A - 60% of N700 = N420 B - 40% of N700 = N280 The only balances remaining in the books would be the debt balance on C‟s capital account of N300 and the credit balances on the capital accounts of A and B – N180 and N120 respectively.
As “C” is insolvent, the debt balance on his Account will be written-off against A and B in the ratio of their respective capitals, thus, closing their accounts.
86 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Self-Assessed Exercise Outline the procedure for closing partnership books.
4.0 CONCLUSION A retiring partner is entitled to have all partnership assets revalued on a proper basis as at the retirement date so as to reveal appreciation or depreciation, which should be taken into account in ascertaining the amount due to him.
Depending on the arrangement, his due is either a debt by the firm or by the remaining partners who may continue to carry on the partnership business thereafter.
On the other hand, and in most cases, the death of a partner dissolves the partnership.
Where the surviving partners decide to continue in the business after the demise of a partner, the deceased partner‟s interest in the partnership must be settled appropriately, and the partnership books closed.
It is important to be conversant with the outline of the procedure for closing partnership books.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have been able to deal with the accounting treatment relative to the withdrawal or death of a partner.
We have been able to answer the question as to the methods of repayment of a partner‟s interests when he withdraws as well as the procedure for closing partnership books at the demise of any of the partners.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENTS 1.
Explain the contract of substituted liability relative to the withdrawal of a partner.
2.
A, B, C were partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1.
„A‟ retired from the firm with effect from 31/12/2000, the determined amount of his share being N10,000.
It was agreed that this should be commuted by an annuity of N1,500, the first payment to be made on the following day and subsequent payments on 1st January of each year.
„A‟ died after the receipt of the fifth annuity payment.
You are required to show the annuity suspense account in the books of the firm, assuming that the amount outstanding is deemed to earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum.

88 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 11: ACCOUNTS OF NON-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Accounts of Non-profit Organisations 3.1 Characteristics of Non-profit Organisations 3.2 Clubs and Associations – Accounting Requirements 3.3 Receipts and Payments Accounts 3.4 Income and Expenditure Accounts 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION Accounting, as a tool for measurement and communication, is relevant to both business and non-business situations, to all forms of organisations, whether they exist to make profit or not.
So far in this course, we have assumed accounting situations where the primary goal is profit-making.
A non-profit organisation such as a church association, school, social club, sports club or charitable institution is one which is funded by members‟ subscriptions or donations and such funds are used to achieve the objectives of the organisations.
In its book-keeping, although the basic principles appear the same, the kind of final accounts prepared by a non-profit organisation tend to differ from those prepared by a profit- making outfit.
Therefore, this unit will attempt to explore into the nature of non-profit organisations, their accounting requirements as well as the nature of final accounts prepared by them.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Explain the characteristics of non-profit organisations; - Explain the accounting requirements of clubs and associations; - Prepare receipts and payments accounts; - Prepare income and expenditure accounts.
89 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 ACCOUNTS OF NON-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS 3.1 Characteristics of Non-profit Organisations It is the nature of non-profit organisations, as their name implies, to carry on their activities without the profit motive.
They may trade or carry on any other type of business but with the aim of rendering service at the minimum cost.
This suggests that they may charge for the services just to recover costs with little or no surplus.
The surplus (not profit) they may make could be regarded as a by-product.
Usually, by way of capital, there is little permanent investment by members.
Any permanent fund is usually the outcome of periodic surpluses of receipts over payments or income over expenditure accumulated over a number of years.
Non-profit organisations usually have “Accumulated Fund” (as we shall see later) in place of “Capital”, and as a result, members have no proprietary right which they may withdraw or transfer upon cessation of membership.
The usual sources of revenue for non-profit concerns are fees, periodic subscriptions and donations.
At times, some trading activities may be carried out and a little margin made therefrom, for example, sale of magazines or journals, sale of food and drinks in a club house, etc.
Also, fund-raising activities like exhibitions and variety nights, may be organised, from time to time, to get money.
The kind of final accounts prepared by non-profit organisations are either „Receipts and Payments‟ accounts or „Income and Expenditure‟ accounts.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the features of non-profit organisations.
3.2 Clubs and Associations – Accounting Requirements The final accounts which are presented to members of non-profit organisations usually reports to what extent incomes from all sources were enough to meet the expenses incurred during a particular period.
Here, “income” can be viewed or adopted either on cash basis or accrual basis.
When the cash basis is adopted, a receipts and payments account is prepared but if situation warrants adopting the accrual basis, an income and expenditure account is prepared.
We shall explain these statements shortly.
90 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING A balance sheet, as in the case of profit-making concerns, is also usually prepared which shows the summarised values of assets, liabilities and the accumulated fund being carried forward to the next period.
Self-Assessed Exercise What are the accounting requirements of non-profit organisations?
3.3 Receipts and Payments Accounts Receipts and payments accounts are merely a summary of the cash book for the period.
In other words, it is a summary of all the cash transactions carried out during a period.
This may be adopted when a very small non-profit concern carries out transactions on cash basis and does not feel the need for more sophisticated information other than merely being interested in assessing the entity‟s liquidity position.
As a measure of success or otherwise of the activities of the period, the receipts and payments accounts suffer some drawbacks arising mainly from the exclusive reliance on receipts and payments (cash movements) as the evidence that the transaction has taken place.
Thus, they do not adequately disclose the results of the organisation‟s activities during a period because:  they do not take account of credit transactions – debtors and creditors are not disclosed;  they fail to make a distinction between capital and revenue items;  they take no account of accruals and prepayments.
Example: Fitness Sports Club was formally established on 1st January, 2004 and was granted the free use of a clubhouse at Kokoma.
The following are its financial transactions for the year ended 31st December, 2004 as recorded in the treasurer‟s only financial record, the cash book: Dr. Receipts and Payments Account Cr.
Date Particulars Folio Amount Date Particulars Folio Amount (N) (N) Balance b/d 16,500.00 Wages 1,300.00 Subscriptions 800.00 Equipment 4,000.00 Admission fees 1,500.00 Wages 1,300.00 Proceeds from Wages 1,200.00 journal sales 2,000.00 Subscriptions 4,000.00 Donations 2,300.00 Balance c/d 19,300.00 27,100.00 27,100.00 Balance b/d 19,300.00 91 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING You are required to prepare a statement of receipts and payments for the year ended 31st December, 2004.
FITNESS SPORTS CLUB STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2004 N N Balance b/d (opening balance) 16,500.00 Add: Receipts: Subscriptions 4,800.00 Admission fees 1,500.00 Sales of journals 2,000.00 Donations 2,300.00 10,600.00 27,100.00 Less: Payments: Wages 3,800.00 Equipment 4,000.00 7,800.00 Balance c/d (closing balance) 19,300.00 Explanation:  The statement is prepared on a cash flow basis and reflects only the receipts and payments of cash.
 No cognisance is taken of the fact that income and expenditure of a capital nature, such as the purchase of equipment, has taken place.
 No cognisance is taken of items such as subscriptions which may be in arrears or prepaid.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the disadvantages inherent in adopting the receipts and payments accounts as a measure of the performance of non-profit organisations‟ activities during a period.
3.4 Income and Expenditure Accounts The limitations of the receipts and payments accounts make it necessary for many non-profit organisations to present reports which are prepared on the accrual basis and in accordance with the principles of double entry.
Income is recognised once it is realised whether or not proceeds have actually been received.
In like manner, all costs would be taken into account once they have been incurred whether or not they have actually been paid.
In effect, income and expenditure accounts have to 92 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING be prepared on the basis of systematic standard procedures of book- keeping.
The income concept, as disclosed by the income and expenditure account, is much more accurate than that disclosed by the receipts and payments account.
Note that income and expenditure account, and the profit and loss account are the same in form and structure, but differ conceptually, for example:  In the income and expenditure account, revenue refers to fees, subscriptions, donations received as against “Sales” in the profit and loss account.
 The difference between revenue and expenditure is known as “surplus” or “deficit” as against “profit” or “loss”.
Example: Assume that in addition to the transactions recorded in the receipts and payments of Fitness Sports Club in 3.3 above, the following information is made available by the Treasurer: (i) On 1st January, 2004, the club had the following assets: Bank Balance N16,500.00 Equipment at carrying value 6,000.00 (ii) The register of club members shows: Membership at 1st January, 2004 20 Joined during the year 5 Membership at 31st December, 2004 25 Club members each pay an annual subscription of N300.00 and new members pay an additional admission fee of N300.00.
At 31st December, 2004, one member had already paid his subscription for the year to 31st December, 2005.
It is not the club‟s practice to treat admission fees as income but as a contribution towards accumulated funds.
(iii) At the end of each year, 20% of the carrying value of equipment is to be treated as depreciation.
(iv) The Editor/Marketer of the journal provided documentation indicating that N6,100.00 had been raised and that expenses had totalled N4,100.00.
Required: Prepare a statement of income and expenditure for the year ended 31st December, 2004, and a balance sheet as at that date.
93 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Solution: FITNESS SPORTS CLUB STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2004 N N Income: Subscriptions (25 x N300) 7,500.00 Sales of journals 6,100.00 Donations 2,300.00 15,900.00 Less: Expenses: Journal expenses 4,100.00 Wages 3,800.00 Depreciation (20% of N10,000) 2,000.00 9,900.00 Surplus of income over expenditure 6,000.00 FITNESS SPORTS CLUB BALANCE SHEET AS AT 31ST DECEMBER, 2004 N N ASSET: Fixed Assets: Equipment at cost less depreciation (10,000 – 2,000) 8,000.00 Current Assets: Subscriptions in arrears 3,000.00 Cash at bank 19,300.00 22,300.00 Total Assets 30,300.00 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES: Accumulated Funds: Balance beginning of year (16,500 + 6,000) 22,500.00 Add: Surplus 6,000.00 Admission fees (5 x 300) 1,500.00 30,000.00 Current Liabilities: 94 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Subscriptions in advance 300.00 Total Equity and Liabilities 30,300.00 Explanation:  The opening accumulated fund of N22,500.00 is the bank balance (16,500) plus the equipment (N6,000) as these were the only assets on hand on 1st January.
 The adjustments for subscriptions (nominal account) and depreciation were made.
Self-Assessed Exercise Distinguish between Receipts and Payments account and Income and Expenditure account relative to non-profit organisations.
4.0 CONCLUSION We wish to conclude that non-profit organisations, as the name suggests, exist not for profit-making but to achieve the objectives for which they are established.
They could be churches, sports clubs, charitable organisations, etc.
What appears to be „profit‟ at the end of their accounting period is regarded as „surplus‟ which results from receipts in excess of payments.
Between the profit-making and non-profit organisations, although they adopt similar basic principles of book- keeping, they prepare different final accounts.
Non-profit organisations prepare receipts and payments account or income and expenditure account instead of profit and loss account.
Also, they have “accumulated fund” in place of “capital” in the balance sheet.
Receipts and payments accounts are not actually accounts but summary statements – summarises all cash transactions carried out during the period.
Their major limitation lies on their being prepared on cash basis hence they do not adequately disclose the organisation‟s results at the end of the period.
On the other hand, the income and expenditure accounts are prepared on accrual basis and according to the principles of double entry.
Therefore, cognisance is taken of credit transactions (debtors and creditors), accruals and prepayments as well as the distinction between capital and revenue items.
95 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have been exposed to the nature of non-profit organisations and their accounting requirements.
We have also considered the preparation of their final accounts – receipts and payments accounts, income and expenditure accounts, and the balance sheet.
However, because of the limitations of the receipts and payments accounts, income and expenditure accounts are better preferred.

The goods (merchandise) are valued at the actual cost to the firm, usually obtained from the supplier‟s invoice.
However, there are firms whose main activity is in the manufacture of goods for sale.
For these concerns, in addition to the trading and profit and loss account, a manufacturing account is prepared.
The manufacturing firm transforms basic raw materials into marketable goods, and during the manufacturing process, costs are incurred in order to complete the products.
These end products are valued at cost to the firm, usually the aggregate of the manufacturing costs.
Obviously, at the end of the accounting period, stock or inventory in this kind of concern will be at various stages of completion since manufacturing is a continuous process.
Three stages of completion can be identified:  Raw materials (unprocessed and uncompleted stock)  Work-in-progress (partly – completed stock)  Finished goods (completed stock) The main difference between the trading and profit and loss account of a manufacturing business and a trading firm is the ascertainment of cost of goods manufactured as against the cost of goods purchased for reselling.
In this unit therefore, we shall highlight the objectives of a manufacturing account.
We shall also classify the manufacturing costs and draw a line of division between them and the non-manufacturing 98 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING costs.
In addition, we shall discuss the valuation of closing stock/ work- in-progress in accordance with the basic principles.
Lastly, we shall look into the matter of ascertaining profit or loss on manufacture to determine the relative advantage of manufacturing instead of buying the goods for resale.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Explain the objectives of a manufacturing account; - Discuss the classification of manufacturing costs; - Distinguish between manufacturing costs and non- manufacturing costs; - Explain the valuation of closing stock relative to manufacturing concerns; - Ascertain the profit or loss on manufacture; - Prepare a manufacturing account.
3.0 MANUFACTURING ACCOUNTS 3.1 Objectives of a Manufacturing Account When a firm engages in manufacture, there arises the need to ascertain the cost of manufacture as a basis for fixing the eventual selling price.
This need is met by the manufacturing account, which is prepared in such situation in addition to the normal trading and profit and loss accounts.
Therefore the aims of the manufacturing account are: - to disclose the total cost of manufacture; - to enable the firm to determine the relative efficiency of its manufacturing activity separate from its trading activities.
This is achieved by computing the profit or loss arising from manufacture on one hand as distinct from its selling operations.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain the objectives of a manufacturing account.
3.2 Classification of Manufacturing Costs There is an obvious link with the costing records because the costs in the manufacturing account are involved with production, and the concepts of the manufacturing account are in fact really costing concepts.
99 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Therefore, we shall examine the main elements and divisions of cost as used in costing.
Manufacturing (or production) costs are the costs incurred by a manufacturer in the process of transforming raw materials into finished products, which should be distinguished from non-manufacturing costs such as administrative and selling/distribution expenses.
The classification can be done as follows:  Direct or Prime Cost o Direct materials o Direct labour o Direct expenses  Indirect or Factory/Works Overhead Expenses By “direct” is meant that the materials, labour and expenses involved can be traced to the particular unit of goods produced.
Factory overhead expenses consist of all those expenses which are not easily traceable to the units being manufactured.
Examples include wages of cleaners and crane drivers, rent and rates of the factory, depreciation of plant and machinery used in the factory and factory power.
To summarise, therefore, direct costs and factory overhead make up the manufacturing or production cost.
However, to ascertain the total costs, which guide in fixing the relevant selling price, the non-manufacturing costs of administrative and selling/distribution expenses, are added to the manufacturing costs.
Administrative expenses include such items as manager‟s salaries, legal and accounting charges, the depreciation of accountancy machinery and secretarial salaries.
Selling and distribution expenses are items such as salesmen‟s salaries and commission, carriage outwards, depreciation of delivery vans, advertising and display expenses.
In the manufacturing account, the manufacturing cost of goods completed during the accounting period is ascertained.
This means that all the elements of the production cost – direct materials, direct labour, direct expenses and factory overhead expenses – are charged to the manufacturing account.
All administrative and selling and distribution expenses are charged to the profit and loss account.
You are to note that the manufacturing account is concerned with the production cost of goods completed in the year irrespective of when work started on them.
100 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Therefore, semi-finished goods (work-in-progress) must be taken into account.
Self-Assessed Exercise 1.
Attempt a classification of the production costs with examples.
2.
Distinguish between manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs.
3.3 Valuation of Closing Stock The inventory of a manufacturing concern may comprise raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods at any one time.
It is often necessary to ascertain accurately the cost at which work-in-progress is carried over from one period to another.
The basic principle followed in valuing stock is to relate to each type of stock a proportion of the total cost incurred up to the level where the stock accrues.
Thus,  raw materials are valued at the cost of purchase (if lower than current market price);  finished goods are valued as a proportion of the total cost of production;  semi-finished goods (work-in-progress) are valued at prime cost only (although debate had it that it might have been more accurate to attribute to them a proportion of factory overhead once they have received some benefits from these indirect costs).
At this juncture, let us illustrate the preparation of a manufacturing, trading and profit and loss account.
Example: The following are extracted from the trial balance of TEKI LTD, a manufacturing outfit, in respect of the year ended 30th September, 1993: N Opening stock: Raw material 12,500 Work-in-progress 8,600 Finished goods 14,800 Purchase of raw materials 68,200 Carriage inwards 3,410 Factory wages 18,390 Rent of factory 4,800 Factory general expenses 8,360 Salaries of factory supervisors 8,740 Salaries of salesmen and office staff 22,570 101 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Rent of office 5,400 Insurance of factory equipment 2,840 Bad debts 960 Office general expenses 12,930 Depreciation: Factory equipment 16,280 Office and distribution equipment 14,880 Sales less returns 215,000 Power and lighting (factory) 5,610 Power and lighting (general) 3,200 Closing stocks were valued at the following amounts at year end: Raw materials 14,480 Work-in-progress 10,250 Finished goods 18,390 Work-in-progress is normally valued in this firm at prime cost plus a portion of factory overheads.
You are required to prepare the manufacturing, trading, and profit and loss accounts as at end of year.
Solution: TEKI LTD.

3.4 Ascertainment of Profit or Loss on Manufacture In the last example, we disclosed a composite gross profit of N85,590, which represents what was realised from both manufacturing and selling operations.
When we desire to ascertain the relative advantage of manufacturing instead of buying the goods for resale, the manufacturing account will have to be restructured so as to disclose separately the gross profit or loss accruing from manufacturing as well as trading operations.
The profit or loss on manufacture is ascertained on the basis of the opportunity cost principle, that is, by referring to what the firm would have spent in purchasing instead of manufacturing the goods.
Thus, if the total purchase value is more than the cost of manufacture, a gross profit on manufacture has resulted.
On the other hand, a loss will arise if the manufacturing cost exceeds purchase cost.
Therefore, it requires that finished goods are taken out of the factory at the estimated market value (purchase cost) instead of the actual cost of production.
Thus, the estimated market value is credited to the manufacturing account and debited to the trading account.
A credit balance represents a gross profit on manufacturing while a debit 103 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING balance represents a loss.
The difference is then transferred to the profit and loss account as appropriate.
Example: Let us assume the same data as in the previous example.
Let us also assume that the firm likes to ascertain the relative efficiency of its manufacturing operations, and estimates that had it not manufactured the goods, it would have purchased the total volume which it finished during the period at a cost of N150,000.00.
We are required to prepare the manufacturing, trading and profit and loss accounts of TEKI LTD, showing separately, the profit or loss on manufacturing as against selling operations.
Solution: TEKI LTD. MANUFACTURING, TRADING AND PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH SEPTEMBER, 1993 N N N Estimated market value of finished goods 150,000 Raw materials: Opening stock 12,500 Purchases 68,200 Carriage inwards 3,410 84,110 Less: Closing stock 14,480 Cost of materials consumed 69,630 Direct Wages 18,390 PRIME COST 88,020 Add: Factory overheads Rent on factory 4,800 Supervisors‟ salaries 8,740 Insurance of equipment 2,840 Power and lighting 5,610 Factory general expenses 8,360 Depreciation of equipment 16,280 46,630 COST OF PRODUCTION 134,650 Add: Opening work-in-progress 8,600 Less: Closing work-in-progress 10,250 COST OF GOODS COMPLETED 133,000 Profit on Manufacturing 17,000 Sales 215,000 104 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Finished goods: Opening stock 14,800 Market value of finished goods 150,000 Less closing stock 18,390 146,410 GROSS PROFIT 68,590 Less: Administrative, Selling and Distribution Expenses Office and salesmen‟s salaries 22,570 Rent on office space 5,400 Power and lighting 3,200 Office general expenses 12,930 Bad debts 960 Depreciation 14,880 59,940 Net Profit 8,650 Add Profit on Manufacture 17,000 NET PROFIT N25,650 Self-Assessed Exercise  How do you ascertain the profit or loss on manufacture?
 On what basis is the profit or loss on manufacture ascertained?
Explain the basis.
4.0 CONCLUSION Apart from the trading and profit and loss account, a manufacturing account is prepared for concerns whose main activity is in the manufacture of goods for sale.
The goods, because costs are incurred during the manufacturing process, are valued at costs to the firm.
The major distinguishing factor between the trading, profit and loss accounts of a manufacturing business and those of a trading firm lies in the ascertainment of cost of goods manufactured as against the cost of goods purchased for resale.
The manufacturing account, thus, aims at disclosing the total cost of manufacture as well as enabling the firm to determine the relative efficiency of manufacturing in place of buying of goods for resale.
5.0 SUMMARY The manufacturing firm transforms raw materials into finished goods for sale.
Costs are incurred, during the manufacturing process, in order to complete the products.
A manufacturing account is prepared for a manufacturing company.
105 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING In this unit, we have been able to highlight the objectives of a manufacturing account.
We have also classified the manufacturing costs, and distinguished between them (manufacturing costs) and the non-manufacturing costs such as administrative, selling and distribution costs.
We discussed, in addition, the valuation of the closing stock of a manufacturing concern, emphasising the principle that relates to each type of inventory, a proportion of the total cost incurred up to the level where the stock accrues.
Finally, we discussed the ascertainment of profit or loss on manufacture relative to purchase of finished goods for resale, using the principle of opportunity cost by considering what the firm would have spent in purchasing in place of manufacturing the goods.

107 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 13: CONTROL ACCOUNTS Table of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Control Accounts 3.1 Meaning of Control Accounts 3.2 Writing Control Accounts 3.3 Advantages of Control Accounts 3.4 Accounting treatment of certain items in Control Accounts 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION The whole process of book-keeping revolves around the idea that the records “balance”, that is, every transaction has a credit and a debit, and the total of the debits equals the total of the credits.
In other words, if there are no errors in the records, the trial balance will balance.
When a trial balance does not balance, it shows that errors have been made in the accounting entries which may be difficult and time- consuming to trace, especially in a large business organisation.
The problem of errors can be solved by having a control account for each ledger that shall act as a check on the accuracy of the entries in that ledger.
Most notably of control accounts are the debtors and creditors control accounts.
These are ledger accounts which summarise a large number of transactions, and should be free from errors if the trial balance must agree.
Sometimes, a ledger that has a control account is referred to as a self-balancing ledger.
In this unit, therefore, apart from looking at the meaning of control account, we shall consider how control accounts are written-up.
Also, we shall explain what advantages control accounts have.
And lastly, we shall go into the treatment of certain items in the control account.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Explain the meaning of control accounts; - Discuss how control accounts are written-up; - Explain the advantages of control accounts; 108 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING - Give accounting treatment to certain items in the control accounts.
3.0 CONTROL ACCOUNTS 3.1 Meaning of Control Accounts A control account is an account which contains the summary of entries in the individual accounts in each ledger.
Put in another way, a control or total account is a replica, in summarised form, of the accounts in the ledger to which it relates.
By logic of extension, therefore, the balance on this account, all things being equal, will be equal to the total of all individual balances in the ledger.
The principle of control accounts can be applied to all ledgers but it is usually restricted to sales ledger and purchases ledger.
Self Assessed Exercise What do you understand by a control account?
3.2 Writing Control Accounts From the explanation above, we understand that a control account contains the summary of entries in individual accounts.
However, the figures posted to the control account are not obtained from the individual accounts themselves.
For example, the figures posted to the debtors‟ control account are not obtained from the individual debtors‟ accounts while the figures posted to the creditors‟ control account are not obtained from the individual creditors‟ accounts.
Instead, the total credit sales, total returns from customers, and total discounts allowed figures posted to the debtors‟ control account are obtained from the sales day book, returns inwards day book and discount allowed column of the 3 – column cash book respectively.
Similarly, the total credit purchases, total returns to suppliers and total discount received figures posted to the creditors‟ control account are obtained from the purchases day book, returns outwards day book and the discounts received day book of the 3 – column cash book respectively.
It has to be mentioned that the control accounts are memoranda records which implies that the entries in them are not made on the basis of double entry.
The double-entries are the ones made in the individual accounts.
109 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING At this point, let us summarise the sources of the entries posted to the control accounts: DEBTORS‟ CONTROL ACCOUNT Debit Entries Source Total credit sales Sales day book Dishonoured cheques from customers Cash book Interest charged to customers Journal book Bill receivable dishonoured Journal book Credit Entries Source Cheques and cash received from customers Cash book Discount allowed Discount allowed column of 3 – column cash book Bad debt Journal book Bills receivable accepted by customers Journal book Returns inwards Returns inwards day book Purchases ledger contras (set-off) Journal book CREDITORS‟ CONTROL ACCOUNT Debit Entries Source Cheques and cash paid to suppliers Cash book Discount received Discount received column of cash book Bills payable accepted in favour of suppliers Journal book Returns outwards Returns outwards day book Sales ledger contras (set-off) Journal book Credit Entries Source Total credit purchases Purchases day book Dishonoured cheques Cash book Interest charged by suppliers Journal book Bills payable dishonoured Journal book Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss how control accounts are written-up.
Give specific examples of entries and sources.
110 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.3 Advantages of Control Accounts From our discussions so far, let us highlight the merits of control accounts as follows:  A control account serves as a check on the accuracy of the entries in the ledger to which it relates.
Thus, control accounts make it possible to localise errors to specific ledgers so that precious time is not wasted checking ledgers which have no errors.
 Because control accounts are usually put under the charge of a senior official, they serve as a check against error and fraud by the juniors who keep the ledgers.
 For management purposes, the balance on the sales ledger control account can be taken to be the total amount owed to creditors.
This saves the time and efforts of drawing up the debtors‟ and creditors‟ schedules, thereby, aid the timely preparation of draft periodic accounts.
Self-Assessed Exercise Discuss the advantages of control accounts.
3.4 Accounting treatment of certain items in Control Accounts  Debtors‟ Control Account o Bills receivable – where bills receivable and bills receivable accepted are both given, the later should be used because the obligation of the debtor on a bill arises only when he accepts the bill.
However, when only bills receivable is given, it should be interpreted to mean bills receivable accepted.
o Bills receivable discounted should be disregarded.
When a bill is discounted, no entry goes to the debtors‟ account, and invariably, no entry in respect of that would go to the debtors‟ control account.
o Bills receivable honoured should be disregarded.
When a debtor honours a bill receivable, no entry is made to the debtors‟ account, and therefore, no entry need be made to the debtors‟ control account.
o Bad debt recovered should be ignored unless it had earlier been credited to the debtors‟ control account along with the other sums collected from debtors.
In that case, it should be debited to the debtors‟ control account.
111 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING o Provision for bad/doubtful debt and discount allowable should be disregarded because they do not affect the debtors‟ account at all.
Therefore, no entry need be made to the debtors‟ control account in respect of these provisions.
o Cash sales should be disregarded.
The entry for cash sale is to debit the cash book and credit the sales account.
Since no entry is made to the customer‟s account, it would not be necessary to make any entry to the debtors‟ control account in respect of cash sales.
 Creditors‟ Control Account o Where “bills payable” and “bills payable accepted” are both given, the latter should be used because the right of the creditor on a bill arises only when the debtor accepts the bill.
However, where only “bills payable” is given, it should be interpreted to mean “bills payable accepted”.
o Bills payable honoured should be ignored because when a bill payable is honoured, no entry is made to the creditors‟ account and, of course, no entry need be made to the creditors‟ control account.
o Provision for discount receivable should be disregarded because it does not affect the creditors‟ control account.
o Cash purchases should be disregarded because the related entries have nothing to do with either the creditors‟ account or the creditors‟ control account.
Example: Maduako, a sole trader, keeps his books so that a sales ledger control account and a purchases ledger control account are shown in his general ledger and balanced at the end of the month.
From the following details, show how these two control accounts will appear in the general ledger for the month of December, 1997.

The notable control accounts are the debtors and creditors control accounts.
A control account has the advantage of serving as a check on the accuracy of the entries in the ledger to which it relates.
5.0 SUMMARY We have seen the control (or total) account as one which contains the summary of entries in the individual accounts in each ledger.
We have also observed that the figures posted to the control accounts are not obtained from the individual accounts themselves.
114 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Mention was made that the control accounts are memoranda records which means that the entries in them are not made on the double-entry principle.
We have also considered the various advantages which control accounts can offer as well as the accounting treatment given to certain items in the control accounts.

115 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 14: ACCOUNTS FROM INCOMPLETE RECORDS Table of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Accounts from Incomplete Records 3.1 Meaning of Incomplete Records 3.2 Situation of No Records 3.3 Situation of Partial Records 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference and Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION “Incomplete accounting records” refers to a situation where the accounting system do not apply the principles of double entry, thus, making it difficult or impossible to draw up the normal trading and profit and loss account as well as produce a trial balance.
Two distinguishable situations of this are where no records are kept at all and where partial records are maintained usually in the form of real accounts (cash or fixed assets) but personal and expense accounts are omitted.
This unit will concentrate on the above situations.
The essence, if not the quintessence, is to explore the possibility or feasibility of creating something out of nothing – having some idea of the trading results with scanty accounting information.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Give meaning to the term „incomplete records‟; - Compute the trading results where no records are kept; - Compute the trading results and net investments in the business where partial records are kept.
3.0 ACCOUNTS FROM INCOMPLETE RECORDS 3.1 Meaning of Incomplete Records From our introduction above, we can say that “incomplete records” denotes varying degrees of deviation from the standard accounting records which are kept on the „complete‟ principle of double entry.
In 116 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING other words, it describes records which the trader has not fully completed or where no records at all have been kept of transactions.
However, it may still be possible to prepare periodic financial statements if the relevant basic documents are made available from which the required additional information can be obtained.
The matter of incomplete accounting records is more often associated with the sole proprietorships.
Self-Assessed Exercise Explain what you understand by the term „incomplete records‟ under two distinct situations.
3.2 Situation of No Records Where no records have been kept, the accountant will fall back to a great extent on basic source documents such as receipts, invoices, and bank tellers/statements as well as the entity‟s transaction files.
Some information relating to opening/closing stocks, cash balances, fixed assets, debtors, creditors and the opening capital position can be gotten from the proprietor through interviews.
Also, where there are no reliable records to lay hands on, further interviews with the proprietor may reveal the extent and frequency of cash withdrawals from the business to meet personal obligations as well as cash or assets introduced into the business during the year, to enable the accountant make appropriate estimates.
A „statement of affairs‟ may be prepared as at the start of the period and another as at the close of period if the aim is just to let the proprietor have some approximate idea of the period‟s trading results and the closing net worth.
A „statement of affairs‟, which is the name given to what would have been called a „balance sheet‟ if it had been drawn from a set of records, is a summary of an entity‟s assets, liabilities and capital at a particular date.
It contains approximate values rather than values disclosed by books of account which have been kept systematically.
A comparison of the net asset position on the two dates (start and close of periods) will show the amount by which the proprietor‟s capital had increased/decreased during the intervening period.
If there were no withdrawals and no new capital introduced during the period, this difference must be of the nature of profit or loss.
To calculate the amount of profit (or loss) realised between the intervening periods from the relevant statements of affairs would 117 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING require, firstly, that we find the net increase in the net asset and then add back drawings (if any)and deduct new capital introduced (if any).
Example: The statement of affairs of Ryzma, a sole proprietor, disclosed capital as at 31st December, 2001 and 2002 as N450,000 and N600,000 respectively.
During the year, Ryzma introduced an old delivery van valued at N100,000 but total drawings in cash and goods amounted to N200,000.
Compute the net profit for the year.
Solution: Net change in net worth (capital): N Closing balance 600,000 Opening balance 450,000 Difference 150,000 Add: Drawings 200,000 Less: Capital introduced 100,000 Net profit for the year 250,000 Let us look at another example: The following information is disclosed in respect of Rodro & Co., who did not maintain a set of accounting records during the year 1st July, 1992 to 30th June, 1993.
You are required to prepare a set of accounts, highlighting the company‟s profit for the year as well as the closing networth.
Estimated Values As at 1/7/92 As at 30/6/93 N N Land and Buildings 25,000 24,000 Plant and machinery 34,000 30,000 Office furniture 6,000 7,000 Motor vehicles - 4,000 Stocks 12,000 15,000 Sundry Debtors 8,000 12,000 Sundry Creditors 13,000 15,000 Cash 2,000 3,000 During the year, Rodro withdrew cash and goods amounting to N4,500 for his personal use.
He, however, brought in sundry assets valued at N3,000.
Prepare statement of affairs for Rodro & Co. highlighting the trading results and the financial position of the firm.

 Explain the computation of trading results in a situation of „No records‟.
119 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.3 Situation of Partial Records Where partial records are kept (which may be referred to as single entry accounts), some concerns are able to keep a cash book for much of their transactions that are carried out in cash or through the bank.
However, cash book entries are usually not posted as few or no ledger accounts are kept.
In this circumstance, the accountant will have to fall back on basic documents relating to sales, purchases, cash transactions, etc.
which may be filed, as well as the management for additional information.
It is important to obtain information relating to fixed assets inventory, inventory values, accruals and prepayments.
Also, the accountant may have to convert the entire system into a double entry system first before embarking on the preparation of the final accounts.
When the books are kept on the single entry principle, a common problem which arises is the determination of purchases and sales figures in the absence of accounts maintained for these items.
However, the total amounts of sales and purchases for a period can be derived once information is given in respect of the outstanding debtors and creditors at the beginning and close of the period, and also, on the total cash movement during the period between the firm and its customers and suppliers.
Example: Derive the total sales figure from the following information extracted from a firm‟s cash book and other relevant records: N Total debtors b/f 5,600 Total cash receipts from debtors and cash sales 153,000 Total debtors c/f 6,800 Dr. Total Debtors Account Cr.

In either case, there is a deviation from the double entry principle.
The situations make it difficult or impossible to produce a trial balance or draw up the final accounts at the end of a period.
The task of the accountant, given the situations, is to explore all possible avenues to obtain information in order to create something out of nothing.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have discussed “Accounts from incomplete records” that denotes deviation from the accounting records which are kept on the complete principle of double entry.
We have considered situations where no records are kept and where partial records are maintained with emphasis on the job of the account to attempt to make good the situations.

We established that these reports assist the management and other interested users like the investors, analysts, creditors, to take appropriate financial decisions.
Therefore, financial statements are prepared not as an end in themselves but in order that users can make decisions.
To be very useful in this regard, financial statements need to be analysed and interpreted, so that the relationships between different parts of the reports will be more clearly seen.
In the analysis of financial statements, we have to recognise that the different users of financial information have different needs, for example:  Management needs information for control of costs and improved profitability;  Lenders need information for borrowing and credit purposes;  Shareholders and investment analysts require financial information to make investment decisions – buying and selling of shares, etc.
Bearing in mind that the relevance of financial analysis cannot be overemphasised, this unit will attempt to answer the following questions:  What is the usefulness of financial analysis?
123 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  What are the ways in which accounting reports can be analysed and made more meaningful to the users?
As managers at different levels and areas of calling, we need to have adequate information to be guided or aided in taking appropriate financial decisions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: - Discuss the usefulness of financial analysis; - Demonstrate the use of ratios in the analysis of financial statements.
3.0 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.1 Usefulness of Financial Analysis Financial analysis may be simply defined as knowing what to look for and how to interpret it.
The information gathered by calculating ratios will allow comparisons with:  the performance of the business in previous years;  the budgeted or planned performance in the current year;  the performance of similar businesses.
More specifically, financial analysis will be useful to the users in the light of the following:  Since the shareholders and potential shareholders will be interested in its profitability, it will aid them in measuring the returns on their investment in equity;  It will also aid the shareholders to establish the financial stability of the company in order to assess the risk attached to their investment;  Financial analysis will aid the suppliers of short-term credit (bank overdraft or supply of goods on credit) to assess the ability of the company to pay its debt promptly;  Suppliers of long-term credit (such as mortgage bonds and debentures) will be better guided in assessing the company‟s ability to meet its annual interest obligations as well as its ability to repay the debt; 124 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  Management is assisted in taking decisions that make for efficient and effective operations in order to maximise the wealth of the shareholders and ensure continued operations.
Apart from the ratios, it is essential that the following factors about the organisation‟s environment should be analysed: - Markets in which the concern functions; - General economic conditions; - Size of business in relation to competitors.
Self-Assessed Exercise How useful is the analysis of financial statements?
3.2 Ratio Analysis Undoubtedly, ratio analysis is the most popular of all analytical techniques.
It may be defined as the selection of two line items which have a meaningful relationship and expressing that relationship as a ratio.
In ratio analysis, the principle of factor relationship covers a wide range of items which could be of possible interest to the different users of accounting information.
Thus, ratio analysis yields percentage or other coefficients of the relationships between any two accounting factors once some closeness is exhibited by the two factors.
For example, profit may be related to turnover or equity funds or total long-term funds (capital employed); turnover may be related to inventory or trade debtors; fixed assets may be related to long-term funds; current assets related to current liabilities, etc.
Ratio analysis attempts to determine some notion of the standard relationship which ought to exist between any two factors, and to interpret the specific relationship in anyone form in terms of the extent to which the firm attains to that standard.
The attainment of that standard would be interpreted as good performance or healthy financial condition or otherwise.
The following considerations, therefore, can be made in the analysis of ratio:  If a ratio has been computed over a number of time periods, does it show a worsening or an improving situation?
 Can the ratio be compared to an objective standard?
That is, can it be compared with an „ideal‟ ratio?
125 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  Do all the ratios when taken together support the conclusions drawn from each individual ratio?
Ratios can be classified variously, but we shall adopt the below:  Profitability Ratios i.
Gross profit and net profit margin ii.
Returns on assets managed iii.
Returns on capital employed (ROCE) iv.
Returns on equity (ROE)  Liquidity Ratios v. Current ratio vi.
Quick (or acid test) ratio  Leverage Ratios vii.
Debt ratio viii.
Capital gearing ix.
Times interest covered  Activity Ratios x.
Total assets turnover xi.
Stock turnover xii.
Sales to debtors xiii.
Average collection period  Investment Ratios xiv.
Earnings yield xv.
Dividend yield xvi.
Price – earning multiple We shall explain all the ratios with examples: 1.
Gross Profit and Net Profit margin: The gross profit margin is the ratio of gross profit to sales while the net profit margin is the ratio of net profit to sales.
The former seeks to highlight the aggregate impact of the firm‟s mark-up or pricing policy, and the latter aims to evaluate the overall efficiency of the firm in its buying and selling operations.
They are calculated as follows: o Gross profit margin = Gross profit Sales o Net profit margin = Net profit Sales 126 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 2.
Return on Assets Managed (ROAM): ROAM = Net profit before interest Total sales Here, profit is seen as a function of the size of total assets at the disposal of management for operating the business.
A large amount of assets is expected to generate more profits than a smaller volume of assets.
3.
Return on Capital Employed: ROCE = Net profit + Interest on long-term loan Total long-term funds Capital employed means all the long-term funds invested in the business – equity (share capital, reserves, profit balance), preference capital and debentures or loan stock.
4.
Return on Equity: ROE = Net profit after tax Total equity funds The equity funds in a business represent the book value of the total investment by the shareholders.
The net profit after tax, on the other hand, represents to the shareholders, the total surplus generated by their investment.
For equity holders, the efficiency with which their funds are employed is reflected by the ratio of net profit after tax to the total equity funds.
5.
Current Ratio: CR = Current assets Current liabilities Current ratio is a relationship between total assets and total liabilities.
It is also a relationship between funds due and funds owed.
It indicates the ability of the firm to meet its short-term obligations as at when due.
A low ratio indicates the inability of a firm to pay its bills as at when due.
A high ratio, on the other hand, may indicate an excessive amount of current assets and the inability of management to effectively utilize the firm‟s resources.
Depending on the business of the firm, a ratio of 2:1 is recommended.
127 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 6.
Quick (or Acid test) Ratio: QR = Total current assets – Inventory Total current liabilities This is a more stringent measure of a firm‟s liquidity position because the least liquid current assets (inventory) is excluded in the computation.
A lower quick ratio is an indication of the inability of the firm to meet its short-term obligations while a higher ratio represents ineffectiveness in the management of the firm‟s resources.
A ratio of 1:1 is normal.
7.
Debt Ratio: Debt Ratio = Total debts Total assets This ratio measures the proportion of the firm‟s total assets that are paid for by debt.
Long-term lenders use this ratio to assess the extent to which their funds are exposed to risk.
A debt ratio of 50% would imply that creditors have financed half of the assets, and this can be the limit to which lenders would be prepared to lend money to the firm without charging a risk premium.
8.
Capital Gearing Ratio: CGR = Long term loan : Total Equity funds This ratio helps to measure the degree of financing risk.
Generally, equity holders gear their investment in the business, that is, employ long-term loans to support their own funds.
A gearing of 1:1 means that long-term lenders have provided one naira for every one naira equity funds.
9.
Times Interest Covered: TIC = Net profit + Interest Interest This means the number of times that the total interest burden is covered by the total net profit before interest and taxes.
This ratio measures the likelihood of default in interest 128 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING payment.
A high ratio is an evidence of financial strength and is preferred.
10.
Total Assets Turnover: TAT = Sales Total assets This is a ratio of sales to total assets.
The number of times that total sales are turned over is a measure of the effectiveness in the use of the firm‟s assets.
A high turnover is a measure of success.
11.
Stock Turnover: ST = Cost of Sales Average stock This is the ratio of cost of sales to average stock.
12.
Sales to Debtors: Sales to Debtors = Sales Debtors This ratio measures the extent to which the credit sales policy may have contributed to the total sales of the firm.
A high sale-to-debtors ratio suggests an effective credit control policy.
13.
Average Collection Period: ACP = Debtors days Average sales per day Here, average sales per day is the year‟s turnover divided by 360 days.
This ratio measures the effectiveness of the firm‟s credit control function.
A preferred ratio should represent a smaller number of days‟ sales.
14.
Earnings Yield: EY = Earnings per share x 100 Market price of share 1 Where EPS = Net profit after tax 129 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Number of shares outstanding This ratio is a measure of the company‟s efficiency in the use of shareholders‟ capital.
15. Dividend Yield: DY = Dividend per share Market price of share Where DPS = Dividend for the year No.
of shares outstanding Dividend is significant to shareholders because it is the portion of total earnings which they actually receive, the remainder being retained within the business.
It is believed that DYR provides a realistic alternative to Earnings Yield as basis for comparing the potential return from alternative investments.
16.
Price – Earnings Multiple: P – E M = Market price per share Earnings per share This ratio is the mechanism through which a certain measure of standardisation or equilibrium is introduced among the prices of shares of similar risk-return characteristics.
Example: Below are the financial statements of UJAH Trading Company Limited.
You are required to compute the financial ratios, tabulate and compare them.
Assume that the shares in question have a nominal value of N1.00 each and that the shares are currently quoted in the stock market at a price of N1.50.
The same share was sold at a price of N1.45 just after the accounts were published the previous year.

(c) Return on assets managed = Net profit before interest * Total assets 1996 = 82,000 + 8,000 363,000 + 287,000 = 90,000 = 13.8% 650,000 1995 = 58,000 + 10,000 260,000 + 226,000 = 68,000 = 14.0% 486,000  In the absence of information about the interest cost paid on bank overdraft, the item is excluded from this computation.
(d) Return on capital employed = Net profit + interest on long-term loan Total long-term funds 1996 = 82,000 + 8,000 = 17.8% 505,000 1995 = 58,000 + 10,000 = 18.5% 368,000 (e) Return on equity = Net profit after tax Total equity funds 1996 = 82,000 – 18,000 = 15% 425,000 1995 = 58,000 – 12,000 = 17.2% 268,000 133 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (2) Liquidity Ratios: (a) Current Ratio = current assets current liabilities 1996 = 287,000 = 1.98 : 1 145,000 1995 = 226,000 = 1.91 : 1 118,000 (b) Quick asset ratio = current assets – stocks current liabilities 1996 = 287,000 – 67,000 – 90,000 145,000 = 130,000 = 0.9 : 1 145,000 1995 = 226,000 – 46,000 – 70,000 118,000 = 110,000 = 0.93 : 1 118,000 (3) Leverage Ratios: (a) Debt Ratio = total debts total assets or current liabilities + long-term loan total assets 1996 = 145,000 + 80,000 = 34.6% 650,000 1995 = 118,000 + 100,000 = 37.2% 586,000 (b) Capital gearing ratio = long-term loan : total equity funds 1996 = 80,000 : 425,000 = 0.2 : 1 1995 = 100,000 : 268,000 = 0.37 : 1 134 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (c) Times interest covered = net profit + interest interest 1996 = 82,000 + 8000 8,000 = 90,000 = 11.25 times 8,000 1995 = 58,000 + 10000 10,000 = 68,000 = 6.8 times 10,000 (4) Activity Ratios: (a) Total asset turnover = sales total assets 1996 = 1,840,000 = 2.83 times 650,000 1995 = 1,444,000 = 2.97 times 486,000 (b) Stock turnover = cost of sales average stock 1996 = 1,411,000 116,000 + 157,000 2 = 1,411,000 = 10.3 times 136,500 1995 = 1,083,000 90,000 + 116,000 2 = 1,083,000 = 10.5 times 103,000 (c) Sales to debtors = sales debtors 135 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 1996 = 1,840,000 = 16.7 times 110,000 1995 = 1,444,000 = 18 times 80,000 (d) Average collection period = debtors average sales per day 1996 = 110,000 1,840,000 365 = 110,000 = 22 days 5,041 1995 = 80,000 1,444,000 365 = 80,000 = 21 days 3,956 (5) Investment Ratios: (a) Earnings yield = earnings per share x 100 market price of share 1 where earnings per share (EPS) = net profit after tax number of shares outstanding 1996 : EPS = 64,000 = 21.3 k 300,000  Earnings yield = 21.3k x 100% N1.50 = 14.2% 1995 : EPS = 40,000 = 20 k 200,000  Earnings yield = 20k x 100% N1.45 = 13.8% 136 BHM 624 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (b) Dividend yield = dividend per share market price of share where dividend per share = dividend for the year number of shares outstanding 1996 Dividend per share = 30,000 = 10k 300,000  Earnings yield = 10k x 100% N1.50 = 6.7% 1995 Dividend per share = 20,000 = 10k 200,000  Earnings yield = 10k x 100% N1.45 = 7% (c) Price earnings multiple = market price per share earnings per share 1996 = N1.50 = 7 times 21.3k 1995 = N1.45 = 7.25 times 20k Summary of Financial Ratios Computed from the Accounts of UJAH Trading Company Limited 1996 1995 1.

Name two each of the following ratios, state their formula for computation and explain what they measure: (a) Activity ratios (b) Leverage ratios (c) Profitability ratios (d) Liquidity ratios 4.0 CONCLUSION Since financial statements are prepared in order that users can make decisions, they have to be analysed and interpreted so that they can be useful in this regard.
Ratio analysis appears to be the most popular of all analytical tools.
It selects two accounting items which have a meaningful relationship and expresses that relationship as a ratio.
Ratio analysis is used to assess the overall performance of the firm.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have considered the usefulness of financial statements analysis as well as the ways in which accounting reports can be analysed and made more meaningful to the users.
Ratio analysis has been dealt with extensively.
