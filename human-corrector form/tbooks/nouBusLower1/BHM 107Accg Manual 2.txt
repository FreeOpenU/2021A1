In order to give the actual results of the year’s operations and to ensure that the balance sheet gives a true and fair view of the financial position, these transactions need to be adjustably incorporated into the final accounts for them to give a correct picture of the financial position of the reporting entity, as at the period ended.
This Unit shall discuss these adjustments to be made, why and how.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: prepaid and accrued expenses income received in advance and Income due to accrue other relevant issues.
BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.0 MAN CONTENT 3.1 Accruals and Prepayments 3.2 Expenses These are amounts incurred for the purpose of earning an income.
Expenses are written off to the income statement in line with the principles of cause and effect.
However, there are times when such expenses are either not paid in full or the amount paid for exceeds the current accounting period of the receiving business.
These instances are discussed below: 3.2.1 Prepaid Expenses These are payments made in respect of a period beyond the date of account.
It is in the nature of an asset; that is, the benefit of the expenditure is still to be derived.
The portion which relates to the current period is transferred to the profit and loss and the balance which relates to the future period is shown under the current asset in the balance sheet.
3.2.2 Accrued Expenses This occurs where an expense has been incurred but not brought into the account as a result of it not being paid for.
The amount of expenses shown in the ledger must be increased to allow for the expenses due but not yet entered.
The accrued expenses are shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities at the end of the period.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Why is prepaid expense an asset item?
2.
How is an accrued expense treated in the balance sheet?
3.3 Incomes These are proceeds realized from transacting business.
Incomes are the primary aim of being in business without which survival becomes difficult.
Some incomes are often received in advance such as rental income while some are paid after being due.
The adjustments required in either of the scenario mentioned are discussed below: 3.3.1 Income in Advance 2  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This is where sums have been received during a period in respect of future services.
Only part of such sums which relates to the current period is transferred to the profit and loss account as earned income, while the portion relating to future period is shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities.
3.3.2 Income Due These are incomes which are due but not yet received at the trial balance date.
The amount of income shown in the ledger must be increased to allow for income due but not yet entered.
The income accrued is shown in the balance sheet under current asset at the end of the period.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.

7  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II UNIT 2 PROVISIONS FOR BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBTS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debts 3.2 Bad Debts 3.3 Doubtful Debts 3.4 Provisions 3.5 Drawings 3.6 Stock 3.7 Illustrative Examples 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Once a business decides to sale its goods or services on credit, it is bound to have three types of debtors: good, doubtful and bad.
Good debtors are the dream of any business, since they are those debtors that are guided by their conscience and honor; as they buy on credit, they are determined to pay back on or before the maturity date.
Doubtful debtors need some incentive/motivation before they effect payment on purchases made on credit, while bad debtors need to be written off the accounts when confirmed to be such!
This Unit attempts an overview of these types of debtors and discusses how they are to be treated in the books of accounts of any serious business organization.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: appreciate the type of debtors a business may have in its accounts adjust for bad and doubtful debtors in the books of accounts adjust for drawings made by a business proprietor treat for stock value in the final accounts.
8  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Provisions for Bad and Doubtful Debts 3.2 Bad Debts These are debts which are found to be irrecoverable.
If detected before drafting the trial balance, they should simply be posted as expenses to the profit and loss account and no more.
But where such losses are detected after drafting the trial balance, the amount so detected is posted as an expense to the profit and loss account and deducted from the debtors balance in the balance sheet.
DR: Bad Debt Account CR: Debtor’s Account The bad debt account is to be closed to the profit and loss account, as an expense.
Where a debt already written off as bad is recovered in whole or in part in subsequent period, the entries required are: DR: Cash/Bank Account CR: Bad Debt Recovered Account The bad debt recovered account is to be closed to the profit and loss account, as a gain.
3.3 Doubtful Debts These are debts on which the creditor is uncertain as to their recoverability.
The debtor might be willing but unable to pay, or able but unwilling to pay as on the maturity date.
To be prudent, an estimate is to be made on the percentage value of such debtors and provision made against them out of the expected profit of the business.
The amount provided is to be deducted from the total value of debtors and charged to the profit and loss account.
3.3 Provision This refers to the commitment made out of profit on the likely diminutions in the value of an asset or for any known liability for which the amount involved cannot be determined with substantial accuracy.
9  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Provisions commonly found in the profit and loss account of a business are: i.
Provision for doubtful debt; ii.
Provision for discount on debtors; and iii.
Provision for depreciation.
Under this heading we shall discuss I and II only as III would be adequately discussed in Unit 4. a) Provisions for Doubtful Debts This is provision made out of profit to meet debt which is likely to turn bad.
It is usually provided for after all debt which is known to be irrecoverable has been written off.
A provision for doubtful debt may be calculated either by: i) Reference to the amount of the specific debt (specific provision for bad debt); ii) As a percentage of the total debt outstanding after deducting irrecoverable one (general provision for doubtful debt).
In practice, the percentage most likely to turn bad is arrived at based on the debtor(s) history.
This percentage therefore constitutes the rate which shall be used in providing for doubtful debts and those not fluctuating widely.
The Accounting entries required for recording provisions for doubtful debts are: DR: Bad debt account CR: Provision for doubtful debts account To create provisions for doubtful debts; bad debt account is to be closed to the profit and loss account, while provision for doubtful debt account is to be closed to the balance sheet.
DR: Provision for doubtful debts account CR: Profit and loss account With a decrease in the provision for doubtful debts The provision for doubtful debts (closing balance) is deducted from the debtors balance in the balance sheet to ascertain the net good debtors.
b) Provision for discount on debtors 10  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This provision is allowed on good debtors and it is usually based on a fixed percentage of good debtors i.e.
debtors less bad debt less provision for doubtful debts.
The account is provided in a similar manner as that of provision for doubtful debts.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Discuss the term Provision for Doubtful debt.
2.
Describe the entries to be made in Provision for discount account.
3.4 Drawings The effect of drawings by the owner of a business for personal use is to decrease the capital invested in it.
Drawings may be made in cash or in the form of goods and services.
Drawings made in cash required a credit entry in the bank account and debit entry in the drawings account.
If drawings are made in the form of goods purchased by the business for resale, then Drawings account is debited and sales account credited with the value of goods withdrawn.
The balance of the drawings account is subsequently closed at the end of the year and deducted from the capital.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss the concept of drawings in accounting.
2.
Describe two ways through which drawings would decrease capital.
3.5 Stock The usual practice in accounting is to value the goods at the lower of cost or current market price (i.e.
net realizable value).
This means that the closing stock of goods should not be valued above the original price paid, but if the current price is lower than original price, the current price should be taken as the valuation basis.

The process of spreading the cost is referred to as depreciation, which shall be the focus of our discussion in this Unit.
A number of methods of providing for depreciation would be discussed, giving illustrative examples.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: define Depreciation appreciate various methods of providing for depreciation understand how to compute depreciation on an asset acquired during the year maintain accounting records for depreciation.
18  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1Depreciation Methods 3.2 Definition of Depreciation Depreciation may be defined as the permanent and continuing diminution in the quality, quantity or value of a fixed asset.
Depreciation is therefore the proportion of the cost of an asset that is deducted from revenue for assets services used in the operation of a business.
Depreciation is simply about decrease in the value of a fixed asset, as a result of wear and tear, passage of time, heat of sun, etc.
However, there are other terms used in defining depreciation.
These terms are “depletion” and “amortization’.
Depletion refers to the depreciation of an available but irreplaceable resource such as extraction of coal from coal mine or oil out of an oil well.
Amortization, on the other hand, refers to the writing off of an obligation like loan.
The basic differences between depreciation and these other concepts is that depreciation is used to refer to the process of charging the cost of man- made fixed assets to operations whereas depletion refers to the cost allocations of natural resources such as oil and mineral deposits while amortization relates to cost allocation for intangible assets such as patents and copyrights.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What do you understand by the concept of depreciation?
2.
Discuss any two other concepts related to depreciation.
3.3 Methods of Computing Depreciation There are numerous methods of computing depreciation, broadly grouped into the following: 1.
Uniform charge methods: i.
Fixed installments method; ii.
Depletion method; iii.
Machine hour rate method.
2.
Declining charge methods: 19  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II i.
Diminishing balance method; ii.
Sum of the years’ digit method; iii.
Double declining method.
3.
Other Methods: i.
Group depreciation method; ii.
Inventory or revaluation method; iii.
Annuity method; iv.
Sinking fund method; and v. Insurance policy method.
For the purpose of this course, we shall restrict our discussion to the fixed installment, diminishing balance method, sum of the years’ digit and inventory methods.
3.2.1 Fixed Installments Method This is also termed as Straight line method.
Under this method, depreciation is charged evenly every year throughout the effective life of an asset.
Depreciation is calculated as: Depreciation = C-S N Where C: Original cost of the Asset; S: Estimated Scrap Value; and N: Effective life of the Asset.
The depreciation to be charged each year can also be expressed as a percentage of cost.
This percentage can be calculated as follows: R = D * 100 DV Where R: Rate of depreciation; D: Depreciation computed; and DV: Depreciable Value i.e.
cost less scrap value.
Example 1 Baba ‘Yargo acquired a Motor Vehicle for N10, 000.
The vehicle was planned to be used in the business for four years and its scraped value estimated for N2, 000.
Calculate the annual depreciation charge and the rate.
Solution Annual Depreciation = C- S N 20  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II =N0,000 – N2,000 4 = N2, 000 Depreciation Rate = D * 100 DV N,000 * 100 N8,000 25% 3.2.2 Diminishing Balance Method This method is also termed as reducing balance method.
Under this method, depreciation is computed as a fixed percentage of the book value of an asset.
The book value of an asset is the difference between the cost of the asset and the accumulated depreciation on the asset.
Depreciation is calculated as: Depreciation = R * NBV Where R: Rate of depreciation; and NBV: Net book value.
Depreciation rate (R) = {1 - n√ Net residual value} * 100 Cost Where n: number of expected life of the asset.
Example 2 Alh.
Ado purchased an item of office fittings for N1, 296 on 1st Jan. 2001.
The balance at 31st December 2001 was N1, 100.
At 31st December 2002 and 2003, the residual value of the asset was N850 and N625 respectively.
Calculate the depreciation charge for 2001, 2002 & 2003.
Solution: Depreciation = R* NBV R = S = N625, C = N1, 296 n = 3 R = 3√ ₦625 ₦1296 21  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 25 * 100 36 3.2.3 Sum of the Years’ Digits Method The amount of depreciation to be charged to the profit and loss account under this method goes on decreasing every year.
The depreciation is calculated based on the following formula: Remaining Life of the Asset (including the current year) * Original Cost Sum of all the digits of the life of the asset in years 1 Example 3 Use the above example to calculate the amount of depreciation using the sum of the years’ digits method.
Solution: Depreciation for 2001 3/6 * (N1,296- N625) = N 336 Depreciation for 2002 2/6 * (N1,296- N625) = N 224 Depreciation for 2003 1/6 * (N1,296- N625) = N 111 3.2.4 Inventory System of Depreciation This method is mainly used for those assets with relatively small values such as loose tools or where the life of the assets cannot be ascertained with certainty e.g.
live stock etc.
Under this method, depreciation is calculated using the following basis: N Cost of assets purchased at the beginning accounting year x Add: cost of the assets purchased during the accounting Year x Less: cost of the assets at the end of the accounting year Depreciation charged x Example 4 Refer to the question in example 2 above.
Compute depreciation using the revaluation method.
Solution: Depreciation for 2001: N Opening Balance of Office fittings 1,296 Less: Closing Balance at 31 December 2001 1,100 Depreciation for the year 196 22  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Depreciation for 2002: Balance at 1st January 2002 1,100 Less: Closing Balance at 31 December 2002 850 Depreciation for the year 250 Depreciation for 2003: Balance at 1st January 2003 850 Balance at 31 December 2003 625 Depreciation for the year 225 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss Straight Line Method of providing for depreciation.
2.
Differentiate between the Diminishing Balance Method and the Sum of the Years’ Digit Method of providing for depreciation.
3.3 Depreciation on an Asset Acquired during the Year There are two alternatives available regarding charging of depreciation on an asset which has been acquired during the course of an accounting year: a) Depreciation may be charged for the full year irrespective of the date of purchase at the given rate.
b) Depreciation may be charged only for the part of the year for which the asset has been made available for use as a result of it being acquired during the year.
Students should note that where instruction as to the computation of depreciation on asset acquired during the year is not clearly given; assumption made should be stated categorically.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1) Differentiate between the two alternatives available regarding charging of depreciation on a newly acquired fixed asset.
2) Why must assumption be made categorically on depreciation accounting treatment?
4.0 CONCLUSION This Unit is basically about the popular methods of computing depreciation that were emphasized on in the Statement of Accounting Standard (SAS) 9 issued by the Nigerian Accounting Standard Board (NASB).
Illustrative examples were provided to make students 23  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II understand how the methods are used in computing depreciation to be charged to the profit and loss account.
5.0 SUMMARY In this Unit, we have defined depreciation and discussed methods of providing for depreciation.
Alternative ways of charging depreciation on newly acquired assets were highlighted.
All the major SAS 9 methods of providing for depreciation were discussed and exemplified for the clear understanding of the students.

The Unit also discusses causes of depreciation and how to account for fixed assets disposal in the books of accounts.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: explain causes of depreciation compute depreciation for different categories of fixed assets maintain accounting records for depreciation appreciate how to treat depreciation in the books of accounts.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1Accounting for Depreciation 3.2 Causes of Depreciation Assets get depreciated as a result of some factors which are discussed below: 26  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 1.
Wear and Tear: Constant use of fixed assets gets the asset worn or torn.
Examples of these assets are plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, etc.
2.
Exhaustion: An asset may get exhausted through utilization.
This is the case with mineral mines, oil wells, etc.
3.
Obsolescence: Some assets are discarded before they are worn out as a result of improvement in technology.
Such loss as a result of new innovations is referred to as loss on account of obsolescence.
4.
Efflux of Time: Certain assets get depreciated in their value with the passage of time.
This is the case with leasehold properties, patents and copy rights.
5.
Accidents: An asset may meet an accident and, therefore, it may get depreciated in its value.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Define asset in the context of this Unit.
2.
Discuss any three causes of depreciation.
3.2 Methods of Recording Depreciation Depreciation can be recorded in the books of account using two different methods: 1.
Provision for Depreciation Account Method Under this method of accounting for depreciation, the amount of depreciation to be charged is debited to the profit and loss account and credited to the provision for depreciation account.
The asset account appears at original cost.
2.
Depreciation Account Method Under this method, the amount of depreciation is debited to the depreciation account and credited to the assets account.
The asset account thus appears at net book value.
The depreciation account is closed to the profit and loss account like any other item of expense.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Why is depreciation account an expense account?
2.
Differentiate between the two methods of recording depreciation.
27  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.3 Disposal of Fixed Asset Where a fixed asset is disposed, the amount realized from the sale of the asset should be credited to the Disposal account (if provision for depreciation account method is in use) or Asset account (if depreciation account method is in use).
Depreciation for the period for which the asset has been used should be written off in the usual manner.
Any balance in the Asset Disposal Account representing profit or loss on sale of the asset should be transferred to the Profit and Loss Account.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.

Correct amount of profit/loss can only be ascertained if all expenditures (recurrent and capital) that provide the income are fully accounted for in the relevant sections of the final accounts.
5.0 SUMMARY In this Unit, we have discussed causes of depreciation, methods of recording depreciation into the books of accounts and the accounting treatment of disposal fixed asset.
Of note is that, depreciation is not charged for the purpose of replacing fixed asset, but as a means of charging the fair share of the asset cost to the profit and loss account, to show its extent of utilization in the course of generating income for the reporting entity.

In many enterprises, these assets are grouped into various categories such as land and buildings, plant and machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures and fittings, vehicles, etc.
This Unit deals with the introductionary aspects of accounting for fixed assets and related issues.
2.0OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: appreciate the concept of fixed assets understand ways of accounting for fixed assets differentiate between leased and owned fixed assets appreciate the need to provide for fixed assets depreciation.
34  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.0MAIN CONTENT 3.1Accounting for Fixed Asset 3.2Relevant Concepts Surrounding Fixed Asset Fixed assets are tangible assets that have been acquired or constructed and held for use in the production or supply of goods and services and may include those held for maintenance or repair of such assets; and are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of business.
Leasehold rights over assets which meet the above criteria may also be treated as property, plant and equipment in certain circumstances.
The fair value of a fixed asset is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction, while its net book value is the amount at which an asset is carried in the books less the related accumulated depreciation.
The useful life of a fixed asset is the shorter of (a) the predetermined physical life and (b) the economic life during which it could be profitably employed in the operations of the enterprise.
The recoverable amount of a fixed asset is that part of the net book value of a fixed asset that an enterprise can recover in the future through depreciation of the item including its net realizable value on disposal.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What do you understand by the term fixed asset?
2.
Differentiate between Leasehold and Freehold fixed asset.
3.3 Valuation of Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated in the financial statements of reporting entities at cost (usually historical cost) or valuation less accumulated depreciation.
The cost is normally a combination of purchase price and other expenses, including installation expense, up to the stage of usage of the assets.
Fixed assets on lease are accounted for strictly in accordance with their legal form as fixed assets.
The relevant assets are purchased in the name of an enterprise and subsequently leased to customers as operating leases.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Why is fixed asset cost a combination of two or more variables?
2.
What is legal form?
35  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.4 Depreciation Policy of Fixed Assets Depreciation charged on fixed assets is usually calculated by most businesses on the straight-line basis to write off their costs over their estimated useful lives at different annual rates.
For example, the following annual rates could be applied by an enterprise in providing for depreciation of its fixed assets: Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold buildings and improvements: 50years and over 2% Below 50 years over the term of the lease Assets on lease over the term of the lease: Motor vehicles 25% Furniture and fittings 20% Machinery and equipment 20% Computer equipment 20% It should be noted that no depreciation is charged on fixed assets until they are put into use.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
Describe depreciation policy of an organization.
2.
Why are most businesses using straight-line basis of providing for depreciation?
3.5 Methods of Recognizing Fixed Assets and Liabilities Assets are resources controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.
Liabilities, on the other hand, represent obligations of the enterprise arising from past events, settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the enterprise of resources embodying economic benefits.
For the purpose of recognizing assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, IAS 5 provides recognition: a) When there is probability that a future inflow or outflow of benefit to or from the entity will occur; and b) When the asset or liability can be measured as a monetary amount with sufficient reliability.
36  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II In circumstances where legal principles contradict the financial realities of a transaction, the substance of the transaction should be accounted for while its legal principles are ignored.
Accountants are often faced with this conflict in certain transactions such as: 3.5.1 Sale and Repurchase Agreement These arrangements occur where an asset is sold by the seller to a buyer on terms that the seller repurchases the asset from the buyer at a future date.
This transaction has two possible interpretation of either a secured loan or a sale-lease back.
If the arrangements provide that the seller retains right to determine asset’s use while the buyer only receives return (secured loan) the asset will only be recognized in the books of the seller.
The transfer of title by way of purchase is ignored.
3.5.2 Finance Lease Arrangement Where the transaction resembles a finance leasing arrangements i.e.
the ownership title passes to the buyer, the assets shall be recorded as that of the buyer.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 1.
What are the IAS 5 provisions for recognizing assets and liabilities?
2.
Differentiate between purchase of asset and its lease.
3.6 Cost of Self-Constructed Fixed Asset Enterprises sometimes self-construct some fixed assets for their own use, usually to save costs, meet unique specification or utilize idle capacity.
The cost elements of self-constructed fixed assets are costs of materials, labor and overheads that are directly attributable to the construction less any trade discounts, rebates or internal profits.
Interest costs which are attributable to the period of constructing the item of fixed asset are sometimes added to its cost.
Other costs, including cost of inefficiency in production of self-constructed items of fixed assets such as the idle capacity, industrial disputes and similar costs, are expensed in the period in which they arise.
3.7 Components of Fixed Asset Cost 37  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II SAS 3 provides that the cost of an item of fixed asset comprises: its purchase price, including import and non-recurring levies (e.g.
development levies, consent fee, etc) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its location and working condition for its intended use.
Any trade discount and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 5 1.
Discuss the process of determining self-constructed fixed asset cost.
2.
Comment on SAS 3 provision on composition of fixed asset cost.
3.8 Illustrative Examples Illustration One The elements of cost for Land and its Improvements: (a) Original purchase price (b) Broker’s or Estate Agent’s commission (c) Legal fees for examining, recording and securing title (d) Cost of survey (e) Cost of obtaining vacant possession (f) Payment of non-recurring levies on the land at date of purchase if payable by the purchaser.
Cost of demolishing any old structure (net of salvage) is sometimes added to the cost of land and sometimes to the cost of the building on the site.
Some additional costs may be incurred subsequent to purchase in order to improve the land for the intended purpose.
Such costs, which are often capitalized, include the following: (i) Filling and draining (ii) Clearing (iii) Landscaping (iv) Grading and sub-dividing (v) Access road, etc Illustration Two 38  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II The elements of cost for Buildings: (a) Original purchase price or cost of construction.
(b) Cost of remodeling, reconditioning, or altering a building to render it suitable for its intended use.
(c) Cost of excavating or filling of land for the specific building.
(d) Foundation costs such as rock blasting, piling and rechanneling of canal or underground stream.
(e) Cost of building permits.
(f) Payment of development levies on the building at the date of purchase if payable by the purchaser.
(g) Professional fees for design, supervision and management of the construction.
(h) Cost of temporary buildings used during the construction period less disposal proceeds.
The cost of ancillary building plants such as lifts and air-conditioning systems, etc, are sometimes recorded separately from the cost of the building.
Illustration Three The elements of cost for Plant and Equipment: (a) Original purchase price or cost of construction.
(b) Freight, import duties and handling charges.
(c) In-transit insurance charges.
(d) Taxes and levies.
(e) Cost of preparation of foundations, insulations, protective and other special devices.
(f) Commissioning, including testing and running-in costs in preparation for use.
(g) If the item is a second-hand one, the cost of refurbishing it for the intended use.
4.0 CONCLUSION Fixed assets constitute a great percentage of the total assets value of business enterprises, especially manufacturing businesses.
The value of each item of fixed asset needs to be determined as critically as possible so that the asset is not over-valued or under-valued.
Fixed assets are subject to wear and tear, passage of time and other reasons why fixed assets’ value would depreciate.
The depreciation expense has to be determined and deducted from the book value of the asset with a view to ascertaining the net book value of the asset at any given time.
This Unit 39  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II is an attempt at highlighting all these issues in an introductory way for the students to achieve the objectives set above.
5.0 SUMMARY This Unit has discussed the concept of fixed assets and related issues, valuation of fixed assets, depreciation policy and how it is determined, components of fixed asset costs and cost of self-constructed fixed assets.

This Unit will enable you to learn the preparation of final accounts from incomplete records.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: define incomplete records and appreciate their disadvantages understand the indication of incomplete records determine profit of a business from incomplete sets of records prepare final accounts from sets of incomplete records.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 41  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.1 Final Accounts from Incomplete Records 3.1.1 Meaning of Incomplete Records An incomplete record is any system of records which are kept not in complete compliance with double entry principles.
The level of incompleteness of the records varies from having double entry in respect of certain transactions to no entry in respect of certain transactions.
The system, therefore, has the following disadvantages: i) Difficulty in ascertaining the arithmetical accuracy of records; ii) Difficulty in ascertaining the actual profit of a business; iii) Difficulty in determining the exact financial position of a business; iv) Difficulty in planning and decision making for the business’s future.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What do you understand by Incomplete Record?
2.
Discuss any two difficulties in using incomplete records.
3.2 Indication of Incomplete Records The following are the indications of incomplete records: a) Availability of Personal Accounts: In most incomplete records, personal accounts are usually kept to enable the business know how much it owes or owed by its customers.
The personal accounts are those of various debtors and creditors.
b) Reliance on Source Documents: In order to obtain adequate records of business transactions one has to rely on source documents such as invoices for purchases and sales, receipts, credit and debit note, etc.
c) Availability of Cash Book: Cash book is usually maintained which takes into account both the personal and business transactions.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss any two indications of incomplete records.
42  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 2.
Why is bank statement important in preparing final accounts for a business that keeps incomplete records?
3.3 Determination of Profit and Other Items of Final Accounts In determining the profit or loss of a business, one of the following approaches can be adopted: a) Net Worth Method: Under this method, the profit of the business is deemed to be the difference between the net worth at two different dates.
The date at the beginning and the date at the end of the period.
The net worth is often determined as the difference between assets and liabilities.
Some adjustments might be required when using this method, as follows: Drawing: This is considered as part of the closing capital of a business that was withdrawn for private use.
For the purpose of ensuring that a true profit figure is ascertained, drawing is added back to the closing capital in the profit statements.
Further Capital: Where in the course of a period, the proprietor introduced additional capital, this will make the capital at end to be higher than expected which might imply that a profit has been realized but it does not reflect profit per se.
Such capital is usually deducted from the closing capital in the profit statement.
b) Conversion Method: This method is applied when single entry records are maintained for certain transactions.
It enables detailed information of revenue and expenses of a business to be ascertained.
In using this method, certain figures are implied as discussed below: Sales: This can be determined where the opening and closing debtors’ figures are provided as well as receipts from debtors.
The balancing figures can be implied to be the sales value.
Purchases: This can be determined where the opening and closing figures for creditors are available and payments to suppliers are also given.
Cash and Bank Balances: These are determined by preparing a cash book.
Total of receipts is compared with the total of payments and the difference is implied to be cash in hand or at bank.
43  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Capital: This can be ascertained by comparing the opening assets and liabilities.
The difference, that is the excess of assets over liabilities, represents capital.
Accounting Ratios: Sometimes one has to rely on past ratios in determining key financial information.
Ratios that are to be used are mark-up, margin, stock turnover and net profit to sales.
These ratios help in the determination of sales, purchases, stock and expenses.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
Discuss the Net worth Method of Profit Determination.
2.
Illustrate how to determine any three key financial items of information using accounting ratios.

The number of persons, termed partners, who may form a partnership, is limited to 20 except (a) in the case of: (i) Solicitors; (ii) Accountants; (iii) Members of a recognized Stock Exchange, and (b) in the case of banking business where the limit is ten (10) except that the number may go up to 20 if each partner has bound of trade authorization.
This Unit discusses types of partners that could be found in partnership arrangements, partnership deeds, liabilities of partners, and advantages of partnership, types of partnership and partnership accounts to be maintained by a serious partnership business.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Partnership Final Accounts 3.1.1 Kind of Partners 3.1.1.1 Ordinary (or Active) Partner This is a partner who has capital in the business and takes part in conducting the affairs of the business.
54  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.1.1.2 Sleeping (or Dormant) Partners This is a partner who has capital in the firm (business).
Such a Partner is responsible for the debts of the firm as if he were an ordinary partner.
His name may or may not appear in the firm’s name.
3.1.1.3 Nominal (Apparent or Quasi) Partner This is a person who whilst not a partner in a partnership business, lends his name to the business.
Such a person is said to be holding out as a partner and is therefore liable as a partner for credit given to the firm, on the assumption that he was actually a member of the firm.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
How is a partner in a partnership business?
2.
Discuss any two types of partners.
3.2 Partnership Deeds/Article of Association When a partnership is to be formed, it is usual to draw up a legal document termed the deeds of partnership; although a partnership might be carried out by verbal agreement.
Partnership deeds/Article of Association should contain clauses relation to: 1) The firm’s name 2) The nature of the business.
3) The address (es) with which the business will be transacted.
4) The amount of capital to be contributed by each member and interest thereon (if any).
5) The sharing formula for the profit or loss of the partnership.
6) The commencement and duration of the partnership.
7) Partner (s) salaries or remuneration, if any.
8) Loan by partner(s) to the firm and interest thereon.
9) Drawing and interest thereon.
10)The keeping of proper books, preparation of final accounts and periodic audits.
11)The adjustment and repayment of capital to a retiring partner.
12)Arbitration, in order that any partnership’s dispute may be settled without litigation (going to law).
Section 24 of the partnership Act (1890) provides that in the absence of agreement by the partners to the contrary: 55  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 1.
Partners are to share profit and loss equally and contribute equal amount of capital.
2.
No interest is payable in respect of capital before the ascertainment of profit and no interest is to be charged on drawings.
3.
5% is to be paid to a partner who puts more money than the subscribed capital.
The payment will be on the excess.
4.
Any partner may take part in the management of the business.
But no partner is entitled to salary for his services.
5.
No partner may be introduced into the partnership without the consent of all the existing partners.
6.
The partnership books are to be kept at the place of business and every partner should have access to them.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss any 5 issues to be covered in a partnership agreement.
2.
Highlight any 3 provisions of partnership act.
3.3 Liability of Partners The partners are liable for all the debts of the firm.
In the event of partner’s capital not enough to save him or her, he or she has to go for his or her personal belongings.
The only exception to this is where there is the provision for limited partnership and unlimited partnership.
However, in coming partner is not liable to the debts of the firm but retiring partner is liable to the extent of the debts of the firm before his retirement.
3.4Advantages of Partnership 3.4.1 Large Capital Sole traders may combine resources together to form a partnership if the amount of capital required for the running of the type of business in mind cannot be provided by one person.
Persons looking for immediate and large profits might find it impossible because of lack of large capital.
To achieve their business goal; therefore, they have to bring together their capitals so as to make the large and immediate profit which they will share among themselves.
3.4.2 Experience and Ability The experience and ability required for the progress of a business and the achievement of its goal available with one of more investors should combined with the health, vitality and wealth available with other 56  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II investor(s) so as to establish a very successful partnership business.
A typical example is where an old man forms partnership with a young man so that the old man’s wealth of experience could be combined with the young man’s health and strength for a successful partnership business.
3.4.3 Share of Ownership Many people just prefer to share the care of ownership rather than bear all the burdens themselves.
Such people will therefore decide to form a partnership instead of operating a sole proprietorship.
3.4.4 Family Relationship By virtue of being members of same family, some sole traders prefer coming together and carrying on business activities as a family unit rather than operating differently.
This will strengthen the family relationship whereas separately operating the business may lead to competition or opposition between members of the family.
3.4.5 Continuity The continuity and enhancement of the business is more secured than in the case of single proprietorship.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
Describe the liabilities of retiring and incoming partners.
2.
Discuss any three advantages of a partnership business over a sole proprietorship business.
3.5 Types of Partnership There are basically two (2) types of partnership: Limited and Unlimited.
3.5.1 Unlimited partnership This is the partnership in which the partners are liable to all the debts of the business up to the extent of their personal properties.
This is when the partnership is indebted or insolvent.
The partners here must pay the debt even if it means selling their personal belongings like cars, houses, lands, etc in order to raise money for that purpose.
3.5.2 Limited Partnership 57  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This is the partnership in which some partners have a limited liability and other(s) unlimited liability.
Those with limited liability are liable only to the extent of the amount of capital they invested into the business if the business witnesses a failure.
This means that they loss only what they already invested into the business as nobody will force them to contribute any further amount for the purpose of repaying the debt of the partnership.
The unlimited partners, on the other hand, are liable to all the debts of the partnership up to the extent of their personal belongings when the business becomes insolvent.
A limited partner is registered under the provisions of the limited partnership Act (1907) and he may not take part in the management of the partnership business.
There must be at least one general (unlimited) partner in a limited partnership.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 1.
What are the characteristics of unlimited partnership?
2.
How limited is a limited partnership?
3.6 Partnership Accounts 3.6.1 Capital Account This is the account that records the partners’ capital contribution to the business.
There are as many capital accounts as there are partners.
There are two (2) ways of keeping the capital account: (1) fixed capital account and (2) fluctuating capital account.
The first method is the most acceptable one where the capital account is left intact and current account introduced in which fluctuations in the gains and obligations of partners in the business will be recorded.
The dimension of the account is like that of other accounts.
3.6.2 Drawing Account This is the account in which the drawings made by the partners are recorded.
It normally has a debit balance unlike Capital Account that has a credit balance.
3.6.3 Current Account This is the account in which the current earnings and drawings of partner’s are recorded, leaving capital account fixed.
On the right of it (credit side) are recorded (1) interest on capital, (2) partners salary, (3) share of profit, and (4) interest on loan.
On the left of it (debit side) are recorded (1) drawings, (2) interest on drawing, and (3) share of loss.
58  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.6.4 Salary Account This is the account that records the salaries paid to active partners for their management and control of the partnership business and of course their concentration for the day-day running of the affairs of the business, sacrificing other activities that can equally fetch them money.
This is credited to the current account and debited to the profit and loss appropriation account.
3.6.5 Interest on Capital Interest is sometimes charged on capital if the work to be done by each partner is of equal value but the capital contributed is unequal.
Also, if profit is to be shared equally, interest on capital has to be paid to compensate higher capital contributors.
This interest is paid out of the net profit for the year as part of appropriation.
It is, therefore, treated as a deduction prior to the calculation of the “super profit” and its distribution to the partners according to the profit/loss sharing ratio.
The rate of the interest is a matter for agreement between the partners.
But, theoretically, it should be equal to the return which the partners would have received had they invested the capital elsewhere.
3.6.6 Interest on Drawing Interest is sometime charged on drawings to deter the partners from taking out cash and other resources unnecessary.
The interest is calculated from the date of withdrawal to the end of the financial year.
The amount charged helps swell the profit divisible among the partners.
It is obviously in the best interest of the firm if cash is withdrawn by the partners in accordance with the two (2) basic principles of (a) as little as possible, and (b) as late as possible.
The more cash that is left in the firm, the more expansion can be financed.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 5 1.
Differentiate between current account and capital account in a partnership business.
2.
Differentiate between interest on capital and interest on drawing.

Interest on capital is based on the provision of Partnership Act provision that 5% interest, on excess capital, is to be paid to a partner who contributes amount in excess of the other(s).
The excess is to be treated as loan from the partner.
3.
Partner’s Salary has been paid already and, so is not to be included in the current account of the partner since he has collected the amount.
4.0CONCLUSION Partnership business is one of the three forms of businesses in any country of the world.
It is more popular among professionals and vocational men and women.
A partnership business is a source of income and not a unit of income, and so its profit is not taxable until it is shared amongst the partners.
The accounts of a partnership business are 65  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II similar to those of sole proprietorship and companies, in theory and practice, but there are specialized accounts that are normally kept by partnership businesses.
This Unit highlights all the fundamental issues students should know about partnership accounting.
5.0SUMMARY The Unit has introduced partnership business, the type of book keeping system to be put in place and the way to prepare final accounts of partnership businesses.

As it grows and prospers, it would experiences a lot of changes in its ownership, structure, financial position, etc.
Adjustment has to be made in the accounts of a partnership business when more person(s) is/are to be admitted as partners or when some partner(s) died or decided to retire from the partnership.
The Unit would address accounting treatments of the changes that are bound to occur as a partnership business grows or decline for whatever reason.
Issues bordering on admission, resignation/ retirement, death and conversion are to be subjected to accounting treatments in a partnership business.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 69  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II appreciate the accounting treatment on admission of a new partner understand the accounting treatment on the retirement or death of a partner appreciate reasons why a partnership could be dissolved and the accounting treatment appreciate the logic in the Gerner Vs Murray decided court case.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Changes in Partnership 3.1.1 Admission of New Partner When it comes to admission into a partnership business, the incoming partner has to accept the conditions(s) set by the existing partners apart from any other arrangement provided by the partnership deeds as regards admission of new partner.
The assets of the business are to be revalued in line with current values and the gain or loss that may arise is to be shared by the existing partners in accordance with their profit and loss sharing ratio before the admission.
The share of the gain or loss is to be recorded in the current account of each partner, thereby closing the revaluation account.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What is the process of admitting a new partner?
2.
How is revaluation account closed on admission of a new partner?
3.2 Retirement or Death of a Partner As for death or retirement of a partner, the partnership deeds or partnership Act 1890’s provisions are to be observed in addition to other conditions that might be set by the retiring partner or the trustee of the deceased partner’s assets and accepted by the surviving partners.
Again, revaluation has to be made of the assets of the business at the time of retirement or death of a partner so as to determine the closing capital of the retiring partner which is to be treated as agreed: Pay the partner or retain the amount as loan to the business.
After the changes on admission or death/retirement, the partnership is expected to continue as strong as possible, with the existing partners agreeing on the sharing formula of profit and loss, treatment of capital accounts, current accounts and drawings accounts, issue of partners’ salaries for the general/active partners, etc.
The financial position of the 70  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II business, through the balance sheet, is to highlight the revaluation made to assets, the composition of capital contribution and many other charges caused by the admission or retirement/death of partner(s).
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
What are the accounting entries on retirement of a partner?
2.
Differentiate between the accounting treatments of retirement and death of partners, if any.
3.3 Dissolution of Partnership A partnership business can be dissolved at the instance of the partners, their creditors or when it is to be converted to a company.
Due to disagreement among the partners, by majority will, the partnership can be dissolved.
Due to the insolvency of the business, which might be originated by some partners, the creditors may appeal for the dissolution of the partnership so that they can recover their money.
When partners agree to convert the business to a company business, private or public, the partnership has to be dissolved, in the first instance, and the process of conversion followed.
Realization account has to be created in which all the assets account with the exception of cash or bank balance, are to be closed.
The value realized on the assets are to be debited in the cash or bank account and all the liabilities settled from it or direct form the realization account, as the case might be.
The partners’ capital and current accounts are to be settled from the cashbook, which will automatically close itself.
At the end of the process of dissolution, all the accounts of the business are to be closed down.
Where conversion is to be made to company business, the capital accounts of the partners are to be closed by debiting them with the equivalent value of the issued share capital of the new company.

Briefly discuss three reasons why a partnership business would be dissolved.
2.
How is conversion of partnership to company business concluded?
3.4 Gerner Vs Murray Decided Case Sometimes, on dissolution of partnership concern, a partner may not be able to recover his/her deficiency/insolvency.
It was ruled in the Gerner V. Murray case, a British court decision that any deficiency of an 71  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II insolvent partner on dissolution of a partnership business shall be borne by the solvent partners in accordance with the ratio of their last agreed capital before the dissolution.
This ruling is widely accepted and is being applied in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, like Nigeria.

The aim of preparing manufacturing account is to ascertain the cost of goods produced during the year.
It is prepared in a manner to show the components of the cost of goods produced as analyzed below: Direct Materials (that is cost of raw materials consumed) x Direct Labor (that is direct wages or manufacturing wages) x Direct Expenses (e. g royalty payable, hire of machine, etc) x Prime Cost x Factory/ Production Overhead Expenses x Cost of goods produced x 2.0OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: understand the business setting in which the preparation of manufacturing account is required 83  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II understand the differences between a manufacturing account and a trading, profit and loss account explain the key terminologies used in a manufacturing account describe the principal adjustments normally being made to a manufacturing account.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Manufacturing Accounts 3.1.1 Inventories of a Manufacturing Concern Manufacturing businesses have three types of inventories (stock).
These are stock-in-trade, work-in progress inventory and raw material stocks.
For a going concern, there is bound to be opening and closing balances of the three types of stock, two of which are to be considered in the manufacturing account before arriving at the cost of production.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Enumerate any three types of inventory in a manufacturing concern.
2.
How should a going concern business report the three types of stock in its accounts?
3.2 Types of Costs Relevant in the Manufacturing Accounts A cost can simply be defined as the economic resource used in production of goods or services.
It can be classified into two main groups: direct costs and indirect costs.
Direct costs are those that can be traced directly to a product or service.
These are direct materials and direct labor costs.
All other costs apart from the first two are indirect costs or manufacturing overheads.
From the above, one can conclude that manufacturing businesses need three manufacturing cost elements to produce finished products during the production operation.
These are: 1.
Direct Materials 2.
Direct Labour 3.
Manufacturing Overhead SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
What is a cost?
2.
How cost is mainly classified?
84  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.3 Why is Cost Information Needed?
A manufacturing business must be conscious of cost information because of the following reasons: 1.
Inventory Valuation The values of inventories have to be determined before arriving at the cost of sales and the value to be included in the balance sheet in order to show a true and fair view of the financial position of the business.
As costs vary from time to time, care must be taken in giving a value to the stock remaining in the store or in process.
2.
Income Determination There is the need for the knowledge of total cost to be deducted from revenue (sales) before determining the profit or loss of the business for a period.
3.
Determining Selling Price A good knowledge of the cost helps the manager in fixing the price that the products should bear as they are sold to customers.
4.
Controlling Costs By keeping the cost of production low, a manufacturer will be in a position to lower his prices and outsell his competitors.
To be able to keep costs of production low, the manufacturer must first of all know what his costs are before finding ways of reducing them.
5.
Financial Planning Management requires cost information to plan for the future with desired financial goals.
Cost information is necessary for a good budget to be prepared.
6.
Decision Making 85  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Management must always evaluate the costs associated with alternative courses of action before taking decision otherwise it would be putting the business in trouble.
The evaluation would reveal the best option to be selected for the benefit of the business.

(2) All adjustments as to prepayments, accruals or provisions are to be taken care of in the account using the same treatments as applicable to trading and profit and loss accounts.
(3) The cost of production arrived at in the manufacturing account is to be added to the cost of opening stock in the trading account.

Manufacturing accounts are used to determine the cost of production of a manufacturing business concern before preparing its final accounts.
This, therefore, means that the final accounts of a forward integrated business or a manufacturing business concern start from the level of manufacturing account.
This Unit is introduction to the expected accounting system of a manufacturing business, including some aspects of cost accounting system to be put in place.
5.0 SUMMARY Manufacturing business concerns need to account for three manufacturing cost elements to produce finished products during the production process.
These are: 1.
Direct Materials: These are raw materials that are directly traceable to the finished goods and, so, serving as integral parts of the finished products.
For example, the cotton used for making cloth is a direct material.
2.
Direct Labor: Compensations paid to employees whose efforts can be traced to the finished product is classified as a direct labor cost.
For example, wages and salaries paid to maintenance people, supervisors, etc.
3.
Manufacturing Overhead: All manufacturing costs except direct material cost and direct labor cost are included in the manufacturing overhead costs.
They are also called factory costs or factory burden.
These include such cost items as maintenance, utilities, insurance, depreciation, glue, bolts, etc.
This Unit discusses the accounting treatments of all the above, including cost of work in progress, as a manufacturing business make effort to be prudent, accountable and transparent.

Depending on the nature of an enterprise, the value of stocks may be substantial, surpassing or only second to that of property, plant and equipment.
Appropriate classification and accurate determination of the quantity and cost of stocks are necessary for proper determination of the result of the operations of an enterprise and for the presentation of current assets in its balance sheet.
The use of several methods for valuing and reporting stocks gives rise to wide differences in the results of the operations of enterprises in the same line of business.
Statement of Accounting Standard (SAS) 4 seeks to narrow such differences by setting a standard for the valuation and presentation of items of stock in the context of the historical cost concept.
It also deals with the valuation and presentation of items of stocks including livestock and agricultural produce.
It should be noted 95  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II that SAS 4 does not deal with valuation under the replacement cost accounting concept; inflation accounting concept; valuation of work-in- progress under long-term contracts; valuation of by-products and valuation of forest products.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: define Stock and explain reasons why stock must be kept know the several methods for valuing stock know the recommended methods for valuing stock as described in SAS 4 prepare store ledger card using FIFO, LIFO and Average Method know the disclosure requirements on stock as stated in SAS 4 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Stock Valuation Methods 3.1.1 Types of Stock Taking Like cash, stock can be kept for three purpose; transactionary, speculative and precautionary motives.
Depending on the nature of items in stock, an organization can choose appropriate type of stock taking.
Two systems of stock-taking are generally in use namely:- (i) Perpetual - under this system, up-to-date records are kept of quantity and type of items of stock received, issued and on hand.
This system involves continuous physical count.
ii) Periodic - under this system, records of quantity and type of items of stock are up-dated periodically after physical count.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Describe three reasons for keeping stock.
2.
Differentiate between perpetual and periodic system of keeping stock.
3.2 Valuation Methods 96  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II There is a number of factors to be considered in valuing materials issued for use in the store.
Where purchase price are constant over a long period and there is no variation in quantities purchased, to any extent, there would be little difficulty.
But in practice, prices fluctuate due to a number of reasons: due to inflation; changes in the world commodity prices; buying from different sources; differences in quantity discounts; etc.
it is clear that there may be a number of identical materials in the store bought at different prices.
When one of these materials is issued, it is necessary to determine the price at which it should be charged.
The following valuation methods facilities the determination of both the quantity and the value of items of stock:- i.
Specific Identification: Under this method, items of stock specifically identified by particular attributes are assigned their values.
ii.
Average: Under this method, the closing stock is assigned a value determined by a weighted average of the cost of opening stock and all acquisitions during the period.
Calculation may be made on a continuous basis after each acquisition or at fixed intervals.
iii.
First In, First Out (FIFO): This is a method of computing the value of closing stock based on the assumption that the first items in stock or acquired are the first ones used in production or consumed.
iv.
Last In, first out (LIFO): This is a method of computing the value of closing stock based on the assumption that the last items purchased are the first issued or consumed.
v. Standard Cost: This is a method of computing the value of closing stock based on a predetermined cost.
For this method to reflect the actual cost, a system of allocation of variances as well as review of the standard cost must be in constant use.
vi.
Base Stock: Under this method, a minimum level of stock, carried at the historical cost of acquisition, is held at all times.
However, any additions to or excesses over the base stock are carried at different bases such as FIFO, LIFO, etc.
vii.
Latest Purchase Price: Under this method, the value of closing stock is determined by applying the cost of the latest item purchased to the number of items on hand.
97  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II viii.
Adjusted selling price (retail inventory method): It is a method of determining the value of closing stock in which the historical cost of stock is estimated by applying the gross profit margin to the retail value of items or groups of items in stock.
The amount so determined is then deducted from the retail price to arrive at the value of the stock.
The selection of each of these methods is usually guided by the principle of matching of costs with revenue.
The LIFO, latest purchase price and the base stock methods of valuation do not always adequately match costs with revenue because the value of stocks reported in the balance sheet is either overstated or understated, and the profit for the period is similarly distorted.
In arriving at the values of stocks, a reporting enterprise should state its accounting policies with respect to these items.
Generally, stocks should be valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
In determining the cost of stocks under the historical cost concept, one or more of the following valuation methods should be used where appropriate: a) First In, First Out b) Average Cost, where it consistently approximates historical cost c) Specific Identification d) Standard Cost with the adjustment of cost variances described in paragraph 15(v) which brings it close to actual cost e) The Adjusted Selling price Method where bulk purchases are made in which the costs of individual items are not readily ascertainable.
The following stock valuation methods should not be used:- a) Latest Purchase Price b) Last In, First Out c) Base Stock SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Enumerate seven methods of stock valuation and discuss any two of them.
2.
Attempt an explanation as to why any two of the listed methods are not to be used.
3.3 SAS 4 Disclosure Requirements 98  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 1.
Where differing methods of valuation have been adopted for different types of stocks, the amount included in the Financial Statements and the methods used in respect of each type should be stated in the notes to the accounts.
2.
Enterprises should classify, in a manner appropriate to their businesses, items of stocks so as to indicate the amounts held in each category, for example, raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods.
Spare parts and stores.
3.
If there is any change in the basis of stock valuation from the one used in the previous period, the change should be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of SAS I.
In this Unit, emphasis would be placed on FIFO, LIFO, Moving average and Weighted average.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
What is your understanding about the provision of SAS 4?
2.
SAS1 is about disclosure of accounting policies.
How is it related to SAS 4?

From the above, the closing stock using LIFO Method is the lowest which is mostly the case in rising price period.
4.0 CONCLUSION 10 0  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Stock constitutes one of the most important items of most business organizations, especially manufacturing organizations.
Closing stock value is deducted from the cost of goods available in order to arrive at the gross profit; accurate valuation of stock influences the profit level as higher closing stock value gives higher gross profit, net profit and current asset.
Thus, appropriate and accurate stock valuation is necessary in presentation of financial statements.
This Unit addresses this issue in a modest way.
5.0 SUMMARY The Unit gives highlights on the meaning of stock, purpose, types of stock taking, pricing methods, recommended methods of stock valuation and the disclosure requirements as stated by the Statement of Accounting Standard (SAS) 4 issued by the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board (NASB) in 1986.
Four popular methods of valuing stock (FIFO, LIFO, Moving Average and Weighted Average) are also demonstrated to enable readers appreciate how those methods work in the determination of closing stocks values.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSESSMENT 1.
From the following information you are required to determine the closing stock as at 30th April, 1993, as you prepare store ledger card using: (i) FIFO Method (ii) LIFO Method (iii) Moving Average Method (iv) Weighted Average Method 1993 purchases Jan 1 2000 units @ N100 each Feb 4 1500 units @ N125 each April 21 3000 units @ N 150 each Issues were made from the stores as follows: Jan 10 800 units Feb 15 1000 units March 30 600 units April 30 200 units 2.
For the six months ended 30th June 2006, Ramat Ltd that buys a particular product from Kano and sells to customers in Dutse has 101  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II the following transactions in its records.
There was an opening balance of 500 units valued at N70 each.
Date Quantity Bought (units) Cost per unit Jan 500 N74 March 450 N77 May 750 N79 Date Quantity Sold (units) Price per unit Feb 700 N100 April 500 N110 June 800 N115 Required: (v) Record the above transaction on a stores ledger card using each of the following methods (a) LIFO (b) FIFO (C) moving average (vi) Without preparing any trading account for the period state by how much net profit under LIFO will be different from that of FIFO.
(vii) Determine the costs of goods sold during the period using period weighted average and indicate, very briefly, why the closing stock under periodic weighted average is different from that of moving average closing stock.
(viii) Determine the gross profit for the period using moving average method.
3) If purchase prices were to remain stable.
FIFO, LIFO and moving average methods of determining inventories and cash flows would produce the same results.
Discuss 4) To what extent can one claim that a firm that uses perpetual inventory method does not need any annual stock- taking.
5) A company has opening stock of 10 units at N20 each.
Purchases during a year were made up of 100 units valued at N2, 300.
Units sold during the year amounted to 75 units.
A manager just back from a course “accounting for stock valuation” came up with the idea that using moving average, the cost of goods sold during the same period is 1,705 (to the nearest naira).
Do you agree with him?
Explain why.

A company may have the head office in 10 4  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Lagos with branches in different part of the country, for example: Kano, Abuja, Enugu, Ibadan, etc branches.
Branch accounts take into consideration the entries of transactions in the books of an organization with different branches.
Since the goods are brought by the head office and sent to the branches, there must be proper accountability.
The system of accounting to be employed will depend on the nature of trade, location and degree of control exercise by the head office.
The head office must be duly furnished with the transactions of the business through the presentation of financial results.
This Unit concentrates on accounting treatments of the transactions involving companies with local branches only.
The local branches are expected to be keeping proper records of all their transactions with different parties, not only with the head office.
Some companies even request their local branches to be preparing financial statements which are to be sent to the head office for ‘absorption’.
But basically, branches have to regularly communicate with the head office in respect of sales of goods, related expenses, etc.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: appreciate the meaning of branch account explain the pricing method involving local branches appreciate instances where head office keeps the accounts and where the branches keep separate accounts understand the accounting treatment of transactions involving local branch 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Branch Accounting System 3.1.1 Divisions of Branch Accounting Branch accounting can be divided into two different types namely: a) Where the Head Office keeps the accounts b) Where the Branches keep separate accounts.
3.1.2 Where the Head Office Keeps the Accounts The purpose behind the accounts is not merely to record transactions so that changes in assets, liabilities or capital can be calculated but also to 105  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II attempt, wherever possible, to keep a check by remote control as to whether or not the firm is being defrauded of goods or cash.
For a firm with different branches this is obviously of utmost importance.
The head office does all the buying and the branch simply does the selling.
Here the accounting for the branches is done by the head office.
This is common in large-retail chain store.
The branches will receive goods from the head office at selling price and the branches, as a matter of necessity, must produce the stock or cash to cover the value of goods received.
The branch manager should be mandated to forward to head office at weekly or other intervals giving details of goods received and return to head office, cash and credit sales, cash received from debtors, expenses, stock, debtors and cash at the end of the period.
3.1.3 Pricing Method There are three different pricing methods which are used for charging goods to branches: (i) at cost price; (ii) at cost plus a percentage; and (iii) at selling price.
3.1.3.1 At Cost Price The head office can charge goods out to branches at cost price.
This method is good when the goods are of perishable nature or there are difficulties in determining the selling price.
The exact result of operation can be ascertained when the cost price is used.
It is disadvantageous because the check imposed by selling price system is not available.
3.1.3.2 At Selling Price Method Goods can also be charged to the branch at selling price.
The price will be fixed by the head office.
The method is usually adopted when the goods are sold at specific price, for example proprietary articles.
This method is not good for perishable goods.
The advantage is that the head office can keep an effective check on the stock issued to the branch.
3.1.3.3 At Cost Plus a Percentage This is the most effective method of charging goods to the branch.
Under this pricing method, the goods will be charged to the branches at cost plus a fixed percentage.
This method can provide a reasonably reliable check upon the cash and stock at the branch and the gross profit will be disclosed by the accounts.
The branch stock account, goods sent to branch account and branch stock adjustments accounts will be maintained.
10 6  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.1.4 Accounting Entries Two methods of accounting can be used: 1.
Double column method otherwise called memorandum column 2.
Branch adjustment method 3.1.4.1 Sending Goods at Cost Price When a company sends goods to its branch (es) for sales using the cost price method, the accounts to be affected in the head office books and the accounting entries to be made therein are as follows: i) Opening stock: Dr Branch Account at cost price ii) Goods sent to Branch: Dr Branch Account Cr Goods to Branch A/c- at cost price.
iii) Sales (credit or cash) by Branch: Dr cash/Debtors Account Cr Branch Account, at selling price iv) Return of goods unsold by Branch: Dr Goods to Branch Account Cr branch Account- at cost price.
v) Return of goods by customer Dr Branch Account Cr Debtors Account- at selling price or with the value of returns vi) Any allowance by Head office (e.g) Dr Profit and Loss Account on discount, damages while in transit Cr Branch Account- with the amount or cash stolen allowed vii) Closing stock: Cr Branch Account (Balance c/d)- at cost price viii) Goods stolen: Dr Profit and Loss Account Cr Branch Account- with the value 3.1.4.2 Sending Goods at Selling Price Using the selling price method, the following entries are to be made in the relevant accounts: 1) Opening stock: Dr Branch Account- at selling price Cr Branch Adjustment Account-with the Mark-up 107  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 2) Goods sent to Branch: Dr Branch account- at selling Price Cr goods to Branch Account-at Cost price Cr Branch adjustment Account- with the Mark –up 3) Sales by Branch: Dr Cash or Debtor Account Cr Branch Account- at selling price 4) Return by branch: Dr goods to branch Account-at cost price Dr Branch Adjustment Account-with the Mark-up Cr Branch Account-at selling price 5) Return by customer: Dr Branch Account Cr Debtors Account-at selling price 6) Any allowance by the Head office: Dr Branch Adjustment Account Cr Branch Account-with the value 7) Closing stock: Dr Branch Adjustment Account-with the Mark up Cr Branch Account (Bal.
c/d)-at Selling Price 8) Stock Surplus Dr Branch account Cr Branch Adjustment Account- with the Value 9) Stock Deficit: Dr Stock Adjustment Account Cr Branch Account- with the value 10) Goods stolen: Dr Branch Adjustment Account Cr Branch Account- with the value 11) Transfer between Branches: i. Dr Receiving Branch Account Cr Giving Branch Account- at selling price ii.
Dr Branch Adjustment Account of Giving Branch Cr Branch Adjustment account of Receiving Branch-with the mark- up 10 8  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.1.5 Double Column Method or Memorandum Method Under this system, there is no need to prepare separate branch stock account and branch adjustments account.
The two accounts can be combined into memorandum or double column account.
The branch stock account will be ruled with two columns.
One column records transaction at cost and the other column at invoiced price.
The entries in the invoice price form no part of the double entry, but are memoranda just for checking of stock.
The following accounts are prepared: a.
Branch stock accounts with double column b.
Goods sent to branch account c. Profit and loss account 3.1.6 Branch Adjustment Account Method The fully integrated system introduces the idea that gross profit earned by a firm can be calculated to profit margins.
Goods sent to the branch are shown at cost price in an account for that purpose, while the Branch Stock Account is shown at selling price.
To show one entry at selling price and the other at cost would mean that debit amounts would not equal credit amounts, thus violating double entry principles.
To rectify this Branch Adjustment Account is opened and the profit loading on the goods is recorded to preserve the quality of amounts of debit and credit entries.
The Branch Stock Account by being entirely concerned with the selling prices acts as a control upon stock deficiencies, while the Branches Adjustment Accounts shows the amount of gross profit earned during the period.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Discuss any two pricing methods to be used where the Head Office keeps the accounts of its transactions with the branch.
2.
Highlight the entries to be made where the head office send the goods to the branch at selling price.
3.2 Where the Branches Keep Separate Accounts It is sometimes convenient that a branch should do its own accounting.
The reasons may be the branch is situated far from the headquarters: the nature of the activities of the branch or that the size of the branch is such that it is economical for it to prepare its own accounts.
A branch cannot operate on its own without funds, as it is the parent firm that provides these in the first instance.
The firm will want to know how much money it has invested in each branch and from this the idea 109  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II of Branch and Head Office Current Accounts would come up!
The relationship between the branch and the head office is seen as that of a debtor/creditor identity.
The current accounts are Media where the branch is shown as debtor in the head office records, while the head office is shown as a creditor in the branch records.
This is purely for expediency, because as the branch and the head office both belong to the same firm it is apparent that a firm cannot owe money to itself.
The current accounts are used for those transactions that are concerned with supplying resources to the branch or in retrieving resources from there.
For such transactions full double entry records are needed both in the branch records and also in the head office records, i.e.
each item will be recorded twice in each set of records.
Some transactions will, however, concern the branch only, and these will merely need two entries in the branch records and none in the head office records.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Give any three reasons why a branch should be encouraged to operate its separate accounting system.
2.
Why should a branch be treated as a debtor to its head office?
3.3 Illustrative Examples Illustration One MAI Enterprises operates a head office in Lagos and a branch in Ibadan.
All goods are purchased by the head office and sent to Ibadan at cost plus 25%.
The following information were given for the year ended 31st December, 2008 N Goods sent to branch at cost 50,000 Sales on credit 35,000 Return to head office at cost 500 Cash takings remitted to head office 10,000 Stock at close at cost price 12,500 Cash takings stolen 150 Sundry expenses paid out of takings 950 Goods stolen at cost 40 Allowances off selling price 100 You are required to prepare: a.
Branch account in the head office books including other necessary accounts.
b.
The profit and loss account for the year ended 31st December, 2008.
11 0  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II SOLUTION The system of accounting the head office uses is the memorandum column method.
Step1.
Calculate the selling price (invoiced price) using the mark-up of 25% on cost Selling price of goods sent to branch: Profit = Mark-up x Cost price Profit = 25/100 x 150,000 = N12,500 Selling price = Cost price + Profit N50,000 + 12,500 =N62,500 Selling price of returns to head office: Mark-up x Cost price =25/100 x500 = 125 =N500 + N125 = 625 Selling price of stock to close: Mark-up x Cost price =25/100 x 12,500 = N3,125 =N12,500 + N3,125 =N15,625 Selling price of goods: Mark-up x Cost price =25/100 x40 =N10 = N40 + 10 = N50 Step II.

The cost price for opening and closing stocks, and goods returned to Head Office were arrived at by dividing the figures by 133 1/3%.
Cost price of opening stock for example: N70,000 = N52,500 1.3333333 2.
The invoice price (selling price) of goods sent to Jos Branch was arrived at by adding the cost price to 33 1/3% of the cost price.
11 4  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II N350, 000 = N262, 500 + 0.3333333 x N262,500 =N262, 500 + N87,500 3.
Cash discount and bad debts accounts were not shown simply because they are not very appropriate to branch accounting, as they are not restricted to it, and it is assumed that the corresponding accounts have been suggested by the first entries shown in Debtors’ accounts.
4.
The gross profit determined from the Branch Accounting will go to the credit of the Head Office Profit and Loss Account: the purchase or Cost of production figure may form part of the total purchases of the company; the closing stock on the Branch account will be added to the other closing stock of the company and appear as an additional information to its trial balance: the branch Debtors’ balance will form part of the total debtors of the company and the sales made by the Branch may be added to the company’s total sales.
5.
Branch Accounting is a good instrument of testing the performance of Branch(es) in order to take decision as to whether to continue with the Branch(es) or not.
Any branch that s not assisting towards the achievement of the objective(s) of the company should be closed down.
Illustration Three The following transactions were recorded between JB enterprises of Port Harcourt and its branch at Maiduguri up to December, 2005: a) Goods sent by head office to branch N60,000 of this amount, goods to the value of N4,000 had not been received by the year end b) A sum of N15,000 had been remitted at the opening of the branch on 1/1/2005 to provide imprest c) Cash to the amount of N42,000 had been remitted by the branch to the head office but N3,000 of this had not been received by 31st December, 2005 d) Goods returned during the year from branch to head office amounting to N2,500 You are required to prepare: i) Maiduguri branch account in the books of the head office ii) Head office current account in the books of Maiduguri account 115  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II SOLUTION Head office book Maiduguri Branch Current Account N N Cash 15,000 Returns 2,500 Goods sent 60,000 Cash 39,000 Cash in transit 3,000 Goods in transit 4,000 Balance c/d 26,500 75,000 75,000 Balance b/d 26,500 Note1: Cash N39, 000 (42,000 – 3,000) ii) Maiduguri Branch Books Head Office Current Account N N Cash 42,000 Cash 15,000 Returns 2,500 Goods received 56,000 Balance c/d 26,500 71,000 71,000 Note: In the branch book, the value of goods received is N56, 000 because N4, 000 worth of goods are still in transit.
4.0 CONCLUSION Growth and development is one of the objectives that almost all businesses in the world are out to achieve.
As businesses expand and grow the need to keep proper record and track of transactions becomes necessary; branch account helps in achieving such objective.
The need to have the knowledge of branch accounting is justified by the provision of information relating to the businesses with branches which ultimately assist in the preparation of financial statements of those entities.
The book keepers and accountants of those entities should demonstrate adequate practical knowledge of branch accounting system and procedures.
11 6  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 5.0 SUMMARY In this Unit, readers have been taken through the meaning of branch accounting, emphasizing on local branch where transactions take place within the same country.

Some may divide themselves into units known as subsidiaries or just branches.
This Unit discusses the concept, advantages and principles of departmental accounting.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: appreciate what Departmental account is and its aim explain the advantages of using departmental accounts observe the principles of departmental account prepare departmental accounts for incorporation into the final accounts.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Departmental Accounting System 3.1.1 The Concept of Departmental Accounting 119  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Departmentalization enables big firms to determine clearly the areas needing special attention for the achievement of overall objectives.
The units or departments needing more funds and more attention than others and the one(s) contributing more toward goal attainment could be identified with good departmentalization.
The purpose is basically to find out the performance and capability of the units or departments with a view to making adjustments for the achievement of the firm’s objectives.
Each unit, department or subsidiary is given the free usage of some of the assets of the firm and some responsibilities which can be profit making, revenue generation or cost control.
As expenses are incurred by the firm on behalf of all its departments, indirect expenses are to be apportioned to the departments, if each department is to present financial statement or if the statement is to be prepared by the company on departmental basis.
Departmental accounting is about the preparation of final accounts taking into consideration divisional performance before the overall performance.
With that system of accounting, companies that departmentalize can easily reach conclusion as to their ‘very well’ performing units, averagely or moderately performing units.
Departmental accounting aims at separating the several activities of a business in order to compare results and to assist the proprietors/owners in formulating policies.
For example, laundry, catering,… can be required to prepare their accounts separately to deal with each department separately as departmental performance is evaluated.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What are do you understand by departmental account?
2.
What are the principles and procedures of departmental accounting?
3.2 Advantages of Departmental Accounts Some of the advantages of departmental accounts are: 1.
The gross profit of each department can be ascertained.
2.
Unprofitable departments will be revealed 3.
The result of operations can be used to determine the remuneration of managers of each department.
4.
The progress of each department can be monitored for appropriate actions to be taken.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 12 0  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 1.
Discuss any three advantages of departmental accounts.
2.
What is the main difference between departmental accounting and branch accounting?
3.3 Principles of Departmental Accounting Preparation of final accounts of a departmentalized business requires the following: (1) that the gross profit or loss and the net profit or loss of each department be determined separately before taking the total to the appropriate account or the balance sheet of the business; and (2) that there should be some bases of apportioning gains and expenses to the departments or units of the business and that should be done as fair and equitable as possible.
Sometimes control accounts have to be resorted to in order to determine the creditors’ or debtors’ value to the business.
In any case, as the departmental values are shown, the total figures, for the business as a whole are to be summed up.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
Discuss the two main issues to be taken care of in preparing final accounts of a departmentalized business.
2.
Why should total figures still be shown after departmentalization?

UNIT 3 HIRE PURCHASE ACCOUNTS AND INSTALMENTAL PAYMENTS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Accounting for Hire-Purchase Transactions 3.1.1 The Concept of Hire-Purchase and Payments under the Arrangement 3.2 Accounting Treatment 3.3 Journal Entries for Hire-Purchase Transactions 3.3.1 Entries in the Book of the Hire Purchaser 3.3.2 Entries in the Books of the Vendor 3.4 Illustrative Examples 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION Transfer of goods or assets from the owner to a user lead to various financial arrangements.
The goods or assets can be transferred to the user with the arrangement that he/she would be paying rental charges monthly or annually and the ownership remains with the vendor.
That is hire arrangement.
The goods or assets can be sold to the user (customer) with the customer paying cash immediately.
That is for cash sales (for the owner) or cash purchases (for the customer).
But where the sales of the goods or assets to the customer is for other reasons than immediate cash payments, various arrangements have to be considered for the payment, which will definitely be in the future.
Payment can be made within an agreed period of time or by the acceptance of bill of exchange after which the ownership would be transferred.
Secondly, the transaction may be under a credit sales arrangement whereby the goods become the property of the customer (buyer) immediately but payment for them takes place over a stipulated period.
To the customer, it is called credit purchases.
Thirdly, the payment can be subjected to Hire-purchase agreement.
131  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This Unit discusses accounting treatments of hire-purchase arrangement and the payments that are to follow the various transactions under the arrangement.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: understand what hire purchase is all about appreciate the difference between hire purchase and credit sales Observe the accounting treatment with respect to hire purchase transactions know how to treat installment payments.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Accounting for Hire-Purchase Transactions 3.1.1 The Concept of Hire-Purchase and Payments under the Arrangement When goods are bought under a hire purchase agreement, the legal title to the goods does not pass to the purchaser until every installment has been paid and a small amount, usually included in the last payment, is paid which legally exercises an option to buy the goods.
Thus to buy any asset on hire purchase arrangement is legally to hire the goods until certain time, when the option can be exercised to take over the legal title to the goods.
Normally the hire purchaser is not compelled to complete the transaction.
If he so wishes he may return the asset without making any further installmental payment.
He will, however, forfeit the right to have any of his previous installments repaid to him.
On default the seller can reclaim the goods, subject to certain provisions of the Hire Purchase Acts.
The repossessed items taken back into stock are not new and have to be revalued accordingly.
A variation of this procedure is that the vendor sells the goods outright to another party (e.g.
finance company) which then follows the procedure above and enters into a hire purchase contract with the hire- purchaser.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
What do you understand by the concept of hire-purchase?
2.
How is installmental payment made in a hire-purchase arrangement?
13 2  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.2 Accounting Treatment Under the hire purchase arrangement, the hire purchaser obtains possession of the goods at the outset, but the ownership remains with the vendor until the end of the hiring period.
On strict legal interpretation of the facts, the vendor should not take credit for any profit and the hire- purchaser should not debit the cost of the items until the hiring period has ended.
Accounting, however, looks at the substance of the transactions rather than at its legal form.
Consequently, the vendor recognizes profit as arising over the period of hire-purchase instead of at the end.
Similarly, the hire-purchaser makes the necessary entry in purchases or fixed assets account at the beginning of the period and not after the option fee has been paid.
Under a hire purchase arrangement, the selling price consists of cost plus gross profit (thus giving cash price) plus a further sum of hire purchase interest by way of compensation to the vendor for the delay in receiving full payment and for the attendant risks.
This is reasonable imposition because the vendor may have had to borrow money from other sources to finance the deal, on which he would pay interest.
Another justification is that the money tied up in the deal might have been earning a return by being invested inside or outside the business of the vendor.
Items of hire purchase dealt with in the accounts of the businesses are invariably fixed assets.
This is because acquiring trading stock and other short-term items on hire purchase would require so short a hiring period as to nullify the advantages of hire-purchase arrangement.
From the point of view of the buyer, under a hire purchases contract, the purchase price consists of two elements- the “cash” cost price and the hire purchase interest- which together makes up the hire purchase price but which must be accounted for separately.
It should be noted that installmental payment can be equal or unequal and the buyer is expected to pay as at when due, failure to do so can lead to repossession of the good/item.
In the balance sheet the cash price paid is treated as an asset while the cash price not paid is regarded as liability.
Also future interest not paid is not regarded as liability because interest is charged to profit and loss account as it accrues.
From the point of the view of the seller under hire purchase contract, the selling price consists of three elements: (i) the purchase price and (ii) the 133  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II gross profit, which together give the “cash” selling price, and (iii) the hire purchase interest which makes the latter up to the hire purchase selling price.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss the accounting treatments on the relationship between the vendor and hire-purchaser.
2.
From the point of view of the seller in a hire-purchase contract, the selling price consists of three elements.
Explain them.
3.3 Journal Entries for Hire-Purchase Transactions Different accounting journal entries apply to the vendor and to the hire- purchaser of goods, as follows: 3.3.1 Entries in the Book of the Hire Purchaser a) Dr Assets Account XX To Hire purchase XX To record the selling price of the assets hire- purchased b) Dr Hire Purchase vendor A/c XX To bank/Cash Account XX To record the deposit and installment payment c) Dr Hire Purchase Interest A/c XX To Hire Purchase Vendor A/c XX To record the interest payable to the vendor Notes: 1.
Hire purchase vendor Account is to be closed at the end of the hiring period.
2.
Assets Accounts will continue to show the historical cost of the asset hire-purchased.
3.
Hire purchased Interest Account is to be closed, periodically, to the profit and loss account of the hire-purchaser making the interest to form part of his business running expenses.
4.
Provision for depreciation account is to be accumulating up to the end of the hiring period, and it is the accumulated depreciation that is to be taken to the balance sheet as a deductible expense out of the assets value, at the end of each accounting period.
13 4  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 5.
The depreciation account is to be closed, periodically, to the profit and loss account of the hire purchaser.
6.
The balance sheet is to show the written down value (WDV) of the asset at the end of each accounting period and is to show the value in the hire purchase account as a liability.
3.3.2 Entries in the Books of the Vendor a) Dr Hire purchase Trading Account XX To general Trading account XX To record the cost price of the asset on hire purchase contract.
b) Dr Hire purchase Debtor Account XX To Hire Purchase Trading A/c XX To record the selling price of the asset, resulting to profit c) Dr Cash/Bank Account XX To Hire Purchase Debtor A/c XX To record deposit and installment payments in respect of the agreement d) Dr hire Purchase Debtor Account XX To H.P interest Receivable A/c XX To record the interest due to the hire purchase contract Notes: 1.
The vendor is to show neither the assets hire-purchased nor the depreciation on the asset in his balance sheet.
2.
Hire Purchase Trading Account Cost Price XX hire Purchase Debtor XX *Gross Profit XX XX XX *The Gross profit from the contract is to be credited to the profit and loss account of the vendor.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
What are the entries to be made to record deposit and installmental payment in respect of hire-purchase agreement?
2.
Why should the Vendor avoid recording the value of the assets hire- purchased in his balance sheet?
135  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.4 Illustrative Examples Illustration One A taxi-hire concern purchased vehicle on hire purchase system (from Mr. Risk) over a period of three years paying N846 down on 1st January, 1993 and 3 installments of N2,000 each on 31/12/93, 31/12/94 and 31/12/95.
The cash price of the vehicle was N6, 000, the vendor company charging interest at 8 percent per annum on outstanding balances.
Required: Show the appropriate ledger accounts in the hire purchaser’s books for the three years and how the items would appear in the balance sheet as at 31st December, 1993.
Depreciation is to be at the rate of 10% per annum on the written down value of the vehicle and interest is to be calculated to the nearest naira.
SOLUTION Five ledger accounts are to be shown: Hire Purchase Vendor Account, Asset Account, Hire Purchase Interest Account, Depreciation Account and Accumulated (or Provision For) depreciation Account.

The Hire purchase interest, the installment payments, and the depreciation charges were calculated for the number of months to the end of the accounting year.
3.
The Hire purchase interest on NOL 999 was calculated as follows: 141  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 4.
N192/24 = N8 per month On NOM 767 = N240/24 = N10 3) The monthly installmental payments were calculated as follows: NOL 999 = 1,800+192-312 24 = 1,680/24 = N70 NOM 999 = 2,400+240-480 24 = 2,160/24 = N90 4.
The depreciation accounts of the two types of Lorries are to be debited with the charges credited to the provision for depreciation account.
The depreciation accounts are to be closed, annually to the profit and loss account while the provision for depreciation accounts is to be reflected in the balance sheet as deduction to the values of the Lorries.
5.
The depreciation charges were calculated as follows: NOL 999 7 months to 31/12/06: 20% of 1,800 x 7/12=N210 8 months to 31/1207: 20% of 1,800 x 8/12=N240 NOM 767 2 months to 31/12/06: 20% of 2,400 x 2/12= N80 12 months to 31/12/07: 20% of 2,400 = N480 4.0 CONCLUSION Hire purchase is one of the methods which businesses can use to acquire assets which may either be impossible or very difficult to acquire by cash.
The method is flexible as it allows the hire purchaser to pay installmentally for the hire purchase price which covers the cost price profit margin and the interest.
Hire purchase, therefore, helps in improving the return of businesses since the hire purchaser uses the assets before even acquiring them.

The implication of this is that the separate businesses will discontinue their ownership and come under a single ownership.
Business combination can be found in sole- proprietorship, partnership and in companies’ business arrangements.
The scope of this unit covers companies’ amalgamation and absorption.
Business combination can, therefore, take two forms: i) Amalgamation and ii) Absorption.
147  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Sometimes companies are dissolved due to financial problems and after several adjustments re-register to carry on normal business.
This process is called reconstruction or reorganization.
This exercise is undertaken by those companies which incur heavy losses for long time and where unable to write off such losses, or companies having substantial fictitious assets such as goodwill, preliminary expenses, profit and loss account debit balances, etc.
This Unit discusses the accounting treatments of the issues raised here with a view to demonstrating the accounting presence in all types of transactions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: appreciate the meaning of business combination understand reason(s) why businesses combine to produce a stronger entity explain the major types of business combination appreciate the accounting entries for business combination.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Accounting for Business Combination 3.1.1 Amalgamation This refers to a situation where companies that exist separately under different ownership combine to form a new one.
The major feature of this arrangement is that the two businesses that amalgamate will no longer exist, that is, they are liquidated.
For example, Company A may combine with company B to form Company AB which is expected to be larger and more viable.
Ideally suited to this method are similar sized businesses operating on a relatively small scale.
Reasons/benefits of amalgamation include: a) The desire to gain larger share of the market.
b) The desire to attain synergy.
c) The desire to establish a solid capital base.
d) The desire to provide efficient customer service.
e) The desire to acquire a base adequately for raw materials sourcing in the case of a manufacturing firm.
f) The desire to be able to challenge a major competition.
g) In order to meet legal and statutory requirements.
h) To enjoy political policies during a period.
14 8  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II When businesses amalgamate, two major accounting problems arise, namely: i) those concerned with closing the books of the discontinuing businesses which are being wound up; and ii) those concerned with the establishment of new business.
3.1.1.1 Closing the Books of the Discontinuing Companies To close the books of the discontinuing companies, the following ledger accounts are necessary: i) Realization account ii) New company account iii) Sundry members account iv) Each liability account, e.g creditors, liquidation expenses payable/creditors for dissolution expenses, loan or debenture account v) Bank account vi) Component of purchase consideration, e.g ordinary shares issued, preference share issued, debenture stock issued and cash paid.
3.1.1.2 Realization Account This is the account in which profit or loss on the dissolution of a discontinuing company is determined.
It is usually prepared in a columnar form.
The number of columns will depend on the number of companies amalgamating.
The following transactions or events are usually accounted for in the realization account: a. Debit all assets at book value to realization account b.
Determine the purchase consideration and credit it to the realization account c. Amalgamation, dissolution or liquidation expenses should be debited to realization account.
This will in effect reduce the profit on realization or increase the loss on realization d. Profit or loss on realization is determined, that is, the balance on realization account is transferred to the sundry members account (ordinary).
3.1.1.3 New Company Account This is the account where the purchase consideration and related transactions are treated.
The purchase consideration, when agreed, is debited to this account (remember that the credit entry goes to realization account) while transaction relating to the purchase 149  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II consideration are credited to the account when settlement of the agreed purchase consideration is made.
The account can, therefore, be regarded as a “self balancing” account.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Discuss any four benefits of amalgamation in business combination process.
2.
Mention six accounts to be created on closing the books of discontinuing businesses, and explain any two.
3.2Specific Accounts Needed 3.2.1 Sundry Members Account (Ordinary and Preference) The following accounting transactions are affected in the sundry members account: a.
Transfer the components of the shareholders fund (e.g.
ordinary shares, preference shares, and reserves) to the account by debiting each of the components of the shareholders fund and credit sundry members account b.
The profit/loss on realization is also transferred to this account.
c. Each of the components of purchase consideration, when settlement is effected as agreed, including cash, are transferred to this account and the account will automatically balance.
This account is similar to the partners’ account in the amalgamation of partnership.
It should be noted, however, that if there is more than one class of preference shares, the classes must be separated and different ledger accounts opened for each class.
For example, if in the balance sheet there are 10% preference shares, 8% cumulative preference shares and 5% redeemable preference shares, these are three different classes of preference shares, therefore, three different sundry members preference accounts must be opened to present each of them separately.
3.2.2 Liability Accounts Balances on each liability account such as trade creditors and long term loans/debentures should be brought down in their respective ledger accounts.
It should be noted that each liability is either settled by the discontinuing business or taken over by the new business.
15 0  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Where the liability is settled by the discontinuing business, the liability account is debited and cash/bank account credited.
However, where the liability is taken over by the new business, it becomes part of the purchase consideration and is treated as follows: Dr.
Liability account Cr.
New Company account Cr.
Discount Received from Creditors, where the liability has been settled at less than the book value and this is regarded as full and final settlement.
It means the discount has been received from creditors.
The accounting entries are: Dr.
Liability account Cr.
Realization Account Liabilities settled above the book value Where a liability has been settled above its book value, the difference between the book value and the takeover value is debited to realization account.
This implies that a loss was incurred in settlement of liability.
The accounting entries will be: Dr – Realization account with the difference Cr- liability account and amount paid SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss any two transactions that are related to sundry members’ accounts.
2.
How are liabilities accounts treated in the books of a discontinuing business?
3.3 Purchase Consideration This is the aggregate amount, which the new company is to pay the owners (that is the stakeholders) of the discontinuing business and creditors.
The components of purchase consideration in amalgamation of companies may be some or all of the following: i) Ordinary shares issued by new company ii) Preference shares issued by new company iii) Debenture stock issued by new company iv) Cash given by the new company v) Liabilities of the old companies taken over by the new company 151  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Where liabilities are taken over, they form part of the purchase consideration.
Such liabilities are debited to the liabilities account and credited to the new company account.
Ledger accounts are opened for each of the components of purchase consideration.
On settlement of the purchase consideration as agreed, each of the components of the purchase consideration is debited while the new company account is credited.
On distribution to the owners of discontinuing businesses, the sundry members account is debited and each of the components of purchase consideration credited.
The accounting entries necessary to close the book of discontinuing businesses being liquidated are summarized below: Dr- Realization Account Cr-individual assets Account Event: the book value of the asset taken over by the company at the date of cessation Dr- Individual Liability Account Cr- New Company Account Event: liabilities taken over by the new company at the date of cessation.
(If part of purchase consideration) Dr-New company’s Account Cr- Realization Account Event: Agreed purchase consideration (including liabilities taken over) Dr- Realization Account Cr-Realization expenses payable account/creditors’ account for realization expenses Event: Realization expenses.
Dr - Liquidation expenses payable account Cr-Bank account Event: portion of the realization expenses paid by the company being discontinued Dr- Creditors account Cr- Realization account 15 2  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Event: Discount received from creditors Dr-Realization account Cr-Sundry shareholders and debenture holders account.
Event: Profit on realization (this is to be derived) Dr-Share capital reserves and debenture account Cr-Sundry shareholders and debenture holders account Event: Transfer of balances on share capital, reserves and debentures account Dr-Bank and/or shares and/or debentures in new company account Cr-New company’s account Event: settlement of the agreed purchase consideration by the new company Dr-Creditors account Cr-Bank account Event: Settlement of liabilities not taken over by the new company Dr-bank account Cr creditors account .
Dr- bank and/ or shares and/ or debentures in the New Company Account Cr-Sundry shareholders and debenture holders account Event: distribution of balances Dr- Preference dividends in arrears Cr-Sundry members’ preference Event: Arrears of pref.
dividend included in the balance sheet as a liability Dr- Retained profit or any other revenue reserve Cr-Sundry members’ preference account Event: Cumulative preference dividend in arrears but not included in the balance sheet and not to be forfeited.
Dr-Retained profit or any Cr- Debenture stock Event: Arrears of debenture interest if any Dr-Proposed dividend account Cr-Sundry members’ shares account Event: Ordinary dividend included in the balance sheet.
153  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Describe any four components of purchase consideration in amalgamation of companies.
2.
What are the necessary entries for closing the fixed assets and liabilities accounts of a liquidating business?
3.4 Establishment of the New Company and Accounting Entries The accounting entries in the books of the new company can be divided into two: i) The amalgamation journal ii) The balance sheet after amalgamation.
3.4.1 Amalgamation Journal This is a composite journal which is prepared to reflect the assets and liabilities taken over as well as goodwill or capital reserve on amalgamation.
On the debit side of the journal are all tangible assets taken over at revaluation value or taken over value.
However, if the takeover values are not given, it is assumed that the assets are taken over at book values.
The takeover value will only be used when such assets are not revalued.
If revalued, the revaluation value will be used instead of the takeover value.
On the credit side of the journal, are all the components of purchase consideration (including liabilities taken over) as contained on the credit side of the new company account in the book of discontinuing businesses.
The difference between the debit and the credit entries made in the journal represents goodwill or capital reserve.
If the balancing figure on the journal is an asset (i.e debit balance), it is referred to as goodwill.
If it is a claim over the assets (i.e.
credit balance), it is referred to as capital reserve.
15 4  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Proforma of the Amalgamation Journal Dr Cr N N Land & Building X Plant & Machinery X Furniture & Fitting X Motor Vehicles X Stocks X Debtors X Goodwill (balancing figure) X Creditors X Bank overdraft X 3% debenture X Ordinary shares X Preference shares X X X Being assets and liabilities taken over on amalgamation of A ltd and B ltd to form AB Ltd.
NOTE: It is instructive that the amounts of each of the assets mentioned above are combined amount of the takeover values of all the companies that amalgamated.
Also, the amounts on the credit side of the journal are combined figures of each item on the new company account as they appeared in the book of the discontinuing company.
It should also be noted that the journal is a composite journal.
The corresponding debit and credit entry is the purchase of business account or vendor account.
All transactions after amalgamation in the book of the new company must be journalized by using a simple journal.
Such transactions may include fresh issue at or above the nominal value.
Where fresh issues of shares are made for cash, the accounting entries will be: Dr-Bank/Cash account Cr-ordinary share capital account with the nominal value Cr-share premium account with the premium After this, the balance sheet of the new company can be prepared.
155  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.4.2 The Balance Sheet of the New Company The balance sheet of the new company, after amalgamation is prepared using the figures from the opening journal subject to adjustments for transactions after amalgamation as enumerated above.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
Differentiate between goodwill and capital reserve.
2.
What are the accounting entries to be made where fresh issues of shares are made for cash?
3.5 Absorption, Takeover or Purchase of Business Absorption involves a situation whereby a company takes over another company.
The company that is taken over (i.e.
absorbed company) will lose its identity (i.e.
wound up) while the assets and liabilities of the absorbing company will increase after the absorption.
For example, A ltd can purchase or take over B ltd to form a bigger A ltd.
This means that unlike amalgamation in which all the amalgamating businesses lose their identities, only one (i.e the absorbed company) loses its identity in the case of absorption.
The amalgamation method is employed where relatively small scaled businesses are concerned.
Where this is not the case and large, complex businesses are involved, a holding company is usually established to acquire all, or majority holding, of voting shares of those companies which then continue in existence.
But as subsidiaries of the holding company .the acquisition of controlling interest can also arise without the establishment of a holding company for the purpose, when an existing dominant company acquires a controlling interest in one or more other companies.
When a business takes over another business, two major problems arise.
These are: i) Those concern with the closing the books of the discontinuing business which is being wound up.
ii) Those concern with the updating the records of the continuing business.
15 6  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II 3.5.1 Closing the Books of the Discontinuing Company To close the books of the discontinuing company, the following ledger accounts are necessary: i) Realization account ii) Absorbing company’s account iii) Sundry members account iv) Each liability account v) Bank account vi) Account for each component of purchase consideration The operation of each of the ledger accounts mentioned above are similar to those of amalgamation except that all entries that are passed into new company’s account in amalgamation go to absorbing company account.
On essence, profit or loss on realization is determined on realization account and transferred to sundry members’ ordinary account.
All liabilities are either paid off by the absorbed company or taken over by the absorbing company.
Each component of purchase consideration is transferred to sundry members ordinary or preference account.
All adjustments are made to bank account before the balance is transferred to realization account (i.e.
bank/cash taken over by absorbing company).
It should be noted that where bank is not taken over, the balance should be debited to sundry members or ordinary account.
3.5.2 Accounting Entries in the Books of Absorbing or Continuing Business The continuing business has been in existence before it took over the absorbed business.
Therefore, its assets and liabilities will increase in proportion to the assets and liabilities taken over.
The account of its assets, liabilities and shareholders’ fund must be brought down in their respective ledger accounts.
The records to incorporate the activities of the business taken over will be divided into two, as follows: 157  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II a) The absorbing journal b) Recording from the absorbing journal to the existing relevant ledger account.
3.5.3 The Absorption Journal The journal is a composite journal which is prepared to reflect the assets and liabilities taken over and determine the goodwill or capital reserve.
On the debit side of the journals are all tangible assets taken over at revaluation value or takeover value when such assets are not revalued.
On the credit side of the journal are all the purchase considerations (including liabilities taken over) as stated on the credit side of the absorbing company account in the book of the discontinuing business.
The difference between the debit and credit sides of the journal represent goodwill or capital reserve.
In essence, the journal is not different from the amalgamation journal except that in amalgamation, the amounts on the journals are combined amounts of the companies involved I the amalgamation, while in absorption it is only the amounts of the dissolved (absorbed) company.
The formats of the two journals are similar.
3.5.4 Recording Items from the Absorption Journal to the Ledger Account The ledger accounts opened for assets and claims over assets are scrutinized.
Items in the absorbing journal and other journals are then transferred to the relevant ledger accounts with each of them having the narration ‘vendor’.
Assets from the journal will be posted to the debit side of the relevant asset account while liabilities and claims over the assets from the journal will be posted to the credit side of each relevant ledger account.
After this, the ledger accounts are balanced and the balance sheet for the continuing business can be prepared.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 58.

4.0 CONCLUSION 165  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Business combination is the bringing together of separate entities or business into one reporting entity.
The result of nearly all business combinations is that one entity, the acquirer, obtains control of one or more other businesses, the acquirees.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method; the acquirer shall, therefore, disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of business combination that were made during the period.
5.0 SUMMARY In this Unit, readers are informed on what business combination is; and reasons that may lead to business combination which can be in form of either amalgamation or absorption.
The readers were also taken through the various accounting entries with respect to amalgamation and absorption.
The Unit is a demonstration of the fact that accounting treatments are very clear on the issues of purchase consideration determination, amalgamation processes, absorptions and takeovers.

The management of an enterprise and its outside suppliers of capital- creditors and investors- would want to undertake financial analysis in order to make rational economic, political or social decisions.
This Unit introduces the concepts of ratio and financial analysis, emphasizing on the use of accounting ratios for effective financial analysis by business organizations.
2.0 OBJECTIVES 17 0  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II At the end of this unit, you should be able to: appreciate the concept of ratio understand how to conduct financial analysis, using accounting ratios test the efficiency and effectiveness of business enterprises 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Financial Ratio Analysis 3.1.1 The Concept of Ratio To evaluate the financial condition and performance of a business entity, the financial analyst needs certain yardsticks.
The yardstick frequently used is a ratio, or index, relating two pieces of financial data to each other.
A ratio is one number expressed in terms of another and is found by dividing one number, the base, into another.
Its analysis facilities evaluation of accounting information by reducing complicated data into a smaller set.
The use of ratios in accounting and finance provides the means of testing the efficiency of key features of a business as represented in the final accounts.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Define the term “ratio”.
2.
What is ratio use for in accounting?
3.2 Comparative Analysis Using Ratios The analysis of financial ratios involves two types of comparison.
First, the analyst can compare a present ratio with past and expected future ratios for the same company.
The acid-test ratio for the present year-end could be compared with the acid-test ratio for the preceding year-end.
Using the computed financial ratios for a number of years, an analyst can study the composition of changes in financial condition and performance of a business over time.
In the comparison over time, it is best to compare not only the financial ratios but also the raw figures.
The second method of comparison involves comparing the ratios of the one business with those of similar businesses or with industry average at the same point in time.
Such a comparison gives insight into the relative financial condition and performance of a business.
It is only when 171  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II comparing the financial ratios of one business with those of similar businesses or industry average that one can make realistic judgments.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Discuss the two type of comparison in ratio analysis.
2.
Why is it important to compare raw figures apart from the ratios computed from them?
3.3 Users of Accounting Information and Their Interests The type of financial ratio analysis varies according to the specific interests of the party involved.
A trade creditor is interested primarily in the liquidity position of a business.
His claim is short-term, and the ability of a business to pay this claim is best judged by means of a thorough analysis of its liquidity position, and so financial ratios to be analyzed must be liquidity-testing in nature.
The claim of a bondholder, on the other hand, is long term.
Accordingly, he would be more interested in the cash flow ability of the business to service debt over the long run.
The bondholder may evaluate this ability by analyzing the capital structure of the business, the major sources and uses of funds, its profitability over times and projections of future profitability.
Ratio-wise, he would concentrate on debt and profitability ratios.
An investor in a company’s common stock is concerned principally with present and expected future earnings and the stability of these earnings about a trend.
As a result, the investor might concentrate his analysis on the profitability of the business.
He would be concerned with its financial condition in so far as this condition affects the stability of future earnings.
In his analysis, therefore, investments and profitability ratios would be concentrated on.
In order to bargain more effectively for outside funds, the management of a business should be interested in all aspects of financial analysis that outside suppliers of capital use in evaluating the business.
In addition, management employs financial analysis for purposes of internal control.
In particular, it is concerned with profitability on investment in the various assets of the business and in the efficiency of assets management.
Management, therefore, should use all types of ratios in order to adequately analyze or test its performance.
Other interested groups in financial statement of businesses, who conduct financial ratio analysis, in one way or the other, are government 17 2  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II and its agencies, potential buyers of business, actual and potential customers and present and aspiring employees.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 1.
Discuss any three users of accounting information and their information needs.
2.
Why should management of a business be interested in all aspects of financial analysis?
3.4 Types of Ratios and Their Formulae Ratios can be categorized in different ways.
But for the purpose of our studies, financial ratios can be divided into six types: Overall Performance, Profitability, Productivity, Liquidity, Capital Structure and Investment ratios.
Some of the ratios are computed from the Balance Sheet, some from the Income Statement and others from both the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement.
It is important to recognize from the outset that no one ratio gives us sufficient information by which to judge the financial condition and performance of a business.
It is only when we analyze a group of ratios that we will be able to make reasonable judgments.
3.4.1 Overall Performance Ratios These ratios are used to test the general performance of a business and its management.
Some of the ratio here are: (i) Return On Investment (ROI) given by: Net Profit after tax x 100 Total Assets The ratio relates the profit earned, after tax and interest, to the total of the financial structure (total assets) of the business.
It is used as the best test of the efficiency of management in the use of the resources of the business.
It is sometimes called Earning Power Ratio.
The higher the earning power, the more profitable the business is.
(ii) Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) given by: Net Profit before tax and interest x 100 Capital Employed The ratio relates the profit earned before tax and interest to the amount of long term capital invested in the business.
Capital employed means: 173  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Total Assets less Current Liabilities (or just owners equity plus long- term liabilities).
It is a test of the ability of a business to earn profit, making effective use of capital under its dispensation.
The higher the ROCE, all things being equal, the more profitable the business would be.
(iii) Returns On Equity (ROE) given by: Net Profit after tax x 100 Owners’ Equity OR NP after tax – Pref.
Div.
x 100 Net Worth – Pref.
Share This ratio shows the actual return to the shareholders only, as the payment of interest to long term lenders, and, of course, taxes to government have been deducted.
Comparison should be made with the returns in other investment, e.g.
bank deposit interest, for a better assessment of a business that is apart from the inter-firm comparison and comparison over time.
3.4.2 Profitability Ratios These ratios are used to test the profitability of a business in relation to turnover (sales).
Some of the ratios are: (i) Gross Profit Margin (GPM) given by: Sales- Cost of goods sold x 100 Sales OR Gross Profit x 100 Sales This ratio is a good measure of the efficiency of a business’ operations.
Increase in the ratio indicates increase in efficiency or performance.
(ii) Mark-up on Cost (MOC) given by: Gross Profit x 100 Cost of Goods sold 17 4  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This ratio serves the same purpose as (i) above.
The two ratios are used to analyze the trading profitability of a business.
A fall in these ratios below expectation may be due to (a) reduction in selling price, (b) Poor buying or (iii) Poor stock control.
(iii) Net Profit Margin (NPM) given by: Net Profit before tax x 100 Sale This ratio measures the final profit made on sales after all of the running expenses have been deducted from the gross profit.
If this ratio is falling whilst gross profit margin remains constant, then increases in running costs (selling, administrative costs) should be investigated and efforts made to reduce them.
3.4.3 Productivity Ratios These ratios are used to test the level of sales (turnover) obtained from the assets employed by the business.
The higher the ratios, the better the performance of the reporting entity.
(i) Sales Per Employee (SPE) given by: Sales Number of Employees This ratio is used to measure the productivity of the employees of a business.
The effective use of labor is one of the key tasks of the management of a business and, so, this ratio is very important in that test.
It is also relevant to the employees as it reflects their efforts during an accounting period; it shows increase or decrease in the employee effectiveness.
The ratio is expressed in Naira (=N=) term.
(ii) Assets Turnover Ratio (ATR) given by: Sales Total Assets This ratio expresses the number of times the value of assets utilized by a business has been generated into sales.
The ratio is expresses in times.
(iii) Stock Turnover Ratio (STR) given by: Cost of Goods Sold OR Sales Average Stock Stock or Average Stock 175  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This ratio is an important measure of the effective use of stock by a business.
The adequacy of the ratio will depend on the type of industry.
For example, a supermarket is likely to turnover its stock much more quickly than a furniture-making shop or jewelry.
If the turnover is declining then the reasons should be investigated.
Possible factors would include: (a) a large amount of slow moving or obsolete stock, (b) high levels of stock being held, (c) a wide range of products being stocked and (d) lack of control over purchasing.
iv(a) Debtors Turnover Ratio(DTR) given by: Sales Debtors (b) Average Collection Period (ACP) Ratio given by: Debtors or Receivables x 365 days Credit Sales 3.4.4 Liquidity Ratios Liquidity ratio is the term used to describe the extent to which a business can pay its debts as they fall due.
Insolvency is the state of being unable to pay debts as they fall due.
Insolvency may lead to bankruptcy and collapse of the business Investors are unwilling to buy shares in, or lend money to, a company which is insolvent and traders are unwilling to supply goods on credit to companies that are or are likely to become insolvent.
Some of these ratios are: (i) Current Ratio (CR) given by: Current Assets Current Liabilities This ratio compares all short-term resources with all short-term obligations and indicates the ability of a company to meet its short-term debts using short-term sources of finance.
As a guide, most businesses will require a ratio of 2:1.
Too high the ratio will suggest too much money tied up in current assets; whilst too law the ratio could be dangerous if the creditors press for a quick payment.
(ii) Acid-Test Ratio (AR) or Quick Ratio (QR) given by: Current Assets – Stock 17 6  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II Current Liabilities This ratio takes tougher view as it excludes stock from the numerator.
This is done because in some businesses it takes a long time to turn inventory into cash.
As it is rare for trade creditors to ask for payment at the same time, time is normally allowed for money to be obtained from debtors – good debtors.
A reasonable quick ratio is 1:1.
(iii) Average Payment Period (APP) given by: Total Creditors x 365 days Credit Purchases NB: Some analysts use 360 days for a year.
The period can be expressed in terms of months in which case 12 months would be multiplied with instead of 360 days.
This ratio reveals the average number of days taken by a business in making payment to trade creditors.
A higher (than average credit period granted by creditors) ratio will indicate a high degree of insolvency.
A low ratio indicates an efficient credit payment system.
3.4.5 Capital Structure Ratios Companies are usually financed by (a) short-term loans like trade credit and bank overdraft; (b) Long-term loans like debentures or loan stocks; (c) Money deposited by persons or institutions who become shareholders or (d) Retained Earnings or Undistributed profit which belong to shareholders.
The funds obtained through (a) and (b) are known as DEBT while those obtained through (c) and (d) are called EQUITY or shareholders’ funds.
Capital structure is about the long- term capitalization of a business which is given by the equity plus the long-term debt.
Some of the ratios here are: (i) Gearing (Debt) Ratio (GR) given by: Total Debts x 100 Total Assets The ratio measures the extent to which a business is financed by debt.
Prospective lenders may wish to see the shareholders’ contribution constituting at least 50% of the overall assets value of the business before lending their money to it, they may not be prepared to lend if further lending would push gearing ratio too high.
177  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II (ii) Debt-to-Net-Worth Ratio (DNWR) given by: Total Debts x 100 Net Worth This ratio relates total debts (including current liabilities) to net worth (Equity).
Depending upon the purpose for which the ratio is used stock sometimes is included as debt rather than as net worth, when analyzing a business.
This is because preferred stock represents a prior claim from the standpoint of the investor in common stock.
The ratio is a very good test of the long-term liquidity of a business, that is, its ability to meet long-term obligations.
(c) Long-term Debt to Capitalization(LDCR) given by: Long-term Debts x 100 Total Capitalization This ratio indicates the relative importance of long-term debts in the capital structure or total capitalization of a business.
Capitalization is usually defined to be invested capital (i.e.
non-current liabilities) plus owners’ equity.
It is about the capital structure of a business or its financial structure (total assets) less current liabilities.
Debt ratios tell us the relative proportions of capital contributed by creditors and by owners.
They are strong means of measuring the financial risk of a business.
(d) Interest Cover Ratio(ICR) given by: Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) Interest Charged An important factor affecting lending decisions is the ability of a business to satisfactorily meet its interest payments.
If the gearing ratio is very high, a business will have large interest expenses to meet out of profit.
Interest cover ratio indicates the level of cover which the business has achieved.
It shows the number of times the profit before interest and tax will cover the interest charged on the debt, at any given period of time.
3.4.6 Investment Ratios The financial statement of quoted companies are used by prospective and existing investors and their advisers in order to make investment 17 8  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II decisions like buying more shares, holding on shares or selling out shares.
The investors are anxious to be reasonably assured that the security (share or stock) which they acquired or intend to acquire will offer a positive flow of future income or that its value will be appreciating.
It is this assurance that encourages investors to commit their savings or, sometimes, borrowed funds.
Decisions on investment are assisted by investment ratios to be calculated from the financial statements of the target businesses or to be obtained from the published analysis on the pages of financial dailies or weeklies.
Some of these ratios are: (i) Earning Per Share (EPS) Ratio given by: Profit before tax Number of Shares (Common Stock) This ratio is used to measure the success of a business in terms of profit attributable to each share held in the company.
Success may result from improved performance in the use of assets.
Growth resulting from improved performance is the real measure of a business success.
(ii) Price Earning (P/E) Ratio given by: Quoted Price (Market price) of one share (if any) Profit attributable to one share (EPS) This ratio shows the confidence a shareholder can place in the profit growth of a business.
A high P/E ratio suggests strong shareholder’s confidence in the business and its future, and a low P/E ratio suggests low confidence.
It is the most important ratio that influences price movement on most Stock Exchanges.
(iii) Earning Yield Ratio given by: EPS x 100 Market Price This ratio is the reciprocal of price earnings ratio.
It shows the return on current market price.
iv) Divided Per Share (DRS) Ratio given by: Dividend Paid (or Proposed) Number of Shares 179  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II This ratio indicates the dividend payable per share held in company.
(e) Dividend Yield, given by: DPS x 100 Market Price This is relates the income from shares (the dividend) to the value of the investment in the business.
The result can be compared with interest rates from other types of investments.
(vi) Dividend Cover Rover Ratio, given by: Profit available to Ordinary Shareholders Dividend Declared Or Earnings Dividend The ratio shows the number of times dividend is covered by earnings.
The ratio indicates dividend and retention policy of a business, which is about amount to be paid as dividend to shareholders, out of the profit realized, and the amount to be retained in the business to finance future growth and expansion.
NB: Comparison has to be made with ratios of similar businesses or with the ratios of the business over time before reaching conclusion on the favorableness or otherwise of any of the twenty-three ratios discussed above, or any selection there from for meeting the requirements of an interested analyst.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 1.
Discuss the importance of “Overall Performance Ratios”.
2.
Compare the relevance of Liquidity Ratios and Productivity Ratios in testing the performance of a business.
4.0 CONCLUSION The financial reports of enterprises are useless if they are not subjected to critical analysis and interpretation.
The analysis is to be as comparative as possible, employing an objective tool/yardstick.
The tool normally used by financial analysts to test the health, productivity and profitability of a business is ratio.
This Unit presents an in-depth 18 0  BHM112 GENERAL ACCOUNTING II introductory discussion on the concept of ratio and how to employ it in the conduct of effective financial analysis with a view to making a lot of revelation about the performance of a reporting entity.
