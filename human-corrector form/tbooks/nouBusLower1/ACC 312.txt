When preparing account for a company, it is common to think of companies that generally engage in the sale of goods and services, such that, the common way of presenting financial statements is used.
Such accounting presentations are usually of general view.
However, there are specialized businesses whose financial statements might be different from those of a general nature.
The financial statements are usually a summary of all the transactions posted in the various accounts.
The balances of these accounts are reported by the preparation and presentation of the financial statements.
Consequently, without the various accounts, we cannot have the financial statements.
Similarly, the various accounts of specialized businesses will enable the preparation and presentation of financial statements for specialized businesses.
Therefore, let us consider the accounts in some of these specialized businesses 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 8.
Prepare the accounts of estate agencies and property companies.

3.2 FARMER’S ACCOUNT Farmers prepare trading, profit and loss account, and balance sheet, just as every other business outfit.
However, peculiarities in a farmer’s account are mainly in the valuation of stock of arable plantation products and livestock.
Statement of Accounting Standard No.
4(SAS) on stock, prescribes treatment of these peculiarities.
3.2.1 ARABLE PRODUCTS a.
First-time land clearing and stumping may involve substantial costs which are sometimes capitalised.
b. Tillage in-ground and harvested crops are three distinct operational stages requiring valuation.
Each operational stage has its own peculiar problems of revaluation.
Costs incurred are charged to each category.
c. The value of tillage usually includes the accumulated costs of labour and usage of machinery for preparing the land for planting, ploughing and fertilizer spreading.
d. In-ground crops are usually valued by including the costs associated with tillage, labour, seedlings, weeding, disease control and the attributable cost of machinery used.
12 e. The valuation of harvested crops involves the correct determination of actual input costs, labour, depreciation and storage costs at the time of harvest, to ensure that the value of harvested crops includes all the costs incurred from tillage to harvesting.
f. Most farm products are perishable or deteriorate quickly: therefore, it is appropriate to make reasonable provision for deterioration or animal spoilage based on norm within the industry or after consultation with experts.
g. Where there is adequate record keeping and an appropriate cost accounting system, cost forms the basis for the valuation of arable products.
In other situations, net realisable value is used.
h. Official prices for certain products, such as, maize, sorghum and millet, are published by the appropriate commodity Boards, for example, National Grains Board.
Use of such official prices is not, however, recommended except where they are below cost.
3.2.2 PLANTATION PRODUCTS a.
The major problem with the determination of the value of a plantation product is that, a plantation does not usually start to produce until after a long gestation period.
Thus, all costs associated with land preparation, planting, pruning and development are accumulated until the trees come to maturity are amortized over the estimated productive life of the plantation.
b.
It is the normal practice to have planting done in lots or batches so as to have a continuous flow of plantation output.
Where possible, costs of such lots or batches are accumulated separately in order to match their revenue with associated costs, when harvested and sold.
c. Each year the cost of plantation output consists of the preparation of the cost accumulated for the quantities harvested plus the cost of extracting and transporting them to the point of sale.
d. Some enterprises prefer to use average cost of production in assigning value to the quantities harvested and those not harvested.
This method is justifiable because most plantation products are homogenous.
e. Some plantation crops such as sugarcane and banana are annual crops which yield produce within the first year of being planted.
Stocks of such produce are valued in the same manner as arable products.
On the other hand, certain fruit trees such as oranges, mangoes are often grown on a much smaller scale than would normally be regarded as plantation.
However, stocks of their products are valued in the same manner as those in plantations.
3.2.3 LIVESTOCK a.
Two major problems are associated with the valuation of livestock: i.
Determining the actual number and their existence, especially, grazing animal; and ii.
Identifying the various stages of their development.
b.
The following three approaches to valuation of stock are generally in use: i.
Cost approach; the value is based on the actual cost incurred on each category of livestock.
13  ii.
Net realisable value; the value is based on the expected returns allowing for the costs of fattening, preparation for sale and selling.
iii.
Appraised value: the value is determined by professional valuers, taking into consideration the current market value, the mortality factor and the relative marketability of the breed or class of stock.
c. Where livestock is raised primarily for its products rather than for consumption.
Such as dairy cattle or egg-laying poultry, different considerations arise in the valuation of such stock.
It is usual to accumulate the cost of bringing such livestock to the point of maturity at which they begin to yield products and to amortise such costs over their estimated productive lives.
d. The stocks in livestock enterprise usually include feeds- stock, drugs, small implements and other essential materials.
They are usually valued at cost after a physical count.
3.2.4 Main Features of Farm Accounts a.
Open departmental accounts for different activities such as dairy, crops, fruits and livestock rearing, and where necessary, sub-divide the activities.
b.
Open ledger accounts as in commercial activities, for example, debit purchases account and credit creditor’s account, for purchases of input on credit.
c. Rotation of crops resulting in a number of fields lying “fallow”, occasionally sown with “fallow crops”, that is, a number of fields are not in full production.
d. Large mechanised farms keep financial records but most small farm records are incomplete or at best; single entries recording receipts and payments.
e. Large expenditure incurred on seeds and fertilizers may occasionally be spread over a period.
Farming equipment purchased that are of material value and expected to be in use for a long period should be capitalized.
f. Valuation of stock and manorial rights are carried out by farm experts.
g. Where destruction of animals and crops as a result of disease and pest respectively occur, compensation for loss is computed for possible insurance claim.
h. Large farms take insurance cover for loss of livestock due to infection or loss of cattle as a result of straying.

3.3 OIL AND GAS ACCOUNTING- UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES Companies involved in prospecting and production of crude oil are guided by the Statement of Accounting Standard (SAS) No.
14.
The basic principles and illustration of peculiar accounting treatment and methods of calculating depletion, depreciation and amortization of prospecting and production costs of oil and gas will be made.
Readers are advised to have another look at SAS No.
14 for the definition of terms and other details.
3.3.1 Costs in oil and gas operations may be classified broadly as: a.
Mineral rights acquisition costs; b.
Exploration and drilling costs; c. Development costs; d. Production costs; e. Support Equipment and facilities costs; and f. General costs 3.3.2 Oil and Gas accounting methods, full costs, successful effort Methods and procedures followed by oil companies in accounting for explorations and development costs diverge significantly.
Two basic accounting methods that are in common use are the full cost and the successful efforts methods.
Both methods are widely followed and each of them has a valid conceptual justification.
17  3.3.3 Full cost method a.
All costs incurred on mineral rights acquisition, exploration and development activities (including future development costs) should be capitalized irrespective of whether or not the activities resulted in the discovering of reserves.
b.
The companies using full cost method are referred to as “full cost companies” while those using successful efforts method is referred to as “successful efforts companies: c. A third method known as reserve recognition accounting (RRA) allows an enterprise to recognise the “value” of proved oil and gas reserves as assets and changes in such reserve values as earnings in the financial statements.
This method is not common, therefore, it is not recommended.
d. A ceiling test should be conducted at least annually, in order to determine whether the costs capitalized can be recovered from the proved reserve.
e. Proved reserves represent estimated quantity of oil and gas that can be expected to be recovered from known reservoirs using existing technology.
Proved reserve may be developed or undeveloped.
3.3.4 Successful efforts method a.
Costs incurred prior to acquisition of mineral rights and other exploration activities not specifically directed to an identifiable structure, should be written off in the period they are incurred.
b.
All costs incurred on mineral rights acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development activities should be capitalised, initially on the basis of wells, field or exploration cost centres, pending determination.
c. Such costs should be written off when it is determined that the well is dry.
d. Mineral rights acquisition costs that have not been allocated should be amortized over the remaining life of the licence.

If impairment were done on individual basis, a provision of N12 million would be made.
However, no provision would be made for group or aggregate bases of assessment since group assessed value is higher than cost.
Prudence concept is applied here.
3.3.5 Joint Production of Oil and Gas DD & A is computed based on the equivalent units of production in barrels, where oil and gas are jointly produced.
The barrels are the cost unit for oil and are equivalent to 42 US gallons, while gas is measured in metric cubic feet (MCF).
For the purpose of calculating equivalent units, it is a standard assumption that one barrel of oil contains six times as much energy as gas, hence the volume of gas is divided by 6 to arrive at equivalent barrels.
3.3.6 Revenue Method of Amortization DD & A could also be computed based on the current prices (year-end) of the reserves and production.
The revenue methods should eliminate distortion caused by the 6:1 conversion ratio by determining amortisation on the relative value of hydrocarbons.

The Funds of a cooperative society are usually generated from the contributions from members through direct monthly contributions and agreed deductions from members’ salaries, in case of employees.
The fund is then lent to its members for a stated purpose at an interest rate that is usually below the market rate.
Contributions from members could be in form of subscriptions to the society’s share capital, members’ savings or education fund.
The Society’s funds are invested in shares of limited liability companies, short-term deposits, or commodities for sale to its members, to generate income for the society.

Some authors have argued that the term “principle” gives GAAP an unjustified measure of permanent since the concept changes in response to new developments in the business and economic environment.
The word “practice” perhaps better reflects the fact that accounting practice alters in response to changes in different social-economic environments, GAAP, therefore, goes beyond mere principles as they encompass contemporary accounting practices that are permissible within an accounting environment.
By extension, international GAAP encompasses contemporary accounting practices that are “regarded as permissible by the accounting profession and regulators internationally” (Bonham, et al 2008).
The Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) constitute the source of international GAAP.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is the source of International GAAP?
3.4 FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY OF AN ACCOUNTING PRACTICE 37 The following factors, outlined by Bonham et al (2008), members of Ernst & Young Global, provide useful guide in determining whether an accounting practice should be acceptable in a country’s GAAP, as well as international GAAP.
(a) Is the practice addressed in accounting standards or other official pronouncement?
(b) Is the practice addressed in accounting standards that deal with similar and related issues?
(c) If the practice is not addressed in accounting standards, is it dealt with in the standards of another country that could reasonably be considered to offer authoritative guidance?
(d) Is the practice consistent with the needs of users and the objectives of financial reporting?
(e) Does the practice have authoritative support in the accounting literature?
(f) Is the practice consistent with the underlying conceptual framework document?
(g) Does the practice meet basic criteria as to the quality of information required for financial statements to be useful to users?
(h) Does the practice fairly reflect the economic substance of the transaction involved?
(i) Is the practice consistent with the fundamental concept of ‘fair presentation?’ (j) Are other companies in similar situation generally applying the practice?
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE State the factors that determine the acceptability of an accounting practice.
3.5 ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS These are generally accepted principles used in the preparation of financial statements and are rarely disclosed because of their general acceptability.
They are: (a) Entity concept: This principle assumes that a company or corporation is a separate entity on its own; it can sue and be sued in a court of law.
(b) Going concern: The concept assumes that an organization will continue to operate for the foreseeable future.
The balance sheet and profit and loss account assume no intention to liquidate or curtail its scale of operations.
(c) Realization concept: This concept recognizes revenue as soon as it is capable of objective measurement and the value of asset is reasonably certain.
(d) Matching concept: Under this concept, revenue or income and costs in a period are matched and dealt with in the profit and loss account of the period they relate.
(e) Double entry principle/concept: This concept assumes that every transaction should have two entries.
In other words, where there is a debit entry, there has to be a corresponding credit entry for proper accountability.
(f) Consistency concept: This means that every like item within each accounting period should be treated the same way.
This allows for easy comparison of accounts of an entity over a period of time.
(g) Prudence concept: This assumes that income is actually realized, not estimated.
That is, revenue and profit should not be anticipated but recognized only when realized in cash or other assets.
Prudence and realization concepts, are basic concepts in determining profit made.
(h) Periodicity: This concept assumes that transactions should be separated into particular periods for easy matching of revenue with expenses.
38 (i) Historical cost: This assumes that items should be stated at their original cost of purchase rather than realisable value.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Mention and briefly explain five accounting concepts.
3.6 ACCOUNTING METHOD AND POLICY Accounting Method This is the medium through which accounting concepts are applied to financial transactions in the preparation of financial statements.
The methods adopted and applied by an organization in applying the fundamental accounting principles to its financial transactions are called the Accounting Bases.
There are two bases used in the preparation of financial statements.
They are (a) The accrual basis ; (b) The cash basis Accounting Policy Every organization or corporation has a policy used in the preparation of its accounts.
Accounting policies are, therefore, the basic rules, principles, conventions and procedures adopted in the preparation and presentation of financial statements.
Disclosure of Accounting Policies Accounting policies adopted by an organization or corporation in the preparation and presentation of financial statements are disclosed under one heading to provide an overview.
Use of Accounting Policies Policies adopted by an organization are based on personal judgement and the suitability of presenting a true and fair view of the result of an organization.
Therefore, there is a need for management to be careful and rational in their choice of accounting policies.
There are principles that should be used as a guide.
These are: (a) Substance over form: This principle states that generally the legal form of every transaction is a basis for recording its commercial status in the books of accounts, but there are instances whereby the legal status differs from the commercial status.
In such instances, the commercial status shall be recognized rather than the legal form.
For example, in a finance lease agreement, the commercial status is recognized by including the assets acquired as part of the fixed assets of the lessee, despite the fact that legal title remains with the lessor.
(b) Objectivity: This principle states that an accountant should be fair and unbiased in the process of recording, collating, summarizing, analysing and interpreting financial transactions.
This implies that accountants should be fair to all users of financial information and also treat transactions without emotion.
(c) Materiality: The principle holds that only items of material values are accorded strict accounting treatment: that is, items with significant values.
(d) Prudence: Revenue and profits are not to be anticipated but recognized only when realized while known losses should be adequately provided for.
39 (e) Fairness: this is a product of the objectivity principle.
It emphasizes the need for accountants not to be influenced by any user, but to prepare accounts based on acceptable principles.
Where fundamental accounting concepts are followed in the preparation of accounts, disclosure of such concepts is not necessary unless there is a departure from the fundamental accounting concepts.
However, when selecting accounting policies, rational judgement should be used: thus, the principles of substance over form, objectivity, fairness, and materiality can conveniently allow prudence to govern.
A reporting enterprise should disclose the basis used in the preparation of accounts if it is significant for the understanding and interpretation of a financial statement.
The policies should also be disclosed as an integral part of the financial statements.
Accounting policies should be used consistently to facilitate comparison except where a different policy will better enhance or reflect net profit or loss of current or subsequent periods.
When there is a change in accounting policy, the nature, justification and the effect on current year’s profit or loss should be disclosed.
Also, cumulative effect of the change on profit or loss of prior periods should be adjusted in the retained earnings.
ILLUSTRATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting Financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for some fixed assets which are included at their professional valuation.
Consolidation Group profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the company and all the subsidiaries and the company’s share of profit after tax, less losses of associated companies.
Goodwill Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the net assets is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet as goodwill arising on acquisition.
Investments Investments in subsidiary and associated companies are stated at the lower of cost or the company’s share of their net tangible asset value at the year end.
Fixed Assets Land and buildings are stated at their professional valuation plus additions at cost.
Other fixed assets are stated at cost.
Depreciation Depreciation on a fixed asset is calculated to write-off the cost or valuation on a straight line basis over its expected useful life.
Stock and Work-In-Progress 40 Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value after making adequate provision for obsolescence and damaged items.
In the case of goods manufactured by the company, cost consists of direct labour, material and appropriate proportion of factory overhead.
Turnover Turnover represents the net value of goods and service invoiced or sold to third party, net of value added tax (VAT).
Contract in Progress These are stated at the values of independence engineers’ certificate for work done but in respect of which payments were not received at the year end, plus estimated values made by officials of the company of the realizable value of work done not yet certified.
Foreign Currency Conversion Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into naira at the prevailing rate ruling at the date the relevant invoices are received, while assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Deferred Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation by the liability method to take account of all timing differences between accounting treatment of certain items and their corresponding treatment for income tax purposes.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the two bases used in preparing financial statements?
4.0 CONCLUSION There are many alternative postulates, assumptions, principles and methods that could be used in preparing the financial statements of a reporting entity.
These alternative methods impact on the financial position and operational results of corporate entities differently.
To ensure a degree of comparison of financial reports, there should be minimum uniform standards and guidelines of financial accounting that different entities have to follow in financial reporting.
These standards are referred to as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
5.0 SUMMARY This unit has explained the meaning and sources of GAAP in Nigeria and globally.
It also looked at the purpose of GAAP and the basic accounting concepts used in Nigeria.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the powers of the Board?
3.6 NASB DUE PROCESS The development of a new and proposed accounting standard involves a long process which ensures that all interested parties are given the opportunity to express their views.
This standard setting process is called Due Process and it can take more than two years in some cases.
The stages involved in the production of a Statement of Accounting Standard (SAS) are outlined below: (a) The first stage in the development of an accounting standard is the selection of a topic for standardization.
Such topic can be suggested by any individual or organization.
45 (b) The next stage is the selection of a steering committee of experts, comprising mainly of lending authorities in that area.
This committee usually includes an accountant in practice, representative of the affected industry, representative of the Federal Inland Revenue Service Board, and academia, and at least one person representing the business community who may be affected by the proposed standard (Nnadi, 2006).
(c) The Steering Committee directs the NASB secretariat in drafting or (re-drafting) of the point outline which details the aspects of the topic to be covered.
(d) When the steering is satisfied with the points outlined, it is submitted to the Council for approval.
(e) Upon the approval of the points outlined by the Council, the steering committee directs the Secretariat in the preparation of a draft exposure draft.
After consideration of the draft exposure draft by the steering committee, it is recommended to the Council for approval as exposure draft.
(f) The Council usually meets for two working days to meticulously examine the exposure draft submitted to it.
If two-thirds of the members present at the technical session vote in favour of its publication, then the document becomes an exposure draft.
(g) Each Exposure Draft is exposed for about three months.
During this period, recipients of the document are expected to comment in writing and the NASB may conduct a public hearing where necessary.
(h) Based on comments received from the public, the Exposure Draft may be amended.
If an amended exposure draft is approved by three-quarters of council members present at its meetings, it becomes an accounting standard.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Describe the stages involved in the development of statement of accounting standard.
4.0 CONCLUSION It is important you know that the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board being a local accounting body in Nigeria also relates with the trend of accounting development at the international environment, thereby making local conceptualization of accounting procedures to be in conformity with international accounting standards.
We shall be discussing the International Accounting Standards Board in the next unit.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed a brief history of the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board and state the reasons for establishing the Board.

A step further is to discuss the international Accounting Standards Board.
The International Accounting Standard board is set up in order to facilitate the harmonization of accounting standards all over the world.
This provides a platform for local accounting systems to relate with global interests in accounting practice.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Describe a brief history that led to the establishment of the IASB.
2.
State the objectives of the IASB.
3.
State the features of the IASB structure.
4.
Outline the stages of the IASB due process.
5.
Outline some of the argument for and against accounting standards generally.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD In 1973, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was established to develop and issue accounting standards that should guide the preparation and presentation of financial statements, globally.
The IAS was in existence until 2001 by which time it had issued forty-one International Accounting Standards (IASs).
Because of differences in interpreting the accounting standards issued by the IASC, a new body called Standard Interpretation Committee (SIC) was established by the IASC in 1997.
As at 2001, the SIC had issued 32 interpretations, some of which are still applicable to financial statements issued today.
In 2001, there were fundamental changes in the global standard setting body which resulted in the establishment of a new body called International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), to take over the responsibilities of the IASC with effect from 1st April, 2001.
The IASB now issues International 48 Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in place of International Accounting Standards (IAS) issued by the IASC.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Describe the brief history of the International accounting Standard Board.
3.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE IASB Article 2 of the IASB constitution sets out the objectives of the IASC foundation, as follows: (a) To develop, in the public interest, a single set of high quality, understandable and enforceable global accounting standards that require high quality, transparent and comparable information in financial statements and other financial reporting to help participants in world’ capital markets and other users make economic decisions; (b) To promote the use and rigorous application of those standards; (c) To fulfil the objectives associated with (a) and (b) above, to take account of, as appropriate, the special needs of small and medium-sized entities and emerging economics; and (d) To bring about convergence of national accounting standards and international financial reporting standards to high quality resolutions.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the objectives of the International Accounting Standard Committee?
3.3 STRUCTURE OF THE IASB In accordance with Article 18 of its Constitution, “The International Accounting Standards Board is an independent, privately-funded accounting standard-setter based in London, U.K.
The Board members come from nine countries and have a variety of functional backgrounds”.
The IASB structure has the following main features.
(a) Trustees.
The trustees are not involved in the standard process of the IASB, but have responsibility for strategic operational issues such as budgets, operational procedures of the IASB and appointment of members of the Board IFRIC and SAC.
(b) The Board.
The Board consists of 12 full-time members and 2 part-time members who are appointed by the Trustees, based on their technical skills and other experience.
These members are responsible for the standard setting activities of the IASB.
(c) Standards Advisory Council (SAC).
The SAC provides a forum for the IASB to consult with a range of individuals and organizations affected by the IASB’s work.
The SAC also advises the IASB on a wide range of issues including the IASB’s agenda and IASB’s project priorities and time table.
(d) International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).
The IFRIC assists the IASB in improving financial reporting by providing timely guidance and interpretation of international financial reporting standards.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the features of the International Accounting Standard Board?
3.4 THE IASB DUE PROCESS As with SASs, the development of IFRSs follows a due process which comprises the following six stages, according to the IASB’s Due Process Handbook.
49 Stage 1: Setting the agenda; Stage 2: Project planning; Stage 3: Development and publication of a discussion paper; Stage 4: Development and publication of an exposure draft; Stage 5: Development and publication of an IFRS; Stage 6: Procedures after an IFRS is issued.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline the due process of the International Accounting Standard Board.
3.5 ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST STANDARDS Arguments for are: (a) They give accountants and auditors some protection from those who may try to pressurize them into using improper methods and.
Therefore, ensure their independence.
(b) They ensure that all stakeholders make contributions into the standard formulation and as such enriches the quality; (c) They usually conform with international accounting standards; (d) They usually conform with all existing law and regulation requirements; for example CAMA 2004, BOFIA 1991, Insurance Act 2003; (e) The Standards are reviewed periodically to conform with the latest economic and social developments; and (f) The enactment of the NASB Act, 2003, gives it power to enforce compliance with standard.
Arguments against may be discussed, as follows: (a) They inhibit initiative as decisions have already been made; (b) They rarely take account of peculiarities of the individual businesses, and (c) Standards may be ‘watered-down’, due to exposure to interested parties or intended users.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the arguments against and for accounting standards?
4.0 CONCLUSION The IASC or the accountancy profession does not have the power to enforce international agreement or to require compliance with international accounting standards.
The success of IASC’s effort is dependent upon recognition and support for its work from many different interested groups acting within the limits of their own jurisdiction.
Recognition of IASC’s work comes from groups such as the international bodies representing financial institutions, financial executives, trade unions, employers, stock exchanges, lawyers, securities commissions and financial analysts involved in the Board and consultative group.
Others include the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Federation of Accountants.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed International Accounting Standards Board.
We discussed issues relating to how the International Accounting Standards Board evolved.
Similarly, other issues such as objectives 50 of the IASB, features of the IASB structure, the IASB due process, and the argument for and against accounting standards were discussed.

3.3 SAS 10: ACCOUNTING FOR BANKS AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (PART 1) The Statement (Part1), focuses on three main areas, relating to accounting practices of banks, namely: (a) Income recognition; (b) Loss recognition; and (c) Balance Sheet Classification Some of the major provisions of SAS No.
10 are presented below: Accounting Policies (a) A bank should articulate and disclose as an integral part of its financial statements, all the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of its financial statements.
(b) The accounting policies should be prominently disclosed under one caption rather than as notes to individual items in the financial statements.
Income Recognition (a) On loans, drafts and other risk assets, interest income should be recognised so as to record a constant yield on the outstanding principal, over the life of the credit at the interest rate applicable to the facility.
(b) For discount products, on which interest is often settled upfront or in arrears, the discount should be over the life of the product so as to give a constant yield on the outstanding principal.
(c) Credit-related fee income, where material and its collectability is not in doubt, should be deferred and amortized over the life of the related credit in proportion to the outstanding credit risk.
Credit related fee income should be regarded as material in all situations where in aggregate, they constitute at least 10% of the projected average annual yield over the life of the facility to which they relate.
Related direct expenses should be deducted from the fees before deferral.
(d) In situation where credit-related fee income is not material as defined above, the fees may be recognized at once, provided all associated costs are expensed in the same period.
(e) Non-credit related fee income should be recognized as earned.
Fees earned over a long period of time or in stages, and which are not contingent upon the occurrence of a future event, should be recognized when the related service is performed, or on the completion of 56 contracted stages.
Fees relating to a transaction, in which some portion of related credit risk is retained, should be treated as above.
(f) Lease rental income should be recognised in a systematic manner so as to record a constant yield on the lessor’s net investment in the lease over its terms.
If the lease contains an interest rate variation clause, the yield should be adjusted in the appropriate period.
(g) Profits or losses arising on sale of loans or discounts without recourse to the seller, should be recognized by the seller, when the transaction is completed.
(h) Profit arising on sale of loans or discount with recourse to the seller, should be amortized by the seller over the remaining life.
Losses should be recognized as soon as they can be reasonably estimated.
Loss recognition Banks should make provision for all losses as soon as they can be reasonably estimated.
Losses can arise on any asset considered doubtful of being realized in full and can include loan loss provisions against diminution in the value of other assets and loss contingencies.
Loan loss (a) Banks should make provision for loan loss after a thorough and systematic review of all its credit risks, including loans and advances, leases and off-balance sheet engagements.
The precise time at which a provision should be made against a credit risk, is a matter of judgment, especially in the case of revolving facilities such as overdrafts.
Each bank should develop a formal procedure for identifying non-performing facilities and evaluating loan losses and a systematic method of making provisions for loan losses.
Each bank should consider other indications that a loss may arise on a credit risk since for example, loan may be doubtful of recovery even if it is performing in accordance with its terms.
(b) Loan loss provisions are as provided below Fixed facilities Indications that a fixed facility is non-performing include a situation in which interest and/or principal repayments are in arrears of the facility terms.
In those cases: (a) Interest overdue by more than 90 days (or such shorter period as may be specified by regulatory authorities) should be suspended and recognized on a cash basis.
(b) Principal repayment which is overdue by more than 120 days (or such shorter period as may be specified by regulatory authorities) should be fully provisioned and recoveries recognized on cash basis.
(c) When individual principal repayment are subject to provision, banks should make provision against the outstanding principal repayments not yet due as follows: No.
Of days for which Minimum percentage provision required Principal is overdue for principal not due 180 days 50% 360 days 100% Where regulatory authorities stipulate shorter periods or higher percentages than indicated above, such shorter periods or higher percentage should be followed.
57 (d) Where the facility is secured by a perfect fixed legal charge over, or by title to, tangible property, the principal provision could cease once the outstanding principal is less than a specified proportion of the estimated net realisable value of the security as follows: (i ) Where the principal repayment is overdue by more than one year, the outstanding Principal not provided should not exceed 50% of the estimated net realizable value of security.
(ii) Where the principal repayment is overdue by more than two years, there should be no outstanding portion not provided of the credit facility irrespective of the estimated net realizable value of security held.
(iii) In both (i) and (ii) above, where regulatory authorities stipulate shorter periods of lower percentages, such shorter or lower percentage should be followed.
(e) Where a facility is secured by a floating charge or an unperfected or equitable charge over tangible property, it should be treated as an unsecured credit and no account taken of any security held in determining the provision for loan loss.
Revolving and Overdraft facilities (a) Normally, the first indication that a revolving or overdraft facility may be non-performing is when the turnover on the account is considerably lower than anticipated when the facility was arranged or when interest is charged which take the facilities above its limit.
In these circumstances: (i) A revolving facility should be classified as non-performing and unpaid interest suspended once a period of 90days (or shorter period as may be specified by regulatory authorities) elapses after the facility limit is exceeded.
(ii) Where credit limits are not exceeded, each bank should have a systematic method for the identification of non-performing revolving credits.
Once classified as non-performing, all unpaid interest on the facility should be suspended.
(iii) Once a facility is classified as non-performing, provision against principal and unpaid interest should be made in accordance with a systematic method to reduce the outstanding principal to the estimated net realisable value of any security held (following the criteria earlier specified over a specified period).
(b) In the case of revolving and overdraft facilities, where a loan rescheduling is agreed with a customer, the rescheduling should be treated as a new facility but provisioning should continue until it is clear that the rescheduling is working.
Interest previously suspended and, provisions against principal previously made, should be recognized on a cash basis.
Facilities performing in arrears In many cases, short time cash flow difficulties result in a customer temporarily falling behind its facility terms.
In these cases, provision should be made in accordance with the principles set out above.
Once the facilities begin to perform, interest previously suspended and provisions against principle previously made should be recognized on cash basis.
General provisioning Banks should make general loan loss provision of at least 1% of their risk assets not specifically provided for, in addition to specific provisions, to provide against the unidentified losses which are known to exist in any portfolio, using a systematic method, which should be consistently followed from period to period.
58 Investment securities Long-term investment in marketable securities should be stated at net realisable value.
Original cost should be disclosed.
Short-term investments in marketable securities should be stated at net realisable value.
Original cost should be disclosed.
Investment in securities for which there is no active market, should be stated at lower of cost and net realisable value.
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE Please refer to ACC311 course material for illustrations on the accounts of banks.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline the three main areas of the Statement (Part1) relating to accounting practices of banks.
4.0 CONCLUSION The syllabus requires students to study detailed contents and application from SAS 10 to SAS issued to date and to discuss IASs/IFRSs not covered by current suite of SASs issued by the NASB.
The correlated presentation of SASs and IASs above clearly shows us the IASs and IFRSs to be included in our discussion of accounting standards in this unit and subsequent units.
You are advised to avail yourself the opportunity of getting Accounting Standards Handbook published by the NASB and visit the IASB website to obtain comprehensive coverage of the standards, since a single unit in this course material cannot by any stretch of imagination cover all the aspects of the accounting standards listed.
What is, therefore, presented in the following sections, in terms of contents of SASs and IASs, is a theoretical and practical guide on Nigerian Accounting Standards.
Equally worthy of mention is the fact that some of the standards discussed in this unit have been illustrated earlier on.
In such cases, in the subsection entitled illustrative examples, you will be referred to the units where the related illustrative examples have been given.
In the other cases where the standards have not been illustrated in other units of this course material, illustrations are given as such topics are discussed.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we stated a list of Accounting Standards issued by the Nigerian Accounting Standard Board and the International Accounting Standard Board/Committee.

The Statement of Accounting Standard 11 on Leases was issued to achieve the following primary objectives: (a) To ensure that published financial statements contain sufficient information about lease transactions, to make it possible for users of such statements to determine the effects of lease commitments, on the present and future operations of the reporting enterprises; and (b) To ensure uniform disclosure of terms and classes in financial statements.
The Statement of Accounting Standard 13 on accounting for investment focuses on three main forms of investments, namely; (a) Short-term investments (current investment); (ii) Long-term investments; and (iii) Investment properties 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.

(b) Operating lease is one in which the lessor, while giving the lessee the use of the leased property, retains practically all the risks, obligations and rewards of ownership, for example, early obsolescence and appreciation.
(c) Finance or capital lease is one in which ownership risks and rewards are transferred to the lessee, who is obligated to pay such costs as insurance, maintenance and similar charges on the property.
Usually, the agreement is non-cancellable and the lessee has the option to buy the property for a nominal amount upon the expiration of the lease.
Other variants of finance or capital leases are: (i) Leveraged lease is a three-party lease involving a lender and lessee.
The lender supplies, in most cases, the greater part of the purchase price of the leased asset.
(ii) sales-typed lease is one where the offeror or dealer (lessor) transfers substantially all the ownership risks and benefits of the property to the lessee and at the inception of the lease, the fair value of leased asset is greater than its carrying amount in the books of the lessor resulting in a profit or loss to the lessor (who is often not a manufacturer or dealer).
(iv) Direct finance lease is one which transfers substantially all the ownership risks, and benefits of the property to the lessee and at the inception of the lease, the fair value of leased assets is the same as its carrying amount to the lessor (often not a manufacturer or dealer).
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is a lease?
3.2 Some of the Provisions of Statement of Accounting Standard 11 (a) A reporting enterprise should state, in the appropriate section of its financial statements, its accounting policy with respect to leases.
(b) A reporting enterprise should, at the inception, of a lease, classify it as either a finance lease or as a finance lease or an operating lease.
(c) A lease qualifies as a finance lease if the following conditions are met.
(i) Lease is non-cancellable, and (ii) Any of the following is applicable:  The lease term covers substantially (80% or more) the estimated useful life of the asset or,  The net present value of the lease as its inception, using the minimum lease payment payments and the fair value of the leased asset or,  The lease has a purchase option which is likely to be exercised (d) A lease which does not qualify as a finance lease as specified above should be treated as an operating lease.
61 Finance leases (a) The reporting enterprise should account for a finance lease by recording the lease as an acquisition of an asset and the incurrence of a liability.
(b) Where lease right is capitalised by the lessee as in (a) above, the following should be determined: (I) The initial value of the leased asset and the corresponding liability; (II) The amortisation rate or amount; and (III) The amount by which the lease liability is to be reduced.
(c) At the beginning of the lease term, the lessee should record the initial assets and liability at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased asset less the present value of an unguaranteed or partially guaranteed residual value which would accrue to the lessor at the end of the term of the lease.
The discount factor to apply in calculating the present value of the unguaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor is the interest rate implicit in the lease.
(d) Where the lessee cannot determine the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease or is unable to make a reasonably estimate of the residual value of the lease without which the interest rate implicit in the lease could not be computed, the initial asset and liability should be recorded at amounts equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as the discounting factor.
(e) The leased asset should be depreciated or the rights under the leased assets should be amortized in a manner consistent with the depreciation policy on the lessee’s own assets.
(f) The minimum lease payment in respect of each accounting period should be allocated between finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding lease liability.
The finance charge should be determined by applying the rate implicit in the lease to the outstanding liability at the beginning of the period.
The ‘sum of the years digit’ may be used as an approximation.
(g) Contingent rentals should be written off in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating Leases The rental expenses should be charged into the income account on systematic basis, in line with the time pattern of the user’s benefit, not on the basis of the rental payments made by the user.
Accounting for leases in the financial statements of the lessor Finance leases (b) An asset under a finance lease should be recorded in the financial statements of the lessor, not as property, plant and equipment, but as an investment in a lease.
(c) At the inception of the lease, the lessor should recognize in the accounts simultaneously: (i) Gross investment in the lease; and (ii) Unearned finance income from the lease.
(d) The unearned finance income should be deferred and allocated to income of the lessor over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment outstanding.
(e) Contingent rentals should be recognized in the accounts of the period to which they relate.
(f) Initial direct costs that are identifiable with direct financing of the lease should be taken to the income statement in the period in which the costs were incurred.
62 (g) In sales type lease, the manufacturer or dealer-lessor should take to the income statement, the difference between the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease and its carrying amount.
(h) Investment in leases should be reviewed periodically for recoverability in the same manner as other receivables, but with regard to the security, if any, held by the lessor, for example, recourse to the leased asset.
(i) Where a reappraisal is made of the residual value of the asset and this shows a diminution, the resulting loss should be charged to the income statement.
Gross investment in the lease should similarly be written down.
Operating leases (a) Where the lessor classifies a lease agreement as an operating lease, it should be accounted for by the lessor as an item of property, plant and equipment.
Accordingly, the periodic rentals that are receivable should be treated as rental income.
(b) The depreciation of a leased asset by the lessor should be on the basis of the lessor’s normal depreciation policy for that class of assets leased out.
(c) The initial direct costs associated with the operating lease should be charged as incurred to the income statement.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline the treatment of finance lease in accounting for leases in the financial statements of the lessor.
3.3 Accounting for sale and lease back transactions (a) Where in a sale and lease-back transaction, an asset is sold at a price equal to or greater than the current market value and it is leased back for a term approximately the useful life of the asset and for payments that are sufficient to cover the new owner’s investment plus a reasonable return thereon, the transaction should be classified as a finance lease by the seller-lessee.
(b) If a sale and lease-back qualifies as a finance lease, the profit generated by the seller lessee should be deferred and amortized systematically over the useful life of the asset.
(c) Where a sale and lease-back qualifies as an operating lease, that is, when it does not meet the conditions of a finance lease, the profit generated by the seller-lessee should be deferred and amortised in proportion to the rental payments over the term of the lease.
(d) Where the market value of the asset is less than the carrying amount on the date of the sale and leaseback transaction, the difference should be charged immediately to the income statement of the seller-lessee.
Similarly, costs associated with the transaction, for example, legal and professional fees should be charged to the income statement.
Disclosures in Financial Statements of Lessee In addition to the disclosure requirements of SAS 2 information to be disclosed in financial statements and SAS 3-Accounting for property, plant and equipment, the following disclosures should be made: 63 (a) The amount and the major classes of assets being leased at the balance sheet date, liabilities and at the same time, differentiating between current and long-term portions of the liabilities.
(b) Commitments for minimum lease payments with a term in excess of one year, in summary, stating the amount and the yearly future payment due.
(c) Any significant restrictions, renewal or purchase options, contingent rentals and other contingencies arising from leases.
Disclosures in Financial Statements of a Lessor The following disclosures should be made in the financial statements of the lessor: (a) The gross investment in leases classified as finance leases, the related deferred income and the unguaranteed residual values of the leased assets be disclosed at the balance sheet date; (b) The net investment in leases, should be broken into current and non-current portions.
(c) The basis or bases used to allocate income; and (d) For assets under operating lease, the amount of assets under each category and the accumulated depreciation at the balance sheet date.
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES For illustrations on lease accounting, please refer to ACC311 and the implementation guide on lease accounting issued by the NASB.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline the disclosures made in the financial statement of the lessee.
3.4 Basic Definitions of Investment (a) Investments are assets by an enterprise for purpose of capital appreciation or income generation without activities in the form of production, trade, or provision of services.
(b) Short-term Investments are investments which are readily realisable and intended to be held for not more than one year.
(c) Long-term Investments are investments other than short-term investment.
(d) An Investment Property is an investment in land or building held primarily for generating income or capital appreciation and not occupied substantially for use, or in the operations of, the investing enterprises.
A property is deemed to be substantially occupied if the owner of another enterprise in the same group occupies more than 15% of the lettable space.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is an investment property?
3.5 Some Provisions of Statement of Accounting Standard 13 A reporting enterprise should classify its investments into short-term investments, long-term investments, and investment properties.
Short-term Investments (a) Short-term investments should be valued at the lower cost and market value.
The carrying amount should be determined on an item basis.
64 (b) The amount by which cost exceeds market value (unrealised loss) should be charged to the income statement for the period.
(c) Realised gains and losses on disposal of short-term investment should be taken to the income statement for the period of disposal.
Long-term Investments (a) Long-term investments should be carried at cost or at a revalued amount.
(b) When there has been a permanent decline in the value of an investment, the carrying amount of the investment should be written down to recognise the loss.
Such a reduction should be charged to the income statement.
Reduction in carrying amount may be reserved when there is an increase, other than temporary, in the value of the investment, or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist.
(c) An increase in carrying amount from the revaluation of long-term investments should be credited to owner’s equity as revaluation surplus.
To the extent that a decrease in carrying amount offsets a previous increase, for the same investment that has been credited to revaluation surplus and not subsequently reserved or utilized, it should be charged against that revaluation surplus rather than income.
(d) An increase on revaluation which is directly related to a previous decrease in carrying amount for the same investment that was charged to income, should be credited to the extent that it offsets the previously recorded decrease.
(e) When a reporting enterprise receives dividends that represent a distribution of earnings retained in the business prior to acquisition of stock in an investee company, such dividends should be treated as deduction from the cost of the investment.
(f) When a reporting enterprise receives interest on dated stock which includes interest accrued before the date of purchase, the relevant amount should be credited to acquisition cost and the portion of interest relating to post-acquisition period, should be credited to income statement.
(g) When an investment has been written down as earlier stated above, the new carrying amount is deemed to be the new basis for subsequent accounting purposes.
(h) Any discount or premium arising on acquisition of debt securities should be amortised over the period to maturity so that earnings from the investment would reflect a constant yield based on acquisition cost.
The amortised discount or premium should be credited or charged to income as though it were added to or subtracted from the carrying amount of the security.
The resulting carrying amount should then be regarded as cost.
Investment Properties (a) Every enterprise should have a policy on accounting for investment properties either in accordance with SAS No.
3 and SAS No.
9 or in accordance with this Standard as stated below.
(b) Investment properties should be carried in the balance sheet at their market value and revalue periodically on a systematic basis at least once three years.
(c) Investment properties should not be subject to periodic charges for depreciation.
(d) A decrease in carrying amount of an investment property should be treated in the manner specified earlier.
An increase in carrying amount should be treated in accordance with the provisions earlier provided.
65 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES Aspects of the requirements of this unit have been illustrated in ACC311.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is the provision of SAS 13 in respect of long-term investment?
4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion of this unit, we would state that Leasing is a process by which a firm can obtain the use of a certain fixed assets for which it must pay a series of contractual, periodic, tax deductible payments.
The lessee is the receiver of the services or the assets under the lease contract and the lessor is the owner of the assets.
The relationship between the tenant and the landlord is called a tenancy, and can be for a fixed or an indefinite period of time (called the term of the lease).
The consideration for the lease is called rent.
Investment is the commitment of money or capital to purchase financial instruments or other assets in order to gain profitable returns in the form of interest, income, or appreciation of the value of the instrument.
Investment is related to saving or deferring consumption.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed leases and accounting for investment according to the provision of Statement of Accounting Standard 11 and 13.
We discussed such issues as definitions of leases, some provision of SAS 11, accounting for sale and lease back transactions, basic definition of investment and some provisions of Statement of Accounting Standard 13.

The petroleum industry is very central in the Nigerian economy as petroleum is the main source of revenue for the Nation.
The industry plays a major role in facilitating the economic development of the nation.
Activities of the industry can be divided into two broad categories: upstream and downstream.
Upstream activities involve the acquisition of mineral interest in properties, exploration (including prospecting), development and production of crude oil and gas.
Downstream activities involve transporting, refining, and marketing of oil, gas and derivatives.
SAS 14 deals with accounting and reporting for upstream activities.
It does not cover the downstream activities.
The Statement of Accounting Standard 15 seeks to provide a guide for accounting policies and accounting methods that are to be followed by Non-Bank Financial Institutions, such as: (a) Financial Houses/Companies; (ii) Bureaux De Change; (iii) Mortgage Institutions; (iv) Discount houses; (v) Stock Broking Firms; and (vi) Other Capital Market Operators 2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Define the terms used in the Statement of Accounting Standard; 67 2.
Outline the provisions of Statement of Accounting Standard 14 and 15 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 14 The following terms are used in this Statement with the meanings specified: (a) Abandonment is the process of giving up further exploration activities in a well or field in which oil or gas has been found in commercial quantity.
This does not include capped (plugged) wells.
It can also relate to the giving up of production wells or field at the end of their productive lives.
(b) Acquisition costs are costs of acquiring concession rights in a lease area.
(c) Amortisation is used generically to mean the depreciation of tangible costs, depletion of mineral acquisition costs and intangible costs.
(d) Appraisal well is a well drilled to ascertain the commercial potentials of a reservoir discovered from explanatory activities.
(e) Barrel is a standard of measurement in the oil industry.
One barrel equals 42 U.S gallons (35 imperial gallons) at standard conditions.
(f) Bottom hole agreement refers to an agreement in which cash consideration or property is given to another party for his use in drilling a well on property in which the payer has no mineral rights, in exchange for technical information from the drilling of the well.
(g) Carried interest is a working interest arrangement involving two or more parties, in which a carrying party or the assignee finances the exploration and development activities in consideration for a reward out of future production (if any) and if necessary from the carried party’s or the assignor’s share of such future production.
The assignor is usually the carried party while the assignee is the carrying party.
A production sharing contract (PSC) is a form of carried interest.
(h) Casing Point is the point at which the drill has reached its objectives depth, in which case, determination can be made as to its productivity or otherwise.
(i) Ceiling test is a test to determine whether the recorded capitalised exploration, appraisal and development costs are recoverable from proved reserves.
(j) Commercial quantity is the quantity of oil or gas in reservoir that can be produced economically at current prices using existing technology.
The Petroleum Act 1969, however, defines commercial quantity as daily production of 10,000 barrels of crude oil.
(k) Completion is the process of bringing an oil or gas well into production.
The process begins only after the well has reached the depth where oil or gas is thought to exist, and generally involves installation of casing pipes, perforation of the casing pipes and acidizing and fracturing operations.

3.2 PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 14 The provisions of SAS 14 include the following: ACCOUNTING POLICY (a) All companies engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities, shall state in their financial statements, the policy for accounting for costs incurred and the manner of disposing of capitalised costs in respect of such activities.
In addition, the policy on accounting for restoration and abandonment cost and the total restoration and abandonment costs, should be disclosed in their financial statements, even if already included in cost of sales.
(b) A company may use either the “full cost” method or the “successful efforts” method.
The method used should be consistently applied and disclosed.
Classification of Costs Oil and gas producing activities involve special types of cost, which should be classified as follows: 70 (a) Mineral rights acquisition cost; (b) Exploration and drilling cost; (c) Development cost; (d) Production costs; (e) Support equipment and facilities costs; and (f) General costs FULL COST METHOD Initial treatment of cost Costs incurred on mineral rights acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development activities should be capitalised.
Amortisation of capital costs All capitalised costs incurred in a cost centre should be depreciated on the unit of production basis, using proved reserves.
The determination of the capitalised cost to be amortised should be on a country-wide basis.
Ceiling test (a) Ceiling tests should be conducted at least annually at balance sheet date on a country wide basis.
Such tests should use discounted values for revenue, costs, estimated future taxes, and estimated future development costs.
(b) The price used for the test should be that ruling at the balance sheet date, while the reserve used should be proved reserves.
Where the accounts are prepared in U.S dollars, the discount rate to be used for estimating future cash flow shall be ten percent.
Where accounts are prepared in Naira, the CBN rediscount rate should be used.
(c) If the net discounted revenue is lower than the capitalised costs the difference should be written off.
SUCCESSFUL EFFORT METHOD Initial treatment of costs (a) Cost incurred prior to acquisition of mineral rights and other exploration activities not specifically directed to an identifiable structure, should be expensed in the period they are incurred.
(b) All costs, incurred on mineral rights acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development activities should be capitalised initially on the basis of wells, field or exploration cost centres, pending determination.
Such costs, should be written off when it is determined that the well is dry.
Retention period pending determination If further appraisal of concession is planned, cost of exploration and appraisal activities may be carried forward pending determination of proved reserves in commercial quantities for a period of: (a) Not more than 3 years following completion of drilling in an offshore area where major development costs may need to be incurred, or (b) For a maximum of 2 years in an onshore area.
Amortisation of capitalised costs 71 (a) Mineral rights acquisition costs which have been allocated should be amortised over the remaining life of the licence.
Net book value not depreciated mineral rights acquisitions, should be reviewed annually for impairment on well-by well basis.
Any impairment discovered should be written off.
Amortisation of exploration and drilling costs incurred within each well, field or property, should be on a unit-of-production basis using proved developed reserves.
Cost of Providing Amenities for Communities Cost of providing amenities for communities in areas of operation should be written off as incurred.
Conveyances Recognition of gains or losses under conveyance should be as follows: (b) If the entire interest in an unproved property for which impairment is recorded on an individual basis is sold, gain or loss should be recorded to the extent of difference between the proceeds and net book value.
(c) If the entire interest in an unproved property for which impairment is recorded on a group basis is sold, no gain or loss is recognised unless the proceeds exceed the original cost of the lease.
(d) If a portion of interest in an unproved property for which individual impairment is recorded is sold, and the proceeds exceed the total carrying value should be recognised as a gain.
(e) If a portion of interest in an unproved property for which group impairment is recorded is sold and the proceeds exceed the total cost of the property, the excess of the proceeds over net book value of the group should be recognised as a gain.
(f) If the entire interest in an unproved property on which amortisation is individually computed is sold, the difference between the proceeds and a proportionate share of each cost and amortisation provision (net book value) should be recognised as a again or loss.
(g) If a portion of interest in an unproved property on which amortisation is individually computed is sold, the difference between the proceeds and a proportionate share of each cost and amortisation provision (book value) should be recognised as a gain or loss.

Joint Venture (a) The operator of a joint venture should maintain a separate set of books dedicated solely to recording the transactions relating to the venture.
(b) Each partner should account for its proportionate share of the costs, production, assets and liabilities of the joint venture in line with its accounting policy.
Over lifts and under lifts One of the following methods should be used to account for under lifts and over lifts: (a) Both under lifts and over lifts should be accrued for, under lifts should be included as stock, at the lower of cost or market value while over lifts, should be valued at year end at spot price.
(b) Invoiced sales should be adjusted to exclude over lifts at year end spot price and to include under lifts, at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Restoration and Abandonment (a) Companies should make provisions for restoration and abandonment costs less estimated salvage values, based on the best available estimate by: (i) a charge against income on system basis over the full productive lives of the facilities concerned, so that the accumulated provision will cover the cost of restoration and abandonment, or (ii) recognised the eventual liability at the outset, the corresponding debit, should be treated as a capital cost to be depreciated or as deferred expenses to be amortized, using the unit- of-production basis.
(b) Restoration and Abandonment costs should be deducted in arriving at estimated future net revenues for ceiling test calculations.
Farmout If the consideration for the farmout includes an arrangement for the farmee to bear subsequent, which would otherwise, fall to the retained interest of the farmor, the farmor should disclose the amount of such expenditure incurred by the farmee in aggregate during the accounting period, to provide an indication of the consideration received from the farmout.

4.0 CONCLUSION We are increasingly living in a global economy—with trade and inbound and outbound investment a fact of life.
It's no wonder, capital markets have long advocated for globally recognized accounting standards.
Until recently, that common accounting language has been a missing link.
Now, policymakers, lawmakers and regulators are working alongside standard-setters to provide a single set of high-quality, global accounting principles.
Accounting for international petroleum operations is very complex and involves different accounting methods being used according to the specific purpose.
Internationally, the United States was the first country to issue accounting standards specifically for oil and gas producers.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed the Statements of Accounting Standard 16 and 17.
Basically, the unit focuses on the provision of the Standard as it relates to issues in insurance business and petroleum industry, downstream activities.

In financial accounting, a cash flow statement, also known as statement of cash flows or funds flow statement, is a financial statement that shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing, and financing activities.
Essentially, the cash flow statement is concerned with the flow of cash in and cash out of the business.
The statement captures both the current operating results and the accompanying changes in the balance sheet.
As an analytical tool, the statement of cash flows is useful in determining the short-term viability of a company, particularly its ability to pay bills.
The Statement of Accounting standard 19 discusses the computation and presentation of the different taxes imposed on business companies, such as, company income tax, petroleum profits tax, value added tax, and capital gains tax.
It also covers education tax and deferred taxes.
Under section 355 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap.
C20 LFN 2004, companies are allowed to publish abridged financial statements if they wish.
The Act, however, does not specify any minimum disclosure requirement of such statements.
Statement of Accounting Standard 20 has filled the gap by specifying the minimum contents of such financial statements.

It reveals how cash is generated from operations or through new capital raised and how payments are made for taxes, dividends, new investments and debts.
It is designed to shed light on an enterprise’s financial strength.
Definition The following terms are used in this statement with the meanings specified: (a) Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits denominated in naira and foreign currencies.

Preparation and Format (a) A reporting enterprise should prepare a statement of cash flows in line with the provisions of this standard as an integral part of its financial statements.
(b) The statement of cash flows should include all cash inflows and outflows of the enterprise during a reporting period.
It should however, exclude cash flows arising from the purchase and liquidation of cash equivalents.
(c) An enterprise should report its cash flows according to the activity which gave rise to them and the cash flows should be grouped under the broad headings of operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
(d) An enterprise should use either the direct or indirect method in preparing its statement of cash flows.

(e) The statement of cash flows should report gross cash flows except in the instances where net cash flows would be more relevant and meaningful, (i) where the enterprise is, in substance, holding or disbursing cash on behalf of its customer; and (ii) where turnover of investments and loans is rapid and the total volume of transactions is large.
Interest paid and received 89 (a) Interest paid should be classified as cash flow from financing activities while interest received should be classified as cash flow from investing activities.
The interest element of finance lease rental payments should be shown separately by the lessee.

There should be sufficient disclosure of the nature of each item, by way of note to the financial statements.
Acquisition and Disposal of Entities The cash flow of effects of acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and other business units should be classified as investing activities and presented separately in the statement of cash flows.
The details required should be presented in aggregate for all entities acquired or disposed off during the financial year.
Major Non-Cash Transactions Non-cash transactions of a reporting entity should not be incorporated in the statement of cash flows.

3.4 SOME PROVISION OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 20: ABRIDGED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Summary of the Provisions of SAS 20 are as follows.
(a) A company need not publish abridged financial statements.
If it does, however, such financial statements should comply with this standard.
(b) Abridged financial statements should carry a declaration that: (i) they are abridged financial statements; (ii) the financial statements and specific disclosures included in them have been derived from the full financial statements of the company; (iii) the abridged financial statements cannot be expected to provide as full an understanding of the financial performance, financial position, and financial and investing activities of the organization as full financial statements; and (iv) copies of the full financial statements can be obtained from the registrar of the company.

(c) Comparative information Information for the preceding corresponding financial year which corresponds to the disclosures made in accordance with this standard for current financial year must be disclosed.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What should be disclosed in abridged financial statement?
4.0 CONCLUSION Complementing the balance sheet and income statement, the cash flow statement (CFS), a mandatory part of a company's financial reports since 1987, records the amounts of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a company.
The CFS allows investors to understand how a company's operations are running, where its money is coming from, and how it is being spent.
Government are expected to maintain economic stability, full employment, reduce income inequality & promote growth and development.
Tax system should be such that it meets the requirements of growing state activities.
Where a company elects to file abridged financial statements with the Companies Registration Office, the information required to be disclosed in the notes to those abridged financial statements is prescribed in section 12 of the Companies Amendment Act 1986.
96 However, notwithstanding the provisions of section 12, the overriding consideration above all others is that the abridged financial statements are required to give a ‘true and fair view’ of the state of the company’s affairs.
Accordingly, in order to ensure that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs, it will, under certain circumstances, be necessary for companies to provide disclosure over and above that required by section 12 in the notes to their abridged financial statements.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed the Statement of Accounting Standard 18, 19 and 20.

Earnings per share (EPS) are one of the important ratios used by existing and potential investors to assess businesses.
EPS is so important that the NASB and the IASB have singled it out for standardisation.
The significance of this ratio stems from its usefulness in calculating price/earnings ratio, and the basis for comparison between companies and relevant periods.
Research refers to the original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantial improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services prior to the commencement of commercial production or use.
If it is possible to distinguish the research phase from the development phase of an internal project, the entity treats the expenditure on that project as if it were incurred on the research phase only.
Activities of many organizations cut across different classes of businesses and geographical boundaries of their businesses, where such businesses are significantly affected by the different classes or geographical boundaries.
Financial statements are means of communicating information on the resources, obligations, and performance of a reporting entity.
Therefore, the information contained therein, should enable users to understand the risks and conditions which have affected or may affect the performance and financial position of the entity.
98  2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Define the terms used in Statement of Accounting Standard 21.

State some of the provisions in Statement of Accounting Standard 22 4.
State some of the provisions in Statement of Accounting Standard 23 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 21: Earnings per Share The following terms are used in this statement with the meanings specified: (a) Adjusted Earnings Per Share This refers to the figure carried in a financial statement as earnings per year for previous years after recalculating the EPS of such years, using the outstanding shares of the company as at the latest balance sheet date as a common denominator all the years.
(b) Basic Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.
(c) Bonus Shares A bonus share is a share in respect of which purchase consideration is satisfied by capitalising existing reserves, which already belong to the shareholders.
It is the formal recognition of the increase in the capital invested by those shareholders.
It is also referred to as a stock dividend.
(d) Convertible securities Convertible securities are financial instruments that confer holders with the right to receive a determinable number of ordinary shares or other securities in satisfaction of their claim at determinable future dates or period.
(e) Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share are the amount of earnings per share after adjusting for the effect of all potential ordinary shares.
(f) Options and Warrants An option is the right to deal in the security of an entity at a fixed price during a specific period of time.
An option can either be a call option or a put option: (i) a call option is a right given by one party to another to buy a security at a fixed price during a specific period of time.
(ii) a put option is a right given by one party to another to sell a security at a fixed price during a specific period of time.
A warrant is a certificate by a company, which gives its holders the right to purchase its shares at fixed price within a specific period of time.
Warrants are prohibited in Nigeria by Section 149(1) of the CAMA, Cap.
C20 LFN, 2004.
(g) Ordinary Shares An ordinary share represents a unit of the ownership interest in a company, which entitles its holder to participate in the earnings, dividends and assets of the company after other interests have been settled.
99 (h) Potential Ordinary Shares A potential ordinary share is a financial instrument or any other contract, which could: (i) be converted into an ordinary share; or (ii) result in the calling of, or subscription for, ordinary share capital at a fixed price within a specified period of time.
(i) Preference Shares A preference share is an equity instrument that has claim to a company’s earnings, dividends and assets before the ordinary share but after the debt obligations and could be redeemed without a court order or the dissolution of the company either by winding up or liquidation.
(j) Publicly Traded Shares A publicly traded share is a share of company which can be transferred without the prior consent of its directors and may or may not be listed on a recognised stock exchange or other public securities market.
(k) Rights Issue A right issue is a privileged issue of the securities of a company, at a price, to its existing shareholders on the basis of their existing shareholdings.
(l) Share Consolidation Share consolidation, also called reverse split, take place when the number of the outstanding shares in a company is reduced by increasing the par (normal) value of each share.
(m) Share Split: Share split takes place when the number of the outstanding shares in a company is increased by reducing the par value of each share.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is the difference between ordinary shares and preference shares?
3.2 COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE (a) In calculating earnings per share, an enterprise should not include extraordinary items before arriving at profit after tax.
(b) Potential ordinary shares should be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease net profit per share from continuing ordinary operations.
(c) The amount of net profit attributable to preference shareholders including preference dividend for the period should be deducted from the net profit (or added to the net loss) in calculating the net profit or net loss for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders.
(d) In order to determine earnings for EPS calculation, the full dividend for the year on cumulative preference shares, should be deducted (the net amount) from the net profit or added to the net loss, whether or not it has been earned or declared, while only the actual dividend paid or proposed on non-cumulative preference shares should be deducted from the net profit.
(e) A weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period should be used as a denominator for the earnings per share calculation.
Shares issued during the year included in the weighted average number of shares should reflect the date the consideration was received.
100 (f) In calculating diluted earnings per share, the number of shares should be determined as the total of the following: (i) the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
(ii) potential ordinary shares of the entity outstanding as at the beginning of the financial year that remain outstanding as at the reporting date that are dilutive.
(iii) potential ordinary shares issued during the financial year that are dilutive, weighted by reference to the number of days from the date of issue of those potential ordinary shares to the reporting date of issue of those potential ordinary shares to the reporting date as a proportion of the total number of days in the financial year.
(iv) potential ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year that are dilutive and have been converted or have lapsed or cancelled during the year, weighted by reference to the number of days from the beginning of the financial year to the date of conversion lapse or cancellation.
ILLUSTRATION 12 Eggon Plc has a capital structure made up of: N 2,000,000 ordinary shares of N2:00 each 4,000,000 Retained Earnings 8,500,000 10% debentures 2,500,000 15,000,000 In the last three months, the market value of the company’s shares has remained at N5:00 per share.
Its current year’s profit after tax is N10,000,000.
Eggon Plc has decided to pay 25% stock dividend to its shareholders from the current year’s profit.
You required to show the effect of this on: (i) the market price of the company’s share; and (ii) the earnings per share SUGGESTED SOLUTION 12 (i) effect of the stock dividend on the market price of the company’s share will be: Current market price per share is N5:00 Total market value of the shares is 2,000,000 x N5:00 (i.e.
N10,000,000) 25% stock dividend = 25% of N10,000,000 = N2,500,000 = N2,500,000/2, that is 1,250,000 new shares at N2:00 per share With stock dividends, the total number of shares becomes 3,250,000.
Since the total market value is N10,000,000, the market price per share will be N10,000,000/3,250,000 per share i.e.
N3:08 per share.
101 Market price per share is expected to reduce to N3:08 (ii) Effect on earnings per share will be as follows: EPS prior to stock dividend = N10,000,000/2,000,000 = N5:00 per share EPS after stock dividend will be: 7,500,000/3,250,000 = N2:31 That is, EPS has fallen from N5:00 to N2:31 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline how you compute earnings per share.
3.3 SOME PROVISIONS OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 22: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Cost of elements should be separated into: (a) Research costs; and (b) Development cost.
Research costs include: (a) The costs (including VAT) of materials and services consumed in research activity; (b) Specific labour costs attributive to research activity; (c) The cost of software and equipment acquired for research purposes; (d) The cost of borrowed rights; (e) The cost of information or technical services; (f) The depreciation charge for equipment and facilities to the extent that they are used for research activities; (g) The amortization charge for other assets, such as patents and licences, to the extent that they are related to research; and (h) Shared costs only in terms of benefits to the parties sharing the costs or costs agreed by the same parties for research based on requests.
Development costs include: (a) The cost of evaluating products or process alternatives; (b) The cost of design, construction, and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models; (c) The cost of design of tools, jigs, moulds, and dies involving new technology; (d) The cost of design, construction, and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible for production; and (e) The cost of design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.
If it is not possible to distinguish the research phase from the development phase of an internal project, the entity shall treat the expenditure on the product as if it were incurred in the research phase only.
Accounting Treatment of Research and Development Costs 102 (a) Research and development costs shall be separated into research costs and development costs.
The amount of research costs shall be expensed in the period in which they are incurred and development costs should be deferred to the extent that they meet the criteria for deferral.
(b) For an entity to defer development costs, the following criteria must be satisfied: (i) the product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be separately identified and measured reliability; (ii) the technical feasibility of the product or process has been demonstrated; (iii) the management of the entity has indicated its intention to produce and market, or use, the product or process; (iv) adequate resources exist, or are reasonably expected to be available, to complete the project and market the product or process.
(v) the current and future cost to be deferred are material; and (vi) there is a reasonable indication that current costs, future research and development costs to be incurred, together with unamortized deferred costs in relation to that project, are expected beyond any reasonable doubt to be recoverable.
(c) A reporting entity shall state its accounting policy with respect to research and development costs.
Where an accounting policy of deferral of development costs is adopted, it shall be applied to all such projects that meet the criteria.
(d) Where development costs of a project are deferred, they shall be allocated on a systematic basis to future accounting periods by reference to either the scale or use of the product or process or to the period over which the product or process is expected to be sold or used.
(e) Where development costs are deferred, the amortization shall not exceed five years from the inception of the benefits; (f) The deferred development costs of a project shall be reviewed at the end of each accounting period, and the following steps taken; (i) when the criteria are no longer met, the unamortized balance shall be written off as an expense immediately; (ii) when the other criteria for deferral continue to be met but that amount of unamortized balance of the deferred development costs and other relevant costs exceed the expected future revenues or benefits relate thereto, such excess shall be charged as expense immediately; and (iii) if for any reason, research and/or development activities are suspended or postponed on account of lack of resources, time or other contingencies, the unamortized balance shall be written off immediately.
Accounting Treatment of Grants Received in Relation to Research and Development (a) Where a grant is received or receivable in relation to research and development cost which have been charged to the profit and loss account during the period or in a prior financial year, the grant shall be credited to the profit and loss account; (b) Where a grant is received or receivable in relation to development costs which have been deferred, the grant shall be deducted from the unamortized balance; and (c) Development costs which did not previously meet the criteria for deferral and were charged to the profit and loss account shall not be written back in the light of subsequent events.
103 DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS In addition to the disclosure requirements of SAS 2, the financial statements of an entity shall disclose: (a) The accounting policies adopted for research and development costs; (b) The amount of research costs and development recognised as an expense in the period; (c) The amortization methods used as regards development costs; (d) The useful lives or amortization rates used; and (e) A reconciliation of the unamortized development costs at the beginning and end of the period, showing: (i) development costs recognised as an asset; (ii) development costs recognised as an expense; (iii) development costs allocated to other asset accounts; and (f) The grants received in respect of research and development, the amount received or receivable and the source(s).
ILLUSTRATION 13 Major Oil Plc is about to acquire another oil company, Peanut Oil Limited, for N700 million.
The consideration includes a purchase of four years’ profits.
You are also given the following information: PEANUTS OIL LIMITED FINANCIAL SUMMARIES 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 N’m N’m N’m N’m N’m Sales - 70 142 194 270 Expenses (75) (72) (108) (121) (130) Net profit/(loss) (75) (2) 34 73 140 Fixed Assets 270 274 302 310 300 Current Assets 35 29 35 100 220 305 303 337 410 520 In 2004, Peanuts Ltd spent N12 million in obtaining licence to prospect for oil in Nigeria for an initial period of 20 years.
In 2006, the company formulated a brand of engine oil for N24 million to lead the market.
Industry analyst predicted that this brand of engine oil would remain dominant for 10 years.
The licensing and brand development costs were written off in the year of expenditure.
You are required to: 104 (a) Advise on the treatment of licensing and development costs in the accounts and draft a suitable accounting policy for the two items.
(b) Assess the offer of N700 million for the company by Major Oil Plc.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 13 (a) It is not proper to write off licensing and brand development costs in the year of expenditure.
The proper treatment should be to write off licensing costs over 20 years and brand development cost over 10 years.
(i) Accounting Policies Licensing fees These are written off over the expected useful life of the licence on a straight line basis.
(ii) Research and Development Research costs are written off in the year of expenditure and development costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the product.
(b) Assessment of the offer of N700 million: Since licensing fees and brand development costs should be spread over their useful lives, the accounts should be reconstructed.
(i) licensing fees written off over 20 years N12 m /20 = N600,000 per annum (ii) brand development costs written off over 10 years 24/10 = N2,400,000 per annum PEANUTS OIL LIMITED FINANCIAL SUMMARIES 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 N’m N’m N’m N’m N’m Net profit (75) (2) 34 73 140 Add back - 12 - 24 - Less (0.6) (0.6) (3) (3) (3) (75.6) (2.6) 31 70 137 Value of intangible assets License = 12m – (0.6 x 5) = N9m Brand developments = (24m – N2.4m x 3) = N16.8 Total = N9m + N16.8m = N25.8m Therefore net assets in 2008 becomes Net assets 520m Added intangible assets 25.8m Adjusted net assets N545.8m Four years purchase of goodwill Average profit = (75.6 + (2.6) + 31 + 70 + 137/5 = N31.96m 105 Four years purchase = N31.96 x 4 = N127.84m Therefore fair purchase consideration = net assets + goodwill That is = N(545.8m + 127.84m) = N673.64m It is therefore, not a fair bargain if Peanuts Oil limited could be acquired for only N700m.
The present value of the company is N26.36 million lower than the purchase consideration.

3.4 SOME PROVISIONS OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 23: PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS Meaning of Provisions Provisions are liabilities that have arisen or are likely to arise in respect of a previous or current financial year.
Such liabilities are charges against incomes and they often have substantial effect on an entity’s financial position and performance.
Due to the uncertainties surrounding the timing of events that may give rise to provisions and actual amount of liabilities involved, there is need to ensure uniformity and completeness in the manner in which such provisions are recognised and measured in financial statements.
It is also of utmost important that sufficient information is provided in the financial statements to enable users understand their nature, timing and amounts.
Relationship between Provisions and Contingent Liabilities All provisions are usually contingent since they are uncertain in timing or amount.
The term, “contingent”, is used for liabilities as well as for assets, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
The term, “contingent liability”, is used for liabilities, that do not meet the recognition criteria of a “provision”.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES A contingent liability is either a possible obligation arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity’s control, or a present obligation that arises from past events that it is probable a transfer of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A provision shall be recognised when: (a) An entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event; (b) If it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If these conditions are not met, no provision shall be recognised.
The amount recognised as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
106 The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances shall be taken into account in arriving at the best estimate of the provision.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be the present value of the expenditure expected to settle the obligation.
Contingent Liabilities A contingent liability is (a) A possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or (b) A present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability or it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Contingent liabilities should not be provided for in the accounts.
If it is probable that transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle that obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient liabilities, a disclosure should be made in the financial statements.
Contingent Assets A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past event(s) and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
An entity should not recognise a contingent asset in its financial statements.
If it is probable that future economic benefits will flow, the entity and the amount can be measured with sufficient reliability, a disclosure should be made in the financial statements.
Onerous Contract (a) If an entity has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract should be recognised and measured as a provision.
(b) A constructive organization to restructure arise only when an entity: (i) has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring, identifying at least;  The business or part of the business concerned;  The principal locations affected;  The location, function and approximate number of employees  Who will be compensated for terminating their services;  The expenditure that will be undertaken; and  When the plan will be implemented; and (ii) has raised a valid expectation in those affected.

4.0 CONCLUSION 107 In conclusion, we would state that earnings per share are generally considered to be the single most important variable in determining a share's price.
It is also a major component used to calculate the price-to-earnings valuation ratio.
The term 'research and development' is used to cover a wide range of activities, including those in the services sector.
Classification of expenditure is often dependent on the type of business and its organisation.
However, it is generally possible to recognise three broad categories of activity, namely pure research, applied research and development.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed Statement of Accounting Standard 21: Earning per Share, Statement of Accounting Standard 22: Research and Development, and Statement of Accounting Standard 23: Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.
A contingent liability is either a possible obligation arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity’s control, or a present obligation that arises from past events that it is probable a transfer of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past event(s) and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.

Business segment means a distinguishable component of an entity, where such component is engaged in providing a product or service, or a group of related products or services that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
The substantial amount of resources deployed in the telecommunications industry and the peculiarity of its operations necessitates the development of an accounting standard to ensure uniformity in the reporting pattern of entities engaged in it.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying the unit, you should be able to: 1.
Identify reportable segment according to Statement of Accounting Standard 24.
2.
Compute the present value of the de-commissioning cost.
3.
Compute the liability at the end of each year and changes in liability.
4.
Calculate the depreciation charges on the equipment.
5.
Prepare fixed asset schedule.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 SOME PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 24: SEGMENT REPORTING Scope This statement applies to all entities that carry on different classes of businesses or operate in different geographical areas.
Identification of Business Segments In determining business segments, a reporting entity would need to consider factors which include: (a) Existing profit centres; 109 (b) The nature of the product or service; (c) The nature of the production process; (d) Markets and marketing methods; and (e) The nature of the regulatory environment, for example, bank, insurance, oil and gas, public utilities, etc.
Organizational groupings such as divisions, subsidiaries, or branches, are ordinarily created according to management requirements.
Such groupings often correspond with the determinable segments of the entity, thus facilitating segment reporting.
Where this is not the case, segment reporting may require reclassification of data.
It is relevant to consider the interrelationships among an entity’s activities.
For example, it may be potentially misleading to report as separate business segment, parts of an entity’s activities that are significantly integrated or interdependent.
Identification of Geographical Segments Operations of a reporting entity will only classify as operations of a geographical segment if they extend beyond facilitating export sales or services from the reporting entity’s domestic operations.
If the product were substantially manufactured, assembled or acquired in the overseas county, the activities would be classified as geographical segment.
Factors that are usually considered in identifying geographical segments include: (a) Similarity of economic and political conditions; (b) Relationships between operations in different geographical areas; (c) Proximity of operations; (d) Special risks associated with operations in a particular areas; (e) Exchange control regulations; and (f) The underlying currency risks.
Determining Material Business and Geographical Segments After entity has been divided into business and geographical segments, it is necessary to decide whether particular segments are material and so warrant separate reporting.
The materiality of a segment to the entity as a whole, can be measured in terms of its revenue, results, or assets employed.
A segment would be considered material if one or more of the following conditions apply: (a) Its revenue is 10 percent or more of the total revenue of all segments; or (b) Its segment result, whether profit or loss, is 10 percent or more of the combined result of all segments in profit or the combined result or all segments in loss, whichever is the greater in absolute amount; or (c) Its assets are 10 percent or more of the total assets of all segments; or (d) Where it is required by regulatory authorities.
To provide an adequate insight into the entity’s operations, it is necessary for the material segments to represent a substantial proportion of total operations.
This is deemed to be the case where the total revenue from sales of all material segments to the segments outside customers, constitutes 75 percent or more of the entity’s external revenue.
Where this materiality test has not been met, the entity should identify more segments, even if the additional segments do not meet the ten percent threshold as specified above.
110 If an entity has two or more classes of businesses, or operations in two or more geographical segments which differ substantially from each other, it should define its classes of businesses and geographical segments in its financial statements, and it shall report with respect to each class of business and geographical segment, the following financial information: (a) Revenue or turnover, distinguishing between: (i) revenue or turnover derived from external customers; and (ii) revenue or turnover derived from other segments; (b) Result, before accounting for taxation, minority interests and extraordinary items; and (c) Net assets.
A business or geographical segment shall be identified as a reportable segment if a majority of its revenue is earned from sales to external customers and: (a) Its revenue is earned from sales to external customers and from transactions with other segments is 10 percent or more of the total revenue, external or internal, of all segments; or (b) Its segment result, whether profit or loss, is 10 percent or more of the combined result of all segments in profit or loss, is 10 percent or more of the combined result of all segments in profit or the combined result of all segments in loss, whichever is greater in absolute amount; or (c) Its assets are 10 percent or more of the total assets of all segments Disclosure Requirements The total of the amounts disclosed by segments should agree with the related total in the entity’s financial statements.
Otherwise, the reporting entity shall provide reconciliation between the two amounts.
Reconciling items shall be properly identified and adequately disclosed.
Revenue from both external and internal sources shall be disclosed with the latter shown on the basis of internal transfer prices.
Any change in the basis for such transfer prices shall also be disclosed.
Where inter-segment sales and transfers constitute a material part of the total revenue of the reportable segments, they shall be analyzed in segments and shown separately.
The geographical analysis of inter-short-term investment or turnover shall be disclosed.
ILLUSTRATION 14 Polo Plc operates in five geographical segments and ten business segments.
Data relating to the geographical segments for the year ended 31 December 200X9, are as follows: Aba Gboko Edo Warri Kano N’000 N’000 N’000 N’000 N’000 Total revenue from sales 6,000 2,000 8,000 9,000 7,000 Sales to external customers 4,000 1,200 3,500 6,000 4,000 Sales to other segments 2,000 800 4,500 3,000 3,000 Segment results 9,600 3,000 9,700 9,200 (6,000) 111 Assets 9,800 2,100 9,200 7,100 4,800 Identify the reportable geographical segment in accordance with SAS 24.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 14 Step 1 The first step in determining a reportable segment is to identify the segments that earn majority of their revenue from sales to external customers.
Segment % of sales to external customers Qualify?
Aba 4,000/6,000 X 100 = 67% Yes Gboko 1,200/2,000 X 100 = 60% Yes Edo 3,500/8000 X 100 = 44% No Warri 6,000/9,000 X 100 = 67% Yes Kano 4,000/7,000 X 100 = 57% Yes Step 2 Apply the 10% Rule The next step is to apply the 10% rule according to SAS 24.40 N’000 N’000 Revenue test 10% of total revenue: 10/100 X N32,000 3,200 Profit or loss test Higher of 10% of total profit and total loss: 10% of total profit [0.1 x (9,600 + 3,000 + 9,700 + 9,200)] 3,150 10% of total loss (0.1 x 6,000) 600 Asset test 10% x N33,000 3,300 Segments that meet the 10% rule are Aba, Warri and Kano.
Step 3: apply the 75% rule The total revenue of the three reportable segments based on step 2 is N22 million (6m +9m + 7m).
this is only 68% of the total revenue.
Calculate as follows: 22/32 x 100.
SAS 24.22 requires that it the proportion of reportable segments’ revenue is not up to 75%, more segments should be identified even though they do not meet the 10% rule.
Therefore, the reportable segments will include Gboko.

3.2 SOME PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 25: TELECOMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES FIXED ASSETS De- commissioning Costs The present value of management’s best estimate (based on annual probability analysis) of the cost of de-commissioning and dismantling a site at the time of installation, shall be included in the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Any subsequent change to this estimate shall be added to, or deducted from, the item’s cost.
The carrying amount shall be added to, or deducted from, the item’s cost.
The carrying amount shall then be subsequently depreciated over its remaining useful life.
Over the passage of time, the corresponding liability shall be adjusted for the time value of money.
Such increases in the liability shall be recognised as an interest expense in the profit and loss account of each period.
The liability shall also be adjusted to record the effects of any reinstatements/disposal and the corresponding payments/realization of de-commissioning costs.
ILLUSTRATION 15 The management of NEWTEL Ltd has estimated that a de-commissioning cost of N665,500 will be incurred at the end of three years in respect of a new equipment installed on 1st January 20X5.
The management has further estimated that a discount rate of 10% will give the present value of the de- commissioning cost at 1 January 20X5.
You are required to: (a) Compute the present value of the de-commissioning cost to be included in the property, plant and equipment of NEWTEL Ltd on 1 January 20X5.
(b) Compute the liability at the end of each year and changes in liability to be recognised as an interest expense in profit or loss are required by SAS 25.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 15 (a) Given a discount rate of 10% and a three year period, the present value of N665,500 would be 1/(1.1)3 x N665,500 = 1/1.331 x 665,500 = N500,000 Therefore, N500,000 will be included in the cost of equipment of NEWTEL Ltd on 1 January 20X5 and the carrying amount of the equipment will be depreciated over its useful life as required by SAS 25.
(b) SAS 25 also requires that the reporting entity should recognise a corresponding liability which should be adjusted for the time value of money.
The increases in liability should be recognised as interest expenses in the income statement for each period.
One way to easily obtain the liability at the end of the year and the increases in liability, is to unwind the interest as follows: N Liability at 1 January 20 x 5 500,000 Discount for 20 x 5 (10% x 500,000) 50,000 113 Liability at 31 December 20 x 5 550,000 Discount for 20 x 6 (10% x 550,000) 55,000 Liability at 31 December 20 x 6 605,000 Discount for 20 x 7 (10% x 605,000) 60,500 Liability at 31 December 20 x 7 665,500 Tutorial Observe that the liability increases with the passage of time.
SAS 25 requires that the increases should be recognised as interest expense in the profit and loss account of each period.
Thus, the amount to be recognised as interest expense each year would be: 20X5, N50,000; 20X6, N55,000 and 20X7, N60,500.
Commencement of Depreciation of Network Assets Depreciation of network assets shall commence when an asset is available for use, irrespective of whether it is actually used or not.
Component Accounting Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be separately depreciated.
An entity shall allocate the amount initially recognised in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment to its significant parts and depreciate them separately.
A significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment that has a useful life and depreciation methods that are the same as those of another significant part of that same item, shall be grouped in determining the depreciation charge.
To the extent that an entity depreciates separately some parts of an item of property, plant and equipment.
It also shall depreciate separately the reminder of the item.
The remainder consists of the parts of the item that are individually not significant.
If an entity has varying expectations of these parts, approximation techniques shall be applied to depreciate the remainder in a manner that faithfully represents the consumption pattern and/or useful life of the parts.
Stand-by equipment and strategic spares shall be depreciated over the expected useful life of similar equipment in use.
ILLUSTRATION 16 All peoples Network, a newly established telecommunication company in Nigeria, acquired special telecommunication equipment for N500 million on 1 January 20X7.
The equipment has three major components, which for ease of reference, may be referred to as component A, component B, and component C. The estimated useful life of the entire component is 20 years, but component A will need to be replaced after 5 years, component B after 7 years and component C after 10 years.
The cost price of N500 million included N20 million, N42 million and N50 million, for components A, B, and C, respectively.
114 You are required to calculate the depreciation charge on the equipment for 20X7.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 16 SAS 25 requires separate depreciation charge for each major component of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Therefore, the depreciation charge on the equipment will be calculated as follows: Nm Component A 20m/5years 4 Component B 42m/7years 6 Component C 50m/10 5 The rest of the equipment N388/20years 19.4 34.4 INTANGIBLES Subscriber Acquisition costs relate exclusively to an explicit contract, they may be capitalized if and only if: (a) The operator controls by means of an enforceable contract, future economic benefits as a result of the costs incurred; (b) It is probable that those future economic benefits will eventuate; and (c) The costs are specific to the particular contract and can be measured reliably.
Subscriber acquisition costs, other than those dealt with above, shall be expensed as incurred.
Capitalized acquisition costs shall be amortized over the specific period of the contract.
If a contract for which subscriber acquisition costs have been capitalized is terminated early, then the net book value of the intangible asset shall be regarded as impaired.
Amortization of Licence Fee Amortization of license fee may commence from either the date of issuance of licence or date of commercial launch.
However, the amortization period shall not exceed expiration date of the licence and shall be calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated period.
If the recoverable amount of an asset, such as licence fee, is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced to its recoverable amount.
That reduction is an impairment loss.
An impairment loss shall be recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
After the recognition of an impairment loss, the amortization charge for the asset shall be adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Co-location Arrangements A seller of a right to use capacity shall not report the transaction as sale of an asset, or of a component of a large asset, but as a rental income which is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the Indefeasible Right to Use (IRU), unless: (a) The purchaser’s right of use is exclusive and irrevocable; 115 (b) The asset component is specific and separable (such that the buyer’s exclusivity is guaranteed and the seller has not right to substitute other assets); (c) The term of the contract is for a major part of the asset’s useful life; (d) The attributable cost or carrying value can be measured reliably; and (e) No significant risks, as indicated in paragraph 30, are retained by the seller.
Interconnection Cost Interconnection cost shall be calculated at the agreed regulated rate of the charges (gross) and recognised by the originating operator (who has an obligation to pay a terminating operator for terminating calls on its network) as incurred.
Exchange Transactions An entity that sells capacity on its network to another entity, shall recognise the revenue (gross) as earned.
Similarly, an entity that purchases capacity on the network of another entity, shall recognise the cost (gross) as incurred.
Where there is exchange of airtime for any transaction of a financial nature, but without inflow or outflow of cash, such exchange shall be governed by a written agreement and accounted for by the transacting parties.
Where the exchange or reciprocal transactions entered into for capacity is such that the transacting parties had no current need and where the subject of the transaction will otherwise be saleable, non-accounting recognition shall be given.
Bundled Product The revenue recognition criteria shall be applied separately to each transaction.
However, in certain circumstances, where it is necessary to apply the recognition criteria to the separately identifiable components of a single transaction in order to reflect the substance of the transition, the bundled products shall be properly itemised and revenue recognition criteria shall apply to them separately.
Where there is a discount on a bundled product, the discount shall be prorated and applied on all the elements of the bundled product’s cost.

ILLUSTRATION 18 On 31 December 20X9,Power Plc, acquired 12 million shares of the 15 million shares of Sweet Plc for N30 million.
On that date, the acquirer, Sweet Plc, had retained earnings amounting to N4 million and the fair value of its net assets was N19 million.
You are required to calculate the goodwill on acquisition in accordance with SAS 26.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 18 Step 1 Calculate the proportion acquired.
118 Proportion of interest acquired by powder Plc is 80% obtained as follows: 12 million shares divided by 15 million shares multiplied by 100.
Step 2 Calculate the non-controlling interest (NCI).
Non-controlling interest in the equity of the acquire is calculated as follows: N’000 Ordinary shares 15,000 Retained earnings 4,000 Total equity 19,000 NCI = N19M x 20% = N3.8m Step 4 Calculate the goodwill in accordance with SAS 26 N’000 Consideration transferred 30,000 Non-controlling interest 3,800 33,800 Net assets acquired 19,000 Goodwill 14,800 Contingent Considerations Some changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that the acquirer recognises after the acquisition date may be the result of additional information that the acquirer obtained after that date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Such changes are measurement period adjustments in accordance with paragraphs 45 – 49 of SAS 26.
However, changes resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as meeting an earnings target, reaching a specified share price or reaching a milestone on a research and development project, are not measurement period adjustments.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Explain what you understand by a de-commissioning cost and an interconnection cost.
119 4.0 CONCLUSION A business segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a group of related products or services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The dominant source and nature of risks and returns of an enterprise should govern whether its primary segment reporting format will be business segments or geographical segments.
If the risks and returns of an enterprise are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services it produces, its primary format for reporting segment information should be business segments, with secondary information reported geographically.
Similarly, if the risks and returns of the enterprise are by the fact that it operates in different countries or other geographical areas, its primary format for reporting segment information should be geographical segments, with secondary information reported for groups of related products and services.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed Statement of accounting Standard 24: Segment Reporting and Statement of Accounting Standard 25: Telecommunication Activities.
In determining business segments, a reporting entity would need to consider factors which include: Existing profit centres; the nature of the product or service; the nature of the production process; Markets and marketing methods; and the nature of the regulatory environment, for example, bank, insurance, oil and gas, public utilities, etc.
The present value of management’s best estimate (based on annual probability analysis) of the cost of de-commissioning and dismantling a site at the time of installation, shall be included in the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Any subsequent change to this estimate shall be added to, or deducted from, the item’s cost.
The carrying amount shall be added to, or deducted from, the item’s cost.
The carrying amount shall then be subsequently depreciated over its remaining useful life.

Specifically, we shall be discussing Statement of Accounting Standard 26: Business Combinations, Statement of Accounting Standard 30: Interim Financial Reporting, International Accounting Standard 1: Presentation of Financial Statements, International Accounting Standard 10: Events after the Reporting Period, and International Accounting Standard 18: Revenue.
A business combination is the bringing together of separate entities or businesses into one reporting entity.
The result of nearly all business combinations is that one entity, the acquirer, obtains control of one or more other businesses, the acquirees.
Events after the reporting period is a favourable or unfavourable event that occurs between the end of the reporting period and the date that the financial statements are authorized for issue.
121 IAS 18 prescribes the accounting treatment for revenue arising from sale of goods and other operating activities of the enterprise.
Generally, revenue is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to an enterprise, and the amount of revenue can be measured with reliability.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.
State some of the provisions concerning business combinations according to SAS 26.
2.
State some of the provisions concerning interim financial reporting according to SAS 30.
3.
State some of the provisions concerning presentation of financial statements.
4.
Identify the formats of financial presentation.
5.
State some of the provisions concerning events after the reporting period.
6.
State some of the provision s concerning revenue 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 SOME PROVISIONS OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 26: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Method of Accounting All business combinations shall be accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Identifying the acquirer An acquirer shall be identified for all business combinations.
The acquirer is the combining entity that obtains control of the combining entities or businesses.
Adjustment to the cost of a Business Combination contingent on Future Events When a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the acquirer shall include the amount of that adjustment in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.
Goodwill The acquirer shall, at the acquisition date: (a) Recognise goodwill acquired in a business combination as an asset; and (b) The acquirer shall recognise goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (i) over (ii) below: (i) The aggregate of:  The consideration transferred, measured in accordance with this standard, which generally requires acquisition date fair value;  The amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquire, measured in accordance with this Standard; and  In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquire.
(ii) the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured, in accordance with this standard.
Measurement Period Adjustments The acquirer shall account for changes in the fair value of contingent considerations that are not measurement period adjustment as follows: 122 (a) Contingent consideration classified as equity shall not be re-measured and its subsequent settlement shall be accounted for within equity.
(b) Contingent consideration classified as an asset or a liability is treated, thus: (i) as a financial instrument, it is measured at fair value, with any resulting gain or loss recognised either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income; or (ii) accounted for in accordance with SAS 23 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or other SASs as appropriate.
Disclosure requirements An acquirer shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of business combinations that were effected during the period.
An acquirer shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of business combinations that were effected after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorized for issue.
To give effect to the principle in paragraph 85, the acquirer shall disclose the following information for each business combination that was effected during the period: (a) The names and descriptions of the combining entities or business; (b) The acquisition date; (c) The percentage of voting equity instruments acquired; (d) The cost of the combination and a description of the components of that cost; and (e) Acquisition related costs.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What information is expected to be disclosed by the acquirer for each business combination?
3.2 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 30: INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORTING Interim financial reports should be prepared to provide current updates on the financial position, results of operations and changes in cash flows of the financial year, from the beginning of the accounting year to date.
An interim financial report should include, at a minimum, the following components: (a) Condensed statement of accounting policies; (b) Condensed balance sheet; (c) Condensed profit and loss account; (d) Condensed statement of cash flows; and (e) Selected notes to the accounts.
The interim financial report should carry a statement indicating whether or not the interim financial statements are audited.
Where they are audited, the auditors’ report shall be included.
The set of condensed financial statements which an entity publishes in its interim financial report shall include, at a minimum, each of the headings and sub-totals that were included in its most recent annual financial statements and the selected explanatory notes as required by this Standard.
Additional line items or notes shall be included if their omission would make the condensed interim financial statements misleading.
123 An entity shall apply the same accounting policies and principles in its interim financial statements as are applied in its annual financial statements, except for accounting policy changes made after the date of the most recent annual financial statements and are to be reflected in the next annual financial statements.
However, the frequency of an entity’s reporting (annual, half-yearly or quarterly) shall not affect the measurement of its annual results.
To achieve that objective, measurements for interim reporting purposes, shall be made on a year-to-date basis.
Exceptional and extraordinary items shall be recognised and disclosed in the profit and loss account of the interim period in which they occur in accordance with SAS 6- Extraordinary items and prior year adjustments.
Significant movements in key indicators of the entity’s financial position shall be explained by way of notes.
A reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities shall be given in sufficient detail for users to appreciate its main components.
Interim financial reports shall include interim financial statements (condensed or complete) for periods as follows: (a) Balance sheet as of the end of the current interim period and a comparative balance sheet as of the end of the immediately preceding financial year; (b) Profit and loss account for the current interim period and cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with comparative profit and loss account for the immediately preceding financial year; and (c) Cash flow statement cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with a comparative statement for the comparable year-to-date period of the immediately preceding financial year.
Disclosure requirements Subject to the few exceptions noted in this statement, disclosures required by Statements of Accounting Standards are not generally required in the presentation of interim financial reports.
However, other disclosure specific to interim financial reports that are helpful to users in assessing the relevance and reliability with which the reports might be used, and which shall be disclosed are: (a) The period covered by the report; (b) The date on which it is approved by the Board of Directors; (c) The extent to which the information it contains has been audited or reviewed; and (d) The frequency with which the organization presents interim reports.
(e) Interim financial reports should be prepared to provide current updates on the financial position, results of operations and changes in cash flows of the financial year, from the beginning of the accounting year to date.
If an estimate of an amount reported in an interim period is changed significantly during the final interim period of the financial year but a separate financial report is not published for that final interim period, the nature and amount of that change in estimate shall be disclosed in a note to the annual financial statements for the financial year.
124 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the components of interim financial reporting?
3.3 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STATEMENT 1: PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A revised IAS 1 was issued in September 2007 by the IASB.
Since this Standard deals with the form and contents of financial statements, aspects of the basic requirements are already addressed by SAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies and SAS 2, Information to be disclosed in the Financial Statements.
However, there are some financial statements introduced by this standard that professional accounting students should be familiar with.
These financial statements are: (a) Statement of financial position, and (b) Statement of comprehensive income The formats of the two statements are presented below: FORMAT OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION XYZ GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AT 31 DECEMBER 2008 2007 ASSETS N’000 N’000 Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 350,700 360,020 Goodwill 80,800 91,200 Other intangible assets 227,470 227,470 Investments in associates 100,150 110,770 Available –for – sale financial assets 142,500 156,000 901,620 945,460 Current assets Inventories 135,130 132,500 Trade receivables 91,600 110,800 Other current assets 25,650 12,540 Cash and cash equivalents 312,400 322,900 564,780 578,740 Total assets (a + b) 1,466,400 1,524,200 N’000 N’000 Equity and liabilities Equity attributable to owners of the parent Share capital 650,000 600,000 Retained earnings 243,500 161,700 Other components of equity 10,200 21,200 903,700 782,900 Non-controlling interest 70,050 48,600 Total Equity (a) 973,750 831,500 Non-current liabilities Long-term borrowings 120,000 160,000 Deferred tax 28,800 26,040 Long-term provisions 28,850 52,240 Total non-current liabilities (b) 177,650 238,280 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 115,000 187,620 Short-term borrowings 150,000 200,000 Current portion of lang-term borrowings 10,000 20,000 Current tax payable 35,000 42,000 125  Short-term provisions 5,000 4,800 Total current liabilities (c) 315,000 454,420 Total liabilities (d) 492,650 692,700 Total equity and liabilities (a + d) 1,466,400 1,524,200 FORMAT OF STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME XYZ GROUP- STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008 2007 N’000 N’000 Revenue 390,000 355,000 Cost of Sales (245,000) (230,000) Gross profit 145,000 125,000 Other income 20,667 11,300 Distribution costs (9,000) (8,700) Administration expenses (20,000) (21,000) Other expenses (2,100) (1,200) Finance costs (8,100) (7,500) Share of profit of associates 35,200 30,100 Profit before tax 161,667 128,000 Income tax expenses (40,417) (32,000) Profit for the year from continuing operations 121,250 96,000 Loss for the year from discontinued operations - 30,500 Profit for the year 121,250 65,500 N’000 N’000 Other comprehensive income: Exchange differences on translating foreign operations 5,334 10,667 Available –for –sale financial assets (24,000) 26,667 Cash flow hedges (667) (4,000) Gains on property revaluation 993 3,367 Actuarial gains (losses) on defined benefit pension plans (727) 1,333 Share of other comprehensive income of associates 400 (700) Income tax relating to components of other comprehensive income 4,667 (9,334) Other comprehensive income for the year, net of tax (14,000) 28,000 Total comprehensive income for the year 107,250 93,500 Profit attributable to: Owners of the parent 97,000 52,400 Non-controlling interest 24,250 13,100 121,250 65,500 Total comprehensive income attributable to: Owners of the parent 85,800 74,800 Non- controlling interest 21,450 18,700 107,250 93,500 Earnings per share (in currency units) 0.46 0.30 126 As can be readily seen from the formats, a statement of financial position is the equivalent of balance sheet.
The format of this statement is, however, slightly different from the two balance formats in the second schedule of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAP C20, LFN 2004.
The statement of financial position observes the current assets in the asset side of the balance sheet, and non-current liabilities is similarly presented before current liabilities in the other side of the balance sheet.
The statement of comprehensive income is the equivalent of profit and loss account or income statement as it is sometimes called.
IAS 1 allows a reporting entity to present the income statement either in a single statement of comprehensive income as shown above, or in two separate statements: one statement displaying components of profit or loss and the other statement beginning with profit or loss and displaying components of other comprehensive income.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the two financial statements introduced by IAS 1 that professional accounting students should be familiar with?
3.4 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD 10: EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD Categorization of events: events after the balance sheet date are broadly categorized into two: adjusting events and non-adjusting events.
Adjusting event is an event after the reporting period that provides further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, including an event that indicates that the going concern assumption in relation to the whole or part of the enterprise is no longer appropriate.
Example of adjusting event is the bankruptcy of a customer a few weeks after the balance sheet date.
Non-adjusting event is an event after the reporting period that is indicative of a condition that arose after the end of the reporting period.
Suppose the factory of a manufacturing company was destroyed by fire on 13th February 20X7.
If the reporting date of the company is 31st December, and the financial statements were authorized for issue on 10th April 20X8, the destruction of the factory on 13th February 20X7, is a non-adjusting event.
Accounting treatment of adjusting events The financial statements of a reporting entity should be adjusted when an adjusting event occurs.
If a debtor who owed N15m was declared bankrupt, adequate provisions should be made for bad debts by reducing the trade debtors as well as the retained profit figure.
Accounting treatment of non-adjusting events The financial statements of the reporting entity should not be adjusted for non-adjusted for non- adjusting events.
Treatment of proposed dividends Under IAS 10, if a dividend is declared after the reporting period, it should not be recognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period.
It is an adjusting event.
127 Disclosure Non-adjusting events should be disclosed if they are material.
The disclosure should include the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial effect.
If a reasonable estimate cannot be obtained, that fact must be stated.
Examples of a material non-adjusting event are: (a) a major business combination after the reporting date (b) abnormal fluctuation in exchange rates, and (c) issue of shares or debentures after the reporting date.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is adjusting invent and non-adjusting invent?
3.5 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD 18: REVENUE Definition of revenue Revenue is the gross inflows of economic benefits during the period, arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise when those inflows result in increases in equity and not contribution from equity participants.
Measurement of revenue Revenue should be measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable.
When goods or services are exchanged for other goods or services of a similar nature and value, the transaction is not recognised as revenue under IAS.
But when dissimilar items are exchanged, the transaction is regarded as generating revenue.
Recognition of revenue from sale of goods Revenue from sale of goods should be recognised only when all the following conditions are met: (a) The seller has transferred to the buyer the significant risk and reward of ownership; (b) The seller retains no continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold; (c) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (d) It is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the seller; and (e) The cost incurred in respecting the transaction can be measured reliably.
Recognition of revenue from rendering services Revenue from rendering of services should be recognised when all of the following conditions are met: (a) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (b) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the seller; (c) The stage of completion at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and (d) The costs incurred, and cost to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
Recognition of revenue from interest, royalties and dividends Revenue from interest, royalties and dividends should be recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the enterprise and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The following additional conditions apply: 128 (a) Interest is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the effective yield on the asset.
(b) Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
(c) Dividends are recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.
Disclosure The following items should be recognised: (a) Accounting policies adopted for the recognition of revenue and the methods adopted to determine the stage of completion of transactions involving the rendering services; (b) The amount of each significant category of revenue recognised during the period, including revenue arising from; (i) the sale of goods; (ii) the rendering of services; (iii) interests on loans; (iv) royalties; and (v) dividends (c) The amount of revenue arising from exchanges of goods or services included in each significant category of revenue.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the conditions to be met before the recognition of revenue from sale of goods?
4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, it should be noted that a business combination is the bringing together of separate entities or businesses into one reporting entity.
The result of nearly all business combinations is that one entity, the acquirer, obtains control of one or more other businesses, the acquiree.
If an entity obtains control of one or more other entities that are not businesses, the bringing together of those entities is not a business combination.
Statement issued for an accounting period of less than one year, such as quarterly or monthly.
Interim financial statements should be based on the accounting principles employed in the previous year's annual report unless a change has been adopted in the current year.
Interim financial statements are typically unaudited.
Footnote disclosure is given of seasonality effects.
If a fourth quarter is not presented, any significant adjustments to it must be commented upon in the annual report.
The objective of the financial statement presentation project is to establish a global standard that will guide the organisation and presentation of information in the financial statements.
The boards’ goal is to improve the usefulness of the financial information provided in an entity’s financial statements to assist management to better communicate its financial information to the users of its financial statements, and to help users in their decision-making.
The Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period indicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate.
129  5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we discussed business combination, presentation of financial statements, interim financial reporting, events after the reporting period and revenue, according to the provisions of the various Standards.

Government assistance refers to action by government designed to provide an economic benefit specific to an entity or range of entities, qualifying under certain criteria.
Grant related to assets refers to a government grant whose primarily condition is that an entity qualifying for it, should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire long-term assets.
Grant related to income refers to government grant other than those related to assets.
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by an enterprise in connection with the borrowing of funds.
The objective of IAS 24, is to ensure that an entity’s financial statements contain the disclosure necessary to draw attention to the possibility that its financial position and profit or loss may have been affected by the existence of related parties and by transactions and outstanding balances with such parties.
The objective of IAS 29 is to establish a standard to be applied in the financial reporting of any entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD 20: ACCOUNTING FOR GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND DISCLOSURE OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE IAS 20, prescribes the accounting treatment of government grants and other forms of government assistance.
Accounting treatment (a) A government grant should be recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that: (i) the enterprise will comply with the conditions attached to the grant; and (ii) the grant will be received.
(b) A grant in the form of non-monetary assets, such as, motor vehicle or other assets, may be valued at fair value or nominal value.
(c) Government grant should not be credited directly to equity: rather, it should be recognised as income, on a systematic basis, over the period necessary to match it with the related cost, that is, the cost it is intended to compensate.
(d) Grants relating to income may be presented in the income statement either separately as “other income” or deducted from the related expense.
(e) Grants relating to assets may be presented in the balance sheet either as deferred income or deducted in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.
Disclosures (i) Accounting policy adopted for government grants.
(ii) Nature and extent of grants recognised in the financial statements.
(iii) Unfulfilled conditions attached to recognised government grants.
ILLUSTRATION 19 Antsa Farms Ltd, received a grant of N300,000, from Benue State government on 1st January 20X6, to assist the company procure an agricultural equipment which cost N400,000.
The useful life of the equipment is estimated at three years after which it will be sold as scrap for N25,600.
(a) Show the amount of grant to be recognised in the income statement if Antsa depreciates equipment using the straight line method and the reduction balance method.
(b) Show how the grant will be presented in the financial statements if the company adopts the straight line method of depreciation and (i) deducts the grant from the cost of the asset, or (ii) treats the grant as deferred income.
Assume that the company’s profit before depreciation of the equipment is N800,000, per annum.
132 SUGGESTED SOLUTION 19 (a) The depreciable amount of the equipment is N(400,000 – 25,600) N374,400.
(i) Straight Line Method Amount of grant to be recognised if depreciation is calculated using the straight line method.
Year Depreciation Grant Income N N 20X6 124,800 100,000 20X7 124,800 100,000 20X8 124,800 100,000 The annual depreciation is calculated as follows: N374,400/3.
Similarly, the grant will be recognised in the same manner depreciation is calculated.
Therefore, annual amount to be recognised would be: N300,000/3years.
(ii) Reducing Balance Method As in the straight line method, the amount of grant to be recognised will be calculated in the same proportion as the depreciable.
Year Depreciation Grant Income N N 20X6 240,000 180,000 20X7 96,000 72,000 20X8 38,400 48,000 Tutorial Recall the formula for calculating depreciation rate under reducing balance method.
You will be able to determine that the appropriate rate of depreciation is 60%.
In the third year, the grant income that will be recognised is the balance of the grant amount in the year.

N400,000 – N300,000 = N100,000 Depreciable amount N(100,000 – 25,600) = N74,400 (ii) Balance on government grant account N Amount granted in 2006 300,000 Amount recognised in income in 2006 (100,000) Balance at the end of 2006 200,000 Amount recognised in 2007 (100,000) Balance at the end of 2007 100,000 Amount recognised in 2008 (100,000) Balance at end of 2008 Nil SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Solve the question in the illustration without looking at the solution and compare your result with the solution in the illustration.
3.2 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD 23: BORROWING COSTS Definitions Qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get it ready for its intended use.
Examples are property, plant, equipment and investing property.
Accounting treatment (a) Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset must be capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.
Other borrowing costs should be expensed.
134 (b) Where funds are borrowed for specific qualifying assets, the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization, are the actual costs incurred less any income earned on the temporary investment of such borrowings.
(c) Where funds are borrowed generally, but are applied in part of obtaining a qualifying asset, the eligible amount for capitalization is determined by applying a “capitalization rate” to the expenditure on the asset.
The capitalization rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made for specific asset.
The amount of the borrowing costs that an entity capitalizes during the period shall not exceed the amount of borrowing cost it incurred during that period (IAS 23.14).
(d) An entity should commence capitalization when expenditure for the asset is being incurred, borrowing costs are being incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are being undertaken.
(e) An entity should suspend capitalization during the periods in which it suspends active development of a qualifying asset.
(f) Capitalization of borrowing cost should cease when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are complete.
(g) When the construction of a qualifying asset is completed in parts and each part can be used while construction continues on other parts, capitalization should cease when the entity completes substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that part for its intended use or sale.
Disclosure An entity should disclose the amount of borrowing cost capitalized during the period and the capitalization rate used.

3.3 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD 24: RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES Definition of related party (IAS 24.9).
A party is related to an entity if: (a) Directly, or indirectly, though one or more intermediaries, the party; (i) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the entity (this includes parents, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries); (ii) has an interest in the entity that gives it significant influence over the entity; or (iii) has point control over the entity; (b) The party is an associate (as defined by IAS 28 Investment in Associates) of the entity; (c) The party is a joint venture in which the entity is a venture (see IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures); (d) The party is a member of the key management personnel of the entity or its parent; (e) The party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (a) or (b); (f) The party is an entity that is controlled, partly controlled or significantly influenced by, or for which significant voting power in such entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to in (d) or (e); or (g) The party is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of the employees of the entity, or of any entity that is a related party of the entity 135 Related party transaction (IAS 24.9) A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged.
Close members of the family of an individual are those who may be expected to influence or be influenced by that individual in their dealings with the entity.
They may include the individuals’ children, domestic partner and dependants.
Disclosure of relationship between parents and subsidiaries An entity must disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate controlling party, irrespective of whether there has been transactions between a parent and a subsidiary.
Disclosure of management compensation IAS 24 requires an entity to disclose key management personnel compensation in total and for each of the following categories: (a) Short-term employee benefits; (b) Post-employment benefits; (c) Other long-term benefits; (d) Termination benefits; and (e) Share-based payment Disclosure of related party transactions If there have been transactions between related parties, an entity is required by IAS 24, to disclose the nature of the related party relationship as well as information about the transactions and outstanding balances necessary for an understanding of the potential effect of the relationship on the financial statements.
At a minimum, the entity should disclose: (a) The amount of the transactions; (b) The amount of outstanding balances and their terms and conditions as well as details of any guarantees given or received; (c) Provisions for doubtful debts related to the amount outstanding; and (d) The expense recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from related parties.
The disclosures shall be made separately for parents, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, key management personnel and other related parties.
Examples of the transactions to be disclosed The following are examples of transactions that should be disclosed if they are with a related party; (a) Purchases or sales of goods; (b) Purchases or sales of property and other assets (c) Rendering or receiving of services; (d) Leases; (e) Transfers or research and development; 136 (f) Transfers under finance arrangements; (g) Provision of guarantees or collateral; and (h) Settlement of liabilities on behalf of the entity or by the entity on behalf of another party.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE How do you determine if a party is related to an entity?
3.4 INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD 29: FINANCIAL REPORTING IN HYPER INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES Hyperinflation IAS 29 does not establish an absolute rate at which hyperinflation is deemed to arise but it identifies the following characteristics of such an economy.
(a) The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in relatively stable foreign currency.
Amount of local currency held are immediately re-invested to maintain purchasing power.
(b) The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency.
Prices may be quoted in that currency.
(c) Sales and purchases on credit take place at loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short.
(d) Interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index.
(e) The cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.
Further explanation of the 100% cumulative inflation rate Under IAS 29, one of the characteristic of a hyperinflationary economy, is that the rate of inflation over three years is approaching, or exceeds 100%.
With compounding, this rates translates to an average of 26.7% for three consecutive years.
This example illustrates how to determine when to classify an economy as hyperinflationary, based on the 100% three-year inflation rate.
ILLUSTRATION 20 The inflation rate in country X, as indicated by the general price index, has moved as follows over the past ten years: Year General price index 1 1,200 2 1,800 3 2,160 4 2,400 5 3,780 6 4,000 7 4,480 8 5,560 9 8,000 10 9,960 137 You are required to indicate the years in which a country should apply inflation accounting, based on the requirements of IAS 29.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 20 Year 4 (2,400 – 1,200)/1,200 x 100 = 100% Year 5 (3,780 – 1,800)/1,800 x 100 =110% Year 6 (4,000 – 2,160)/2,160 x 100 = 85% Year 7 (4,480 – 2,400)/2,400 x 100 = 87% Year 8 (5,560 – 3,780)/3,780 x 100 = 47% Year 9 (8,000 – 4,000)/4,000 x 100 = 100% Year 10 (9,960 – 4,480)/4,480 x 100 = 122% Based on IAS 29, inflation adjustments should be made in years 4, 5, 9 and 10 because, in those years, the increase in inflation for three years in a row was 100% or above.
The same conclusion is reached if calculation is done on the annual rate of change and selection of the years when the average rate for three years is greater or approximately equal to 26.7%.
Year Rate of change Average for three years in a row 1 - - 2 50% - 3 20% - 4 10% 26.7% 5 57.6% 29.2% 6 6% 24.5% 7 12% 25.2% 8 24% 14% 9 44% 26.7% 10 24.5% 30.8% *Rate of change for year 2 is calculated as follows (1,800 1,200)/1,200 = 50% **Average change for three years in year 4 is calculated as follows; (50 + 20 + 10)/3 = 26.7% Restatement of financial statements 138 The financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, should be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date, irrespective of whether those statements are based on historical cost approach or current cost approach.
Comparative figures for the previous period should also be restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date.
Gain or loss on net monetary position The gain or loss on net monetary position should be included in profit or loss and separately disclosed.
Restatement of items in the statement of financial position IAS 29, provides detailed procedures that should guide the restatement of items in the statement of financial position.
The procedures are summarized below: (a) Restatements are made by applying a general price index (b) Monetary items are not restated because they are already expressed in terms of the monetary unit current at the end of the reporting period.
(c) Assets and liabilities linked to agreement on changes in prizes, such as index linked loans, are adjusted accordingly.
(d) Non-monetary items carried at amounts current, net realizable value and fair value, are not restated.
All other non-monetary assets and liabilities are restated.
(e) A non-monetary asset carried at cost less depreciation is restated by applying the change in general price index from the date of its acquisition to the balance sheet date.
(f) A non-monetary asset carried at amount current at dates other than that of its acquisition, for example, property, plant and equipment that has been revalued at some earlier date, is restated from the date of its revaluation.
(g) The restated amount of non-monetary item is reduced, in accordance with appropriate IFRSs, when it exceeds its recoverable amount.
(h) At the beginning of the first period of application of IAS 29, the components of owners’ equity, except retained earnings and any revaluation surplus, are restated by applying a general price index from the dates that the components were contributed or otherwise arose.
Any revaluation surplus that arose in previous periods is eliminated.
Historical statement of comprehensive income IAS 29, requires items of income and expenses to be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates when they were initially recorded in the financial statements.
Current cost statement of comprehensive income All income and expenses should be restated into the measuring unit at the end of the reporting period by applying a general price index.
Disclosures The following disclosures should be made: 139 (a) The fact that the financial statements and the corresponding figure for the previous periods have been restated for the changes in the general purchasing power of the functional currency.
(b) Whether the financial statements are based on a historical cost approach or a current cost approach.
(c) The identity and level of the price index at the end of the reporting period and the movement in the index during the current and the previous period.
ILLUSTRATION 21 Mr. Giwa Jikolo furnished his company’s latest financial statements prepared under the historical cost basis, to Mr. Field Grass, a friend residing in the United States of America to seek financial assistance from him.
The assistance is to purchase machines and equipment to replace the old ones, at present in use.
Mr. Grass faxed back the accounts requesting that they should be more realistic by showing the present values adapted to price index, current purchasing power or current cost; noting that the value of money is not constant especially in Nigeria where the Naira fluctuates widely against major foreign currencies.
He insists that his bank requires the information to grant the loan which he has applied for on behalf of Jikolo and Son Ltd.

The use of price index to restate historical cost accounting items ensures that assets are not understated and profits are not overstated which is usually the case with historical cost accounting in periods of rising prices.
(ii) Current Purchasing Power This involves accounting for the effect of general price changes.
The owners of the business are shareholders who suffer from general inflation as the purchasing power of their investment in the business declines.
Changes in general prices are thus used to record the effect by adjusting all figures shown in terms of money with the same purchasing power.
The re-statement is done using a general price index which tends to overcome the problem associated with historical cost accounting in periods of inflation.
(iii) Monetary Unit This is the fixed nominal amount of money attributable to an item in the financial statements without considering the effect of inflation.
Monetary unit is not an alternative basis for restating items in the historical accounts to reflect the effect of inflation.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the characteristics of a hyperinflation economy?
4.0 CONCLUSION Government grants are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an entity in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity.
They exclude those forms of government assistance which cannot reasonably have a value placed upon them and transactions with government which cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the entity.
Exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings and considered as borrowing costs are those exchange differences which arise on the amount of principal of the foreign currency borrowings to the extent of the difference between interest on local currency borrowings and interest on foreign currency borrowings.
Related party - parties are considered to be related if at any time during the reporting period one party has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and/or operating decisions.
Related party transaction - a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether or not a price is charged.
In a hyperinflationary economy, reporting of operating results and financial position in the local currency without restatement is not useful.
Money loses purchasing power at such a rate that comparison of amounts from transactions and other events that have occurred at different times, even within the same accounting period, is misleading.

Once an asset is written, it may only be written back up under very few circumstances.
Firm’s carrying goodwill on their books are required to make tests of impairment annually.
Any impairment found will then be expensed on the company’s income statement.
The objective of IAS 36 is to prescribe the procedure that an entity should apply to ensure that its assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amounts.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Defines some key terms used in International Accounting Standard 36.
2.
State the indicators for determining asset impairment.
3.
State the factors in measuring recoverable amount.
4.
State the provision for the reversal of an impairment loss.
5.
Show how impairment loss are allocated to reduce carrying amount of assets 6.
Prepare a revised note to fixed assets.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS Active market: This is a market in which all the following conditions exist: (a) The items traded within the market are homogenous; (b) Willing buyers and sellers can normally be found at any time; and (c) Prices are available to the public.
Carrying amount: This is the amount at which the asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciated (amortization) and accumulated impairment losses thereon.
146 Cash generating unit: This is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Corporate assets: These are assets other than goodwill that contribute to the future cash flows of both the cash-generating unit under review and other cash-generating units.
Fair value less cost to sell: This is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or cash- generating unit in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the cost of disposal.
Impairment loss: This is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount: of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.
Assessing and testing assets for impairment At the end of each reporting period, an entity should assess its assets to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If such indication exists, the entity should estimate the recoverable amount of the asset.
An entity should test an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use for impairment annually, by comparing its carrying value with its recoverable amount.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination should also be tested for impairment annually.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is an impairment loss?
3.2 INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an entity shall consider the following indications: External source of information (a) Market value declines significantly during the period; (b) Significant changes with adverse effect on the entity in technological, market, economic and legal environment; (c) Increases in market interest rates that are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value in use; and (d) The carrying amount of the net assets of an entity is more than its market capitalization.
Internal sources of information (a) Obsolescence or physical damage of an asset; (b) Assets likely to become idle or being earmarked for disposal; and (c) Evidence is available that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.
147 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the internal and external source indications of impairment?
3.3 MEASURING RECOVERABLE AMOUNT IAS 36, defines recoverable amount (RA) as the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’ fair value less costs to sell (FV) and its value in use (VIU).
(a) It is necessary to calculate both FV and VIU.
If FV is greater than the carrying amount of the asset, then the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to calculate the VIU.
Similarly, if VIU is greater than the asset’s carrying amount, the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to calculate the FV.
(b) If FV cannot be estimated, then the RA is equal to VIU.
(c) For an asset held for disposal, RA is equal to FV.
Determining fair value less cost to sell (a) If there is a binding sale agreement, then the price in that agreement attributable to the disposal of the asset is fair value less cost to sell.
(b) If there is no binding agreement but an asset is traded in active market, use the asset’s market price less cost to disposal.
(c) If there is no binding sale agreement or active market for an asset, use the amount that could be obtained from the disposal of the asset less costs of disposal.
Determining value in use The following elements should be reflected in the calculation of an asset’s value in use: (a) An estimate of future cash flows which the entity expects to derive from the asset; (b) Expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows; (c) The time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest; (d) The price for bearing the uncertainty which is in the asset; and (e) Other factors, such as illiquidity, that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows which the entity expects to derive from the asset.
Recognizing and measuring an impairment loss (a) If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount should be reduced to its recoverable amount.
That reduction is an impairment loss.
(b) An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss unless it relates to a re-valued asset where the increase in value was recognized in equity.
The impairment loss of such an asset should be treated as a revaluation decrease.
(c) After the recognition of an impairment loss, the depreciation charges of the asset should be adjusted in future periods.
Cash generating units If there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, recoverable amount shall be estimated for the individual asset.
If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, an entity should determine the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill (a) Goodwill should be tested annually for impairment.
148 (b) To test for impairment, goodwill acquired in a business combination should be allocated to each of the acquirer’s cash-generating units, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
(c) If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit, and the entity disposes of an operation within the unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of shall be included in the carrying amount of the operation and measured on the basis of the relative values of the operations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
(d) In testing a cash-generating unit for impairment, an entity is required to identify all the corporate assets of the cash-generating unit under review.
Impairment loss for a cash-generating unit If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, an entity should recognize an impaired loss.
The impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order: (a) First, to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit (group units); and (b) Second, to the other assets of the unit (group of units) pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset of the unit (group of units).
These reductions in amounts are treated as impairment losses on the individual assets and recognized immediately in the profit or loss, or equity, if the asset is carried at a re-valued amount.
ILLUSTRATION 22 After an impairment test on 31 December 20X8, Ogene Hostels ltd, concluded that one of its cash- generating unit’s net assets at the date of impairment test was N800m.

No impairment loss is attributable to the net monetary assets as they will be realized in full.
Monetary items are money held and other items to be received or paid in money.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE How do you recognize and measure impairment loss?
3.4 REVERSAL OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS (a) An entity is required by IAS 36, to assess at each balance sheet date, whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the entity is required to calculate the recoverable amount of the asset.
If the recoverable amount is greater than the impaired value, the impairment loss should be reversed and the reversal should be recognised immediately in the income statement.
(b) An increased carrying amount due to reversal of an impairment loss, should not exceed what the value would have been if the impairment had not been recognized for the asset in prior years.
150 (c) Depreciation charge for the asset should be adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s carrying amount less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
(d) Reversal of an impairment loss recognized for goodwill is debarred.
(e) Reversal of unwinding of discount is also prohibited.
(IAS 36.116) SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline the provision for the reversal of impairment loss.
3.5 DISCLOSURE Disclosure by class of assets and reportable segments An entity should disclose the following for each class of assets: (a) Impairment losses recognized in profit or loss; and (b) Reversal of impairment losses recognized in profit or loss.
Similar disclosures should be made for each reportable segment.
(IAS 36.129) Other disclosures For each material impairment loss, an entity is required to disclose: (a) The events and circumstances that led to the impairment loss or reversal of the loss; (b) The amount of the impairment loss; (c) In the case of individual assets, the nature of loss and the reportable segment involved; (d) For a cash-generating unit, a description of the unit and the amount of impairment loss recognized or reversed; and (e) Whether the recoverable amount of the asset is its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use.
ILLUSTRATION 23 Obun Ltd is into Car Hire services.
The notes relating to the fixed assets figure in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 20X6, showed the following: N’000 N’000 Cost of acquisition 12,000 Accumulated depreciation: At 1 January 20X6 4,800 Charge for the year 2,400 (7,200) Net Book Value as at 31 December, 20X6 4,800 The cars on hire are being written off at the rate of 20% per annum.
However, the car hire market has slumped, and as a result, it will only be able to generate N2.5 million income per annum for the year 20X7 and 20X8 only.
Alternatively, the car could be sold immediately (31 December 20X6) for 151 its fair value of N2.8 million, but a selling cost of N180,000, will be incurred.
The cost of capital is 15%.
Required: (i) calculate the impairment as at 31 December 20X6.
(ii) prepare a revised note to the fixed assets.
(iii) show the note to the fixed asset for the year ended 31 December 20X7 (iv) assuming the market for car hire services picked up, and the cars now have a recoverable amount of N3.9 million, you are required to draft the note to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 20X7.

Thus, the reversal has been restricted to such amount that will ensure that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the ceiling set by IAS 36.117.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is an entity expected to disclose for material impairment loss?
4.0 CONCLUSION Under U.S. GAAP impaired assets must be recognized once there is evidence of a lack of recoverability of the net carrying amount.
Once impairment has been recognized it cannot be restored.
Analysts must know that some foreign countries and the IASB allow companies to recognize increases in previously impaired assets.
Asset impairment occurs when there are:  Changes in regulation and business climate  Declines in usage rate  Technology changes  Forecasts of a significant decline in the long-term profitability of the asset Once a company has determined that an asset is impaired, it can write down the asset or classify it as an asset for sale.
Assets will be written down if the company keeps on using this asset.
Write- downs are sometimes included as part of a restructuring cost.
It is important to be able to distinguish asset write-downs, which are non-cash expenses, from cash expenses like severance packages.
153 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we discussed impairment of asset according to the provision of International Accounting Standard 36.

Entities often grant shares or share options to employees or other parties, share plans and share option plans are common features of employee remuneration for directors, senior executives and many other employees.
Some entities issue shares or share options to pay suppliers, such as suppliers of professional services; the objective of IFRS 2 is to specify the financial reporting by an entity when it undertakes a share-based payment transaction.
IFRS 5 specifies the accounting treatment of assets held for sales, and the presentation and disclosure of discontinued operations.
In particular, the standard requires; (a) Assets that meet the criteria to be classified as, held for sale to be measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation on such assets to cease; and (b) Assets that meet the criteria to be presented separately in the statement of financial position and the results of discontinued operations to be presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After studying this unit, you should be able to: 1.
Calculate the amount to be recognized as expense.
2.
Show how impairment loss will be allocated to non-current assets.
3.
Show how transactions would be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
4.
Prepare a statement comprehensive income for the year according to IFRS 5.
5.
State definitions of terms, provisions as contained in IFRS 1, 2, and 5.
155 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 IFRS: 1 FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Key terms Date of Transition to IFRS is the beginning of the earliest period for which an entity presets full comparative information under IFRSs in its first IFRS financial statements.
Deemed cost- An amount used as surrogate for cost or depreciated cost at a given date.
First IFRS financial statements- The first financial statements in which an entity adopt international financial reporting standards (IFRSs), by an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs.
First IFRS reporting period is the latest reporting period covered by an entity’s first IFRS financial statement.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Standards and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
They comprise: (a) International Financial Reporting Standards; (b) International Accounting Standards; and (c) Interpretations developed by the Interactional Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) or the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).
Opening IFRS Statement of Financial Position An entity’s statement of financial position at the date of transition to IFRSs.
Previous GAAP- the bans of accounting that a first-time adopter used immediately before adopting IFRSs.
Objective of IFRS 1 The objective of IFRS is to ensure that an entity’s first IFRS financial statements, and its interim financial reports for part of the period covered by those financial statements, contain high quality information that: (a) Is transparent for users and comparable over all periods presented; (b) Provides a suitable starting point for accounting in accordance with IFRSs and (c) Can be generated at a cost that does not exceed the benefits.
An entity is, therefore, required to apply IFRS 1, in its first IFRS financial statements and each interim financial report for the part of the period covered by its first IFRS financial statements.
Definition of first-time adoption Financial statements prepaid by an entity in accordance with IFRSs are the entity’s first IFRS financial statements.
If the entity: (a) Presented its most recent previous financial statements in accordance with national requirements that are partially consistent or totally inconsistent with IFRSs; (b) Prepared financial statements in accordance with IFRSs for internal use only; 156 (c) Prepared a reporting package for consideration purposes only or; (d) Did not present financial statements for previous periods.
First IFRS Reporting Period An entity is required to use those accounting policies that comply with IFRSs, effective at the end of its first IFRS reporting period.
If First and last bank decides to prepare its financial statements using IFRSs, with effect from the reporting period ending on 31 December, 20X9, in: (a) Preparing and presenting its opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 20X8; and (b) Preparing and presenting its statement of financial position for 31 December 20X9 (including comparative amounts for 20X8), statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year to 31 December 20X9 (including comparative amounts for 20X8) and disclosures (including comparative information for 20X8).
The bank’s date of transition to IFRSs is 1 January 20X8.
Content of opening IFRS statement of financial position In its opening IFRS statement of financial and entity should: (a) Recognize all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by IFRSs; (b) Not recognize items as assets or liabilities if IFRSs do not permit such recognition; (c) Reclassify items it recognized in accordance with previous GAAP where appropriate; and (d) Apply IFRSs in measuring all recognized assets and liabilities.
IFRS 1 allows a first-time adopter some exemptions in accounting for certain transactions, such as, share-based payment transaction, insurance contracts, leases, compound financial instruments and borrowing cost (see appendix D of IFRS 1 for details.
Explanation of Transition to IFRSs An entity is required to explain how the transition from previous GAAP to IFRSs affected its reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
To comply with this; a first-time adopter is required to include the following in its first IFRS financial statements.
(a) Reconciliations of its equity reported in accordance with previous GAAP, to its equity in accordance with IFRSs, for both the date of transition and of the latest period, presented in the entity’s most recent financial statements in accordance with previous GAAP.
(b) A reconciliation to its total comprehensive income, in accordance with IFRSs for the latest period, in the entity’s most recent annual financial statements.
(c) If the entity recognized or reverse any impairment losses for the first time in preparing its opening IFRS statement of financial position, the disclosures that IAS 36 Impairment of Assets would have required if the entity had recognized those impairment losses or reversals in the period beginning with the date of transition to IFRSs.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is a deemed cost?
157 3.2: IFRS 2: SHARE-BASED PAYMENT KEY TERMS Entity instrument: A contract that evidences a residual interest on the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Share-based payment transaction: A transaction in which the entity receives goods or services as consideration for equity instruments of the entity (including shares or share options), or acquires goods or services by incurring liabilities to the supplier of those goods or services for amount that are based on the price of the entity’s share or other equity instruments of the entity.
Grand date: This is the date at which the entity and another party (including an employee) agree to a share-based payment arrangement.
Intrinsic value: The difference between the fair value of the shares to which the counterparty has the right to subscribe or receive and the price the counterparty is required to pay for those shares.
Measurement date: The date at which the fair value of the equity instruments granted is measured for the purposes of IFRS 2.
Reload feature: A feature that provides for an automatic grant of additional share options whenever the option holder exercises previously granted options using the entity’s shares, rather than cash, to satisfy the exercise price.
Reload option: A new share option granted when a share is used to satisfy the exercise price of a previous share option.
Share option: A contract that gives the holder the right but not the obligation, to subscribe to the entity’s shares at a fixed or determinable price for a specified period of time.
Vest: To become an entitlement, under a share-based payment arrangement, a counterparty’s right to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity vests when the counterparty’s entitlement is no longer conditional on the satisfaction of any vesting condition.
Vesting conditions: The conditions that determine whether the entity receives the services that entitle the counterparty to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity, under a share-based payment arrangement.
Vesting period: The period during which all the specified vesting conditions of a share-based payment arrangement are to be satisfied.
Equity-settled share based payment transaction: A share based payment transaction in which the entity receives goods or services as consideration for equity instrument of the entity (including shares or share options).
Cash-settled share-based payment transaction: A share-based payment transaction in which the entity acquires goods or services by other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price (or value) of the entity’s share or other equity instruments of the entity.
Overviews 158 Typically, shares, share options or other equity instruments are granted to employees as part of their remuneration package, in addition to a cash salary and other employment benefits.
Usually, it is not possible to measure directly the services received for particular component of the employee benefit.
By granting shares and share options, in addition to other remuneration, the entity is paying additional benefits is likely to be difficult.
In view of the difficulty of measuring directly the fair value of the services received, the entity measures the fair value by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument granted.
(IFRS 2.15).
Recognition (a) An entity should recognize the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction as assets if they qualify for recognition as such, otherwise, they should be recognized as expenses.
(b) An entity should recognize the goods and services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction when it obtains the goods or as the services are received.
The entity shall recognize a corresponding increase in equity if the goods or services were received in an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, or a liability if the goods or services were acquired in a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.
ILLUSTRATION 24 On 1 January 20X6, Mozunim Plc, granted 1000 share options to each of its 20 executives on the management team.
Each grant is conditional upon each executive being on the management team till 31 December 20X8.
In other words, the options vest at the end of a three year period.
The fair value of each share option is N50 and the company expects that all the share options will be vest required: (a) Calculate the amount to be recognized as expense for each of the three years and show the double entry at the end of the first year.
(b) Suppose the company estimated that 20% actually left at the end of the third year, calculate the amount to be recognized as expense for each of the three years.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 24 (a) If all the options vest, the annual expense is calculated as follows: 1000 options x N50 x 1/3 = N333,333.
The double entries at the end of 20X6, would be as follows: Dr profit or loss – N333,333 Cr Equity - N333,333 (b) If 20% is estimated to leave but 25% actually left in the third year, the annual expense would be calculated as follows: Cumulative Expenses for Expenses the year Year N N 20X6 1000 x 20 x 50 x 80% x 1/3 266,667 266,667 20X7 1000 x 20 x 50 x 80% x 2/3 533,333 266,666 20X8 1000 x 15 x 50 750,000 216,667 Measurement of equity settled transactions 159 (a) For equity-settled share-based transactions, the entity shall measure the goods and services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, directly, at the fair value of the goods and services received.
(b) If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods and services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Simply put, the fair value of equity-settled transactions is determined in two ways: (1) directly, at the fair value of the goods or services received; and (2) indirectly, by reference to the value to shares issued.
ILLUSTRATION 25 The management of Agudama Fishes Plc encountered some problems with its fish lake in Bayelsa State.
To solve the problem, the company sought for and obtained the specialist advice of Professor T. Popoola, an environmental biologist, in one of the nation’s premier universities.
To pay for his services, the company gave him 20,000 of its 50k shares with market value of N2.80 each.
You are required to show how this transaction would be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 25 Under IFRS 2, an equity-settled transaction that cannot be measured directly at the fair value of the services received should be measured indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
The formal entries would be as follows: Dr share capital N10,000 Cr share premium N46,000 Cash-settled share-based transactions For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the entity should measure the goods or services acquired and liability incurred at the fair value of the liability.
Until the liability is settled, the entity should re-measure the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any charges in fair value recognized in profit or loss.
Disclosures An entity should disclose information that will enable users to understand: (a) The effect of share-based payment transactions on the entity’s profit or loss for the period and on its financial position; (b) How the fair value of the goods or services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, during the period was determined; and (c) The nature and extent of share-based payment arrangements that existed during the period.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is a share-based payment transaction?
160 3.3: IFRS 5: NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Classification as held for sale A non-current asset or disposal group should be classified as, held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale of transaction rather than through continuing use.
The standard requires the following conditions to be met for such a classification to take place: (a) The asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition; (b) Management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group; (c) An active programme to locate a buyer and complete it at a reasonable price must have been initiated; (d) Sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (e) It is unlikely that significant change to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
When a non-current asset or disposal group is acquired exclusively with a view to its subsequent disposal within one year, it should be classified as held for sale.
(IFRS 5.11).
Measurement of a non-current asset (a) A non-current asset or disposal group held for sale should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair values less cost to sell.
(b) A non-current asset or disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners should be measured at carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute.
(c) The entity should recognize an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group), to fair value less costs to sell.
Any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell should be recognized as a gain.
(d) The impairment loss (or any subsequent gain) recognized for a disposal group, should be allocated to the carrying amount of the assets in accordance with IAS 36.
ILLUSTRATION 26 Weris Hotels Plc plans to dispose of a group of its assets in Kaduna, as an asset sale.
The assets constitute a disposal group and had the following values: Carrying amount at the end carrying amount as re-measured Of the reporting period before immediately before classification Classification as held for sale as held for sale N’000 N’000 Goodwill 5,600 5,600 Property, plant & equipment carried At re-valued amount 10,700 9,000 Property, plant & equipment 10,000 8,000 Building construction in progress 8,600 8,000 161 Stock 4,100 3,800 Total 39,000 34,400 The company estimates that fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group amounts to N30.4million.
You are required to show how the impairment loss will be allocated to non-current assets.
(Adopted from IFRS 5 implementation guide).
SUGGESTED SOLUTION 26 The impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount N39million and fair value less cost to sell, N30.4million.
According to IAS 36, the impairment loss will first reduce the goodwill.
The residual loss will be allocated to the other non-current assets prorate, based on their carrying amounts.

Presentation and disclosure IFRS 5 requires the following disclosures concerning discontinued operations: (a) An entity shall disclose a single amount in the statement of comprehensive income comprising the total of: (i) the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations and (ii) the post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) constituting the discontinued operation.
162 (b) An analysis of the single amount in (a) into: (i) the revenue, expenses and pre-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations; (ii) the related tax; (iii) the gain or loss recognized on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the discontinue operation; and (iv) the related income tax expense.
The following presentation and disclosures are required in respect of assets classified as held for sale: (a) An entity should present a non-current asset classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale separately from other assets in the statement of financial position.
(b) The entity should disclose the following information in the notes to the financial statements of the period: (i) a description of the non-current assets; (ii) a description of the facts and circumstances of the sale; and (iii) if applicable, the reportable segment in which the non-current asset is presented.
ILLUSTRATION 27 As a result of frequent disruption of its operations in Zaramafa, Opuene Oil Services Ltd decided to sell off its business in that geographical area.
The net assets of the company’s businesses in Zaramafa at 31 December 20X8 amounted to N208million, but its fair value less cost to sell has been estimated at N198million.
The company is confident that it could affect the disposal within one year as willing buyers have started indicating interest.
During the year ended 31 December, 20X8 the businesses in Zaramafa reported the following.
Revenue operating expenses N126million and estimated income tax, N15million.
The rest of the other businesses of Opuene Oil Services ltd had the following incomes and expenses.

4.0 CONCLUSION International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are principles-based standards, interpretations and the framework (1989) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Many of the standards forming part of IFRS are known by the older name of International Accounting Standards (IAS).
IASs were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).
On April 1, 2001, the new IASB took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards.
During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and Standing Interpretations Committee standards (SICs).
The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards IFRS.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you would recall that we discussed International Financial Reporting Standard 1, 2 and 5: First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, Share-Based Payment and Non- Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations respectively.

Consequently, they apply to every Nigerian company’s financial statements.
Therefore, regulatory framework of financial accounting are based on company laws, accounting standards, international accounting standards, and other national standard setting bodies influence.
Accounting standards are rules or set of rules prescribing the method(s) by which accounts (financial statements) are prepared and presented.
These are ‘working regulations’ and are issued by national or international bodies of the accountancy profession.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 CLASSIFICATION OF COMPANIES Under section 21 of CAMA 2004, an incorporated company may be any of the following: 167 (a) Company limited by shares.
This is a company where the liability of each member to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of winding-up or liquidation is limited by the Memorandum and Articles of Association to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares held by him.
(b) Company limited by guarantee.
In this type of registered company, the liability of each member to contribute to assets of the company in the event of winding up, is limited by the Memorandum and Articles of Association to the amount which the member undertakes to pay.
Unlike companies limited by shares, a company limited by guarantee, shall not be registered with a share capital (see section 26 of the CAMA 2004).
Such companies are usually formed to promote commerce, art, science, education, research and similar objects.
The name of the company shall end with the word limited by guarantee or Ltd/Gte.
(c) Unlimited Company.
In an unlimited company, there is no limit on the liability of its members.
The name of the company shall end with unlimited or Ultd.
(see Section 29 of CAMA 2004).
Any of the foregoing types of company may be a: (a) Private limited liability company, or (b) Public limited liability company A private limited liability company: Section 22 of CAMA defines a private company as one which is stated in its Memorandum and Articles of Association to be a private company and which its articles of Association: (a) Restricts the right to transfer its shares; (b) Limits the number of its members to fifty; (c) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company; (d) Requires that appointment of directors may be done by an ordinary resolution; and (e) Requires that the name of the company shall end with the word Limited or Ltd (see Section 29).
A public limited liability company: A public company is any other than a private limited liability company.
It, however, has the following characteristics: (a) The word “public” is stated in its Memorandum of Association; (b) Does not restrict the right to transfer its shares; (c) Does not limit the number of its members; (d) Makes its accounts public for all to see; (e) Places invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company; (f) Appointment of directors may be done individually on separate resolutions.
Note, however, that one of its members may move that all directors be appointed by one resolution and where this is not opposed, then the public company’s directors may be appointed by a single resolution; (g) Any public company can issue its shares and debentures by way of prospectus or statement in lieu of prospectus in appropriate circumstances after presentation to the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (h) The name of the company shall end with word Public Limited Company or Plc.
168 SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What is the difference between company limited by shares and company limited by guarantee?
3.2 CAPITAL STRUCTURE The capital structure of a company consists of ordinary shares, preference shares and debentures.
Under these structures, there are different types: Types of capital Nominal or Authorized: This is the initial capital with which the company is registered.
It does not change within a short time except where the capital is increased.
It is therefore, the maximum capital at any given time.
There are specified minimum capitals as stipulated by law.
The authorized minimum share capital of a private company is N10,000,00 and N500,000.00 for a public company.
The subscribers of the Memorandum must together take shares of a value not less than 25% of the authorized capital.
Issued Capital: The portion of the nominal capital or authorized capital issued or made available to shareholders.
It must not at any time be less than 25% of the authorized capital.
Paid-up capital: This is that part of the share capital which has been issued to and paid for by the shareholders.
Reserve capital: It is that portion of uncalled capital which a company limited by shares has, by special resolution, determining that it will not be capable of being called up except for the purpose of winding up the company.
Note that an unlimited company, which resolves to be registered as a limited company, may provide for reserve share capital on re-registration.
Equity Share capital: This means a share other than a preference share, which does not carry fixed return on investment: for example, ordinary shares.
CLASSES OF SHARE Any company, authorized by its articles, the Act or any other law, may issue different classes of shares.
Such a share must not have more than one vote or no vote at all.
A company may, however, subject to the above principle, issue shares having preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, such as, regards dividends or return of capital.
The usual classes of shares are: Ordinary shares: They have no special rights and carry no fixed rate of return on the capital.
They bear the major financial risk of the company and are therefore often called the equity shares of the company.
They cost much less than the ordinary shares and preference shares.
In voting matters, deferred shareholders are more at an advantage compared with preference shareholders who are regarded as investors.
Payment for share This may be in cash or if authorized by the articles, by property or services and, if payment is not in cash, the consideration must be valued by an expert.
See section 135-137 of CAMA (2004).
It should be noted that at formation of a company, there is actual payment for the shares.
169 Membership of the company: Membership of the company is made up of: (a) Subscribers who are deemed to have agreed to become members and whose names must be entered in the register of members.
(b) Every other person who agrees in writing to become member a member by payment and allotment of shares and such person’s name is entered in the register of members.
Public Issue of shares Only public companies can issue their shares or debentures to the public, usually by way of a prospectus but where no prospectus is issued, a statement in lieu of prospectus is filed.
Filing the prospectus is no longer a prerequisite for the formation of a public company.
The company may now be formed while work on the prospectus is carried on, pursuant to issuance of shares.
Issue of Shares at Premium Share are said to be issued at a premium where the price at which they are issued is higher than the par (nominal) value of the share.
Thus, the shares of a company with nominal or par value of N1.00 per share may be issued at N1.20.
When a company issue shares at a premium, the sum equal to the aggregate amount or value of the premium on those shares must be transferred to an account called “share premium account”.
This account cannot be used to pay dividend but can be used for the following: (a) Paying up unissued shares of the company to be issued to members as fully paid bonus shares; (b) Writing off the preliminary expenses of the company or the expenses of or commission paid or discount allowed on any issue of shares of the company; and (c) Providing for the premium payable on redemption of redeemable preference shares of the company.
Issue of Shares at a Discount Shares may be issued at a discount which means that the amount paid by the applicants/subscribers is less than the par(nominal) value of the share.
This could be possible only where a resolution: (a) Authorizes the issue of shares at a discount; or (b) Specifies the maximum rate of discount at which the shares are to be issued; and (c) Stipulates the time frame of the issue which must be within the month after the date on which must be within the month after the date on which the issue is sanctioned by the court or within such extended time as the court may allow.
Allotment of Shares Subject to the provisions of the Investment and Securities Act, the power to allot shares is vested in the company which it may delegate to the director, subject to the conditions or directions that may be imposed by Articles or from time by the company in General Meetings.
The method of application for allotment is dependent on the type of company.
In the case of a private company or a public company, where the company issues shares and a member indicates the number of shares which he wishes to purchase.
In the case of a public company, where the issue of shares is public, subject to any condition that may be imposed by the Securities and Exchange 170 Commission, the application for allotment is made by completing and returning to the company the form of application as prescribed by the Articles.
Upon the receipt of an application, a company shall, where it wholly or partially accepts the application, make an allotment to the applicant and within 42 days after the allotment, notify the applicant of the fact of the allotment and number of shares allotted to him.
The application is an offer to take shares and allotment amounts to an acceptance.
An applicant shall have the right at any time before allotment, to withdraw the application by written notice to the company.
ACQUISITION OF OWN SHARES Section 160(2) of CAMA states the reasons why a company may wish to purchase or own its shares.
They include: (a) Settling or compromising a debt or claim asserted by or against the company; (b) Eliminating fractional shares; (c) Fulfilling the terms of a non-assignable agreement under which the company is obliged to acquire from an officer or employee of the company; (d) Satisfying the claim of a dissenting shareholder; and (e) Complying with a court order.

(b) Redeemable shares shall not be purchased at a price greater than the lowest price at which they are redeemable or shall be redeemable at the next date thereafter at which they are due or liable to be redeemed Reciprocal Acquisition of a Holding Company’s Shares by its Subsidiary Section 165 of CAMA, allows a subsidiary to acquire or retain the shares of its holding company, under the following conditions: (a) The subsidiary company may acquire the shares of its holding company as a personal representative or trustee of its holding company; and (b) A subsidiary company which had acquired the shares of its holding company before 1990, shall continue to retain such shares but shall not be entitled to vote at the meetings of its holding company, and shall not acquire further shares in the holding company, particularly where their security may be in danger.
DEBENTURES This is an acknowledgement of indebtedness issued by a company to a lender and it is normally by way of a deed.
Securities and Charges This is a collateral given by a debtor to secure a loan and it is meant for protection and assurance that the loan will be paid when due.
Types of debentures 171 (a) Perpetual debenture: This is a debenture that is made irredeemable or redeemable at a very long period of time.
(b) Convertible debenture: This is a type that may be converted to the shares of the company which issued it.
See S.172 of CAMA 2004.
(c) Secured and naked debenture: Security here may either be fixed or floating.
See s.173 of CAMA 2004.
(d) Redeemable debenture: This may be redeemed at any time.
See S.174 of CAMA 2004.

SHAREHOLDERS’ FUND Shareholders’ fund is made up of ordinary share capital, preference share capital and reserves.
Ordinary share capital/preference share capital As earlier discussed above, they are part of the share capital of the company, with different rights to dividend and capital repayment in accordance with the Articles of Association of the company.
Reserves: It is an appropriation of the company’s profit during a financial year.
CLASSES OF RESERVES Revenue reserves A revenue reserve is where an amount has been voluntarily transferred from the profit and loss appropriation account by debiting it, thus reducing the amount of profits left available for cash dividend purposes.
It might be for some particular purpose, or the amount could be called up in future to help swell the profit shown in the profit and loss appropriation account, as being available for dividend purposes.
General reserves A company might create a general reserve account to take care of unforeseen circumstances, instead of paying out the entire amount in form of dividend.
Capital reserves This is a reserve that is not readily available for transfer to the profit and loss appropriation account, to swell the profit shown as available for cash dividend purpose.
The following types of capital reserves are created in accordance with the Act: (a) Capital redemption reserve fund is created by law to meet the following: (i) paying up unissued shares of the company as fully paid bonus issues; and (ii) applied in redeeming preference shares or debentures.
(b) Share premium account: This is an account created from issuing shares at an amount higher than the nominal value.
The account is used to meet the following: (i) writing off preliminary expenses; (ii) writing off expenses and commission paid on the issue of shares and debentures; (iii) writing off discount on shares or debentures issued; and (iv) providing for any premium payable on redemption.
(c) Revaluation account: A revaluation account is usually created when the value of existing assets are either increased or decreased in line with the dictates of the market.

4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, you have learnt that Financial Accounting Standard Board (USA) has defined conceptual framework as a constitution, a coherent system of interrelated objectives and fundamentals that can lead to consistent (accounting) standards and that prescribes the nature, function and limits of financial accounting and financial statements.
Some arguments hold that some standards concentrated on income statement and others concentrated on balance sheet.
An unambiguous definition of income and value would ensure that all financial statements have equal usefulness to different users groups.
Counter argument might be that financial statements intended for variety of users and may not be possible to devise single conceptual framework suiting all users.
May need variety of accounting standards, each produced for different purpose (and with different concepts as basis).
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you would recall that we discussed regulatory framework of financial accounting 1.
This was discussed using the sub units; classification of companies; capital structure; and presentation of financial statements.

3.3 SECURITY AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND NIGERIAN STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATION REGULATIONS Historical background In most jurisdictions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exists as the apex capital market institution, providing the right regulatory framework for orderly development of the market, ensuring the integrity of securities business and protection of all participants, particularly the investors.
The extent of powers and scope of regulatory responsibilities conferred on the Commission depends on enabling laws.
In Nigeria, the Commission came into full existence following the enactment of Securities and Exchange Commission Act 1979, re-enacted as Act 29 of 1988.
Historically, it grew out of the capital issues Committee, housed under the Central Bank of Nigeria in the sixties.
This Committee led to the establishment of Capital Issues Commission and subsequently Nigerian Securities exchange Commission (NSEC), which played key role in the indigenization era of 1973- 1977 period.
Roles assigned to the Commission can be broadly classified into developmental and surveillance roles.
Development roles These relate to efforts aimed at increasing the depth and breadth of securities business and include facilitating the establishment of important capital market institutions such as Stock and Commodity Exchange, Capital Trade Points, Rating Agencies.
These roles which are largely by SEC in developing markets also include development of innovative instruments such as derivatives and facilitating knowledge and awareness of securities.
The traditional role of surveillance includes oversight responsibilities in ensuring that existing institutions and participants confirm to rules and regulations.
Originally, the following specific functions were taken up by the Commission.
(a) Pricing of new issues- following deregulations of the market, this function has been transferred to the issuing house.
(b) Timing of issues- this is to ensure that the market is not glutted with shares at any point in time.
(c) Registering and licensing- of market operators including the stock exchanges.
(d) Approval of allotment of shares to members of the public.
(e) Registering of instruments issued with the possibility of transfer to persons other than those initially offered.
186 (f) The companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap.
C20 LFN 2004, also empowers the Commission to regulate mergers and acquisitions, including unit trust and similar schemes.
The enabling Act for the activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission is the Investment and Securities Act, 1999.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the functions of the Security and Exchange Commission?
3.4 INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES ACT, 1999 The Securities and Exchange Commission is empowered by the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 1999, to administer securities laws and regulate investment and securities in Nigeria.
The Act requires comprehensive set of accounting records and accounting reports in a number of circumstances, including business combinations, content of prospectus, and records of security dealers.
A few of these requirements are stated below.
Books of Accounts of Security Dealers (S37) Section 37(1) requires a security dealer to keep or cause to be kept such accounting and other records: (a) As shall sufficiently explain the transactions and financial position of its business accounts and balance sheets to be prepared, from time to time; and (b) In such a manner as to enable them to be conveniently and properly audited.
A security dealer shall be deemed not to have complied with subsection (1) of this section in relation to records unless the accounting and other records: (a) Are kept in sufficient details to show particulars of: (i) all money received or paid by the security dealer including money paid to or deducted from a trust amount; (ii) all purchases and sales of securities made by the security dealer, the charges and credits arising from them, and the names of each of these securities; (iii) all income received from commissions, interest and other sources and all expenses, commissions and interest paid for by the security dealer; (iv) all the assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of the security dealer; (v) all securities which are the priority of the security dealer, showing by whom the securities or documents of the title to the security are held and, where they are held by another person, whether or not they are held as security against loans or advances; (vi) all securities that are not the property of the security dealer and for which the dealer or any nominee controlled by the security dealer is accountable, showing by whom, and for whom, the securities are held and the extent to which they are either held for safe custody or deposited with a third party as security for loans or advances made to the security dealer; (vii) all purchases and sales of options made by the security dealer and all fees (being options money) arising from them; and (viii) all underwriting transactions entered into by the security dealer.
(b) Are kept in sufficient details to show separately particulars of all transactions by the security dealer.
187 (c) Specify the day on which or the period during which each transaction by the security dealer took place; and (d) Contain copies of acknowledgements of the receipt of securities or of documents of title to securities received by the security dealer from clients for sale or safe custody, clearly showing the name or names in which the particular securities are registered.
Accounts for Investor Protection Fund Section 152 of ISA 1999, requires a security exchange or capital trade point to establish and keep proper books of accounts in relation to its investors protection fund and prepare income and expenditure account and balance sheet not later than 30th April following each 31st December.
Accountant’s Report to be set out in a Prospectus Section 17 of the 3rd schedule, requires the report of accountants to be contained in the prospectus of a company wishing to issue shares or debentures.
The report should cover (a) the profits and losses of the business for the five years preceding the issue of the prospectus and (b) the assets and liabilities of the business at the last date to which the accounts of the business were made.
Part 2 of schedule 4, also requires accountants’ report where there is a proposal to acquire a business or a subsidiary.
3.5 PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2004 Section 1 of the Pension Reform Act 2004, mandates the establishment of a contributory pension scheme for the payment of retirement benefits of workers in Nigeria.
Section 2 of the Act insists that the requirement is applicable to employees in both private and public sectors, thereby setting aside the use of defined benefit plan permitted by SAS 8, Accounting for Employee Retirement Benefits.
4.0 CONCLUSION In conclusion, it was established that the regulatory authorities providing the regulations discussed in this unit has an enabling law that guides the activities of the various institutions operating in the sector.
The Central Bank of Nigeria has the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 1991, the Nigerian Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has the Nigerian Insurance Act 2003, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the Investment and Securities Act, 1999.
These Acts provide some specific requirements relating to the accounts of every corporate entity within its fold.

Combinations of this nature do not affect the existence of the combined companies, as separate legal entities.
However, this transfer of control from one group of owners to another affect the economic substance of members of the group.
To this effect, the operations of group companies and the preparation of consolidated financial statements are regulated by an Act and International Accounting Standards.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 THE NEED FOR GROUP ACCOUNTS In Nigeria, the main reporting obligations of directors of parent companies are contained in the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2004.
Section 336 of the Act, requires the Directors of a company 190 that has subsidiaries, at the end of the year, to prepare its individual accounts for that year and the group financial statements.
These statements report on the state of affairs, the profit and loss of the company and its subsidiaries.
The objective is to provide the shareholders of the parent company with full information concerning the activities of the entire economic unit in which they have invested.
This is achieved by combining all the assets and liabilities of the parent company and its subsidiaries into a single balance sheet so as to disclose the overall financial position of the group.
3.2 REGULATORY DOCUMENTS (a) The Companies and Allied Matters Act Cap.

(e) International Accounting Standard (IAS) 31- on Interests in Joint Ventures.
3.3 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A group is defined as a parent company and its subsidiaries.
Group financial statements are the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries combined to form a set of consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated financial statements of a group presented as those of a single enterprise.
In accordance with the Act, the group’s financial statements shall consist of three statements as follows: (a) Consolidated balance sheet dealing with the state of affairs of the company and all the subsidiaries of the company; (b) Consolidated profit and loss account of the company and its subsidiaries; and (c) Consolidated statement of cash flows of the company and its subsidiaries.
It is not necessary to publish the parent company’s profit and loss account, provided the company’ consolidated profit and loss accounts contains a note stating how much of the parent company’s profit and loss is dealt with in the accounts (CAMA 2004).
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE According to the Act, what makes up the group’s financial statements?
3.4 PARENT/HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES A holding company is one that has one or more subsidiaries.
A subsidiary is an enterprise that is controlled by another enterprise known as the parent.
Under section 338 of the Act, a company (say company A) shall be deemed to be the subsidiary of another company (say company B) if (a) The company (company B) is a member of it and controls the composition of its board of directors; or (b) Holds more than half the nominal value of its equity share capital; or 191 (c) The first mentioned company (company A) is a subsidiary of any company which is a subsidiary of company B.
For the purpose of the Act, the composition of the board of directors of a company, shall be deemed to be controlled by another company if that other company has the power to remove all or a majority of the directors without the consent or concurrence of another party.
Generally, control is presumed to exist when the parent owns, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries more than one half of the voting power of an enterprise.
SAS 27, defines control as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so to obtain benefits from its activities.
Under the standard, control is also presumed to exist when the parent has: 1.
Power over more than half the voting right by virtue of agreement with other investors.
2.
Power to govern the financial and operating policies of the enterprise under a statute or agreement.
3.
Power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors.
4.
Power to cast the majority of votes at a meeting of board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body.
ILLUSTRATION 29 Company X is said to be a subsidiary of company Y, when: (i) company Y is a member of company X and controls the composition of the Board of Directors (BOD).
This means that Company Y has the power to appoint or remove all or the majority of votes at the meeting of BOD.
(ii) company Y owns more than one half of the nominal value of the equity share capital.
This is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the enterprise under a statute or an agreement.
(iii) company X is a subsidiary of another company Z, which is itself a subsidiary of company Y.
In this case, company Y would exercise control over Company X indirectly.
UNIFORM ACCOUNTING POLICIES (SAS 27) As much as possible, Uniform Accounting Policies should be employed by the members of a group when preparing the accounts of their individual companies.
SAS 27 specifically requires an entity to use uniform accounting policies for reporting such transactions and other events in similar circumstances.
Where a subsidiary has not adopted a uniform policy, appropriate adjustments should be made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
CO-TERMINUS ACCOUNTING DATES A subsidiary is required to prepare its own financial statements at or to the same date as the group.
If a subsidiary does not prepare its own financial statements at the same date as that of the group, adjustments should be made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between that occur between that date and the date adopted by the parent.
The difference between the reporting date of the subsidiary and that of the parent shall not be more than three months.
192 When it is not possible to obtain such special financial statements, appropriate adjustments should be made to the consolidated financial statements for any abnormal transactions in the intervening period.
The consolidated accounts should disclose: (i) the name of the subsidiary; (ii) its accounting date; and (iii) the reason for using different dates.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What would determine that company X has control over company Y?
3.5 METHODS OF PREPARING CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS SAS 27 prescribes that all business combinations shall be accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The method has the following features: (i) assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are measured at fair market value at the date of acquisition.
(ii) shares purchased and issued in settlement of the purchase are valued by the parent company at fair value.
(iii) the profits of the subsidiary are divided into pre-acquisition and post- acquisition periods.
Only the post-acquisition profits are consolidated.
(iv) goodwill arises on consolidation when the fair value of the consideration is different from the fair value of the net asset acquired.
APPLICATION OF PURCHASE METHOD Application of the purchase method involves the following steps: (a) Identifying an acquirer.
The acquirer is the combining entity that obtains control of the other combining entries.
(b) Measuring the cost of the business combination.
(c) Allocating the cost of the business combination to the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
FORMS OF GROUP ACCOUNTS Section 336(5) of the Act states that a parent company should prepare group accounts in the form of a single set of financial statements.
It however allows for alternative forms of group accounts where in the opinion of the directors, the other form would present the same or better view of the group’s performance and financial position.
Other forms of accounting for group interests available are: (a) More than one set of consolidated financial statements dealing respectively with the company and one group of subsidiaries; or (b) Separate financial statements dealing with each of the subsidiaries; or 193 (c) Statements expanding the information about subsidiaries in individual financial statements of the company or in any other form.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE What are the steps involved in the application of the purchase method?
3.6 EXEMPTION OF SUBSIDIARIES FROM CONSOLIDATION Under the Act: (a) Under Section 336(2) of the Act, group accounts need not be prepared where the parent company itself is at the end of its financial year a wholly owned subsidiary of another company incorporated in Nigeria.
However, where the ultimate parent company is incorporated overseas, the group accounts should be prepared.
(b) Under Section 336(3) of the Act, a subsidiary may be omitted from the group accounts if: (i) it is impracticable or would be of no real value to members because of the insignificant amount involved; (ii) it would involve expenses or delay out of proportion to its value to members of the company; (iii) the result would be misleading or harmful to the business of the company or any of its subsidiaries.
For instance, it may be harmful to consolidate the result of a subsidiary with operating losses, poor liquidity position and massive borrowing; or (iv) the business of the parent company and that of the subsidiary are so different that they cannot reasonably be treated as a single undertaking.
Under SAS 27 of the Act, a parent need not present consolidated financial statements if, and only if, all the following conditions apply: (a) The parent is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of another entity and its other owners have been informed about and do not object to the parent not preparing consolidated financial statements.
(b) The parent’s debt or equity instruments are not traded in a public market.
(c) The parent did not file nor is in the process of filling its financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory organizations for the purpose of issuing any class of instrument in a public market.
(d) The ultimate or any intermediate parent of the parent, produces financial statements when the parents elect or are required by local regulations to present separate financial statements.
(e) The subsidiary is acquired with the intention to dispose of the company within 12 months and management is actively seeking a buyer.
(f) When the parent company loses control.
The loss of control can occur with or without a change in absolute or relative ownership levels.
For example, where a subsidiary becomes subject to the control of a government, court, administrator or regulator.
A subsidiary is not excluded from consolidation because its activities are dissimilar from those of other entities within the group.
Relevant information is provided by consolidating such subsidiaries and disclosing additional information in the consolidated financial statements about the different activities of the subsidiaries.
194 Similarly, an entity is not permitted to exclude from consolidation a subsidiary it continues to control simply because that entity is operating under severe long term restrictions that significantly impair its ability to transfer funds to the parent.
Control must be lost for exclusion to occur (SAS 27 paragraph 21).
TREATMENT OF AN ENTERPRISE THAT CEASES TO BE A SUBSIDIARY When an enterprise ceases to be a subsidiary, the investment in the enterprise shall be accounted for in accordance with other SASs from the date when control is lost.
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSIDIARY EXCLUDED FROM CONSOLIDATION Under the Act When a company is not a wholly owned subsidiary of another company incorporated in Nigeria, the directors of the company should state the reason for the exclusion of the subsidiary from consolidation.
Schedule II paragraph 68 of the Act states that the notes to the accounts should include: (a) The reasons why the subsidiaries are not dealt with in group accounts; (b) Any qualifications by the auditors of the subsidiaries’ accounts not covered by the company’s own accounts; (c) The aggregate amount of the total investment of the parent company in the shares of the subsidiaries.
For: (i) the financial year under consideration; and (ii) previous year since acquisition.
(d) Such investments should be accounted for using the equity method of valuation.
(e) Where any of the information in (a) to (d) above are not obtainable, statement to that effect shall be given.
Under SAS 27, a parent that is exempted from presenting consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standard shall present separate financial statements as its only statements.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Outline those conditions required to be present for a parent company to be allowed not to present a consolidated financial statements.
3.7 EXPLANATION OF TERMS UNDER GROUP ACCOUNTS (a) Equity share capital This comprises any equity share capital which carries the right to distribution.
Therefore, it includes all share capital other than non-participating preference shares.
In the absence of information to the contrary, ordinary shares are assumed to be equity while preference shares are not.
(b) Equity method of accounting This is a method of accounting where the investment in a company is shown in the consolidated balance sheet at: (i) the cost of the investment; plus 195 (ii) the investing company or group’s share of the post-acquisition retained profits and reserves of the company; less (iii) any amount written off in respect of (i) and (ii) above.
The investing company should account separately in the profit and loss account for its share of the profit before tax, taxation and extraordinary items of the acquired company.
This method is usually applied to associated companies under the provisions of SAS 28.
(c) Related company The Act defines a Related Company as any body corporate (other than that which is a group company in relation to that company) in which that company holds on a long-term basis, a qualifying capital.
Interest for the purpose of securing a contribution to that company’s own activities by exercising control or influence arising from that interest.
Related companies are described by SAS 28 as associated companies.
(d) Associated companies This is an enterprise in which the investor has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the investor.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not have control over those policies.
A holding of 20% but less than 50% of the equity voting rights is regarded as the ability to exercise significant influence (though not in all circumstances).
(e) Fellow subsidiaries A body corporate is treated as a fellow subsidiary of another body corporate, if both are subsidiaries of the same company, but neither is the other’s subsidiary.
(f) Cost of control account It is described as an account opened to record the purchase of a business so as to determine whether the business is being purchased at a profit or at a loss.
In other words, it is a goodwill account.
A debit balance on the Cost of Control Account is regarded as a loss on purchase because the cost of shares acquired is greater than the net assets acquired while a credit balance on the cost of control account is regarded as a gain (i.e.
negative goodwill).
In the cost of control account, the cost of investment is cancelled against the net assets acquired to determine goodwill.
(g) Goodwill on consolidation Goodwill is the difference between the price paid by the parent company and the fair value of the subsidiary’s net assets at the date of acquisition.
Included in the definition of net assets are identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries.
(h) Fair value of net assets In order to calculate a realistic figure for goodwill, it is necessary to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary company when preparing consolidated accounts.
Fair values need not be accounted for in the books of the subsidiary company and used for the purpose of its legal entity based accounts, but they should be used for consolidation purposes.
The fair value of an asset and a liability is defined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’ length (IFRS 3).
If additional evidence of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities becomes available after the acquisition, the consolidated financial statements should be adjusted to reflect this development.
196 (i) Non-controlling interest (Formerly called Minority Interest) The 2008 amendments to IAS 27 changed the term minority interest to a new phrase called non-controlling interest.
According to the Official Pronouncement of the IASB as issued at 1 January 2009, “the change in terminology reflects the fact that the owner of a minority interest in an entity might control not control the entity”.
It is the view of the IASB that “non-controlling interest” is a better description than “minority interest” of the interests of those owners who do have a controlling interest in an entity”.
SAS 27 uses the new phrase non-controlling interest instead of the now outdated minority interest, and defines non- controlling interest as “the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.” When the parent company owns less than 100% equity shares in the subsidiary, say 70%, the remaining 30% is attributable to the non-controlling interest (NCI).
Non-controlling interest shall be presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity; separately from the parent shareholders’ fund.
Minority interest in the profit and loss account of the group shall also be separately disclosed below the profit after tax.
(j) Attribution of profit or loss to non-controlling interest SAS 27 requires an entity to attribute their share of comprehensive income to non- controlling interest (NCI) even if this will result in the NCI having a deficit balance.
(k) Pre-acquisition and post-acquisition profits The profits of a subsidiary company are distinguished between pre-acquisition and post- acquisition for the purpose of preparing consolidated accounts.
Pre-acquisition reserves are the accumulated reserves earned by the subsidiary prior to its acquisition by the parent company.
They are credited to cost of control account as part of the process required to arrive at goodwill arising on consolidation.
Post-acquisition reserves are the accumulated retained profits since the date of acquisition.
The proportion of these reserves earned by the parent company is credited to the consolidated accounts.
To the extent that post-acquisition profits earned by the subsidiary are transferred to the parent company by way of dividends, the amount to be aggregated when consolidation takes place will be reduced correspondingly.
(l) Other reserves of a subsidiary Other reserves of a subsidiary may include share premium account, revaluation surplus on fixed assets and other reserves.
The principle of dividing them between pre-acquisition and post-acquisition reserves will apply.
CONSOLIDATION PROCEDURES UNDER SAS 27 In its explanatory note, SAS 27 outlines the following consolidation procedures: (a) Financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries are combined on a line by line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.
(b) The carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary are eliminated.
(c) Non-controlling interests in the profit or loss of the consolidated subsidiaries for the reporting period are identified.
(d) Non-controlling interests in the assets of consolidated entities are identified and presented in the consolidated balance within equity, separately from the shareholder’s fund.
