This unit is designed to define these branches, and emphasize the purpose and focus of financial accounting.
In addition, there will be a comparison of these branches, which will dwell greatly on their focus.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: define Financial accounting explain the purpose and focus of financial accounting make a comparison between financial accounting and management accounting.
1  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Introducing Financial Accounting 3.1.1 Definition of Financial Accounting Financial accounting can be defined as the process of collecting, recording, presenting, and analysing/interpreting financial information for the users of financial statements.
These users include: the creditors, investors and government.
Financial accounting is mainly historical and reports the overall results of the firm’s operations during a given period and its financial conditions.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 What do you mean by Financial Accounting?
3.1.2 Purpose of Financial Accounting The purpose of financial accounting is to report, in aggregate financial terms, and during a given period, the overall results of the organisation’s operations.
More importantly, the financial strengths and weaknesses feature prominently in the report since factors/parameters such as profit or loss and net worth are stressed.
The reports are made available to the army of external users to make the necessary appraisals.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Explain the purpose of Financial Accounting.
3.1.3 Focus of Financial Accounting Financial Accounting focuses on users external to the firm such as the investors (both existing and potential), government, lenders, tax authorities, credit suppliers.
For example, government uses the reports to obtain data required for compiling aggregate statistics of economic activity, economic growth, capital formation, etc.
On the other hand, the banks (lenders) would need the information to appraise the credit worthiness of the borrowing firm as well as keep track of its financial soundness all through the period of indebtedness.
2  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Explain the focus of Financial Accounting relative to the users of accounting information.
3.1.4 Financial Accounting and Management Accounting Compared The comparison will be considered from the perspective of the following areas: Focus While financial accounting focuses on the users external to the organisation, management accounting attends to the internal organisation requirement for planning and control.
Scope of Report Financial accounting reports on the overall results of the firm’s operation within a given period whereas management accounting generates detailed financial and/or quantitative information relative to the different aspects of the organisations performance during a given period highlighting areas of concern to management for decision- making.
Considered Factors Financial accounting is interested in showing profit or loss whereas management accounting considers batch/unit or process cost.
Description of Report While financial accounting reports historically, management accounting produces more current and forward-looking information needed for decision making.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Compare Financial Accounting and Management Accounting.
4.0 CONCLUSION Financial Accounting addresses the needs of external users of financial information.
Comparatively, Management Accounting pays attention to 3  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING the internal organisation’s requirement for accounting information necessary for planning and control purposes.
5.0 SUMMARY We have been able to define financial accounting, and discussed its purpose and focus.
A comparative analysis of financial accounting and management accounting was made using such bases as focus, scope of report, considered factors and description of report.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT 1.

Therefore, the generated accounting information are presented to various interested parties for their respective decisions.
How is accounting information presented?
This will be the focus of Unit 2.
We shall find out that accounting information is presented through the medium of periodic financial statements or financial reports, done in consonance with specified accounting and legal standards relating to the style and content of presentation.
We shall look at the objectives and structure of financial reports, and discuss the Trading and Profit and Loss Account, and the Balance Sheet, under the structure.
Also, capital and revenue components of the structure will be explained.
Finally, we shall consider the treatment of account receivable and payable items of the reports.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: discuss the objectives and structure of financial reports discuss the components, and demonstrate the formats of the Trading and Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet 5  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING distinguish between the capital and revenue items of the financial statements; and discuss the difference between accounts receivable and payable.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Financial Statements 3.1.1 Objectives and Structure of Financial Reports The periodic financial reports comprise two major statements – the Trading and Profit and Loss Account, and the Balance Sheet.
While the Trading and Profit and Loss account measures the net income or surplus arising from the operations during the period under review, in order to know how actual profits compared with the expected, the balance sheet discloses the financial position of the enterprise (relating to the assets, liabilities and capital) as at a particular date, usually the last day of the accounting period.
The Trading and Profit and Loss account provides the yardstick for measuring the extent to which an enterprise has succeeded in attaining its profit-making objective.
It also shows the relationship between costs and revenues which serve as basis for decision aimed at improving future performance.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE1 Discuss the objectives and structure of financial reports.
3.1.2 Trading and Profit and Loss Account The Trading and Profit and Loss account matches a period’s revenues with the costs associated with generating those revenues.
Two components of the trading and profit and loss account are: - Trading account which discloses gross profit; - Profit and Loss account which discloses the net profit.
However, for a manufacturer, it is also useful to prepare “Manufacturing Account” which we shall consider later.
Gross profit is the difference between sales proceeds and the cost of goods sold in a trading account while net profit is the gross profit less the expenses of the business in the profit and loss account.
6  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The trading and profit and loss account of a sole trader (concerned with buying and selling) using the vertical format would appear as follows: Trading and Profit and Loss account for the period ended 30/6/xx N N Sales X Opening Stock X Add: Purchases X Available Stock X Less: Closing Stock X Cost of Sales X Gross Profit X Less: Wages X Rent X Sundry expenses X Total Expenses X Net Profit X 3.1.3 The Balance Sheet The balance sheet, which is often prepared on the historical cost basis, can be seen as a collection of the residual values of assets, liabilities and capital carried over from one accounting period to the next, to continue the running of the enterprise as a going concern.
Thus, the balance sheet lists a business’s assets, liabilities and capital at a particular point in time.
Assets are stated at book value, which may be historical or market value, but not at realisable value; (Book value is the amount of money that was paid to acquire a particular asset while the net realisable value of an asset is the money that might be possible to get by selling the asset).
Fixed Asset is any asset, tangible or intangible, acquired for retention by an entity for the purpose of providing a service to the business, and not held for resale in the normal course of trading.
The balance sheet of a sole trader using the vertical format would appear as follows: 7  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Balance Sheet as at 30/6/x N N Fixed Assets: Vehicles X Current Assets: Stock X Debtors X Cash at bank X Cash in hand X X Less: Current Liabilities: Creditors X Net current assets (CA less CL) X Total Assets X Capital Account: Balance at beginning of period X Add: Net Profit for period X X Less: Drawings for period X Retained profit X Balance at end of period X Let us look at an example: The following trial balance was extracted from the books of Alaba Enterprises on 31st December, 2004: Dr. Cr.

You are required (a) Prepare a Trading and Profit and Loss account for the year 2002 (b) Extract a Balance Sheet for Bamijoko Enterprises as at 31st December 2002 3.1.4 Capital and Revenue Items The ability to measure capital and revenue as well as the inter- relationship between them, is very important in accounting practice because capital generates revenue and it is this ability to generate revenue that gives value to capital.
There are capital and revenue items of receipts as well as capital and revenue expenditure items.
It is very important to distinguish between these items as their treatment differs in the books of account.
It is also necessary in the determination of profit made by the enterprises and in explaining why certain items go to the Trading and Profit and Loss account and others go to the Balance Sheet.
Capital and Revenue Receipts Capital receipts comprise the initial capital paid by the owner(s) of the business as well as loans and proceeds of sale of any of the assets.
On the other hand, revenue receipts are the cash received from sales of goods, discounts received, commission, interest on investment and all such monies arising from rendering services or in the normal course of business transactions in the current period.
13  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Capital and Revenue Expenditure “Capital expenditure consists of expenditure, the benefit of which is not fully consumed in one period, but spread over several periods”.
These are fixed assets like land and buildings and new factory which are acquired for the purpose of earning income or increasing the earning capacity of the business.
Revenue expenditures are those incurred in one period of account and whose full benefit is consumed within the same period.
Examples include travelling and fuelling expenses, repairs, postages, interest on loan and salaries and wages.
Usually, it is the revenue expenditure that is charged against revenue receipts to determine the profit made by a business in a given accounting year.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE3 1.
What do you understand by capital receipts?
Give two examples.
2.
Distinguish between capital and revenue expenditures and give three examples of each.
3.1.5 Treatment of Accounts Receivable and Payable Accounts receivable, also known as “Debtors”, is given rise to when allowance is made for payments to be effected sometime later after the sales transactions have been concluded and the goods changed ownership for the reasons that buyers need goods and services that they cannot pay for immediately, and sellers sell more through credit sales.
Credit sales are recorded in the sales journal and accounts receivables are current assets to the organisation.
Accounts payable, on the other hand, are normally current liabilities to the enterprise.
They are also known as “Creditors” which arise as a result of credit purchase transactions.
Accurate record of accounts payable is important to avoid omissions that will lead to an overstatement of profit.
Credit purchase transactions are recorded in the purchase journal.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE4 Discuss the difference between accounts receivable and accounts payable.
14  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 4.0 CONCLUSION Financial reports – basically, the Trading and Profit and Loss account and the Balance Sheet – are necessary to inform management and other interested outside parties about the performance as well as the financial position of the enterprise which form the basis for their respective decisions.
Capital and revenue items would need to be distinguished or categorised properly to enable the financial reports give a true reflection of the financial affairs.
Also, due care should be taken in deciding on, and recording matters, relating to accounts payable and accounts receivable in order to have a good relationship between current assets, current liabilities and profit.
5.0 SUMMARY We have seen and discussed how accounting information is presented to all interested parties by focusing on the Trading and Profit and Loss account as well as the Balance Sheet.
While the trading and profit and loss account ascertains the gross profit on sales and the net profit or loss for the period, the balance sheet ascertains the financial position of the business at the end of the accounting period.
Also, the capital and revenue items of the financial reports have been discussed with emphasis on their proper distinction, recognition and recording.
Lastly, we considered the treatment of account receivable and account payment items.

Kindly refer to unit 2 and recall that the formats for the presentation of the Trading and Profit and Loss account, and the Balance Sheet, were those for a sole trader (sole proprietorship).
Like other profit-oriented organisations, it is very necessary to keep and maintain accounts for sole proprietorships which enable the operators to ascertain the profits earned or losses incurred.
Various reasons could be adduced as to why the operators would want to have an idea of profits earned such as: (i) To ascertain or assess the capacity to obtain loans from banks or private individuals; (ii) To assist them to make future plans; (iii) To know how attractive their ventures are to prospective investors or would-be buyers; (iv) To know the profit for income tax purposes; (v) To know whether the concerns are doing well or not.
This unit will give attention to the characteristics, equity and drawings of/in sole proprietorships as well as their nature of tax.
17  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: discuss the characteristics of one-man business explain the equity composition of sole proprietorship explain “drawings” in relation to sole proprietorship discuss the nature of tax in one-man business.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Accounts of Sole Proprietorships 3.1.1 Characteristics of One – man Business One – man business (or sole proprietorship business), as the name implies, is a business concern owned by one person who often is also engaged actively in the running of the business.
The sole owner subscribes to all of the equity capital of the business which in most cases are raised from personal savings or soft loans obtained from relations and friends.
All incomes also accrue to the owner.
Other characteristics of one – man business include the following: (i) A sole proprietorship has no distinct legal entity.
Even when it is registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, the owner and the business cannot be separated; (ii) The owner has freedom to deal with the organisation’s assets without any restrictions imposed by law; (iii) Because of the limited amount of assets which a sole proprietorship business controls, it is often small and can be recognised easily; (iv) Its capacity to borrow (especially from banks) is limited by the asset base; (v) It has very high risk because of the inseparability of the owner with the business; (vi) The business outfit often goes by the name of the owner, and operates within a confined location, usually, not more than two branches; (vii) The structure is fairly simplistic in nature.
From the foregoing, it would appear that the compact nature of the sole proprietorship business should not present much difficulty in its accounting.
However and often times, smallness may impede the ability 18  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING of the business to engage capable/competent hands to carry out the accounting function and ensure good financial control.
Consequently, the accounting records kept may be incomplete and lack the essential ingredients.
These may impinge on the preparation of acceptable financial statements.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE1 Discuss the characteristics of a sole proprietorship business.
3.1.2 Equity of a Sole Proprietorship As mentioned above, the sole owner subscribes to all of the equity of the business.
The equity is made up of capital contributions in cash or kind at commencement or at a later date by self through personal savings, relations and friends, and all profits earned in the business since its inception but which have not been withdrawn.
This can be shown in the annual balance sheet as follows: N Capital b/f XX Add: Amount introduced during the year X Profit earned during the year X XX Less: Drawings during the year X Capital c/f XX It is very clear, therefore, that the capital of a sole proprietor is not fixed but varies from year to year depending on the: (i) Amount of capital introduced; (ii) Amount of profit earned; (iii) Extent of drawings; (iv) Degree of disinvestment (where fixed asset of reasonable value is taken out of the business for personal use).
Let us quickly say that there are no legal restrictions on drawings; prudence is the watchword.
Also, the proprietor is free to increase the capital position at anytime.
However, this flexible position of the sole proprietor in his unrestricted rights in dealings that affect the equity of the firm and the absence of legal ties could be disadvantageous in terms of the ability of the business to enter into certain types of transactions – especially, borrowing-where it would appear that the rights of the other party may suffer.
With this situation, the sole proprietor would be constrained in his ability to obtain capital or to grow.
19  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 The capital of a sole proprietor is not fixed but varies from year to year.
Explain this statement.
3.1.3 Drawings The sole proprietor’s drawings during the year affect the equity.
Drawings speak to the periodic withdrawals made by a sole proprietor (who is actively engaged in the management of the business) in anticipation of profits.
As we stated earlier, drawings are not regulated and tend to fluctuate from month to month depending on the personal commitments of the proprietor.
Drawings can also be taken in kind when the owner takes out some of the goods which the business trades in.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE3 Explain the features of drawings.
3.1.4 Nature of Tax A business which has a legal entity normally pays tax on its income.
In the case of sole proprietorship, however, since it is not a legal entity, it is not bound to pay tax.
Recall that here is a situation where the business cannot be separated from the owner, and that being the case, the income of the business is considered to be that of the owner for tax purposes.
The sole proprietor is required to declare such income, amongst others, in the annual tax returns for personal income tax assessment and payment.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE4 What are the tax implications for a sole proprietor?
4.0 CONCLUSION The sole proprietorship business has no legal entity; both the business and the owner are inseparable.
The owner subscribes to all of the equity of the business and the capital varies from year to year.
The proprietor makes periodic withdrawals known as “drawings” in anticipation of profits to attend to his personal commitments.
The business is not liable to tax because of its legal status.
Instead, the owner is taxed as a person based on the income of the business.
20  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have looked at some guides necessary to keep the accounts of sole proprietorships.
Apart from discussing the characteristics of one – man business, we considered the equity composition.
Furthermore, we explained drawings in relation to sole proprietorship, and discussed the nature of tax.
The proprietor, and not the business, is liable to tax.

Incorporation refers to the process of securing a legal personality for an enterprise with associated advantages/rights and obligations as provided for by the law.
In this unit, we shall consider the meaning of a company, its distinguishing features, and the issues and redemption of shares.
We shall also consider the accounts that are prepared for companies.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: define a company discuss the distinguishing features of a company demonstrate the issues and redemption of company shares discuss the accounts that are prepared for companies.
24  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Introducing Company Accounts 3.1.1 Definition of a Company A company may be defined as an artificial creature, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of law.
As a legal (artificial) person, it is separate from the owners.
It can enter into a contract, sue and be sued in its name, can affiliate with another company and open subsidiaries.
Examples of big Nigerian companies include UAC, PZ, UNILEVER, FIRST BANK, and NESTLE.
A company is legally formed by meeting the conditions stipulated in the Companies and Allied Matters Act (Decree), 1990.
The promoters must apply for registration at the Corporate Affairs Commission together with both a Memorandum and Articles of Association.
The memorandum must contain the following information: Name of the company, with the term “Limited” or “Public Limited Company” as the last word of the name; Objects for which the company is formed; Amount of the share capital with which the company proposes to be registered and the division into shares of a fixed amount; The address of the registered office of the company; A statement to the effect that the “liability” of the members or shareholders is “limited”.
The Articles of Association, on the other hand, is a document setting out the regulations for internal organisation, and contains provisions relating to: proceedings at meetings; alteration of capital; appointment of directors; borrowing powers of directors; transfer or transmission of shares; winding-up procedure, etc.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association, duly stamped for stamp duties and fees and accompanied by certain other forms, are lodged with the Registrar-General of Companies who, if everything is in order, subsequently issues a Certificate of Incorporation.
At that point, a Limited Liability Company is formed and those who signed the memorandum are its “foundation members”.
25  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE1 (1) Define a Company.
(2) Discuss the Memorandum and Articles of Association relative to the information they contain.
3.1.2 Distinguishing Features of a Company The following features of a limited liability company are to be taken note of: Separate legal entity which is not affected by changes in its ownership; Can own assets and incur liabilities in its own right; Can sue and be sued in its own name; Has perpetual succession – does not cease to exist upon the death of any or all of the owners; Liability of owners/shareholders is limited to the amount paid for shares allocated; Has right to borrow on its own account; Audit is compulsory; Profits are subject to Company Income Tax; Statutory books and returns include the registers of members and charges; annual return; minute books; register of directors and secretaries; register of directors’ shareholdings; the directors’ report for the statutory meeting; the books of accounts.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE2 Discuss five features of a Limited Liability Company.
3.1.3 Company Shares: Issues and Redemption A share may be defined as the interest of a shareholder in the company, measured by a sum of money for the purpose of liability on one hand, and of interest on the other.
Two main categories of shares are the ordinary shares and preference shares.
While ordinary shares entitle the holders to the divisible profits remaining after prior interests have been satisfied, preference shares entitle the holders to a fixed rate of dividend before any dividend is paid on other classes of shares.
Preference shares, which may be either cumulative or non-cumulative, may also carry the right in the Articles of 26  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Association to repayment of capital, on a winding-up, in priority to other types of shares.
When the Directors of a public company decide to issue shares, application forms (with prospectus) are made available to the general public for subscription.
Usually, subscribers are required to remit the amount payable on application, direct to the company’s bankers.
A separate bank account should be opened for each issue; the company will obtain from the bank the statement of receipts and applications and these will be entered in the application and allotment sheets.
The accounting requirement for the issue is to debit the cash account and to credit an appropriately designated share capital account.
The par value of the share determines the amount to be credited to share capital, and the paid-in capital in excess of the par value goes to a share premium account.
Example: LUNA NIGERIA LTD. has the following specified in its Memorandum of Association: Authorised Share Capital: Preference shares: 1,000,000 8% shares: N5 par value.
Ordinary shares: 400,000 shares: 50k par value Let us assume that 5,000 preference shares were issued and sold at N7.00 per share and 100,000 ordinary shares were issued at 75k, the entry to record the issue is as follows: Dr. Cr.
N N Cash 110,000 Preference shares (5,000 x N5 each) 25,000 Premium on preference shares (5,000 x N7 – N5) 10,000 Ordinary shares (100,000 x 50k) 50,000 Premium on ordinary shares (100,000 x 75k – 50k) 25,000 110,000 110,000 Note that the premium is usually treated as a capital reserve.
It is not a profit as the company cannot make a profit by trading in its own share.
One share premium account may be used for both ordinary and preference shares.
27  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Shareholders’ section in the Balance Sheet (relating to the above transaction) will look like this: Dr. Cr.
N N Preference shares: Authorised; 1 million shares, 8%; at N5 each 5,000,000 Issued and fully paid; 5,000 25,000 Ordinary shares: Authorised; 400,000 shares; at 50k each 200,000 Issued and fully paid; 100,000 50,000 Capital Reserves: Share premium 35,000 110,000 Shares can also be issued at a discount on the following conditions: The shares must be of a class already issued; There should be a resolution of the company at a General Meeting authorising the issue; the resolution must be sanctioned by the court; The maximum discount must be stated in the resolution; The issue cannot be made until after one year of the date on which the company was entitled to commence business; The shares must be issued within one month after the sanction by the court.
Once these conditions are met, an entry is made to record the issue, creating a special ‘Discount on Shares Account’.
Example: If LUNA NIGERIA LTD issued for cash 200,000 of its ordinary shares at 40k per share, the entry to record would be: Dr. Cr.
N N Cash 80,000 Discount on Ordinary shares 20,000 Ordinary share capital 100,000 100,000 100,000 28  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Note that the discount, like the premium, is never reflected in the profit and loss account.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE3 Discuss the conditions under which shares can be issued at a discount.
3.1.4 Accounts that are Prepared for Companies The law requires that every company must keep proper accounting records with respect to: all sums of money received and expended from day to day by the company; the assets and liabilities of the company; statements of stock held at the end of each financial year (where the company’s business involves dealing in goods).
The accounting records, in addition to being sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions, must disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company at that time.
3.1.4.1 The Profit and Loss Account The Profit and Loss Account or Income and Expenditure Account (for non-trading company) must be for the period.
In the case of the first account, since the incorporation of the company; and in any other case, since the preceding account.
Every profit and loss account must give a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the financial year.
The following is a summary of what is required to be disclosed by law either in the profit and loss account or in a statement annexed thereto: 1.
Turnover This is the total amount receivable by a company in the ordinary course of its business for goods sold or supplied by it as a principal or for services provided by it.
What would be regarded as turnover and the method by which it is arrived at must depend upon the exact nature of the business activity carried on by the company.

Cash borrowing and credit transactions create liabilities.
Generally, liabilities are recognised obligations of an enterprise to pay money or to provide goods and services to another corporate entity or individual.
This unit will discuss the matter of debentures and mortgages with emphasis on the accounting treatment of these liabilities.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: give meanings to debentures and mortgages explain the accounting treatment of these liabilities.
33  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Company Accounts II 3.1.1 Debentures 3.1.1.1 Definition of Debenture A debenture is a debt instrument.
It is a written acknowledgement of a debt by a company, usually under seal and generally containing provisions for payment of interest and repayment of capital.
For example, Cosmos Ltd. can borrow a large sum of money and will issue debt papers which can be bought by many creditors.
The effect is that Cosmos Ltd. collects cash from various sources but with a firm undertaking to repay each holder of the “debenture” the loan granted and the interest on it.
Let us note that a “bond” is the generic name of this kind of debt instrument.
The accounting issues with regard to liability include: the determination and recording of the amount of cash to be paid in the future; the computation and accrual of the cost of utilising credit or making use of loan over a period; record-keeping to know when a payment is due to a creditor and how much the payment will be.
3.1.1.2 Classification of Debentures Debentures can be classified in a number of different ways depending on their characteristics: On the manner of payment of interest (registered and coupon bonds); On the basis of repayment of principal (single payment bonds, serial bonds); On the basis of the underlying security (unsecured bonds, secured bonds); On the basis of early retirement (callable bonds, redeemable bonds, convertible bonds).
3.1.1.3 Accounting for Debenture Issues Debentures may be sold at par, at a discount or at a premium.
Debentures are sold at par if the issue price was equal to the face value, 34  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING issued at a discount if the price was less than the face value, and issued at a premium if the price was more than the face value.
Debentures are traded on the stock exchange and prices are quoted as a per centage of the face amount.
Interest is incurred on bonds on the basis of time.
Let us illustrate as follows: The Board of Directors and shareholders of CASIO Ltd. approved a bond issue with the following characteristics: - Authorised bonds: N200,000 (N1,000 per bond) - Date on each bond: 1 July, 2000, maturing in 10 years on 30 June, 2013.
- Interest: 8% per annum, payable 30 June and 31 December.
Casio Ltd. accounting year ends on 31 December.
Bonds issued at Par The investors who will grant the cash loan to Casio Ltd will pay N1,000 for each bond if the 8% interest rate represents an acceptable return on this investment.
The entry to record the issuance of the bond assuming they received cash for them will be: N N 1 July, 2000 Cash 200,000 Bonds payable 200,000 Being the N200,000 10 year bond issue, interest at 8% per annum.
The entries to record the interest payment in 2000 will be as follows: N N 31 December, 2000 Bond interest expense 8,000 Cash 8,000 Being half annual interest paid.
35  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The interest is reported in the Profit and Loss as part of the expenses of the business, deductible from the revenues of 2000.
In the Balance Sheet, the bonds payable is reported at its face value as a liability.
In 2001, the bond interest expense will have a debit balance of N16,000 which will be reported as follows: Profit and Loss Account 2001: Bond Interest Expense N16,000 The liability will be reported in the balance sheet, thus: Long – term Liabilities: Bond Payable (8% due June 2010) N200,000 In the above situation where the bond is sold at par, CASIO Ltd received a cash of N200,000.
It will pay as interest N8,000 for each half year, and repay the N200,000 on 30 June, 2010.
The total overall payment will be N200,000 + N160,000 (N8,000 x 20) = N360,000.
Bonds issued at Discount The market price of the bond fluctuates constantly.
The stated rate of interest on the face value of the bond remains the same over the life of the bond.
As a result, if the current market rate of interest is higher than the stated rate, the buyer of the bond will be unwilling to pay as much cash as the principal value on the bond indicates.
When a cash figure lower than the face value is paid, the bond is said to be sold at a discount.
From the example of CASIO Ltd above, assuming that the bond was issued and sold at 95, the cash received from the issue will be N190,000.
Therefore, the entry to record the above transaction at the date of issue is: N N 1 July, 2000 Cash 190,000 Discount on Bonds 10,000 Bonds payable 200,000 Being the record of N200,000 8% bond at 95.
36  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Let us emphasise that the discount on bonds affects the effective interest rate because the total interest payment is related to the cash received at issue.
The cash inflow, cash outflow and cash cost of using the debt in the above example can be analysed as follows: N N INFLOW Cash received at sale of bond 190,000 OUTFLOW Cash paid back on maturity (principal) 200,000 Interest: 8% x 200,000 x 10 160,000 360,000 DIFFERENCE Amount of interest cost 170,000 N170,000 ÷ 10 years = N17,000 per year Approximate annual effective rate of interest: N17,000 ÷ 190,000 = 8.9% per annum From the above analysis, the discount represents an increase in bond interest expense.
The effective rate of interest is higher than the stated rate.
The bond discount is written-off at once to reserve or it could be allocated to every interest period from the issuance of the bond to its maturity date.
In that case, it is carried as a capital expenditure and amortised.
How is this done?
In the example under consideration, N10,000, which is the discount, is allocated equally to each of the periods from the date of issue to the bond’s maturity (10 years).
It means that each year bears an additional interest expense of N1,000.
The amortised discount per each interest period is N500 (N10,000 ÷ 20, since they will be paid bi-annually for 10 years).
The first 6 months will be recorded as follows: N N 31 December, 2000: Bond interest expense 8,500 Cash 8,000 Discount on bonds 500 37  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Being the payment of ½ year interest and the amortisation of discount for six months.
The bond interest expense is deducted on the Profit and Loss Account of the period.
The bond discount account will be thus: Dr. Discount on Bonds Cr.
1 July, 2000 10,000 31 December, 2000 500 31 December, 2000 Balance c/d 9,500 10,000 10,000 The Balance Sheet will be reported as: Bonds payable 200,000 Less: Unamortised discount 9,500 190,500 Bonds issued at Premium Bonds are issued at a premium when the market rate of interest is lower than the nominal rate stated on the bond.
The effect is that the issuer collects more cash than the maturity value since the investor is willing to pay higher price to take advantage of the relatively higher nominal interest.
In accounting for the bonds sold at a premium, the measurement of the interest for each period and the net liability of the bonds payable at the end of each accounting period has to reflect the premium paid.
Using the example of CASIO Ltd above, suppose the bonds of N200,000 were bought for N250,000, it follows that cash worth N250,000 would be received by CASIO Ltd.
The appropriate entry will be as follows: N N 1 July, 2000 Cash 250,000 Bonds payable 200,000 Premium on Bonds 50,000 Being the issue of N200,000, 8% Bond sold at premium.
Here, the effective interest will be lower than the nominal interest and it is computed thus: 38  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING N N INFLOW Cash received at sale of bond 250,000 OUTFLOW Cash paid back on maturity (principal) 200,000 Interest: 8% x 200,000 x 10 160,000 360,000 DIFFERENCE (Amount of interest cost) 110,000 Approximate annual effective Rate of Interest: N110,000 ÷ 10 years = N11,000 per year N11,000 ÷ 250,000 = 4.4% per annum The premium on the bonds is recorded on a separate account and the periodic amortisation is used to adjust the interest expense.
At the end of 2000, the first interest period to record interest expense is as follows: N N 31 December, 2000: Bond interest expense 5,500 Premium on bonds (Amortisation) 2,500 Cash 8,000 Being the payment of ½ year interest and the straight line amortisation of premium.
The “Premium on Bond Account” will appear thus: Dr.
Premium on Bonds Cr.
31 December, 2000 2,500 1 June, 2000 50,000 The balance on the premium account is added to the bonds payable to measure the realistic liability in each period.
39  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The Balance Sheet will include the following entries: N Long-term Liability: Bonds payable 200,000 Add: Unamortised premium 47,500 247,500 For the year 2001, though the cash interest paid is N16,000, the interest expense will be N11,000 (that is, N16,000 – N5,000 premium amortised).
The bond premium has the effect of decreasing the interest expense; the total premium of N50,000 is allocated over the 20 interest periods.
The 2001 Balance sheet will appear thus: N Long-term Liability: Bonds payable 200,000 Add: Unamortised premium 42,500 242,500 Note that the book value falls continuously from N250,000 on the issue date to N242,500, one and half years later and to N200,000 on the maturity date.
The book value measures the effective liability at each date.
The rate of decrease of the bonds liability reflects the amortisation pattern.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE1 1.
Define “Debenture”.
2.
Explain the following with emphasis on their accounting treatments: (i) Bonds issued at par; (ii) Bonds issued at a discount; (iii) Bonds issued at a premium.
3.1.2 Mortgages The building or purchase of a house or office is often financed with a mortgage loan.
Substantial cash is received now, to be repaid later with 40  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING interest.
Essentially, such a loan is a long-term note payable with equal repayments made at regular intervals (usually monthly) over the period.
The note payable incorporates a mortgage, which is a conditional conveyance of property to a creditor as security for a loan.
If the loan is not paid, the holder of the note takes over the property.
However, the intention of both parties is for the loan to be repaid in accordance with its terms.
Let us consider the following example: On April 1, 1999, Rahony Ltd purchased a building for N1.5 million by N500,000 cash and assuming a 6% mortgage loan provided by Equitable Mortgage Ltd.
The mortgage agreement stipulated a monthly payment of N12,000.
The entries will be: N N Building 1,500,000 Cash 500,000 Mortgage (Loan payable) 1,000,000 The N1.0 million is the amount of liability.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE2 Differentiate between a “mortgage” and a “mortgage loan”.
Is there any relationship between the two terms?
4.0 CONCLUSION A debenture is a debt instrument used by companies to borrow money to enable them finance their activities.
Mortgage loans also attract creditors to companies.
Both create liabilities which are obligations of entities to pay money to other entities or individuals.
The importance of accounting issues relative to these liabilities need not be over- emphasised.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have discussed debentures and mortgages (that enable corporate entities to borrow money) with emphasis on the accounting treatment of these liabilities.

We shall consider all of these in this unit.
Emphasis shall, however, be laid on their accounting treatments.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: give meanings to amalgamation, absorption and reconstruction/reorganisation relative to companies discuss and demonstrate their accounting treatments.
44  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Company Accounts III 3.1.1 Amalgamation In its business sense, amalgamation means the merger of two or more businesses or undertakings.
A complete merger may result into consolidation; where two or more companies are wound-up and their businesses transferred to another company formed specifically for that purpose.
3.1.1.1 Closing the Books of the Old Companies The terms of the agreement will determine the procedure, cash and liabilities may or may not be taken over, but generally, the following accounts should be opened: Business Realisation Account to which is transferred the variables taken-over.
A liability has a credit balance in the books of the old company.
It is closed by a debit to that account and a credit to the Business Realisation Account.
Alternatively, assets taken-over are debited to the Business Realisation Account and the individual assets are credited to close the books.
The new company is debited and the Business Realisation Account is credited with the amount of the purchase consideration.
The balance of the Business Realisation Account is either credit (a gain) or debit (a loss).
In either case, it is transferred to a Sundry Shareholders Account.
In some cases, the net assets are taken-over at book values and neither a gain nor a loss occurs.
Open a share account, debiting it with the value of the shares received from the new company.
If there are additional assets received (like cash, debentures), new account will be opened for each.
Close the share Capital Account, Reserve Account and Profit and Loss Account by debiting these individual accounts and crediting the Sundry Shareholders Account.
45  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Debit the Sundry Shareholders Account with the value of items distributed to them (cash, shares, etc.)
and credit the individual share, cash and debenture accounts.
If the agreed terms permit the old company to retain its cash balance, discharge its liabilities and pay its own expenses, these transactions are passed through the cash account.
In essence, the cash is credited and the liability and expense accounts are debited for the settlement.
Note, however, that the Business Realisation Account is debited for the expenses of the transactions.
3.1.1.2 Opening Books for the New Company All assets taken-over are individually recorded by a debit, while all liabilities taken-over are recorded by a credit.
Also, share capital is credited by the nominal value of the shares issued, while if there is an excess of purchase consideration over the net assets taken-over, this excess is credited to premium on shares.
The procedure should be as follows: Debit each asset account including goodwill and credit the Business Purchase Account with the total.
Credit each separate liability account and debit the Business Purchase Account with the total.
Debit Business Purchase Account with the agreed price and credit the liquidator.
Debit the liquidator with the total value of the allotment of shares, debentures and cash paid, if any, in settlement of the purchase price.
Share Capital, Debentures or Cash Accounts are credited.
Where the new company obtains the benefits of any reserves or undistributed profits, this should be transferred to the credit of a capital reserve account; it cannot be used for revenue purposes.
The need for such a Capital Reserve Account is usually indicated by a credit balance in the Business Purchase Account – “credit” resulting from the fact that the total value of the assets transferred is greater than the sum of the purchase price and the liabilities taken-over.
Though the reserves taken-over and credited to the Capital Reserve Account cannot be used for revenue purposes, they can be used to meet the expenses of liquidation or may be debited to the Preliminary Expenses Account.
A balance in the Capital Reserve Account may be used to reduce the value of goodwill.
46  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING When the total of the purchase price and the liabilities taken-over exceed the total value of the assets, the difference is debited to goodwill.
In certain cases, the new company makes a further capital issue to provide for additional working capital or even for the expansion of capacity.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 1.
Define Amalgamation of companies.
2.
Discuss the main account to be opened when closing the books of a company during the process of amalgamation.
3.2.1 Absorption Absorption speaks of the take-over of one company by another.
In this instance, the company to be absorbed will go into voluntary liquidation, and the purchasing company will usually take-over the whole of the assets and assume the ordinary trade liabilities.
The entries in the books will be similar to those required for the purpose of closing the books of a partnership on dissolution (to be considered later).
The Realisation Account is debited with: the book values of assets not taken-over by the purchasing company; any loss on disposal of assets taken-over by the purchasing company; any loss on settlement of liabilities not taken-over by the purchasing company and realisation expenses.
Also, the Realisation Account is credited with: any profit on the disposal of assets not taken-over by the purchasing company; any profit on settlement of liabilities discharged by the selling company itself; and the total purchase consideration.
Individual asset, liability and equity accounts are closed in the normal way.
For instance, since an asset will generally have a debit balance, it 47  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING is credited to close.
Any account having a credit balance (debentures, trade liabilities, provision and reserves) will be debited to have the accounts closed.
In opening the books of the purchasing company, all assets acquired are debited and the share capital, share premium, liabilities and reserves will be credited with the agreed values.

3.1.2 Reconstruction and Reorganisation Reorganisation is a re-arrangement of capital structure usually necessitated by the accumulation of trading losses over time or of existing capital losses.
The sale of the undertaking of an existing company to a new company specifically formed for that purpose is known as reconstruction.
These could be necessitated: - for the purpose of raising fresh capital; - for amalgamating two or more companies; - for re-arranging the capital and the rights of members as between themselves for effecting a compromise with creditors.
Where a company has sustained a considerable loss of capital and is unable to satisfy its creditors in full, the reconstruction scheme commonly provides for a reduction of the original capital, a compromise with the creditors either for cash or for the issue of fully paid shares or debentures and the provision of new working capital by the issue to the existing shareholders of partly paid-up shares in exchange for the shares held in the old company.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Why would reconstruction / reorganisation take place in a company?
4.0 CONCLUSION Amalgamation, absorption and reconstruction/reorganisation relative to companies take place depending on the prevailing circumstances of each company as well as the purpose for which they are embarked upon.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have looked at the different forms of business combinations; companies can merge, one company can take-over another, or the capital structure of an existing company may be re- arranged by way of reorganisation.
In all of these, the accounting treatments are essential.

Therefore, for a partnership to exist: 1. the association must be engaged in a business which may be a trade or a profession; 2. the trade or the profession must be carried on together, jointly, for the benefit of all the partners; and 3. there must be an intention to earn a profit.
The above description, therefore, distinguishes a partnership from a political, religious, social, or philanthropic club or association.
A partnership agreement, which need not necessarily be in written form (although it is advisable or wiser that any agreements between the partners be put into writing as this will tend to lead to fewer possibilities of misunderstandings and disagreements between partners), will govern the relationships between the partners, including: 1. name of organisation, the type of business, and duration; 2. capital to be introduced by partners; 3. division of profits between parties, including salaries since not all the partners may be employed by the partnership on a full-time basis.
Such salaries will be normal operating expenses; 4. drawings by partners; 5. arrangements for dissolution, or on the death or retirement of partners; 53  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 6. settling of disputes; 7. preparation and audit of accounts.
At this juncture, it is necessary to note that, although the partnership agreement creates a legal relationship between the partners, the partnership itself is not a legal entity.
With the above background, the unit (being the first part of the three to consider Accounts of Partnerships) will attempt to distinguish companies from partnerships.
The unit will also consider accounting treatments relative to admission of a new partner, profit ratio after admission of a new partner as well as goodwill in partnerships.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Distinguish between limited liability companies and partnerships.
3.1.2 Admission of a New Partner Before we look at the different dimensions of admitting a new member relative to the accounting procedure, let us start from the point of establishing the partnership.
Each partner contributes an amount of capital.
A fundamental principle for the accounting treatment is that all aspects of an individual partner’s contributions, charges to and charges 55  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING by the partnership must be accounted for separately.
Recall that in the books of the sole proprietor, two accounts are opened for the owner: Capital account; Drawings account.
However, in the books of the partnership, three accounts will be opened for each of the partners, namely: a capital account; a drawings account; a current account.
Partners’ capital accounts are referred to as “fixed capital accounts” because they are not used to record drawings or shares of profits but rather: capital introduced or withdrawn by new or retiring partners; revaluation adjustments.
Current accounts are used to deal with the regular transactions between the partners and the firm.
Most commonly, these transactions are share of profits, interest on capital and partners’ salaries.
Drawings are made against the partners’ share of anticipated profits.
Drawings account is debited and cash credited to record drawings.
At year end, drawings account is closed off to the individual partner’s current account and crediting drawings account.
Let us note that drawings do not mean appropriation of profit.
Now let us look at the accounting procedures involved in the different dimensions of introducing or admitting a new partner.
(i) A new partner is admitted into the business when the capital base of the partnership is not affected: An existing interest in a partnership (that is, each partners’ share of the total capital and of the profits) can be acquired by a new partner through direct purchase from the existing partners.
This means that the assets and liabilities (capital base) of the partnership remain unchanged even though a new partner is admitted.
Example Peter, James and John, being partners agree to sell N60,000 interests to Andrew on equal basis (N20,000 each).
The capital accounts of the 56  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING partners prior to the purchase reflected the following balances: Peter – N50,000; James – N100,000 and John – N150,000.
The journal entries for the above will be: N N Dr. Cr.
Peter 20,000 James 20,000 John 20,000 Andrew 60,000 (Being the transfer of partnership capital to a new partner) By the above journal, the capital account of the three old partners is reduced by N20,000 each and a new capital account is set up for Andrew (the new partner).
Note that the admission of Andrew does not bring new cash into the partnership; the cash paid by Andrew to acquire the interests goes to the individual old partners.
Total partnership capital and assets remain the same; what has changed is the structure of the partnership capital – Peter: N30,000; James – N80,000; John – N130,000; Andrew – N60,000.
(ii) A new partner can be admitted through an additional investment in the partnership: This dimension increases total partnership capital and assets.
The underlisted steps should be followed to determine the appropriate entries in the partnership accounts when a new partner invests in the partnership: Determine the total amount of the agreed capital after the new investment.
Ascertain the new partners’ share of the capital to arrive at the proper credit to the new partner’s capital account.
Adjust the capital accounts of the partners if the asset values are changed or if bonuses are given to old or new partners.
Adjust the book values of the partnership assets, especially, if the total capital of existing partners plus the capital invested by the new partner does not equal the agreed capital arrived at in bullet 1 above.
(The acquisition of a new partnership interest by investment can be effected at book value.
Alternatively, the interest can be purchased at more or less than the book value).
57  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING An example Osagie and Haruna are partners with N55,000 and N35,000 balances in the capital accounts respectively (after adjustment of assets to market value).
Profits and losses are divided 60% to Osagie and 40% to Haruna.
A new partner, Jumbo acquires ¼ interest in profits and in the capital by investing additional assets.
The profit ratios specified in the new partnership agreement are 45%, 30% and 25% for Osagie, Haruna and Jumbo respectively.
Effect the appropriate entries.
With investment at book value, Jumbo pays in N30,000 for ¼ interest.
The new total capital and assets is N120,000.
Jumbo’s share in the book value is N30,000 and this is equal to the cash brought in.
No further adjustments are required since the total assets are equal to the new agreed capital.
The journal entries will be: N N Dr. Cr.
Cash 30,000 Jumbo 30,000 (Being Jumbo’s admission to a 25% interest in a total capital of N120,000) (iii) A new partner is admitted with a bonus credited to the old partners The partners (Osagie and Haruna) agreed that the total capital and total assets are to be N125,000, and the new partner, Jumbo, pays in N35,000 an amount, greater than the recorded value of his capital (N31,250).
Jumbo is paying a bonus of N3,750 to the partnership (in expectation of superior profit performance), which is divided between Osagie and Haruna in the profit sharing ratio that existed between them.
The relevant entries are: N N Dr. Cr.
Cash 35,000 Osagie: Capital 2,250 Haruna: Capital 1,500 Jumbo: Capital 31,250 (Being Jumbo’s admission by investment in a total capital of N125,000) 58  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (iv) A new partner is admitted with Goodwill credited to the old partners As in (iii) above, Jumbo pays in N35,000 for ¼ interest, which payment exceeds the book value of his proportionate share of tangible assets.
The partners agreed that Goodwill is to be recorded, with its value determined from Jumbo’s contribution.
Let us make the following deductions: o Jumbo contributed N35,000 for ¼ interest in total capital.
Therefore, total capital after his contribution is N140,000 (N35,000 x 4).
o The assets of the old partnership were valued at N90,000.
So the total tangible assets are now: N Assets 90,000 Cash (New investment) 35,000 125,000 The difference between the total capital and the total tangible assets of the partnership is the value of goodwill, that is, N15,000 (140,000 – N125,000) which belongs to the old partnership and is to be shared between Osagie and Haruna in the profit ratio.
(Goodwill will be treated in details in 3.4).
The following entries are relevant: Dr. Cr.
N N Goodwill 15,000 Osagie: Capital 9,000 Haruna: Capital 6,000 (Being Goodwill determined by Jumbo’s admission) Jumbo’s investment will be recorded in the journal as follows: Dr. Cr.
N N Cash 35,000 Jumbo: Capital 35,000 (Being Jumbo’s admission to a 25% interest in the total capital of N140,000).
59  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Note: The partners’ profit ratio remains as specified in the new agreement.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Explain the different scenarios of admitting a new partner.
2.
What are the steps to be taken in determining the appropriate entries in the partnership accounts when a new partner invests in the partnership?
3.1.3 Profit Ratio after Admission of a New Partner Here, we shall consider the method for calculating the profit and loss sharing ratio for partners after the admission of a new partner since the old sharing ratio would have been overtaken by events.
The old partners, in some cases, may wish to retain their former relative positions.
Sometimes too, they may prefer changes.
However, whatever is the case, the new profit ratio has to be determined/established and included in the revised agreement.
An Example: Jerome and Shedrack, being partners in business, share profits and losses in the ratio of 60% and 40% respectively.
The partners agreed to admit Lambert to a 25% interest.
You are required to determine the new profit sharing ratio for the partners.
The calculation will be as follows: Total net profits 100% Less: Lambert’s share 25% Balance for Jerome and Shedrack 75% Ratio for Jerome (60% of 75%) 45% Ratio for Shedrack (40% of 75%) 30% Therefore, the new profits ratio is 45%, 30% and 25% for Jerome, Shedrack and Lambert.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 If Kay’s and Kez’s profits ratio in the partnership business before admitting Kan to a 15% interest was 70% and 30% respectively, what will be the partners’ new sharing ratio after Kan was admitted?
60  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1.4 Goodwill in Partnerships We shall consider the meaning, valuation and treatment of goodwill relative to the partnerships.
Goodwill refers to the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business which can be valued and expressed in monetary terms.
It is a force that attracts customers; it makes a new partner to contribute capital over and above the saleable values of the tangible assets.
The goodwill possessed by a firm may be due to, among others, the: Monopoly enjoyed by the business; Reputation of the company in terms of quality of goods and services; Management skill and reputation of the partners, and the value of the labour force; Location of the business premises; Possession of the trade marks, patents, or well-known businesses name over the years.
In the valuation of goodwill, custom plays a great role in many sorts of business.
Let us discuss a few of the methods: (i) The average profits of a given number of past years multiplied by an agreed number: Thus, it is common to learn of three years’ purchase of the net profits as the basis for valuing goodwill.
For example, if the average net profit made by XYZ Company for the past five (5) years is N2,000 per annum, on the basis of three years’ purchase of the net profits, goodwill will be valued at N6,000 (N2,000 x 3).
Please, note that this method is purely arbitrary.
(ii) The average gross income of the business for a number of past years multiplied by an agreed number: Professional firms usually adopt this method.
(iii) The value of the business: The value of the business is estimated by reference to the expected earnings and the yield required, and from the figure arrived at, the value 61  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING of the net tangible assets is deducted, the difference being taken to represent the value of goodwill.
For example, the estimated future accrued profits of the partnership (less partners’ remuneration of N2,500) is N7,500.
If yield at 10% per annum is expected and the value of the tangible assets is N50,000, what is the value of the goodwill?
Capital value of business (7,500 x 10) N75,000 Less: Value of tangible assets N50,000 Value of goodwill N25,000 Kindly refer to 3.2 for the treatment of goodwill in partnership accounts.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Define goodwill and discuss the methods of its valuation.
4.0 CONCLUSION Although the partnership agreement or deed creates a legal relationship between the partners, the partnership itself is not a juristic person.
Each partner, in the partnership books, has a capital account, drawings account and a current account.
When a new partner is admitted, the profit sharing ratio of the old partners changes; a new ratio to include the new partner has to be established and included in the revised agreement.
Goodwill is an important factor is determining a new partner’s contribution to the partnership.
5.0 SUMMARY We have been able to define partnership, and distinguished between it and company.
In the partnership, we have discussed the admission of a new partner under different approaches as well as the accounting procedures.
We also looked at the profit ratio after admission of a new partner which has to change and form part of the revised agreement document.
Goodwill – an intangible asset, which makes a new partner contribute to the partnership over and above the saleable values of the tangible assets – was discussed as well.

You are required to show the asset of the old and new partnership and the goodwill.
Also, show the old partners’ shares of goodwill since it was agreed that it should be shared in their profit and loss sharing ratio.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: state the order of priority in the distribution of assets during a partnership dissolution treat the conversion of non-cash assets into cash for distribution to creditors and partners prepare dissolution of partnership accounts when assets are realised piecemeal.
64  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Accounts of Partnerships II 3.1.1 Retirement and Dissolution of Partnerships The decision to dissolve and terminate the activities of a partnership is known as liquidation or dissolution or winding-up of affairs.
While contemplating dissolution, there should be a clear perception of the order of distribution of partnership assets as well as a determination and distribution of gains and losses arising during the process of realisation.
Fortunately, the Partnership Act provides for the following order of distribution of partnership assets in the event of termination and liquidation of the company, which should be respected: - Creditors of the company; - Creditors of the individual partners; - Partners’ loan to the company; - Partners’ capital.
At this juncture, it is important to note that during the period of liquidation, some of the company’s non-cash assets may be converted into cash by realisation (and this segment deals with the situation when all assets are realised in full), liabilities are settled to the extent possible, and each partner’s residual interests are settled to the limit permitted by the remaining cash.
Gains and losses arising during the realisation period are given the same treatment as gains and losses from operations, thus, they are distributed to the partners’ capital accounts in the profit and loss ratio.
Example On 30th June, 2001, the partners of Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele Company decided to dissolve the partnership and distribute all assets to the creditors and to the partners.
After appropriate adjustments to reflect events since the close of the financial year, the following balance sheet was prepared: Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele Balance Sheet N N Fixed Asset (at cost less depreciation): Land 8,000 Buildings (cost N80,000; Depreciation N38,000) 42,000 Equipment (cost N140,000; Depreciation N50,000) 90,000 140,000 65  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Current Assets: Cash 20,000 Debtors 18,000 Stock 30,000 Prepaid Insurance 600 68,600 208,600 Represented by: Partners’ Capital: Oluwole 84,000 Osuji 39,200 Bamidele 68,400 191,600 Current Liabilities: Creditors 6,000 Notes payable 10,000 Accrued interest 200 Tax payable 800 17,000 208,600 The partnership agreement provides for a profit and loss ratio of 50, 20 and 30% for Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele respectively.
As part of the efforts to wind-up the partnership business, the following transactions took place in July and August: b.
The equipment was sold for N72,000; c. The land and buildings were sold to Zaki Ltd. for N60,000; d. All stocks were sold for N24,800; e. The insurance were surrendered for the premium of N400; f. All creditors and taxes payable were paid; g. N16,600 was collected from debtors and the balance written-off; h. N10,400 representing the face value of the note and interest due to maturity was deposited in a special account with Chartered Bank; i.
All remaining assets were distributed to the partners.
We are required to give accounting treatment to the recording of the dissolution.
Solution: Let us adopt a procedure where we treat each asset as a sub-realisation account, thus, the amount realised from the sale of an asset is debited to such an account and the loss or gain credited and the account is closed to the realisation account.
The cash book is debited with the proceeds.
66  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING We journalise the individual accounts as they are realised which brings out the essence of dissolution clearly.
Therefore, the journal entries for the July and August transactions will be as follows: N N (i) Cash 72,000 Accummulated depreciation (Equipment) 50,000 Realisation Accounts 18,000 Equipment 140,000 (Being the sale of Equipment at a loss) (ii) Cash 60,000 Accummulated depreciation (Building) 38,000 Building 80,000 Land 8,000 Realisation Accounts 10,000 (Being the sale of land and building at a gain) (iii) Cash 24,800 Realisation Accounts 5,200 Stock 30,000 (Being the disposal of stock at a loss) (vi) Cash 400 Realisation Accounts 200 Prepaid insurance 600 (Being the cancellation of insurance and collection of unexpired premium) (v) Creditors 6,000 Tax payable 800 Cash 6,800 (Being the liquidation of creditors and taxes payable) (vi) Cash 16,600 Realisation Accounts 1,400 Debtors 18,000 (Being the collection of debtors and the writing-off of bad debts) (vii) Special Fund (Chartered Bank) 10,400 Realisation Accounts 200 Accrued interest 200 Cash 10,400 (Being the additional interest due to maturity of note and the deposit of fund in Chartered Bank) 67  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (viii) Capital: Oluwole 7,500 Capital: Osuji 3,000 Capital: Bamidele 4,500 Loss on Realisation 15,000 (Being the distribution of loss on realisation to partners) Please, note that the loss of N15,000 is the debit balance on the realisation account which after the journal entries have been posted, and appears thus: Dr. Realisation Account Cr.

What are the issues to consider when contemplating dissolution?
2.
Outline the order of priority for assets distribution at partnership liquidation.
3.1.2 Piecemeal Dissolution of Partnerships Here, we shall consider the treatment of partnership dissolution when assets are realised piecemeal.
The winding-up of partnership may take place within a short period or it may be over an extended period.
The case of the extended period is when it is not possible to liquidate all obligations at the time it is convenient to end the partnership.
As in the example of Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele partnership in 3.1 above, negotiations for the disposal of assets may take sometime and the payment for assets so disposed may be delayed.
In this situation, therefore, what is usually done is to make payments to partners in instalments as cash becomes available for distribution.
It is necessary, in piecemeal dissolution, to give special attention to losses which may occur.
For example, all assets not yet realised could be regarded as potential losses and temporarily allocated to the partners before any cash distribution.
The reason for this is to reduce the possibility of distributing more to a partner than that which he will be entitled to eventually.
We can use the method of ‘Greatest Possible Loss’ to treat this.
Example: Using the balance sheet of Oluwole, Osuji and Bamidele (3.1 above), the partnership agreement also provides for a profit and loss ratio of 50%, 20% and 30% respectively.
As part of the efforts to wind-up the partnership, we will assume that all available cash was first distributed to the partners on 31 July, 2001, after all current assets have been realised and all liabilities settled; but before the sale of the fixed assets and immediately after the creation of the special fund in the Chartered Bank of N10,400.
On this 31st July, 2001, cash of N44,600 is available for distribution; but before this the partners’ capital balance was N191,600.
Therefore, the greatest possible loss will be N147,000 (N191,600 – N44,600).
At this point, let us note that two kinds of losses in the greatest possible method are: - losses already suffered through realisation and dissolution; 69  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING - possible losses in the future.
In the above example, the past loss was N7,000 (that is, loss on the realisation of current assets) and the maximum future loss was N140,000 (that is, the book value of assets not yet converted).
Throughout the process of dissolution, the maximum loss will consist of the two kinds until the process is completed when actual loss and the greatest possible loss will be identified.
The greatest possible loss is allocated/distributed to the partners according to the profit and loss ratio.
Therefore, on 31st July, 2001, the amounts that can be safely paid to each partner are indicated as: Oluwole, Osuji & Bamidele Partnership Statement of Capital Balances as at 31st July, 2001 Particulars Total 50% 20% 30% N Oluwole Osuji Bamidele Balances as at 30/6/2001 191,600 84,000 39,200 68,400 Greatest possible loss 147,000 73,500 29,400 44,100 Cash to be distributed 44,600 10,500 9,800 24,300 On August 31, all the assets have been realised for N132,000.
Therefore, the greatest possible loss will be N15,000 (N147,000 – N132,000).
The statement of capital balances in August will be: Oluwole, Osuji & Bamidele Partnership Statement of Capital Balances as at 31st August, 2001 Particulars Total 50% 20% 30% N Oluwole Osuji Bamidele Balances as at 1/86/2001 147,000 73,500 29,400 44,100 Greatest possible loss 15,000 7,500 3,000 4,500 Cash to be distributed 132,000 66,000 26,400 39,600 The statement of capital balances is not the same as the statement for distribution to partners which is prepared when the affairs of the partnership are terminated.

What is the “Greatest Possible Loss” in relation to piecemeal asset sharing at dissolution?
2.
Mention the two kinds of the “Greatest Possible Loss”.
4.0 CONCLUSION Dissolution takes place when partners decide to dissolve and terminate the activities of a partnership.
Apart from having a clear perception, it is necessary to respect the order of distribution of the partnership assets in the event of termination and liquidation.
Dissolution can take place when all assets are realised in full or when assets are realised piecemeal.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have discussed the methods of dissolution of partnerships when all assets are realised in full as well as when assets are realised piecemeal.
We have seen the order of priority by which assets are distributed in the course of liquidation according to the Partnership Deed.
Also, we dwelt on the accounting treatment of non- cash assets as they are converted into cash before any assets are distributed to creditors and partners.

Earlier in units 7 and 8, we had explained what a partnership is, and distinguished between it and a company.
We had considered also, admission of a new partner as well as treatment of goodwill in partnership.
In addition, we looked at the different dimensions of partnerships dissolution.
The focus of this unit is the accounting treatment relative to the withdrawal or death of a partner.
If a partner withdraws, what are the methods of repayment of his capital and other benefits?
And if a partner dies, what are the procedures for closing partnership books?
These questions will guide our discussion.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: prepare the books of a partnership when any partner is withdrawing ascertain the amount due to the retiring partner and how it should be repaid close the partnership accounts on the death of a partner.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 74  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1 Accounts of Partnerships III 3.1.1 Withdrawal of a Partner A retiring partner, in the absence of any agreement, is entitled to have all partnership assets (including goodwill) revalued on a proper basis as at the retirement date.
Any appreciation or depreciation so revealed should be taken into account in calculating the amount due to him.
The total amount so ascertained to be due is normally a debt by the firm to the retired partner.
An agreement may, however, be made between the partners whereby, in the event of the retirement of a partner, the remaining partners should assume, personally, the liabilities for the amount due.
Thus, the debt is no longer due by the firm but by the partners individually in the ratio agreed upon.
Before we go on, let us state that a retired partner remains liable for the partnership debts at the date of retirement.
However, when a new partner is introduced, by a contract of novation (substituted liability), the creditor may agree to look to the new partner in place of the old.
The partnership will adopt any of the following methods in settlement of debts due (value of capital and share of goodwill) to the retired partner: Outright payment (lump sum, once and for all).
By agreed instalments over a period of years, interest being allowed on the diminishing balance of the amount due.
The amount due may be regarded as a loan to the partnership to carry the right of either a fixed rate of interest or a share of the profits of the firm.
An annuity may be paid for life or for an agreed number of years or for the life of some of his dependants.
Let us explain and illustrate some of these.
(i) Repayment by Instalments: Here, the value of the retired partner’s capital and share of his goodwill are ascertained and credited to a loan account, and repaid by instalments with interest running on the outstanding balance.
Then, the amount due to a retired partner is removed from being part of the partnership’s capital.
Example 75  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Zak, a partner in a firm retired on 31st March, 1990, and his share of capital and goodwill was ascertained to be N76,000.
It was arranged that this should be paid out by annual instalments of N20,000 to include principal and interest on the outstanding balance at 5% per annum.
The first payment was made one month after retirement, and subsequent payments were made on the anniversary of the date of retirement.
Show the account in the partnership’s books until liquidation.
Ignore income tax.

Usually, agreement in respect of the interest payable and the conditions for repayment are entered into at the date of retirement.
Where an option was given to the continuing partners to purchase the share of the retired partner and the option was exercised, the retired partner would not be entitled to further share of the partnership’s profits.
His capital would be transferred to the capital account of the continuing partners who must pay him according to the terms of the agreement.
(iii) Repayment by Annuity: It could be agreed to settle the retiring partner by way of annuity for a certain number of years or for life.
A method of dealing with this matter in the partnership’s books is to transfer the amount due to an annuity suspense account (which must be credited with interest at a fixed rate per annum) and profit and loss account is debited annually with the annuity paid.
If the credit balance on the Annuity Suspense Account is 76  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING exhausted during the life time of the annuitant, subsequent instalments be borne by the partners and debited to divisible profit.
If the annuitant should die before the credit on the Annuity Suspense Account exhausts, the balance remaining on the account would be a profit to the continuing partners and should be transferred to their capital accounts in the proportion in which they share profits.
It is not advisable to transfer such profits to the profit and loss accounts or to the partners’ current accounts since they do not normally represent liquid resources.
Revaluation Approaches Two methods of revaluation approach may be applied in ascertaining the amount due to a retiring partner: (i) Payment in excess of book value of assets Suppose P, Q and R, being partners, with capital balances of N600,000, N800,000 and N600,000 respectively, and sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2.
P retires, and after revaluation of assets, the other partners agreed to pay him N800,000.
Therefore, the remaining partners, Q and R, will be charged with the excess of payment over book value of the capital balance of the retiring partner.
Usually, the bonus paid to the retiring partner is allocated to the remaining partners on the basis of their profit and loss ratio, which is 3:2.
The entries will be: Dr Cr N N Capital: P 600,000 Capital: Q 120,000 Capital: R 80,000 Liability to P 800,000 (Being the withdrawal of P from the partnership) This approach is highly favoured where the recognition of goodwill is difficult to be justified.
(ii) Payment less than book value: A partner may sell his interest in a partnership by accepting less than the book value of his interest if he sees a poor prospect for the firm or needs working capital for personal reasons.
77  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Using the example of P Q R partnership, suppose P is willing to withdraw and accepts to be paid N500,000, a bonus of N100,000 (which will be allocated on the basis of their 3:2 profit and loss ratio) will accrue to the remaining partners.
The entry will be: Dr Cr N N Capital: P 600,000 Capital: Q 60,000 Capital: R 40,000 Liability to P 500,000 (Being the withdrawal of P from the partnership) However, it will be observed from the above entry that the net assets of the partnership were not revalued.
Example T, K and O were in partnership, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1.
T retired on 31st December, 1999, and it was agreed that an annuity of N9,000 per annum should be paid to him by the continuing partners, through the partnership, and he accepted this undertaking in full settlement of the balance due to him.
The balance sheet of the outfit before revaluation of assets on 31st December was as follows: T K O Balance Sheet N N Partners’ Capital: T 90,000 K 50,000 O 40,000 180,000 Net assets (excluding goodwill) 180,000 To ascertain the amount due to T, goodwill was valued at N60,000, and the net assets were valued at N30,000 in excess of the amounts at which they stood in the books.
No goodwill account was raised and there was to be no alteration in the book amounts of the net assets.
Prepare the new capital account and the new balance sheet after T’s retirement.

What alternatives may be taken by a partnership in settlement of a retiring partner?
2.
Discuss the revaluation approaches in determining the amount payable to a retiring partner.
3.1.2 Death of a Partner Usually, a partnership is dissolved at the death of a partner.
The surviving partners and the executor of the estate of the deceased partner must negotiate a settlement for the partner’s interest in the firm where there are no specific provisions for settlement.
Alternatively, and as provided for in the Partnership Act 1890 (Section 42), where any member has died and the surviving partners carry on the business of the firm with its capital without any final settlement of account between the firm and the executors of the dead partner, the executors, in the absence of an agreement, is entitled to 5% interest per annum on the amount of his share of the partnership assets.
79  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Example O, A and U are partners in business, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of ¼: 1/8: 5/8.
The yearly accounts are made up to 30th September.
O died on 31st March, 1999, and A and U continued the business without paying out O’s share of the partnership’s assets or settling accounts with his trustee until 30th September, 1999.
The balance sheet as at 30th September, 1998 showed O’s capital to be N16,000.
The partners’ drawings during the year to 30th September, 1999 were N1,800, N500 and N3,500 for O, A and U respectively.
There was no agreement for interest on capital but O and A were each to be credited with a salary of N1,000 per annum.
Subject to this charge, the profits for the year ended 30th September, 1999 were N11,600, which may be assumed to have accrued evenly throughout the year.
You are required to: Show the balance of profits and salary due to each partner, and the total amount due by A and U to O’s Estate at 30/9/99, assuming that O’s trustee does not propose to apply to the court for a share of profits.

The Realisation 81  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING account will also be debited with any expenses of realisation, and cash credited.
(ii) Debit cash and credit realisation account with the amount realised on the sale of the assets.
Where any of the assets is taken over at a valuation by any of the partners, debit such partners’ capital accounts and credit realisation account with the agreed price.
(iii) Pay-off the liabilities, crediting cash and debiting sundry creditors.
Any discount allowed by creditors on discharging liabilities should be debited to the creditors accounts and credited to Realisation Account.
(iv) The balance of Realisation Account will be the amount of the profit or loss on realisation, which will be divided between the partners in the proportion in which they share profits and losses, and transferred to their capital accounts.
(v) Pay-off any partners’ advances as distinct from capital, first setting-off any debit balance on the capital account of a partner against his loan account.
(vi) The balance of the cash book will now be exactly equal to the balances on the capital accounts, provided they are in credit; credit cash and debit the partners’ capital accounts with the amounts paid to them to close their accounts.
In case the capital account of any partner be in debit after being debited with his share of the loss, or credited with his share of the profit on realisation, the cash will be insufficient by the amount of such debit balance to pay the other partners the amount due to them.
If the partner whose account is in debit pays to the firm the amount of his indebtedness, the other partners’ capital accounts can then be closed by the payment of cash.
However, if he is unable to do so, the deficiency must be borne by the solvent partners, in proportion to their capitals and not in the proportion in which they share profits and losses (Refer to the case of Garner Versus Murray).
Example A, B and C with unequal capitals, share profits and losses equally.
They decided to dissolve the partnership, and the Balance Sheet after asset realisation and liabilities discharged is stated as follows: 82  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Balance Sheet of ABC Dr. Cr.
N N Capitals: A 600 Cash 500 B 400 Capital: C – Overdrawn 200 Deficiency of assets 300 1,000 1,000 “C” is insolvent, and is unable to contribute to anything towards either his overdraft on capital or his share of the loss on realisation.
Close their books.
Solution The loss on realisation of N300 should first be debited in the profit sharing ratio to the partners’ accounts, thus, reducing A’s capital to N500 and B’s to N300; and increasing C’s deficit to N300.
A and B would introduce cash of N100 each to make good their shares of the deficiency, and thus, restore their capitals to N600 respectively.
Then, the balances remaining in the books would be as shown by the reconstructed balance sheet below: Reconstructed Balance Sheet Dr. Cr.
N N Capitals: A 600 Cash 700 B 400 C’s Capital overdrawn 300 1,000 1,000 The only true assets which the cash of N700 represents would be shared between the solvent partners of A and B in proportion to their capitals as follows: A - 60% of N700 = N420 B - 40% of N700 = N280 The only balances remaining in the books would be the debt balance on C’s capital account of N300 and the credit balances on the capital accounts of A and B – N180 and N120 respectively.
As “C” is insolvent, the debt balance on his Account will be written-off against A and B in the ratio of their respective capitals, thus, closing their accounts.
83  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Outline the procedure for closing partnership books.
4.0 CONCLUSION A retiring partner is entitled to have all partnership assets revalued on a proper basis as at the retirement date so as to reveal appreciation or depreciation, which should be taken into account in ascertaining the amount due to him.
Depending on the arrangement, his due is either a debt by the firm or by the remaining partners who may continue to carry on the partnership business thereafter.
On the other hand, and in most cases, the death of a partner dissolves the partnership.
Where the surviving partners decide to continue in the business after the demise of a partner, the deceased partner’s interest in the partnership must be settled appropriately, and the partnership books closed.
It is important to be conversant with the outline of the procedure for closing partnership books.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have been able to deal with the accounting treatment relative to the withdrawal or death of a partner.
We have been able to answer the question as to the methods of repayment of a partner’s interests when he withdraws as well as the procedure for closing partnership books at the demise of any of the partners.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT 1.
Explain the contract of substituted liability relative to the withdrawal of a partner.
2.
A, B, C were partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1.
‘A’ retired from the firm with effect from 31/12/2000, the determined amount of his share being N10,000.
It was agreed that this should be commuted by an annuity of N1,500, the first payment to be made on the following day and subsequent payments on 1st January of each year.
‘A’ died after the receipt of the fifth annuity payment.
You are required to show the annuity suspense account in the books of the firm, assuming that the amount outstanding is deemed to earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum.

So far in this course, we have assumed accounting situations where the primary goal is profit-making.
A non-profit organisation such as a church association, school, social club, sports club or charitable institution is one which is funded by members’ subscriptions or donations and such funds are used to achieve the objectives of the organisations.
In its book-keeping, although the basic principles appear the same, the kind of final accounts prepared by a non-profit organisation tend to differ from those prepared by a profit- making outfit.
This unit will attempt to explore into the nature of non-profit organisations, their accounting requirements as well as the nature of final accounts prepared by them.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: explain the characteristics of non-profit organisations explain the accounting requirements of clubs and associations prepare receipts and payments accounts prepare income and expenditure accounts.
86  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Accounts of Non-Profit Organisations 3.1.1 Characteristics of Non-Profit Organisations It is the nature of non-profit organisations, as their name implies, to carry on their activities without the profit motive.
They may trade or carry on any other type of business but with the aim of rendering service at the minimum cost.
This suggests that they may charge for the services just to recover costs with little or no surplus.
The surplus (not profit) they may make could be regarded as a by-product.
Usually, by way of capital, there is little permanent investment by members.
Any permanent fund is usually the outcome of periodic surpluses of receipts over payments or income over expenditure accumulated over a number of years.
Non-profit organisations usually have “Accumulated Fund” (as we shall see later) in place of “Capital”, and as a result, members have no proprietary right which they may withdraw or transfer upon cessation of membership.
The usual sources of revenue for non-profit concerns are fees, periodic subscriptions and donations.
At times, some trading activities may be carried out and a little margin made there from, for example, sale of magazines or journals, sale of food and drinks in a club house, etc.
Also, fund-raising activities like exhibitions and variety nights may be organised, from time to time, to get money.
The kind of final accounts prepared by non-profit organisations are either ‘Receipts and Payments’ accounts or ‘Income and Expenditure’ accounts.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Discuss the features of non-profit organisations.
3.1.2 Clubs and Associations – Accounting Requirements The final accounts which are presented to members of non-profit organisations usually reports to what extent incomes from all sources were enough to meet the expenses incurred during a particular period.
Here, “income” can be viewed or adopted either on cash or accrual basis.
When the cash basis is adopted, a receipts and payments account is prepared but if situation warrants adopting the accrual basis, an income and expenditure account is prepared.
We shall explain these statements shortly.
87  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING A balance sheet, as in the case of profit-making concerns, is also usually prepared which shows the summarised values of assets, liabilities and the accumulated fund being carried forward to the next period.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 What are the accounting requirements of non-profit organisations?
3.1.3 Receipts and Payments Accounts Receipts and payments accounts are merely a summary of the cash book for the period.
In other words, it is a summary of all the cash transactions carried out during a period.
This may be adopted when a very small non-profit concern carries out transactions on cash basis and does not feel the need for more sophisticated information other than merely being interested in assessing the entity’s liquidity position.
As a measure of success or otherwise of the activities of the period, the receipts and payments accounts suffer some drawbacks arising mainly from the exclusive reliance on receipts and payments (cash movements) as the evidence that the transaction has taken place.
Thus, they do not adequately disclose the results of the organisation’s activities during a period because: they do not take account of credit transactions – debtors and creditors are not disclosed; they fail to make a distinction between capital and revenue items; they take no account of accruals and prepayments.
Example Fitness Sports Club was formally established on 1st January, 2004 and was granted the free use of a clubhouse at Kokoma.
The following are its financial transactions for the year ended 31st December, 2004 as recorded in the treasurer’s only financial record, the cash book: 88  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Receipts and Payments Account Dr. Cr.

No cognisance is taken of the fact that income and expenditure of a capital nature, such as the purchase of equipment, has taken place.
No cognisance is taken of items such as subscriptions which may be in arrears or prepaid.
89  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Discuss the disadvantages inherent in adopting the receipts and payments accounts as a measure of the performance of non-profit organisations’ activities during a period.
3.1.4 Income and Expenditure Accounts The limitations of the receipts and payments accounts make it necessary for many non-profit organisations to present reports which are prepared on the accrual basis and in accordance with the principles of double entry.
Income is recognised once it is realised whether or not proceeds have actually been received.
In like manner, all costs would be taken into account once they have been incurred whether or not they have actually been paid.
In effect, income and expenditure accounts have to be prepared on the basis of systematic standard procedures of book- keeping.
The income concept, as disclosed by the income and expenditure account, is much more accurate than that disclosed by the receipts and payments account.
Note that income and expenditure account, and the profit and loss account are the same in form and structure, but differ conceptually, for example: In the income and expenditure account, revenue refers to fees, subscriptions, donations received as against “Sales” in the profit and loss account.
The difference between revenue and expenditure is known as “surplus” or “deficit” as against “profit” or “loss”.
Example Assume that in addition to the transactions recorded in the receipts and payments of Fitness Sports Club in 3.3 above, the following information is made available by the Treasurer: (i) On 1st January, 2004, the club had the following assets: Bank Balance N16,500.00 Equipment at carrying value 6,000.00 (ii) The register of club members shows: Membership at 1st January, 2004 20 Joined during the year 5 Membership at 31st December, 2004 25 Club members each pay an annual subscription of N300.00 and new members pay an additional admission fee of N300.00.
At 31st December, 2004, one member had already paid his subscription for the 90  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING year to 31st December, 2005.
It is not the club’s practice to treat admission fees as income but as a contribution towards accumulated funds.
(iii) At the end of each year, 20% of the carrying value of equipment is to be treated as depreciation.
(iv) The Editor/Marketer of the journal provided documentation indicating that N6,100.00 had been raised and that expenses had totalled N4,100.00.
You are required to: Prepare a statement of income and expenditure for the year ended 31st December, 2004, and a balance sheet as at that date.

The adjustments for subscriptions (nominal account) and depreciation were made.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 4 Distinguish between Receipts and Payments account and Income and Expenditure account relative to non-profit organisations.
4.0 CONCLUSION May we wish to conclude that non-profit organisations, as the name suggests, exist not for profit-making but to achieve the objectives for which they are established.
They could be churches, sports clubs, charitable organisations, etc.
What appears to be ‘profit’ at the end of their accounting period is regarded as ‘surplus’ which results from receipts in excess of payments.
Between the profit-making and non- profit organisations, although they adopt similar basic principles of book-keeping, they prepare different final accounts.
Non-profit 92  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING organisations prepare receipts and payments account or income and expenditure account instead of profit and loss account.
Also, they have “accumulated fund” in place of “capital” in the balance sheet.
Receipts and payments accounts are not actually accounts but summary statements – summarise all cash transactions carried out during the period.
Their major limitation lies their being prepared on cash basis hence they do not adequately disclose the organisation’s results at the end of the period.
On the other hand, the income and expenditure accounts are prepared on accrual basis and according to the principles of double entry.
Therefore, cognisance is taken of credit transactions (debtors and creditors), accruals and prepayments as well as the distinction between capital and revenue items.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, you have been exposed to the nature of non-profit organisations and their accounting requirements.
We have also considered the preparation of their final accounts – receipts and payments accounts, income and expenditure accounts, and the balance sheet.
However, because of the limitations of the receipts and payments accounts, income and expenditure accounts are preferred.

The goods (merchandise) are valued at the actual cost to the firm, usually obtained from the supplier’s invoice.
However, there are firms whose main activity is in the manufacture of goods for sale.
For these concerns, in addition to the trading and profit and loss account, a manufacturing account is prepared.
The manufacturing firm transforms basic raw materials into marketable goods, and during the manufacturing process, costs are incurred in order to complete the products.
These end products are valued at cost to the firm, usually the aggregate of the manufacturing costs.
Obviously, at the end of the accounting period, stock or inventory in this kind of concern will be at various stages of completion since manufacturing is a continuous process.
Three stages of completion can be identified: Raw materials (unprocessed and uncompleted stock) Work-in-progress (partly – completed stock) Finished goods (completed stock) The main difference between the trading and profit and loss account of a manufacturing business and a trading firm is the ascertainment of cost of goods manufactured as against the cost of goods purchased for reselling.
95  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING In this unit therefore, we shall highlight the objectives of a manufacturing account.
We shall also classify the manufacturing costs and draw a line of division between them and the non-manufacturing costs.
In addition, we shall discuss the valuation of closing stock/ work- in-progress in accordance with the basic principles.
Lastly, we shall look into the matter of ascertaining profit or loss on manufacture to determine the relative advantage of manufacturing instead of buying the goods for resale.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: explain the objectives of a manufacturing account discuss the classification of manufacturing costs distinguish between manufacturing costs and non-manufacturing costs explain the valuation of closing stock relative to manufacturing concerns ascertain the profit or loss on manufacture prepare a manufacturing account.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Manufacturing Accounts 3.1.1 Objectives of a Manufacturing Account When a firm engages in manufacture, there arises the need to ascertain the cost of manufacture as a basis for fixing the eventual selling price.
This need is met by the manufacturing account, which is prepared in such situation in addition to the normal trading and profit and loss accounts.
Therefore the aims of the manufacturing account are: - to disclose the total cost of manufacture; - to enable the firm to determine the relative efficiency of its manufacturing activity separate from its trading activities.
This is achieved by computing the profit or loss arising from manufacture on one hand as distinct from its selling operations.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Explain the objectives of a manufacturing account.
96  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1.2 Classification of Manufacturing Costs There is an obvious link with the costing records because the costs in the manufacturing account are involved with production, and the concepts of the manufacturing account are in fact really costing concepts.
Therefore, we shall examine the main elements and divisions of cost as used in costing.
Manufacturing (or production) costs are the costs incurred by a manufacturer in the process of transforming raw materials into finished products, which should be distinguished from non-manufacturing costs such as administrative and selling/distribution expenses.
The classification can be done as follows: Direct or Prime Cost - Direct materials - Direct labour - Direct expenses Indirect or Factory/Works Overhead Expenses By “direct” is meant that the materials, labour and expenses involved can be traced to the particular unit of goods produced.
Factory overhead expenses consist of all those expenses which are not easily traceable to the units being manufactured.
Examples include wages of cleaners and crane drivers, rent and rates of the factory, depreciation of plant and machinery used in the factory and factory power.
To summarise, therefore, direct costs and factory overhead make up the manufacturing or production cost.
However, to ascertain the total costs, which guide in fixing the relevant selling price, the non-manufacturing costs of administrative and selling/ distribution expenses, are added to the manufacturing costs.
Administrative expenses include such items as manager’s salaries, legal and accounting charges, the depreciation of accountancy machinery and secretarial salaries.
Selling and distribution expenses are items such as salesmen’s salaries and commission, carriage outwards, depreciation of delivery vans, advertising and display expenses.
In the manufacturing account, the manufacturing cost of goods completed during the accounting period is ascertained.
This means that 97  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING all the elements of the production cost – direct materials, direct labour, direct expenses and factory overhead expenses – are charged to the manufacturing account.
All administrative and selling and distribution expenses are charged to the profit and loss account.
You are to note that the manufacturing account is concerned with the production cost of goods completed in the year irrespective of when work started on them.
Therefore, semi-finished goods (work-in-progress) must be taken into account.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 1.
Attempt a classification of the production costs with examples.
2.
Distinguish between manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs.
3.1.3 Valuation of Closing Stock The inventory of a manufacturing concern may comprise raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods at any one time.
It is often necessary to ascertain accurately the cost at which work-in-progress is carried over from one period to another.
The basic principle followed in valuing stock is to relate to each type of stock a proportion of the total cost incurred up to the level where the stock accrues.
Thus: raw materials are valued at the cost of purchase (if lower than current market price); finished goods are valued as a proportion of the total cost of production; semi-finished goods (work-in-progress) are valued at prime cost only (although debate had it that it might have been more accurate to attribute to them a proportion of factory overhead once they have received some benefits from these indirect costs).
At this juncture, let us illustrate the preparation of a manufacturing, trading and profit and loss account.
Example The following are extracted from the trial balance of TEKI LTD, a manufacturing outfit, in respect of the year ended 30th September, 1993: 98  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING N Opening stock: Raw material 12,500 Work-in-progress 8,600 Finished goods 14,800 Purchase of raw materials 68,200 Carriage inwards 3,410 Factory wages 18,390 Rent of factory 4,800 Factory general expenses 8,360 Salaries of factory supervisors 8,740 Salaries of salesmen and office staff 22,570 Rent of office 5,400 Insurance of factory equipment 2,840 Bad debts 960 Office general expenses 12,930 Depreciation: Factory equipment 16,280 Office and distribution equipment 14,880 Sales less returns 215,000 Power and lighting (factory) 5,610 Power and lighting (general) 3,200 Closing stocks were valued at the following amounts at year end: Raw materials 14,480 Work-in-progress 10,250 Finished goods 18,390 Work-in-progress is normally valued in this firm at prime cost plus a portion of factory overheads.
You are required to prepare the manufacturing, trading, and profit and loss accounts as at end of year.

3.1.4 Ascertainment of Profit or Loss on Manufacture In the last example, we disclosed a composite gross profit of N85,590, which represents what was realised from both manufacturing and selling operations.
When we desire to ascertain the relative advantage of manufacturing instead of buying the goods for resale, the manufacturing account will have to be restructured so as to disclose separately the gross profit or loss accruing from manufacturing as well as trading operations.
The profit or loss on manufacture is ascertained on the basis of the opportunity cost principle, that is, by referring to what the firm would have spent in purchasing instead of manufacturing the goods.
Thus, if the total purchase value is more than the cost of manufacture, a gross profit on manufacture has resulted.
On the other hand, a loss will arise if the manufacturing cost exceeds purchase cost.
Therefore, it requires that finished goods are taken out of the factory at the estimated market value (purchase cost) instead of the actual cost of production.
Thus, the estimated market value is credited to the manufacturing account and debited to the trading account.
A credit balance represents a gross profit on manufacturing while a debit balance represents a loss.
The difference is then transferred to the profit and loss account as appropriate.
Example Let us assume the same data as in the previous example.
Let us also assume that the firm likes to ascertain the relative efficiency of its manufacturing operations, and estimates that had it not manufactured the goods, it would have purchased the total volume which it finished during the period at a cost of N150,000.00.
We are required to prepare the manufacturing, trading and profit and loss accounts of TEKI LTD, showing separately, the profit or loss on manufacturing as against selling operations.

How do you ascertain the profit or loss on manufacture?
2.
On what basis is the profit or loss on manufacture ascertained?
Explain the basis.
4.0 CONCLUSION Apart from the trading and profit and loss account, a manufacturing account is prepared for concerns whose main activity is in the manufacture of goods for sale.
The goods, because costs are incurred during the manufacturing process, are valued at costs to the firm.
The major distinguishing factor between the trading, profit and loss accounts of a manufacturing business and those of a trading firm lies in the ascertainment of cost of goods manufactured as against the cost of goods purchased for resale.
The manufacturing account, thus, aims at disclosing the total cost of manufacture as well as enabling the firm to determine the relative efficiency of manufacturing in place of buying of goods for resale.
5.0 SUMMARY The manufacturing firm transforms raw materials into finished goods for sale.
Costs are incurred, during the manufacturing process, in order to complete the products.
A manufacturing account is prepared for a manufacturing company.
In this unit, we have been able to highlight the objectives of a manufacturing account.
We have also classified the manufacturing costs, and distinguished between them (manufacturing costs) and the non-manufacturing costs such as administrative, selling and distribution costs.
We discussed, in addition, the valuation of the closing stock of a manufacturing concern, emphasising the principle that relates to each 103  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING type of inventory, a proportion of the total cost incurred up to the level where the stock accrues.
Finally, we discussed the ascertainment of profit or loss on manufacture relative to purchase of finished goods for resale, using the principle of opportunity cost by considering what the firm would have spent in purchasing in place of manufacturing the goods.

105  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT 2 CONTROL ACCOUNTS Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Control Accounts 3.1.1 Meaning of Control Accounts 3.1.2 Writing Control Accounts 3.1.3 Advantages of Control Accounts 3.1.4 Accounting Treatment of Certain Items in Control Accounts 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Readings 1.0 INTRODUCTION The whole process of book-keeping revolves around the idea that the records “balance”, that is, every transaction has a credit and a debit, and the total of the debits equals the total of the credits.
In other words, if there are no errors in the records, the trial balance will balance.
When a trial balance does not balance, it shows that errors have been made in the accounting entries which may be difficult and time- consuming to trace, especially in a large business organisation.
The problem of errors can be solved by having a control account for each ledger that shall act as a check on the accuracy of the entries in that ledger.
Most notably of control accounts are the debtors and creditors control accounts.
These are ledger accounts which summarise a large number of transactions, and should be free from errors if the trial balance must agree.
Sometimes, a ledger that has a control account is referred to as a self-balancing ledger.
In this unit, therefore, apart from looking at the meaning of control account, we shall consider how control accounts are written-up.
Also, we shall explain what advantages control accounts have.
And lastly, we shall go into the treatment of certain items in the control account.
106  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: explain the meaning of control accounts discuss how control accounts are written-up explain the advantages of control accounts give accounting treatment to certain items in the control accounts.
3.0 Main Content 3.1 Control Accounts 3.1.1 Meaning of Control Accounts A control account is an account which contains the summary of entries in the individual accounts in each ledger.
Put in another way, a control or total account is a replica, in summarised form, of the accounts in the ledger to which it relates.
By logic of extension, therefore, the balance on this account, all things being equal, will be equal to the total of all individual balances in the ledger.
The principle of control accounts can be applied to all ledgers but it is usually restricted to sales ledger and purchases ledger.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 What do you understand by a control account?
3.1.2 Writing Control Accounts From the explanation above, we understand that a control account contains the summary of entries in individual accounts.
However, the figures posted to the control account are not obtained from the individual accounts themselves.
For example, the figures posted to the debtors’ control account are not obtained from the individual debtors’ accounts while the figures posted to the creditors’ control account are not obtained from the individual creditors’ accounts.
Instead, the total credit sales, total returns from customers, and total discounts allowed figures posted to the debtors’ control account are obtained from the sales day book, returns inwards day book and discount allowed column of the 3 – column cash book respectively.
Similarly, the total credit purchases, total returns to suppliers and total discount received figures posted to the creditors’ control account are obtained from the purchases day book, returns outwards day book and 107  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING the discounts received day book of the 3 – column cash book respectively.
It has to be mentioned that the control accounts are memoranda records which implies that the entries in them are not made on the basis of double entry.
The double-entries are the ones made in the individual accounts.
At this point, let us summarise the sources of the entries posted to the control accounts: DEBTORS’ CONTROL ACCOUNT Debit Entries Source Total credit sales Sales day book Dishonoured cheques from customers Cash book Interest charged to customers Journal book Bill receivable dishonoured Journal book Credit Entries Source Cheques and cash received from customers Cash book Discount allowed Discount allowed column of 3 column- cash book Bad debt Journal book Bills receivable accepted by customers Journal book Returns inwards Returns inwards day book Purchases ledger contras (set-off) Journal book CREDITORS’ CONTROL ACCOUNT Debit Entries Source Cheques and cash paid to suppliers Cash book Discount received Discount received column of cash book Bills payable accepted in favour of suppliers Journal book Returns outwards Returns outwards day book Sales ledger contras (set-off) Journal book Credit Entries Source Total credit purchases Purchases day book Dishonoured cheques Cash book Interest charged by suppliers Journal book Bills payable dishonoured Journal book 108  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss how control accounts are written-up.
Give specific examples of entries and sources.
3.1.3 Advantages of Control Accounts From our discussions so far, let us highlight the merits of control accounts as follows: 1.
A control account serves as a check on the accuracy of the entries in the ledger to which it relates.
Thus, control accounts make it possible to localise errors to specific ledgers so that precious time is not wasted checking ledgers which have no errors.
2.
Because control accounts are usually put under the charge of a senior official, they serve as a check against error and fraud by the juniors who keep the ledgers.
3.
For management purposes, the balance on the sales ledger control account can be taken to be the total amount owed to creditors.
This saves the time and efforts of drawing up the debtors’ and creditors’ schedules, thereby, aid the timely preparation of draft periodic accounts.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 3 Discuss the advantages of control accounts.
3.1.4 Accounting treatment of certain items in Control Accounts 4.
Debtors’ Control Account a.
Bills receivable – where bills receivable and bills receivable accepted are both given, the later should be used because the obligation of the debtor on a bill arises only when he accepts the bill.
However, when only bills receivable is given, it should be interpreted to mean bills receivable accepted.
b.
Bills receivable discounted should be disregarded.
When a bill is discounted, no entry goes to the debtors’ account, and invariably, no entry in respect of that would go to the debtors’ control account.
c. Bills receivable honoured should be disregarded.
When a debtor honours a bill receivable, no entry is made to the 109  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING debtors’ account, and therefore, no entry need be made to the debtors’ control account.
d. Bad debt recovered should be ignored unless it had earlier been credited to the debtors’ control account along with the other sums collected from debtors.
In that case, it should be debited to the debtors’ control account.
e. Provision for bad/doubtful debt and discount allowable should be disregarded because they do not affect the debtors’ account at all.
Therefore, no entry need be made to the debtors’ control account in respect of these provisions.
f. Cash sales should be disregarded.
The entry for cash sale is to debit the cash book and credit the sales account.
Since no entry is made to the customer’s account, it would not be necessary to make any entry to the debtors’ control account in respect of cash sales.
5.
Creditors’ Control Account a.
Where “bills payable” and “bills payable accepted” are both given, the latter should be used because the right of the creditor on a bill arises only when the debtor accepts the bill.
However, where only “bills payable” is given, it should be interpreted to mean “bills payable accepted”.
b.
Bills payable honoured should be ignored because when a bill payable is honoured, no entry is made to the creditors’ account and, of course, no entry need be made to the creditors’ control account.
c. Provision for discount receivable should be disregarded because it does not affect the creditors’ control account.
d. Cash purchases should be disregarded because the related entries have nothing to do with either the creditors’ account or the creditors’ control account.
Example 110  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Maduako, a sole trader, keeps his books so that a sales ledger control account and a purchases ledger control account are shown in his general ledger and balanced at the end of the month.
From the following details, show how these two control accounts will appear in the general ledger for the month of December, 1997.

The notable control accounts are the debtors and creditors control accounts.
A control account has the advantage of serving as a check on the accuracy of the entries in the ledger to which it relates.
5.0 SUMMARY We have seen the control (or total) account as one which contains the summary of entries in the individual accounts in each ledger.
We have also observed that the figures posted to the control accounts are not obtained from the individual accounts themselves.
Mention was made that the control accounts are memoranda records which means that the entries in them are not made on the double-entry principle.
We have also considered the various advantages which control accounts can offer as well as the accounting treatment given to certain items in the control accounts.

None of these two statements deals with liquidity, that is, the ability of the firm to meet its maturing obligations.
The Profit and Loss Account cannot measure this because it is prepared on accrual basis.
Therefore, the net ‘profit’ or ‘loss’ cannot be equated with the extent of growth or decline in the cash or even working capital position.
To address this mater of liquidity, the “Funds Flow Statement” or “The Statement of Sources and Application of Funds” is usually prepared.
This will be the focus of this unit – the concept of funds, relevance of funds flow statement, flow of funds in a business, preparing a funds flow statement.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: explain the concept of funds discuss the relevance of funds flow statement explain the flow of funds in a business prepare a funds flow statement.
115  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Funds Flow Statement 3.1.1 The Concept of Funds The term “funds” may be defined as the financial resources possessed by a firm and which flows from transactions concluded with third parties.
Therefore, “funds” may be identified as the total value that is available to an entity for the pursuit of its objectives.
Funds are represented by cash in the most liquid form, but since all other forms of assets have the ultimate possibility of being converted into cash, they represent part of the total funds of the business.
The total funds of a business firm are, therefore, the total value of the assets employed by the firm.
However, in the measurement of liquidity, interest would be in the more liquid forms of fund like cash or near cash, current assets (or working capital).
3.1.2 Relevance of Funds Flow Statement The funds flow statement is a requirement of the Companies and Allied Matters Decree of 1990.
It attempts to show how the funds available to the firm has been managed during the outgoing period, what new funds were generated and how these funds were, together with the existing ones, utilised (Sources and Applications).
The statement supplies the users of financial statements with useful and relevant information.
For example, answers to the following questions may be obtained from this statement: Was sufficient cash generated from operations to pay the interest charges, dividend and taxation?
How was expansion funded?
Is the company a net generator or user of cash?
Does the company generate sufficient cash from its operations to maintain its present operating capacity?
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 Assess the relevance of the funds flow statement.
116  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1.3 Flow of Funds in a Business A business operation comprises a continuous flow of funds in and out of the firm.
At the start, funds are received from the owners of business and long-term creditors such as debentures or loan stock holders.
Funds flow out when fixed assets are acquired.
Subsequently, funds flow in and out of the firm as it buys and sells its wares.
The following figure shows sources and application of business funds: Capital Introduced Acquisition of Fixed Assets Proceeds from Purchase asset disposal of Stock The Firm’s Retained Earnings and Provisions Funds Credit Extended Loans Investments outside Trade Credit the Business SOURCES AND APPLICATION OF BUSINESS FUNDS 3.1.4 Preparing a Funds Flow Statement Interest in liquidity is because of the importance of cash for the continued existence of the business organisation (solvency).
A certain minimum amount of cash is required for the continued operation of the business and for meeting the normal obligations as well as extraordinary items as they fall due.
Basically, there are two ways of preparing a funds flow statement: - Cash basis (funds in the most liquid state) - Working capital basis (cash plus all near-liquid assets) Whichever basis is adopted, however, the basic structure of the report is the same.
The approach is to take the balance sheets prepared as at two dates and determine, by comparing the individual items appearing therein, which items have generated funds and which have applied funds.
The sources and applications would then be summed separately, the difference in the totals would represent the “net change” in the cash or working capital position.
117  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The basic principle for determining sources and application of funds from two balance sheets can be stated as follows: an increase in an asset is an application while a decrease is a source; an increase in a liability is a source while a decrease is an application.
The usual “sources” and “applications” may be summarized: S/N Sources S/N Applications 1.
Profit for the year 1.
Acquisition of fixed assets 2.
Depreciation and other 2.
New investments outside the write-offs not associated business with immediate cash outlay 3.
Increase in liabilities 3.
Increase in assets 4.
Decrease in fixed assets 4.
Decrease in liabilities 5.

SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 What specific purpose is fulfilled by the preparation of a funds flow statement along with the other financial reports?
4.0 CONCLUSION Funds flow statement addresses the matter of liquidity – ability of the firm to meet its maturing obligations – which information is hard to find in the presented Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet.
Funds flow statement could be prepared either on cash basis or on the basis of working capital.
It guards against overtrading (a point of acute illiquidity) or maintaining a high cash balance that may threaten the future profitability of the business.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit, we have considered the preparation of funds flow statement or the Statement of Source and Application of Funds in order to address the liquidity information deficiencies of the Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet.
The statement assists companies to strike a balance between liquidity and profitability relative to the business operations.
6.0 TUTOR-MARKED ASSIGNMENT From the example of BOYUS COMPANY LTD above, prepare a Funds Flow Statement for the year, 2006 on the basis of working capital, and comment on the statement.

We established that these reports assist the management and other interested users like the investors, analysts, creditors, to take appropriate financial decisions.
Therefore, financial statements are prepared not as an end in themselves but in order that users can make decisions.
To be very useful in this regard, financial statements need to be analysed and interpreted, so that the relationships between different parts of the reports will be more clearly seen.
In the analysis of financial statements, we have to recognise that the different users of financial information have different needs, for example: 1.
Management needs information for control of costs and improved profitability; 2.
Lenders need information for borrowing and credit purposes; 3.
Shareholders and investment analysts require financial information to make investment decisions – buying and selling of shares, etc.
Bearing in mind that the relevance of financial analysis cannot be overemphasised, this unit will attempt to answer the following questions: 1.
What is the usefulness of financial analysis?

What are the ways in which accounting reports can be analysed and made more meaningful to the users?
As managers and would-be managers, we need to have adequate information to be guided or aided in taking appropriate financial decisions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to: discuss the usefulness of financial analysis discuss the various ways of analysing financial statements.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Introducing Analysis of Financial Statements 3.1.1 Usefulness of Financial Analysis Financial analysis may be simply defined as knowing what to look for and how to interpret it.
The information gathered by calculating ratios will allow comparisons with: the performance of the business in previous years; the budgeted or planned performance in the current year; the performance of similar businesses.
More specifically, financial analysis will be useful to the users in the light of the following: Since the shareholders and potential shareholders will be interested in its profitability, it will aid them in measuring the returns on their investment in equity; It will also aid the shareholders to establish the financial stability of the company in order to assess the risk attached to their investment; Financial analysis will aid the suppliers of short-term credit (bank overdraft or supply of goods on credit) to assess the ability of the company to pay its debt promptly; Suppliers of long-term credit (such as mortgage bonds and debentures) will be better guided in assessing the company’s ability to meet its annual interest obligations as well as its ability to repay the debt; 123  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Management is assisted in taking decisions that make for efficient and effective operations in order to maximise the wealth of the shareholders and ensure continued operations.
Apart from the ratios, it is essential that the following factors about the organisation’s environment should be analysed: - Markets in which the concern functions; - General economic conditions; - Size of business in relation to competitors.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1 How useful is the analysis of financial statements?
3.1.2 Various Ways of Financial Analysis The various ways of financial analysis are: Trend analysis Percentage analysis Ratio analysis 3.1.2.1 Trend Analysis One of the easiest ways of making accounting information more meaningful is to build up a trend with them, which means developing a time series analysis of important accounting factors for a number of years.
It is easy to see whether over time the company has done better or worse if the major highlights of the financial statements (relative to funds employed, employment of funds and turnover/profit) are compiled for three, four or five years.
This type of analysis is a legal requirement for firms presenting corporate accounts and is essentially an inter-period comparison of the results of one firm.
Although trend analysis is useful, it also has limitations.
Majorly, in concentrating only on one firm, it fails to meet the requirement of most users of accounting information to be able to compare their potential well-being as a result of investing in two or more alternative companies.
3.1.2.2 Percentage Analysis The limitations of the trend analysis calls for the use of other ways of analysis to supplement them.
In percentage analysis, the items 124  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING appearing in the Trading, Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet are expressed as percentage of total sales and total assets respectively.
If this is done for several years, the changes in the relative proportions of total sales or total assets contributed, or accounted for, by individual items from your to year can be highlighted.
Thus, one would not only see a trend but also even isolate the items on which performance appears to have improved or deteriorated.
This can be useful aid of control since performance could be optimised if efforts were then concentrated on remedying those items in which things seem to be going wrong.
The direction of future changes could also be detected early, rationalised or influenced.
3.2.2 Ratio Analysis Undoubtedly, ratio analysis is the most popular of all analytical techniques.
It may be defined as the selection of two line items which have a meaningful relationship and expressing that relationship as a ratio.
In ratio analysis, the principle of factor relationship covers a wide range of items which could be of possible interest to the different users of accounting information.
Thus, ratio analysis yields percentage or other coefficients of the relationships between any two accounting factors once some closeness is exhibited by the two factors.
For example, profit may be related to turnover or equity funds or total long-term funds (capital employed); turnover may be related to inventory or trade debtors; fixed assets may be related to long-term funds; current assets related to current liabilities, etc.
This will be treated in details in Unit 15.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 2 Discuss the Trend Analysis relative to its meaning and limitations.
4.0 CONCLUSION Financial statements need to be analysed and interpreted for them to be useful in taking financial decisions.
The trend, percentage and ratio analyses can be employed although they have their usefulness and limitations.

2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you will be able to demonstrate the use of ratios in the analysis of financial statements.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Analysis of Financial Statements II 3.1.1 Ratio Analysis Ratio analysis attempts to determine some notion of the standard relationship which ought to exist between any two factors, and to interpret the specific relationship in anyone form in terms of the extent to which the firm attains to that standard.
The attainment of that standard would be interpreted as good performance or healthy financial condition or otherwise.
The following considerations, therefore, can be made in the analysis of ratio: If a ratio has been computed over a number of time periods, does it show a worsening or an improving situation?
Can the ratio be compared to an objective standard?
That is, can it be compared with an ‘ideal’ ratio?
127  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Do all the ratios when taken together support the conclusions drawn from each individual ratio?
Ratios can be classified variously, but we shall adopt the following: Profitability Ratios i.
Gross profit and net profit margin ii Returns on assets managed iii Returns on capital employed (ROCE) iv Returns on equity (ROE) Liquidity Ratios i.
Current ratio ii.
Quick (or acid test) ratio Leverage Ratios i.
Debt ratio ii.
Capital gearing iii.
Times interest covered Activity Ratios i.
Total assets turnover ii.
Stock turnover iii.
Sales to debtors iv.
Average collection period Investment Ratios i.
Earnings yield ii.
Dividend yield iii.
Price – earning multiple We shall explain all the ratios with examples: 1.
Gross Profit and Net Profit margin: The gross profit margin is the ratio of gross profit to sales while the net profit margin is the ratio of net profit to sales.
The former seeks to highlight the aggregate impact of the firm’s mark-up or pricing policy, and the latter aims to evaluate the overall efficiency of the firm in its buying and selling operations.
They are calculated as follows: 128  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING a.
Gross profit margin = Gross profit Sales b.
Net profit margin = Net profit Sales 2.
Return on Assets Managed (ROAM): ROAM = Net profit before interest Total sales Here, profit is seen as a function of the size of total assets at the disposal of management for operating the business.
A large amount of assets is expected to generate more profits than a smaller volume of assets.
3.
Return on Capital Employed: ROCE = Net profit + Interest on long-term loan Total long-term funds Capital employed means all the long-term funds invested in the business – equity (share capital, reserves, profit balance), preference capital and debentures or loan stock.
4.
Return on Equity: = Net profit after tax ROE Total equity funds The equity funds in a business represent the book value of the total investment by the shareholders.
The net profit after tax, on the other hand, represents to the shareholders, the total surplus generated by their investment.
For equity holders, the efficiency with which their funds are employed is reflected by the ratio of net profit after tax to the total equity funds.
5.
Current Ratio: = Current assets CR Current liabilities Current ratio is a relationship between total assets and total liabilities.
It is also a relationship between funds due and funds owed.
It indicates the ability of the firm to meet its short-term obligations as at when due.
A low ratio indicates the inability of a firm to pay its bills as at when due.
A high ratio, on the other hand, may indicate an excessive amount of current assets and the inability of management to effectively utilize the firm’s resources.
Depending on the business of the firm, a ratio of 2:1 is recommended.
129  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 6.
Quick (or Acid test) Ratio: = Total current assets – Inventory QR Total current liabilities This is a more stringent measure of a firm’s liquidity position because the least liquid current assets (inventory) is excluded in the computation.
A lower quick ratio is an indication of the inability of the firm to meet its short-term obligations while a higher ratio represents ineffectiveness in the management of the firm’s resources.
A ratio of 1:1 is normal.
7.
Debt Ratio: = Total debts Debt Ratio Total assets This ratio measures the proportion of the firm’s total assets that are paid for by debt.
Long-term lenders use this ratio to assess the extent to which their funds are exposed to risk.
A debt ratio of 50% would imply that creditors have financed half of the assets, and this can be the limit to which lenders would be prepared to lend money to the firm without charging a risk premium.
8.
Capital Gearing Ratio: = Long term loan: Total Equity funds CGR This ratio helps to measure the degree of financing risk.
Generally, equity holders gear their investment in the business, that is, employ long-term loans to support their own funds.
A gearing of 1:1 means that long-term lenders have provided one naira for every one naira equity funds.
9.
Times Interest Covered: = Net profit + Interest TIC Interest This means the number of times that the total interest burden is covered by the total net profit before interest and taxes.
This ratio measures the likelihood of default in interest payment.
A high ratio is an evidence of financial strength and is preferred.
10.
Total Assets Turnover: = Sales TAT Total assets This is a ratio of sales to total assets.
The number of times that total sales are turned over is a measure of the effectiveness in the use of the firm’s assets.
A high turnover is a measure of success.
11.
Stock Turnover: = Cost of Sales ST Average stock 130  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING This is the ratio of cost of sales to average stock.
12.
Sales to Debtors: = Sales Sales to Debtors Debtors This ratio measures the extent to which the credit sales policy may have contributed to the total sales of the firm.
A high sale-to-debtors ratio suggests an effective credit control policy.
13.
Average Collection Period: = Debtors ACP days Average sales per day Here, average sales per day are the year’s turnover divided by 360 days.
This ratio measures the effectiveness of the firm’s credit control function.
A preferred ratio should represent a smaller number of days’ sales.
14.
Earnings Yield: = Earnings per share x 100 EY Market price of share 1 Where EPS = Net profit after tax Number of shares outstanding This ratio is a measure of the company’s efficiency in the use of shareholders’ capital.
15 Dividend Yield: = Dividend per share DY Market price of share Where DPS = Dividend for the year No.
of shares outstanding Dividend is significant to shareholders because it is the portion of total earnings which they actually receive, the remainder being retained within the business.
It is believed that DYR provides a realistic alternative to Earnings Yield as basis for comparing the potential return from alternative investments.
16.
Price – Earnings Multiple: = Market price per share P – E M Earnings per share This ratio is the mechanism through which a certain measure of standardisation or equilibrium is introduced among the prices of shares of similar risk-return characteristics.
131  ENT 222 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Example Below are the financial statements of UJAH Trading Company Limited.
You are required to compute the financial ratios, tabulate and compare them.
