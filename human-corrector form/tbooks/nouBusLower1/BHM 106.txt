This is one of the great advantages of distance learning; you can read and work through specially designed study materials at your own pace and at a time and place that suit you best.
Think of it as reading the lecture instead of listening to a lecturer.
In the same way that a lecturer might set you some reading to do, the study units tell you when to read your books or other material, and when to undertake computing practical work.
Just as a lecturer might give you an in-class exercise, your study units provides exercises for you to do at appropriate points.
Each of the study units follows a common format.
The first item is an introduction to the subject matter of the unit and how a particular unit is integrated with the other units and the course as a whole.
Next is a set of learning objectives.
These objectives let you know what you should be able to do by the time you have completed the unit.
You should use these objectives to guide your study.
When you have finished the unit you must go back and check whether you have achieved the objectives.
If you make a habit of doing this you will significantly improve your chances of passing the course.
The main body of the unit guides you through the required reading from other sources.
This will usually be either from your set books or from a Readings section.
Some units require you to undertake practical work or a computer.
You will be directed when you need to use a computer and guided through the tasks you must do.
The purpose of the computing work is twofold.
First, it will enhance your understanding of the material in the unit.
Second, it will give you practical experience of using programs, which you could well encounter in your work outside your studies.
In any event, most of the techniques you will study are applicable on computers in normal working practice, so it is important that you encounter them during your studies.
Self-tests are interspersed throughout the units, and answers are given at the ends of the units.
Working through these tests will help you to achieve the objectives of the unit and prepare you for the assignments and the examination.
You should do each self-test as you come to it in the study unit.
There will also be numerous examples given in the study units; work through these when you come to them, too.
The following is a practical strategy for working through the course.
If you run into any trouble, contact your tutor.
Remember that your tutor's job is to help you.
When you need help, don't hesitate to call and ask your tutor to provide it.

1.0 Introduction You will realize that the activities of man and those of the various organizations, that will often be referred to as firms, continue to increase.
This brings an increase in the need for man and the firms to make decisions on all these activities.
The need for the quality and the quantity of the information required to make the decisions increases also.
The management of any firm requires scientific methods to collect and analyze the mass of information it collects to make decisions on a number of issues.
Such issues include the sales over a period of time, the production cost and the expected net profit.
In this regard, statistics plays an important role as a management tool for making decisions.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Understand the various definitions of statistics • Describe the uses of statistics • Define the basic concepts in statistics.
3.1 Definitions of Statistics Statistics can be defined as a management tool for making decision.
It is also a scientific approach to presentation of numerical information in such a way that one will have a maximum understanding of the reality represented by such NOUN 16  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I information.
Statistics is also defined as the presentation of facts in numerical forms.
A more comprehensive definition of statistics shows statistics as a scientific method which is used for collecting, summarizing, classifying, analyzing and presenting information in such a way that we can have thorough understanding of the reality the information represents.
From all these definitions, you will realize that statistics are concerned with numerical data..
Examples of such numerical data are the heights and weights of pupils in a primary school when evaluating the nutritional well being of the pupils and the accident fatalities on a particular road for a period of time.
You should also know that when there are numerical data, there must be non- numerical data such as the taste of brands of biscuits, the greenness of some vegetables and the texture of some joints of a wholesale cut of meat.
Non- numerical data cannot be subjected to statistical analysis except they are transformed to numerical data.
To transform greenness of vegetables to numerical data, a five point scale for measuring the colour can be developed with 1 indicating very dull and 5 indicating very green.
3.2 The Roles of Statistics You will realize that statistics is useful in all spheres of human life.
A woman with a given amount of money, going to the market to purchase foodstuff for the family, takes decision on the types of food items to purchase, the quantity and the quality of the items to maximize the satisfaction she will derive from the purchase.
For all these decisions, the woman makes use of statistics Government uses statistics as a tool for collecting data on economic aggregates such as national income, savings, consumption and gross national product.
Government also uses statistics to measure the effects of external factors on its policies and to assess the trends in the economy so that it can plan future policies.
Government uses statistics during census.
The various forms sent by the government to individuals and firms on annual income, tax returns, prices, costs, output and wage rates generate a lot of statistical data for the use of the government Business uses statistics to monitor the various changes in the national economy for the various budget decisions.
Business makes use of statistics in production, marketing, administration and in personnel management.
Statistics is also used extensively to control and analyze stock level such as minimum, maximum and reorder levels.
It is used by business in market NOUN 17  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I research to determine the acceptability of a product that will be demanded at various prices by a given population in a geographical area.
Management also uses statistics to make forecast about the sales and labour cost of a firm.
Management uses statistics to establish mathematical relationship between two or more variables for the purpose of predicting a variable in terms of others.
For the conduct and analyses of biological, physical, medical and social researches, we use statistics extensively.
3.3 Basic Concepts In Statistics Let us quickly define some of the basic concepts you will continue to come across in this course.
• Entity: This may be person, place, and thing on which we make observations.
In studying the nutritional well being of pupils in a primary school, the entity is a pupil in the school.
• Variable: This is a characteristic that assumes different values for different entities.
The weights of pupils in the primary school constitute a variable.
• Random Variable: If we can specify, for a given variable, a mathematical expression called a function, which gives the relative frequency of occurrence of the values that the variable can assume, the function is called a probability function and the variable a random variable.
• Quantitative Variable: This is a variable whose values are given as numerical quantities.
Examples of this is the hourly patronage of a restaurant • Qualitative Variable: This is a variable that is not measurable in numerical form or that cannot be counted.
Examples of this are colours of fiuits, taste of some brands of a biscuit.
• Discrete Variable: This is the variable that can only assume whole numbers.
Examples of these are the number of Local Government Council Areas of the States in Nigeria, number of female students in the various programmes in the National Open University.
A discrete variable has "interruptions" between the values it can assume.
For instance between 1 and 2, there are infinite number of NOUN 18  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I values such as 1.1, 1.11, 1.111, 1.
I I l land so on.
These are called interruptions.
• Continuous Variable: This is a variable that can assume both decimal and nondecimal values.
There is always a continuum of values that the continuous variable can assume.
The interruptions that characterize the discrete variable are absent in the continuous variable.
The weight can be both whole values or decimal values such as 20 kilograms and 220.1752 kilograms.
• Population: This is the largest number of entities in a study.
In the study of how workers in Nigeria spend their leisure hours, the number of workers in Nigeria constitutes the population of the study.
• Sample: This is the part of the population that is selected for a study.
In studying the income distribution of students in the National Open University, the incomes of 1000 students selected for the study, from the population of all the students in the Open University will constitute the sample of the study.
• Random Sample: This is a sample drawn from a population in such a way that the results of its analysis may be used to generalize about the population from which it was drawn.
Exercise 1.1 What is the importance of Statistics to human activities?
Your answer can be obtained in section 3.2 of this unit.
4.0 Conclusion In this unit you have learned a number of important issues that relate to the meaning and roles of statistics.
The various definitions and examples of concepts given in this unit will assist tremendously in the studying of the units to follow.
5.0 Summary What you have learned in this unit concerns the meaning and roles of statistics, and the various concepts that are important to the study of statistics.

The first unit has shown that statistics involves the scientific method of collecting, summarizing, classifying, analyzing and presenting information, usually numerical information, in a way that we can have a thorough understanding of the reality the information represents.
You will realize that it is important to know the nature, the sources and methods of collecting the data.
This unit takes you through these aspects of data.
There are self-assessment exercises designed to make you pause and reflect on what you are reading.
At the end of the unit, there are again self-assessment questions which are designed to know the extent of your learning of the contents in the unit.
2.0 Objectives After studying unit and going through the exercises, you should be able to (cid:1) Know the nature of primary and secondary data (cid:1) Identify various sources of micro-and macro-statistical information (cid:1) Describe the various methods of data collection 3.1 Nature of Statistical Data 3.1.1 Primary Data You are already aware that statistics uses numerical data.
The Numerical data can be divided into: a) Primary and b) Secondary Data Primary Data are data collected by or on behalf of the person or people who are going to make use of the data.
It is the data collected specifically for a purpose and used for the purpose for which they are collected.
NOUN 22  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Examples of Primary data are: (i) Heights and weights of students collected to determine their nutritional well being.
(ii) The population of Primary school pupils in the states of the country to allow the Federal Government plan for the primary education.
(ii) The academic performance of students in secondary schools under various types of leaders to know the leadership style suitable for the secondary schools The various methods of collecting primary data include surveys, interview, observation, questionnaire and experiments.
These will be further discussed in this unit.
Primary data could be very expensive to collect when the elements of the study sample are widely scattered and when the items of equipment for data collection, as in many experiments, are capital intensive.
However errors can be minimized when collecting primary data since the researcher can always take adequate precaution in collecting primary data.
3.1.2 Secondary Data This is the data that is used by a person or people other than the person or people by whom or for whom the data was collected.
These are the data collected for some other purpose, frequently for administrative reasons, and used for the purpose for which they were not collected.
Secondary data are always collected from published sources, like textbooks, journals, Newspapers, magazines, and gazette.
Examples of secondary data include: (i) Accident fatalities on a particular road over a period of time collected from the Police or Road safety corps.
(ii) Dietary requirements of various age groups collected from a nutrition textbook.
(iii) Age distribution in Nigeria collected from the publications of the National Population Census.
From the discussion so far, you will know that secondary data are second-hand data.
This shows the need to know as much as possible about the data.
In trying NOUN 23  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I to know much about the secondary data, we need to consider the following points: (i) How the data was collected (ii) How the data has been processed (iii) The accuracy of the data (iv) How far the data has been summarized (v) How comparable the data is with other tabulations.
(vi) How to interpret the data, especially when figures collected for one purpose are used for another.
With secondary data, we usually strike a compromise between what we want and what we are able to find.
Secondary data have the following advantages: (i) They are very inexpensive to collect since they are readily and abundantly available in published sources.
(ii) There is a great variety of secondary data on a wide range of subjects.
(iii) Many of these data have been collected for many years hence we can use them to establish trends for forecasting.
With all these advantages of secondary data, we must use secondary data with great care since such data may not give the exact kind of information required and the data may not be in the most suitable form they are required.
Student Assessment Exercise 2.1 For each of the Primary and Secondary data list: (i) The characteristics (ii) The advantages (iii) The disadvantages 3.2 SOURCES OF DATA 3.2.1 Micro-Statistical Information The firms and private organizations, when monitoring the activities of their businesses, produce a lot of information that are specific to the organization and firm and used for their decision-making processes.
The information produced by these form and organization are called micro-statistical Information.
NOUN 24  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I In micro-economics, the concern is for the household and firm.
The information produced or generated at these levels are micro-statistical information.
For firm, such information include those generated from production, marketing and personnel.
3.2.2 Macro-Statistical Information These are produced by the Public sector of the economy.
They are related to the whole country as a whole.
Such information include population, education, rate of inflation, level of unemployment and so on.
Macro-economics is concerned with such aggregates as national income, gross national products, saving, consumption, gross domestic product and so on.
These are macro-statistics information.
3.2.3 Statistical Information in Business In The performance and monitoring of various activities in the firms, a lot of data is produced.
The quality and the quantity of the information generated in the firm depend on the size of the firm and the resources available to the firm The firm is interested in what is happening to the national economy and what is happening in the industry it belongs to.
You should know that a combination of firms makes the industry.
As regards national income, the firm wishes to know the interest rates and unemployment.
As regards the industry, the firm will always wish to know wage rates, prices, level of output so that it can compare its performance with the competitors in the industry.
The firm also generates data in the following areas.
(i) Production: The firm collects data on the results of quality control, prices of raw materials, defectiveness of consignment of raw materials, wage rates, stock of materials, accident rates, absenteeism rates, unit cost.
(ii) Marketing: The firm will to want know the budgeted sales, the advertising cost to sustain the sales, the distribution costs etc.
Other information could be generated from personnel and Accounts departments to aid decision-making process of the firm.
3.2.4 Government Statistics NOUN 25  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I As you were informed in unit 1 section 3.2, the governments produce statistics to be able to measure the effects of their policies, to monitor the effects of external factors on their policies and to be able to assess trends so that they can plan future policies.
The macrostatistical information is generated by the governments as you have learned in this unit.
The various governments rely in the firms and the individuals to generate these macro statistical data Student Assessment Exercises 2.2 a) Look at a firm around you and list ten pieces of information the firm generates from the activities of the firm.
c) Look at your Local Government Council Area list ten pieces of Information the council generates for the governance of the council.
3.3 Methods Of Data Collection 3.3.1 Surveys In this unit, you have learned that secondary data are already available; hence they must be collected when there is the need to use them.
The collection of primary data involves survey or inquiry of one type or the other.
Some surveys can be limited in the sense that they can be carried out with a few minutes of observation.
Others can be detailed.
When surveys are detailed, information from the surveys are more acceptable and valued than when they are limited.
Examples of surveys are: (i) Government Survey (ii) Market research surveys - carried out for one particular client and not published in any form.
(iii) Research surveys - carried out by academicians and published in journals (iv) Firms commission ad hoc surveys on a wide variety of subjects.
Survey methods consist of the following stages: (i) The survey design - This depends on the objectives of the survey, the available methods, the amount of money, and time that can be allocated for collecting the information (ii) The Pilot survey: This is the preliminary survey carried out on a very small scale to make sure that the design and methodology of the survey are likely to produce the information required NOUN 26  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (iii) Collection of Information - This involves the use of observation, interview and questionnaire.
(iv) Coding - We may need to pre-code the questions to facilitate classification and tabulation.
(v) Tabulation - There is the need to tabulate the data, to give a summary of the data.
(vi) Secondary statistics - We will need to calculate secondary statistics such as means and percentages.
(vii) Reports - Reports must be written on the results and the results must be illustrated with graphs and diagrams.
3.3.2 Observations This is one of the methods of collecting primary data.
It can be used to know the use a particular facility is put.
It can be used to study the behaviours of people in a work place.
There can be the following types of observation: • Participant observation • Systematic observation • Mechanical observation In participant observation, the observer is involved in the activities he is trying to observe.
Examples of these are the vice-chancellor who participates in the eating at the cafeteria to observe the performance of the cooks and the acceptability of the food by the students; the lecturer who sits for his own paper with the students to observe the difficulty encountered by the students in the paper.
This method can have serious influence in the entities the observer is observing.
The method may also consume a lot of time.
In systematic observation, the observer does not take part in the activity.
The method is used when events can be investigated without the participants knowing that somebody is observing them.
Though the method is objective, it does not question the motives of people observed.
In mechanical observation, mechanical devices do the observation.
For instance, the number of vehicles passing a particular point on the road can be recorded mechanically.
Sophisticated mechanical means such as television, film and tape recorders are used to provide more complex information.
Mechanical observations can be more effective than those observation made by individuals observer who can be subject to bias.
Generally, observation has the following problems: NOUN 27  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I • Objectivity- to remain objective, the observer cannot ask the question that will help him to understand the events he is observing.
• Selectivity- an observer can unintentionally become selective in perception, recording and reporting.
• Interpretation- the observer may impute meanings to the behaviour of people that the people do not intend.
• Chance- a chance event may be mistaken for a recurrent one.
• Participation- the participation of the observer can influence the behaviour of people being observed.
3.3.3 Interviewing This is a conversation with a purpose.
There can be formal and informal interviews.
Informally everybody uses interviews to obtain information.
The formal interview is also initiated by the interviewer who approaches the person he is interested in interviewing.
The interviewer therefore arranges the venue, and the time, and prepares the questions to be asked.
The interviewer also secures the means of recording the responses.
Interviews are used in a number of situations that include: (i) Obtaining opinion polls for the success of a candidate in an election.
(ii) Studying why people behave in a way (iii) Selecting applicants for some jobs (iii) Reporting especially in the radio and television Before the interview is conducted, the interviewer must have knowledge of his respondents.
The interviewer must also secure an initial rapport with his respondents.
The interviewer must explain clearly and briefly the purpose of the interview to his respondents.
The interviewer should be very objective.
He must not express his own opinions and must not influence the answers of the respondents.
The language of the question must be at the level of the respondents.
If the questions are written in a language different from that of the respondents, the question must be translated to that of the respondent but the answers must be written by the interviewer in the language of the questions.
This was the case during the last census in Nigeria.
The questionnaire used was written in English language.
That is not the language many Nigerians understand.
For the purpose of getting the response of people in this group; the questions were translated to the language they understand.
NOUN 28  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Interviewing method has a number of advantages: (i) It allows the interviewer to have personal contact with the respondents therefore allowing more questions to be asked which improves the quality of the information.
(ii) It allows the interviewer to persuade unwilling respondents.
(iv) It allows experienced interviewer to know when to make calls and recalls Interviewing method also has a number of disadvantages.
(i) Biased interviewer may influence the responses of the respondents to suit his own opinions.
(ii) A biased respondent, in a matter-affecting ego, may give false responses.
(iii) It is very expensive and time consuming especially when respondents are widely scattered.
(v) It may be difficult to interview some top people in government and business 3.3.4 Questionnaire This is a list of questions drawn in such a way that the questions are related to the objectives of the study being conducted, and the responses to the question will be analyzed to provide solutions to the problems we attempt to solve in the study.
There are two types of questionnaire namely: (i) Structured or fixed-response questionnaire: (ii) Unstructured or open ended questionnaire The structured questionnaire consists of a list of questions drawn on the study being conducted.
Each question is accompanied by alternative answers from which the respondent picks appropriate answer or answers.
An example of a structured question is this: What is your monthly salary (cid:1) Below N7500 (cid:1) N7500 - N10,000 0 NOUN 29  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (cid:1) N10, 000 - N12, 500 0 (cid:1) Above N12,500 Structured questionnaire has a number of advantages: (i) It is very easy to complete and analyze.
(u) Most of the questions are answered (iii) The responses are always related to the objectives of the study.
A major disadvantage of the structured questionnaire is the fact that it does not allow the views of the respondents, which may enhance the quality of the information collected.
Unstructured questionnaire is a list of questions drawn on the study on which information is required.
The questions are not accompanied by alternative answers as in the structured questionnaire.
The respondents are free to provide their own responses.
Example of a question in an unstructured questionnaire is "What is your monthly salary?"
Unstructured questionnaire are not difficult to construct since no question is accompanied by alternative answers.
It has the following advantages.
(i) It allows for the views of the respondents (ii) The questionnaire are not difficult to construct since no question is accompanied by alternative answers.
However, the unstructured questionnaire has the following disadvantages.
(i) It is not easy to complete and analyze.
(ii) Many of the responses supplied by the respondents may not be related to the objectives of the study.
(iii) The respondents may not answer all questions, especially those considered difficult by them.
This will definitely reduce the quality of the information obtained.
In drawing a standard questionnaire, the following must be considered.
(1) List all the questions you want to ask.
(ii) Decide whether to use direct or indirect questions or both.
(iii) A question must be limited to an idea.
(v) Ask simple and interesting questions before the difficult and uninteresting ones.
(v) State the questions clearly.
NOUN 30  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (vi) A question must mean the same thing to all the respondents.
(vii) The language must be at the level of the respondents.
(viii) Do not ask questions that will hurt your respondent (ix) The questionnaire should be pre-tested on a mock-audience before it is administered on the real sample to detect the difficulty in completing and analyzing the questionnaire so as to review the questionnaire before it finally gets to the real audience it is meant for.
Student Assessment Exercise 2.3 You may wish to put off your course material, pause for a while and list the various methods of data collection, their descriptions, their advantages and disadvantages 4.0 Conclusion In this unit, you have learned primary data and secondary data; their nature, examples, sources, advantages and disadvantages.
You should also be aware of the various methods of collecting data, their advantages and disadvantages.
In the unit to follow, you will learn how to summarize data to facilitate the necessary analysis that will bring out the reality contained in the information.
5.0 Summary What you have learnt in this unit consists of the nature of statistical data, the sources of the data and the methods of collecting the data.
The unit to follow will build upon this.

33-42 NOUN 31  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I UNIT 3 SUMMARISING DATA Table of Contents NOUN 32  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Ordered Array 3.2 Frequency Distribution 3.2.1 Ungrouped Data 3.2.2 Grouped Data 3.3 Relative Frequency Distribution 3.3.1 Ungrouped Data 3.3.2 Grouped Data 3.4 Cummulative Relative Frequency Distribution 3.4.1 Ungrouped Data 3.4.2 Grouped Data 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References, Further Reading and Other Resources 1.0 Introduction You learned the methods of collecting data in the previous unit.
In the first unit, you have learned that statistics is a scientific method of collecting, summarizing, classifying, analyzing and presenting information in such a way that we can have a thorough understanding of the reality the information represents.
From this definition of statistics, summarizing the data is very important to the analysis of the data.
You will learn in this unit how to arrange the mass of unordered array of mass of data in such a way that detailed analysis on the data can be performed.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Arrange an unordered array of data in ordered form.
• Prepare frequency distributions for both grouped and ungrouped data.
• Construct relative frequency, cummulative relative frequency for both ungrouped and grouped data 3.1 Ordered Array NOUN 33  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I When data are collected, they are collected in such a way that there is no particular arrangement of the values.
This unordered array of values does not facilitate the process of analyzing the data.
The data must therefore be arranged either in ascending or descending order of magnitude so as to facilitate the analysis.
Example 3.1: Suppose the ages of twenty pupils in a primary school are as follows (age to the nearest years) 6, 8, 10, 11, 7, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12.
11, 9, 8, 12, 5, 6, 10, 8, 7, 9.
A look through the values shows no order of arrangement.
An ordered form of the values shows the following: 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8.
9,9,9,10,10,11,11,11,12,12.
The data arranged in this form has a number of advantages over the raw data.
(i) We can quickly know the lowest and highest values in the data.
(ii) We can easily divide the data into sections.
(iii) We can see whether any value appears more than once in the array.
(iv) We can observe the distance between succeeding values in the data.
Student Assessments Exercise 3.1 Go through the values listed below and arrange them in ascending order of magnitude The daily births in a maternity home in a month are given below 5, 3, 6, 7, 4, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3 3, 5, 2, 6, 2, 5, 0, 7, 2, 5 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1, 1, 3 3.2 Frequency Distribution 3.2.1 Frequency Distribution for Ungrouped Data An ordered array of data does not sufficiently summarize the data.
The data can be further summarized by preparing the frequency distribution for the data.
A frequency distribution is a table showing the values of the data and the number of occurrence of each of the values.
NOUN 34  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Example 3.2 For the data in exercise 3.1 above, present the frequency distribution for the values.
The values will be represented by Xi and the frequency is represented by Fi Frequency Distribution Xi Fi 0 2 1 3 2 5 3 5 4 3 5 6 6 3 7 3 This table shows the values of the variable and their respective frequencies.
3.2.2 Frequency Distribution of Grouped Data It is possible to have the frequency in example 3.2 without grouping the data because the values are not many.
There are only seven values.
In situation where the values are in thousands or millions, it may be difficult to analyze the values if they are not grouped.
For many of sophisticated analyses, we need to group the data before analysis commences.
We therefore group the data into class intervals Class intervals: are defined as contiguous, non-overlapping intervals selected in such a way that they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
They are mutually exclusive in the sense that a value is Placed in one and only one class interval.
The class intervals could be 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24.....................
It could also be 11-20, 21-30, 31-40,.............................
It may even take either form.
In this unit there will be more examples of class intervals.
The class should not be too few and should not be too many.
Too few NOUN 35  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I class intervals can result in a loss of much detail while too many class intervals may not condense the Example 3.2 The table below shows the scores of 50 students in mathematics in a Senior Secondary Examination 19 50 57 25 61 42 26 33 46 45 63 31 80 36 78 56 38 69 83 40 52 17 35 65 13 63 72 29 56 57 22 45 53 44 76 47 86 55 66 48 41 64 38 43 23 58 55 32 52 46 For this we need to prepare the tallies from the tallies we obtain the frequency of each of the class intervals.
Class Intervals Tallies Frequency 11-20 III 3 21-30 IIII 5 31-40 IIII III 8 41-50 IIII IIII I 11 51-60 IIII IIII 10 61-70 IIII II 7 71-80 IIII 4 81-90 II 2 What you have above is the frequency distribution of a grouped data.
To further summarize grouped data, some basic concepts are important.
These concepts will be defined and computed now.
(i) Class Limit: For any class interval, there are two class limits, the lower and upper class limits.
For the example 3.2, the lower class limits NOUN 36  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I are 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81.
The upper class limits are 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90.
(ii) Class Boundaries: For any class interval, there are two class boundaries.
The lower class boundary of a class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the interval and the upper limit of the preceeding interval.
Let us compute the lower class boundary of the interval 11-20.
The lower class limit of the class interval is 11 and the upper class limit of the preceeding class interval is suppose to be 10.
The lower class boundary of the class interval is therefore: 10+11 = 10.5 2 For the example 3.2, the lower class boundaries of the class intervals are 10.5, 20.5, 30.5, 40.5, 50.5, 60.5, 70.5, and 80.5.
The upper class boundary of a class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the succeeding class interval.
For example 3.2, the upper class boundary of interval 11-20 is 20.5.
The upper class limit of the class interval is 20 while the lower class limit of the succeeding class interval is 21.
The upper class boundary of the interval is therefore equal to: 20+21 = 20.5 2 For the example, the upper class boundaries of the class intervals are respectively 20.5, 30.5, 40.5, 50.5, 60.5, 70.5, 80.5, and 90.5.
From these values, you will see that the upper class boundary of a class interval is the lower class boundary of the succeeding class interval.
The classes can also be given in terms of class boundaries rather than class limits.
When this is done, there is overlapping of the class intervals.
For example 3.2, if the class boundaries are used, we will have the following as our frequency distribution.
NOUN 37  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (iii) Class Width: This is the difference between the upper and lower Class Intervals Frequency 10.5-20.5 3 20.5-30.5 5 30.5-40.5 8 40.5-50.5 11 50.5-60.5 10 60.5-70.5 7 70.5-80.5 4 80.5-90.5 2 class boundaries (not class limits).
For our example 3.2, the class width for all the class intervals is 10.
For the first interval, the class width is 20.5-10.5 = 10.
It is not 20-11.
(iv) Class Mark: This is the mean of the upper and the lower class boundaries.
It can also be the mean of the lower and the upper class limits.
For example 3.2, the class mark for the first interval is: 10.5+20.5 = 15.5.
It can also be 11+20 = 15.5 2 2 For the classes in the example 3.2, we have the following as class width for the respective class intervals 15.5, 25.5, 35.5 , 45.5, 55.5, 65.5, 75.5, and 85.5.
There is need to summarize what we have done so far into class limits, class boundaries, class marks and class width.
Class Limits Class Boundaries Class Marks Class Width 11-20 10.5-20.5 15.5 10 21-30 20.5-30.5 25.5 10 31-40 30.5-40.5 35.5 10 41-50 40.5-50.5 45.5 10 51-60 50.5-60.5 55.5 10 61-70 60.5-70.5 65.5 10 71-80 70.5-80.5 75.5 10 NOUN 38  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 81-90 80.5-90.5 85.5 10 3.3 Relative Frequency 3.31 Ungrouped Data The relative frequency of a value is defined by the total frequencies of all the values contained in the set of values.
Example 3.3.
Suppose the frequency distribution of the scores of the twenty students in a test is as presented below Scores Frequency 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 4 6 5 7 3 8 2 9 1 20 TOTAL The total frequency is 20.
The relative frequency of the first score is given as 1/20 = 0.05 NOUN 39  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The relative frequency distribution of the scores is therefore given as: Scores Frequency Relative Frequency 2 1 0.05 3 2 0.10 4 2 0.10 5 4 0.20 6 5 0.25 7 3 0.15 8 2 0.10 9 1 0.05 3.3.2 Grouped Data For the grouped data, the relative frequency of a class interval is the frequency of the interval divided by the total frequencies of all class intervals.
For example 3.2, the relative frequency distribution of the class intervals is as presented Relative Frequency Distribution of Grouped Data Class Intervals Frequency Relative Frequency 11-20 3 0.06 21-30 5 0.10 31-40 8 0.16 41-50 11 0.22 51-60 10 0.20 61-70 7 0.14 71-80 4 0.08 81-90 2 0.04 NOUN 40  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Going through the relative frequencies table presented in the unit, you will realize that the sum of the relative frequencies for a set of values is 1 3.4 Cumulative Relative Frequency Distribution 3.4.1 Ungrouped Data In this unit, you have learned construction of relative frequency for ungrouped data.
A further summary of data can be in form of cumulative relative frequency.
To construct the cumulative relative frequency, we need to construct the cumulative frequency for the data.
The cumulative relative frequency of a value is the cumulative frequency of the values divided by the total frequency of the values contained in the array of data.
For the example 3.3, the cumulative frequency and the cumulative relative frequency for the set of data is as presented below Cumulative Relative Score Frequency Cumulative Frequency Frequency 2 1 1 1/20 = 0.05 3 2 3 = 1+2 3/20 = 0.15 4 2 5 = 3+2 5/20 = 0.25 5 4 9= =5+4 9/20 = 0.45 6 5 14=9+5 14/20=0.70 7 3 17 = 14+3 17/20 =.85 8 2 19 = 17+2 19/20 =.095 9 1 20 = 19+1 20/20 = 1.00 3.4.2 GROUPED DATA The cumulative frequency of grouped data is constructed the same way as that of ungrouped data.
Example 3.4 The table below shows the frequency distribution of the ages of employees in a firm.
Prepare the cumulative frequency and the cumulative relative frequency for the ages of the employees.
NOUN 41  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Age (In Years) Frequency 18-20 2 21-23 5 24-26 13 27-29 25 30-32 22 33-35 8 36-38 6 39-41 3 42-44 5 45-47 3 48-50 3 51-53 2 54-56 2 57-59 1 The cumulative frequency and the cumulative relative frequency distributions are as follows.
Ages Cumulative Cumulative Relative Frequency (Years) Frequency Frequency 18-20 2 2 =2 2/100 = 0.02 21-23 5 2+5= 7 7/100 = 0.07 7+13 24-26 13 20/100 = 0.20 = 20 27-29 25 20+25= 45 45/100 = 0.45 30-32 22 45+22= 67 67/100 = 0.67 33-35 8 67+8= 75 75/100 = 0.75 NOUN 42  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 36-38 6 75+6 = 81 81/100 = 0.81 39-41 3 81+3 =84 84/100 = 0.84 42-44 5 84+5 = 89 89/100 = 0.89 45-47 3 89+3= 92 92/100 = 0.92 48-50 3 92+3= 95 95/100 = 0.95 51-53 2 95+2= 97 97/100 = 0.97 54-56 2 97+2= 99 99/100 = 0.99 57-59 1 99+1= 100 100/100 = 1.00 4.0 Conclusion In this unit you have learned how to arrange data in ordered form.
You have also learned how to summarize data, both grouped and ungrouped data, into frequency distribution, relative and cumulative frequency distributions.
You have also learned some basic concepts that will aid the analysis of grouped data latter in subsequent units.
What you have learned in this unit will facilitate further presentation and analysis of the data in the subsequent units.

1.0 Introduction You learned in Unit 3 the summarizing of data using frequency distribution, relative and cumulative relative frequency distributions.
In this unit, you will learn how to represent these data graphically.
Graphical representation has a way of showing the salient features of data without having to interpret the column of numbers.
Some other data that are not summarized into frequency distributions will be represented with charts in this unit.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Plot histogram, frequency polygon and Ogive for a set of values.
• Construct simple, component and multiple bar charts for a set of data.
• Draw pie chart 3.1 Histogram: NOUN 45  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.1 One of the ways of representing a frequency distribution is by means of a histogram.
In constructing a histogram we plot the frequencies of the class intervals against the class boundaries [not the class limit].
The vertical axis is used for the frequencies and the horizontal axis for the class boundaries.
Example 4.1 Suppose the table below shows the distribution of 50 spectators in a secondary school sports competition.
You are required to represent the data with a histogram Table 4.1: Age Distribution of spectators in school sports.
Age (Years) Frequency 10-14 2 15-19 3 20-24 5 25-29 7 30-34 11 35-39 8 40-44 6 45-49 5 50-54 3 In solving the exercise, you require a graph sheet; you also need to prepare the class boundaries for the class intervals.
You will then plot the frequency against the respective class boundaries.
You still need to recall how the class boundaries are computed in unit 3 we will not discuss it here.
NOUN 46  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Age (Years) Class Boundaries Frequency Class Interval 10-14 9.5-14.5 2 15-19 14.5-19.5 3 20-24 19.5-24.5 5 25-29 24.5-29.5 7 30-34 29.5-34.5 11 35-39 34.5-39.5 8 40-44 39.5-44.5 6 45-49 44.5-49.5 5 50-54 49.5-54.5 3 FIGURE 4.1 Histogram Showing The Data In Example 4.1 e e y ruc Fqn 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 20 30 Mode 40 50 60 Class Boundaries NOUN 47  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The histogram can be used to estimate the mode of the distribution.
To do this you have to locate the highest cell in the histogram, join the upper class boundary of the cell with the upper boundary of the preceding cell, join the lower class boundary of the highest cell with the lower class boundary of the succeeding cell, locate the intersection, draw a vertical line from the intersection to the horizontal.
The value of the vertical line on the horizontal axis is the mode.
You need to see the construction on the histogram in fig.
4.1.
The mode read from figure 4.1 is 32.5.
3.1.2 Frequency Polygon.
Another way of representing frequency distribution graphically is by the means of a frequency polygon.
In constructing a frequency polygon, we plot the frequency against the class marks.
You learned in unit 3 that class mark of a class interval is the mean of the lower and the upper class boundaries or limits of the class interval.
Example 4.2 Construct a frequency polygon for the data in example 4.1 To construct the frequency polygon, you need to compute the class mark for the class intervals, you need to make the polygon touch the horizontal at both ends.
To do this, you have to compute the class mark for an imaginary class interval at the beginning and another imaginary class interval at the end of the distribution.
If you look at table 4.1 that is of interest here, there is no class interval 5-9 at the beginning and there is no class interval 55-59 at the end of the distribution.
We need to bring these intervals in and assign a frequency of 0 to each of them.
Let us now compute the class mark for the class intervals.
NOUN 48  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Class Intervals Class Marks Frequency 5-9 7 0 10-14 12 2 15-19 17 3 20-24 22 5 25-29 27 7 30-34 32 11 35-39 37 8 40-44 42 6 45-49 47 5 50-54 52 3 55-59 57 0 The next activity is to plot the frequency against the class marks.
The frequency is on the vertical axis and the class mark on the horizontal axis.
Frequency polygon must be plotted on a graph sheet FIGURE 4.2: Frequency Polygon for Example 4.2 NOUN 49  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.3 Ogive This is another way of representing frequency distribution graphically.
The other name for ogive is cumulative frequency distribution curve.
This curve is very important in the determination of median, quartriles, percentiles, semi- interquartile range, that will be discussed in some subsequent units.
In plotting ogive for a distribution, you will do the following (a) Compute the upper class boundaries of all the classes including that of an imaginary class at the beginning of the distribution.
b) Prepare a cumulative frequency distribution for the data (c) Plot the cumulative frequency against the upper class boundary.
Example 4.3.
For table 4. l, construct an ogive for that distribution.
Class Frequency Less than Cumulative Frequency Interval 5-9 0 9.5 0 10-14 2 14.5 2 15-19 3 19.5 5 20-24 5 24.5 10 25-29 7 29.5 17 30-34 11 34.5 28 35-39 8 39.5 36 40-44 6 44.5 42 45-49 5 49.5 47 50-54 3 59.5 50 You will realize that the class interval 5-9 was introduced.
A frequency of 0 was also assigned to the class interval since the original table did not show the class.
This is done so that the ogive can take its origin from the horizontal NOUN 50  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I line.
From the table you will see that all the values that are less than 24.5 are contained jn class interval 5-9, 10-14, 15-19 and 20-24.
The sum of the values which is equal to the cumulative frequency of the interval is 0+2+3+5 = 10.
You should know that ogive can only be plotted on a graph sheet.
FIGURE 4.3: Ogive Showing the Frequency Distribution in Table 4.1 Cummulative Frequency NOUN 51  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Exercise 4.1 The frequency distribution of salaries (monthly) of workers in a firm is as follows Salaries Number of Workers 2,000-7,000 5 7,000-12,000 8 12,000-17,000 24 17,000-22,000 5 22,000-27,000 3 27,000-32,000 2 32,000-37,000 1 For the distribution, prepare (i) a histogram and (ii) an ogive Using the histogram, estimate the mode of the distribution 3.2 Bar Chart 3.2.1 Simple Bar Chart Another way of representing data graphically is by means of bar chart.
A bar chart shows vertical bars with equal width to represent the values of a variable in some intervals of time.
The area of the bar is proportional to the magnitude of the quantity it represents.
The bars must be drawn on graph sheet and they must have equal width.
There are simple components and multiple bar charts.
These will be discussed in this unit.
In a simple bar chart, we use the bars to represent the value of a variable in a period of time.
Example 4.4 Suppose the monthly sales of a firm for three consecutive months are given as follows NOUN 52  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Months Sales (In million of Naira) January 5.2 February 7.4 March 10.6 You are required to represent the data on a simple bar chart.
Figure 4.4 Simple Bar Chart for Example 4.4 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Jan. Feb. March Months 3.2.2 Component Bar Charts Another bar chart that shows the total value for a time period and the values of the components that makeup the total is the component bar chart.
In this case, the bar for the total value for a period is divided into the values for the components that make up the total.
NOUN 53  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Example 4.5 Suppose a hotel has three departments A, B, C from where sales are made and the annual records of the net profit of the departments for three consecutive years are as presented below.
Years Net Profits in the Departments (Millions of Naira) A B C 1999 3.2 3.4 2.8 2000 2.8 3.0 2.6 2001 4.0 3.2 3.6 You are to represent the values of the net profits with the aid of a component bar chart.
You will need to plot the values of the components A, B, and C for three years.
The first year will show a bar of length 9.4cm divided into 3.2cm for A, 3.4cm for B, and 2.8cm for C. You will then repeat the exercise for the values of A, B and C in years 2000 and 2001.
There must be a legend to show the shading of the component.
FIGURE 4.5: Component Bar Chart For Example 4.5 C B A 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Years 1999 2000 2001 NOUN 54  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.2.3 Multiple Bar Chart For the multiple bar chart, each component of every year is presented by a bar whose length is corresponding to the value of the component.
Example 4.6 Using the values of net profit in example 4.5, construct a multiple bar chart for the hotel for the period three years.
In this exercise, you will draw single bar for each component of every year.
The bars for a year will now look like histogram.
FIGURE 4.6: Multiple Bar Chart for Example 4.6 C B ) a r i a N A f o n o4 i l il M (3 s it f o r2 P t e N 1 0 1999 2000 2001 Year NOUN 55  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.3 Pie Chart This is another means of representing data graphically.
The values of the Items represented with pie chart are proportional to the area of the sectors that represent them.
In the case of pie-chart, the sectorial angles are computed for the items based on their values and on the total values of the items.
Sectorial angle of an item = Value of Item X 360° Total Value of all items After obtaining the sectorial angles for the items we use a pair of compasses, a pencil, protector and ruler to draw the angles of the sector.
Example 4.7 Suppose the monthly income of a worker is allocated as follows Items N Feeding 9625 Rent 4125 Education 5500 Savings 6875 Others 1375 TOTAL 27,5000 You are required to represent the data on a pie char.
We will therefore compute the sectoral angles NOUN 56  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Items Sectoral Angles Feeding 126" Rent 54" Education 72° Savings 90" Others 18' TOTAL 360 For instance the sectoral angle for feeding is calculated as 9625 x 3600 = 1260 27500 The total values of the items is N27, 500.
This is to say that the monthly income of the worker is N27, 500.
360° is used in the calculation because the sum of angles at a point is 360°.
If the sectoral angles are computed correctly, the sum of the angles must be equal to 360°.
FIGURE 4.7: Pie Chart showing Items in Example 4.7 It is possible the values of the items are given as percentages of the total values of the items.
To find the sectoral angles, we only need to multiply the respective percentage with 360° NOUN 57  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Example 4.8 Suppose the basic elements of cost of a restaurant are expressed as percentages of sales as follows.
Elements Cost as % Sales Food Cost 40 Labour Cost 35 Overhead Cost 15 Net Profit 10 Sales 100 Obtain the sectoral angle for elements of cost.
Sectoral Angles Food Cost = 40 x 3600 = 1440 100 Labour Cost = 35 x 3600 = 126 100 Net Profit = 1 x 360 = 360 1 4.0 Conclusion You learned in this unit the graphical representations that summarize the data further after the frequency distribution has been constructed.
You learned that histogram is constructed by plotting frequency against the class boundaries [not class limits]; frequency polygon is constructed by plotting frequency against class mark and the ogive or cumulative frequency curve is constructed by plotting cumulative frequency against the upper class boundary.
You also learned how to represent other forms of data with bar charts and pie charts.
Of all these graphs and charts only pie chart can be drawn on plan sheet of paper, all the others are to be constructed on graph sheets.
NOUN 58  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 5.0 Summary This unit taught graphic representation of frequency distributions in terms of histogram, frequency polygon and ogive.
The unit also taught graphical representation of other forms of data with bar and pie charts.
Subsequent units will teach the computation of measures of central tendency from ungrouped and grouped data.

1.0 Introduction In unit 4, you learned how to construct graphs from frequency distribution and charts from raw data.
The graphs and the charts gave us the trend and the patterns in the data.
As beautiful and useful as these graphs and charts are, they do not give us any precise understanding of the reality of the information contained in the data.
We need single measures that can describe certain characteristics of the data and that give us a more precise understanding of the information the graphs and charts can give.
This will help us make quicker and better decisions without the need to consult our original observation.
One of such measures is the arithmetic mean In this unit you will learn how to compute the mean from ungrouped and grouped data and how to compute weighted mean.
You will also learn the characteristics of the arithmetic mean.
2.0 Objective NOUN 61  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I At the end of this unit, you should be able to compute the mean of the grouped data with or without a frequency distribution, and • Compute the mean of grouped data • List the properties, advantages and disadvantages of the arithmetic mean • Compute weighted mean for some data 3.1 The Arithmetic Mean 3.1.1 The Arithmetic Mean of Ungrouped Data We use average many times to mean ~he arithmetic mean.
We compute arithmetic mean for both ungrouped and grouped data.
We also compute arithmetic mean, which we henceforth in this unit call mean, for both the sample and the population from where the sample is drawn.
Mean computed for the sample is called a statistic and it is donated by x.
The mean computed for the population is called a parameter and is denoted by u You should note in this course that any measure computed for the sample is called statistic and any measure computed for the population is called parameter.
The mean of ungrouped data is the summation of the values in the set of data divided by the number of values in the set of data.
For a sample the number of values is denoted by n, that is the sample size, and for the population the population size is given as N. - Mean of ungrouped data (if a sample) is x n ∑×i Where x = i=n1n n ∑ = Summation ×i = Different values of a variable n = Sample size Example 5.1 NOUN 62  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Compute the mean for the following: Scores:7, 5, 8, 10, 11, 6, 3 , 4, 10, 9,13, 2.
Mean= x = 7+5+8+10+11+6+3+4+10+9+13+2 12 = 88 = 7.33 12 You will realize that there is no frequency distribution for this example.
Suppose there is a frequency distribution for the values of a variable, then how do we calculate the mean?
This is simple.
If we are computing the mean for a sample, that is x, the mean _ x = ∑fixi or ∑fixi ∑fi n fi = different frequencies of values in the set of data xi = different values in the set of data ∑ f i or n is equal to the number of values in the set of data.
Example 5.2 The table below gives the frequency distribution of the mark scored by 20 students in a test conducted in Statistics for Management Scores Frequency NOUN 63  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 11 2 12 3 13 5 14 7 15 2 16 1 You are required to calculate the mean of the scores To solve the problem, you should (i) Multiply each score by its respective frequency to obtain fixi (ii) Add up the products of each score and its respective frequency to ∑ obtain fixi ∑ (iii) Add up all the frequencies to obtain fi or n. ∑ ∑ (iv) Divide fixi by fi to obtain the mean.
Scores (xi) Frequency (Fi) Fixi 11 2 22 12 3 36 12 5 65 14 7 98 15 2 30 16 1 16 Total 20 276 ∑ Mean = x =∑ n fixi = 276 = 13.35 ∑ i = 1 fi 20 There can be another method of computing the mean apart from using NOUN 64  BHM106 BUSINESS STATISTICS I ∑ x = fixi ∑ fi ∑ fidi we use the assumed mean, A, then the mean x = A + ∑fi where A = Assumed mean di = xi-A for all the values of xi Example 5.3: For the example 5.2, let us compute the mean again using an assumed mean of 13.
We will then have the table below for the solution of the problem.
Scores (Xi) fi di = Xi – A fidi 11 2 11-13 =-2 -4 12 3 12-13 = -1 -3 13 5 13-13 = 0 0 14 7 14-13 = 1 7 15 2 15-13 = 2 4 16 1 16-13 = 3 3 Total 20 7 Where Assumed mean A = 13 Mean = x = 13 + 7 = 13 + 0.35 = 13.35 20 You will see that with the method of assumed mean, we should obtain the same value of mean we had before.
3.1.2 The Arithmetic Mean of Grouped Data You have learned how to compute the arithmetic mean of ungrouped data.
When the values are many in a set of data, there is the need to group them into class intervals.
You learned about this in unit 3.
We need to take some time to compute the mean of grouped data.
Example 5.4 NOUN 65  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The earning per share (in kobo) of some firms is presented below with the frequency distribution.
Earning per share (in kobo) Frequency 65-69 3 70-74 4 75-79 11 80-84 15 85-89 9 90-94 5 95-99 3 You are required to calculate the mean of the distribution.
To solve this question, we need to compute the class mark for the class intervals.
The class mark becomes the Xi we will use in the computation.
Immediately this is done, the whole distribution is reduced to the form of an ungrouped data with frequency distribution.
You should recall that class mark is the mean of the upper and lower class boundaries (or Limits) of a class interval.
Class Mark I Frequency ∑XIfI Xi fi Fixi 67 3 201 72 4 288 77 11 847 82 15 1230 87 9 783 92 5 460 97 _3 291 TOTAL 50 4100 Mean x = 4100 = 82 50 The average earning per share of the firms is 82 kobo.
From the computation, you will still realize that the mean of a grouped data is given as ∑ fi×i NOUN 66 ∑ fi  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I x = the xi here are the various values of the class marks of the class intervals.
The assumed mean method can also be used here.
Example 5.5: Using the assumed mean method, compute the mean of the distribution in example 5.4 We will still make use of the frequency distribution of the class mark Class Mark Frequency A=77 xi fi di=xi-77 Fidi 67 3 -10 -30 72 4 -5 -20 77 11 0 0 82 15 5 75 87 9 10 90 92 5 15 75 97 3 20 60 TOTAL 50 250 We assume a mean of 77 _ ∑ fidi ×= A + ∑ fi _ × = 77 = 250 = 82 50 We still obtain the same mean as before.
Example 5.1 For the distribution below, compute the mean, using the two methods we have used in this unit.
NOUN 67  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Class Intervals Frequency 0-9 4 10-19 6 20-29 18 30-39 11 40-49 6 50-59 5 3.2 The Weighted Mean Some times we are interested in showing the relative importance of some items.
When we do, we attach weights, apart from the real values of the items.
For instance in the Open University, some courses in a programme are core courses while the others are auxiliary courses.
Core courses tend to have more credit unit than the others.
When we attach weighs to items we can only compute the weighted mean.
_ ∑ wi×i The weighted mean is given as: × = w ∑wi Where xi = values of the items Wi = relative weights of the item Xw = Weighted mean Example 5.6 NOUN 68  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The percentage scores of a student in some courses and the credit units of the courses are given below: Courses % Score Credit Unit HEM 101 52 3.0 HEM 102 64 3.0 HEM 103 71 3.0 HEM 104 45 3.0 GNS 101 82 2.0 GNS 126 55 1.0 Calculate the weighted percentage mean for the scores.

The academic standard of the University shows the following scores, grades and grade points Score Grades Grade Point Above 75 A 4.0 70-74 AB 3.5 65-69 B 3.25 60-64 B C 3.0 55-59 C 2.75 50-54 CD 2.5 45-49 D 2.25 4044 E 2.0 below 40 F 0.0 With this information, compute the weighted grade point average for the student to two decimal places.
3.3 Advantages And Disadvantages Of Arithmetic Mean 3.3.1 Advantages of Arithmetic Mean.
The arithmetic mean has the following advantages (i) Mean is the best known of all the averages (ii) Mean can be used for further mathematical process.
Mean is used to perform statistical procedures such as estimation and hypothesis testing.
(iii) Mean is unique, unlike mode (this will be discussed later], because a set of data has one and only one mean.
3.3.2 The disadvantages of mean Arithmetic mean has the following disadvantages.
NOUN 70  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (i) Since all the values in a set of data are used to compute the mean, the mean can be influenced by extreme values For instance the mean of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 is 3+4+ 5+6+7 = 5 5 There is no extreme value here.
Suppose we have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 19, we then have an extreme value, 19.
The mean becomes 3 + 4 +5 + 6 +7 +19 = 44 = 7.33 5 5 The extreme value has greatly influenced the mean.
(ii) A mean may result into an impossible value where the data is discrete.
For instance, If the number of female students in five programmes at the National Open University are 35, 38, 42, 53, and 66, the mean value of the female students will be 35+38+42+53+66 = 234 = 46.8 Students 5 5 This is an impossible value.
(iii) We are unable to compute mean for data in which there are open- ended classes either at the beginning of the distribution or at the end of the distribution.
It will be difficult to know the class mark of the open-ended class.
4.0 Conclusion This unit teaches the computation of the arithmetic mean from grouped and ungrouped data.
It also teaches the computation of the weighted mean.
Some advantages and disadvantages of the arithmetic means were given in the unit.
Subsequent unit will teach other measures of central tendency.
5.0 Summary You learned in this unit the computation of arithmetic mean and weighted mean.
The advantages and disadvantages of mean were also learned.

You also learned that the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used of all the means.
Many times we are dealing with some quantities that change over a period of time.
Examples of such cases are growth rates in the population, the growth factors of interest values.
In all those situations, the computation of the arithmetic mean maybe inappropriate.
The appropriate means in those situations are geometric and harmonic means.
This unit will discuss these types of mean.
Examples will be worked.
Exercises will also be provided to show your understanding of the unit.
2.0 Objective By the end of the unit, you should be able to: Compute harmonic mean for a set of values Compute harmonic mean for a set of values List the uses of geometric and harmonic means.
3.1 GEOMETRIC MEAN NOUN 73  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.1 Computation Of Geometric Mean For values x , x , x , .
.
.
x the geometric mean is the nth root of the product l 2 3 n of the values.
The geometric mean is denoted as GM therefore GM = n√x, X , x , .
.. x 1 2 3 n Where GM is geometric mean x , X, x , .
.. x are values of the variable of 1 2 3 n interest, while n represents the sample size.
(i) Multiply the values all together to get the product (ii) Take the nth root of the product Example 6.1 What is the geometric mean of 3, 5, 6, and 7?
GM 4√3x5x6x7x = 4 √630 = 5.01 When the values are many this may be difficult to compute.
We can also compute the geometric mean as follows; The formula for geometric mean is: GM =n√x.x .x …x 1 2 3 n We can take the logarithm of both sides and obtain log GM = long GM = n√x.x .x …x 1 2 3 n Under this situation we have Log GM = f log x + f log x …f log x 2 1 2 2 n n n NOUN 74  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I If the values have frequency distribution, the geometric means will be given as: Log GM = f2 log x1 + f2 log x2 …fn log xn ∑f 1 After getting the values of the logarithm and we have done the addition of all the logarithmic values we will take the anti-log of the value to obtain the geometric mean.
Example 6.2 Using logarithm, compute the geometric mean of 3, 5, 6 and 7 GM = 4 √3x5x6x7 Log GM = log 3+log5+log6+log7 4 Log3 = 0.4771 Log5 = 0.6990 Log6 = 0.7782 Log7 = 0.8451 Total = 2.7994 Log GM = 2.7994 = 6998 4 Anti-log 0.6994 = 5.01 Suppose there is a frequency distribution for the value.
We can still compute the geometric mean.

Example 6.4 Suppose the rates of growth in the sales of a product over a period of 5years are 8%, 10%, 12%, 18% and 24%.
If the sales in year 0 is N100, 000,000 what is the sales at the end of the fifth year?
We may wish to find the mean rate of growth as NOUN 76  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 8 + 10 + 15 + 18 + 24 = 14.4% 5 Having got this we can get the sales at the end of the fifth year to be equal to 100,000,000 x 1.134 x 1.144 x 1.144 x 1.144 x 1.144 =N195,943,166.6.
You will see that we use the factor of 1.144 when the rate of growth is 14.4%.
This is correct because we will need to add 100% and 14.4% to get the new value for a year 100%+14.4% = 100 + 14.4 =1.144 100 100 The factor obtained here using arithmetic mean may not be appropriate.
The appropriate factor should be obtained using geometric mean.
The appropriate growth rate is: √ GM = 5 1.08 x 1.1x 1.12 x 1.18 x 1.24 = 1.1425 The true growth rate is therefore 14.25% and not 14.4%.
That we got initially.
The sales at the end of the fifth year will then be equal to 100,000,000 x 1.1425 = N194,687,539.2 3.1.2 Uses of Geometric Mean The geometric mean is used mainly in connection with index numbers.
It is also used for arranging ratios.

1.0 Introduction.
In the last two units, you learned about some measures of central tendency, their computation, their advantages and disadvantages.
In this unit you will still learn about more measures of central tendency, their computation, advantages and disadvantages.
We are often very interested in what is happening to the majority of the population and we show concern for this,.
In this unit two important measures, median and mode, concerned with what happens to the center of the set of values will be worked and exercises will be provided to test your understanding of the content of the unit 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Compute the median for both the ungrouped and grouped data.
• Estimate median from the cumulative frequency curve.
• Compute the mode for both the ungrouped and group data.
• Estimate the mode from a histogram.
• List the advantages and the disadvantages of median and mode.
3.1 MEDIAN 3.1.1 Computation Of Median From Ungrouped And Grouped Data.
NOUN 81  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The median is a measure that shows the most central item in a set of data.
It is a single value computed from the set of data that measures the central item in the data.
If median is the most central item in the set of data, half of the values in the set must lie below the median, and the other half above the median To calculate the median, there is a need to have a mathematical definition of the median ( ) n + 1 th Median = the 2 item in the set of data.
Where n is the number of values in the set of data.
For an ungrouped data with odd number of values, the item in the middle constitutes the median.
Example 7.1 What is the median of 17, 12, 13, 15, 18?
These values are not arranged in any order.
To find the median, we need to order the arrangement of the values.
as 12, 13, 15, 17, 18.
The value in the middle is 15 and that is the median.
Using our formula for median ( ) n + 1 th Median = the item 2 ( ) 5 + 1 th 2 item = 3rd item The third item is 15 Suppose we have an even number of values such as 8, 4, 3, 5,9,2,11,7., what will be the median?.
We need to order the arrangement of the values as 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11 NOUN 82  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I ( ) n + 1 th There are 8 values.
The median is therefore the item 2 ( ) 8 + 1 th item 2 = 4.5 item The 4.5th item an only be between 5 and 7.
Therefore the median will be equal to ( ) 5 + 7 th 2 = 6 Suppose we have ungrouped data with frequency distribution, how do we compute the median?
We still compute the median the same way we did the two previous examples Example 7.2 For the distribution below, compute the median Scores Frequency 2 3 3 4 4 6 5 7 6 5 7 3 8 2 NOUN 83  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The sum of the frequencies here is 30.
There are people examined.
The ( ) 30 + 1 th median should now be the item 2 = 15.5th 5 + 5 = 5 The median (the 15.5th value) is 2 To obtain the median for grouped data, we still do the same thing we did previously.
However, we can decide to adopt the use of formula for the median.
Some authors use the formula shown below Median = L + J x w 1 fi Where L = Lower class boundary of the median class 1 fi = frequency of class that contain the median w= class width of class containing the median J = n minus sum of all the frequencies up to, but not including the medium 2 class.
∑fi n = sum of all the frequencies in the set of values Some other authors uses the formula below for median 30 + 1 - (f + 1) Sample median = 2 w + Lm fm Where m = total number of items in the distribution f = sum of all the class frequencies up to, but not including, the median class fm = frequency of median class w = class width Lm = lower limit of median class interval for the purpose of this course, we will continue to use Median = L + J x w 1 fl Example 7.3 NOUN 84  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I For the distribution below, compute the median Class interval Frequency 0-499 229 500-999 306 1000-1499 398 1500-1999 298 2000-2499 127 2500-2999 66 3000-more 26 1450 + 1 th item The sum of the frequency here is 1450 the median is the 2 The median class is then 1000 -1499 Since the 725.5th item lies in the class.
From the first two classes we obtain (229 + 306) items = 535 items.
In the third class containing 398 items, we can get 190.5 items to make up for the 725.5 items we are looking for.
Since the median class is 1000 -1499, the lower class boundary = 1000,the fi = frequency of the median class = 398.
The class boundaries for the median class interval are 1000 - 1500.
The class width is equal to 500 J = 1450 – (229 + 306) = 190 2 Median = 1000 + 190 x 500 = 1238.69 398 3.1.2 Estimation Of Median Using Ogive We can also estimate the median by plotting ogive for the set of data.
Example 7.4 Plot an ogive for the table below and estimate the median from the ogive NOUN 85  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Class I fi 1-1.99 2 2-2.99 5 3-3.99 6 4.499 7 5.599 5 6-6.99 3 7.799 2 We will need to obtain the cumulative frequency distribution to plot the ogive.
Upper Class Cumulative frequency 1.00 0 1.00 2.00 2 3.00 7 4.00 13 5.00 20 6.00 25 7.00 28 8.00 30 To obtain the ogive, we plot the cumulative frequency against the upper class boundary as we discussed previously NOUN 86  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I ( ) n th The median is taken as 2 the median is taken as 15th value here.
Locate the 15.0 value along the vertical axis and draw it to meet the curve.
At the point it meets the curve, draw a vertical line to meet the horizontal at the point the line meets the horizontal axis is the median.
The estimate of the median here is 4.5 (from ogive) 3.13 Advantages and Disadvantages of median The median cannot be influenced by extreme values as in the case of the means since not all the values are involved in the calculation of the median.
(ii) The median can be calculated from incomplete records and for open ended classes if the median does not fall into the open ended class.
(iii) It is not difficult to recognize the median Median also has a number of disadvantages (1) Median cannot be subjected to further statistical processing as it is with mean.
(2) To compute median we need to order the values.
This can consume time.
NOUN 87  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Exercise 7.1 For the table below, i. Compute the median ii.
Draw the ogive and estimate the median Class Interval Frequency 21-30 2 31-40 6 41-50 9 51-60 9 61-70 11 71-80 6 81-90 4 91-100 3 3.2 Mode 3.2.1 Computation of Mode from Ungrouped and Grouped Data Mode is another measure of central tendency.
It is simply defined as the value with the highest frequency in a set of values.
Unlike mean and median, the mode can have more than one value in a set of data.
Example 7.5 From the distribution below, find the mode X (ages in years I Frequency 1 5 5 6 7 7 8 8 11 NOUN 88  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 10 3 11 2 12 1 The mode is 8 because it has the highest frequency of 11.
Suppose we replace the frequency of those in age of 10 years by 11, the distribution will have two modes, that is 8 and 10 respectively.
We can also calculate the mode from grouped data.
To do this, we will use the formula.
Mode = Ll + d i x w where Li = Lower class boundary of the modal class di + d 2 d =frequency of the modal class minus frequency of the class just before the 1 modal class d = frequency of the modal class minus frequency of the class just above the 2 modal class W = Class width Example 7.6 For the distribution below computer the mode.
Class I Frequency 22-26.9 5 27-31.9 8 32-36.9 14 37-41.9 23 42-46.9 19 47-51.9 7 52-56.9 4 The modal class in this question is 37-41.9.
L = lower class boundary = 37 1 NOUN 89  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I W = class width = 42 -37 = 5 fi = frequency of the modal class = 23 fo = frequency of class before the modal class = 14 f2 = frequency of class after the modal class = 19 d=fi-fo=23-14=9 l d =f -f =23-19=4 2 1 2 mode = 37 + 9x5 = Li + d1xW 9+4 dl +d2 = 40.46 = 40.5 3.2.2 Estimation Of Mode Using Histogram By plotting the histogram, as was discussed in unit 4, we can also estimate the mode of the distribution.
Example 7.7 Using the table in example 7.6, plot the histogram and estimate the mode.
Class Boundaries Frequency 22-27 5 27-32 8 32-37 14 37-42 23 42-47 19 47-52 7 52-57 4 For histogram, you will recall that you still plot the frequency against the class boundaries NOUN 90  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I FIGURE 7.2: Histogram for Example 7.7 25 20 15 10 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 Class Boundary The mode obtained from the histogram is 40.0.
This is a good estimate of the computed mode.
3.
2.3 Advantages And Disadvantages Of Mode Modes has a number of advantages: i.
It can be used as central location, just as in the case of median for both qualitative date ii.
Since its computation does not involve all the values in a set of data, it can be computed from an incomplete record and it is not influenced by extreme values as it is the case with mean Mode also has a number of disadvantages: i It is not as commonly used, as much as means are, to measure central tendency ii There may not be mode in a distribution if every value has the same frequency as others.
iii.
There can be many modes in a distribution resulting into a problem of interpretation.
NOUN 91  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Exercise 7.2 For the table in exercise 7.1, i. Compute the mode ii.
Draw the histogram and estimate the mode 4.0 Conclusion In this unit, you learned that median of an ungrouped data is the median ( ) n + 1 th should now be the item in the distribution.
2 You also learned that the median of a grouped data is given by Li + JxW ft All the notations were properly defined in the unit.
The median was also estimated from the ogive drawn from a frequency distribution.
Mode is defined as the value with the highest frequency for ungrouped data.
For grouped data, mode is defined as equal to L + dixw 1 d + d 1 2 All notifications are carefully defined in the unit.
The unit gives both the advantages and disadvantages of median and mode.
5.0 Summary The unit teaches median and mode and their computation from ungrouped and grouped data.
It also shows the estimation of measures graphically.
Subsequent units will teach measure of dispersion.

Introduction In the previous unit, you learned about mean and median.
These are location parameters.
These measures can be located on the horizontal axis of a distribution when the distribution is graphed.
There is also interest in some other location parameters such as quartiles, deciles and percentiles.
These show the value of item which are given fractions of the way through a distribution.
The skewness further shows the relative positions of the mode, median and mean in the distribution.
The Kurtosis also reveals the peakedness of a distribution.
In this unit, you will learn about the various characteristics of a distribution before proceeding to the measures of dispersion.
2.0 Objectives NOUN 94  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • Compute different types of fractiles in a distribution • Describe different types of skewness.
• Compute the degree of skewness in a distribution • Locate the relative positions of mode, median and mean in a distribution.
• Explain measures of Kurtosis of a distribution.
3.1 Fractiles 3.1.1 Quartiles A Fractile is defined as the value of the item which is a given fraction of the way through a distribution as given below.
Suppose we have a distribution given below 163, 175, 184, 193, 206, 209, 219,233,224,228,231,235 the value of an item one quarter of the way through the distribution will be 12 item.
4 This is equal to the third.
Item in the distribution, and the value is 184.
The value of an item three quarters of the way through the distribution will be 3 x 12TH item.
This is the 4 9th item.
The value from the distribution will be 224.
One of the important fractiles is the quartile in a distribution - the lower and the upper quartiles.
The lower quartile tile is the value of item and it is designated as Q1.
The upper quartile is the value of item three quartile the way through the distribution and it is designated as Q3.
To compute lower and upper quartiles for grouped data, we still adopt the formula used for calculation of the median.
Quartile = Li + J x W fi Where L = Lower class boundary of the class containing the quartile.
1 W = Class width of the class interval fi = frequency of the class containing the quartile J = Total frequency multiplied by the percentage value of the quartile minus the sum of all class frequencies up to, but not including, the quartile class Example 8.1 NOUN 95  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Using the frequency distribution table below, compute the lower and the upper quartiles for the distribution Class intervals 3-7 8-12 13-17 18-22 23-27 28-32 Frequency 6 8 16 10 7 3 In this distribution, the total frequency is 50.
25% of the item (for first quartile) is 12.5th .
75% of the items (for third quartile) that is upper quartile is 5 x 50 = 37.5th item 100 For the first quartile, that is lower quartile, we are looking for the value of the 12.5`" item.
From the distribution, the 12.5th item can be found in class interval 8-12.
Therefore L1= 17.5, fi = 10,W = 22.5 - 17.5 = 5 J=37.5-30=7.5 Upper quartile = 17.5 + 7.5 x 5 10 =21.25 You have learned that the class width is the difference between the upper class and the lower class boundaries.
For class interval 18 -22, the lower class boundary remains 17.5 and the upper class boundary 22.5 hence class width is 22.5 - 17.5 = 5.
3.1.2 Decile This is another fractile showing the tenths of the way through a distribution Example 8.2 NOUN 96  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Suppose we have a distribution given below, let us show and compute some decile.
Class intervals Frequency Cumulative frequency 20-40 11 11 40-60 27 3 8 60-80 32 70 80-100 26 96 100-120 14 110 120-140 10 120 The first decile is the value of the item 1 of the way through the distribution 10 and our table, is the 1 X 120th item = 12th item.
10 You should know that the total number of items (11 + 32 x 26 + 13 + 10) is 120.
The eight decile in the distribution is 8 x 120th item = 96th item.
10 The first decile will be found in class interval 40 - 60 and the eight decile in class interval 80-100.
From the table.
Let us compute the second and the seventh deciles.
Second Decile The position of item = 2 x 120 = 24th item.
10 This is located in class interval 40 - 60.
To compute the decile, we use the same formula we used for the median and quartile.
Decile = L + J x W 1 fi Where L = lower class boundary of the class containing the decile.
1 W = class width of the class interval fi = frequency of the class containing the decile NOUN 97  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I J = Value of item of the decile minus the cumulative frequency.
For second decile, the class interval containing the 24th value is 40 - 60 therefore L = 40, fi=27,W=20J=24-11=13.
1 You should know that the class boundaries are used to describe the class interval here since the class-intervals overlap.
Second decile 40 + 13 x 20 = 49.63 1 27 1 The Seven decile This is the value of 7 x 120th item = 84th item.
10 The 84`h item falls into 80 -110 Therefore L1 80, fi =26, W = 20 J= 84 - 70 = 14 Seventh decile = 80 + 14 x 20 = 90.77 26 3.1.3 Percentile These are fractiles that relate to the hundredths of the way through distribution.
The 60th percentile is denoted as P .
This is 85th of the way through the 60 100 distribution.
The formula for computing percentile is Pth percentile = L + J x W 1 fi Where, L = lower class boundary of the class containing the percentile 1 W= class width of the class interval fi = frequency of the class containing the percentile.
J = Pth percent of the total frequency minus cumulative frequency of the class between the class containing the percentile.
Example 8.3 Using the table in example 8.2, calculate the 60th percentile (P 60) and 85th percentile (P85) Let us rewrite the table here NOUN 98  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Class intervals I Frequency Cumulative frequency 20-40 11 11 40-60 27 38 60-80 32 70 80-100 26 96 100-120 14 110 120-140 10 120 60th percentile (P ) 60 60 x 120 [72th] item 100 the class containing P = 80 – 100 60 L =80,fi=26,W=20,J=72-70=2 1 P = 80x20 = 81.54 60 26 85th percentile (P ) 85 85 x 120 =102th item 110 the class containing the 102th item is 100 – 120 Therefore L = 110, fi =14, W = 20 J= 102 - 96 = 6 1 85th percentile = P = 110 + 6 x20 = 108.57 85 14 Exercise 8.1 NOUN 99  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Salaries (N 000) No of Workers 1-3 8 3-5 12 5-7 16 7-9 22 9-11 18 11-13 14 13-15 10 Using the table above, compute (i) Lower and upper quartiles (ii) Fourth and the sixth deciles (iii) 45th and 78th percentile 3.2 Skewness 3.2.1 Symmetry and Skewness In unit 4, you drew histogram.
The histogram drawn from a frequency distribution can reveal certain features about the distribution.
It can reveal whether the distribution is symmetry or skewed.
A symmetry distribution has a peak at the middle of the distribution with the slopes on the either side of the peak virtually equal to each other (see fig.
8.1) When the distribution is not symmetrical skewness is revealed.
There can be positive and negative skews.
3.2.2 Direction Of The Skews The direction of the skew depends on the relationship of the peak of the distribution to the centre (mean) of the histogram.
For positive skew [see figure 8.2 the peak lies to the left of the centre of the distribution.
For negative skew [see figure 8.3] the peak lies to the right of the centre of the distribution.
FIGURE 8.1 Symmetrical distribution NOUN 100  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I FIGURE 8.2 Positive Skew NOUN 101  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I FIGURE 8.3 Negative Skew (915) 3.2.3 Degree Skew There is more than one way of obtaining the degree of skewness.
In this unit, we will adopt the pearson coefficient of skewness denoted as SK SK = 3 (mean – median) If the SK computed is positive, there is positive skew standard deviation If it is negative the skew is negative.
If the value is 0, there is a symmetrical distribution.
3.2.4 Averages in a Skewed Distribution It gives better understanding of a frequency distribution to know the relative position of mode, median and mean in skewed distribution.
Figure 8.5 shows the position of the measures in a symmetrical distribution.
Figure 8.5 is a positively Skewed distribution and figure 8.6 is negatively skewed distribution.

3.1.3 Quartile Deviation.
3.1.4 Standard Deviation 3.1.5 coefficient of Variation 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References and other Resources 1.0 Introduction In unit 5, you learned how to compute the means and indeed you did compute the means.
The means of the distribution computed do not show whether the values of the distribution are clustered closely together or they spread.
It is even not unusual to see two sets of values with same mean but different degrees of spread.
You realize that the per capital income (mean income/person) is important to the economist as well as the distribution of income.
The per capital income may be high and majority of the populace is still very poor.
While per-capital income shows the mean of incomes, the distribution of the income shows the spread.
The emphasis in this unit is on computation of variation between the values in a distribution and the mean of the distribution.
This leads us to the computation of the following measures of distribution; namely, range, semi-inter quartile range, mean deviation, standard deviation and co-efficient of variation.
2.0 Objectives NOUN 109  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I At the end of this unit, you will be able, after going through the worked, examples and the exercise, to Compute the range for the distribution Compute the semi -inter quartile range for a distribution Compute mean deviation for a distribution Compute standard deviation for a distribution Compute the co-efficient of variation 3.1.1 Range The range of a distribution is the difference between the highest and the lowest values in a distribution.
Example 9.1 What is the range of the following values?
2,3,5,6,8,9,11,22,34, Range =34-2=32.
The range shows how far apart the lowest and the highest value in the distribution.
It can be influenced by extreme values.
It is however the simplest measure of dispersion.
3.1.2 Mean deviation The interest here is on how far away are the values in a distribution from the mean of the distribution.
The mean deviation is computed by taking the sum of the absolute value of the deviations of the values in the distribution from the mean of the distribution and dividing the sum by number of value in the distribution.
∑ Mean Deviation = |X-×| i n Example 9.2 Find the mean deviation of 4,6,8,9,11,12, and 13.
The mean= x = 4+6+8+9+11+1 = 9 9 NOUN 110  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I ∑ X X- x [X-×] i i i 4 -5 6 -3 3 8 -1 1 9 0 0 11 2 2 12 3 3 13 4 4 18 _ | X-× | is the absolute value of X - x and is equal to the positive value of the i i result obtained.
For example |5-9| =4 Mean deviation = 18 =2.57 7 If a group data constitutes the distribution then the _ ∑f |X - x| Mean deviation = 1 ¡ ∑f ¡ Where x here is the class mark of individual class interval l Example 9.3 Compute the mean deviation of the distribution below Class intervals Frequency 10-14 3 15-19 5 20-24 7 25-29 3 30-34 2 NOUN 111  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The solution is as follows xi(class marks) fi fixi | Xi-× | (fi | Xi-× |) 12 3 36 9 27 17 5 85 4 20 22 7 154 1 7 27 3 81 6 18 32 2 64 11 22 Total 20 420 94 Mean = 420 = 21 20 ∑f |X - x| = Mean deviation = 94 = 4.48 1 ¡ ∑f 21 ¡ The mean deviation is a better measure of dispersion than the ranges because calculation use all the values in the distribution.
It also shows how far, on the average, each of the values, lies away from the mean.
3.1.3 Quartile Deviation In unit 8, we computed values of quartile from distribution.
You may need to go back to this computation.
We have interquartile range and quartile deviation.
Quartile deviation can also be called semi- interquartile range.
While interquartile range measures how far we need to go from the median on either sides before we can include one half the values of the set of data, quartile deviation or semi-interquartile range measures the average range of one-fourth of the data.
Therefore, Interquartile Range = Q3 - Q1 Quartile Deviation = Q3-Q1 2 Where Q3 = upper quartile Q1= lower quartile NOUN 112  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Example 9.4 The annual electricity bills in a household are given below and arranged in ascending order.
The unit is in Naira.
250,540, 470, 590, 620, 650, 680, 690, 730, 750, 770, 810.
Calculate the Interquartile range and quartile deviation of the distributions.
The problem can be solved as follows: The lower quartile the value of the 1/4 x 12th item = 3rd item.
Lower = N570 The upper quartile is the value of the 3/4 x 12th item = 9'' item.
Interquartile range = 730 - 570 = 160 Quartile deviation = 730 - 570 = 80 2 3.1.3 Standard Deviation A measure of dispersion that enables us determine, with high degree of accuracy, where the values of a frequency distribution are located in relation to the mean, is standard deviation.
We can compute it for both the sample and the population from where the sample is taken.
When it is from the samples, it is a statistic denoted by S. When it is from the population, it is a parameter denoted by ∂ The variance of a distribution is the square of the standard deviation of the distribution.
Variance (when it is sample) = 52 Variance (population) = ∂2 The variance of the sample s2 is computed from this formula.
For a group of data: ∑f (X - x) S2 = 2 1 ¡ n-1 S2 = n∑f X2 (X - x )2 1 1 ¡ ¡ n(n-1) Where s2= variance of the sample n = total number of values or sample size f = respective frequency of xl i NOUN 113  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I x= class mark of the class interval for the population, the standard deviation i ∂2 = ∑f (X - x)2 1 ¡ Where ∂2 = population variance N = population size x = respective values of elements in the population i u = population mean.
Example 9.4 From the table below, compute the sample standard deviation.
Intervals 3-7 8-12 13-17 18-22 23-27 28-23 Frequency 6 8 16 10 7 3 Solution is as follows Intervals x= Class Mark F Fx Fx 2 i ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ 3-7 5 6 30 180 8-12 10 8 80 640 13-17 15 16 240 3840 18-22 20 10 200 4000 23-27 25 7 175 4375 28-23 30 3 90 2700 50 815 15735 You should note that class mark (x,) is the mean of the upper and the lower class boundaries or limits.
For this example, we shall compute the variance first from S2 = n∑ƒ X2 (∑f × )2 ¡ 1 ¡ n(n-1) Where n = ∑f¡ S2 = 50 x 15735 – 8152 50(50-1) NOUN 114  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I = 78675 -664225 2450 = 50.01 √ The standard deviation S = 50.01 = 7.072 3.1.4 Coefficient of Variation.
There may be the need to compare two distributions in terms of their variability.
The standard deviation of the distribution alone can not be used to achieve comparison without knowing the means of the distribution.
Again the unit of values used in the distribution may not be the same.
One unit may be in kilograms another unit may be in litre.
This makes comparison of the variability not easy since it is not easy to compare two things with different units.
We need to solve this problem by obtaining the coefficient of variation = ∂ x 100% x Exercise 9.5 Suppose the distribution of samples A and B have × = 5.2, × = 6.5 B B respectively.
A has a standard deviation of 1.5 and B 2.5.
Which of the distributions shows greater degree of variability?
Coefficient of variation of A 1.5 x 100 = 28.85 5.2 Coefficient of variation for B = 2.5 x 100 = 38.50% 6.5 Distribution B has greater variability than A.
Exercise 9.1 For the table below compute (a) (i) the mean (ii) mode (iii) median and (iv) standard deviation.
(b) From the measure in a above compute NOUN 115  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (i) Coefficient of variation (ii) Pearson Coefficient of skewness Marks 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 No of Student 10 16 30 14 10 4.0 Conclusion You learn in this unit different measures of dispersion namely, range, mean deviation, quartile deviation, interquartile range and coefficient of variations.
The distance of the two values of the average from the median was the focus of this unit.
A measure, coefficient of variation that determines the variability of the distribution and that is use to compare two distribution in term of their variability was discussed.
5.0 Summary The unit reveals the need to have a better understanding on variability exhibited by distribution by computing the values of coefficient of variation, semi-interquartile range in addition to the standard deviation.
The unit shows the difference in the computation of population variance and sample variance.

In this unit you will learn the basic concepts in the set theory and solve some problems involving the use of Venn diagrams.
2.0 Objectives • By the end of the unit, you should be able to • Understand set and the basic concept in set theory.
• Perform basic operations in set theory • Use Venn Diagram to solve some problems involving set theory.
NOUN 118  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1 Definition and Basic Concepts in Set Theory 3.1.1 Definition A Set is a collection of definite, distinct objects called elements or members of the set.
For the set theory, the set is written in Capital letter, Set A.
After each element there must be a comma.
The common bracket is not allowed.
A = { a, e, i, o, u} .
This is a correct representation of Set A.
A = (a, e, i, o, u).
This representation is not correct.
The correct bracket is not used.
A = {a, e, i, o, u) is a Set of English vowels.
Set B = {2, 3, 5, 7} is a Set of prime numbers between 0 and 10 3.1.2 Basic Concepts in Set Theory For a good understanding of Set theory, there is a need to define some Concepts you will need in this unit.
(i) Unit Set: is a Set with only one element.
Example of this are B={a} C = {p} (ii) Null Set: is a Set that contains no element.
It is an empty set.
Example is B={} or B = Ø When you use 0 for null set, the bracket should be avoided.
(iii) Universal Set: is a Set that contains all the elements in a study or a given discussion.
Examples are S = { male, female}.
This is a universal set for sexes of human beings B = [a, b,c,d................. x, y, z].This is a universal set for the English Alphabets.
Universal Set is designated as (iv) Subset: Set A is a subset of B if and only if every element in A is contained in B.
All Sets are subsets of the universal set.
A null set is a subset of all sets: Look at this example A= {a, e,i,o,u} B= {a, b, d, e, g,i,j,m,o,p,u,r} NOUN 119  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I A is a Subset of B because all the elements in A are contained in B (v) Equal Sets: Sets A and B are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.
(vi) Compliment of a Set: The complement of set A, designated as A1 is a set consisting all the elements in the universal set that are not in A.
For example = {the English Alphabets} B= {a, e,i,o,u} B compliment = B1 = fall the consonants) 3.2 Operations In Set Theory 3.2.1 Union of Sets The union of two sets A and B is another set consisting of all elements either in A or B or both.
These are all the elements in A and B without repetition of any element.
The union is designated by Union of sets A and B is given as A B.
A B= nA+nB-nA B.
Where A B is A intersection B.
This is the set of element(s) that are common to both set A and set B. nA = number of elements in A nB = number of elements in B nA B = number of elements that are common to both A and B. Example10.1 Suppose = { Set of all integers} A = {0, 1, 2, 3,-----} B = {1,3,5,7,------} C= {---6,-4,-2,0) Find (i) A B, (ii) A C (iii) B C1 NOUN 120  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (i) A B all elements in A and B without repetition of elements.
A B B A A B ={0,1,2,3------- }=A B is a subset of A, therefore A B = A.
(ii) A C= f-----6,-4,-2, 0, 1, 2 3------} (iii) For B C1, we will need to find C1 first.
C1is the compliment of C1 C1 is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not contained in C C1= {------- 5,-3,-1} B C={------- 5,-3,-1, 1,3,5,7-------} Example 10.2 Suppose there are 300 employees in an hotel and 120 of them have worked for the hotel for more than 5 years.
What are the two sets in this hotel in terms of working years in the hotel?
A ={ 120 employees who worked for more than 5 years } A1= {180 employees who worked for 5 or less than 5 years in the hotel) The two sets cannot overlap.
Such sets that do not overlap are called disjoint sets.
NOUN 121  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Example 10.3 There are three factories J, K, L supplying goods to warehouses A, B, C, and D, the amount of supplies from the factories to the warehouses are shown in the table below.

Therefore (i) J A = nJ+nA - n(J A) =153+160-72=241 (ii) K D = nK+nD - n(K D) = 91+115-22=175 (iii) C L = nC + nL = n{C L) = 50+147-22=175 3.2.2 Intersection The intersection of Sets A and B is a set of all the elements that are common to both sets A and B.

3.3 Venn Diagram 3.3.1 Use of Venn Diagram Venn Diagram is used to solve problems involving set theory.
Let us go through this aspect of set theory with an example.
Example 10.5 Suppose there are 75 students in a class with the students offering at least one of the subjects Chemistry Physics and Biology: 34 students offer Physics, 36 students offer Chemistry, and 41 students offer Biology.
13 students offer both Physics and Chemistry14 offer Physics and Biology and 15 offer NOUN 123  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Biology and Chemistry.
Represent the data on a Venn diagram and find the number that offer: (i) All subjects (ii) Biology only (iii) A subject only (iv) Two subjects only Let the set of P C B be represented by x.

In this unit you will learn other aspects of probability concepts, such as permutation and combination.
Many times, the focus is on computing the probability of some event or that of events.
Some times, the total number of possible events is large.
Under this condition, you need to have some method for counting the number of such events.
The permutation and combination that this unit presents are useful techniques for counting the number of events comprising the numerator and/or the denominator of a probability.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: Compute factorials of values • • Compute permutations for objects that are different • Compute permutation for objects that are not all different • Compile value of combination for objects.
3.1 Factorials NOUN 127  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.1 Computation of Values of factorial Let us define factorial.
If we have a positive integer n, the product of all the whole numbers from n down to 1, is called n factorial and it is written as n!
Therefore n!
= n!
(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)..................
I The values of n, since it is a positive integer are n =0, 1,2,3,4 ........................∞ Infinity:.
Let us use numerical values for n 5!
= 5x4x3x2x1 5!
= 5x4!
5!
= 5x4x3!
5!
= 5x4x3x2!
4!
= 4x3x2x1 4!
= 4x3!
4!
= 4x3x2!
Mathematically 1!
= !
O!
= !!
With the use of factorials, you can solve questions on the number of ways, objects or persons can be arranged in a line.
Example 2.1 Suppose there are 3 waiters on a restaurant, standing in a line against a wall, waiting for quests.
How many standing arrangements are possible?
If any of the waiters can stand in any position in the line The answer is 3!
= 3x2x1=6 We can also use a graphical means to solve the problem with the aid of a tree diagram.
We shall designate the positions as first, second, and third and the waiters as A, B and C, we have a tree diagram presenting the possible arrangements FIGURE 11.1 Tree Diagram NOUN 128  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I We now find out the number of possible arrangements is 6.
If instead of 3 waiters, we have 4 waiters, the number of possible arrangements will become 4!
= 4x3x2x1 = 24 ways 3.2 PERMUTATIONS 3.3 Computation of permutation for objects that are different Permutation can be defined as an ordered arrangement of objects.
The tree diagram Fig.
11.1 that shows possible arrangements of three objects taken three at a time gives the possible permutation of 3 objects taken 3 at a time.
In some situations, as in many cases in Nigeria, there more people applying NOUN 129  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I for the number of vacancies available.
For instance, we may wish to fill three positions and 15 people are applying.
How then do will go about it?
There are some ways we can solve the problem.
There can be the use of logical reasoning and factorial method.
We have 15 people available and 3 positions to fill.
The first position can be filled in one of 15 ways, the second in one of the 14 ways and the third in one of 13 ways.
The resulting possible ways will be the product of 15,14 and 13 that is 15 x 14 x 13 = 2730 ways.
You should realize that once the first position is filled, there are 14 persons remaining looking for 2 positions.
When the second position is filled, there are 13 persons remaining looking for 1 position and there is one of the 13 ways to fill the third position.
The example we are considering can be solved mathematically if we make distinction between the three positions to be filled.
What we are saying here is that we are having permutations of objects that are all different.
To fill three positions, when 15 persons are available, we have 15 permutation 3 symbolically we write it as 15P = 15!
3 (15-3)!
Generally, n permutation r, that is taking r items at a time from n items available is given as nPr = n!
(n-r)!
For our example 15P = 15!
= 15!
= 15xl4x13xl2!
= 2730 3 (15-3) !
12!

Example 2.2 Suppose there 10 different items to be stocked in the store and we have 6 bins for the storage, what are the possible arrangements?
We will now determine the permutation of 10 items taken 6 at a time I0P = 10!
= l0x9x8x7x6x5x4!

Calculation of Permutations from Objects That Are Not All Different.
You have learned the permutations of objects when all the objects are different.
This is not always the case in every situation.
In some instances one or more subsets of the items cannot be distinguishable.
In permutation we are required to determine how many distinguishable arrangements are possible.
This situation we are discussing could be represented as follows: nP n ,n n n = n!

n2!--- n !

3.3 COMBINATIONS 3.3.1 Computation of values of combination Combination is an arrangement of objects without regard to order.
The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is written as n!
(rn ) = n!
r!

= n factorials r factorials ((n-r) factorials.)
For instance if we have 3 objects A, B and C and we take 2 objects at a time, the permutations will be AB BA AC CA BC CB There are 6 ways of doing the arrangement.
This is 3P = 3!
= 6 2 (3 - 2)!
However, in combination, where there is no regard to order AB is the same as BA AC is the same as CA and BC is the same as CB hence The number of combinations will just be 3.

While some events are certain to occur some others can never occur.
Between these extreme lie most of the events of human activities.
There is always a lot of uncertainty in the occurrence of these events.
The unit therefore introduces you to probability that deals with concepts and measurement of uncertainty.
The unit therefore provides you the opportunity to understand some of the variability and complexity of the business world.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: * Understand some views of probability * Understand elementary properties of probability * Compute probability of an event.
3.1 Different Views Of Probability NOUN 135  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.1 Definition Of Probability Probability is defined as a value between 0 and 1 that shows the likelihood of occurrence of an event.
If the value is 0, the event can never occur.
For instance the probability that a Mango tree will bear an orange fruit is 0.
If the probability is 1, it means the event is sure to occur.
The probability that a man born of a woman will die one day is 1.
Death for any man is imminent.
Many other events have the values of the probability in between 0 and 1.
This raises the question of uncertainty.
There are two types of probability: a.
Objective and b. Subjective probabilities The objective probability can be subdivided into (i) The classical or prior probability (ii) The relative frequency concept or posterior probability Classical probability is defined as follows "If some event can occur in N mutually exclusive and equally likely ways and if m of these possess characteristic E, the probability of the occurrence of E is equal to M N (Daniel & Terrel, 1979) That is P(E) = M N P(E) is probability of characteristic E. Example 3.1 If a couple makes five trials at birth and records 3 male children.
What is probability of having a success if the birth of a male child is regarded as a success.
P(success) M N M=3 N=5 P(success) = 3 = 0.6 5 NOUN 136  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The relative frequency concept is also used to define probability.
For instance if we have a variable x; and we can draw a frequency distribution for the variable, then the relative frequency of a value of the variable is approximately equal to the probability of occurrence of the variable.
Example 12.2 Suppose a test is conducted for twenty students in the course Statistics for Management and the results of the test are as presented in the frequency distribution table below.
Calculate the probabilities of the students scoring a particular score in the distribution.
Score Frequency 2 1 3 2 4 5 5 6 6 3 7 2 8 1 To solve the problem we need to compute the relative frequency of each of the scores.
Total number of students is 20 Relative frequency of score 2 = 1 20 This is the frequency of 2 divided by the total frequency.
We can now prepare the relative frequency table for the distribution as follows NOUN 137  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Scores Frequency Relative frequency 2 1 0.05 3 2 0.10 4 5 0.25 5 6 0.30 6 3 0.15 7 2 0.10 8 1 0.5 From the table the probability that a student scores 6 is approximately equal to 0.15 that is 3 20 The relative frequency distribution table can also be used to find the values of many other probabilities.
For instance what is the probability that a student scores more than 5.
This will be the probability that a student scores 6 or 7 or 8.
This will be equal to the sum of these: Probabilities = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.30 3.1.2 Mutually Exclusive And Equally Likely Events Two events are mutually exclusive when they cannot occur together.
Examples of these are: (i) Sex of a child in a birth (ii) Values of throw when throwing a die (iii) Head and tail in a coin (iv) Win or loss when playing a match in which a winner must emerge.
When two events are mutually exclusive, the intersection of the events will be zero A B A B A B NOUN 138  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I These sets 'A and B are mutually exclusive.
Equally likely events are those events in which there is no reason to expect one event rather than the others to occur.
For instance, if a coin is not biased the head and tail are equally likely.
If a die is not biased, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are equally likely to occur.
Indeed, if there is no dominant effect of heredity on the sex of a child, male and female are equally likely events.
3.2 Properties Of Probability There are three properties of probability.
a.
The first one is derived from the definition.
Probability of an event is defined as a value between 0 and 1 that shows the likelihood of occurrence of the event.
Therefore probability of an event cannot be negative that is less than 0.
The probability can also not be more than 1.
Therefore the probability of an event with characteristic E is 0 ≤ P(E) ≤1.
This is the first property of probability.
b.
If events are both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive then the sum of the probabilities of the events is equal to 1.The events that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive are as follows.
(i) Male and female as sexes of a child in a birth.
(ii) Head and tail in a throw of a coin (iii) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a throw of a die With these examples, no other event can occur in each of the cases.
The events are therefore collectively exhaustive.
Since the events cannot occur simultaneously, the events are said to be mutually exclusive.
Therefore if events El, EZ, E3 ... E are both mutually and collectively n exhaustive then ∑P(E ) = P(E ) + P(E ) + P(E ).-P(E ) =1 1 1 2 3 n c. The occurrence of either of two events A or B or both is given as P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A C) But this holds when the two events can occur simultaneously.
However, if the two events are mutually exclusive then P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) NOUN 139  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I You should note that if two events are mutually exclusive, their intersection will be zero.
i.e.
(A B)=0 3.3 CALCULATING THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT 3.3.1 Conditional And Unconditional Probabilities It is necessary at this stage to introduce the use of the concepts introduced previously in this unit in solving of problems involving calculation of probabilities.
In this section we will treat two types of probabilities - the unconditional and conditional probabilities.
Let us explain these probabilities by solving a question that will bring the understanding of unconditional and conditional probabilities out properly.
Example 12.3 Suppose there are 70 Secretaries, cross-classified as by sex and marital status as follows: There are 20 male and 25 married Secretaries.
5 of the married Secretaries are male.
With this information, we will prepare a table with which we can calculate the various probabilities required.
Sex Marital Status Male (S1) Female (S2) Total Single (Ml) 15 30 45 Married (M2) 5 20 25 Total 20 50 70 Let us now look at the unconditional probabilities.
Total number of secretaries is 70.
The total married secretaries are 25, total single is 45, total male is 20 and total female is 50.
With these information, we can compute the following unconditional probabilities.
Probability of getting a female secretary is given by 50 70 = 0.7143 similiarly P (male) = 20 = 0.2857 70 P (single) = 45 = 0.6429 NOUN 140  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 70 P (married) = 25 = 0.3571 70 All these probabilities are unconditional probabilities The conditional probability can be treated as follows; From the table, some male are single and some are married hence male and single are not mutually exclusive; so also male and married.
The probability of getting a male given that he is single is given as: P (male/single) = P(male single) or P(single) P(male/single) = n(male single) n(single) Where P(male single) is probability of male intersection single and n(male n single) is the number that is common to both male and single.
This probability is a conditional probability Example 3.4 Using the table in example 3.1, calculate the following probabilities.
(i) Of getting a male given that is married (ii) Of getting a single given that is female (iii) Of getting married secretary given that he is a male (iv) Of getting a female secretary given that she is single.
1.
P(male/married) = n(male married)= 5 n(married) 25 = 0.2 Another method is P(male/married) = P(male married) P(married) P(male married) is equal to the number that is common to both male and married divided by the total number of secretaries.
In this example n(male married) = 5 total number of secretaries = 70 therefore P(male married) = 5 70 P(married) = 25 70 5 NOUN 141  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Therefore P(male wedded) = 70 P(married) 25 70 = 0.2 You may wish to use any of the methods, though 1 personally show preference for P(A/B) = n(A B) for any events A and B (B) 2 P(single/female) = n(single female) 30 n(female) 50 = 0.6 3 P(married/male) = n(married male) = 5 = 0.25 n(male) 20 4.
P(female/single) n(female single) 30 = 0.67 n(single) 45 Student Assessment Exercise 12.1 Suppose there are four types of appliances in the kitchen denoted by A , A , 1 2 A and A and the colours of the appliances are of 3 types C, C , C .

The unit presented the calculation of the probability of an event and worked out problems involving conditional and unconditional probabilities.
5.0 Summary You learned the three different points of view, classical, relative frequency and subjective, from which we can discuss probability.
You also learned the properties of probability as: (i) 0 < P(E) < 1 for events E1, E2, E3 ... E n (ii) For mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events El, E2, E3 ... E that ∑P(E;) = 1 n That is P(E ) + P(E ) + P(E ) ------ P(E ) = 1 1 2 3 n (iii) P(E or E or both) = P(E ) + P(E ) - P(E E ) but for mutually 1 2 1 2 1 2 exclusive events P(E E ) = P(E ) + P(E ).

There is a need to know the rules that are used in probability so that we can effectively solve problems involving probability.
This unit helps us to do this.
The unit will be useful in identifying some events that are important probability concepts.
The unit will also discuss Bayes' Theorem that will assist the solutions to some problems.
2.0 Objectives At the end of his unit, you should be able to: • Understand the addition and multiplication rules in probability • Explain independent and complimentary events • Solve problems involving joint probability and • Apply Bayes' Theorem to solving of questions involving probability.
3.1 Probability Rules NOUN 145  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.1 Addition Rule In unit 12, under properties of probability, you learned that the probability that event A or event B or both will occur is P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) = P(A B).
This is true when the events are not mutually exclusive, then P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A B) is known as the addition rule.
When the two events are mutually exclusive P(A B) = 0 Example 13.1 Let us go back to the table we had for 3.3 in unit 12 to illustrate numerically the addition rule.
SEX Marital Status Male (S 1) Female (S2) Total Single (M1) 15 30 45 Married (M2) 5 20 25 Total 20 50 70 The probability of picking either S or M or both is P(S M ) = P(s1) + 1 2 1 2 P(M ) - P(S M ) from the table, 2 1 2 P(S ) 20 , P(M ) 25 1 2 70 70 (S M ) = 5 1 2 P(S M ) = 5 1 2 70 5 is the value at the intersection of S and M and 70 is the total number of 1 2 people involved P(S M2) = P(S + P(M ) - P(S M ) = 20 + 25 – 5 = 40 = 4 1 P 2 1 2 70 70 70 70 7 NOUN 146  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.2 The Multiplication Rule This is another rule that is useful in the computation of the probability of an event.
In unit 12 under conditional probability, we discussed that the probability of event A given B is equal to P(A/ )= P(A B) for P(B) ≠0 B This relationship holds if P(B) is not equal to 0.
If P(B) is equal to 0, the definition of a probability 0 < P (∑) < 1 will be violated.
If we have P(A/ )= P(A B) P(B) B Then P(A B)=P(B) P(A/ ).
This is obtained by rearranging the preceding B equation.
P(A n B) is the probability of the joint occurrence of event A and event B.
The probability of joint occurrence of event A and event B is equal to the conditional probability of a given B that is P(A/ ) times the marginal B probability of B, that is P(B).
Therefore P(A B)=P(B) P(A/ ).
B Example 13.2 What is the probability of joint occurrence of M and S in the table used for 1 2 [ ] m example 4.1.
P(M S ) = P(B) P 1 2 1 S 2 [ ] P(S ) = 50 2 70 [ ] P m = (m S ) = 30 1 l 2 S n (S ) 50 2 2 P(M S ) = 50 x 30 = 30 = - 0.4286 1 2 70 50 70 3.2 Probability Of Events NOUN 147  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.2.1 Independent Events You learned in our discussion before that P(A B)=P(B) P(A/ ).
B Suppose the probability of event A is the same whether event B occurs or not then events A and B will be said to be independent event therefore P(A/ ) B = P(A) P(A/ ) = P(B) B P(A B) = P(A) P(B) You will recall that for all cases.
But if the events are independent then P(A n B) = P(A) P(B).
Example 13.3 Suppose there are 50 secretaries in the National Open University and 20 of them are single and 20 of them are male.
If 8 of the male are single, what is the probability that a secretary picked at random is married given her is female.
Let us prepare the required table for this required question.
Single (S1) Married (S ) Total 2 Male (M ) 8 12 20 1 Female (M ) 12 18 30 2 Total 20 30 50 What we are interested in is to show that when events A and B are independent, the P(A/ ) = P(A) B P(married) = 30 = 0.6 50 P( Married/ Female) = P(married Female) P(Female) P(married Female) = 18 50 P(Female) = 30 50 18 Therefore P(married /Female) = 50 = 18 x 50 = 18 = 0.6 NOUN 148  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 30 50 30 30 50 With this example, you will see that P(married) = P(married/ female).
It means that the fact that the married secretary is a female does not affect the probability that the secretary is married; therefore the two events are independent.
3.2.2 Complimentary Events Two events A and B are complimentary if and only if P(B) = 1 - P(B).
That is if (A) + P(B) = 1.
Examples of complimentary events are (1) Male and female (ii) Defective and not defective.
(iii) Failure and success.
3.2.3 Joint Probability Having treated multiplication rule there is a need to compute joint probability of events.
Example 13.4 It is known from experience that for a particular type of seedling, 3 out of 5 them transplanted will survive.
Suppose two of the seedlings are picked at random, what is the probability that: (i) Both of them survived (ii) The first survives and the second does not survive.
(iii) The first does not survive and the second survives (iv) None of the them survives Let S represents survival and f represents non - survival.
P(S) = 3/ =.6 5 P(f)=(1-0.6)=0.4 (i) Both survive = P(S) P(S) = 0.6 x 0.6 = 0.36 (ü) First survives and second does not survive = P(S) P(f) = 0.6 x 0.4 = 0.24 NOUN 149  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (iii) First fails and second survives = P(f) P(s) = 0.4 x 0.6 = 0.24 (iv) Both do not survive = P(f)(P(f) = 0.4 x 0.4 = 0.16 Exercise 13.4 1.
For the table below, compute (1) P(S M )(ii) P(M v S ) (iii) P(M n S ) 1 1 2 2 1 2 Si Sz M, 20 30 MZ 40 50 2.
If the probability that a hunter will hit a target is 2/ and the hunter 3 aims at the target two times, what is the probability that: (i) He hits it the two times?
(ii) He hits it once?
(iii) He hits first and misses second?
(iv) He misses it the two times?
3.3 Bayes Theorem The Baye theorem is stated as follows: Given B , B , B - - - - B , Mutually exclusive events whose union is the 1 2 3 n universe, and let A be an arbitrary event in the Universe, such that P(A) ≠ 0 then P(B/A) = P(A/B) P(B) j j j ∑(PA/B) P(B) j j Where J = 1, 2, 3------ n (Daniel & Terrel, 1979) P(B/A) = P(A B) j j P(A BI) +P(A B )----+P(A/B ) 2 n You should recall that (P(A B) = P(A/B) P(B) Example 13.5 NOUN 150  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Three tutors are assigned to mark the assignments of Hotel and Catering Management Students in the National Open University.
The tutor B marks 1 45 % of the assignment, the second tutor, B , marks 35% of the assignment 2 and the third tutor B marks 20% of the assignment.
3 The course coordinator vetted the marking and it is formed that the first tutor has an error of 0.03, the second 0.05 and the third 0.04.
If a script selected is found to have an error, what is the probability that, the script was marked by the first second or third tutor respectively?
We are going to apply B ayes theorem in the problem.
P(B ) = 45 = 0.45 1 100 P(B ) = 35 = 0.35 2 100 P(B ) = 20 = 0.20 3 100 P(A/B ) = 0.03 1 P(A/B2) = 0.05 P(A/B3) = 0.04 Let us draw a table for easy computation.
Events P(B) P(A/B) P(A n B) P(B/A) j j j B 0.45 0.03 0.0135 0.3462 1 B 0.35 0.05 0.0175 0.4487 2 B 0.20 0.04 0-008 0.2051 3 Total 0.039 1.00 You should note that P(A B) = P(A/B) P(B) j j j P(B / A) = P(A B) j j ∑ P(A B) j NOUN 151  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I For B , P(B/A) = 00135 = 0.3462 1 j 0.039 B , P(B/A)= 0.0175 = 0.4487 2 j 0.039 B , P(B/A) = 0.008 = 0.2051 3 j 0.039 Exercise 13.2 Two students S and S are asked to record scores in an examination.
Student 1 2 S 1 recorded 60% of the scores and student S recorded 40%.
It is found that 2 the error rates of the students S and S are 0.03 and 0.02 respectively.
What 1 2 is the probability that an error detected in the recording is committed by S or 1 S respectively.

It also teaches the meaning of independent and complimentary events.
Problems on joint probability are also taught.
There is also the application of Bayes theorem to solving of problems in probability.
5.0 Summary The unit reveals that P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A B) and that P(A/B) = P(P(A B) P(B) for P(B) ≠0 For complimentary events A and B, (P(A) = 1 - P(B) In the application of Bayes theorem the unit gives P(B/A) = P(A B) for j = 1, 2, ~ n) j j ∑ P(A/B)P(B) = 1, 2, ~ n. j j P(B /A) P (A B) j j ∑ P(A B) j NOUN 152  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 6.1 Two hunters A and B aim at a target.

You also learned the method of computing the probability of an event.
In unit 1 of module 1 of this course, you learned the meaning of a discrete random variable.
You leaned that a discrete random variable is a variable that can only assume whole numbers.
This unit will build on the techniques of calculating probability of an event you learned before by showing how to calculate probability under a more complicated situation.
2.0 Objectives By the end of this unit, you should be able to • Construct a probability distribution of a discrete random variable from raw data.
• Compute the mean and variance of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.
3.1 RELATIVE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION NOUN 154  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.1 Relative Frequency Distribution In unit 12, you learned about the various views of probability.
You learned that the relative frequency of a value of a variable is approximately equal to the probability of that value.
This is the relative frequency definition of probability.
In that unit 12 you also learned that the probability of an event, say X = x , is 1o given as P(x = x) and that 1 0< P(x = xl) < l. In the unit 12 we have made use of E and we gave that 0<P(E) < 1.
This is the first property of probability.
Also you learned that for events x x , x ---- x that are both mutually 1 2 3 n exclusive and collectively exhaustive, ∑ P(x= x ) = 1 1 For this unit the probability of a value of variable x, that is equal to x will be given as P(x, = x).
This should be noted throughout.
If x = 5 1 then we will give the probability as P (x = 5) Let us have a distribution of a 1 throws of a die The events in a die are, 1,2,3 4,5,6 Example 5.1 Suppose a die is thrown 20 times and the frequency distribution of the throw is shown below.
X F 1 l 1 2 2 2 3 4 4 6 5 4 6 2 The next thing to do is find the probability distribution of this discrete random variable.
The probability of 1, given as P (x = 1) = Frequency l = 2 = 0.10 1 Totalfrequency 20 NOUN 155  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I That of 2, P(x = 2) = 2 = 0.10 l 20 That of 4, P(x = 4) = 6 = 0.30 l 20 You have learned that the relative frequency of an event is approximately equal to the probability of the event.
The relative frequency distribution of the discrete random variable is given as follows: X F P(X – X ) 1 1 1 1 2 0.1 2 2 0.1 3 4 0.2 4 6 0.3 5 4 0.2 6 2 0.1 20 1.00 With this probability distribution obtained, we can make a number of probability statements.
We can even generate a number of questions from the distribution.
For instance, what is the probability that a throw will give value of 3?
The answer is P(x = 3) = 4 = 0.2.
20 Another one is what is the probability of getting in a throw 4 or 5.
The answer is P(X = 4 or 5) This is equal to P(x = 4 ) + P( x = 5 ) = 0.3 + 0.2 (from table) = 0.5 Another question is what is the probability that the value of the throw will be more than 3.
The answer is P(x>4) = P(x = 4) + P(x = 5) + P(x = 6) = 0.3+0.2+0.1=0.6 NOUN 156  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1.2.
Cumulative Relation Frequency Distribution In view of the fact that the cumulative relative frequency distribution is important in computing the probabilities of some events, we will need to construct the cumulative relative frequency of the discrete random variable.
For a discrete random variable X the cumulative relative frequency of x is 1 given as is P(x < x ) for x = 0,1,2,----- n 1 1 hence P(x < 4) is equal to P(x = 0) + P(x = 1) + P(x = 2) + P(x = 3) + P(x = 4) For our example 5.1, the cumulative frequency is given as follow.
Cumulative Relative Frequency X F P(x = X ) 1 1 1 P(x < x ) 1 1 2 0.1 0.1 2 2 0.1 0.2 3 4 0.2 0.4 4 6 0.3 0.7 5 4 0.2 0.9 6 2 0.1 1.00 We can also make a number of probability statements on the cumulative relation frequency distribution.
The probability of a value that is at most 4 is given as P(x < 4) = 0.7 The probability of getting a value between 2 and 5 inclusive is given by P(x < 5) - P(x < 1) = 0.9-0.1 = 0.8 Or P(x=2)+P(x=3)+P(x=4)+P(x=5)=0.1+0.2+0.3+0.2=0.8 You will realize that we did not say that the probability is equal to P(x < 5) - P(x < 2).
Rather we say that it is P(x < 5) - P(x < 1) because the question state that the probability of 2 is inclusive.
3.2 Measures Of Probability Distribution NOUN 157  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.2.1 Mean of probability distribution of a discrete Random Variable.
The mean as a concept was introduced in Unit 5.
You learned that mean could be computed for both the population and the sample taken from the population.
This unit treats the concept in terms of probability distribution of a discrete random variable.
The mean of the probability distribution is the expected value of the random variable that has the specified distribution.
Here we will find the expected value of X which is E (X) = ∑ xi P(x =xi) Example 14.2 Using the table showing the frequency distribution of the values in a die thrown 20 times.
X f P(x = xi) X P(x < xi) 1 1 1 1 2 0.1 0.1 2 2 0.1 0.2 3 4 0.2 0.4 4 6 0.3 0.7 5 4 0.2 0.9 6 2 0.1 1.00 1.00 3.7 E(x)=1 x 0.1 +2 x 0.1 + 3 x 0.2 + 4 x 0.3 x 5 x 0.2 + 6 x 0.1 =0.1+0.2+0.6+1.2+1.2+1.0+0.6=3.7 You will also realize that X P(x = x) = X; x P(x = x) i i i The E(x) obtained is the mean.
If we compute it for population it is designated as µ Hence E(x) = µ NOUN 158  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Let us use the formula we used previously to compute the mean, that is µ = ∑fixi ∑.fi Therefore µ = 1x2 + 2x2 + 3x4 + 4x6 + 5x4 + 6x2 20 This is equal to 74 = 3.7 = E(x) 20 3.2.2 Variance of Probability Distribution of A Discrete Random Variable You also learned about variance when you studied measures of dispersion in unit 9 of this course.
This variance in this unit will involve that of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.
The variance is given as the mathematical expectation of (x - µ)2 which is equal to E(x -µ )2 = ∑(x - µ )2 P(x =x) l i i Example 14.3 Using the table in example 5.2, compute the variance for the distribution.
X f P(X = X) (x - µ) (xi - µ) (X µ) P(X = Xi) i i l i 2 i - 2 1 2 0.1 -2.7 7.29 0.79 2 2 0.1 -1.7 2.89 0.29 3 4 0.2 -0.7 0.49 0.098 4 6 0.3 0.3 0.09 0.027 5 4 0.2 1.3 1.69 0.338 6 2 0.1 2.3 5.29 0.529 Total 20 2.01 The variance of the distribution is 2.01 The computation appears tedious.
There is a short cut to it.
It is known that E (x - µ)2 = E(X)2 - [E(X)]2 We have computed E(x) before, hence we can easily obtain [E(xi)] 2 NOUN 159  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I What it remains is for us to compute E(x)2 .
This can be done as follows X f P(X - Xi) X X 2 P(X - Xi) i i i i 1 2 0.1 1 0.1 2 2 0.1 4 0.4 3 4 0.2 9 1.8 4 6 0.3 16 4.8 5 4 0.2 25 5.0 6 2 0.1 36 3.6 Total 15.7 The E(x)2 = ∑x 2 P(x = xi) = 15.7 Using E(x - µ)2 = E(X)2 - [E(X)]2 i The variance, E(x - µ)2 = 15.7 - 3.72 = 15.7 - 13.69 = 2.01 The result is the same when we calculated the variance using E(x - µ)2 = ∑(x - µ)2 P(x = X ) 1 Therefore Variance = E(x2) - (E(x))2 = E(x - µ)2 Student Assignment Exercise 14.1 Given the table below, X f i i 0 2 1 2 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 9 6 7 7 5 NOUN 160  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 8 4 9 2 10 1 (a) Prepare a probability distribution table for the data (b) Prepare a cumulative frequency curve (c) From the table prepared, estimate (i) P(3 < x < 8) (ii) P(x >5) (iii) P(x < 4) (d) Compute (i) E(x) (ii) E(x ) (iii) E (x - µ)2 2 4.0 Conclusion This unit has built more on the concepts and techniques of probability by showing the application of these concepts to the relative frequency of distribution of a discrete random variable.
The unit has also giver the means of computing mean and variance of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.
Future units will show more of the types of probability distributions both of discrete and continuous random variables.
5.0 Summary You learned in the unit that the relative frequency of an even x; is approximately equal to its probability, P(x = x), for a discrete random l variable.
The mean of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, which is the expected value of x given as E(x) is equal to ∑xi P(x = x).
You also l learned that the variance of the distribution, given as E(x- µ)2 is equal to l ∑ (x - µ)2 P(x = X ).
1 1 It is also discussed in the unit that ∑(x - µ) 2 = E(x2) - (E(x)2 and this is the variance of the distribution.

1.0 Introduction This unit treats Binomial distribution, which is one of the most widely used probability distributions in statistics.
Binomial distribution is a discrete random variable distribution in which one of the two possible mutually exclusive outcomes occurs in a trial or an experiment.
Binomial distribution is derived from a process called Bernoulli trial.
A Bernoulli trial results from experiment that has two possible mutually exclusive outcomes and one and only one of the outcomes can occur in a trial.
The unit will treat the properties of Binomial distribution, Binomial tables and measures of central tendency and dispersion in the distribution.
2.0 Objectives At the end of the unit you should be able to: • Know the definition and properties of Binomial distribution.
• Solve problems involving binomial distribution • Read Binomial Tables • Compute measures for a binomial distribution.
3.1 Definition and Properties of Binomial Distribution.
NOUN 164  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I A Binomial distribution is derived from a process known as a Bernoulli trial.
A Bernoulli trial is said to be trial of some process or experiment that can result into one of the two possible mutually exclusive events such as Male and Female Head and tail Present and absent Correct and incorrect Defective and not defective Acceptable or not acceptable When there is a sequence of the trials we have a process.
For instance a couple trying to have children, may decide to make five trials at births.
These trials will now constitute a process.
To achieve the process; the following conditions must be met (Daniel and Terrel, 1979).
(i) Each trial results in one of the two possible mutually exclusive outcomes.
We denote one of the two outcomes as a success and the other as a failure.
(ii) The probability of a success is arbitrarily denoted as P the probability of failure is 1 - P. which is denoted as q. q=1-porP+q=1 (iii) The trials are independent, that is the outcome of a trial does not affect the outcome of any other trial.
In binomial distribution, there are trials, say n, where n = 1,2,3,4 --------- N We also have success denoted as X where X = 0,1,2,3 -------------- N For instance if you want to have four children and you regard the birth of a male as a success then the value of success will be 0,1,2,3,4.
If there is no male it means there is 0 success.
If there are four males, there are 4 successes.
On the basis of this, for n trials we have 0,1,2,3,4 successes.
If it is possible to know the probability of a success, p, we can calculate the probability of Binomial distribution if we know the number of trials.
You shall know that if we have n trials where n = 1,2,3,4 --------- n, we can have X successes where x=0,1,2,3 - - - - n. Suppose probability of a success is P, that of failure will be 1-P.
Therefore the probability of X success will be ( ) n P(X = X ) = X P x qn-x 1 2 NOUN 165  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I This is the general formula for binomial distribution.
Previously in this course, you learned that ( ) n r n !
r!
(n - r)!
( ) n 5!
= 5x4x3!
=10 r 3!2!
3!x2x1 The formula is easy to learn.
If you know the number of trials n and number of successor ( ) n X, you see x and multiplying it by probability of success raised is number of successor and multiply the product by probability of failure raised to the number of failure.
If there are n trials and x successors number of failure will be (n -x) failure.
Example 15.1 Suppose it is known that the probability that a person in a profession will be at home in particular time of the day is 0.6 or 60%.
If a person calls on 5 persons in the profession at that particular time of the day, what is the probability of getting 2 of them at home?
Here number of trials is 5 = n Number of successes is 2 = x Probability of successor is 0.6 = P. Probability of a failure is 1- 0.6 = 0.4 = q Number of failure is (5 - 2) = 3 Using the formula for calculating probability of binomial distribution p(x = 2) = 20.620.43 ( 2 = 5!
= 5!
= 5x4x3x2x1 =10 5 2!
(5 - 2)!

2xlx3x2x1 0.62 = 0.36 0.43 = 0.064 ( ) 5 p(x = 2) = 2 0.620.4 = l0 x 0.36 x 0.064 = 0.2304 NOUN 166  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Let us now solve the problem graphically.
There are 5 trials and 2 successes.
Let S represent success and frequency a failure.
We can have the possible arrangements for the 2 successes.
This is equal to ( ) 5 2 5!
= 5!
= 5x4x3x2x1 = 10 2!
(5 - 2) 2!3!
2xlx3x2x1 We will then have the following possible arrangements.
The first arrangement is SSFFF.
The joint probability of this, if probability of success P and that of failure is q, is Pxpxgxq=p2 g3.
The whole arrangement will be Possible Numbers of Arrangement Probability Arrangement 1 SSFFF Pxpxqxqxq=p2 q3 2 SFSFF Pxqxpxqxq= p2 q3 3 SFFSF Pxqxqxpxq= p2 q3 4 SFFFS Pxqxqxqxp= p2 q3 5 FFFSS qxqxqxpxp= p2 q3 6 FFSSF qxqxpxpxq= p2 q3 7 FSSFF qxpxpxgxq= p2 q3 8 FFSFS qxgxpxqxq= p2 q3 9 FSFFS qxpxqxqxp= p2 q3 10 FSFSF qxpxqxpxq= p2 q3 Total = 10 p2 q3 The total is 10p2g3= l0x0.62x0.46 = 0.2304 You will realize that we also obtain the same value as we obtained before.
For n trials, X success and P as probability of success, we can have probability distribution for the binomial distribution.
NOUN 167  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I For example if n=5,p=0.6, we can obtain probability values for 0,1,2,3,4, and 5 successes.
The sequence of this value constitutes the distribution of interest.
For n=5 and p=0.6, The probability distribution of the binomial distribution is given as Probability X = no of Success 0 0.01024 1 0.0768 2 0.2304 3 0.3456 4 0.2592 5 0.07776 Total 1.00 With this distribution, we can make a lot of probability statements.
For instance, what is the probability of meeting more than two of the persons at home at that particular time of the day?
P(x>2) =P(x=3)+P(x=4)+P(x=5) =0.3456 x 0.2592 x 0.07776 NOUN 168  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I =0.68256 Let us solve another, What is the probability of getting at least a person at home?
P (at least a person) = P(x=1) + p(x=2) + P(x=3) + P(x=4) + P(x=5) =1- P(x = 0) =1-0.01024 =0.98976 You should know that when we obtain probability distribution for all possible success, the sum of the probabilities is equal to 1.00 Student Assessment Exercise 15.1 Suppose the probability that a family will have a male child is given as 0.4.
If a couple in the family decides to have five births, what is the probability of having?
(1) 3 male births (ii) Less than 3 male births (iii) More than three male births (iv) At least a male birth (v) At most 4 male births [prepare the probability distribution table first] 3.2 Binomial Tables Binomial tables are used to solve problems involving probability of success.
It is very useful when the number of trials is large, say 20.
Calculation of probabilities using mere calculator may be time consuming hence the use of binomial tables.
In the textbooks, there are three types of the table namely (i) Tables of individuals probabilities (ii) Cummulative binomial table (px < xi) (ii) Cummulative binomial; probability For the purpose of this course, we will restrict ourselves to the most commonly used distraction, - that is the cumulative binomial probability distribution table [p(x >xl)] 3.2.1 Cummulative Binomial Probability Distribution Table [p(x >_ xl)] NOUN 169  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I For this table we need to know the values of n and p. having known this we will locate the table of interest for the question being solved.
In the table, for any x, the probability of x > x is given.
For example, if we l have five trials that is n=5 and the p=0.4, we will locate the table of n=5, p=0.4.
We are expected to have 0,1,2,3,4,5 successes when we have 5 trials.
In the table we will have probabilities against x=1,2,3,4 and 5, that of 0 is not given.
The value against 0 is 1.00 for all values of n and p. For x=1, the value of probability against 1 is that of p(x > 1) which is p(x =1) + p(x = 2) + p(x = 3) + p(x = 4) + p(x = 5) The value against 4 is p(x > 4) Which is p (x = 4) + p (x = 5) the value against 3 is p (x > 3) which is p(x = 3) + p(x = 4) + p(x = 5) You need to understand all these before you can apply the table.
You should note that the value against 0 is not given but it is 1.00. this is p(x > 0) = 1= p(x = 0) + p(x = 1) + p(x = 3) + p( x = 4) + p(x = 5) Example 15.2 Solve the problems in exercise 1 with the use of table if p=0.5 n=5, p=0.5 (i) p(x = 3) = p(x > 3) - p(x > 4) = 0.5000 - 0.1875 = 0.3125 Note that p(x >3) = p(x = 3) + p(x = 4) + p (x=5) p(x > 4) = p(x = 4) + p(x = 5) .
; p(x=3)= p(x>3)-p(x>4) = p(x=3) + p(x=4) + p(x=5) - p(x=4) - p(x=5) = p(x = 3) (ii) Less than three births = p(x < 3) p(x<3) = p(x = 0) + p(x = 1) + p(x = 2) = 1- p(x >- 3) since p(x=0)+p(x=1)+p(x=2)+p(x=3)+p(x=4)+(x=5)=1 p(x < 3) =1- p(x >- 3) =1 - 0.5000 = 5000 (iii) More than 3 male birth p(x >3) = p(x = 4) + p(x=5) = p(x>4) p(x > 4) =.1875 (iv) At least a male birth p(x >1)= p(x =1) + p(x = 2)+p(x = 3)+p(x = 4) + p(x=5) p(x >1) =.9688 NOUN 170  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (v) At most 4 male births p(x < 4) = p(x = 0) + p(x = 1) + p(x = 2) + p(x=3) + p(x = 4) =1-p(x>5) 1-0.0312 = 0.9688 Student Assessment Exercise 15.2 Suppose a binomial distribution is defined by n=20 and P=0.3 What is the probability of getting?
(1) Exactly 15 successes (ii) More than 15 successes (iii) Between 5 and 11 successes (iv) Less than 6 successes (v) At least a success.
3.3 MEASURES OF BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION 3.1.1 Mean The mean of a binomial distribution is given as n x p, that is the number of trials multiplied by the probability of success For n = 5 and p = 0.4 The mean = 5 x 0.4 = 2.0 Variance = 5x0.4 x 0.6=1.2 3.1.1 Variance The variance of a binomial distribution is given as n p q where n is number of trials, p is probability of a success and q=1-p is probability of a failure.
If n=5, p=0.4, q will be 1-0.4=0.6 4.0 Conclusion This unit treats a binomial distribution as a distribution in which one of the two possible mutually exclusive outcomes must occur in a trial that is derived from Bernoulli, process.
The units teaches the computation of probability of successes given x=number of, successes, given n= number of trials and p= probability of success.
It also introduces you to the use of binomial table and computation of measures for binomial distribution.
5.0 Summary NOUN 171  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The binomial distribution is said to be derived from Bernoulli trial in which one of the two possible mutually exclusive outcomes such as present and absent, correct and incorrect will occur in a trial.
The unit gives the properties of a binomial distribution.
It also gives that for n trials and p as probability of a success, (1-p) is the probability of a failure, and the probability of x success is given as Binomial table is also explained to solve problems involving binomial distribution.
The mean and the variance of binomial distribution are given as np and npq respectively.

2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you will be able to: • Explain Poisson distribution • Compute probabilities involving Poisson process • Use Poisson tables • Use Poisson Distribution as an approximation of a binomial distribution 3.1 DEFINITION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF POISSON Distribution 3.1.1 Definition NOUN 174  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Poisson distribution is used in many areas of the business especially when we are interested in reducing the waiting time on the queue at the petrol station, cafeteria etc.
Some of the areas in which Poisson distribution has found application are: (1) Arrival pattern of students at a location of water tap.
(ii) Arrival pattern of cars at a petrol station or of customers at a restaurant (iii) Typographical errors in a book (v) Demand for a product.
3.2 Poisson Process In Poisson distribution, there is said to be random occurrences of some event, and that this is brought about by the Poisson process.
Daniel and Terrel (1979) gave the characteristics of this process as follows: 1.
The occurrences of the event are independent, that is occurrence of an event in an interval of space or time has no effect on the probability of a second occurrence of the event in the same or any other interval.
2.
Theoretically an infinite number of occurrences of the event must be possible in the interval.
3.
The probability of a single occurrence of the event in a given interval is proportional to the length of the interval.
4.
In any infinitesimally small portion of the interval, the probability of more than one occurrence of the event is negligible.
Another very interesting characteristic of Poisson distribution is that the mean and variance are both equal to .
NOUN 175  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.2 Poisson Table Before you can solve any question on Poisson distribution, you need to understand the use of a Poisson Distribution Table.
The table you will be using is that of cumulative Poisson Distribution.
It is defined as P(X > X; / λ) This is to say that for probability value against any x; we have P(x > x ) for a i given .
For example, for value of x = 5 we will have a probability value showing P(x > 5) = P(x =5)+P(x=6)+P(x=7)...................... For x = 1, the probability value against it is: P(x >_) = P(x = 1) + P(x = 2), P(x = 3).
…………….. Before you can use a cumulative Poisson Distribution table, you need to recognise the value of λ and then locate where the value is on the table.
You also need to note that all probability values are given for x in such a way that the value shows P(x > x), for the table.
Let us now solve problems involving i Poisson Distribution by using the table of cumulative Poisson Distribution.
Example 7.1 Suppose the number of guests entering into Klass Restaurant is Poisson distributed and the average number of the guests entering into the restaurant in an hour is 10, what is the probability that in a given hour: (i) 2 guests enter the restaurant (ü) Exactly 7 guests enter the restaurant (iii) More than 8 guests enter the restaurant (iv) Less than 9 guests enter the restaurant (v) Between 6 and 12 guests inclusive enter the restaurant?
For this example = 10 We locate the table showing = 10 (i) Probability that 2 guests enter the restaurant is given as f(x = 2) f(x = 7) = p(x > 2) – p(x > 3) =1.0 - 0.997 = 0.003 (ii) Exactly 7 guests enter the restaurant f(x = 7) p(x > 7) -= P(x > 8) = 0.870 - 0.780 = 0.090 NOUN 176  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (iii) More than 8 guests enter the restaurant f(x=8) = P(x>8)- P(x>9) = 0.667 (iv) Less than 9 guests enter the restaurant f(x < 9) = 1 - P(x > 9 ) = 1 - 0.667 = 0.333 (v) Between 6 and 12 guests enter the restaurant (That is 6,7,8,9,10,11, or 12 guests enter the restaurant) f (6< x< 12) = P(X > 6) - P(X >-13) = 0.933 - 0.208 = 0.725 Student Assessment Exercise 16.1 Suppose the number of persons per car arriving at the entrance of a Tourist Centre is Poisson Distributed with = 5.8, what is the probability that a car arriving at the entrance contains: (i) No persons?
(ii) At least a person?
(iii) More than 10 people?
(iv) Between 5 persons and 10 persons inclusive?
(v) Less than 3 persons?
3.3 Poisson Distribution as An Approximation to Binomial Distribution Poisson distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution when n number of trials is large and p = probability of success is small.
Here = np = µ np was given in unit 15 as equal to the mean of binomial distribution.
How do we know when n is large and p is small?
Generally it is accepted that for n to be large here n must be greater than or equal to 20, that is n > 20.
For p to "be small, it must be less than or equal to 0.05, that is p < 0.05.
To show this approximation, we shall give a question involving binomial distribution with n very large and p very small.
We will answer it using NOUN 177  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I concepts of binomial distribution and Poisson distribution and compare the results.
Example 16.2 If n = 25 and p = 0.02, for a binomial distribution, find: (i) P(x = 1) (ii) p(x > 2) and (iii) p(x <3 ) Let us use binomial concept first.
When n = 25, P = 0.02 (i) P(x=1) = p(x>1) - p(x >2) = 0.3965-0.886 = 0.3079 (ii) P(x≥2) = 0.0886 (iii) P(x >3) = 1 - p(x > 3) = 1-0.0132 = 0.9868 Let us now use Poisson Distribution.
Since n = 25 is considered to be large (n > 20) and P = 0.02 is small (P < 0.05) then we can approximate the binomial distribution with Poisson distribution.
= np = 25 x 0.02 = 0.5 We locate the table for λ = 0.5 (i) f(x = 1) = 0.393 - 0.090 = 0.303 (ii) f(x > 2) = 0.090 (iii) f(x<3) = 1 - f (x > 3 ) = 1 -014 = 0.986 If you compare the corresponding values, you will realize that the Poisson distribution can actually approximate binomial distribution when n is large n > 20 and p is small p < 0.05.
Student Assessment Exercise 16.2 Suppose for a binomial distribution n = 100 and p = 0.02, using Poisson distribution as an approximate of binomial distribution, calculate: (i) P(x = 4) (ii) P(x < 6 ) (iii) P(> 4 ) (iv) P(3< x < 7 ) 4.0 Conclusion NOUN 178  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I In this unit, you learned that the Poisson distribution is a distribution of a discrete random variable, which is widely used in business.
You also learned the characteristics of a Poisson process.
The unit gave a Poisson function f(x) as f(x) = P(x = x) = l The unit taught the use of a Poisson distribution table p(x > x; / λ) and also showed Poisson distribution as an approximation to the binomial distribution when n > 20 and p< 0.05.
5.0 Summary The unit gave the probability function x = f(x) as: f (x) = Where x = 0, 1, 2.
.....................
The unit also gave the characteristics of Poisson distribution and taught the use of cumulative Poisson distribution table p(x > x; / ).
In the use of Poisson distribution as approximation to binomial distribution, when n >20, that is large and when p< 0.05. that is small; is given as np, the mean of binomial distribution.

UNIT 17 NOUN 180  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I THE HYPERGEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTION Table Of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Nature of Hypergeometric Distribution 3.2 Solution Of Problems Involving Hypergeometric Distribution 3.2.1 Use Of Tree Diagram 3.2.2 Use Of Formula 3.3 Measure Of Hypergeometric Distribution 3.3.1 Mean 3.3.2 Variance 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutored Marked Assignments 7.0 Reference And Other Resources 1.0 Introduction In unit 15, Binominal distribution was discussed.
The assumption made in binomial distribution is that the probability of a success, P must be constant for all trials.
This assumption can hold where there is infinite population that is sampled or when a finite population is sampled with replacement.
In practice, replacement of elements is not done.
This will then create problem with analysis of binomial distribution of finite population when replacement is not done.
The hyper geometric distribution then solves the problem of unequal value of probability of success, p, that may occur when sampling finite population without replacement.
This unit therefore treats the nature of hypergeometric function, solving of problems involving hypergeometric distribution and computation of measures for hypergeometric distribution.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to • Explain the concept of hypergeometric distribution • Solve problems involving hypergeometric distribution • Compute measures for hypergeometric distribution.
3.1 Nature of Hypergeometrc Distribution As previously said in this unit, the binominal distribution assumes a constant probability of success; p, therefore for a distribution this assumption does not NOUN 181  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I have problem if the population sampled is an infinite one.
However, if the population sampled is finite, P will not remain constant for every successive drawings of elements made, when the sampling is without replacement.
For instance if we have in a basket two types of balls, yellow and blue balls.
They are 20 altogether.
Suppose 12 of the balls are yellow and 8 of them are blue.
If two balls are to be drawn successfully, the probability that the first ball will be yellow is 12 .
If the first ball is taken away and it is yellow, there 20 will remain 11 yellow balls and 8 blue balls.
If the second ball is also yellow the probability of getting a second ball that is yellow is 11 19 If the first ball is blue, and the second ball is yellow, the probability of getting yellow as the second ball will be 12.
Both 11 and 12 are never equal to 12 , 19 19 19 20 the probability that the first ball is yellow.
With this in mind the assumption made for binomial distribution may not be valid for finite population except sampling is done with replacement.
Sampling with replacement is not practical with many real life situations, especially when investigation requires the destruction of elements.
To solve the problem identified above with binomial distribution when it comes to sampling finite population without replacement, we make use of hypergeometric distribution model.
hypergeometric model is used in situations where we wish to determine the probability of a given number of success or failures.
3.2 Solution Of Problems Involving Hypergeometrie Distribution 3.2.1 Use Of Tree Diagrams This is one of the ways to solve problems involving hyper geometric distribution.
Let us illustrate the use of the tree diagram to a problem.
Example 8.1 There are twelve bottles of brand of beer in a carton.
The carton contains 2 defective bottles and 10 not defective ones.
If we select three bottles of the beer at random from the cartons, what is the probability that the sample contains exactly (1) 0 defective bottles (2) 1 defective bottle (3) 2 defective bottles?
Let us use a tree diagram for this.
We start by denoting defective by D and not defective by N. We will all put the successive probability of selecting the defective or not defective one in bracket.
We will start with NOUN 182  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 2D and 1ON.
If the first bottle is defective we have P(D) = 2 , if the second 12 after this is D, the probability becomes 1 and so on 11 Fig 8.1 Tree diagram showing example 8.1 From the above tree diagram, we can identify the following arrangements with their probabilities.
DNN = 2 X 10 X 9 = 0.1365 12 11 10 NDD = 10 X 9 X 2 = 0.1365 12 11 10 NNN = 10 X 9 X 8 = 0.5455 12 11 10 NOUN 183  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I NDN = 10 X 2 X 9 = 0.1364 12 11 10 NDD = 10 X 2 X 1 = 0.0152 12 11 10 We have now obtained the distribution let us answer the questions now (1) For O detective, we have NNN, that all of them are not defective.
The required probability is 0.5455.
(2) For 1 defective, we have DNN = 0.1365 NND = 0.1365 NDN = 0.1365 TOTAL = 0.4092 For 2 defectives, We have DDN = 0.0152 NNN =0.0152 TOTAL = 0.0456 3.2.2 Use Of Formula Another way of solving problems involving hypergeometric distribution is by using formula Daniel and Terrel (1999) stated that if from a population of size N consisting of N elements of one type (successes) and N element of another type 1 2 (failure), select at random without replacement a sample of size n, determine the probability P(X) that the sample will contain x successes.
The formula for P(X) under these conditions is given as: NOUN 184  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I For our example, N, =2, N =10 N= N +N =12, n=3, x = 0, 1, 2,- - - - 2 1 2 (i) For 0 defective (ii) For x = 1 (iii) For x = 2 NOUN 185  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I A comparison of the values obtained when we used the tree diagram with the values obtained when we used formula will show that the corresponding values are equal 3.3 Measure Of Hypergeometric Distribution 3.31 Mean The mean of a hypergeometric function is given as For example 8.1 the mean is 3 x 2 = 0.5 12 3.3.2 Variance the variance of a geometric distribution is given as For example, NOUN 186  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Student Assessment Exercise 17.1 It has been found that out of 100 cocoa beans, 4 are defective.
If four of the cocoa beans are selected, what is the probability that there are?
(i) No defective bean?
(ii) 1 defective bean?
(iii) 2 defective beans?
4.0 Conclusion In this unit, you have been thought how to overcome the problems encountered with the use of binomial distribution when sampling a finite population without replacement.
The hypergeometric distribution in which the probabilities of taking successive elements from a population changes helps to solve the problem of constant value of probability of a success assumed in binomial distribution.
The unit has also given how problems involving hypergeometric distribution can be solved using tree diagram and formula for computing the mean and variance of hypergeometric distribution.
5.0 Summary The unit teaches how the weakness of constant value of probability of a success in binominal distribution could be solved when sampling a finite population without replacement.
The unit also gives the probability function of a hypergeometric distribution as NOUN 187  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Future unit will discus probability distribution of a continuous random variable.

NOUN 188  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I UNIT 18 NORMAL DISTRIBUTION Table of Contents 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.1 Characteristics of the Normal Distribution 3.2 The standard Normal Distribution 3.3 Normal Curve Areas 3.4 Applications of the Normal Distribution 3.5 The Normal Approximation to the Binomial 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment 7.0 References and other Resources 1.0 Introduction In the last three units before this unit, you learned the probability distributions of discrete random variable - the Binomial, the Poisson and the Hyper-geometric Distributions.
Before you learned those units, you have learned that discrete variables are characterized by `interruptions' between one value and the other.
These `interruptions' are absent in distributions of continuous random variables.
One of the distributions of the continuous random variables is the normal distribution, a distribution that is of most important in statistics.
In this unit, you will learn this important probability distribution of continuous random variable and some of its applications.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • List the characteristics of the Normal Distribution • Explain the use of the standard normal distribution • Read the areas under the curve of a normally distributed population using the normal curve areas • Transform X values to Z values • Use normal distribution model to calculate probabilities for continuous random variable.
NOUN 189  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 3.1 Characteristics of the Normal Distribution This is the most important distribution in statistics.
The distribution is defined by the normal density function given by: Where π is 3.14159 and e = 2.71828; δ is the population standard deviation.
µ = Population mean.
A normal distribution is determined by the values of δ and µ, the standard deviation and mean of the population respectively.
Any change in either δ or µ changes the distribution.
The characteristics of a normal distribution are as follows: (i) The graph of the normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve.
(ii) The distribution is symmetrical above its mean µ.
The curve on the either side of the mean is a mirror image of the other side.
NOUN 190  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (iii) The mean, the median and the mode are all equal.
(iv) The total area under the curve above x-axis is equal to l. This means that 50% of the area is to the left of the mean and the other 50% to the right of the mean.
(v) The area enclosed by µ ±_δ is 68% of the total area.
This is to say that 68% of the area is between 1 standard deviation from the mean in both directions.
95% of the area under the curve is enclosed between 2 standard deviations from the mean in both directions.
NOUN 191  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Also 99.7% of the area lies between 3 standard deviations from the mean in both directions.
These are the characteristics of the normal distributions that will still be of serious use in the other courses that you may encounter in this programme.
3.2 The Standard Normal Distribution The Normal Distribution, as already said is determined by the values of its δ and µ.
Any change in the values of either δ or µ will give another normal distribution curve.
In view of this, there is a need to have a standard normal distribution that is determined by a mean of O and a standard deviation of 1.
With this, the X-axis in the normal distribution changes to Z- axis in the standard normal distribution.
3.3 Normal Curve Areas NOUN 192  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Now that the values of X in normal distribution has been transformed to values of Z in standard normal distribution, we still need to find the area under the curve for a given value of Z for this, we use the Normal Curve Areas.
In finding the area under the curve for a value of Z, we get the area between O and that given value of Z = P (0< Z< Zι).
For instance if we are looking for area under the curve when Z = 2.5.
The area will be P (0< Z < 2.5).
We will read the area from the table of normal curve areas as follows; we look at the column for Z and get the value of 2.5 under.00.
This is 0.4938.
If the value of Z = 0.55, we will check Z = 0.5under 0.05.
This is equal to 0.2088.
For Z = 1.43, we look at the column 1.4 under 0.03.
This is 0.4236.
For Z = 1.435, this cannot be easily read from the table.
We will observe that 1.435 is equidistant from 1.43 and 1.44.
Indeed it is the mean of the two.
To find this probability value for Z = 1.435, look at: Z = 1.43 = 0.4236 Z = 1.44 = 0.4251 We add up = 0.8487 We divide by 2 = 0.4244 The area for Z = 1.435 is equal to 0.4244.
Let us now apply the use of table to solving some problems.
Example 18.1 For a distribution, that is normal distribution, what is the probability the a Z picked as random from the population of Z's will have a value (i) Z = 2.3 (ii) Z < 2.3 (iii) Z = -1.75 (iv) 1.75 < Z< 1.85 You need to know that the value of Z = 1.75 is equal to value of Z = -1.75 The sign does not affect the value of the area covered by the value of Z.
Solution (i) NOUN 193  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I The area of interest is P (O < Z < 2.5) from the table, for Z = 2.3, the area is 0.4893.
(ii) Z = 2.3 There are two areas involved here, the one to the right of the mean and the one to the left of the mean this is half of the area under the curve and is 0.5.
The area to the left is P 0 < z < 2.3which is equal to 0.4893 we obtained before.
The required area is 0.5 + 0.4893 = 0.9893.
(ii) z = -1.75 NOUN 194  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Area = P(-1.75< < 0) = 0.4599 Z (iv) -1.75 < Z<1.85 Area A = P(-1.75< Z< 0) = 0.4599 Area B = P(0 < Z< 1.75) = 0.4678 Total Area = 0.9277 (v) 1.75<Z< 1.85 NOUN 195  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I From 0 to Z = 1.85, the area is: = P(0 < Z < 1.85) = 0.4678 Similarly P(0 < Z< 1.75) = 0.4599 Required Area = 0.0079 In question (iv) the two values of Z are on different sides of the mean, hence we add up their areas to obtain the required area.
In question (v) the two values of Z are on the same side of the mean hence we subtract the value of the area of the smaller Z from that of the larger Z to get the required area.
3.4 The Applications of the Normal Distribution The normal distribution is a very important distribution in Statistics especially when we will treat statistical inference in other statistics courses.
The distribution is an ideal one since it is not possible to have a population of measurements that is normally distributed.
However, if the population of measurements is approximately normally distributed with a known value of σ, standard deviation and a known value of µ, mean, then we can transform the measurements in X to the standard value in Z, since we have standard normal distribution as follows: Z = x - µ δ Where x = is the x measurement µ = Population mean = Population standard deviation.
Having known the standard value of Z, we can obtain the area covered by that value of x that gives the standard value of Z on the table of normal curve areas.
Let us illustrate this with an example Example of 18.2 Suppose the population of the weights of cubes of a seasoning agent is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 20 gm and a standard deviation of 1.50m.
What is the probability that a cube selected at random from the population has a weight of: NOUN 196  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (i) 20.5 gms (ii) Less than 20.5 gms (iii) More than 21 gms (iv) Between 19.5 and 20 gms (i) X = 20.5 gm Required probability = P(0<Z<0.33) = 0.1293 (ii) X less than 20.5 Z - 20.5 - 20 = 0.33 1.5 P(0 < Z < 0.33) = 0.1293 The required probability = 0.5 + 0.1293 = 0.6293 NOUN 197  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I (iii) More than 21 We will first calculate the area between 20gms and 21gms as follows: Z = 21-20 = 0.67 1.5 P(0 < Z< 0.67) = 0.2486 The required probability = 0.5-0.2486 = 0.2514 (iv).
Between 19.5gm and 20.75gms Z = 19.5-20 = 0.33 1 1.5 Z = 20.75-20 = 0.50 2 1.5 P(0< Z< 0.33) = 0.1293 P(0 < Z< 0.5) = 0.1915 Required probability = 0.3208 NOUN 198  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Student Assessment Exercise 18.1 Suppose the ages of the pupils in a Primary School are normally distributed with a mean of 7.5 years and a standard deviation of 1.5years, what is the probability that a pupil selected at random has the age: (i) Of 9 years (ii) Between 6.75 years and 8.25 years (iii) Less than 6.75years (iv) More than 8.25 years.
3.5 The Normal Approximation to Binomial For binomial distribution, the table of cumulative Binomial probability distribution does not show values for n that is very large.
With this, it is difficult to estimate the probability of the values when n is large using binomial distribution.
This approximation of normal distribution to binomial distribution is only possible when n is large and p, probability of a success is not too close to 0 or 1.
The mean, µ will be equal to np.
The standard deviation a will be equal to √npq or √np(1- p) Let us illustrate this with an example.
Example 18.3 Suppose a binomial distribution is defined by n = 25 and p = 0.4, what is the probability of getting: (i) Exactly 7 successes (ii) Between 7 and 12 successes Use binomial distribution first and normal distribution again for the solution.
Compare the sets or values obtained in the two exercises.
Let us use binomial first.
Use the table of binomial distribution.
For n=25, P=0.4 P(x=7) = P(x > 7)-P(x > 8) = 0.9264 - 08464 NOUN 199  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I = 0.0800 (ii) For 7 < x < 12 P(7 <x<12)=P(x > 7)-P(x > 13) = 0.9264-0.1538 = 0.7726 Let us now use the normal distribution.
The binomial distribution is a distribution of a discrete variable while the normal distribution is a distribution of a continuous variable.
Before we can convert the value of x to z we need to introduce the continuity correction by subtracting 0.5 from the lower value and adding 0.5 to the higher value when we are considering an interval; say 7< x <12.
We will now have 6.5 < x < 12.5.
If we consider a point, say x = 7, we shall introduce the continuity correction by saying 7 is between 6.5 and 7.5 that is 7 ± 0.5 = 6.5, 7.5.
It is these values of X that we will convert to values of z.
For our example, For P(x=7), we have P(6.5< x<12.5) µ = np = 25x0.4 = 10 = √25x0.4(1- 0.4) = 2.45 For P(6.5<-x<-12.5) Z = 6.5 – 10 = 1.43 1 2.45 NOUN 200  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I Z = 7.5-10 = 1.02 2 2.45 P(- 1.43 < Z < 0) = 0.4236 P(4.02 < Z < 0) = 0.3465 Required area = 0.0771 For between 7 and 12 We will introduce the continuity correction, and obtain 6.5 < x <12.5 Z = 6.5 - 10 = -1.43 1 12.5 Z2 = 12.5-10 = -1.02 2.45 P(-1.43 < Z< 0) = 0.4236 P(-1.02< Z< 0) = 0.3465 Required Area = 0.7701 If you compare the values in binomial with the corresponding values in normal distribution; you will realize that they are very close.
For very large values of n when p is not too close to 0 or 1, we always omit the continuity correction, when finding probabilities associated with intervals such as P(x1 < x < x2 ).
Student Assessment Exercise 18.2 A binomial distribution is defined by n = 50 and p = 0.3, Using normal distribution find the probability of getting.
(i) More than 8 successes (ii) Between 10 and 20 successes.
NOUN 201  STA 101 BUSINESS STATISTICS I 4.0 Conclusion This unit treated the probability distribution of a continuous random variable - normal distribution.
It also treated the transformation of normal distribution to a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
The x values are transformed to 2 values as follows: Z = x - µ You learned the application of this to some problems.
You also learned normal approximation to binomial distribution when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1.
5.0 Summary You learned in this unit, the last unit of this course about the distribution of continuous random variable given as normal distribution.
You also learned the transformation of normal distribution to standard normal distribution.
Some problems involving normal distributions were solved and some were given as student Assessment Exercise.
This distribution you have just learnt will find more useful application in Business Statistics course to follow 6.0 Tutor Marked Assignment The weights of packages of a particular drug item are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 30gms and a standard deviation of 2.5gms.
