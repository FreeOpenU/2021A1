MODULE 1 Unit 1 The Trial Balance Unit 2 Trading, Profit and Loss Account Unit 3 The Balance Sheet Unit 4 Adjustments in the Final Accounts Unit 5 Depreciation of Fixed Assets Unit 6 Manufacturing Accounts UNIT 1 THE TRIAL BALANCE CONTENTS 1.0Introduction 2.0Objectives 3.0Main Content 3.1Definition of Trial Balance 3.2Uses of Trial Balance 3.3Rules of The Trial Balance 3.4Format of Trial Balance 4.0Conclusion 5.0Summary 6.0Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING After the ledger has been prepared, the balances brought down are used to prepare a statement called a “Trial Balance.
Assets are usually entered on the debit side of an account, and the liabilities on the credit side, it is expected that the total of the debits would equal the total of the credits.
This is true because the total assets are equal to the liabilities plus the capital (L + C = A).
Also, each subsequent transaction involved one entry on the debit side, and an equal entry on the credit side.
It follows that the total debit entries are still equal to the total credit entries provided no mistake has been made.
It is impossible to guarantee that no mistake will ever be made.
Therefore, as soon as all transactions are double- entered in the accounts, it is usual to make a preliminary check upon the accuracy of the entries by taking out a “Trial Balance” to see if the total of all debit entries is equal to that of all the credit entries in each.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define a Trial Balance • extract the Trial Balance • discuss Rules of a Trial Balance.
3.0MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition Trial Balance can be defined as a schedule or list that shows the debit and credit balances extracted from the ledgers, to show the arithmetical accuracy of the ledgers.
The technique ensures that debit and credit balances as displayed in the ledgers are compiled (Longe & Kazeem, 2006: 68).
The objective of the Trial Balance is to prove the accuracy of the book- keeping.
All the ledger accounts must be balanced off and entered in the Trial Balance.
3.2 Uses of Trial Balance The main uses of the trial balance are: a.
It helps in testing the accuracy of the double entry; b.
Helps in the preparation of financial statements; c. Assist in detecting errors of posting that can easily be identified by the trial balance.
3.3 Rules of the Trial Balance 2ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING In preparing or extracting a Trial Balance from a list of extracted balances, the following items are recorded: • Capital or Share Capital, including retained profits, should be entered in the credit column of the trial balance; • Drawings, including accumulated losses, should be entered in the debit side of the trial balance; • All assets, both fixed and current, should be entered in the debit column of the trial balance; • All expenses, including purchases and stationery, should be entered in the debit column of the trial balance; • All liabilities, including debentures, should be entered in the credit column of the trial balance; • All reserves and provisions, including depreciation, should be entered in the credit column of the trial balance; • All revenue, including sales and bad debt recovered, should be entered in the credit column of the trial balance.
3.4 Format of Trial Balance The format of the trial balance is given below.
It has columns for particulars, debit and credit sides.
Because of the principle adopted, it must balance.

Preparation of simple final accounts of a sole trader covers the preparation of the trading, profit and loss account and the balance sheet.
In this study unit, the final accounts of a trader who deals in the buying and selling of goods are discussed.
The final account of a sole trader who is involved in the manufacturing of products is discussed in the next unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the trading, profit and loss account and the balance sheet • identify items that will appear in the trading, profit and loss account and the balance sheet • make adjustments before preparing the trading, profit and loss account • prepare a trading and profit and loss account and the balance sheet.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Trading Account The main objective of preparing the trading account is to determine the gross profit or gross loss for the period.
It is also in this account that the cost of obtaining the goods (cost of goods sold or cost of sales) is calculated.
It is usually prepared to conform to the rules of double entry.
Since it contains the results of operation of a business over a period, the heading should be Trading, Profit and Loss Account for the Year Ended……...
The account looks at the difference between the sales and the cost of goods sold.
It is a revenue account which follows the double entry principle.
On the debit side are recorded stocks at the beginning, purchases less returns outwards and the closing stocks deducting from the cost of goods available for sales.
On the credit side are recorded sales less return inwards.
The difference between the cost of goods and 14ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING net sales is the gross profit.
The “T– Method” and “Vertical Method” are respectively shown below: TRADING ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2009 N N Opening Stock X Sales X Add Purchases X Less Returns Inwards X Add Carriage Inwards X Net Sales X X Less Returns outwards X X Less goods withdrawn for own use X Cost of goods available for sale X Less closing stock X Cost of goods sold X Gross profit X X X TRADING ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2009 N N Opening Stock X Sales X Add Purchases X Less Returns Inwards X Add Carriage Inwards X Net Sales X X Less Returns outwards X X Less goods withdrawn for own use X Cost of goods available for sale X Less closing stock X Cost of goods sold X Gross profit X X X 15ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Among the two formats above, ‘Vertical method’ is more preferable.
3.2 Definition of Technical Terms (i) Purchases: These are goods bought for resale.
It is the sum total of cash and credit purchases.
It however, excludes purchases of fixed assets.
(ii) Sales: This is the addition of cash and credit sales during the trading period.
Sales exclude the sale of fixed assets.
(iii) Opening Stocks: These are the stock of goods for sale at the beginning of the accounting year.
(iv) Closing Stocks: These are the balance of the stock of goods available for sale at the end of the trading period.
(v) Returns Outwards: These are goods returned to the suppliers of such goods as a result of the goods either being not to specification, damaged, obsolete, late delivery, and some other genuine reasons.
Returns outwards must be deducted from purchases of the period.
(vi) Returns Inwards: These are goods returned by customers of a trading concern.
For example, goods below standard, wrong goods supplied to customers, inability of organization to meet with the terms of the supply, etc.
This must be deducted from sales for the period.
(vii) Carriage Inward: This is the cost of transporting goods into the company.
This must be added to the cost of purchases as it is incurred in order to bring the goods into a condition that is necessary for its sale.
Hence, it is charged to the trading account.
(viii) Carriage Outwards: This is the cost of transporting goods to customers.
That is, the cost of transport that a trading concern incurs in moving goods meant for resale out of a firm.
Carriage outwards is a profit and loss account item and for that reason is not included in the calculation of gross profit in the trading account.
It is seen as expenses on sales and as a result is debited in the profit and loss account.
(ix) Cost of Goods Available for Sale: This figure is derived by adding the opening sock and purchases.
16ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (x) Cost of Goods Sold or Cost of Sales: This represents the cost of the goods that were actually sold.
It is arrived at by deducting closing stocks from the cost of goods available for sales.
(xi) Gross Profit: This is the excess of sales (less returns) over the cost of goods sold.
This could also be defined as profit before expenses are deducted.
(xii) Net Profit: This is the profit figure arrived at after deducting all expenses incurred during the trading period.
(xiii) Goods Withdrawn for Own Use: The use of products or goods by a proprietor is usually termed stock drawings.
The goods withdrawn by the owner of the business is deducted from the purchases in the trading account.
In the balance sheet, it must be added to drawings.
(xiv) Goods Stolen or Destroyed: This is deducted from cost of goods available for sale or purchases and posted to the expenses side of the profit and loss account.
That is: Dr : Profit and Loss A/c Cr : Purchases Account.
3.3 The Profit and Loss Account The main function of the profit and loss account is to determine the net profit or net loss resulting from the trading operations of the accounting period.
Incomes or gains are credited, while expenses are debited.
The gross loss (if any) from the Trading Account is debited while gross profit (if any) from the Trading Account for the period is credited.
The net profit or loss from this account will be taken to the capital account.
3.3.1 Profit and Loss Format The profit and loss account will appear thus: N N Expenses Gross Profit b/d X Wages and Salaries X Discounts received X Telephone X Bank Interest received X Bad Debts X Reduction in provision for X bad debts Increase in provision for bad X Commission Received X debts Motor expenses X Profit on sale of assets X 17ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Stationery X Recovery of bad debts X Bank charges X Rents X Loss on sale of assets X Advertising X Lighting and heating X Repairs X Postages X Rent X Rates X Discount allowed X Depreciation X Directors Fee X Travelling expenses X Carriage outwards X Loss by fire X Loss by defalcations X Personal income tax X Net Profit X XX XX The vertical format can also be used for the presentation of the profit and loss account as can be seen under: PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT N N Gross Profit X Add other incomes (e.g.
investment income, X miscellaneous incomes) X Less Expenses: Establishment charges (e.g.
rent, rates, lighting and X heating, etc) Administration expenses (e.g.

It must be prepared with the trading account.
Also note that Net profit is 18ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING usually added to capital in the balance sheet and Net loss deducted from capital.
3.3.1 Procedure for Preparing the Trading, Profit and Loss Account (a) Record revenue earned as sales on the credit side less returns inwards.
(b) Compute cost of sales by adding opening stock to purchases and deducting closing inventory.
(c) The cost of goods is deducted from sales to get the intermediate or the gross profit.
(d) Deduct operating expenses from gross profit to determine the net income or net profit or net loss.

These include the balance sheet, showing the firm’s condition on the last day of the accounting period, among others.
This study unit discusses the balance sheet, format of the balance sheet and components of the balance sheet.
2.0OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able: • define and explain the balance sheet • identify items that will appear in the balance sheet • prepare a balance sheet • make appropriate adjustments to the balance sheet.
3.0MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Balance Sheet Defined A balance sheet is the financial statement showing the assets, liabilities and owners’ equity of an enterprise on a specific date (Okwoli, 1993:94).
Lange and Kazeem (2006:162) defined the balance sheet as the statement that shows the presentation of the summary of assets and liabilities in a well arranged form, so that the financial position may be clearly ascertained.
The balance sheet is not an account; it is a statement showing the balance remaining in the books.
For instance, the balance sheet must be headed as ‘The balance sheet as at 31st December, 2008.
The balance sheet of a business just like a coin consists of two sides – the asset side and the liabilities and owners equity side.
All assets have sources represented by liabilities and equities.
Because all assets are financed by liabilities and owners equity, the two sides must balance- hence, the term balance sheet, and the balance sheet equation: Assets = Liabilities +Owners’ equity.
27ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The assets are usually set out in order of permanence or liquidity.
To comprehend the rules of balance sheet, the various components must be adequately analysed.
3.2 Components of the Balance Sheet 3.2.1 Assets 3.2.1.1 Fixed Assets These are tangible assets, which have a relatively long life (more than one year), are relatively fixed (in size, shape, or form), are permanent in nature and used by a business in its operation.
These assets are held with the main aim of earning or creating revenue and not for the purpose of sale in the normal course of business.
Examples of fixed assets are land, buildings, motor vehicles, office equipment, furniture and fittings, premises, etc.
The fact that the life of fixed assets extends over many accounting periods makes it necessary to allocate the cost of the asset to current and future operations on some rational basis.
This allocation is called depreciation.
Hence, fixed assets are generally valued at cost less provisions for accumulated depreciation that is sufficient to reduce the carrying or book value of the asset to its salvage or scrap value by the end of its useful working life.
3.2.1.2 Current Assets These are assets that are acquired and held for resale, and not as agents of production, but for the purpose of eventual conversion into cash (ATSWAt, 2009:218).
They are therefore not permanent in nature, but are continually changing in the ordinary course of business.
Examples are debtors, stock in-trade, bills receivable, cash in hand, cash at bank, prepaid expenses, marketable securities, etc.
that can easily be realized and are therefore readily available to discharge liabilities.
The same assets may be either fixed or current according to the nature of the business.
Thus, investments would be a current asset to a stock broker, but a fixed asset to an ordinary trader.
Similarly, machinery would be a fixed asset to an ordinary manufacturer, but a current asset to a machinery trading company.
It also depends on whether the asset is held merely for the purpose of sale, or is intended to be kept in the business.
3.2.1.3 Fictitious Assets 28ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING These are merely debit balances not written off, items of expenditure of unusual character which are not recoupable.
Examples are preliminary expenses, formation expenses, and losses which have been carried forward from one period to the next.
3.2.1.4 Intangible Assets These are assets that cannot be seen and touched, although they may have value (Garbutt, 1982:0213).
Examples of intangible assets are goodwill, patents, copyright, trademark, etc.
3.2.1.5 Liquid Assets These are cash or items such as debtors, marketable securities, etc, that can easily be converted into cash.
3.2.1.6 Wasting Assets These are fixed assets that depreciate through wear and tear, as for example, plant and machinery; those whose value expires with lapses of time, such as patents and leases; also those that become exhausted or consumed through being worked, such as mines, quarries, etc.
3.2.2 Liabilities These are obligations or indebtedness of a business enterprise to outsiders.
A liability is any amount, which a business is legally bound to pay.
It is a claim by an outsider on the assets of a business.
The best method of arranging liabilities in the case of an old trader is in order of permanence.
The usual groupings are as follows: • Long-term liabilities • Current or short-term liabilities.
3.2.2.1 Long Term Liabilities These are obligations that will mature in the future.
That is, not within the next accounting period.
Examples are Debentures, Long-term loans, and Mortgage loans.
3.2.2.2 Current or Short-term Liabilities 29ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING These are liabilities payable within a short period of time, usually within one year.
They are events that require the enterprise to pay money and provide goods or perform services, which are already due.
Examples are creditors, Bank overdraft, Short-term loans and accrued expenses, etc.
3.2.3 Capital Capital represents the contribution of the proprietor of a business to the assets that the firm has acquired.
That is, the owner’s interest in the assets of the business.
This is usually referred to as owner’s equity or proprietorship.
3.2.4 Working Capital This is the excess of the current assets over the current liabilities.
That is, current assets – current liabilities.
3.2.5 Capital Employed This is a total asset less current liabilities.
3.2.6 Overtrading This is a situation whereby a firm has no working capital.
The firm cannot meet its current liabilities and it may become bankrupt.
In this position, the firm is very vulnerable, and could be forced into bankruptcy if its creditors loss faith in its ability to pay.

(b) Outline the major components of a balance sheet.
4.0 CONCLUSION A balance sheet always show the business as being in a condition of equality: what it owns equals to what it owes to either its creditors or its owners.
This can be expressed in the form of as equation: Assets= Liabilities + owners equity.
This relationship does not of itself imply that the business is in a satisfactory financial condition as the equality may have been preserved by treating a loss as a fictitious asset or deducting it from the owners equity.

Other resources and obligations such as employee salaries originate as service is rendered, with payment to follow at specified dates.
The end of the accounting period generally does not coincide with the receipts or payments of cash associated with all the types of resource changes.
Adjusting entries are therefore, used to record such resource changes to ensure the accuracy of the financial statements.
This study unit considers some of the adjustments most commonly used in the preparation of the final accounts, also, the treatment of such adjustments in both the profit and loss account and the balance sheet.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain why adjusting entries are necessary • explain and pass entries in respect of provisions • explain and pass entries with respect to reserves • explain and pass entries in respect of accruals and prepayments • record increases and decreases in provisions and reserves • calculate and make entries with respect to discounts received or given • prepare profit and loss account and balance sheet showing the treatment of bad; debts, provision for doubtful debts, depreciation and provision for discount on debtors and creditors.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Provisions, Reserves, Accruals and Prepayments One of the basic tenets of accounting is that proper provision should be made for known losses, but no profit should be assumed until it has been realized.
In order to prevent higher profits than justified being assumed and then distributed to the owners of the business, entries in the revenue accounts should be made to reflect this conservative approach.
These fall into two main groups – the creation and maintenance of provisions and the creation and maintenance of reserves.
Provisions are debited to the profit and Loss account while reserves are debited to the Appropriation Account.
There has always existed some confusion as to the precise distinction between provisions and reserves, but the fact is that a provision means any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewals or diminution of assets 38ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING or retained by way of providing for any liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy.
While reserve shall include any amount written off or retained by providing for any known liability or any sum set aside for the purpose of it being used to prevent undue fluctuations in charges for taxation.
3.1.1 Provisions The most common reasons for creating provisions are to allow for expected losses, such as bad debts and to provide for depreciation.
The provision accounts should be designated with their purpose (for example, Provision for Depreciation, etc) and deducted in the balance sheet from the asset concerned.
Provision for Bad debts is created and maintained to recognize that it is unlikely for all the debtors to pay.
The method of deciding on the proportion varies from business to business.
Where there are a large number of relatively small value debtors, the easiest method is to fix the level of the provision for bad debts at a predetermined percentage of the total debtors figure.
As the debtors figure alters, so will the provision for bad debts, debiting or crediting the profit and loss account as appropriate.
The percentage figure chosen will be established in the light of experience, and will be based on the debtors figure after bad debts have been identified and transferred to the bad debts account.
Where the number of debtors is small but the amounts are large, the provision may be reached after reviewing each debtor in turn and deciding if there is any risk of loss.
Banks use this method for the larger borrowers.
It is important to appreciate that when a bad debt is incurred, it is usual to debit it to the Profit and Loss Account (via Bad Debts Account) and not the provision for Bad Debts Account.
At first thought this seems illogical but it should be remembered that the level of provision for bad debts have been excluded, and so it is consistent with the general policy of taking a conservative view of the state of the business.
In any event, from a purely mathematical standpoint, if the provision for Bad Debts Account were debited with bad debts, the amount of these would be reflected in the larger amount which would have been charged to the Profit and Loss Account to restore it to its proper level.

The reserve account is not of course a source of liquid funds but merely denotes the extent to which past profits have been left with the business to finance the various assets shown in the balance sheet.
3.1.2.1 Types of Reserves General Reserve – will probably have been built up over a number of years by appropriation of profits, which could otherwise have been distributed.
In times of low profitability, it is quite in order to transfer from the General Reserve so that a dividend distribution can be maintained.
Capital Reserve - an indication that such monies may not be distributed as a dividend.
Any profit arising on a revaluation of property, for example, will be treated as a capital reserve, such profit not being available for dividend purposes until it is actually realized.
Share Premium Account – arises when a company issues shares at a price which is higher than their nominal value.
This ‘profit’ cannot be distributed as a dividend but can be used to meet the expenses arising from the issue of shares and other purposes.
The share Premium Account is regarded as a capital Reserve.
Fund and Sinking Fund – the word Fund should be restricted to those reserves which have specific investment, made outside the business.
A sinking Fund describes a fund, which increases annually as appropriations of profit and investment are made according to a predetermined plan by fixed installments.

At the date chosen for producing the figures, the income and expenditure accounts (that is, Revenue Accounts) are ruled off and the amounts transferred to the profit or loss for the period concerned.
If this is to be accurate, it must be arrived at using figures for expenses and income, which relate to the current period only.
It is very seldom that items such as rates, rent and insurance premiums relate exactly to the financial year for the business and so adjustments have to be made to ensure that the charge to profits reflects the actual cost for the period concerned.
This involves carrying forward into the next period any payments, which may have been made in advance, or making adjustments in respect of expenses which have not been paid.
Whilst from a mathematical standpoint, it might appear that a business can add to its profits and income which is accrued but not received, the prudent business will not do this unless the income will definitely be received.
Where doubt exists, the appropriate provision will be made for the accrual.

The revenue recognition concept requires that revenue be reported when earned, not before and not after.
Revenue is earned for most firms when services and products are delivered to customers.
The matching principle on the other hand, aims to report expenses in the same accounting period as the revenues that are earned as a result of incurring these expenses.
The matching of expenses with revenue is a major part of the adjusting process.

Fixed assets of a business lose value or are said to depreciate with usage.
In the same way that a business has to pay for the cost of heating, lighting and power, so it must reflect in its calculation of profits and losses the use of the fixed assets employed.
The charge for this is depreciation and should be calculated by one of the recognized methods set out in International Accounting Standard and the Statement of Accounting Standard (SAS 9) according to the circumstances of the business.
You should appreciate that there is no statutory requirement to charge for depreciation; neither, when it is charged, is there a set of rules stipulating how the annual charge is to be calculated.
However, the overriding factor is that for a limited company, Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 1990 requires the annual accounts and balance sheet to reflect a true and fair view of the company’s affairs.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of England & Wales (ICAE&W) makes recommendations and these give guidance in deciding how a company should achieve the “true and fair view.
The annual charge for depreciation decided upon by a business is an attempt to reflect the fall in value of a fixed asset because of wear and tear, the passage of time, or some other factors.
Generally, land is not depreciated, although there may be exceptions as in the case of say a gravel quarry.
It is very rare that the depreciated value of a fixed asset as shown in a balance sheet correctly reflects the current resale value of that asset.
This may seem to be a contradiction of the requirement to present a ‘True and Fair View’ but it should be remembered that the fixed assets exist to enable the business to earn profits and are not held for the purposes of resale.
Fluctuations in the value of the fixed assets are usually ignored unless they are of a permanent nature as this would lead to an erratic profits record not truly reflecting the trading performance of the business.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define Depreciation and explain why accountants provide for depreciation in the final accounts • explain the causes of depreciation 50ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING • outline methods of depreciating fixed assets • calculate depreciation using the various methods.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Depreciation The process of recognizing the loss in the value of fixed assets is called depreciation.
The Ghana National Accounting Standards (GNAS 10) defines depreciation as: “the allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life”.
The Nigerian SAS No.
9 states that deprecation “represents an estimate of the portion of the historical cost or re-valued amount of a fixed asset chargeable against operations during an accounting period”.
The standard also recognizes the fact that depreciation for the accounting period is charged to income, either directly or indirectly.
This definition implies that depreciation is effectively an accrual technique, which matches the cost of a fixed asset with the benefits, which are derivable from the asset (ATSWA, 2009: 153).
Unless assets are depreciated, their value may sometimes be overstated on the balance sheet.
Assets such as plant and machinery are held for the purpose of earning income, and the loss arising on those assets through wear and tear is undoubtedly an expense against such income.
If depreciation was not provided for by charges against profits, additional capital would have to be raised whenever the necessity for replacing the asset arose.
Three factors contribute in deciding on the amount of depreciation to be charged in the final accounts: (i) Original or historical cost of the asset; (ii) Estimated life of the asset; (iii) Estimated scrap, residual or break-up value of the asset.
3.2 Causes of Depreciation 1.
Physical deterioration 2.
Wear and Tear: An asset may depreciate in quantity, quality and value as a result of constant usage.
Physical factors like erosion, dampness, rust and decay can cause an asset to reduce in value; 3.
Obsolescence: An asset can become obsolete due to changes in technology.
When this occurs, it is due for replacement.
A very good example is the steam engine train; 4.
Passage of time: Depreciation occurs in some assets with the effusion of copy rights; 51ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 5.
Depletion: Some natural resources like gold, oil or tin deposits become worthless when the deposits have been depleted.
They are called wasting assets.
The more they are extracted, the less the reserve; 6.
Inadequacy: As a result of expansion in the productive capacity of a company, an asset may become too small an inadequate and thus require replacement for bigger ones.
3.3 Methods of Depreciation There are various methods of depreciating fixed assets.
These are: i) Straight Line Method ii) Diminishing or Reducing Balance Method iii) Annuity Method iv) Sinking Fund Method v) Retirement and Replacement Method vi) Sum of the Year Digit Method vii) Depletion Unit Method viii) Insurance Policy Method ix) Revaluation Method.
The method to be adopted is a matter of policy on the part of management of the business.
However, consistency must be applied.
This means that all similar assets should be depreciated using the same method and the same method should be used every year.
Straight Line Method The life of the asset is estimated, together with any remaining scrap or resale value at the end of that period.
The scrap value is deducted from the original cost, and the remaining figure divided by the number of years ‘useful life’ of the asset.
The figure calculated is the amount of the yearly depreciation charge.
EXAMPLE 1 A machine costs N100,000 with an estimated ‘life’ of 5years.
The ‘trade in’ value or scrap value is estimated at N5000.
Use the straight line method to compute the yearly depreciation charge.
Formula to be adopted is: cost – Scrap value Life (Years) = 100,000 – 5000 5 52ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Therefore, annual depreciation charge is N19,000 As mentioned earlier, the depreciation charge may be credited to the asset account (for example, machine Account) or to a separate Provision for Depreciation of machine Account.
Either way, each year, the value of the asset shown in the balance sheet will reduce by an equal amount.
However, the latter way of treating depreciation is more recommendable.
The straight-line method or fixed installment (as sometimes called) is generally favoured.
It is a method recommended for the depreciation of assets such as freehold buildings, plant and machinery, tools and equipment, ships, transport vehicles, leases, and patents.
Reducing Balance or Fixed Interest Method The entries passed can be identical to the straight-line method; the difference is in the method of calculating the annual depreciation charge.
Instead of an equal amount being passed each year the figure is calculated as a fixed percentage of the reduced balance on the asset account brought forward from the previous year.
EXAMPLE 2 Assuming that the annual depreciation rate is 20 percent using the reducing balance method and the cost of the machine is N100,000 as in our example above.
Formulae: Year I: Depreciation charge = cost x 20% Year II: Depreciation = (Cost – Depreciation of year 1) x 20% Year III: Depreciation = (cost – Depreciation of year 1 & II) x 20% Therefore, the calculations will appear thus: Year I: Depreciation = 100,000x20% = N 20,000 Year II: Depreciation = (100,000-20,000) x 20% = N 16,000 Year III: Depreciation = (100,000-20,000-16,000) x 12% = N 12,800` Sinking Fund Method Unless the business physically sets aside cash when passing entries for depreciation, there is no certainty that sufficient liquid funds will be available when the assets need replacement.
The effect of debiting the profit and loss Account with the depreciation charge is to reduce profits and thus reduce the ability of the owners to draw all their profit 53ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING entitlements but ‘plough back’ at least some of these to help the business grow.
These liquid funds are then absorbed by enabling the business to purchase extra stocks, or allowing debtors to increase.
The sudden withdrawal of a large sum of money to finance the replacement of a fixed asset, even if possible, is quite likely to cause difficulties, which the business will probably prefer to avoid.
Cash shortage problems at asset replacement time is one of the main purposes for using the Sinking Fund Method.
In effect, this is action carried out in addition to the normal book entries for depreciation.
The sinking fund method involves investing cash equal to the annual depreciation charge in a fixed interest yielding investment/stock.
Interest that accrues on the investment is reinvested and together with the further annual investments over the life of the asset should produce a fund which is sufficient to replace the asset being depreciated.
EXAMPLE 3 A machine purchased today at a cost N 100,000 is expected to be replaced after 5 years.
The old machine is expected to realize N 20000 when disposed in 5 years, time while the new machine is anticipated to cost N 120000.
Hence, the sum of N 100,000 will be expected to make up for the cost of the machine in 5 years time.
The company adopts sinking fund method of depreciation and decides to set aside an equal annual amount which at an interest of 5% will provide N 100,000 in 5 years time.
According to an annuity table, N 0.180975 invested annually at 5% will provide N1 in five years time.
Therefore the depreciation needed on an annual basis will be: = N 0.180975x100,000 = N 18,097.50 Accounting entries of the sinking fund method Profit and loss Account – debited with the annual depreciation charge (N 18, 097.50) Depreciation (or sinking) fund account- Credited with the annual charge (N 18097.50) Depreciation (or sinking) fund Investment Account – debited with the cash invested (N 18097.50) Cash Account – credited with the cash invested (N 18, 097.50) As interest or dividends are received 54ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Cash Account – debited with the amount of the interest or dividend (N 904.88 at end of year 1) Depreciation (or sinking) fund account– credited with the amount of the interest or dividend (N 904.88 in end of year 2) Subsequently Depreciation (or sinking) fund investment Account-Debited with the interest which is invested (probably) At the same time as the annual depreciation charge is invested) i.e N 904.88 at the beginning of year 2.
Cash Account- credited with the amount which is invested.
In this way at the end of each year the balances on the Depreciation fund Account and the Depreciation fund investment Account will be equal.
Insurance Policy Method This is similar in concept to the sinking fund method in that liquid funds will be available to replace the asset.
The essential difference is that Insurance Company will undertake to repay a stated sum of money at the end of the depreciation period in return for an annual premium.
In this case, the amount of the annual premium is the amount of the depreciation charge to the profit and loss Account.
The accounts and entries used are – Depreciation Policy Account – debited with annual premium Cash Account – credited with the annual premium Profit & Loss Account – debited with the annual depreciation amount.
Depreciation Policy Fund Account- credited with the annual depreciation amount.
Depletion Method This method is used to depreciate a mine or quarry.
The rule is that the cost of the asset is depreciated in the same proportion as the annual amount extracted bears to the total raw materials estimated at the outset.
For example, if the estimated yield of a quarry is 800,000 tons and 120,000 tons (that is, 15% of the total estimated are extracted in a year, then one tenth of the original cost) will be depreciated in the year.
Annuity Method 55ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The principle involved is that cash invested in an asset could have been invested elsewhere to earn a profit.
To compensate for this, interest is charged to the asset account and credited to profit and Loss Account, whilst the annual charge for depreciation is debited to the profit and loss account.
As the balance of the account falls so is the interest (which is calculated on the outstanding balance) reduces.
The effect is that the net charge to profits for depreciation increases over the life of the asset.
The method is most suitable for long leases involving high initial outlays, but having an accurately determined life.
The rate of interest can either be the rate expected on normal investments or the rate the business earns on its own capital.
Sum of the Year Digit (SYD) Method This method like the diminishing balance method, also seeks to accelerate the accumulation of depreciation.
Under this method, a decreasing depreciation is computed by a simple mathematical procedure relating to arithmetical progression.
Each year of an asset’s life should be represented by a digit.
Add these digits and charge fraction of the asset cost to the years in a reverse order.
EXAMPLE 4 Assuming machine ‘X’ costs N 10, 000 and has an estimated useful life of 5 years, what will be the depreciation for at least the first three years using SYD method.
Solution: Step 1: SYD= 1+2+3+4+5=15 Where the number of years (n) is large SYD is given by the expression: N(n+1) 2 Applying this formula to the data given we have: 5(5+1) = 5(6) =30 = 15 2 2 2 Step 2: Year one depreciation charge = No of years remaining x cost of asset SYD =5 x 10000 = N 3,333.33 15 Year two depreciation charge = 4 x 10000 = 2,666.67 15 56ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Year three depreciation charge = 3 x 10000 = N 2, 000 15 It would be observed that this method also yields reducing yearly charges, although the rate of decline is less steep than is the case with the reducing balance method.
An important difference between the two methods is that the SYD does not yield any residual (scrap) value unless explicitly brought into the computation.
AMORTISATION Amortization and depreciation are related concepts in that both attempt to allocate costs over different accounting periods.
However, while depreciation is concerned with allocating cost of tangible fixed assets, amortization is concerned with intangible fixed assets, such as Goodwill, trade marks and patents whose values are gradually lost within a determined period.
It is usually computed using a simple formula: Value of intangible asset No.
of years The usual accounting entry is to debit profit and loss account and credit the relevant (deferred revenue expenditure or intangible asset) account.
Note that differed revenue expenditure such as long term advertising cost, preliminary or formation expenses etc are also amortized.
3.4 Accounting for Depreciation After calculating the depreciation charge for an accounting year, it is very important that these amounts are recorded in the books of account.
The process of providing for depreciation is recording for the use of fixed assets during the accounting period.
This therefore, means that depreciation is a revenue expenditure and as such must be recorded in the same manner that accountants record normal business expenses.
There are two main ways of recording depreciation in the books of account of a business organization: 3.4.1 The Old Method Here, depreciation charges are recorded in the fixed, asset account.
The double entry of depreciation is as follows: 57ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (a) Dr. Depreciation Expenses Account, Cr.
The Fixed Asset Account.
(b) Dr. Profit and Loss Account, Cr.
Depreciation Expense Account.
3.4.2 The Modern Method The modern practice of recording depreciation treats depreciation as a contra to the fixed asset account.
The fixed asset account is maintained at its original cost.
A ledger account called “accumulated provision for depreciation account” is opened and all depreciation calculations are credited to that account, the corresponding entry being passed into the depreciation charge account as a debit.
The double entry is as follows: Dr. Depreciation Charge (Expense) Account.
Cr.
Accumulated Provision for Depreciation Account.
(i) Dr. Profit and Loss Account Cr.
Depreciation Charge Account 3.5 Disposal of Fixed Assets An organization can dispose off its fixed assets by either selling it for cash, exchanging it for a similar asset or a different one, or merely by discarding the asset.
In all these three situations, you must remember to take out the disposed asset from the main fixed asset account.
This is done by opening an account for the purpose of the disposal.
Into this account is entered the cost of the fixed asset and its associated accumulated depreciation provision.
A profit or loss may arise from the disposal of the fixed asset depending on the outcome of the fixed asset disposal account, 3.6Accounting Entries The old and new methods of depreciation can be applied as follows: (a) Old Method Where the depreciation has been credited to the asset account, the following procedures must be followed: (i) Dr. Cash book with amount realized on sale of Cr.
Asset Account asset.
(ii) If a profit is made on sale of fixed asset: Dr. Asset Account 58ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Cr.
Profit and loss account.
(iii) If a loss was sustained on disposal of fixed asset: Dr. Profit and loss account Cr.
Assets account.
(b) Modern Method When depreciation has been carried to a provision for depreciation account, it is best dealt with by opening the disposal account to which the original cost of the asset and the accumulated depreciation are transferred.
The procedures are: (i) Dr. Asset Disposal Account with cost price of asset.
Cr.
Asset Account (ii) Dr.
Provision for depreciation account Accumulated Cr.
Asset Disposal Account depreciation (iii) Dr. Cash book with cash or cheque Cr.
Asset disposal account received on sale (iv) Dr. Asset disposal account with profit on sale Cr.
Profit and loss account of asset.
It means that the balance on the fixed asset disposal account is credit.
That is, the amount received from the sale is more than the net book value of the fixed asset.
(v) Dr. Profit and loss account with loss on sale Cr.
Asset disposals account of asset.
Where the balance on the fixed asset disposal account is debit, it means that the amount received from the sale of the fixed asset is less than the net book value of the fixed asset sold.

Describe the following methods of depreciation i) Sinking Fund Method ii) Annuity Method 4.0 CONCLUSION Fixed assets produce revenue through use rather than through resale.
They can be viewed as quantities of economic service potential to be consumed over time in the earning of revenues.
Depreciation recognition transfers a portion of acquisition cost and capitalized post- acquisition cost of fixed assets to an expense account called depreciation expense.
The corresponding credit is to make provision for depreciation, a control fixed asset account that reduces gross asserts to net book value.
This expense is recorded as an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period.
Depreciation expense could be classified as a selling or administrative expense, depending on the assets function.
Manufacturing firms include depreciation of plant and machinery or factory building in the cost of goods produced.
When the goods are sold, depreciation becomes part of cost of goods sold.

The cost of goods manufactured, normally called the production costs is transferred from the manufacturing account into the Trading account by crediting the manufacturing account and debiting the trading account.
The production cost effectively replaced purchases found in the trading account of a retail enterprise.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define and explain a manufacturing account • outline sub-heads of a manufacturing account • prepare a manufacturing account • prepare final accounts of a manufacturing company.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Manufacturing Account Manufacturing of goods is the transformation of raw materials into finished goods.
Some firms have to manufacture their products before they are sold to the public.
Examples are Nigeria Bottling Company, Nigeria Breweries and Cadbury Plc.
whereas some merely sale products which are acquired in finished form.
A manufacturing organization will acquire raw materials; engage labour and other inputs necessary to change the raw materials into finished goods.
Manufacturing accounts is prepared to ascertain the cost of goods manufactured during the financial year.
It is in fact an extension of the trading account.
Any concern which is involved in a manufacturing or production process should prepare a manufacturing account so that the basic costs of production can be recorded and, perhaps related to the cost of purchasing goods of similar quality in a finished state from outside sources.
The manner of preparing a manufacturing account can be varied to meet particular circumstances but, usually will be prepared to show the prime cost of production and the factory or market cost of production.
The difference between the two is that prime cost is the total of direct items consisting of wages, materials and expenses, whereas factory cost also includes the cost of indirect production costs.
3.2 Format for Manufacturing Accounts 66ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Manufacturing, Trading, Profit and Loss account of ABC Enterprises: N N N N Opening stock of raw materials X Cost of Production C/d XX Add purchases of raw materials X Add carriage inward on raw materials X X Less closing stock of raw materials X Cost of raw materials consumed X Add direct wages X Royalties X Direct Expenses X Prime cost X Factory overhead Factory power X Factory rent & rate X Indirect wages X Factory Insurance X Depreciation of plant & machinery X Fuel and power X Lubricants X X Add opening stock of work in X progress X Less closing stock of work in progress X Cost of Production XX XX Opening stock of finished goods X Sales x Add cost of production X X Less closing stock of finished goods X Cost of Goods sold X Gross profit X XX XX Selling and distribution Expenses: carriage outwards X Gross profit b/d X Commission on sales X Discounts received X Salesmen Salaries X X Administration Admin Salaries X Office rent X Office insurance X Office lighting X Office machine depreciation X X Net Profit X XX XX The sequence and grouping of items in a manufacturing account depends on the costing system of the firm and is usually designed to yield the maximum amount of information on the composition of the total cost of production.
67ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Manufacturing account is prepared using both the T-Method as in the format above and the Vertical method as in the example below.

The cost of production must be adjusted for work in progress at the beginning and end of the year.
3.3 Transfer Pricing The usual practice in the preparation of manufacturing account is to transfer the production cost to the trading account at historical cost.
This means that the manufacturing account will not record any profit and for that matter, one will not know whether the manufacturing process is profitable.
A technique is therefore devised with the purpose of ascertaining profit on the manufacturing account.
This is done by transferring from the manufacturing account the market value of the goods produced for the period.
The reason for the use of the market value as the transfer figure to the trading account is to ascertain the cost of the manufactured item, had the firm decided to acquired those products in the open market instead of producing them.
In this situation, the manufacturing account will show a balance, which will reveal either a profit or loss on production.

But Non-profit making organizations are not profit-oriented, but exist to promote activities, which interest their members or to provide services to needy people.
There are many types of non-for-profit organizations.
They include: Government owned hospitals, voluntary health and welfare organizations, religious organisations, private and community foundations, professional associations, research and scientific organizations, social and country clubs, trade associations, labour organizations, political parties, sports clubs, societies, charitable organizations, self-held organizations and self-projects, etc.
Some of them may maintain an elaborate set of account books similar to those kept by any major commercial undertaking; others do not appreciate the need for – or cannot afford the cost of setting up proper double entry records.
In place of trading and profit and loss account found in trading concerns, they prepare the following accounts to show the financial affairs to their members: (a) Receipt and payment accounts (b) Income and expenditure accounts (c) Balance sheet.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: 76ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING • differentiate between final accounts of not-for profit organizations and those of commercial enterprises • prepare receipts and payments account • prepare income and expenditure account • prepare the accumulated fund of a not-for profit organizations • prepare a balance for not profit making organizations.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Receipt and Payment Accounts This is the account that shows the summary of cash actually received and paid over a particular period of time.
Receipts being debited and payments credited.
It is, in effect, a summary of the cashbook, and therefore, shows the opening and closing balances of cash in hand, and receipts and payments of any kind and on any account made during the period.
Here, capital receipts and payments, revenue receipts and payments are included even if it did not relate to the particular accounting period.
However, amount owing (accruals) or any form of arrears will not be shown in this account.
A receipts and payments account would usually take the following form: XYZ RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS ACCOUNT Dr Cr N N Balance b/f XX Salaries and wages XX Subscriptions XX Stationery and postage XX Membership fee XX Rent and rates XX Donations XX Refreshments XX Dance Tickets XX Travelling XX Sale of drinks, etc.
XX Purchase of an asset XX Sale of an asset XX Balance c/f XX XX XX 77ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The receipts and payments account usually excludes any income received in a form other than cash, e.g.
a donation of books, and any expenses that may not be paid in cash, e.g.
depreciation.

3.2 Income and Expenditure Accounts This account will be used to calculate the excess of income over expenditure (or the opposite) by taking account of cash, non-cash entries such as payments which are due but not paid, and depreciation.
It is the non-trading organisation’s equivalent of a profit and loss account of a business, and therefore excludes any capital items.
The rules are stated below: (x) Expenses are debited and incomes are credited; (xi) Capital items are excluded; (xii) All revenue items relating to the period are credited, whether actually received or not; 78ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (xiii) All expenditure items relating to the period are debited, whether actually paid or not; (xiv) All items relating to previous or next periods are excluded; (xv) The balance on the account represents the excess of income over expenditure (surplus) or excess of expenditure over income (Deficit).
3.3 Differences between Receipt and Payment Accounts and Income and Expenditure Account Receipts and Payment Accounts Income and Expenditure Accounts Only Cash transactions are There is adjustment for accruals recorded and prepayments It includes capital items It excludes capital items Balance represents cash in hand or Balance represents surplus or bank overdraft deficit 3.4 Format of Income and Expenditure Account Expenditure: Income: N N Rent X Subscriptions X Wages X Donations X Postage X Rent received X Secretary honorarium X Profit on bar X Depreciation X Lighting X Surplus of income over expenditure X XX XX 3.5 Accumulated Fund The capital sum, which represents the difference between the assets and liabilities belongs to the members of the society or club and will be called the accumulated fund or capital fund.
3.6 Adjustments 3.6.1 Arrears of Membership Subscriptions Although it may seem that subscriptions which are owed by members are an asset in the same way as any debtor is, in fact, unlike the situation which normally exists between debtors and creditors, it is most unlikely 79ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING that the society would bother to press very hard for arrears of subscription.
Membership will be allowed to lapse and no further action will be taken.
It follows, therefore, that subscriptions, which are due, should not be included in the income and expenditure account until actually received.
Overdue subscriptions subsequently received, should be included in the current year’s income, but entered separately.
There may, however, be occasions when the view is taken that subscription in arrears at a year end should be accounted for – this will depend on the attitude of the management committee.
Refreshments, Restaurant, and Bar If the club have a restaurant or bar requiring separate accounting action, these accounting action will be summarized and shown alongside the main income and expenditure account.
Any profit or loss on the activity will be transferred to the income and expenditure account.
3.6.2 Membership Subscription in Advance There is the sum of money paid for future years by the members.
It is treated as a current item.
3.6.3 Life Membership Subscriptions are often received from life members.
Life members pay a once and for all subscription, which entitles them to membership facilities for the rest of their lives.
The once and for all payments from life members are not income relating to the year in which they are received, because the payment is for the life of the members, which can of course last a very long time to come.
In practice, if life member’s subscriptions are small, they are credited to income as received, but if they are significant in amount, then they should be credited in equal proportion over the estimated active membership of such members.
3.7 Trading Activities Many associations take part in activities designed to improve their financial positions.
They can run bars, restaurants and other commercial activities.
When a club is operating a bar, it is usual to prepare a separate trading account to show the results of its activities.
The profit or loss is carried to the income and expenditure account.
If profit is made, it must be credited to the income and expenditure account and loss will be debited.

UNIT 2 SINGLE ENTRY AND INCOMPLETE RECORDS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1 Definition of Single Entry and Incomplete Records 3.2 Disadvantages 3.3 Calculating Profit from Two Balance Sheets 3.3.1 Book-keeping Rule for Single Entry 87ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.3.2 Format 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assignment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION The unit discusses how you will prepare the trading, profit and loss account and balance sheet for an enterprise that has only opening and closing net assets and perhaps capital as the only known figures.
You will also understand and learn how to ascertain the proprietor’s drawings and any additional capital contribution during an accounting period from scanty information provided by a cashbook summary.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain what is meant by incomplete records and single entry records • calculate profit of an enterprise using the accounting equation from available information • derive proprietor’s cash drawings or additional capital as a missing figure where all other information relating to cash payments and receipts are known • derive expenses incurred and revenue earned from incomplete records.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Single Entry and Incomplete Records The term ‘single entry’ is applied to any system, which does not provide for the two fold aspect of transactions, while the alternative term ‘incomplete records’ is often applied to books of account kept on such a single entry or incomplete double entry system (ATSWA, Study Pack 2009: 240).
In other words, it is the system of bookkeeping, which does not conform to the basic principles of double entry.
88ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING This system of record keeping is very common with small business enterprises where the proprietors are neither trained accountants nor rich enough to employ the services of qualified or experienced accountants.
Since the records prepared by the record keeper are incomplete or inadequate, accountants have to use their mental ingenuity to prepare the accounts from the available information.
Incomplete records present a large amount of unsorted information.
Pure ‘single entry’ recognizes only the personal aspect of transactions; consequently, the only essential books are personal ledgers for recording transactions with debtors and creditors.
That is, real and nominal accounts are not kept by the business enterprises.
3.2 Disadvantages (i) It does not conform to the principle of double entry book- keeping; (ii) The flexibility of the double entry principle is lacking; (iii) It is difficult to obtain accurate information since the records are not complete; (iv) It is always very difficult to arrive at the profit for the year.
3.3 Calculating Profit from Two Balance Sheets Under this method, the assets and liabilities are given but information relating to sales and purchases are not given.
The profit or losses are ascertained under this system by a comparison of the value of the opening capital with the value of the closing capital.
Because of insufficiency of information, the statement of affairs method will have to be adopted.
3.3.1 Book-keeping Rule for Single Entry (i) The opening statement of affairs is prepared to show the opening capital.
The information required are all fixed assets, total of debtors and creditors, expenses owing and payments in advance, cash in hand and bank, etc.
(ii) Adjust the capital by adding any additional capital contributed either in cash or assets and deduct drawings either cash or goods; (iii) Another statement of affairs is constructed to show the closing capital using all the assets and liabilities at the end of the period.
(iv) The opening capital is compared with the closing capital.
(v) If the capital at close is greater, then there is a profit.
(vi) If the capital at close is lower, then there is a loss.
3.3.2 Format for Computing Statement of Affairs 89ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The format of computation is shown under: Step 1: Opening Statement of Affairs N N Opening Capital X Fixed assets X Liabilities X Current assets X X X Note: Opening capital = Assets - Liabilities Step 2: Closing Statement of Affairs N N Closing Capital X Fixed assets X Current liabilities X Current assets X X X Having arrived at the closing and opening capital, the net profit is calculated.
The best way is to prepare the statement of profit.
Step 3: Statement of Profit or Loss for the Year N N Closing Capital X Add Drawings X X Less: opening capital X Additional capital X X Net Profit or Loss X The profit can also be calculated using the accounting equation, as seen below: Opening capital – drawing + additional capital = New capital.
Profit = New Capital + Drawings – Opening Capital – additional Capital.
EXAMPLE Innocent Okeke started business a year ago by putting N500, 000 cash into a bank account and trading in a general way from rented 90ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING accommodation.
He wants to calculate how much profit he has made during the year.
The following information is gleaned from a detailed scrutiny of his bank statement.
Drawings in the year are N2, 000, 000 His brother in-law lent him N1, 500, 000 during the year, interest free.
Payments of N6, 200, 000 have been made to his suppliers during the year.
His customers have paid him N 9, 000, 000 in the year.
The bank balance is N 90, 000, cash in hand N 10, 000 Rent of N 100, 000 is owing and so is a bill for electricity of N 100, 000.
Rates of N 400, 000 have been paid for the whole year and three months have still to run.
A van was acquired for N600,000, but is now estimated to be worth N500, 000.
Stock held is thought to have cost N600,000, but would sell for N900, 000.
The total value of goods purchased from suppliers was N 9, 000, 000.
Innocent Okeke has invoiced his customers to a total value of N 13, 100, 000 during the year.
One customer who owes him N 300, 000 has moved from the area without leaving a forwarding address.
Prepare a statement of assets and liabilities to show the profit or loss for the year.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION John Innocent, statement of assets and liabilities Assets: N N N Motor van 500,000 Stock 600,000 Debtors – invoiced 13,100,000 Less bad debt 300,000 Cash received 900,000 9,300,000 3,800,000 Rates paid in advance 100,000 Bank 90,000 91ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Cash 10,000 5,100,000 Less liability: Loan 1,500,000 Creditors 9,000,000 Less cash paid 6,200,000 2,800,000 Rent due 100,000 Electricity 100,000 4,500,000 Closing capital 600,000 Add drawings 2,000,000 2,600,000 Deduct capital at start 500,000 Profit for year N2,100,000 Obviously a statement of assets and liabilities does not show the details of how the profit or loss was arrived at, and if this information is required, a greater depth of investigation will have to be carried out.
It may not be possible for the trader to establish a full set of double entry records; but where he keeps a record of his suppliers’ and customers’ accounts, together with a properly narrated cash book preparation of the final accounts, makes it possible.
This is greatly helped by using an Analysis Cashbook, that is, a cashbook with several columnar rulings so that income and expenditure can be entered in accordance with the various headings chosen.

4.0 CONCLUSION Single entry is a system of book keeping which does not conform with the basic principles of double entry.
Despite the fact that financial records of some of these businesses are not kept in the proper double entry system, some of them succeed in making profits from year to year and others sustain losses too.
From the scanty records kept by proprietors of such businesses, trained accountants have devised a way of finding out whether a profit has been made or a loss has been sustained.
The method used is known as the increase or decrease in net worth approach.
5.0 SUMMARY This study unit has: • Defined single entry and incomplete records; • Discussed the disadvantages of incomplete records; • Demonstrated how profit can be calculated from incomplete records; • Gave a hypothetical format of steps involved in the preparation of accounting statements.

It is possible for complete records to be reconstructed by applying the principle of double entry to the information available.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • convert single entry and incomplete records into double entry records • prepare detailed trading and profit and loss account from records that were not kept on double entry system • determine purchases and sales figures from the purchases ledger- control and the sales ledger control accounts • derive expenses incurred and revenues earned from incomplete records.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Conversion of Single Entry to Double Entry The single entry records can be converted to double entry system.
When trained accountants are given certain degree of financial information, they are capable of converting the incomplete records of a business enterprise into a full set of accounts on the double entry principle.
The conversion from single entry to double entry system becomes most necessary when the business whose proper books of accounts have not been kept has prospects for growth, when it requires adequate financial planning and control, and when the proprietors 96ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING becomes aware of internal control problems as a result of fast rate of expansion.
In the Adjustment Account in the sales ledger, the same information would be given, but on the opposite sides.
This means that the entries in the General Ledger Adjustment Account in the sales ledger would be on the opposite sides to those on which the entries had been made in the personal accounts.
In General Ledger, Purchases Ledger Adjustment Account N N Total cash paid to creditors XX Balances of all personal accounts XX of creditors b/f Total discount received XX Total purchases XX Total returns to suppliers XX Total of bills payable accepted XX Total inter-ledger transfers XX Balance c/f XX XX XX 3.1.1 Required Books for Conversion The financial records that will be needed to prepare final accounts from incomplete records are: (i) Sales ledger (ii) Purchases ledger (iii) Day books (iv) Cash books (v) Assets and liabilities account (vi) Normal accounts.
The Trial balance may be extracted to show the accuracy of the postings.
There are no specific sets of rules to be followed except a proper understanding of the principles of double entry.
3.2 Preparation of Final Accounts In preparing final accounts from incomplete records, the following operations must be carried out: (a) Preparation of a statement of affairs to calculate the capital; (b) Analysis of the cashbook; (c) Reconstruction of those accounts that is necessary to find figures not given in the question.
Analysis of purchases and sales control account to get both purchases and sales figures required; 97ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (d) Preparation of any other required working schedule, e.g.
reconstruction of nominal accounts; (e) Preparation of trading, profit and loss account; (f) Preparation of the balance sheet.
3.2.1 Preparation of a Statement of Affairs The first step is to construct a statement of affairs listing the assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year.
This statement is prepared to show the financial position of the business at the year is technically called statement of affairs.
In most practical situations, the owner of the business will provide lists of values of fixed assets that he/she uses in the business together with the dates of acquisition.
It should therefore, be easy for you to calculate the accumulated provision for depreciation of the fixed assets from the date of their purchase to the date of reporting.
Values of such items as stocks in trade, debtors and liabilities may have to be estimated with the help of the owner.
From the above financial information, a journal should be opened and accounting entries with the aim of achieving the dual purpose of recording accounting transactions should be effected.
This means that appropriate debit entries must be posted into assets account and credit entries entered into capital or liabilities accounts.
The difference between the assets and liabilities, which usually end up with the assets exceeding the liabilities may be assumed to be the initial amount that the owner used in starting the business and therefore, will be recorded as the capital of the business.
It is possible that the owner may be able to mention the initial amount he used in commencing the business.
Where this is the case, then any difference between such capital and the net assets estimated may be recorded as the balance on the profit and loss account retained in the business.
3.2.2 Preparation of Cash and Bank Summary To ascertain the cash position of the business, this could be deduced by carefully examining available passbooks, pay in slips, bank statements and the cheque counterfoil.
The cashbook will appear thus: Receipts Cash Book Payments Cash Bank Cash Bank N N N N Balance b/f X X Purchases X X 98ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Interest received - X Rent X X Receipt from customers X X Bank charges X X Wages X X Insurance X X Fixed Assets X X Drawings X X Balance c/d X X XX XX XX XX Balance b/d X X 3.2.3 Analysis of Unbanked Cash Sales At this stage, it is very important to determine the amount of cash sales which have not been banked by the owners, but which might have been used by the owner to pay for business expenses, cash purchases, and personal drawings.
It is possible that the owner might have made use of some of the physical stock in trade for his or her personal use.
In such a situation, conducting an informal interview with the owner would confirm the existence of such occurrences and so will help the book keeper make an appropriate estimate for stock drawing, physical stock taking by head counting of items in stock at the close of business which will give you the actual closing stock figure and therefore, may not need to be estimated.
3.2.4 Posting from the Cash and Bank Summary After analysing cash and bank transactions, the next step is to post the entries into the ledger.
From the analysis of the debit side of the cash and bank summary and information obtained from the pay-in-slips: (a) All cash sales or takings should be credited to the debtors account in the sales ledger; (b) Any proceeds from the sale of fixed assets should be credited to the respective asset account; (c) Any interest or income from investment must also be credited to the appropriate revenue account; (d) Any other item should be posted to the credit of the relevant account; From the analysis of the credit side of the cash and bank summary and information obtained from the cheque counterfoils: 99ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (i) All payments for goods purchased should be debited to the trade creditors’ account in the purchases ledger account; (ii) Payment for expenses should be debited to the relevant nominal account; (iii) All purchases in connection with fixed assets should be debited to the appropriate asset accounts; (iv) Any charges should be posted to the debit of the bank charges account; (v) Any other item should be posted to the debit of the relevant account.
3.2.5 Preparation of Debtors and Creditors Schedule A schedule should be compiled detailing all customers who are owing the business, as a result of goods sold to them on credit.
The total of the schedule of debtors therefore, represents debts owed to the business and as such, must be carried forward to the credit of the total sales ledger control account.
There is likely to be a missing figure in the debit side of the total debtors’ account, which represents total sales on credit for the period and should be transferred to the credit of the trading account as sales or turnover.
Another schedule that must be prepared is a list of amounts owing by the business to its suppliers for goods purchased on credit.
The total of this schedule represent total liabilities by way of trade creditors outstanding at the end of the period and should therefore, be carried forward to the debit of the purchases ledger control account.
The total of purchases for the period will be derived from the credit side of the purchases ledger control account as a balancing figure and should be transferred to the debit side of the trading account.
Similarly, accruals and prepayments will be carried forward as closing balances in the appropriate expense accounts.
The actual expense amount that has been incurred for the accounting period should be accounted for as a balancing figure.
3.2.6 Preparation of Any Other Required Working Schedules All expenses that are expected to be charged to the profit and loss account must be calculated.
3.2.7 Extraction of Trial Balance Since all transactions would have been recorded and the double entry completed, the next stage is to extract a Trial Balance, which will form 100ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING the basis for the preparation of the trading, profit and loss account and balance sheet.
3.2.8 Preparation of Trading, Profit and Loss Account The Trading, Profit and Loss account will be prepared, since the purchases and sales figure would have been arrived at, using the control accounts.
The gross and net profit figures will be ascertained applying the normal rules.
3.2.9 Preparation of Balance Sheet The Balance sheet is prepared using the closing balances of assets and liabilities and the capital calculated in the statement of affairs.

UNIT 4 SELF-BALANCING LEDGERS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1Definition of Self-Balancing Ledger 110ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.2Advantages and Disadvantages of Self-Balancing Ledgers 3.3The Principles of Self-Balancing System 3.4Format of Self-Balancing Ledger 3.5 Modern Practice 4.0Conclusion 5.0Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assessment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION In your preliminary study of accounting and bookkeeping, you must have learnt how the Ledger can be classified into separate books, each recording a particular class of transaction.
This is where book keeping comes into play.
The invariable result of double entry bookkeeping is that “the sum of the debits is equals to the sum of the credits” and this applies quite irrespective of the number of ledgers that may be employed.
The entire debit balances in the entire ledger must necessarily equal the entire credit balances, and a trial balance of the complete set of books should give an exact agreement of the debit and credit totals, and thus prove the arithmetical accuracy of the ledger.
When the system adopted involves the balancing of the ledgers as a whole and the trial balance disagrees, it indicates that one or more errors exist in the ledgers; but it gives no indication as to the nature of the mistake, nor does it enable one to determine which ledger is affected.
Our main business in this unit is study how a self-balancing principle can be used to proof the accuracy of ledger accounts.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define self-balancing ledgers • discuss the advantages of self balancing ledgers • explain the principles of self-balancing ledgers.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Self-Balancing Ledger Originally, the accounts of debtors and creditors were only show in the General Ledger.
Later, the idea of raising these accounts in separate sales ledger and purchases ledger with reversed entries were developed.
The opening of the accounts both in the General Ledger and the sales 111ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING and purchases ledger results to corresponding debit and credit entries and renders the accounts ‘self-balancing”.
The accounts prepared under this principle are called adjustment accounts.
For all intents and purposes, adjustment accounts are memorandum accounts that are prepared only to check the accuracy of the books and not as part of the financial records proper.
3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Self-Balancing Ledgers It is desirable and convenient practice to adopt a system by means of which each ledger can be balanced independently of the other ledgers.
The advantages of this separate balancing are four fold, namely: (1) As errors are detected, delay in balancing is minimized, there by saving time, money and labour; (2) A complete trial balance may be compiled before the individual personal ledger balances are extracted, thus facilitating the preparation of both interim and draft final accounts; (3) It enables accounting systems that would otherwise be unwieldy; to be divided into self- contained sections; (4) The control accounts provide a quick means of ascertaining the up to date amounts owing to and by the business.
This information can be very useful to the management.
3.3 The Principles of Self-Balancing System The basic principle of a “self- balancing” ledger is that it must contain a record of the two fold aspects of all the transactions with which it relates, that is, that the double entry has been completed within the ledger itself.
The method by which this is effected is by means of a control account (sometimes termed a “Total” or “adjustment” account), which is kept at the end of the ledger and contains a summary of the totals of each class of transaction debited or credited in detail to the individual personal accounts in the ledger concerned.
3.4 Format of Self-Balancing Ledger In the General ledger, Sales ledger adjustment account N N Balances of all personal XX Total cash paid by customers XX accounts b/d 112ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Total sales XX Total discount allowed XX Dishonored cheques XX Total returns from customers XX Charges made to customers for XX Total of bills receivable from XX carriage, package, etc.
customers Interest on overdue accounts XX Total of bad debts XX Inter-ledger transfers XX Balance (c/d to debit side) XX XX XX EXAMPLE Goodness Neken keeps his sales ledger upon the “self- balancing” principle.
From the under mentioned particulars, prepare the “Sales Ledger Adjustment Account” as it would appear in the general ledger on 31st January 2008.
N 1 total debtors debit balances at this date were 120,542 2 Total goods sold to customers for the mouth 210,658 2 Carriage paid on behalf of customers 10,000 31 Total goods returned by customers for the mouth 9,042 31 Total cash received from customers for the mouth 150,621 31 Discount allowed to customers who pay before the due date 2,000 31 Total acceptances (Bill of Exchange) received from customers during the month 30,471 31 Total acceptances dishonoured by customers during the month.
5,042 31 It was reliably gathered that a customer who owed N 4,500 is now bankrupt and there is no way of debt recovery.
Note: i.
Interest of 2% is charged on any outstanding balance at the end of the month.
ii.
A customer who owes the business N 6,000 is also owed by Neken and the two have settle for books offsetting.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION TO EXAMPLE In the General ledger, Sales ledger adjustment account Particulars N Particulars N Balances of all personal 120,542 Total cash paid by 150,621 accounts b/d customers Total sales 210,658 Total discount 2,000 113ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING allowed Dishonored cheques 5,042 Total returns from 9,042 customers Charges made to customers 10,000 Total of bills for carriage, package, etc.
receivable from 30,471 customers Interest on overdue 2,872 Total of bad debts 4,500 accounts Inter-ledger transfers 6,000 Balance (c/d to debit 146,480 side) 349,114 349,114 Balance B/d 146,480 3.5 Modern Practice Although at one time, it was usual to double-enter the Adjustment Account, it is becoming increasing the practice in modern business to omit the Adjustment Accounts in the personal ledgers and to retain only the control accounts in the general ledger.
No advantage is sacrificed through this omission.
As a separate control account is kept for each personal ledger, the total amount of the balances in each ledger is known, and a mistake can thus be traced to the ledger in which it occurs.
Moreover, there is no valid reason why both adjustment accounts should be kept since neither forms part of the doubt-entry system.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE (a) What are the main advantages of self-balancing ledgers?
(b) “It is becoming increasingly the practice I modern business to omit the adjustment accounts in the personal ledgers and to retain only the control accounts in the general ledger”, discuss.
4.0 CONCLUSION In most businesses, the largest group of accounts consists of the accounts of Debtors and Creditors.
For these reasons and to facilitate posting, these accounts are usually kept in separate ledgers, namely: the Sales Ledger Adjustment Account or Purchases Ledger Adjustment Accounts.
However, these Adjustments accounts do not obey the double entry rule as in-fact, they constitute third entries, made for convenient only and not included in the balance sheet.
In modern accounting practice, many organizations prefer to maintain control accounts rather than self-balancing ledgers, as both are memorandum accounts.
114ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 5.0 SUMMARY This study unit has: • Defined self balancing ledgers • Discussed the advantages of self balancing ledgers • Explained the principles of self-balancing ledgers • Prepared a hypothetical formats of sales ledger adjustment account and purchases ledger adjustment account • Explained the modern practice with respect to preparation of self- balancing ledger.

The ledger will be split into several parts such as the Bought, Sold, and General Ledgers.
These could further be arranged alphabetically.
In order to control the accounting operations and to locate errors, each ledger will be made self balancing by opening control accounts.
In the general ledger will be recorded a sales ledger control account and a bought ledger control account.
The balance in each will correspond to the total balances outstanding on the individual accounts within the respective ledger, that is, the total of all the debtors’ account recorded in the sales ledger will be the same as the debit balance on the sales ledger control account.
In the sales ledger will be a general ledger control account, which will have a credit balance equal to the debit balance on the sales ledger control account.
Each ledger is then fully self-balancing.
The totals of the items, which have been individually posted to the respective personal accounts, will be posted periodically to the control accounts from the books of prime entry.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain what control accounts are • discuss the advantages of control accounts • itemise the sources of information for control accounts 117ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING • prepare control accounts from given information • describe debtors statement or statement of accounts • prepare debtors statement or statement of accounts • it will enable you to clear more of the grey areas.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Control Accounts A control account is an account in which the balance reflects the aggregate balances of many related subsidiary accounts which are part of the double entry system.
It is a memorandum record only, it does not form part of the double entry system, but it is kept using double entry principle.
Control accounts are maintained to facilitate easy detection of errors because they act as a check on the entries in the various ledgers.
Where the trial balance totals are not equal, balances in each ledger can be added together and compared with the balance in the respective control accounts.
Ordinarily, the two should be equal, where there is a difference, such ledger that fails to reconcile with the control account will be investigated rather than all the ledger accounts.
Control accounts are classified into two main divisions: viz: 1.
Total Debtors Control Account or Sales Ledger Control Account.
2.
Total Creditors Control Account or Purchases Ledger Control Account 3.2 Advantages of Control Accounts The merits of using control accounts can be summarised as follows: (a) Control accounts helps in locating errors.

The firm can sell on credit to a customer and buy on credit from the same person.
The inter-indebtedness will be set off against each other.
At the end of the period, the smaller of the two balances will be set off against the larger balance.
3.7 Debtors Statements or Statements of Account Debtors’ statements are documents sent periodically, usually once a month, by a seller to his customers, showing the position of their accounts up to a certain date.
Each statement gives the particulars of the invoices, debit notes and credit notes that the seller has sent to the customer during a month, payment made and how much the customer owes the seller and when the account will be due for payments.
The statement is often a copy of the customer’s account in the seller’s books.
The statement may be kept for reference purpose or returned to the seller with the customer’s cheque.
In either case, neither the customer nor the seller records the statement in his books.

Distinguish between Debtors Ledger Control Account and Creditors Ledger Control Account.
4.0 CONCLUSION Control accounts are total accounts that assist in the detections of errors and in the management of the subsidiary accounts.
The advantages of using control accounts are most appreciated if the numbers of customers are very large.
If a mistake occurs and there is no indication as to which ledger contained the mistake, all the ledgers accounts would have to be checked – a labourious and costly process.
5.0 SUMMARY This study unit has: • Defined control accounts; • Discussed the advantages of using control accounts; • Outlined the sources of information for control accounts; • Explained the sales and purchases ledger control accounts; • Prepared sales and purchases ledger control accounts; • Discussed control entries; • Explained and prepared a debtor’s statement.

It may be that one person has special contacts for the disposal of certain types of goods, whereas another person has finance available to support the venture.
Their purpose in combining is to exploit the joint resources, but without the intention of establishing a full trading partnership.
In these circumstances, because of the short term nature of the venture, joint books will not be established, but each party will open a personal account in his own books entitled joint venture with ----.
This account will reflect the individual party’s transactions on behalf of the joint venture and on completion will send a copy of this to his co- adventures.
A combined account in memorandum form will be prepared to calculate the resultant profit or loss and to show the apportionment of this amongst the parties.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define a joint venture business • explain the working of joint venture businesses • prepare joint venture Accounts from Information provided.
128ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Joint Venture Defined A joint venture is a business activity undertaken jointly by two or more person (or firms) that are otherwise independent.
The joint venture is normally for a specific business activity so at the end of such an activity, the firm dissolves.
3.2 Joint Venture Accounts Each party to the joint venture is expected to contribute to the initial outlay and the running expenses at the agreed ratio and at the end is expected to share in the results of the venture at the same ratio.
In every joint venture, there is the memorandum of joint venture account, which is common to all the parties in the venture.
It is in this account that the revenue is matched against the costs to determine the profit or loss of the venture.
This account also shows the distribution of the profit or loss of the venture among the parties involved (Okwoli, 1993:300).
Each party in the joint venture then opens an account in his ledger, in which each will debit his/her colleague with all the expenses incurred and credits him/her with every revenue (including unsold stocks taken over) he/she received.
If there is a debit balance in this account, the amount is due to the owner of the ledger and vice-versa.
At the end of the life of the venture, the balance due from one party to the other is determined and once it is paid, the business closes up.
EXAMPLE Wang, Wale and Willy decide to enter into a joint venture for the purpose of trading in lot of antique fire dogs available at auction in Kaduna.
Wang will bid at auction, Wale will provide the immediate finance, which is required, and arrange cartage to Lagos where Willy will sell to various dealers with whom he is in contact.
The transactions arising in 2007 were as follows: Wang April 12-19 Expenses relating to viewing the items at various auction rooms, petrol, and agreed mileage allowance – N 300 April 19-26 129ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Cost of having the items sent to his home to await collection by Wale – N 500 Wale April 19-26 Payments to various auctioneers for goods purchased – N 5000 May 2 Packing insurance and freight cost for transport from Wang’s home to Willy’s storage rooms – N 1000 Willy May 3 Agreed labour costs for unpackaging the items and setting up on display – N 200 May 10-31 Various sales made to different parties totaling – N 12, 000 May 31 Agreed expenses relating to transport of items to prospective purchasers – N 300 Required: Record the above transactions in the relevant Books of Accounts of the parties in naira.

UNIT 2 CONSIGNMENT ACCOUNTS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 134ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1 Definition of Consignment 3.2 Basic Terms 3.3 Operation Arrangements 3.4 Accounting Arrangements 3.5 Consignor’s Books 3.5.1 Accounting Entries 3.5.2 Valuation of Stock on Consignment 3.5.3 Stock Losses 3.6 Consignee’s Books 3.6.1 Accounting Entries 4.0 Conclusion 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assessment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION There will be occasions when a manufacturer or supplier of goods will use an agent to sell goods on his behalf.
This will occur perhaps because the agent will have special local knowledge enabling him to find buyers, which otherwise, would never be put into contact with the manufacturer or supplier.
To avoid delays, the agent must have the goods in his possession even though he never obtains ownerships of the goods.
The use of an agent can arise either when the market is overseas or in the same country as the seller.
In such cases, some records must have to be considered which are necessary since the one merchant, known as consignor, will send a consignment of goods to another merchant, the consignee to be sold on behalf of the consignor.
In this unit, we shall consider the keeping of these records.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain what consignment accounts are • record transactions in the books of the consignor • record transactions in the consignee’s books.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition Consignment A consignment is an arrangement whereby goods are sent to an agent who tries to sell them on behalf of the sender on commission basis.
There is therefore, a consignment when goods are sent to an agent 135ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING known as the consignee for sale by the sending party called the consignor.
A paper called pro-forma invoice, which gives brief description of the goods on consignment and the minimum price at which they could be sold normally accompanies all goods on consignment s instructions from the consignor to the consignee.
3.2 Basic Terms 3.3 Operation Arrangements (i) Goods sent to an agent are usually despatched in bulk and are termed a consignment; (ii) The party sending the goods is the consignor and the agent is the consignee; (iii) Both parties incur expenses in connection with the consignment; (iv) Periodically, the consignee sends an “account sales” to the consignor.
This is a document which shows the sales made by the consignee, along with his expenses and commission.
A banker’s draft for the net balance may accompany the account sales or make a “money transfer” in that respect; (v) Sometimes, the consignee guarantees that all the trade debts will be collected, and should any prove to be bad, that he will bear the loss.
He receives an extra commission (known as del credere) on all sales for the additional undertaking.
3.4 Accounting Arrangements The act of consigning goods to an agent does not constitute a sale by the consignor but merely a transfer of location of the goods concerned.
Ownership of such goods remains vested in the consignor although they are in possession of the consignee.
Sales arises when the goods are sold by the consignee to third parties and the accounting arrangements reflect this situation and are different for each of the two parties.
Hence, two people’s account books are affected when goods are sent on consignment – the consignor’s books and the consignee’s books.
3.5 Consignor’s Books In the consignor’s books, three main accounts may be opened, namely: (i) The consignment outwards account, which shows the goods sent on consignment; 136ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (ii) The consignment to consignee account, which shows the proceeds of sales of the consigned goods and the consequent net profit or loss on the consignment; and (iii) The consignee account, which records the gross proceeds of the sale, his entitlements and the balance to be remitted to the consignor.
In the consignor’s balance sheet, unsold goods on consignment form part of his current assets under the name of goods on consignment.
3.5.1 Accounting Entries 1.
Debit Consignment to agent Account, Credit Goods on Consignment account (with value of goods transferred to agent).
2.
Debit Goods on consignment account or trading account (with closing balance of goods on consignment).
3.
Debit Consignment to agent account, Credit Bank or cash or creditors etc as appropriate (with expenses incurred in connection with the consignment).
4.
Debit consignment to agent account or sales (with consignee’s expenses and commission on receipt of the account sales).
The opposite entries are posted to a personal account opened in the name of the agent.
The balance on this account is settled in cash or by bill of exchange or is carried forward to the next accounting period.
5.
Debit balance carried down at start of the next accounting period, Credit consignment to agent account (with unsold stock).
EXAMPLE 1 When the goods are consigned to the consignee, the consignor cannot regard that as sales, neither can he consider the consignee as being a debtor.
So two “pigeon–hole accounts” are opened.
Various authorities give these accounts different names, although the purposes remain the same.
The accounts used and their purposes are shown next with hypothetical figures.
Consignment to (Agent) or Consignment a/c N N 137ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Goods on consignment 40,000 Gross proceeds of sale 60,000 Expenses incurred 4,000 Commission 3,000 Profit on consignment 13,000 60, 000 60, 000 ===== ===== Consignment Outwards /Goods on Consignment/Goods Consigned Outwards Account N N Trading a/c 40,000 Goods on consignment 60,000 The consignment to (agent) account: thus becomes a miniature profit and loss account for the particular transaction.
The balance is transferred to the profit and loss account.
The consignment outwards account: although credited with the cost of goods, is not a sales account.
The balance when transferred, should be debited in the trading account from the purchases figures, or shown as a separate credit from sales.
This is because the sales figure includes gross profit, whereas the balance of the consignment outwards account is at cost price.
Unfortunately, consignment accounts cause a lot of confusion to students because of the difficulty in remembering which account is debited, or credited with the entries so try to pay special attention to learning this aspect.
If you study the example below, you will see that the consignment to (agent) account has a lot of entries, is the miniature profit and loss account and is debited initially with the cost of the goods consigned.
The consignment outwards Account will only (normally) have one credit during a financial period.
Here is a simple example: Bunny & Co. sends goods costing N20, 000 to their agent, Tani.
The cost involved are freight N1, 400, insurance N800, all in March 2, 2007.
Consignment Outwards to Tani Account N N March 2, 2007: Goods on consignment 60,000 Consignment outward a/c 20, 000 138ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Freight 1, 400 Insurance 800 Consignment Outwards to Tani Account March 2, 2007: March 2, 2007: N N Consignment outward a/c 20, 000 Consignment to Tani 20, 000 Freight 1, 400 Insurance 800 Corresponding entries will also be made in freight, and insurance Account.
In due cause, Tani is successful in selling all the goods to one purchaser, Larry and Co. Tani will render an account sale which is a statement showing the expenses incurred in handling the goods, commission arising from the sale and setting out the net amount due to Bunny and Co. On receipt of this, the next entries can be made.
The Account sale shows that the goods were sold for N, 000; that storage expenses were N 1, 600; haulage costs N 1, 200; and his commission N 1, 600.

Assume that Tani had sold only half when the balance sheet at 30 June was prepared, then the expenses with half the cost of the stock would be carried forward: - 140ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Consignment to Tani Account 2007: N 2007: N Mar 2 Consignment outward 20,000 June 6 Tani 16,000 Freight 1,400 June 30 Balance c/d 10,000 Insurance 800 June 30 Profit & loss a/c 200 26,000 26,000 ===== ===== June 30 Balance b/d 10,000 This balance of N 10, 000 would appear in the balance sheet as part of stock on consignment.
3.5.2 Valuation of Stock on Consignment In arriving at the closing stock valuation, only amounts relating to unsold stock are included; thus, the agent’s expenses incurred on the incoming consignment are included but certain items of a marketing nature are excluded from the calculation on the grounds that they relate to the goods, which have been sold and not to those remaining unsold.
Closing stock value thus comprises the aggregate of the initial cost of the goods plus the attributable cost of both the consignor and consignee, but a further refinement is required when stock losses occur.
3.5.3 Stock Losses When goods on consignment are lost or stolen or damaged in transit, further accounting problems arise: (i) Debit suitable account, credit consignment to agent account (with the cost of the loss).
(ii) Stock in agents hands is calculated as follows: (a) Stock Quantity Total consignment quantity x Consignor’s attributable costs (to point of loss) (b) A further calculation is then made of: Stock quantity 141ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Total consignment quantity x Consignee’s attributable cost - quantity loss 3.6 Consignee’s Books In the consignee’s books, only one account – the consignor’s account is of particular interest.
The consignor’s account shows the gross proceeds on sale of the consignment, all expenses incurred by him in respect of the consigned goods, his entitlements and the final balance due to the consignor.
If the consignee had entered the cash proceeds of sale in his private cash book on sale of the consignment, when the consignor is paid, the cash book should be credited.
Cash book should be credited.
He does not concern himself with any cost not borne by him.
Unlike the consignee, the consignor takes all costs into account to determine his profit or loss on consignment.
3.6.1 Accounting Entries 1.
On receipt of the consignment, the consignee makes a memorandum record of quantities etc, but does not record their value in his ledger.
2.
Debit account in the name of the consignee (with expenses, commission on sales), credit account in the name of the consignee (with sales).
Opposite entries for all of these transactions are made in the consignee’s bank, commissions received, debtors, etc accounts as appropriate.
3.
Consignee does not bring the closing stock balance into account because the value of the consignment was not originally recorded in the accounts.
4.
The balance on the consignor’s account at the end of the period represents the net sum due from the consignee to the consignor and may be settled by payment or carried forward to the next accounting period, depending on the agreement between the parties.
It should agree in amount with the balance on the agent’s account in the consignor’s ledger.

REQUIRED: Show these transactions in the: (i) Consignor’s books including the balance on 30th June, 2009; and (ii) Consignee’s books.
4.0 CONCLUSION Consignment accounts are usually necessary where a business is separated from its customers or client either as a result of geographical separation or some other factors.
These goods are usually dispatched to the consignee.
The goods never become the property of the consignee.
Therefore, he incurs no liability as a result of the transaction until the goods are sold, when he becomes liable for payment of the proceeds.
He is paid by a commission.
The consignor and consignee will both keep their separate records.
5.0 SUMMARY This study unit has: 147ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING • Explained the arrangement involved in consignment accounts; • Discussed the basic terms in consignment accounting; • Outlined the accounting entries needed to be made in the books of the consignor and consignee.
• Discussed how stocks are valued; • Discussed how losses are treated.

UNIT 3 CONTAINER ACCOUNTS CONTENTS 1.0 Introduction 2.0 Objectives 3.0 Main Content 3.1Definition of Container 3.2Accounting For Containers 3.2.1 Non-Returnable Container 3.2.2 Returnable Containers 3.3Accounting Entries 3.3.1 Non-Returnable Containers 4.0 Conclusion 149ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 5.0 Summary 6.0 Tutor-Marked Assessment 7.0 References/Further Reading 1.0 INTRODUCTION For many products, some form of packaging is very essential.
Items of food are usually put into bags or wrappers or tins, as appropriate.
Cigarettes are put into packets; paint and motor oil are sold in metal or plastic cans.
Certain other products require much stronger containers.
Acid is stored and transported in a non-corrosive (usually glass) carboy, radio – active materials in special casks.
Beer is put inside cartons; soft drinks are put inside crates, shirts into waterproof bags, granulated sugar, salt into bags, etc.
Containers of the type mentioned above may or may not be re-usable.
The consumer throws packages of items that cannot be re-used away when the product, which it is protecting, is used up.
For some other types that are re-usable, they are returnable to the manufacturers or suppliers, when empty.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define a container • discuss the accounting arrangement for the different types of containers • prepare container accounts.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Container A container is any item that contains goods for the purpose of either preservation or conveyance to an agreed destination.
In marketing, the container is called the package, which may be divided into three main levels of materials – the primary, secondary and the labelling levels.
The primary package is the product’s immediate container, the secondary package is the additional level of layer of material designed to protect the primary package and the labelling is any printed information which appears on the package to describe the product in it.
3.2 Accounting for Containers 150ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING In accounting literature, a container is looked at from two main stand- points – either it is non-returnable or returnable.
3.2.1 Non-Returnable Container Non-returnable containers create no problems to the accountant after sale because in costing the goods, the cost of packaging would have been taken into consideration.
A container of that nature is treated as a manufacturing expense and no record is taken of it after sales.
Customers are not chargeable for non-returnable containers outside the selling price which may, however cover all expenses including the package.
These are primary packaging, which is in effect, an integral part of the product and which is discarded when the product is used up, constitutes part of the manufacturing cost of that product and forms part of the cost of sales figure of the manufacturer.
3.2.2 Returnable Containers The cost of returnable containers is not taken into consideration in costing the goods that are sold.
It has its own distinct cost which is returnable.
Re-usable secondary packaging, for example crates and primary packaging are treated as a distribution cost if not returned to the manufacturer or supplier.
In those instances where the manufacturer or supplier is eager for the container to be returned, a deposit is invariably imposed on the customer.
This is refundable in full or in part, according to the condition of the container, if returned.
It is apparent here that the manufacturer or supplier must keep records showing container bought, lost, damaged, scrapped and in stock and records showing deposits receivable, refunded and refundable.
Just like there are opening and closing balances of stock of goods for sale, there can also be opening and closing balances of stocks of containers.
3.3 Accounting Entries Method 1: Two accounts should be opened as follows, each with separate columns for quantities, unit values and total amounts.
(a) Container Stock Account Containers stock account records containers bought, scraped, retained by customers and in stock.
Containers in customers’ hands but capable of being returned are regarded as stock but distinguished from stock available for despatch to customers.
Sums written off the value of 151ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING containers are also passed through this account.
The container stock account usually shows the profit or loss arising on containers.
When a period ends, accounts are prepared, the derived figure of profit or loss on containers is transferred to profit and loss account, whilst the closing balance, representing refundable deposits appears partly or wholly, as appropriate, as a deduction from debtors or as creditors.
The losing balance on containers stock is included in stock.
Four main prices may be associated with container accounts – the book value which represents the price of which stock of containers is valued for balance sheet purposes.
Cost price which is paid for purchases of new containers, charge-out price which represents the price at which containers are charged (hired) out to customers and the credit back price which represents the amount which customers are credited with on return of the containers.
3.3.1 Non-Returnable Containers 1.
Debit container stock account with: • Opening stock; • Purchases during the period 2. Credit container stock account with: • Unit and value of unused containers as carried down.
3.
Difference between both sides of this account represents container consumed during the period and would be passed on to manufacturing account or profit and loss account as distribution cost.
3.3.2 Returnable Containers There are several problems associated with returnable containers and some may include: (i) Closing stock may be held partly in the warehouse and partly in the hands of customers; (i) Each container will presumably have a limited life, and a reasonable allowance for depreciation must be made; (iii) Some of the damaged containers may be repaired from time to time and eventually scrapped when they are no longer in use; 152ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (iv) Profit may arise if price charged to customer is above cost.
(v) Further profit may yet arise if the allowance made on return is less than price charged; (vi) A time limit may be set for return after which container in the hand of customers will be written off; (vii) Each container should have an identification number and the columns should be provided in the sales daybook or journal and in the customers’ accounts for these numbers periodically.
These numbers need to be cancelled after the in and out entries movement of container.
Generally, there are three methods that could be used in keeping accounts of returnable containers having regards to the associated problems.
Method II Under this method, two accounts are prepared.
These are: (a) Container stock Accounts; and (b) Container Trading Account.
The container stock account here records stock of containers at their book value and keeps accounts of only stock items, while Container Trading Account is used for measuring profit or loss on container and monitoring the movement of container in the hands of customers.
It records the refundable deposit, deposit receivable and forfeited (through non-return), sum written off in form of depreciation and repairs and maintenance.

It involves recording transactions in the following account: 1.
Container Stock Account, which keeps records of stocks of containers alone.
Stocks are recorded at cost or book value except purchases, which is recorded at cost of purchases, and depreciation, which is credited against the cost of purchase.
2.
Container suspense account: This is basically used to monitor the movement of containers in the hand of customers and recorded at refundable amount/price.
3.
Container sent to customers account: This is a total account used in monitoring debtors’ balance.
It records transactions at charge out price.
4.
Container profit and loss account: This is used to ascertain profit or loss on all the transactions.

Oduduwa Company delivers goods to customers in plastic crates which are invoice to them at N 10 each, and credited in full if returned within three months of delivery.
The crates are 158ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING purchased by the company from another plastics limited, at the sum of N 10 per crate.
On 1st January 200 x 8, there were 5,000 crates in the warehouse, 17,000 with customers and 500 in transit.

REQUIRED Prepare appropriate accounting records for all crate transactions for the year ended 31st December 200 x 8 in the Books of the company.
4.0 CONCLUSION Most manufacturers or producers of goods/products package their products in one form or the other, using different forms of material enclosure.
The packages used in dispatching goods to customers are referred to as containers.
For example, drum for chemicals or liquid products, case or wooden/plastic crate for eggs and other breakable products, packets for cigarettes, bottles, cartons, and cans.
Containers make it very convenient to move goods from one location to another and also form the basis for monitoring the movement of such containers, both in the warehouse and in the customers’ hands.
In accounting literature, a container is looked at from two main standpoints – either as non-returnable or returnable.
5.0 SUMMARY This study unit has: • Defined a container • Discussed how containers are accounted for in accounting • Showed accounting entries to be made in financial records 159ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING • Prepared container accounts.

Kuru Ltd. despatched its products to customers in bulk in wooden rates.
The crates are bought from the manufacturers at N3 each, but are valued for stock purposes at N20 each Customers are charged a deposit of N50 per crate, N 40 of which is refunded when the crate is returned.
At the beginning of 2009, Kuru Ltd. was holding 1,750 crates on its premises, whilst customers held 1,460.
The corresponding figures at the end of the year were 3,021 and 1,983 crates respectively.
During the year 2009, the company bought 2,000 crates charged out 5,663 crates to customers and made refunds on 5,104.
Of the remainder, 170 crates were scrapped and customers retained 36.

The supplier may not wish to wait so long for payment because he may need the cash to finance his current operations.
One way in which the supplier can obtain payment at an early stage whilst at the same time allowing the purchaser the benefit of the full credit period, is for the parties to agree to the use of a bill of exchange to finance the transaction.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define a bill of exchange • explain the types of bills of exchange available • enumerate the main parties to a bill of exchange • state how the accounting entries are made in the books • prepare bills of exchange accounts.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Bill of Exchange Here is the definition of a bill of exchange taken from the bills of exchange Act, 1882.
It is ‘An unconditional order in writing addressed by one person to another signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain in money, or to the order of a specified person, or to bearer’.
A cheque is a specialised form of bill of exchange, drawn on a banker and payable on demand.
162ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.2 Types of Bills of Exchange (i) Inland Bill: This is a bill of exchange drawn and payable in Nigeria.
(ii) Foreign Bill: This is a bill drawn in Nigeria and payable in another country.
(iii) Accommodation Bill: An accommodation bill is a bill of exchange, which has been accepted, drawn or endorsed by a person, known as accommodation party, not for valuable consideration but for the sole purpose of lending his name/reputation to another person, known as accommodation party, so that the accommodated party can enjoy some benefits which he could not have enjoyed otherwise.
Such benefits, of course, depend on the exact nature of the accommodation bill.
They include, but are not limited to the following: • The accommodated party can enjoy credit facility from his supplier because the latter would be reassured by the reputation of the accommodated party; • The accommodated party can raise funds by discounting the accommodation bill, with a financial institution because, with the reputation of the accommodation party, the financial institution is reasonably assured that it can recover the debt.
3.3 Advantages of Bills of Exchange (a) It is a means of settling foreign debts and financing of exports; (b) A bill of exchange enables the debtor to postpone payment to a later date; (c) It is an evidence of indebtedness of the debtor to the creditor; (d) It enables the holder to sue in his/her own name and free from equities; (e) It fulfils, to a certain extent, the function of money; 163ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (f) It enables the creditor to receive money immediately despite the fact that the debtor is yet to pay his debt.
The creditor does this by discounting the bill with a bank or discount house; (g) By means of an accommodation bill, a person can lend his name and reputation to another person, thus, enabling that other person to enjoy some benefits which he could not have enjoyed otherwise.
3.4 Options Available to the Holder of a Bill of Exchange The beneficiary of a bill of exchange has four options: (i) Wait until the maturity date to collect the value from the acceptor; (ii) Negotiate the bill (by endorsement, etc.)
to another person in settlement of his own indebtedness; (iii) Discount the bill with a bank or discount house; (iv) Obtain an advance on the bill from a bank.
3.5 Accounting for Bills of Exchange A bill becomes an accounting issue only when it has been accepted by the drawee, who now becomes an acceptor.
It is only then that the following accounting entries are made.
3.5.1 In the Books of Drawer (Supplier) 1.
Debit Drawer A/C, Credit Sales A/C – (with the value of credit sales).
2.
Where the drawer discounts the bill: (i) Debit Bills Receivable, Credit Drawee (Debtor) – (with the value of the accepted bill on the date of acceptance); (ii) Credit Bills Receivable – (with the full value of the discounted bill on the date of discounting); 164ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (iii) Debit Discount on Bills, Credit Bank – (with the discount charge on the bill on the date of discounting); (iv) Debit profit and loss a/c, Credit Discount on bill – (with the discount charged on the bill at the end of the accounting period).
3.
When the bill receivable is transferred to a creditor of the drawer: a(i) Debit Bills Receivable, Credit Drawee – (with the value of the accepted bill on the date of transfer); (ii) Debit Creditor, Credit Bills Receivable – (with the full value of the accepted bill on the date of transfer); b.
No accounting entries are required, if payment is made by the acceptor on the due date; c. If the bill is dishonoured by acceptor on the due date: Debit Debtor (Bills’ acceptor), Credit Creditor – (with the full value of the bill transferred on the due date).
4.
When the bill is held till maturity: (a) Debit Bank, Credit Bills Receivable – (with the value of the accepted bill on the due date).
(b) No accounting entry is required, if payment is made by the acceptor on the due date.
(c) If the bill is dishonoured by the acceptor on the due date: Debit Debtor, Credit Bank.
3.5.2 In the Books of Drawee (Debtor) (1) Debit Purchases, Credit Drawer – (with the value of credit purchases).
(2) Debit Drawer’s account, Credit Bills Payable account – (with the value of the accepted bill on the date of acceptance) (3) No accounting entry is required when the drawer discounts the bill on the discounting date.
(4) If the bill is paid by the acceptor on its due date: 165ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING Debit Bill Payable account, Credit Bank account – (with the full value of the accepted bill on the due date).
(5) If the bill is dishonoured by the acceptor on its due date: (i) Debit Bills payable account, Credit Drawer account – (with the value of dishonoured bill on the due date.
(ii) Debit Expenses account, Credit Drawer account – (with the value of noting charges incurred on the dishonoured bill).
Furthermore, the defaulting acceptor will be charged interest for his/her default.
In the drawer’s book: Debit Drawee account; Credit Interest Receivable account – (with the interest charge) and Credit Drawer account – (with the interest charged).
3.6 Noting Charge This is the fee paid to a notary public, preferably lawyer to represent dishonoured bill to the acceptor.
This fee was incurred primarily due to the failure of the acceptor to honour the bill of exchange on the due date.
Hence, the expenses incidental to the representation of the dishonoured bill will be charged on the debtor’s account as follows: Debit Drawee and Credit Bank or Transferee – (with the value of the noting charge).

The following records were extracted from his book: 1/7/x8 Bought goods from Oluwa N 25,000 2/7/x8 Sent cheque for N 12,000 to Oluwa and accepted a bill drawn on him payable on 1/8/x8 for N 10,000 8/8/x8 Sold goods to Oni for N 12,000 9/7/x8 Drew two bills on Oni for N 10,000 and N 2,000 payable on 8/8/x8 and 8/9/x8 respectively.
14/7/x8 Bought goods from Afosa for N 7,000 and paid N 4,000 on account.
23/7/x8 Sold goods to Akimade for N 5,000 and received cheque for N 2,000 and a bill for the balance payable on 22/8/x8.
26/7/x8 Endorsed Akimade’s bill to Oluwa in settlement of the balance due to the latter.
4/8/x8 Oluwa agreed that the bill of N 10,000 be withdrawn after which RATAWU paid cheque for N 6,000 and accepted another bill payable on 3/9/x8.
11/8/x8 Oni’s bill for N 10,000 was returned dishonoured.
20/8/x8 Agreed with Oni that he should return goods invoiced to him for N5,000 against a credit to him of N4,000.
22/8/x8 Akimade’s bill was duly honoured.
168ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING You are required to prepare: (i) The ledger accounts (excluding bank account) to record these transitions in the books of RATAWU up to 31st August 19 x8, and (ii) The Trading and Profit and Loss account (extract) for two months ended 31st August 19 x8 and balance sheet (extract) at the same date.
4.0 CONCLUSION When goods are supplied to or services rendered on credit to a person, the supplier of the goods or services would normally wait for a considerable period of time before final payment is made.
The supplier of these goods or services may be unwilling to wait till such a period when final payment is made as he/she may be in need of money to finance his/her current operations.
He may, therefore, engage in any of the following: (a) Sell the debt to a third party who now pays the sum due after deducting a certain amount as discount.
This is known as debt factoring.
(b) Use the debt as a security to obtain a bank draft from a bank.
(c) Draw up bill of exchange on the debtor, who after accepting it becomes a legal proof of the debt.
The drawer usually draws up the bill and sends it to the drawee, who signs it to signify that he/she accepts the liability by writing the word “ACCEPTED” on the face of the bill.
He then returns the accepted bill to the drawer.
The accepted bill becomes “Bill Receivable” to the drawer and the “Bills payable” to the drawee.
5.0 SUMMARY This study unit has: • Defined a Bill of Exchange; • Discussed the types of bills of exchange; • Outlined the advantages of bills of exchange; • Explained options available to the holder of a bill of exchange • Explained the accounting entries in the books of both the drawer and drawee.

In modern business environment, computers have taken over most of the financial accounting and reporting tasks that were being carried out manually in the past.
Any accountant or prospective accountant must therefore, be knowledgeable in the use of computer software and hardware.
It should be noted that the underlying principles in manual financial accounting and reporting remain unchanged by the advent of computerised accounting.
Computers only make it possible to process large volume of accounting information quickly, accurately and reliably.
2.0 OBJECTIVES At the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the accounting tasks that the computer can be used to perform • discuss the advantages and disadvantages of computerised accounting over manual accounting • discuss the software used in accounting.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 172ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 3.1 Computerisable Accounting Tasks The computer can be used to perform the following tasks in a computerised environment: 1.
Purchase Ledger System The purchase requisition order, receipts and invoice are prepared without any problem.
The computer is also used for purchase ledger and to produce a purchase analysis sheet.
Fields in each record will include account number, name, address, credit details, bank details, cash discount details, details of transactions, balance outstanding, etc.
2.
Sales Ledger System The sales invoice will be posted to the customer’s ledger card, a statement for the customer and a summary sheet or sales analysis is prepared.
The fields in each record will include customer account number, customer name, address credit limit, sales analysis, account type, transaction date, transaction description, transaction code, debits, credits and balance, etc.
3.
Payroll System The computer will prepare the payroll to know the wages, tax and pension contributions and insurance, using inputs like time sheets, details of overtime worked, clock cards, amount of bonus or appropriate details if the computer calculates the bonus.
Outputs will include payslips, payroll, payroll analysis, including analysis of deductions and details for costing purposes, etc.
4.
Nominal Ledger System In the nominal ledger, a trial balance will be prepared from journal entries.
5.
Stock Control System The computer will process data quickly and make available information on stock level and rate of stock turnover.
Inputs will include data on goods received note, issues to production, production to finished goods store, despatch notes, adjustments and record fields may include stock number, description, standard cost, quantity in stock, etc.
6.
Reconciliation 173ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING The computer will speed the preparation of bank reconciliation statements by running a cashbook file against the file containing details from the bank statements.
7.
Fixed Assets System There will be a complete register of all fixed assets of the company and depreciation will be easily calculated.
Inputs will include data about capitalisation policy, depreciation policy, purchase invoices, cash payments and adjustments.
Fields in each record will include asset class, asset name/description, asset identification code, cost and date of acquisition, estimated useful life, depreciation rate, disposal value and date, current depreciation, accumulated depreciation and book value of asset.
8.
Financial Application The computer can be used by banks to handle cheque clearing and payments.
3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Computerised Account System 3.2.1 Advantages of Computerised Accounting System Over Manual Accounting System (i) Accounting packages can be used by non-experts; (ii) Computerised system can process large amount of data quickly and accurately; (iii) Computers can handle repetitive tasks without getting bored like humans do; (iv) Computers improve the flow of information; (v) It provides effective and efficient services to the users; (vi) Staff of organisations are relieved of tedious work; (vii) Computer can be used for management decision-making.
It can be used for forecasting and projecting; (viii) Computers make banking operations easier and faster; and 174ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (ix) Computer creates more jobs, e.g.
system analyst, programmer.
3.2.2 Disadvantages of Computerised Accounting Over Manual Accounting (i) The initial acquisition and set-up costs of a computerised system as well as cost of training the personnel to handle the system may be too high, particularly for a small company; (ii) There is a need for series of security checks and controls to preserve the integrity of the system and the accounting information contained therein; (iii) Due to the fact that accounting information is now held in invisible machine sensible form, there is usually a lack of audit trail – the ability to trace a transaction through the recording process from inception to conclusion.
This lack of audit trail may make it difficult to trace fraud and errors; (iv) The use of computers tends to induce over-reliance on the system and, where there are no adequate back-ups for information stored in the system, operations might be seriously disrupted if the system breaks down; and (v) Employees might resist the introduction of computers because of fears that it might be accompanied by loss of their jobs.
3.3 Accounting Packages An accounting package comprises different accounting modules such as cashbook, sales ledger, purchases ledger, general ledger and payroll.
An accounting module consists of a programme for executing an accounting function.
For example, there would be separate modules for invoicing, inventory, payroll, cashbook, report generator and so on.
A programme is a set of instructions which tell the computer how to process data.
The term used to describe computer programme is software while the term hardware describes the physical components – keyboard, monitor, a box known as central processing unit (CPU) - containing the disk drives and electronic devices and printer.
Accounting software which carry out specific accounting tasks such as payroll, fixed assets register, and inventory control are known as Application Software.
There are other application software such as databases and spreadsheets, which have applications beyond accounting.
3.4 Coding 175ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING To obtain maximum utility from computers, it is important that a system of coding be established so that there would be unique codes for each item.
A code may be numeric (i.e.
entirely made up of numerals) or alphanumeric (i.e.
made up of a combination of alphabets and numerals).
Numeric systems of coding tend to be more flexible and are thus more popular.
Described below is the format of a simple numeric coding system.
Ledger and Cash Book Code Nominal ledger 01 Purchase ledger 02 Sales ledger 03 Cashbook 04 Each of the accounts or items within a ledger may be given a three-digit code.
For example, the accounts of customers A, B, C, D and E may be given codes 001, 002, 003, 004 and 005 respectively.
Also, the following accounts in the nominal ledger may be allotted the following codes: Purchases account 100 Salaries account 101 Printing and Stationery account 102 Rates account 103 Repairs account 104 Sales account 200 Discount received 202 Interest Income account 203 Rent Income account 204 With the above coding structure, sales account in the nominal ledger has code 01 – 200 (or 01/200), while the account of customer C in the sales ledger has code 03 – 003 (or 03/003).
If a credit sale is made to customer C, the command to the system would be to debit code 03-003 and credit code 01-200.
3.5 Integrated Software Versus Stand-Alone Module Integrated software is an application package in which the accounting modules are integrated so that if data is entered in one module, all other modules affected would be updated either automatically or by the user’s command.
For example, if goods are purchased from a supplier, the supplier’s account in purchases ledger would need to be credited, the stock quantity in the inventory records would need to be increased, purchases account in the nominal ledger would need to be debited and 176ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING analysis of purchases in report generator would need to be updated.
In an integrated application package, only one data entry is needed to update all relevant records.
A strand-alone module is an application package consisting of one module, where a transaction occurs that is required by more than one module, the user has to manually load and unload disks and enter the data in all the relevant modules.
3.6 Database A database is a ‘collection’ or ‘pool’ of related data, which is available for use by any number of application packages, including accounting packages.
The software that runs the data base is known as Database Management System (DBMS).
The chartered Institute of Management Accounting (CIMA)’s computing terminology defines a Database as: … a file of data structured in such a way that it may serve a number of applications without its structure being dictated by any one of those applications, the concept being that programmes are written around the database rather than files being structured to meet the needs of specific programme.
The term is also rather loosely applied to simple file management software.
CIMA’s Computing Terminology also defines DBMS as: … any system which enables the definition, storage and retrieval of information from discrete files within a system.
Thus, many file-handling systems are frequently referred to as ‘Database Systems’.
3.6.1 Advantages of Database The advantages of database are: (i) Database reduces storage requirements by reducing redundancy; (ii) Time required for file up-date and maintenance is reduced to the barest minimum; (iii) Database saves programming time because of efficient handling of construction and processing of files; (iv) It makes information supply for use of managers to be consistent and valuable because it is based on comprehensive collection of data; 177ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (v) Access to data is made faster and easier by the use of DBMS in a database; and (vi) It minimises the amount of input preparation needed by the single input principle of database.
3.6.2 Disadvantages of Database (i) The implementation of database requires special analysis and design skills; (ii) One error made in the database can create a chain of errors throughout the database; (iii) Privacy is always a problem in a multi-user environment where data are common to users.
3.7 Database Management System (DBMS) When organisations first started to use computers, they began by computerising one application at a time.
For example, they started with the salaries and wages accounts department, and then computerised stock and so on.
They produced what were essentially file management systems.
The systems were all separate and data was often transferred from one department to another on paper and the same data was typed in again.
Connecting the systems was not as easy as they were all separately designed.
However, database systems changed things; they made it possible to integrate the data from several departments in the database.
The data can be accessed by anyone (with the right access password) and data from different files and different departments can be shared.
Therefore, a database is a collection of data files, which is integrated and organised so as to provide single comprehensive file system.
The data is governed by rules, which define its structure and determine how it can be accessed.
The purpose of a database is to provide convenient access to the common data for a wide variety of users and use needs.
3.7.1 Advantages of Database Management System (a) Avoidance of unnecessary duplication of data.
It recognises that data can be used for many purposes but only needs to be input and stored once; 178ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING (b) Multiple use of data from (a), if follows that data is input one, but it can be used for several purposes; (c) A database provides data for the organisation as a whole, not just for individual departments.
The database concept encourages management to regard data as a resource that must be properly managed just as any other resources; (d) Developing new application programmes with a DBMS is easier, because, the programmer is not responsible for the file organisation, which is already taken care of by the DBMS software; (e) The organisation of data into database, rather than into separate files, encourages the integration of data, and makes data more widely available; (f) Because data is only held once, it is easier to ensure that it is up- to-date, so that no department in an organisation uses outdated, or data that differs from the data used by other departments.
3.7.2 Types of Database There are three categories as follows: Relational Database: In relational database, records are represented using table that is made up of rows and columns.
The columns represent the various fields, while the rows represent record.
For example, there could be customer records, product records, order records and so on.
These systems are relatively simple and are suitable for manipulation by non-data processing personnel.
Network Database: These are further developments of linkage systems with many more record types and linkages.
Linkage system requires the user to know what linkages have been established in order to know on what basis data can be retrieved.
The linkage systems are technically more efficient but do require greater data processing knowledge so their use tends to be restricted to information specialists.
Hierarchical Database: This is a system having in-built linkages whereby there are other records which own numerous ‘member’ records.
Data items have parent-child relationship.
Each parent may have many children but each child can only have only one parent.
179ACC203 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING It is easy to implement, modify and search.
It is however difficult to establish, use up a lot of storage space and not easily transferable from one computer to another.
3.8 Spreadsheet A spreadsheet is powerful software used for processing data.
It can perform all kinds of calculations, from basic ones like addition and subtraction to very complex ones.
A spreadsheet appears on the computer monitor like a flat sheet of paper with columns and rows resembling an analysis sheet.
The intersection of a column and a row is known as a cell.
Only a tiny portion of the spreadsheet is visible on the screen of the monitor.
An example of a spreadsheet is “Microsoft Excel”.
A cell can contain text, number or formula.
Where a cell contains a formula, it would display the result of the calculation of the variables in the formula.
The variables may be the values in other cells.
If the values in those other cells change, the formula recalculates the variables and displays the new result in the formula cell.
A spreadsheet can therefore, be used to create a variety of financial models such as budgets.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE (a) What is integrated accounting software?
(b) Define a database.
(c) Define an accounting code and give concise examples to elucidate your answer.
4.0 CONCLUSION Virtually every area of business can be computerised, particularly financial accounting and reporting.
The obvious advantages of computerised accounting over manual accountings have been well explained in this study unit.
No serious-minded business organisation, except the small ones, can afford to continue with manual systems.
Most organisations now appreciate how information technology applications can help them achieve their objectives better and faster.
