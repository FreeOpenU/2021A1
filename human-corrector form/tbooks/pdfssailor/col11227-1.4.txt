What is a business eco-system?
A business eco-system is a set of business components that form the foundation of a new venture’s creation.
Figuratively, the business eco-system is like a wheel that rolls your new venture forward which is why we represent the business eco-system in a wheel-shaped model .

Every new venture starts with a single seed or kernel of an idea to do something in business that will result in money being exchanged.
Since there is always some risk associated with starting a new business, you will have to take special care to plant the idea seeds of your new venture in a way that allows these seeds to some day bloom into a successful venture.
1.3.1.1 When to plant your market opportunity seeds Without a doubt it’s challenging to know when to move forward and plant your new venture ideas in the (cid:16)business garden(cid:17) where you want to grow your career.
Entrepreneurs who are considering moving forward with a new venture idea can utilize the following questions and the (cid:16)Stop and Go Signs for Accessing Market Opportunity Matrix.

Whatfactorscouldlead tothiscustomerchanginghismindaboutbuyingtheproductorservices?
Whatwillbetheimpact of a crisis during an emerging trend?
What will it cost to make a sale to this customer?
If there is a common pitfall for entrepreneur, it’s greatly underestimating the cost to acquire and repeatedly sell to a customer.
The entrepreneurial marketer must account for every last expense it will take to make the sale.
Commonly missed expenses include: sta(cid:27) time, travel and related expenses, overhead for o(cid:30)ce, payroll taxes, social security employer matching expenses (which occurs in the United States so your countries’ equivalent,) unemployment payroll related expenses, marketing expenses, and the overall amount of time it takes to make a sale.
Is my timing right for this market opportunity?
You will have a brief window of oppor- tunitytolaunchyournewventureorexpansionofanexistingenterprise.
Misjudgingyourtimingis often the di(cid:27)erence between success and failure with assessing market opportunity.
If you are too early, you have the right product or service but your market is not ready for it yet.
If you are too late, giant competitors may have acquired a loyal following, blocking new entries to the market.
Can I sell this product or service for a pro(cid:28)t?
Even if you have an existing customer, and have accurately estimated what it will cost you to acquire that customer; you might not have a sustainable business model until revenues outweigh the expenses...You need to (cid:28)nd the incremental steps you can take to get to pro(cid:28)tability.
This is not easy.
Again, there is no road map,butrememberthatpatienceisneededtoreachpro(cid:28)tability.

While micro-(cid:28)nancing is arguably one form of (cid:28)nancing micro-(cid:28)nancing has been documented to be a more sustainable form of (cid:28)nancing because the amount of the loan is made in such a small (micro) amount that the recipient of the loan does not have to leverage the startup’s best interests and assets in order to pay the loan back.
The small amount of money loaned to the entrepreneur can usually be paid backfromtherevenuesthatthenewventureisgenerating.

(cid:16)Be open and (cid:29)exible and recognize that along the way to pro(cid:28)tability you might stumble on to a product or service that is in higher demand than the original concept.

It’s recom- mended that prior to spending any money on your new venture that you (cid:28)rst come up with the strategy or strategies you plan to utilize to make your startup successful.
Devising the right strategy often requires a great deal of market research on the history of your competition, potential customer needs and wishes as well a taking into consideration the economic climate and cultural factors that could impact your startup.
Examples of startup strategies: • Low cost leader by charging less than the competition • Luxury cost leader by charging more than the competition • First to market by having your product or service in the market place prior to anyone else.
This strategy is often referred to as the (cid:16)(cid:28)rst mover advantage.
(cid:17) • Creating sustainable growth for a startup means that the new venture will eventually make more money then it takes to operate the company and that the pro(cid:28)tability of this venture is possible over an extended period of time.

THE BUSINESS ECO-SYSTEM: YOUR PATH TO FINDING 12 THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW!
1.6.1 Branding: The memorable rim on the wheel Branding is the core foundation of your startup that is necessary to make your product or service blossom and grow.
(cid:16)Branding(cid:17) is a commonly used marketing term that refers to a distinctive image, usually in the form of a logo or company mark that represents a company or product.
In recent years a company’s brand hasbecomeanassetwitha(cid:28)nancialworthknownas(cid:16)brandequity(cid:17).
Themarketinguseoftheword(cid:16)brand’ is borrowed from the process of burning a rancher’s mark into the hide of a calf for identi(cid:28)cation purposes.
When building your brand, the following checklist is helpful for making your startup bloom.
1.6.1.1 Branding coaching What is the meaning behind the message your product and/or service represents?
Coaching: Try writing the history of why you are starting this venture and what is the deeper meaning behindwhyyouaredoingthisandwhatyouhopethelegacyofthenewventurewillbeinthemarketplace.
Review the history and pull out any information that seems relevant toward the meaning.
Then write up some draft messages you hope to communicate when marketing the product or service.
What is the brand essence of your new product or service?
Coaching: Thebrandessenceofyourventureisthe(cid:16)heartandsoul(cid:17) behindtheproductandserviceyouplan to develop; the core DNA of your product or service.
The brand essence is the foundation of your brands true identity and the brand essence typically stays the same over time.
An example of brand essence is the medical corporation International Patient Assistance Centre headquartered in Singapore.
A review of the 21 22 corporation’s website (http://www.ipac.sg/en/About/ ) leads one to believe the brand essence for the medical company is (cid:16)dedicated and experienced patient care teams(cid:17).
If you are not able to come up with the brand essence for your venture try reverse engineering the process by asking yourself what would you like the brand essence of your venture to be and then make a list of action items you would have to do to achieve creating a company with this type of brand essence.
1.3: What is the brand advantage?
Coaching: What sets our brand apart from that of the competition?
Try answering the following: (cid:16)What is distinctive about the brand?
What di(cid:27)erentiates this brand from the competitor’s?
How do customers perceive the brand?
What emotion does the brand evoke?
Who appreciates the brand?
Why?
What do customers get from the brand?
Where do customers go to (cid:28)nd the brand?
23 What do customers see in the brand that the founders didn’t?

What can you do from the start to make sure that others cannot use the mark or brand name?
Coaching: Investigate what the trade-marking regulations are for protecting your brand.
What are the governmental processes for securing a trademark for your brand?
(cid:16)Trade marking(cid:17) is the process one goes through to register with a government entity the text and or visual depiction of your business name and, if applicable, the business mark that accompanies the venture.
A (cid:16)logo(cid:17) is the word utilized typically to describe the visual depiction of the business name.

A venture capitalist does not make any money until the new venture sells, merges or makes an initial public o(cid:27)ering known as an IPO when for the (cid:28)rst time that business o(cid:27)ers common stocks to the public.
Entrepreneurs have had a "love and hate" relationship with venture capitalists because if the new venture doesn’t make the anticipated return on investment predicted the venture capitalists usually has the legal right to take over part or all of the ownership of the new venture leaving the entrepreneurship often out of 34http://www.accion.org AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>CHAPTER 1.

Howauthenticandtruthfulyouareduringthestartupphasewillsetthestageforthefutureethicalthreshold of your new venture.
As the founder and chief visionary behind the concept you are bringing to market, it is your responsibility to create the values and company culture that will be your business.
Once a company culture is set, it is virtually impossible to alter the path that you have set for your new venture to follow.
One way to try to ensure the ethical standards of your company is to (cid:28)rst make sure that you have a good moral compass.
Your (cid:16)moral compass(cid:17) is the ethical stance you take on decisions and actions with your startup.
Here are some questions to consider when developing your own moral compass: • What will the new venture’s code of ethics state?
• How will I make decisions for the startup that will limit my revenue potential but will ultimately be the correct action to take legally and ethically?
• What can I do to ensure that the people I hire have good values?
• Who will I go to for advice when I have a moral/ethical dilemma?
• Will I be capable of following the advice that I receive for taking the right ethical action?
• How will I know what is ethical and what is not?

• What will I do if a sta(cid:27) member or key stakeholder I’m associating with violates my new venture’s code of ethics?

• What people can I go to in order to gain a role model/mentor for acting ethically with my startup?
• If I end up doing something that was unethical what will be my process to correct the situation and to communicate the situation to my stakeholders?
• Will I listen to my gut if I have a strange ethical reaction to someone or something?
• Is there anything else I should ask myself to develop my moral compass?
It turns out in business that self-awareness of one’s action is a key component to understanding how to developanethicalmoralcompass.

1.8.1.2 Going green on a shoe string You may be wondering what you are going to do take the ethical stance on your company’s proactive sustainability plans to protect the environment when you are in the startup phase of your venture.
It happens that doing the right thing for the environment is not just good for the environment but it also can be pro(cid:28)table no matter what your socio-economic state is today with your business.

And good will is something you can take to the bank!
(cid:16)Goodwill(cid:17) is the di(cid:27)erence between what your company is worth and what you are actually able to sell your venture for in the market place.
The more goodwill you generate the higher value of your company in comparison to your competition.
Some of the most environmentally conscious people in the world live in severely economically-challenged neighborhoods.
Do not let your socio- economic status challenge the entrepreneurial ethics behind your startup.
The goodwill you are generating from taking care of the environment could potentially come back to you in the form of good karma!

1.9 Operations: the logistical rim on the wheel44 The operations of your business are the tactics and processes you implement to run your business.
1.9.1 Water your plants: operations hydrate your startup Operations in a startup begin with the composition of a business plan.
A new venture without a business plan is like a car without an engine; it exists but cannot get anywhere.
In fact, researching and drafting the new venture’s business plan is probably the most important and necessary business practice you will ever under take.
Business plans are usually written to obtain (cid:28)nancing for a new venture.
However, the business documentandplanningprocessprovidesamuchmoreimportantfunction.
Thisdocumentwillbeyourroad map for getting your venture started.
The (cid:28)ndings of your research contained in your business plan can tell you from the beginning with pretty good certainty if your new business has a real chance of being successful (cid:28)nancially and sustainable in the long run.
Traditional sections contained in a business plan: • Company Description gives a background to the history of your startup and explains what your venture will do.
• Statement of Mission or Mantra is a short phrase that explains the purpose of your new venture.
• Products and or Services describe what you plan to sell.
• Target Markets elaborate on whom you plan to sell to.
• Marketing Strategy explains what unique maneuvers your venture will under-take to accomplish the businesses goals.
• Competitive Analysis documents who your main competitors are in the market place.
• Management Teamsarethenames, titlesandbackgroundsofthepeoplewhowillleadyourventure to success.
• Operations for Investors explains what tactics you will undertake to (cid:28)nance the venture and the exit strategy you plan to utilize for the initial investors to make a pro(cid:28)t on their investment.
• Financialsdocumenttheforecastedsalesandexpensesforthe(cid:28)rst(cid:28)veyearsofthenewventure.
The (cid:28)nancials should be accompanied by a detailed assumption log which summarizes where the numbers entered in your (cid:28)nancial spreadsheets originally came from.
Most investors want to see your (cid:28)nancial documents include balance sheets, cash (cid:29)ows, income statements and key ratios such is when you anticipate breaking even.
• Long-term Goals explain what you hope to eventually accomplish with the new venture.
• Executive Summary which goes at the beginning of your business plan but is often written last should contain a brief summary of each of the above mentioned business plan sections.
Executive summaries should be limited to two or less pages.
The Executive Summary is often the most read portion of your business plan so it’s important to write and re-write this section until it’s absolutely perfect.
Some entrepreneurs recommend that you draft the executive summary (cid:28)rst and use this document as a planning document to cross check what you need in order to complete the business plan.
After you have completed drafting your new venture’s business plan it may be time to establish the legal entity of your business.
Check with your local government o(cid:30)ce to get directed to the rules and regulations and processes you need to follow in order to properly establish your business’s legal entity Some of the most universal company establishments are: • sole proprietor • private limited company • state-owned enterprise • public-limited company • NGO 44Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35316/1.4/>.

The type of business entity you form will more than likely impact the way in which you pay taxes on your products and services and (cid:28)le your country’s income tax (cid:28)ling.
The de(cid:28)nitions for the di(cid:27)erent forms of company establishments vary from country to country.
You will want to check with the portion of your government that grants company established entities for clari(cid:28)cation With a draft business plan in hand and your legal company business entity established it’s time to fully mapouttheoperations/processesyouplantoutilizetoimplementyourbusinessplan.

This will allow others to make updates as well as understand what you are working on when they are considering interrupting you during the day.
Keep an open mind as you implement your operational plans for the startup.
Remain (cid:29)exible to contin- uous updates.
Remember a startup is an evolving operational process that will need (cid:28)ne turning along the way.

Developing a new product is an operational task that goes (cid:16)above and beyond the call of duty(cid:17) of utilizing the Operations Gantt chart described in the previous Operations section.
Instead, we are recommending that you create a Process Mapping Guide in order to e(cid:27)ectively develop your new product o(cid:27)erings.

Assemble the people who are involved in the development and marketing of a new product at your organization.
Brainstorm a list of the day-to-day steps that are taken to develop and market a new product.
Reviewthelistwithyourboard,strategicalliancepartners,mentors,vendors,andfamilymem- bers for items that may have been missed.
Take the (cid:28)nal list and divide it into two categories: repetitive processes and rare processes.
Repetitive processes are steps that are taken repeatedly when developing and marketing a new product such as manufacturing the product.
Rare processes occur infrequently.
Analyze the rare processes list to see if any of the items mentioned can be combined with or woven into the repetitive processes.
Rare processes can drain resources and are often not budgeted for.
If you can combine a rare process with a repetitive process, you have taken a valuable step toward improving the operational excellence of your business.
Make a (cid:29)owchart of the processes within your organization from the list that was prepared and (cid:28)ne-tuned.
This is where you take what might be explained in several paragraphs of text and drill it down to several (cid:29)owchart icons.

Wewilldiscuss, by way of example, a new product launch event but it’s worth noting that the same general principles apply whether you are planning a new product or new service launch event.
Events organized around a new product/service launch are typically postponed or cancelled because the new product/service does not turn out as anticipated.
Build this scenario into any planned event so that you can recoup some of the costs if the event needs to be cancelled.

Editorial coverage is thought to be much more valuable then advertising in media because people perceive editorial coverage as authentic and of interest.
Startups need to generate a greatdealofexcitementknownas(cid:16)buzz(cid:17) inordertomakethecaseformediacoverage.
Becauseentrepreneurs normally don’t have much if any marketing budgets to initially launch his or her new venture, relying on public relations coverage becomes essential for the success of a new venture.
In order to increase your chances for coverage of the new venture you will want to make sure that communications with the media include information about your new venture that is written in what is known as a (cid:16)tight(cid:17) manner including, if possible, the following attributes: • concise/brief summary • straight-forward • timely and quite current • a (cid:28)rst of its kind if possible • attention-grabbing • authentic and truthful • tying-in if possible with an emerging trend • remarkable • and absolutely accurate 48(cid:16)NewProductLaunchEventPlan(cid:17) textreprintedwithpermissionfromMentorography,Inc.

I was fortunate to meet a student named Jay Milbrandt while teaching a Social Entrepreneurship course at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio School of Business and Management.
Jay had recently traveled to Bangladesh and kept journals of his (cid:28)rst-hand observations of meeting people who were prospering through micro-(cid:28)nance loans.
I found these journal entries extremely inspirational and we hope you will as well.
We encourage you to be on the alert for micro-(cid:28)nance opportunities in your country as a proven method for helping those that are less fortunate than yourselves.
By reading these journal excerpts you can experience how those less fortunate are (cid:28)nding success no matter what their economic situation.
Micro-(cid:28)nanced loans are imparting a great deal of opportunity to those that really need it and transforming the economies of developing countries in remarkable ways!
The following are excerpts from the journal of Jay Milbrandt.

Accordingly, extreme poverty is de(cid:28)ned by the World Bank as living below $1 per day purchasing power parity threshold.
The United Nations set the Millennium Challenge goal of eliminating extreme poverty by the year 2025.
In Bangladesh, at least, it appears to be well on the way.
It’s easytogetlostinthenumbers.
But, whenyoutravelthroughBangladeshmeetingthemicrocredit borrowers, you realize that behind every number is a life(cid:22)real people and real families.
Suddenly, the statistics come alive.
I don’t know what it’s like to live on less than $1 per day.
I have, however, met enough people to garner some details about what such a life is like.
Simply put, you consume in proportion to what you grow; when you cannot a(cid:27)ord more, you beg.
Meet Meera.
She used to live on less than $1per day.
Now, she’s a twenty-six year oldbusiness owner with two daughters, eleven and seven years old.
Her husband walked out on her a few years ago, leaving her to fend for herself.
In the culture of Bangladesh, she was in a very tough spot.
To give birth to only daughters and no sons is unlucky.
Likewise, for a husband to walkout on his wifeislookeddownuponevenmore.
Inspiteofthis, shebecameoneofthemostsuccessfulwomen in her village.
Through microcredit, she started and built a large poultry farm, raising thousands AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>CHAPTER 1.

of chickens and selling them to market.
After showing us her farm, she invited us into her home, which was considered a nice home by village standards(cid:22)four walls, two rooms, a cement (cid:29)oor, and 57 metal roof.
Her home was also (cid:28)nanced through a Grameen microcredit home loan.
And, best of all, she told us how happy she was and how microcredit changed her life.
Although Meera holds the distinction as the (cid:28)rst microcredit customer I met, that’s the only 58 number associated with her.
1.7: Jay Milbrandt’s Journal Entries from Bangladesh: Why I Have Hope (cid:16)I’ve got this feeling of hopelessness,(cid:17) I admit to a traveling companion.
I’m here to see the hope that microcredit has brought, but our taxi has not even left Dhaka yet and I’m surrounded by the most abject poverty I have ever seen.
I’m on sensory overload.
There are so many people that the country seems ready to burst at the seams.
More than 140 million people are packed into this country, approximately the size of Iowa.
In Dhaka, garbage is everywhere(cid:22)in the streets, in the ditches.
Its obvious that the city doesnot possess theinfrastructure to serviceits 15 million inhabitants.
Judging by theintegrityof the city streets, which appear to have been paved once left alone, I’m not the least bit surprised.
If the heap of garbage is fresh, a few people would be rummaging through it(cid:22)looking for a meal, I suspect.
If the garbage was old, it served as a bed.
Audibly, Dhaka pulses with the sound of non-stop horns(cid:22)there need be no reason to use it.
Dhaka is also a city of smells.
Every street has a di(cid:27)erent smell, many of which I (cid:28)nd both unfamiliar and unappealing.
The streets are a labyrinth(cid:22)if I were lost, I could never (cid:28)nd my way back.
We round a corner and roll past a lot of wood and metal.
A salvage yard maybe?
(cid:16)Those are the slums of Dhaka,(cid:17) our guide explains.
Our taxi comes to a stop, waiting for a train to pass.
After a few seconds, there’s a bang on the window.
It’s a young boy, maybe seven years old, begging for money.
He’s yelling in Bengali and motioning to his mouth with his hand.
(cid:16)In Dhaka, people work together in an organized system of begging,(cid:17) my guide explains.
He cracks the window and tells the child to leave.
We start moving again and the child runs along until he can no longer keep pace.
Little did I know at this point, that over the succeeding two months, I would meet some of the mostdisadvantagedpeopleintheworld: thepoorest-of-the-poor, victimsoftra(cid:30)cking, prostituted women, refugees, and the illiterate.
Despite their perilous circumstances, I’m (cid:28)lled with more hope than ever before.
Why?
The positive, successful change I would come to witness(cid:22)and the great potential for continued change.
My hopelessness, however, would be relieved.
What I saw in Dhaka was probably a piece of historyforBangladesh...Duetocurrentlaws,GrameenBankisrestrictedfromoperatinginurban areas.

None of them in the chains of poverty.
This held true for practically everyone in the entire village, followed by millions more throughout Bangladesh.
Microcredit was moving the mountain of poverty before my very eyes.
Deuteronomy 15:7-8 says (cid:16)If there is a poor man among you... do not be ... tight(cid:28)sted.
...Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.
(cid:17) Is it coincidence that the word (cid:16)lend(cid:17) is used?
I believe microcredit is a sermon that every church should hear.
I believe that if Christians were to join the Muslims and Hindus of Bangladesh in the mustard seed of microcredit, 60 the mountain would move much faster.

Rice harvesting has been done this way here for hundreds of year.
Occasionally, I would see a billboard for a tractor or modern agricultural convenience, but I never saw any of them in action.
Third world technology transfer is an interesting phenomenon.
Is a cell phone really what they need?
How about drip irrigation instead?
Or maybe a rice harvester?
Grameen created an interesting microenterprise program throughout Bangladesh with village (cid:16)phone ladies.
(cid:17) A woman in each village is allowed to purchase a cell phone through a Grameen loan.
The (cid:16)phone ladies(cid:17) then sell use of their cell phone to other villagers.
The result is that the (cid:16)phone ladies(cid:17) have a very pro(cid:28)table business and villages that previously had no phone line at all now have a modern method of communication.
As traveling is di(cid:30)cult for the poor of Bangladesh, the villagers no longer have to leave if they need to communicate with a relative in another village or ask a doctor a question.
In other villages, the pro(cid:28)tability of (cid:16)phone ladies(cid:17) has diminished because a majority of villagers now own a personal cell phone.
It’s surprising how someone may not have running water, but own a nicer cell phone than I 61 do.

You control your own destiny and your life’s journey is your own so you decide!
Review: 2 In here we discussed the characteristics of an entrepreneur as possessing the following attributes: Vision: Able to create and communicate an easily understandable mission for what the new venture does in order to successfully launch a new business.
This is accomplished while inspiring others to join you in your new enterprise.
Creativity: Ability to inject imagination and uniqueness into a new business venture.
It takes skill and ingenuity to create a new venture equipped with strategies to outsmart the competition.
Focus: Able to maintain the vision of the company with unwavering diligence.
It’s very easy to get sidetracked especially if you (cid:28)nd it necessary to evolve the original vision.
Ironically, we have encountered many successful entrepreneurs who get bored easily...
Passion: Desiring to succeed under your own steam [initiative] on a business venture... Drive: Possessing intrinsic energy to accomplish the business goal even in the face of adversity.
Perseverance: Able to keep going even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.
Opportunistic Nature: Seesthepossibilitiesevenbeforetheyexist.
Cantakeadvantageofanupcom- ing trend or unite unrelated processes to create a unique business venture...
Problem Solving Ability: Thrives on coming up with solutions to complex challenges... Self-discipline: Able to be organized and regimented in pursuit of a successful business venture.
Frugality: Knows how to stretch every cent so that expenditures are as low as possible.

Empathy: Able to put yourself in another’s shoes and therefore able to show sensitivity and under- standing of what others are communicating in the start up environment... SocialResponsibility: Ethics,caringandhumanitarianismarecharacteristicsthatarecommonlyfound in today’s entrepreneurs... Spirituality: We have found that successful entrepreneurs have often devoted time to spirituality de- velopment.
Meditation and positive a(cid:30)rmations are two common examples of spirituality.
Good Timing: Able to identify a market opportunity and know when it is the optimum time to launch a new venture or expansion of an existing enterprise.
Luck: Can a person be predisposed to be lucky: Is luck a human behavior or a karmic universal 3 predisposition?
In this chapter we begin by introducing you to Costa Roussos, a young entrepreneur from the country of Cypress who is creating a global music empire.
We will share his story through an interview that Molly Lavik conducted with him and look at his entrepreneurial tendencies and attributes.
Then it is your turn to take the Entrepreneur Assessment Survey which can be used as one indication of measuring your own entrepreneurial mindset.
However, it should be noted that a true entrepreneur would never rely on a survey to determine how worthy or ready they are to become an entrepreneur.
A true entrepreneur would simply begin implementing his or her start up idea.
Truestory: CostaRoussoswasoneofmystudentsseveralyearsagoandimmediatelyInoticedsomething quitedi(cid:27)erentfromCostaandthatwashisfocusonstartingamusiccompany.
Itseemstotakeacertaintype of person to start a new venture because you do not have the security and structure of a more established company not to mention the challenges of inspiring others to join your unproven venture and to help you meet their deadlines associated with a new business.
Do you have the type of mindset that Costa seems to possess to get him through the many setbacks and challenges that faced him or any entrepreneur in the making?
If you are not sure do not worry.
When the timing seems right you will know if an entrepreneurial journey is your destiny.
And you might even become a hero to someone or maybe even an entire group of people such as how you will soon read Costa is becoming a hero to the independent music artist and music listening enthusiast.
This is your future we are talking about and it’s your decision if you have a hero’s journey ahead!
As you read Costa’s story pay particular attention to the characteristics described as his entrepreneurial mindset.
Do you possess some of the same characteristics?
Read Costa’s story to (cid:28)nd out.

Reason: Newventuresdonothavethefundingtoa(cid:27)ordthesta(cid:27)togetworkaccomplished.

5) Do you have a desire to make the world a better place that is a stronger goal for you then your desire to earn money?
Yes Undecided No Score: Ten points for Yes and 0 points for Undecided and No.
Reason: Entrepreneurs are driven by their need to create societal wealth vs self-wealth.
This desire takes precedent and priority over other goals.
This does not mean that someday you might not derive a (cid:28)nancial bonanza for the work you have been doing associated with the start up.
It just means that is not what drives you today.
6) Have you considered becoming an entrepreneur?

A values-centered leader would not sacri(cid:28)ce one important commitment for another even if it was to help a social enterprise.

In fact; a true entrepreneur does not depend on others to make their decisions.

This technique is especially important in today’s business environment, where technology gives business people so many more options than ever before.
Osterwalder goes on to say: (cid:16)Formanagersandexecutivesthismeansthattheyhaveawholenewrangeofwaystodesigntheir businesses, which results in innovative and competing business models in the same industries.
Before it used to be su(cid:30)cient to say in what industry you were for somebody to understand what your company was doing because all players had the same business model.
Today it is not su(cid:30)cient to choose a lucrative industry, but you must design a competitive business model.
In addition increased competition and rapid copying of successful business models forces all the players to continuously innovate their business model to gain and sustain a competitive edge(cid:17).
Based on his search of the literature, Osterwalder lists nine building blocks for managers to use in developinganinnovativeande(cid:27)ectivebusinessmodel.
Welistthem, alongwithsomecommentsofourown: • (cid:16)The value proposition of what is o(cid:27)ered to the market(cid:17); We have covered this issue earlier in the chapter in general, and with speci(cid:28)c reference to how Porter’s analytical tools can assist managers in generatingaviablevaluepropositionthatconsumersperceiveasonethatissuperiortowhatiso(cid:27)ered by the competition.
• (cid:16)Thetarget customer segmentsaddressedbythevalueproposition(cid:17);Managerssoonlearnthatthey cannot be all things to all people, that what appeals to one segment of the market will not appeal to another.
We will discuss this in more detail later in this chapter.

For example, do we promote the business by word of mouth, signs on a storefront, ads in a newspaper, ads on TV, ads on the Internet, or some combination of all of these?
Place refers to where the product or service is made available to the customer.
The three usual choices are in a store, through a mail-order catalog, or from an Internet website.
• (cid:16)The relationships established with customers(cid:17); In general, however, the important point is not just to acquire customers, but to serve them in a way that your business retains them as customers.
For example, it is usually much more expensive to attract a new customer to your business than it is for you to encourage a previous customer to return.
• (cid:16)The core capacities needed to make the business model possible(cid:17); This point refers to the necessity tode(cid:28)nethebasiccapabilitiesyourbusinessmusthave.

• (cid:16)The con(cid:28)guration of activities to implement the business model(cid:17); Another way of stating this is to de(cid:28)ne the business processes that your business must have in order to function properly.
• (cid:16)The partners and their motivations of coming together to make a business model happen(cid:17); Partner- ships and alliances are increasingly important in today’s world.
• (cid:16)The revenue streams generated by the business model constituting the revenue model(cid:17); In essence, this is the Price component of the (cid:16)Four P’s(cid:17).
Where does your revenue come from, what are the projections for the future, and what are the plans to sustain the necessary revenue stream as business conditions change?
• (cid:16)The cost structure resulting of the business model(cid:17).
The di(cid:27)erence between revenues and costs, of course, is your pro(cid:28)t. Without a pro(cid:28)t, it will not be possible for you to stay in business very long.
3.2.1 Examples of successful business models It may be helpful to illustrate the concept of business models with two examples, McDonalds and CEMEX.
In the case of McDonalds, it operates franchises all over the world.
Franchises are proven and successful business models whose business model (cid:16)prescription" is successful within the country of origin and even overseas.
Dominating the hamburger fast food market, McDonalds’ franchise model has also proven to be AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>43 successful since it quickly adapts and evolves according to the environment.
For example, McDonalds USA doesnothavehotsauces, butinMexicowhereMexicanslikealotofspicyfood, theyo(cid:27)erhotsauce, aswell as spicy meat put into the hamburgers.
Another successful example is the Mexican cement maker CEMEX (the world’s third largest producer of cement) that has successfully implemented and tested a standard business model called the (cid:16)CEMEX Way(cid:17) in all the plants and business units it has within more than 50 countries around the world.
Considering it operates in four di(cid:27)erent continents, except Oceania, with very di(cid:27)erent cultures and ways of thinking; countries such as the US vs Thailand, or Italy vs Bangladesh; it allows CEMEX to have a very quick response mechanism to adjust to the market demands since it has a standard operational platform.
This gives CEMEX a clear competitive advantage against its main rival giants such as Holcim and Lafarge.
Havingestablishedwhatabusinessmodelis,itisimportanttoseparateitfromthedesignofamodelac- tually implementing it, i.e.

The design is best de(cid:28)ned as the strategy.
If a business model design is not well outlined; the implementation and testing will also fail.
Taking a very simple framework from Alexander Osterwalder (Business Model Design Blogpost, June, 2006) shown in Ex- hibit3.1,businessmodeldesignisseparatedfrombusinessmodelexecution,preceded,ofcourse,bybusiness execution implementation and testing.
Companies in quadrant (cid:16)B(cid:17) with sound business model designs and e(cid:27)ective execution are successful companies, and they must focus on staying in that quadrant.
Companies in quadrant (cid:16)C(cid:17) need to re-examine their business vision and strategy, while companies in quadrant (cid:16)D(cid:17) do not have a good design but are e(cid:27)ective on its implementation; this latter usually happens with the appearance of disruptive technologies that (cid:16)shake up(cid:17) established industries and business models much the way iTunes and the iPod did.
It is very common for companies to have a sound business model design but fail to implement and test it properly (quadrant (cid:16)A(cid:17)).
Exhibit 3.1: Success = Business model design and implementation If we seek to have a successful test result from a business model it is mandatory to have a clear vision as well as a sound business model design.
The rest is a matter of testing and implementations, or (cid:16)execution(cid:17) as it is often called.
Still, successful execution is sometimes the most di(cid:30)cult task of all.

3.2.2 Model implementation/testing pre-requisites A model must have the following pre-requisites in order to implement and test it: 1.
A company owner/sponsor: Organizational models must manifest themselves as a cascading e(cid:27)ect emanating from top to bottom.
Therefore, the sponsor must either be the head of the company or other high level executive.
Usually sponsors are identi(cid:28)ed as the head of a company department.
2.
Sound budget: Testing a business model will always require funds.
The amount provided must be the one demanded by the model to test it, no more and no less.
3.
Leader: This is especially important since he/she will be the (cid:16)authority(cid:17) or responsible person who will get results.
4.
Quali(cid:28)ed human resources: The leader gets to choose his/her team.
This an important point since the leader must look for the key individuals who are up to the test and have the necessary expertise to successfully implement and test a business model.
5.
E(cid:27)ective training: With all the above accomplished, the (cid:28)nal part of the pre-requisites is training.
A business model automated or manually developed, must be operated by human beings, therefore these personswhowillactuallytestandoperatethemodelmusthavenodoubtsandbeconvincedaboutthe model’s processes and the bene(cid:28)ts of working accordingly to the business model.
3.2.3 Real expectations outcome: bene(cid:28)ts Usually companies have a tendency to be very optimistic about outcomes when a business model is tested.
Companies must be balanced between being aggressive and demanding about the model bene(cid:28)ts and be realistic when evaluating outcomes of the test.
The main bene(cid:28)ts to show when a business model is tested must be outlined around the next three aspects.
Economical: They must re(cid:29)ect tangible economical bene(cid:28)ts, such as: cost reductions or sales increases.

3.3.1 Conclusions After seeing what a business model is and the required issues involved in having a successful business model test and implementation; companies must keep in mind that there is no one time testing of a model and guarantees of success in the business world.
In our era, businesses are dynamical propelled by technology that change constantly as we move more and more into a more global world.
The keys for companies to succeedaretobealwaysfocusedandtobe(cid:29)exibleenoughtoadjustitsbusinessmodelquicklyande(cid:27)ectively according to the changing demands of customers and markets.
One of the most important functions that companies can have to anticipate competitive threats and to recognize evolving market opportunities is to have a continuing competitive intelligence function within the company.
Managementfailuresarefrequentlyassociatedwiththeinabilitytoanticipaterapidchangesinthe markets, respond to new and proliferating competition, or re-orient technologies and the strategic direction of their business toward changing customer needs and new industry standards.
Competitive intelligence is an important function in today’s rapidly changing business environment.
3.4 Consumer marketing models5 The formal use of marketing concepts is a fairly recent activity in developing economies.
In the past, most companies focused on producing products or o(cid:27)ering services without much emphasis on customers and wants.
Understanding consumer behavior was not considered to be important.
The emphasis was on the product or service per se.
Given the emergence of a global economy, however, which brought the opening of markets and increased competition, the traditional approach has changed dramatically.
Companies are increasingly focusing on what customers need and/or want.
Market-oriented companies are beginning to emerge in every developing economy in the world.
The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the importance of marketing oriented companies in developing economies, as well as identifying business models which follow a marketing model rather than a product model.
3.4.1 The product model vs the marketing model According to Philip Kotler, the product model is a management orientation that assumes that if a quality product is produced, and o(cid:27)ered to consumers at a price they (cid:28)nd to be acceptable, the company will be successful in the market place.
Another author who successfully introduced a marketing orientation is Theodore Levitt.
His orientation is sometimes referred as a (cid:16)marketing myopia(cid:17) approach since companies de(cid:28)netheirbusinessintermsofproductsandnotintermsofcustomerneedsandwants.
Forexample, acar manufacturermaythinktheyareinthe(cid:16)carbusiness(cid:17) whiletheyare,infact,competinginthetransportation industry.
Undertheproductmodel,managementfocusesondevelopinghighqualityproductswhichcanbesoldat therightprice,butwithinsu(cid:30)cientattentiontowhatitisthatcustomersreallyneedandwant.
Forexample, Apple determined that what customers wanted was the ability to purchase music one song at a time rather than purchase an entire CD with 16 tracks, only three of which were really wanted.
They subsequently developed and introduced the iPod and iTunes online store which revolutionized the way consumers buy music.
In the meantime, traditional producers of traditional CDs lost market share to Apple, which had a much better understanding of how to satisfy consumers.
The premises implicit in the product model are: 5Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35346/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>46 CHAPTER 3. BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETING:AN OVERVIEW • Consumers buy products more than solutions.
• Consumers are interested basically in product quality.
• Consumers recognize product quality and di(cid:27)erences in performance alternative products.
• Consumers choose between di(cid:27)erent products based on getting the best quality for the money.
• Themaintaskoforganizationistokeepimprovingqualityandreducingcostaskeyfactorstomaintain and attract customers.
The product model used to be applied in developing or closed economies where few, if any choices were available.
Advantages of the product model are that the cost of determining consumer preferences and the development of new products and services are minimized or eliminated because consumers are in some way captive.
By way of example, compare the automobile industry in developed countries to the automobile industry in the Soviet Bloc countries prior to 1989.
Customers had a wide variety of automobile models to choose from while citizens in the Eastern Bloc had few.
The latter was operating on a product model rather than a marketing model.
Disadvantages of the product model are that as soon as a company could o(cid:27)er a product more oriented to satisfy customers(cid:1) needs and desires the companies oriented to products will lose the most if not all of its market share.
The traditional CD companies referred to above are a good example of this.
Insummary, marketorientationisessentiallyacustomerorientation.
Understandingcustomerneedslies at the core of the marketing concept.
3.5 The marketing model6 The marketing model is a management orientation which maintains that the fundamental task of the orga- nization is to determine needs and wants of customers in the target market and adapt the organization as a whole to satisfy their customers more e(cid:27)ectively and e(cid:30)ciently.
Satisfying customers more e(cid:30)ciently and e(cid:27)ectively than competitive companies increases the chances of the organization’s success.
The marketing model is an approach whereby companies create value for their customers.
This concept can be understood by applying it in the so called Value Chain Model introduced by Michael Porter.
An application on how this model is applied in marketing is shown Exhibit 3.2 below.
Exhibit 3.2: Value chain of marketing • First, you need to know and understand your customers’ needs and wants.
• Based on your understanding of their needs, through research and development you must develop an appropriate product or service that ful(cid:28)lls those needs.
• Based on your engineering capabilities you must de(cid:28)ne your manufacturing process that delivers the right product in the most e(cid:30)cient and economical way.
• Finally, the product or service must be delivered at the right time and place.
A simple way to understand the creation of value to customers is by examining the following equation: Value = Bene(cid:28)ts / Price 6Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35349/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>47 Value is created by increasing bene(cid:28)ts to the customers.
For this reason, (cid:16)bene(cid:28)ts(cid:17) is speci(cid:28)ed in the numerator of this equation (the higher the bene(cid:28)ts, the higher the perceived value by the customer); on the other hand, (cid:16)price(cid:17) is placed in the denominator since the higher the price the lower the perceived value.
Now you must understand how value is created for your customers.
To do so, managers use a technique called the (cid:16)Marketing Mix(cid:17) (commonly called the four P(cid:1)s) • Product: What is the product/satisfactor that best ful(cid:28)lls my customer’s needs?
• Price: What should be the appropriate price for this product that re(cid:29)ects not only its cost but also its bene(cid:28)ts to compete with other products in the same segment or substitute products?
• Place: In what markets should the company o(cid:27)er the product?
• Promotion: How should the company promote the product or satisfactor?
One of the main advantages of the marketing model approach is that the company tries to be near the customer’s needs by understanding them and therefore developing products that ful(cid:28)ll or exceed them in the best possible way.
On the other hand, and especially in developing economies, the main disadvantage of this model is the cost in obtaining the information needed to understand the customer.
3.6 Identifying market needs7 As mentioned previously, the essence of applying the marketing model lies in the (cid:28)nding of needs and (cid:28)lling them wisely.
We will assess this issue of (cid:16)Identifying market needs(cid:17) by introducing a conceptual framework known as Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.
This model focuses in the psychological features that explain the basic dimensions of human needs.
3.6.1 Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a staple of sociology and psychology courses, provides a useful framework for understanding how and why local products and brands are being selected and additionally how they can be extended beyond home country borders.
Maslow hypothesized that people’s desires can be arranged into a hierarchy of (cid:28)ve needs.
As an individual ful(cid:28)ls needs at each level, he or she progresses to higher levels (see Exhibit 3 Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs).
At the most basic level of human existence, physiological and safety needs must be met.
People need food, clothing, and shelter, and a product that meets these basic needshaspotentialforintroductionintoaspeci(cid:28)cmarket.
However, thebasichumanneedtoconsumefood and liquids is not the same thing as wanting or preferring a hamburger and a soft drink.
An additional consideration is that preferences are deeply embedded in local cultures.
Responding to such di(cid:27)erences has required the creation of products and brands for speci(cid:28)c regional or country markets.
Mid-level needs in the hierarchy include self-respect, self-esteem, and the esteem of others.
These social needs, which can create a powerful internal motivation, driving demand for status-oriented products, cut across the various stages of country development.
Luxury goods marketers are especially skilled at catering to esteem needs on a global basis.
Some consumers (cid:29)aunt their wealth by buying expensive products and brands that others will notice.
Such behaviour is referred to as (cid:16)conspicuous consumption(cid:17) or (cid:16)luxury badging(cid:17).
Any company with a premium product or brandthat has proven itselfin alocal marketbyful(cid:28)lling esteemneeds shouldconsider devising a strategy for taking the product global.

BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETING:AN OVERVIEW Exhibit 3.3: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Source: http://www.provenmodels.com/19/image8 3.6.2 Identifying customer’s wants successfully A process to determine the actual needs of consumers requires the identi(cid:28)cation of the market factors that produce them.
In this process companies should (cid:28)nd real consumption motivators that eventually evolve into product o(cid:27)erings.
Furthermore, a correct business de(cid:28)nition leads to a natural market orientation; for instance, Charles Revson famous quote (cid:16)in the factory we make cosmetics; in the drug store we sell hope(cid:17) (www.thinkexist.com)madepossibleforthecompanytodevelopcosmeticproductsbasedonwomen’shopes rather than product features.
Several potential pitfalls should be avoided.
First, the natural tendency to impose a personal point of view when launching a new product or entering a new market.
Second, simple imitation about competitors’ moves.
Third, lack of su(cid:30)cient research and market knowledge to produce market proved ideas.
A framework has been proposed to align customer’s needs and wants with companies capabilities.
ThisframeworkwasintroducedbySherriDorfmaninher2005marketingarticleentitled(cid:16)What do Customers Really, Really Want(cid:17).
In the article aforementioned, Dorfman proposes a three-step process to develop a natural market orien- tation: Step 1.
Discovery: Finding out what customers really need To learn about customer needs and priorities, to identify opportunities in the company to ful(cid:28)ll these needs, and to create new or enhanced product o(cid:27)erings.

Step 2.
De(cid:28)nition: Shaping the o(cid:27)erings to meet customer needs In this step, Dorfman proposes prioritizing features and bene(cid:28)ts identi(cid:28)ed by clients, suppliers, and customers.
Di(cid:27)erent qualitative research techniquessuchasin-depthinterviews,ethnographies,andfocusgroupsessionspermittheidenti(cid:28)cation of the core market needs.
Step 3.
Validation: Insuring your o(cid:27)erings (cid:28)t into your customer’s world.
Further communication with consumers validate the (cid:28)nal de(cid:28)nition of a market based product or service.
This validation takes placeasprototypesareassessedbyconsumerstoidentifypotentialproblemsandtosmoothoutdesign issues.
8http://www.provenmodels.com/19/image AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>49 All these models take into account the so-called end consumer perspective, which implies that consumers buying, using, or recommending the products are the driving force behind successful marketing e(cid:27)orts.
However, there are other marketing perspectives that assume that organizations of many sorts, given their importance in the overall size of the global economy are the real forces behind markets’ success.
This implies that marketing e(cid:27)orts should be aimed at understanding their behaviour as consumption entities, and use this knowledge to develop marketing strategies.
3.7 Business to business marketing models9 3.7.1 Models of industry attractiveness; the strategic perspective In order to be successful in business, we must understand what our customer’s needs and wants are and delivertheminane(cid:30)cientandpro(cid:28)tablemanner.
Inordertodoso, wemustalsounderstandtheindustries in which the companies are immersed and what makes them attractive from the general point of view.
Industry attractiveness was initially described by Michael Porter in his book, Competitive Strategy (Porter 1980).
Porter’s well-known Five Forces Model is often used as an analytical tool by companies when they are deciding whether or not to enter a particular industry.
According to Porter, what makes an industry attractive or unattractive is determined by 5 forces: 1.
Rivalry: This force is measured by how intense the rivalry/competition relationship in an industry is.
The factors a(cid:27)ecting rivalry are: number of competitors, slow market growth, low levels of product di(cid:27)erentiation, how aggressive competing companies are, etc.
For example, retailing has always had thereputationofbeingahighlycompetitiveindustry, whiletherailroadindustryisthoughttobeless competitive.
2.
Threatofsubstitutes: InPorter’smodel, substituteproductsrefertoproductsthatcanbesubstituted for your own.
Substitute products can be found within own or other industries.
For example, if you decide to start an inter-city bus company, you have to consider all the other options your customers havetogetfromonecitytoanother,forinstance,citytrains,smallshuttleservice,sharedprivatecars, among others.
3.
Buyer power: The power of buyers is the impact that customers have on a producing industry.
In general, when buyer power is strong, the buyer has the ability to set the price because usually there areveryfewbuyersandmanysuppliers.
Grainfarmersareoftenusedasanexample.
Inmostcountries, therearemanysmallfarmerswhogrowgrain,butfewlargebuyerswhohavethepowertosettheprice a farmer receives.
4.
Barrierstoentry: Barrierstoentryareuniqueo(cid:27)eringsofcompaniesinanindustrythatanycompany wishingtoenterthatindustrymustbepreparedtoovercome.
Examplesfromdevelopedeconomiesare online banking and ATM services for banks and frequent (cid:29)yer programs for airlines.
In many cases, development of these expected products or services is quite expensive for a new entrant, and, thus, it s a barrier to entry.
5.
Supplier power: Suppliers are powerful when there are few suppliers for a company to purchase neces- sary items from.
In a situation where there are few suppliers, it is typically di(cid:30)cult for a buyer to get a lower price from another supplier.
An example is the oil industry, where they are many buyers, but relativelyfewsuppliers,andmostofthesuppliersaremembersoftheOPECcartelwhichsetscommon production quotas, thereby controlling the market price for oil.
MichaelPorterdevelopedtwoothertoolsthatarewidelyusedbyorganizationsintheirapproachtomarkets: Three Generic Strategies and the Value Chain.
Porter postulated that a (cid:28)rm should adopt only one of three generic strategies.
They are illustrated in : 9Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35356/1.4/>.

For example, the originalVolkswagenautomobilefocusedinabroadlow-costmarket.
Asamatteroffact,thewordinGerman means(cid:16)PeoplesCar(cid:17),indicatingitwasmeanttobea(cid:27)ordablebyeveryone.
Agoodexampleofadi(cid:27)erentiated automobile is the BMW.
People pay more for a BMW because of the (cid:16)conspicuous consumption(cid:17) or (cid:16)luxury badging aspects(cid:17) they have managed to create in peoples’ minds, not necessarily because the BMW is actually worth 30 per cent more than a comparable automobile from Cadillac or Nissan.
An example of a car positioned towards a low cost niche is the Mazda Miata, a two-seat sports car that costs much less than comparable cars.
Finally, you can consider the Hummer as a car that appeals to a di(cid:27)erentiated market niche.
Porter’s other widely-used tool is the Value Chain, which is used to model the (cid:28)rm as a chain of value- creating activities or processes.
Porter identi(cid:28)ed a set of interrelated generic processes common to a wide range of (cid:28)rms.
He divided them into primary activities and support activities, as illustrated in Exhibit 3.5.
10http://www.provenmodels.com/27/image AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>51 Exhibit 3.5: Value chain Source: http://www.provenmodels/26/image11 Theprimaryactivitiesinthevaluechainare: inboundlogistics,operations,outboundlogistics,marketing and sales, and service.
The support activities are procurement, technology development and research and development, human resource management, and (cid:28)rm infrastructure (top management).
The primary value chain activities are interrelated, to the extent that they can be formed with high quality and low cost, the (cid:28)rm will be able to have value-added that will be returned to the (cid:28)rm as pro(cid:28)t. As an example of the way that primary value activities are interrelated, suppose that the inbound logistics process does not do well in identifying raw materials of poor quality.
This will cause problems with the next process, operations, and it may cause problems as far down the value chain as service after the sale.
The value chain is, thus, a useful tool for analysing a company’s business processes and searching for ways to lower costs, improve e(cid:30)ciency or search for process innovations.
3.7.2 Other Strategic Models There are many other strategic models used by companies to help them formulate their overall business and marketing strategies.
Three of best known models are the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix, the McKinsey Matrix, and Larry Downe three forces.
Each of these models is described below.
11http://www.provenmodels/26/image AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>52 CHAPTER 3. BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETING:AN OVERVIEW 3.7.2.1 The BCG matrix The BCG matrix method is based on the product life cycle theory that can be used to determine what priorities should be given in the product portfolio of a Strategic Business Unit (SBU).
To ensure long-term value creation, a company should have a portfolio of products that contains both high-growth products in need of cash inputs and low-growth products that generate a lot of cash.
This model can be explained in two dimensions: relative market share and market growth.
The basic idea behind this model is that the larger the market share a product has relative to its competitors or the faster the product’s market grows, the better it is for the company in an economic sense.
The key components of the matrix are illustrated in Exhibit 3.6 and discussed below: Exhibit 3.6: BDG Matrix Source: http://www.quickmba.com/strategy/matrix/bcg/12 1.
Stars(highmarketgrowth,highrelativemarketshare).
Theseareproductsthatrequirelargeamounts of cash and are also leaders in the business and therefore they should also generate large amounts of cash.
They are frequently roughly in balance on net cash (cid:29)ow.
2.
Cash Cows (low market growth, high relative market share).
These are products that generate high amounts of pro(cid:28)t and cash, and because of the low growth, investments needed should be low.
3.
Givenitscharacteristics,companiesshouldavoidandminimizethenumberofproductsinthiscategory.
If the product does not deliver cash, it may be discontinued.
4.
Question Marks (high market growth, low relative market share).
These products have the worst cash characteristics of all, because of high cash demands and low returns due to low market share.
If nothing is done to change the market share, question marks will simply absorb great amounts of cash andlater,asthegrowthstops,itmaybecomeadog.
So,managersshouldeitherinvestheavilyinorder to improve market share, or sell o(cid:27)/invest nothing and generate whatever cash is possible.
12http://www.quickmba.com/strategy/matrix/bcg/ AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>53 3.7.2.2 The McKinsey matrix The McKinsey matrix is a later and more advanced form of the BCG Matrix.
It has several di(cid:27)erences with BCG’s matrix, as discussed below.
It is illustrated in Exhibit 6.
Exhibit 3.7: McKinsey Matrix Source: http://www.quickmba.com/strategy/matrix/bcg/13 1.
Market (Industry) attractiveness replaces market growth as the dimension of industry attractiveness.
Market attractiveness includes a broader range of factors other than just the market growth rate that can determine the attractiveness of an industry/market.
For example, market attractiveness could be determined using Porter’s (cid:28)ve forces model.
2.
Competitivestrengthreplacesmarketshareasthedimensionbywhichthecompetitivepositionofeach Strategic Business Unit is assessed.
Competitive strength likewise includes a broader range of factors other than just the market share that can determine the competitive strength of a Strategic Business Unit.
3.
Finally the McKinsey matrix works with a 3x3 grid, while the BCG Matrix has only 2x2.
This also allows for more insight in the analysis of the business.

BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETING:AN OVERVIEW who use the Five Forces Model and who base their thinking on today’s industry structure would never see these changes coming in time.
Globalization: Improvements in distribution logistics and communications have allowed nearly all busi- nesses to buy, sell, and cooperate on a global level.
Customers, meanwhile, have the chance to shop around and compare prices globally.
As a result, even locally oriented mid-sized companies (cid:28)nd themselves in a global market, even if they do not export or import themselves.
In addition, global and networked markets impose new requirements on organizations’ strategies.
It is not enough any more to position oneself as a price-leader or quality-leader (as Porter suggests in his Generic Strategies model).
Rather, competitive advantages emerge now from the ability to develop lasting relationships to more mobile custumers and to manage far-reaching networks of partners for mutual advantage.

Fueledbythenewopportunities provided by information technology, organizations in these industries were able and forced to completely restructure their businesses and to be on the lookout for new opportunities and competitive threats.
For example, traditional land line telephone companies that did not enter the wireless telephony market found themselves with a shrinking customer base.
This is because young people frequently use only cell phones now and do not bother to have a land line phone in their homes.

3.1: Establishing that a market exists: Market research Understanding the market’s needs, competitors’ strategies, and to obtain information for decision making, it is imperative to do market research.
Next, we will introduce a case that demonstrates the value of market research to any (cid:28)rm willing to spend time and resources using it.
After this example is introduced, two sections are developed.
One, introducing the market research process, and second, the general guidelines on how to conduct a market research study.
A Candy Store Company with subsidiaries in New York and other large cities in US was inter- ested in opening a store in Monterrey, Mexico.
The New York subsidiary is located in one of the most visited areas of Manhattan.
It is housed on three (cid:29)oors, a huge locale focused on selling all type of candies.
Every (cid:29)oor has a thematic decoration, characters, and games, depending on the type of candies sold on that (cid:29)oor.
Inside they even have a co(cid:27)ee shop.
They employ a high price strategy, and most of their visitors are tourists (a di(cid:27)erentiated niche in Porter’s Three Generic Strategies model).
TheplanforthestorelocatedinMonterreywasrecentlycompleted.
Itwillbeabigstore,almost the same size as the one in New York, with high prices and focused on high-income consumers.
Additionaltothethematicareasde(cid:28)nedintheNewYorkstore, thisstorewillhaveaspacefor(cid:16)old candy brands(cid:17) to attract older consumers.
The store will also have a section for local brands.
A consultant was hired for advising the owners on how to achieve the plan.
His (cid:28)rst advice was to do some market research to understand the real opportunity.
The market research results were astonishing: there was no market in Monterrey.
Consumers loved the idea, but they were not willing to pay the high prices or even to visit the store more than once a month and being Monterrey city with a small amount of tourists there would not be enough revenue to maintain the business.

AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>55 The investment for opening the store in Monterrey was about USD 1 million dollars.
The potential entrepreneurs spent around USD 10 thousand in marketing research, which kept them from making a bad investment.
The market research process There is an inherent risk when trying to expand the market, launching a new product, or starting a new business.
De(cid:28)ning that a market exists for your business idea will help in reducing that risk.
You may think that with a bunch of collected data and facts you will be able to decide whether or not to go forward with your idea.
But the challenge is not just collecting the data, but how to transform it and how to use it.
Market research will support you in collecting, transforming, and getting meaning from the data.
Some of the reasons why market research is so important are: 1.
The cost of errors.
Launching and selling a new product that is not successful in the market- place could cause you to lose your entire investment.
2.
Conducting market research will help you identify new trends, market segments, and niches.
3.
Market research will end up saving you time by developing focused strategies based on a better understanding of your customers.
Market research involves all the activities that allow the company to obtain the required data for decision support.
Market research is collecting, interpreting, and communicating the information used for strategic marketing.
The most typical approaches are to conduct a tailored, one-time market research study as described below, or to use readily available information such as the periodical information provided by companies like AC Nielsen.
This section will describe how to conduct a market research study.
The main steps are: 1.
Identify and de(cid:28)ne the problem: The (cid:28)rst step is de(cid:28)ning the target or problem to solve for your market research.
Most of the time it is more than one problem to solve, but you should prioritize.
The right de(cid:28)nition of the problem should allow us to obtain the needed data.
2.
De(cid:28)ne the objectives: The objective should answer the question of what you want to obtain from the market research.
In this step you should de(cid:28)ne the scope and action plan.
Devel- oping the objectives should consist of establishing a budget, understanding the environment, developing the approach to analysis, and formulating hypotheses.
3.
Developing a research plan: Based upon a well-de(cid:28)ned problem and objectives, the frame- work for the research plan should be apparent.
This step requires the greatest amount of thought, time, and expertise.
It includes incorporating knowledge from secondary informa- tion, analysis, qualitative research, methodology selection, question measurement and scale selection, questionnaire design, sample design and size, and determining the data analysis to be performed.
4.
Collectingthedata: Thisisthepointatwhichthe(cid:28)nalizedquestionnaire(surveyinstrument) is used in gathering information among the chosen sample segments.
There are a variety of data collection methodologies to consider.
For instance: Computer Assisted Telephone In- terviewing, MailSurvey, InternetSurvey, Mallintercepts, Traditionaltelephoneinterviewing, Internet panel, home panel, among others.
5.
Performingdataanalysis: Thisistheprocessofanalyzingthecollecteddata,andtransforming complextosimpleinformation.
Lesscomplexanalysisonsmallerdatasetscanbehandledwith anyofanumberofpersonalcomputero(cid:30)cesuitetools,likespreadsheets,whilemorecomplex analysis and larger data sets require dedicated market research analysis software.
Types of analysis that might be performed are simple frequency distributions, crosstab analysis, multiple regression (driver analysis), cluster analysis, factor analysis, perceptual mapping (multidimensional scaling), structural equation modeling and data mining 6.
Reporting and presentation: This is one of the most important steps.
All business critical information and knowledge that comes from your market research investment are limited by AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>56 CHAPTER 3. BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETING:AN OVERVIEW how they are presented to decision makers.
There are as many reporting styles as there are research reports, but some are de(cid:28)nitely better than others, and there are de(cid:28)nitely trends to be aware of.
It is important to mention that market research by itself does not arrive at solutions or marketing decisions.
It does not even guarantee your business success.
However, when conducting a well- executed market research study you can reduce the uncertainty in the decision-making process, increasing at the same time the probability and magnitude of success.
To illustrate these concepts in a live situation, we have included a discussion of how a market research study was performed to determine the potential market for a new concept for funeral services in Monterrey, Mexico.
3.9 Market research to determine the potential market for funeral services in Monterrey, Mexico15 Background: A group of investors thought about developing a new enterprise concept of funeral services in Monterrey, Mexico.
The main idea was to o(cid:27)er improved funeral services, satisfying a need not yet covered in the city.
Concept of the project: The company will o(cid:27)er funeral services to people of socioeconomic level A and B+.
Thenewfuneralserviceswillinclude: Saleofco(cid:30)nsorcrematoryurns,luxurytransportation,memorial vigils, chapel, (cid:29)owers and cafeteria services, religious ceremonies, wide parking with valet parking service, legal requirements, condolences via Internet, publication of brief letters, private room for the family with foods at the request of the client and pre-arranged funeral plans.
The architecture of the place will include many green areas, big spaces and a quiet and peaceful atmo- sphere.

Objectives: • To understand if a potential market exists for a funeral services enterprise in Monterrey City.
• Identify current speci(cid:28)c needs for the sector.
• Evaluate project concept.
• Evaluate project location.
• Evaluate project name and logo.
• Methodology: Stage I Qualitative study: 2 sessions group with the following pro(cid:28)le: Session 1: Men between 35 and 50 years of age, from socioeconomic level A and +B who experience in the process of hiring funeral services in the last year.
Session2: Womenbetween35and50yearsofagefromsocioeconomiclevelAand+Bwhohadexperience with the process of hiring funeral services in the last year.
Stage II Quantitative study: The size of sample was of 472 personal interviews to men and women of socioeconomic level A and +B, ages between 35 and 60 years old, who live in Monterrey and its metropolitan area.
Main (cid:28)ndings and conclusions: 15Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35644/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>57 In this research we found an important opportunity at the funeral logistics services since 76 per cent of the interviewed people consider that it is necessary to have a company of this type in the city, since at the moment the companies that o(cid:27)er these services have many opportunity areas.
(cid:16)Cedillas del Toro(cid:17), the most important funeral services enterprise up to date show us some opportunity areas as: lack of parking, mentioned by 15 per cent of the sample; the lack of a comfortable cafeteria, mentioned by 10 per cent of the sample; small chapel, mentioned by 7 per cent of the sample; and the temperature of the very cold climate, mentioned by 7 per cent of the sample, among others.
In the qualitative study, people interviewed mentioned what they dislike about (cid:16)Cedillas del Toro(cid:17) is that the memorial vigils have a common area for visits in where you can not identify whom each person is accompanying, turning it very informal.
Thechallengesthatwefoundatthesecondmoreimportantfuneralservicescompanyofthecity,(cid:16)Cedillas Carmelo(cid:17) were: high price (20 per cent of mentions), lack of facilities for handicaps (crowded elevating) (15 per cent of mentions) and poor availability of chapels (only three) (10 per cent of mentions), among others.
Theconceptofthenewfuneralservicesenterprisewasverywellacceptedbymostofthepeopleinterviewed (70 per cent), mainly the idea of having a person who facilitates all the funeral proceedings, seems to be very helpful and important in those moments of grief.
The proposed location for the new funeral services enterprise had an acceptance of 80 per cent of the peopleinterviewed,mainlybecausetheyarenearthemostimportantchurchesofthecitywitheasyaccesses.
The options of names people interviewed preferred were (cid:16)Cedillas Marian(cid:17) or (cid:16)Cedillas de Maria(cid:17) by 45 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.
The people interviewed in the qualitative study suggested some ideas to improve the concept mentioned like: To have a private area with all the comforts (telephone, computer, air condition, bath) for the family who does not wish to receive visits, that have a pleasant decoration (not funeral), and personal attention, among others.
Thanks to this market study, the investors could corroborate the idea that a funeral service enterprise in Monterrey may be a good business opportunity.
In addition they could delineate the concept according to the market.
Thefuneral businesshas beenaneconomic successsofar, thanks toits clearde(cid:28)nitionof itsmission and its market oriented philosophy: always searching for and delivering an excellent service to its customers.

4.2.1 Moving from a one-person band to an orchestra Most businesses start like a one-person band.
The owner plays all the instruments, some better than others, but all out of necessity.
Like any musical ensemble, a small business includes many roles.
In the beginning, the owners are often thebestatmakingordeliveringtheproductorservice.
Sincetheyhavethemostatstake,theyoftenassume a wide variety of roles, including sales, accounting, and much more.
Through a combination of skill, planning, talent, and perhaps luck, some businesses manage to grow.
This growth leads to new and changing roles in the business for everyone, including the owner.
Of all the roles an owner has in the business, perhaps the most important one is to be the designer for the business.
In the role of chief designer, business owners have three critical duties: 1Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35364/1.4/>.

HOW TO ORGANIZE AND LEAD AN ENTREPRENEURIAL 60 VENTURE • Provide the vision and direction for the company.
Owners set the direction for the values of the company, develop its product and service strategies, and set the tone for its relationships with customers.
• Develop and re(cid:28)ne processes and procedures.
Owners design the (cid:16)business model(cid:17), or the big picture formulas and processes of doing business.
Then, they must (cid:28)ll in the details by analyzing processes and (cid:28)nding bottlenecks.
• Create the organization’s human resource structure.
Owners identify the positions and types of people the business needs, and then they (cid:28)nd the people to (cid:28)ll those roles.
In the words of Jim Collins, author of the bestseller Good to Great, (cid:16)Get the right people on the bus, the wrong people o(cid:27) the bus, and get everyone in the right seats.

4.3 Organizational issues3 4.3.1 Organizational issues Entrepreneurs typically know when their company needs a structural overhaul.
The owner can no longer juggle all the critical day-to-day activities.
Important decisions are delayed, customer contact su(cid:27)ers, em- ployees feel overwhelmed and confused about their and others’ roles in the organization.
As the employee count rises, someone other than the owner has to manage and be empowered to make critical decisions.
The stress generated by these various dysfunctional symptoms eventually reaches a point where the owner has to decide to either continue growing the business (but in a more managed way) or to restrict its growth to e(cid:27)ectively manage the (cid:28)rm single-handedly.

In this scenario, each waiter is only concerned with getting his or her order complete and delivered.
The dessert might arrive before the entrØe or appetizer.
And if the entrØe is delivered cold, the other waiters cannot help.
Finally, once the meal is over, all the waiters have to get together to (cid:28)gure out the bill.
Like Acme Security, the restaurant’s structure made it di(cid:30)cult, if not impossible, to deliver quality service.

Stage 1: In a one-person operation, the owner does everything: sales, bookkeeping, marketing, produc- tion and so on.
Many (cid:28)rms remain one-person operations inde(cid:28)nitely due to the owner’s family obligations, (cid:28)nancial constraints, or contentment with the status quo.
Stage 2: As more people join an organization, the business owner becomes a player-coach.
The en- trepreneur continues to perform day-to-day tasks, but along with other employees.
So the owner assumes additional employee management duties such as hiring, scheduling, supervising, and payroll.
Stage 3: Firms reach a major milestone in organizational development when they add an additional levelofsupervision.
Theownerrelinquishessomedirectcontrolandbeginsworkingthroughanintermediary layer of professional managers.
Stage 4: As a company adds more layers of management and processes, it also adopts written policies, budgets, standardized personnel practices, organizational charts, job descriptions, and control protocols.

However,donot assume that a growing business must at one point or another assume one of these structures.
Rather, smart entrepreneurs constantly tweak their organizations to remain agile to take advantage of new opportunities or respond to new challenges.
Sometimes the changes necessary to move from a small to larger business require gut wrenching decisions: for example, personnel that might have played key roles in establishing a new business might not be the right (cid:28)t for a larger, more structured organization.

Functional departmentation takes advantage of employees’ specialization.
Employees with similar train- ing, education, skills, or equipment work together and under a supervisor responsible for that department’s activities.
Because one supervisor typically oversees a major area of activity, functional departmentation also facilitates coordination.
For instance in a larger retail operation, one marketing department supervisor would control and coordinate the work of buyers, merchandisers and the sales force so that information and activities of each function would be more e(cid:30)cient and productive.

Since a certain amount of expertise or training is required to handle complicated processes or complex machinery, activities that involve the use of specialized equipment may be grouped into a separate department.
This form of departmentation is similar to functional departmentation.

When work teams function well, the need for a large number of supervisors decreases.
4.4.1.4 Departmentation by matrix Some (cid:28)rms are organized by using a mix of departmentation types (matrix organization).
It is not unusual to see (cid:28)rms that utilize the function and project organization combination.
The same is true for process and project as well as other combinations.
For instance, a large hospital could have an accounting de- partment, surgery department, marketing department, and a satellite center project team that make up its organizational structure.
• Once the bases for departmentation are determined, another problem of structure immediately arises concerninghowmanydepartmentsorhowmanyindividualworkersshouldbeplacedunderthedirection of one manager.
This is referred to as a span of management or span of control issue.
A number of factors should be considered when deciding upon a span of control: · the complexity of the subordinates’ jobs and need for interaction with management · the complexity of the supervisors’ jobs · the competence of the supervisors and subordinates · the number and nature of the supervisors’ other interactions with non-subordinates · the extent to which sta(cid:27) assistants provide support.

Again, various factors including the owner’s management style, might a(cid:27)ect what type of structure a business assumes.
4.5.1 Flat organizations Flat organizations follow the decentralized approach, or organic system.
There are fewer levels of manage- ment which creates an environment for faster growth and response between all levels.
Organizations that followthistypeofstructurehavewiderspansofsupervisorycontrolandhavemorehorizontalcommunication.
This type of structure promotes task interdependence with less attention to formal procedures.
More decisions are made at the middle levels of the organization.
They are less bureaucratic and less structured.
Externally, the organization as a whole becomes more adaptable to its market and can quickly react to changes.
Internally, the organization as a whole encourages more participation between all levels of the organization.
As a result, all levels have the potential of working more closely together which enhances a closer working environment with better communication and creativity.
Exhibit 4.6: Flat organization 4.5.2 Tall organizations A tall structure is a more formal, bureaucratic organization or mechanistic system.
In this environment, multiple levels of management control decision making processes and employees within the organization.
When numerous levels become involved in daily operations, decision-making tends to be more impersonal.
Sincethistypeofstructurehasmorelevels,thedivisionoflaborismuchmorespecialized.
Departmentscan become more compartmentalized, which increases the communication within them, but does not lend itself to communication with other departments.

There are two communication models that are utilized(cid:22)centralized and decentralized.
Again, each style can be e(cid:27)ective depending on the environment and each has its advantages and disadvantages, as are outlined below.
4.6.1 Centralized Centralized organizations require communications (cid:29)ow through a central person or location.
Single leaders areprominentandhaveagreatdealofdecision-makingpower.
Thesepersonshaveaccesstomoreinformation and can therefore exercise a great deal of in(cid:29)uence over group members by controlling the (cid:29)ow of critical information.
Onedisadvantagetocentralizedcommunicationisthatastheorganizationgrows,theamountofinforma- tion can overwhelm the central hub (person or department) that processes this information.
One advantage to the centralized approach is that it encourages standardized processes that typically result in cost savings and better quality control.
4.6.2 Decentralized Decentralized organizations tend to utilize many channels of information (cid:29)ow, allowing for more open com- munication between group members.
This model is more conducive to solving complex problems.
One of the major advantages to decentralized communication is that problems and processes can be solved and changed in a timely manner.
Also, the needs of customers and employees are more easily and quickly met because fewer levels of management are involved.
A major disadvantage to a decentralized organization is that departments can easily lose sight of the organization’s common mission.
To ensure organizations stay on task, upper management should maintain open lines of communication with local management.

HOW TO ORGANIZE AND LEAD AN ENTREPRENEURIAL 68 VENTURE 4.7 Chapter summary9 So how does an owner begin to digest and pick between all the choices (function, product, process, project or matrix structure, (cid:29)at versus tall, centralized versus decentralized) available when it comes to organizing a business?
To design a better business, owners should take these steps: • Schedule time to work on the business.
This applies to start-ups and established businesses.
There is an old saying, (cid:16)If you are chopping wood, you need to take some time to sharpen the axe(cid:17).
• Write everything down.
Document all job descriptions, processes, and procedures, and then re(cid:28)ne the processes so the result is reliable and high quality output.
In his book The E-Myth, Michael Gerber makes the case that entrepreneurs should build and document their business as if it were the (cid:28)rst of 5,000 locations, even if they never plan to expand.
• Try to become unimportant to the day-to-day operations.
A business that would cease if something happenedtotheownerhasverylittlevaluetoapotentialbuyer.
Ifthebusinessisaturn-keyoperation with documented and reliable processes, it has much greater value to the current owner and future buyers.
• Be prepared to change roles as the business grows.
As time goes on, the amount of time an owner spends working in the business should decrease.
He or she should embrace the role of a CEO who is working on the business.
In the introduction of this chapter we likened the business owners’ role to a musician.
In the early stages of the business, the owner had to play every instrument.
But if the business is to grow and prosper, the owner must become the conductor of an evolving orchestra.
If an orchestra has good musicians, excellent sheet music, and a talented conductor, the result is beautiful music.
4.1: US legal issues Because laws regulating business vary greatly by country and locale, entrepreneurs should pick a legal entity for their business in consultation with a local attorney that specializes in business law.
Thelegalissuesdiscussedbelowre(cid:29)ectgeneralpracticesintheUnitedStateswherelawsgoverning business vary not only by state, but by local jurisdictions within states.
Businesses activities are organized either by individuals, couples or groups of people.
Businesses with one owner (the most common and referred to as sole proprietorships in the United States) can be launched without any legal assistance, and depending on the location, with or without certain permits.
Businesseswithmultipleownerstypicallywriteoutexplicitguidelinesregardinginvestmentand management issues using one of several types of legal agreements designed speci(cid:28)cally for business organizations.
Thus, one of the (cid:28)rst decisions facing new business owners is deciding what legal entity to use for their business.
That decision-making process typically weighs the following issues: (a) how much time or involvement in the business is required (b) what skills are required (c) degree of risk associated with the business (d) amount of capital needed (e) tax regulations on labor and income earned by the business In the United States, there are four basic types of business operations: 1.
Sole proprietorships A sole proprietorship is an individual owner of a business (with or without employees).
This type of operation is the simplest to form, and the single owner, or sole proprietor, may work as much or as little time as desired.
The sole proprietor is generally held accountable for all products and/or services produced by the business, as well 9Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35384/1.4/>.

Sincetheowner’spersonalliabilityextendswellbeyond amounts invested in the business or even beyond assets purchased by the business, this type of operation is considered high risk.
The amount of capital required to start a sole proprietorship is generally minimal.
In addition to sole ownership of all assets and liabilities, the proprietor bene(cid:28)ts by receiving all pro(cid:28)ts, which in the United States are taxed as part of the owner’s total personal income.
The sole proprietor may employ workers or engage independent contractors to increase skills available, but the business ceases to exist upon the owner’s death.
Asoleproprietorbusinesscanbeorganizedatanytimeintoadi(cid:27)erentlegalentity.
Theowner often decides to reorganize when pro(cid:28)ts substantially increase the individual’s tax liability.
2.
Partnership When two or more family members or people join together in a business op- eration, they may choose to establish a partnership which can take the form of a general or limited liability partnership.
General partnerships are similar to the combination of a group of sole proprietorships in that the partners share workloads, pro(cid:28)ts, and liabilities.
Limited Liability Partnerships, however, usually include one or more partners who manage daily op- erationsandaregenerallyliableforthedebtsofthebusinesswhileotherlimitedpartnersrisk their investment in anticipation of pro(cid:28)ts.
Initial agreement is essential concerning how the partnership will operate, who will manage daily operations, how pro(cid:28)ts will be disbursed, and who assumes liabilities and debts.
Such an agreement is normally formalized in writing and is known as a (cid:16)Partnership Agreement(cid:17).
Partnerships, like sole proprietorships, are generally dissolved upon the death of a partner.
Pro(cid:28)ts are shared in accordance with terms of the Partnership Agreement and reported to taxing authorities on personal tax returns of the partners.
3.
Corporations In the United States, corporations are considered separate legal entities that are chartered and regulated by an authority in each state, such as the Secretary of State.
Additionally, a separate agent who acts on behalf of the corporate entity is identi(cid:28)ed in the initialapplicationprocesstoreceivelegalnoti(cid:28)cations.
Corporationsmustalsosubmitidenti- (cid:28)cation and governing documents such as Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.
Corporate entities are generally required to be kept in active status through annual updates to a regu- latory authority.
As a result, this type of entity is deemed slightly more complex to form and manage.
Corporations require investment by one of more owners who are known as (cid:16)shareholders(cid:17) or (cid:16)stockholders(cid:17), and the amount of investment varies depending on the needs of the business.
Since this form of entity provides protection (widely known as the (cid:16)corporate veil(cid:17)) for the personalassetsofownersagainstcertaintypesofclaims,itisgenerallyoflowerrisk.
Corporate entities may vary in numbers of owners from a single shareholder to an unlimited number.
States and federal agencies regulate (cid:28)nancial activities and reporting requirements that are categorized by the number of shareholders and whether their shares are available to purchase andsellonpublicstockexchanges.
Forexample,UScorporationswithpubliclytradedshares are regulated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The corporation may employ workers and engage independent contractors as needed to in- crease skills available.
Corporations are required, however, to acknowledge formally (in a written document) the individuals who are approved to engage in (cid:28)nancial transactions on behalf of the entity.

The LLC must also be registered with a State authority, but requires less documented structure.
Ownership is acknowledged by percentage as opposed to number of shares and protection for the owners is similar to that of a corporation.

Considerthecommoditiesabusinessemploys(cid:22)pads of paper, ballpoint pens(cid:22)things that you purchase, use up, and then discard.
Investing in a commodity is never considered(cid:22)re(cid:28)lling a ballpoint pen, for a simple example(cid:22)because it simply is not worth the expenditure of time and resources.
A return on that investment is not expected.
On the other hand, consider the assets employed in business(cid:22)the physical plant, the equipment, and the money(cid:22)things that are maintained and developed.
When the paint peels on the o(cid:30)ce walls, one does not throw away the building and build a new one; a new coat of paint is su(cid:30)cient.
Making investments in a business’s assets makes a great deal of sense, because these investments will bring a return.
A growing number of companies, recognizing that their employees are among their most valuable assets, are backing up that recognition with solid investment.
Inanimportantrecentbook,ProfessorJe(cid:27)reyPfe(cid:27)erofStanfordUniversityidenti(cid:28)edsevenmanagement practices that have been associated with producing sustained competitive advantage for the companies that have adopted them.
These practices are: employment security, selective hiring, self-managed teams with decentralized authority, high pay contingent on organizational performance, training, reduced status di(cid:27)erences, and sharing information.
Put together, these practices form the foundation of what is called a (cid:16)high-commitment(cid:17) or a (cid:16)high-performance(cid:17) management system.
The evidence on the results of implementing a high-commitment management system is striking and strong.
Research has been conducted in many industries, from banking to automotive to semiconductors to service.
Some research has focused on one industry while others have looked across industries.

Overall, the conclusions of these studies are remarkably similar.
High-commitment management systems produce higher organizational performance.
Pfe(cid:27)er summarizes the results into three categories.
First, people work harder because they have more control over their work from the high-commitment management practices.
Second,peopleworksmarterbecausetheyhavestrongerskillsandgreatercompetencefromtheinvestments of high-commitment management practices.
Third, companies save administrative overhead and the costs by reducing the alienation of their workforce and the adversarial relationship with management.
In a study of (cid:28)rms representing all major industries, Mark Huselid found that a one standard-deviation increased the use of high-commitment practices was associated with a 7.05 per cent decrease in employee turnover, a USD 27,044 per-employee increase in sales, USD 18,641 more in market value per employee, and USD 3,814 more in pro(cid:28)ts per employee.
When he repeated the study several years later, he found that a similar increase in the use of high-commitment management practices was associated with a USD 41,000 increase in shareholder value per employee.
Another noteworthy study examined the management practices of initial public o(cid:27)erings or IPOs to see if there was a relationship between high-commitment management practices and the (cid:28)ve-year survival rate of IPOs.
This study concluded that the treatment of employees as assets and the useof stock options, pro(cid:28)t sharing and gain sharing programs for all employees (versus limiting the programs to key executives) were signi(cid:28)cantly related to the survival of the IPO to the (cid:28)ve-year milestone.
These studies, and many others like them, have put conventional wisdom on its ear.
Typically, we have assumed that success was related to factors such as size, or being global, or leading your market, or being in particular industries such as high tech, or pursuing a brilliant strategy.
Yet, research shows there is virtually no connection between industry and success.
As Wal-Mart and Southwest Airlines have shown us, an individual business can be very successful in a terrible industry.
Similarly, there is little or no connection between success over time and company size or market dominance.
Instead, competitive advantage comes from the way business is conducted, and employees are the keys to this.
The most successful companies manage their workforce e(cid:27)ectively as assets not commodities.

5.3 Providing employee voice and in(cid:29)uence3 By Liz Evans Employees are the resources of an organization in the same way as material assets but they are also the (cid:28)rm’s stakeholders.
The concept of employees as stakeholders refers to the interest employees have in the success of the company and the fact that actions taken by the organization directly a(cid:27)ect the employees (Olson, 2003).
Employees’ stakes in the company are economic in the fact that their livelihood comes from the (cid:28)rm, psychological in that they derive pride from their work, and political in terms of their rights as employeesandcitizens.
Thoughemployeesarethestakeholderswhoarearguablymostvisibletomanagement on a day-to-day basis, they do not often command the majority of attention in terms of decision-making in(cid:29)uences.
The short-term, economic duties to stockholders often command more managerial attention in the decision making process than employee opinion (Peterson, 2005).
According to Jones, the best way to incorporate employees’ stake to improve (cid:28)rm performance is through employee participation and in(cid:29)uence (Employees as Stakeholders, 1997).

Forone,strongemployeevoiceandin(cid:29)uence mechanisms are an important part of a High-Performance Human Resource System in which the human resources of the (cid:28)rm are coordinated and (cid:16)designed to maximize the quality of human capital in the organization(cid:17) (Becker & Huselid, 2001).
Voice and in(cid:29)uence mechanisms allow employees to give input and to contribute their expertise to business success; these mechanisms allow (cid:28)rms to get the most bene(cid:28)t from the skills of their human capital.
Thus, (cid:28)rms with employee in(cid:29)uence mechanisms get higher (cid:28)nancial return from their employee assets; high-performance HR systems improve the (cid:28)nancial bottom line of the (cid:28)rm (Becker & Huselid, 2001).
Despite the many bene(cid:28)ts, there are various reasons not to implement voice and in(cid:29)uence mechanisms perceived by employees and management.
Voice and in(cid:29)uence can bene(cid:28)t employees by helping them to protect their rights and most (cid:16)employees want a voice in their workplace(cid:17) (Peterson, 2005).
However, employees may be hesitant to organize into employee associations or push for voice mechanisms for fear of retribution due to perceived opposition to in(cid:29)uence by management (Peterson, 2005).
Employers bene(cid:28)t from the increased trust that comes from sharing information and giving employees in(cid:29)uence (Pfe(cid:27)er & Viega, Putting People First for Organizational Success, 1998).
However, managers who are used to having control often (cid:28)nd it (cid:16)disconcerting, di(cid:30)cult and even impossible(cid:17) to share power in the form of in(cid:29)uence in exchange for the many organizational bene(cid:28)ts (Marken, 2004).

Manymanagers recognize the importance of giving their employees a voice, but often this open communication does not result in authentic employee involvement or in(cid:29)uence on the actual decision making process (Golan, 2003).

Action provides the follow up that allows management to make it apparent to employees that they have in(cid:29)uence; it also allows management to see real change and bene(cid:28)t from the insight provided by employees.
Voice without consideration and action creates little bene(cid:28)t for employees or the (cid:28)rm.

Feedback programs, sometimesimplementedintheformofemployeesurveysorthroughdirectemployee- management interaction, can be a less expensive way to get feedback from employees concerning speci(cid:28)c programs or policies (Solnik, 2006).
Surveys are particularly economical, especially when done online using 4 free survey programs such as SurveyMonkey.com (Survey Monkey, 2007).
Team mechanisms such as qual- ity circles, work teams, and total quality management teams provide employees with the ability to synthesize their individual input into a better solution to organizational problems.

5.3.1 Managing di(cid:27)erences in organizations By Hanoi N Soto Garcia and Nora Martin In today’s business environment, an increasing trend towards teamwork, a larger presence of women and ethnic minorities in the workplace, and a greater exposure to international businesses and cultures are constantly challenging employees from a variety of industries in all parts of the world.
This posts a greater opportunity for people to learn from cultural and personal di(cid:27)erences and create a more productive work environment.
ThomasLFriedman, inTheWorldisFlat, makesthefollowingcommentafteroneofhistrips toBangalore,India: (cid:16)Itisnowpossibleformorepeoplethanevertocollaborateandcompeteinrealtimewith more people on more di(cid:27)erent kinds of work from more di(cid:27)erent corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at any previous time in the history of the world(cid:17) (2006).
Due to the importance of managing di(cid:27)erences e(cid:27)ectively in organizations, there is a need to identify the types of di(cid:27)erences encompassed in organizations, the e(cid:27)ects of di(cid:27)erences in work teams, and the importance of understanding and diagnosing di(cid:27)erences to maximize organizational performance.
Organizations usually take one of two paths in managing diversity: (1) they encourage people of diverse backgroundstoblendinforthebene(cid:28)toffairnessandequality;or(2)theysetthemapartinjobsthatrelate speci(cid:28)cally to their backgrounds, assigning them, for example, to areas that require them to interface with clients or customers of the same identity group.
African American MBAs often (cid:28)nd themselves marketing productstoinner-citycommunities;LatinoAmericansarefrequentlypositionedtomarkettoLatinosorwork for Latin American subsidiaries.
In those kinds of cases, companies are operating on the assumption that the main virtue identity groups have to o(cid:27)er is knowledge of their own people.
This assumption is limited and detrimental to diversity e(cid:27)orts.
Diversity goes beyond increasing the number of di(cid:27)erent identity-group a(cid:30)liations on the payroll.
Such an e(cid:27)ort is merely the (cid:28)rst step in managing a diverse workforce for the organization’sutmostbene(cid:28)t. Diversityshouldbeunderstoodasthe(cid:16)variedperspectivesapproachestowork that members of di(cid:27)erent identity groups bring(cid:17) (Thomas & Ely, 1996).
Leaders realize that increasing demographic variation does not in itself increase organizational e(cid:27)ective- ness.
They realize that it is how a company de(cid:28)nes diversity and what it does with the experiences of being a diverse organization that delivers on the promise.
Group diversity refers to the amount of heterogeneity within a group determined by several char- acteristics derived from informational, visible, and value di(cid:27)erences (Hobman, Bordia, & Gallois, 2003).
Informational di(cid:27)erences refer to di(cid:27)erent professional backgrounds and experiences; visible di(cid:27)er- ences refer to things that become more physically apparent, such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc.
; and value di(cid:27)erences are shaped by each individual’s set of beliefs, goals, and values.
These three categories of dif- ferences have a major impact on team performance because they can become the cause for multiple types of con(cid:29)ictswithinateam.
Whenapproachingtasks,di(cid:27)erentmembersoftheteamwillhavedi(cid:27)erentbehaviors based on their own set of informational, visible, and values characteristics.
Employees with di(cid:27)erent views of the same situation may have totally di(cid:27)erent ways of responding to it.
After the appearance of con(cid:29)ict, team members can create a true learning environment where they can perform far beyond expectations by leveraging their di(cid:27)erences.
Hobman, Bordia, and Galois highlight the ways in which group diversity can foster a higher organizational performance, (cid:16)It has been noted that diversity can lead to higher performance when members understand each other, combine and build on each others’ ideas.
This suggests that interaction processes within a diverse team are crucial to the integration of diverse viewpoints.
For example, Abramson found that organizations that had teams with high diversity andintegrationhadthebestperformance(cid:17) (ConsequencesofFeelingDissimlarfromOthersinaWorkTeam, 2003).
Along these lines, diverse groups have a higher ability to overcome initial di(cid:30)culties by identifying the multiple angles of a problem and generating creative solutions.
The more openly they are recognized and discussed, the better chance there is for di(cid:27)erences to become part of organizational success.
Tomas and Ely believe in the notion that (cid:16)a more diverse workplace will increase organizational e(cid:27)ectiveness.

The ultimate goal of any human resources recruitment policy is to develop relationships with potential employees before they may actually be needed while remaining cognizant of the costs of doing so.

SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM 5.4.1 Methods of recruitment There are two principal ways to recruit workers: internally and externally.
Most companies will actively use both methods, ensuring opportunities for existing employees to move up in the organization while at the same time (cid:28)elding new talent.
Depending on the time frame and the specialization of the position to (cid:28)ll, some methods will be more e(cid:27)ective than others.
In either case, the establishment of a comprehensive job description for every position for which the company recruits will help to narrow the scope of the search, and o(cid:27)er more quali(cid:28)ed candidates, aiding in search e(cid:30)ciency.
Internal recruitment is often the most cost e(cid:27)ective method of recruiting potential employees, as it uses existing company resources and talent pool to (cid:28)ll needs and therefore may not incur any extra costs.
This is done in two principal ways: • Advertisingjobopeningsinternally: Thisistheactofusingexistingemployeesasatalentpoolforopen positions.
It carries the advantage of reallocating individuals that are quali(cid:28)ed and familiar with the company’spracticesandculturewhileatthesametimeempoweringemployeeswithintheorganization.
It also shows the company’s commitment to, and trust in, its current employees taking on new tasks.
• Using networking: This method can be used in a variety of di(cid:27)erent ways.
First, this recruitment technique simply posts the question to existing employees on whether anybody is aware of quali(cid:28)ed candidates that they know personally which could (cid:28)ll a position.
Known as employee referrals, this method often gives bonuses to the existing employee if the recommended applicant is hired.
Another method uses industry contacts and membership in professional organizations to help create a talent pool, through simple word-of-mouth information regarding the needs of the organization.
External recruitment focuses resources on looking outside the organization for potential candidates and expanding the available talent pool.
The primary goal of external recruitment is to create diversity among potentialcandidatesbyattemptingtoreachawiderrangeofindividualsunavailablethroughinternalrecruit- ment.
Although external recruitment methods can be costly to managers in terms of dollars, the addition of a new perspective within the organization can carry many bene(cid:28)ts which outweigh the costs.
External recruitment can be done in a variety of ways: • Traditional advertising: This often incorporates one or many forms of advertising, ranging from news- paper classi(cid:28)eds to radio announcements.
It is estimated that companies spend USD 2.18 billion annually on these types of ads (Kulik, 2004).
Before the emergence of the Internet, this was the most popular form of recruitment for organizations, but the decline of readership of newspapers has made it considerably less e(cid:27)ective (Heath(cid:28)eld, Use the Web for Recruiting: Recruiting Online).
• Jobfairsandcampusvisits: Jobfairsaredesignedtobringtogetheracomprehensivesetofemployersin onelocationsothattheymaygatherandmeetwithpotentialemployees.
Thecostsofconductingajob fairaredistributedacrossthevariousparticipants,andcano(cid:27)eranextremelydiversesetofapplicants.
Depending on the proximity to a college or university, campus visits help to (cid:28)nd candidates that are looking for the opportunity to prove themselves and have minimum quali(cid:28)cations, such as a college education, that a (cid:28)rm seeks.
• Headhunters and recruitment services: These outside services are designed to essentially compile a talent pool for a company; however they can be extremely expensive.
Although this service can be extremely e(cid:30)cient in providing quali(cid:28)ed applicants for specialized or highly demanded job positions the rate for the services provided by headhunters can range from 20 to 35 per cent of the new recruit’s annual salary if the individual is hired (Heath(cid:28)eld, Recruiting Stars: Top Ten Ideas for Recruiting Great Candidates).
• Online recruitment.
The use of the Internet to recruit a talent pool is quickly becoming the preferred way of doing so, due to its ability to reach such a wide array of applicants extremely quickly and cheaply.
There are many ways to turn the Internet into a recruitment tool for your company.
First, the use of the company website can allow a business to compile a list of potential applicants which are supremely interested in the company while at the same time allowing them exposure to your company’s AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>77 values and mission.
In order to be successful using this recruitment method, a company must ensure that postings and the process for submitting resumes are as transparent and simple as possible.
Another popular use of online recruiting is through career websites (e.g.
Monster.com or Career- builder.com).
These sites charge employers a set fee for a job posting which can remain on the website for an agreed amount of time.
These sites also carry a large database of applicants and allow clients to search their database to (cid:28)nd potential employees.
Although extremely e(cid:27)ective, many companies prefer to use their own websites to eliminate the (cid:29)ood of resumes which may result from these services.
Finally, many professional associations may have websites on which a company may post job openings.
For instance, the NCAA allows all of its member schools and conferences to post jobs on their website at a minimal cost, allowing for a more specialized selection of candidates.

This calculates the e(cid:30)ciency of recruitmentpracticesbytakingthenumberofhirableindividualsresultingfromarecruitmentpolicydivided by the total number of individuals recruited by the same policy (Kulik, 2004).
This equation is outlined below: Yield ratio= Numberofhirableindividuals Totalnumberofrecruits Formanycompanies,thisnumbercanvaryenormously,dependingontheimage,sizeandbusinessofthe company.
However, itisstillanextremelyusefulmeasureasito(cid:27)ersinsightintotheabilityofarecruitment policy and whether it needs to be modi(cid:28)ed.
A company like Microsoft may receive thousands of applicants simply based on the image that the (cid:28)rm carries, distorting its yield ratio without telling anything about the e(cid:27)ectiveness of their recruitment strategies.
No matter how a company decides to recruit, the ultimate test will remain the ability of a recruitment strategy to produce viable applicants.
Each manager will face di(cid:27)erent obstacles in doing this; however, it is important to remain concise and objective when searching for potential applicants.
It is important to remember that recruiting is not simply done at a time of need for an organization but rather is a yearlong process that constantly maintains a talent pool and frequent contact with candidates.
5.5.1 Selective hiring By Kristen Giacchino and Emily Gray In recruiting, it is bene(cid:28)cial to attract not only a large quantity of applicants but a group of individuals with the necessary skills and requirements for the position.
After obtaining a large, quali(cid:28)ed applicant base managers need to identify those applicants with the highest potential for success at the organization.
According to Pfe(cid:27)er and Veiga, selecting the best person for the job is an extremely critical piece of the human resources in(cid:29)ow process (Pfe(cid:27)er & Viega, Putting People First for Organizational Success, 1998).
Selectivehiringhelpspreventthecostlyturnoverofsta(cid:27)andincreasesthelikelinessofhighemployeemorale and productivity.
In order to evaluate the (cid:28)t, it is important for managers to create a list of relevant criteria for each position before beginning the recruitment and selection process.
Each job description should be associated with a list of critical skills, behaviors or attitudes that will make or break the job performance.

Themethodsofselectionvarybothinlevelsofe(cid:27)ectivenessandincostofapplication.
In addition to biographical information, companies can conduct personal interviews, perform background checks, or request testing.
Because of the costs associated with these measures, companies try to narrow down the number of applicants in each round of hiring.
In some countries, such as the United States, the 11 selection procedures are subject to Equal Employment Opportunity guidelines (Recruitment).
Therefore, the companies also need to ensure that the process is accurate, with a high level of validity, reliable and related to critical aspects of the job.
Proactively taking these measures will help companies avoid litigation related to discrimination in the selection process.
5.5.2 Interviews As mentioned, it is important to (cid:28)rst de(cid:28)ne the skills and attributes necessary to succeed in the speci(cid:28)ed position, then develop a list of questions that directly relate to the job requirements.
The best interviews follow a structured framework in which each applicant is asked the same questions and is scored with a consistentratingprocess.
Havingacommonsetofinformationabouttheapplicantsuponwhichtocompare after all the interviews have been conducted allows hiring managers to avoid prejudices and all interviewees areensuredafairchance(SmithG.).
Manycompanieschoosetouseseveralroundsofscreeningwithdi(cid:27)erent interviewers to discover additional facets of the applicant’s attitude or skill as well as develop a more well rounded opinion of the applicant from diverse perspectives.
Involving senior management in the interview process also acts as a signal to applicants about the company culture and value of each new hire.
There are two common types of interviews: behavioral and situational.
12 5.5.2.1 Behavioral interview In a behavioral interview, the interviewer asks the applicant to re(cid:29)ect on his or her past experiences (Janz, 1982).
After deciding what skills are needed for the position, the interviewer will ask questions to (cid:28)nd out if thecandidatepossessestheseskills.
Thepurposeofbehavioralinterviewingisto(cid:28)ndlinksbetweenthejob’s requirement and how the applicant’s experience and past behaviors match those requirements.
Examples of behavioral interview questions: • Describe a time when you were faced with a stressful situation.
How did you handle the situation?
• Give me an example of when you showed initiative and assumed a leadership role?
(Free Sample Behavioral Interview Questions).
13 5.5.2.2 Situational interview A situational interview requires the applicant to explain how he or she would handle a series of hypothetical situations.

• A client approaches you and claims that she has not received a payment that supposedly had been sent (cid:28)ve days ago from your o(cid:30)ce.
She is very angry.

(Creating Situational Interviews and Rating Scales) 5.5.3 Selection tests When making a hiring decision, it is critical to understand the applicant’s personality style, values, and motivations (Smith G.).
Technical aptitude is important, but attitude is often more important.
The reality is that technical skills can be learned, but interpersonal work attitudes are usually more di(cid:30)cult to change (Schaefer).
Behavioral assessments and personality pro(cid:28)les are a good way for hiring managers to learn how the individual will interact with their coworkers, customers, and supervisors (Smith G.).
Tests such as the 14 15 Myers Briggs and D.I.S.C Pro(cid:28)le assessments are popular tools that provide an accurate analysis of an applicant’s attitudes and interpersonal skills; however, it is critical that the tests are administered, scored 16 and interpreted by a licensed professional.
Other selection tests used in hiring, may include cognitive , 17 which measure general intelligence, work sample tests that demonstrate the applicant’s ability to perform 18 speci(cid:28)c job duties, and integrity tests , which measure honesty (Kulik, 2004).
5.5.4 Background checks Background checks are a way for employers to verify the accuracy of information provided by applicants in resumes and applications.
Information gathered in background checks may include employment history, education,creditreports,drivingrecords,andcriminalrecords.
Employersmustobtainwrittenconsentfrom the applicant before conducting a background check, and the information gathered in a background check should be relevant to the job.
5.5.5 Evaluation Employers may choose to use just one or a combination of the screening methods to predict future job performance.
It is important for companies to assess the e(cid:27)ectiveness of their selective hiring process using metrics.
This provides a benchmark for future performance as well as a means of evaluating the success of a particular method.
Companies can continuously improve their selection practices to ensure a good (cid:28)t for futureemployeesthatwillsuccessfullyaccomplishallthatthejobentailsaswellas(cid:28)tintotheorganizational culture.
If companies are not successful in their hiring practices, high turnover or low employee morale, de- creasedproductivitywillresult.

Thus, companies need to assess theirhiringintermsoftechnicalsuccessaswellascultural(cid:28)t. Evaluatingthehiringprocesswillhelpensure continuing success because human capital is often a company’s most important asset.

SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM 5.6 Employee training19 By Peter Wright For years, employee training was viewed as a necessary evil something unpleasant but needed.
However, withtimeitwasrealizedthattrainingcouldbeusedtotheadvantageofthecompany.
Whenusede(cid:27)ectively, training provides the employee with skill and knowledge with relation to the job tasks, which then creates a competitive advantage for the company (Pfe(cid:27)er & Viega, Putting People First for Organizational Success, 1998).
Training is generally de(cid:28)ned as the act of teaching a skill or behavior.
However, what does this mean in business terms?
Simply put, training in business is the investment of resources in the employees of a company so that they are better equipped to perform the tasks of their job.
The type of resources invested may include time to learn, money to create programs and develop training materials, training e(cid:27)ectiveness evaluation systems, etc.
(Fukami, Strategic Human Resources: Training, 2007).
There are many training methods from which a company may choose; these will be covered in the Training Methods section of this article.
5.6.1 Bene(cid:28)ts of training Training can be a source of a competitive advantage for a company.
The primary bene(cid:28)t to the company is the result of an accumulation of smaller bene(cid:28)ts.
Training provides greater skill and knowledge to the employees, which translate into any number of improved job performances.
The belief is that providing employees with training will result in increased pro(cid:28)ts(cid:22)the improved performance or error reduction of the employeesresultsincostreductionforthecompany(Pfe(cid:27)er&Viega,PuttingPeopleFirstforOrganizational Success, 1998).
The company is not the only bene(cid:28)ciary of employee training; the employee bene(cid:28)ts quite a bit as well.
The well-trained employee creates an advantage for him or herself.
By attending training sessions, employees can deepen their existing skill set, increase their overall skill set and increase their understanding of the organization.
Additionally, the trained employee becomes more marketable in the event that he or she searches for another job(cid:22)more and better skills will often lead to better or higher paying jobs (Kulik, 2004).
Thesearenottheonlybene(cid:28)tsthatthecompanyandemployeeenjoyasaresultofutilizingacompany’s training systems.
Below is a list of other bene(cid:28)ts that both may enjoy: • increased job satisfaction and morale among employees • increased employee motivation • increased e(cid:30)ciencies in processes, resulting in (cid:28)nancial gain • increased capacity to adopt new technologies and methods • increased innovation in strategies and products • reduced employee turnover • enhancedcompanyimage,e.g.
conductingethicstraining(notethatthisisnotagoodreasonforethics training!)
• risk management, e.g.
training about sexual harassment, diversity training (Duening & Ivancevich, 2003) 5.6.2 Need for training The need for training varies depending on the type of organization that is being discussed; a manufacturing company has di(cid:27)erent training needs than an insurance (cid:28)rm.
But regardless of the type of company being discussed, appropriate training systems can greatly bene(cid:28)t the company.
However, how does one decide on a training system?
The answer to this question stems from the example above(cid:22)it depends on the type of 19Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35401/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>81 organization that is being discussed as well as what the company wishes to address in the training.
The process begins with a training needs assessment.
This assessment ought to be a systematic and objective analysis of the training needs in three main areas(cid:22)organizational, job, and person.
Organizationalneedsdealmostlywiththeskillsthecompanyislookingfor, thelaborforce, etc.
whereas the job needs focus on the skills that the company views as necessary for a speci(cid:28)c position.
Then there are the person needs, and these are the most variable needs.
Often these needs arise after a gap is seen in the expected performance compared to the actual performance of the employee.
A large gap needs to be addressed and is often dealt with through training or termination (see the Termination and Downsizing section)(Fukami,StrategicHumanResources: Training,2007).
Otherreasonsforthepersonissuesinregards to training may include training to develop a skill set that is lacking but not a(cid:27)ecting performance or that the employee feels a need to develop.
Training can also be a part of a young employee’s (cid:16)exploration(cid:17) stage, where training can be used to focus the employee’s interest and development towards a speci(cid:28)c area (Kulik, 2004).
Speci(cid:28)c circumstances may also create the need for training.
These circumstances usually occur rather suddenly and infrequently, creating a need for a speci(cid:28)c and highly directed training mechanism.
Examples of such circumstance are shifts in an organizations ethics (keeping the employees and organization in align- ment),newlegalrequirements(suchasSarbanes-OxleycomplianceintheUnitedStates),orduringstatesof changewithintheorganization(Duening&Ivancevich, 2003).
Ifacompany, regardlessofthecircumstances surroundingthatneed,deemstrainingnecessaryamethodforconductingthistrainingneedstobedeveloped and implemented.
5.6.3 Training methods Designing and implementing the training systems requires the company to consider a number of things; the method of training, the material the training will deal with, who will provide the training, how to evaluate the e(cid:27)ectiveness of the training, etc.
(Fukami, Strategic Human Resources: Training, 2007).
There are also anumberofotheritemsthatcanimpactthetrainingsystem,thingslikewhatthetrainingprogramiscalled.
Because of the negative view that training has had for so long, some organizations are shying away from the 20 term training and replacing it with things such as ((cid:16)Learning & Development(cid:17) ) in order to emphasize the importance of learning for the individual and the organization.
In other organizations, the term (cid:16)Human Resource Development(cid:17) is used (Training and Development, 2007).
Two of the largest issues that a company faces with developing these training systems are: (1) what type of training to use, and (2) how to evaluate the e(cid:27)ectiveness of the training.
It is important that these training systems and evaluation procedures remain in-line with the culture and policies of the rest of the company.
Below is a partial list of common training systems: • Lectures: Similar to a school classroom, the session is lead by a (cid:16)trainer/teacher(cid:17) who covers a speci(cid:28)c topic such as how to use a new computer program.
• Audio-visual media & computer-based training: With the advancement of technology, companies can invest in video, audio and computer based learning such as instructional tapes, recorded lectures or (cid:16)podcasts(cid:17), or computer materials such as Flash presentations.
The bene(cid:28)t of these methods is that they are relatively inexpensive and can be utilized by the employee at their discretion (Training and Development, 2007).
• On-the-job: a training method that relies on the employee to recognize the skills and knowledge he or she will need as they perform their work, and then develop those skills on his or her own.
• Technical training: specialized training that focuses on a speci(cid:28)c need of speci(cid:28)c employees.
This typically applies to manufacturing based companies in relation to training their employees on the machinery and methods used.

5.6.4 Training in the context of global business When examining the need for and type of training in the context of global/international business, training becomes even more necessary.
The training of an employee who will be working in a country other than his or her own can be broken into three segments(cid:22)pre-departure, on-site, and repatriation.
The pre-departure training consists of formal language training, training with respect to the local cul- ture(culturesensitivity),educationaboutthecountry(history,geography,government,etc.
),andeducation about the companies operation in the foreign country.
Such training allows for easier assimilation of the employee into the country and the company’s o(cid:30)ce there.
Once on site, training takes the shape of training at any other branch of the company (see (cid:16)Training methods(cid:17) section).

Recruiting and selecting the right talent is the (cid:28)rst stage, and identifying talent which (cid:28)ts into com- pany’s needs and values is critical.
Subsequently, the challenge for the organization is to keep the talent and consistently motivate them to over deliver.

This is not an easy achievement considering size of TCS and its philosophy of being one of the moderate pay masters.
TCS has over 70,000 employees, and earned global revenue of USD 4.3 billion (2006-07).
The key to success is the learning culture that the organization promotes.
The organization has adopted a two-prong strategy for developing talent.

The career development programs should provide excitement and satisfaction at various stages of employee development.
Marshall highlighted that leadership development programs for small organizations should identify the talent early on and provide multiple opportunities of learning by job rotation (Leadership Development for Small Organizations, 2002).
These development programs should also leverage the internal talent,whoarealreadyexpertsintheir(cid:28)eldsforcreatinginspirationanddevelopingthenextchainofleaders.
Komisar shared his experiences and mentioned that a passion-driven career has major virtues and ample learning opportunities.
This is good for the organization as they know that employee is enjoying the work, and (cid:28)nally it provides (cid:29)uidity and (cid:29)exibility in the ever-changing landscape of the new economy (Goodbye Career, Hello Success, 2000).
The changing nature of careers and organizations has increased the signi(cid:28)cance of mentoring.
It bene(cid:28)ts and strengthens employer-employee relationship.
Mentoring can be accomplished by immediate superiors, peerswithinone’sownorganization,individualsoutsideofone’sorganization,subordinates,andanynumber of other individuals (Baugh & Sullivan, 2005).
Michaels, Hand(cid:28)eld-Jones, and Axelrod in their book The War for Talent mentions that talent development is critical for organizations and many think development means training, but training is only a small part of the solution (2001).
They suggest that development primarily happens through a sequence of stretch jobs, coaching, and mentoring.
However, organizations are not leveraging the development opportunities.
Companies need to adopt and accelerate development by improving the frequency and candor of feedback and institutionalizing mentoring.
Every leader at all levels can and should be responsible for people development.
Hymowitz says that managers are not spending adequate time in understanding their team members and providing them with opportunities to learn and grow on the job (When Managers Neglect to Coach Their Talent, 2007).
This is leading to employees feeling alienated, underutilized and ignored, and may be searching for new jobs elsewhere.
Managers who focus on talent assign their employees to jobs that play to theirstrengths,makesuretheyhavetheresourcestheyneedtoperformwell,respecttheiropinionsandpush them to advance (Hymowitz, 2007).
The people manager should develop relationships and an environment that is conducive to development.
Five skill areas that successful developers of people have mastered are: • encouraging an open climate for dialogue with employees • providing employees with on-going feedback regarding performance AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>84 CHAPTER 5.

5.8 Performance appraisal22 By Adam Ruberg 5.8.1 Purpose of appraisals Historically,performanceappraisalshavebeenusedbycompaniesforavarietyofdi(cid:27)erentpurposes,including salary recommendations, promotion and layo(cid:27) decisions, and training recommendations (Kulik, 2004).
In general, (cid:16)performance elements tell employees what they have to do and standards tell them how well they havetodoit(cid:17) (UnitedStatesDepartmentoftheInterior,2004).
Thisbroadde(cid:28)nition,however,canallowfor appraisals to be ine(cid:27)ective, even detrimental, to employee performance.
Second only to (cid:28)ring an employee, managersciteperformanceappraisalasthetasktheydislikethemost,andemployeesgenerallyhaveasimilar disposition (Heath(cid:28)eld, Performance Appraisals Don’t Work).
One key item that is often forgotten during the appraisal process (by managers and employees alike) is that the appraisal is for improvement, not blame or harsh criticism (Bacal, 1999).
5.8.2 Creating an appropriate appraisal process One signi(cid:28)cant problem in creating an appraisal process is that no single performance appraisal method will be perfect for every organization (Kulik, 2004).
Establishing an appropriate process involves signi(cid:28)cant planning and analysis in order to provide quality feedback to the employee.
The most crucial task in the processisdeterminingproperjobdimensionsthatcanbeusedtogaugetheemployeeagainstacceptedstan- dards that a(cid:27)ect the performance of the team, business unit, or company (Fukami, Performance Appraisal, 2007).
Peter Drucker developed a method termed ‘Management by Objectives’ or MBO, in order to address the creation of such job dimensions.
Drucker suggests that the objectives of any employee can be validated if they pass the following six tests (Management by Objectives(cid:22)SMART, 2007): • Speci(cid:28)c • Measurable • Achievable • Realistic • Time-related If an objective meets these criteria, it is considered a valid dimension on which to gauge performance.
The standards on which the objective is compared with should also be validated using the SMART method.

The following outlines some of the more commonly used methods, as well as some recently developed ones that can be useful for various feedback situations: Graphic rating scales: This method involves assigning some form of rating system to pertinent traits.
Ratings can be numerical ranges (1-5), descriptive categories (below average, average, above average), or scales between desirable and undesirable traits (poor ↔ excellent).
This method can be simple to setup and easy to follow, but is often criticized for being too subjective, leaving the evaluator to de(cid:28)ne broad traits such (cid:16)Leadership ability(cid:17) or (cid:16)Conformance with standards(cid:17) (Kulik, 2004).
Behavioral methods: A broad category encompassing several methods with similar attributes.
These methods identify to what extent an employee displays certain behaviors, such as asking a customer to identify the usefulness of a sales representative’s recommendation.
While extremely useful for jobs where behavior is critical to success, identifying behaviors and standards for employees can often be very time consuming for an organization (Kulik, 2004).

Signi(cid:28)cant planning will be required to develop appropriate methods for each business unit in an organization in order to obtain maximum performance towards the appraisal goals.
5.8.4 Performing the appraisal Performing an appraisal on employees can be nerve racking for both parties if the situation is not handled correctly, and is thus seen as one of the most di(cid:30)cult tasks managers face.
There are many acts a manager can perform to make the process easier on both parties, and hopefully, mutually bene(cid:28)cial.
Manyassumethatperformanceappraisalsaremeanttoidentifyweaknessestobeworkedon,andexposing these weaknesses can be painful for employees.
Martha Craumer suggests that organizations should be leveraging the strengths of each employee rather than focusing on their weaknesses.
By (cid:16)encouraging and developing what people do well naturally...the organization could become more e(cid:30)cient by allowing their people to do what they do best(cid:17) (Craumer, 2001).

Constanttuningofperformance can be much more e(cid:27)ective than annual overhauls.
Any individual administering performance appraisals must realize the two-way conversation that is oc- curring.
Inviting feedback and listening to reactions and concerns from the employee during the appraisal process becomes very important to establishing trust with the employee (United States Department of the Interior, 2004).
If the appraiser provides any negative feedback or improvement points, suggestions should be made to help resolve the problem to develop the person’s performance.
With the suggestions made, follow-up should occur to assist with any problems with the development and to track progress, rather than waiting until the next performance review (Fukami, Performance Appraisal, 2007).
Often being seen as a strictly hierarchical feedback tool, performance appraisals can be less (cid:16)scary(cid:17) if employees have the opportunity to appraise their managers as well as their peers.

So, whyaresomanyofusafraidofthewordfeedback?
Peopleoftenthinkoffeedbackasbeingsynonymouswith criticism because feedback is given, in most circumstances, when expectations have not been met (Rich).
As humans, we all have the desire to (cid:28)t in with our society’s social norms and please those within our community by meeting expectations.
As shown in Exhibit 5.1, we are constantly surrounded by feedback as weseetheconsequencesofouractionsandhowouractionsa(cid:27)ecttheimpressionsofthosearoundus(Jossey andBass,1995).
Feedbackisanessentialpartofourpersonallifeandourworkenvironment,making,giving and receiving feedback successfully critical.
Exhibit 5.1: Feedback 5.8.6 Giving feedback Many are not aware that giving successful feedback is a(cid:27)ected by more than just the words used to commu- nicate.
Words used to tell ideas are only (cid:16)7 per cent of your communication, your tone of voice comes out to 38 per cent and your gestures are equivalent to 55 per cent of your total communication(cid:17) (Hathaway).
As 23http://www.selfhelpmagazine.com/articles/growth/feedback.html 24http://home.att.net/∼nickols/feedback.htm AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>87 a result, the e(cid:27)ectiveness of communication is related to how well one mirrors the culture and behaviors of the person to which one is talking.
Matching a person’s voice tone, tempo, body posture, movements, and gestures creates a feedback environment where the ideas being communicated are easily understood.
In addition to mirroring the person you are communicating with, there are nine easy steps that can be followed when giving feedback.
First, be clear about what you have to say.
Second, emphasize the person’s ability to change in a positive way.
Third, avoid general comments and clarify pronouns such as (cid:16)it(cid:17) and (cid:16)that(cid:17) so the person understands exactly what you are attempting to communicate.
Fourth, make sure to picktherighttime.
Fifth,focusonthebehaviorthatcanbechangedratherthanthepersonoryouropinions (Meister).
Sixth, be descriptive rather than evaluative.
Seventh, own the feedback by using (cid:16)I statements(cid:17) that clarify your feelings related to the person you are giving feedback to.
Eighth, avoid generalization words such as (cid:16)all(cid:17), (cid:16)never(cid:17), (cid:16)always(cid:17) etc.
; rather, use more speci(cid:28)c examples of the behavior you are trying to change or encourage in the future.
Ninth, to ensure mutual understanding after giving feedback, ask the person you are communicating with to restate their understanding of the issue being discussed (McGill & Beatty, 1994).
When thinking about feedback in an organization, it is likely a person will think of performance reviews.
One common problem that managers overlook when reviewing performance is remembering that feedback is not all about forms.
Traditional performance reviews have checklists, ratings or reports that are used as toolstoanalyzefeedbackintheorganization.
Whiletheseformsareusefulindocumentingandappraisinga person’sperformance,feedbackshouldnotbedictatedbythetypeofformanorganizationuses.
Performance appraisalsareoftengivenatbenchmarkedtimesthroughouttheyear.
Asaresult, feedbackisoftendelayed.
Increased amounts of time that pass between the time the behavior took place and the time the recipient receives the feedback greatly a(cid:27)ects the recipients ability to accept the feedback as useful information.
In one’s personal life and in the work environment, it is important to understand that feedback is something that can be asked for.
As such, the giver and receiver of feedback are equally accountable for communicatingtheneedanddesiretogiveandreceivefeedback.
Finally, itisimportanttoaskforcomment on the way one gives feedback because most humans are great at self-delusion.
It is much easier to think that our suggestions are useful to another person than to actually understand how our feedback is being interpreted by another.
In the end, feedback is a continuous process which ensures goals and expectations are being met through communication between two parties.
5.8.7 Receiving feedback Whilegivingfeedbackisextremelyimportant,receivingfeedbackandchangingone’scharacteristicstore(cid:29)ect that feedback is just as important.
Often, employees become defensive when they are receiving feedback on their performance.
Ken Blanchard, co-author of The One Minute Manager states, (cid:16)[t]he reason a lot of peoplegetdefensivewithfeedbackistheydon’tdistinguishfeedbackfromreaction.
Whiletheyarelistening to the feedback, they have a reaction to the demand for action that your feedback implies(cid:17) (Blanchard, 1996).
For example, when a boss is telling an employee the aspects of the job the employee needs to work on, he may only focus on the negative points and not the positive.
Receiving feedback should not only be looked at from a downward point of view, such as a boss giving his employees critiques; but it should also be studied in an upward way.
According to Richard Reilly, James Smither,andNicholasVasilopoulos,authorsofALongitudinalStudyofUpwardFeedback,(cid:16)upwardfeedback (that is, subordinates rating the performance of their immediate supervisor) is growing in importance as a tool for the individual and organizational development(cid:17) (1996).
Upward feedback allows management to see the e(cid:27)ects they have on their employees.
It is then up to the managers to act on that feedback.
Atwater, Roush and Fischthal found that (cid:16)follower ratings of student leaders improved after feedback was given to leaders and that leaders receiving ’negative’ feedback (de(cid:28)ned as self-ratings that were considerably higher than follower ratings) improved the most(cid:17) (The In(cid:29)uence of Upward Feedback on Self and Follower Ratings ofLeadership,1995).
Thisshowsthatthereisabiggerreactionwhentheupwardfeedbackisnegativeinstead of positive.
In order to e(cid:27)ectively receive feedback, a person has to be ready to understand that they may hear critiques that they do not want to hear.
Jan B.
King, the former President and CEO of Merritt Publishing AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>88 CHAPTER 5.
SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM states that an individual is ready to receive feedback when he: • wants to know him as others see him and he is clear that this is their perception, net necessarily what is true about you inside.
• trusts his co-workers to care enough about his development to risk hearing their opinion.
• has a place outside work where you can talk it through.
• Has opportunities for additional feedback so he gets validation of the changes he has made (Receiving Feedback Gracefully is a Critical Career Skill).
If an individual is not ready to constructively receive feedback, then the feedback he does receive will not be e(cid:27)ective.
King continues to state that individuals must remember this about feedback, (cid:16)it is one opinion coming from another individual’s unique perspective(cid:17) (Receiving Feedback Gracefully is a Critical Career Skill).
Just because one person views another individual in a particular way does not mean that the rest of world views that person in the same way, but it is a good way for an individual to (cid:28)nd out what others think of him/her that is not known.
There are several tips that an individual can use when receiving feedback.
These tips include: • Try to show your appreciation to the person providing the feedback.
They will feel encouraged and believe it or not, you do want to encourage feedback.
• Even your manager or supervisor (cid:28)nds providing feedback scary.
They never know how the person receiving feedback is going to react.
• Ifyou(cid:28)ndyourselfbecomingdefensiveorhostile,practicestressmanagementtechniquessuchastaking a deep breath and letting it out slowly.
• Focusing on understanding the feedback by questioning and restating usually defuses any feelings you have of hostility or anger.
• If you really disagree, are angry or upset, and want to dissuade the other person of their opinion, wait until your emotions are under control to reopen the discussion (Heath(cid:28)eld, How to Receive Feedback with Grace and Dignity).
Thesetipsarehelpfulinbecomingabetterreceiverforfeedback, buttheywillonlyworkaslongastheyare practiced on a regular basis.
With the above facts and (cid:28)gures workers can see that giving and receiving feedback does not have to be scary.
As long as people give and receive feedback in a constructive way and practice their feedback skills it will eventually become second nature to the employees.
It will also show that feedback provides bene(cid:28)ts for both the individuals that work for the company, and the company itself.

Imaginethatyou have seen a job posted on the Internet.
It reads, (cid:16)O(cid:30)ce Assistant Wanted.
Will answer the phone and greet visitors.
Some word processing duties.
Other duties as assigned.
Start at USD 8.00 an hour(cid:17).
How did the manager decide to pay USD 8.00 per hour?
Why did she decide that was fair?
In this subchapter, we will cover the two types of (cid:16)fairness(cid:17) important in designing a base pay system.
5.9.1 Internal equity The (cid:28)rst consideration is that the base pay system needs to be internally equitable.
This means that the pay di(cid:27)erentials between jobs need to be appropriate.
The amount of base pay assigned to jobs needs to re(cid:29)ect the relative contribution of each job to the company’s business objectives.
In determining this, the manager should ask his or herself, (cid:16)How does the work of the o(cid:30)ce assistant described above compare with the work of the o(cid:30)ce manager?
(cid:17) Another question to be asked is, (cid:16)Does one contribute to solutions for customersmorethananother?
(cid:17) Internalequityimpliesthatpayratesshouldbethesameforjobswherethe work is similar and di(cid:27)erent for jobs where the work is dissimilar.
In addition, determining the appropriate di(cid:27)erential in pay for people performing di(cid:27)erent work is a key challenge.
Compensation specialists use two tools to help make these decisions: job analysis and job evaluation.
Job analysisisasystematicmethodtodiscoveranddescribethedi(cid:27)erencesandsimilaritiesamongjobs.
A good job analysis collects su(cid:30)cient information to adequately identify, de(cid:28)ne, and describe the content of a job.
Since job titles may in and of themselves be misleading, for example, (cid:16)systems analyst(cid:17) does not revealmuchaboutthejob;thecontentofthejobismoreimportanttotheanalysisthanthetitle.
Ingeneral, a typical job analysis attempts to describe the skill, e(cid:27)ort, responsibility, and working conditions of each job.
Skill refers to the experience, training, education, and ability required by the job.
E(cid:27)ort refers to the mental or physical degree of e(cid:27)ort actually expended in the performance of the job.
Responsibility refers to the degree of accountability required in the performance of a job.
Working conditions refer to the physical surroundings and hazards of a job, including dimensions such as inside versus outside work, heat, cold, and poor ventilation.
A job description summarizes the information collected in the job analysis.
29 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_analysis for more information about job analysis.
Job evaluation is a process that takes the information gathered by the job analysis and places a value on the job.
Job evaluation is the process of systematically determining the relative worth of jobs based on a judgment of each job’s value to the organization.
The most commonly used method of job evaluation in the United States and Europe is the (cid:16)point method(cid:17).
The point method consists of three steps: (1) de(cid:28)ning a set of compensable factors, (2) creating a numerical scale for each compensable factor, and (3) weighting each compensable factor.
Each job’s relative value is determined by the total points assigned to 30 it.
See http://www.hr-guide.com/jobevaluation.htm for more information about job evaluation and the point system.
Theresultofthejobanalysisandjobevaluationprocesseswillbeapaystructureorqueue,inwhichjobs are ordered by their value to the organization.
5.9.2 External equity The second consideration in creating a base pay system is external equity.
External equity refers to the relationship between one company’s pay levels in comparison to what other employers pay.
Some employers set their pay levels higher than their competition, hoping to attract the best applicants.
This is called (cid:16)leading the market(cid:17).
The risk in leading the market is that a company’s costs will generally be higher than its competitors’ costs.
Other employers set their pay levels lower than their competition, hoping to save labor costs.
This is called (cid:16)lagging the market(cid:17).
The risk in lagging the market is that the company will be unable to attract the best applicants.
Most employers set their pay levels the same as their competition.
Thisiscalled(cid:16)matchingthemarket(cid:17).

SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM An important question in external equity is how you de(cid:28)ne your market.
Traditionally, markets can be de(cid:28)nedinoneofthreeways.
Onewaytode(cid:28)neyourmarketisbyidentifyingcompanieswhohireemployees with the same occupations or skills.
For example, if a company hires electrical engineers, it may de(cid:28)ne its market as all companies that hire electrical engineers.
Another way to de(cid:28)ne a market is by identifying companies who operate in the same geographic area.
For example, if the company is in Denver, Colorado, the market would be de(cid:28)ned as all companies in Denver, Colorado.
A third way to de(cid:28)ne a company’s market is by identifying direct competitors, that is, those companies who produce the same products and services.
For example, Shady Acres Veterinary Clinic may de(cid:28)ne its market as all other veterinary clinics.
Notice that these three characterizations can interact, that is, Shady Acres might de(cid:28)ne its market as all veterinary clinics in Denver, Colorado that employ veterinary technicians.
Once you have de(cid:28)ned your market, the next step is to survey the compensation paid by employers in your market.
Surveys can be done in a variety of ways.
First, there are publicly available data through the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States.
Second, there are publicly available data through 31 32 the Internet, from sites such as www.salary.com or www.haypaynet.com .
Third, salary information can be obtained from a third party source, such as an industry group or employer organization, which has collectedgeneralinformationforageographicregionorindustry.
Fourth, thecompanycanhireaconsulting organization to custom design a survey.
Finally, one can conduct a survey one’s self.
See http://www.hr- 33 guide.com/data/G474.htm for more information about salary surveys.
5.9.3 Combining internal and external equity A company that has performed appropriate research has two sets of data.
The (cid:28)rst is pay structure, the output from the job evaluation.
The second is market data, the output from the market survey.
The next step will be to combine these two sets of data, to create a pay policy line.
The pay policy line can be drawn freehand, by graphing actual salaries and connecting the dots.
Alternatively, statistical techniques such as regression analysis are used to create a pay policy line.
Regression generates a straight line that best (cid:28)ts the data by minimizing the variance around the line.
In other words, the straight line generated by the regression analysis will be the line that best combines the internal value of a job (from job evaluation points) and the external value of a job (from the market survey).
You can also enact a policy of (cid:16)leading(cid:17) the market by raising the line, and the policy of (cid:16)lagging(cid:17) the market by lowering the line.
How do companies decide the pay associated with each job?
First, they analyze the content of each job.
Second, they assess the value each job contributes to the company.
Third, they price each job in the market.
Finally, they look at the relationship between what they value internally and what the market values externally.
By following each of these steps, a company will have a fair base pay system, which will lead to attracting and retaining the best employees.
5.9.4 Bene(cid:28)ts and non-monetary compensation By Julie Wells Inorderformostbusinessestofunction,employeesmustbeprovidedwithapaymentinexchangefortheir services.
Cashisonewaytocompensateemployees,butcashaloneisrarelyenoughpayment.
(cid:16)Compensation is becoming more variable as companies base a greater proportion of it on stock options and bonuses and a smaller proportion on base salary, not only for executives but also for people further and further down the hierarchy(cid:17) (Pfe(cid:27)er, Six Dangerous Myths About Pay, 2000).
Bene(cid:28)ts and other forms of non-monetary compensation are becoming more appropriate forms of compensation for employees in today’s workplace.
A bene(cid:28)t is a (cid:16)general, indirect and non-cash compensation paid to an employee(cid:17) that is o(cid:27)ered to at least 80 per cent of sta(cid:27) (Employee Bene(cid:28)ts De(cid:28)nition).
On average, 40 per cent of payroll is dedicated to non-cash bene(cid:28)ts (Kulik, 2004).
In order to attract, retain, and motivate the best employees, bene(cid:28)ts and other sources of non-monetary compensation should be considered.
There are three things a company must 31http://cnx.org/content/m35406/latest/www.salary.com 32http://cnx.org/content/m35406/latest/www.haypaynet.com 33http://www.hr-guide.com/data/G474.htm AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>91 fully consider before determining if and how they will issue employee bene(cid:28)ts: the industry structure, the strengths of the company and its competitors, and the wage structure.
A company should not issue bene(cid:28)ts to employees if they have not considered the implications of these factors, speci(cid:28)cally the wage structure.
If a company o(cid:27)ers employees extremely high wages compared to other businesses in the industry in addition to non-monetary compensation, costs may increase at a faster rate than pro(cid:28)t. Bene(cid:28)ts are also related to the type of industry in which the company does business.
If the company has an understanding of what they can o(cid:27)er to employees and how those o(cid:27)erings will be received in the industry, bene(cid:28)ts can increase a company’s workforce quality and general happiness of employees.

In the US, the government requires that businesses deduct Federal Income Contribution Act (FICA) taxes from employee paychecks, which pay for Social Security and Medicare (Internal Revenue Service).
Workers’Compensationispaidtoemployeesiftheyareinjuredwhileperformingworknecessary fortheirjobfunction; thiscanincludebreakingabone,gettingintoacaraccident,orpaymentsmadetothe family of someone killed on the job.
Unemployment insurance provides wages to unemployed persons, generally only if they are registered as unemployed and actively seeking a job.
In Australia, these bene(cid:28)ts are paid through the income taxes, but payments are issued by Centrelink, a governmental o(cid:30)ce that seeks tosupportunemployedindividualsandhelpthembecomeself-supporting(Centrelink).
TheFamilyMedical Leave Act (FMLA) allows individuals to leave work for a semi-extended period of time in order to care for an ailing family member, new child, or personal illness.
This leave is unpaid, but it guarantees that employees will not lose their jobs if they leave under these circumstances.
Employee bene(cid:28)ts that are not required by law are often provided.
These are attractive to businesses as well as employees because they provide both with some tax advantages.
For example, if a company o(cid:27)ers employees a (cid:29)exible spending account, money that employees receive in this account may be deducted from total earnings on employees’ tax returns.
Employees can (cid:16)use pre-tax dollars to pay for eligible health care and dependent care expenses(cid:17), however any money that remains in the account at the end of the year will be forfeited (SHPS).
This is a bene(cid:28)t to employees because individuals will receive a portion of their income tax-free.
Employers also bene(cid:28)t from o(cid:27)ering these types of programs because they also receive tax bene(cid:28)ts and they retain happy employees by providing programs that meet their needs.

Inordertoattractemployeesthat(cid:28)ttheiruniquecompany culture, SAS has developed an extensive employee bene(cid:28)t program that is o(cid:27)ered to all employees at the company.
Salaries paid to SAS employees are not signi(cid:28)cantly higher than competitors in the industry, but they do maintain a competitive pay rate.

Whenacompanydesignsabasesalary,theyhavetoconsiderthecompany’suniqueaspects: locations and acquisition period of skills and so on.
Depending on ranking system of the company, employees need to be evaluated di(cid:27)erently.
A CEO’s evaluation is di(cid:27)erent from that of management and evaluation of management is di(cid:27)erent from that of employees.
Companies also provide short term incentives to employees.
Most companies’ compensation systems include (cid:16)variable pay(cid:17) (Kulik, 2004).
Depending on work performance, many companies reward their em- ployees without a(cid:27)ecting base salary.
To achieve a set goal, many companies use bonuses.

Long-term incentives are also a part of reward systems.
Stock options and pro(cid:28)t-sharing plans are representative long-term reward systems (Kulik, 2004).
Even though employees are motivated by these incentives, they do not receive bene(cid:28)ts until after few years.
For example, employees cannot sell stock options until after a few years after they receive stock options.
(cid:16)In a pro(cid:28)t-sharing plan, employees are promised a payment beyond base pay that is based on company pro(cid:28)ts(cid:17) (Kulik, 2004).
5.9.8 Components of pay for performance According toDr Cynthia Fukami, a professorfrom theUniversity ofDenver, theseare themain components of pay for performance (Fukami, Reward Systems, 2007): 1.
The company pays the employee beyond his or her job value.
2.
Many forms for improving the pay system are available.
3.
The company can divide up the pay into 3 levels that are individual, team, and company-wide.
5.9.9 Pay secrecy Besides the compensation techniques, the companies should consider whether the compensation system shouldbesecret.
Historically,employeesandbusinessesbothexpressedconcernsaboutthepublicdiscussion of salary; however, such discussions should not be prohibited (Kulik, 2004).
Companies need to conclude what information they should reveal in their pay systems.
Some US companies select to announce salary ranges.
For example, for each position American Express posts the market pay ranges so that its employees can compare them with their salaries.
Some companies disclose the formula and the factors they may use to calculate salaries, such as education and experience.

SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM 5.9.10 Good outcomes of paying for performance Dr Cynthia Fukami notes that reward system is a powerful tool if pay links with performance (Fukami, Reward Systems, 2007): 1.
Strategic objectives of the organization will be achieved.
2.
The reward system will support the organizational culture.
3.
Employees’ working performance will be improved from the right pay practice.
4.
Competitive advantages have increased continuously.
5.9.11 Folly of reward systems in di(cid:27)erent organizations In politics: Politicians are separated from the general population when they speak only of o(cid:30)cial goals that are purposely vague and generalized.
In contrast, the electorate will punish the candidate who frankly informs about the source of fund.
In universities: According to Steven Kerr, (cid:16)Society hopes that professors will not neglect their teaching responsibilities but rewards them almost entirely for research and publications(cid:17) (p. 9).
While it is easy to recognize those professors who receive awards, quantifying a dedication to teaching is more di(cid:30)cult.
To resolve this problem, it is essential that university leadership should emphasize teaching and doing research equally.
Insport: Coachestalkaboutteamwork,notindividuals.
Clearly,inarewardsystem,thebestplayerwill receive the biggest reward.
Therefore, players normally think of themselves (cid:28)rst and their team second.
To correct this problem, the team manager needs to reduce the gaps of pay among team players.
5.9.12 Cautions for introducing a pay system • Muchadviceaboutpayiswrong (Kerr,1995).
Manyexecutiveslearnthattheemployeeswillcertainly work more e(cid:27)ectively in case that the company gives them higher compensation.
Pfe(cid:27)er said that the executives may not be (cid:16)spending as much time and e(cid:27)ort as it should on the work environment-on de(cid:28)ning its jobs, on creating its culture, and making work fun and meaningful(cid:17) (Six Dangerous Myths About Pay, 2000).
Sometimes, companies pay well to create proactive work environment and get new innovative ideas in return.
This policy does not surely work, especially when the top executives and employees are lacking of trust with each other.
• Pay systems need to align with the company culture.
The top management should adjust the pay system when it is not (cid:28)t with the current business strategy.
However, changing the internal culture is a wrong idea because it is embedded in the employees’ minds.
The confusion can make the growth of the company stagnant.
• Implementing the reward system is hard and takes management time Most companies believe that employees will work e(cid:27)ectively when they get rewards for their e(cid:27)orts.
Because of this concern, the HRmanagerscannotmaintainthepolicyincompensation.
FromMercersurvey,(cid:16)nearlythree-quarters of all the companies surveyed had made major changes to their pay plans in just the past two years(cid:17) (Pfe(cid:27)er, Six Dangerous Myths About Pay, 2000).
In addition, an example of changing reward system occurred in Sears.
Sears had to eliminate its commission system because Sears’s employees wanted high commission, so they o(cid:27)ered unneeded services to customers.
5.10 Meaningful job design37 By Ryan Brown and Mike McClain 37Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35402/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>95 Job design is critical to the success of any organization.
For our purposes job design is de(cid:28)ned as the allocation of speci(cid:28)c work tasks to individuals and groups (Schermerhorn, Job Design Alternatives, 2006).
Allocating jobs and tasks means specifying the contents, method and relationships of jobs to satisfy technological and organizational requirements as well as the personal needs of jobholders.
If successful job design is not implemented, than the companies general strategy and direction will be strongly diverted.
Meaningful jobs must also exemplify the company’s goals and culture.
5.10.1 Elements to job design Inordertobetterunderstandjobdesignitishelpfultode(cid:28)nesomekeyelementsandtheirrelationshipwith job design processes.
A task can be best de(cid:28)ned as a piece of assigned work expected to be done within a certain time.
It is important to strictly and thoroughly identify tasks that need completion.
In addition individuals need to be compelled, excited, and passionate to do their work.
Hence, it is essential to design jobs that motivate employees.
Motivation describes forces within the individual that account for the level, direction, and persistence of e(cid:27)ort expended at work (Schermerhorn, Job Design Alternatives, 2006).
In job design it is necessary to identify and structure jobs in a way so that the company’s resources are being e(cid:30)ciently used.
Resource Allocation occurs when organizations decide to appropriate or allocate certain resources to speci(cid:28)c jobs, tasks or dilemmas facing the organization.
Jobs need to be constructed so that e(cid:30)ciency of the worker or department is maximized.
Organizations need to use the resources and creativity of their employees e(cid:27)ectively and e(cid:30)ciently.
Appropriate resource allocation allows large organizations to foster and develop innovation in their workforce (Dorenbosch, van Engen, & Verhagen, 2005).
Rewardsystemsalsoplayaroleinjobdesign.
Rewardsystemsincludecompensation,bonuses,raises,job security, bene(cid:28)ts, and various other methods of reward for employees.
An outline or description of reward packages needs to be established while constructing jobs.

Moreover, individuals are often times ine(cid:27)ective at setting personal goals (Godwin, Neck, & Houghton, 1999).
If a company wants to implement goal setting theory with regards to job design than a reasonable job criteria and description must be established.
5.10.3 Current approaches to job design Technology and the (cid:29)attening of the global economy have contributed greatly to the changes we now see in jobs and job content across the world.
This shift is a signal for employers to meet changing job demands and expectations (McDonald & Obenchain, 2003).
We now recognize that a person presented with quality meaningful work is more likely to do that work well.
Because of this insight, job design now presently takes a couple of prominent forms.

• Employees must be actively involved in designing the structure of the organization.
• Control of variances in production or service must be undertaken as close to their source as possible.
• Subsystems must be designed around relatively self-contained and recognizable units of work.

The individual elements are then proposed to lead to positive outcomes through three psychological states: experienced meaningfulness, experienced responsibility, and the knowledge of results (Parker & Turner, 2002).
A further evolution of this theory is Psychological Empowerment Theory (Spreitzer, 1995).
This theory posits that there is a distinction between empowering practices and cognitive motivational states.
When a person is aware of the impact that they are having, they bene(cid:28)t more than if they cannot relate a positive impact to any of their behaviors or practices.

5.10.4 Steps to e(cid:27)ective job design Key to e(cid:27)ectively crafting a meaningful job for an employee is starting the thought process by looking at the values and strategy of the organization.
By framing the job in these contexts the job design process is more likely to align potential employees with the purpose of the company.
Once you have this context the 39 following steps will ensure both meaningful and e(cid:27)ective job design: 1.

5.11 Termination40 By James Frasche Theterminationofanemployeeisanuncomfortableeventforallpartiesinvolved.
Obviously,theemployee losing his or her job will be distraught for many reasons, and in many cases the manager responsible for makingtheterminationdecisionandtheemployeehaveformedapersonalrelationshipduringtheemployee’s tenure, thereby making the manager’s responsibility of (cid:16)letting someone go(cid:17) an undesirable one.
However, there are ways that a manager can lessen the unpleasantness of the termination process.
There are many factors to take into consideration when terminating an employee.
First and foremost, an employer must take into account the nature of the relationship that exists between the organization and the employee in order to assess the legality of the termination.
In the United States, approximately 70 per cent of employers and employees maintain an (cid:16)at will(cid:17) relationship with one another, that is, an employee may quit their job for any reason, at any time, or an employer may (cid:28)re an employee for any reason, at any time.
The other 30 per cent of the workforce is employed under individual employment contracts or union contracts that specify the (cid:16)length of an employment relationship, how the relationship can be severed, and how the relationship can be extended(cid:17) (Kulik, 2004).
An (cid:16)at will(cid:17) relationship may give the impression that a termination decision may never be challenged.
Indeed, (cid:28)ring an employee (cid:16)for cause(cid:17) is made even easier when an (cid:16)at will(cid:17) relationship is present.
Broadly speaking,anemployercantypically(cid:28)reanemployee(cid:16)forcause(cid:17) whentheirbehaviorfallsunderthefollowing categories (Falcone, 2002): 1.
Policy and procedure violations 2.
Substandard job performance 3.
Inappropriate workplace conduct 4.
Attendance/tardiness problems However, there are some instances in which employees can be wrongfully discharged or (cid:28)red for reasons that are not legitimate, typically either because they are unlawful or because they violate the terms of an employment contract (Lectric Law Library).
Some of the illegitimate reasons for terminating employees include, among many others, discrimination and violations of public policy.
For a more complete list of ille- gitimate reasons for terminating employees in the US, visit: http://smallbusiness.
(cid:28)ndlaw.com/employment- 41 employer/employment-employer-ending/employment-employer-ending-wrongful-reasons(1).html .
There are several laws that have been enacted in the United States in order to protect employees from unfair termination in the workplace based on discrimination, the most prevalent of which are Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the AmericanswithDisabilitiesActof1990 (ADA).TitleVII,thebroadestofthesestatutes,protectsemployees, applicants, and union members from termination and discrimination in the workplace based on race, color, religion, gender, and national origin, regardless of the nature of the employment relationship (at will, union, etc.)
(Clarkson, 2004).
For instance, if an African American or Muslim individual can prove in a court of law that he or she was (cid:28)red because of race or religious preferences, that employee is entitled to both 40Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35413/1.4/>.

SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM compensatory and punitive damages under Title VII.
Organizations that employ 100 people or less are liable for USD 50,000 and organizations that employ 100 or more employees are liable for USD 300,000 in punitive and compensatory damages under Title VII (Clarkson, 2004).
For more information on Title VII, including the claims process, bona (cid:28)de occupational quali(cid:28)cation defense, and who is protected, visit the 42 EqualEmploymentOpportunityCommission’s(EEOC)websiteat: http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html .
According to West’s Business Law, it is quite possible that discrimination based on age is the most widespread form of discrimination, being that anyone, regardless of gender, national origin, etc.
may (cid:28)nd themselvesavictimatsomepointintheirlife(Clarkson, 2004).
Thepracticeof(cid:16)laying-o(cid:27)(cid:17) olderemployees and hiring younger, less expensive ones in order to cut costs is a common occurrence amongst organizations that operate in the United States.
Sec.
621 (Section 2) of the ADEA states, (cid:16)in the face of rising produc- tivity and a(cid:31)uence, older workers (cid:28)nd themselves disadvantaged in their e(cid:27)orts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs(cid:17).
In an e(cid:27)ort to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age, Congress enacted the ADEA, which (cid:16)prohibits employment discriminationonthebasisofageagainstindividualsfortyyearsofage orolder(cid:17) (TheUSEqualEmployment Opportunity Commission).
In order for the ADEA to apply to a speci(cid:28)c employer (under federal law), that employer must employ twenty or more people, and the employer must engage in interstate commerce.
Should a plainti(cid:27) successfully prove that age discrimination has occurred, the remedies under the ADA stipulate that the employee may be awarded back pay, attorney’s fees, liquidated damages (when a willful violation has been proven), front pay (which is designed to compensate the victim for future losses), and injunctive relief (which may include reinstatement).
Unlike Title VII, punitive and compensatory damages are not awarded under the ADEA (Clarkson, 2004).
To view the ADEA in its entirety, visit the EEOC’s 43 website at: http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html .
AccordingtotheUSCongress,43,000,000Americanshaveoneormorementalorphysicaldisabilities.
In 1990,CongressenactedtheAmericanswithDisabilitiesAct,whichmadeitillegalforprivateemployers,state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and labor-management committees to discriminateagainstindividualsbasedonadisability(TheUSEqualEmploymentOpportunityCommission).
Furthermore, the ADA was speci(cid:28)cally enacted in order to (cid:16)(1) provide a clear and comprehensive mandate fortheeliminationofdiscriminationagainstindividualswithdisabilities,(2)provideclear,strong,consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities, (3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this Act on behalf of individuals with disabilities, and (4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities(cid:17) (US Department of Labor).
As of 1994, the ADA is applicable to companies that employ 15 or more employees and prohibits such companies from discriminating based on a disability in all employment practices such as recruit- ment, pay, hiring, (cid:28)ring, promotion, bene(cid:28)ts, etc.
For more information on the ADA including reme- dies under the act and the plainti(cid:27)’s burden of proof, visit the US Department of Labor’s website at: 44 http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/statutes/ofccp/ada.htm .
Most states in the US prohibit employers from (cid:16)(cid:28)ring an employee in violation of public policy, that is, for reasons that most people would (cid:28)nd morally or ethically wrong such as terminating an employee for (1) refusing to commit an illegal act such as refusing to falsify insurance claims or lie to government auditors (2) complaining about an employer’s illegal conduct such as the employer’s failure to pay minimum wage, 45 or (3) exercising a legal right such as voting or taking family leave(cid:17) (FindLaw.com ).
The manner in which an organization terminates an employee can send a powerful message to the orga- nization’s remaining sta(cid:27) (Heath(cid:28)eld, How to Fire an Employee).
Managers must be aware that seemingly unfair or harsh terminations may cause some of the organizations best workers to become less e(cid:27)ective or seek new employment for fear of the same treatment.
In some cases, it is appropriate for managers to en- 42http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html 43http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html 44http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/statutes/ofccp/ada.htm 45http://cnx.org/content/m35413/latest/FindLaw.com AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>99 gage in progressive discipline before terminating an under performing employee.
Progressive discipline is (cid:16)a process for dealing with job-related behavior that does not meet expected and communicated performance standards.
Theprimarypurposeforprogressivedisciplineistoassisttheemployeetounderstandthataper- formance problem or opportunity for improvement exists(cid:17) (Heath(cid:28)eld, Discipline (Progressive Discipline)).
By attempting to assist an employee in (cid:28)xing any problems that they are experiencing in the workplace before terminating them, the organization communicates a strong commitment to its employees, which can go a long way in regards to retention, turnover, and other areas of concern.
Should the decision be made to move forward with the termination process after all other options have been exhausted, it is important for managers to know how, when, and where to break the news to the employee.
Supervising managers should generally be responsible for terminating an employee, and it is generallyimpropertopassthisresponsibilityo(cid:27)touppermanagementortothehumanresourcesdepartment.
Most managers postpone telling an employee about their termination until the end of the week.
However, thismaybeagravemistake,astheemployeewillhavetheentireweekendtocomplainabouttheirtreatment to their coworkers and friends, thereby tarnishing the reputation of the organization.
An alternative is for managers to break the news of termination to employees at the beginning of the week.
This will give the employee time to (cid:16)cool o(cid:27)(cid:17) and think about their next move before they have the opportunity to socially interact with former coworkers during the weekend (Kulik, 2004).
Theterminationinterviewisanimportantaspectoftheexitprocess.
Thefollowingareguidelinesforthe termination interview provided by the experts at Hay Associates as seen in Framework for Human Resource Management.
• Plan the interview carefully.
· Make sure the employee keeps the appointment time.
· Never inform an employee over the phone.
· Allow 10 minutes as su(cid:30)cient time for the interview.
· Use a neutral site, never your own o(cid:30)ce.
· Have employee agreements, the human resources (cid:28)le, and a release announcement (internal and external) prepared in advance.
· Be available at a time after the interview in case questions or problems arise.
· Have phone numbers ready for medical or security emergencies.
• Get to the point.
As soon as the employee enters the meeting, give the person a moment to get comfortable and then inform him or her of your decision.
• Describe the situation.
Brie(cid:29)y explain why the person is being (cid:28)red.
Remember to describe the situation rather than attack the employee personally.
• Listen.
Continue the interview until the person appears to be talking freely and reasonably calmly about the reasons for termination.
• Review all elements of the severance package.
Describe severance payments, bene(cid:28)ts, access to o(cid:30)ce support people, and the way references will be handled.
However, under no conditions should any promises or bene(cid:28)ts beyond those already in the support package be implied.
• Identify the next step.
The terminated employee may be disoriented and unsure of what to do next.
Explain where the employee should go next, upon leaving the interview.
note: The above is a brief summary of some of the issues surrounding the termination process in the United States and, due to space constraints, in no way takes into account all of the factors that managers should consider while terminating an employee.

5.11.1 Downsizing By Logan Price AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>100 CHAPTER 5.
SELECTING AND MANAGING YOUR TEAM The goal of any company is to supply a product or service that customers are willing to pay for.
If a company provides a good that consumers are willing to pay a lot of money for, the company will similarly earn a lot of money.
As long as the amount of money the company brings in is more than the amount they spend to make the good the company will pro(cid:28)t and grow.
To fuel this growth companies must invest in additional resources and must increase its number of workers.
During times of growth few employees are laid o(cid:27) and the company is making money.
However,acompany’sproductorservicemaynolongerbedesiredbyconsumersovertime.
Somereasons thismightoccurarebecausethegoodhasgoneoutofdateoracompetitormayhavecreatedabetterproduct or may o(cid:27)er a better service.
Loss of demand happens all the time in a competitive business environment.
With so many companies trying to sell their products or services it becomes essential for companies to continually improve upon existing o(cid:27)erings so they do not fall behind competitors.
But companies do fall behind, and as a result growth and pro(cid:28)ts quickly turn to layo(cid:27)s and losses.
Sometimes losses are so bad that the company cannot survive and simply closes down.
Other times the lost revenue is not enough to shut down the company.
In this instance the company cuts some resources and workers in order to survive the downturn in business.
When companies decide to do this it is called downsizing.
To downsize, as de(cid:28)ned by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is (cid:16)to (cid:28)re (employees) for the purpose of 46 downsizing a business.
(cid:17) The reasons for downsizing businesses vary, but the main reason for doing this is because the product(s) or service(s) that the company o(cid:27)ers is not as successful as it once was.
As a result revenuesdecrease,andexpenses(costslikematerialsandemployees)mustbecuttocounterthelostrevenue.
Obviously,employeesdonotlikeitwhentheygetlaido(cid:27).
However,downsizingissomethingthatneitherthe company nor the employees want to see happen.
Since both sides su(cid:27)er (the company loses money and the worker loses a job) downsizing is often not met with strong resistance from employees.
One reason for this lack of resistance is that employees understand that they are not being (cid:28)red for doing a bad job.
Employees tend to be more understanding if a company is forced to reduce its labor force.
Also, the employees that are laid o(cid:27) during a downturn are normally the (cid:28)rst ones to be rehired if business picks back up.
Business will always have companies that are growing and companies that are dying, and downsizing and layo(cid:27)s are a natural part of that cycle.
Since downsizing is a normal part of business it can often be seen as necessary and reasonable.
There is one other main reason why companies would downsize.
If a company observes that they could be getting the same amount of output from fewer workers it makes economic sense to let the excess workers go.
As an example, imagine a job that it would take three workers an hour to do.
Now, if a fourth worker was added the job area would get crowded so everyone worked slowly and it took the four of them over an hour to complete.
Clearly, the fourth worker is not adding value to the job and the company should downsize by (cid:28)ring the fourth worker.
This practice is somewhat common, as most businesses continually review their processes to look for areas of the business that could run more e(cid:30)ciently with fewer expenses.
For example, by evaluating and changing a manufacturing process could be streamlined resulting in reduced labor, material, and/or time costs while producing the same output.
In order to continue growth and avoid the need for downsizing, products and services must constantly bemadebetter, cheaper, and/orfasterthanwhatisbeingo(cid:27)eredbythecompetition.
Acompanythatdoes this successfully will enjoy increased revenues and most likely growth.
Companies that fail to o(cid:27)er products and services that are better, cheaper, and/or faster than their competition will not succeed.
Companies are constantly battling with each other for market share, and downsizing and growth are two results of how e(cid:27)ectively companies create demand for their good.
5.11.2 HR Metrics By Ronald Tam For any company that is implementing new human resource programs or adjusting existing ones, these changes can quickly become a substantial company project.
The roles of human resource programs are to manage the employees of companies to increase the human capital in a company.
However, the speci(cid:28)c 46http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/downsizing AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>101 goalsorstrategiesthatHRseekstoachievemaybedi(cid:27)erentforeachcompanyorsituation.
Therefore,there is no set standard for measuring the success of HR.
(cid:16)The business world is dominated by people who look at metrics, and the HR world needs to play in that space...if you can measure manufacturing e(cid:30)ciency with Six Sigma, why not use similar analytics to measure human capital performance(cid:17) (Grossman, 2006).
It is suggested that the business world is focused onmetricsindeterminingsuccess.
SimilarapproachesmustbetakentovalueHRinorderforittobewidely accepted, (cid:16)but were the HR policies and practices really worth the time and e(cid:27)ort?
HR thought so, based on overall company performance.
But Poses, who also had served as a (cid:28)nancial analyst at AlliedSignal, wantedmore.
Hewantedsubstantiveproof,validationthathisHRinvestmentswerepayingo(cid:27)(cid:17) (Grossman, 2006).
This is the most common view of companies when it comes to HR, so the metrics sought out here is a (cid:28)nancial measure.
The(cid:28)rstapproachtoHRmetricswouldbetheapproachinmeasuringthe(cid:28)nancialsuccessofthecompany as a result of the HR implementations.
Evaluations can be viewed as company projects or investments in this case.
The (cid:28)rst measurement is just a simple ratio of change in pro(cid:28)ts due to new HR divided by cost of the new HR.
This measure will give an idea of how well the new changes paid o(cid:27) relative to how much was spent on it.
Another measure is payback period, (cid:16)The payback period of an investment is the period of time required for the cumulative cash in(cid:29)ows (net cash (cid:29)ows) from a project to equal the initial cash outlay (net investment)(cid:17) (Moyer, McGuigan, & Kretlow, 2006).
The payback period is measured by the net investment divided by the annual cash in(cid:29)ows as a result of that investment; this measure will give a company an idea of how long it takes the project to earn by its cost.
The (cid:28)nal measure for (cid:28)nancial metrics of HR is a net present value, (cid:16)The net present value of a capital expenditure project is de(cid:28)ned as the present value of the stream of net (operating) cash (cid:29)ows from the projects minus the project’s net investment(cid:17) (Moyer, McGuigan,&Kretlow,2006).
Thisisdonebytakingthepresentvalueofallfutureexpectedcash(cid:29)owsfrom the HR change and subtracting it from the cost of the project.
This will put the value of the HR project in monetary terms like any other investment for the company.
These are all measures that can be used to express the HR program or changes in terms of a relationship between its (cid:28)nancial returns and costs.
There are no speci(cid:28)c standards for determining whether an HR project was a good investment or not, but the company should relate their results with industry results or historic results.
The other approach to HR metrics is more towards operations aspect of the company.
(cid:16)The old HR measures, such as head count, the cost of compensation and bene(cid:28)ts, time to (cid:28)ll, and turnover, no longer cut it in this new world of accountability.
They don’t go far enough to create shareholder value and align people decisions with corporate objectives(cid:17) (Schneider, 2006).
Since the purpose of HR is to improve an operationalaspectofthecompany, itshouldalsobemeasuredinthatcontext.
(cid:16)Manycompaniesareforging aheadone(cid:27)ortstocreateanewsetofmetricsthatthetraditionalHRfunctionslikerecruiting,training,and performance review [relate] to overall corporate goals(cid:17) (Schneider, 2006).
Measurements here can include a variety of traditional measurements such as employee turnover, average stay of employees, e(cid:30)ciency of em- ployees, etc.
Thesemeasuresalla(cid:27)ecttheoperationaspectsofacompanyand arestandardizedinformation currently.
Anewmeasurethatcanbeintroducedisthemeasurementofhumancapital;(cid:16)human-capitalmet- rics can provide meaningful correlations that help predict behavior and human-capital investment demands wellaheadof theannualbudget(cid:17).
AnothernewHRmetriccanbedirectlyrelatedtothe operationalaspects of the company.
(cid:16)HR metrics might measure e(cid:30)ciency, or the time and cost of activities; human-capital metrics measure the e(cid:27)ectiveness of such activities.
Time to (cid:28)ll becomes time to productivity; turnover rate becomesturnoverquality; trainingcostsbecometrainingreturnoninvestment(cid:17) (Schneider, 2006).
Thetake from non-(cid:28)nancial HR metrics is that there is no limit to any measurements or techniques.
They can range from something simple and standard such as employee turnover to something creative that measures the e(cid:27)ects of human capital increases, customer satisfaction increases, etc.
Human resources should be treated like any other projects that a company can undertake.
It can be measured both with (cid:28)nancial results or operational results.
The (cid:28)nancial results are measures to compare the cost against the return from HR.
The operational measure can look at standards or more complex and creative measures.
Ultimately HR metrics are valued and judged against the goals or strategies of the company and how well they are aligned with the results.
Therefore, a company should not limit themselves AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>102 CHAPTER 5.

Furthermore, the only way you can achieve this objective is to create a competitive advantage.
Thatis,youmustconvincebuyers(potentialcustomers)thatwhatyouhavetoo(cid:27)erthemcomes closest to meeting their particular need or want at that point in time.
Hopefully, you will be able to provide this advantage consistently, so that eventually the customer will no longer consider other alternatives and will purchase your product out of habit.
This loyal behavior is exhibited by people in the US who drive only Fords, brush their teeth only with Crest, buy only Dell computers, and have their plumbing (cid:28)xed only by "Samson Plumbing(cid:22)On Call 24 hours, 7 days a week".
Creating this blind commitment(cid:22)without consideration of alternatives(cid:22)to a particular brand, store, person, or idea is the dream of all businesses.
It is unlikely to occur, however, without the support of an e(cid:27)ective marketing program.
In fact, the speci(cid:28)c role of marketing is to provide assistance in identifying, satisfying, and retaining customers.
While the general tasks of marketing are somewhat straightforward, attaching an acceptable de(cid:28)nition to the concept has been di(cid:30)cult.
A textbook writer once noted, "Marketing is not easy to de(cid:28)ne.
No one hasyetbeenabletoformulateaclear,concisede(cid:28)nitionthat(cid:28)ndsuniversalacceptance".
Yetade(cid:28)nitionof some sort is necessary if we are to layout the boundaries of what is properly to be considered "marketing".
How do marketing activities di(cid:27)er from non-marketing activities?
What activities should one refer to as marketing activities?
What institutions should one refer to as marketing institutions?

MARKETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE nail.
In reality, marketing is a way of thinking about business, rather than a bundle of techniques.
It is much more than just selling stu(cid:27) and collecting money.
It is the connection between people and products, customersandcompanies.
Likeorganictissue,thiskindofconnection(cid:22)orrelationship(cid:22)isalwaysgrowingor dying.
It can never be in a steady state.
And like tissue paper, this kind of connection is fragile.
Customer relationships, even long(cid:22)standing ones, are contingent on the last thing that happened.
Tracingtheevolutionofthevariousde(cid:28)nitionsofmarketingproposedduringthelastthirtyyearsreveals two trends: (1) expansion of the application of marketing to non-pro(cid:28)t and non-business institutions; e.g.
charities,education,orhealthcare;and(2)expansionoftheresponsibilitiesofmarketingbeyondthepersonal survivaloftheindividual(cid:28)rm,toincludethebettermentofsocietyasawhole.

(cid:16)Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception.
pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual (customer) and organizational objectives.
(cid:17) While this de(cid:28)nition can help us better comprehend the parameters of marketing, it does not provide a full picture.
De(cid:28)nitions of marketing cannot (cid:29)esh out speci(cid:28)c transactions and other relationships among these elements.
The following propositions are o(cid:27)ered to supplement this de(cid:28)nition and better position marketing within the (cid:28)rm.
1.
The overall directive for any organization is the mission statement or some equivalent statement of organizational goals.
It re(cid:29)ects the inherent business philosophy of the organization.
2.
Everyorganizationhasasetoffunctionalareas(e.g.
accounting, production, (cid:28)nance, dataprocessing, marketing) in which tasks that are necessary for the success of the organization are performed.
These functional areas must be managed if they are to achieve maximum performance.
3.
Everyfunctionalareaisguidedbyaphilosophy(derivedfromthemissionstatementorcompanygoals) that governs its approach toward its ultimate set of tasks.
4.
Marketing di(cid:27)ers from the other functional areas in that its primary concern is with exchanges that take place in markets, outside the organization (called a transaction).
5.
Marketing is most successful when the philosophy, tasks, and manner of implementing available tech- nology are coordinated and complementary.
6.3 The role of marketing in the (cid:28)rm: a basis for classi(cid:28)cation3 Marketingisanindividualizedandhighlycreativeprocess.
Despitetheavailabilityofhigh-poweredcomput- ers and sophisticated software capable of analyzing massive amounts of data, marketing is still more of an art rather than a science.
Each business must customize its marketing e(cid:27)orts in response to its environment and the exchange process.
Consequently, no two marketing strategies are exactly the same.
This requirement of marketing to play slightly di(cid:27)erent roles, depending upon some set of situational criteria, has in turn provided us with a division of marketing into a number of di(cid:27)erent categories.
This is not to imply, however, that there are not general marketing principles that work in most businesses(cid:22)there are.
There is a right and wrong way to design a package.
There are certain advertising strategies that tend toworkmoreoftenthanothers.
Rather, wearesayingthatbecauseofcertainfactors, abusiness’sapproach toward marketing and the ensuing strategy will require some modi(cid:28)cation from the basic plan.
Shown in Table 1 are the most common types of marketing categories.
Since these various types of marketing will be discussed throughout this text, a brief introduction is provided at this point.

AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>111 6.3.1 Macromarketing versus micromarketing The division of marketing into macromarketing and micromarketing is a fairly recent one.
Initially, the division was a result of the controversy concerning the responsibility of marketing.
Should marketing be limited to the success of the individual (cid:28)rm, or should marketing consider the economic welfare of a whole society?
Acceptingthelater,or"macro",pointofviewdramaticallychangesthewaymarketingiscarriedout.

Examples of macromarketing activities are studying the marketing systems of di(cid:27)erent nations, the consequences on society of certain marketing actions, and the impact of certain technologies on the marketing transaction.

Micromarketing examples include determining how Nikon Steel should segment its market, recommending how Denver Colorado’s National Jewish Hospital in the US should price their products, and evaluating the success of the US "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign.
6.3.2 Service marketing versus goods marketing The distinction between services and goods products is not always clear-cut.
In general, service products tend to be intangible, are often consumed as they are produced, are di(cid:30)cult to standardize because they require human labor, and may require the customer to participate in the creation of the service product.
Goodsproductstendtobejusttheoppositeintermsofthesecriteria.
Consequently,marketersofservice products usually employ a marketing strategy quite di(cid:27)erent from that of goods marketers.
For example, a local family physician creates tangibility by providing an environment: waiting room examination rooms, diplomas on the walls, that convinces patients that they are receiving good health care.
Conversely, co(cid:27)ee producers create intangibility in order to appear di(cid:27)erent from competitors.
This is done through colorful packaging and advertisements showing people who are successful because they start each day with a cup or two or ten of Starbuck’s co(cid:27)ee.

For-pro(cid:28)t marketers measure success in terms of pro(cid:28)tability and their ability to pay dividends or pay back loans.
Continued existence is contingent upon level of pro(cid:28)ts.
Nonpro(cid:28)t institutions exist to bene(cid:28)t a society, regardless of whether pro(cid:28)ts are achieved.

While they are allowed to generate pro(cid:28)ts, they must use these monies in speci(cid:28)c way in order to maintain their non-pro(cid:28)t status.
There are several other factors that require adjustments to be made in the marketing strategies for nonpro(cid:28)ts.
6.3.4 Mass marketing, direct marketing, and Internet marketing Mass marketing is distinguished from direct marketing in terms of the distance between the manufacturer andtheultimateuseroftheproduct.
Massmarketingischaracterizedashavingwideseparationandindirect communication.
A mass marketer, such as Nike, has very little direct contact with its customers and must distributeitsproductthroughvariousretailoutletsalongsideitscompetitors.
Communicationisimpersonal, as evidenced by its national television and print advertising campaigns, couponing, and point-of-purchase displays.
The success of mass marketing is contingent on the probability that within the huge audience exposed to the marketing strategy there exist su(cid:30)cient potential customers interested in the product to make the strategy worthwhile.
Direct marketing establishes a somewhat personal relationship with the customer by (cid:28)rst allowing the customertopurchasetheproductdirectlyfromthemanufacturerandthencommunicatingwiththecustomer ona(cid:28)rst-namebasis.
Thistypeofmarketingisexperiencingtremendousgrowth.
Apparently,marketershave tiredofthewasteassociatedwithmassmarketingandcustomerswantmorepersonalattention.
Also,modern mechanisms for collecting and processing accurate mailing lists have greatly increased the e(cid:27)ectiveness of directmarketing.
Cataloguecompanies(Spiegel,J.C.Penney), telecommunicationscompanies(Sprint), and direct mail companies (Publishers Clearing House) are example of direct marketers.
A modi(cid:28)ed type of direct marketing is represented by companies that allow ordering of product by calling a toll-free number or mailing in an order card as part of an advertisement.
Although (o(cid:30)cially), Internet marketing is a type of direct marketing, it has evolved so quickly and demandedtheattentionofsomanycompaniesthataseparatesectionhereiswarranted.

"Call now!"
is no longer an e(cid:27)ective pitch.
Consumers have control over how, when, and where they shop on the Internet.
The Internet has all but eliminated the urgency of satisfying the need when the opportunity is presented.
6.3.5 Local, regional, national, international, and global marketers As one would expect, the size and location of a company’s market varies greatly.
Local marketers are concerned with customers that tend to be clustered tightly around the marketer.
The marketer is able to learn a great deal about the customer and make necessary changes quickly.
Naturally, the total potential market is limited.
There is also the possibility that a new competitor or environmental factor will put a local marketer out of business.

As the US market becomes more and more saturated with US-made products, the continued expansion into foreign markets appears inevitable.

Whereasinternational marketing means a company sells its goods or services in another country, it does not necessarily mean that the company has made any further commitments.
Usually the product is still manufactured in the home country,soldbytheirpeople,andthepro(cid:28)tsaretakenbacktothatcountry.
InthecaseofHondaMotors,for example, it means building manufacturing plants in the US, hiring local employees, using local distribution systems and advertising agencies, and reinvesting a large percentage of the pro(cid:28)ts back into the US.
6.3.6 Consumer goods marketing and business-to-business (industrial) marketing Consumer goods marketers sell to individuals who consume the (cid:28)nished product.
Business-to-business mar- keters sell to other businesses or institutions that consume the product in turn as part of operating the business, or use the product in the assembly of the (cid:28)nal product they sell to consumers.
Business-to- marketers engage in more personal selling rather than mass advertising and are willing to make extensive adjustments in factors such as the selling price, product features, terms of delivery, and so forth.
For the consumer goods marketer, the various marketing components are relatively (cid:28)xed.

MARKETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE need to respond is not con(cid:28)ned to (cid:28)rms of a certain size or particular industries.
It is a change that to a greater or lesser extent will ultimately a(cid:27)ect companies of all sizes in virtually all markets.
The pressures of the international environment are now so great, and the bases of competition within many markets are changingsofundamentally,thattheopportunitiestosurvivewithapurelydomesticstrategyareincreasingly limited to small-and medium-sized companies in local niche markets.
Perhaps partly because of the rapid evolution of international marketing, a vast array of terms have emerged that suggest various facets of international marketing.
Clari(cid:28)cation of these terms is a necessary (cid:28)rst step before we can discuss this topic more thoroughly.
Let us begin with the assumption that the marketing process outlined and discussed in Chapters 1-4 is just as applicable to domestic marketing as to international marketing.
In both markets, we are goal- driven, do necessary marketing research, select target markets, employ the various tools of marketing (i.e.
product, pricing, distribution, communication), develop a budget, and check our results.
However, the uncontrollable factors such as culture, social, legal, and economic factors, along with the political and competitive environment, all create the need for a myriad of adjustments in the marketing management process.
Atitssimplestlevel,internationalmarketing involvesthe(cid:28)rminmakingoneormoremarketingdecisions across national boundaries.
At its most complex, it involves the (cid:28)rm in establishing manufacturing and marketing facilities overseas and coordinating marketing strategies across markets.
Thus, how international marketingisde(cid:28)nedandinterpreteddependsonthelevelofinvolvementofthecompanyintheinternational marketplace.
Therefore, the following possibilities exist: • Domestic marketing.
This involves the company manipulating a series of controllable variables, such as price, advertising, distribution, and the product, in a largely uncontrollable external environment that is made up of di(cid:27)erent economic structures, competitors, cultural values, and legal infrastructure within speci(cid:28)c political or geographic country boundaries.

This involves the company operating across several markets in which not only do the uncontrollable variables di(cid:27)er signi(cid:28)cantly between one market and another, but the con- trollable factor in the form of cost and price structures, opportunities for advertising, and distributive infrastructure are also likely to di(cid:27)er signi(cid:28)cantly.

(c) Global marketing.
The entire organization focuses on the selection and exploration of global marketing opportunities and marshals resources around the globe with the objective of achieving a global competitive advantage.
The primary objective of the company is to achieve a synergy in the overall operation, so that by taking advantage of di(cid:27)erent exchange rates, tax rates, labor rates, skill levels, and market opportunities, the organization as a whole will be greater than the sum of its parts.
Thus Toyota Motors started out as a domestic marketer, eventually exported its cars to a few regional mar- kets, grewtobecomea multinationalmarketer, andtodayis atrueglobal marketer, building manufacturing plants in the foreign country as well as hiring local labor, using local ad agencies, and complying to that country’s cultural mores.
As it moved from one level to the next, it also revised attitudes toward marketing and the underlying philosophy of business.
Ultimately, the successful marketer is the one who is best able to manipulate the controllable tools of the marketing mix within the uncontrollable environment.

6.4.1 Standardization and customization In 1983, Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt wrote an article entitled, "The Globalization of Markets", and nothing about marketing has been the same since.
According to Levitt, a new economic reality-the emergence of global consumer markets for single standard products-has been triggered in part by technological developments.
Worldwide communications ensure the instant di(cid:27)usion of new lifestyles and pave the way for a wholesale transfer of goods and services.
Adopting this global strategy provides a competitive advantage in cost and e(cid:27)ectiveness.
In contrast to multinational companies, standardized (global) corporations view the world or its major regions as one entity instead of a collection of national markets.
These world marketers compete on a basis of appropriate value: i.e.
an optimal combination of price, quality, reliability, and delivery of products that are identical in design and function.
Ultimately, consumers tend to prefer a good price/quality ratio to a highly customized but less cost-e(cid:27)ective item.
Levittdistinguishedbetweenproductsandbrands.
Whiletheglobalproductitselfisstandardizedorsold withonlyminormodi(cid:28)cations,thebranding,positioning,andpromotionmayhavetore(cid:29)ectlocalconditions.
Critics of Levitt’s perspective suggest that his argument for global standardization is incorrect and that each market strategy should be customized for each country.
Kotler notes that one study found that 80 per centofUSexportsrequiredoneormoreadaptations.
Futhermore,theaverageproductrequiresatleastfour to (cid:28)ve adaptations out of a set of eleven marketing elements: labeling, packaging, materials, colors, name, product features, advertising themes, media, execution, price, and sales promotion.
Kotler suggests that all eleven factors should be evaluated before standardization is considered.
To date, no one has empirically validated either perspective.
While critics of Levitt can o(cid:27)er thousands of anecdotes contradicting the validity of standardization, a more careful read of Levitt’s ideas indicate that he o(cid:27)ers standardization as a strategic option, not a fact.
Although global marketing has its pitfalls, it can also yield impressive advantages.
Standardized products can lower operating costs.
Even more important, e(cid:27)ective coordination can exploit a company’s best product and marketing ideas.

6.4.2 Reasons for entering international markets Many marketers have found the international marketplace to be extremely hostile.
A study by Baker and Kynak,4forexample,foundthatlessthan20percentof(cid:28)rmsinTexaswithexportpotentialactuallycarried out business in international markets.
But although many (cid:28)rms view in markets with trepidation, others still make the decision to go international.
Why?
In one study, the following motivating factors were given for initiating overseas marketing involvement (in order of importance): 1. large market size 2. stability through diversi(cid:28)cation 3. pro(cid:28)t potential 4. unsolicited orders 5. proximity of market 6. excess capacity 7. o(cid:27)er by foreign distributor AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>116 CHAPTER 6.
MARKETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE 8. increasing growth rate 9. smoothing out business cycles Other empirical studies over a number of years have pointed to a wide variety of reasons why companies initiate international involvement.
These include the saturation of the domestic market, which leads (cid:28)rms eithertoseekotherlesscompetitivemarketsortotakeonthecompetitorinitshomemarkets;theemergence ofnewmarkets, particularlyinthedevelopingworld; governmentincentivestoexport; taxincentiveso(cid:27)ered by foreign governments to establish manufacturing plants in their countries in order to create jobs; the availabilityofcheaperormoreskilledlabor; andanattempttominimizetherisksofarecessioninthehome country and spread risk.
6.4.3 Reasons to avoid international markets Despite attractive opportunities, most businesses do not enter foreign markets.
The reasons given for not going international are numerous.
The biggest barrier to entering foreign markets is seen to be a fear by these companies that their products are not marketable overseas, and a consequent preoccupation with the domestic market.
The following points were highlighted by the (cid:28)ndings in the previously mentioned study by Barker and Kaynak, who listed the most important barriers: 1. too much red tape 2. trade barriers 3. transportation di(cid:30)culties 4. lack of trained personnel 5. lack of incentives 6. lack of coordinated assistance 7. unfavorable conditions overseas 8. slow payments by buyers 9. lack of competitive products 10. payment defaults 11. language barriers It is the combination of these factors that determines not only whether companies become involved in international markets, but also the degree of any involvement.
6.4.4 The stages of going international Earlier in our discussion on de(cid:28)nitions, we identi(cid:28)ed several terms that relate to how committed a (cid:28)rm is to being international.
Here we expand on these concepts and explain the rationale behind this process.
Two points should be noted.
First, the process tends to be ranked in order of "least risk and investment" to "greatest involvement(cid:17).
Second, these are not necessarily sequential steps, even though exporting is apparently most common as an initial entry.
Firms typically approach involvement in international marketing rather cautiously, and there appears to exist an underlying lifecycle that has a series of critical success factors that change as a (cid:28)rm moves through each stage.
For small-and medium-sized (cid:28)rms in particular, exporting remains the most promising alternative to a full-blooded international marketing e(cid:27)ort, since it appears to o(cid:27)er a degree of control over risk, cost, and resource commitment.
Indeed, exporting, especially by the smaller (cid:28)rms, is often initiated as a response to an unsolicited overseas order-these are often perceived to be less risky.
6.4.5 Exporting In general, exporting is a simple and low risk-approach to entering foreign markets.
Firms may choose to export products for several reasons.
First, products in the maturity stage of their domestic life cycle may (cid:28)nd new growth opportunities overseas, as Perrier chose to do in the US.
Second, some (cid:28)rms (cid:28)nd it less AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>117 risky and more pro(cid:28)table to expand by exporting current products instead of developing new products.
Third, (cid:28)rms who face seasonal domestic demand may choose to sell their products to foreign markets when those products are "in season" there.
Finally, some (cid:28)rms may elect to export products because there is less competition overseas.
A(cid:28)rmcanexportitsproductsinoneofthreeways: indirectexporting, semi-directexporting, anddirect exporting.
Indirect exporting is a common practice among (cid:28)rms that are just beginning their exporting.
Sales, whether foreign or domestic, are treated as domestic sales.
All sales are made through the (cid:28)rm’s do- mesticsalesdepartment,asthereisnoexportdepartment.
Indirectexportinginvolvesverylittleinvestment, asnooverseassalesforceorothertypesofcontactsneedbedeveloped.
Indirectexportingalsoinvolveslittle risk,asinternationalmarketingintermediarieshaveknowledgeofmarketsandwillmakefewermistakesthan sellers.
In semi-direct exporting, an American exporter usually initiates the contact through agents, merchant middlemen,orothermanufacturersintheUS.Suchsemi-directexportingcanbehandledinavarietyofways: (a) a combination export manager, a domestic agent intermediary that acts as an exporting department for several noncompeting (cid:28)rms; (b) the manufacturer’s export agent (MEA) operates very much like a manufacturer’sagentindomesticmarketingsettings;(c)aWebb-PomereneExportAssociationmaychooseto limitcooperationtoadvertising,oritmayhandletheexportingoftheproductsoftheassociation’smembers and; (d) piggyback exporting, in which one manufacturer (carrier) that has export facilities and overseas channels of distribution handles the exporting of another (cid:28)rm (rider) noncompeting but complementary products.
When direct exporting is the means of entry into a foreign market, the manufacturer establishes an export department to sell directly to a foreign (cid:28)lm.
The exporting manufacturer conducts market research, establishes physical distribution, and obtains all necessary export documentation.
Direct exporting requires a greater investment and also carries a greater risk.
However, it also provides greater potential return and greater control of its marketing program.
6.4.6 Licensing Under a licensing agreement, a (cid:28)rm (licensor) provides some technology to a foreign (cid:28)rm (licensee) by granting that (cid:28)rm the right to use the licensor’s manufacturing process, brand name, patents, or sales knowledge in return for some payment.
The licensee obtains a competitive advantage in this arrangement, while the licensor obtains inexpensive access to a foreign market.
A licensing arrangement contains risk, in that if the business is very successful, pro(cid:28)t potentials are limited by the licensing agreement.
Alternatively, a licensor makes a long-term commitment to a (cid:28)rm and that (cid:28)rm may be less capable than expected.
Or, the licensee may be unwilling to invest the necessary resources as needed to be successful.
Licensing may be the least pro(cid:28)table alternative for market entry.
Scarce capital, import restrictions, or government restrictions may make this the only feasible means for selling in another country.
Franchising represents a very popular type of licensing arrangement for many consumer products (cid:28)rms.
HolidayInn, HertzCarRental, andMcDonald’shaveallexpandedintoforeignmarketsthroughfranchising.
6.4.7 Joint ventures A joint venture is a partnership between a domestic (cid:28)rm and a foreign (cid:28)rm.
Both partners invest money and share ownership and control of partnership.
Joint ventures require a greater commitment from (cid:28)rms than licensing or the various other exporting methods.
They have more risk and less (cid:29)exibility.
A domestic (cid:28)rm may wish to engage in a joint venture for a variety of reasons; for example, General Motors and Toyota have agreed to make a subcompact car to be sold through GM dealers using the idle GM plant in California.
Toyota’s motivation was to avoid US import quotas and taxes on cars without any US-made parts.

6.4.9 US commercial centers Another method of doingbusiness overseas has come in theform of US Commercial Centers.
ACommercial Center serves the purpose of providing additional resources for the promotion of exports of US goods and services to host countries.
The Commercial Center does so by familiarizing US exporters with industries, markets,andcustomsofhostcountries.
Theyarefacilitatingagenciesthatassistwiththethreearrangements just discussed.
US Commercial Centers provide business facilities such as exhibition space, conference rooms, and o(cid:30)ce space.
Theyprovidetranslationandclericalservices.
Theyhaveacommerciallibrary.
Theyhavecommercial law information and trade promotion facilities, including the facilitation of contacts between buyers, sellers, bankers, distributors, agents, and government o(cid:30)cials.
They also coordinate trade missions and assist with contracts and export and import arrangements.
6.4.10 Trade intermediaries Small manufacturers who are interested in building their foreign sales are turning to trade intermediaries to assist them in the sale and distribution of their products.
These entrepreneurial middlemen typically buy US-produced goods at 15 per cent below a manufacturer’s best discount and then resell the products in overseas markets.
These trade intermediaries account for about 10 per cent of all US exports9.
The trade intermediary provides a valuable service to small companies, which often do not have the resources or expertise to market their products overseas.
The trade intermediaries have developed relationships with foreign countries; these relationships are time-consuming and expensive to develop.
6.4.11 Alliances Heineken, the premium Dutch beer, is consumed by more people in more countries than any other beer10.
It is also the number-one imported beer in America.
Miller and Budweiser, the two largest American beer producers, have entered into global competition with Heineken, partly because the American beer market has been (cid:29)at.
They are doing so by forming alliances with global breweries such as Molson, Corona, and Dos Equis.
Heineken has responded to the challenge, heavily promoting products such as Amstel Light and Murphy’sIrishStout.

6.5 The international marketing plan8 It should be apparent by now that companies and organizations planning to compete e(cid:27)ectively in world markets need a clear and well-focused international marketing plan that is based on a thorough understand- ing of the markets in which the company is introducing its products.
The challenge, then, of international 8Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35429/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>119 marketing is to ensure that any international strategy has the discipline of thorough research, and an un- derstanding and accurate evaluation of what is required to achieve the competitive advantage.
As such, the decision sequence in international marketing (see Exhibit 6.1) is much larger than that of domestic markets.
As noted in the next Integrated Marketing box, it is also more complicated.
See below.
Exhibit 6.1: The decision sequence in international marketing 6.5.1 The corporate level We begin at the corporate level, where (cid:28)rms decide whether to become involved in international markets and determine the resources they are willing to commit.
Thus, this stage is primarily concerned with the analysis of international markets.

MARKETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE 6.5.2 The business level Business-level considerations begin with the assessment of the stakeholders involved in the business.
It is important to clearly identify the di(cid:27)erent stakeholder groups, understand their expectations, and evaluate their power, because the stakeholders provide the broad guidelines within which the (cid:28)rm operates.
In the case of international marketing, it is particularly important to address the concerns of the stakeholders in the host company.
Thesituationanalysisconcernsathoroughexaminationofthefactorsthatin(cid:29)uencethebusinesses’ability to successfully market a product or service.
The results lead to a realistic set of objectives.
Conducting a situation analysis in an international setting is a bit more extensive.
It not only includes the normal assessment of external environmental factors and resources/capabilities, it also includes a determination of the level of commitment exhibited by the business, as well as possible methods of entry.
These last two factors are interrelated in that a company’s level of commitment to international markets will directly in(cid:29)uence whether they employ exporting, a joint venture, or some other method of entry.
In turn, level of commitment and method of entry are in(cid:29)uenced by the evaluation of environmental factors as well as resources and capabilities.
The latter audits not only the weaknesses of the company, but also the strengths of the company, which are often taken for granted.
This is particularly important in international markets; for example, customer brand loyalty may be much stronger in certain markets than others, and products may be at the end of their life in the domestic market but may be ideal for less sophisticated markets.
Itisimportant, too, toevaluatethecapacityofthe(cid:28)rmtobe(cid:29)exible, adaptable, andproactive, asthese are the attributes necessary, for success in a highly competitive and rapidly changing world.
Undoubtedly, environmental factors have received the most attention from marketers considering inter- national markets.

Itisimportanttostressthatthere is a need for realism in this, as only too frequently corporate plans are determined more by the desire for short-term credibility with shareholders than with the likelihood that they will be achieved.
The process adopted for determining long-term and short-term objectives is important and varies signif- icantly, depending on the size of the business, the nature of the market and the abilities and motivation of managers in di(cid:27)erent markets.
At an operational level, the national managers need to have an achievable and detailed plan for each country, which will take account of the local situation, explain what is expected of them, and how their performance will be measured.
Examples of objectives might be: • (cid:28)nancial performance, including return on investment and pro(cid:28)tability • market penetration, including sales (by volume and value), market share by product category • customer growth, by volume and pro(cid:28)tability • distribution, including strength in supply chain, number of outlets • brand awareness and value • new product introductions and di(cid:27)usion • company image, including quality and added value (or service) 6.5.3 The functional level Having set the objectives for the company, both at the corporate level and the business level, the company cannowdevelopadetailedprogramoffunctionalactivitiestoachievetheobjectives.
Followingtheintegrated approach employed throughout this text, each of the functional elements (e.g.
(cid:28)nance, human resources, research) must be considered jointly.
The international marketing strategy is doomed to failure if human resources can not (cid:28)nd and train the appropriate employees, or research can not modify the product so that AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>121 itisacceptabletoconsumersinanothercountry.
Ultimately, thiscoordinationbetweenbusinessfunctionsis contingent on the market entry strategy employed as well as the degree of standardization or customization deemed.
Having integrated at the function level, we next consider integration of the marketing mix elements.
6.5.3.1 Product/promotion Keegan has highlighted the key aspect of marketing strategy as a combination of standardization or adapta- tion of product and promotion elements of the mix and o(cid:27)ers (cid:28)ve alternative and more speci(cid:28)c approaches to product policy: 1.
One product, one message, worldwide: While a number of writers have argued that this will be the strategy adopted for many products in the future, in practice only a handful of products might claim to have achieved this already.
2.
Product extension, promotion adaptation: While the product stays the same this strategy allows for the adaptation of the promotional e(cid:27)ort either to target new customer segments or to appeal to the particular tastes of individual countries.
3.
Productadaptation,promotionextension: Thisstrategyisusedifapromotionalcampaignhasachieved international appeal, but the product needs to be adapted because of local needs.
4.
Dual adaptation: By adapting both products and promotion for each market, the (cid:28)rm is adopting a totally di(cid:27)erentiated approach.
5.
Product invention: Firms, usually from advanced nations, that are supplying products to less well- developed countries adopt product invention.
Another critical element that is closely aligned with the product and promotion is the brand.
Anthony O’Reilly, Chairman of H.J.
Heinz, believes that the communications revolution and the convergence of cultures have now set the stage for truly global marketing.
The age of the global brand is at hand.
For example, Heinz was looking to expand its 9 Lives cat food brand and Morris the Cat logo into Moscow.
Although it isa stable and successful brand inthe US, testing and research doneby Dimitri Epimov, alocal marketing manager in Moscow, led Heinz executives to make a marketing change to ensure the product’s success in Russia.
Namely, a fatter-looking Morris was created for packaging.
Another discovery: While Americans tend to treat their kitties with tuna, Russian cat-lovers prefer to serve beef-(cid:29)avored food.
As discussed earlier, product positioning is a key success factor and re(cid:29)ects the customer’s perceptions of the product or service.
However, in countries at di(cid:27)erent stages of economic development, the customer segments that are likely to be able to purchase the product and the occasions on which it is bought may be signi(cid:28)cantly di(cid:27)erent.
For example, while KFC and McDonald’s restaurants aim at everyday eating for the mass market in the developed countries, in less-developed countries they are perceived as places for special-occasion eating, and are beyond the reach of the poorest segments of the population.
The product positioning, therefore, must vary in some dimensions.
In con(cid:28)rming the positioning of a product or service in a speci(cid:28)c market or region, it is therefore necessary to establish in the consumer perception exactly what the product stands for and how it di(cid:27)ers from existing and potential competition by designing an identity that con(cid:28)rms the value of the product.
6.5.3.2 Pricing Pricing products in foreign nations is complicated by exchange rate (cid:29)uctuations, tari(cid:27)s, governmental inter- vention, and shipping requirements.
A common strategy involves a marketer setting a lower price for their productsinforeignmarkets.
Thisstrategyisconsistentwiththelowincomelevelsofmanyforeigncountries, andthelowerpricehelpstobuildmarketshare.
Pricingstrategiesarealsostronglyin(cid:29)uencedbythenature and intensity of the competition in the various markets.
For these reasons, it is important to recognize at the outset that the development and implementation of pricing strategies in international markets should follow the following stages: AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>122 CHAPTER 6.
MARKETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE 1. analyzing the factors that in(cid:29)uence international pricing, such as the cost structures, the value of the product, the market structure, competitor pricing levels, and a variety of environmental constraints 2. con(cid:28)rming the impact the corporate strategies should have on pricing policy 3. evaluating the various strategic pricing options and selecting the most appropriate approach 4. implementing the strategy through the use of a variety of tactics and procedures to set prices 5. managing prices and (cid:28)nancing international transactions Perhapsthemostcriticalfactortobeconsideredwhendevelopingapricingstrategyininternationalmarkets, however, is how the customers and competitors will respond.
Nagle has suggested nine factors that in(cid:29)u- ence the sensitivity of customers to prices, and all have implications for the international marketer.
Price sensitivity reduces: The more distinctive the product is: • the greater the perceived quality • the less aware consumers are of substitutes in the market • if it is di(cid:30)cult to make comparisons • if the price of a product represents a small proportion of total expenditure of the customer • as the perceived bene(cid:28)t increases • if the product is used in association with a product bought previously • if costs are shared with other parties • if the product cannot be stored Finally,thereareseveralinherentproblemsassociatedwithpricingininternationalmarkets.
Oftencompanies (cid:28)nd it di(cid:30)cult to coordinate and control prices across their activities in order to enable them to achieve e(cid:27)ective (cid:28)nancial performance and their desired price positioning.
Simply, how can prices be coordinated by the company across the various markets and still make the necessary pro(cid:28)t?
Di(cid:30)culty answering this question has led to two serious problems.
Dumping (when a (cid:28)rm sells a product in a foreign country below itsdomesticpriceorbelowitsactualcosts)isoftendonetobuildacompany’sshareofthemarketbypricing at a competitive level.
Another reason is that the products being sold may be surplus or cannot be sold domestically and are therefore already a burden to the company.
When companies price their products very high in some countries but competitively in others, they engage in a gray market strategy.
A gray market, also called parallel importing, is a situation where products are sold through unauthorized channels of distribution.
A gray market comes about when individuals buy products in a lower-priced country from a manufacturer’s authorized retailer, ship them to higher-priced countries, and then sell them below the manufacturer’s suggested price through unauthorized retailers.
Considerable problems arise in foreign transactions because of the need to buy and sell products in di(cid:27)erent currencies.
Questions to consider are: What currency should a company price its products?
How should a company deal with (cid:29)uctuating exchange rates?
Finally, obtaining payment promptly and in a suitable currency from less developed countries can cause expenseandadditionaldi(cid:30)culties.
Howshouldacompanydealwithsellingtocountrieswherethereisarisk ofnonpayment?
Howshouldacompanyapproachsellingtocountriesthathaveashortageofhardcurrency?
6.5.3.3 Distribution and logistics Distribution channels are the means by which goods are distributed from the manufacturer to the end user.
Logistics, or physical distribution management, is concerned with the planning, implementing, and control of physical (cid:29)ows of materials and (cid:28)nal goods from points of origin to points of use to meet customer needs at a pro(cid:28)t. Essentially there are three channel links between the seller and buyer.
The (cid:28)rst link is the seller’s headquarters organization, which is responsible for supervising the channel, and acts as part of the channel itself.
Channels between countries represent the second link.
They are responsible for getting products to overseas markets and payment in return.
Finally, the third link is the channel structure (logistics) within countries, which distributes the products from their point of entry to the (cid:28)nal consumer.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>123 Distribution strategies within overseas markets are a(cid:27)ected by various uncontrollable factors.
First, wholesaling and retailing structure di(cid:27)ers widely from one nation to the next.
So, too, does the quality of service provided.
Di(cid:27)erences in the size and nature of retailers are even more pronounced.
Retailers more closely re(cid:29)ect the economic conditions and culture of that country; many small retailers dominate most of these countries.
Physicaldistributiontooverseasmarketsoftenrequiresspecialmarketingplanning.
Manycountrieshave inadequate docking facilities, limited highways, various railroad track gauges, too few vehicles, and too few warehouses.
Managingproductinventoriesrequiresconsiderationoftheavailabilityofsuitablewarehousing, as well as the costs of shipping in small quantities.
6.5.3.4 The budget Marketing mix components must be evaluated as part of an overall marketing strategy.
Therefore, the orga- nization must establish a marketing budget based on the required marketing e(cid:27)ort to in(cid:29)uence consumers.
Themarketingbudgetrepresentsaplantoallocateexpenditurestoeachofthecomponentsofthemarketing mix.
Forexample,the(cid:28)rmmustestablishanadvertisingbudgetaspartofthemarketingbudgetandallocate expenditures to various types of advertising media(cid:22)television, newspapers, magazines.
A sales promotion budget should also be determined, allocating money for coupons, product samples, and trade promotions.
Similarly, budgets are required for personal selling, distribution, and product development.
How much should be spent?
Consider the following example.
A common question that marketers frequentlyaskis,"Arewespendingenough(ortoomuch)topromotethesaleofourproducts?
"Areasonable answerwouldrevolvearoundanotherconsideration: "Whatdowewanttoaccomplish?
Whatareourgoals?"
The discussion should next turn to the methods for achievement of goals and the removal of obstacles to these goals.
This step is often skipped or avoided.
Usually, when the question is asked, "Are we spending enough?"
an automatic answer is given, in terms ofwhatothersspend.
Knowingwhatothersinthesameindustryspendcanbeimportanttoanorganization whose performance lags behind the competition or to an organization that suspects that its expenditures are higher than they need to be.
But generally, knowing what others spend leads to an unproductive "keeping-up-with-the-Joneses" attitude.
It also assumes that the others know what they are doing.
6.5.3.5 Evaluating results No marketing program is planned and implemented perfectly.
Marketing managers will tell you that they experience many surprises during the course of their activities.
In an e(cid:27)ort to ensure that performance goes according to plans, marketing managers establish controls that allow marketers to evaluate results and identify needs for modi(cid:28)cations in marketing strategies and programs.
Surprises occur, but marketing managers who have established sound control procedures can react to surprises quickly and e(cid:27)ectively.
Marketing control involves a number of decisions.
One decision is what function to monitor.
Some organizations monitor their entire marketing program, while others choose to monitor only a part of it, such as their sales force or their advertising program.
A second set of decisions concerns the establishment of standards for performance; e.g.
market share, pro(cid:28)tability, or sales.
A third set of decisions concerns how to collect information for making comparisons between actual performance and standards.
Finally, to the extent that discrepancies exist between actual and planned performance, adjustments in the marketing program or the strategic plan must be made.
Once a plan is put into action, a marketing manager must still gather information related to the ef- fectiveness with which the plan was implemented.

MARKETING ON A GLOBAL SCALE 6.6 The international marketing environment9 A number of factors constitute the international environment: social, cultural, political, legal, competitive, economic,plustechnology.
Eachshouldbeevaluatedbeforeacompanymakesadecisiontogointernational.
6.6.1 The social/cultural environment The cultural environment consists of the in(cid:29)uence of religious, family, educational, and social systems in the marketing system.
Marketers who intend to market their products overseas may be very sensitive to foreign cultures.
While the di(cid:27)erences between our cultural background in the United States and those of foreign nations may seem small, marketers who ignore these di(cid:27)erences risk failure in implementing marketing programs.
Failure to consider cultural di(cid:27)erences is one of the primary reasons for marketing failures overseas.
This task is not as easy as it sounds as various features of a culture can create an illusion of similarity.
Evenacommonlanguagedoesnotguaranteesimilarityofinterpretation.
Forexample,intheUSwepurchase "cans" of various grocery products, but the British purchase "tins".
A number of cultural di(cid:27)erences can causemarketersproblemsinattemptingtomarkettheirproductsoverseas.
Theseinclude: (a)language, (b) color, (c) customs and taboos, (d) values, (e) aesthetics, (f) time, (g) business norms, (h) religion, and (i) social structures.
Each is discussed in the following sections.
6.6.2 Language The importance of language di(cid:27)erences cannot be overemphasized, as there are almost 3,000 languages in the world.
Language di(cid:27)erences cause many problems for marketers in designing advertising campaigns and product labels.
Language problems become even more serious once the people of a country speak several languages.
For example, in Canada, labels must be in both English and French.
In India, there are over 200 di(cid:27)erent dialects, and a similar situation exists in China.
6.6.3 Colors Colors also have di(cid:27)erent meanings in di(cid:27)erent cultures.
For example, in Egypt, the country’s national color of green is considered unacceptable for packaging, because religious leaders once wore it.
In Japan, black and white are colors of mourning and should not be used on a product’s package.
Similarly, purple is unacceptable in Hispanic nations because it is associated with death.
Considerhowthefollowingexamplescouldbeusedindevelopmentofinternationalmarketingprograms: • In Russia, it is acceptable for men to greet each other with a kiss, but this custom is not acceptable in the US.
• Germans prefer their salad dressing in a tube, while Americans prefer it in a bottle.
• InFrance,wineisservedwithmostmeals,butinAmerica,milk,tea,water,andsoftdrinksarepopular.
McDonalds’s Corporation has opened 20 restaurants in India.
Since 80 percent of Indians are Hindu, Mc- Donald’s will use a nonbeef meat substitute for its traditional hamburger.
The likely beef substitute will be lamb, a very popular meat in India.
In anticipation of its restaurant openings, McDonald’s conducted extensive market research, site selection studies, and developed a relationship with India’s largest chicken supplier.
McDonald’s has opted to market its product in India, largely because India’s population of more than 900 million represents one sixth of the world’s population.

For example,inAmericaweplaceaveryhighvalueonmaterialwell-being,andaremuchmorelikelytopurchase status symbols than people in India.
Similarly, in India, the Hindu religion forbids the consumption of beef, and fast-food restaurants such as McDonald’s and Burger King would encounter tremendous di(cid:30)culties withoutproductmodi(cid:28)cation.

InItaly,salespeoplecallonwomenonlyiftheirhusbands are at home.
6.6.5 Aesthetics The term aesthetics is used to refer to the concepts of beauty and good taste.
The phrase, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" is a very appropriate description for the di(cid:27)erences in aesthetics that exist between cultures.
For example, Americans believe that suntans are attractive, youthful, and healthy.
However, the Japanese do not.
6.6.6 Time Americans seem to befanatical abouttime when comparedto other cultures.
Punctuality anddeadlines are routine business practices in the US.
However, salespeople who set de(cid:28)nite appointments for sales calls in the Middle East and Latin America will have a lot of time on their hands, as business people from both of these cultures are far less bound by time constraints.
To many of these cultures, setting a deadline such as "I have to know next week" is considered pushy and rude.
6.6.7 Business norms The norms of conducting business also vary from one country to the next.
Here are several examples of foreign business behavior that di(cid:27)er from US business behavior: • In France, wholesalers do not like to promote products.
They are mainly interested in supplying retailers with the products they need.
• In Russia, plans of any kind must be approved by a seemingly endless string of committees.
As a result, business negotiations may take years.
• South Americans like to talk business "nose to nose".
This desire for close physical proximity causes American business people to back away from the constantly forward-moving South Americans.
• In Japan, businesspeople have mastered the tactic of silence in negotiations.
Americans are not pre- pared for this, and they panic because they think something has gone wrong.
The result is that Americans become impatient, push for a closure, and often make business concessions they later re- gret.
These norms are re(cid:29)ected in the di(cid:30)culty of introducing the Web into Europe (see the next Integrated Marketing box).

But for other religions, religious holidays do not serve as popular times for purchasing products.
Women do not participate in household buying decisions in countries in which religion serves as opposition to women’s rights movements.
Every culture has a social structure, but some seem less widely de(cid:28)ned than others.
That is, it is more di(cid:30)cult to move upward in a social structure that is rigid.

6.6.9 The political/legal environment Thepolitical/legalenvironmentabroadisquitedi(cid:27)erentfromthatoftheUS.Mostnationsdesiretobecome self-reliant and to raise their status in the eyes of the rest of the world.
This is the essence of nationalism.
The nationalistic spirit that exists in many nations has led them to engage in practices that have been very damaging to other countries’ marketing organizations.
For example, foreign governments can intervene in marketing programs in the following ways: • contracts for the supply and delivery of goods and services • the registration and enforcement of trademarks, brand names, and labeling • patents • marketing communications • pricing • product safety, acceptability, and environmental issues 6.6.9.1 Political stability Business activity tends to grow and thrive when a nation is politically stable.
When a nation is politically unstable, multinational (cid:28)rms can still conduct business pro(cid:28)tably.
Their strategies will be a(cid:27)ected however.
Most (cid:28)rms probably prefer to engage in the export business rather than invest considerable sums of money in investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Inventories will be low and currency will be converted rapidly.
The result is that consumers in the foreign nation pay high prices, get less satisfactory products, and have fewer jobs.
6.6.9.2 Monetary circumstances The exchange rate of a particular nation’s currency represents the value of that currency in relation to that ofanothercountry.
Governmentssetsomeexchangeratesindependentlyoftheforcesofsupplyanddemand.
Theforcesofsupplyanddemandsetothers.
Ifacountry’sexchangerateislowcomparedtoothercountries, that country’s consumers must pay higher prices on imported goods.
While the concept of exchange rates appears relatively simple, these rates (cid:29)uctuate widely and often, thus creating high risks for exp0rters and importers.
6.6.9.3 Trading blocs and agreements US companies make one-third of their revenues from products marketed abroad, in places such as Asia and Latin America.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) further boosts export sales by enabling companies to sell goods at lower prices because of reduced tari(cid:27)s. Regional trading blocs represent agroupofnationsthatjointogetherandformallyagreetoreducetradebarriersamongthemselves.
NAFTA is such a bloc.
Its members include the US, Canada, and Mexico.
No tari(cid:27)s exist on goods sold between member nations of NAFTA.
However, a uniform tari(cid:27) is assessed on products from countries not a(cid:30)liated with NAFTA.
In addition, NAFTA seeks common standards for labeling requirements, food additives, and package sizes.
One of the potentially interesting results of trade agreements like NAFTA is that many products pre- viously restricted by dumping laws, laws designed to keep out foreign products, would be allowed to be marketed.
The practice of dumping involves a company selling products in overseas markets at very low prices, one intention being to steal business from local competitors.
These laws were designed to prevent pricing practices that could seriously harm local competition.
The laws were designed to prevent large producers from (cid:29)ooding markets with very low priced products, gain a monopoly, and then raise prices to AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>127 very high levels.
In 1993, about 40 nations, counting the European Community as one, had anti-dumping legislation.
Those in favor of agreements argue that anti-dumping laws penalize those companies who are capable of competing in favor of those companies that are not competitive.
Almost all the countries in the Western hemisphere have entered into one or more regional trade agree- ments.
Such agreements are designed to facilitate trade through the establishment of a free trade area customs union or customs market.
Free trade areas and customs unions eliminate trade barriers between member countries while maintaining trade barriers with nonmember countries.
Customs Unions maintain common tari(cid:27)s and rates for nonmember countries.
A common market provides for harmonious (cid:28)scal and monetarypolicieswhilefreetradeareasandcustomsunionsdonot.
Tradeagreementsarebecomingagrow- ing force for trade liberalization; the development of such agreements provides for tremendous opportunities for US companies doing business in Latin America and North America.
The creation of the single European market in 1992 was expected to change the way marketing is done worldwide.
It meant the birth of a market that was larger than the United States, and the introduction of European Currency Units (Euros) in place of the individual currencies of member nations.
Experience in multilingual marketing would help non-European companies succeed in this gigantic market.
With new technologies such as multilingual processing programs, it would be possible to target potential customers anywhere in Europe, in any language, and in the same marketing campaign.
Progress toward European uni(cid:28)cation has been slow-many doubt that complete uni(cid:28)cation will ever be achieved.
However,on1January1999,11ofthe15membernationstookasigni(cid:28)cantsteptowarduni(cid:28)cation by adopting the Euro as the common currency.
These 11 nations represent 290 million people and a USD 6.5 trillion market.
Still, with 14 di(cid:27)erent languages and distinctive national customs, it is unlikely that the EU will ever become the "United States of Europe(cid:17).
6.6.9.4 Tari(cid:27)s Mostnationsencouragefreetradebyinviting(cid:28)rmstoinvestandtoconductbusinessthere,whileencouraging domestic (cid:28)rms to engage in overseas business.
These nations do not usually try to strictly regulate imports or discriminate against foreign-based (cid:28)rms.
There are, however, some governments that openly oppose free trade.
For example, many Communist nations desire self-su(cid:30)ciency.
Therefore, they restrict trade with non-Communist nations.
But these restrictions vary with East-West relations.
The most common form of restriction of trade is the tari(cid:27), a tax placed on imported goods.
Protective tari(cid:27)sareestablishedinordertoprotectdomesticmanufacturersagainstcompetitorsbyraisingthepricesof imported goods.
Not surprisingly, US companies with a strong business tradition in a foreign country may support tari(cid:27)s to discourage entry by other US competitors.
6.6.9.5 Expropriation All multinational (cid:28)rms face the risk of expropriation.
That is, the foreign government takes ownership of plants, sometimes without compensating the owners.
However, in many expropriations there has been payment, and it is often equitable.
Many of these facilities end up as private rather than government orga- nizations.
Because of the risk of expropriation, multinational (cid:28)rms are at the mercy of foreign governments, which are sometimes unstable, and which can change the laws they enforce at any point in time to meet their needs.
6.6.10 The technological environment The level of technological development of a nation a(cid:27)ects the attractiveness of doing business there, as well as the type of operations that are possible.
Marketers in developed nations cannot take many technological advancesforgranted.

• Lackofdataprocessingfacilitiesmakesthetasksofplanning,implementing,andcontrollingmarketing strategy more di(cid:30)cult.
6.6.11 The economic environment A nation’s economic situation represents its current and potential capacity to produce goods and services.
The key to understanding market opportunities lies in the evaluation of the stage of a nation’s economic growth.
A way of classifying the economic growth of countries is to divide them into three groups: (a) industri- alized, (b) developing, and (c) less-developed nations.
The industrialized nations are generally considered to be the United States, Japan, Canada, Russia, Australia, and most of Western Europe The economies of these nations are characterized by private enterprise and a consumer orientation.
They have high literacy, modem technology, and higher per capita incomes.
Developing nations are those that are making the transition from economies based on agricultural and raw materials production to industrial economies.
Many Latin American nations (cid:28)t into this category, and they exhibit rising levels of education, technology, and per capita incomes, Finally, there are many less developed nations in today’s world.
These nations have low standards of living, literacy rates are low, and technology is very limited.
Usually, the most signi(cid:28)cant marketing opportunities exist among the industrialized nations, as they have high levels of income, one of the necessary ingredients for the formation of markets.
However, most industrialized nations also have stable population bases, and market saturation for many products already existing.
The developing nations, on the other hand, have growing population bases, and although they currently import limited goods and services, the long-run potential for growth in these nations exists.
De- pendentsocietiesseekproductsthatsatisfybasicneeds-food,clothing,housing,medicalcare,andeducation.
Marketers in such nations must be educators, emphasizing information in their market programs.
As the degree of economic development increases, so does the sophistication of the marketing e(cid:27)ort focused on the countries.
6.6.12 The competitive environment Entering an international market is similar to doing so in a domestic market, in that a (cid:28)rm seeks to gain a di(cid:27)erentialadvantagebyinvestingresourcesinthatmarket.
Oftenlocal(cid:28)rmswilladoptimitationstrategies, sometimes successfully.
When they are successful, their own nation’s economy receives a good boost.
When they are not successful, the multinational (cid:28)rm often buys them out.
Japanese marketers have developed an approach to managing product costs that has given them a com- petitive advantage over US competitors.
A typical American company will design a new product, then calculate the cost.
If the estimated cost is too high, the product will be taken back to the drawing board.
In Japan, a company typically starts with a target cost based on the price that it estimates the market is most willing to accept.
Product designers and engineers are then directed to meet the cost target.
This approach also encourages managers to worry less about product costs and more about the role it should play in gaining market share.
Brie(cid:29)y, at Japanese companies like NEC, Nissan, Sharp, and Toyota, a team charged with bringing a product idea to market estimates the price at which the product is most likely to appeal to the market.
From this (cid:28)rst important judgment, all else follows.
After deducting the required pro(cid:28)t margin from the selling price, planners develop estimates of each element that make up the product’s cost: engineering, manufacturing sales, and marketing.
US (cid:28)rms tend to build products, (cid:28)gure how much it coststobuildtheproduct,andthenaskwhethertheproductcanbesoldatapro(cid:28)tableprice.
UScompanies tend not to assess what the market will be willing to pay.

Thegoalofoperationsmanagementistomaximizee(cid:30)ciencywhileproducing goods and services that e(cid:27)ectively ful(cid:28)ll customer needs.
For example, if an organization makes furniture, some of the operations management decisions involve the purchasing of wood and fabric, the hiring and training of workers, the location and layout of the furniture factory, and the purchase of cutting tools and other fabrication equipment.
If the organization makes good operations decisions, it will be able to produce a(cid:27)ordable, functional, and attractive furniture that customers will purchase at a price that will earn pro(cid:28)ts for the company.
In another example, the owners of a restaurant must make important decisions regarding the location, layout, and seating capacity of the restaurant, the hiring, training, and scheduling of chefs and servers, the suppliers of fresh food at the right prices, and the purchase of stoves, refrigerators, and other food preparation equipment.
If the restaurant owners make good operations decisions, they will be able to meet their customers’ needs for delicious and a(cid:27)ordable food that is served in a pleasing atmosphere.
The owners in turn will be able to charge a price that earns a pro(cid:28)t and allows the restaurant to stay in business.
7.2.1 One of three strategic functions Operations is one of the three strategic functions of any organization.
This means that it is a vital part of accomplishing the organization’s strategy and ensuring its long-term survival.
The other two areas of strategic importance to the organization are marketing and (cid:28)nance.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT company must have strong operations skills so it can provide customized team jerseys that are attractive, durable, a(cid:27)ordable and delivered on time to the customer.
The operations strategy should support the overall organization strategy.
For example, JetBlue airlines is a successful airline that has an organization strategy of providing high-value air transportation service to travelers.
JetBlue strives to provide fun, comfortable, and safe air service to popular destinations at a price that middle-income passengers can a(cid:27)ord.
Given JetBlue’s organization strategy, JetBlue features an operations strategy that focuses on low costs, competent and service-oriented employees, and reliable aircraft.
JetBlue’s operations strategy is driven by its organization strategy.
For example, JetBlue locates ((cid:16)lo- cation(cid:17) is an operations decision area) its main transportation hub in New York City, a city of 19 million peoplethathelpsensurethatJetBlue’splanes(cid:29)yatfullcapacity.
Intheareaofequipmentdecisions,JetBlue operates only one type of aircraft, the Airbus 320.
The Airbus 320 has high passenger carrying capacity (to maximize revenue), provides good fuel economy and requires only two pilots (versus three) to operate.
Having one type of aircraft reduces training costs for pilots and mechanics, reduces investments in parts inventories, and enables JetBlue to negotiate greater discounts on high-volume purchases from Airbus.
In another key operations area, JetBlue pays careful attention to hiring, training, and compensating employees who can deliver excellent service, loyalty, and high levels of productivity.
In addition to an operations strategy, JetBlue also has (cid:28)nancial and marketing strategies that support its organization strategy.
One part of its (cid:28)nancial strategy is securing su(cid:30)cient amounts of capital to help the start-up airline establish reliable service and gain a loyal clientele.
JetBlue’s marketing strategy keeps advertising costs under control by attracting free media publicity that emphasizes its fun and a(cid:27)ordable airline service.
7.2.2 Strategic versus tactical operations decisions Operationsdecisionsincludedecisionsthatarestrategic innature,meaningthattheyhavelong-termconse- quencesandofteninvolveagreatdealofexpenseandresourcecommitments.
Strategic operationsdecisions include facility location decisions, the type of technologies that the organization will use, determining how labor and equipment are organized, and how much long-term capacity the organization will provide to meet customer demand.
For example, the leaders of a new hospital must decide where to locate the facility to be accessible to a large number of potential patients.
Hospital administrators must evaluate the performance and cost of a wide variety of health equipment.
Administrators must also assess and purchase information technologies to keep patient records, ful(cid:28)ll government regulations, provide accurate and timely communications, and track (cid:28)nancial performance.
Doctors, nurses, and sta(cid:27) must be hired and various departments (x-ray, lab, pharmacy, physical therapy, etc.)
must be arranged to maximize both e(cid:30)ciency and e(cid:27)ectiveness in patient care.
Tactical operations decisions have short to medium term impact on the organization, often involve less commitmentofresources,andcanbechangedmoreeasilythanstrategicdecisions.
Tacticaldecisionsinclude workforce scheduling, establishing quality assurance procedures, contracting with vendors, and managing inventory.
In the hospital example, scheduling the workforce to match patient admissions is critical to both providing quality care and controlling costs.
Selecting a food service vendor is important to serving both employees and patients.
Ensuring that the right drugs and supplies are on hand is achieved by working closely with vendors in the supply chain.
7.2.3 Operations management provides competitive advantage!
Strategic and tactical operations decisions determine how well the organization can accomplish its goals.
They also provide opportunities for the organization to achieve unique competitive advantages that attract and keep customers.
For example, United Parcel Service, an international package delivery service, formed a partnership with itscustomer,Toshibacomputers.

Underthistraditionalapproach,thetotal time to get a laptop computer repaired was two weeks(cid:22)a long time for people to be without their laptop!
Then they came up with an innovative idea for Toshiba to provide better service to its customers.
United Parcel Service hired, trained, and certi(cid:28)ed its own employees to repair Toshiba laptop computers.
The new repairprocessismuchmoree(cid:30)cient: (1)picksupcomputersfromToshibaowners,(2)repairsthecomputers, (3)deliversthecomputersbacktotheirowners.

Most Toshiba customers think that Toshiba is doing a great job of repairing their computers, when in fact Toshiba never touches the computers!
The result of this operations innovation is better service to Toshiba customers and a strong and pro(cid:28)table strategic partnership between and its customer, Toshiba.
7.3 The input/output transformation model3 Operations management transforms inputs (labor, capital, equipment, land, buildings, materials and infor- mation) into outputs (goods and services) that provide added value to customers.
Exhibit 7.1 summarizes the transformation process.
The arrow labeled (cid:16)Transformation System(cid:17) is the critical element in the model that will determine how well the organization produces goods and services that meet customer needs.
It does not matter whether the organization is a for-pro(cid:28)t company, a non-pro(cid:28)t organization (religious orga- nizations, hospitals, etc.
), or a government agency; all organizations must strive to maximize the quality of their transformation processes to meet customer needs.
Exhibit 7.1: Example of typical transformation process The 3M Company is a good example of the strategic importance of transforming inputs into outputs thatprovidecompetitiveadvantageinthemarketplace.
3Mmanufacturesatop-qualityadhesivetapecalled (cid:16)Magic Tape(cid:17).
Magic Tape is used for everyday taping applications, but it o(cid:27)ers attractive features that 3Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35439/1.4/>.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT most other tapes do not, including smooth removal from the tape roll, an adhesive that is sticky enough to hold items in place (but not too sticky that it can not be removed and readjusted if necessary!
), and a non-re(cid:29)ective surface.
For several decades, 3M has enjoyed a substantial pro(cid:28)t margin on its Magic Tape product because 3M engineers make the manufacturing equipment and design the manufacturing processes that produce Magic Tape.
In other words, 3M enjoys a commanding competitive advantage by controlling the transformation processes that turn raw material inputs into the high value-added Magic Tape product.
Controlling the transformation process makes it extremely di(cid:30)cult for competitors to produce tape of the same quality as Magic Tape, allowing 3M to reap signi(cid:28)cant pro(cid:28)ts from this superior product.
An opposite example of the strategic implications of the input/output transformation process is 3M’s decision in the 1980s to stop manufacturing VHS tape for video players and recorders.
In the VHS tape market 3M had no proprietary manufacturing advantage, as there were many Asian competitors that could produce high-quality VHS tape at lower cost.

The two 3M examples of Magic Tape and VHS tape show how important the transformation process and operations management can be to providing and protecting an organization’s competitive advantage.

7.4 Operations decisions4 Countlessoperationsdecisionsthathavebothlong-termandshort-termimpactsontheorganization’sability to produce goods and services that provide added value to customers must be made.
If the organization has made mostly good operations decisions in designing and executing its transformation system to meet the needs of customers, its prospects for long-term survival are greatly enhanced.
Major operations decisions areas include inventory, capacity, quality, scheduling, process type, technology, location, layout, and supply chain management.
Each of these nine decision areas will be discussed in this section.
7.4.1 Inventory decisions The key question that must be answered for inventory is (cid:16)How much?
(cid:17) Understanding the best inventory levels to carry is critical to the organization because too much inventory and too little inventory are both costly to the organization.
Inventory that exceeds what is needed to satisfy customer demand imposes unnecessary costs such as storage, deterioration, obsolescence, theft, and money tied up in inventory that cannot be used for other purposes.
Too little inventory means the organization cannot meet 100 per cent of its customer demand and sales revenues are delayed or lost.

Computer companies such as Dell must carefully manage its computer chip inventory so it can meet current customer orders, but not be stuck with too much inventory if a new computer chip comes out or if vendors reduce prices.
7.4.2 Capacity decisions The question managers must answer for the capacity decision area is the same as the question for inventory: (cid:16)Howmuch?

Long-term capacity decisions involve facilities and major equipment investments.
In 2007, Airbus introduced its Super Jumbo Jet that carries up to 850 passengers and costs USD 3 billion.
The Super Jumbo provides huge amounts of passenger carrying capacity, but before an airline purchases this jet, it needs to decide if it has enough passengers to generate the revenue to pay for the plane and earn pro(cid:28)ts for the airline.
A large single airplane like the Super Jumbo may not be the right capacity decision foranairlinethatservesnumerousmediumsizedcities.
Ontheotherhand,anairlinethatservespassengers traveling between New York City, USA and Shanghai, China might (cid:28)nd the Super Jumbo to be a perfect choice for meeting demand because of the large populations in each city.
Capacity decisions also involve short-term situations.
In a grocery store, the number of customers that need to pay for their groceries at any one point during the day will vary signi(cid:28)cantly.
To provide good customerservice, managersmustmakesurethatsu(cid:30)cientcashregistersandemployeesareonhandtomeet check-out demand.
Similarly, hotels must make sure that they have enough employees to register arriving guests,tocleanhotelrooms,andtoprovidefoodandbeveragestocustomers.
Thesedecisionsmustbemade carefully to avoid excessive labor costs from having too many employees for the number of customers being served.
7.4.3 Quality decisions Thedecisionrelatingtoqualityisnot(cid:16)howmuch(cid:17) qualitytohave.
Ifaskedwhethertheysupporthighquality intheirorganization,virtuallyallmanagerswillrespondenthusiasticallythattheyfullysupporthighquality!
Rather, the quality of goods and services is determined by numerous decisions throughout the organization that have both long-term and short-term consequences for the organization’s quality performance.
For example, while all managers may say they support quality, how many will support the capital expenditure to purchase new equipment that can meet tighter tolerance requirements more consistently?
How many managers will spend money to send their engineers out into the (cid:28)eld to talk to customers to better understand necessary product performance standards?
How many managers will send teams of quality engineers to supplier facilities to assist suppliers with their quality programs?
How much attention and resources does management give to employee skill development and training in the use of quality tools and in the philosophy of defect prevention?
The outcome of these decisions will most certainly a(cid:27)ect an organization’s ability to produce outstanding quality in products and services.
For example, in the air transportation industry, the prevention of crashes is obviously something that everyone supports.
Yet, for the past two decades in the United States, the press has reported on the weaknessesandneglectoftheUSairtra(cid:30)ccontroltechnologythatplaysacriticalroleinairtravelsafety.
One might conclude that although everyone supports safety in air travel, more investment in modern technology and better decision making is needed to ensure the long-term safety of air transportation.
Virtually all organizations are faced with similar decision-making scenarios when it comes to the factors that determine quality performance.
Another example is in the health care industry where one critical measure is the number of surgeries where foreign objects (sponges, instruments, etc.)
are left in surgery patients.
Such incidents are considered to be a serious oversight and totally unacceptable.
In recent years, hospitals have developed processes for preventing these mistakes.
In one approach, a member of the surgical sta(cid:27) tracks every object that enters the body cavity during surgery, then checks that object o(cid:27) when it is removed from the cavity.
Any object thatcannotbeaccountedfortriggersaninspectionofthecavity,andperhapsanx-raytohelp(cid:28)ndtheitem before the incision is closed.
Quality improvement e(cid:27)orts require a great deal of analysis and teamwork, as well as a determined e(cid:27)ort to make quality a top priority in the organization.
Improving quality requires everyone to adopt a (cid:16)continuous improvement(cid:17) philosophy, where everyone approaches their work with the view that there are always opportunities to improve on the organization’s key performance measures.
Continuous improvement e(cid:27)ortsarecomplex,multidimensional,andrequirepartnershipsamongworkers,management,suppliers,and customers.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 7.4.4 Scheduling decisions Scheduling is an operations decision that strives to provide the right mix of labor and machines to produce goods and services at the right time to achieve both e(cid:30)ciency and customer service goals.
For example, a hotel must anticipate the peaks and valleys in demand that may occur during a day, during the week, and at di(cid:27)erent times of the year.
Labor (front desk clerks, room service personnel, housekeepers, bellhops, etc.)
must be scheduled carefully to meet customer demand at any given time, without scheduling excess employees that would impose unnecessary costs on the hotel.
In a hospital setting, scheduling surgeries is a very important activity.
Surgeons, nurses, support sta(cid:27), equipment, supplies, and operating rooms must be scheduled carefully so patient surgeries can be conducted e(cid:27)ectively and e(cid:30)ciently.
At colleges and universities, scheduling the right courses with the right number of classroom seats at the right times is critical to allowing students to graduate on time.
7.4.5 Process decisions Managers must decide how to organize equipment and labor to achieve the competitive goals of the or- ganization.
There are two basic choices for organizing the workplace to produce goods and services: (1) intermittent processes, and (2) repetitive processes.
Intermittentprocessesorganizelaborandequipmentintodepartmentsbysimilarityoffunctiontoserve awidevarietyofproductionrequirements.
Forexample,ahealthcareclinicmustcatertotheindividualneeds of every patient who enters the clinic for treatment.
One patient may have a broken ankle, while another patient may be a pregnant woman who needs a prenatal care checkup.
One patient may be a baby with a fever, while another patient may be getting a prescription medication re(cid:28)lled.
The primary organizational goal for a health clinic is e(cid:27)ectiveness in treating the individual needs of each patient, and an intermittent process is often the most suitable way to organize labor and equipment to provide customized treatment for each individual patient.
X-ray equipment and technicians are organized into an (cid:16)X-ray Department(cid:17).
Other departments are created for pediatrics, lab, gynecology, pharmacy, physical therapy, and many more.
Patients are routed only to the departments that are needed for their particular treatment requirements.
Thisproductionprocessiscalledan(cid:16)intermittent(cid:17) process,becausetheactivityofeachdepartmenthappens intermittently at irregular intervals, depending on the particular needs of di(cid:27)erent patients (customers) at di(cid:27)erent points in time.
Intermittent processes are also used in manufacturing operations where a wide variety of products are manufactured,orwhereproductsaremadetocustomerspeci(cid:28)cations.
Equipmentandlaborcanbeorganized into departments such as drilling, punch press, lathe, machining, painting, heat treating, molding, etc.
Raw materials and components are routed through the facility according to the type and order of manufacturing activities necessary to produce the (cid:28)nished items.
Exhibit 7.2 illustrates how two di(cid:27)erent products, (cid:16)A63(cid:17) and (cid:16)B5(cid:17) make their way through an intermittent process layout.
Exhibit 7.2: Intermittent process (cid:29)ows Repetitive processesareusedtoproduceidenticalorverysimilarproductsinhighvolumes.
Equipment and labor are organized in a line (cid:29)ow arrangement to meet very speci(cid:28)c customer or product processing requirements.
Examples include assembly lines that produce products such as computers, cars, hamburgers, AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>137 automatic car washes, and cafeteria lines.
In all of these cases, the products or customers follow the same production steps to produce a standardized outcome.
Since the production requirements to produce each unit of output are so well understood, there are many opportunities to achieve high levels of e(cid:30)ciency in repetitive process environments.
E(cid:30)ciency is a key goal in repetitive process environments.
Investments in automation and technology are (cid:28)nancially justi(cid:28)ed because the high volume of production spreads out the investment cost over more items/customers.
A paper mill is a good example of a repetitive process.
The manufacturing requirements are well- understood, capital investment inautomation is high, andproduction volume isextremely high to keepunit production costs as low as possible.

Theunits (cid:29)ow through the facility in a uniform pattern until they are completed and shipped to the customer.
Exhibit 7.3: Product (cid:29)ow in a repetitive process The two main di(cid:27)erences between the intermittent and repetitive processes are product variety and product volume.
Intermittent processes are very (cid:29)exible in meeting the individual requirements of di(cid:27)erent products or customers,buttheytendtobeveryine(cid:30)cient,withhighamountsofwaitingtime,workinprocessinventories, and space requirements.
Repetitive processes are very e(cid:30)cient at reducing unit production costs, waiting time, and inventories, but they are not very (cid:29)exible in accommodating high product/customer variety.
A compromise solution is the cellular process layout that captures the advantages of both intermittent and repetitive processes.
A cellular process arranges dissimilar machines and equipment together in a line that is dedicated to producing a speci(cid:28)c family of products that have similar processing requirements.
By setting up multiple dedicatedcells,thefacilitycane(cid:30)cientlyproduceawidevarietyofproducts(Exhibit7.4).
Sincetheproducts withinafamilyhavesimilarproductionrequirements,equipmentsetuptimes,inventories,andlotsizescanbe kepttoaminimum.
Thecellularapproachallowseachproducttobesentthroughthemanufacturingprocess one piece at a time, according to the immediate set of customer orders.
It provides workers the (cid:29)exibility to change a product or customize it in some way in response to speci(cid:28)c customer requirements.
The cells are usually arranged in a U shape.
This enables one worker to view multiple machines simultaneously and puts all machines within easy reaching distance.
Cellular processes minimize cycle times and enable the organization to maintain higher levels of product volumes, variety, and customization.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Exhibit 7.4: Cellular Layouts 7.4.6 Technology decisions There are many bene(cid:28)ts that technology can bring to an operations environment.
Automated machinery, programmable equipment, and management information systems can provide speed, low unit processing costs,laborcostsavings,increasedaccuracyandconsistency,andsophisticatedtrackinganddecisionsupport systems to increase operations e(cid:30)ciency and e(cid:27)ectiveness for both manufacturing and service environments.
The main drawback in many technology decisions is the high (cid:28)xed cost of purchasing and implementing the new systems.
If mistakes are made in technology purchases, it can severely impact the fortunes of the company.
Managers are often biased in favor of adopting leading edge technology, especially if they see their competitors adopting it.
Financial justi(cid:28)cations for purchasing new technology are often overly optimistic in estimations of payback periods, the costs of implementation, and the actual gains in overall productivity the (cid:28)rm will enjoy.
The challenge for managers in technology is selecting the right technology for the right application.
For example, if a manufacturing company believes that automation will increase the (cid:28)rm’s (cid:29)exibility to adapt to a changing competitive environment, questions should be asked, such as: • What type of (cid:29)exibility does the company need to thrive?
• Does it need to quickly switch production across a wide variety of products (product mix (cid:29)exibility)?
• Doesitneedtoquicklyproducenewproductsforarapidlychangingmarketplace(productdevelopment (cid:29)exibility)?
• Does it need to be able to quickly ramp up production during times of high demand, and quickly scale down production when cyclical or seasonal demand hits downturns (volume (cid:29)exibility)?
Deere & Co manufactures machinery for the highly cyclical agricultural and construction industries.
One of the reasons for Deere’s success over the many decades is its ability to keep its technology expenditures under control so it can weather the inevitable declines in demand for its products.
Deere managers use a mixoflowtechnology/laborintensiveproductionmethodsandautomated/programmabletechnologiesinits manufacturing plants.
Careful technology decision making is a major reason why Deere & Co continues to thrive in spite of its highly volatile markets.
7.4.7 Location decisions There are many factors that can determine where an organization will locate its facilities.
For any given situation, some factors become more important than others in how facility location a(cid:27)ects an organization’s e(cid:30)ciency and e(cid:27)ectiveness.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>139 • Proximity to sources of supply: Firms that process bulk raw materials usually locate close to the source of supply to reduce transportation costs.
Paper mills locate close to forests, canneries are built close to farming areas, and (cid:28)sh processing plants are located close to the harbors where the (cid:28)shing vessels dock.
• Proximity to customers: There are several reasons why an organization would locate close to end customers.
Service(cid:28)rmsneedtobeclosetocustomerstobeconvenient,asisthecaseforgrocerystores, gas stations, fast food restaurants, and hospitals.
Transportation costs can also require proximity to customers, as in the case of concrete manufacturing.
Perishable products often require that they be produced close to the (cid:28)nal market, as is the case for bakeries and fresh (cid:29)owers.
• Community factors: Communities may o(cid:27)er a number of incentives to entice companies, including waiving or reducing taxes, and providing access roads, water and sewer connections, and utilities.
Community attitudes can also play a role in an organization’s location decision.
Some communities may actively discourage companies that might bring more pollution, noise, and tra(cid:30)c to the area.
Some communities may not want a prison to be located in their community.
Other communities may welcome such (cid:28)rms because of the jobs, tax revenues, and economic diversity they promise.
• Labor factors: Research shows that the majority of location decisions are largely based on labor factors, since labor is a critical variable for many (cid:28)rms.
Labor factors include the prevailing wage rate in a community for similar jobs, the supply of quali(cid:28)ed workers, and the average education level of the local population (percentage of high school graduates, etc.).
Other labor factors can include the degree of union organizing and the general work ethic of a community, as well as other measures of absenteeismandworkerlongevityinajobcanplaystrongroleswhena(cid:28)rmmakesalocationdecision.
• Other factors: Many other factors can play a role in the location decision, including quality of life (crime rates, good schools, climate, and recreation options), access to major transportation arteries, constructioncosts,proximityofthecompetition,andopportunitiesforfutureexpansion.
Asmentioned earlier, the importance of any location factor can vary greatly, depending on the circumstances of the decision.
In the 1990s, MCI, a major US telecommunications company, decided to relocate its engineering services division from MCI’s headquarters in Washington DC to Colorado Springs, Colorado to reduce labor and facilitycosts.
Thedecisionwaslargelyunsuccessfulduetothehighcostsofemployeerelocationandthefact that much of the ethnically diverse engineering workforce did not want to live in Colorado Springs.
Unlike Washington DC, Colorado Springs did not have cultural diversity to match with its diverse and highly educated workforce, it lacked employment options for spouses, and the work ethic was more relaxed due to the beautiful natural setting that provided unlimited options for outdoor recreation.
In short, if MCI had putmoree(cid:27)ortintoresearchinghowwelltheColoradoSpringslocationmatcheditsstrategicrequirements,it probablycouldhavesaveditselfmillionsofdollarsandagreatdealofinternaldisruptiontotheorganization.

They include Total Quality Management, Supply Chain Management, and Just-In-Time/Lean Operations.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 7.6 Special topic: Total Quality Management6 Total Quality Management (TQM) is the organization-wide management of quality that includes facilities, equipment, labor, suppliers, customers, policies, and procedures.
TQM promotes the view that quality improvement never ends, quality provides a strategic advantage to the organization, and zero defects is the quality goal that will minimize total quality costs.
While this special topic on TQM is not a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of TQM, several key concepts will be discussed.
7.6.1 Quality costs An important basis for justifying TQM practice is understanding its impact on total quality costs.
TQM is rootedinthebeliefthatpreventingdefectsischeaperthandealingwiththecostsofqualityfailures.
Inother words,totalqualitycostsareminimizedwhenmanagersstrivetoreachzerodefectsintheorganization.
The four major types of quality costs are prevention, appraisal, internal failure, and external failure.
Prevention costs are the costs created from the e(cid:27)ort to reduce poor quality.
Examples are designing the products so that they will be durable, training employees so they do a good job, certifying suppliers to ensure that suppliers provide quality in products and services, conducting preventive maintenance on equipment, and documenting quality procedures and improvements.
In a traditional organization that does not practice TQM, prevention costs typically comprise the smallest percentage of total quality costs.
A good example of good product design occurs in all Honda products.
Honda produces a wide variety of items including automobiles, ATVs, engines, generators, motorcycles, outboard motors, snow blowers, lawn andgardenequipment, andevenmoreitems.
Tosaytheleast,Hondaengineslastalongtime.
Forexample, Honda Accords typically run for well over 200,000 miles.
Employee training is also a very important prevention cost.
For instance, employees in a vegetable/fruit packaging warehouse need to know what a bad vegetable/fruit looks like, since customers will not want to (cid:28)nd spoiled produce in the store.
Lifeguards at a swimming pool must know proper procedures for keeping swimmers safe.
In many circumstances in both manufacturing and service businesses, the training of employees can make an enormous di(cid:27)erence in preventing defects.
Supplier selection and certi(cid:28)cation are critical prevention activities.
A product or service is only as good as the suppliers who partner with an organization to provide the raw materials, parts and components, and supportingservicesthatmakeupthe(cid:28)nalproductsandservicesthattheendcustomersreceive.
Forexample, a home furnishings store might use an outside subcontractor to install carpeting, but if the subcontractor fails to show up on time, tracks mud into the customer’s home, or behaves in a rude manner, the store’s reputation will su(cid:27)er.
Similarly, a car manufacturer who purchases defective tires from a supplier risks incurring high costs of recalls and lawsuits when the defects are discovered.

Documentingqualityisanecessarypreventioncostbecauseithelpstheorganizationtrackqualityperfor- mance, identify quality problems, collect data, and specify procedures that contribute to the pursuit of zero defects.
Documentationisimportanttocommunicatinggoodqualitypracticetoallemployeesandsuppliers.
Appraisal costs are a second major type of quality cost.
Appraisal costs include the inspection and testing of raw materials, work-in-process, and (cid:28)nished goods.
In addition, quality audits, sampling, and statistical process control also fall under the umbrella of appraisal costs.
Inspection and testing of raw materials is very important, since substandard raw materials lead to sub- standard products.
Raw materials used for a bridge determine the strength of the bridge.
For example, soft steel will erode away faster than hardened steel.
Moreover, the concrete bridge decking needs to be solid, as concrete with air pockets will erode and crumble faster creating an unsafe bridge.
Finished goods and work-in-process inventory also need inspecting and testing.
For example, worker error is quite common in the home construction industry, and this is why inspections occur frequently on 6Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35447/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>141 newly constructed homes during and after the construction process is complete.
Building inspectors ensure that the house has the proper framing, electrical, plumbing, heating, and so forth.
Quality audits and sampling are also important appraisal costs.
Quality audits are checks of quality procedures to ensure that employees and suppliers are following proper quality practices.
With sampling, a company can ensure with con(cid:28)dence that a batch of products is (cid:28)t for use.
For example, a wooden baseball bat manufacturer may test 10 out of every 100 bats to check that they meet strength standards.
One weak bat can signal that quality problems are present.
Statistical process control (SPC) is the (cid:28)nal type of appraisal cost.
SPC tracks on-going processes in manufacturing or service environments to make sure that they are producing the desired performance.
For example, a restaurant might statistically track customer survey results to make sure that customer satisfaction is maintained over time.
In manufacturing windshields for automobiles, SPC might be used to track the number of microscopic air bubbles in the glass to make sure the process is performing to standard.
Internal failure costs are a third category of quality costs.
This cost occurs when quality defects are discovered before they reach the customer.
Examples of internal failure costs include scrapping a product, reworking the product, and lost productivity due to machine breakdowns or labor errors.
Internal failure costs are typically more expensive than both prevention and appraisal costs because a great deal of material and labor often has been invested prior to the discovery of the defect.
If a book publisher prints 10,000 books, then discovers that one of the chapters is missing from every copy, the cost of reworking or scrapping the books represents a major loss to the company.
It would have been much cheaper to have procedures in place to prevent such a mistake from happening in the (cid:28)rst place.
Inthecaseof internalfailurecostduetomachine failures, FedEx, andother courier servicescannotkeep up with demand when a conveyor belt breaks down in the package distribution center.
Major delays and costs occur when such incidents occur.
Other examples include a road construction company having a road grader break down, a tool and die shop having a CNC machine break down, and a farmer having a combine break down during harvest time.
External failure costs are the fourth major cost of quality.
External failure costs when the defect is discoveredafterithasreachedthecustomer.
Thisisthemostexpensivecategoryofqualitycosts.
Examples includeproductreturns,repairs,warrantyclaims,lostreputation,andlostbusiness.
Onespectacularexample ofexternalfailurecostwaswhentheHubbelltelescopewaslaunchedintospacewithmirrorsthatwereground improperly.
When the telescope was turned on, instead of a magni(cid:28)cent view of stars, planets, and galaxies, the scientists could see only blurred images.
The price of correcting the problem was over USD 1 billion.
External failure costs also occur when the wrong meal is delivered to a restaurant customer, when a computerbreaksdownshortlyafteritwaspurchased,whenthewrongkidneyisremovedfromapatient,and when a poorly designed automobile causes the death of drivers and passengers.
Because of the enormous costs of internal and external failures, all companies should strive for zero defects.
Successful TQM practice dictatesthatpursuingzerodefectswillresultintheminimizationoftotalqualitycostsbyspendingmoreon prevention and appraisal activities in order to reduce the much higher costs of internal and external failure.
7.6.2 TQM’s seven basic elements Successful practice of Total Quality Management involves both technical and people aspects that cover the entire organization and extend to relationships with suppliers and customers.
Seven basic elements capture the essence of the TQM philosophy: customer focus, continuous improvement, employee empowerment, quality tools, product design, process management, and supplier quality.
• Customer focus: Decisions of how to organize resources to best serve customers starts with a clear understanding of customer needs and the measurement of customer satisfaction.
For example, the Red Cross surveys its blood donors to determine how it can make the blood donation experience more pleasant and convenient.
It collects information on the place, date and time donors came in, and asks donors questions of whether the donation time was convenient, whether they were treated with respect and gratitude, how long they had to wait to donate, and whether parking was adequate.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>142 CHAPTER 7.
OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT By understanding donors’ needs and experiences, Red Cross managers can determine strengths and weaknesses of the donation service process and make adjustments if necessary.
• Continuous improvement: An organizational culture that promotes continuous learning and prob- lem solving is essential in the pursuit of zero defects.
The Toyota Production System (TPS) is a universal continuous improvement system that has been e(cid:27)ectively applied to many di(cid:27)erent types of organizations, including the health care industry.
Essential elements of the TPS culture include studying process (cid:29)ow, collecting data, driving out wasteful non-value-added activities, and making everyone responsible for quality improvement.
In the case of health care, the TPS approach enabled one hospital to analyze the causes of patient infections from catheters and pneumonia in patients on ventilators.
With simple changes in procedures that prevented patients from getting these secondary illnesses, the hospital was able to save USD 40,000 per patient in these cases.
• Employee involvement: Employees in a TQM environment have very di(cid:27)erent roles and respon- sibilities than in a traditional organization.
They are given responsibility, training, and authority to measureandcontrolthequalityoftheworktheyproduce,theyworktogetherinteamstoaddressqual- ityissues,theyarecross-trainedtobeabletoperformmultipletasksandhaveagreaterunderstanding of the total production process, and they have a more intimate understanding of the operation and maintenance of their equipment.
Employees are essential to the building of a continuous improvement organization.
• Quality tools: Discussion of the details of quality tools extends beyond the scope of this chapter, but there are seven basic quality tools that are used by front-line workers and managers in monitoring qualityperformanceandgatheringdataforqualityimprovementactivities.
Thesetoolsinclude: cause- and-e(cid:27)ect((cid:28)shbone)diagrams,(cid:29)owcharts,checklists,controlcharts,scatterdiagrams,Paretoanalysis, and histograms.
The beauty of these tools is that they are easy to understand and apply in on-going quality e(cid:27)orts.
• Product design: Product design is a key activity to avoid costly internal and external failure costs.
Forexample,whenadentalo(cid:30)cedesignstheserviceprocess,itmighthavepatients(cid:28)lloutaformthat covers important information on general health issues, allergies, and medications.
This helps to avoid future complications and problems.
Sta(cid:27), hygienists, and dentists are highly trained to follow proper procedures, the facility is both functional and pleasant, and the equipment and tools are state of the art to ensure that the patient’s desired outcome is achieved.
In a manufacturing setting, products should be designed to maximize product functionality, reliability, and manufacturability.
• Process management: (cid:16)Quality at the Source(cid:17) is an important concept in TQM.
It means that managers and employees should be focused on the detailed activities in a process where good or bad quality is created.
For example, in a Toyota plant in the United States in Georgetown, Kentucky, one oftheworkstationswasresponsibleforinstallingseatbeltsandvisorsineveryvehiclethatcamealong the assembly line.
There were 12 possible combinations of visors and seat belts that would go into any particular vehicle and the worker had to select the right combination and install the items in the vehicle in 55 seconds.
Even the best workers made several errors during a shift on this activity.
After studying the process, the workers came up with an idea to put all the items for a particular vehicle model in a blue plastic tote.
With this change, the worker only had to make one decision per vehicle.
Almost all the errors from the previous system were eliminated with this simple solution.
• Supplier quality: The focus on quality at the source extends to suppliers’ processes as well, since the quality of a (cid:28)nished product is only as good as the quality of its individual parts and components, regardless of whether they come from internal or external sources.
Sharing your quality and engineer- ing expertise with your suppliers, having a formal supplier certi(cid:28)cation program, and including your suppliers in the product design stage are important measures to take to ensure that quality at the source extends to the supplier network.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>143 7.6.3 Quality awards and standards There are several quality awards and standards that are available for organizations to access.
The large majority of organizations that use these programs use them as tools to help improve their quality processes and move toward implementing and successfully practicing TQM.
The Malcolm Baldrige Award is a United States quality award that covers an extensive list of criteria that are evaluated by independent judges if an organization chooses to compete for the award.
In many cases, organizations use the Baldrige criteria as a guide for their internal quality e(cid:27)orts rather than compete directly for the award.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sponsors a certi(cid:28)cation process for organiza- tions that seek to learn and adopt superior methods for quality practice (ISO 9000) and environmentally responsible products and methods of production (ISO 14000).
These certi(cid:28)cations are increasingly used by organizations of all sizes to compete more e(cid:27)ectively in a global marketplace due to the wide acceptance of ISO certi(cid:28)cation as a criterion for supplier selection.
ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 are described on the ISO web 8 page at: http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm .
(cid:16)The ISO 9000 family addresses "quality management".
This means what the organization does to ful(cid:28)ll: the customer’s quality requirements, and applicable regulatory requirements, while aiming to enhance customer satisfaction, and achieve continual improvement of its performance in pursuit of these objectives.

Thismeanswhattheorganization does to: minimize harmful e(cid:27)ects on the environment caused by its activities, and to achieve continual improvement of its environmental performance.
(cid:17) Another popular quality award is the Deming Prize, which is a Japanese quality award for which organi- zations from any country can apply.
The Deming Prize was named after W. Edwards Deming, an American statistician, author, and consultant who helped improve United States production capabilities during World War II, but is best known for his work in post-war Japan.
He is widely credited with assisting the Japanese in rebuilding their nation’s production infrastructure in the areas of product design, product quality, and testing through the application of statistical methods.
Florida Power and Electric was the (cid:28)rst American company to win the Deming Prize, due to its meticulous use of formal approaches to quality improvement, data-based decision making, quality improvement teams, and the careful documentation of processes and procedures.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 7.7 Special topic: supply chain management10 Supply chain management is the business function that coordinates and manages all the activities of the supply chain, including suppliers of raw materials, components and services, transportation providers, in- ternal departments, and information systems.
Exhibit 7.5 illustrates a supply chain for providing packaged milk to consumers.
Exhibit 7.5: Illustration of a supply chain In the manufacturing sector, supply chain management addresses the movement of goods through the supply chain from the supplier to the manufacturer, to wholesalers or warehouse distribution centers, to retailers and (cid:28)nally to the consumer.
For example, Apple, Inc uses sophisticated information systems to accept orders for custom-built computers from individual customers all over the world.
Apple assembles the computers in Shanghai, China, to the customers’ speci(cid:28)cations.
It uses parts and components that are provided by outside suppliers who can deliver the right parts in the right quantity in a timely way to satisfy the immediate production schedule.
The completed computers are (cid:29)own from Shanghai by FedEx, reaching theend-usercustomersonlyafewdaysaftertheorderswereplaced.
Apple’ssupplychainallowsittoprovide fast delivery of high-quality custom computers at competitive prices.
Supply chain concepts also apply to the service sector, where service (cid:28)rms must coordinate equipment, materials, and human resources to provide services to their customers in a timely manner.
For example, a retail store that sells electronic products may contract with an outside business to provide installation services to its customers.
In many cases, the customer does not even know the installation was done by an outside contractor.
Information and communication technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), barcode technology, customer relationship management (CRM) databases, and the Internet allow service businesses to coordinate external and internal service suppliers to e(cid:30)ciently and e(cid:27)ectively respond to customer demand.
Thesupplychainisnotjustaonewayprocessthatrunsfromrawmaterialstotheendcustomer.
Although goodstendto(cid:29)owthisway,importantdatasuchasforecasts,inventorystatus,shippingschedules,andsales data are examples of information that is constantly being conveyed to di(cid:27)erent links in the supply chain.
Money also tends to (cid:29)ow (cid:16)upstream(cid:17) in the supply chain so goods and service providers can be paid.

The bullwhip e(cid:27)ect occurs when inaccurate or distorted information is passed on through the links in the supply chain.
As the bad information gets passed from one party to the next, the distortions worsen and cause poor ordering decisionsbyupstreampartiesinthesupplychainthathavelittleapparentlinktothe(cid:28)nalend-itemproduct demand.
As information gets farther from the end customer, the worse the quality of information gets as the supply chain members base their guesses on the bad guesses of their partners.
The results are wasteful inventory investments, poor customer service, ine(cid:30)cient distribution, misused manufacturing capacity, and lost revenues for all parties in the supply chain.
Forexample,OpenRangeJeans(a(cid:28)ctitiouscompany)aresoldinapopularretailstorechain.
Theretail chain decides to promote Open Range Jeans and reduce the price to boost customer tra(cid:30)c in its stores, but the chain does not tell the Open Range manufacturer of this promotion plan.
The manufacturer sees an increase in retail orders, forecasts a long-term growth in demand for its jeans, and places orders with its suppliers for more fabric, zippers, and dye.
Suppliersoffabric,zippersanddyeseetheincreaseinordersfromthejeansmanufacturerandboosttheir orders for raw cotton, chemicals, etc.
Meanwhile, the retail chain has ended its Open Range promotion, and sales of the jeans plummet below normal levels because customers have stocked up to take advantage of the promotion prices.
Just as end-customer demand falls, new jeans are being manufactured, and raw materials arebeingsenttothejeansfactory.
Whenthefallingend-customerdemandis(cid:28)nallyrealized, manufacturers rush to slash production, cancel orders, and discount inventories.
Not wanting to get burned twice, manufacturers wait until (cid:28)nished goods jean inventories are drawn downtominimallevels.
Whenseasonaldemandincreasesjeanspurchases,theretailstoresordermoreOpen Range jeans, but the manufacturers cannot respond quickly enough.
A stockout occurs at the retail store leveljustascustomersarepurchasingjeansduringtheback-to-schoolsalesseason.
Retailcustomersrespond to the stockout by purchasing the jeans of a major competitor, causing long-term damage to Open Range’s market share.
7.7.1.1 Causes of the bullwhip e(cid:27)ect The bullwhip e(cid:27)ect is caused by demand forecast updating, order batching, price (cid:29)uctuation, and rationing and gaming.
• Demand forecast updating is done individually by all members of a supply chain.
Each member updates its own demand forecast based on orders received from its (cid:16)downstream(cid:17) customer.
The more members in the chain, the less these forecast updates re(cid:29)ect actual end-customer demand.
• Order batching occurs when each member takes order quantities it receives from its downstream customer and rounds up or down to suit production constraints such as equipment setup times or truckload quantities.
The more members who conduct such rounding of order quantities, the more distortion occurs of the original quantities that were demanded.
• Price (cid:29)uctuations due to in(cid:29)ationary factors, quantity discounts, or sales tend to encourage cus- tomers to buy larger quantities than they require.
This behavior tends to add variability to quantities ordered and uncertainty to forecasts.
• Rationing and gaming is when a seller attempts to limit order quantities by delivering only a percentage of the order placed by the buyer.
The buyer, knowing that the seller is delivering only a fraction of the order placed, attempts to (cid:16)game(cid:17) the system by making an upward adjustment to the order quantity.
Rationing and gaming create distortions in the ordering information that is being received by the supply chain.
7.7.1.2 Counteracting the bullwhip e(cid:27)ect To improve the responsiveness, accuracy, and e(cid:30)ciency of the supply chain, a number of actions must be taken to combat the bullwhip e(cid:27)ect: AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>146 CHAPTER 7.
OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT • Makereal-timeend-itemdemandinformationavailabletoallmembersofthesupplychain.
Information technologies such as electronic data interchange (EDI), bar codes, and scanning equipment can assist in providing all supply chain members with accurate and current demand information.
• Eliminate order batching by driving down the costs of placing orders, by reducing setup costs to make an ordered item, and by locating supply chain members closer to one another to ease transportation restrictions.
• Stabilizepricesbyreplacingsalesanddiscountswithconsistent(cid:16)every-daylowprices(cid:17) attheconsumer stage and uniform wholesale pricing at upstream stages.
Such actions remove price as a variable in determining order quantities.
• Discourage gaming in rationing situations by using past sales records to determine the quantities that will be delivered to customers.
7.7.2 Other factors a(cid:27)ecting supply chain management In addition to managing the bullwhip e(cid:27)ect, supply chain managers must also contend with a variety of factors that pose on-going challenges: • Increased demands from customers for better performance on cost, quality, delivery, and (cid:29)exibility.
Customers are better informed and have a broader array of options for how they conduct business.
This puts added pressure on supply chain managers to continually improve performance.
• Globalization imposes challenges such as greater geographic dispersion among supply chain members.
Greater distances create longer lead times and higher transportation costs.
Cultural di(cid:27)erences, time zones,andexchangeratesmakecommunicationanddecision-makingmoredi(cid:30)cult.
BoeingandAirbus have discovered the downside of sourcing from global suppliers.
Much smaller suppliers of kitchen galleys, lavatories, and passenger seats have been unable to ful(cid:28)ll orders from Boeing and Airbus, leaving the latter unable to deliver planes to its airline customers.
• Governmentregulations,tari(cid:27)s,andenvironmentalrulesprovidechallengesaswell.
Forexample,many countries require that products have a minimum percentage of local content.
Being environmentally responsible by minimizing waste, properly disposing of dangerous chemicals, and using recyclable materials is rapidly becoming a requirement for doing business.
7.7.3 Supplier selection Choosing suppliers is one of the most important decisions made by a company.
The e(cid:30)ciency and value a supplier provides to an organization is re(cid:29)ected in the end product the organization produces.
The supplier mustnotonlyprovidegoodsandservicesthatareconsistentwiththecompany’smission,itmustalsoprovide goodvalue.

Whether to single-source or multiple-source often depends on the supply chain structure of the company and the character of the goods or services it produces.

When both parties bene(cid:28)t from a partnership, it is called a (cid:16)win-win situation(cid:17).
It is easy to see how choosing suppliers is one of the most important decisions a company makes.
There are advantages and disadvantages to using one supplier.
One advantage is that the supplier might own patents or processes and be the only source for the product.
With one supplier, pricing discounts may be granted because purchases over the long-term are large and unit production costs for the supplier are lower.
The supplier may be more responsive if you are the only purchaser of an item, resulting in better supplierrelations.
Just-in-timeorderingiseasiertoimplement, anddeliveriesmaybescheduledmoreeasily.
Finally, using a single supplier is necessary to form a partnership.
One disadvantage is that if that one AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>147 supplier experiences a disaster at its warehouse like a (cid:28)re or a tornado, or its workers go on strike, there is no other ready source for the product.
Another possible disadvantage is that a single supplier may not be able to supply a very large quantity if it is suddenly needed.
Also, sometimes the government requires the use of multiple suppliers for government projects.
There are also advantages and disadvantages to using multiple suppliers.
Suppliers might provide better products and services over time if they know they are competing with other suppliers.
Also, if a disaster happens at one supplier’s warehouse, other suppliers can make up the loss.
If a company uses multiple suppliers, there is more (cid:29)exibility of volume to match demand (cid:29)uctuations.
One disadvantage with multiple suppliers is that it is more di(cid:30)cult to forge long-term partnerships.
Information sharing becomes riskier, lower volumes for each supplier provide fewer opportunities for cost savings, and suppliers tend to be less responsive to emergency situations.
Partnershipsarelong-termrelationshipsbetweenasupplierandacompanythatinvolvetrustandsharing and result in bene(cid:28)ts for both parties.
A good example of a partnership is the partnering between a Deere & Co. farm equipment factory and its suppliers.

One supplier was chosen for each of the three part families.
All three of the suppliers that were chosen were located less than two hours of driving time from the Deere plant.
For many years, all three suppliers have continued to provide outstanding quality, delivery, and cost performance to Deere.
The suppliers bene(cid:28)ted by gaining a long-term customer with a large amount of pro(cid:28)table business.
Deere realized a 50 per cent drop in production costs on the three part families and was able to better focus on its mission of manufacturing farm equipment.
7.7.4 Conclusion Supply chain management concerns the development of communication and information systems to link suppliers together in cooperative partnerships that promote advantage for all participants.
Bene(cid:28)ts include faster response times, reduced inventory costs, increased accuracy, and improved quality.
7.8 Special topic: just-in-time and lean systems11 Just-in-time (JIT) is a management philosophy that originated in the 1970s.
Taiichi Ohno is credited with developing JIT and perfected it for Toyota’s manufacturing plants in Japan.
The main goal of JIT is to eliminate anything that does not add value from the customer’s perspective.
Non-value-added activities are referred to as (cid:16)waste(cid:17) in JIT.
Examples of waste include: • overproduction beyond what is needed to satisfy immediate demand • waiting time (work-in-process, customer waiting) • unnecessary transportation (material handling, customer travel through a facility, etc.)
• processing waste (yield rates, start-up costs) • inventory storage waste (space, deterioration, obsolescence, etc.)
• unnecessary motion and activity (waste in work techniques, etc.)
• waste from product and service defects (rework, scrap, warranty, etc.)
There are three essential elements that contribute to the successful practice of JIT: • JIT manufacturing principles • Total Quality Management (TQM) • employee empowerment 11Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35448/1.4/>.

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 7.8.1 JIT manufacturing principles In a manufacturing setting, there are six major ways to pursue JIT goals: inventory reduction to expose waste, use of a (cid:16)demand-pull(cid:17) production system, quick setups to reduce lot sizes, uniform plant loading, (cid:29)exible resources, and cellular (cid:29)ow layouts.
7.8.1.1 Inventory reduction to expose waste Inventory covers up a lot of wasteful practices (poor equipment, weak vendors, bad quality, long setup times, etc.).
By gradually lowering inventory, the weaknesses of the production system can be revealed and addressed one by one.
Machines can be replaced or better maintained, vendors quality and delivery can be improved, machine setup procedures can be streamlined, quality practices can be implemented, and labor andequipmentcanbelaidoutmoree(cid:30)ciently.
Theseimprovementspermittheorganizationtooperatewith less inventory, less costs, and faster response times in meeting customer needs.
7.8.1.2 Demand-pull production system The traditional approach to manufacturing management promotes a strong focus on machine and labor utilization.
Theviewwasthatifmanagersmakesurethatworkersandmachinesarealwaysbusy,thensurely the factory will be productive and e(cid:30)cient.
This approach is called the (cid:16)push(cid:17) system of manufacturing, where raw material and work-in-process is continuously pushed through the factory in the pursuit of high utilization.
The problem with this approach is that it usually produces high levels of inventories, long lead times, overtime costs, high levels of potential rework, and workers who are competing with one another rather than working cooperatively.
In contrast to the push system, JIT espouses a (cid:16)demand-pull(cid:17) system that operates on the rule that work should (cid:29)ow to a work center only if that work center needs more work.
If a work center is already occupied with work activity, the upstream work center should stop production until the downstream work center communicates a need for more material.
The emphasis on maintaining high utilization is removed in a JIT environment.
The focus of a JIT environment is on addressing the challenges that a(cid:27)ect the overall e(cid:27)ectiveness of the factory (setup time reduction, quality improvement, enhanced production techniques, waste elimination, etc.)
in meeting its strategic goals, rather than allowing excess inventory to cover up ine(cid:30)ciencies that reduce the factory’s competitiveness.
7.8.1.3 Quick setups to reduce lot sizes The longer it takes, and the more expensive it is to setup equipment and labor to produce an item, the greater the quantity of items that have to be produced in a given production run.
Traditional production management philosophy promoted the notion that long production runs of the same item were the key to driving down unit costs.
The problem was that large production runs created large quantities of WIP and (cid:28)nishedgoodsinventorythatfarexceededthedemand.
Theseitemswouldconsequentlycausehighlevelsof inventory costs, long lead times, high potential rework, low (cid:29)exibility in responding to customer needs, etc.
Driving down setup costs and setup times are key to dramatically improving factory competitiveness in a JIT environment.
In the 1980s, the 3M company converted a factory that made a few adhesive products in long production runs into a factory that made over 500 adhesive products in small production runs.
To keep unit production costs under control, 3M studied the setups on its coating machines.
Since the cost of chemical waste disposal was a major part of the cost of changing over a coating machine to make another product, 3M shortened the length of hoses that needed purging and redesigned the shape of the adhesive solutionholdingpanonthecoatingmachinetobeshallower.
3Malsousedquick-connectdevices,disposable (cid:28)lters, and work teams to speed up setups.
The result was that 3M could maintain low unit costs on its coating machines while producing small lots of hundreds of products to meet market demand quickly.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>149 7.8.1.4 Uniform plant loading The successful practice of JIT means having the right quantities of the right products in the right place at the right time.
Driving down setup times enables the company to produce the product mix and quantities that are demanded in the present time period.
7.8.1.5 Flexible resources The enemy of JIT is uncertainty.
A JIT environment thrives on predictability in customer demand, pro- duction processes, suppliers, and workers.
Of course, uncertainty cannot be completely eliminated in most organizational environments.
The defense against uncertainty that cannot be driven out is to implement (cid:29)exible resources that can adapteasilytochangingcircumstances.
General-purpose,moveableequipmentthatcanful(cid:28)llawidevariety ofproductionrequirementsisonewaytoimprove(cid:29)exibility.
Forexample,drillingmachineswithquick-change bits which can be wheeled into position to form new work cells allows the factory to maximize e(cid:30)ciency while producing exactly what is needed to satisfy immediate demand.
Another example is Toyota’s use of paint canisters that attach to paint sprayers.
Any car can be painted any color without having to purge hoses in switching from one color to another.
Multifunctional workers are another way to bring (cid:29)exibility to the work environment.
At Honeywell’s heating and cooling controls plant, workers are trained to operate all the machines on their work line.
The (cid:29)exibility that comes from multifunctional workers changes the nature of how work gets done.
Instead of workers being trained on one machine and working independently of one another, multifunctional workers have a (cid:16)big picture(cid:17) view of the production line, where every worker understands all aspects of the line and how to work together to meet quality and schedule goals regardless of the circumstances.
7.8.1.6 Line/cellular (cid:29)ow layouts Earlier in this chapter, we described the e(cid:30)ciencies that repetitive process layouts provide.
Repetitive process layouts are perfectly suited for driving out non-value-added activities and transitioning to a JIT environment.
Intermittent layouts feature dozens or even hundreds of di(cid:27)erent paths through the facility.
Theyare(cid:28)lledwithcomplexity, uncertainty, andlowvisibility.
Workerstendtohavespecializedskills, work independently of other departments, and have little sense of (cid:16)ownership(cid:17) of the products they work on.
In contrast, cell layouts promote JIT goals by featuring unidirectional product (cid:29)ows, high visibility, and fast throughput times.
Workers with multifunctional skills are assigned to individual cells and have responsibility and control of the products they produce.
Workers in a cell environment tend to have a greater sense of ownership and pride in their work because they have a (cid:16)big picture(cid:17) view of the product as it is converted from raw material to a (cid:28)nished good.
This deeper understanding of the production process increases the opportunities for workers to contribute ideas for process improvements.
7.8.2 Total Quality Management TQM was discussed in detail earlier.
TQM goes hand in hand with the JIT philosophy because quality is a major source of uncertainty and non-value-added activities in an organization with poor quality practices.
TQM promotes continuous improvement, doing it right the (cid:28)rst time, designing quality into products and processes, and establishing an overall focus on prevention as the primary quality activity.
7.8.3 Employee empowerment Front-line employees play a critical role in successful JIT practice.
They work in partnership with man- agement and each other in the continuous pursuit of excellence.
There are several ways in which front-line employees contribute to JIT success: AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>150 CHAPTER 7.
OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT • Employees work together in problem-solving teams to gather data and build consensus on how to improve work processes.
• Employees are responsible for understanding the quality measures of their work and what they need to do to meet the needs of internal and external customers.
• Each employee is empowered to take action to correct problems.
• Employees have cross-functional skill sets that allow them to be assigned to areas which need help, and to help them adopt a broader ((cid:16)big picture(cid:17)) view of the production process.
• Unlikeatraditional(cid:16)push(cid:17) environmentwherelineworkersarerelativelyindependentofoneanotherin their work activities, JIT employees are connected by the (cid:16)demand pull(cid:17) discipline, where work is not produced unless the downstream work center needs it.
Demand-pull promotes the inter-connectedness of workers.
• Front-lineemployeesareresponsibleforthebasicmaintenanceoftheirmachines.
Thishelpsemployees have a better understanding of the condition of their equipment and its ability to meet quality and production requirements.
Management works with employees by being coaches and facilitators rather than authoritative supervisors.
Managers are charged with hiring employees who can work in a proactive team environment, and provide the training and incentives to build a work culture that is focused on continuous improvement.

This trend occurs for two reasons.
First, organizations have come to realize that they cannot be(cid:28)rst-rateineveryphaseoftheirbusiness(e.g.

Instead, they recognize that a better strategy is one in which they focus on core competencies, or the things they do best, and establish relationships with other companies to perform those functions where they do not have outstanding capabilities.

Two common types of external relationships are market exchanges and partnerships, which we will discuss later in this chapter.

Exhibit 8.2: Dimensions of trust • Dependability: Is one party making and ful(cid:28)lling promises to another (Covey, 2006).
Dependability can also be exempli(cid:28)ed via third party con(cid:28)rmations.
For example, a credible source can vouch for a (cid:28)rmwhendependabilityhasbeenproventhroughpastexperiences.
Productdemonstrationsandplant tours are other ways companies can illustrate the capability to be dependable.
• Competence: Is when an organization appears knowledgeable.
Demonstrating competence can be the fastest way to increase trust (Covey, 2006).
A thorough understanding of suppliers, customers, products, competitors, and the industry demonstrates competence.
If a manager understands the relationships they develop, the organization will be perceived as competent.

One way to combat this is to create a culture that values and encourages honesty.
Studies have, in fact, shown that telling the truth strengthens team-building e(cid:27)orts and increases morale and productivity (Smith, 2007).
• Likeability: Is (cid:28)nding a common, friendly ground between the partners.
The relationships you select should be ones where you would like to increase trust, and where, by improving trust, you would get far better results professionally (Covey, 2006).
This is likely the least important of the (cid:28)ve dimensions of trust; however it is still noteworthy in the formation of an external relationship.

SECURING AND MANAGING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS 8.3 Marketing exchanges and partnerships4 In2005,BartonAWeitz,StephenBCastleberry,andJohnFTannerpublishedtheirbook(cid:16)Selling: Building Relationships(cid:17) inwhichtheydiscussmanyoftheaspectsofmodernbusinessrelationships, includingmarket exchanges and partnerships.
According to their book, a market exchange is de(cid:28)ned as a relationship where each party is only concerned with their own welfare.
A partnership, conversely, is based on creating a mutuallybene(cid:28)ciala(cid:30)liationforbothoftheorganizations.
Marketexchangesandpartnershipsbothgenerate commerciallyorientedconnections,whichclassi(cid:28)esthetworelationshipsasexternal(Weitz,Castleberry,and Tanner, 2005).Market exchange: A market exchange is a type of relationship between a buyer and seller in which each party is only concerned about that particular party’s bene(cid:28)t (Weitz, Castleberry, and Tanner, 2005).
Exhibit 8.3: Market exchange Asolo exchangeisatransactionthatoccursbetweenthebuyerandsellerwhereeachpursues’theirown individual self-interest (Weitz, Castleberry, and Tanner, 2005).
Suppose you are traveling to visit relatives in a nearby town on a warm and sunny Saturday morning.
As you pass a small store that is having a sale you see a wooden bench, much like one your grandmother had, with a USD 25 selling price.
At this point you might pay the USD 25 for the bench, haggle for a lower price, or walk away from the transaction.
You decide to make the seller an o(cid:27)er of USD 10 for the bench.
After minimal negotiations the bargain price of USD 15 is agreed upon.
This transaction is an example of a solo exchange.
The two parties are not interested in or concerned about the well-being of the other party.
Neither you, nor the seller, expect to engage in future transactions, and both parties are successful in pursuing their individual goals.
The consumer receives the bench for the lowest possible price, while the seller charges the highest acceptable price.
A solo exchange should not be considered an ethical decision, merely an uncomplicated, one-time choice.
8.3.1 Two basic relationship types The two basic relationship types of market exchange and partnerships are divided further based on eight factors shown in column 1 of Table 8.1: Types of relationships.
Varying values of these factors represent situations where the organizations reach greater levels of integration and provide greater returns to both sides of the relationship.

This type of relationship portrays the buyer purchasing a product out of routine or pattern.
In a functional relationship, previous purchases will often in(cid:29)uence later purchases.
Typically, the buyer will continue to purchase from their selected seller as long as the price and the product stay relatively consistent to the original transaction.
Buyers often illustrate this loyalty for several reasons.
One reason a buyer remains loyal is simply convenience.
It is easier for the buyer to avoid the arduous task of searching and negotiating for a product every time a recurring purchase needs to be made, especially when they are likely to come to the same conclusion and buy again from the previous supplier.
For example: A buyer for a school is in charge of purchasing all items that will be necessary for the cafeteria to function.
Assume the school in question is a small elementary school with only about one hundred students.
The buyer must purchase snacks, candy, meat, and drinks, just to name a few.
This particularbuyerusesawholesalertopurchaseallnecessaryitems.
Thiswholesalerhasnodesiretoestablish a partnership with the school; it merely wishes to sell as many items as possible.
Similarly, the success of this relationship will not make or break the school’s success as an educational institution.
This a(cid:30)liation is established out of convenience.
However, if the vendor begins to have poor service or in(cid:29)ated prices, the purchaser will simply choose a comparable wholesaler with little anxiety.
With a functional relationship, both parties are interested in their own pro(cid:28)ts, therefore, price is usually the most important factor in the decision making process.
The relationship established between the buyer andsellerisnotpermanent.
Buyerswilloftenchangesupplierstotryandgetthebestpossibledeal;however, when deciding on a supplier other factors are often weighed into the equation such as quality, reliability, trust, and commitment.
8.3.2 Partnerships Apartnershipistwopartiesconcernedaboutthewelfareofeachotherindevelopingawin-winrelationship (Mohr, 1994).
There are two types of partnerships: a relational and strategic partnership.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>156 CHAPTER 8.
SECURING AND MANAGING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS 8.3.2.1 Relational partnership A relational partnership is a partnership that develops on the premise of a close, personal relationship built on trust (Mohr, 1994).
With this type of partnership there is an open line of communication, and the parties work together in order to overcome any potential problems.
Both sides of the partnership are trying to make money, but the more important factor is developing a long-term, working relationship that will continue to generate money over time.
When relational partnerships are successful, it is often not necessary to have more than minimal negotiations about price.
In addition, minor details will not be allowed to derail or end the relationships because the goal is to establish an ongoing mutually bene(cid:28)cial exchange.
Relational partnerships may develop because of personal ties, but more often they occur due to profes- sional necessity.
For example, every year large US businesses recruit new employees using booths at career fairs across the country.
Such a career fair program is not signi(cid:28)cant enough for the company to enter into a strategic partnership with an employment service to perform hiring at career fairs, but (cid:28)nding employees withthenecessaryskillsisstillveryimportant.
Regionalmanagerswilllikelyberesponsibleforthisjoband they may form a relational partnership with the organizations that host the job fairs in their area to ensure that when the job fairs are planned the representative company will be included.
A relational partnership is more similar to a friendship than to a market exchange.
Rather than showing concern only for their own self interests, partners will o(cid:27)er their time and resources to continue the relationship, because of the expected future bene(cid:28)ts of continuing interactions.
James Cash Penney, the founder of the US department store chain JCPenney, believed that (cid:16)all great businesses are built on friendship(cid:17).
If this ideal is applied, a strong foundation can be formed through relational partnerships.
8.3.2.2 Strategic partnership A strategic partnership is a long-term business relationship in which the partner organizations make signi(cid:28)cant investments to improve the pro(cid:28)tability of both parties (Mohr, 1994).
Strategic partnerships are created to uncover and exploit joint opportunities while minimizing joint weaknesses.
Both parties will contribute (cid:28)nancially, and consequently take signi(cid:28)cant risks in order to provide the partnership with a strategic advantage.
This type of partnership is founded on the basis that both members are dependent on each other.
The partners will have the same goals, as well as agree on the best course of action to achieve thosegoals.
Inordertoachievethetargetobjective,partnershipsmustbebasedonanopen-doorpolicy;the partnership cannot be successful if information is kept con(cid:28)dential or there is a lack of willingness to accept risk equally.
An example of a strategic partnership was evident in 2007 when Time Warner’s AOL strengthened their strategic partnership with Google.
Google invested one billion dollars for a (cid:28)ve per cent stake in AOL.
The agreement created a global online advertising partnership, which has made more of AOL’s industry leading content available to Google users.
These strategic partnerships tend to be very successful because products and services are created that are not o(cid:27)ered by competitors.
Beforeenteringintoanyparticulartypeofpartnership,eachcompanyshouldconsiderallofthepotential bene(cid:28)ts and consequences.
The next section of this chapter will help weigh the various costs and bene(cid:28)ts related to choosing a relationship.
8.4 Choosing the right relationship5 Managers are responsible for establishing the type of relationship that is appropriate for each situation.
Every situation should be considered inherently di(cid:27)erent.
The dynamics of every relationship are unique and managers must customize their agreements to the situation.
Therefore, before deciding what type of relationship to develop several factors need to be considered (Weitz, Castleberry, and Tanner, 2005).
These factorsincludemarketissues(e.g.
maturity,size,andbarriers),thepotentialreturnsoftherelationship,and 5Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35464/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>157 thecapabilitiesprovidedbythepartners(e.g.
experiencewithtechnologyoraccesstoinnovations).
Inaddi- tion, managers must assess the likelihood of success and other risks.
These items include both quantitative and qualitative measures that require a manager’s complete attention when designing relationships.
In the previous example, the strategic partnership formed between Time Warner’s AOL and Google was justi(cid:28)ed,becausethecompanyexpectsareturngreatenoughtojustifytheinvestment.
TimeWarner’sAOL wasasuitablepartnerforGooglebecausethecompanywaslargeenoughtomeetGoogle’sproductdemands.
Conversely, Googlewouldnothaveenteredintoastrategicpartnershipwithasmall, localInternetprovider, because a smaller company would not have enough production capability to meet Google’s demand.
The ideaisthataspartnershipsaresuccessful,thecompanieswillmakemoremoney,i.e.
Googlebelievesbene(cid:28)ts will exceed costs as does Time Warner’s AOL.
Strategic partnerships may be established in order to gain access into a speci(cid:28)c niche or market.
The relationship between Google and AOL may be an example of this type of relationship.
Other partnerships may be formed in an e(cid:27)ort to improve a company’s image.
For example, large oil companies receive a signi(cid:28)cant amount of bad press due to pollution and environmental concerns.
Therefore, it may be in their best interest to partner with companies attempting to develop alternative energy sources, e.g.
solar or wind power, to gain goodwill among consumers.
A partnership may be developed in order to gain access to technological innovation.
A company may (cid:28)nd a relationship with a lead user bene(cid:28)cial.
A lead user is someone who has invented or resolved a customer issue months or even years ahead of competitors in the marketplace.
They provide information and give companies the ability to co-develop novel products, which provide a competitive edge over other market participants.
The key to every successful partnership is communication and, as a result, technology should be used as a means of increasing communication lines.
This may mean using e-mail to interact with customers, or in a much more complex manner, using ongoing data exchange enabled by information technologies designed to increase e(cid:30)ciency.
Wal-Mart is a perfect example of a company using technology in a highly sophisticated manner.
Wal-Mart has created a competitive advantage through managing their inventory system.
Theirinventoryissystematicallyprogrammedtoreplenishcommonitemsastheyreachaminimum level.
This inventory control system has been central to Wal-Mart maintaining low operating costs and providing competitive advantage through product availability.
8.4.1 Foundations of successful relationships Earlier we discussed the importance of trust in a relationship.
Trust, however, is only one building block of severalinvolvedinthecreationofstrategicpartnerships.
Thissectionwillbrie(cid:29)yintroduce(cid:28)vefoundational elements and present how they form long-term, successful relationships.
These elements include: • mutual trust • open and truthful communication • measurable mutual goals • organizational support • commitment to mutual gain AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>158 CHAPTER 8.
SECURING AND MANAGING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS Exhibit 8.4: Elements of successful relationship Mutual trust: Not all building blocks are created equally; the most important of the (cid:28)ve foundational elements is mutual trust.
As previously mentioned, trust is the con(cid:28)dence one party has in another to perform an action as agreed.
In order for a partnership to be successful, trust must be mutual.
As mutual trust grows between partners, parties will not limit themselves to contractual requirements but actually go to great lengths in order to satisfy the other partner, as well as strengthen the relationship.
Openandtruthfulcommunication: Anadditionalelementinbuildinglong-term,successful,relation- shipsisestablishingopenandtruthfulcommunicationlines.
Partiesthatcommunicateopenlyandtruthfully have a better understanding of each others’ visions, missions and goals in the relationship.
One way this can be accomplished is by always creating environments where each party feels comfortable speaking up.
Once both partners gain a strong understanding of what motivates the other partner, dealing with changing business conditions becomes signi(cid:28)cantly easier.
Communications often include the exchange of measures of the e(cid:30)ciency of shared business processes.
Measurable, mutual goals: A key element necessary for relationships to be successful is having both parties share measurable, mutual goals.
Mutual goals allow parties to pool together company resources and strengths.
In order to ensure goals are being met, they must be measurable and quanti(cid:28)able.
Some examples of measurable mutual goals include sales revenue, return on assets, or some performance indicator of customer satisfaction.
Measures may also include production levels, error-rates, or other items that enable integration of the businesses processes of the partners.
Agreeing on the items to be measured and establishingacontinuousmeasurementprogramisnecessarytoprovideoptimalcooperationamongpartners and a substantive contributor to establishing mutual trust.
Organizational support: The support of employees throughout the organization is another key ele- ment in creating successful relationships.
The organization as a whole, from front line members to local and corporate o(cid:30)ces, must support the idea of a partnership.
Structure and culture are the underlying roots that create organizational support.
Although it is expected that employees support management de- cisions, it is necessary for managers to objectively understand and evaluate the structure and culture of the organization when designing partnership relationships.
Proposed partnerships perceived as contrary to the existing structure or cultures are candidates for enhanced scrutiny.
Once a partnership is entered into it is necessary to develop programs such as training and rewards to establish the desired partnership behaviors.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>159 Establishing these types of programs will increase the frequency of and improve the dynamics within the interactions of both partners.
Training teaches behaviors which are needed to achieve partnership goals and rewards encourage the support of the previously taught behaviors.
Commitment to mutual gain: The (cid:28)nal building block in the foundation of successful relationships relates to the level of commitment each partner has in creating mutual gain.
Simply put, partners look out for one another and do not take advantage of each other.
If one party has more resources or more e(cid:30)cient operating procedures than the other, this should not impact the relationship.
If problems arise within the partnership, both parties need to consider the mutual investment each has contributed to the relationship.
Mutual investments, or relationship-speci(cid:28)c assets, are the tangible investments and resources that arespeci(cid:28)ctotherelationshipinnature.

Ideally,suchananalysisisperformedbefore entering the partnership, although it requires the manager to make a substantial number of assumptions.
These foundations of relationships comprise the broad range of factors managers must consider when developing and implementing durable relationships.
In addition, developing relationships consist of a series of phases that explains how they are identi(cid:28)ed through how the partners become committed to continuous improvement of the relationship.
The next section presents these phases of relationship development.
8.4.2 Phases of relationship development Strategic partnerships experience four major developmental phases Exhibit 8.5 represents the life cycle of a relationship.
The length of phases and transitions between phases will vary due to cultural and/or social di(cid:27)erences.
Managers should be aware of the current phase of the relationship and evaluate decisions based upon how they impact the development of the relationship.
Dissolution can occur at any time when incompatibilities exist between partners as the relationship develops.
Exhibit 8.5: The relationship development process AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>160 CHAPTER 8.
SECURING AND MANAGING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS The awareness phase begins before any transactions actually occur.
During this phase, partners are locating, identifying and qualifying various prospects.
Since no transactions take place, company image and reputation are weighed heavily during this phase.
Awareness means assessing the business relationships needed to advance organizational goals, evaluating potential areas that would bene(cid:28)t from a partnership, and identifying potential partners.
Partnerships can have various types of relationships; some areas may only need to be functional, whereas others may seek to be strategic.
Consequently, identifying which type of relationship would most bene(cid:28)t the (cid:28)rms is imperative and a primary responsibility of managers The exploration phase is considered the test for both parties.
During this phase, parties engage in exchanges to explore potential partnership costs and bene(cid:28)ts.
Although neither side has committed to a relationshipatthispoint,eachtransactionbetweenthetwopartiestestseachoftheircapabilities.
Managers evaluate the transactions in terms of the foundations of relationships discussed above, e.g.
identifying potential measures that indicate successful transactions or estimating the impact on organizational culture should the relationship become established.
After both parties prove that they are capable of performing as needed, the partnership will move to the expansion phase.
In this phase, additional business interactions focused on a long-term relationship are investigated.
The expansion phase may be time consuming because it requires extensive research to be conducted both internally and externally.
The primary activity of this phaseiscomparingtheresultsofaseriesof(cid:28)nancialanalysesofvariouspossibleinteractionsandrelationship types.
A contract, or at least a verbal commitment, for a certain period of time must take place for the com- mitment phase to begin.
This stage is usually the (cid:28)nal and most complex stage of a strategic relationship.
Duringthisphase,thedetailsofthetransactionsaredecided,includinginitialinvestmentsthatwillbemade into the partnership and speci(cid:28)cation of how returns will be divided among the partners.
The dissolution phase is the decision to end the partnership.
This may occur during any of the various phases of the rela- tionship development process.
Dissolution may arise for a number of reasons, including rising costs, poor performance, orchangesincorporategoals.
Thedecisiontoendthepartnershipshouldnotbetakenlightly, but when all other options have been exercised it may be the correct choice.
While relationships will follow this development life cycle, a manager’s skills will substantially impact how the relationship develops and thesuccessoftheagreementsfortheorganization.
Traininganddevelopmentprogramsformanagersshould explicitly include skills for developing relationships.
8.4.3 Skills for building positive relationships Two key skills that promote positive relationships are negotiation and facilitation.
Negotiation skills can assistwithproblemsolvingandcon(cid:29)ictresolutionwithpartnerorganizations.
Facilitation skillsdealwith the understanding of group processes and feedback.
Negotiation skills are necessary for managers to ensure they understand the goals and tactics of others.
Negotiation involves understanding goals and the impacts of the range of possible outcomes on an organiza- tion.
Adept negotiators must be able to identify compromises such that both partners are supportive of the resulting agreements.
Facilitation involves listening to the views of all parties and ensuring that critical issues are heard, regardless of their origin.
Active facilitation brings objectivity to group processes and results in shared understandingsofpotentialopportunitiesandthecostsofpursuingthoseopportunities.
Technologycanaid managers in facilitating group discussions and recording group interactions.
In some situations, professional facilitation may be appropriate if either side has reached a point where reaching a mutual understanding is di(cid:30)cult.
8.5 Strategies for external relationships6 The rapid change in technology and the development of the Internet has changed the traditional de(cid:28)nitions of manufacturers, suppliers, and customers.
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the integration of 6Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35469/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>161 key business processes that add value for customers and other stakeholders.
This added value is created through the integration of networks of suppliers that provide products, services, and information.
Supply chainmanagementallowsthisnetworkofcooperatingagentstoperformoneormoresupplychainfunctions, potentially reducing costs and resulting in a competitive advantage for the organization.
Exhibit 8.6: Movement through a supply chain Theabove(cid:28)gureillustratesthemovementofproductsthroughasupplychainnetwork.
Thesupplychain begins when suppliers send raw materials to a factory.
The factory may use the materials in a number of ways.
They can either manufacture subcomponents or assemble the materials into (cid:28)nished products to be sent to the warehouse or distribution center where customers can get the products.
In order for the supply chain to be successful, organizations must recognize that they are but one player in the long chain that starts with suppliers and also includes transporters, distributors, and customers.
The organizations must interact cooperatively with their channel partners (Gandhi, 2003).
An important issue relating to the development of a collaborative supply chain is following speci(cid:28)ed ordering and replenishment policies.
AnexampleofCollaborativeSupplyChainPlanning(CSCP)isVendorManagedInventory(VMI).
Vendor Managed Inventory allows the supplier to receive electronic data to maintain constant infor- mation about the manufacturer’s sales and stock levels.
The supplier is then responsible for creating and managing the inventory replenishment schedule.
VMI is de(cid:28)ned as a process where the supplier generates orders for customers based on demand information sent by the customer (Gandhi, 2003).
VMI leads to changes in both the buyers’ and suppliers’ inventory management activities.
VMI has not become a stan- dard way of managing the replenishment process in the supply chain due to some practical issues that have slowed down its implementation in many organizations.
One problem may exist because the supplier and manufacturer are unwilling to share information because of a lack of trust.
In order for VMI to be e(cid:27)ective, it has to produce observable bene(cid:28)ts, especially in the reduction of inventory costs.
Some of the bene(cid:28)ts of VMI include: • lower customer inventories • better forecasts • reduced costs • improved services • strengthening competitive advantage • strengthening buyer-supplier relationships Similar to SCM and VMI, Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) was developed toallowbettercommunicationofcontrolinformation,whichenablescoordinationandoptimizationofshared AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>162 CHAPTER 8.
SECURING AND MANAGING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS business processes.
CPFR is de(cid:28)ned as an initiative among all participants in the supply chain intended to improve the relationship among them through jointly managed planning processes and shared information (Seifert, 2003).
When successful, it also improves relationships between producers and retailers.
Oneofthe(cid:28)rstCPFRprojectswasinitiatedbyWal-MartandWarner-Lambert,whichmergedwithP(cid:28)zer in2000.
Thisprojectwasintendedtoreduceinventoriesacrossthesupplychain.
Itprovidedcomparisonsof salesandorderforecastsofeachtradingpartnerandhighlightedanyvisibleforecastdi(cid:27)erencesearlyenough for the partners to resolve any potential issues.
Warner-Lambert applied CPFR to the Listerine mouthwash products by sharing of forecasts and responding to inconsistencies between the collaboration partners’ fore- casts.
In Warner-Lambert’s case, Wal-Mart’s promotions created large swings in consumer demand, which Warner-Lambert was unaware of prior to CPFR.
Warner-Lambert maintained substantial inventory as a hedgeinordertopreventsuppliesfromrunningoutofstock.
Wal-MartandWarner-Lambertindependently calculatedthedemandtheyexpectedsixmonthsinadvance.
Thepartnerssharedthisinformation,aswellas theweeklyforecast,andtheyworkedtogethertoresolvevariationsbetweentheirforecastsonaweeklybasis.
Wal-Mart began placing orders six months in advance, instead of nine days, so that Warner-Lambert was able to construct a smoother production plan.
This allowed Warner-Lambert to maintain production based on consumer demand for Listerine rather than maintaining su(cid:30)cient stock.
Wal-Mart’s in-stock position improved and sales increased, while inventories dropped.
Additionally, Warner-Lambert’s supply manage- ment improved substantially.
Optimal applications of CPFR occur when, for example, many other retailers join Wal-Mart in sharing their projected demand with Warner-Lambert.
Combining demand forecasts from many retail customers makes it possible for Warner-Lambert’s production plans to be much better aligned with total market demands.
Bene(cid:28)ts of using CPFR are: • drastically improved reaction times to consumer demand • higher precision of sales forecasts • direct and lasting communication • improved sales • inventory reduction • reduced costs TheCPFRprocessmodelisdividedintothreephases: planning,forecasting,andreplenishment.

Accessed 30 December 2008 Planning consists of identifying an opportunity for collaboration, then developing an agreement to col- laborate, as well as forming a collaborative business plan.
Forecasting is the most important part of the model.
It provides the mechanism through which needs are determined.
It is improvement of this aspect of the supply chain through which all of these strategies provide advantages over more traditional methods.
Replenishment involves making and delivering the product consistent with the needs schedule developed by the forecast.
More accurate forecasts lead to production of only the needed products, which smooths the productionscheduleandresultsinpricestability.

Workers and machines are multifunctional in lean systems.
Workers are required to perform various tasks and help in the improvement process.
The machines are arranged in small, U-shaped work cells; this structure enables parts to be processed in a continuous (cid:29)ow.
Workers produce parts one at a time and transport them between the cells in small lots.
The only schedules prepared are for the (cid:28)nal assembly line.
This schedule (cid:16)pulls(cid:17) sub-components through production by making requests to stations that cascade to production lines.
Nothing is done until requested by the next station.
The system is best implemented when suppliers are few in number and are reliable.

Outsourcing is the term used to designate a relationship in which a partner company performs business functions.
Common examples of outsourced functions for companies in the developed world are software development and call centers.
The principle justi(cid:28)cation for outsourcing functions like these from, for example, the US to India is that prevailing wage rates for these kinds of tasks are much lower than in the US and the Indian partner companies hire and train employees who speak English and are skilled at their jobs.
There’s a di(cid:27)erence between outsourcing and o(cid:27)-shoring.
When a vendor in another country performs an outsourced function, o(cid:27)-shoring is the correct terminology for describing the relationship.
The jobs being outsourced in an organization do not necessarily have to be outsourced to another country.
O(cid:27)-shoring can result in signi(cid:28)cant savings due to wage and currency discrepancies among countries.
However, quality controls must be maintained to ensure that the products and services provided are returning the expected results.
Outsourcing is typically done by organizations who outsource non-core processes that are ine(cid:30)cient, di(cid:30)cult to manage, or too costly.
Choosing a supplier to meet an organization’s outsourcing needs depends on the business process being outsourced, the scope of the project to be outsourced, as well as geographic factors.
Business processes that are often considered good candidates to outsource include, but are not limited to: • administration (audit, tax) • asset and property management • (cid:28)nance (accounting, billing, accounts payable, accounts receivable) AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>165 • human resources (bene(cid:28)ts administration, payroll) • information systems (development and operations) • miscellaneous (energy services, customer service, mailroom, food processing) • procurement/logistics Businessprocessoutsourcingisbecomingincreasinglyimportant.

The bene(cid:28)ts need to outweigh the risks in order for outsourcing to be e(cid:30)cient and e(cid:27)ective (Halvey, 2000).
A typical bene(cid:28)t/risk analysis is: Bene(cid:28)ts: • cost savings • increased (cid:29)exibility • better customer or employee service • higher productivity • ability to concentrate on the core business • implementation of wide initiatives • movement of assets o(cid:27) books • more resources • variety of skills • access to new methodologies and technologies • training expense reduction • greater (cid:29)exibility Risks: • loss of control • di(cid:30)culty in managing costs • additional liability • di(cid:30)culty in bringing the business process back in-house • reduced (cid:29)exibility Uncertainty in outsourcing occurs when an organization is not sure which business process function to out- source.
Organizations should be overly inclusive with what needs to be outsourced.
Including an unbundled requirement where the vendor provides separate pricing for certain functions can be helpful.
Also, deci- phering through the complexity of outsourcing can be easier once determining where the services will be provided.
The next step in assessing outsourcing is to identify potential vendors that have the desired resources, capabilities, and experience.
The following will provide bene(cid:28)cial information to help make an informed decision: • vendor information from industry reports/survey • looking at industry publications • talking to other outsourcing customers • sharing goals and concerns with chosen vendors AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>166 CHAPTER 8.
SECURING AND MANAGING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS 8.5.2 Potential external relationship obstacles Outsourcing o(cid:27)ers a number of potential bene(cid:28)ts for companies; however they cannot ignore the obstacles that come along with outsourcing.
Some countries have not achieved the desired bene(cid:28)ts from outsourcing, because they have not realized the expected cost reductions anticipated from outsourcing their business processes to a third party.
The lack of capable suppliers and service providers is a major problem.
Losing control over the outsourced process is not uncommon.
Additionally, problems and issues may emerge due to the integration of services and systems provided by the vendor.
Problemswithinthenetworkedorganizationusuallyariseduetothefailureinidentifyingallstakeholders and network partners.
All nodes and partners in the networked organization have to know and recognize all thestakeholdersinvolved.

All nodes within a relationship must fully understand the mission and goals.
Having incompatible missions and goals will destroy a relationship and no bene(cid:28)ts will beachieved.
Also, problemsmayarisefromclashingcompanycultures.
Therefore,whenchoosingasupplier or a partner in the networked organization, having similar goals, missions, and similar ways of performing the business processes are vital for the success of the relationship.
8.6 Chapter summary8 This chapter presents the basics necessary for developing relationships among organizations.
These include the common types of external relationships, phases of relationship development, the building blocks of successful relationships, and the skills necessary for developing a variety of relationships.
Several strategies for managing external relationships were presented that focus on the integration of the processes of multiple organizations to create (cid:16)virtual suppliers(cid:17) that bene(cid:28)t from rapid information exchange and just-in-time adjustment of sales forecasts and production capacities.
Managers must consider the many factors of each situation and design a unique relationship or set of relationships that enable the organization to accomplish its goals in the most e(cid:30)cient manner possible.
Yet e(cid:30)ciency is not enough, as the needs for (cid:29)exibility and quality assurance lead to ever more integrated networks of organizations, which require strategic perspectives for maximizing pro(cid:28)tability.
It is expected that every organization be involved in a variety of external relationships, where each relationship is justi(cid:28)ed according to cost and quality.

Therearemanycomputer-basedaccounting systems available now, for relatively low cost, that make it easier for an entrepreneur to use software on a PC or the Internet to run an accounting system.
We discuss some of the software options you may want to consider in Section 10.1, (cid:16)Leveraging with information technology(cid:17).
Although it is possible to keep essential accounting records manually, or perhaps on a series of spreadsheets, you will (cid:28)nd that it is much easier and more reliable to simply use accounting software from the beginning.
You may need the advice of an accounting professional to work with you in setting up your accounting records and helping you select and implement a suitable accounting package.
On the other hand, you may be able to handle the task yourself.
In any event, starting your business with a well-designed accounting system tailored to the needs of your business will be worth the e(cid:27)ort.
9.3 Why an accounting system is important3 Professionalaccountantslookattheaccountingrecordsandreportsofabusinessfromtwoperspectives.
The term they use to describe these two perspectives is (cid:28)nancial accounting and managerial accounting.

FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 170 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION Wikipedia has good de(cid:28)nitions of both perspectives in order to help you understand the di(cid:27)erence between the two.
4 Financial accountancy (or (cid:28)nancial accounting) is the (cid:28)eld of accountancy concerned with the 5 6 7 preparation of (cid:28)nancial statements for decision makers, such as stockholders , suppliers , 8 9 banks , employees, government agencies , owners, and other stakeholders.
The fundamental 10 needfor(cid:28)nancialaccountingistoreduceprincipal-agentproblem bymeasuringandmonitoring agents’ performance and reporting the results to interested users.
Financial accountancy is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organi- zation or not involved in the day to day running of the company.
In short, Financial Accounting is the process of summarizing (cid:28)nancial data taken from an orga- nization’saccountingrecordsandpublishingintheformofannual(ormorefrequent)reportsfor the bene(cid:28)t of people outside the organization.
Financial accountancy is governed by both local and international accounting standards(cid:17).
(Wikipedia 2009a).
In addition, (cid:28)nancial accounting records and (cid:28)nancial statements are essen- tial sources of information for the preparation of tax returns.
Management (or managerial) accounting, on the other hand, is concerned with the provisions and use of accounting information to managers within organizations, to provide them with the basis to make informed business decisions that will allow them to be better equipped in their management and control functions.
In contrast to (cid:28)nancial accountancy information, management accounting information is: • usually con(cid:28)dential and used by management, instead of publicly reported • forward-looking, instead of historical • pragmaticallycomputedusingextensivemanagementinformationsystemsandinternalcon- trols, instead of complying with accounting standards This is because of the di(cid:27)erent emphasis: management accounting information is used within an organization, typically for decision-making(cid:17).
p. 189 You will not need to be terribly concerned about (cid:28)nancial accounting when your business is just be- ginning, inasmuch as the kinds of information you will need falls into the category of internal management information rather than information for external stakeholders.
Also, note that (cid:28)nancial accounting re- ports must be prepared in accordance with national and international accounting standards.
In the United States the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has been the designated independent entity for established accounting reporting standards since 1973.

9.4 Basic types of accounts16 The six basic types of accounts used in a typical accounting system, according to Wikipedia are: • asset accounts • liability accounts • equity accounts • revenue or income accounts • expense accounts • contra accounts Each type of account is discussed below (adapted from p. 189).
In subsequent sections of this chapter we will discuss how they are used in an accounting system.
• Asset accounts: represent the di(cid:27)erent types of economic resources owned by a business, common examples of asset accounts are cash, cash in bank, equipment, building, inventory, prepaid rent, good- will, accounts receivable.
Assets are usually broken down into three categories: Current assets, (cid:28)xed assets, and intangible assets.
Current assets are assets which could be converted to cash fairly quickly if necessary, certainly in less than a year.
Examples of current assets include cash, cash in bank, in- ventory,prepaidrent,andaccountsreceivable.
Fixedassetsareassetsofamorepermanentnaturelike manufacturingequipment,buildingsowned,andthelike.
Intangibleassets,likegoodwill,aremonetary values assigned to intangibles like a brand name.
It is typically used when accountants need to justify the purchase price of one company by another when the price cannot be justi(cid:28)ed by the monetary value of the purchased company’s assets minus liabilities.
Intangible assets are beyond the scope of this chapter as they apply more to larger corporations than to a start-up business.
• Liability accounts: represent the di(cid:27)erent types of economic obligations by a business, such as accounts payable, bank loan, bonds payable, accrued interest.
Current liabilities are liabilities which are scheduled to be paid within a short period of time, usually less than a year.
Examples of current 11http://www.fasb.org/ 12http://www.fasb.org/ 13http://www.icpak.com/ 14http://www.micpa.com.my/ 15https://www.saica.co.za/ 16Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35481/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>CHAPTER 9.
FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 172 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION liabilities include accounts payable to creditors, like suppliers, current amounts payable to employees (payroll) and interest due on short term loans.
Long-term liabilities (sometimes called (cid:28)xed liabilities) are liabilities of a more permanent nature like loans that are not due in the current year (long-term debt), and the like.
• Equity accounts: represent the residual equity of a business (after deducting from assets all the liabilities).
In the case of a start-up company totally (cid:28)nanced by the founder, it is often called owner’s equity and represents the capital provided by the owner.
If the company is a corporation and stock has been issued to the owner and to others, it is often called stockholders’ equity.
• Revenue accounts or income: representthe company’sgrossincomebeforeexpensesarededucted.
Common examples include sales, service revenue, commissions, and interest income.
• Expense accounts: represent the company’s expenditures to enable itself to operate.
Common examplesareemployeecosts(payrollandfringebene(cid:28)ts),supplies,software,telephonebills,electricity and water, rentals, depreciation, bad debt, interest, and insurance.
• Contra-accounts: from the term ciccia, meaning to deduct, these accounts are opposite to the other (cid:28)ve above mentioned types of accounts.
For instance, a contra-asset account is accumulated depreciation.
This label represents deductions to a relatively permanent asset like a building.
It accumulates an annual charge in recognition that a (cid:28)xed asset like a building is not used up over the courseofayear, butthatithasausefullifemeasuredinmultipleyears.
Sinceincertaincountriesand under certain economic conditions real estate tends to steadily rise in price, perhaps a better example is a truck purchased for use in the business.
Its value is more likely to continue to decrease over the years.
Even though the market value of a building might increase rather than decrease over the years, accountants will still reduce its value by an annual depreciation charge each year.
This is a good example of how (cid:28)nancial accounting di(cid:27)ers from managerial accounting from the owner’s perspective.
Depreciation on a building or a truck reduces income for tax purposes in most countries, so it is to the owner’s advantage to re(cid:29)ect depreciation charges in the company’s accounting records.
On the other hand, you can bet that the owner knows the true market value of the building when it comes time to sell it!
9.5 Chart of accounts17 Setting up an appropriate chart of accounts will take some careful thought on your part because you want to be sure that accounts are set up in each category (i.e.
assets liabilities, etc.)
that will enable you to accumulate accounting transactions in a meaningful way.
As a starting point, you should consider the kinds of information you will need in order to run your business.
You may then go on to consider other types of information that may be required for (cid:28)nancial reporting, as we discussed earlier.
Setting up a chart of accounts is best understood if we walk through an example.
Let us suppose a young entrepreneur plans to start a men’s clothing store and needs to develop a chart of accounts.
Typically, accounts in a chart of accounts each have an account number.
This is no di(cid:27)erent than you having a unique account number for companies you deal with, such as a bank or a telephone company.
A number uniquely identi(cid:28)es you from another customer that might have exactly the same name and is easier to use in a computerized customer accountingsystem.

For example, starting with the asset account category, you may decide that you need to begin your business with at least the following accounts: Account Number Account Name 100 Cash on Hand (Petty cash) 105 Cash in Bank 110 Accounts Receivable 115 Inventory for resale 120 O(cid:30)ce equipment Table 9.2: Examples of current asset accounts in a chart of accounts The same process is followed with all of the account types until your chart of accounts is complete, and contains all of the categories you believe will be needed in order to accumulate accounting information in meaningful categories.
Fortunately, there are many sources where you can obtain sample charts of accounts by type of business thatyoucanuseasaguideandstartingpoint.
Onesourceofsuchinformationcanbethenationalassociations (or institutes) of professional accountants we referred to previously in this chapter.
Another source is the providers of accounting software we will discuss later in this chapter and in Chapter 10.
One other option is to do an Internet search for a sample chart of accounts for your type of business.
For example, we did a simple Google search for a (cid:16)Bed and Breakfast(cid:17) (B&B) sample chart of accounts and found a 98 page document that discusses almost every issue someone who wants to start a B&B needs to know, including a sample chart of accounts, beginning on page 90 (p. 189).

FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 174 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION Here’s a simple example of an Income Statement: Income Statement - Bill’ s Bicycle Shop - Year 2009 Sales $20,000 Cost of goods sold −8000 Gross Margin $12,000 Payroll Costs −6000 Rent −2000 Other expenses −1000 Net Income $3,000.00 The only items that need additional explanation are (cid:16)Cost of goods sold(cid:17) and (cid:16)gross margin(cid:17).
The cost of goods sold is the total cost the owner of a business paid for products sold.
If the owner of Bill’s Bicycle Shop simply buys bicycles from the manufacturer and has them shipped to the shop, the cost of a bicycle is whatever bill paid the manufacturer plus the cost of shipping it to the shop and any labor cost that might be involved in assembling the bicycle before putting it on display for customers to see.
The Cost of goods sold shown on the Income Statement (USD 8,000) is the total costs associated with all of the bicycles sold by Bill in the year 2009.
This is the accounting concept of (cid:16)matching(cid:17).
(The Sales (cid:28)gure of USD 20,000 is the total of the prices paid by all of the customers who bought bicycles from Bill during the year).
Grossmarginissimply thedi(cid:27)erencebetweenSalesandtheCost ofgoodssold.

The greater the gross margin is the more pro(cid:28)table a business is likely to be.
For example, see if you can determine what Bill’s gross margin and pro(cid:28)t would be if he had to sell his bicycles at a discountbecauseofcompetitivepressureandhissalesrevenuefortheyearamountedtoUSD17,000instead of USD 20,000.

Am I making money or not?
And if not, why not?

It is because the sum of the asset accounts must equal the sum of the liability and owner’s equity accounts.
In other words, they must be in balance.
You can also see why it is sometimes called a statement of (cid:28)nancial position.
It shows the condition of the business, in (cid:28)nancial terms, as of a speci(cid:28)c date.
Next, we will discuss a short history of accounting and the invention of double-entry bookkeeping, a technique that is of great assistance to accountants and bookkeepers in assuring the accuracy of accounting records and the reports that are prepared from them.
9.7 A short history of accounting and double-entry bookkeeping19 There are many stories of how accounting began, but most writers agree that it has a long history, going back 5,000 years or so.
Legend has it that wealthy individuals, wanting to keep track of their possessions (cattle,storesofgrain,goldornamentsandsoforth),hiredscribestokeeprecordsofadditionsanddeletions to their lists of possessions as they bought, sold, or traded them.
One supposes that that they wanted to be surethatanychangeswerelegitimate;thatlosseswerenotduetotheft,andthatif100cattlewerepurchased that the herd increased by 100.
From time to time, a count of possessions would be made and compared to the records maintained by the scribe.
Any unexplained losses would be a signal that something was amiss and worthy of investigation.
Modern bookkeeping is generally thought to have been invented during the Italian Renaissance (around 1494 AD, according to one version: Formal accounting was invented by a Franciscan friar named Luca Pacioli in 1494 in his pa- per "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" ("Everything About Arithmetic,GeometryandProportion").
(cid:16)Thetreatisedescribeddouble-entrybookkeeping(cid:22)that for every credit entered into a ledger there must be a debit, a concept created by Florentine merchants and hailed by Goethe as "one of the most beautiful discoveries of the human spirit".
(cid:16)Threetraitssharedbysuccessfulmerchants,Mr.
Pacioliwrote,wereaccesstocash,aconstantly updated accounting system and a good bookkeeper.
His contemporary Christopher Columbus apparently knew that: On his voyage to the New World, he took a royal accountant to track his "swindle sheet when he started to (cid:28)gure the cost of gold and spices he would accumulate", according to Alistair Cooke’s 1973 book "America."
(p. 189) In my opinion, Goethe was exaggerating when he called double entry bookkeeping "one of the most beautiful discoveries of the human spirit".
I can think of many other discoveries that are more beautiful, but as the old saying goes: (cid:16)Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder(cid:17) and perhaps Goethe was a bookkeeper at heart.
At any rate, the discovery of double-entry bookkeeping was undeniably important, because, as Wikipedia explains: Double-Entry Bookkeeping is a system that ensures the integrity of the (cid:28)nancial values recorded in a (cid:28)nancial accounting system.
It does this by ensuring that each individual transaction is recordedinatleasttwodi(cid:27)erent(sections)nominalledgersofthe(cid:28)nancialaccountingsystemand so implementing a double checking system for every transaction.
It does this by (cid:28)rst identifying values as either a Debit or a Credit value.
A Debit value will always be recorded on the debit side (left hand side) of a nominal ledger account and the credit value will be recorded on the 20 credit side (right hand side) of a nominal ledger account .
A nominal ledger has both a Debit (left) side and a Credit (right) side.
If the values on the debit side are greater than the value of the credit side of the nominal ledger then that nominal ledger is said to have a debit balance.

FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 176 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION Each transaction must be recorded on the Debit side of one nominal ledger and that same transaction and value is also recorded on the Credit side of another nominal ledger hence the expression Double-Entry (entered in two locations) one debit and one credit (p. 189).
Here is a simple example to give you a feel for the way that double entry bookkeeping works: Example 9.1 Let us assume that the owner of Bill’s Bicycle Shop, which we discussed above, bought some new bicycles on credit, for inventory.
This is how the accounts would be a(cid:27)ected: Debit the inventory - new bicycles account: USD 2,000 Credit the accounts payable account: USD 2,000 Next let us assume that the owner had some extra cash and decided to pay down some of our bank loan.
This is how the accounts would be a(cid:27)ected: Debit the loan from the bank account: USD 1,000 Credit the cash account: USD 1,000 Note two things.
First, a single transaction a(cid:27)ects two accounts (a double-entry).
Secondly, note that a debit to an asset account increases the value of the account and a debit to a liability (or owner’s equity) accountdecreasesitsvalue.
So,whenUSD1,000ispaidtothebank,thedebittotheloanfrombankaccount reduces the amount we owe to the bank, and the credit to cash decreases the balance in our cash account.
9.8 Ledgers21 Theversionquotedabovestatesthatdebitsandcreditsmustbeenteredintoaledger,soitisimportantthat you understand what this term means, as it may be new to you.
As you will see from some of the additional sources we quote, oftentimes journal and ledger are used to describe the same thing.
So, what is a ledger?
A ledger is simply a collection of the accounts of your business where transactions are recorded using the double-entry bookkeeping method.
If you are operating with a completely manual system, your ledgers (you will have more than one, as discussed in a moment) are on paper, usually in a bound volume pre-printed in a special way to accommodate the recording of transactions.
If you are using a pre-coded application software package on a PC for your accounting system, your ledgers will be on the computer.
9.8.1 Types of ledgers Mostorganizationsoperatewithtwotypesofledgers,theGeneralLedgerandoneormoresubsidiaryledgers.
The General Ledger contains a minimum of one page for each account in the chart of accounts.
According to one authoritative source: It is also known as G/L and The Final Book of Entry.
It is a collection of all balance sheet, income, and expense accounts used to keep the accounting records of a company.
A General Ledger is a perpetual record of the activity and balances of the accounts.
Each company has only one General Ledger (p. 189) However, some accounts, like accounts receivable or accounts payable, are comprised of the sum of a numberofindividualamounts.
Letuslookataccountsreceivableasanexample.
Supposewehaveabalance (i.e.
total) amount of USD 3,250 in our accounts receivable account in the General Ledger.
Remember, accounts receivable are amounts our customers owe us.
Therefore, the USD 3,250 balance we have in our accounts receivable is the sum total of amounts owed to us by several individual customers.
For the sake of convenience,wekeepasubsidiaryledgerofindividualaccountsreceivableasillustratedinExhibit9.1below.

AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>177 Exhibit 9.1: Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger example The Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger has one page for each customer who has earned the right to be extended credit, and is expected pay o(cid:27) their outstanding balance each month.
The sum of the customer balances in the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger must equal the Accounts Receivable balance in the company’s General Ledger.
In the case of the Accounts Receivable example, when a sale is entered in the ledger, a corresponding entry is made in a Sales Journal.
And, when a payment is received and posted to a customer’s account in the Accounts Receivable ledger, a corresponding entry is made in a Cash Receipts Journal.
Similar subsidiary ledgers are created any time there is a su(cid:30)cient number of detail accounts to warrant it.
Detailed accounts may be employee accounts for payroll, or product numbers for inventory, for exam- ple.
Setting up subsidiary ledgers and journals for special purposes like this shields the General Ledger from an excessive amount of detail and, at the same time, preserves the principle of double-entry accounting, makes reconciliations easier and, in general, promotes accuracy in a company’s accounting records.
In real life, of course, things can get more complicated, but this is the basic approach that is followed.

FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 180 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION 9.9 Advanced reports and analyses25 This section discusses some of the more common reports prepared from an accounting system that have, over the years, proven to be valuable tools for managing a business.
9.9.1 Cash (cid:29)ow forecasts There is a saying in business that (cid:16)Cash is King(cid:17).
One of the worst things that can happen to a company is to run short of cash unexpectedly.
This can make it di(cid:30)cult to pay suppliers and employees without scurrying around to raise needed cash quickly, and when you must raise cash quickly you often (cid:28)nd it a di(cid:30)cult and expensive task.
Business owners are not always successful in raising cash quickly and in the worst cases, must go bankrupt.
This is why cash (cid:29)ow forecasts are prepared.
They are easy to prepare and can be quickly done using a spreadsheet program.
They can also be prepared manually.
What a cash (cid:29)ow forecast does is estimate cash inputs and outputs over a period of time, usually at least 90 days in order to give you assurance that your business will have the cash necessary to meet its obligations to others.
If the cash (cid:29)ow forecast shows, for example, that you are in a de(cid:28)cit position two months out, you will have time to raise the necessary cash you need and avoid a sudden cash crisis.
Cash (cid:29)ow forecasts are often prepared for longer periods of time as well, depending on circumstances.
In addition, they are often prepared using various assumptions about the future (e.g.
general economic conditions, sales growth, increased expenses, etc).
As one authoritative website states: By knowing your cash position now and in the future, you can: • Make certain you have enough cash to purchase su(cid:30)cient inventory for seasonal cycles; • Take advantage of discounts and special purchases; • Properly plan equipment purchases for replacement or expansion; • Prepareforadequatefuture(cid:28)nancinganddeterminethetypeof(cid:28)nancing26 youneed(short term credit line, permanent working capital, or long-term debt).
• Show lenders your ability to plan and repay (cid:28)nancing.
For a new or growing business, the cash (cid:29)ow projection can make the di(cid:27)erence between suc- ceeding and failure.
For an ongoing business, it can make the di(cid:27)erence between growth and stagnation.
Preparingacash(cid:29)owprojectionisasomethinglikepreparingyourbudgetandbalancingyourcheckbook at the same time.
Unlike the income statement, a cash (cid:29)ow statement deals only with actual cash trans- actions.
Depreciation, a non-cash transaction, does not appear on a cash (cid:29)ow statement.
Loan payments (both principal and interest) will appear on your cash (cid:29)ow statement since they require the outlay of cash.
Cash is generated primarily by sales.
But in most businesses, not all sales are cash sales.
Even if you have a retail business and a large percentage of your sales are cash, it is likely that you o(cid:27)er credit (charge accounts, charge cards, term payments, layaway, trade credit) to your customers.
Thus, you need to have a means of estimating when those credit sales will turn into cash-in-hand.
() 9.9.2 Working capital analyses Workingcapitaliscommonlyde(cid:28)nedasthefundsabusinessneedstosupportitsnormaloperations.Insome ways, a working capital analysis is similar to a cash (cid:29)ow forecast, but it di(cid:27)ers in its focus on the operating cycle of the business.
Quoting from the website Entrepreneur.com, 25Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35491/1.4/>.
26http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/operating/(cid:28)nmgmt/capital.html AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>181 (cid:16)the operating cycle analyzes the accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable cycles in terms of days.
In other words, accounts receivable are analyzed by the average number of days it takes to collect an account.
Inventory is analyzed by the average number of days it takes to turn over the sale of a product (from the point it comes in your door to the point it is converted to cash or an account receivable).
Accounts payable are analyzed by the average number of days it takes to pay a supplier invoice.
(cid:16)Most businesses cannot (cid:28)nance the operating cycle (accounts receivable days + inventory days) with accounts payable (cid:28)nancing alone.
Consequently, working capital (cid:28)nancing is needed.
This shortfall is typically covered by the net pro(cid:28)ts generated internally or by externally borrowed funds or by a combination of the two.
(cid:16)Most businesses need short-term working capital loans at some point in their operations.
For instance,retailersmust(cid:28)ndworkingcapitaltofundseasonalinventorybuildupbetweenSeptem- ber and November for Christmas sales.
But even a business that is not seasonal occasionally experiencespeakmonthswhenordersareunusuallyhigh.
Thiscreatesaneedforworkingcapital to fund the resulting inventory and accounts receivable buildup(cid:17).
() Aworkingcapitalanalysisispreparedinamannersimilartowhatwedescribedforacash(cid:29)owforecastin that assumptions are made about the impact on working capital as a result of activities during the forecast period in order to provide the business owner with assurance that adequate working capital to support operations will be generated by normal business operations.
If not, alternative sources of working capital must be lined up, and the earlier such a need is recognized, the better.
9.9.2.1 Break-even analysis A break even analysis is designed to show you how much revenue must be generated to cover your (cid:28)xed and variable costs.
Revenue below the breakeven point means the business is losing money and revenue above the breakeven point means the business is pro(cid:28)table.
Let us look at a simple example, one that assumes your business is selling only one product.
In order to calculate the breakeven point you will need to know three things: • Your (cid:28)xed costs • Your variable cost • Your unit selling price Oncethebreakevenpointispassedandrevenuecontinuestorise,yourbusinesswillbepro(cid:28)table.Thisiswhy knowing your breakeven point in terms of unit sales is so important.
The website About.com:Entrepreneurs contains an easy to understand formula for calculating your breakeven point: To conduct your breakeven analysis, take your (cid:28)xed costs, divided by your price minus your variable costs.
As an equation, this is de(cid:28)ned as: Breakeven Point = Fixed Costs/(Unit Selling Price - Variable Costs) This calculation will let you know how many units of a product you will need to sell to break even.
Once you have reached that point, you have recovered all costs associated with producing your product (both variable and (cid:28)xed).

You could use a program such as Excel’s Goal Seek, if you wanted to give yourself a goal of a certain pro(cid:28)t, say USD 1 million, and then work backwards to see how many 27 unitsyouwouldneedtoselltohitthatnumber.

9.9.3 Pro(cid:28)tability analyses (e.g.
by customer, product, region) Therearemanytypesofanalysesthatmanagersprepareinordertogainadeeperinsightintotheoperations oftheirbusinesses.
Oneofthemostimportantoftheseispro(cid:28)tabilityanalyses.
Managers,know,intuitively, that some customers are more pro(cid:28)table than others, that they make more gross margins on some products than others, and if the business has more than just local coverage, that some geographical regions are more pro(cid:28)table than others.
While it is good to know such things intuitively, it is better to know them for sure.
And knowing them for sure requires that systematic analyses be prepared.
According to Wikipedia, (cid:16)(cid:16)Customer pro(cid:28)tability (CP) is the di(cid:27)erence between the revenues earned from and the costs associated with the customer relationship in a speci(cid:28)ed period(cid:17).
(cid:17) (cid:16)Although CP is nothing more than the result of applying the business concept of pro(cid:28)t to a customer relationship, measuring the pro(cid:28)tability of a (cid:28)rm’s customers or customer groups can often deliver useful business insights.

While itisusuallyclearwhatrevenueeachcustomergenerated,itisoftennotclearatallwhatcoststhe(cid:28)rmincurred serving each customer.
(cid:17) So, accountants try and develop some sort of reasonable method of allocating (cid:28)xed andvariablecoststocustomers.
Atypicalmethodistoanalyzeeachcostandtrytodeterminetheproportion attributable to each customer.
A simple and clear-cut example is a situation where a store has both walk-in andon-linecustomers.
Thecostsofrentingandmaintainingthephysicalstorecouldreasonablybeallocated to the customers who purchase goods in person, based on the number of visits or more likely on the amount 27http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/ME/mes8p4.html AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>183 ofsalestoeachcustomer.
On-linecustomerscouldhavethecostsofdevelopingandmaintainingthewebsite allocated to them.
With this information in hand, a customer pro(cid:28)tability analysis can be prepared.
It is usually prepared in descending order by customer pro(cid:28)tability, as illustrated in Exhibit 9.2: Exhibit 9.2: Customer Pro(cid:28)tability Analysis Assume you are the owner of the restaurant supply company illustrated in the exhibit.
What kinds of useful information can you gather from an analysis such as this?
Many companies prepare a similar type of analysis at the gross margin level and skip the step of trying to allocate costs to individual customers.
In this case, cost of goods sold is substituted for (cid:16)allocated costs(cid:17) in column three of Exhibit 9.2, and column four will show gross margin by customer instead of pro(cid:28)tability by customer.
For many managers, gross margin by customer gives them the essential information they need without going through the additional step of trying to allocate costs to customers, which is clouded by its inherent inaccuracies.
9.10 Budgets28 9.10.1 Budgets Earlier, we discussed cash (cid:29)ow forecasts and how they are used.
An extension of the cash (cid:29)ow forecast concept is the operating budget.
Most organizations have them.
A budget is the (cid:28)nancial expression of an organization’soperatingplanforaperiodoftime,usuallyatleastayear.
Priortothebeginningoftheyear, managersprepareaplanforwhattheyhopetoaccomplishinthecomingyearintermsofrevenue,expenses, and net pro(cid:28)t. A more formal de(cid:28)nition of a budget is: (cid:16)A budget is a (cid:28)nancial document used to project future income and expenses.
The budget- ing process may be carried out by individuals or by companies to estimate whether the per- son/company can continue to operate with its projected income and expenses.
A budget may be prepared simply using paper and pencil, or on computer using a spreadsheet program like Excel, or with a (cid:28)nancial application like Quicken or QuickBooks.

FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 184 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION • The process for preparing a monthly budget includes: Listing of all sources of monthly income • Listing of all required, (cid:28)xed expenses, like rent/mortgage, utilities, phone • Listing of other possible and variable expenses(cid:17).
(Biztaxlaw.about.com 2009) Then,astheyearunfolds,actualincomeandexpensesarepostedtotheaccountingrecords,andcompared to what was budgeted, and a variance from budget for each item budgeted (e.g.
sales, selling expenses, advertising costs, etc) is calculated.
Managers responsible for the various income and expense items then examine each variance and, if it is substantial, search for an explanation.
For example, it is one thing if electricity costs are 20 per cent higher than what was budgeted for one month because workmen were using power tools to repair the roof.
In that case, we can expect costs to return to normal when the repair work is completed.
It is quite another thing if costs are higher because the electric company raised its rates.
In that case, we can expect that costs will be at least 20 per cent higher in the future.
9.10.2 Forecasts Most organizations take budget variance to date into consideration each month, and then prepare a revised budget (or forecast) for the balance of the year.
This step is particularly important if variances to date vary from the original budget in a major way.
For example, if sales are less than projected because market conditions are less favorable than anticipated when the budget was prepared, managers may look for ways to increase sales or reduce expenses in order to avoid a loss for the year.
9.10.3 Scenarios There are many other forecasts that managers ask for in order to try and anticipate what the future might hold so they can prepare contingency plans in case of unforeseen events.
Examples of unforeseen events that may well a(cid:27)ect future outcomes are the arrival of a new competitor, a change in the overall economic outlook which could a(cid:27)ect costs and/or revenues either positively or negatively, or even the arrival of a new company in another line of business that could raise prevailing wage rates in your region.

Another word for such forecasts is scenarios.
For example, let us assume that a forecast of the income statement for a business at the end of the year assumes that sales will grow by 8 per cent over the previous year and costs willgrowby6percent.
Amanagermightaskforanalternativescenariowheresalesincreaseby12percent and costs increase by 9 per cent and another scenario where sales decrease by 3 per cent and costs increase by 1 per cent.
The Wall Street Journal had a story recently on how businesses use scenarios for planning pur- poses.

While potential investors may like you as an individual, they want to be sure they will get a return on their investment.
The way you do this is to go over your business plan with them, including the (cid:28)nancial analyses that shows them the path to pro(cid:28)tability.
They will ask you questions to make sure your assumptions are reasonable, so make sure you do your (cid:16)homework(cid:17) in advance, anticipate their questions, and have good answers ready for them.
The author of Section 2.1 discussed several possible sources you can explore to obtain the start-up (cid:28)nancing you will need: • savings • friends and family • micro-(cid:28)nancers • governmental support • barter • bank loans • networking • online network • memberships Savings: If you have been saving your money and have accumulated enough to provide the funds you need to (cid:28)nance your start-up, this is the best way for you to go.
It can be di(cid:30)cult to convince third parties that yourstart-upisagoodinvestment,and,insomecases,youmayhavetorelinquishsomedegreeofownership (andmanagementcontrol)overyourbusinesstoaninvestor.
Thiscanleadtodisagreementswhich,ifserious enough, could cause your investor to demand his or her money returned to them at an inconvenient time.
However, only a small percentage of entrepreneurs are fortunate enough to be able to fund their start-up costs with personal funds, so most are forced to seeking funding elsewhere.
Many entrepreneurs in the US, for example borrow from their credit cards or take out a higher mortgage on their homes to avoid having to get funds from others.
While this is common, it can result in personal (cid:28)nancial disaster if the start-up fails.
Friends and family: Asking friends and families to invest is another common way that start-ups are funded.
Often the potential entrepreneur is young, energetic, and has a good idea for a start-up, but does not have much in the way of personal savings.
Friends and family may be older and have some money set aside.
While your parents, or other family members should not risk all of their retirement savings on your start-up, they may be willing to risk a small percentage of it to help you out.
Sometimes friends your own age are willing to work for little or no wages until your cash (cid:29)ow turns positive.
The term (cid:16)sweat equity(cid:17) is often used for this type of contribution as the owner will often reward such loyalty with a small percentage 29 ownershipoftheorganizationinlieuofcash.
Avariationonthisisbarterortrade.
Asmentionedinhere , this is a method by which you could provide a needed service such as consulting/management advice in return for the resources needed for your start up.
This needs to be accounted for in your accounting records also.
Networking, online networks, and memberships all can be ways of meeting managers who have either successfully launched a star-up or who are in the process of moving their organization forward on the 30 (cid:16)path to pro(cid:28)tability(cid:17).
Adding to some of the examples given in here , you may wish to consider your local chamber of commerce, a Rotary Club, or a local organization comprised of entrepreneurs.
For example, if your start-up is located in Africa, the Africa Business Communities portal could be a good source for you to locate networking opportunities in your community.

FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING; 186 FINANCING YOUR ORGANIZATION (cid:16)The African continent is enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth.
The idea that business is the key to sustainable development in Africa is gaining ground rapidly worldwide.
(cid:16)Africa Business Communities is a portal website that brings the visitor into the heart of the African economy, by granting access to African entrepreneurs.
Currently Africa Business Com- munitieshosts35Africabusinessnetworks,inthefuturethatwillbehundreds(cid:17).
(AfricanBusiness Communities 2009).
31 Bank loans (as stated in here ) (cid:16)are not usually available to early-stage entrepreneurs unless you have a track record of a previous success and/or the assets to put up (as collateral) such as a home you own in return for securing the bank loan(cid:17).
Angelinvestors,venturecapitalists: Venturecapitalistsareusuallynotinterestedinstart-ups.
They tend to invest in young companies after they have demonstrated that they are clearly on a path to prof- itabilityandtheyneedadditionalcapitaltohelpthemgrowquickly.
Angelinvestors, ontheotherhand, are interestedinstart-upcompaniesand, unlikeventurecapitalistswhotendtoseekcontroloftheorganization, angel investors like to leave management of the organization to its founder(s).
Angel investors are always available to provide advice and counsel, however.
This can be extremely valuable to a young entrepreneur as angel investors are usually successful entrepreneurs themselves.
For example, a recent article in Busi- ness Week magazine describes a USD 300 million angel investment (cid:28)rm co-founded by Marc Andreessen, of Netscape Communications fame.
Named Andreessen Horowitz, the (cid:28)rm’s investors (in addition to An- dreessen’sbusinesspartnerBenHorowitz)include(cid:16)prominenttechindustryplayersincludingReidHo(cid:27)man, founderofthesocialnetworkingsiteLinkedIn,andPeterThiel,formerCEOofthepaymentservicePayPal(cid:17).
The article goes on to say that Andreessen Horowitz is expected to concentrate on making investments in technology, with an emphasis on corporate services and Internet businesses that cater to consumers.
Investors who have heard the (cid:28)rm’s pitch say it is adopting a "super angel" strategy in which a modest-size venture (cid:28)rm invests morsels of money into many startups.
(cid:16)They want to sprinkle as many seeds in the ground as possible," says one investor who was approached to invest in the (cid:28)rm but declined.
There’s a twist though: While most super angels (cid:28)nance the (cid:28)rst round of a startup and work closely with the company to launch a product, the investor says Andreessen and Horowitz told him they intend to take a more hands-o(cid:27) approach: They’ll invest in 70 or 80 companies with minimal involvement in most, and then double or triple down on the dozen or so winners that emerge.

Here is a quote from their website where they describe their program: Micro(cid:28)nancing Partners in Africa (MPA) develops sustainable businesses and economically vi- able communities.
We work with community-based organizations to create and support funding systems that furnish small, collateral-free, low-interest business loans.
Grants are given to orga- nizations that provide business, health and nutrition classes.

Realistic micro(cid:28)nancing terms, comprehensive training and the development of a community- based support network result in a high percentage of on-time repayments.
This funding system provides the (cid:28)nancial basis for the provision of additional training, loans and business creation.
Ultimately, thesethrivingbusinesscommunitiesprovidetheeconomicfoundationforcommunity development projects, including schools, health centers, power sources, etc.(p.
189) The one aspect of micro(cid:28)nancers is that their loans are truly (cid:16)micro(cid:17).
They may be too small to be helpful in getting your business started.
But, you never know.
Micro(cid:28)nancing organizations can be a good place to start, and if your needs exceed their normal limits they may be able to refer you to other sources of funding.
There may be micro(cid:28)nancing resources available through UN programs, Rotary.org and other sources.
Finally, governmental support is also a possibility.
As an example, here is a quote from a website describing government grants available to start-ups in the US, along with some of the reasons why the US government is allocating federal funds to private business start-ups: Economic development is very important for every country.
The economic conditions are unpre- dictable and volatile and so every country needs all the help it can get to improve its overall standing.
Businesses are the major contributors to the success of the economy and so the gov- ernment is always willing to extend the needed (cid:28)nancial aid.
Some entrepreneurs are hesitant to get assistance from the government.
But if you’re one of those entrepreneurs with capital problems, don’t hesitate to ask for help from the government.
The government has a huge fund allocation for the grants.
If you want to know more about the government grants, you can simply log on to the internet and search for these entrepreneur grants.
Before an entrepreneur decides to put up a business, he conducts a lot of studies to determine if the business is feasible or not.
If he can prove the feasibility of his business proposal, the government will immediately provide the needed capital assistance through the entrepreneur grants.
If the working capital that you’ve raised from family, relatives, and friends are insu(cid:30)cient, try to contact the local government and ask for the requirements in order to avail the government entrepreneur grant.
You can either do this online or you can visit the physical o(cid:30)ce of the local government of your state or country.

It will also examine how IS forms the foundation for operations management, customer relationship management and (cid:28)nancial and managerial accounting.
While you may be familiar with the term (cid:16)this is the information age(cid:17) it can mean di(cid:27)erent things to di(cid:27)erent people.
In His famous book, The World is Flat, (Friedman 2005) Thomas Friedman explains how IShaschangedthewaytheworldworks.

Examples of these three possibilities are listed below, in order to give you a better appreciation for what is possible: • Knowledge work can be done anywhere.
Perhaps the most common example of this is software de- velopment.

You may be able tosatisfyyourinformationprocessingandrecord-keepingneedswithmanualsystems.
However, astheprice of computers drop you’re your business expands, you may (cid:28)nd it wise, as many small business owners do, to invest in computer-based information systems.
Many people use Information Systems and Information Technology as if they meant the same thing.
They are di(cid:27)erent, and it is important for you to understand the di(cid:27)erence between them.
As illustrated in Exhibit 10.1, an Information System is comprised of two sub-systems, a Social sub-system and a Technology sub-system.
Exhibit 10.1: An information system The discussion of the four components of an Information Systems as well as Exhibit 10.1 above has been 4 extracted from another book in the Global Text library (Information Systems 2008).

In your organization early stages, you may (cid:28)nd it simpleenoughtojustkeeppaperrecordsandcommunicateface-to-faceorbytelephoneratherthanuseemail.
However, modern organizations increasingly rely on information technology as the core of their information systems and part of the reason is that the cost of using computers has decreased as technology improves.
We de(cid:28)ne information technology to include hardware, software and telecommunication equipment that is used to capture, process, store and distribute information.
Hardwareisthephysicalequipment(cid:22)suchasapersonalcomputer,alaptop,aportablecomputingdevice, and even a modern cell phone(cid:22)used to process information.
Software is the set of coded instructions (pro- grams) that direct the hardware to perform the required tasks.
A typical example is Google Docs(cid:22)a word processing program designed to instruct a computer to create text documents.
Telecommunication systems are the networking equipment enabling users and devices to communicate.
An example of a telecommunica- tion system is a telephone network, which allows two callers to interact by voice over a distance.
These three elements(cid:22)hardware, software and telecommunication systems(cid:22)comprise the technology component of an information system.
10.3.2 The process sub-system As discussed in Chapter 7, a process is the set of steps employed to carry out a speci(cid:28)c business or or- ganizational activity.
In other words, a process maps the set of actions that an individual, a group or an organization must enact in order to complete an activity.
Consider the job of a grocery store manager and the process he engages in when restocking an inventory of goods for sale.
The store manager must: • check the inventory of goods for sale and identify the needed items • call individual suppliers for quotations and possible delivery dates • compare prices and delivery dates quoted among several suppliers for the same goods • select one or more suppliers for each of the needed items based on the terms of the agreement (e.g.
availability, quality, delivery) • call these suppliers and place the orders • receive the goods upon delivery, checking the accuracy and quality of the shipped items; pay the suppliers Note that there are multiple viable processes that an organization can design to complete the same activity.
Inthecaseofthegrocerystore,thetimingandformofpaymentcandi(cid:27)erdramatically,fromcashondelivery to direct transfer of the payment to the supplier’s bank account within three months of the purchase.
The critical insight here is that the design of the process must (cid:28)t with the other components of the information system and be adjusted when changes occur.
It must also meet the unique needs of the organization.
For example, imagine the grocery store manager purchasing a new software program that enables her to get quotations from all of the suppliers in the nearby regions and place orders online.
Clearly the preceding process would need to change dramatically, and the store manager would need to be trained in the use of the new software program(cid:22)in other words, changes would also a(cid:27)ect the people component.
10.3.3 People Thepeoplecomponentofaninformationsystemencompassesallthoseindividualswhoaredirectlyinvolved with the system.
These people include the managers who de(cid:28)ne the goals of the system, and the users.
The critical insight here is that the individuals involved in the information system come to it with a set of skills, attitudes, interests, biases and personal traits that need to be taken into account when the organization designs the information system.
Very often, an information system fails because the users do not have enough skills, or have a negative attitude toward the system.
Therefore, there should be enough training and time for users to get used to the new system.

LEVERAGING WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY For example, when implementing an automated payroll system, training on how to enter employees’ account information, how to correct wrong entries, and how to deposit the salaries into each account should be provided to the human resources sta(cid:27).
The bene(cid:28)ts of the system should be communicated to both the human resources sta(cid:27) and the employees in order to build up positive attitudes towards the new system.
10.3.4 Structure The structure (or organizational structure) component of information systems refers to the relationship amongtheindividualsinthepeoplecomponent.
Thus,itencompasseshierarchicalandreportingstructures, and reward systems.
Many of these issues are discussed in Chapter 5.
The structure component plays a critical role in an information system, simply because systems often fail when they are resisted by their intended users.
This can happen because individuals feel threatened by the new work system, or because of inherent human resistance to change.
When designing a new information system the organization needs to be cognizant of the current and future reward system in order to create incentives to secure its success.
10.3.4.1 Relationships between the four components At this point it should be clear how information systems, while enabled by IS, are not synonymous with IS.
Each of the four components discussed above can undermine the success of an information system(cid:22) the best software application will yield little result if users reject it and fail to adopt it.
More subtly, the four components of information systems must work together for the systems to perform.
Thus, when the organization decides to bring in a new technology to support its operation, the design team must adjust the existing processes or develop new ones.
The people involved must be trained to make sure that they can carry out the processes.
If the skills of these individuals are such that they can’t perform the required tasks or be trained to do so, a di(cid:27)erent set of individuals need to be brought in to work with the system.
Finally, the design team must evaluate whether the organizational structure needs to be modi(cid:28)ed as well.
New positions may need to be created for additional responsibilities, and old jobs may need to be eliminated.
The transition from the old way of doing things to the new system needs to be managed, ensuring that appropriate incentives and a reward structure is put in place.
10.3.4.2 Some practical advice for start-ups • Don’tinvestinISsolutionsunlessuntilyoucanseethattheywillprovideyouwithrealbene(cid:28)ts.

• InstallingISsystemsoftentakelongerandcostmorethanoriginallyestimated.
Youshouldhavesome IS skills available to help you get over the rough spots.
• Remember that it is usually a mistake to be one of the (cid:28)rst to use a new technology.
It can be risky, and it is even more important that you have access to personnel with strong IS skills.
At the same time, it can be a mistake to wait too long to gain business bene(cid:28)ts from carefully chosen IS applications, particularly if your competition is taking advantage of IS for e(cid:30)ciency, e(cid:27)ectiveness, and innovation.
10.4 Moving Forward With Information Systems5 When you decide it is time to move forward with leveraging your organization with information systems, you will appreciate the e(cid:27)ort spent on developing a systems plan.

This was the way business information was kept by all organizations, large and small, before the advent of computers.
When PCs became available, their cost was such that the power of the computer was made available at low cost and so today, most organizations of any size have at least one PCorlaptop.

wherewillyouobtainyourhardware, software, and human resources to help you acquire and manage the IS resources you need.
In Chapter 8, we discussed the ways that organizations partner with other organizations to perform essential business functions.
It is very common for organizations to partner with another company to supply them with the specialized knowledge needed to acquire the right combination of hardware, software, and communications services to meet the needs of the organization.
We will discuss these issues more later in this chapter when we discuss the ways organizations develop a systems plan.
Su(cid:30)ce it to say at this point, that you will have many options: For example: • YoucanhireanISprofessionalifyourneedsrequireafull-timeemployeeformanageyourISprocesses (and if you can a(cid:27)ord it).

All of the options have their advantages and disadvantages and we discuss them later in this chapter.
While it is certainly possible for you to hire a programmer and have him or her develop the software programs your organizations need, it is rare when a start-up company needs to do this as there are so many software programs available for you to use (and some of them are free).
In all likelihood, you will begin to move your organization into the (cid:16)information age(cid:17) in one of two ways, either (1) acquiring a suite of commonly-used programs designed for meeting the needs of both individuals and organizations, or (2) acquiring software programs designed speci(cid:28)cally to meet most needs of a small organization.
Each of these options is discussed below: 10.4.1 Acquiring a suite of commonly-used programs Perhaps the best-known suite of commonly used programs is Microsoft O(cid:30)ce.
A basic version of O(cid:30)ce, Microsoft O(cid:30)ce Standard 2007 includes four programs: 1.
Microsoft Word, used for preparing documents 2.
Microsoft Excel, used for preparing spreadsheets (most commonly used for accounting analyses but also useful for basic record-keeping such as customer lists or checkbooks).
3.

LEVERAGING WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY There are several other open-source options available as well, typically at no cost to you.
Some of these are: 1.
Open O(cid:30)ce (Openo(cid:30)ce 2009) 2.
Google Docs (Google 2009) 3.
Zoho (Zoho 2009) In addition to being free, the open source options have the ability to read and write computer (cid:28)le a format compatible with the more widely used Microsoft products.
10.4.2 When to think about using database management software As your business grows and you need to keep accurate records on a computer beyond what is reasonable to do with a spreadsheet program, you should consider adding database management software.
Karen Stille placed a good comparison of the features of database and spreadsheet software a website, QCISolutions.
In summary, she states that: (cid:16)As a general rule of thumb, databases should be used for data storage and spreadsheets should be used to analyze data.
(cid:16)In a nutshell we use a database if... • the information is a large amount that would become unmanageable in spreadsheet form and is related to a particular subject.
• you want to maintain records for ongoing use.
• the information is subject to many changes (change of address, pricing changes, etc.).
• you want to generate reports based on the information.
Use a spreadsheet if... • you want to crunch numbers and perform automatic calculations.
• you want to track a simple list of data.
• you want to easily create charts and graphs of your data.
• you want to create "What-if" scenarios.
(cid:16)In most cases, using the combination of a database to store your business records and a spread- sheet to analyze selected information works best(cid:17).
(Stille 2009) Microsoft’s widely-used database management software is called ACCESS, and versions of Microsoft O(cid:30)ce thatuseACCESSareavailableforpurchase.
MoreinformationisavailableontheMicrosoftsite(Microsoft).
On the other hand, open source database management software is also available at no cost to you.
You may wish to examine one of the following open source packages to see if one of them meets your needs: • MySQL (MySQL 2009) • Zoho Creator (Zoho 2009) One of the prevailing issues with using open source software rather than software you purchase is the level of support you can expect from the software’s creator.
If you pay for software, you have a right to expect excellent documentation and support.
If the software is free, sometimes documentation and support do not meet the same standards.
Much of the support you get is from the community of users.
As of this writing, the worldwide community for ACCESS is much larger, and there are many books written about it.
The opensourcedatabasesarejustasuseful,but(cid:28)ndinginformationandsupportcanbeamoretediousprocess.
However,accordingtotheGartnerGroup,ahighly-respectedtechnologyresearchcompanybasedintheUS, open source database management software is becoming more attractive.
In a report released in November 2008, they made the following observations: AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>197 (cid:16)During 2008, since our last note about open-source database management systems (DBMSs), we have seen an increase in the interest and use of open-source DBMS engines in a production environment.
As this trend continues to gain speed, the cost bene(cid:28)ts of using an open-source DBMS is increasing and the risk of using it is decreasing.
Key Findings: • Lowertotalcostofownership(TCO),comparedtocommercialDBMSs,canberealizedfornon-mission- critical applications.
• There are large third-party software vendors looking to certify open-source DBMSs as a platform for existing applications, including SAP.
• The major open-source DBMS products are now available for installation as a package, without in- volving the source code, including tools to help support the DBMS environment.
• If the technical capabilities of the sta(cid:27) are strong, use of an open-source DBMS in mission-critical environments is possible now.
Recommendations: • Open-source DBMS engines can be used today for non-mission-critical applications with reduced risk over several years ago.
• Only use an open-source DBMS engine supplied by a vendor who controls or participates in the engi- neeringoftheDBMSandalwayspurchasesubscriptionsupportwhenusedinproductionenvironments.
• If open source is part of your overall IS strategy, plan for the use of open-source DBMS engines in mission-critical environments in two to (cid:28)ve years.

Examples of small business (cid:16)suites(cid:17) include the following: Microsoft has a site devoted to software suite solutions for small businesses at 6 http://www.microsoft.com/business/peopleready/ 7 NetSuite (www.netsuite.com ) NetSuite is in a category of software called (cid:16)software as a service (SaaS).
In the SaaS model, the software resides on the servers of the software provider rather than on the using organization’s computer.
The advantages of this model are that users never have to worry about software anddatabackupsorsoftwareupdates.
Thesefunctionsareprovidedatthesoftwarecompany’sdatacenters.
Some SaaS models charge users by the month, others charge them at a variable rate, based on the number of transactions per month and/or the size of their databases.
The downside for some users with SaaS is that the information is not kept (cid:16)in-house.
(cid:17) Although hosted solutions are considered very secure, some 8 users worry about security and privacy issues.
The website, www.2020software.com compares several small business software suites, and has links to the companies’ sites.
There are a number of open source initiatives for small business software you may wish to investigate.

LEVERAGING WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 10.4.3 Creating a web presence Having a web site is now considered as necessary as a phone or fax number even an email address for corresponding with customers.
Since the site will be a re(cid:29)ection of your organization, its product or service, the most important step is to research and plan.
For most business, a Web site can serve as a resource for information and to promote the organization, its brand, and the value of the product or services being o(cid:27)ered.
But many times, businesses as well as individuals create a site for the sake of having one, without takingtimetounderstandwhatcustomersandthebusinessexpectfromasite.
Whenyousetdowntocreate your site, consider the following (cid:28)rst; • Decide on a budget.
• Decide on a name (Domain Name or URL).
Check http://www.whois.com11 to see if the name is already taken.
• Register the name (Domain Name or URL).
Login to a registrar like http://www.godaddy.com12 and follow their instructions for registration.
• Decide how the site will be designed and maintained (who will handle this)?
• What will be the content of the site?
• Decide on a hosting company for the site.
There are hundreds, if not thousands of hosting companies will host your website for as little as $3.95US per month.
A simple Google search will turn up many candidates for you in your locale.
To get an appreciation of the kinds of hosting services that are 13 available from US-based companies, go to http://hostingreview.com .
• Decide whether you will hire someone to build the site for you or if you want to use one of the many template-driven software packages to build it yourself.
Finding out what kinds of information your customers want, and then designing and developing your site to provide up-to-date, ongoing resource materials can help you better position your products or services and serve as a credible (cid:16)go-to spot.
(cid:17) A web site can go from a simple one-page site with your name and mission statement to a site with multiple pages that include on-line sales, newsletters and discussion forums.

Userswillalsousetheinformationprovidetocompareyouwithothers,speci(cid:28)cally your competition.
For you, it’s also another opportunity where you can promote your services and serve the community.
There’s nothing gained by having a Web site that posts dry, out-of-date content.
Keep a pulse on what kind of information about your product/services customers are looking for, and how and where they expect to (cid:28)nd it.
Don’t be too quick to list the areas where you feel you’re strongest(cid:22)remember to put yourself in your customer’s shoes and ask what they want to ask: (cid:16)What’s in it for me (WIIFM) to visit this Web site?
(cid:17) An e(cid:27)ective site should: • Recognize the needs of all who will use your site, vendors, customers and yes even employees, and direct each to the content that will interest them most.
• Be easy to access, read and use with well-thought-out content, useful links, e-mail addresses or phone numbers.
• Provide helpful information on how to keep customers coming back Make your visitors feel con(cid:28)dent about choosing your organization as a provider for the product or services for which they are looking.

Looking at some of the best known websites, several sites stand out for their information, 15 creativity, usefulness and easy of use.
One such site, video how-to site http://www.howcast.com/ , is a gem.
At one time or another we have all tried to do things without reading the instructions.
Howcast.com not only addresses this, but provides video as well.
The key elements of any site are a user-friendly, clean appearance and consistently improving content.
As you determine your needs for a web site, one of the important goals should be to allow your customers toaccess your siteandavoidthe time-consumingprocessof sur(cid:28)ngthe Web forsimilar products orservices.

• Enhanced articles and updates • Special programs and communications 10.5.2 eMarket your website Register your web site with search engines, some registration domain sites may have this available (check their pages and see if they do this) and what it will cost you to have your web site pulled to the front of the list.
The more search engines that you register with the more the site will be displayed to those looking for products or services you o(cid:27)er.
Note: a number of these site are fee based, the more times your site comes up in a search the more it may cost you.
At a minimum, you should consider registering your web page with both Google and Yahoo (instruction with registering on these search engines can be found on there respective sites).
Both of these sites as will as MSN.com are the most commonly used web search engines sites globally.
In this process, when you view your web page, at the bottom you will a see box called MetaTags (Meta tags are text within the source code of a web page.
It provides information to search engines about the contentofaspeci(cid:28)cpageorsite)Information.

Examples: • Fish Store: Fish, Fresh Water, Fish Food, Guppies, Angel, etc.
• Pet Store: Dog, Cat, Hamster, Dog Food, Cat Food, etc.
• Computer Store: Computer, Hard Disk, CD, Hard Drive, DVD, etc.
If you are in a business that does not sell on the internet, you may want to hold o(cid:27) on paying for this option as local people will go to your site from advertising, word of mouth or local web searches.
As noted earlier, having a web presence is a very important part of business today.
You must make sure to take the time to plan and design your site so that it has the professional look and a certain (cid:16)panache(cid:17) or style that will help your business distinguish it from others.
A site that not only will encourage visitors to return, but o(cid:27)ers the information they are seeking the (cid:28)rst time they visit.
With careful and thoughtful planning and decision making you can create a small business site that can and will compete with larger company, enhance your business and increase your margins and pro(cid:28)ts.
10.6 Using Information Technology Competitively16 10.6.1 Competitive advantage When you are starting your business, very likely you will just be interested in substituting computer-based information systems for keeping the basic records of your business and preparing the reports you need to be an e(cid:27)ective decision-maker.
As your business grows, however, you should start to think of the potential bene(cid:28)t of going beyond the basics, as larger companies do, and look for ways to use information systems for competitive advantage.
Many people use the term (cid:16)technology-enabled innovation(cid:17) to describe this process.
Since it is never too early for you to start thinking about such innovation, we’ll cover the topic now.
Justaboutallbusinesseshavecompetitorsandcustomershavechoicesastowhichbusinessestheydecide to patronize.
For example, you, as a customer, may have several restaurants to choose from if you want 16Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35523/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>201 to buy a meal.
Each restaurant, therefore, has other restaurants as competitors.
A restaurant will try to o(cid:27)er its customers a better meal at a better price so that their business is successful in comparison with the competition.
This is what is meant by gaining a competitive advantage.
Of course, if a restaurant is the only one in a small town, its owner does not have to worry so much about competition (unless someone else decides to open a restaurant and compete for its customers.
Businesses that can gain an advantage over their competitors are the ones who will be successful and, as we saw in Chapter 4, most small businesses that start up are doomed to fail.
So, competitive advantage is important.
10.6.2 Porter and competitive advantage In Chapter 3, you were introduced to the ideas of Professor Michael Porter, whose ideas on how to achieve 17 a competitive advantage, (cid:28)rst introduced in the 1980’s have stood the test of time.
Recall that Porter’s model consisted of three main categories: • The (cid:28)ve Forces Model • Three Generic Strategies • The Value Chain Inthissectionwewilldiscusshowthecreativeuseofinformationtechnologyandcommunicationstechnologies (IS) can help organizations gain a competitive advantage.
These ideas were (cid:28)rst expressed in two separate 18 Harvard Business Review articles .
Use IS to alter the (cid:28)ve forces in your favor.
The (cid:28)ve forces are illustrated in Exhibit 10.2: Exhibit 10.2: Porter’s Five Forces Model Source Source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_5_forces_analysis19 17TheinformationonMichaelPorterneedstobecited.

LEVERAGING WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Buyer power can be reduced by using IS in ways that tend to restrict buyers’ choices.
A good example is the frequent (cid:29)yer programs that are o(cid:27)ered by most commercial airlines around the world.
When they enroll in the program, air travelers are awarded (cid:16)miles(cid:17) for every (cid:29)ight they take on, for example, British Airways.
Their accumulated miles are maintained by a computer system.
Travelers can obtain tickets for free (cid:29)ights once as certain number of miles has been accumulated in their account.
What this does is to encouragetravelerstoalwaysusethesameairlinesotheycanqualifyforawardsmorequickly.
Frequent(cid:29)yer programs, ofcourse, havetokeeptrackofa lotofinformation ontheactivitiesof thousandsof travelersand would not be possible to manage without computer systems.
An airline without a frequent (cid:29)yer program is at a competitive disadvantage to airlines which have them.

Forexample,ifthereisjustone storeinatownwhichstockso(cid:30)cesupplies, businesseshavenowhereelsetobuysuppliestheyneedandmay be forced to higher than normal prices.
On the other hand, if a local business is connected to the Internet, it can choose from many other suppliers and possible (cid:28)nd cheaper prices, even when the cost of shipping is considered.
The threat of new entrants can be reduced when IS is used to erect (cid:16)entry barriers(cid:17).
Entry barriers are o(cid:27)erings that a business must make available to its customers if it expects to do business in a certain sector simply because most or all of its competitors o(cid:27)er a certain feature to their customers.
An example is ATM machines o(cid:27)ered by banks.
ATM machines would not be possible without the use of computers and communications networks.
If you had to choose between a bank that o(cid:27)ered ATM machines and one that did not, which one would you choose?
Most likely the one with ATM machines.
ATM machines are this a barrier to enter the banking sector in a particular locale.
ThethreatofsubstituteproductscanusuallybereducedbyusingIStobindcustomersmorecloselytoa businessandcreatewhatiscalled(cid:16)switchingcosts(cid:17).
ThismeansthattheISsystemso(cid:27)eredbyabusinessare soappreciatedbythecustomerthatcustomersarereluctanttoswitchtoasubstituteproduct.
Forexample, there are many free open content software products that equally competitive with the costly brands.
Zoho, Google Docs, Thinkfree, are examples.
One of the reasons many PC users don’t switch to them is that they would have to learn how to use a new package.
Even though the free packages are easy to learn, there is a switchingcostinvolvedthatbindsuserstoMicrosoftO(cid:30)ce: Thetimeitwouldtaketolearnevenarelatively simple package is enough of an obstacle to many users that they conclude that switching is not worth the e(cid:27)ort.
The Intensity of Intra-Industry Competition can often be increased by IS-enabled innovations.
For example, the global reach of the Internet means that competitors for many products and services can be located anywhere in the world.
For example, tax accounting specialists may now (cid:28)nd themselves competing withaccountingspecialistsinlow-costcountries.
Thisisbecomingacommonpracticeascompaniesconclude that IS makes it possible for many forms of knowledge work to be performed anywhere in the world.
Use IS to reinforce your basic strategic positioning.

It must choose between three generic strategiesAsillustratedinExhibit10.3,abusinesscanchoosetobeacostleader,itcanpursueadi(cid:27)erentiated strategy for which consumers are willing to pay more, or it can target a segment of the market with either a low cost or a di(cid:27)erentiated strategy.

TheMazdaMiatatargetsasegmentedmarketforlow-pricedsportscars,whileRollsRoyce targets a segmented (high priced) market for sedans.
Information systems can assist a business in implementing one of Porter’s three generic strategies by, for example, using IS to create operational e(cid:30)ciencies, thus lowering manufacturing costs.
IS can create a di(cid:27)erentiated model by, for example, having a website that permits customers to design a personalized versionofanautomobileandorderitonline,muchthesamewaythatwecanbuypersonalcomputersonline.

10.6.3 Identify your information systems needs It is almost always the case that there are insu(cid:30)cient resources for an organization to take advantage of all of its opportunities to use IS to obtain business bene(cid:28)ts.
Such resources can be in the form of personnel in an internal IS Department or cash to hire outside consultants or both.
Because of this, it is important that organizations be sure they are using their scares resources on IS projects that have the greatest value to the organization.
A time-tested way of doing this is to have a process for setting IS development priorities that are consistent with and aligned with organizational priorities.
In the literature, this is typically called (cid:16)Strategic alignment(cid:17).
There are three general approaches that organizations take to setting priorities for Information Systems projects.
(Some practitioners say (cid:16)there is no such thing as an IS project; there are onlybusinessprojects.
Suchaperspectiveemphasizestheimportanceofobtainingbusinessbene(cid:28)tsfroman 21http://kookyplan.pbworks.com/f/ValueChain.png AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>205 investment in IS).
The three general approaches to setting priorities (also known as developing a strategic plan for the IS function) are: 1.
Have the IS Department set Priorities 2.
Have a Cross-functional Steering Committee set Priorities 3.
Conduct a Systems Planning Project Each of these approaches is discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.
10.6.3.1 Have the IS department set priorities The person in charge of the IS functions, particularly in larger organizations is called the Chief Information O(cid:30)cerorCIO.TheCIOisresponsiblefornewsystemdevelopment,systemsoperations,andmaintenanceof existingsystems.
Ideally,theCIOhasasolidunderstandingoftheorganization’soverallstrategyandtactics as well as a good understanding of IS issues.
A competent CIO should be able, therefore, to do a good job of setting priorities for the IS function.
All too often, however, the CIO is more comfortable with technical issues and undertakes projects that are interesting from a technical standpoint, but o(cid:27)er little in the way of business bene(cid:28)ts.
On the other hand, some CIOs have an insu(cid:30)cient command of technical issues and thereforeoverlookopportunitiestouseIStomaketheirorganizationmoree(cid:30)cient,e(cid:27)ective,andinnovative.
Finding a person with the right blend of business and technical savvy has proven to be di(cid:30)cult, and, thus, CIO has come to be known, in some circles as (cid:16)Career is Over(cid:17).
10.6.3.2 Have a cross-functional steering committee set priorities Manyorganizationsuseacross-functionalsteeringcommitteediscussandagreeonoverallprioritiesfortheIS function.
Allmajorareasofthecompanyarerepresented,including,forexample,accounting,(cid:28)nance,human resources, operations, and sales and marketing.
Having all areas involved provides some assurance that the organizations needs and opportunities are addressed in the proper priority sequence.
The shortcomings of thisapproach,inpractice,howeveristhatsomeheadsofareasmaynotbeassupportiveofISastheyshould be, and the process can become complicated when organizational politics intervene.
For example, the organization’s best opportunity for obtaining business bene(cid:28)ts could lie with a new informationsystemtotrackhowwellsalesareperforminginordertobesurethatcustomerdemandswillbe met,butthisopportunityisnotunderstoodorappreciatedbythesalesmanager.
Withoutthesupportfrom the sales manager and IS project in his or her area would be unlikely to succeed, so the organization’s best opportunity is lost.
On the other hand, it could be the case that the operations manager is has a strong and persuasive personality, and by force of argument in steering committee meetings is able to convince other s that operations projects should get the highest priority.
10.6.3.3 Develop a formal plan for information systems Even small companies will get bene(cid:28)t from taking a relatively short to develop a formal plan for the in- formation systems function.
In Chapter 1, and elsewhere in this book, we have emphasized the value of having a formal business plan to guide the organization.
Many organizations take their business plan down anotherlevelandhaveformalplansforindividualdepartments,suchassalesandmarketing,operations,and human resources.
It is particularly important to have a written plan for the Information Systems function as top management must be assured that the bene(cid:28)ts of IS are being applied in accordance with the overall goalsof theorganization.
ISprofessionals call theend resultof an ISplanning process (cid:16)strategicalignment(cid:17), which simply means that the strategic goals of the IS function are aligned with the strategic goals of the organization.
In a very small organization an information systems plan can be developed by one or two individuals.
In larger organizations, it is usually developed by a project team, sometimes with the assistance of outside consultants.
The important thing is that resources devoted to developing an information systems plan have AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>206 CHAPTER 10.
LEVERAGING WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY knowledge of current and emerging information and communications technologies as well as a solid under- standing of the organization’s strategic plan.
Development of a formal plan usually involves interviewing managers in each organizational unit to obtain their perspectives on issues such as: • The overall strategic plan or direction of the organization • Plans of individual organizational units developed in support of the organization’s plan.
• Industry trends, competitors’ strategies and common practices.
• Legal and regulatory record-keeping and reporting requirements.
• Current problems and opportunities with operational processes.
• Information needs for planning and decision-making.
Identifying business entities (e.g.
customers, products, employees, etc) and data (i.e.
attributes) required to describe each entity.
Once this is done, possible IS projects can be determined by identifying natural groupings of process and data and/or unmet information needs of managers.
Possible projects must then be ranked in priority sequence.
Technical issues must be considered next, because the several applications that the organization eventually uses often share a common technical platform (e.g.
PCs, networked PCs, etc).
As we discussed earlier in this chapter, another option is to adopt the (cid:16)software as a service(cid:17) (SaaS) approach when it is available and appropriate.
Technical issues may cause a reassessment of the priority sequence of possible projects.
For example, it may be easier or more logical to install the organization’s (cid:28)rst application which uses database management software on a smaller project to let personnel get familiar with the software before moving on to a larger, more risky project.

Once a plan is agreed, it is implemented.

10.7 What is IS Risk Management23 The IS risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, in(cid:29)uence and adoption of information/technology solutions (Application, Hardware, Network and People) within an or- ganization.
IS risk consists of IS-related events that could potentially impact the business.
It is also the management of uncertainty within the functions of IS so as to provide the organization with assurance that: • the possibility of a threat occurring is reduced or minimized, and • the impact, direct and consequential, is reduced or minimized.
To provide this assurance, threats must be identi(cid:28)ed and their impact on the organization evaluated so that appropriatecontrolmeasurescanbee(cid:27)ectedtoreducethepossibilityorfrequencyofathreatoccurringand to reduce or minimize the impact on the business.
Information is a key business resource which, in order to be of value, must be correct, relevant and applicable to the business process and delivered in a timely, consistent and usable manner; it must be complete and accurate and provided through via the best use of resources (planned or unplanned), and if sensitive it must have its con(cid:28)dentiality preserved.
Information is the result of the combined application of data, application systems, technology, facilities and people.
IS Risk Management ensures that the threats to these resources are identi(cid:28)ed and controlled so that the requirements for information are met.

(cid:17) Studies like the Chaos Reports published by the Standish Group over the years have documented the extent of IT project successes and failures.
For example, the latest publicly available report, "CHAOS Summary 2009," states: "This year’s results show a marked decrease in project success rates, with 32% of all projects succeedingwhicharedeliveredontime,onbudget,withrequiredfeaturesandfunctions"saysJim Johnson, chairman of The Standish Group, "44% were challenged which are late, over budget, and/or with less than the required features and functions and 24% failed which are cancelled prior to completion or delivered and never used."
"Thesenumbersrepresentadowntickinthesuccessratesfromthepreviousstudy,aswellasasigni(cid:28)cant increaseinthenumberoffailures",saysJimCrear,StandishGroupCIO,"Theyarelowpointinthelast(cid:28)ve study periods.
This year’s results represent the highest failure rate in over a decade" (Standish 2009).
So, you have to be aware of (cid:28)gure like these before you give the go-ahead for an IT project.
Failed IT projects can be disastrous to an organization, even forcing them to go out of business.
Some of the reasons IT projects fail are: • Aninadequateunderstandingofwhatfunctionsandfeatures(i.e.
requirements)theorganizationneeds in the new system.
It would be like trying to build a building before its design has been completed.
• Poor project planning, task identi(cid:28)cation, and task estimation.
Usually this means that essential tasks have been overlooked or under-estimated meaning the project’s time and cost estimates are too optimistic.
• Lackofproperskillsontheprojectteam.
Thiswouldbelikeassigningcarpentrytaskstoanelectrician.
Some IT professionals think they can do anything and this is almost always not true.
• Failure to address problems and/or no project champion.
Just about every IT project has problems.
If they are not dealt with on a timely basis they don’t go away by themselves, they just get worse.
It is helpful in addressing problems if a highly-placed executive is a (cid:16)champion(cid:17) of the project and can step in and get problems solved if the project team is struggling.
• Inadequate testing.
All too often, a new system is put into operation before it has been adequately tested to be sure it handles all conditions it is likely to encounter.
A system failure after conversion can cause normal business processes (like accepting customer orders, for example) to fail.
• No fall-back plan.
Before converting to a new system, the project team should have a tested fall-back plan they can revert to in order to keep business processes working while the new system is adjusted.
• Executive champions should be aware that IT project risks are all too often known to the IT profes- sionals but are not always shared with others.
Therefore, you should always ask that a formal project risk assessment be done at the beginning of a project and that plans are in place to keep risks at a minimum.
10.7.2 Security risks The biggest challenge companies’ face in tackling IS security risks is the growing sophistication of hackers and other cyber-criminals.
Organizations must now contend with a range of hi-tech attacks orchestrated by well-organized,(cid:28)nancially-motivatedcriminals.
WhilelargeorganizationsoftenhaveindependentISsecurity sta(cid:27)s, it is likely that your start-up can focus on just a couple of basic items, such as: • Identifying the value of information stored on your computer(s) and making sure that access to such information is restricted to employees who need to use for legitimate business purposes.
For example, your customer database and customer pro(cid:28)tability analyses should be protected as you would not wantsuchinformationtofallintothehandsofacompetitorastheresultofactionstakenbyadisloyal employee.

We discuss Internet risks in the next section.
10.7.3 Internet risks Companies considering a web site or Internet-based services need to be aware of the various risks and reg- ulations that may apply to these services.
Over the past few decades, the Internet has become critical to businesses, both as a tool for communicating with other businesses and employees as well as a means for reaching customers.
Each day of the week and every month, there are new internet threats.
These threats range from attacks on networks to the simple passing of o(cid:27)ensive materials sent or received via the internet.
The risks and particular regulations that apply may vary depending on the types of services o(cid:27)ered.
For example, Institutions o(cid:27)ering informational websites need to be aware of the various consumer compliance regulationsthatmayapplytotheproductsandservicesadvertisedonline.
Informationneedstobeaccurate and complete to avoid potential liability.
Security of the website is also an important consideration.
Com- panies and some individuals traditionally have relied on physical security such as locks and safes to protect their vital business information now face a more insidious virtual threat from cyber-criminals who use the Internet to carry out their attacks without ever setting foot in an establishment or someone’s home.
More oftenthannot,thesecrimesareconductedfromoutsidetheUnitedStates.

It is clear that no single risk management strategy can completely eliminate the risks associated with Internet use and access.
There is no one special technology that can make an enterprise completely secure.

Some businesses whose products or services directly or indirectly impact the economy or the health, welfare or safety of the public have begun to use cyber risk insurance programs as a means of transferring risk and providing for business continuity.
10.7.4 Summary of IS risk management Managing IS Risk is a daily decision making process aimed at reducing the amount of losses and threats to a company.
It is a pro-active approach to reducing ones exposure to data/information loss and ensuring the integrity of the applications used day-to-day.
An IS security plan should include at minimum a description of the various security processes for speci(cid:28)ed applications, procedural and technical requirements, and the organizational structure to support the security processes.
A risk assessment should be performed (cid:28)rst.
Identifying risks provides guidance on where to focus the security requirements.

They are di(cid:27)erent, and it is important for you to understand the di(cid:27)erence between them.
As we illustrated in , an Information System is comprised of two sub-systems, a Social sub-system and a Technical sub-system.
The Social subsystem has two parts: People and Organizational Structure.
The Technical subsystem also has two parts: technology and Business processes.

If you do decide to move forward with computer-based information systems it is wise to develop a plan (cid:28)rst, and make sure you are proceeding in an orderly manner.
There are three general approaches to developing an IS plan.
You will also (cid:28)nd that you have many options available for hardware and software, and the options can vary widely in initial purchase price and the kind of support provided by the vendor.
If you see value in having a website there are some generally-accepted principles you should follow to make your website e(cid:27)ective.
Many organizations have found ways to use IS for competitive advantage.
Michael Porter’s frameworks, the (cid:28)ve forces model, the three generic strategies, and value chain have proven to be useful tools in coming up with ideas for innovative information systems.
Finally, when an organization has valuable information stored in computers, it is exposed to risks from errors and from various internal and external threats.
It is important for managers to evaluate the risks and come up with cost-e(cid:27)ective measures to be sure the organization is adequately protected from loss or damage to valuable information.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE Coke and Pepsi are interdependent.
An attempt by Pepsi to attract buyers (increase sales) through an advertising campaign will decrease the sales of Coke.
Coke may counter this advertising campaign with its own advertising or it may elect to take another competitive action such as a temporary reduction in the price of Coke.
How Coke chooses to react to Pepsi will be based on an analysis of how the (cid:28)rms have acted in past situations.
The industry’s competitive dynamics is the ongoing series of competitive actions and competitive responses that take place as Coke and Pepsi compete for customers.
Competitive intelligence is the systematic collection and analysis of publicly available information about competitors.
Intelligence about competitors is key to understanding the actions they are currently taking to attract buyers.
Competitive intelligence may also allow the (cid:28)rm to predict a competitor’s future actions and take measures to preempt or minimize the impact of those actions.
The objective of a (cid:28)rm’s competitive intelligence is to understand its competitors.
Exercise 11.3.1 It should be easy to envisage Coke and Pepsi as interdependent competing (cid:28)rms.
Can you come upwith(cid:28)vemoreexamplesofinterdependentcompeting(cid:28)rms,e.g.
HondaandToyota,Boeingand Airbus,... 11.3.1 Why you have competitors (or how buyers have managed to survive with- out your product and why you need buyers more than buyers need you) Entrepreneurscommonlyunderestimatetheimpactofcompetition.
Entrepreneurswhodounderestimatethe impact of competition are failing to consider the fact that potential buyers are currently managing without the entrepreneur’s product.
There are three arguments for why potential buyers are managing without the entrepreneur’s product or service: 1. parallel products exist in the market 2. reasonable substitutes exist in the market 3. parallel products and substitutes do not exist, but the public does not perceive, or is not aware, of the bene(cid:28)ts o(cid:27)ered by the entrepreneur’s product or service Parallelproductsarethosethatarefunctionallyinterchangeablewiththeentrepreneur’sproducts,butvary justenoughontheproduct’sperceivedbene(cid:28)tstoexistinthemarketplace.
Forexample,manycommunities haveareaswhereanumberofrestaurantsexistincloseproximitytooneanother.

Anentrepreneuropeninganewrestaurantinproximitytoexistingrestaurantsmaybeo(cid:27)eringaheretofore unavailable national cuisine, but the entrepreneur still has many competitors.
In this market of parallel competitors,theentrepreneurwillbesuccessfulonlyifbuyersperceivethatthenewrestauranto(cid:27)ersdesirable bene(cid:28)ts that are unavailable from existing restaurants.
The new restaurant must generate enough sales to generate a pro(cid:28)t. In reality, what often happens is that the new restaurant will initially generate a strong trade as buyers try the restaurant’s novel o(cid:27)erings.
However, in a few months the new restaurant will fail unless it has found the means of o(cid:27)ering a mix of perceived bene(cid:28)ts not available in competing restaurants.
This suggests that the entrepreneur must learn enough about what buyers or customers need or want and enough about how competitors are attempting to meet those needs, that the entrepreneur can o(cid:27)er enough perceived bene(cid:28)ts to keep customers returning inde(cid:28)nitely.
Learning about buyers and competitors is the role of competitive intelligence.
Substitutes often exist for the entrepreneur’s product.
Substitutes are products that (cid:28)ll the same function but originate in di(cid:27)erent industries.
Buyers may have a preference for a substitute due to the substitute’s greater perceived bene(cid:28)t. For example, the basic construction material for houses varies greatly onageographicbasis.
Woodhousingtendstobefavoredwherewoodisabundantandrelativelyinexpensive, and a similar argument can be made for the wood substitutes, brick and stone.
The entrepreneur is unlikely AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>213 to be more than marginally successful if s/he attempts to sell bricks where wood remains abundant and cheap.
S/hemaybemarginallysuccessfulbecausewoodhousingoftenhasbrick(cid:28)xturesandtrim.
However, inamarketwherewoodisbecomingmorecostlyduetoalackofabundance,brickmaybecomeanattractive substitute for wood.

It may appear that a complete lack of competition would be to the entrepreneur’s advantage, butthisisseldomthecase.
Inthoseinstanceswhere(cid:28)rmso(cid:27)eringsimilarproductscanbefound in other markets, the most likely explanation for a lack of competitors is a market that will not sustain the (cid:28)rm.
The market may be too small, or too seasonal, or the customer demographic may be skewed, etc.
The entrepreneur should proceed cautiously when a super(cid:28)cial inspection suggests a potential market lacking an establishedcompetitor.
Amorethoroughinvestigationwilloftenrevealfailedattemptstoestablishamarket for the product.
This investigation is one of the roles of competitive intelligence.
In the rare instance where the entrepreneur has discovered or invented a unique product, s/he typically faces a truly daunting task.
Potential buyers must be educated as to the existence and bene(cid:28)t of the new product.
Educating buyers and establishing a market for a new product is expensive.
Unfortunately for the entrepreneur, it is often the follow-on (cid:28)rms that are successful.
In the electronics industry, the originators of the personal computer, video game console, and personal data assistant provided the infrastructure for successful follow-on (cid:28)rms, but were unable to capitalize on their own innovative products.
Exercise 11.3.2 A business that faces both parallel products and substitutes is likely to have a di(cid:30)cult time in the marketplace.
Example of businesses that have both parallels and substitutes include grocery stores.
Parallels include grocery stores with slightly varying themes, warehouse stores, e.g.
Sam’s club and Costco, and natural food stores.
Substitutes include specialty food stores, e.g.
bakeries, dairy stores, and butcher shops; restaurants; and take-out shops.
Not surprisingly grocery store pro(cid:28)t margins are low.
What other businesses are characterized by competition that includes both parallel product and substitutes?
Is the average pro(cid:28)t margin for these businesses low, i.e.
< 5 per cent of sales?
11.4 Importance and goals of competitive intelligence4 11.4.1 Detecting competitive threats Detecting competitive threats is crucial to every business.
Microsoft has concerns with Google’s growing market share.
Ford attempts to avoid losing market shares to Toyota.
A local supermarket is concerned with another supermarket opening up in the area and taking its customers away.

Competitive intelligence is the purposeful and coordinated monitoring of competitors, wherever and whoever they may be, within a speci(cid:28)c marketplace.
Competitive intelligence allowsthe(cid:28)rmtomakeinformeddecisionsabouttheoutcomesofitsactionsinthemarketplace.
Forexample competitorA,throughthescanningofnewbuildingpermitsinthelocalnewspaper,discoversthatcompetitor B has taken out a permit for the construction of a new building on B’s property.
From this information, and other legal sources, competitor A may draw some conclusions as to the purpose of competitor B’s new building and take actions designed to minimize the impact of B’s new building.
The goal of competitive intelligence is to detect threats originating from competitors in all their forms.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE 11.4.2 Eliminating or lessening surprises A (cid:28)rm needs to closely monitor the actions of its competitors.
Detecting competitive threats early allows the (cid:28)rm to take actions to mitigate the threat.
Competitive threats may come from a number of di(cid:27)erent sources, including new entrants, substitutes, competitors, and even suppliers in the form of a price increase.
For example, if a local competitor is building a new retail outlet that will capitalize on the industry’s latest trends, the (cid:28)rm will have to decide whether to follow suit.
Perhaps a competitor has traditionally held a major sale on a particular holiday, the (cid:28)rm will need to decide whether to follow suit, or give up sales while its competitor holds the sale.
11.4.3 Enhancing competitive advantages by lessening reaction time A (cid:28)rm that has planned for most common threats will be prepared to move quickly in the face of a threat.
Preparedness allows the (cid:28)rm to move past its less well prepared competitors as they devote valuable time and other resources reacting to the threat.
While competitors are reacting, the (cid:28)rm can move to increase its competitive advantage over the competition.
For example, a trucking company might plan for an escalation in fuel prices.
The trucking company can do this in various ways, but the most common is to (cid:16)buy(cid:17) a contract that guarantees the (cid:28)rm the right to purchase fuel at a (cid:28)xed price for some speci(cid:28)ed period of time.
Should fuel prices increase during the period the contract is in e(cid:27)ect, the trucking (cid:28)rm is protected by its fuel contracts.
The fuel contracts in turn allow the trucking (cid:28)rm to honor existing quotations and contracts with its customers.
By honoring its quotations and contracts in the face of escalating fuel prices the trucking (cid:28)rm’s reputation and good will with its customers increases, furthering the trucking (cid:28)rm’s competitive advantage.
11.4.4 Finding new opportunities Ultimately, a(cid:28)rmmustbeabletogrowinordertosurviveinthebusinessworld.
Theabilitytogrowisonly limited by the imagination of the decision makers of the company.
New ideas turned into patents for new products, buying a competitor in order to increase market share and economies of scale, and establishing a sales force in a neighboring country are just a few of the ways that a company can continue to grow.
There are three principle avenues employed by businesses to develop new opportunities for growth.
1.
Find ways to increase the sales of existing products to existing customers.
Businesses can accomplish thisgoalby(cid:28)ndingnewapplicationsfortheuseofexistingproductsbycurrentcustomers.
Thisprocess is known as market penetration.
2.
Market developmentistheprocessof(cid:28)ndingnewcustomersforthe(cid:28)rm’sexistingproducts.
There are two choices for market development, the (cid:28)rm can look to new geographic markets or the (cid:28)rm can turntoanewdemographicmarket.
Forexample,a(cid:28)rmthatsoldexerciseequipmentthattraditionally targeted the 18-34 year-old male demographic might (cid:28)nd that they could sell the same equipment to a 16-32 year-old female demographic.
The only new cost the (cid:28)rm would incur is the cost of marketing existing products to the new demographic.
3.
Product development is the process of creating new products for customers.
Product development is often accomplished by asking customers what types of products would make their job easier.
Once a viable need is established, the (cid:28)rm can develop a product to meet that need.
Very few (cid:28)rms can a(cid:27)ord to stand still for long.
Competitors are constantly looking for opportunities and thoseopportunitiesmissedbyyour(cid:28)rm,willnotbemissedbyallyourcompetitors.
Complacencyintoday’s business environment will quickly lead to years of dedicated work being usurped by competitors.

The Internet permits access to information and data from a wide range of sources.
Often, there is simply too much data, and data of dubious quality.
When accessing data the entrepreneur needs to evaluate data on its timeliness, source, and relevance.
11.5.1 Internet Internet search engines make it possible to quickly access information on seemingly any subject.
Unfor- tunately, because anyone can establish and then fail to maintain a website, Internet data is often dated, unreliable, and of dubious value.
This places a burden on the entrepreneur to check Internet data carefully before using it.
Nonetheless, there is much useful information to be found on the Internet at government, organization, and corporate websites.
The information from these sources generally consists of reliable facts and (cid:28)gures.
Frequently, these facts and (cid:28)gures will need to be manipulated by the entrepreneur in order to be rendered in a useful form.

consumer organizations,magazines,commercialsellers,andblogs.
However,thequali(cid:28)cationsandimpartialityofthird party raters may be questionable.
The entrepreneur should not rely on a single source for product reviews and exercise due diligence by checking multiple sources for product ratings.
The entrepreneur should bear in mind that his/her (cid:28)rm and products will eventually be rated on the Internet and check to see that the (cid:28)rm’s rating is favorable.
11.5.2 Human intelligence Humanintelligencecanyieldthemosttimelyandaccurateinformation, butitisthemostresourceintensive form of information to collect.
Human intelligence often tends to take the form of opinion rather than the facts and (cid:28)gures found in documents.
This leaves the entrepreneur in the position of evaluating the veracity of opinions.
Like product reviews, which can also be a matter of opinion, the entrepreneur should rely on multiple sources.
The entrepreneur’s network should be the source of his/her human intelligence.
The network can be augmented by introductions from network members to others closer to the information objective.
Participants in trade shows and trade organizations are excellent sources of information as are suppliers, customers, and employees.
11.5.3 Fee based companies Fee based companies, such as Hoovers, LexisNexis, and the credit reporting companies are in the business of collecting and compiling information on businesses and individuals.
Their revenue is earned through the sale of the information they collect.
For the most part, they make no attempt to assess the speci(cid:28)c validity of the information they sell.
Rather, they tend to rely on the fact that on average, their information is quitereliable.
Theoveralltrendforfeebasedinformationisthatreliabilitytendstoincreasewithprice.
Fee basedcompaniescanbeausefulsourceofinformationoncompetitorsthatmightnotbeotherwiseavailable.
For example, credit reports are available for competing (cid:28)rms and credit reports can yield a good deal of information about a (cid:28)rm’s (cid:28)nancial condition.
11.5.4 Public documents Publicdocumentscanbeanexcellentsourceofinformationoncompetitors.
Manytypesofpublicdocuments are available over the Internet, while others may only be available at records o(cid:30)ces.
For example, building permits are typically reported in newspapers and can often be accessed online, while building plans are usually available only through a visit to the public planning o(cid:30)ce.
A visit to the planning o(cid:30)ce may be 5Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35538/1.4/>.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE warranted if a competitor is building a new plant.
The plans will yield a good deal about the project from which a knowledgeable competitor can deduce plant and warehouse capacity.
Similarly, the annual report that a public company (cid:28)les with the government is another example of a document that may yield a good deal of information about a competitor.
There are a number of organizations that are concerned with the collection and use of competitive data.
Internet sites with a focus on competitive intelligence include: 6 http://cio.com/ 7 http://www.scip.org/ 8 http://www.brint.com/ 9 http://fuld.com/ Exercise 11.5.1 Select a publicly traded company of interest to you.
Using the Internet as an access point, (cid:28)nd the following for the previous year: (1) annual sales, (2) pro(cid:28)ts as a percentage of sales, e.g.
pro(cid:28)ts/sales, (3) number of employees, (4) sales per employee, e.g.
sales/employees, and (5) best selling product or service.
11.6 The industry environment10 11.6.1 What is an industry?
The term industry loosely refers to any group of businesses that share a particular type of commercial enterprise.
This grouping of (cid:28)rms is also likely to generate pro(cid:28)ts in a similar manner, or at least share related activities.
In the business world, it is common to hear managers discuss particular industries as a whole, for example, ‘the automobile industry’ or ‘the magazine industry’.
In a more formal sense, the North American Industry Classi(cid:28)cation System (NAICS, 11 http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html ) de(cid:28)nes hundreds of di(cid:27)erent industries.
The NAICS is a commonly used system to group businesses.
The NAICS typically identi(cid:28)es an in- dustry with a six digit code, with each additional digit narrowing the de(cid:28)nition of the industry.
Similar classi(cid:28)cation systems include the International Standard Industrial Classi(cid:28)cation (ISIC, 12 http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=17 ) from the United Nations and the Gen- eral Industrial Classi(cid:28)cation of Economic Activities with the European Communities (NACE, 13 http://www.ltck.se/PrjY1/nacekod/nacecode.htm ).
Data is gathered and reported for the indus- try based on the six digit code.
Data typically reported includes demographic measures for the industry including employment, number of business, and total sales.
Data is not reported for individual (cid:28)rms.
Many di(cid:27)erent agencies and businesses use these categories for statistical studies, business comparisons, and benchmarks.
Locating the industry for a business through the NAICS or similar classi(cid:28)cation scheme can be a useful exercise in gathering competitive intelligence.
For example, the average number of employees and sales of (cid:28)rms in the industry can be found and from this information critical benchmarks like sales per employee may be calculated.

Industry structure includes size measures, e.g.
industry sales, number of (cid:28)rms, and number of employees.
Rate of growth and the industry growth curve are an important element of industry structure as is the extent to which an industry is unionized.
There may be many more elements of industry structure.
Industry structure is one determinant of competition.
For example, competition in an industry comprised solely of union employers will be quite di(cid:27)erent than in an industry comprised of both union and non-union (cid:28)rms.
Competition is also a(cid:27)ected by the extent to which the government is a large buyer, or perhaps the only buyer, as in the defense industry.
11.6.3 Concept of strategic groups Strategic groups exist within most industries.
A strategic group is a set of (cid:28)rms within an industry that employ similar practices in order to achieve comparable goals.
An example of a strategic group within the food service industry would be fast-food chains.
The fast-food chains di(cid:27)erentiate themselves from other restaurants by o(cid:27)ering quick-service, popular foods, and relatively low prices.
Within the same industry we can (cid:28)nd a number of other strategic groups such as family restaurants, vegetarian restaurants, and co(cid:27)ee houses.
Although fast-food chains and vegetarian restaurants both accomplish the same purpose, i.e.
providing a prepared meal, their target audience, their methods of marketing, and other methods of doing business are decidedly di(cid:27)erent.
Competition between (cid:28)rms within a strategic group is more direct than competition between (cid:28)rms located in di(cid:27)erent strategic groups.
Competitive rivalry amongst (cid:28)rms in the same strategic group can be very intense, especially since they are usually competing for the same customers.
Consider Pepsi and Coca-Cola versus fruit juice.
Pepsi and Coca-Cola are competing for cola drinkers, and they market their products competitively against each other.
Although the customer could just as easily have a glass of fruit juice, Pepsi and Coca-Cola are not aggressively marketing against the juice industry.
The fruit juice customer has di(cid:27)erent wants and needs than the cola customer, so the two strategic groups do not compete directly for the same clientele.
11.6.4 Key success factors in an industry Key success factors (KSF)areareasofcriticalperformancenecessaryforsuccessinaspeci(cid:28)cindustry.
A (cid:28)rm cannot expect to be competitive in its industry without an understanding of the industry’s key success factors.
Key success factors are a function of both customer needs and competitive pressures.
KSFs are typically identi(cid:28)ed by completing a list in response to two questions: 1.
What do customers in my industry want?
2.
How do successful (cid:28)rms survive the industry’s competitive pressures?

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE The entrepreneur must be aware of the key success factors (KSF) in his/her industry.
Resources should be directed to activities that increase competitiveness on KSF and not wasted on activities that are not critical to KSFs.
Exercise 11.6.1 Since we all have decided preferences, it follows that a table of KSFs constructed by one person is likely to omit, or overstate, an industry’s KSFs.
Select a common type of business-industry with which you have some familiarity, e.g.
(cid:29)oral arrangements, co(cid:27)ee house, or bicycle sales.
Exercise 11.6.2 Construct a table of Key Success Factors by asking yourself the questions: What do customers in my business-industry want?
How do successful (cid:28)rms survive the industry’s competitive pressures?
Exercise 11.6.3 Now ask the questions of two other people who have been customers of the business-industry.
Are you getting agreement on your list of KSFs, or will you need to ask more people for their opinions to establish a clear list of KSFs?
11.7 Porter’s 5 forces and the analysis of competitors14 Porter’s (cid:28)ve forces, (cid:28)rst covered in Chapter 3 as a methodology for assessing industry attractiveness, plays an important role in competitor analysis.
The (cid:28)ve forces perspective of competitor analysis views each force as a determinant of the level of competition in the industry.
The level of competition in turn determines the (cid:28)rm’s ability to operate pro(cid:28)tably in the industry.
11.7.1 Bargaining power of buyers A (cid:28)rm’s buyers or customers have varying needs and wants.
Meeting customers’ needs represents a cost to the (cid:28)rm.
When the (cid:28)rm can easily meet the customer’s needs the (cid:28)rm’s cost is relatively low.
Because the (cid:28)rm can easily give the customer what he/she values, the (cid:28)rm is in a strong bargaining position and sales are likely to generate healthy pro(cid:28)ts.
When the customer’s needs are not easily met, the cost to the (cid:28)rm increases.
Because the (cid:28)rm’s product is less attractive to the customer, the (cid:28)rm must lower prices or take other steps to entice the customer to make a purchase.
Under these conditions the (cid:28)rm’s pro(cid:28)ts are likely to be low.
Consequently, the (cid:28)rm can be seen as always bargaining with customers for the (cid:28)rm’s potential pro(cid:28)ts.
The (cid:28)rm is in the strongest bargaining position when it understands its buyer’s needs.
Understandingbuyerneedsistheroleofmarketingandmaybeviewedasaformofcompetitiveintelligence.
Buyers are in a particularly strong bargaining position when they can easily switch from the (cid:28)rm’s product to a competitor’s equivalent product.
For example, a (cid:28)rm that has many competitors o(cid:27)ering a similar product will have customers with signi(cid:28)cant bargaining power.
If the customer is not happy with the product o(cid:27)ered by one (cid:28)rm, they can simply choose to go to another (cid:28)rm that provides the same item.
For this to be a powerful bargaining tool for the customer, the switch from one (cid:28)rm to another must be cost-e(cid:30)cient and easy.
Conversely, if a (cid:28)rm has desirable products and competing products are perceived as less desirable, customers will have reduced bargaining power.
If it is expensive or burdensome to switch products, customers will also lose bargaining power.
A good example of a (cid:28)rm in this coveted position is Apple with their iPod product.
While other MP3 players are on the market, none have the market share and desirability enjoyed by iPod.
Customers almost always have choices and they will vote for their chosen (cid:28)rms with their purchases.
Customers will vote against (cid:28)rms by simply walking away.
It is important to balance the needs of the customer with the goals of the (cid:28)rm.

Supplierswanttochargethe(cid:28)rmmoreforinputs and the (cid:28)rm wants to pay the supplier less for those same inputs.
Consequently, competitive intelligence extendstosuppliersanditisinthe(cid:28)rm’sinteresttoknowasmuchaspossibleabouttheirsuppliers.
Suppliers may o(cid:27)er exclusive territories, (cid:28)nancing, advertising, display, and other incentives to the (cid:28)rm to encourage the use or sale of the supplier’s product.
The (cid:28)rm should evaluate and select its suppliers carefully in order to take full advantage of any and all cost savings o(cid:27)ered by suppliers.
In many industries it is common for buyers to form cooperatives in order to increase their bargaining power relative to suppliers.
The cooperative, sometimes comprised of hundreds of smaller (cid:28)rms, is able to use its combined buying power to bargain with suppliers for better prices and terms.
For example, in North America, buyer cooperatives are quite visible in the retail hardware industry as represented by the (cid:16)Ace(cid:17),(cid:16)HardwareHank(cid:17),and(cid:16)TrueValue(cid:17) hardwarestores.
Despitethepotentiallyantagonisticrelationship between the (cid:28)rm and its suppliers, suppliers often o(cid:27)er bene(cid:28)ts that can improve the (cid:28)rm’s competitive position in the industry.
11.7.3 Threat of new entrants Entrepreneurs represent the threat of a new competitor for existing businesses.
It is normally in the interest of existing (cid:28)rms to prevent new competitors from becoming established.
Consequently, it is in the best interest of the entrepreneur to learn as much as possible about existing competitive businesses so that the entrepreneur can target their weaknesses.
The entrepreneur should also attempt to learn enough about existing businesses so that he/she can anticipate and attempt to minimize the retaliation from existing businesses.
Retaliation may take many forms from political actions designed to delay or prevent the new business from opening to deep price cuts intended to force the new business out of the market.
11.7.4 Threat of substitute products Entrepreneursoftenseemunawareofthecompetitivethreatposedbysubstituteproducts.
Oneofthereasons entrepreneurs may be unaware of substitute products is that by de(cid:28)nition, substitutes come from another industry.
Despite all the potential warnings, the retail and recorded music industries were hardly prepared for the consequences when millions of customers switched from CD purchases to downloaded iTunes.
Thus, the entrepreneur needs to monitor not only his/her own industry for potential competitors, but also must scan other industries that pose a potential threat.
11.7.5 The intensity of competitive rivalry The intensity of the rivalry amongst the (cid:28)rms in a given industry will have an e(cid:27)ect on the pro(cid:28)ts of all (cid:28)rms within that industry.
Within an industry, when (cid:28)rms are (cid:28)ercely competitive, the cost of competition will increase because when one (cid:28)rm acts, other (cid:28)rms will feel the need to counteract.
Costs for advertising and promotions, pro(cid:28)ts lost through price reductions, and competitive rivalries occurring over the research and development of new products will erode the pro(cid:28)ts of competing (cid:28)rms.
The (cid:28)rms within an industry are likely to be plagued by similar problems.
One common problem that entrepreneursprefertoavoidisassociatedwithindustrieswithhigh(cid:28)xedcosts.
High(cid:28)xedcostsarecommon inmanufacturing,communications,andtransportationindustries.
Whenaproductisencumberedbyahigh (cid:28)xed cost, the (cid:28)rm will usually make every e(cid:27)ort to recover at least a portion of those (cid:28)xed costs and may resort to o(cid:27)ering buyers a range of incentives, from drastic price cuts to rebates, to move the product.
Theseincentivesareoftenmetwithaswiftcompetitiveresponseonthepartofindustrycompetitors.
These competitive actions can drive all pro(cid:28)ts out of the industry.
A problem accompanying, or similar, to high (cid:28)xed costs can be found in mature industries.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE industry are competing for the same pool of buyers and often that pool of buyers is in decline.
Again, the competitive actions taken by (cid:28)rms to attract this pool of buyers will drive pro(cid:28)ts out of the industry.

Forexample,fewconsumersseethedi(cid:27)erencebetweenvariousbrandsofketchupandare likely to simply purchase the brand that has the lower price.
When consumers see little di(cid:27)erence between products within an industry, these products become known as commodities.

Theentrepreneurneedstostudy and understand the industry and if possible, avoid industries where the level of competition is high as this means the pro(cid:28)t potential is low.
Still, the entrepreneur may identify an under served niche or a need that the entrepreneur is uniquely quali(cid:28)ed to (cid:28)ll, in which case entry into the industry may be pro(cid:28)table for the entrepreneur.

11.8 Methods of evaluating competitors15 11.8.1 Identifying competitors and their relative advantage An understanding of the industry and the key success factors for the industry allows the entrepreneur to assess the performance of competitive (cid:28)rms.
The process starts with the identi(cid:28)cation of competitors.
In many markets competitors will already be known to the entrepreneur.
In other markets, the numbers and identities of competitors may be less obvious.
Operating under the assumption that the vast majority of businessesneedtocommunicatewiththepublic,thebestplacetostartwithcompetitoridenti(cid:28)cationiswith directoriesandothero(cid:30)cialandsemi-o(cid:30)ciallistings.
Inmanycountries,andformostmarkets,thebusiness telephone directory should be the starting point.
City and other directories contain additional information on competitors, including ownership, key employees, and the number of employees.
Some products will warrant an Internet search as competition may prove to be regional, national, or even international.
After assembling a list of competitors the entrepreneur should develop a method for collecting information on his/her most immediate competitors, i.e.
those competitors who will be competing for the same customers.
For smaller businesses, simply creating a (cid:28)le folder for each immediate competitor should be su(cid:30)cient.
The entrepreneur will need to collect more detailed information on his/her most immediate competitors.
The entrepreneur should be parsimonious in his/her approach to collecting information and one means of beingparsimoniousistofocusoninformationrelatedtotheindustry’skeysuccessfactors(KSF).Competitor information may come from a wide range of sources including visits to the competitor’s place of operation, word-of-mouth from suppliers and other third parties, competitor’s advertisements, newspaper archives, Internet searches, and public records.
Since the best indicator of future performance is past performance, the entrepreneur should pay close attention to the longevity and historical performance of competitors.
Havingcollectedinformation,theentrepreneurisinapositiontomakecomparisonsbetweenhis/her(cid:28)rm and the (cid:28)rm’s immediate competitors.
A spreadsheet or table is commonly employed for this assessment.
Relevant information beyond key success factors is commonly included in the comparison and may include size measures, reputation, age, largest customers, key suppliers, and almost anything else deemed relevant to the competitive environment.

Theoretical Ethics, sometimes called Normative Ethics, is about discovering and delineating right from wrong; it is the consideration of how we develop the rules and principles (norms) by which to judge and guide meaningful decision-making.
TheoreticalEthicsissupremelyintellectualincharacter,and,beingabranchofphilosophy, is also rational in nature.
Theoretical Ethics is the rational re(cid:29)ection on what is right, what is wrong, what is just, what is unjust, what is good and what is bad in terms of human behavior.

Thoughre(cid:29)ectiveandrationalinpart,thisisonlya preludetotheessentialtaskbehindbusinessethics.
Itisbestunderstoodasabranchofethicscalledapplied ethics: the discipline of applying value to human behavior, relationships and constructs, and the resulting meaning.
Business ethics is simply the practice of this discipline within the context of the enterprise of creating wealth (the fundamental role of business).
There are three parts to the discipline of business ethics: personal, professional and corporate.
All three are intricately related, and it is helpful to distinguish between them because each rests on slightly di(cid:27)erent assumptions and requires a slightly di(cid:27)erent focus in order to be understood.
We are looking at business ethics through a trifocal lens: close up and personal, intermediate and professional, and on the grand scale (utilizing both farsighted and peripheral vision) of the corporation.
In spite of some recent bad press, business executives are (cid:28)rst and foremost human beings.
Like all persons, they seek meaning for their lives through relationships and enterprise, and they want their lives to amount to something.
Since ethics is chie(cid:29)y the discipline of meaning, the business executive, like all other humanbeings,isengagedinthisdisciplineallthetime,whethercognizantofitornot.
Therefore,weshould begin by looking at how humans have historically approached the process of making meaningful decisions.
Here are four ethical approaches that have stood the test of time.
12.1.1 Personal ethics: four ethical approaches From the earliest moments of recorded human consciousness, the ethical discipline has entailed four fun- damental approaches, often called ethical decision-making frameworks: Utilitarian Ethics (outcome based), Deontological Ethics (duty based), Virtue Ethics (virtue based), and Communitarian Ethics (community based).
Eachhasadistinctivepointofdepartureaswellasdistinctivewaysofdoingthefundamentalethical task of raising and answering questions of value.
It is also important to understand that all four approaches have overlaps as well as common elements, such as: • Impartiality: weighting interests equally 1Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35560/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4> 223224 CHAPTER 12. BUSINESS ETHICS IN A NUTSHELL • Rationality: backed by reasons a rational person would accept • Consistency: standards applied similarly to similar cases • Reversibility: standards that apply no matter who "makes" the rules These are in a sense the rules of the ethics game, no matter with which school or approach to ethics one feels most closely to identity.
The Utilitarian approach is perhaps the most familiar and easiest to understand of all approaches to ethics.
Whetherwethinkaboutitornot,mostofusaredoingutilitarianethicsmuchofthetime,especially thoseofusinbusiness.
TheUtilitarianasksaveryimportantquestion: "Howwillmyactionsa(cid:27)ectothers?"
They then attempt to quantify the impact of their actions based on some least common denominator, such as happiness, pleasure, or wealth.
Therefore, Utilitarians are also called (cid:16)consequentialists(cid:17), because they look to the consequences of their actions to determine whether any particular act is justi(cid:28)ed.
"Thegreatestgoodforthegreatestnumber"isthemottooftheUtilitarianapproach.
Ofcourse,de(cid:28)ning "good" has been no easy task because what some people think of as good, others think of as worthless.
When a businessperson does a cost bene(cid:28)t analysis, he/she is practicing Utilitarian ethics.
In this case, the least common denominator is usually money.
Everything from the cost of steel to the worth of a human life must be given a dollar value, and then one just does the math.
The Ford Pinto automobile was a product of just such reasoning.
Thirty years ago, executives at the Ford Motor Company reasoned the cost of (cid:28)xing thegas-tankproblemwiththeirPintowouldcostmorethanthebene(cid:28)tofsavingafewhumanlives.
Several tanks did explode, people died, and the company lost lawsuits when judge and juries refused to accept these executives’ moral reasoning.
One of the most familiar uses of outcome-based reasoning is in legislative committees in representative democracies.
How many constituents will bene(cid:28)t from a tax credit and how many will be diminished is the question before the Revenue Committee at tax recti(cid:28)cation time.
Representative democracies make most decisions based on the Utilitarian principle of the greatest good for the greatest number.
Democratic governments are naturally majoritarian, though in constitutional democracies there are some things that cannot be decided by doing the math (adding up the votes).
Some questions should never be voted on.
The founders of our nation expressed this fundamental concept with three words: certain unalienable rights.
Enter the Deontological Ethicists.
Immanuel Kant is the quintessential deontological (duty based) ethical theorist.
Kant, who lived in eighteenth century Prussia, was one of the most amazing intellects of all time, writing books on astronomy, philosophy, politics and ethics.
He once said, (cid:16)Two things (cid:28)ll the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe ... the starry heavens above and the moral law within.
(cid:17) For Kant there were some ethical verities as eternal as the stars.
Deontological simply means the study (or science) of duty.
Kant did not believe that humans could predict future consequences with any substantial degree of certainty.
Ethical theory based on a guess about future consequences appalled him.
What he did believe was that if we use our facility of reason, we can determine with certainty our ethical duty.
As to whether or not doing our duty would make things better or worse (and for whom), Kant was agnostic.
Duty-based ethics is enormously important for (though consistently ignored by) at least two kinds of folks: politicians and business people.
It is also the key to a better understanding of our responsibilities as members of teams.
Teams (like work groups or political campaign committees) are narrowly focused on achievingveryclearlyde(cid:28)nedgoals: winningtheelection,successfullyintroducinganewproduct,orwinning asailboatrace.
Sometimesacoachorabosswillsay,(cid:16)Look,justdowhateverittakes.
(cid:17) Ethically,(cid:16)whatever it takes(cid:17), means the ends justify the means.
This was Kant’s fundamental criticism of the Utilitarians.
For Kant, there were some values (duties) that could never be sacri(cid:28)ced to the greater good.
He wrote: (cid:16)So act as to treat humanity, whether in thy own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as a means only.
(cid:17) Fellow team members, employees, campaign sta(cid:27)s, customers, partners, etc.
are always to some extent means to our various goals (ends), but they are also persons.
And persons, Kant believed, cannot be just used, they must also be respected in their own right, whether or not the goal is achieved.
He called this absolute respect for persons a Categorical Imperative.
In any team situation the goal is critical, but treating team members with respect is imperative.
Teams fall apart when a team member feels used or abused (treated as less important than the overall goal itself).

Persons are never merely a means to an end.
They are ends in themselves!
We owe that understanding to Immanuel Kant.
It is one thing to understand that there are duties which do not depend on consequences; it is quite another to develop the character to act on those duties.
This is where Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)
comes in.
Aristotle wrote the (cid:28)rst systematic treatment of ethics in Western Civilization: Nicomachean Ethics.
Today we call his approach to ethics virtue ethics.
For Aristotle and other Greek thinkers, virtue meant the excellence of a thing.
The virtue of a knife is to cut; the virtue of a physician is to heal; the virtueofalawyeristoseekjustice.
Inthissense,Ethicsbecomesthedisciplineofdiscoveringandpracticing virtue.
Aristotlebeginshisthinkingaboutethicsbyasking,(cid:16)Whatdopeopledesire?
(cid:17) Hediscoverstheusual things(cid:22) wealth, honor, physical and psychological security(cid:22)but he realizes that these things are not ends in themselves; they are means to ends.
The ultimate end for a person, Aristotle taught, must be an end that is self-su(cid:30)cient, (cid:16)that which is always desirable in itself and never for the sake of something else(cid:17).
This end of ends Aristotle designates with the Greek word eudemonia, usually translated by the English word happiness.
But happiness does not do Aristotle or his ethics justice.
Yes, eudemonia means happiness, but really it means so much more.
The problem is not with Aristotle’s Greek word eudemonia, the problem is in our English word happiness.
Happiness in English comes from the ancient word hap, meaning chance, as in happenstance.
(cid:16)Why are you smiling(cid:17), we ask, (cid:16)did you win the lottery?
(cid:17) For Aristotle happiness was not something one acquired by chance.
Happiness was the grand work of living; the very practice of being all that you can be.
Ful(cid:28)llment and (cid:29)ourishing are far better words to translate the concept contained in the Greek word eudemonia.
For Aristotle, this state of virtue is achieved not by accident but through intent, reason and practice.
Aristotle thought that one discovers virtue by using the unique gift of human reasoning, that is, through rational contemplation.
(cid:16)The unexamined life is not worth living,(cid:17) said Socrates almost 100 years before Aristotle.
Like Aristotle and Aristotle’s teacher Plato, Socrates knew that we humans need to engage our brains before we open our mouths or spring into some decisive action.
For Aristotle, the focus of that brain work was chie(cid:29)y about how to balance between the fears and excesses in which the human condition always abounds.
Between our fears (de(cid:28)cits) and exuberances (excesses) lies a sweet spot, the golden mean, called virtue.
Attimesofphysicalperil(cid:22)sayinabigstormonasmallsailboat(cid:22)acrewmembermaybeimmobilizedby fearandunabletofunction,thusputtingthelivesofeveryoneonthesailboatindanger.
Ortheoppositecould happen.
A devil-may-care attitude in the face of real danger can as easily lead to disaster.
Courage is the virtuelocatedatthemeanbetweencowardlinessandrashness.
Yet,identifyingsuchavirtueandmakingthat virtuepartofone’scharacteraretwoquietdi(cid:27)erentthings.
Aristotlethusdistinguishesbetweenintellectual virtue and practical virtue.
Practical virtues are those developed by practice and are a part of a person’s character, while intellectual virtue is simply the identi(cid:28)cation and understanding of a virtue.
Practice is how one learns to deal with fear; practice is how one learns to tell the truth; practice is how one learns to face both personal and professional con(cid:29)icts.
Practice is the genius of Aristotle’s contribution tothedevelopmentofethics.

Instead, virtuesbecomecharacteristicsofourselvesbyourexercising them.
How does one learn to be brave in a storm at sea?
(cid:16)Just do it.
(cid:17) The ultimate goal behind developing characteristics of virtue is eudemonia, a full (cid:29)ourishing of our self, true happiness.
Practitioners of the Judaic-Christian tradition tend to think of ethics (or morality) as the businessof(cid:28)guringouthowtobegoodratherthanbad.
ThatisnotthetrueendofethicssofarasAristotle was concerned.
The end is a state of ful(cid:28)llment; the ultimate goal is becoming who you truly are and realizing the potential you were born with(cid:22)being at your best in every sense.
Just as the virtue of the knife is to cut and the virtue of the boat is to sail, the virtue of the self is to become the best of who it can be.
This is happiness (eudemonia).
Just as the well-trained athlete seeks to be in the zone (the state of perfect performance achieved by practice), Aristotle wrote about the truly virtuous life and the pursuit of eudemonia.
Just as a perfectly trimmed sailboat glides through the water, e(cid:27)ortlessly in synch with the waves and the wind, the man or woman in a state of eudemonia has achieved AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>226 CHAPTER 12. BUSINESS ETHICS IN A NUTSHELL the state of earthly ful(cid:28)llment.
All three approaches to ethics described above are principally focused on the individual: the singular conscience,rationallyre(cid:29)ectingonthemeaningofdutyorresponsibility,andinthecaseofVirtueethics,the ethical athlete practicing and inculcating the capacity to achieve the state of eudemonia.
Communitarian Ethics has quite a di(cid:27)erent point of departure: the community (or team, or group, or company, or culture) within which the individual engages him/herself is the critical context for ethical decision-making.
The Communitarian asks the important question, "What are the demands (duties) that the commu- nity(ies) of which I am a part make on me?"
The Scottish ethicists W. D. Ross (himself a student of Aristotle) focused his own ethical re(cid:29)ections on the question of, "Where do ethical duties come from?"
His answer was that they come from relationships.
We know our duties toward fellow human beings by the nature and quality of our relationships with them.
The duties we owe a colleague in the workplace is dif- ferent from the duties we owe a spouse; those duties are di(cid:27)erent from the duties we owe our country.
The Communitarian asks us to look outward, and to face up to the duties of being social creatures.
We de(cid:28)ne ourselves, and our responsibilities, by the company we keep.
Communitarians are quite critical today of the attitude of so many in our society who, while adamant about their individual rights, are negligent of their social duties.
The (cid:16)me generation(cid:17) has created a need for a new breed of ethicists who insist that, from family and neighborhood to nation and global ecosys- tem, the communities in which we live require us to accept substantial responsibilities.
Environmentalists, neighborhood activists, feminists, and globalists are some of the groups loosely identi(cid:28)ed today with the Communitarian Movement.
Amitai Etzioni, in Spirit of Community: Rights, Responsibilities and the Communitarian Agenda de- scribed the principles of this somewhat disorganized movement.
Etizioni’s thesis is that we must pay more attention to common duties as opposed to individual rights.
Our neighborhoods, he believes, can again be safefromcrimewithoutturningourcountryintoapolicestate.
Ourfamiliescanonceagain(cid:29)ourishwithout forcing women to stay home and not enter the workforce.
Our schools can provide, "essential moral edu- cation" without indoctrinating young people or violating the First Amendment’s prohibition of establishing religion.
Thekeytothissocialtransformationisthecommunitarianbeliefinbalancingrightsandresponsibilities: "Strong rights presume strong responsibilities."
Etzioni states the Communitarian Agenda: Correctingthecurrentimbalancebetweenrightsandresponsibilitiesrequiresafour-pointagenda: a moratorium on the minting of most, if not all, new rights; reestablishing the link between rights and responsibilities; recognizing that some responsibilities do not entail rights; and, most carefully, adjusting some rights to the changed circumstances.
Here, if nothing else, is a frontal attack on the Libertarian mindset of our age.
Communitarianism is not new, at least if one de(cid:28)nes it as an approach to ethics and value referencing signi(cid:28)cant communities of meaning.
Most of the world’s great religions are in this sense communitarian.
It is from a community of faith that the faithful develops a sense of self and responsibility (or in Confucian thought, the extended family which nurtures this development).
Ethics cannot be separated from the ethos ofthereligiousorfamilialcommunity.
Themoderncommunitarianmovementmayormaynotbereligiously inclined, yet it is clearly a part of a tradition of ethical approach as old as human association.
In the context of teams, the communitarian approach to ethics has much to commend itself.
How much of one’s personal agenda is one willing to sacri(cid:28)ce for the overall goal of winning a sailboat race?
Under what conditions is one willing to let the values or culture of the team alter one’s own ethical inclinations?
To what extent do the relationships one has with team members give rise to duties that one is willing to honor?
How willing is one to share the credit when the team succeeds?
How willing is one to accept blame whentheteamlooses?
Underwhatconditionswouldonebreakwiththeteam?
IfRossiscorrectthatduties come from relationships, paying attention to such questions about the company we keep may be more than a social obligation; perhaps, our ethical duty.
There are two pervasive ethical approaches not treated here: ethical egoism and The Divine Imperative.
Each has a broad and dedicated following and each is deeply problematic to the ethical maturing of any AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>227 society.
Brie(cid:29)y, and with pejorative intent, here is what these extreme, yet interestingly similar approaches assert.
The ethical egoists say that ethics is a matter of doing what feels right to the individual conscience.
If one asks, "Why did you do that?"
The answer is, "Because I felt like it."
The approach is often dressed up with statements about being true to yourself: "let your conscience be your guide", or "do the right thing".
But how does one know what is true for the self?
How does one develop a conscience?
How is one to know that doing what is right (what feels right to you) is the right thing to do?

(cid:17) JustasthereisnopossiblemeaningfulethicaldialoguewiththeEthicalEgoist,noristheremuchhopeof creative engagement with Divine Imperialists.
For this growing community, ethics is the simple business of doing what God tells one to do.
There is therefore no reason or need for discussion.
The issue is conversion, not conversation.
In a constitutional democracy like ours with a fundamental commitment to "the non- establishmentofreligion", theDivineImperialistisstuckwithadi(cid:30)cultdilemma: eithertomakeallethical inquiry "personal" (that is, no social or political value deliberation), or take the ayatollah approach and bring no state into conformity with the revealed will of God.
Divine Imperialists do not deliberate.
They dictate, simply because there is nothing to deliberate about.
God has spoken.
It is in the book.
The (cid:29)aw in the Divine Imperialists’ approach is quite clear to everybody but them: If God is good, then He must reveal only good laws and rules.
This creates two alternatives.
The (cid:28)rst is that there is a reference for "good" apart from the Divine itself.
The only other, that God is undependable; that God is arbitrary; surelythisisunacceptable.
Godisnotonlygood,butGodwillsthegood.
God’swill,then,becomesareality discoverable even apart from belief in a particular represented manifestation of God.
Religion, at its best, should understand that faith confers no special status of ethical insight.

That is why democracies (as opposed to states founded upon some "Divine Right of Kings") survive.
A Postscript on Narrative Ethics.
Among the professions, particularly medicine, law and counseling, narrative has become a powerful tool in developing ethical insights and perspective.
To tell a story is to invite participation from the hearer, and itis to also a means of communicating therichness andcomplexity of human dilemmas.
Narrative Ethics is simply diagnosis through story.
Its bene(cid:28)t over the four traditional ethical approaches is that story invites both ethical engagement and ethical creativity.
In business, as in law, a great deal of teaching is done through the use of cases.
This is nothing more or less than using the pedagogy of narrative ethics.
The narrative invites the hearer into the complexity of issues involved in personal, professional and organizational dilemmas, and provides a road through the complexity to the simplicity on the other side.
OliverWendellHolmes,anAmericanjuristwhowrotestunninglycomprehensibledecisions,eveninsome of the most complex cases imaginable, has a famous quote: (cid:16)I would not give a (cid:28)g for simplicity this side of complexity,butIwouldgivemylifeforthesimplicitythatliesontheothersideofcomplexity.
(cid:17) Itistherole ofnarrativetoleadusthroughthethicketsofoverwhelmingcomplexity, totheclarityofenrichedsimplicity.
Of course, there are some people who congenitally can not stop to ask for directions when lost in life’s thickets.
For them, storytelling is a waste of time.
The male mantra, (cid:16)just cut to the chase(cid:17) comes to mind.
This may in part explain why women (feminist like Margaret Wheatley, for example) have such a fondness for narrative.
At all stages of the ethical decision-making process, narrative is a useful tool of analysis for exposing the facts, con(cid:29)icts, feelings, and values that are the stu(cid:27) of the human predicament.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>228 CHAPTER 12. BUSINESS ETHICS IN A NUTSHELL 12.2 Management: the meta profession2 In 1912 Louis D Brandeis addressed the graduating students of Brown University.
Tradition dictated that the graduating class was divided between those receiving learned degrees in the professions of law, medicine and ministry from those in the skill based disciplines, such as business management.
The future Supreme Court justice did an interesting thing that graduation day: he turned away from the professional degree candidates toward the business degree candidates, and said: Eachcommencementseasonwearetoldbythecollegereportsthenumberofgraduateswhohaveselected theprofessionsastheiroccupationsandthenumberofthosewhowillenterbusiness.
Thetimehascomefor abandoning such a classi(cid:28)cation.
Business should be, and to some extent already is, one of the professions.
Brandeis minced no words in de(cid:28)ning what professionalism was all about.
It was: An occupation for which the necessary preliminary training is intellectual in character, involving knowledgeandtosomeextentlearning,asdistinguishedfrommereskill;whichispursuedlargely forothers,andnotmerelyforone’sownself;andinwhichthe(cid:28)nancialreturnisnottheaccepted measure of success.
Spoken to clergy, physicians and lawyers in 1911, these words would have had a familiar(cid:22)if unheeded(cid:22) ring.
But to businessmen?
Brandeis’ intuition about the decisive character of business management for human welfare has been borne out across the tortured years of this past century.
His argument, however, that business management was essentially professional in character is debated still.
The three characteristics of professionalism cited by Brandeis address detail the nature of the requisite responsibility, and are the crux of why it is still controversial to call business management a profession: • First.
A profession is an occupation for which the necessary preliminary training is intellectual in character, involving knowledge and to some extent learning, as distinguished from mere skill.
• Second.
It is an occupation which is pursued largely for others and not merely for one’s self.
• Third.
It is an occupation in which the amount of (cid:28)nancial return is not the accepted measure of success.
Within Brandeis’ three paradoxical pronouncements lies the answer to what it means to be a professional in business.
12.2.1 The paradox of skill All professions require unique skills.
While demonstrated pro(cid:28)ciency in particular skills is necessary for admission into a profession, skill mastery alone is not su(cid:30)cient to de(cid:28)ne the professional.
If it were, a surgeon would be simply a plumber employed to mend human pipes and valves; a lawyer simply a carpenter crafting together legal words and phrases into motions, wills or contracts; a teacher simply an actor skilled at presentation or lecturing.
While the surgeon must be extraordinarily skilled in the crafts of incision and suturing, while the lawyer must be adept at the craft of legal word-smithing, and the teacher a master of the practical arts of communication, such skills are not the essence of who they are as professionals, nor are they the be and end all of their practices.
Understanding this di(cid:27)erence is the key to the classic distinction between a trade and a profession.
Both trades and professions require the practice and perfection of signi(cid:28)cant skills, but a trade is com- pletely de(cid:28)ned by its commensurate skill; a profession is not.
As Brandeis explains: (cid:16)A profession is an occupationforwhichthenecessarypreliminarytrainingisintellectualincharacterinvolvingknowledge, and to some extent learning, as distinguished from mere skill.
(cid:17) I would add that it is not just in (cid:16)preliminary training(cid:17) that intelligence and learning are required, but in all aspects of the practice of the continuing professional life.
In a time when everyone wants to be called professional, a real danger lurks in Brandeis’ distinction, an elitism (‘mere skill’), a snobbery, a class bias that is inappropriate both to the tradesperson and the 2Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35553/1.4/>.

Once, the trades were a source of enormous pride and distinction.
Through Medieval guilds a revolutioninhumanworthandworkwassetinmotionandthefoundationsoftheindustrialandtechnological revolutionslaid.
Throughtheguildstructure, theskillsoftradeswerepassedfromgenerationtogeneration, and the pride of association with quality and integrity maintained.
But the professions were something else entirely.
Called The Learned Professions as the Middle Ages yielded to the Renaissance, the Priesthood, Law, and Medicine obviously required rigorous training in particular skills, but the application of these particular skills required a dimension of commitment and integritynotnecessitatedofatrade.
Thewisdomtocounselhumanbeingsinthemidstofspiritual,emotional, physical or legal crisis necessarily requires more than technique.
It requires a learned and practiced wisdom: an ethic.
It is one thing to entrust your bathroom to a plumber, another thing entirely to entrust your life to a heart surgeon.
Those willing to assume the unique burdens of the spiritual, physical, and legal care for humans in existential need were designated, or set apart, as learned professionals.
As I write this chapter, I am in the process of recovering from open heart surgery.
The experience of putting my life in the hands of a physician is vivid.
I am also sitting in my home that is being extensively remodeled.
I am fortunate to have a relationship with two excellent persons: Dick, my heart surgeon and Craig, the skilled construction craftsman (carpenter, plumber and electrician) restoring our home.
Both are highly skilled and wise men.
Dick, however, is integral to the care and counseling that guided me and my familythroughmydecisionto(cid:16)goundertheknife(cid:17).
Craigisfullofsagewisdomaboutthepublicandforeign a(cid:27)airs of our times, but in no sense is my life vulnerable to his lively and wise insights that we share while he restores my kitchen and replaces the bedroom window.
Exactly three weeks ago Dick, sat on the side of my bed in a Denver, Colorado hospital surrounded by twelve members of my family and talked to me about the alternatives for dealing with a most unexpected heart problem.
He showed me the very worrisome pictures of several partially blocked arteries, and told me that, in his opinion, I had no choice but to have quadruple bypass surgery.
Dick said he would send my (cid:28)le to anyone I wished for a second opinion, but felt I should reach a decision soon.
My kids asked all sorts of nervous and caring questions and he responded openly and fully.
Never have I been with someone as obviously open and trustworthy at a time when so much was at stake for me.
As I made my decision to move forward with this personal ordeal, I would learn from friends in the community that Dick was one of the most skilled surgeons in the country.
That was reassuring.
But I already knew he was a professional: a person wise and caring enough for me to trust my life to.
12.2.2 The paradox of the public pledge A profession is literally so called a profession because the aspirant to the o(cid:30)ce is orally sworn to speci(cid:28)c publiccommitments(cid:22)he/sheprofessespubliclylegalandethicalobligationsuniquetothevocationoflawyer, physician,counselororpriest.

Not only is the priest sworn to care for particular souls, he is also sworn to see to the care of (cid:16)the people of God(cid:17), the moral welfare of the parish, the salvation of the world.
Not only is the doctor sworn to put the interest of the patient above his own, but the health of the patient’s family, neighborhood, and the public is also his professional obligation.
The lawyer is not simply employed to represent the particular client, but also sworn to be an (cid:16)o(cid:30)cer of the court(cid:17).
While accountants may be employed by Arthur Anderson to do the books for the Enron Corporation, they also are sworn to keep the interests of the public uncompromised (after all, we call the profession Certi(cid:28)ed Public Accountants).
I know of no professional comfortable with the tension inherent in this public pledge.
No one likes hard choices; no one likes moral ambiguity; each of us wishes to live in a world where things can be reduced to some least common ethical denominator (for example, a single duty).
When teaching business students, the mantra of Milton Friedman is the droning undertone of almost every class discussion: (cid:16)the business of business is business(cid:17), the sole responsibility of the business executive is to increase shareholder return.
Yet, the very essence of professional responsibility is to address the di(cid:30)cult and unavoidable ethical tensionsbetweenpublicandprivateinterest(cid:22)thepriestwhohearstheconfessionofadisturbedandhomicidal parishioner intent on killing yet again; the lawyer who discovers that a client has misrepresented the facts of his case, and is asking for a plea to the court based in lies and distortions; the doctor who is asked to prescribe extraordinarily expensive treatments to a patient too ill, or old to have any reasonable chance of curative bene(cid:28)t; or the engineer who is told that she is bound by a con(cid:28)dentiality agreement, in spite of her certain conviction that a plane, bridge, or space shuttle is likely to fail and potentially cause extensive loss of life.
These are not plot summaries for Hollywood; in an in(cid:28)nite variety, they are the stu(cid:27) of professional life in the complex world of the twenty-(cid:28)rst century.
It is by design, and not by accident, that professionals are thrust continually into such Hobson choice predicaments.

I think of professionals as the value bearers for society, those particularly burdened and practiced to address the most di(cid:30)cult and sensitive human ethical dilemmas.
I do not mean to imply that a business person, lawyer, doctor, psychiatrist, or teacher is better in some moral sense than anyone else.
Instead, that they have agreed to assume a unique ethical burden, to work at the transaction point where issues of signi(cid:28)cant human value are on the line.
The professional is sworn not to desert this post, to be there to counsel, re(cid:29)ect and bear with the human condition in the midst of transition and crisis.
This is, to me, the essence of professional practice(cid:22)the practice of raising the value content of human decisions and choices.
That is the professional’s sworn burden, it is the very nature of the ethic that de(cid:28)nes who the professional is.
All this said, it astounds me that anyone would want the title of professional.
But to make sure this point is underlined, let us consider the (cid:16)Paradox of pay(cid:17), perhaps the most complexing of all to the business professional.
12.2.3 The paradox of pay I am watching a sports show on the evening news.
A local sportscaster is interviewing a member of the Harlem Globetrotters, who are in town for a game.
The interview goes something like this: Sports Guy: Al, I was surprised you never turned pro.
Al: What do you mean?
I am a pro, I get paid pretty good for playing ball.
Sports Guy: Well yeah?
But I meant you never tried out for the NBA.
Al: Oh, well I like playing for the Globetrotters better ... AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>231 Almost everyone assumes that being professional means getting paid (and paid well) for one’s work.
There are professionals and there are amateurs, the former get paid, while the amateurs do it for the love of it.
Well,no.
Originally,theprofessionsweretooimportanttoreceivewagesintheusualsense.
Professionals were not paid for their work; instead, professionals received an honorarium, a gratuity from the community intendedbothtohonoranddisassociatethevocationfromthenecessitiesofthemarket, tofreethevocation for the sel(cid:29)ess task of caring for others.
Three days before my heart surgery I happened to watch a Sixty Minutes piece on a cardiology group in California which was prescribing and performing unnecessary bypass surgery in order to increase their practice’s revenues.
It was chilling.

In a real sense, professionals indeed do it for love.

(cid:17) I have only one answer: professions are rightly designated as vocations.
We become priests, lawyers, physicians, professors because we cannot do anything else; who we are cannot be achieved outside the realm of what we are impelled to do.
12.3 Corporate social responsibility3 The legal and historic roots of the modern corporation reach well back into the eighteenth century, but it was in the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century that this truly extraordinary form of human organization came into its own and, the twentieth century, became the dominant economic force on earth.
Consider its amazing characteristics concentration of management, accumulation of capital, shielding of ownership from liability, and being granted a legal existence not necessarily bounded by either space or time(cid:22)both ubiquitous and eternal!
As well, however, consider its fearsome prospects vis-(cid:224)-vis its lack of accountability, its de(cid:28)cit of democratic governance, its often-uncivilized competitive engagement with all other sectors of society, not to mention its transcendence of both national sovereignty and legal jurisdiction.
And there you have it.
Is the Trans-national Corporation the answer to the fundamental issues of human survival, or the fundamental threat to life itself?
In short, will the corporation of the twenty-(cid:28)rst century be a corrupt Robin Hood, or a virtuous Sheri(cid:27) of Nottingham?
Corporations are not natural persons.
Corporations are (cid:28)ctitious, corporations are juridical persons created by law.
The point is this: the ethical considerations one might use when dealing with a friend, associate, or stranger, are signi(cid:28)cantly di(cid:27)erent when the subject is the corporation.

People(cid:22) their behavior and the products of their work and intellect(cid:22)are judged ethically and legally based chie(cid:29)y on their intentions.
Ethical analysis of the behavior of natural persons begins with considerations of what a person meant by what he or she did, said, or produced.
In contrast, ethical analysis involving the entity we call (cid:16)the corporation(cid:17) must forever begin and end in law and public policy.
With reference to the political economy that brought forth the beast.
The legal entity, known as the corporation, was created to shield investors from liabilities beyond the limit of their investment (a result that neither sole proprietorships nor partnerships could accomplish) with the legislative intent of facilitating the aggregation of private capital.
This legal experiment begun 19th century has succeeded spectacularly.
For people to survive, they need physical and emotional nourishment, and familial and social support.
Corporations survive solely by their ability to return value to their shareholders.
Hence, corporations are consequential critters, Utilitarian to the core.
A friend may forget a lunch date and hurt your feelings, but when he says, (cid:16)I’m really sorry, I can’t believe I forgot.
(cid:17) You say, (cid:16)Hey I missed you, but it’s OK. Let’s try again next week.
(cid:17) When a company launches a new product and if the 100 million dollar venture tanks, shareholders do not want to hear about how sorry management is that things did not work out, or that management meant well.
It will do the CEO no good to say, (cid:16)My heart was in the right place.
(cid:17) When we talk about the ethical criteria for judging the behavior of corporations we speak not of intent, but responsibility: quite literally, the capacity to respond.
Corporate ethics is the ethics of corporate social responsibility (CSR), not corporate personal responsibility.
The responsibility of a corporation is shaped by two realities: the obligations created by society through (1) law and public policy (legal responsibilities), and(2) theobligationscreatedby corporate culture, i.e.
stakeholder(customers, employees, neighborhoods, natural environments) obligations.
The two overlap and reinforce each other, but their limits lie within the boundaries of a company’s tangible capacities.
Corporateethicsisreallyaboutgainingunderstandingofwhatarecalled(cid:16)mixedmotives(cid:17).
Whennatural persons have mixed motives(cid:22)you give a hundred bucks to the opera because you want your boss, who supportstheopera, tothinkwellofyou(cid:22)wesomehowknowthatthisisnotanunambiguouslylaudableact.
But when a company that makes computers gives 100 laptops to the public school system, and does so with the hope that exposing children to their brand of computers will lead to increased sales(cid:22)this (cid:16)doing good to do well(cid:17) is not only laudable, it is responsible(cid:22)responsible both to shareholders and the stakeholders.
Corporations as a matter of fact, can only act with (cid:16)mixed motives(cid:17).
By law, they are created to serve the bottom line of returning wealth to investors.
The law says corporations have a (cid:28)duciary responsibility ((cid:28)duciary = the highest standard of loyalty and trust owed by agents to principles) to their shareholders, who are the legal owners of the corporation.
To do good, a corporation must do well.
As a business ethicist, I argue the reverse: to do well, a corporation must do good.
People have consciences, and some would say souls; corporations have neither.
Corporations are creatures of law and public policy, they are cultural creations; as such, they have unique cultures of their own.
Corporate ethics is therefore really about the creation of a culture of responsibility within the corporation.
Dr Lynne Payne of Harvard University has made a major contribution to the understanding of CSR and how it is achieved in her distinction between compliance based organizations and integrity based organiza- tions.
In reality, CSR is a product of both compliance (legal and regulatory constraints) and integrity (the internal culture and self regulatory environment).
This is underscored by new laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the almost two decade old US Federal Sentencing Guidelines (policy guidelines established in part to determining corporate criminal punishment in US Federal Courts).
SarbanesOxley isparticularlyinterestinggivenPayne’scompliance/integrityconstruct,inthatitrequires bothintegritystructures(suchasacorporateboardofethics,andinternalprotectionsforwhistleblowers)and increases(cid:28)nes forviolation ofanti-trustand otherfederalstatutesregulatinginter-statecorporatebehavior.
Thus, corporations are creatures of law and policy and are regulated externally.
Corporations have no conscience per se, but like any social system can develop a guiding culture, maintained through education and reinforced by the habits and interactions of the people within the corporation.

Yet, it is in such times that fundamental changes most often emerge.
Those who dare to ride these currents of change will emerge in a new order of political economy.

As a result, organizations are under pressuretoevaluatetheirexistingproductlineandtomakecontinuousdecisionsaboutaddingnewproducts or deleting existing products.
For instance, the graph in Exhibit 13.1 shows how an organization must establish a series of successful products, if that organization wants to maintain a consistent stream of sales or else grow sales over time.
One reason for this pattern is the product life cycle.
As shown in the graph, no product lasts forever, and sales levels can (cid:29)uctuate dramatically over time.
The company illustrated in Exhibit 1 has marketed 8 di(cid:27)erent products over time.
In the past, four of these products have been deleted (the products labeled as A, B, C, and F).
As a result, the sales level in the most current period depends upon the success of the remaining four products.
If the (cid:28)rm has a goal to increase sales in the coming years, then it is imperative for that (cid:28)rm to introduce a new group of successful products.
Organizations invest a lot of money to create new products that perform e(cid:27)ectively.
Nonetheless, (cid:28)rms often struggle to convince people to incorporate these new products into their routines (Arts 2008).
For example, it took 18 years for microwave ovens to gain acceptance in Greece (Tellis, Stremersch, and Yin 2003).
The ultimate success of new products depends on consumers accepting them (Arts 2008).
The term (cid:16)product(cid:17) refers to both goods and services.
A product is anything that can be o(cid:27)ered to a market to satisfy a want or need.
There are a number of ways to classify products, and those methods are discussed later in the chapter.
In this chapter, we discuss the following topics: (a) Where do innovations come from?
(b) product categories; (c) Innovation through business models; (d) Evaluating innovations; (e) 1Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35557/1.4/>.

ADDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES When innovation fails: deleting products; and (f) chapter summary.
In the next two sections, we brie(cid:29)y discuss innovations and their origins.
Exhibit 13.1: Sales of individual products and total sales 13.3 Where does innovation come from?3 We de(cid:28)ne (cid:16)innovation(cid:17) as an idea or product that is new to the sponsoring organization.
A (cid:16)discontinuous innovation(cid:17) has the potential to alter existing consumption patterns, or else create new ones.
For example, portableaudioequipmenthasevolvedfromtheradio,tothecassettetapeplayer,tothecompactdiskplayers and to the digital audio player.
At the extreme, a discontinuous innovation results in the creation of a new generic category of products, such as the GPS navigation system.
In contrast, (cid:16)continuous innovations(cid:17) involve introducing a new entrant into an existing category.
Con- tinuous innovations do not challenge established patterns of consumption behavior.
A good example of this type of innovation is the smart phone.
For this product, consumers already know what a phone is and how to operate it.
From this perspective, the operation of a smart phone can be viewed as a combination of the functions associated with a mobile phone and the functions of a personal digital assistant (PDA).
In a more recent o(cid:27)ering, a smart phone combines the functions of PCs and Macs through applying the software and operating systems of each.
As a result, consumers can access their current knowledge about existing products and then easily grasp the (cid:16)smart phone(cid:17) concept.
On the one hand, the process of innovation is the life blood of an organization.
New product innovations areresponsibleforemployment,economicgrowth,technologicalprocess,andhighstandardsofliving(Souder 1987).
In a marketing context, innovation is crucial for the development of successful new products (both goodsandservices).
Ontheotherhand, itisachallengetodevelopandevaluatetheseinnovations.
Inbrief, where do innovative ideas come from?
We describe (cid:28)ve sources of innovation: technical breakthroughs, non- technical idea development, ideas that emerge from environments, serendipity, and purposeful development.
These various strategies are outlined in Table 1 and described in more detail in the following section.
Technical breakthroughs refer to product innovations that result from technical developments.
New brands that have emerged from this process include MP3 players, GPS navigation devices, and cell phones.
In the long run, it is consumers who decide how new technologies will be used.
For instance, Guglielmo Marconi created the radio-telegraph so that ships could communicate with each other on the high seas in 1894.
However, other applications emerged, and everyday uses eventually multiplied.
For instance, in 1921, 3Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35574/1.5/>.

Thecompanytook its name from the small wooden building for radio equipment on ships.
As more families adopted radios, it was a real challenge to develop content.
Eventually, the advertising business model was created, and the funds that were provided by advertisers were used to sponsor the development of popular content (e.g.
music, dramatic shows, variety shows) (Zinkhan 2005).
Non-technicaldevelopmentisanotherpathtoproductinnovation.
Thisapproachinvolves(cid:28)ndinganiche in the market without making radical changes to the basic product category (i.e.
in terms of the underlying technology).
(cid:16)Build a Bear Workshop(cid:17) provides a good example of this style of innovation.
Unlike other conventional stu(cid:27)ed animal manufacturers, the Build a Bear Workshop allows customers to choose their bear’s body, sound, clothing, stu(cid:30)ng, and heart.
For example, a customer can choose, a lower-priced paper heart with their wish, or they can invest in a higher-priced electronic heart.
After customers make choices, they then observe the production process in the shop.
In this way, customers create their own custom- designed toy.
This business model does not rely on developing new technology.
However, there is a modi(cid:28)ed production process, as the stu(cid:30)ng and sewing machine are located in the retail store.
Ideasthatemergefromenvironmentsrefertoinnovationsthatresultfromimportingproductsfromother cultures.
Good examples of this style of innovation are Wal-mart in China and IKEA in the United States.
Traditionally, there were no large-scale retail stores in Asian nations, such as Japan, Korea, China or India.
Instead, small retailers or mom-and-pop stores dominated.
Large-retail stores are now achieving success in Asian nations, through importing the idea of economies of scale, which, in turn enable one-stop shopping andlowerprices.
Similarly, IKEAachievedgreatsuccessintheUSandChinathroughimportingtheideaof a warehouse-type retail setting from Europe.
IKEA o(cid:27)ers high-quality furniture and home interior products for lower prices.
Consumer assembly is often required.
Serendipity plays a role in product innovation.
The word serendipity derives from (cid:16)serendip,(cid:17) which means(cid:16)SriLanka(cid:17) inPersian.
Thefairytale,TheThreePrincesofSerendip,tellsthestoryofthreemenwho continuouslydiscoversomethingthatiscompletelyunrelatedtowhattheyoriginallysetoutto(cid:28)nd.
Thus,the term (cid:16)serendipity(cid:17) describes a situation where one accidentally discovers something fortunate, while looking forsomethingelseentirely.

Asdescribedby PlatoinTheRepublic: (cid:16)Necessityisthemotherofinvention.
(cid:17) Inotherwords,thistypeofinnovationoccurs when existing product lines cannot satisfy current needs or current demand.
As a result, organizations are willing invest considerable funds (e.g.
in terms of research and development or marketing research) to create a successful innovation.

This manner of innovation is discussed in more detail in the section which follows, (cid:16)Product Categories.
(cid:17) 13.3.1 Product categories There are a number of ways to classify products (see Table 13.2 and Exhibit 13.2).
For instance, a product canbeclassi(cid:28)edbydurabilityandtangibility.

According to one convention, a durablegoodlastsmorethanoneyear.
Non-durablegoodsaretangible,buttheyprovidebene(cid:28)tsforashort time.
Good examples include: gum, shaving cream, gas, batteries, and cosmetics.
There are also controlled goods which are often restricted by government action, due to their potential danger or addictive nature.
Good examples include: cigarettes, alcohol, tobacco, (cid:28)rearms, and even some over-the-counter drugs.
Business-to-business (B2B) products refer to goods bought by individuals or organizations for further processingorforuseindoingbusiness.
ExamplesinB2Binclude: buildings,(cid:29)ourpurchasedbyacommercial baker, crude oil, steel for automobile manufacture, insurance policies for company buildings, and business consulting services.
Business-to-customer (B2C) products refer to goods that individual customers purchase for personal and family use, such as passenger cars, hairdryers, TVs, medical insurance policies, and carpet cleaning services for the home.
Convenience products are products that consumers want to purchase frequently, immediately, and with a minimum of e(cid:27)ort.
Examples here include: soft drinks, cigarettes, fast foods, newspapers, public trans- portation and candy bars.
Shopping goods are purchased only after consumers make comparisons with competing goods based on such attributes as price, quality, style, or color.
Examples in this category in- clude: MP3 players, passenger cars, clothing, furniture, and houses.
Specialty products are products with unique characters.
Buyers often prize such goods and make a special e(cid:27)ort to obtain them.
Examples in this group include collectable items, engagement rings, vacation homes, yachts, art works, luxury cars, and special concert tickets.

Table 13.2: Classifying products 13.4 Innovation through business models4 A good business model is a story that explains how an enterprise is designed to work (Margretta 2002).
A business model identi(cid:28)es sources of competitive advantage and describes the (cid:28)rm’s pathway to pro(cid:28)tabil- ity and success.
From a marketing perspective, the business model describes customers and what they value.
From a managerial perspective, the business model describes how an organization makes pro(cid:28)t. See Exhibit 13.3 (Six-step model).
In this section, we review some emerging models in the music industry, in order to illustrate how such models can serve as a source of innovation.
That is, a traditional way for organizations to remain pro(cid:28)table is to introduce a series of related goods.
As shown earlier in , the organization introduces eight products (labeled A through H).
Over time, the sales for product A begin to decline, so the organization is under considerable pressure to introduce new successful products.
If represents the cumulative sales for a record label, then product A might be a hip-hop CD, while product B is a CD created by a rock artist.
In this section of the chapter, we present an alternative source of innovation(cid:22)the innovation that results from suc- cessfullyintroducingnewbusinessmodels.
Allourexamplesarederivedfromthemusicindustry,butrelated industries (e.g.
(cid:28)lms, books) are undergoing similar transformations and creating similar opportunities for entrepreneurs.
13.4.1 Examples of business models from the music industry Since the late 1990s, the availability of online music has caused a lot of confusion in the marketplace.
Traditional business models are no longer applicable for explaining the current business opportunities.
The musicindustryinthetwenty-(cid:28)rstcenturyprovidesaclassicillustrationofa(cid:16)disruptivetechnology(cid:17),whereby new technologies drive out established technologies and established ways of doing business.
Here, we brie(cid:29)y review eight business models in the music industry.
We distinguish among these models via (cid:28)ve characteristics: current implementation, feasibility, legality, consumer satisfaction, and record label satisfaction (See Table 3).
Note that some of these models are currently implemented, while others are speculative in nature.

AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>241 13.4.2 Traditional business model In this business model, the artists create music and try to be signed by a record label.
After the artist is signed by a record label, then that organization provides a number of services, including (cid:28)nancing music recordingandproduction;organizingconcerttours;producingandsellingmerchandise;marketingtheband’s creation; promoting the band through exposure on mass media; and more.

Finally,theretailersmarketandsellthepackagedgoodstothe(cid:28)nalconsumers(Slater,Smith, Bambauer, Gasser, and Palfrey 2005; see Exhibit 13.3 (Six-step model)).
Six-step model Exhibit 13.3 13.4.3 Digital music stores Thismodelsuggeststhattheretailersmoveonlineando(cid:27)ercontentdirectlytoconsumersthroughwebsites.
This approach is similar to the traditional model, but there is an emphasis on the online delivery of content (Slater et al., 2005).
Amazon was one of the (cid:28)rst companies to implement this model in the 1990s.
Since the debut of this model, two major modi(cid:28)cations have been made.
First, consumers can now purchase digital downloads of the music, rather than receiving a physical product, such as CDs.
This o(cid:27)ers an intangible and instantaneous approach to buying music.
The second large modi(cid:28)cation is also related to digital downloading, as users no longer have to buy an entire CD.
Many digital music stores o(cid:27)er free sampling of each song which allows customers to preview tracks that they want to purchase.
The Apple’s iTune store successfully implements this model in the twenty-(cid:28)rst century.
13.4.4 Open content Thismodelisderivedfromthe(cid:16)AncillaryProductsandServices(cid:17) modelthattheBerkmancenterformulated in2005(Slateretal.
2005).
Onemainassumptionhereisthatnothingcanbedonetostoptheillegalsharing of music.
In order for the model to be successful, the content creator, record companies, and consumers mustencouragetheuseofpeer-to-peernetworking.
Thus, everymusicdownloadfromthisbusinessmodelis free of charge.
This model is di(cid:27)erent in that free (cid:28)le sharing is encouraged.
However, there is a concerted e(cid:27)ortto(cid:28)ndothersourcesofrevenue(BerkmanCenter2003).
Othersourcesofincomemayincludetouring, selling band paraphernalia, endorsements, and fan clubs.
This model is illegal under current laws in the US and many other countries as it violates existing copyrights.
Note that, in most contexts, open-content sharing is legal as long the owner signs a contract that allows such distribution.
There are con(cid:29)icting viewpoints on the open content model.
On one extreme, there people like Lars Ulrich, the Drummer for Metallica, who is outraged that this could even be an option.
According to Ulrich, (cid:16)The argument I hear a lot, that music should be free, must then mean the musicians should work for free.
Nobody else works for free, why should musicians (Ulrich and McGuinn 2000)?
(cid:17) On the other extreme are AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>242 CHAPTER 13.

At(cid:28)rstglance,theopen-contentmodelappearstobeveryradical,asitdi(cid:27)erssomuchfromothermodels.
Nonetheless, it has gained considerable attention in the last few years.
This approach is very satisfying for customers, but is a major threat for record labels and channel members.
13.4.5 Artist-centered website hub This business model uses one large website as a database for music.
Content creators contact the website directly and set the price of their music.
The website sets a minimum downloading fee to cover costs; the fee is set on a monthly basis (or on a per-download basis).
Customers access the website and purchase all the music they want, knowing that the artist receives most of the pro(cid:28)t. Somewebsitesarealreadyimplementingthismodel.
Forinstance,CDBabysellsindependentmusicthat comes directly from the artist.
Since this model cuts out several middlemen, CD Baby claims that artists receive USD 6-12 per album versus the USD 1-2 that artists typically receive through their record labels.
There are currently 248,891 artists on CD Baby and over USD 87,052,087 dollars have gone directly to the artist since the company opened for business in 1998 (He(cid:31)inger 2008).
13.4.6 Artist’s personal website Another potential model encourages users to access the artist’s personal websites to purchase music.
This approach allows the artists to have the most control over their music.
The band Radiohead tested this model during the debut of their seventh album (cid:16)Only in Rainbows.
(cid:17) The band alienated themselves from their record label, EMI, and o(cid:27)ered the album solely from their website Radiohead.com.
Customers who visited the site where allowed to decide what they were willing to pay for the album (Tyangiel 2007).
Although this model is attractive for popular artists, it is potentially troublesome for artists who are not well known.
Lesser known artists have great di(cid:30)culty standing out in a crowded market.
This model also eliminates the record label.
13.4.7 Non-traditional (cid:16)record labels(cid:17) Currently,independentrecordlabelsaresproutingupinunexpectedplaces.
In2003,theCrackerBarrelOld CountryStorecreatedanAmericanRootsrecordlabelcalledCBmusic, Ltd(Romero2003).
Starbucks, the eternally popular co(cid:27)ee house launched their own record label in March of 2007.
Their plan involves signing artists (e.g.
Paul McCartney) and selling records through Starbucks stores (http://www.starbucks.com/).
13.4.8 Tax-the-device model This model follows the open content model, in that music is provided free of charge for music downloads.
However, such downloads are tracked, and a sales tax is placed on all devices that are sold to play back downloaded (cid:28)les.
The money generated from taxes is then used to pay back artists.
Of course, this model is speculative in nature.
At present, there is not a reliable method for tracking all downloads.
In addition, devices sold outside of the US would be di(cid:30)cult to tax.
13.4.9 Summary of new business models A major purpose in describing these music business models is to illustrate how innovations do not have to be tied to the success of a new good or service.
Rather, an organization can innovate by introducing a new method of doing business, and such innovation has the potential to (cid:16)turn the world upside down(cid:17) (a la Google or Facebook).

Asaresult,organizations implement formal systems for evaluating new products.
In particular, there is a concerted e(cid:27)ort to forecast projected sales and thus reduce some of the (cid:28)nancial risk.
While evaluating new products, there is also the possibility of generating innovative ideas that can later go through the testing process.
Idea generation is an essential part of marketing strategy and is critical to the success of a company.
When such product ideas move further along in the process, a key step is to create a prototype or working version of the new o(cid:27)ering.
Again, market testing is crucial at every stage in the development process.
Here, we brie(cid:29)y discuss three main alternatives for evaluating new additions to the product line: labora- torytests,expertevaluations,andcustomerevaluations(UrbanandHauser1993).
Withrespecttocustomer evaluations, we distinguish between central-location tests and home-use tests (Crask, Fox and Stout 1995).
Thelaboratorytestsprovideinformationregardingtheperformanceofnewproductsinextremesettings.
For example, a new copy machine can be tested at various work loads, such as numbers of copies and speed perminutetotesttherelationshipbetweenworkloadandpaperjam.
Adisadvantageforthelaboratorytest is that it may not fully represent real-life conditions.
Consumers are famous for (cid:28)ndings new ways to abuse products, and they are not such skillful operators as lab testers.
Expert evaluators can be used at all phases of the new product development process.
For instance, experts can be used to estimate whether or not a new product idea will be accepted in the marketplace before a prototype even exists.
Experts also play a role later in the process.
For instance, a new passenger car can be tested by a car expert, who provides a (published) review that covers topics such as: handling, comfort, ease of use, styling, acceleration, miles per gallon, and so forth.
Expert evaluation is relatively low in cost, as just a few experts can provide estimates about the behaviors of many customers.
At the same time, the small number of experts on each project may lead to biased forecasts.
In later stages of development, customers can be recruited to evaluate prototypes.
There is an attempt to test new products under conditions that are relatively close to actual use.
Here, we distinguish between two types of customer evaluations: central-location evaluation and home-use evaluation.

• Round robin test: all possible product pairs are evaluated, using a format where consumers compare two products at a time.
• Blind test: a new product is compared to existing products.
Under the home-use test, customers are invited to use a new product as part of their everyday life.
The homeusetestisusuallymoreexpensivethanthecentral-locationevaluation,butitismorerealistic.
Popular types of home-use tests include: • Paired comparison test: participants evaluate two products in normal usage situation and provide evaluations for both products.
• Single-producthome-usetest(monadictest): participantsevaluateoneproductafterusingthatproduct for a speci(cid:28)ed time period.
• Proto-monadic home-use tests: a hybrid design where participants are asked to use a certain product for a speci(cid:28)c time period and then evaluate.
Next, participants follow a similar procedure for a second test product.
13.6 When innovation fails: deleting products6 13.6.1 Product failure In general, a product fails when it does not meet the objectives that were established by the sponsoring organization.
Failure rates vary by industry.
For instance, failure rates for new packaged goods range from 75 per cent to 90 per cent (catalinamarketing.com).
When considering (cid:16)innovative(cid:17) new products, Gourville (2005)estimatesthatapproximatelyhalfofallsuchproductsfail.
Itoftencostsmoretolaunchaninnovation nationally than to develop the good or service in the (cid:28)rst place.
In the following section, we describe Wal-Mart’s failure as it tried to enter the German market.
Our purpose is to use this one example to illustrate key reasons that new products fail and subsequently must be deleted.
See Table 4 for a listing of major reasons that cause products to be deleted.
Table 4 includes a description of 13 reasons that products fail.
Note that the Wal-Mart experience in Germany provides concrete examples for 10 of these key reasons.
In the table, the reasons for product deletion are divided into 5 groups: (a) Market Structure (MS); (b) Business Model (BM); (c) Culture (C); (d) Politics/regulation (P): and (e) Product failure (PF).
These same categories are highlighted in the sections which follow.
13.6.2 Case, example of product failure: Wal-Mart in Germany, 1997 to 2006 Wal-Mart is the biggest food retailer in the world and has a presence in several nations.
In some nations (e.g.
the US, Canada, China), Wal-Mart is a great success.
However, Wal-Mart has failed in some countries (e.g.
Germany, South Korea).
First, we describe Wal-Mart’s failure in Europe’s largest economy.
Second, we use Wal-Mart’s experiences in Germany to illustrate some key principles related to product failure and product deletion (see Table 4).
Wal-Mart’s experiences are also an example of the importance to adapt to culture when starting a business in a new country.
The German grocery industry 6Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35570/1.4/>.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>245 There is (cid:28)erce competition in the German grocery industry, due to the increasing number of discount supermarket chains (KPMG 2006).
As a result, there is low pro(cid:28)tability in the food retail sector; pro(cid:28)t marginsrangefrom0.5percentto1percentwhichisoneofthelowestpro(cid:28)tmarginsinEurope(Frankfurter Rundschau 2007).
By contrast, pro(cid:28)t margins in Great Britain are 5 per cent, in this same sector.
In particular, Metroisatoughcompetitor, anditalreadyappliessomeofWal-Mart’ssuccessfulstrategies(e.g.
related to economics of scale and low prices).
Of course, Wal-Mart is interested in other metrics beyond pro(cid:28)t (e.g.
shareholder wealth, market share), but, as indicated above, pro(cid:28)tability and margins are of key concern to retailers.
Wal-Mart: strategic concept Wal-Mart is the world’s largest retailer with approximately 6,500 stores worldwide (Business 2006).

Wal-Mart tries to minimizelaborcostsbyo(cid:27)eringminimalhealthcareplans.
Wal-Martpressuresitssupplierstocutcosts, on a continuous basis.
In brief, Wal-Mart’s managers are constantly seeking out ways to cut costs, and some of their successes are passed on to shoppers, in terms of lower prices.
Wal-Mart’s entry into the german market In 1997, Wal-Mart acquired over 21 stores from the supermarket chain (cid:16)Wertkauf.
(cid:17) One year later, Wal-Mart bought an additional 74 stores from the supermarket chain (cid:16)Interspar(cid:17).
As a result, Wal-Mart became the fourth biggest operator of supermarkets in Germany (Lebensmittelzeitung 2006).
The objective was to expand to 500 stores in Germany.
However, the number of stores never exceeded the 95 stores that were originally purchased in the (cid:28)rst two years.
Wal-Mart’s position in the marketplace deteriorated over the years.
In 2002, Wal-Mart had some (cid:28)nancial di(cid:30)culties due to a low turnover which resulted in the dismissal of some employees.
At the end of 2006, Wal-Mart was bought out by (cid:16)Metro(cid:17), one of Germany’s largest retail groups.
Finally, Wal-Mart left the German market with a loss of one billion dollars before tax (Manager-Magazin 2006).
Mis-steps in the german market Ingeneral,thereare(cid:28)vekeyissuesrelatedtoWal-Mart’sultimatewithdrawalfromGermany: (a)market structure; (b) business model (these (cid:28)rst two are discussed together here); c) cultural and communication; (d) politics and regulation; and (e) product/service failure.
Each of these issues is discussed in turn.
Note also that these (cid:28)ve issues are highlighted in Table 13.4.
Market structure and business model A retailer that wants to follow Wal-Mart’s strategy of low prices needs to expand rapidly.
In Germany, therenotenoughappropriatelocationstosupportsuchexpansion(seeTable13.4).
Aspreviouslymentioned, Wal-Martdidnotbuildtheirownstoresbuttookover21existing(cid:16)Wertkauf(cid:17) supermarketsthathadatotally di(cid:27)erentbusinessmodel.
Thestoresthemselveswereverysmallandhadalimitedrangeofgoods.
Arelated problem is that these stores were located far apart, which resulted in high logistical costs.
When entering a new market, it is important to anticipate competitors’ reactions.
In Germany, Wal- Mart’sbiggestcompetitor,Metro,wantedtoexpandtheirstores;atthesametime,Metrowantedtoprevent Wal-Mart from executing their expansion plans (Senge 2004).
Many times, a product has to be deleted because the competition is too strong.
With the strategy of (cid:16)Every day low prices,(cid:17) Wal-Mart is very successful in the United States and also in many other countries.
In Germany, there is extreme competition in the retail food sector.
Therefore, the German customer is quite accustomed to the low prices that are o(cid:27)ered by numerous discount supermarket chains.
For this reason, Wal-Mart’s strategy of o(cid:27)ering low prices did not create su(cid:30)cient competitive advantage (see Table 13.4).
Culture and communication When products are introduced, it is important to consider cultural factors.
In this case, corporate culture played a key role.
Wal-Mart’s top executives decided to operate the German locations from their o(cid:30)ces in the United Kingdom.
Thus, Wal-Mart’s (cid:16)corporate language(cid:17) was English.
However, many of the AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>246 CHAPTER 13.
ADDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES older Wal-Mart managers in Germany do not speak English.
As a result, there were often breakdowns in communication.
Some managers of the acquired stores did not stay on after the Wal-Mart acquisition.
Key business connections were lost.
As a result, several key suppliers (e.g.
Adidas, Samsonite, Nike) declined to work as suppliers for Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart did not just lose important suppliers; they also lost an important part of their range of goods (Senge 2004).
The situation could have been improved by retaining and communicating e(cid:27)ectively with the German managers who had know-how about the local market (see Table 4).
Politics and regulation The managers of Wal-Mart were not su(cid:30)ciently familiar with the laws and regulations in Germany, as they violated them several times.
One of Wal-Mart’s fundamental principles is to stay union free.
However, in Germany, unions have a powerful position.
Through collective bargaining and related tactics, they can have a strong in(cid:29)uence on political decision making.
Ver.di is a German union in the service sector.
With 2.4 million members, it is one of the largest independent, trade unions in the world (Ver.di 2008).
AccordingtotheGermanCommercialCode,allincorporatedcompaniesareobligatedtopublisha(cid:28)nan- cialstatement, includingapro(cid:28)t andlossstatement.
Dueto thefactthat Wal-Martrefused topublishtheir (cid:28)nancial statements for the years 1999 and 2000, Ver.di sued in a court of law.
Wal-Mart was sentenced to pay a (cid:28)ne.
The coverage of this law suit in the German press led to a negative public image for Wal-Mart.
After the expansion strategy failed due to the lack of suitable store locations, Wal-Mart began a price war to drive small competitors out of business.
The intention was to take over the stores of the insolvent supermarket chains and convert them into Wal-Mart stores.
One part of the price war was to introduce a private label called (cid:16)Smart Brand(cid:17) and sell most of these products below manufacturing costs.
The reaction of many competitors was to decrease their prices, which led to a pro(cid:28)t setback for the entire industry.
However, the Federal Cartel O(cid:30)ce interceded and stopped the price war because there is a law in Germany thatenjoinscompaniesfromsellinggoodsbelowmanufacturingcostsonacontinuingbasis(KnorrandArndt 2003).
Product/ service failure Wal-Mart planned to introduce a sophisticated customer service program which threatened many of its competitors because German discount supermarket chains often do not provide good customer service.
Therefore,goodcustomerservice,combinedwithlowprices,couldhavebeenanewmarketnicheinGermany.
One part of Wal-Mart’s customer service program was called the (cid:16)ten foot rule(cid:17).
Every ten feet, a service employee o(cid:27)ered some help to the customer (Knorr and Arndt 2003).
However, the customer reaction was rather negative, because customers who normally do their grocery shopping in discount supermarket chains areusedtoself-service.
Theydonotnecessarilyexpecttotalkwithemployees.
Therefore,the(cid:16)tenfootrule(cid:17) was perceived as rather annoying and did not result in a reputation for providing good customer service.
Wal-Mart also imported the idea of placing a (cid:16)greeter(cid:17) at the entrance to the store.
Again, German customers were not used to this custom, and they did not adopt this (cid:16)service(cid:17) with any enthusiasm.
Conclusion of Wal-Mart Mini-case Wal-Mart tried to apply its US success formula in an unmodi(cid:28)ed manner to the German market.
As a result, they didn’t have su(cid:30)cient knowledge about the market structure and key cultural / political issues.
In addition, structural factors prevented Wal-Mart from fully implementing its successful business model.
Also, there were some instances of product or service failure.
The (cid:28)nal outcome was that Wal-Mart had to abandon its o(cid:27)erings in Germany Reasons for Failure Examples of Wal-Mart in Germany continued on next page AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>247 Insu(cid:30)cient demand (MS / BM) Wal-Mart’s low price strategy didn’t create any competitiveadvantagesincemanyGermanlocalre- tailers were already using that strategy.

14.2 Globalization: opportunities and threats to developing country business2 14.2.1 Globalization: opportunities and threats to developing country business To succeed in business today, it is critical to understand the changing global business world and the envi- ronment in which a business operates.
Not only are entrepreneurs faced with the internal factors a(cid:27)ecting their business, they must also understand the external environment in which they operate.
IntheUnitedStatesandWesternEurope,globalizationhasbeenhighlycontroversialandsparkedprotests driven by fears of outsourcing jobs, ceding authority to international organizations and declining labor and environmental standards.
Views of globalization in lower income countries, however, are more positive.
A recent Pew survey found that there was more enthusiasm for foreign trade and investment in less industri- alized countries than in industrialized ones.
In sub-Saharan Africa, 56% of respondents thought, (cid:16)growing global trade and business ties are very good for my country (Dollar, 2003).
(cid:17) In developing countries in Asia, 37% had a positive view of globalization, while only 28% of respondents in the United States and Western Europe had such a view (Dollar, 2003).
This section discusses the concept of globalization and its positive and negative implications for developing country business.
This chapter will utilize examples of large corporations, as these (cid:28)rms incorporate all necessary aspects required to run a successful business.
14.2.1.1 What is globalization?
Globalization is di(cid:30)cult to de(cid:28)ne because it has many dimensions(cid:22)economic, political, cultural and envi- ronmental.
The focus here is on the economic dimension of globalization.
Economic globalization refers to the (cid:16)quickly rising share of economic activity in the world [that] seems to be taking place between people in di(cid:27)erent countries(cid:17) (World Bank Brie(cid:28)ng Paper, 2001).
More speci(cid:28)cally, economic globalization is the result of the increasing integration of economies around the world, particularly through trade and (cid:28)nancial (cid:29)ows and the movement of people and knowledge across international borders (IMF Issue Brief, 2000).

Ford’shistorydatesbacktotheModelTcreatedbyHenryFord,withthegoalofbuildingacarforevery family.
Today, Ford is in dire competition with not only their domestic competitors, but also now foreign car manufacturers such as Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai.
At the current pace, the automotive market is approaching a 50/50 split between United States and overseas-based control of the US market.
As a result, Ford is challenged to constantly reevaluate and revamp its market strategy.
This is evident, as Ford decided that it was more cost-e(cid:27)ective to buy existing networksthantostartfromscratch,bybringingJaguar,Volvo,Mazda,AstonMartinandLandRoverunder itscontrol.
However,FordhasrecentlydecidedtosellitsstakeinbothJaguarandLandRovertotheIndian automaker, Tata, and may divest other divisions as well.
Today, Ford faces a number of important questions.
As the globalization of the auto industry continues, how should Ford market its vehicles?
What target markets should Ford appeal to?
How can it continue to improve production and quality and adhere to the needs of even more demanding customers?
And, how should Ford position itself, as a company, in the face of formidable competition?
While the future of Ford is uncertain, one thing is clear, globalization will continue to a(cid:27)ect the way domestic and foreign companies do business.
Exhibit 14.2: Global Market Share, 2007-2008 (Edmunds.com, 2007) As this (cid:28)gure suggests, the (cid:16)Big Three(cid:17) must adapt to changes in the market and globalization factors to remain key players in the automotive market.
At one point in 2007, for the (cid:28)rst time in history, US automaker’s share of their home market fell below 50 percent.
14.2.1.3 Elements of economic globalization Thegrowthincross-bordereconomicactivitiestakes(cid:28)veprincipalforms: (1)internationaltrade; (2)foreign directinvestment;(3)capitalmarket(cid:29)ows;(4)migration(movementoflabor);and(5)di(cid:27)usionoftechnology (Stiglitz, 2003).
International trade: An increasing share of spending on goods and services is devoted to imports and an increasing share of what countries produce is sold as exports.
Between 1990 and 2001, the percentage of AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>254 CHAPTER 14. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR exportsandimportsintotaleconomicoutput(GDP)rosefrom32.3percentto37.9percentinindustrialized countries,andfrom33.8percentto48.9percentinlowandmiddle-incomecountries(WorldBrie(cid:28)ngPaper, 2001).
Inthe1980s,about20percentofindustrializedcountries’exportswenttolessindustrializedcountries; today,thissharehasrisentoabout25percent,anditappearslikelytoexceed33percentby2010(Qureshi, 1996).
The importance of International trade lies at the root of a country’s economy.
In the constant changing businessmarket,countriesarenowmoreinterdependentthaneverontheirpartnersforexporting,importing, thereby keeping the home country’s economy a(cid:29)oat and healthy.
For example, China’s economy is heavily dependent on the exportation of goods to the United States, and the United States customer base who will buy these products.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): According to the United Nations, FDI is de(cid:28)ned as (cid:16)investment made to acquire lasting interest in enterprises operating outside of the economy of the investor(cid:17).
Direct investment in constructing production facilities, is distinguished from portfolio investment, which can take the form of short-term capital (cid:29)ows (e.g.
loans), or long-term capital (cid:29)ows (e.g.
bonds) (Stiglitz, 2003).
Since 1980, global (cid:29)ows of foreign direct investment have more than doubled relative to GDP (World Brie(cid:28)ng Paper, 2001).
Capital market (cid:29)ows: In many countries, particularly in the developed world, investors have increas- ingly diversi(cid:28)ed their portfolios to include foreign (cid:28)nancial assets, such as international bonds, stocks or mutual funds, and borrowers have increasingly turned to foreign sources of funds (World Brie(cid:28)ng, Paper, 2001).
Capitalmarket(cid:29)owsalsoincluderemittancesfrommigration,whichtypically(cid:29)owfromindustrialized to less industrialized countries.
In essence, the entrepreneur has a number of sources for funding a business.
Migration: WhetheritisphysicianswhoemigratefromIndiaandPakistantoGreatBritainorseasonal farm workers emigrating from Mexico to the United States, labor is increasingly mobile.
Migration can bene(cid:28)t developing economies when migrants who acquired education and know-how abroad return home to establish new enterprises.
However, migration can also hurt the economy through (cid:16)brain drain(cid:17), the loss of skilled workers who are essential for economic growth (Stiglitz, 2003).
Di(cid:27)usion of technology: Innovations in telecommunications, information technology, and computing haveloweredcommunicationcostsandfacilitatedthecross-border(cid:29)owofideas,includingtechnicalknowledge as well as more fundamental concepts such as democracy and free markets (Stiglitz, 2003).
The rapid growth and adoption of information technology, however, is not evenly distributed around the world(cid:22)this gap between the information technology is often referred to as the (cid:16)digital divide(cid:17).
As a result, for less industrialized countries this means it is more di(cid:30)cult to advance their businesses without the technical system and knowledge in place such as the Internet, data tracking, and technical resources already existing in many industrialized countries.
14.2.1.4 Negative e(cid:27)ects of globalization for developing country business Critics of global economic integration warn that (Watkins, 2002, Yusuf, 2001): • the growth of international trade is exacerbating income inequalities, both between and within indus- trialized and less industrialized nations • globalcommerceisincreasinglydominatedbytransnationalcorporationswhichseektomaximizepro(cid:28)ts without regard for the development needs of individual countries or the local populations • protectionist policies in industrialized countries prevent many producers in the Third World from accessing export markets; • the volume and volatility of capital (cid:29)ows increases the risks of banking and currency crises, especially in countries with weak (cid:28)nancial institutions • competition among developing countries to attract foreign investment leads to a (cid:16)race to the bottom(cid:17) in which countries dangerously lower environmental standards • culturaluniquenessislostinfavorofhomogenizationanda(cid:16)universalculture(cid:17) thatdrawsheavilyfrom American culture AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>255 Critics of economic integration often point to Latin America as an example where increased openness to international trade had a negative economic e(cid:27)ect.
Many governments in Latin America (e.g.
Peru) liber- alized imports far more rapidly than in other regions.
In much of Latin America, import liberalization has been credited with increasing the number of people living below the USD $1 a day poverty line and has perpetuated already existing inequalities (Watkins, 2002).
14.2.1.5 Positive e(cid:27)ects of globalization for developing country business Conversely, globalization can create new opportunities, new ideas, and open new markets that an en- trepreneur may have not had in their home country.
As a result, there are a number of positives associated with globalization: • it creates greater opportunities for (cid:28)rms in less industrialized countries to tap into more and larger markets around the world • this can lead to more access to capital (cid:29)ows, technology, human capital, cheaper imports and larger export markets • itallowsbusinessesinlessindustrializedcountriestobecomepartofinternationalproductionnetworks and supply chains that are the main conduits of trade For example, the experience of the East Asian economies demonstrates the positive e(cid:27)ect of globalization on economic growth and shows that at least under some circumstances globalization decreases poverty.
The spectacular growth in East Asia, which increased GDP per capita by eightfold and raised millions of people out of poverty, was based largely on globalization(cid:22)export-led growth and closing the technology gap with industrialized countries (Stiglitz, 2003).
Generally, economies that globalize have higher growth rates than non-globalizers (Bhagwati and Srinivasan, 2002).
Also, the role of developing country (cid:28)rms in the value chain is becoming increasingly sophisticated as these (cid:28)rms expand beyond manufacturing into services.
For example, it is now commonplace for businesses in industrialized countries to outsource functions such as data processing, customer service and reading x- rays to India and other less industrialized countries (Bhagwati et al, 2004).
Advanced telecommunications and the Internet are facilitating the transfer of these service jobs from industrialized to less industrialized and making it easier and cheaper for less industrialized country (cid:28)rms to enter global markets.
In addition to bringing in capital, outsourcing helps prevent (cid:16)brain drain(cid:17) because skilled workers may choose to remain in their home country rather than having to migrate to an industrialized country to (cid:28)nd work.
Further, some of the allegations made by critics of globalization are very much in dispute(cid:22)for example, that globalization necessarily leads to growing income inequality or harm to the environment.
While there aresomecountriesinwhicheconomicintegrationhasledtoincreasedinequality(cid:22)China,forinstance(cid:22)there isnoworldwidetrend(Dollar,2003).
Withregardtotheenvironment,internationaltradeandforeigndirect investment can provide less industrialized countries with the incentive to adopt, and the access to, new technologies that may be more ecologically sound (World Bank Brie(cid:28)ng Paper, 2001).

No other advertising medium reaches as many people as the Internet.
Using specialized software and other tools, it is now easier than ever to build and run a successful website without a high level of computer skills.
Typical information found on a company’s website includes a description of the (cid:28)rm, a pro(cid:28)le of the management team, products and services o(cid:27)ered, and the way customers can contact the company.
Phone, Fax and SMS Companies in less industrialized countries may not have viable access to the Internet due to a lack of infrastructure.
For entrepreneurs facing this issue, phone, fax and SMS text messages are alternative ways in which to do business.
Doing business via phone and fax is not di(cid:30)cult.
Companies can send marketing materials or receive orders via fax.
The use of phone for marketing and sales options is also very useful.
Cold calls for marketing are still e(cid:27)ective; likewise orders can be made and received over the telephone.

Itisessentialtotakethesedi(cid:27)erencesseriouslyandnotassumethatindividuals have similar values.
14.4.1.1 Host country research and cultural implications Cultural issues can be divided into two categories, explicit and implicit.
Explicit culture issues are related to characteristics that one can see or perceive.
Implicit culture issues, on the other hand, are related to attitudes and values, symbolized in the (cid:28)gure below.
Exhibit 14.5: The Onion Metaphor of Culture (Ulijn and Fayolle, 2004) Explicit culture exists on the outer layer and is the observable reality of the language, food, buildings, houses, monuments, agriculture, shrines, markets, fashions and art.
These products are visible in people’s behaviors, clothes, food, music and theater.

Values determine good from bad, and are closely related to the ideals shared by a group.
A value in one culture may di(cid:27)er vastly from that of another, and therefore these di(cid:27)erences must be studied and taken into consideration when doing business across cultures.
14.4.1.2 Cross-culture training Thecreationofastableandhealthyworkplacemadeupofpeopleofvaryingculturalbackgroundsisamatter of increasing importance in the global business environment.
Employers must take into consideration the impactculturaldiversitycanhaveonboththehomogeneityoftheworkplaceandpotentiallegalimplications for improper discrimination.
The objective of training programs is to foster the four characteristics of preparedness, sensitivity, pa- tience, and (cid:29)exibility in managers and other personnel (Czinkota et al, 2005).
Methods of training may range from factual preparation involving books and lectures to experiential training involving simulations and (cid:28)eld experience.
Some topics to be addressed in training might be, but are not limited to: • comfort levels of trainees’ with people of a di(cid:27)erent background • impact of trainees’ behaviors on others • understanding stereotypes • transforming knowledge into empathy • embracing diversity as a source of strength • learning a new language Businesses with diverse cultural backgrounds must maintain an environment suited for every constituent so that the objectives of the business can be e(cid:30)ciently met.
Installing cultural diversity training programs can help accomplish this by de(cid:28)ning what cultural intelligence is, teaching employees to accept and work e(cid:27)ectively with others from di(cid:27)erent cultural backgrounds, and taking advantage of advice from those who have cross-cultural experience.
14.4.1.3 Cultural classi(cid:28)cation Cultures can either be distinguished according to descriptive characteristics or they can be broken up into value categories, which are essentially dimensions of national culture.
14.4.1.4 Hofstede’s Five dimensions of national culture Geert Hofstede, a leading expert in cultural values classi(cid:28)cation, developed a model of (cid:28)ve dimensions of natural culture that help to explain basic value di(cid:27)erences in culture.
The model distinguishes cultures according to the following (cid:28)ve di(cid:27)erent dimensions: • Power distance • Individualism/collectivism • Masculinity/femininity • Uncertainty avoidance • Long-term orientation AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>260 CHAPTER 14. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR Exhibit 14.6: Hofstede’s (cid:28)ve cultural dimensions 14.4.1.5 Hofstede’s 5 Cultural Dimensions The Power Distance Index (PDI) focuses on the degree of equality, or inequality, between people in the country’s society.
The Individualism (IDV) focuses on the degree the society reinforces individual or collec- tive, achievement and interpersonal relationships.
The Masculinity (MAS) focuses on the degree the society reinforces, or does not reinforce, the traditional masculine work role model of male achievement, control, and power.
The Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI) focuses on the level of tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity within the society.
These dimensions are measured on a scale from 0 to 100, include 75 countries or regions, and scores are determined by (cid:16)high(cid:17) or (cid:16)low(cid:17) rankings within each category.
Cultural values determine the way people think and behave.
International marketers must understand many subtle di(cid:27)erences that may a(cid:27)ect the way their marketing is made and perceived in foreign markets.
One medium in which many such di(cid:27)erences reside is language.
Because language is a re(cid:29)ection of culture, somewordscannotbecross-culturallytranslated,whichimpliesthatitisoftenbettertohavelocalcopywrit- ers write and translate marketing and advertising content to avoid cultural misunderstandings.
Because of this phenomenon, global advertising, which is a main component of global marketing, often relies on symbol recognition to convey meaning in their ads, instead of words.

First, the concept of culture is de(cid:28)ned, second, the various components of culture are identi(cid:28)ed, and third, vivid examples of cultural di(cid:27)erences are provided.
The dire consequences of (cid:28)rms not taking these di(cid:27)erences into account are invariably described, as adherence to local culture is considered one of the most important, if not the most important, components of success in international marketing (Hofstede, 1996).

Although ethical values may be similar across cultures in many cases, the application of those values to certain situations may vary.
Ethics can be described as the science of human duty.
It is upon the ethical standards of a person that judges whether or not an action is right or wrong.
Before a company does business across borders, it must (cid:28)rst decide what its motivation is regarding ethical conduct, which will determine what kind of behavior is to be expected from employees.
14.5 Political and legal risk in international business5 Politicalandlegalrisksaretwoveryimportantaspectsofrunningabusinessofwhichanentrepreneurshould be aware.
Failure to recognize these risks and adjust accordingly could potentially hinder the performance of the overall business.
14.5.1 What is political risk?
Political risk is generally de(cid:28)ned as the risk to business interests resulting from political instability or political change.
Political risk exists in every country around the globe and varies in magnitude and type from country to country.
Political risks may arise from policy changes by governments to change controls imposedonexchangeratesandinterestrates(Barlettetal,2004).
Moreover,politicalriskmaybecausedby actionsoflegitimategovernmentssuchascontrolsonprices,outputs,activities,andcurrencyandremittance restrictions.

A company developing a business plan may have di(cid:27)erent elements of all three categories depending on the type of product or service.
The choice of entry depends on the (cid:28)rm’s experience, the nature of its product or services, capital resources, and the amount of risk it’s willing to consider (Scha(cid:27)er et al, 2005).
The risk between these three categories of market entry varies signi(cid:28)cantly with trade ranked the least risky if the company does not have o(cid:30)ces overseas and does not keep inventories there.
On the other side of the spectrum is direct foreign investment, which generally brings the greatest economic exposure and thus the greatest risk to the company.
14.5.2.2 Protection from political risk Companies can reduce their exposure to political risk by careful planning and monitoring political develop- ments.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR The country’s standing in the international arena should also be part of the consideration; this includes its relations with neighbors, border disputes, membership in international organizations, and recognition of international law.
If the company does not have the resources to conduct such research and analysis, it may (cid:28)nd such information at their foreign embassies, international chambers of commerce, political risk consulting (cid:28)rms, insurance companies, and from international businessmen familiar with a particular re- gion.
In some countries, the governments will establish agencies to help private businesses grow overseas.
Governments may also o(cid:27)er political risk insurance to promote exports or economic development.
Private businesses may also purchase political risk insurance from insurance companies specialized in international business.
Insurance companies o(cid:27)eringpolitical risk insurance will generally provide coverage against incon- vertibility, expropriation and political violence, including civil strife (US Small Business Administration).
Careful planning and vigilance should be part of any company’s preparation for developing an international presence.
14.5.2.3 Government policy changes and trade relations A government makes changes in policies that have an impact on international business.
Many reasons may cause governments to change their policies toward foreign enterprises.
High unemployment, widespread poverty, nationalistic pressure, and political unrest are just a few of the reasons that can lead to changes in policy.

This Alert provides highlights of the new law and the e(cid:27)ect it will have on employees’ rights and their employer’s legal liability.
14.5.1 Introduction On June 29, 2007 at the 28th session of the standing committee of the 10th National People’s Congress, a new employment contract law was adopted which took take e(cid:27)ect on 1 Jauary 2008.
This law requires all employers to enter into contracts with their employees within 30 days of full- time employment and sets out guidelines for their implementation.
By incorporating new legal provisions with existing laws from the current PRC labor law, the committee hopes to meet three main objectives: (1) to clarify the employment contract system by clearly identifying both the employer and the employee litigation rights and duties (2) provide protection of an employee’s legitimaterightsandinterestsand(3)constructanddevelopharmonious/stableworkrelations.
All regulations that a(cid:27)ect employees such as compensation, work hours, rest, leave, work safety and hygiene, insurance, bene(cid:28)ts, employee training, work discipline or work quota management must be approved by the employee representative congress or by all the employees and determined with a trade union (to be established by all employers) or employee representatives.

If the employee(s) they placed su(cid:27)ers harm as a result, both the sta(cid:30)ng (cid:28)rm and company that accepted the employee shall be jointly and severally liable for damages.
• A contractor hiring employees in violation of the law who su(cid:27)er harm will result in joint liability for the organization that employed such contractor and the contractor.
• Negligence on the part of a labor administration authority to act in accordance with the law will also result in them bearing liability.
Penalties for an Employer’s Non-Compliance Within the new law there are (cid:28)nancial penalties for non-compliance with the terms of em- ployer/employee contract guidelines, which include failure to conclude a written contract within the 30 day period, setting an illegal probationary period, illegally retaining an employee’s resident ID card or other papers, etc.
An employer that fails to pay an employee his salary, pays below the local minimum wage rate, fails to pay overtime or terminates a contract without paying the employee severance or without cause will also pay varying damages as stipulated in the new law.

In order to minimize exposure to legal risks arising from confusion and excess cost, a company should seek legal advice if possible.
In making such arrangements, written contracts should be used.

14.6.3 Global marketing: assessing potential markets overseas 14.6.3.1 Case: Toyota has a vehicle for every market Each market has unique cultural characteristics and contextual circumstances that must be considered.
For example, in the United States roads tend to be wide; highways can accommodate a broad array of vehicles with a high number of lanes, and people demand a mix of cars based on their needs.
Conversely, in Europe roads tend to be narrow, and the market demands smaller, more fuel-e(cid:30)cient vehicles.
Therefore, while a Toyota 4Runner tends to sell extremely well in the United States, it would not be a very popular model in Europe for these very reasons.
As a result, Toyota invests billions of dollars every year into market research and market development to make sure they meet the needs and wants of its customers, in each speci(cid:28)c 6Thiscontentisavailableonlineat<http://cnx.org/content/m35599/1.5/>.

14.6.3.2 What is global marketing?
Oneoftheinevitablequestionsthatsurfacesconcerningglobalmarketingis: howdoesglobalmarketingtruly di(cid:27)erfromdomesticmarketing,ifatall?
Therehashistoricallybeenmuchdiscussionovercommonalitiesand di(cid:27)erences between global and domestic marketing, but the three most common points of view upon which scholars agree are the following.
First, all marketing is about the formulation and implementation of the basic policies known as the 4 P’s: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.
Second, international marketing, unlike domestic marketing, is understood to be carried out (cid:16)across borders(cid:17).
Third, international marketing is not synonymous with international trade (Perry, 1990).
Perhaps the best way to distinguish between the two is simply to focus on the textbook de(cid:28)nition of international marketing.
One comprehensive de(cid:28)nition states that, (cid:16)international marketing means identifying needs and wants of customers in di(cid:27)erent markets and cultures, providing products, services, technologies, and ideas to give the (cid:28)rm a competitive marketing advantage, communicating information about these products and services and distributing and exchanging them internationally through one or a combination of foreign market entry modes (Bradley, 2005)(cid:17).
14.6.3.3 The 4 P’S of the Marketing Mix (NetMBA, 2008) Exhibit 14.7: The 4 P’s: Product, Price, Place and Promotion are aspects of the marketing mix that are generally controllable As the following table demonstrates, many decisions a(cid:27)ect the marketing mix (NetMBA, 2008): AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>266 CHAPTER 14.

The marketing mix will appropriately vary as di(cid:27)erent circumstances dictate.
14.6.3.4 Importance of culture on markets Becauseinternationalmarketingiscloselycorrelatedtotheculturesinwhicha(cid:28)rmwishestosellitsproduct, culture itself must be analyzed to understand the best way to integrate into both existing and emerging foreign markets.
There are (cid:28)ve essential areas within which culture must be continually studied in order to achieve success in dealing with culture as it a(cid:27)ects international marketing.
These are (Tian, 2008): • culture impacts on marketing (international versus domestic) • cross-cultural dimensions of marketing research • cross-cultural aspects of marketing mix (products, price, promotion, and place) • cross-cultural marketing education and professional training • and cross-cultural practice in electronic marketing note: Cross-cultural marketing occurs when a consumer’s culture di(cid:27)ers from that of the mar- keter’s own culture.
Consumer behavior diverges across country lines with increased wealth, globalization, and technology; it does not converge (De Mooij, 2005).
This simple fact proves the importance of culture knowledge in cross-cultural marketing endeavors.
In fact, the importance of cross-cultural study has inspired a de(cid:28)nition separate from that of international marketing.
Cross-cultural marketing is de(cid:28)ned as the strategic process of marketing among consumers whose culture di(cid:27)ers from that of the marketer’s own culture at least in one of the fundamental cultural aspects, such as language, religion, social norms and values, education, and the living style (Tian, 2008).
A standardized marketing model utilizes the same functions in all markets.
Conversely, a customized marketing strategy adheres to the needs and wants of a particular target market.

In most countries and cultures, marketers do not compete with individual products, but rather with competing brands markets.

Themainargumentsincludethatsaleswillincreasewhen a company can market a consistent product image across di(cid:27)erent geographical markets, and that cost can bereducedthroughtheformulationandimplementationofasinglestandardizedmarketingplan.
Stillothers argue that because few markets are comparable across country lines, it is necessary to adapt the marketing mix to ensure that su(cid:30)cient customization exists to satisfy consumer needs in each market.
Additionally, not all companies are able to adopt a standardized strategy as its appropriateness varies from industry to industry.
One must remember that even within markets there is great diversity of behavior and taste.
In the face of intensely increasing competition and globalization, studies show that people increasingly prefer brands with roots in their national or regional tradition.
This would indicate that most (cid:28)rms should lean towardsmarketingcustomizationinordertosatisfytheincreasinglynationalisticconsumptiontendenciesof their consumers (Bradley, 2005).

14.7 Global (cid:28)nance: initial considerations7 14.7.1 Global (cid:28)nance: initial considerations As the global economy has become more integrated, every company and individual is a(cid:27)ected by the de- velopments of the markets and the economies of countries other than their own.
Entrepreneurs willing to venture into the global (cid:28)nancial marketplace may (cid:28)nd lower-cost (cid:28)nancing alternatives than are available in their home country.
They may also want to obtain (cid:28)nancing in the local markets they choose to serve.
As a result, with constant economic changes, and (cid:29)uctuations in the marketplace, along with trade barriers being lowered around the world, the entrepreneurs of tomorrow cannot limit their (cid:28)nance knowledge to just their home country, but can be open to looking at alternative sources to fund their business operations.
En- trepreneurs will (cid:28)nd that understanding the functioning of the global (cid:28)nancial marketplace is a key element of their knowledge and skill base, and a key aspect of furthering their business.
14.7.1.1 International currency market Exchange rates The price of one country’s currency in units of another country’s currency is known as a foreign currency exchange rate.
Exchange rates can be quoted in two ways.
One way, known as a direct quote, is to state the numberofdomesticunitsofcurrencyperoneunitofforeigncurrency.
Ifanexchangerateisanindirectquote, the exchange rate is stated as the number of foreign units per one unit of domestic currency (Beenhakker, 2001).

The Forex is a (cid:28)nancial market where the participants exchange one monetary unit for another currency.
The market operates continuously, 24 hours a day, because a (cid:28)nancial center is always open somewhere in the world.
The interconnection of the markets makes continuous trading possible (Carrada- Bravo, 2003).
The foreign exchange market is generally divided into (cid:28)ve basic currency markets based on pricing procedures ruling the exchange, the time to maturity, the degree of freedom available, the convertibility of currencies, and how the currencies are quoted (Carrada-Bravo, 2003).

14.7.1.3 Introduction to currency risk Currency risk is the potential consequence from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates (Coyle, 2000).
Organizations are exposed to currency risk when involved, directly or indirectly, in international trade and (cid:28)nance.
Currency risk arises because exchange rates are volatile in the short and the long-term and the future movements of exchange rates cannot be predicted.
Companies will as a result su(cid:27)er losses due to adverse exchange rate movements when exposed to foreign currencies (Coyle, 2000).
Hedging is the term used to describe the actions that reduce or eliminate an exposure to risk (Coyle, 2000).
Common ways of hedging currency risk involve: • transferring the risk to your trading partner by placing the transaction in your domestic currency • structurally hedging your risk by o(cid:27) setting income against expenditure in the same currency • purchasing derivatives in the foreign exchange market (Coyle, 2000) 14.7.1.4 Introduction to derivatives A (cid:28)nancial derivative is a (cid:28)nancial instrument where the price is derived from the value of an underlying asset often used to manage risk exposure.
There are three classes of derivatives.
Futures: A futures contract is a (cid:16)commitment to exchange a speci(cid:28)ed amount of one asset for a speci(cid:28)ed amount of another asset at a speci(cid:28)ed time in the future(cid:17) (Butler, 2003).
Options: An options contract (cid:16)gives the option holder the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a speci(cid:28)ed price and on a speci(cid:28)ed date(cid:17) (Butler, 2003).
Swaps: A swap is an (cid:16)agreement to exchange two liabilities (or assets) and, after a prearranged length of time, to re-exchange the liabilities (or assets)(cid:17) (Butler, 2003).

This task becomes even more complex when a company decides to do business across national borders.
Asmallbusinessownermaystartoutastheonlyemployeeinhisorhercompany.
Inthiscaseorganization and sta(cid:30)ng simply involves the e(cid:30)cient allocation of the owner’s time and attention to the various tasks associated with the business.
As the company grows, more employees will probably be hired.
When this occurs, it is useful to explicitly look at how tasks can be allocated across employees in a systematic way.
As the company grows still larger, it is often useful to begin organizing the company into departments.
Inmanycases,acompany’searlymovesoverseasinvolvereactingtoanapparentlyrandomorunexpected overseas business opportunity.
At (cid:28)rst, such business may be conducted anywhere in the organization on an ad hoc basis.
As a company extends its operations overseas, it takes on additional complexity as decisions have to be made which address global and local product design, local responsiveness to individual markets, cross-border (cid:28)nancing, etc.
As the international side of the business grows, many companies conclude that a reorganization of some type can better handle the current international business demands, and better position the company to take full advantage of international opportunities as they arise.
In the following section, several common international organization structures are brie(cid:29)y described.
14.8.1.1 International division Perhaps the simplest start for many organizations is to adopt what is known as an international division.
With the addition of an international division, the domestic organization may remain relatively unchanged while an additional side structure is added.
This additional structure (in collaboration with the domestic structure) takes on the responsibility for virtually all international business.
This structure assumes that thereareskillsassociatedwithdoingbusinessoverseasthatwilltranscendthetypicalbusinesslines.
Market assessments, compliance with export/import regulations, arranging shipping, identi(cid:28)cation of local repre- sentatives, establishment of dedicated sales o(cid:30)ces, production facilities, etc.
are all examples of tasks often assigned to the international division.
Advantages: The international division is e(cid:27)ective in consolidating international activity under one area ofresponsibility.
Suchadivisiondevelopsinternationalexpertisethatcanserveallareasoftheorganization.
This eliminates the need for every part of the organization to master the ins and outs of doing business overseas (this can sometimes be quite complex).
Disadvantages: Ontheotherhand,theexistenceofaninternationaldivisionencouragestheorganization to approach their business in an arti(cid:28)cially dichotomous manner.
Part of the business organization focuses primarilyonthehomecountrymarket,whiletheinternationaldivisionserves(cid:16)therestoftheworld(cid:17).
Inmost organizations such a structure lends itself to a continuing preoccupation with the home country market.
As a company becomes more serious about overseas business, it often (cid:28)nds it useful to adopt a more sophisticated global structure.
Four examples of such organizations are included below.

AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>272 CHAPTER 14. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR 14.8.1.2 Global functional structure A global functional structure is often adopted by companies with a very limited product scope.
A CEO will oversee a number of business functions that have been identi(cid:28)ed as critical to business operations.
Because the product mix is singular or limited, the CEO can coordinate the work of the functions and bring the resources of each to bear on the product line.
In this case, the CEO serves as the common denominator between the functions.
Advantages: In many organizations, the primary sources of expertise are functionally based.
Therefore, economies of scale can be achieved by grouping these resources by function.
In the case of human resources, for instance, a central human resources function can serve as a consultant to all parts of the organization on issues such as pay and performance evaluation.
This eliminates the redundancy occurring when multiple parts of the organization attempt to develop such programs on their own.
A functional organization also enablestheorganizationtostandardizepolicies,practicesandproceduresthatcanbecarriedoutthroughout the organization.
Disadvantages: Theprimaryfocusonbusinessfunctionalactivity,oftendistractsorganizationsfromspe- ci(cid:28)c product requirements, customer needs, and geographic idiosyncrasies.

Exhibit 14.9: A global structure 14.8.1.3 Product structure Aglobalproductstructureisoftenchosenincompanieswithanarrayofdiverseproductlines.
Eachproduct line is assigned to its own organization unit so that decision-making is focused on the product characteristic and the customers who will be targeted.
In many cases, the product unit will have its own functional organization(cid:22)in essence, operating as a stand alone business in the context of the larger organization.
In many cases, a product unit will be managed with full pro(cid:28)t and loss responsibility.
Advantages: Themainadvantageofaproductstructureisthatitfocusesattentionandresourcestoward a single product and the customers toward which that product is targeted.
Decisions are optimized for the success of the product and distractions are minimized.
Disadvantages: Redundancies often exist across product organizations as functional responsibilities are AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>273 duplicated under each product organization.
Economies of scale and scope are more di(cid:30)cult to achieve as this organization structure encourages less cooperation and coordination across the product units.
Exhibit 14.10: A product structure 14.8.1.4 Area/geographic structure: Anareastructureisoftenchosenbycompanieswhowanttoemphasizegeographicallyspeci(cid:28)cstrategiesand focusdecision-making on local needs.
Organizations may bedivided up intoregional and country structures where country managers operate rather autonomous businesses supported by an array of local functions.
In this case, the country organization often operates as a fairly self-contained business with substantial local authority as well as pro(cid:28)t and loss responsibility.
Advantages: The country organization is capable of sensing and understanding local conditions and is able to formulate strategies which e(cid:27)ectively meet the needs of local stakeholders.
Policies in areas such as humanresourcemanagementcanbetailoredtomeettheneedsandexpectationsoflocalemployees,product mix and design can be optimized for local conditions, and the organization can respond more quickly to changing circumstances on the ground.
Disadvantages: The disadvantages of the area structure are similar to those of the product structure.
Economies of scale will be harder to achieve as di(cid:27)erent localities develop and implement very di(cid:27)erent product strategies on one hand, and invest resources in developing local functional expertise and e(cid:27)ort which may well be duplicated unnecessarily across geographic units.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR Exhibit 14.11: Area/geographic structure 14.8.1.5 Matrix structure: A matrix structure is often adopted in organizations that would like to optimize decisions across multiple organization dimensions.
In other words, they would like to achieve economies of scale where appropriate, but do not want to lose the ability to respond to product/customer and geographic needs more e(cid:27)ectively.
A matrix organization simultaneously utilizes two or more dimensions (product, geographic, function, etc.)
toorganizethecompany’swork.
Inthiscase,twoormoredimensionsmayhavedirectlinkstothehead of the organization (see Exhibit 14.1) and key individuals throughout the organization may actually report to more than one dimension.
As can be seen in Exhibit 14.1, the orange juice product manager reports to the head of the organization, as does the head of the (cid:28)nance function.
In this example, the (cid:28)nance o(cid:30)cer in the orange juice product group reports to two individuals: the head of (cid:28)nance and the head of the orange juice group.
At the same time, a geographic dimension may require that the function and product heads interact as coequals with any number of country managers or regional heads as well.
Advantages: The matrix allows functional e(cid:30)ciencies to be achieved while also allowing for the manage- ment of discrete product lines.
Product managers remain focused on speci(cid:28)c customer and product issues, yet can tap into the specialized support systems o(cid:27)ered by strong functions.
Where a geographic dimen- sion is included in the structure, country managers or other local personnel can devote their attention to the development of location speci(cid:28)c strategies.
Communication and information sharing may be facilitated through the multiple dimensions.
Disadvantages: The matrix is complex and often involves additional coordination costs.
Confusion and ambiguity may result from multiple reporting relationships as a single individual may receive con(cid:29)icting direction from their various supervisors.

While some type of hierarchy exists at the heart of most organization designs, many organizations are (cid:28)nding that the typical pyramid shaped organization no longer meets their needs.
They are looking for options that allow greater (cid:29)exibility and responsiveness.
Such organizations may legitimize informal rela- tionships between various organizational parts and levels.
They may rely more on teams as coordinating mechanisms and they may actively encourage collaboration and sharing across business units.
Successful global organizations in the 21st century will balance hierarchical control (which remains critical in most organizations) on one hand, with less rigidity, more (cid:29)exibility and emphasis on individual empowerment on the other.
14.8.1.7 Sta(cid:30)ng choices in a globally far-(cid:29)ung company Sta(cid:30)ng choices in a far-(cid:29)ung global company are more complex as well.
Issues of cost, cultural savvy, familiarity with local conditions, language skill, family issues, and more must all be considered carefully as sta(cid:30)ng decisions are made.
In addition to many of the standard human resources challenges that inevitably arise, determining where employees will be sourced from represents one of the most important decisions facing companies as they set up operations abroad.
In general, employees may come from any of the following sources: the headquarters (home) country, the host (local) country, or a third country (neither home, nor host).
These choices are outlined brie(cid:29)y below.
Ethnocentric sta(cid:30)ng involves sta(cid:30)ng overseas positions with home country personnel.
These (cid:16)expa- triates(cid:17) are usually assigned to fairly senior or technical positions in the overseas organization.
An example of this sta(cid:30)ng choice would be when a Japanese company sets up an o(cid:30)ce in the United States and sends a Japanese executive from their headquarters in Tokyo to sta(cid:27) the new o(cid:30)ce in Chicago.
Advantages: Home country sta(cid:27), when sent overseas, are familiar with the home country operations and culture.
Because of this, they may be able to better communicate with headquarters, access needed resources, and tap into a home-country network.
In addition, the home country may know these people well from past collaboration that can lead to high levels of trust and con(cid:28)dence between the parties.
Familiarity with the company often means that these individuals bring special company-speci(cid:28)c expertise along with them, as well as technical skills and knowledge related to the company’s product o(cid:27)ering.
They may also bring general technical, or managerial skills that may be in short supply in the host country.
Ethnocentric sta(cid:30)ng o(cid:27)ers the additional bene(cid:28)t of building a global mindset among the home country workforce.
Those individuals who are sent overseas as expatriates will often return home with a more globalized perspective.
Disadvantages: Home country employees are expensive.
Many companies estimate that sending an expatriate overseas costs about 2-5 times their annual salary.
This means that sending an executive and theirfamilyoverseascancosthundredsofthousandsofdollarsormoreperyear.
Thehomecountryemployee is usually less familiar with the local culture and employment conditions, and the employee and the family may (cid:28)nd it hard to adapt to the new local living and working conditions.
In fact, according to widely AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>276 CHAPTER 14. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR cited research, failure of the spouse and of the family to adapt to local cultural di(cid:27)erences are two of the most frequent reasons that an employee assigned to an overseas post will fail to complete their assignment.
Ethnocentric sta(cid:30)ng practices are also sometimes criticized for preventing talented local employees from (cid:28)lling the positions held by expatriates.
Polycentricsta(cid:30)nginvolveshiringlocalpersonnelto(cid:28)llneededoverseaspositions.
Forexample,under this model, a South African company setting up an o(cid:30)ce in Brazil would hire a Brazilian to (cid:28)ll an open position.
Advantages: A polycentric sta(cid:30)ng strategy is much less expensive than the ethnocentric model.
Reloca- tion costs are usually much lower and a standard compensation package consistent with the local market is usually su(cid:30)cient.
Local employees are usually more familiar with the local culture and language and may have access to networks and relationships with local stakeholders.
Disadvantages: Talent is often short in host countries.
Lack of familiarity with the home country con- ditions, culture and language may become a barrier to e(cid:27)ective communication with the headquarters sta(cid:27).
Lack of familiarity with headquarters operations may make it di(cid:30)cult for the local sta(cid:27) to access needed resources and assistance.
Geocentric sta(cid:30)ng involvessta(cid:30)ngalocationwithoutregardfortheemployees’placeoforigin.
Com- panies simply scan their global workforce for the best quali(cid:28)ed candidate to (cid:28)ll a position.
In this model, a Chinese company might (cid:28)ll a position in their Mexico o(cid:30)ce with an employee from the United Kingdom.
Advantages: The geocentric model o(cid:27)ers the most employment (cid:29)exibility and choice to the company.
The company can search the entire global workforce to (cid:28)nd the most quali(cid:28)ed candidate for a certain position.

Disadvantages: Geocentric sta(cid:30)ng can be as expensive as ethnocentric sta(cid:30)ng practices.
Employees and families often have to be relocated across country boundaries and long distances.
Geocentrically placed employees may be unfamiliar with local practices.
Regiocentric sta(cid:30)ng involves sta(cid:30)ng within a global region.
In this case, a Korean company might (cid:28)ll a position in Italy with a Spanish employee.
Advantages: Moves are often made over shorter distances as employees are relocated.
Cultural and linguistic di(cid:27)erences may be less pronounced.
Employees gain the bene(cid:28)ts of cross-cultural experience as they work outside their home country.
Disadvantages: Costs of relocation often remain fairly high.
While cross-cultural perspective is built, a truly global perspective may still be lacking.
It is also important to note that cultural and language di(cid:27)erences will often be signi(cid:28)cant factors even within region.
All of the above models have strengths and weaknesses which must be seriously considered.
In most companies with multiple employees in overseas locations a mixed strategy will often make the most sense both in terms of e(cid:30)ciency and e(cid:27)ectiveness.
A few select positions may best be (cid:28)lled with either home countryorthirdcountrynationalswhilethevastmajorityofemploymentpositionsareusually(cid:28)lledbylocal employees.

As the global environment continues to develop, MNCs are challenged to address the shortage in global skills and cross-cultural communication barriers.
The successful MNC will be able to adapt to the changing environment by globalizing their HR systems and function, and globalizing the workforce mindset.
These e(cid:27)orts must also be aligned with business and organizational objectives and will require HR professionals to adopt a new way of thinking to identify and implement new ways of getting work done.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>277 HR systems in the MNC must be aligned with global business imperatives both in terms of pay and performance systems.
As the number of overseas transfers increases, MNCs must look to develop general policies and compensation packages rather than negotiating these on a case-by-case basis in order to obtain e(cid:30)ciency and consistency of process.
Systems must also be in place for succession planning on a local level as well as a global level.
Currently many MNCs are not operating an e(cid:27)ective expatriate pipeline, either not sending the most e(cid:27)ective individuals to host countries or failing the repatriate them e(cid:27)ectively.
The trend towards increasing reliance on integrated systems should contribute to better access across borders and regions to better serve expatriate relocation and business decisions.
Another opportunity for MNCs in regards to creating a global workforce will be to standardize and revisit current expatriate compensation packages to include soft bene(cid:28)ts.
Until now, individuals have often not been willing to take positions abroad because the incentives are solely (cid:28)nancial.
Historically, systems havenotbeeninplacetorepatriatesmoothlytheindividualandfamilyfollowingcompletionoftheiroverseas assignment.

This can be improved greatly simply by creating alignment and communication between the home and international HR department.
14.9 Corporate Social Responsibility and sustainable development in the global environment9 The topics surrounding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) have become more complex due to the glob- alization of the economy and the issues that arise from companies competing in international markets.
Companiesaremanufacturinggoods,hiringlocallabor,utilizingrawmaterialsandresourcesextractedfrom the environment in international locations.
This heightened awareness of CSR and sustainable development has been endorsed by an increased responsivenesstoethical,social,environmentalandotherglobalissues.
Inrecentyears,companieshavebeen the center of scandals regarding accounting practices, damages to the environment, inadequate treatment of employees and workers and the e(cid:27)ect of its products on the society.
For example, in January 2009, the Chairman of one of India’s largest technology companies, Satyam Computer Services Ltd., said he fabricated key (cid:28)nancial results, including a (cid:28)ctitious cash balance of more than USD 1 billion (Sheth, 2009).
Cases like this, and others such as Enron Corporation and Worldcom in theUnitedStates,promptconcernsaboutcorporategovernanceandaccountingstandardsglobally.
Further, corporate fraud puts into question one of the fundamental reasons of why shareholders invest in public companies, the need for transparency.
Asaresult,companiesarerespondingtoincreasedpublicexpectationsofresponsibilityandincorporating the concept of CSR into their operating plans and strategy.

This concept of CSR has evolved to include the organization’s responsibility for its impact on di(cid:27)erent stakeholders such as employees, customers, investors, local communities, and government.
A broader concept is that CSR involves the commitment on the part of the company to adopt behavior thatwillresultintheimprovementofthequalityoflifeofitsstakeholderswhilecontributingtotheeconomic development of its business.
To improve the welfare of its community, the company may take on broad environmental and social endeavors.
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development de(cid:28)nes CSR as (cid:16)the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large(cid:17) (wbcsd.org).
This de(cid:28)nitionoutlinestheroleofenterprisesasactivepartnersinthecommunitiesinwhichtheyoperate, rather than the more traditional view of enterprise as a separate, self-regulating, pro(cid:28)t-making entity.
CSR Positives and Negatives Milton Friedman, in his book, Capitalism and Freedom, argues that: There is one and only one social responsibility of business(cid:22)to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its pro(cid:28)ts so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.
Stockholder wealth maximization commands that corporate management should aggressively seek to maximizestockholderreturnsbyworkingtoincreasesharepricesandtocontinuallygrowthedividendspaid to shareholders (Czinkota, 2005).
Conversely, according to Professor Archie B. Carroll: AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>279 Corporate social responsibility involves the conduct of a business so that it is economically prof- itable, law abiding, ethical and socially supportive.
To be socially responsible then means that pro(cid:28)tability and obedience to the law are foremost conditions when discussing the (cid:28)rm’s ethics and the extent to which it supports the society in which it exists with contributions of money, time and talent (Carroll,1983).
Carroll’s CSR model contains four categories of corporate responsibility organized from most to least important.
According to Carroll, the (cid:16)history of business suggests an early emphasis on the economic and then legal aspects and a later concern for the ethical and discretionary aspects(cid:17) (Carroll, 1979).
Economic obligations are, therefore, seen to be moderated by ethical responsibilities or social expectations and norms.
Discretionaryresponsibilitiesgobeyondethicalresponsibilitiesandincludephilanthropicmeasures.
In1991, CarrollpresentedhisCSRmodelasapyramid,andsuggestedthatalthoughthecomponentsarenotmutually exclusive, it (cid:16)helps the manager to see that the di(cid:27)erent types of obligations are in constant tension with one another(cid:17) (Carroll, 1979).
Exhibit 14.13: Carroll’s CSR Pyramid: A three-dimensional conceptual model of corporate social performance.
There is no indication that CSR (corporate wealth maximization) and pro(cid:28)tability (stockholder wealth maximization) are mutually exclusive (Czinkota, 2005).
Corporate wealth maximization suggests that com- panies consider and balance short-term goals against long-term societal goals of continued employment, community citizenship and public welfare needs (Czinkota, 2005).
The successful multinational enterprises of the coming century will be those that (cid:28)nd the unique balance between (cid:28)nancial objectives and CSR.
CSR and Sustained Development initiatives There are a number of projects and initiatives that are shaping the goals and principles of corporate social responsibility and sustainable development, such as: • OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) is an international organization with 35 industrialized countries as participants, which account for 76 per cent of the world trade.
The themes that this organization addresses include environmental, human rights, labor issues, and information disclosure.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>280 CHAPTER 14. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR • UNNormsontheResponsibilitiesofTransnationalCorporationsandOtherBusinessEnterprises with RegardtoHumanRights.
Thecompletionofthesenormswaspossiblethroughdiscussionswithunions, business, and NGOs.
The norms include clari(cid:28)cation of corporate social responsibilities of companies in countries where they operate, and also refer to human rights in the workplace.
• ILO(InternationalLaborOrganization)anditsTripartiteDeclarationfocusesonthe(cid:16)socialaspectsof the activities of multinational enterprises, including employment creation in the developing countries(cid:17) (Governing Body of International Labor O(cid:30)ce, 204th session).
The principles established by this organization are adopted voluntarily, and thus its reach is limited since non-compliance cannot be sanctioned.
• United Nations’ Global Compact was established in 1999 by United Nations’ Secretary Ko(cid:28) Annan as a voluntary international initiative.
Participant companies are asked to demonstrate their support to ten di(cid:27)erent international principles of human and labor rights, anti-corruption and environmental protection, to seek solutions to the challenges of globalization and promote responsible corporate citizenship.
The initiative has more than 2,500 business participants from 90 countries around the world.
• Kyoto Protocol was agreed on in 1997 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
A total of 1968 countries and the EEC have rati(cid:28)ed the protocol (envroliteracy.org, 2007).
14.9.2 CSR and corporate strategy A distinction must be made between charity and CSR.
Charity refers to a company’s e(cid:27)orts to donate money or resources to an organization or a cause, promoting and allowing employees to volunteer in the community,andtheestablishmentorendorsementoffoundations.
Conversely,CSRisaconceptthatinvolves a company taking into consideration the di(cid:27)erent stakeholders involved when making a business decision.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development identi(cid:28)ed CSR to be an integral part of a company’s value system and strategy (intranet.csreurope.org).
For a company to fully integrate CSR, top management must integrate social responsibility into the strategic level of the decision-making process in order to develop a framework for economic decisions made at di(cid:27)erent levels of the organization’s hierarchy.
The problem that a company will encounter if CSR is not integrated into the organization strategy is thatmanagementandemployeescouldbypasssocialresponsibilityconsiderationsandCSRbecomespersonal ethics rather than CSR.
To adopt a CSR strategy the organization needs to take the following steps: • De(cid:28)ne CSR for their particular business.
• Understand motivations underlying its commitment.
• Establish policies and goals to achieve CSR.
• Establish measures to monitor their accomplishments in CSR (bsr.org).

14.10.1 Successful Implementation of CSR and Sustainable Development TetraPakColombiaworkedwithasmallrecyclingcompanyinColombiatodevelopatechnologytheynamed Ecoplak.
The technology utilizes 100 per cent of the residuals of tetra pack carton packages to obtain the material that can be used in the production of roofs and chipboards.
With this technology, Tetra Pack has built 24 houses for low-income families to date.
This company did not only take into consideration environmental issues in the recycling of waste from packages; but it also worked with a local recycler to produce this technology.
Additionally, this initiative created jobs, developed knowledge in local businesses, and helped families in the community who probably would not have had access to a home.
Each house was built using 1 million packages and consisted of 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen, and a living room.
The houses were also provided with electricity and water.
TetraPakColombiaiscurrentlyworkingwiththegovernmenttocoordinatethise(cid:27)ortandisstillbuilding houses that are periodically awarded to low income people of the community (tetrapak.com).
14.10.2 CSR, Sustainable Development, and the Future of Businesses Peter Drucker, in his article, The New Meaning of Corporate Social Responsibility, explained that (cid:16)the proper social responsibility of business is to tame the dragon that is to turn a social problem into economic opportunity and economic bene(cid:28)t, into productive capacity, into human competence, into well-paid jobs, and into wealth(cid:17) (Berkhout,2007).
As evidenced in the case of Tetra Pack Colombia, a company with CSR and sustainable development aligned into its strategy can be e(cid:27)ective in working with its community to solve a social problem.
In this case, Tetra Pack Colombia was able to utilize waste that impacted the environment; worked with the government to coordinate e(cid:27)orts to improve the welfare and the quality of life of its community; worked with companies in the community to develop knowledge and new technologies; and create new jobs and alternative, environmentally friendly new sources of material.
According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, (cid:16)By 2050, 85% of the world’s population of some nine billion people will be in (less industrialized) countries.
If these people are not by then engaged in the marketplace, business cannot prosper and the bene(cid:28)ts of a global market will not exist.
Clearly it is in our mutual interest to help societies shift to a more sustainable path.
(cid:17) Companieswillincreasinglybecalledupontoparticipatetoaddresschallengesofsocialandenvironmental roots, both locally and globally.
Sustainable development business opportunities exist everywhere and in all forms.
Such opportunities include recycling, reducing, and reusing.
Improved e(cid:30)ciencies, biotechnology, and miniaturization are other ideas.
Innovative leadership in life equality issues is becoming more and more of a trend today.
It is no doubt that unique economic and environmental needs exist in industrial and less industrialized countries.
CSR opportunities and challenges include promoting good labor practices and diversity, supporting health and education programs in the community.
There are few limits in the design and implementation of socially responsible initiatives for a company.
14.10.3 CSR and the small business entrepreneur For a small business entrepreneur, like Ms. Shahira, her company pro(cid:28)ts from its relationship with the community.
Its stakeholders, which include customers, the local community, and the government, are all critical aspects to the company’s growth in the future.

15.2 De(cid:28)nition and models2 15.2.1 De(cid:28)nition and statistics We start by de(cid:28)ning what we mean by growth and growth-oriented (cid:28)rms.
Criteria such as growth in the number of employees, or sales growth are generally used by researchers.
The Kaufmann Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, a leading institute of entrepreneurial research in the USA, for example, de(cid:28)nes high-growth (cid:28)rms as being those with over 30 per cent growth in sales or over 20 per cent growth in the number of employees for each of the three preceding years.
Other US researchers (Siegel/MacMillan 1993) de(cid:28)ne strong growth as over 25 per cent growth per annum over a three-year period.

EvenintheUSA,only5percentof(cid:28)rmseachyear are estimated to take on extra sta(cid:27) (cf.
Sexton/Bowman-Upton 1991, p. 12).
However, these fast-growing (cid:28)rms have a disproportionate signi(cid:28)cance for the increase in the number of jobs.
In the USA, for example, it is estimated that only 12-15 per cent of all businesses are responsible for 100 per cent of the employment growth in the US economy (cf.
Sexton/Bowman-Upton 1991, p. 10).

GROWTH STRATEGIES FOR START-UPS also shown that businesses with 50 to 250 employees recorded the greatest increase in employment (cf.
Ku¨hlhorn/Wissdorf 2001).
International comparative data can be found in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM).
Based on a survey of all start-ups from 1999, the GEM presented the share of high-growth start-ups (see Exhibit 1).
(cf.
Sternberg 2000).
Exhibit 15.1: Countries in comparison: Share of high-growth start-ups compared to total start-ups.
(Source: Sternberg 2000) 15.2.2 Growth models In the (cid:28)eld of entrepreneurship research, life cycle models are often used to describe the entrepreneurial process.
These models are also used in research into growth problems.
Kazanjian and Drazin (1980), for example, developed a four-phase growth model, and identi(cid:28)ed the typical growth problems of fast-growing (cid:28)rms in each phase.
Phase 1, Concept and development: Focus on the invention and development of a service or product.
Main problems: • developing the idea • testing a prototype • (cid:28)nding investment support for the idea Phase 2, Commercialization: Developing the product for introduction to the market.
Main problems: • setting up the organization and production • solving technical problems • market entry Phase 3, Growth: The fast-growth phase is characterized by its focus on the market.
Main problems: AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>287 • Producing larger quantities • Guaranteeing quality • Expanding market share • Personnel problems Phase 4, Stability: In this phase the focus lies on consolidating the market position with the initial product, and developing further products.
Main problem: • Simultaneouslymanagingthemarketentryofnewproductswithoutlosingthecompetitiveadvantages of older products.
Althoughlifephasemodelslikethesecanhelpthedecision-makingprocessinresearchandpractice,theyalso have their pitfalls.
In a review of such models, Sexton and Bowman/Upton (1991) warned that economic phenomena cannot always be compared to biological phenomena (life cycles).
Firm growth does not always develop through the phases of such models in a straightforward, linear way, for example.
Particularly in fast-growingindustriesinvolvingtechnologicalchange, growthismorechaoticthanordered.
Moreover, well- known growth models with a bell-shaped, concave, or plateau structure are only useful as ideal reference patterns for actual growth processes.
Building on this criticism, Covin and Slevin (1997) suggest another growth model from the complexity management perspective.
This model emphasizes that growth occurs through certain market factors in combination with internal competences and resources.
The main problem for entrepreneurs is overcoming theincreasingorganizationalandexternalcomplexity.

GROWTH STRATEGIES FOR START-UPS Industrial change is often triggered by technological changes, for which there are many examples: the substitutionofdigitaltechnologiesinawholerangeofanalogproducts, fromo(cid:30)ceequipmenttotelephones, and the Internet as a communication medium.
Technological changes like this enable start-up (cid:28)rms devel- oping new technologies and introducing them to the market to take over the positions of their established competitors.
A second catalyst for industrial transformations is change in consumer behavior.
The increasing techno- logical competence of customers, for example, has enabled the growth of direct computer sellers like Dell.
Customersarepreparedtogetinformationaboutevenhigh-technologyproductsfromtheInternetandorder them online instead of asking for advice in a shop.
Deregulation or liberalization can also be a reason for industrial transformation and change.
In recent years industry deregulation has created opportunities for start-up (cid:28)rms and growth opportunities in general in various industries, such as the air tra(cid:30)c, telecommunications, or (cid:28)nancial service sectors.
Changes in technologies, customer preferences, or regulations o(cid:27)er opportunities for transformation and change,butitisuptoentrepreneurstomakeuseofthem.

Thereisgenerallyaconsolidationphaseintheindustry,andfailedexperiments lead to certain (cid:28)rms disappearing from the industry.
However, successful business models can mean even faster growth for the survivors, as they can take over shares of the market from other competitors.
15.2.3 Growth through buying out other companies The entrepreneurship management literature generally refers to internal growth.
However, small, fast- growing companies also have the possibility of growing by acquisition.
These opportunities have become even more frequent in recent years due to the increasing availability of venture capital, and of capital re- sources from initial public o(cid:27)erings (IPOs).
An acquisition strategy for a fast-growing start-up can bring many advantages.
First of all, just like large (cid:28)rms, small (cid:28)rms can try to obtain synergies by means of complementary resources from bought-out (cid:28)rms.
Sales growth as a result of buying out (cid:28)rms in the same industrycouldberenderedmoree(cid:30)cientbycombinedresourcesandtheacquisitionofcompetentemployees.
An acquisition strategy can also be pursued to enable growth in new geographic markets.
Moreover, the opportunityforexpansionviaacquisitionisparticularlyattractiveinothercountries,whereitcanbedi(cid:30)cult to establish new businesses.
Such a strategy can also o(cid:27)er the opportunity to go into related diversi(cid:28)cation, i.e.
a start-up (cid:28)rm can acquire other products or services which are related to its original ones.
Synergy e(cid:27)ects and reduced or shared overheads can also be gained here.
Firms can also integrate vertically through acquisition, i.e.
by buying out suppliers or customers to process more steps in the value chain in-house.
Vertical integration can sometimes bring advantages of cost or di(cid:27)erentiation.
Cost advantages can arise either through buying or building up cheaper distribution channels (forward integration), or cheap inputs (backward integration).
Advantages of di(cid:27)erentiation can be obtained by distribution channels or inputs which stand out from those of competitors (cf.
Porter 1992).

More customers can be won, or acquired more cheaply than if they have to be found using conventional marketing methods.
The acquisition of other (cid:28)rms can also be a chance to gain technological know-how, or even new technologies in the form of patents.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>289 15.2.4 Growth through cooperation A cooperation strategy strikes a balance between internal growth and growth from the acquisition of other companies.
Several studies in the USA have proved that fast-growing start-ups sometimes use cooperation with other small (cid:28)rms, and sometimes with large, established (cid:28)rms.
This cooperation is of various types.
Licensing is a typical strategy in the biotech industry, for example.
Small biotech start-ups generally do not have the necessary complementary resources (cf.
Teece 1986) to carry new drugs through all the test phases and then to market them.
Such (cid:28)rms often sell licenses to established pharmaceutical (cid:28)rms (the danger of this strategy will be dealt with (cid:16)Inadequate or incorrect marketing(cid:17)) Other cooperation strategies, such as Research and Development cooperation, or outsourcing production, are possible.
Cooperation strategies are pursued more frequently where there are networks of start-ups (cf.
Lechner 2001).
Althoughnew(cid:28)rmscangainthecomplementaryresourcestheylackthroughcooperation, theystillneed basic competences in root technologies and key functions.
In a study of high-tech start-ups in the USA, McGee et al.
(1995) showed that the start-ups which grew fastest were those which pursued cooperation strategies to build on strengths, and not to compensate for weaknesses.
15.2.5 Stopping growth by selling the (cid:28)rm An acquisition can be regarded as a growth strategy, but the sale of a company leads to a halt in growth.
Suchasaledoesnotnecessarilyhavetobedescribedasaloss,however.
Onthecontrary,atradesale(cid:22)when astart-upsellsitselftoanother(cid:28)rm(cid:22)canbeseenasthesuccessfulendoftheentrepreneurialprocess.
A(cid:28)rm has the possibility of continuing to grow as part of another (cid:28)rm, or the founders can use the sales revenue to pursue other activities.
There are many examples of so-called (cid:16)serial entrepreneurs(cid:17).
These entrepreneurs have founded several new companies, helped them to grow, and then sold them in order to pursue other activities.
The best example of this is Jim Clark from Silicon Valley.
He is currently working on starting his fourth and (cid:28)fth companies, both in the Internet (cid:28)eld.
Prior to this he generated several billion USD for himself and his colleagues with three very successful high-tech start-ups: Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and Healthion.
Clark recognized a long time ago that he is best at controlling the growth phase of a start-up, but is too impatient to manage a mature organization professionally.
He tries to choose the right time to sell new (cid:28)rms to competitors which are better at dealing with the maturity phase (cf.
Chong et al.
2000).
15.2.6 Growth through innovation Times of technological change are an opportunity for start-ups to grow.
New (cid:28)rms that use technological changes to introduce new products or services as market leaders can gain competitive advantages quickly.
However, technological innovations like these must be able to be protected, or they will not last.
The new (cid:28)rmsmustalsopossessoracquirethenecessarycomplementaryresourcesfortheproductsandthemarketing of them (cf.
Teece 1986).
Certain types of innovation are especially advantageous for start-ups.
In his book, The Innovator’s Dilemma, Christensen (1997) di(cid:27)erentiates between (cid:16)sustaining technologies(cid:17) and (cid:16)disruptive technologies(cid:17).
Sustainingtechnologiesimproveexistingproduct-marketstructuresandaregenerallyintroducedmoste(cid:27)ec- tively by established (cid:28)rms.
Disruptive technologies, on the other hand, which enable new applications for new customer segments, tend to be developed and marketed by start-ups.
Christensen takes the example of the computer hard drive industry to show how start-ups have very often seen successful growth over a twenty-year period as spin-o(cid:27)s of established (cid:28)rms.
Similar developments can be seen in other sectors.
In the next part of this chapter, we analyze the most frequent growth mistakes in start-ups.

GROWTH STRATEGIES FOR START-UPS 15.3 Growth problems3 15.3.1 Management mistakes Of course, start-ups often make management mistakes in pursuing growth.
A classic (cid:28)rst mistake is in the choice of a product or service(cid:22)and/or even worse, a market(cid:22)with no potential for growth.
The only safeguard against this mistake is to conduct careful market and competitor analysis (See Chapter 13) to estimate the total market potential.
This analysis must be complemented by thechoiceofastrategyforcapturingthemarketwithwhichanassumedmarketpotentialcanbedeveloped, taking into account the given (cid:28)nancial restrictions.
A second mistake is the failure to choose one of the aforementionedgrowthstrategiesearlyon.
Athirdmistakeistonotrecruitcompetentandprofessionalsta(cid:27) toimplementtheplannedstrategies.
Afourthmistakeisnottoalignproduct-marketgrowthstrategieswith the (cid:28)rm’s other strategies, especially (cid:28)nance, HR, and organizational strategies.
A (cid:28)fth mistake is to choose the wrong (cid:28)nance model.
Here, an almost classic mistake is for (cid:28)rms to re(cid:28)nance long-term (cid:28)xed capital with short-term returns, or with short-term revolving loans.
A sixth mistake is to force growth.
If growth occurs too rapidly, the (cid:28)rm is in danger of losing sight of the risks involved in the individual activities of thevaluechain, evenwhenthisgrowthcanbe(cid:28)nanced.
Here, continuousdevelopmentisbetterthanerratic growth (cf.
Hutzschenreuter 2001), because it enables management to (cid:28)ll the gaps in their knowledge.
We will go into several of these management mistakes in more detail in the following.
15.3.2 Incompatibility of growth strategies and organizational structure The growth of start-ups must be planned, and supported by one or more of the above mentioned strategies.
It is a signi(cid:28)cant growth mistake to do without planning and strategic development.
However, even when these mistakes are avoided, and growth strategies exist, managers tend to overlook the fact that there is a connection between the chosen strategy and the particular organizational structure of the start-up.
This oversight is a serious impediment to growth.
Firms which are still small and striving to grow should choose team structures, or, if necessary, tight centralization as a structure for their organization so that they can handle knowledge management, and decision coordination and implementation better.
The lack of team management and networking in the start-up and consolidation phases hinders growth, as the experience of start-ups from Silicon Valley has shown.
If growth is achieved by increasing sales volume, start-ups can defer the adjustment of the original organizationalstructureuntildecisionde(cid:28)cits,suchasdelaysindecision-making,begintosurface.
Ingrowing companies, maintainingthesameteamstructuresandmanagementgenerallyleadstoalossofcoordination.
Italsopostponesthecreationofaclearcorporatestructure.
Ifthedistributionofresponsibilityinthestart- up is unclear, or if the same team management has been continued despite growth, problems will arise due to a lack of coordination.
Therefore, the distribution of competences and responsibility must be achieved, depending on the strategies the start-up pursues.
If team structures impede this because they are too slow, they must be replaced by hierarchical structures.
Di(cid:27)erent strategies may be necessary if the company pursues diversi(cid:28)cation strategies by expanding into new markets, or bringing out new products by expanding the value chain, or into new networks.
However, this requires a good knowledge of the industry or industries in which the start-up wishes to diversify.
In thiscase, amoredecentralizedorganizationalstructurewithdi(cid:27)erent, relativelyautonomousdepartmentsis advisable.
However, department decentralization makes coordination essential.
Some of the classic mistakes madebyyoung(cid:28)rmsareeithertowaittoolongbeforedecentralizing,decentralizingtoosoon,and/orfailing to coordinate the new departments.
Each of these mistakes, or a combination, can have a restricting e(cid:27)ect on the growth of a (cid:28)rm, and in the worst case can even increase the risk of a young (cid:28)rm’s going bankrupt.

AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>291 15.3.3 Inadequate or incorrect marketing, cooperation, (cid:28)nance, or HR strategies Growth is also at risk if start-ups fail to develop strategic planning, marketing, (cid:28)nancing, risk management, HR management, organization, or policies for internationalization.
Growth mistakes made in regard to marketing, (cid:28)nancing, and HR management are particularly serious.
Many of the following issues have been introduced in previous chapters.
The (cid:28)rst group of (cid:29)awed growth strategies is marketing strategies.
Start-ups are particularly susceptible to concentrating on developing a technical or scienti(cid:28)c product further and developing new products, but not paying enough attention to marketing.
Marketing plans and their extrapolation are a prerequisite for avoidinggrowthmistakes.
Ifa(cid:28)rmdoesnotconductmarketresearch,identifycustomerpreferences,generate newcustomerwishes,orsegmentorcapturethemarket,itwillnotgrow.
Start-upscanonly(cid:28)ndoutwhether ornottheycanachieveorhavealreadyachievedadominantpositioninthemarketbyconductingsystematic market research.
If they already have a dominant position, they could try to push competitors out of the market or prevent them from entering it in the (cid:28)rst place.
Depending on the (cid:28)nancial resources available, e.g.
after a successful IPO, it could even make sense to buy out competitors and grow in this fashion.
Asecondgroupthatcanhindergrowthiscooperationstrategies,suchaswhenastart-upbecomesoverly dependentonamoreestablishedcompanyasaseniorpartner,forexample,whenasmallbiotech(cid:28)rmdepends on a large pharmaceutical company to market its products.
If larger established companies really commit themselvestotheirjuniorpartnersandaresuccessful,thencooperationoftenendsupwiththeseniorpartner taking over the start-up.
This only ensures the growth of the senior partner.
Transferring licenses to larger (cid:28)rmsbeforeaproductisfullydevelopedisalsodangerous(cid:22)thisisaparticularproblemforbiotechstart-ups if the government has not yet approved a new drug.
However, what is much more common is opportunistic behavior by the senior partner, where it is paid well by the junior partner for its marketing activities, but then it does not in fact aggressively market the junior partner’s products.
Such a (cid:29)awed marketing strategy is also a huge hindrance to growth.
A third group of (cid:29)awed growth strategies concerns the (cid:28)nancing of growth.
In the initial phases of the life cycle of start-ups, growth can scarcely be (cid:28)nanced out of their pro(cid:28)ts, nor can it generally be (cid:28)nanced alone by the founders’ equity.
Start-ups in particular are often undercapitalized.
The only alternative that remains is seeking outside capital.
To (cid:28)nance growth strategies start-ups sometimes borrow long-term debt which is to be paid back with interest from the revenues from implementing the strategy.
Likewise, some start-ups redeem loans and interest payments step-by-step over a long period by taking out revolving, short-term loans.
Both (cid:28)nancial strategies jeopardize growth considerably, or even hinder it completely if the (cid:28)rm does not generate the planned revenues, or if no new short-term loans are available to pay o(cid:27) part of the long-term loan at the righttime.
Inaddition,start-upswithhighgrowthpotentialincertainindustries,cantradepartialownership in their (cid:28)rms for (cid:16)venture capital(cid:17).
Start-upscanalsomakeanothergrowthmistakein(cid:28)nancingbylaunchingtheirIPOsonthestockmarket too soon and simply using this revenue to repay debt or venture capital and replace it with equity from the capital market.
What is even more serious after an IPO is when (cid:28)rms make the growth mistake of merely increasing their cash management or randomly buying out other (cid:28)rms, rather than using their IPO funds to (cid:28)nance wise growth strategies.
The fourth group of related business strategies where serious mistakes can be made is Human Resource strategies.
Inmanycasesthefoundersandemployeesofstart-upsareintheirthirties,andsometimesonlyin their twenties, and are frequently highly quali(cid:28)ed university or college graduates (cf.
Frank/Opitz 2001, p. 454).
The homogeneity of the age distribution of managers and employees often leads to start-ups acquiring new personnel from the same age group.
However, a homogeneous age distribution may lead to a decline in motivation as employees age at the same time.
Start-ups must therefore be particularly careful to achieve a heterogeneous age distribution in their personnel.
They must also attempt to acquire older employees with experience in the industry and with management competences from other successful companies.
It can be of great value to acquire more senior managers who enjoy the new challenge of working for a start-up beforetheyretire.
Lackofloyaltyintheirpersonnelshouldleadstart-upstothinkabouthowtoretaintheir particularly talented employees.
If start-ups fail to consider these points, obstacles to growth are a matter AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>292 CHAPTER 15.
GROWTH STRATEGIES FOR START-UPS of course.
Muchmoreimportant, however, isdevelopingtheknowledgeandcompetencesoftheentiresta(cid:27)depend- ing on the start-up’s chosen growth strategy.
The knowledge and competences necessary for formulating and implementing the growth strategies must be forecast as part of qualitative Human Resource planning, and then provided by Human Resource development or by acquiring external personnel (cf.
Drumm 2000).
If this does not happen, start-ups face a growth barrier which is hard to overcome.
The failure to imple- mentstrategy-orientedHRdevelopmentandbuildupandmaintaininternalizedmotivationoftheemployees through attractive work and working conditions is a barrier to growth which is often overlooked.
15.3.4 Inadequate or incorrect internal accounting All(cid:28)rms,whetheryoungormature,needcostaccountingsystemswhichcanreportcostsand(cid:22)asfarasthey arespeci(cid:28)callyattributable(cid:22)revenuespercostunit,costcenter,anddepartment.
Itisimportantthatstart- ups establish systems for unit cost accounting, cost center accounting, and breakeven analysis (cf.
Scherrer 1999) in order to be able to assess economic ine(cid:30)ciencies and sources of loss by means of target/actual comparisons and pro(cid:28)t margins.
If the competition is (cid:28)erce, (cid:28)rms should also establish target costing to be able to undermine competitors by adjusting price policy.
Doing without any kind of cost accounting leads not only to the fact that sources of loss remain undis- covered, but also that pro(cid:28)t potentials stay hidden as well.
Both of these points represent possible growth risks.
Start-ups must therefore avoid this risk by establishing cost and pro(cid:28)t accounting, and a breakeven analysis as quickly as possible.
15.3.5 Dependence on third parties Many start-up, survival, and growth strategies lead almost inevitably to the dependence of new (cid:28)rms on third parties.
This causes no problem as long as the interests of all people and (cid:28)rms involved are relatively equaland/orcompatible.
Dependenceonthirdpartiesfunctioningasinvestors,licensors,partners,principal customers in the sales market, or single suppliers does not necessarily lead to growth barriers.
However, dependence is a disadvantage if there are diverging interests, or if the partners behave opportunistically.
In this case, the growth of the start-up is inhibited and the (cid:28)rm is forced to (cid:28)ght the opportunistic behavior of the partners.
For the start-up these defense activities incur transaction costs which arise in the preparation phase of a partnership and in the conclusion of cooperation contracts, and are added to later by transaction costs arising from controlling, and correcting errors.
However, the older the (cid:28)rm becomes, dependence on third parties should be reduced.
The dependence on licensors should be compensated for by the (cid:28)rm’s own research and development.
The dependence on outside investors, on the other hand, is generally unavoidable, but it can be put to positive use by raising risk capital by pro(cid:28)t sharing with investors to create homogeneity of interests.
Asshownabove,dependenceonthirdpartiescanarisewhena(cid:28)rmmarketsitsproducts.
Itcan,however, also arise in the acquisition of preliminary products, or in (cid:28)nancing.
It is at its highest in (cid:28)rm networks.
Start-ups must therefore ask themselves repeatedly whether these dependencies secure their existence and survival,orwhethertheyareendangeringtheirgrowth.
Aslongasthe(cid:28)rm’ssurvivalissecuredbysuppliers orcustomersthroughstrategicdependencies,forinstancewithinanetworkofcooperating(cid:28)rms,thestart-up can pro(cid:28)t. If such dependencies however, endanger the success and growth of the (cid:28)rm, the start-up must try to extricate itself by building up its own sales or supply channels.
Homogeneity of interests must also be taken into account when building an external network in order to minimize transaction costs which stunt growth.
15.3.6 Acculturation problems when buying companies Growth as a result of acquiring companies in the supply chain, or diversifying into other sectors not only creates the potential for mistakes due to inadequate knowledge of the industry, but by insu(cid:30)cient accultur- ation of the companies acquired.
Every company develops its own culture from the moment it is founded.
AvailableforfreeatConnexions<http://cnx.org/content/col11227/1.4>293 Thisismanifestedinthefounders’valuesysteminregardtotheiremployees,customers,suppliers,sponsors, and other partners.
Founders will always try to transfer their value system onto their employees and thus form their behavior completely or at least partly.
Company culture is also manifested in desired forms of behavior, rituals, and accepted processes of analyzing and solving processes practiced by the founders which they in turn would like their employees to implement.
Communicating these values and forms of behavior is part of the management process.
If other companies are acquired in the course of planned growth processes, the company also takes on their (cid:16)foreign(cid:17) (cid:28)rm cultures.
The confrontation between two or more incompatible (cid:28)rm cultures makes acculturation essential.
The di(cid:27)erent cultures must be adapted to each other, or the growth of the entire company and its individual departments due to synergy e(cid:27)ects is at stake.
There are three di(cid:27)erent acculturation strategies to choose from.
In the case of usurpation, the man- agement from the bought out (cid:28)rm is replaced by the management team of the (cid:28)rm that bought it out.
This model is generally expensive, but can be implemented relatively quickly.
In the case of adaptation, the buying and bought out (cid:28)rm(s) get to know and understand each other’s cultures in order to change and adaptthemstepbystep.
Thismodelismuchslowerthanusurpation,butalsocheaper.
Thesynthesismodel consists of consciously giving up the old (cid:28)rm culture and creating a new one.
This model makes sense if the acquisition means that the markets and thus market-oriented strategies change, or the national orientation of the start-up can be expanded to an international one.
Doing without acculturation strategies not only stunts growth, but also increases the risk of bankruptcy.
15.4 Chapter summary4 Company growth must be planned by both old and young (cid:28)rms.
It requires the choice of one or more of the above mentioned strategies to promote growth.
Product and process innovations, the di(cid:27)erentiation of products and markets, the use of market niches, and networking with other companies are important strategies for start-ups.
Growth along the supply chain is a special case in vertical networking strategies.
Buying out entire companies is also suitable as a growth strategy, but it presupposes the availability of su(cid:30)cient capital, and the solution of acculturation problems.
Growth can be seriously threatened by the management mistakes discussed above, but also promoted by growth strategies that are well implemented.
