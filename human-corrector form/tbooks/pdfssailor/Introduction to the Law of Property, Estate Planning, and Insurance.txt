Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1  Preface Our goal is to provide students with a textbook that is up to date and comprehensive in its coverage of legal and regulatory issues—and organized to permit instructors to tailor the materials to their particular approach.
This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they are already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and by its clear, concise, and readable style.
(An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and Siedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) This textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with which managers and business executives must grapple.
The text provides the vocabulary and legal acumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, suppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers.
Traditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by offering a huge array of publications.
Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize the text to meet their needs.
For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case summaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few excerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material.
Likewise, the manner in which most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in a separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 2  Chapter 1 Introduction to Law and Legal Systems LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance.
2.
Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve.
3.
Explain how politics and law are related.
4.
Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws.
5.
Understand some basic differences between the US legal system and other legal systems.
Law has different meanings as well as different functions.
Philosophers have considered issues of justice and law for centuries, and several different approaches, or schools of legal thought, have emerged.
In this chapter, we will look at those different meanings and approaches and will consider how social and political dynamics interact with the ideas that animate the various schools of legal thought.
We will also look at typical sources of “positive law” in the United States and how some of those sources have priority over others, and we will set out some basic differences between the US legal system and other legal systems.
1.1 What Is Law?
Law is a word that means different things at different times.
Black’s Law Dictionarysays that law is “a body of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force.
That which must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1] Functions of the Law In a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual rights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly social change.
Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others.
Although a nation ruled by an authoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities or political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein).
Under colonialism, European nations often imposed peace in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 3  countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by those same European nations.
Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by Spain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy.
With regard to the functions of the law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and seldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation.
In nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have frequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively.
In Rwanda, for example, power struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority.
(Genocide is the deliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group.
In 1948, the international community formally condemned the crime of genocide.)
In nations of the former Soviet Union, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders.
When Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly for home turf rather than share power.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups of families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be seen.
Law and Politics In the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, with substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association.
In the fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people.
The process of electing state judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign contributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings.
In the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other elected officials (the Senate).
If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of Senate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes.
Such a division has been fairly frequent over the past fifty years.
In most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make and enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 4  people or groups that have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws.
Revolutions are difficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an aspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law.
KEY TAKEAWAY Law is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation.
Unstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law.
EXERCISES 1.
Consider Burma (named Myanmar by its military rulers).
What political rights do you have that the average Burmese citizen does not?
2.
What is a nongovernment organization, and what does it have to do with government?
Do you contribute to (or are you active in) a nongovernment organization?
What kind of rights do they espouse, what kind of laws do they support, and what kind of laws do they oppose?

“law.” 1.2 Schools of Legal Thought LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance.
2.
Explain why natural law relates to the rights that the founders of the US political-legal system found important.
3.
Describe legal positivism and explain how it differs from natural law.
4.
Differentiate critical legal studies and ecofeminist legal perspectives from both natural law and legal positivist perspectives.
There are different schools (or philosophies) concerning what law is all about.
Philosophy of law is also called jurisprudence, and the two main schools arelegal positivism and natural law.
Although there are others (see Section 1.2.3 "Other Schools of Legal Thought"), these two are the most influential in how people think about the law.
Legal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 5  As legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, in other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, or sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or territory.
Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge precise enough to be worthwhile.
But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws?
We could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly precise way to find out what the law says.
For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most US highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour.
Or we could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied.
Doing so, we might conclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally someone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone.
Either approach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific.
The first approach, examining in a precise way what the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought.
The second approach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the law—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 "Other Schools of Legal Thought").
Positivism has its limits and its critics.
New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the birth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed.
Because it was the command of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”).
Suppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and can only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are few and far between.
Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is enforced with a vengeance.
People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or goodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out.
To avoid the law’s impact, a citizen would have to flee the country entirely.
During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this example is drawn, many did flee.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 6  The positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; questions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important.
In contrast, the natural-law school of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, universal, or divine law.
If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen would be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience.
For example, in refusing to give up her seat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law.
Natural Law The natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order.
Natural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is good and that which is evil.
Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective norm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, but binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] Both the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural- law outlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations.
The US Declaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy.
The following short extract should provide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document.
The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America July 4, 1776 When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 7  of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.… The natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking.
The idea that certain rights, for example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of John Locke) is consistent with this view of the law.
Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights that government cannot legitimately take away.
Government only by consent of the governed is a natural outgrowth of this view.
Civil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—becomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law.
For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” Martin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an unjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.” [2] Legal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” law or “universal” law is.
In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written law says, or by examining how it has been applied.
In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if we care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, however hard that may be to define.
It is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, have specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination.
There are always difficult issues of interpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views.
But how can we know the more fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality?
For example, how do we know that “all men are created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)?
Setting aside for the moment questions about the equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the declaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge?
(A priori means Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 8  “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about equality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally?
The dialogue between natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar questions.
In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions about what it could or should be.
Other Schools of Legal Thought The historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples of the past.
Precedent would be more important than moral arguments.
The legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school.
Legal realists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have to be altered or modernized in order to remain current.
The social context of law was more important to legal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes.
Rather than suppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists observed that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions based on their beliefs and their own social context.
The legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought.
The “Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.
Some Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory (see Chapter 2 "Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics").
The CLS school believes the wealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control through law.
In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in society.
Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free.
The CLS movement would use the law to overturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society.
Related to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought.
This school emphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of the natural world.
Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of women is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 9  environment.
They would say that male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of the existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls economically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal systems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land.
Ecofeminists would say that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some nations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the past for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and women.
KEY TAKEAWAY Each of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should be.
The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed.
Positive law takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed will obey.
Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of domination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory).
EXERCISES 1.
Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest.
She says that in our society the stream is seen as unproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until engineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower.
The same is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species.
A forest may very well be productive— protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and craft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource.
She criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, neither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource.
Which school of legal thought does her criticism reflect?
2.
Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” Which school of legal thought is represented by this quote?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 10  3.
Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard under Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual extermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald.
After an Israeli “extraction team” took him from Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was “just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal thought.

“natural law.” [2] Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” 1.3 Basic Concepts and Categories of US Positive Law LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
In a general way, differentiate contract law from tort law.
2.
Consider the role of law in supporting ethical norms in our society.
3.
Understand the differing roles of state law and federal law in the US legal system.
4.
Know the difference between criminal cases and civil cases.
Most of what we discuss in this book is positive law—US positive law in particular.
We will also consider the laws and legal systems of other nations.
But first, it will be useful to cover some basic concepts and distinctions.
Law: The Moral Minimums in a Democratic Society The law does not correct (or claim to correct) every wrong that occurs in society.
At a minimum, it aims to curb the worst kind of wrongs, the kinds of wrongs that violate what might be called the “moral minimums” that a community demands of its members.
These include not only violations of criminal law (see Chapter 6 "Criminal Law") but also torts (see Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law") and broken promises (see Chapter 8 "Contracts").
Thus it may be wrong to refuse to return a phone call from a friend, but that wrong will not result in a viable lawsuit against you.
But if a phone (or the Internet) is used to libel or slander someone, a tort has been committed, and the law may allow the defamed person to be compensated.
There is a strong association between what we generally think of as ethical behavior and what the laws require and provide.
For example, contract law upholds society’s sense that promises— Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 11  in general—should be kept.
Promise-breaking is seen as unethical.
The law provides remedies for broken promises (in breach of contract cases) but not for all broken promises; some excuses are accepted when it would be reasonable to do so.
For tort law, harming others is considered unethical.
If people are not restrained by law from harming one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to anarchy.
Tort law provides for compensation when serious injuries or harms occur.
As for property law issues, we generally believe that private ownership of property is socially useful and generally desirable, and it is generally protected (with some exceptions) by laws.
You can’t throw a party at my house without my permission, but my right to do whatever I want on my own property may be limited by law; I can’t, without the public’s permission, operate an incinerator on my property and burn heavy metals, as toxic ash may be deposited throughout the neighborhood.
The Common Law: Property, Torts, and Contracts Even before legislatures met to make rules for society, disputes happened and judges decided them.
In England, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision.
They often resorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions.
In relying on those prior decisions, the judge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the same way.
This is essentially reasoning by analogy.
Thus the use of precedent in common-law cases came into being, and a doctrine of stare decisis (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became accepted in English courts.
Stare decisis means, in Latin, “let the decision stand.” Most judicial decisions that don’t apply legislative acts (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas of law—property, contract, or tort.
Property law deals with the rights and duties of those who can legally own land (real property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and protected, how property can be bought and sold, what the rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of “estates” in land are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest, easements, or rights of way).
Contract law deals with what kinds of promises courts should enforce.
For example, should courts enforce a contract where one of the parties was intoxicated, underage, or insane?
Should courts enforce a contract where one of the parties seemed to have an unfair advantage?
What kind of contracts would have to be in writing to be enforced by Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 12  courts?
Tort law deals with the types of cases that involve some kind of harm and or injury between the plaintiff and the defendant when no contract exists.
Thus if you are libeled or a competitor lies about your product, your remedy would be in tort, not contract.
The thirteen original colonies had been using English common law for many years, and they continued to do so after independence from England.
Early cases from the first states are full of references to already-decided English cases.
As years went by, many precedents were established by US state courts, so that today a judicial opinion that refers to a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century English common-law case is quite rare.
Courts in one state may look to common-law decisions from the courts of other states where the reasoning in a similar case is persuasive.
This will happen in “cases of first impression,” a fact pattern or situation that the courts in one state have never seen before.
But if the supreme court in a particular state has already ruled on a certain kind of case, lower courts in that state will always follow the rule set forth by their highest court.
State Courts and the Domain of State Law In the early years of our nation, federal courts were not as active or important as state courts.
States had jurisdiction (the power to make and enforce laws) over the most important aspects of business life.
The power of state law has historically included governing the following kinds of issues and claims: • Contracts, including sales, commercial paper, letters of credit, and secured transactions • Torts • Property, including real property, bailments of personal property (such as when you check your coat at a theater or leave your clothes with a dry cleaner), trademarks, copyrights, and the estates of decedents (dead people) • Corporations • Partnerships • Domestic matters, including marriage, divorce, custody, adoption, and visitation • Securities law • Environmental law • Agency law, governing the relationship between principals and their agents.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 13  • Banking • Insurance Over the past eighty years, however, federal law has become increasingly important in many of these areas, including banking, securities, and environmental law.
Civil versus Criminal Cases Most of the cases we will look at in this textbook are civil cases.
Criminal cases are certainly of interest to business, especially as companies may break criminal laws.
A criminal case involves a governmental decision—whether state or federal—to prosecute someone (named as a defendant) for violating society’s laws.
The law establishes a moral minimum and does so especially in the area of criminal laws; if you break a criminal law, you can lose your freedom (in jail) or your life (if you are convicted of a capital offense).
In a civil action, you would not be sent to prison; in the worst case, you can lose property (usually money or other assets), such as when Ford Motor Company lost a personal injury case and the judge awarded $295 million to the plaintiffs or when Pennzoil won a $10.54 billion verdict against Texaco (see Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law").
Some of the basic differences between civil law and criminal law cases are illustrated in Table 1.1 "Differences between Civil and Criminal Cases".
Table 1.1 Differences between Civil and Criminal Cases Civil Cases Criminal Cases Plaintiff brings case; defendant must answer or Prosecutor brings case; defendant may Parties lose by default remain silent Proof Preponderance of evidence Beyond a reasonable doubt To settle disputes peacefully, usually between Reason private parties To maintain order in society To punish the most blameworthy To deter serious wrongdoing Remedies Money damages (legal remedy) Fines, jail, and forfeitures Injunctions (equitable remedy) Specific performance (equity) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 14  Regarding plaintiffs and prosecutors, you can often tell a civil case from a criminal case by looking at the caption of a case going to trial.
If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. Lieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people.
The same is true of cases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel).
But this is not a foolproof formula.
Governments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, corporations, or other governments.
Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, or U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice.
Governments can be sued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the government waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits.
Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a claim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom from a US Air Force jet flying overhead.
Substance versus Procedure Many rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural.
We are used to seeing laws as substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is proscribed (prohibited).
The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the government.
For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command or direction to citizens: • Drive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted.
• Do not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market.
• Do not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy.
• Do not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the direction you are coming from.
• Do not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or national origin.
• Do not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit.
In contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies.
They tell us how to proceed if there is a substantive-law problem.
For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a forty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 15  broken a substantive rule of law (the posted speed limit).
Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of procedural law.
Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge?
If so, who goes first, you or the officer?
Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel?
Does the hearing or trial have to take place within a certain time period?
A week?
A month?
How long can the state take to bring its case?
What kinds of evidence will be relevant?
Radar?
(Does it matter what kind of training the officer has had on the radar device?
Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?)
The officer’s personal observation?
(What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other questions arise.)
What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred miles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning?
(If the prosecutor knows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-per-hour zone?)
In the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due process of law.
(The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if you violate the speed limit.)
Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment.
This suggests that some laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true.
The next section looks at various types of positive law and their relative importance.
KEY TAKEAWAY In most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for actions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or corporations).
Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of contracts and torts.
In the United States, both the states and the federal government have roles to play, and sometimes these roles will overlap, as in environmental standards set by both states and the federal government.
EXERCISES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 16  1.
Jenna gets a ticket for careless driving after the police come to investigate a car accident she had with you on Hanover Boulevard.
Your car is badly damaged through no fault of your own.
Is Jenna likely to face criminal charges, civil charges, or both?
2.
Jenna’s ticket says that she has thirty days in which to respond to the charges against her.
The thirty days conforms to a state law that sets this time limit.
Is the thirty-day limit procedural law or substantive law?
1.4 Sources of Law and Their Priority LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the different sources of law in the US legal system and the principal institutions that create those laws.
2.
Explain in what way a statute is like a treaty, and vice versa.
3.
Explain why the Constitution is “prior” and has priority over the legislative acts of a majority, whether in the US Congress or in a state legislature.
4.
Describe the origins of the common-law system and what common law means.
Sources of Law In the United States today, there are numerous sources of law.
The main ones are (1) constitutions—both state and federal, (2) statutes and agency regulations, and (3) judicial decisions.
In addition, chief executives (the president and the various governors) can issue executive orders that have the effect of law.
In international legal systems, sources of law include treaties (agreements between states or countries) and what is known as customary international law (usually consisting of judicial decisions from national court systems where parties from two or more nations are in a dispute).
As you might expect, these laws sometimes conflict: a state law may conflict with a federal law, or a federal law might be contrary to an international obligation.
One nation’s law may provide one substantive rule, while another nation’s law may provide a different, somewhat contrary rule to apply.
Not all laws, in other words, are created equal.
To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to understand the relationships between the various kinds of law.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 17  Constitutions Constitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, executive, and judicial framework.
Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest constitution still in use.
It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments following the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-fourths of the states must approve them.
The nation’s states also have constitutions.
Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial functions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens.
These rights may be different from, and in addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution.
Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s specific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section 1.4.3 "Causes of Action, Precedent, and " on “causes of action”).
For example, California’s constitution provides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy.
This has been used to assert claims against businesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy.
In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, International Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a competitor.
When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in damages.
As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters the workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s interests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our Constitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] Statutes and Treaties in Congress In Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives and a Senate.
The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in each state.
These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten years by the census, a process required by the Constitution.
Each state has at least one district; the most populous state (California) has fifty-two districts.
In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, regardless of the state’s population.
Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even though California has far more Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 18  people.
Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can send fifty senators to Washington.
Many consider this to be antidemocratic.
The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly proportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative.
Each Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes.
In these committees, proposed bills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for a vote) or killed in committee.
If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote.
Because of the procedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when proposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body.
A conference committee will then be held to try to match the two versions.
If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of the two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult.
If the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president for signature or veto.
The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any legislation.
But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.
In the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them.
When the Senate ratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the entire Congress.
The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code.
The code is available online athttp://uscode.house.gov.
Delegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies Congress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws (see Chapter 5 "Administrative Law").
The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative agencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies.
Examples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 19  It is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers to an agency.
It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether avoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 "Administrative Law").
Agencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year.
Rules that are formally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online at http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html.
State Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law Statutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society.
States have legislatures (sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives.
Like the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to the governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature.
Like the president, governors often have a veto power.
The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political negotiation and compromise.
On a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a state’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances.
Examples of ordinances include local building codes, zoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking.
Most of the more unusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances.
For example, in Logan County, Colorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a crime to kiss if you have a mustache.
But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there.
Kentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to do so is illegal.
Judicial Decisions: The Common Law Common law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of statutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution.
Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are decided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted.
For example, a state court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a statute) is making common law.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 20  United States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law.
By the time England’s American colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial courts.
English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout the country.
Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime of burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout the country.
Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on past written decisions, is desirable and necessary.
In England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as arson, burglary, homicide, and robbery.
As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified common-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes.
This legislative ability—to modify or change common law into judicial law— points to an important phenomenon: the priority of statutory law over common law.
As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have priority over statutory law.
Priority of Laws The Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law The US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent.
For example, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-sponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the First Amendment to protect free speech.
Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a lawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the state’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment.
(As we will see in Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the First Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in the First Amendment did not negate existing common law.)
Statutes and Cases Statutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions).
Under common-law judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 21  wage they wanted, and not pay overtime work at a higher rate.
But various statutes changed that.
For example, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay wage and overtime pay rules.
Treaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule A treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute.
Thus when Congress ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were inconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA commitments—would no longer be valid.
Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) would override previous federal or state statutes.
One example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-dolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico.
The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments in 1988 spelled out certain protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the United States began refusing to allow the importation of tuna that were caught using “dolphin-unfriendly” methods (such as purse seining).
This was challenged at a GATT dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United States lost.
The discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution process.
In short, US environmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations.
Under most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its sovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective.
That is, the United States may “unbind” itself whenever it chooses.
But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the nation.
The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it makes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, the WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run.
This argument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage.
Ultimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a leader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 22  process.
Had Ross Perot been elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term of office.
Causes of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis No matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are those that can be tied to one or more causes of action.
Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, regulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action.
If you have an agreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for them after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your complaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s contract law.
This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill had some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, his being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim that the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use to him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him.
An old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis non curat lex).
Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action.
If you are stood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a court of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can use in your complaint.
If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding ceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit.
“Breach of promise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, either by judicial decision or by legislation.
Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause of action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-disappearing cause of action.
Your cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases.
How closely your case “fits” with a prior decided case raises the question of precedent.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 23  As noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent and what is called stare decisis.
A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a way similar to previously decided cases.
Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread throughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, consistent group of decisions.
The English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, torts, contracts, or property.
Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts.
By their nature, courts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general rules, that would apply to later cases.
Suppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all.
Suppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer and the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger person was replacing him.
The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee had stated a “cause of action” against the employer.
If the court decided that the case was not legally actionable, it would dismiss the action.
Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way.
In the process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no reason.
This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up.
But suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in a court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical act.
Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment.
Courts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” might rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness stand.
Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge employees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur legal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 24  In each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain the reasons for its ruling.
In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason.
In the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of citizenship might be used as reasons.
Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to others, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions.
That is, reasonable people will disagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision.
Written judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying the issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding.
What has the court actually decided, and why?
Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, is not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and state courts that encounter similar issues.
Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions to be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is.
A holding is the court’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the meaning of the case as a precedent for future cases.
Beyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to understand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) each trial or appellate judge believes in.
Because judges do not always agree on first principles (i.e., they subscribe to different schools of legal thought), there are many divided opinions in appellate opinions and in each US Supreme Court term.
KEY TAKEAWAY There are different sources of law in the US legal system.
The US Constitution is foundational; US statutory and common law cannot be inconsistent with its provisions.
Congress creates statutory law (with the signature of the president), and courts will interpret constitutional law and statutory law.
Where there is neither constitutional law nor statutory law, the courts function in the realm of common law.
The same is true of law within the fifty states, each of which also has a constitution, or foundational law.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 25  Both the federal government and the states have created administrative agencies.
An agency only has the power that the legislature gives it.
Within the scope of that power, an agency will often create regulations (see Chapter 5 "Administrative Law"), which have the same force and effect as statutes.
Treaties are never negotiated and concluded by states, as the federal government has exclusive authority over relations with other nation-states.
A treaty, once ratified by the Senate, has the same force and effect as a statute passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.
Constitutions, statutes, regulations, treaties, and court decisions can provide a legal basis in the positive law.
You may believe you have been wronged, but for you to have a right that is enforceable in court, you must have something in the positive law that you can point to that will support a cause of action against your chosen defendant.

1.5 Legal and Political Systems of the World LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe how the common-law system differs from the civil-law system.
Other legal and political systems are very different from the US system, which came from English common-law traditions and the framers of the US Constitution.
Our legal and political traditions are different both in what kinds of laws we make and honor and in how disputes are resolved in court.
Comparing Common-Law Systems with Other Legal Systems Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 26  The common-law tradition is unique to England, the United States, and former colonies of the British Empire.
Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit their judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all of them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, legislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems.
Civil-Law Systems The main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman and Napoleonic law.
A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more comprehensive legislative enactments.
During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—was developed for all of France.
The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and procedure, and commercial law.
The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other continental European legal systems.
The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without a jury.
Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases.
As George Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He goes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French courts may feel bound to reach the same result in future cases, under the doctrine ofjurisprudence constante.
The major agency for growth and change, however, is the legislature, not the courts.” Civil-law systems are used throughout Europe as well as in Central and South America.
Some nations in Asia and Africa have also adopted codes based on European civil law.
Germany, Holland, Spain, France, and Portugal all had colonies outside of Europe, and many of these colonies adopted the legal practices that were imposed on them by colonial rule, much like the original thirteen states of the United States, which adopted English common-law practices.
One source of possible confusion at this point is that we have already referred to US civil law in contrast to criminal law.
But the European civil law covers both civil and criminal law.
There are also legal systems that differ significantly from the common-law and civil-law systems.
The communist and socialist legal systems that remain (e.g., in Cuba and North Korea) operate on very different assumptions than those of either English common law or European Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 27  civil law.
Islamic and other religion-based systems of law bring different values and assumptions to social and commercial relations.
KEY TAKEAWAY Legal systems vary widely in their aims and in the way they process civil and criminal cases.
Common-law systems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent.
Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, often use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases.
EXERCISE 1.
Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems.
Which Asian nations came to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why?
1.6 A Sample Case Preliminary Note to Students Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose workforce exceeds fifteen people.
The text of Title VII says that (a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin.
At common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers were generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally free to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the employer and the employee had a contract).
This rule has been called “employment at will.” State and federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially legislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule.
In the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual harassment.
Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued employment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 28  environment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk.
This form of sexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment.
Notice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms about discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors).
Having set the broad policy, Congress left it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of civil litigation.
This is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, an appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court.
Teresa Harris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has petitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme Court), a petition that is granted less than one out of every fifty times.
The Supreme Court, in other words, chooses its cases carefully.
Here, the court wanted to resolve a difference of opinion among the various circuit courts of appeal as to whether or not a plaintiff in a hostile-working-environment claim could recover damages without showing “severe psychological injury.” Harris v. Forklift Systems 510 U.S. 17 (U.S. Supreme Court 1992) JUDGES: O’CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
SCALIA, J., and GINSBURG, J., filed concurring opinions.
JUSTICE O’CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we consider the definition of a discriminatorily “abusive work environment” (also known as a “hostile work environment”) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat.
253, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
§ 2000e et seq.
(1988 ed., Supp.
III).
I Teresa Harris worked as a manager at Forklift Systems, Inc., an equipment rental company, from April 1985 until October 1987.
Charles Hardy was Forklift’s president.
The Magistrate found that, throughout Harris’ time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of her gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendoes.
Hardy told Harris on several occasions, in the presence of other employees, “You’re a woman, what do you know” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 29  and “We need a man as the rental manager”; at least once, he told her she was “a dumbass woman.” Again in front of others, he suggested that the two of them “go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris’s] raise.” Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants pocket.
He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick the objects up.
He made sexual innuendoes about Harris’ and other women’s clothing.
In mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct.
Hardy said he was surprised that Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized.
He also promised he would stop, and based on this assurance Harris stayed on the job.
But in early September, Hardy began anew: While Harris was arranging a deal with one of Forklift’s customers, he asked her, again in front of other employees, “What did you do, promise the guy…some [sex] Saturday night?” On October 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit.
Harris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy’s conduct had created an abusive work environment for her because of her gender.
The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, adopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate, found this to be “a close case,” but held that Hardy’s conduct did not create an abusive environment.
The court found that some of Hardy’s comments “offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman,” but that they were not “so severe as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris’s] psychological well-being.
A reasonable woman manager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not have risen to the level of interfering with that person’s work performance.
“Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury.…Although Hardy may at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do not believe that he created a working environment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris].” In focusing on the employee’s psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit precedent.
See Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co., 805 F.2d 611, 620 (CA6 1986), cert.
denied, 481 U.S. 1041, 95 L. Ed.
2d 823, 107 S. Ct. 1983 (1987).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in a brief unpublished decision…reported at 976 F.2d 733 (1992).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 30  We granted certiorari, 507 U.S. 959 (1993), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on whether conduct, to be actionable as “abusive work environment” harassment (no quid pro quo harassment issue is present here), must “seriously affect [an employee’s] psychological well- being” or lead the plaintiff to “suffer injury.” Compare Rabidue (requiring serious effect on psychological well-being); Vance v. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co., 863 F.2d 1503, 1510 (CA11 1989) (same); and Downes v. FAA, 775 F.2d 288, 292 (CA Fed.
1985) (same), with Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 877–878 (CA9 1991) (rejecting such a requirement).
II Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an employer…to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C.
§ 2000e-2(a)(1).
As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination.
The phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.
Id., at 64, quoting Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed.
2d 657, 98 S. Ct. 1370 (1978).
When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated.
This standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury.
As we pointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII.
Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s purview.
Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 31  environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII violation.
But Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown.
A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers.
Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality.
The appalling conduct alleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert.
denied, 406 U.S. 957,32 L. Ed.
2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment.
They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.
We therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected plaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly focus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not require.
Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s psychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct.
So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.
This is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test.
We need not answer today all the potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed.

But we can say that whether an environment is “hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.
These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 32  unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.
The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.
But while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.
III Forklift, while conceding that a requirement that the conduct seriously affect psychological well- being is unfounded, argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the Meritor standard.
We disagree.
Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not “intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe as to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not “subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid.
The District Court’s application of these incorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court found this to be a “close case.” We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
So ordered.
Note to Students This was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case.
Many feminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile- working-environment claims under Title VII more difficult to win.
That did not happen.
When the question to be decided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case.
Here, the question that the court poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological injury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the court revisits a similar question and answers it differently.
This does happen, but happens rarely.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case?
How can you tell?
2.
Is the court concerned with making a procedural rule here, or is the court making a statement about the substantive law?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 33  3.
Is this a case where the court is interpreting the Constitution, a federal statute, a state statute, or the common law?
4.
In Harris v. Forklift, what if the trial judge does not personally agree that women should have any rights to equal treatment in the workplace?
Why shouldn’t that judge dismiss the case even before trial?
Or should the judge dismiss the case after giving the female plaintiff her day in court?
5.
What was the employer’s argument in this case?
Do you agree or disagree with it?
What if those who legislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all?
1.7 Summary and Exercises Summary There are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be.
Laws and legal systems differ worldwide.
The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself inspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government but only protected by government.
The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on which nation-state you look at.
Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job of allowing civil and political freedoms.
Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect the nature and quality of the legal system within that nation.
This chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, positive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies.
It has also given you a brief background in common law, including contracts, torts, and criminal law.
The differences between civil and criminal cases, substance and procedure, and the various sources of law have also been reviewed.
Each source has a different level of authority, starting with constitutions, which are primary and will negate any lower-court laws that are not consistent with its principles and provisions.
The basic differences between the common law and civil law (continental, or European) systems of law are also discussed.

Alfred North Whitehead LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Define ethics and explain the importance of good ethics for business people and business organizations.
2.
Understand the principal philosophies of ethics, including utilitarianism, duty-based ethics, and virtue ethics.
3.
Distinguish between the ethical merits of various choices by using an ethical decision model.
4.
Explain the difference between shareholder and stakeholder models of ethical corporate governance.
5.
Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business organization.
Few subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, whether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder value.
While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is plenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves.
However, business organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the media, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible investors at their peril.
Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 37  interests of many companies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as well as profits.
This chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences between legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives that apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society.
2.1 What Is Ethics?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical.
2.
Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal compliance.
Most of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality.
The question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in any situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act is “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?
People sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social implications.
Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics.
Ethics would be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, or the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants.
We will venture a definition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms.
People often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of corporations and nations.
There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can fairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a conscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either.
Still, our ordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” and others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by the governments or people of that nation.
For Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 38  example, if North Korea is characterized by the US president as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in certain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient.
In talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing.
If we say that Microsoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of Microsoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to influence administrative agencies.
Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about the civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft.
In the first set of judgments, we use the word goodbut mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we using the word good in its ethical or moral sense.
A word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values.
If I like Daniel and try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-looking?
Well-off?
Fun to be with?
Humorous?
Athletic?
Smart?
I could answer all of those questions with a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities.
But if I said that he was honest, caring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many people would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities.
If I said that he keeps the Golden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person.
But if I said that he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make inferences or assumptions about his character or ethics.
There are three key points here: 1.
Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions about what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral.
2.
As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them.
3.
Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a person or company is ethical.
Here is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to recognize an ethical problem, have a clear and usable decision-making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage to do what’s right.
All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees vary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character.
There is no Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 39  universally accepted way for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly disagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel loyal and accountable to one another.
Before talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society operates and is governed.
How Do Law and Ethics Differ?
There is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence.
Few would choose a professional service, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always following the letter of the law.
There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize that law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean excellent service to customers, clients, or patients.
Business ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics.
Simply put, what is legal is not necessarily ethical.
Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal.
There are lots of legal maneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much.
Here are two propositions about business and ethics.
Consider whether they strike you as true or whether you would need to know more in order to make a judgment.
• Individuals and organizations have reputations.
(For an individual, moral reputation is most often tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, fair, and caring?
The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, customers, the community, and employees feel toward it.
Although an organization is not a person in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their perception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, investors, employees, government officials).
• The goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether the actions are favorably viewed.
(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a business as an asset that the buyer pays for.
While it is difficult to place a monetary value on goodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 40  accounting before the sale.
Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price for a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the public’s attention.)
Another reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to express some moral view.
If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is because people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong.
If there are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a group decision that doing so is immoral.
Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society regards as right or wrong.
Finally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to understand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing controversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion.
Some ethical perspectives focus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice.
People consciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they completely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views.
Fundamentally, the difference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values.
These are hot-button issues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values.
Understanding the varied moral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating in these important discussions.
Why Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical?
The usual answer is that good ethics is good business.
In the long run, businesses that pay attention to ethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers.
But this is a difficult claim to measure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet no generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured.
In addition, life is still lived in the short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more profitable.
Some years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep trouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 41  rights.
Consumers were boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic of short-term profit maximization.
Since then, changes have been made.
The CEO told one group of business ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything right, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, all of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity.
The market does respond to unethical behavior.
In Section 2.4 "Corporations and Corporate Governance", you will read about the Sears Auto Centers case.
The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, even though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for.
Years later, there are people who will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, and many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well.
The Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic.
A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely with Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures.
Suspiciously, Andersen’s Houston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for Enron.
A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme Court.
But it was too late.
Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that were not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company.
Even without the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share.
The irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who founded the firm built it on integrity and straightforward practices.
“Think straight, talk straight” was the company’s motto.
Andersen established the company’s reputation for integrity over a hundred years ago by refusing to play numbers games for a potentially lucrative client.
Maximizing profits while being legally compliant is not a very inspiring goal for a business.
People in an organization need some quality or excellence to strive for.
By focusing on pushing the edge of what is legal, by looking for loopholes in the law that would help create short-term Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 42  financial gain, companies have often learned that in the long term they are not actually satisfying the market, the shareholders, the suppliers, or the community generally.
KEY TAKEAWAY Legal compliance is not the same as acting ethically.
Your reputation, individually or corporately, depends on how others regard your actions.
Goodwill is hard to measure or quantify, but it is real nonetheless and can best be protected by acting ethically.

2.2 Major Ethical Perspectives LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the various major theories about ethics in human decision making.
2.
Begin considering how the major theories about ethics apply to difficult choices in life and business.
There are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical issues.
Some of them have been around for centuries.
It is important to know that many who think a lot about business and ethics have deeply held beliefs about which perspective is best.
Others would recommend Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 43  considering ethical problems from a variety of different perspectives.
Here, we take a brief look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social justice and social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory.
We are leaving out some important perspectives, such as general theories of justice and “rights” and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy.
Utilitarianism Utilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the free-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and economics.
Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill (who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good.
Utilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results.
An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or right if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society.
Originally intended as a guide for legislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced individually and by corporations.
Bentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society would be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad consequences of each.
The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the policy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness.
In brief, the utilitarian principle holds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the sum of utilities from any other possible act.
This statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the greatest good to society?
“Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, if followed regularly, will create the greatest good?
Notice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can measure the utilities involved.
(This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.)
Notice also that “the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act or set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, instead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole.
Notice that the theory does not tell us what kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a good a year from today.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 44  Whatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business.
It is found in such diverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, environmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, marketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning.
In management, people will often employ a form of utility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y.
But the issue in most of these cost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the person or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole.
An individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the company?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall.
Another common failing is to see only one or two options that seem reasonable.
The following are some frequent mistakes that people make in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: 1.
Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the greatest benefit for the greatest number.
Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives without thinking carefully about other courses of action.
If the alternative does more good than harm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay.
2.
Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, looking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind.
3.
Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company.
The now-classic Ford Pinto case demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs of not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury.
General Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would not recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to.
In 2010, Toyota learned the same lesson.
4.
Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of people.
5.
Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 45  6.
Assuming that all values can be reduced to money.
In comparing the risks to human health or safety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare apples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety.
Rules and Duty: Deontology In contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel Kant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct than achieving the right results.
A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from doing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought.
Duties, according to Kant, are not specific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings.
Kant therefore uses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings.
It considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, whether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or old.
For Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any particular law or action to determine whether it is ethical.
For example, if you were to consider misrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that doing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so.
(What harm would it be?
you might ask yourself.
When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the employer and I are clearly better off as a result!)
Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course of action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times.
There are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility.
Consider reversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after the decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of action that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you.
Again, deontologyrequires that we put duty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings.
In considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you were the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job because someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments.
If the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 46  consequences of such an exercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical.
The second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency.
This is more abstract.
A deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as a general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable.
But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to lying, since no one would believe anyone.
It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and is generally practiced that lying even becomes possible!
That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it depends on the preexistence of honesty.
Similar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing most crimes, including rape, murder, and theft.
But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers.
In the gray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply.
If breaking a promise would save a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply.
If some amount of pollution can allow employment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful.
Finally, we should note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” emphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it if someone did this to me?”).
Social Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory Social justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods among a group of people?
Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to according to their needs.
But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what and when.
Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary.
Certain economists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 "Corporations and Corporate Governance") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society, believing that the government should play that role.
Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will often admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, assistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, education, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 47  People who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government goods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all.
One response might be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in a “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government.
He called this thesocial contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and common benefits.
In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between human desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension.
Some commentators also see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration and limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society.
Also, if a corporation is legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this corporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked!
Modern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), observe that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good.
Your college or school is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks behind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, the sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, or standards that people can buy into or not.
If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free (though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country.
Donaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules of smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or California) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany).
Our Constitution can be seen as a fundamental social contract.
It is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as the US Constitution can be amended.
Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and organic changes.
Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain fundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not.
People can give up freedom-oriented rights (such as the right of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 48  free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism).
For example, many citizens in Russia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and predictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom.
Thus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the society.
This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as Gandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious terms, from some transcendent moral order.
Another important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook.
Communitarians emphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a duty.
Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni.
Etzioni was a founder of the Communitarian Network, which is a group of individuals who have come together to bolster the moral, social, and political environment.
It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope.
The relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: 1.
If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put reasonable limits on it.
For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, but you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life.
Even if your criticisms are strong and insistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak freely.
In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political leadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit.
2.
Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between individuals.
Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and when someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the positive law of your state—have been violated.
Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights and to not punch you in the nose.
3.
Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies through the courts and political institutions of society.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 49  A distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important.
Basic rights may include such fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety.
Another distinction is between positive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments).
Yet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or civic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process).
Aristotle and Virtue Theory Virtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly in contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics.
Virtue theory emphasizes the value of virtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results.
Aristotle is often recognized as the first philosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character.
As LaRue Hosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, and excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, and high-mindedness.
This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy.
[1] Aristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some ranking that we do among those goals or goods.
Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that mean, exactly?
Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing feature of humans, as opposed to other species.
And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must be associated with reason.
Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of reason.
The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational pursuit of personal excellence, or virtue.
Aristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in eating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or taking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather than the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) gentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) friendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 50  modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) righteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.
From a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-fashioned or even odd.
Magnificence, for example, is not something we commonly speak of.
Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue is these days?
(2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway?
(3) What do virtues have to do with companies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact with other parts of the organization?
As to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate.
A corporation is obviously not the same as an individual.
But there seems to be growing agreement that organizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven.
If all a company cares about is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear.
Quite a few books have been written in the past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be competitive in today’s global economy.
[2] As to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove helpful.
Josephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process Michael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core valueshas been identified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate decisions.
To simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States.
When you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, power, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality.
They may also value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity.
The qualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics.
That is, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list.
You can be, like the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but dishonest, or wealthy but uncaring.
You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, power, wealth) that are not per se virtuous.
Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good sense of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 51  humor does not mean that he is ethical.
But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or poor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical.
Among the virtues, are any especially important?
Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in Marina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone agrees are important to them.
When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be known by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: (1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship.
Note that these values are distinctly ethical.
While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and intelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our character and habits.
But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make us more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values.
Notice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less universally agreed upon.
Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed on, practiced, or admired by all.
Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving money or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage.
Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on their beliefs.
Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy debt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex.
Some would dispute this, saying that you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex.
But the point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and sexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do.
The importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known.
Often we remember the last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous good acts.
For example, Eliot Spitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good they accomplished as public servants.
As for a company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value that when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover.
Shell, Nike, and other companies have discovered that there is a market for morality, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 52  however difficult to measure, and that not paying attention to business ethics often comes at a serious price.
In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and compliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also because major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be pursued proactively.
For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue becomes a habit.
Companies are gradually learning the same lesson.
KEY TAKEAWAY Throughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers have come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social contract theory; and virtue ethics.
EXERCISES XYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles.
Customers have had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal speed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to work.
Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to do so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration.
Internal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are not being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal.
In fact, there appears to be a possible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen.
Interference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem.
It is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), but the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints.
Recalling the two models so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be extremely costly.
Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on which their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall.
They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, it makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data.
After a hundred or more accidents and nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 53  notifying NHTSA, which has its own experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models.
Experts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain absolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical components of the electronic system.
The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one top executive put it—“too time- consuming and expensive.” 1.
Can XYZ’s approach to this problem be justified under utilitarian theory?
If so, how?
If not, why not?
2.
What would Kant advise XYZ to do?
Explain.
3.
What would the “virtuous” approach be for XYZ in this situation?

2.3 An Ethical Decision Model LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Understand one model for ethical decision making: a process to arrive at the most ethical option for an individual or a business organization, using a virtue ethics approach combined with some elements of stakeholder analysis and utilitarianism.
Josephson’s Core Values Model Once you recognize that there is a decision that involves ethical judgment, Michael Josephson would first have you ask as many questions as are necessary to get a full background on the relevant facts.
Then, assuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: 1.
Identify the stakeholders.
That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions that might be made here?
2.
Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 54  3.
Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision.
4.
Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values.
5.
If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which decision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders.
It is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why.
In Milton Friedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders.
In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods Market, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come first, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 "Corporations and Corporate Governance").
The Core Values Here are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics.
Trustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be sincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and don’t betray a trust.
Demonstrate integrity—stand up for what you believe, walk the walk as well as talking the talk; be what you seem to be; show commitment and courage.
Be loyal—stand by your family, friends, co-workers, community, and nation; be discreet with information that comes into your hands; don’t spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don’t violate your principles just to win friendship or approval; don’t ask a friend to do something that is wrong.
Keep promises—keep your word, honor your commitments, and pay your debts; return what you borrow.
Respect: Judge people on their merits, not their appearance; be courteous, polite, appreciative, and accepting of differences; respect others’ right to make decisions about their own lives; don’t abuse, demean, mistreat anyone; don’t use, manipulate, exploit, or take advantage of others.
Responsibility: Be accountable—think about the consequences on yourself and others likely to be affected before you act; be reliable; perform your duties; take responsibility for the consequences of your choices; set a good example and don’t make excuses or take credit for other people’s work.
Pursue excellence: Do your best, don’t quit easily, persevere, be diligent, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 55  make all you do worthy of pride.
Exercise self-restraint—be disciplined, know the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do.
Fairness: Treat all people fairly, be open-minded; listen; consider opposing viewpoints; be consistent; use only appropriate considerations; don’t let personal feelings improperly interfere with decisions; don’t take unfair advantage of mistakes; don’t take more than your fair share.
Caring: Show you care about others through kindness, caring, sharing, compassion, and empathy; treat others the way you want to be treated; don’t be selfish, mean, cruel, or insensitive to others’ feelings.
Citizenship: Play by the rules, obey laws; do your share, respect authority, stay informed, vote, protect your neighbors, pay your taxes; be charitable, help your community; protect the environment, conserve resources.
When individuals and organizations confront ethical problems, the core values decision model offered by Josephson generally works well (1) to clarify the gains and losses of the various stakeholders, which then raises ethical awareness on the part of the decision maker and (2) to provide a fairly reliable guide as to what the most ethical decision would be.
In nine out of ten cases, step 5 in the decision process is not needed.
That said, it does not follow that students (or managers) would necessarily act in accord with the results of the core values decision process.
There are many psychological pressures and organizational constraints that place limits on people both individually and in organizations.
These pressures and constraints tend to compromise ideal or the most ethical solutions for individuals and for organizations.
For a business, one essential problem is that ethics can cost the organization money or resources, at least in the short term.
Doing the most ethical thing will often appear to be something that fails to maximize profits in the short term or that may seem pointless because if you or your organization acts ethically, others will not, and society will be no better off, anyway.
KEY TAKEAWAY Having a step-by-step process to analyze difficult moral dilemmas is useful.
One such process is offered here, based on the core values of trustworthiness, caring, respect, fairness, responsibility, and citizenship.
EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 56  1.
Consider XYZ in the exercises for Section 2.2.5 "Josephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process" and use the core values decision-making model.
What are XYZ’s options when they first notice that two of their models are causing sudden acceleration incidents that put their customers at risk?
Who are the stakeholders?
What options most clearly meet the criteria for each of the core values?
2.4 Corporations and Corporate Governance LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain the basic structure of the typical corporation and how the shareholders own the company and elect directors to run it.
2.
Understand how the shareholder profit-maximization model is different from stakeholder theory.
3.
Discern and describe the ethical challenges for corporate cultures.
4.
Explain what conscious capitalism is and how it differs from stakeholder theory.
Legal Organization of the Corporation Figure 2.1 Corporate Legal Structure Figure 2.1 "Corporate Legal Structure", though somewhat oversimplified, shows the basic legal structure of a corporation under Delaware law and the laws of most other states in the United States.
Shareholders elect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company.
From this Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 57  structure, some very basic realities follow.
Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers hired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are not always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like.
Nor does the law require officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the company.
This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and other top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders.
For example, a CEO might trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders.
Even board members are susceptible to misalignment of interets; for example, board members might resist hostile takeover bids because they would likely lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though the tender offer would benefit stockholders.
Among other attempted realignments, the use of stock options was an attempt to make managers more attentive to the value of company stock, but the law of unintended consequences was in full force; managers tweaked and managed earnings in the bubble of the 1990s bull market, and “managing by numbers” became an epidemic in corporations organized under US corporate law.
The rights of shareholders can be bolstered by changes in state and federal law, and there have been some attempts to do that since the late 1990s.
But as owners, shareholders have the ultimate power to replace nonperforming or underperforming directors, which usually results in changes at the C- suite level as well.
Shareholders and Stakeholders There are two main views about what the corporation’s duties are.
The first view—maximizing profits—is the prevailing view among business managers and in business schools.
This view largely follows the idea of Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners.
In essence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible.
In terms of the legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have legally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders.
Those legally prescribed duties are a reflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a responsible agent for the owners.
In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty.
Directors have the same Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 58  duties toward shareholders.
Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about corporations and social responsibility.
Maximizing Profits: Milton Friedman Economist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to make the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders.
Friedman’s beliefs are noted at length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous 1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is a major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970.
“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” Milton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 What does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities?
Only people can have responsibilities.
A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial responsibilities, but “business” as a whole cannot be said to have responsibilities, even in this vague sense.… Presumably, the individuals who are to be responsible are businessmen, which means individual proprietors or corporate executives.…In a free enterprise, private-property system, a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business.
He has direct responsibility to his employers.
That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… …[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the eleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… Of course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right.
As a person, he may have other responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his feeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country.
He may feel impelled by these responsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 59  particular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not an agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the time or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes.
If these are “social responsibilities,” they are the social responsibilities of individuals, not of business.
What does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a “social responsibility” in his capacity as businessman?
If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some way that is not in the interest of his employers.
For example, that he is to refrain from increasing the price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even though a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation.
Or that he is to make expenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the corporation or that is required by law in order to contribute to the social objective of improving the environment.
Or that, at the expense of corporate profits, he is to hire “hardcore” unemployed instead of better qualified available workmen to contribute to the social objective of reducing poverty.
In each of these cases, the corporate executive would be spending someone else’s money for a general social interest.
Insofar as his actions…reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their money.
Insofar as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customers’ money.
Insofar as his actions lower the wages of some employees, he is spending their money.
This process raises political questions on two levels: principle and consequences.
On the level of political principle, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental functions.
We have established elaborate constitutional, parliamentary, and judicial provisions to control these functions, to assure that taxes are imposed so far as possible in accordance with the preferences and desires of the public.… Others have challenged the notion that corporate managers have no real duties except toward the owners (shareholders).
By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists widened the range of people and institutions that a corporation should pay moral consideration to.
Thus they contend that a corporation, through its management, has a set of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests.
Stakeholder Theory Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 60  Stakeholders of a corporation include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the community.
Stakeholder is a deliberate play on the word shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations that extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits.
A stakeholder is anyone who most would agree is significantly affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another moral agent.
There is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation is a creation of the law.
Without law (and government), corporations would not have existence.
The key concept for corporations is the legal fact of limited liability.
The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of capital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should the venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal assets other than the value of the corporate stock.
Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make incorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the benefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose that the company would serve.
In the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy.
These two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public purpose.
Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate form.
That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a corporation’s shareholders have limited liability.
This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for good and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation.
But with this right comes a related duty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form of doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so.
Implicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations are considered socially useful, they can exist.
But do they have explicit social responsibilities?
Milton Friedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any other social obligations.
But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say that a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 61  staying within the law and go beyond the corporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be affected by corporate decisions.
According to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other business organizations) must pay attention not only to the bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community.
Public perception of a company’s unfairness, uncaring, disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term failure, whatever the short-term successes or profits may be.
A socially responsible corporation is likely to consider the impact of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just shareholders.
As Table 2.1 "The Stakes of Various Stakeholders" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests (“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation.
Table 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders Managers Directors who own stock The value of the organization has a direct impact on the Ownership wealth of these stakeholders.
Shareholders Salaried managers Creditors Suppliers Employees Stakeholders can be economically dependent without Economic having ownership.
Each of these stakeholders relies on Local Dependence the corporation in some way for financial well-being.
communities Communities These stakeholders are not directly linked to the Government Social organization but have an interest in making sure the Interests organization acts in a socially responsible manner.
Media Corporate Culture and Codes of Ethics A corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system.
(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 62  Court.)
Moreover, many corporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members.
Often, the culture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to break the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds.
What follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture.
Ethical Leadership Is Top-Down People in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say.
Regardless of managers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded.
If the CEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her.
People at the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior.
Accountability Is Often Weak Clever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before “funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light.
[1]Again, we see that the manager is often an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self- interest than for the corporate interest.
Killing the Messenger Where organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy.
If they call attention to problems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news.
Managers like to hear good news and discourage bad news.
Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the whistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and with the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news.
In many organizations, “killing the messenger” solves the problem.
Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately shut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention.
[2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a letter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her.
[3] Ethics Codes Without strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not have the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy.
Ethics codes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 63  have been put in place—partly in response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management.
The best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance driven.
The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated corporate response.
[4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and modeled by the top of the organization.
It’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it.
If the code is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good conduct within the corporation.
The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, whether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment.
If the message is not continuously reinforced, or (worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that violations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or sexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance.
The ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside partnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them.
[5] Ethics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines The federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991.
The original idea behind these guidelines was for Congress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals.
The guidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and fines.
(While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation itself can be fined.
Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the guidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well.
They can show this by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to report violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the code.
In short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the company, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 64  fines the company will pay.
Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical problems within the company.
Managing by the Numbers If you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get stock price ever higher.
At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra.
Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock price is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche.
It dictates not only how people judge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are doing.
And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior.
[6] Managing by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center Story If winning is the most important thing in your life, then you must be prepared to do anything to win.
—Michael Josephson Most people want to be winners or associate with winners.
As humans, our desire to associate with those who have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers.
But if an individual, a team, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win at all costs.
The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by gaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here.
Sears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth century.
At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) from Sears.
Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans shop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud in many of its auto centers.
The authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year period.
New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found that all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs.
California’s department of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 65  of $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done.
Sears Auto Centers were the largest providers of auto repair services in the state.
The scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine.
Customers received coupons in the mail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs.
When customers came in to redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs.
As a management tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to meet.
Ultimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to revoke Sears’ auto repair license.
Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million customers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January 31, 1992.
Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government investigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training programs.
It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas.
The entire settlement cost Sears $30 million.
Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the scandal broke.
Note that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity.
Losses were incalculable.
The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are.
The case illustrates a number of important lessons: • People generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses.
• People often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired sales quota or financial goal.
• In working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality.
In the Sears case, it is likely that Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian terms) as means rather than ends in themselves.
In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of insiders.
• The long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to measure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially.
• Sears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant information about the service being offered.
This lack of information is a market failure, since Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 66  many consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and at a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier.
Sears, like other sellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would not permit such information distortions.
• People in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary.
Noting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had lost sight of other goals for the organization.
The emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical.
The temptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write the history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done.
In a way, this fits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong.
Conscious Capitalism One effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious capitalism movement.
Companies that practiceconscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and prosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship.
They operate with a holistic or systems view.
This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and interdependent.
They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to achieve win-win-win outcomes for all.
[7] The “conscious business” has a purpose that goes beyond maximizing profits.
It is designed to maximize profits but is focused more on its higher purpose and does not fixate solely on the bottom line.
To do so, it focuses on delivering value to all its stakeholders, harmonizing as best it can the interests of consumers, partners, investors, the community, and the environment.
This requires that company managers take a “servant leadership” role, serving as stewards to the company’s deeper purpose and to the company’s stakeholders.
Conscious business leaders serve as such stewards, focusing on fulfilling the company’s purpose, delivering value to its stakeholders, and facilitating a harmony of interests, rather than on personal gain and self-aggrandizement.
Why is this refocusing needed?
Within the standard profit-maximizing model, corporations have long had to deal with the “agency problem.” Actions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 67  by top-level managers—acting on behalf of the company—should align with the shareholders, but in a culture all about winning and money, managers sometimes act in ways that are self- aggrandizing and that do not serve the interests of shareholders.
Laws exist to limit such self- aggrandizing, but the remedies are often too little and too late and often catch only the most egregious overreaching.
Having a culture of servant leadership is a much better way to see that a company’s top management works to ensure a harmony of interests.

2.5 Summary and Exercises Summary Doing good business requires attention to ethics as well as law.
Understanding the long- standing perspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting out the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses.
Each business needs to create or maintain a culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices but also about the company’s ethical challenges and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 68  practices.
A firm that has purpose and passion beyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself for long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well.
EXERCISES 1.
Consider again Milton Friedman’s article.
a.
What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”?
b.
If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within its rights to disobey the law?
c. What if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from state officials who were overworked and underpaid?
Should the company limit its profits?
Suppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely affecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities.
In polluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”?
What if almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts?
Consider again the Harris v. Forklift case at the end of Chapter 1 "Introduction to Law and Legal Systems".
The Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Harris was entitled to be heard again by the federal district court, which means that there would be a trial on her claim that Mr. Hardy, owner of Forklift Systems, had created a “hostile working environment” for Ms. Harris.
Apart from the legal aspects, did he really do anything unethical?
How can you tell?
a.
Which of his actions, if any, were contrary to utilitarian thinking?
b.
If Kant were his second-in-command and advising him on ethical matters, would he have approved of Mr. Hardy’s behavior?
Why or why not?
Consider the behaviors alleged by Ms. Harris and assume for a moment that they are all true.
In terms of core values, which of these behaviors are not consistent with the core values Josephson points to?
Be specific.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 69  Assume that Forklift Systems is a large public corporation and that the CEO engages in these kinds of behaviors.
Assume also that the board of directors knows about it.
What action should the board take, and why?
Assume that the year is 1963, prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Title VII provisions regarding equal employment opportunity that prohibit discrimination based on sex.
So, Mr. Hardy’s actions are not illegal, fraudulent, or deceitful.
Assume also that he heads a large public company and that there is a large amount of turnover and unhappiness among the women who work for the company.
No one can sue him for being sexist or lecherous, but are his actions consistent with maximizing shareholder returns?
Should the board be concerned?
Notice that this question is really a stand-in for any situation faced by a company today regarding its CEO where the actions are not illegal but are ethically questionable.
What would conscious capitalism tell a CEO or a board to do where some group of its employees are regularly harassed or disadvantaged by top management?
SELF-TEST QUESTIONS 1.
Milton Friedman would have been most likely to agree to which of the following statements?
a.
The purpose of the corporation is to find a path to sustainable corporate profits by paying careful attention to key stakeholders.
b.
The business of business is business.
c. The CEO and the board should have a single-minded focus on delivering maximum value to shareholders of the business.
d. All is fair in love, war, and business.
Milton Friedman meant (using the material quoted in this chapter) that companies should a.

What are some key drawbacks to utilitarian thinking at the corporate level?
a.
The corporation may do a cost-benefit analysis that puts the greatest good of the firm above all other considerations.

c. Short-term interests will be favored over long-term consequences.
d. all of the above e. a and b only Which ethical perspective would allow that under certain circumstances, it might be ethical to lie to a liar?

c. Maximizing profits comes from a focus on higher purposes and harmonizing the interests of various stakeholders.
d. Kantian duties take precedence over cost-benefit analyses.
SELF-TEST ANSWERS 1. c Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 71  2. d 3. d 4. c 5. c Chapter 3 Courts and the Legal Process LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Describe the two different court systems in the United States, and explain why some cases can be filed in either court system.
2.
Explain the importance of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction and know the difference between the two.
3.
Describe the various stages of a civil action: from pleadings, to discovery, to trial, and to appeals.
4.
Describe two alternatives to litigation: mediation and arbitration.
In the United States, law and government are interdependent.
The Constitution establishes the basic framework of government and imposes certain limitations on the powers of government.
In turn, the various branches of government are intimately involved in making, enforcing, and interpreting the law.
Today, much of the law comes from Congress and the state legislatures.
But it is in the courts that legislation is interpreted and prior case law is interpreted and applied.
As we go through this chapter, consider the case of Harry and Kay Robinson.
In which court should the Robinsons file their action?
Can the Oklahoma court hear the case and make a judgment that will be enforceable against all of the defendants?
Which law will the court use to come to a decision?
Will it use New York law, Oklahoma law, federal law, or German law?
Robinson v. Audi Harry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. (Seaway), in Massena, New York, in 1976.
The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that state for a new home in Arizona.
As they passed through Oklahoma, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 72  another car struck their Audi in the rear, causing a fire that severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children.
Later on, the Robinsons brought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Oklahoma, claiming that their injuries resulted from the defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system.
They sued numerous defendants, including the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional distributor, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, Seaway.
Should the Robinsons bring their action in state court or in federal court?
Over which of the defendants will the court have personal jurisdiction?
3.1 The Relationship between State and Federal Court Systems in the United States LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the different but complementary roles of state and federal court systems.
2.
Explain why it makes sense for some courts to hear and decide only certain kinds of cases.
3.
Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court.
Although it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex.
There are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the District of Columbia, and the federal court system.
At the same time, these are not entirely separate; they all have several points of contact.
State and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states.
First, state courts must honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy clause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 "Constitutional Law and US Commerce").
Second, claims arising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or Congress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim.
Third, under the full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in other states.
Thus a contract dispute resolved by an Arkansas court cannot be relitigated in North Dakota when the plaintiff wants to collect on the Arkansas judgment in North Dakota.
Fourth, state courts often must consider the laws of other states in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 73  deciding cases involving issues where two states have an interest, such as when drivers from two different states collide in a third state.
Under these circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of laws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 "Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles").
As state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law and with what happens in state courts.
Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a case involves claims using both state and federal law.
Claims based on federal laws will permit the federal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised.
In those cases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims.
Also, the Supreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an important issue of federal law to be decided.
For example, a convict on death row may claim that the state’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves “cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue.
There is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—namely, cases that arise between citizens of different states.
The federal courts are permitted to hear these cases under their so-calleddiversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction).
A citizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if both were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts.
The Constitution established diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward people from other states and that they would need separate courts.
In 2009, nearly a third of all lawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship.
In these cases, the federal courts were applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law provided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant).
Why are there so many diversity cases in federal courts?
Defense lawyers believe that there is sometimes a “home-court advantage” for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against a nonresident in his local state court.
The defense attorney is entitled to ask for removal to a federal court where there is diversity.
This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 74  in the Constitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than a nonresident defendant.
Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ attorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal court to begin with.
Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal court.
Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal dockets are often less crowded.
This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the higher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench.
In some federal districts, judgments for plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court.
In short, not only law but also legal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts.
State Court Systems The vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts.
Two aspects of civil lawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals.
A court exercising a trial function has original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to them.
A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must accept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the applicable law.
Limited Jurisdiction Courts In most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts.
The lowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts.
These are usually county or municipal courts with original jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, among others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in most states and far less in many states).
Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-plus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases.
One familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for considerably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000).
The advantage of the small claims court is that its procedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 75  business district, it is usually open after business hours, and it is speedy.
Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some states are not allowed to appear in court.
General Jurisdiction Courts All other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction.
These go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its general trial court the supreme court).
These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents such as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract.
These state courts also prosecute those accused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes.
The fact finder in these general jurisdiction courts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens.
Although courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve family matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like).
A third were commercial cases, and slightly over 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law").
Most states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes or probate of wills.
Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party dissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction.
Because there has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo.
It is not an appeal, since the case essentially starts over.
Appellate Courts The losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher courts.
These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in forty states.
They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a procedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied.
For example, the appellant (the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning of the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question.
The appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that the appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed.
The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can affirm, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 76  modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for retrial).
The last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, which is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state capital.
(The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated in various locations around the state.)
In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New York, it is known as the court of appeals.
In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have the right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear.
For most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final.
In a relatively small class of cases—those in which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue a writ of certiorariremains a possibility.
The Federal Court System District Courts The federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.
At the first level are the federal district courts, which are the trial courts in the federal system.
Every state has one or more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and the more populous states (California, Texas, and New York) have four.
The federal court with the heaviest commercial docket is the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
There are forty-four district judges and fifteen magistrates in this district.
The district judges throughout the United States commonly preside over all federal trials, both criminal and civil.
Courts of Appeal Cases from the district courts can then be appealed to the circuit courts of appeal, of which there are thirteen (Figure 3.1 "The Federal Judicial Circuits").
Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in several states.
For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district courts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont.
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears appeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam.
The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the district court in Washington, DC, as well Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 77  as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 "Administrative Law").
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears appeals in patent and customs cases.
Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes there will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en banc.” There are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system.
These include the US Tax Court, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims.
United States Supreme Court Overseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC.
It consists of nine justices—the chief justice and eight associate justices.
(This number is not constitutionally required; Congress can establish any number.
It has been set at nine since after the Civil War.)
The Supreme Court has selective control over most of its docket.
By law, the cases it hears represent only a tiny fraction of the cases that are submitted.
In 2008, the Supreme Court had numerous petitions (over 7,000, not including thousands of petitions from prisoners) but heard arguments in only 87 cases.
The Supreme Court does not sit in panels.
All the justices hear and consider each case together, unless a justice has a conflict of interest and must withdraw from hearing the case.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 78  Figure 3.1 The Federal Judicial Circuits Federal judges—including Supreme Court justices—are nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate.
Unlike state judges, who are usually elected and preside for a fixed term of years, federal judges sit for life unless they voluntarily retire or are impeached.
KEY TAKEAWAY Trial courts and appellate courts have different functions.
State trial courts sometimes hear cases with federal law issues, and federal courts sometimes hear cases with state law issues.
Within both state and federal court systems, it is useful to know the different kinds of courts and what cases they can decide.
EXERCISES 1.
Why all of this complexity?
Why don’t state courts hear only claims based on state law, and federal courts only federal-law-based claims?
2.
Why would a plaintiff in Iowa with a case against a New Jersey defendant prefer to have the case heard in Iowa?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 79  3.
James, a New Jersey resident, is sued by Jonah, an Iowa resident.
After a trial in which James appears and vigorously defends himself, the Iowa state court awards Jonah $136,750 dollars in damages for his tort claim.
In trying to collect from James in New Jersey, Jonah must have the New Jersey court certify the Iowa judgment.
Why, ordinarily, must the New Jersey court do so?
3.2 The Problem of Jurisdiction LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain the concept of subject matter jurisdiction and distinguish it from personal jurisdiction.
2.
Understand how and where the US Constitution provides a set of instructions as to what federal courts are empowered by law to do.
3.
Know which kinds of cases must be heard in federal courts only.
4.
Explain diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and be able to decide whether a case is eligible for diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts.
Jurisdiction is an essential concept in understanding courts and the legal system.
Jurisdiction is a combination of two Latin words: juris (law) and diction (to speak).
Which court has the power “to speak the law” is the basic question of jurisdiction.
There are two questions about jurisdiction in each case that must be answered before a judge will hear a case: the question of subject matter jurisdiction and the question of personal jurisdiction.
We will consider the question of subject matter jurisdiction first, because judges do; if they determine, on the basis of the initial documents in the case (the “pleadings”), that they have no power to hear and decide that kind of case, they will dismiss it.
The Federal-State Balance: Federalism State courts have their origins in colonial era courts.
After the American Revolution, state courts functioned (with some differences) much like they did in colonial times.
The big difference after 1789 was that state courts coexisted with federal courts.Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s founders in which power is shared between states and the federal government.
This sharing requires a division of labor between the states and the federal government.
It is Article Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 80  III of the US Constitution that spells out the respective spheres of authority (jurisdiction) between state and federal courts.
Take a close look at Article III of the Constitution.
(You can find a printable copy of the Constitution at http://www.findlaw.com.)
Article III makes clear that federal courts are courts of limited power or jurisdiction.
Notice that the only kinds of cases federal courts are authorized to deal with have strong federal connections.
For example, federal courts have jurisdiction when a federal law is being used by the plaintiff or prosecutor (a “federal question” case) or the case arises “in admiralty” (meaning that the problem arose not on land but on sea, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any state, or in navigable waters within the United States).
Implied in this list is the clear notion that states would continue to have their own laws, interpreted by their own courts, and that federal courts were needed only where the issues raised by the parties had a clear federal connection.
The exception to this is diversity jurisdiction, discussed later.
The Constitution was constructed with the idea that state courts would continue to deal with basic kinds of claims such as tort, contract, or property claims.
Since states sanction marriages and divorce, state courts would deal with “domestic” (family) issues.
Since states deal with birth and death records, it stands to reason that paternity suits, probate disputes, and the like usually wind up in state courts.
You wouldn’t go to the federal building or courthouse to get a marriage license, ask for a divorce, or probate a will: these matters have traditionally been dealt with by the states (and the thirteen original colonies before them).
Matters that historically get raised and settled in state court under state law include not only domestic and probate matters but also law relating to corporations, partnerships, agency, contracts, property, torts, and commercial dealings generally.
You cannot get married or divorced in federal court, because federal courts have no jurisdiction over matters that are historically (and are still) exclusively within the domain of state law.
In terms of subject matter jurisdiction, then, state courts will typically deal with the kinds of disputes just cited.
Thus if you are Michigan resident and have an auto accident in Toledo with an Ohio resident and you each blame each other for the accident, the state courts would ordinarily resolve the matter if the dispute cannot otherwise be settled.
Why state courts?
Because when you blame one another and allege that it’s the other person’s fault, you have the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 81  beginnings of a tort case, with negligence as a primary element of the claim, and state courts have routinely dealt with this kind of claim, from British colonial times through Independence and to the present.
(See alsoChapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law" of this text.)
People have had a need to resolve this kind of dispute long before our federal courts were created, and you can tell from Article III that the founders did not specify that tort or negligence claims should be handled by the federal courts.
Again, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, limited to the kinds of cases specified in Article III.
If the case before the federal court does not fall within one of those categories, the federal court cannot constitutionally hear the case because it does not have subject matter jurisdiction.
Always remember: a court must have subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide a case.
Without it, a court cannot address the merits of the controversy or even take the next jurisdictional step of figuring out which of the defendants can be sued in that court.
The question of which defendants are appropriately before the court is a question of personal jurisdiction.
Because there are two court systems, it is important for a plaintiff to file in the right court to begin with.
The right court is the one that has subject matter jurisdiction over the case—that is, the power to hear and decide the kind of case that is filed.
Not only is it a waste of time to file in the wrong court system and be dismissed, but if the dismissal comes after the filing period imposed by the applicable statute of limitations, it will be too late to refile in the correct court system.
Such cases will be routinely dismissed, regardless of how deserving the plaintiff might be in his quest for justice.
(The plaintiff’s only remedy at that point would be to sue his lawyer for negligence for failing to mind the clock and get to the right court in time!)
Exclusive Jurisdiction in Federal Courts With two court systems, a plaintiff (or the plaintiff’s attorney, most likely) must decide whether to file a case in the state court system or the federal court system.
Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over certain kinds of cases.
The reason for this comes directly from the Constitution.
Article III of the US Constitution provides the following: The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 82  to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State; between Citizens of different States; between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.
By excluding diversity cases, we can assemble a list of the kinds of cases that can only be heard in federal courts.
The list looks like this: 1.
Suits between states.
Cases in which two or more states are a party.
2.
Cases involving ambassadors and other high-ranking public figures.
Cases arising between foreign ambassadors and other high-ranking public officials.
3.
Federal crimes.
Crimes defined by or mentioned in the US Constitution or those defined or punished by federal statute.
Such crimes include treason against the United States, piracy, counterfeiting, crimes against the law of nations, and crimes relating to the federal government’s authority to regulate interstate commerce.
However, most crimes are state matters.
4.
Bankruptcy.
The statutory procedure, usually triggered by insolvency, by which a person is relieved of most debts and undergoes a judicially supervised reorganization or liquidation for the benefit of the person’s creditors.
5.
Patent, copyright, and trademark cases a.
Patent.
The exclusive right to make, use, or sell an invention for a specified period (usually seventeen years), granted by the federal government to the inventor if the device or process is novel, useful, and nonobvious.
b.
Copyright.
The body of law relating to a property right in an original work of authorship (such as a literary, musical, artistic, photographic, or film work) fixed in any tangible medium of expression, giving the holder the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, and display the work.
c. Trademark.
A word, phrase, logo, or other graphic symbol used by a manufacturer or seller to distinguish its product or products from those of others.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 83  Admiralty.
The system of laws that has grown out of the practice of admiralty courts: courts that exercise jurisdiction over all maritime contracts, torts, injuries, and offenses.
Antitrust.
Federal laws designed to protect trade and commerce from restraining monopolies, price fixing, and price discrimination.
Securities and banking regulation.
The body of law protecting the public by regulating the registration, offering, and trading of securities and the regulation of banking practices.
Other cases specified by federal statute.
Any other cases specified by a federal statute where Congress declares that federal courts will have exclusive jurisdiction.
Concurrent Jurisdiction When a plaintiff takes a case to state court, it will be because state courts typically hear that kind of case (i.e., there is subject matter jurisdiction).
If the plaintiff’s main cause of action comes from a certain state’s constitution, statutes, or court decisions, the state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.
If the plaintiff’s main cause of action is based on federal law (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.
But federal courts will also have subject matter jurisdiction over certain cases that have only a state-based cause of action; those cases are ones in which the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s) are from different states and the amount in controversy is more than $75,000.
State courts can have subject matter jurisdiction over certain cases that have only a federal- based cause of action.
The Supreme Court has now made clear that state courts haveconcurrent jurisdiction of any federal cause of action unless Congress has given exclusive jurisdiction to federal courts.
In short, a case with a federal question can be often be heard in either state or federal court, and a case that has parties with a diversity of citizenship can be heard in state courts or in federal courts where the tests of complete diversity and amount in controversy are met.
(See Note 3.18 "Summary of Rules on Subject Matter Jurisdiction".)
Whether a case will be heard in a state court or moved to a federal court will depend on the parties.
If a plaintiff files a case in state trial court where concurrent jurisdiction applies, a defendant may (or may not) ask that the case be removed to federal district court.
Summary of Rules on Subject Matter Jurisdiction Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 84  1.
A court must always have subject matter jurisdiction, and personal jurisdiction over at least one defendant, to hear and decide a case.
2.
A state court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case that is not required to be brought in a federal court.
Some cases can only be brought in federal court, such as bankruptcy cases, cases involving federal crimes, patent cases, and Internal Revenue Service tax court claims.
The list of cases for exclusive federal jurisdiction is fairly short.
That means that almost any state court will have subject matter jurisdiction over almost any kind of case.
If it’s a case based on state law, a state court will always have subject matter jurisdiction.
3.
A federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case that is either based on a federal law (statute, case, or US Constitution) OR A federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case based on state law where the parties are (1) from different states and (2) the amount in controversy is at least $75,000.
(1) The different states requirement means that no plaintiff can have permanent residence in a state where any defendant has permanent residence—there must be complete diversity of citizenship as between all plaintiffs and defendants.
(2) The amount in controversy requirement means that a good-faith estimate of the amount the plaintiff may recover is at least $75,000.
NOTE: For purposes of permanent residence, a corporation is considered a resident where it is incorporated AND where it has a principal place of business.
4.
In diversity cases, the following rules apply.
(1) Federal civil procedure rules apply to how the case is conducted before and during trial and any appeals, but (2) State law will be used as the basis for a determination of legal rights and responsibilities.
(a) This “choice of law” process is interesting but complicated.
Basically, each state has its own set of judicial decisions that resolve conflict of laws.
For example, just because A sues B in a Texas court, the Texas court will not necessarily apply Texas law.
Anna and Bobby collide and suffer serious physical injuries while driving their cars in Roswell, New Mexico.
Both live in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 85  Austin, and Bobby files a lawsuit in Austin.
The court there could hear it (having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over Bobby) but would apply New Mexico law, which governs motor vehicle laws and accidents in New Mexico.
Why would the Texas judge do that?
(b) The Texas judge knows that which state’s law is chosen to apply to the case can make a decisive difference in the case, as different states have different substantive law standards.
For example, in a breach of contract case, one state’s version of the Uniform Commercial Code may be different from another’s, and which one the court decides to apply is often exceedingly good for one side and dismal for the other.
In Anna v. Bobby, if Texas has one kind of comparative negligence statute and New Mexico has a different kind of comparative negligence statute, who wins or loses, or how much is awarded, could well depend on which law applies.
Because both were under the jurisdiction of New Mexico’s laws at the time, it makes sense to apply New Mexico law.
(3) Why do some nonresident defendants prefer to be in federal court?
(a) In the state court, the judge is elected, and the jury may be familiar with or sympathetic to the “local” plaintiff.
(b) The federal court provides a more neutral forum, with an appointed, life-tenured judge and a wider pool of potential jurors (drawn from a wider geographical area).
(4) If a defendant does not want to be in state court and there is diversity, what is to be done?
(a) Make a motion for removal to the federal court.
(b) The federal court will not want to add to its caseload, or docket, but must take the case unless there is not complete diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy is less than $75,000.
To better understand subject matter jurisdiction in action, let’s take an example.
Wile E. Coyote wants a federal judge to hear his products-liability action against Acme, Inc., even though the action is based on state law.
Mr. Coyote’s attorney wants to “make a federal case” out of it, thinking that the jurors in the federal district court’s jury pool will understand the case better and be more likely to deliver a “high value” verdict for Mr. Coyote.
Mr. Coyote resides in Arizona, and Acme is incorporated in the state of Delaware and has its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois.
The federal court in Arizona can hear and decide Mr. Coyote’s case Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 86  (i.e., it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case) because of diversity of citizenship.
If Mr. Coyote was injured by one of Acme’s defective products while chasing a roadrunner in Arizona, the federal district court judge would hear his action—using federal procedural law—and decide the case based on the substantive law of Arizona on product liability.
But now change the facts only slightly: Acme is incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of business in Phoenix, Arizona.
Unless Mr. Coyote has a federal law he is using as a basis for his claims against Acme, his attempt to get a federal court to hear and decide the case will fail.
It will fail because there is not complete diversity of citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendant.
Robinson v. Audi Now consider Mr. and Mrs. Robinson and their products-liability claim against Seaway Volkswagen and the other three defendants.
There is no federal products-liability law that could be used as a cause of action.
They are most likely suing the defendants using products-liability law based on common-law negligence or common-law strict liability law, as found in state court cases.
They were not yet Arizona residents at the time of the accident, and their accident does not establish them as Oklahoma residents, either.
They bought the vehicle in New York from a New York–based retailer.
None of the other defendants is from Oklahoma.
They file in an Oklahoma state court, but how will they (their attorney or the court) know if the state court has subject matter jurisdiction?
Unless the case is requiredto be in a federal court (i.e., unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over this kind of case), any state court system will have subject matter jurisdiction, including Oklahoma’s state court system.
But if their claim is for a significant amount of money, they cannot file in small claims court, probate court, or any court in Oklahoma that does not have statutory jurisdiction over their claim.
They will need to file in a court of general jurisdiction.
In short, even filing in the right court system (state versus federal), the plaintiff must be careful to find the court that has subject matter jurisdiction.
If they wish to go to federal court, can they?
There is no federal question presented here (the claim is based on state common law), and the United States is not a party, so the only basis for federal court jurisdiction would be diversity jurisdiction.
If enough time has elapsed since the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 87  accident and they have established themselves as Arizona residents, they could sue in federal court in Oklahoma (or elsewhere), but only if none of the defendants—the retailer, the regional Volkswagen company, Volkswagen of North America, or Audi (in Germany) are incorporated in or have a principal place of business in Arizona.
The federal judge would decide the case using federal civil procedure but would have to make the appropriate choice of state law.
In this case, the choice of conflicting laws would most likely be Oklahoma, where the accident happened, or New York, where the defective product was sold.

Legal Procedure, Including Due Process and Personal Jurisdiction In this section, we consider how lawsuits are begun and how the court knows that it has both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over at least one of the named defendants.
The courts are not the only institutions that can resolve disputes.
In Section 3.8 "Alternative Means of Resolving Disputes", we will discuss other dispute-resolution forums, such as arbitration and mediation.
For now, let us consider how courts make decisions in civil disputes.
Judicial decision making in the context of litigation (civil lawsuits) is a distinctive form of dispute resolution.
First, to get the attention of a court, the plaintiff must make a claim based on existing laws.
Second, courts do not reach out for cases.
Cases are brought to them, usually when an attorney files a case with the right court in the right way, following the various laws that govern all civil Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 88  procedures in a state or in the federal system.
(Most US states’ procedural laws are similar to the federal procedural code.)
Once at the court, the case will proceed through various motions (motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, for example, or insufficient service of process), the proofs (submission of evidence), and the arguments (debate about the meaning of the evidence and the law) of contesting parties.
This is at the heart of the adversary system, in which those who oppose each other may attack the other’s case through proofs and cross-examination.
Every person in the United States who wishes to take a case to court is entitled to hire a lawyer.
The lawyer works for his client, not the court, and serves him as an advocate, or supporter.
The client’s goal is to persuade the court of the accuracy and justness of his position.
The lawyer’s duty is to shape the evidence and the argument—the line of reasoning about the evidence—to advance his client’s cause and persuade the court of its rightness.
The lawyer for the opposing party will be doing the same thing, of course, for her client.
The judge (or, if one is sitting, the jury) must sort out the facts and reach a decision from this cross-fire of evidence and argument.
The method of adjudication—the act of making an order or judgment—has several important features.
First, it focuses the conflicting issues.
Other, secondary concerns are minimized or excluded altogether.
Relevance is a key concept in any trial.
The judge is required to decide the questions presented at the trial, not to talk about related matters.
Second, adjudication requires that the judge’s decision be reasoned, and that is why judges write opinions explaining their decisions (an opinion may be omitted when the verdict comes from a jury).
Third, the judge’s decision must not only be reasoned but also be responsive to the case presented: the judge is not free to say that the case is unimportant and that he therefore will ignore it.
Unlike other branches of government that are free to ignore problems pressing upon them, judges must decide cases.
(For example, a legislature need not enact a law, no matter how many people petition it to do so.)
Fourth, the court must respond in a certain way.
The judge must pay attention to the parties’ arguments and his decision must result from their proofs and arguments.
Evidence that is not presented and legal arguments that are not made cannot be the basis for what the judge decides.
Also, judges are bound by standards of weighing evidence: the burden of proof in a civil case is generally a “preponderance of the evidence.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 89  In all cases, the plaintiff—the party making a claim and initiating the lawsuit (in a criminal case the plaintiff is the prosecution)—has the burden of proving his case.
If he fails to prove it, the defendant—the party being sued or prosecuted—will win.
Criminal prosecutions carry the most rigorous burden of proof: the government must prove its case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.
That is, even if it seems very likely that the defendant committed the crime, as long as there remains some reasonable doubt—perhaps he was not clearly identified as the culprit, perhaps he has an alibi that could be legitimate—the jury must vote to acquit rather than convict.
By contrast, the burden of proof in ordinary civil cases—those dealing with contracts, personal injuries, and most of the cases in this book—is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the plaintiff’s evidence must outweigh whatever evidence the defendant can muster that casts doubts on the plaintiff’s claim.
This is not merely a matter of counting the number of witnesses or of the length of time that they talk: the judge in a trial without a jury (a bench trial), or the jury where one is impaneled, must apply the preponderance of evidence test by determining which side has the greater weight of credible, relevant evidence.
Adjudication and the adversary system imply certain other characteristics of courts.
Judges must be impartial; those with a personal interest in a matter must refuse to hear it.
The ruling of a court, after all appeals are exhausted, is final.
This principle is known as res judicata (Latin for “the thing is decided”), and it means that the same parties may not take up the same dispute in another court at another time.
Finally, a court must proceed according to a public set of formal procedural rules; a judge cannot make up the rules as he goes along.
To these rules we now turn.
How a Case Proceeds Complaint and Summons Beginning a lawsuit is simple and is spelled out in the rules of procedure by which each court system operates.
In the federal system, the plaintiff begins a lawsuit by filing a complaint—a document clearly explaining the grounds for suit—with the clerk of the court.
The court’s agent (usually a sheriff, for state trial courts, or a US deputy marshal, in federal district courts) will then serve the defendant with the complaint and a summons.
The summons is a court document Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 90  stating the name of the plaintiff and his attorney and directing the defendant to respond to the complaint within a fixed time period.
The timing of the filing can be important.
Almost every possible legal complaint is governed by a federal or state statute of limitations, which requires a lawsuit to be filed within a certain period of time.
For example, in many states a lawsuit for injuries resulting from an automobile accident must be filed within two years of the accident or the plaintiff forfeits his right to proceed.
As noted earlier, making a correct initial filing in a court that has subject matter jurisdiction is critical to avoiding statute of limitations problems.
Jurisdiction and Venue The place of filing is equally important, and there are two issues regarding location.
The first is subject matter jurisdiction, as already noted.
A claim for breach of contract, in which the amount at stake is $1 million, cannot be brought in a local county court with jurisdiction to hear cases involving sums of up to only $1,000.
Likewise, a claim for copyright violation cannot be brought in a state superior court, since federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over copyright cases.
The second consideration is venue—the proper geographic location of the court.
For example, every county in a state might have a superior court, but the plaintiff is not free to pick any county.
Again, a statute will spell out to which court the plaintiff must go (e.g., the county in which the plaintiff resides or the county in which the defendant resides or maintains an office).
Service of Process and Personal Jurisdiction The defendant must be “served”—that is, must receive notice that he has been sued.
Service can be done by physically presenting the defendant with a copy of the summons and complaint.
But sometimes the defendant is difficult to find (or deliberately avoids the marshal or other process server).
The rules spell out a variety of ways by which individuals and corporations can be served.
These include using US Postal Service certified mail or serving someone already designated to receive service of process.
A corporation or partnership, for example, is often required by state law to designate a “registered agent” for purposes of getting public notices or receiving a summons and complaint.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 91  One of the most troublesome problems is service on an out-of-state defendant.
The personal jurisdiction of a state court over persons is clear for those defendants found within the state.
If the plaintiff claims that an out-of-state defendant injured him in some way, must the plaintiff go to the defendant’s home state to serve him?
Unless the defendant had some significant contact with the plaintiff’s state, the plaintiff may indeed have to.
For instance, suppose a traveler from Maine stopped at a roadside diner in Montana and ordered a slice of homemade pie that was tainted and caused him to be sick.
The traveler may not simply return home and mail the diner a notice that he is suing it in a Maine court.
But if out-of-state defendants have some contact with the plaintiff’s state of residence, there might be grounds to bring them within the jurisdiction of the plaintiff’s state courts.
In Burger King v. Rudzewicz, Section 3.9 "Cases", the federal court in Florida had to consider whether it was constitutionally permissible to exercise personal jurisdiction over a Michigan franchisee.
Again, recall that even if a court has subject matter jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction over each defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be made.
Often this is not a problem; you might be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state.
Or a nonresident may answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction.
But many defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the inconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum.
Fairness—and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—dictates that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits far from their home base, especially where there is little or no contact or connection between the nonresident and the state where a lawsuit is brought.
Summary of Rules on Personal Jurisdiction 1.
Once a court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction, it must find at least one defendant over which it is “fair” (i.e., in accord with due process) to exercise personal jurisdiction.
2.
If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case can be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 92  1.
But if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or states) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2.
The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the liability of the nonparticipating defendants.
This involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action against the same person (or entity) twice.
It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy.
Res means “thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and should not be judged again.
But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over.
If you have a different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different situation—that case is not barred by res judicata.
3.
Service of process is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant (see rule 4).
1.
In order to get a judgment in a civil action, the plaintiff must serve a copy of the complaint and a summons on the defendant.
2.
There are many ways to do this.
 The process server personally serves a complaint on the defendant.
 The process server leaves a copy of the summons and complaint at the residence of the defendant, in the hands of a competent person.
 The process server sends the summons and complaint by certified mail, return receipt requested.
 The process server, if all other means are not possible, notifies the defendant by publication in a newspaper having a minimum number of readers (as may be specified by law).
4.
In addition to successfully serving the defendant with process, a plaintiff must convince the court that exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant is consistent with due process and any statutes in that state that prescribe the jurisdictional reach of that state (the so-called long- arm statutes).
The Supreme Court has long recognized various bases for judging whether such process is fair.
1.
Consent.
The defendant agrees to the court’s jurisdiction by coming to court, answering the complaint, and having the matter litigated there.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 93  2.
Domicile.
The defendant is a permanent resident of that state.
3.
Event.
The defendant did something in that state, related to the lawsuit, that makes it fair for the state to say, “Come back and defend!” 4.
Service of process within the state will effectively provide personal jurisdiction over the nonresident.
Again, let’s consider Mrs. Robinson and her children in the Audi accident.
She could file a lawsuit anywhere in the country.
She could file a lawsuit in Arizona after she establishes residency there.
But while the Arizona court would have subject matter jurisdiction over any products-liability claim (or any claim that was not required to be heard in a federal court), the Arizona court would face an issue of “in personamjurisdiction,” or personal jurisdiction: under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, each state must extend due process to citizens of all of the other states.
Because fairness is essential to due process, the court must consider whether it is fair to require an out-of-state defendant to appear and defend against a lawsuit that could result in a judgment against that defendant.
Almost every state in the United States has a statute regarding personal jurisdiction, instructing judges when it is permissible to assert personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state resident.
These are called long-arm statutes.
But no state can reach out beyond the limits of what is constitutionally permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, which binds the states with its proviso to guarantee the due process rights of the citizens of every state in the union.
The “minimum contacts” test in Burger King v. Rudzewicz(Section 3.9 "Cases") tries to make the fairness mandate of the due process clause more specific.
So do other tests articulated in the case (such as “does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice”).
These tests are posed by the Supreme Court and heeded by all lower courts in order to honor the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees.
These tests are in addition to any state long-arm statute’s instructions to courts regarding the assertion of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents.
Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses In a series of cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that it will honor contractual choices of parties in a lawsuit.
Suppose the parties to a contract wind up in court arguing over the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 94  application of the contract’s terms.
If the parties are from two different states, the judge may have difficulty determining which law to apply (see Table 3.1 "Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles").
But if the contract says that a particular state’s law will be applied if there is a dispute, then ordinarily the judge will apply that state’s law as a rule of decision in the case.
For example, Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account with Goldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement calls for “any disputes arising under this agreement” to be determined “according to the laws of the state of New York.” When Kumar claims in a Missouri court that his broker is “churning” his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman, Sachs claims that Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney’s fees), the judge in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs.
Ordinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by a choice-of-forum clause.
In a choice- of-forum clause, the parties in the contract specify which court they will go to in the event of a dispute arising under the terms of contract.
For example, Harold (a resident of Virginia) rents a car from Alamo at the Denver International Airport.
He does not look at the fine print on the contract.
He also waives all collision and other insurance that Alamo offers at the time of his rental.
While driving back from Telluride Bluegrass Festival, he has an accident in Idaho Springs, Colorado.
His rented Nissan Altima is badly damaged.
On returning to Virginia, he would like to settle up with Alamo, but his insurance company and Alamo cannot come to terms.
He realizes, however, that he has agreed to hear the dispute with Alamo in a specific court in San Antonio, Texas.
In the absence of fraud or bad faith, any court in the United States is likely to uphold the choice-of-form clause and require Harold (or his insurance company) to litigate in San Antonio, Texas.
KEY TAKEAWAY There are two court systems in the United States.
It is important to know which system—the state court system or the federal court system—has the power to hear and decide a particular case.
Once that is established, the Constitution compels an inquiry to make sure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 95  that no court extends its reach unfairly to out-of-state residents.
The question of personal jurisdiction is a question of fairness and due process to nonresidents.
EXERCISES 1.
The Constitution specifies that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty claims.
Mr. and Mrs. Shute have a claim against Carnival Cruise lines for the negligence of the cruise line.
Mrs. Shute sustained injuries as a result of the company’s negligence.
Mr. and Mrs. Shute live in the state of Washington.
Can they bring their claim in state court?
Must they bring their claim in federal court?
2.
Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In Title VII, employers are required not to discriminate against employees on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin.
In passing Title VII, Congress did not require plaintiffs to file only in federal courts.
That is, Congress made no statement in Title VII that federal courts had “exclusive jurisdiction” over Title VII claims.
Mrs. Harris wishes to sue Forklift Systems, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee, for sexual harassment under Title VII.
She has gone through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission process and has a right-to-sue letter, which is required before a Title VII action can be brought to court.
Can she file a complaint that will be heard by a state court?
3.
Mrs. Harris fails to go to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to get her right-to- sue letter against Forklift Systems, Inc. She therefore does not have a viable Title VII cause of action against Forklift.
She does, however, have her rights under Tennessee’s equal employment statute and various court decisions from Tennessee courts regarding sexual harassment.
Forklift is incorporated in Tennessee and has its principal place of business in Nashville.
Mrs. Harris is also a citizen of Tennessee.
Explain why, if she brings her employment discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit in a federal court, her lawsuit will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
4.
Suppose Mr. and Mrs. Robinson find in the original paperwork with Seaway Volkswagen that there is a contractual agreement with a provision that says “all disputes arising between buyer and Seaway Volkswagen will be litigated, if at all, in the county courts of Westchester Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 96  County, New York.” Will the Oklahoma court take personal jurisdiction over Seaway Volkswagen, or will it require the Robinsons to litigate their claim in New York?
3.3 Motions and Discovery LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial.
2.
Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial.
The early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex process of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery.
A lawsuit will start with the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the defendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim).
After the pleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge.
Motions in the early stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to compel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process.
Initial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss The first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings.
These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then (usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant.
The answer may be coupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff.
(In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the claims she has against the original plaintiff.)
The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant.
State and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s claim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of money, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights).
In an answer, the defendant will often deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others.
A complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail.
Cases can be decided on the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the court can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks.
(2) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 97  The defendant can move to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be granted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, or on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
The defendant is saying, in effect, that even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by the court.
For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-called alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will dismiss the complaint without any further proceedings.
(This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a demurrer.)
A third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment.
If there is no triable question of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial.
For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory note and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment on the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay.
There is no reason to have a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment.
Discovery If there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some degree of discovery, where each party tries to get as much information out of the other party as the rules allow.
Until the 1940s, when discovery became part of civil procedure rules, a lawsuit was frequently a game in which each party hid as much information as possible and tried to surprise the other party in court.
Beginning with a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in 1938 and subsequently followed by many of the states, the parties are entitled to learn the facts of the case before trial.
The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential witnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant.
Discovery can proceed by several methods.
A party may serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions.
Or a party may depose the other party or a witness.
A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which the witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers.
His answers are recorded verbatim and may be used at trial.
Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and other physical items in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 98  possession of the other.
This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just evidence that is admissible at trial.
Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a company’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and quality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document.
The lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process.
For example, one party simply makes a written demand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to inspect and make copies of.
A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, written interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often brought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from irrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests.
For example, the party receiving the discovery request can apply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a party’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent.
In complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages and can take years.
Depositions can consume days or even weeks of an executive’s time.
KEY TAKEAWAY Many cases never get to trial.
They are disposed of by motions to dismiss or are settled after extensive discovery makes clear to the parties the strengths and weaknesses of the parties to the dispute.
EXERCISES 1.
Mrs. Robinson (in the Volkswagen Audi case) never establishes residency in Arizona, returns to New York, and files her case in federal district court in New York, alleging diversity jurisdiction.
Assume that the defendants do not want to have the case heard in federal court.
What motion will they make?
2.
Under contributory negligence, the negligence of any plaintiff that causes or contributes to the injuries a plaintiff complains of will be grounds for dismissal.
Suppose that in discovery, Mr. Ferlito in Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 "Cases") admits that he brought the cigarette lighter dangerously close to his costume, saying, “Yes, you could definitely say I was being careless; I had a few drinks under my belt.” Also, Mrs. Ferlito admits that she never reads product instructions from manufacturers.
If the case is brought in a state where Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 99  contributory negligence is the law, on what basis can Johnson & Johnson have the case dismissed before trial?
3.4 The Pretrial and Trial Phase LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how judges can push parties into pretrial settlement.
2.
Explain the meaning and use of directed verdicts.
3.
Distinguish a directed verdict from a judgment n.o.v.
(“notwithstanding the verdict”).
After considerable discovery, one of the parties may believe that there is no triable issue of law or fact for the court to consider and may file a motion with the court for summary judgment.
Unless it is very clear, the judge will deny a summary judgment motion, because that ends the case at the trial level; it is a “final order” in the case that tells the plaintiff “no” and leaves no room to bring another lawsuit against the defendant for that particular set of facts (res judicata).
If the plaintiff successfully appeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court.
Prior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of settlement.
Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the attorneys.
The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to trial.
Pretrial Conference At various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the court may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable.
The court may also hold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether.
Once discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled.
Most cases are settled before this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of criminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea.
Trial At trial, the first order of business is to select a jury.
(In a civil case of any consequence, either party can request one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.)
The judge and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 100  sometimes the lawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased.
This questioning is known as the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER).
This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes into selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases.
A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as many as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue.
In a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two alternate jurors.
In both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.
For example, in the Robinsons’ case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi will want to know if any prospective jurors have ever owned an Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar problem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to their satisfaction.
If so, the defense attorney could well believe that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client.
In that case, she could use a challenge for cause, explaining to the judge the basis for her challenge.
The judge, at her discretion, could either accept the for-cause reason or reject it.
Even if an attorney cannot articulate a for-cause reason acceptable to the judge, he may use one of several peremptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow.
A trial attorney with many years of experience may have a sixth sense about a potential juror and, in consultation with the client, may decide to use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that juror on the panel.
After the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff’s lawyer makes an opening statement, laying out the nature of the plaintiff’s claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them, and the evidence that the lawyer will present.
The defendant’s lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his right to do so at the end of the plaintiff’s case.
The plaintiff’s lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the physical evidence that is relevant to her proof.
The direct testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration.
The rules of evidence (that govern the kinds of testimony and documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-and-answer format tend to make the presentation of evidence choppy and difficult to follow.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 101  Anyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a television melodrama featuring a trial scene will appreciate the nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a number of issues that may or may not be related, the opposing lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in which it is asked, and the jury may be sent from the room while the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge.
After direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing lawyer may conduct cross- examination.
This is a crucial constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment (the right to confront one’s accusers in open court).
The formal rules of direct testimony are then relaxed, and the cross-examiner may probe the witness more informally, asking questions that may not seem immediately relevant.
This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s credibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted.
This use of cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at all relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of authoritarian regimes around the world.
Following cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called redirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to show that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted.
The cross-examiner may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on.
The process usually stops after cross-examination or redirect.
During the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides.
One big piece of that responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence.
A judge may rule that a particular question is out of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant.
Where the attorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part thereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in which case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of exceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order a retrial.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 102  For the most part, courts of appeal will not reverse and remand for a new trial unless the trial court judge’s errors are “prejudicial,” or “an abuse of discretion.” In short, neither party is entitled to a perfect trial, but only to a fair trial, one in which the trial judge has made only “harmless errors” and not prejudicial ones.
At the end of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant presents his case, following the same procedure just outlined.
The plaintiff is then entitled to present rebuttal witnesses, if necessary, to deny or argue with the evidence the defendant has introduced.
The defendant in turn may present “surrebuttal” witnesses.
When all testimony has been introduced, either party may ask the judge for adirected verdict—a verdict decided by the judge without advice from the jury.
This motion may be granted if the plaintiff has failed to introduce evidence that is legally sufficient to meet her burden of proof or if the defendant has failed to do the same on issues on which she has the burden of proof.
(For example, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant owes him money and introduces a signed promissory note.
The defendant cannot show that the note is invalid.
The defendant must lose the case unless he can show that the debt has been paid or otherwise discharged.)
The defendant can move for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s case, but the judge will usually wait to hear the entire case until deciding whether to do so.
Directed verdicts are not usually granted, since it is the jury’s job to determine the facts in dispute.
If the judge refuses to grant a directed verdict, each lawyer will then present a closing argument to the jury (or, if there is no jury, to the judge alone).
The closing argument is used to tie up the loose ends, as the attorney tries to bring together various seemingly unrelated facts into a story that will make sense to the jury.
After closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury.
The purpose of jury instruction is to explain to the jurors the meaning of the law as it relates to the issues they are considering and to tell the jurors what facts they must determine if they are to give a verdict for one party or the other.
Each lawyer will have prepared a set of written instructions that she hopes the judge will give to the jury.
These will be tailored to advance her client’s case.
Many a verdict has been overturned on appeal because a trial judge has wrongly instructed the jury.
The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will use a set of pattern instructions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 103  provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state.
These pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate courts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions.
After all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers requested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict.
Some minor cases do not require a unanimous verdict.
If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case will have to be retried.
When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their lawyers present.
The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge.
(If there is no jury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to those facts.
Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.)
Posttrial Motions The losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto).
A judge who decides that a directed verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is.
If it is favorable to the party the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that verdict.
If the verdict is for the other party, he can grant the motion for judgment n.o.v.
This is a safer way to proceed because if the judge is reversed on appeal, a new trial is not necessary.
The jury’s verdict always can be restored, whereas without a jury verdict (as happens when a directed verdict is granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case must be presented to a new jury.Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 "Cases") illustrates the judgment n.o.v.
process in a case where the judge allowed the case to go to a jury that was overly sympathetic to the plaintiffs.
Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the authorization for federal judges making a judgment contrary to the judgment of the jury.
Most states have a similar rule.
Rule 50(b) says, Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion.
Not later than 10 days after entry of judgment, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 104  and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the party’s motion for a directed verdict.…[A] new trial may be prayed for in the alternative.
If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.
KEY TAKEAWAY The purpose of a trial judge is to ensure justice to all parties to the lawsuit.
The judge presides, instructs the jury, and may limit who testifies and what they testify about what.
In all of this, the judge will usually commit some errors; occasionally these will be the kinds of errors that seriously compromise a fair trial for both parties.
Errors that do seriously compromise a fair trial for both parties are prejudicial, as opposed to harmless.
The appeals court must decide whether any errors of the trial court judge are prejudicial or not.
If a judge directs a verdict, that ends the case for the party who hasn’t asked for one; if a judge grants judgment n.o.v., that will take away a jury verdict that one side has worked very hard to get.
Thus a judge must be careful not to unduly favor one side or the other, regardless of his or her sympathies.
EXERCISES 1.
What if there was not a doctrine of res judicata?
What would the legal system be like?
2.
Why do you think cross-examination is a “right,” as opposed to a “good thing”?
What kind of judicial system would not allow cross-examination of witnesses as a matter of right?
3.5 Judgment, Appeal, and Execution LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the posttrial process—how appellate courts process appeals.
2.
Explain how a court’s judgment is translated into relief for the winning party.
Judgment or Order At the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) and conclusions of law.
The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief or remedy should be given.
Often it is an award of money damages to one of the parties.
The losing Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 105  party may ask for a new trial at this point or within a short period of time following.
Once the trial judge denies any such request, the judgment—in the form of the court’s order—is final.
Appeal If the loser’s motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v.
is denied, the losing party may appeal but must ordinarily post a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the amount awarded to the winning party.
In an appeal, the appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error committed by the trial judge.
There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless).
The basic idea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides.
Enforcement of the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the appellate court has ruled.
As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the party defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent).
During the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge.
In compiling a record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate court some examples of mistakes made by the judge—for example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed to admit proper evidence that should have been admitted, or having wrongly instructed the jury.
The appellate court must determine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to prejudicial error.
Appellate and trial procedures are different.
The appellate court does not hear witnesses or accept evidence.
It reviews the record of the case—the transcript of the witnesses’ testimony and the documents received into evidence at trial—to try to find a legal error on a specific request of one or both of the parties.
The parties’ lawyers prepare briefs (written statements containing the facts in the case), the procedural steps taken, and the argument or discussion of the meaning of the law and how it applies to the facts.
After reading the briefs on appeal, the appellate court may dispose of the appeal without argument, issuing a written opinion that may be very short or many pages.
Often, though, the appellate court will hear oral argument.
(This can be months, or even more than a year after the briefs are filed.)
Each lawyer is given a short period of time, usually no more than thirty minutes, to present his client’s case.
The lawyer rarely gets a chance for an extended statement because he is usually interrupted by questions from the judges.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 106  Through this exchange between judges and lawyers, specific legal positions can be tested and their limits explored.
Depending on what it decides, the appellate court will affirm the lower court’s judgment, modify it, reverse it, or remand it to the lower court for retrial or other action directed by the higher court.
The appellate court itself does not take specific action in the case; it sits only to rule on contested issues of law.
The lower court must issue the final judgment in the case.
As we have already seen, there is the possibility of appealing from an intermediate appellate court to the state supreme court in twenty-nine states and to the US Supreme Court from a ruling from a federal circuit court of appeal.
In cases raising constitutional issues, there is also the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Court from the state courts.
Like trial judges, appellate judges must follow previous decisions, or precedent.
But not every previous case is a precedent for every court.
Lower courts must respect appellate court decisions, and courts in one state are not bound by decisions of courts in other states.
State courts are not bound by decisions of federal courts, except on points of federal law that come from federal courts within the state or from a federal circuit in which the state court sits.
A state supreme court is not bound by case law in any other state.
But a supreme court in one state with a type of case it has not previously dealt with may find persuasive reasoning in decisions of other state supreme courts.
Federal district courts are bound by the decisions of the court of appeals in their circuit, but decisions by one circuit court are not precedents for courts in other circuits.
Federal courts are also bound by decisions of the state supreme courts within their geographic territory in diversity jurisdiction cases.
All courts are bound by decisions of the US Supreme Court, except the Supreme Court itself, which seldom reverses itself but on occasion has overturned its own precedents.
Not everything a court says in an opinion is a precedent.
Strictly speaking, only the exact holding is binding on the lower courts.
A holding is the theory of the law that applies to the particular circumstances presented in a case.
The courts may sometimes declare what they believe to be the law with regard to points that are not central to the case being decided.
These declarations Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 107  are called dicta (the singular, dictum), and the lower courts do not have to give them the same weight as holdings.
Judgment and Order When a party has no more possible appeals, it usually pays up voluntarily.
If not voluntarily, then the losing party’s assets can be seized or its wages or other income garnished to satisfy the judgment.
If the final judgment is an injunction, failure to follow its dictates can lead to a contempt citation, with a fine or jail time imposed.
KEY TAKEAWAY The process of conducting a civil trial has many aspects, starting with pleadings and continuing with motions, discovery, more motions, pretrial conferences, and finally the trial itself.
At all stages, the rules of civil procedure attempt to give both sides plenty of notice, opportunity to be heard, discovery of relevant information, cross-examination, and the preservation of procedural objections for purposes of appeal.
All of these rules and procedures are intended to provide each side with a fair trial.
EXERCISES 1.
Mrs. Robinson has a key witness on auto safety that the judge believes is not qualified as an expert.
The judge examines the witness while the jury is in the jury room and disqualifies him from testifying.
The jury does not get to hear this witness.
Her attorney objects.
She loses her case.
What argument would you expect Mrs. Robinson’s attorney to make in an appeal?
2.
Why don’t appellate courts need a witness box for witnesses to give testimony under oath?
3.
A trial judge in Nevada is wondering whether to enforce a surrogate motherhood contract.
Penelope Barr, of Reno, Nevada, has contracted with Reuben and Tina Goldberg to bear the in vitro fertilized egg of Mrs. Goldberg.
After carrying the child for nine months, Penelope gives birth, but she is reluctant to give up the child, even though she was paid $20,000 at the start of the contract and will earn an additional $20,000 on handing over the baby to the Goldbergs.
(Barr was an especially good candidate for surrogate motherhood: she had borne two perfect children and at age 28 drinks no wine, does not smoke or use drugs of any kind, practices yoga, and maintains a largely vegetarian diet with just enough meat to meet the needs of the fetus within.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 108  The Goldbergs have asked the judge for an order compelling Penelope to give up the baby, who was five days old when the lawsuit was filed.
The baby is now a month old as the judge looks in vain for guidance from any Nevada statute, federal statute, or any prior case in Nevada that addressed the issue of surrogate motherhood.
He does find several well-reasoned cases, one from New Jersey, one from Michigan, and one from Oregon.
Are any of these “precedent” that he must follow?
May he adopt the reasoning of any of these courts, if he should find that reasoning persuasive?
3.6 When Can Someone Bring a Lawsuit?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts.
2.
Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case.
Almost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney.
But the court may not hear it, for a number of reasons.
There may be no case or controversy, there may be no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have lapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing.
Case or Controversy: Standing to Sue Article III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power.
For some cases, the Supreme Court has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For example, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court.
In such a case, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue.
For example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, destroying her beloved roses.
You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years.
She is forlorn and tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore.
She also tells you that she has decided not to sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 109  at all possible.
Incensed, you decide to sue on her behalf.
But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not directly injured by the moving van.
Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly affected has the legal right to sue.
The standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly complicated matter.
For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional?
What particular injury have they (or the states) suffered?
Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?
Time—and the Supreme Court—will tell.
Class Actions Most lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other organization.
But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time.
A driver who runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people.
If several people are injured in the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them.
Could they sue as a group?
Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, and different facts would have to be proved at the trial.
Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might have been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability toward the passengers.
If, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a single lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial responsibility than many individual lawsuits.
How could such a suit be brought?
All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could present a common case.
But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become overwhelmingly complicated.
So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by a corporation ever get together to sue?
Because of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of people to serve as representatives for all others.
This is the class action.
The class action is provided for in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states.
These rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in an appropriate case, subject to approval of the court.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 110  Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally adequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for the entire class.
Usually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave.
If she does, she will not be included in an eventual judgment or settlement.
But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class cannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the outcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding.
KEY TAKEAWAY Anyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has standing will be heard by the courts.
Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to ensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries.
Class actions are a way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances.
EXERCISE 1.
Fuchs Funeral Home is carrying the body of Charles Emmenthaler to its resting place at Forest Lawn Cemetery.
Charles’s wife, Chloe, and their two children, Chucky and Clarice, are following the hearse when the coffin falls on the street, opens, and the body of Charles Emmenthaler falls out.
The wife and children are shocked and aggrieved and later sue in civil court for damages.
Assume that this is a viable cause of action based on “negligent infliction of emotional distress” in the state of California and that Charles’s brother, sister-in-law, and multiple cousins also were in the funeral procession and saw what happened.
The brother of Charles, Kingston Emmenthaler, also sees his brother’s body on the street, but his wife, their three children, and some of Charles’s other cousins do not.
Charles was actually emotionally closest to Kingston’s oldest son, Nestor, who was studying abroad at the time of the funeral and could not make it back in time.
He is as emotionally distraught at his uncle’s passing as anyone else in the family and is especially grieved over the description of the incident and the grainy video shot by one of the cousins on his cell phone.
Who has standing to sue Fuchs Funeral Home, and who does not?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 111  3.7 Relations with Lawyers LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the various ways that lawyers charge for services.
2.
Describe the contingent fee system in the United States.
3.
Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ fees.
Legal Fees Lawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee.
A flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance approximately how long it will take her to do the job.
Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are examples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate.
The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the worth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price.
Lawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial matters.
Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range from $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time.
A contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the success of the case.
This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., automobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice).
Although used quite often, the contingent fee is controversial.
Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such lawsuits.
A typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand dollars to prepare, and a complicated products-liability case can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Few people have that kind of money or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit.
Corporate and professional defendants complain that the contingent fee gives lawyers a license to go big game hunting, or to file suits against those with deep pockets in the hopes of forcing them to settle.
Trial lawyers respond that the contingent fee arrangement forces them to screen cases and weed out cases that are weak, because it is not worth their time to spend the hundreds of hours necessary on such cases if their chances of winning are slim or nonexistent.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 112  Costs In England and in many other countries, the losing party must pay the legal expenses of the winning party, including attorneys’ fees.
That is not the general rule in this country.
Here, each party must pay most of its own costs, including (and especially) the fees of lawyers.
(Certain relatively minor costs, such as filing fees for various documents required in court, are chargeable to the losing side, if the judge decides it.)
This type of fee structure is known as the American rule (in contrast to the British rule).
There are two types of exceptions to the American rule.
By statute, Congress and the state legislatures have provided that the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover its full legal costs from the loser—for example, the federal antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access to Justice Act.
The other exception applies to litigants who either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation of winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause the plaintiff great expense.
Under these circumstances, a court has the discretion to award attorneys’ fees to the winner.
But this rule is not infinitely flexible, and courts do not have complete freedom to award attorneys’ fees in any amount, but only "reasonable" attorney's fees.
KEY TAKEAWAY Litigation is expensive.
Getting a lawyer can be costly, unless you get a lawyer on a contingent fee.
Not all legal systems allow contingent fees.
In many legal systems, the loser pays attorneys’ fees for both parties.
EXERCISES 1.
Mrs. Robinson’s attorney estimates that they will recover a million dollars from Volkswagen in the Audi lawsuit.
She has Mrs. Robinson sign a contract that gives her firm one-third of any recovery after the firm’s expenses are deducted.
The judge does in fact award a million dollars, and the defendant pays.
The firm’s expenses are $100,000.
How much does Mrs. Robinson get?
2.
Harry Potter brings a lawsuit against Draco Malfoy in Chestershire, England, for slander, a form of defamation.
Potter alleges that Malfoy insists on calling him a mudblood.
Ron Weasley testifies, as does Neville Chamberlain.
But Harry loses, because the court has no conception of wizardry and cannot make sense of the case at all.
In dismissing the case, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 113  however, who (under English law) will bear the costs of the attorneys who have brought the case for Potter and defended the matter for Malfoy?
3.8 Alternative Means of Resolving Disputes LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how arbitration and mediation are frequently used alternatives to litigation.
2.
Describe the differences between arbitration and mediation.
3.
Explain why arbitration is final and binding.
Disputes do not have to be settled in court.
No law requires parties who have a legal dispute to seek judicial resolution if they can resolve their disagreement privately or through some other public forum.
In fact, the threat of a lawsuit can frequently motivate parties toward private negotiation.
Filing a lawsuit may convince one party that the other party is serious.
Or the parties may decide that they will come to terms privately rather than wait the three or four years it can frequently take for a case to move up on the court calendar.
Arbitration Beginning around 1980, a movement toward alternative dispute resolution began to gain force throughout the United States.
Bar associations, other private groups, and the courts themselves wanted to find quicker and cheaper ways for litigants and potential litigants to settle certain types of quarrels than through the courts.
As a result, neighborhood justice centers or dispute resolution centers have sprung up in communities.
These are where people can come for help in settling disputes, of both civil and criminal nature, that should not consume the time and money of the parties or courts in lengthy proceedings.
These alternative forums use a variety of methods, including arbitration, mediation, and conciliation, to bring about agreement or at least closure of the dispute.
These methods are not all alike, and their differences are worth noting.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 114  Arbitration is a type of adjudication.
The parties use a private decision maker, the arbitrator, and the rules of procedure are considerably more relaxed than those that apply in the courtroom.
Arbitrators might be retired judges, lawyers, or anyone with the kind of specialized knowledge and training that would be useful in making a final, binding decision on the dispute.
In a contractual relationship, the parties can decide even before a dispute arises to use arbitration when the time comes.
Or parties can decide after a dispute arises to use arbitration instead of litigation.
In a predispute arbitration agreement (often part of a larger contract), the parties can spell out the rules of procedure to be used and the method for choosing the arbitrator.
For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility of choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may jointly pick a third arbitrator.
Many arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private organization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities.
The association uses published sets of rules for various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or commercial arbitration); parties who provide in contracts for arbitration through the association are agreeing to be bound by the association’s rules.
Similarly, the National Association of Securities Dealers provides arbitration services for disputes between clients and brokerage firms.
International commercial arbitration often takes place through the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce.
A multilateral agreement known as the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards provides that agreements to arbitrate—and arbitral awards—will be enforced across national boundaries.
Arbitration has two advantages over litigation.
First, it is usually much quicker, because the arbitrator does not have a backlog of cases and because the procedures are simpler.
Second, in complex cases, the quality of the decision may be higher, because the parties can select an arbitrator with specialized knowledge.
Under both federal and state law, arbitration is favored, and a decision rendered by an arbitrator is binding by law and may be enforced by the courts.
The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding, with very few exceptions (such as fraud or manifest disregard of the law by the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators).
Saying that arbitration is favored means that if you have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 115  agreed to arbitration, you can’t go to court if the other party wants you to arbitrate.
Under the Federal Arbitration Act, the other party can go to court and get a stay against your litigation and also get an order compelling you to go to arbitration.
Mediation Unlike adjudication, mediation gives the neutral party no power to impose a decision.
The mediator is a go-between who attempts to help the parties negotiate a solution.
The mediator will communicate the parties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes.
But the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, settle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the whole thing!
KEY TAKEAWAY Litigation is not the only way to resolve disputes.
Informal negotiation between the disputants usually comes first, but both mediation and arbitration are available.
Arbitration, though, is final and binding.
Once you agree to arbitrate, you will have a final, binding arbitral award that is enforceable through the courts, and courts will almost never allow you to litigate after you have agreed to arbitrate.
EXERCISES 1.
When Mrs. Robinson buys her Audi from Seaway, there is a paragraph in the bill of sale, which both the dealer and Mrs. Robinson sign, that says, “In the event of any complaint by customer/buyer against Seaway regarding the vehicle purchased herein, such complaint shall not be litigated, but may only be arbitrated under the rules of the American Arbitration Association and in accordance with New York law.” Mrs. Robinson did not see the provision, doesn’t like it, and wants to bring a lawsuit in Oklahoma against Seaway.
What result?
2.
Hendrik Koster (Netherlands) contracts with Automark, Inc. (a US company based in Illinois) to supply Automark with a large quantity of valve cap gauges.
He does, and Automark fails to pay.
Koster thinks he is owed $66,000.
There is no agreement to arbitrate or mediate.
Can Koster make Automark mediate or arbitrate?
3.
Suppose that there is an agreement between Koster and Automark to arbitrate.
It says, “The parties agree to arbitrate any dispute arising under this agreement in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands and under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce’s Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 116  arbitration facility.” The International Chamber of Commerce has arbitration rules and will appoint an arbitrator or arbitral panel in the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator.
The arbitration takes place in Geneva.
Koster gets an arbitral award for $66,000 plus interest.
Automark does not participate in any way.
Will a court in Illinois enforce the arbitral award?
3.9 Cases Burger King v. Rudzewicz Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz 471 U.S. 462 (U.S. Supreme Court 1985) Summary Burger King Corp. is a Florida corporation with principal offices in Miami.
It principally conducts restaurant business through franchisees.
The franchisees are licensed to use Burger King’s trademarks and service marks in standardized restaurant facilities.
Rudzewicz is a Michigan resident who, with a partner (MacShara) operated a Burger King franchise in Drayton Plains, Michigan.
Negotiations for setting up the franchise occurred in 1978 largely between Rudzewicz, his partner, and a regional office of Burger King in Birmingham, Michigan, although some deals and concessions were made by Burger King in Florida.
A preliminary agreement was signed in February of 1979.
Rudzewicz and MacShara assumed operation of an existing facility in Drayton Plains and MacShara attended prescribed management courses in Miami during the four months following Feb. 1979.
Rudzewicz and MacShara bought $165,000 worth of restaurant equipment from Burger King’s Davmor Industries division in Miami.
But before the final agreements were signed, the parties began to disagree over site-development fees, building design, computation of monthly rent, and whether Rudzewicz and MacShara could assign their liabilities to a corporation they had formed.
Negotiations took place between Rudzewicz, MacShara, and the Birmingham regional office; but Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that the regional office had limited decision- making power and turned directly to Miami headquarters for their concerns.
The final agreement was signed by June 1979 and provided that the franchise relationship was governed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 117  by Florida law, and called for payment of all required fees and forwarding of all relevant notices to Miami headquarters.
The Drayton Plains restaurant did fairly well at first, but a recession in late 1979 caused the franchisees to fall far behind in their monthly payments to Miami.
Notice of default was sent from Miami to Rudzewicz, who nevertheless continued to operate the restaurant as a Burger King franchise.
Burger King sued in federal district court for the southern district of Florida.
Rudzewicz contested the court’s personal jurisdiction over him, since he had never been to Florida.
The federal court looked to Florida’s long arm statute and held that it did have personal jurisdiction over the non-resident franchisees, and awarded Burger King a quarter of a million dollars in contract damages and enjoined the franchisees from further operation of the Drayton Plains facility.
Franchisees appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and won a reversal based on lack of personal jurisdiction.
Burger King petitioned the Supreme Ct. for a writ of certiorari.
Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court.
The Due Process Clause protects an individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful “contacts, ties, or relations.” International Shoe Co. v. Washington.
By requiring that individuals have “fair warning that a particular activity may subject [them] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,” the Due Process Clause “gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.”… Where a forum seeks to assert specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has not consented to suit there, this “fair warning” requirement is satisfied if the defendant has “purposefully directed” his activities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that “arise out of or relate to” those activities, Thus “[t]he forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State” and those products subsequently injure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 118  forum consumers.
Similarly, a publisher who distributes magazines in a distant State may fairly be held accountable in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly defamatory story.… …[T]he constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully established “minimum contacts” in the forum State.…In defining when it is that a potential defendant should “reasonably anticipate” out-of-state litigation, the Court frequently has drawn from the reasoning of Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958): The unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.
The application of that rule will vary with the quality and nature of the defendant’s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.
This “purposeful availment” requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of “random,” “fortuitous,” or “attenuated” contacts, or of the “unilateral activity of another party or a third person,” [Citations] Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a “substantial connection” with the forum State.
[Citations] Thus where the defendant “deliberately” has engaged in significant activities within a State, or has created “continuing obligations” between himself and residents of the forum, he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by “the benefits and protections” of the forum’s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.
Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically enter the forum State.
Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted.
So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents of another State, we have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 119  consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.
Once it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S., at 320.
Thus courts in “appropriate case[s]” may evaluate “the burden on the defendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.” These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required.
[Citations] Applying these principles to the case at hand, we believe there is substantial record evidence supporting the District Court’s conclusion that the assertion of personal jurisdiction over Rudzewicz in Florida for the alleged breach of his franchise agreement did not offend due process.… In this case, no physical ties to Florida can be attributed to Rudzewicz other than MacShara’s brief training course in Miami.
Rudzewicz did not maintain offices in Florida and, for all that appears from the record, has never even visited there.
Yet this franchise dispute grew directly out of “a contract which had a substantial connection with that State.” Eschewing the option of operating an independent local enterprise, Rudzewicz deliberately “reach[ed] out beyond” Michigan and negotiated with a Florida corporation for the purchase of a long-term franchise and the manifold benefits that would derive from affiliation with a nationwide organization.
Upon approval, he entered into a carefully structured 20-year relationship that envisioned continuing and wide-reaching contacts with Burger King in Florida.
In light of Rudzewicz’ voluntary acceptance of the long-term and exacting regulation of his business from Burger King’s Miami headquarters, the “quality and nature” of his relationship to the company in Florida can in no sense be viewed as “random,” “fortuitous,” or “attenuated.” Rudzewicz’ refusal to make the contractually required payments in Miami, and his continued use of Burger King’s trademarks and confidential business information after his termination, caused foreseeable Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 120  injuries to the corporation in Florida.
For these reasons it was, at the very least, presumptively reasonable for Rudzewicz to be called to account there for such injuries.
…Because Rudzewicz established a substantial and continuing relationship with Burger King’s Miami headquarters, received fair notice from the contract documents and the course of dealing that he might be subject to suit in Florida, and has failed to demonstrate how jurisdiction in that forum would otherwise be fundamentally unfair, we conclude that the District Court’s exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to Fla. Stat.
48.193(1)(g) (Supp.
1984) did not offend due process.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Why did Burger King sue in Florida rather than in Michigan?
2.
If Florida has a long-arm statute that tells Florida courts that it may exercise personal jurisdiction over someone like Rudzewicz, why is the court talking about the due process clause?
3.
Why is this case in federal court rather than in a Florida state court?
4.
If this case had been filed in state court in Florida, would Rudzewicz be required to come to Florida?
Explain.
Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson Products, Inc. 771 F. Supp.
196 (U.S. District Ct., Eastern District of Michigan 1991) Gadola, J.
Plaintiffs Susan and Frank Ferlito, husband and wife, attended a Halloween party in 1984 dressed as Mary (Mrs. Ferlito) and her little lamb (Mr. Ferlito).
Mrs. Ferlito had constructed a lamb costume for her husband by gluing cotton batting manufactured by defendant Johnson & Johnson Products (“JJP”) to a suit of long underwear.
She had also used defendant’s product to fashion a headpiece, complete with ears.
The costume covered Mr. Ferlito from his head to his ankles, except for his face and hands, which were blackened with Halloween paint.
At the party Mr. Ferlito attempted to light his cigarette by using a butane lighter.
The flame passed close to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 121  his left arm, and the cotton batting on his left sleeve ignited.
Plaintiffs sued defendant for injuries they suffered from burns which covered approximately one-third of Mr. Ferlito’s body.
Following a jury verdict entered for plaintiffs November 2, 1989, the Honorable Ralph M. Freeman entered a judgment for plaintiff Frank Ferlito in the amount of $555,000 and for plaintiff Susan Ferlito in the amount of $ 70,000.
Judgment was entered November 7, 1989.
Subsequently, on November 16, 1989, defendant JJP filed a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.
50(b) or, in the alternative, for new trial.
Plaintiffs filed their response to defendant’s motion December 18, 1989; and defendant filed a reply January 4, 1990.
Before reaching a decision on this motion, Judge Freeman died.
The case was reassigned to this court April 12, 1990.
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT Defendant JJP filed two motions for a directed verdict, the first on October 27, 1989, at the close of plaintiffs’ proofs, and the second on October 30, 1989, at the close of defendant’s proofs.
Judge Freeman denied both motions without prejudice.
Judgment for plaintiffs was entered November 7, 1989; and defendant’s instant motion, filed November 16, 1989, was filed in a timely manner.
The standard for determining whether to grant a j.n.o.v.
is identical to the standard for evaluating a motion for directed verdict: In determining whether the evidence is sufficient, the trial court may neither weigh the evidence, pass on the credibility of witnesses nor substitute its judgment for that of the jury.
Rather, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made, drawing from that evidence all reasonable inferences in his favor.
If after reviewing the evidence…the trial court is of the opinion that reasonable minds could not come to the result reached by the jury, then the motion for j.n.o.v.
should be granted.
To recover in a “failure to warn” product liability action, a plaintiff must prove each of the following four elements of negligence: (1) that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, (2) that the defendant violated that duty, (3) that the defendant’s breach of that duty was a proximate cause of the damages suffered by the plaintiff, and (4) that the plaintiff suffered damages.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 122  To establish a prima facie case that a manufacturer’s breach of its duty to warn was a proximate cause of an injury sustained, a plaintiff must present evidence that the product would have been used differently had the proffered warnings been given.
[1][Citations omitted] In the absence of evidence that a warning would have prevented the harm complained of by altering the plaintiff’s conduct, the failure to warn cannot be deemed a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury as a matter of law.
[In accordance with procedure in a diversity of citizenship case, such as this one, the court cites Michigan case law as the basis for its legal interpretation.]
… A manufacturer has a duty “to warn the purchasers or users of its product about dangers associated with intended use.” Conversely, a manufacturer has no duty to warn of a danger arising from an unforeseeable misuse of its product.
[Citation] Thus, whether a manufacturer has a duty to warn depends on whether the use of the product and the injury sustained by it are foreseeable.
Gootee v. Colt Industries Inc., 712 F.2d 1057, 1065 (6th Cir.
1983); Owens v. Allis- Chalmers Corp., 414 Mich. 413, 425, 326 N.W.2d 372 (1982).
Whether a plaintiff’s use of a product is foreseeable is a legal question to be resolved by the court.
Trotter, supra.
Whether the resulting injury is foreseeable is a question of fact for the jury.
[2] Thomas v. International Harvester Co., 57 Mich. App.
79, 225 N.W.2d 175 (1974).
In the instant action no reasonable jury could find that JJP’s failure to warn of the flammability of cotton batting was a proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries because plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence to establish that a flammability warning on JJP’s cotton batting would have dissuaded them from using the product in the manner that they did.
Plaintiffs repeatedly stated in their response brief that plaintiff Susan Ferlito testified that “she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume…However, a review of the trial transcript reveals that plaintiff Susan Ferlito never testified that she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume.
More importantly, the transcript contains no statement by plaintiff Susan Ferlito that a flammability warning on defendant JJP’s product would have dissuaded her from using the cotton batting to construct the costume in the first place.
At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs conceded that there was no testimony during the trial that either plaintiff Susan Ferlito or her husband, plaintiff Frank J. Ferlito, would have acted any different Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 123  if there had been a flammability warning on the product’s package.
The absence of such testimony is fatal to plaintiffs’ case; for without it, plaintiffs have failed to prove proximate cause, one of the essential elements of their negligence claim.
In addition, both plaintiffs testified that they knew that cotton batting burns when it is exposed to flame.
Susan Ferlito testified that she knew at the time she purchased the cotton batting that it would burn if exposed to an open flame.
Frank Ferlito testified that he knew at the time he appeared at the Halloween party that cotton batting would burn if exposed to an open flame.
His additional testimony that he would not have intentionally put a flame to the cotton batting shows that he recognized the risk of injury of which he claims JJP should have warned.
Because both plaintiffs were already aware of the danger, a warning by JJP would have been superfluous.
Therefore, a reasonable jury could not have found that JJP’s failure to provide a warning was a proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries.
The evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that neither the use to which plaintiffs put JJP’s product nor the injuries arising from that use were foreseeable.
Susan Ferlito testified that the idea for the costume was hers alone.
As described on the product’s package, its intended uses are for cleansing, applying medications, and infant care.
Plaintiffs’ showing that the product may be used on occasion in classrooms for decorative purposes failed to demonstrate the foreseeability of an adult male encapsulating himself from head to toe in cotton batting and then lighting up a cigarette.
ORDER NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendant JJP’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the judgment entered November 2, 1989, is SET ASIDE.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk will enter a judgment in favor of the defendant JJP.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
The opinion focuses on proximate cause.
As we will see in Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law", a negligence case cannot be won unless the plaintiff shows that the defendant has breached a duty and that the defendant’s breach has actually and proximately caused the damage complained of.
What, exactly, is the alleged breach of duty by the defendant here?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 124  2.
Explain why Judge Gadola reasoning that JJP had no duty to warn in this case.
After this case, would they then have a duty to warn, knowing that someone might use their product in this way?
[1] By “prima facie case,” the court means a case in which the plaintiff has presented all the basic elements of the cause of action alleged in the complaint.
If one or more elements of proof are missing, then the plaintiff has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case, and the case should be dismissed (usually on the basis of a directed verdict).
[2] Note the division of labor here: questions of law are for the judge, while questions of “fact” are for the jury.
Here, “foreseeability” is a fact question, while the judge retains authority over questions of law.
The division between questions of fact and questions of law is not an easy one, however.
Chapter 4 Constitutional Law and US Commerce LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Explain the historical importance and basic structure of the US Constitution.
2.
Know what judicial review is and what it represents in terms of the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
3.
Locate the source of congressional power to regulate the economy under the Constitution, and explain what limitations there are to the reach of congressional power over interstate commerce.
4.
Describe the different phases of congressional power over commerce, as adjudged by the US Supreme Court over time.
5.
Explain what power the states retain over commerce, and how the Supreme Court may sometimes limit that power.
6.
Describe how the Supreme Court, under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, balances state and federal laws that may be wholly or partly in conflict.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 125  7.
Explain how the Bill of Rights relates to business activities in the United States.
The US Constitution is the foundation for all of US law.
Business and commerce are directly affected by the words, meanings, and interpretations of the Constitution.
Because it speaks in general terms, its provisions raise all kinds of issues for scholars, lawyers, judges, politicians, and commentators.
For example, arguments still rage over the nature and meaning of “federalism,” the concept that there is shared governance between the states and the federal government.
The US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and as such it has a unique role in the legal system.
It has assumed the power of judicial review, unique among federal systems globally, through which it can strike down federal or state statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even void the president’s executive orders if they are contrary to the Constitution’s language.
No knowledgeable citizen or businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic provisions.
4.1 Basic Aspects of the US Constitution LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the American values that are reflected in the US Constitution.
2.
Know what federalism means, along with separation of powers.
3.
Explain the process of amending the Constitution and why judicial review is particularly significant.
The Constitution as Reflecting American Values In the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving allegiance is the Constitution.
If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution “against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this oath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a time—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; the fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount.
As you look at the Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it may Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 126  impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” In Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives are elected to public office.
Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and small states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states have two votes.
In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the presidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces.
Article II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the election process.
Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes clear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government.
In general, the idea of rights is particularly strong.
The Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various rights has been in flux.
The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857.
[1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, tedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918.
Both decisions were later repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy could later be repudiated if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court.
[2] General Structure of the Constitution Look at the Constitution.
Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), Article II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary).
Notice that there is no separate article for administrative agencies.
The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article VI).
Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of Rights.
Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to provide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States.
Federalism Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 127  The partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is called federalism.
The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are delegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states.
This is made explicit in the Tenth Amendment.
Separation of Powers and Judicial Review Because the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the executive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure that each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others.
This is known as theseparation of powers.
Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of Representatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills.
Power sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch.
The basic power imbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as Delaware).
The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so the federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small.
The Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations.
The net effect of this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important legislation.
The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently requires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote.
Because the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and “equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases.
The United States is unique among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court that reserves for itself that exclusive power to interpret what the Constitution means.
The famous case of Marbury v. Madison began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme Court had marginal importance in the new republic.
The decision in Bush v. Gore, decided in December of 2000, illustrates the power of the court to shape our destiny as a nation.
In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court regarding the way to proceed on a recount of the Florida vote for the presidency.
The court’s ruling was purportedly based on the “equal protection of the laws” provision in the Fourteenth Amendment.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 128  From Marbury to the present day, the Supreme Court has articulated the view that the US Constitution sets the framework for all other US laws, whether statutory or judicially created.
Thus any statute (or portion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not enforceable.
And as the Bush v. Gore decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do what they might choose; their own sovereignty is limited by their union with the other states in a federal sovereign.
If the Supreme Court makes a “bad decision” as to what the Constitution means, it is not easily overturned.
Either the court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states must make an amendment (Article V).
Because the Supreme Court has this power of judicial review, there have been many arguments about how it should be exercised and what kind of “philosophy” a Supreme Court justice should have.
President Richard Nixon often said that a Supreme Court justice should “strictly construe” the Constitution and not add to its language.
Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” The general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in accord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their own views and values.
Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the Constitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example.
In later years, critics of the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as the right of states to be free from federal antidiscrimination laws.
See, for example, Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, or the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case (Section 4.6.5), which held that corporations are “persons” with “free speech rights” that include spending unlimited amounts of money in campaign donations and political advocacy.
[3] Because Roe v. Wade has been so controversial, this chapter includes a seminal case on “the right of privacy,” Griswold v. Connecticut, Section 4.6.1.
Was the court was correct in recognizing a “right of privacy” in Griswold?
This may not seem like a “business case,” but consider: the manufacture and distribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and legal) business in every US state.
Moreover, Griswold illustrates another important and much- debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive due process (see Section 4.5.3 "Fifth Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 129  Amendment").
The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is brought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy.
Abortion became a lucrative service business after Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.
That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited rather than overruledRoe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, and efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted.
The key here is to understand that there is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy.
As Justice Harry Blackmun argued in his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy.
In a line of decisions, however, the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family relationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
In short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review.
In deciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the Supreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the Constitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its interpretation.
Only a constitutional amendment or the court’s repudiation of Roe v. Wade as a precedent could change that interpretation.
KEY TAKEAWAY The Constitution gives voice to the idea that people have basic rights and that a civilian president is also the commander in chief of the armed forces.
It gives instructions as to how the various branches of government must share power and also tries to balance power between the states and the federal government.
It does not expressly allow for judicial review, but the Supreme Court’s ability to declare what laws are (or are not) constitutional has given the judicial branch a kind of power not seen in other industrialized democracies.
EXERCISES 1.
Suppose the Supreme Court declares that Congress and the president cannot authorize the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects without a trial of some sort, whether military or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 130  civilian.
Suppose also that the people of the United States favor such indefinite detention and that Congress wants to pass a law rebuking the court’s decision.
What kind of law would have to be passed, by what institutions, and by what voting percentages?

When does a prior decision of the Supreme Court deserve overturning?
Name one decision of the Supreme Court that you think is no longer “good law.” Does the court have to wait one hundred years to overturn its prior case precedents?
[1] In Scott v. Sanford (the Dred Scott decision), the court states that Scott should remain a slave, that as a slave he is not a citizen of the United States and thus not eligible to bring suit in a federal court, and that as a slave he is personal property and thus has never been free.

Clause LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Name the specific clause through which Congress has the power to regulate commerce.
What, specifically, does this clause say?
2.
Explain how early decisions of the Supreme Court interpreted the scope of the commerce clause and how that impacted the legislative proposals and programs of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression.
3.
Describe both the wider use of the commerce clause from World War II through the 1990s and the limitations the Supreme Court imposed in Lopez and other cases.
First, turn to Article I, Section 8.
The commerce clause gives Congress the exclusive power to make laws relating to foreign trade and commerce and to commerce among the various states.
Most of the federally created legal environment springs from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the Constitution to make certain laws, then it acts unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
Lately, the Supreme Court has not been shy about ruling acts of Congress unconstitutional.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 131  Here are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which sets forth the powers of the federal legislature.
The commerce clause is in boldface.
It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on this very clause: Section 8 [Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; [Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; [Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; [Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; [Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures; Early Commerce Clause Cases For many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only use it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another.
Anything else was deemed local rather than national.
For example, InHammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute had barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing children under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day.
A complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his own behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other between fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The father’s lawsuit asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to prevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor.
The Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had the power under the commerce clause to control interstate shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen.
The court found that Congress did not.
The court cited several cases that had considered what Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 132  interstate commerce could be constitutionally regulated by Congress.
In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had sustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction into the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs.
[1] In Hoke v. United States, the Supreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, whereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was forbidden.
In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate commerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of lotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of food and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement in prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.” [2] In each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, “[T]he use of interstate transportation was necessary to the accomplishment of harmful results.” In other words, although the power over interstate transportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of interstate commerce to effect the evil intended.
But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was lacking.
The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children could be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless.
Once the labor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact that they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to federal control under the commerce power.” In short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between states.
Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it a fit subject for national regulation.
The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a matter of local regulation.
The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of appeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined.
Goods produced by children under the age of fourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 133  From the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great Society:1930s–1970 During the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and President Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation.
Included in the New Deal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from employers.
Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to enjoin employer practices that violated this right.
In NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-producing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case.
In this case, the NLRB had charged the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members.
The company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding Congress’s powers.
The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial activities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce.
The earlier decisions under the commerce clause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed.
Since the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an essential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations engaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers.
This was, however, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible.
Without this switch, the New Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed.
The Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s Subsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted that even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation.
For example, the case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what appear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2).
Wickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed!
But commerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued.
In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was challenged on the ground that Congress lacked the power under the commerce clause to regulate what was otherwise fairly local conduct.
For example, Title II of the act Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 134  prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodations (such as hotels, motels, and restaurants), leading to the famous case of Katzenbach v. McClung (1964).
Ollie McClung’s barbeque place in Birmingham, Alabama, allowed “colored” people to buy takeout at the back of the restaurant but not to sit down with “white” folks inside.
The US attorney sought a court order to require Ollie to serve all races and colors, but Ollie resisted on commerce clause grounds: the federal government had no business regulating a purely local establishment.
Indeed, Ollie did not advertise nationally, or even regionally, and had customers only from the local area.
But the court found that some 42 percent of the supplies for Ollie’s restaurant had moved in the channels of interstate commerce.
This was enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause.
[3] For nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some interstate commerce connection for any law it might pass.
It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 when the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez.
Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that prohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school.
The law was part of a twenty-year trend (roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime.
Lopez’s lawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged the law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this legislation.
The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the Supreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because education of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near school yards detracted from students’ education.
The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the government’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything.
Lopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court.
Congress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided.
But in passing subsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing a problem that related to interstate commerce.
In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair interstate commerce.
In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 135  Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy Brzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players at Virginia Tech, had raped her.
In 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against Morrison and Crawford under Virginia Tech’s sexual assault policy.
After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to immediate suspension for two semesters.
Crawford was not punished.
A second hearing again found Morrison guilty.
After an appeal through the university’s administrative system, Morrison’s punishment was set aside, as it was found to be “excessive.” Ultimately, Brzonkala dropped out of the university.
Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging that Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender- motivated violence.
Morrison and Crawford moved to dismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional.
In dismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section 13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly identified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA.
Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as did the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the authority to enact a statute under the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute did not regulate an activity that substantially affected interstate commerce nor did it redress harm caused by the state.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court that “under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States.” Dissenting, Justice Stephen G. Breyer argued that the majority opinion “illustrates the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstone.” Justice David H. Souter, dissenting, noted that VAWA contained a “mountain of data assembled by Congress…showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.” The absence of a workable judicial commerce clause touchstone remains.
In 1996, California voters passed the Compassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use.
California’s law conflicted with the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana.
After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 136  marijuana from a patient’s home, a group of medical marijuana users sued the DEA and US Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court.
The medical marijuana users argued that the CSA—which Congress passed using its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce—exceeded Congress’s commerce clause power.
The district court ruled against the group, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional because it applied to medical marijuana use solely within one state.
In doing so, the Ninth Circuit relied on U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) to say that using medical marijuana did not “substantially affect” interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress.
But by a 6–3 majority, the Supreme Court held that the commerce clause gave Congress authority to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana, despite state law to the contrary.
Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the court’s precedents established Congress’s commerce clause power to regulate purely local activities that are part of a “class of activities” with a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a class of activities: the national marijuana market.
Local use affected supply and demand in the national marijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use “essential” to regulating the drug’s national market.
Notice how similar this reasoning is to the court’s earlier reasoning in Wickard v. Filburn (Section 4.6.2).
In contrast, the court’s conservative wing was adamant that federal power had been exceeded.
Justice Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Gonzalez v. Raich stated that Raich’s local cultivation and consumption of marijuana was not “Commerce…among the several States.” Representing the “originalist” view that the Constitution should mostly mean what the Founders meant it to mean, he also said that in the early days of the republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.
KEY TAKEAWAY The commerce clause is the basis on which the federal government regulates interstate economic activity.
The phrase “interstate commerce” has been subject to differing interpretations by the Supreme Court over the past one hundred years.
There are certain Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 137  matters that are essentially local or intrastate, but the range of federal involvement in local matters is still considerable.
EXERCISES 1.
Why would Congress have power under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require restaurants and hotels to not discriminate against interstate travelers on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin?
Suppose the Holiday Restaurant near I-80 in Des Moines, Iowa, has a sign that says, “We reserve the right to refuse service to any Muslim or person of Middle Eastern descent.” Suppose also that the restaurant is very popular locally and that only 40 percent of its patrons are travelers on I-80.
Are the owners of the Holiday Restaurant in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
What would happen if the owners resisted enforcement by claiming that Title II of the act (relating to “public accommodations” such as hotels, motels, and restaurants) was unconstitutional?
2.
If the Supreme Court were to go back to the days of Hammer v. Dagenhart and rule that only goods and services involving interstate movement could be subject to federal law, what kinds of federal programs might be lacking a sound basis in the commerce clause?
“Obamacare”?
Medicare?
Homeland security?
Social Security?
What other powers are granted to Congress under the Constitution to legislate for the general good of society?

4.3 Dormant Commerce Clause LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand that when Congress does not exercise its powers under the commerce clause, the Supreme Court may still limit state legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce or places an undue burden on interstate commerce.
2.
Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-commerce-clause cases.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 138  Congress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate.
For example, Congress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in length.
But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and length of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules.
States may do so under the so-called historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government.
These police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, morals, and the environment.
But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when state action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate.
This power is claimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause.
There are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause.
If a state passes a law that is an “undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be struck down.
Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 "Summary and Exercises", is an example of a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on its highways.
[1] Iowa’s prohibition was judicially declared void when the Supreme Court judged it to be an undue burden.
Discrimination cases such as Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission(Section 4.6 "Cases") pose a different standard.
The court has been fairly inflexible here: if one state discriminates in its treatment of any article of commerce based on its state of origin, the court will strike down the law.
For example, in Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental Quality, the state wanted to place a slightly higher charge on waste coming from out of state.
[2] The state’s reasoning was that in-state residents had already contributed to roads and other infrastructure and that tipping fees at waste facilities should reflect the prior contributions of in-state companies and residents.
Out-of-state waste handlers who wanted to use Oregon landfills objected and won their dormant commerce clause claim that Oregon’s law discriminated “on its face” against interstate commerce.
Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything that moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of something instead of buying something.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 139  Thus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing that differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that originate elsewhere.
If Michigan were to let counties decide for themselves whether to take garbage from outside of the county or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of origin outside the state.
(Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then all Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is discriminatory.)
[3] The Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the basis of origin.
If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply equally to in-state and out-of-state garbage.
Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could still act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state waste from coming into their own borders.
But Congress has declined to do so.
What follows is a statement from one of the US senators from Michigan, Carl Levin, in 2003, regarding the significant amounts of waste that were coming into Michigan from Toronto, Canada.
Dealing with Unwelcome Waste Senator Carl Levin, January 2003 Michigan is facing an intolerable situation with regard to the importation of waste from other states and Canada.
Canada is the largest source of waste imports to Michigan.
Approximately 65 truckloads of waste come in to Michigan per day from Toronto alone, and an estimated 110–130 trucks come in from Canada each day.
This problem isn’t going to get any better.
Ontario’s waste shipments are growing as the Toronto area signs new contracts for waste disposal here and closes its two remaining landfills.
At the beginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, about 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan.
By early this year, barring unforeseen developments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal.
Why can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada?
They say that after 20 years of searching they have not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage.
Ontario has about Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 140  345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles.
With six times the land mass, that argument is laughable.
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of disposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill capacity.
The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise pollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills from sources outside of Michigan.
I have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that would strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada.
We have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and Canada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste.
The U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous waste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal.
In 1992, the two countries decided to add municipal solid waste to the agreement.
To protect both countries, the agreement requires notification of shipments to the importing country and it also provides that the importing country may withdraw consent for shipments.
Both reasons are evidence that these shipments were intended to be limited.
However, the agreement’s provisions have not been enforced by the United States.
Canada could not export waste to Michigan without the 1986 agreement, but the U.S. has not implemented the provisions that are designed to protect the people of Michigan.
Although those of us that introduced this legislation believe that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to enforce this agreement, they have not done so.
Our bill would require the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] to enforce the agreement.
In order to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Michigan and our environment, we must consider the impact of the importation of trash on state and local recycling efforts, landfill capacity, air emissions, road deterioration resulting from increased vehicular traffic and public health and the environment.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 141  Our bill would require the EPA to consider these factors in determining whether to accept imports of trash from Canada.
It is my strong view that such a review should lead the EPA to say “no” to the status quo of trash imports.
KEY TAKEAWAY Where Congress does not act pursuant to its commerce clause powers, the states are free to legislate on matters of commerce under their historic police powers.
However, the Supreme Court has set limits on such powers.
Specifically, states may not impose undue burdens on interstate commerce and may not discriminate against articles in interstate commerce.
EXERCISES 1.
Suppose that the state of New Jersey wishes to limit the amount of hazardous waste that enters into its landfills.
The general assembly in New Jersey passes a law that specifically forbids any hazardous waste from entering into the state.
All landfills are subject to tight regulations that will allow certain kinds of hazardous wastes originating in New Jersey to be put in New Jersey landfills but that impose significant criminal fines on landfill operators that accept out-of-state hazardous waste.
The Baldessari Brothers Landfill in Linden, New Jersey, is fined for taking hazardous waste from a New York State transporter and appeals that ruling on the basis that New Jersey’s law is unconstitutional.
What is the result?
2.
The state of Arizona determines through its legislature that trains passing through the state cannot be longer than seventy cars.
There is some evidence that in Eastern US states longer trains pose some safety hazards.
There is less evidence that long trains are a problem in Western states.
Several major railroads find the Arizona legislation costly and burdensome and challenge the legislation after applied-for permits for longer trains are denied.
What kind of dormant commerce clause challenge is this, and what would it take for the challenge to be successful?

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 142  4.4 Preemption: The Supremacy Clause LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the role of the supremacy clause in the balance between state and federal power.
2.
Give examples of cases where state legislation is preempted by federal law and cases where state legislation is not preempted by federal law.
When Congress does use its power under the commerce clause, it can expressly state that it wishes to have exclusive regulatory authority.
For example, when Congress determined in the 1950s to promote nuclear power (“atoms for peace”), it set up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provided a limitation of liability for nuclear power plants in case of a nuclear accident.
The states were expressly told to stay out of the business of regulating nuclear power or the movement of nuclear materials.
Thus Rochester, Minnesota, or Berkeley, California, could declare itself a nuclear-free zone, but the federal government would have preempted such legislation.
If Michigan wished to set safety standards at Detroit Edison’s Fermi II nuclear reactor that were more stringent than the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s standards, Michigan’s standards would be preempted and thus be void.
Even where Congress does not expressly preempt state action, such action may be impliedly pre- empted.
States cannot constitutionally pass laws that interfere with the accomplishment of the purposes of the federal law.
Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for foreign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States.
If a state creates a law that sets standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so burdensome that they interfere with federal law, the doctrine of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause) void the state law or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with federal law.
But Congress can allow what might appear to be inconsistencies; the existence of federal statutory standards does not always mean that local and state standards cannot be more stringent.
If California wants cleaner air or water than other states, it can set stricter standards— nothing in the Clean Water Act or Clean Air Act forbids the state from setting stricter pollution standards.
As the auto industry well knows, California has set stricter standards for auto Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 143  emissions.
Since the 1980s, most automakers have made both a federal car and a California car, because federal Clean Air Act emissions restrictions do not preempt more rigorous state standards.
Large industries and companies actually prefer regulation at the national level.
It is easier for a large company or industry association to lobby in Washington, DC, than to lobby in fifty different states.
Accordingly, industry often asks Congress to put preemptive language into its statutes.
The tobacco industry is a case in point.
The cigarette warning legislation of the 1960s (where the federal government required warning labels on cigarette packages) effectively preempted state negligence claims based on failure to warn.
When the family of a lifetime smoker who had died sued in New Jersey court, one cause of action was the company’s failure to warn of the dangers of its product.
The Supreme Court reversed the jury’s award based on the federal preemption of failure to warn claims under state law.
[1] The Supremacy Clause Article VI This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
The preemption doctrine derives from the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which states that the “Constitution and the Laws of the United States…shall be the supreme Law of the Land…any Thing in the Constitutions or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” This means of course, that any federal law—even a regulation of a federal agency—would control over any conflicting state law.
Preemption can be either express or implied.
When Congress chooses to expressly preempt state law, the only question for courts becomes determining whether the challenged state law is one that the federal law is intended to preempt.
Implied preemption presents more difficult issues.
The court has to look beyond the express language of federal statutes to determine whether Congress has “occupied the field” in which the state is attempting to regulate, or whether a state Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 144  law directly conflicts with federal law, or whether enforcement of the state law might frustrate federal purposes.
Federal “occupation of the field” occurs, according to the court in Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956), when there is “no room” left for state regulation.
Courts are to look to the pervasiveness of the federal scheme of regulation, the federal interest at stake, and the danger of frustration of federal goals in making the determination as to whether a challenged state law can stand.
In Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee (1984), the court, voting 5–4, found that a $10 million punitive damages award (in a case litigated by famed attorney Gerry Spence) against a nuclear power plant was not impliedly preempted by federal law.
Even though the court had recently held that state regulation of the safety aspects of a federally licensed nuclear power plant was preempted, the court drew a different conclusion with respect to Congress’s desire to displace state tort law—even though the tort actions might be premised on a violation of federal safety regulations.
Cipollone v. Liggett Group (1993) was a closely watched case concerning the extent of an express preemption provision in two cigarette labeling laws of the 1960s.
The case was a wrongful death action brought against tobacco companies on behalf of Rose Cipollone, a lung cancer victim who had started smoking cigarette in the 1940s.
The court considered the preemptive effect on state law of a provision that stated, “No requirement based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes.” The court concluded that several types of state tort actions were preempted by the provision but allowed other types to go forward.
KEY TAKEAWAY In cases of conflicts between state and federal law, federal law will preempt (or control) state law because of the supremacy clause.
Preemption can be express or implied.
In cases where preemption is implied, the court usually finds that compliance with both state and federal law is not possible or that a federal regulatory scheme is comprehensive (i.e., “occupies the field”) and should not be modified by state actions.
EXERCISES 1.
For many years, the United States engaged in discussions with friendly nations as to the reciprocal use of ports and harbors.
These discussions led to various multilateral agreements Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 145  between the nations as to the configuration of oceangoing vessels and how they would be piloted.
At the same time, concern over oil spills in Puget Sound led the state of Washington to impose fairly strict standards on oil tankers and requirements for the training of oil tanker pilots.
In addition, Washington’s state law imposed many other requirements that went above and beyond agreed-upon requirements in the international agreements negotiated by the federal government.
Are the Washington state requirements preempted by federal law?
2.
The Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 requires that all contracts for arbitration be treated as any other contract at common law.
Suppose that the state of Alabama wishes to protect its citizens from a variety of arbitration provisions that they might enter into unknowingly.
Thus the legislation provides that all predispute arbitration clauses be in bold print, that they be of twelve-point font or larger, that they be clearly placed within the first two pages of any contract, and that they have a separate signature line where the customer, client, or patient acknowledges having read, understood, and signed the arbitration clause in addition to any other signatures required on the contract.
The legislation does preserve the right of consumers to litigate in the event of a dispute arising with the product or service provider; that is, with this legislation, consumers will not unknowingly waive their right to a trial at common law.
Is the Alabama law preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act?

4.5 Business and the Bill of Rights LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand and describe which articles in the Bill of Rights apply to business activities and how they apply.
2.
Explain the application of the Fourteenth Amendment—including the due process clause and the equal protection clause—to various rights enumerated in the original Bill of Rights.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 146  We have already seen the Fourteenth Amendment’s application in Burger King v. Rudzewicz (Section 3.9 "Cases").
In that case, the court considered whether it was constitutionally correct for a court to assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident.
The states cannot constitutionally award a judgment against a nonresident if doing so would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.
Even if the state’s long-arm statute would seem to allow such a judgment, other states should not give it full faith and credit (see Article V of the Constitution).
In short, a state’s long-arm statute cannot confer personal jurisdiction that the state cannot constitutionally claim.
The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was originally meant to apply to federal actions only.
During the twentieth century, the court began to apply selected rights to state action as well.
So, for example, federal agents were prohibited from using evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, but state agents were not, until Mapp v. Ohio (1960), when the court applied the guarantees (rights) of the Fourth Amendment to state action as well.
In this and in similar cases, the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause was the basis for the court’s action.
The due process clause commanded that states provide due process in cases affecting the life, liberty, or property of US citizens, and the court saw in this command certain “fundamental guarantees” that states would have to observe.
Over the years, most of the important guarantees in the Bill of Rights came to apply to state as well as federal action.
The court refers to this process as selective incorporation.
Here are some very basic principles to remember: 1.
The guarantees of the Bill of Rights apply only to state and federal government action.
They do not limit what a company or person in the private sector may do.
For example, states may not impose censorship on the media or limit free speech in a way that offends the First Amendment, but your boss (in the private sector) may order you not to talk to the media.
2.
In some cases, a private company may be regarded as participating in “state action.” For example, a private defense contractor that gets 90 percent of its business from the federal government has been held to be public for purposes of enforcing the constitutional right to free speech (the company had a rule barring its employees from speaking out in public against its corporate position).
It has even been argued that public regulation of private activity is sufficient Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 147  to convert the private into public activity, thus subjecting it to the requirements of due process.
But the Supreme Court rejected this extreme view in 1974 when it refused to require private power companies, regulated by the state, to give customers a hearing before cutting off electricity for failure to pay the bill.
[1] 3.
States have rights, too.
While “states rights” was a battle cry of Southern states before the Civil War, the question of what balance to strike between state sovereignty and federal union has never been simple.
In Kimel v. Florida, for example, the Supreme Court found in the words of the Eleventh Amendment a basis for declaring that states may not have to obey certain federal statutes.
First Amendment In part, the First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” The Founding Fathers believed that democracy would work best if people (and the press) could talk or write freely, without governmental interference.
But the First Amendment was also not intended to be as absolute as it sounded.
Oliver Wendell Holmes’s famous dictum that the law does not permit you to shout “Fire!” in a crowded theater has seldom been answered, “But why not?” And no one in 1789 thought that defamation laws (torts for slander and libel) had been made unconstitutional.
Moreover, because the apparent purpose of the First Amendment was to make sure that the nation had a continuing, vigorous debate over matters political, political speech has been given the highest level of protection over such other forms of speech as (1) “commercial speech,” (2) speech that can and should be limited by reasonable “time, place, and manner” restrictions, or (3) obscene speech.
Because of its higher level of protection, political speech can be false, malicious, mean-spirited, or even a pack of lies.
A public official in the United States must be prepared to withstand all kinds of false accusations and cannot succeed in an action for defamation unless the defendant has acted with “malice” and “reckless disregard” of the truth.
Public figures, such as CEOs of the largest US banks, must also be prepared to withstand accusations that are false.
In any defamation action, truth is a defense, but a defamation action brought by a public figure or public official must prove that the defendant not only has his facts wrong but also lies to the public in a malicious way with reckless disregard of the truth.
Celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 148  and Jon Stewart have the same burden to go forward with a defamation action.
It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public officials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the protection of the First Amendment.
Political speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political candidates through campaign contributions and thus promote the particular viewpoints and speech of those candidates.
Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed limitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns.
But the Supreme Court has had mixed reactions over time.
Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate money, subject to certain limits.
[2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the Michigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent expenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices.
But a corporation could make such expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes.
The law was passed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate some regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” The Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of Representatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a nonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm.
The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan law.
Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages with community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business corporations.
Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and implemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process.
But as you will see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission(Section 4.6 "Cases"), Austin was overruled; corporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be impaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on those rights that are “narrowly tailored.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 149  Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a magistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” The court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that are “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be searched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant.
In one case, an auto parts dealer at a junkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts.
Part of his defense was to claim that the search that found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional.
But the court found the search reasonable, because the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” In the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping camera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof.
Because the court’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled constitutional.
Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, and effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable.
(The court’s opinion suggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the pipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.)
Note again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action.
Your employer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits.
For example, if drug testing of all employees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object based on the Fourth Amendment.
However, if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug testing, employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer, or they may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available.
Fifth Amendment Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 150  The Fifth Amendment states, “No person shall be…deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” The Fifth Amendment has three principal aspects: procedural due process, thetakings clause, and substantive due process.
In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents government from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant.
In civil lawsuits, it is also constitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair.
This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger King v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost.
The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property without just compensation.
In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in what is called expropriation.
The standard under customary international law is that when governments do that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation.
This does not always happen, especially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated.
The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment (incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where state, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for public purposes.
Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate.
For example, if a city were to condemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public money to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served?
In Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its attempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have Pfizer & Co. as a principal tenant.
[3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public purpose.
In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not violate the takings clause.
However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new state legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide additional compensation to property owners in many cases.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 151  In addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the source of what is called substantive due process.
During the first third of the twentieth century, the Supreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process.
In 1905, for example, in Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours that bakers could work in a single week.
New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, but the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely contract with one another.
Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down that aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions.
However, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of laws it had struck down earlier.
Since then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims.
Under the first tier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to minimal judicial scrutiny.
This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational government purpose.
Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to “heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to serve a significant government purpose.” The Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties.
The first category includes most of the liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights.
Through a process known as selective incorporation, the court has interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to bar states from denying their residents the most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten amendments to the federal Constitution.
Only the Third Amendment right (against involuntary quartering of soldiers) and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury have not been made applicable to the states.
Because these rights are still not applicable to state governments, the Supreme Court is often said to have “selectively incorporated” the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The second category of fundamental liberties includes those liberties that are not expressly stated in the Bill of Rights but that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and equality in a democratic society.
These unstated liberties come from Supreme Court precedents, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 152  common law, moral philosophy, and deeply rooted traditions of US legal history.
The Supreme Court has stressed that he word libertycannot be defined by a definitive list of rights; rather, it must be viewed as a rational continuum of freedom through which every aspect of human behavior is protected from arbitrary impositions and random restraints.
In this regard, as the Supreme Court has observed, the due process clause protects abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, self-dignity, and self-determination.
These liberty interests often are grouped to form a general right to privacy, which was first recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut (Section 4.6.1), where the Supreme Court struck down a state statute forbidding married adults from using, possessing, or distributing contraceptives on the ground that the law violated the sanctity of the marital relationship.
According to Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion, this penumbra of privacy, though not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be protected to establish a buffer zone or breathing space for those freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated.
But substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since the 1930s.
During the 1990s, the Supreme Court was asked to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of substantive due process.
Although the court stopped short of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may exercise a constitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under a narrow set of circumstances.
In Cruzan v. Missouri Department of Health, the Supreme Court ruled that the due process clause guarantees the right of competent adults to make advanced directives for the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures should they become incapacitated by a disability that leaves them in a persistent vegetative state.
[4] Once it has been established by clear and convincing evidence that a mentally incompetent and persistently vegetative patient made such a prior directive, a spouse, parent, or other appropriate guardian may seek to terminate any form of artificial hydration or nutrition.
Fourteenth Amendment: Due Process and Equal Protection Guarantees The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) requires that states treat citizens of other states with due process.
This can be either an issue of procedural due process (as in Section 3.9 "Cases", Burger King v. Rudzewicz) or an issue of substantive due process.
For substantive due process, consider what happened in an Alabama court not too long ago.
[5] Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 153  The plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000 from a dealer in Alabama.
He later discovered that the vehicle’s exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and had therefore been repainted by the North American distributor prior to his purchase.
The vehicle was, by best estimates, worth about 10 percent less than he paid for it.
The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely sold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of the car.
In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages.
The Alabama trial jury considered that BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to punish the defendant for a number of frauds it estimated at somewhere around a thousand nationwide.
The jury awarded not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4 million in punitive damages, which was later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court.
On appeal to the US Supreme Court, the court found that punitive damages may not be “grossly excessive.” If they are, then they violate substantive due process.
Whatever damages a state awards must be limited to what is reasonably necessary to vindicate the state’s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence.
“Equal protection of the laws” is a phrase that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868.
The amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” This is the equal protection clause.
It means that, generally speaking, governments must treat people equally.
Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be permitted.
A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white children and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public services, such as water fountains or restrooms.
Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, “separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954).
[6] Governments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal protection clause.
People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes.
People with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot be licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine.
To know what classifications are permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified.
The court has created three classifications, and the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 154  outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by knowing how the court is likely to classify the case: • Minimal scrutiny: economic and social relations.
Government actions are usually upheld if there is a rational basis for them.
• Intermediate scrutiny: gender.
Government classifications are sometimes upheld.
• Strict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights.
Classifications based on any of these are almost never upheld.
Under minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues are presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government.
So, for example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more than one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance would not be overturned as a violation of equal protection.
Under intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are men.
For example, suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors must be women, thinking that would attract even more tourism.
A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner test than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation.
A law like this would have to substantially relate to important government objectives.
Increasingly, courts have nullified government sex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown.
(See Shannon Faulkner’s case against The Citadel, an all-male state school.
)[7] Suppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could drive a taxicab or be a street vendor.
That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to see if there was any compelling justification for it.
As noted, classifications such as this one are almost never upheld.
The law would be upheld only if it were necessary to promote a compelling state interest.
Very few laws that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test.
The strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as classifications that interfere with a fundamental right.
In Palmore v. Sidoti, the state Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 155  refused to award custody to the mother because her new spouse was racially different from the child.
[8]This practice was declared unconstitutional because the state had made a racial classification; this was presumptively invalid, and the government could not show a compelling need to enforce such a classification through its law.
An example of government action interfering with a fundamental right will also receive strict scrutiny.
When New York State gave an employment preference to veterans who had been state residents at the time of entering the military, the court declared that veterans who were new to the state were less likely to get jobs and that therefore the statute interfered with the right to travel, which was deemed a fundamental right.
[9] KEY TAKEAWAY The Bill of Rights, through the Fourteenth Amendment, largely applies to state actions.
The Bill of Rights has applied to federal actions from the start.
Both the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment apply to business in various ways, but it is important to remember that the rights conferred are rights against governmental action and not the actions of private enterprise.
EXERCISES 1.
John Hanks works at ProLogis.
The company decides to institute a drug-testing policy.
John is a good and longtime employee but enjoys smoking marijuana on the weekends.
The drug testing will involve urine samples and, semiannually, a hair sample.
It is nearly certain that the drug-testing protocol that ProLogis proposes will find that Hanks is a marijuana user.
The company has made it clear that it will have zero tolerance for any kind of nonprescribed controlled substances.
John and several fellow employees wish to go to court to challenge the proposed testing as “an unreasonable search and seizure.” Can he possibly succeed?
2.
Larry Reed, majority leader in the Senate, is attacked in his reelection campaign by a series of ads sponsored by a corporation (Global Defense, Inc.) that does not like his voting record.
The corporation is upset that Reed would not write a special provision that would favor Global Defense in a defense appropriations bill.
The ads run constantly on television and radio in the weeks immediately preceding election day and contain numerous falsehoods.
For example, in order to keep the government running financially, Reed found it necessary to vote for a bill that included a last-minute rider that defunded a small government program Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 156  for the handicapped, sponsored by someone in the opposing party that wanted to privatize all programs for the handicapped.
The ad is largely paid for by Global Defense and depicts a handicapped child being helped by the existing program and large letters saying “Does Larry Reed Just Not Care?” The ad proclaims that it is sponsored by Citizens Who Care for a Better Tomorrow.
Is this protected speech?
Why or why not?
Can Reed sue for defamation?

4.6 Cases Griswold v. Connecticut Griswold v. Connecticut 381 U.S. 479 (U.S. Supreme Court 1965) A nineteenth-century Connecticut law made the use, possession, or distribution of birth control devices illegal.
The law also prohibited anyone from giving information about such devices.
The executive director and medical director of a planned parenthood association were found guilty of giving out such information to a married couple that wished to delay having children for a few years.
The directors were fined $100 each.
They appealed throughout the Connecticut state court system, arguing that the state law violated (infringed) a basic or fundamental right of privacy of a married couple: to live Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 157  together and have sex together without the restraining power of the state to tell them they may legally have intercourse but not if they use condoms or other birth control devices.
At each level (trial court, court of appeals, and Connecticut Supreme Court), the Connecticut courts upheld the constitutionality of the convictions.
Plurality Opinion by Justice William O. Douglass We do not sit as a super legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions.
The [Connecticut] law, however, operates directly on intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation.
[Previous] cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.…Various guarantees create zones of privacy.
The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.…The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy.
The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which the government may not force him to surrender to his detriment.
The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described…as protection against all governmental invasions “of the sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” We recently referred in Mapp v. Ohio…to the Fourth Amendment as creating a “right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people.” [The law in question here], in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by having a maximum destructive impact on [the marital] relationship.
Such a law cannot stand.…Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?
The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marital relationship.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 158  We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system.
Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.
It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.
Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.
Mr. Justice Stewart, whom Mr. Justice Black joins, dissenting.
Since 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone.
I think this is an uncommonly silly law.
As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case.
As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual’s moral, ethical, and religious beliefs.
As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual’s choice can be meaningfully made.
But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine.
We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution.
And that I cannot do.
In the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth.
But the Court does not say which of these Amendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law.
… As to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States.
It has not even been argued that this is a law “respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the level of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of “the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” No soldier has been quartered in any house.
There has been no search, and no seizure.
Nobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 159  The Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother Goldberg’s concurring opinion relies heavily upon it.
But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history.
The Ninth Amendment, like its companion the Tenth, which this Court held “states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,” United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that the Federal Government was to be a government of express and limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States.
Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder.
What provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid?
The Court says it is the right of privacy “created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.” With all deference, I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court.
At the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not “conform to current community standards.” But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community standards.
We are here to decide cases “agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.” It is the essence of judicial duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is wise and what is not.
If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the people of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it.
That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Which opinion is the strict constructionist opinion here—Justice Douglas’s or that of Justices Stewart and Black?
2.
What would have happened if the Supreme Court had allowed the Connecticut Supreme Court decision to stand and followed Justice Black’s reasoning?
Is it likely that the citizens of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 160  Connecticut would have persuaded their elected representatives to repeal the law challenged here?
Wickard v. Filburn Wickard v. Filburn 317 U.S. 111 (U.S. Supreme Court 1942) Mr. Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the Court.
Mr. Filburn for many years past has owned and operated a small farm in Montgomery County, Ohio, maintaining a herd of dairy cattle, selling milk, raising poultry, and selling poultry and eggs.
It has been his practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; to sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use some in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding.
His 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre.
He sowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under the terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty of 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all.
The general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the volume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the consequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce.
[T]he Secretary of Agriculture is directed to ascertain and proclaim each year a national acreage allotment for the next crop of wheat, which is then apportioned to the states and their counties, and is eventually broken up into allotments for individual farms.
It is urged that under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Article I, § 8, clause 3, Congress does not possess the power it has in this instance sought to exercise.
The question would merit little consideration since our decision in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, sustaining the federal power to regulate production of goods for commerce, except for the fact that this Act extends federal regulation to production not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm.
Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 161  Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. 450 U.S. 662 (U.S. Supreme Court 1981) JUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS joined.
The question is whether an Iowa statute that prohibits the use of certain large trucks within the State unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce.
I Appellee Consolidated Freightways Corporation of Delaware (Consolidated) is one of the largest common carriers in the country: it offers service in 48 States under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities through Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west coast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route.
Consolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks.
One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40- foot two-axle trailer.
This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall.
Such trucks have long been used on the Nation’s highways.
Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle trailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single- axle trailer.
This combination, known as a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall.
Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, increasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities.
Doubles have larger capacities, and the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary.
Consolidated would like to use 65-foot doubles on many of its trips through Iowa.
The State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways.
Unlike all other States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its borders.
… Because of Iowa’s statutory scheme, Consolidated cannot use its 65-foot doubles to move commodities through the State.
Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot doubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) divert 65-foot doubles around Iowa.
Dissatisfied with these Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 162  options, Consolidated filed this suit in the District Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce.
Iowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power.
The State asserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law promotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states.
In a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce imposed by Iowa’s law.
On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly establishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp.
544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979).
For that reason, “there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their configuration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as safe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” “Twins and semis have different characteristics.
Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, and create less splash and spray.
However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset.
They can be backed only for a short distance.
The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less safe than semis overall.
Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” In light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated inRaymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly burdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests.
The total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight and problematical that it does not outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences that seriously impede it.” The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.
612 F.2d 1064 (1979).
It accepted the District Court’s finding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles.
Id.
at 1069.
Thus, the only apparent safety benefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing overall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways.
The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally permissible interest.
It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as those applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited Iowa residents at the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 163  expense of interstate traffic.
Id.
at 1070-1071.
The combination of these exemptions weakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation.
For these reasons, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce.
Iowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction.
446 U.S. 950 (1980).
We now affirm.
II It is unnecessary to review in detail the evolution of the principles of Commerce Clause adjudication.
The Clause is both a “prolific ‘ of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the state[s].” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 336 U.S. 534 (1949).
The Clause permits Congress to legislate when it perceives that the national welfare is not furthered by the independent actions of the States.
It is now well established, also, that the Clause itself is “a limitation upon state power even without congressional implementation.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333 at 350 (1977).
The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from interference by the States.
When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of commerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. 373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone.
The Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce.
It has long been recognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945).
The extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure.
It may be said with confidence, however, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local concern.
Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350.
For example, regulations that touch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to invalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited).
Indeed, “if safety justifications are not illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison with related burdens on interstate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 164  commerce.”Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449.
Those who would challenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a “strong presumption of validity.” Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 at (1959).
But the incantation of a purpose to promote the public health or safety does not insulate a state law from Commerce Clause attack.
Regulations designed for that salutary purpose nevertheless may further the purpose so marginally, and interfere with commerce so substantially, as to be invalid under the Commerce Clause.
In the Court’s recent unanimous decision in Raymond we declined to “accept the State’s contention that the inquiry under the Commerce Clause is ended without a weighing of the asserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” This “weighing” by a court requires—and indeed the constitutionality of the state regulation depends on—“a sensitive consideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden imposed on the course of interstate commerce.” Id.
at 434 U.S. at 441; accord, Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 at 142 (1970); Bibb, supra, at 359 U.S. at 525-530.
III Applying these general principles, we conclude that the Iowa truck length limitations unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.
In Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded the use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause.
This case is Raymond revisited.
Here, as in Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-foot singles.
Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western States.
Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck.
In the absence of congressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must be tolerated.
But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its regulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state law cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause.
A Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 165  Iowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, but its effort was no more persuasive.
As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly establishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding.
The trial focused on a comparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories.
The evidence showed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in the ability to brake, turn, and maneuver.
The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash and spray in wet weather.
And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to dangerous “off- tracking,” and to wind.
None of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa.
Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which the 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; they may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife.
The first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways.
As the District Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is insignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic lanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections.
The concern over backing capability also is insignificant, because it seldom is necessary to back up on an interstate.
In any event, no evidence suggested any difference in backing capability between the 60-foot doubles that Iowa permits and the 65-foot doubles that it bans.
Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than singles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles.
Statistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and 60-foot doubles.
One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative accident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles.
Each kind of truck was driven 56 million miles on identical routes.
The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one fatality.
The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality.
Iowa’s expert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a higher injury rate than doubles.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 166  Another study, prepared by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the request of the state legislature, concluded that “[s]ixty-five foot twin trailer combinations have not been shown by experiences in other states to be less safe than 60-foot twin trailer combinations orconventional tractor-semitrailers.” In sum, although Iowa introduced more evidence on the question of safety than did Wisconsin in Raymond, the record as a whole was not more favorable to the State.
B Consolidated, meanwhile, demonstrated that Iowa’s law substantially burdens interstate commerce.
Trucking companies that wish to continue to use 65-foot doubles must route them around Iowa or detach the trailers of the doubles and ship them through separately.
Alternatively, trucking companies must use the smaller 55-foot singles or 65-foot doubles permitted under Iowa law.
Each of these options engenders inefficiency and added expense.
The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to the costs of trucking companies.
Consolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs.
In addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to consumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents.
Fifty-five-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles.
Either more small trucks must be used to carry the same quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to bypass Iowa.
In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be driven to transport the same quantity of goods.
Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to distance traveled.
Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the number of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States.
[IV.
Omitted] V In sum, the statutory exemptions, their history, and the arguments Iowa has advanced in support of its law in this litigation all suggest that the deference traditionally accorded a State’s Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 167  safety judgment is not warranted.
See Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 444-447.
The controlling factors thus are the findings of the District Court, accepted by the Court of Appeals, with respect to the relative safety of the types of trucks at issue, and the substantiality of the burden on interstate commerce.
Because Iowa has imposed this burden without any significant countervailing safety interest, its statute violates the Commerce Clause.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Under the Constitution, what gives Iowa the right to make rules regarding the size or configuration of trucks upon highways within the state?
2.
Did Iowa try to exempt trucking lines based in Iowa, or was the statutory rule nondiscriminatory as to the origin of trucks that traveled on Iowa highways?
3.
Are there any federal size or weight standards noted in the case?
Is there any kind of truck size or weight that could be limited by Iowa law, or must Iowa simply accept federal standards or, if none, impose no standards at all?
Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission 432 U.S. 33 (U.S. Supreme Court 1977) MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1973, North Carolina enacted a statute which required, inter alia, all closed containers of apples sold, offered for sale, or shipped into the State to bear “no grade other than the applicable U.S. grade or standard.”…Washington State is the Nation’s largest producer of apples, its crops accounting for approximately 30% of all apples grown domestically and nearly half of all apples shipped in closed containers in interstate commerce.
[Because] of the importance of the apple industry to the State, its legislature has undertaken to protect and enhance the reputation of Washington apples by establishing a stringent, mandatory inspection program [that] requires all apples shipped in interstate commerce to be tested under strict quality standards and graded accordingly.
In all cases, the Washington State grades [are] the equivalent of, or superior to, the comparable grades and standards adopted by the [U.S. Dept.
of] Agriculture (USDA).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 168  [In] 1972, the North Carolina Board of Agriculture adopted an administrative regulation, unique in the 50 States, which in effect required all closed containers of apples shipped into or sold in the State to display either the applicable USDA grade or a notice indicating no classification.
State grades were expressly prohibited.
In addition to its obvious consequence—prohibiting the display of Washington State apple grades on containers of apples shipped into North Carolina— the regulation presented the Washington apple industry with a marketing problem of potentially nationwide significance.
Washington apple growers annually ship in commerce approximately 40 million closed containers of apples, nearly 500,000 of which eventually find their way into North Carolina, stamped with the applicable Washington State variety and grade.
[Compliance] with North Carolina’s unique regulation would have required Washington growers to obliterate the printed labels on containers shipped to North Carolina, thus giving their product a damaged appearance.
Alternatively, they could have changed their marketing practices to accommodate the needs of the North Carolina market, i.e., repack apples to be shipped to North Carolina in containers bearing only the USDA grade, and/or store the estimated portion of the harvest destined for that market in such special containers.
As a last resort, they could discontinue the use of the preprinted containers entirely.
None of these costly and less efficient options was very attractive to the industry.
Moreover, in the event a number of other States followed North Carolina’s lead, the resultant inability to display the Washington grades could force the Washington growers to abandon the State’s expensive inspection and grading system which their customers had come to know and rely on over the 60-odd years of its existence.… Unsuccessful in its attempts to secure administrative relief [with North Carolina], the Commission instituted this action challenging the constitutionality of the statute.
[The] District Court found that the North Carolina statute, while neutral on its face, actually discriminated against Washington State growers and dealers in favor of their local counterparts [and] concluded that this discrimination [was] not justified by the asserted local interest—the elimination of deception and confusion from the marketplace—arguably furthered by the [statute].
… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 169  [North Carolina] maintains that [the] burdens on the interstate sale of Washington apples were far outweighed by the local benefits flowing from what they contend was a valid exercise of North Carolina’s [police powers].
Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North Carolina for sale.
Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, while differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.).
This multiplicity of inconsistent state grades [posed] dangers of deception and confusion not only in the North Carolina market, but in the Nation as a whole.
The North Carolina statute, appellants claim, was enacted to eliminate this source of deception and confusion.
[Moreover], it is contended that North Carolina sought to accomplish this goal of uniformity in an evenhanded manner as evidenced by the fact that its statute applies to all apples sold in closed containers in the State without regard to their point of origin.
[As] the appellants properly point out, not every exercise of state authority imposing some burden on the free flow of commerce is invalid, [especially] when the State acts to protect its citizenry in matters pertaining to the sale of foodstuffs.
By the same token, however, a finding that state legislation furthers matters of legitimate local concern, even in the health and consumer protection areas, does not end the inquiry.
Rather, when such state legislation comes into conflict with the Commerce Clause’s overriding requirement of a national “common market,” we are confronted with the task of effecting an accommodation of the competing national and local interests.
We turn to that task.
As the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening interstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them.
This discrimination takes various forms.
The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing business in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of their North Carolina counterparts unaffected.
[This] disparate effect results from the fact that North Carolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing practices in order to comply with the statute.
They were still free to market their wares under the USDA grade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment.
Obviously, the increased costs imposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington apple Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 170  growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance from the North Carolina market.
Second, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive and economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system.
The record demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the apple trade.
[The record] contains numerous affidavits [stating a] preference [for] apples graded under the Washington, as opposed to the USDA, system because of the former’s greater consistency, its emphasis on color, and its supporting mandatory inspections.
Once again, the statute had no similar impact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit.
Third, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, the statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers.
[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage vis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior.
However, because of the statute’s operation, Washington apples which would otherwise qualify for and be sold under the superior Washington grades will now have to be marketed under their inferior USDA counterparts.
Such “downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-of-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit.
At worst, it will have the effect of an embargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them from the North Carolina market.
At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that such apples would otherwise command.
Despite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on interstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to that effect.
The most glaring is the response of the North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner to the Commission’s request for an exemption following the statute’s passage in which he indicated that before he could support such an exemption, he would “want to have the sentiment from our apple producers since they were mainly responsible for this legislation being passed.” [Moreover], we find it somewhat suspect that North Carolina singled out only Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 171  closed containers of apples, the very means by which apples are transported in commerce, to effectuate the statute’s ostensible consumer protection purpose when apples are not generally sold at retail in their shipping containers.
However, we need not ascribe an economic protection motive to the North Carolina Legislature to resolve this case; we conclude that the challenged statute cannot stand insofar as it prohibits the display of Washington State grades even if enacted for the declared purpose of protecting consumers from deception and fraud in the marketplace.
… Finally, we note that any potential for confusion and deception created by the Washington grades was not of the type that led to the statute’s enactment.
Since Washington grades are in all cases equal or superior to their USDA counterparts, they could only “deceive” or “confuse” a consumer to his benefit, hardly a harmful result.
In addition, it appears that nondiscriminatory alternatives to the outright ban of Washington State grades are readily available.
For example, North Carolina could effectuate its goal by permitting out-of-state growers to utilize state grades only if they also marked their shipments with the applicable USDA label.
In that case, the USDA grade would serve as a benchmark against which the consumer could evaluate the quality of the various state grades.… [The court affirmed the lower court’s holding that the North Carolina statute was unconstitutional.]
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Was the North Carolina law discriminatory on its face?
Was it, possibly, an undue burden on interstate commerce?

Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission 588 U.S. ____; 130 S.Ct.
876 (U.S. Supreme Court 2010) Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 172  Federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an “electioneering communication” or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate.
2 U.S.C.
§441b.
Limits on electioneering communications were upheld inMcConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U.S. 93, 203–209 (2003).
The holding ofMcConnell rested to a large extent on an earlier case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990).
Austin had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker’s corporate identity.
In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in effect, McConnell.
It has been noted that “Austin was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,” Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 490 (2007) (WRTL) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
We agree with that conclusion and hold that stare decisis does not compel the continued acceptance of Austin.
The Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether.
We turn to the case now before us.
I A Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation.
It has an annual budget of about $12 million.
Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corporations.
In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled Hillary: The Movie.

Hillary mentions Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator Clinton.… In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to makeHillary available on a video-on-demand channel called “Elections ’08.”…Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10- second ads and one 30-second ad for Hillary.
Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the movie’s Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 173  Website address.
Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand offering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable television.
B Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibited—and still does prohibit—corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make direct contributions to candidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections.…BCRA §203 amended §441b to prohibit any “electioneering communication” as well.
An electioneering communication is defined as “any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.
§434(f)(3)(A).
The Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as a communication that is “publicly distributed.” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2) (2009).
“In the case of a candidate for nomination for President…publicly distributed means” that the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election…is being held within 30 days.” 11 CFR §100.29(b)(3)(ii).
Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or electioneering communications.
They may establish, however, a “separate segregated fund” (known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes.
2 U.S.C.
§441b(b)(2).
The moneys received by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union.
Ibid.
C Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary elections.
It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by §441b’s ban on corporate-funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal penalties under §437g.
In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the FEC.
It argued that (1) §441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA §§201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the three ads for the movie.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 174  The District Court denied Citizens United’s motion for a preliminary injunction, and then granted the FEC’s motion for summary judgment.
… The court held that §441b was facially constitutional under McConnell, and that §441b was constitutional as applied to Hillary because it was “susceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote against her.” 530 F. Supp.
2d, at 279.
The court also rejected Citizens United’s challenge to BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure requirements.
It noted that “the Supreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though the speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.” Id.
at 281.
II [Omitted: the court considers whether it is possible to reject the BCRA without declaring certain provisions unconstitutional.
The court concludes it cannot find a basis to reject the BCRA that does not involve constitutional issues.]
III The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” Laws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process.…The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.
Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election.
Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S.
Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech.
These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 175  Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak.
PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.
For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve receipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within 10 days.
And that is just the beginning.
PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… PACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak.
This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this country have PACs.
PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak.
Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views known regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign.
Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech.
As a “restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 at 19 (1976).… Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people.
See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it.
The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent application’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” For these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence.
Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the Government to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” … Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 176  The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations.
This protection has been extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech.
Under the rationale of these precedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a corporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784.
The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not “natural persons.” The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations, from presenting both facts and opinions to the public.
This makes Austin’s antidistortion rationale all the more an aberration.
“[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and administrative bodies.” Bellotti, 435 U.S., at 792, n. 31.… Even if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so.
And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures.
See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U.S., at 503–504 (opinion of Scalia, J.)
(“In the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142 million to [26 U.S.C.
§527 organizations]”).
Yet certain disfavored associations of citizens—those that have taken on the corporate form—are penalized for engaging in the same political speech.
When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought.
This is unlawful.
The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.
What we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government.
For the most part relinquishing the anti-distortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.… When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy.
If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern.
We must give weight to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 177  attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences.
The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule.
An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.
Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to preventing quid pro quocorruption.
Our precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts us on a course that is sure error.
“Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.” [citing prior cases] These considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Austin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier precedents in Buckley and Bellotti.
“This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the First Amendment.” WRTL, 551 U.S., at 500 (opinion of Scalia, J.).
“[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106 at 119 (1940).
Austin is undermined by experience since its announcement.
Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws.
See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U.S., at 176–177 (“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives…to exploit [26 U.S.C.
§527] organizations will only increase”).
Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights.
Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle.
Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views.
On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.
Rapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—counsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.
Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 178  political message.
Soon, however, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide citizens with significant information about political candidates and issues.
Yet, §441b would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds.
The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions based on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech.
Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled.
We return to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s corporate identity.
No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.
[IV.
Omitted] V When word concerning the plot of the movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington reached the circles of Government, some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution.
See Smoodin, “Compulsory” Viewing for Every Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, Capra’s Capitol Offense, N. Y.
Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5.
Under Austin, though, officials could have done more than discourage its distribution—they could have banned the film.
After all, it, likeHillary, was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress.Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force.
Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on YouTube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways.
Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media corporation, has made the “purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value” in order to engage in political speech.
2 U.S.C.
§431(9)(A)(i).
Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election.
Governments are Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 179  often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime.
Yet this is the statute’s purpose and design.
Some members of the public might consider Hillary to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation’s course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates.
Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Government to make.
“The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech.
Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas.
The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.” McConnell, supra, at 341 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
The judgment of the District Court is reversed with respect to the constitutionality of 2 U.S.C.
§441b’s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures.
The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
What does the case say about disclosure?
Corporations have a right of free speech under the First Amendment and may exercise that right through unrestricted contributions of money to political parties and candidates.
Can the government condition that right by requiring that the parties and candidates disclose to the public the amount and origin of the contribution?
What would justify such a disclosure requirement?
2.
Are a corporation’s contributions to political parties and candidates tax deductible as a business expense?
Should they be?
3.
How is the donation of money equivalent to speech?
Is this a strict construction of the Constitution to hold that it is?
4.
Based on the Court’s description of the Austin case, what purpose do you think the Austin court was trying to achieve by limiting corporate campaign contributions?
Was that purpose consistent (or inconsistent) with anything in the Constitution, or is the Constitution essentially silent on this issue?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 180  4.7 Summary and Exercises Summary The US.
Constitution sets the framework for all other laws of the United States, at both the federal and the state level.
It creates a shared balance of power between states and the federal government (federalism) and shared power among the branches of government (separation of powers), establishes individual rights against governmental action (Bill of Rights), and provides for federal oversight of matters affecting interstate commerce and commerce with foreign nations.
Knowing the contours of the US legal system is not possible without understanding the role of the US Constitution.
The Constitution is difficult to amend.
Thus when the Supreme Court uses its power of judicial review to determine that a law is unconstitutional, it actually shapes what the Constitution means.
New meanings that emerge must do so by the process of amendment or by the passage of time and new appointments to the court.
Because justices serve for life, the court changes its philosophical outlook slowly.
The Bill of Rights is an especially important piece of the Constitutional framework.
It provides legal causes of action for infringements of individual rights by government, state or federal.
Through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, both procedural and (to some extent) substantive due process rights are given to individuals.
EXERCISES 1.
For many years, the Supreme Court believed that “commercial speech” was entitled to less protection than other forms of speech.
One defining element of commercial speech is that its dominant theme is to propose a commercial transaction.
This kind of speech is protected by the First Amendment, but the government is permitted to regulate it more closely than other forms of speech.
However, the government must make reasonable distinctions, must narrowly tailor the rules restricting commercial speech, and must show that government has a legitimate goal that the law furthers.
Edward Salib owned a Winchell’s Donut House in Mesa, Arizona.
To attract customers, he displayed large signs in store windows.
The city ordered him to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 181  remove the signs because they violated the city’s sign code, which prohibited covering more than 30 percent of a store’s windows with signs.
Salib sued, claiming that the sign code violated his First Amendment rights.
What was the result, and why?

Jennifer is a freshman at her local public high school.
Her sister, Jackie, attends a nearby private high school.
Neither school allows them to join its respective wrestling team; only boys can wrestle at either school.
Do either of them have a winning case based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
3.
The employees of the US Treasury Department that work the border crossing between the United States and Mexico learned that they will be subject to routine drug testing.
The customs bureau, which is a division of the treasury department, announces this policy along with its reasoning: since customs agents must routinely search for drugs coming into the United States, it makes sense that border guards must themselves be completely drug-free.
Many border guards do not use drugs, have no intention of using drugs, and object to the invasion of their privacy.
What is the constitutional basis for their objection?

On your second day at work, you wear a political button on your coat, supporting your choice for US senator in the upcoming election.

6.
David Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential parcels on the Isle of Palms near Charleston, South Carolina.
His intention was to build houses on them.
Two years later, the South Carolina legislature passed a statute that prohibited building beachfront properties.
The purpose was to leave the dunes system in place to mitigate the effects of hurricanes and strong storms.
The South Carolina Coastal Commission created the rules and regulations with Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 182  substantial input from the community and from experts and with protection of the dune system primarily in mind.
People had been building on the shoreline for years, with harmful results to localities and the state treasury.
When Lucas applied for permits to build two houses near the shoreline, his permits were rejected.
He sued, arguing that the South Carolina legislation had effectively “taken” his property.
At trial, South Carolina conceded that because of the legislation, Lucas’s property was effectively worth zero.
Has there been a taking under the Fifth Amendment (as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment), and if so, what should the state owe to Lucas?
Suppose that Lucas could have made an additional $1 million by building a house on each of his parcels.
Is he entitled to recover his original purchase price or his potential profits?
SELF-TEST QUESTIONS 1.
Harvey filed a suit against the state of Colorado, claiming that a Colorado state law violates the commerce clause.
The court will agree if the statute a. places an undue burden on interstate commerce b. promotes the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare of Colorado c. regulates economic activities within the state’s borders d. a and b e. b and c The state legislature in Maine enacts a law that directly conflicts with a federal law.
Mapco Industries, located in Portland, Maine, cannot comply with both the state and the federal law.
a.
Because of federalism, the state law will have priority, as long as Maine is using its police powers.
b.
Because there’s a conflict, both laws are invalid; the state and the federal government will have to work out a compromise of some sort.
c. The federal law preempts the state law.
d. Both laws govern concurrently.
Hannah, who lives in Ada, is the owner of Superior Enterprises, Inc. She believes that certain actions in the state of Ohio infringe on her federal Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 183  constitutional rights, especially those found in the Bill of Rights.
Most of these rights apply to the states under a. the supremacy clause b. the protection clause c. the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment d. the Tenth Amendment Minnesota enacts a statute that bans all advertising that is in “bad taste,” “vulgar,” or “indecent.” In Michigan, Aaron Calloway and his brother, Clarence “Cab” Calloway, create unique beer that they decide to call Old Fart Ale.
In their marketing, the brothers have a label in which an older man in a dirty T-shirt is sitting in easy chair, looking disheveled and having a three-day growth of stubble on his chin.
It appears that the man is in the process of belching.
He is also holding a can of Old Fart Ale.
The Minnesota liquor commission orders all Minnesota restaurants, bars, and grocery stores to remove Old Fart Ale from their shelves.
The state statute and the commission’s order are likely to be held by a court to be a. a violation of the Tenth Amendment b. a violation of the First Amendment c. a violation of the Calloways’ right to equal protection of the laws d. a violation of the commerce clause, since only the federal laws can prevent an article of commerce from entering into Minnesota’s market Raunch Unlimited, a Virginia partnership, sells smut whenever and wherever it can.
Some of its material is “obscene” (meeting the Supreme Court’s definition under Miller v. California) and includes child pornography.
North Carolina has a statute that criminalizes obscenity.
What are possible results if a store in Raleigh, North Carolina, carries Raunch merchandise?
a.
The partners could be arrested in North Carolina and may well be convicted.
b.
The materials in Raleigh may be the basis for a criminal conviction.
c. The materials are protected under the First Amendment’s right of free speech.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 184  d. The materials are protected under state law.
e. a and b SELF-TEST ANSWERS 1. a 2. c 3. c 4. b 5. e Chapter 5 Administrative Law LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Understand the purpose served by federal administrative agencies.
2.
Know the difference between executive branch agencies and independent agencies.
3.
Understand the political control of agencies by the president and Congress.
4.
Describe how agencies make rules and conduct hearings.
5.
Describe how courts can be used to challenge administrative rulings.
From the 1930s on, administrative agencies, law, and procedures have virtually remade our government and much of private life.
Every day, business must deal with rules and decisions of state and federal administrative agencies.
Informally, such rules are often called regulations, and they differ (only in their source) from laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.
The rules created by agencies are voluminous: thousands of new regulations pour forth each year.
The overarching question of whether there is too much regulation—or the wrong kind of regulation—of our economic activities is an important one but well beyond the scope of this chapter, in which we offer an overview of the purpose of administrative agencies, their structure, and their impact on business.
5.1 Administrative Agencies: Their Structure and Powers LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 185  1.
Explain the reasons why we have federal administrative agencies.
2.
Explain the difference between executive branch agencies and independent agencies.
3.
Describe the constitutional issue that questions whether administrative agencies could have authority to make enforceable rules that affect business.
Why Have Administrative Agencies?
The US Constitution mentions only three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial (Articles I, II, and III).
There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies are sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the legitimacy of federaladministrative agencies to make rules that have the same binding effect as statutes by Congress.
Most commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) Congress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., communications, the environment, aviation).
(2) Because of this, it makes sense for Congress to set forth broad statutory guidance to an agency and delegate authority to the agency to propose rules that further the statutory purposes.
(3) As long as Congress makes this delegating guidance sufficiently clear, it is not delegating improperly.
If Congress’s guidelines are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away its constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot do.
Why Regulate the Economy at All?
The market often does not work properly, as economists often note.
Monopolies, for example, happen in the natural course of human events but are not always desirable.
To fix this, well- conceived and objectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed.
Negative externalities must be “fixed,” as well.
For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, and the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments.
In terms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to compensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented to bear those costs.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 186  In terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection can prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that would keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business.
For example, if the small town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees to be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and federal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law struck down as unconstitutional.
Knowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek to level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent information for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the toxics release inventory laws in environmental law).
Ideal Conditions for a Free Market 1.
There are many buyers and many sellers, and none of them has a substantial share of the market.
2.
All buyers and sellers in the market are free to enter the market or leave it.
3.
All buyers and all sellers have full and perfect knowledge of what other buyers and sellers are up to, including knowledge of prices, quantity, and quality of all goods being bought or sold.
4.
The goods being sold in the market are similar enough to each other that participants do not have strong preferences as to which seller or buyer they deal with.
5.
The costs and benefits of making or using the goods that are exchanged in the market are borne only by those who buy or sell those goods and not by third parties or people “external” to the market transaction.
(That is, there are no “externalities.”) 6.
All buyers and sellers are utility maximizers; each participant in the market tries to get as much as possible for as little as possible.
7.
There are no parties, institutions, or governmental units regulating the price, quantity, or quality of any of the goods being bought and sold in the market.
In short, some forms of legislation and regulation are needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation of economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain individuals and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 187  groups and to insist that people and companies clean up their own messes and not hide information that would empower voluntary choices in the free market.
But there are additional reasons to regulate.
For example, in economic systems, it is likely for natural monopolies to occur.
These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the good or service.
Having duplicate (or triplicate) systems for supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so most states have a public utilities commission to determine both price and quality of service.
This is direct regulation.
Sometimes destructive competition can result if there is no regulation.
Banking and insurance are good examples of this.
Without government regulation of banks (setting standards and methods), open and fierce competition would result in widespread bank failures.
That would erode public confidence in banks and business generally.
The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, however, an example of destructive noncompetition.
Other market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation.
For example, there is a need to regulate frequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, national defense, etc.).
Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something that must be created by government.
On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods such as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense.
True laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market imperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements that historically have been deemed socially unacceptable.
These would include making enforceable contracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or crack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage partnership.
Thus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by what is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well.
Public policy objectives in the social arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or unsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers from unsafe products.
Sometimes these Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 188  objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can be used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment discrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and monitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company).
History of Federal Agencies Through the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between the states and with foreign nations.
The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, to literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce.
The first federal agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887.
Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce federal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices.
By the early part of this century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates.
From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress passed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to the Surface Transportation Board.
Beginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other agencies, many of them familiar actors in American government.
Today more than eighty- five federal agencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity.
Most were created since 1930, and more than a third since 1960.
A similar growth has occurred at the state level.
Most states now have dozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies.
Classification of Agencies Independent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by their structural and functional characteristics.
Most executive departments have a single director, administrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States.
Independent agencies almost always have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency.
The president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve with staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term.
They cannot be removed except for “good cause.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 189  This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the commissioners of a given independent agency.
Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement of bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members of his own political party.
In addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications Commission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), and Environmental Protection Agency (1970).
See Note 5.4 "Ideal Conditions for a Free Market" in the sidebar.
By contrast, members of executive branch agencies serve at the pleasure of the president and are therefore far more amenable to political control.
One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that independent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff— only Congress may directly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may oversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by Congress).
Powers of Agencies Agencies have a variety of powers.
Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal Communications Act, gave them licensing power.
No party can enter into the productive activity covered by the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power plant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
In recent years, the move toward deregulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power.
Many agencies also have the authority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction.
Finally, the agencies can regulate business practices.
The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce to monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of the stock exchanges.
Unlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific assignment or reaching a goal or set of goals.
They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the day; they must act.
They have been given legislative powers because in a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 190  society growing ever more complex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it have the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried.
Precisely because they are to do what general legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies.
Through years of experience in dealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish their statutory duties.
All administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel.
The heads, whether a single administrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively limited terms.
Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy.
Much policy making occurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting data and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies.
The Constitution and Agencies Congress can establish an agency through legislation.
When Congress gives powers to an agency, the legislation is known as an enabling act.
The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is known as the delegation doctrine.
Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, legislative, and judicial.
(That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can investigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those rules.
They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.)
Because agencies have all three types of governmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them.
The most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power.
Was the separation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative statutes?
In 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National Industrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad.
[1] Under the law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the entire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president.
No administrative body was created to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a code against another.
Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers to an agency.
In later Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 191  decisions, it was made clear that Congress could delegate some of its legislative powers, but only if the delegation of authority was not overly broad.
Still, some congressional enabling acts are very broad, such as the enabling legislation for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is given the authority to make rules to provide for safe and healthful working conditions in US workplaces.
Such a broad initiative power gives OSHA considerable discretion.
But, as noted in Section 5.2 "Controlling Administrative Agencies", there are both executive and judicial controls over administrative agency activities, as well as ongoing control by Congress through funding and the continuing oversight of agencies, both in hearings and through subsequent statutory amendments.
KEY TAKEAWAY Congress creates administrative agencies through enabling acts.
In these acts, Congress must delegate authority by giving the agency some direction as to what it wants the agency to do.
Agencies are usually given broad powers to investigate, set standards (promulgating regulations), and enforce those standards.
Most agencies are executive branch agencies, but some are independent.

5.2 Controlling Administrative Agencies LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how the president controls administrative agencies.
2.
Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies.
3.
Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies.
During the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill terms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking.
One criticism is that agencies are Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 192  “captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate.
Another is that they overregulate, stifling individual initiative and the ability to compete.
During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of federal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones.
In the late 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and deregulation increased under the Reagan administration.
But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, Enron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has led to reregulation of the financial sector.
It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make agencies more effective regulators.
Administrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, incorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at best in the framework of American government (seeFigure 5.1 "Major Administrative Agencies of the United States").
They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the executive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control over them.
In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug Administration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a position by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims.
Figure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 193  Legislative Control Congress can always pass a law repealing a regulation that an agency promulgates.
Because this is a time-consuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely.
Another approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations.
By retaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over regulatory policy.
Executive Control The president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are part of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent.
Federal agencies, moreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the direct control of the president.
Agencies are not permitted to go Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 194  directly to Congress for increases in budget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over the continuation of administrators’ programs and policies.
Judicial Review of Agency Actions Administrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law.
The courts have jurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some unlawful manner.
Courts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better situated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them by Congress.
Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons.
However, after a business (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial review of a final agency decision.
The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency actions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 "Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review" on “Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”).
KEY TAKEAWAY Administrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate.
But these powers are limited by executive and legislative controls and by judicial review.

5.3 The Administrative Procedure Act LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed.
2.
Understand how hearings are conducted under the act.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 195  3.
Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies.
In 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
This fundamental statute detailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases or issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration.
At the state level, the Model State Administrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision.
The other states have statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree.
Trial-Type Hearings Deciding cases is a major task of many agencies.
For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is empowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act.
Perhaps a seller is accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising.
Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff counsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers.
The case is tried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing examiner.
The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more accurately reflect their duties.
Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free of assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the agency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function.
The accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, to cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.
Ex parte (eks PAR-tay) communications—contacts between the ALJ and outsiders or one party when both parties are not present—are prohibited.
However, the usual burden-of-proof standard followed in a civil proceeding in court does not apply: the ALJ is not bound to decide in favor of that party producing the more persuasive evidence.
The rule in most administrative proceedings is “substantial evidence,” evidence that is not flimsy or weak, but is not necessarily overwhelming evidence, either.
The ALJ in most cases will write an opinion.
That opinion is not the decision of the agency, which can be made only by the commissioners or agency head.
In effect, the ALJ’s opinion is appealed to the commission itself.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 196  Certain types of agency actions that have a direct impact on individuals need not be filtered through a full-scale hearing.
Safety and quality inspections (grading of food, inspection of airplanes) can be made on the spot by skilled inspectors.
Certain licenses can be administered through tests without a hearing (a test for a driver’s license), and some decisions can be made by election of those affected (labor union elections).
Rulemaking Trial-type hearings generally impose on particular parties liabilities based on past or present facts.
Because these cases will serve as precedents, they are a partial guide to future conduct by others.
But they do not directly apply to nonparties, who may argue in a subsequent case that their conduct does not fit within the holding announced in the case.
Agencies can affect future conduct far more directly by announcing rules that apply to all who come within the agency’s jurisdiction.
The acts creating most of the major federal agencies expressly grant them authority to engage in rulemaking.
This means, in essence, authority to legislate.
The outpouring of federal regulations has been immense.
The APA directs agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the <em class="emphasis">Federal Register</em class="emphasis"> of their intent to do so.
The Federal Register is published daily, Monday through Friday, in Washington, DC, and contains notice of various actions, including announcements of proposed rulemaking and regulations as adopted.
The notice must specify the time, place, and nature of the rulemaking and offer a description of the proposed rule or the issues involved.
Any interested person or organization is entitled to participate by submitting written “data, views or arguments.” Agencies are not legally required to air debate over proposed rules, though they often do so.
The procedure just described is known as “informal” rulemaking.
A different procedure is required for “formal” rulemaking, defined as those instances in which the enabling legislation directs an agency to make rules “on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.” When engaging in formal rulemaking, agencies must hold an adversary hearing.
Administrative regulations are not legally binding unless they are published.
Agencies must publish in the Federal Register the text of final regulations, which ordinarily do not become effective until thirty days later.
Every year the annual output of regulations is collected and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 197  reprinted in the <em class="emphasis">Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)</em class="emphasis">, a multivolume paperback series containing all federal rules and regulations keyed to the fifty titles of the US Code (the compilation of all federal statutes enacted by Congress and grouped according to subject).
KEY TAKEAWAY Agencies make rules that have the same effect as laws passed by Congress and the president.
But such rules (regulations) must allow for full participation by interested parties.
The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs both rulemaking and the agency enforcement of regulations, and it provides a process for fair hearings.

5.4 Administrative Burdens on Business Operations LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the paperwork burden imposed by administrative agencies.
2.
Explain why agencies have the power of investigation, and what limits there are to that power.
3.
Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system.
The Paperwork Burden The administrative process is not frictionless.
The interplay between government agency and private enterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways.
Several of these are noted in this section.
Deciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue.
They rely heavily on information garnered from business itself.
Dozens of federal agencies require corporations to keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports.
The Commission on Federal Paperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 198  ways of reducing the paperwork burden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to $50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork alone.
The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs upward of $15 million.
Not surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data.
Since the 1940s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from individual companies for statistical purposes.
As long as each company engages in a single line of business, data are comparable.
When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent types of businesses brought together under the roof of a single corporate parent, the data became useless for purposes of examining the competitive behavior of different industries.
So the FTC ordered dozens of large companies to break out their economic information according to each line of business that they carried on.
The companies resisted, but the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where much of the litigation over federal administrative action is decided, directed the companies to comply with the commission’s order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly permits the agency to collect information for investigatory purposes.
[1] In 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals, and state and local governments were being swamped by federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act.
It gives power to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform policies for coordinating the gathering, storage, and transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year to the scores of federal departments and agencies requesting information.
These reports include tax and Medicare forms, financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts, compliance reports, and tax and business records.
The OMB was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of information are needed.
In effect, any agency that wants to collect new information from outside must obtain the OMB’s approval.
Inspections No one likes surprise inspections.
A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers agents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety hazards and for violations of OSHA regulations.
The act does not specify Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 199  whether inspectors are required to obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases.
For many years, the government insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a warrant would defeat the surprise element.
The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978.
In Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled to refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant.
[2] But where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no warrant is required.
For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to both overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an underage patron to the store).
Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may also be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the resale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts.
[3] It is also possible for inspections to take place without a search warrant and without the permission of the business.
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wished to inspect parts of the Dow Chemical facility in Midland, Michigan, without the benefit of warrant.
When they were refused, agents of the EPA obtained a fairly advanced aerial mapping camera and rented an airplane to fly over the Dow facility.
Dow went to court for a restraining order against the EPA and a request to have the EPA turn over all photographs taken.
But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas photographed were “open fields” and not subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment.
[4] Access to Business Information in Government Files In 1966, Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), opening up to the citizenry many of the files of the government.
(The act was amended in 1974 and again in 1976 to overcome a tendency of many agencies to stall or refuse access to their files.)
Under the FOIA, any person has a legally enforceable right of access to all government documents, with nine specific exceptions, such as classified military intelligence, medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial information if “obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” Without the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions, business competitors could, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 200  merely by requesting it, obtain highly sensitive competitive information sitting in government files.
A federal agency is required under the FOIA to respond to a document request within ten days.
But in practice, months or even years may pass before the government actually responds to an FOIA request.
Requesters must also pay the cost of locating and copying the records.
Moreover, not all documents are available for public inspection.
Along with the trade-secret and financial- information exemptions, the FOIA specifically exempts the following: • records required by executive order of the president to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or public policy • records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practice of an agency • records exempted from disclosure by another statute • interagency memos or decisions reflecting the deliberative process • personnel files and other files that if disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy • information compiled for law enforcement purposes • geological information concerning wells Note that the government may provide such information but is not required to provide such information; it retains discretion to provide information or not.
Regulated companies are often required to submit confidential information to the government.
For these companies, submitting such information presents a danger under the FOIA of disclosure to competitors.
To protect information from disclosure, the company is well advised to mark each document as privileged and confidential so that government officials reviewing it for a FOIA request will not automatically disclose it.
Most agencies notify a company whose data they are about to disclose.
But these practices are not legally required under the FOIA.
KEY TAKEAWAY Government agencies, in order to do their jobs, collect a great deal of information from businesses.
This can range from routine paperwork (often burdensome) to inspections, those with warrants and those without.
Surprise inspections are allowed for closely regulated Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 201  industries but are subject to Fourth Amendment requirements in general.
Some information collected by agencies can be accessed using the Freedom of Information Act.
EXERCISES 1.
Give two examples of a closely regulated industry.
Explain why some warrantless searches would be allowed.
2.
Find out why FOIA requests often take months or years to accomplish.

5.5 The Scope of Judicial Review LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the “exhaustion of remedies” requirement.
2.
Detail various strategies for obtaining judicial review of agency rules.
3.
Explain under what circumstances it is possible to sue the government.
Neither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final.
Most federal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts.
To get to court, the appellant must overcome numerous complex hurdles.
He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly affected by the decision or regulation.
The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as further appeal within the agency must have been exhausted.
Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Before you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to reconsider its action.
Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there must have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision to the full board.
The full board must rule against you, and only then will Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 202  you be heard by a court.
The broadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had no authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be impractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply.
Also, if the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion.
Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review Once these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims.
The appellant might assert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set down in the statute.
This attack is rarely successful.
A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency did not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act.
In formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the determination that it made.
If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court may reverse.
But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts.
Likewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority to do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it.
This is not a surprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations.
Nevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency.
In an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting through the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard limiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis.
A dozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 companies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the benefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose.
See Section 5.6 "Cases",American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan.
In summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) challenge agency action where such action is the following: • not in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 203  • not in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act • not in accordance with the substantial evidence test • unwarranted by the facts • arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord with the law Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets out those standards.
While it is difficult to show that an agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held.
For example, after the Reagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies challenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious.
Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that the agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record and the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal.
State Farm and other insurance companies thus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased passenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured.
[1] Suing the Government In the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative agencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise.
Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly legitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their bounds, in a fit of zeal or spite.
What recourse does the private individual or company have?
Mainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private individuals or corporations.
For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits.
Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative Procedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other nonmonetary relief.
Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign immunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains several exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of the Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime).
The act also contains a major Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 204  exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards for paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against officials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries following an explosion en route.
[2] In recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many government officials against personal suits.
Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, legislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions.
But many public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity.
Under a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in federal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his rights under the Constitution or federal law.
In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the Supreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights against an unlawful search of his home.
[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for violations of other constitutional provisions.
This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to continue to evolve.
Sometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous information.
For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a federal disability annuity.
Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him in each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job.
A few years later, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.
For many years, Charles earned considerably less than the ceiling amount.
But then one year he got the opportunity to make some extra money.
Not wishing to lose his pension, he called an employee relations specialist in the US Navy and asked how much he could earn and still keep his pension.
The specialist gave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said Charles could safely take on the extra work.
Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary limit, and so the government cut off his pension during the time he earned too much.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 205  Charles sues to recover his lost pension.
He argues that he relied to his detriment on false information supplied by the navy and that in fairness the government should be estopped from denying his claim.
Unfortunately for Charles, he will lose his case.
In Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, the Supreme Court reasoned that it would be unconstitutional to permit recovery.
[4] The appropriations clause of Article I says that federal money can be paid out only through an appropriation made by law.
The law prevented this particular payment to be made.
If the court were to make an exception, it would permit executive officials in effect to make binding payments, even though unauthorized, simply by misrepresenting the facts.
The harsh reality, therefore, is that mistakes of the government are generally held against the individual, not the government, unless the law specifically provides for recompense (as, for example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act just discussed).
KEY TAKEAWAY After exhausting administrative remedies, there are numerous grounds for seeking judicial review of an agency’s order or of a final rule.
While courts defer to agencies to some degree, an agency must follow its own rules, comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, act within the scope of its delegated authority, avoid acting in an arbitrary manner, and make final rules that are supported by substantial evidence.
EXERCISES 1.
Why would US courts require that someone seeking judicial review of an agency order first exhaust administrative remedies?

Section 8(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA or Act) empowers agents of the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to search the work area of any employment facility within the Act’s jurisdiction.
The purpose of the search is to inspect for safety hazards and violations of OSHA regulations.
No search warrant or other process is expressly required under the Act.
On the morning of September 11, 1975, an OSHA inspector entered the customer service area of Barlow’s, Inc., an electrical and plumbing installation business located in Pocatello, Idaho.
The president and general manager, Ferrol G. “Bill” Barlow, was on hand; and the OSHA inspector, after showing his credentials, informed Mr. Barlow that he wished to conduct a search of the working areas of the business.
Mr. Barlow inquired whether any complaint had been received about his company.
The inspector answered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process.
The inspector again asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the inspector had a search warrant.
The inspector had none.
Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of his business.
He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
Three months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to issue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector.
The requested order was issued on December 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976.
Mr. Barlow again refused admission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted by OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as private homes.
To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial experience.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 207  An important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point of contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution.
The particular offensiveness it engendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were inspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the colonists.… * * * This Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule applies to commercial premises as well as homes.
In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: [E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.
On the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is presumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant.
The businessman, like the occupant of a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official entries upon his private commercial property.
The businessman, too, has that right placed in jeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and enforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant.
These same cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches protects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations.
The reason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government intrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory standards.… [A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated business[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries “long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. 72, 74, 77 (1970).
These cases are indeed exceptions, but they Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 208  represent responses to relatively unique circumstances.
Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable expectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise.
Liquor (Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a business, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation.
* * * The clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved inColonnade and Biswell is the exception.
The Secretary would make it the rule.
Invoking the Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, 41 U.S.C.
§ 35 et seq., the Secretary attempts to support a conclusion that all businesses involved in interstate commerce have long been subjected to close supervision of employee safety and health conditions.
But…it is quite unconvincing to argue that the imposition of minimum wages and maximum hours on employers who contracted with the Government under the Walsh-Healey Act prepared the entirety of American interstate commerce for regulation of working conditions to the minutest detail.
Nor can any but the most fictional sense of voluntary consent to later searches be found in the single fact that one conducts a business affecting interstate commerce.
Under current practice and law, few businesses can be conducted without having some effect on interstate commerce.
* * * The critical fact in this case is that entry over Mr. Barlow’s objection is being sought by a Government agent.
Employees are not being prohibited from reporting OSHA violations.
What they observe in their daily functions is undoubtedly beyond the employer’s reasonable expectation of privacy.
The Government inspector, however, is not an employee.
Without a warrant he stands in no better position than a member of the public.
What is observable by the public is observable, without a warrant, by the Government inspector as well.
The owner of a business has not, by the necessary utilization of employees in his operation, thrown open the areas where employees alone are permitted to the warrantless scrutiny of Government agents.
That an employee is free to report, and the Government is free to use, any evidence of noncompliance with OSHA that the employee observes furnishes no justification for federal Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 209  agents to enter a place of business from which the public is restricted and to conduct their own warrantless search.
* * * [The District Court judgment is affirmed.]
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
State, as briefly and clearly as possible, the argument that Barlow’s is making in this case.
2.
Why would some industries or businesses be “closely regulated”?
What are some of those businesses?
3.
The Fourth Amendment speaks of “people” being secure in their “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” Why would the Fourth Amendment apply to a business, which is not in a “house”?
4.
If the Fourth Amendment does not distinguish between closely regulated industries and those that are not, why does the court do so?
American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan 452 U.S. 490 (1981) JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) “to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.…“The Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish, after notice and opportunity to comment, mandatory nationwide standards governing health and safety in the workplace.
In 1978, the Secretary, acting through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated a standard limiting occupational exposure to cotton dust, an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton products, exposure to which produces a “constellation of respiratory effects” known as “byssinosis.” This disease was one of the expressly recognized health hazards that led to passage of the Act.
Petitioners in these consolidated cases representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the “Cotton Dust Standard” in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit pursuant to § 6 (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.
§ 655 (f).
They contend in this Court, as Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 210  they did below, that the Act requires OSHA to demonstrate that its Standard reflects a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the Standard.
Respondents, the Secretary of Labor and two labor organizations, counter that Congress balanced the costs and benefits in the Act itself, and that the Act should therefore be construed not to require OSHA to do so.
They interpret the Act as mandating that OSHA enact the most protective standard possible to eliminate a significant risk of material health impairment, subject to the constraints of economic and technological feasibility.
The Court of Appeals held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits.
We granted certiorari, 449 U.S. 817 (1980), to resolve this important question, which was presented but not decided in last Term’s Industrial Union Dept.
v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607 (1980), and to decide other issues related to the Cotton Dust Standard.
* * * Not until the early 1960’s was byssinosis recognized in the United States as a distinct occupational hazard associated with cotton mills.
In 1966, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), a private organization, recommended that exposure to total cotton dust be limited to a “threshold limit value” of 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter of air (1,000 g/m3.)
averaged over an 8-hour workday.
See 43 Fed.
Reg.
27351, col. 1 (1978).
The United States Government first regulated exposure to cotton dust in 1968, when the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to the Walsh-Healey Act, 41 U.S.C.
35 (e), promulgated airborne contaminant threshold limit values, applicable to public contractors, that included the 1,000 g/m3 limit for total cotton dust.
34 Fed.
Reg.
7953 (1969).
Following passage of the Act in 1970, the 1,000 g/m3.
standard was adopted as an “established Federal standard” under 6 (a) of the Act, 84 Stat.
1593, 29 U.S.C.
655 (a), a provision designed to guarantee immediate protection of workers for the period between enactment of the statute and promulgation of permanent standards.
That same year, the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), pursuant to the Act, 29 U.S.C.
§§ 669(a)(3), 671 (d)(2), submitted to the Secretary of Labor a recommendation for a cotton dust standard with a permissible exposure limit (PEL) that “should be set at the lowest level feasible, but in no case at an environmental concentration Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 211  as high as 0.2 mg lint-free cotton dust/cu m,” or 200 g/m3.
of lint-free respirable dust.
Several months later, OSHA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 39 Fed.Reg.
44769 (1974), requesting comments from interested parties on the NIOSH recommendation and other related matters.
Soon thereafter, the Textile Worker’s Union of America, joined by the North Carolina Public Interest Research Group, petitioned the Secretary, urging a more stringent PEL of 100 g/m3.
On December 28, 1976, OSHA published a proposal to replace the existing federal standard on cotton dust with a new permanent standard, pursuant to § 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.
§ 655(b)(5).
41 Fed.Reg.
56498.
The proposed standard contained a PEL of 200 g/m3 of vertical elutriated lint-free respirable cotton dust for all segments of the cotton industry.
Ibid.
It also suggested an implementation strategy for achieving the PEL that relied on respirators for the short term and engineering controls for the long-term.
OSHA invited interested parties to submit written comments within a 90-day period.
* * * The starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute itself.
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.
§ 655(b)(5) (emphasis added), provides: The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life.
Although their interpretations differ, all parties agree that the phrase “to the extent feasible” contains the critical language in § 6(b)(5) for purposes of these cases.
The plain meaning of the word “feasible” supports respondents’ interpretation of the statute.
According to Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976), “feasible” means “capable of being done, executed, or effected.” In accord, the Oxford English Dictionary 116 (1933) (“Capable of being done, accomplished or carried out”); Funk & Wagnalls New “Standard” Dictionary of the English Language 903 (1957) (“That may be done, performed or effected”).
Thus, § 6(b)(5) directs the Secretary to issue the standard that “most adequately Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 212  assures…that no employee will suffer material impairment of health,” limited only by the extent to which this is “capable of being done.” In effect then, as the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits, by placing the “benefit” of worker health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this “benefit” unachievable.
Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that strikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth in § 6(b)(5).
Thus, cost-benefit analysis by OSHA is not required by the statute because feasibility analysis is.
When Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.
One early example is the Flood Control Act of 1936, 33 U.S.C.
§ 701: [T]he Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries, including watersheds thereof, for flood control purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected.
(emphasis added) A more recent example is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, providing that offshore drilling operations shall use the best available and safest technologies which the Secretary determines to be economically feasible, wherever failure of equipment would have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment, except where the Secretary determines that the incremental benefits are clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs of using such technologies.
These and other statutes demonstrate that Congress uses specific language when intending that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis.
Certainly in light of its ordinary meaning, the word “feasible” cannot be construed to articulate such congressional intent.
We therefore reject the argument that Congress required cost-benefit analysis in § 6(b)(5).
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
What is byssinosis?
Why should byssinosis be anything that the textile companies are responsible for, ethically or legally?
If it is well-known that textile workers get cotton dust in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 213  their systems and develop brown lung, don’t they nevertheless choose to work there and assume the risk of all injuries?
2.
By imposing costs on the textile industry, what will be the net effect on US textile manufacturing jobs?
3.
How is byssinosis a “negative externality” that is not paid for by either the manufacturer or the consumer of textile products?
How should the market, to be fair and efficient, adjust for these negative externalities other than by setting a reasonable standard that shares the burden between manufacturers and their employees?
Should all the burden be on the manufacturer?
5.7 Summary and Exercises Summary Administrative rules and regulations constitute the largest body of laws that directly affect business.
These regulations are issued by dozens of federal and state agencies that regulate virtually every aspect of modern business life, including the natural environment, corporate finance, transportation, telecommunications, energy, labor relations, and trade practices.
The administrative agencies derive their power to promulgate regulations from statutes passed by Congress or state legislatures.
The agencies have a variety of powers.
They can license companies to carry on certain activities or prohibit them from doing so, lay down codes of conduct, set rates that companies may charge for their services, and supervise various aspects of business.

Assume that the new president of the United States was elected overwhelmingly by pledging in his campaign to “do away with bureaucrats who interfere in your lives.” The day he takes the oath of office he determines to carry out his pledge.
Discuss which of the following courses he may lawfully follow: (a) Fire all incumbent commissioners of federal agencies in order to install new appointees.
(b) Demand that all pending regulations being considered by federal agencies be submitted to the White House for review and redrafting, if necessary.
(c) Interview potential nominees for agency positions to determine whether their regulatory philosophy is consistent with his.

Dewey owned a mine in Wisconsin.
He refused to allow Department of Labor agents into the mine to conduct warrantless searches to determine whether previously found safety violations had been corrected.
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977 authorizes four warrantless inspections per year.
Is the provision for warrantless inspections by this agency constitutional?

In determining the licensing requirements for nuclear reactors, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) adopted a zero-release assumption: that the permanent storage of certain nuclear waste would have no significant environmental impact and that potential storage leakages should not be a factor discussed in the appropriate environmental impact statement (EIS) required before permitting construction of a nuclear power plant.
This assumption is based on the NRC’s belief that technology would be developed to isolate the wastes from the environment, and it was clear from the record that the NRC had “digested a massive material and disclosed all substantial risks” and had considered that the zero-release assumption was uncertain.
There was a remote possibility of contamination by water leakage into the storage facility.
An environmental NGO sued, asserting that the NRC had violated the regulations governing the EIS by arbitrarily and capriciously ignoring the potential contamination.
The court of appeals agreed, and the power plant appealed.
Had the NRC acted arbitrarily and capriciously?

Chapter 6 Criminal Law LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Explain how criminal law differs from civil law.
2.
Categorize the various types of crimes and define the most serious felonies.
3.
Discuss and question the criminal “intent” of a corporation.
4.
Explain basic criminal procedure and the rights of criminal defendants.
At times, unethical behavior by businesspeople can be extreme enough that society will respond by criminalizing certain kinds of activities.
Ponzi schemes, arson, various kinds of fraud, embezzlement, racketeering, foreign corrupt practices, tax evasion, and insider trading are just a few.
A corporation can face large fines, and corporate managers can face both fines and jail sentences for violating criminal laws.
This chapter aims to explain how criminal law differs from civil law, to discuss various types of crimes, and to relate the basic principles of criminal procedure.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 217  6.1 The Nature of Criminal Law Criminal law is the most ancient branch of the law.
Many wise observers have tried to define and explain it, but the explanations often include many complex and subtle distinctions.
A traditional criminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal versus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused.
But in this chapter, we will consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights.
Unlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes involve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state government).
This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain individuals.
But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself.
For example, two friends of yours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and immediately goes home.
The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one else knows about the fight and the friends later make up.
By contrast, suppose a major corporation publicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to Southeast Asia.
There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the place of the company’s jobs.
Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only the first example is a crime.
Crimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the nature of the conduct they wish to criminalize.
For government punishment to be fair, citizens must have clear notice of what is criminally prohibited.
Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to punish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution.
Overly vague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for vagueness.” What is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time.
For example, while cocaine use was legal in the United States at one time, it is now a controlled substance, and unauthorized use is now a crime.
Medical marijuana was not legal fifty years ago when its use began to become widespread, and in some states its use or possession was a felony.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 218  Now, some states make it legal to use or possess it under some circumstances.
In the United States, you can criticize and make jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many countries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official.
Attitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation.
Uganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders.
In Saudi Arabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally assaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis.
Limits on punishment are set in the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” It is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse.
But there are far too many criminal laws for anyone to know them all.
Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of “criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving without a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society.
You might even argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself!
The usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society (through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you.
Still, you may ask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt?
Isn’t this a victimless crime?
Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your injuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice may actually impose costs on society.
For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a public hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been avoided by your use of a seat belt.
But, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws.
Teenagers hanging around the sidewalks on Main Street were sometimes arrested for “loitering.” The constitutional void-for-vagueness doctrine has led the courts to overturn statutes that are not clear.
For example, “vagrancy” was long held to be a crime, but US courts began some forty years ago to overturn vagrancy and “suspicious person” statutes on the grounds that they are too vague for people to know what they are being asked not to do.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 219  This requirement that criminal statutes not be vague does not mean that the law always defines crimes in ways that can be easily and clearly understood.
Many statutes use terminology developed by the common-law courts.
For example, a California statute defines murder as “the unlawful killing of a human being, with malice aforethought.” If no history backed up these words, they would be unconstitutionally vague.
But there is a rich history of judicial decisions that provides meaning for much of the arcane language like “malice aforethought” strewn about in the statute books.
Because a crime is an act that the legislature has defined as socially harmful, the parties involved cannot agree among themselves to forget a particular incident, such as a barroom brawl, if the authorities decide to prosecute.
This is one of the critical distinctions between criminal and civil law.
An assault is both a crime and a tort.
The person who was assaulted may choose to forgive his assailant and not to sue him for damages.
But he cannot stop the prosecutor from bringing an indictment against the assailant.
(However, because of crowded dockets, a victim that declines to press charges may cause a busy prosecutor to choose to not to bring an indictment.)
A crime consists of an act defined as criminal—an actus reus—and the requisite “criminal intent.” Someone who has a burning desire to kill a rival in business or romance and who may actually intend to murder but does not act on his desire has not committed a crime.
He may have a “guilty mind”—the translation of the Latin phrase mens rea—but he is guilty of no crime.
A person who is forced to commit a crime at gunpoint is not guilty of a crime, because although there was an act defined as criminal—an actus reus—there was no criminal intent.
KEY TAKEAWAY Crimes are usually defined by statute and constitute an offense against society.
In each case, there must be both an act and some mens rea (criminal intent).
EXERCISES 1.
Other than deterring certain kinds of conduct, what purpose does the criminal law serve?
2.
Why is ignorance of the law no excuse?
Why shouldn’t it be an excuse, when criminal laws can be complicated and sometimes ambiguous?
6.2 Types of Crimes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 220  LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Categorize various types of crimes.
2.
Name and define the major felonies in criminal law.
3.
Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes.
4.
Define a variety of white-collar crimes.
Most classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act.
In general, seriousness is defined by the nature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute.
A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by imprisonment of more than one year or by death.
(Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as capital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.)
The major felonies include murder, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering.
All other crimes are usually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions.
Another way of viewing crimes is by the type of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, offenses against property, and white-collar crime.
Offenses against the Person Homicide Homicide is the killing of one person by another.
Not every killing is criminal.
When the law permits one person to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in self-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide.
An excusable homicide, by contrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault.
All other homicides are criminal.
The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide committed with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history.
Boiled down to its essentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill.
A killing need not be premeditated for any long period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that moment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill.
Sometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily harm can be murder if the result is the death of another person.
A killing that takes place Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 221  while a felony (such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm.
This is the so-called felony murder rule.
Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an innocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an arsonist.
The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the accomplices of one who does the killing.
Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the scene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and someone is killed.
Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder.
Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of some provocation.
An example is a fight that gets out of hand.
Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser degree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death (e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light).
Assault and Battery Ordinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him.
Technically, that is a battery—the unlawful application of force to another person.
The force need not be violent.
Indeed, a man who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will.
The other person may consent to the force.
That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor permission to operate.
In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery.
That is also why football players are not constantly being charged with battery.
Those who agree to play football agree to submit to the rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle.
But the consent does not apply to all acts of physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for the crime of battery.
Criminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of receiving an immediate battery.
If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have committed an assault.
Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a “present ability” to do so.
Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, of course, could it be a battery.
The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to commit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 222  Assault and battery may be excused.
For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use reasonable force to remove an unruly patron.
If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found guilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well.
Offenses against Property Theft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses The concept of theft is familiar enough.
Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the act of stealing.
Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft.
Many technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used inaccurately.
Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here.
The basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny.
By its old common-law definition, still in use today, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to steal the same.” The separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases.
Take the theft of fruit, for example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an orchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away personal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree).
But if he picks up a peach lying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny.
Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” Sneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal act).
Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled judges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can be taken.
Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny.
Or consider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his permission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do return it, you have not committed larceny.
But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you to take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 223  A particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence or intimidation.
Larceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another.
Suppose that a person legitimately comes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile mechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary possession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him.
The common law had trouble with such cases because the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership.
Today, such wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states.
Statutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law.
A conceptual problem arises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property.
In larceny and embezzlement, the thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property.
Suppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in.
The customer says that he has full title to the car.
In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan and the finance company has an interest in the old car.
If the finance company repossesses the car, the customer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have taken the new car by larceny or embezzlement.
Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the dealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car.
Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; the statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining ownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud.
A number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes.
One concerns whether the taking is permanent or only temporary.
The case ofState v. Mills (Section 6.7 "Cases") shows the subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” In the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used instead for another.
This is a false representation of fact.
Suppose, by contrast, that a person misrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 224  well that he does not intend to.
Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense?
In most jurisdictions it cannot.
A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a statement of intention.
If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal prosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks.
The problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of another without paying.
A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal.
In most states, this is specifically defined in the statutes as theft of services.
Receiving Stolen Property One who engages in receiving stolen property with knowledge that it is stolen is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property.
The receipt need not be personal; if the property is delivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then he is deemed to have received it.
“Knowledge” is construed broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and suspicion (strong enough not to investigate for fear that the property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for conviction.
Forgery Forgery is false writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance!)
with intent to defraud.
It includes the making up of a false document or the alteration of an existing one.
The writing need not be done by hand but can be by any means—typing, printing, and so forth.
Documents commonly the subject of forgery are negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like), deeds, receipts, contracts, and bills of lading.
The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood.
If you fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery.
But if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your checking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to defraud.
The mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful.
So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an instrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it.
The usual example of a false signature is by no means the only way to commit forgery.
If done with intent to defraud, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 225  the backdating of a document, the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines left blank on a form can all constitute forgery.
Extortion Under common law, extortion could only be committed by a government official, who corruptly collected an unlawful fee under color of office.
A common example is a salaried building inspector who refuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him.
Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has been broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by means of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the demand an act of robbery).
This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail.
The blackmail threat commonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him.
Offenses against Habitation and Other Offenses Burglary Burglary is not a crime against property.
It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who sneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out the act.
The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room for argument.
What is “breaking”?
(The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a closed door, even if unlocked, is enough.)
What is entry?
When does night begin?
What kind of intent?
Whose dwelling?
Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant?
(Yes.)
Can a person burglarize his own home?
(No.)
Arson Under common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another.
Burning one’s own house for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law.
The statutes today make it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not the purpose is to collect insurance.
Bribery Bribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action.
The payment can be in cash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 226  valuable.
Under common law, only a public official could be bribed.
In most states, bribery charges can result from the bribe of anyone performing a public function.
Bribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges.
Bribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Perjury Perjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official proceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”).
To be perjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without sincere belief that it was true.
An innocent mistake is not perjury.
A statement, though true, is perjury if the maker of it believes it to be false.
Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my knowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury.
To support a charge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant to whatever the court is trying to find out.
White-Collar Crime White-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried out in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business.
Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, but embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is.
Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory definitions of embezzlement and false pretenses.
Most are violations of state law.
Depending on how they are carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law.
Any act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls or Internet connections is a violation of federal law.
Likewise, many different acts around the buying and selling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws.
Other white- collar crimes include tax fraud; price fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; and—the newest form—computer fraud.
Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later chapters.
Mail and Wire Fraud Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 227  Federal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the purpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for prosecutors to prove a violation.
The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show that the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses.
“Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who uses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be convicted under the law.
In one case, a state governor was convicted of mail fraud when he took bribes to influence the setting of racing dates.
The court’s theory was that he defrauded the citizenry of its right to his “honest and faithful services” as governor.
[1] Violations of the Food and Drug Act The federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any person or corporation from sending into interstate commerce any adulterated or misbranded food, drug, cosmetics, or related device.
For example, in a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a use that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Unlike most criminal statutes, willfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act.
As the United States v. Park case (Section 6.7 "Cases") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no personal knowledge of the violation.
Environmental Crimes Many federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions.
These include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); the Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
Under the Clean Water Act, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from $2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year.
“Responsible corporate officers” are specifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act.
They can include officers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused the discharge.
[2] Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 228  Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act As a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign governments to win contracts with those governments.
Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately and fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records.
The act also made illegal the payment of bribes to foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the one offering and delivering the money) in getting business.
Violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act In 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at ending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business.
The act tells courts to construe its language broadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been successfully prosecuted under the act.
It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at least two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and securities fraud.
The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties.
Computer Crime Computer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or property; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of information.
The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 "Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act").
Congress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where computers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature.
Table 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 10 years maximum (20 years second Obtaining national security information Sec.
(a)(1) offense) Trespassing in a government computer Sec.
(a)(3) 1 year (5) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 229  Compromising the confidentiality of a computer Sec.

6.3 The Nature of a Criminal Act LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how it is possible to commit a criminal act without actually doing anything that you think might be criminal.
2.
Analyze and explain the importance of intention in criminal law and criminal prosecutions.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 230  3.
Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the crime.
To be guilty of a crime, you must have acted.
Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient.
But what constitutes an act?
This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or does so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else.
Attempt It is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense.
An attempt to commit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely.
For example, Brett points a gun at Ashley, intending to shoot her dead.
He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four feet.
He is guilty of an attempt to murder.
Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was preparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his intention, and that a neighbor called the police.
When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his shoulder holster.
At that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed beyond the stage of preparation.
After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the gun away.
Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step toward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide.
Impossibility What if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible?
For example, suppose that men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted rape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the time sexual intercourse took place?
Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with strychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead?
The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, but the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of poison).
States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense to the crime of attempt.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 231  Legal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense.
If the defendant completes all of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a successful “impossibility” defense.
If Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it is his neighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed an attempt?
Many courts would hold that he has not.
But the distinction between factual impossibility and legal impossibility is not always clear, and the trend seems to be to punish the intended attempt.
Conspiracy Under both federal and state laws, it is a separate offense to work with others toward the commission of a crime.
When two or more people combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, they are engaged in a conspiracy.
The law of conspiracy is quite broad, especially when it is used by prosecutors in connection with white-collar crimes.
Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary to show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt.
Usually, the prosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
Thus if three people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store to purchase a gun to be used in the holdup, the three can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Even the purchase of an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a conspiracy conviction.
The act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the other members of the conspiracy.
It does not matter, for instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that killed a guard.
All can be convicted of murder.
That is so even if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several blocks away and even if he specifically told the others that his agreement to cooperate would end “just as soon as there is shooting.” Agency and Corporations A person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another.
Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the guilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy.
But imputation of guilt is not limited to a conspiracy.
The agent may be innocent even though he participates.
A corporate officer directs a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home.
The employee reasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 232  Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains money that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it.
This is not a conspiracy.
The employee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him.
Since intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the principal did not share the intent.
The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our biggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest customer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the purchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he signs a new contract.
The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could not.
Can a corporation be guilty of a crime?
For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be imputed to the corporation.
Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be convicted and fined for violations by employees.
This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who ultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop it.
The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years.
The tendency is to hold the corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group within the corporation (the president or board of directors).
KEY TAKEAWAY Although proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by inference (circumstantially).
Conspirators may not actually commit a crime, for example, but in preparing for a criminal act, they may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy.
Certain corporate officers, as well, may not be directly committing criminal acts but may be held criminally responsible for acts of their agents and contractors.
EXERCISES 1.
Give an example of how someone can intend to commit a crime but fail to commit one.
2.
Describe a situation where there is a conspiracy to commit a crime without the crime actually taking place.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 233  3.
Create a scenario based on current events where a corporation could be found guilty of committing a crime even though the CEO, the board of directors, and the shareholders have not themselves done a criminal act.
6.4 Responsibility LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain why criminal law generally requires that the defendant charged with a crime have criminal "intent."
2.
Know and explain the possible excuses relating to responsibility that are legally recognized by courts, including lack of capacity.
In General The mens rea requirement depends on the nature of the crime and all the circumstances surrounding the act.
In general, though, the requirement means that the accused must in some way have intended the criminal consequences of his act.
Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to swallow.
That is the act.
If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder?
The answer depends on what his state of mind was.
Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder.
What if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her mildly ill?
The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that may cause harm to others.
But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two pills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) but that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of knowledge from which intent could be inferred.
Not every criminal law requires criminal intent as an ingredient of the crime.
Many regulatory codes dealing with the public health and safety impose strict requirements.
Failure to adhere to such requirements is a violation, whether or not the violator had mens rea.
The United States v. Park case, Section 6.7 "Cases", a decision of the US Supreme Court, shows the different considerations involved in mens rea.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 234  Excuses That Limit or Overcome Responsibility Mistake of Fact and Mistake of Law Ordinarily, ignorance of the law is not an excuse.
If you believe that it is permissible to turn right on a red light but the city ordinance prohibits it, your belief, even if reasonable, does not excuse your violation of the law.
Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused.
If a statute imposes criminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and if the government official responsible for issuing the license formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you do), a conviction for violating the statute cannot stand.
In rare cases, a lawyer’s advice, contrary to the statute, will be held to excuse the client, but usually the client is responsible for his attorney’s mistakes.
Otherwise, as it is said, the lawyer would be superior to the law.
Ignorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as an excuse.
If you take a coat from a restaurant, believing it to be yours, you cannot be convicted of larceny if it is not.
Your honest mistake of fact negates the requisite intent.
In general, the rule is that a mistaken belief of fact will excuse criminal responsibility if (1) the belief is honestly held, (2) it is reasonable to hold it, and (3) the act would not have been criminal if the facts were as the accused supposed them to have been.
Entrapment One common technique of criminal investigation is the use of an undercover agent or decoy—the policeman who poses as a buyer of drugs from a street dealer or the elaborate “sting” operations in which ostensibly stolen goods are “sold” to underworld “fences.” Sometimes these methods are the only way by which certain kinds of crime can be rooted out and convictions secured.
But a rule against entrapment limits the legal ability of the police to play the role of criminals.
The police are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to instigate crime.
The distinction is usually made between a person who intends to commit a crime and one who does not.
If the police provide the former with an opportunity to commit a criminal act—the sale of drugs to an undercover agent, for example— there is no defense of entrapment.
But if the police knock on the door of one not known to be a drug user and persist in a demand that he purchase drugs from them, finally overcoming his will Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 235  to resist, a conviction for purchase and possession of drugs can be overturned on the ground of entrapment.
Other Excuses A number of other circumstances can limit or excuse criminal liability.
These include compulsion (a gun pointed at one’s head by a masked man who apparently is unafraid to use the weapon and who demands that you help him rob a store), honest consent of the “victim” (the quarterback who is tackled), adherence to the requirements of legitimate public authority lawfully exercised (a policeman directs a towing company to remove a car parked in a tow-away zone), the proper exercise of domestic authority (a parent may spank a child, within limits), and defense of self, others, property, and habitation.
Each of these excuses is a complex subject in itself.
Lack of Capacity A further defense to criminal prosecution is the lack of mental capacity to commit the crime.
Infants and children are considered incapable of committing a crime; under common law any child under the age of seven could not be prosecuted for any act.
That age of incapacity varies from state to state and is now usually defined by statutes.
Likewise, insanity or mental disease or defect can be a complete defense.
Intoxication can be a defense to certain crimes, but the mere fact of drunkenness is not ordinarily sufficient.
KEY TAKEAWAY In the United States, some crimes can be committed by not following strict regulatory requirements for health, safety, or the environment.
The law does provide excuses from criminal liability for mistakes of fact, entrapment, and lack of capacity.
EXERCISES 1.
Describe several situations in which compulsion, consent, or other excuses take away criminal liability.
2.
Your employee is drunk on the job and commits the crime of assault and battery on a customer.
He claims lack of capacity as an excuse.
Should the courts accept this excuse?
Why or why not?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 236  6.5 Procedure LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the basic steps in pretrial criminal procedure that follow a government's determination to arrest someone for an alleged criminal act.
2.
Describe the basic elements of trial and posttrial criminal procedure.
The procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex.
Procedures will vary from state to state.
A criminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if the defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue.
The warrant is issued by a judge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the accused.
It is not enough for a police officer to go before a judge and say, “I’d like you to arrest Bonnie because I think she’s just murdered Clyde.” She must supply enough information to satisfy the magistrate that there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the accused committed the crime.
The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the accused with warrant in hand.
The accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing.
The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial.
If so, the accused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail.
Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to secure the defendant’s attendance at trial.
If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money.
Constitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the jurisdiction.
Once the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor.
In the fifty states, prosecution is a function of the district attorney’s office.
These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county basis.
In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of whom is appointed for every federal district.
Following the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document stating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask thegrand jury for an indictment.
The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution.
It does not sit to determine guilt or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 237  innocence.
The indictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried.
If indicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant.
The defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the indictment.
The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty.
If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried before a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury).
The jury cannot convict unless it finds the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a “lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery because the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim).
Such a plea is usually arranged throughplea bargaining with the prosecution.
In return for the plea, the prosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited.
The judge most often, but not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation.
The defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for certain crimes.
In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt.
He may be sentenced as though he had pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain.
Why plead nolo?
In some offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may use a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law.
This enables a plaintiff to prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing about the damages to plaintiff.
The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff will have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability.
Following a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing reports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers).
Permissible sentences are spelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., twenty years to life).
The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may decide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays out of trouble).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 238  Sentencing usually comes before appeal.
As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right to take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may be argued.
KEY TAKEAWAY Criminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to society.
The grand jury system, prosecutorial discretion, plea bargains, and appeals for lack of a fair trial are all part of US criminal procedure.
EXERCISES 1.
Harold is charged with the crime of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflict serious bodily injury.
It is a more serious crime than simple assault.
Harold’s attorney wants the prosecutor to give Harold a break, but Harold is guilty of at least simple assault and may also have had the intent to kill.
What is Harold’s attorney likely to do?
2.
Kumar was driving his car, smoking marijuana, and had an accident with another vehicle.
The other driver was slightly injured.
When the officer arrived, she detected a strong odor of marijuana in Kumar’s car and a small amount of marijuana in the glove compartment.
The other driver expects to bring a civil action against Kumar for her injuries after Kumar’s criminal case.
What should Kumar plead in the criminal case—careless driving or driving under the influence?
6.6 Constitutional Rights of the Accused LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the most significant constitutional rights of defendants in US courts, and name the source of these rights.
2.
Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence.
Search and Seizure The rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that make up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight).
For the most part, these amendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments.
The Fourth Amendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 239  be violated.” Although there are numerous and tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or confiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so.
This means, for instance, that a policeman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the police enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime.
What if the police do search or seize unreasonably?
The courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure.
Evidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial.
This is the so-called exclusionary rule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961.
The exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.
But it remains generally true that the prosecutor may not use evidence willfully taken by the police in violation of constitutional rights generally, and most often in the violation of Fourth Amendment rights.
(The fruits of a coerced confession are also excluded.)
Double Jeopardy The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from prosecuting a person twice for the same offense.
The amendment says that no person shall be “subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” If a defendant is acquitted, the government may not appeal.
If a defendant is convicted and his conviction is upheld on appeal, he may not thereafter be reprosecuted for the same crime.
Self-Incrimination The Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person’s right against self-incrimination (no person “shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”).
The debate over the limits of this right has given rise to an immense literature.
In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means that the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the jury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand.
Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded from evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession).
In Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that no confession is admissible if the police have not first advised a suspect of his constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer present to advise him Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 240  during the questioning.
[1] These so-called Miranda warnings have prompted scores of follow-up cases that have made this branch of jurisprudence especially complex.
Speedy Trial The Sixth Amendment tells the government that it must try defendants speedily.
How long a delay is too long depends on the circumstances in each case.
In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give priority to criminal cases in federal courts.
It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within seventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay).
Cross-Examination The Sixth Amendment also says that the defendant shall have the right to confront witnesses against him.
No testimony is permitted to be shown to the jury unless the person making it is present and subject to cross-examination by the defendant’s counsel.
Assistance of Counsel The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to have the assistance of defense counsel.
During the eighteenth century and before, the British courts frequently refused to permit defendants to have lawyers in the courtroom during trial.
The right to counsel is much broader in this country, as the result of Supreme Court decisions that require the state to pay for a lawyer for indigent defendants in most criminal cases.
Cruel and Unusual Punishment Punishment under the common law was frequently horrifying.
Death was a common punishment for relatively minor crimes.
In many places throughout the world, punishments still persist that seem cruel and unusual, such as the practice of stoning someone to death.
The guillotine, famously in use during and after the French Revolution, is no longer used, nor are defendants put in stocks for public display and humiliation.
In pre-Revolutionary America, an unlucky defendant who found himself convicted could face brutal torture before death.
The Eighth Amendment banned these actions with the words that “cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted.” Virtually all such punishments either never were enacted or have been eliminated from the statute books in the United States.
Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has become a source of controversy, first with the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 241  that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied in the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.
Later Supreme Court opinions have made it easier for states to administer the death penalty.
As of 2010, there were 3,300 defendants on death row in the United States.
Of course, no corporation is on death row, and no corporation’s charter has ever been revoked by a US state, even though some corporations have repeatedly been indicted and convicted of criminal offenses.
Presumption of Innocence The most important constitutional right in the US criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned lower courts in the United States that juries must be properly instructed that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty.
This is the origin of the “beyond all reasonable doubt” standard of proof and is an instruction given to juries in each criminal case.
The Fifth Amendment notes the right of “due process” in federal proceedings, and the Fourteenth Amendment requires that each state provide “due process” to defendants.
KEY TAKEAWAY The US Constitution provides several important protections for criminal defendants, including a prohibition on the use of evidence that has been obtained by unconstitutional means.
This would include evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment and confessions obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
EXERCISES 1.
Do you think it is useful to have a presumption of innocence in criminal cases?
What if there were not a presumption of innocence in criminal cases?
2.
Do you think public humiliation, public execution, and unusual punishments would reduce the amount of crime?
Why do you think so?
3.
“Due process” is another phrase for “fairness.” Why should the public show fairness toward criminal defendants?

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 242  6.7 Cases False Pretenses State v. Mills 96 Ariz. 377, 396 P.2d 5 (Ariz. 1964) LOCKWOOD, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE Defendants appeal from a conviction on two counts of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of AR.S.
§§ 13-661.A3.
and 13-663.A1.
The material facts, viewed “…in the light most favorable to sustaining the conviction,” are as follows: Defendant William Mills was a builder and owned approximately 150 homes in Tucson in December, 1960.
Mills conducted his business in his home.
In 1960 defendant Winifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and receiving clients who came to the office.
In December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and another at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house.
Pivowar did not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction.
Later in the same month Nathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 on the two houses.
Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes again.
Mills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar.
Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office Mrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation.
After the mortgages had been recorded on December 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage formerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000.
In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two personal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan.
Although the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did not present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them.
In 1962 the complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not first mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties.
These mortgages actually covered two vacant lots on which there were outstanding Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 243  senior mortgages.
On learning this, Pivowar signed a complaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses.
On appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the information.
They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the crime of theft.
Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert that complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently.
Defendants misconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses.
Stated in a different form, their argument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second mortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan.
Defendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction.
Respectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit.
A creditor has a right to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor.
In the former case, he has a right to know about the security.
If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is falsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt.
His position is now that of an unsecured creditor.
At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been forced upon him by reason of the deceit.
This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed upon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud.
* * * The cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in that they involved theft by larceny.
Since the crime of larceny is designed to protect a person’s possessory interest in property whereas the crime of false pretenses protects one’s title interest, the requirement of a permanent deprivation is appropriate to the former.
Accordingly, we hold that an intent to repay a loan obtained on the basis of a false representation of the security for the loan is no defense.
* * * Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing.
CASE QUESTIONS Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 244  1.

Concisely state the defendant’s argument as to why Pivowar has not been deprived of any property.
3.
If Pivowar had presented the notes and Mills had paid, would a crime have been committed?
White-Collar Crimes United States v. Park 421 U.S. 658 (1975) MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted certiorari to consider whether the jury instructions in the prosecution of a corporate officer under § 301 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat.
1042, as amended, 21 U.S.C.
§ 331 (k), were appropriate under United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943).
Acme Markets, Inc., is a national retail food chain with approximately 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets, 12 general warehouses, and four special warehouses.
Its headquarters, including the office of the president, respondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In a five-count information filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Each count of the information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been shipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore warehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to rodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents.
These acts were alleged to have resulted in the food’s being adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.
§§ 342 (a)(3) and (4), in violation of 21 U.S.C.
§ 331 (k).
Acme pleaded guilty to each count of the information.
Respondent pleaded not guilty.
The evidence at trial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by letter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse.
In 1971 the FDA found that similar conditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse.
An FDA Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 245  consumer safety officer testified concerning evidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of the Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971.
He also related that a second inspection of the warehouse had been conducted in March 1972.
On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been improvement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building and in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.” The Government also presented testimony by the Chief of Compliance of the FDA’s Baltimore office, who informed respondent by letter of the conditions at the Baltimore warehouse after the first inspection.
There was testimony by Acme’s Baltimore division vice president, who had responded to the letter on behalf of Acme and respondent and who described the steps taken to remedy the insanitary conditions discovered by both inspections.
The Government’s final witness, Acme’s vice president for legal affairs and assistant secretary, identified respondent as the president and chief executive officer of the company and read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chief executive officer.
He testified that respondent functioned by delegating “normal operating duties” including sanitation, but that he retained “certain things, which are the big, broad, principles of the operation of the company and had “the responsibility of seeing that they all work together.” At the close of the Government’s case in chief, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that “the evidence in chief has shown that Mr. Park is not personally concerned in this Food and Drug violation.” The trial judge denied the motion, stating that United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943), was controlling.
Respondent was the only defense witness.
He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a sense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for certain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, in turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for sanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice president for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating the situation immediately and would be taking corrective action and would be preparing a summary of the corrective action to reply to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 246  the letter.” Respondent stated that he did not “believe there was anything [he] could have done more constructively than what [he] found was being done.” On cross-examination, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to the public was something that he was “responsible for in the entire operation of the company” and he stated that it was one of many phases of the company that he assigned to “dependable subordinates.” Respondent was asked about and, over the objections of his counsel, admitted receiving, the April 1970 letter addressed to him from the FDA regarding insanitary conditions at Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse.
He acknowledged that, with the exception of the division vice president, the same individuals had responsibility for sanitation in both Baltimore and Philadelphia.
Finally, in response to questions concerning the Philadelphia and Baltimore incidents, respondent admitted that the Baltimore problem indicated the system for handling sanitation “wasn’t working perfectly” and that as Acme’s chief executive officer he was “responsible for any result which occurs in our company.” At the close of the evidence, respondent’s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied.
The relevant portion of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury challenged by respondent is set out in the margin.
Respondent’s counsel objected to the instructions on the ground that they failed fairly to reflect our decision in United States v. Dotterweich supra, and to define “‘responsible relationship.’” The trial judge overruled the objection.
The jury found respondent guilty on all counts of the information, and he was subsequently sentenced to pay a fine of $50 on each count.
The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial.
* * * The question presented by the Government’s petition for certiorari in United States v. Dotterweich, and the focus of this Court’s opinion, was whether the manager of a corporation, as well as the corporation itself, may be prosecuted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 for the introduction of misbranded and adulterated articles into interstate commerce.
In Dotterweich, a jury had disagreed as to the corporation, a jobber purchasing drugs from manufacturers and shipping them in interstate commerce under its own label, but had convicted Dotterweich, the corporation’s president and general manager.
The Court of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 247  Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that only the drug dealer, whether corporation or individual, was subject to the criminal provisions of the Act, and that where the dealer was a corporation, an individual connected therewith might be held personally only if he was operating the corporation as his ‘alter ego.’ In reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstating Dotterweich’s conviction, this Court looked to the purposes of the Act and noted that they “touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self- protection.
It observed that the Act is of “a now familiar type” which “dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct-awareness of some wrongdoing: In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.
Central to the Court’s conclusion that individuals other than proprietors are subject to the criminal provisions of the Act was the reality that the only way in which a corporation can act is through the individuals, who act on its behalf.
* * * The Court recognized that, because the Act dispenses with the need to prove “consciousness of wrongdoing,” it may result in hardship even as applied to those who share “responsibility in the business process resulting in” a violation.…The rule that corporate employees who have “a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws” are subject to the criminal provisions of the Act was not formulated in a vacuum.
Cf.
Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 258 (1952).
Cases under the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 reflected the view both that knowledge or intent were not required to be proved in prosecutions under its criminal provisions, and that responsible corporate agents could be subjected to the liability thereby imposed.
* * * The rationale of the interpretation given the Act in Dotterweich…has been confirmed in our subsequent cases.
Thus, the Court has reaffirmed the proposition that the public interest in the purity of its food is so great as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 248  Thus Dotterweich and the cases which have followed reveal that in providing sanctions which reach and touch the individuals who execute the corporate mission—and this is by no means necessarily confined to a single corporate agent or employee—the Act imposes not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy violations when they occur but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that violations will not occur.
The requirements of foresight and vigilance imposed on responsible corporate agents are beyond question demanding, and perhaps onerous, but they are no more stringent than the public has a right to expect of those who voluntarily assume positions of authority in business enterprises whose services and products affect the health and well-being of the public that supports them.
* * * Reading the entire charge satisfies us that the jury’s attention was adequately focused on the issue of respondent’s authority with respect to the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations.
Viewed as a whole, the charge did not permit the jury to find guilt solely on the basis of respondent’s position in the corporation; rather, it fairly advised the jury that to find guilt it must find respondent “had a responsible relation to the situation,” and “by virtue of his position…had…authority and responsibility” to deal with the situation.
The situation referred to could only be “food…held in unsanitary conditions in a warehouse with the result that it consisted, in part, of filth or…may have been contaminated with filth.” Our conclusion that the Court of Appeals erred in its reading of the jury charge suggests as well our disagreement with that court concerning the admissibility of evidence demonstrating that respondent was advised by the FDA in 1970 of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse.
We are satisfied that the Act imposes the highest standard of care and permits conviction of responsible corporate officials who, in light of this standard of care, have the power to prevent or correct violations of its provisions.
* * * Reversed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Did Park have criminal intent to put adulterated food into commerce?
If not, how can Park’s conduct be criminalized?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 249  2.
To get a conviction, what does the prosecutor have to show, other than that Park was the CEO of Acme and therefore responsible for what his company did or didn’t do?
6.8 Summary and Exercises Summary Criminal law is that branch of law governing offenses against society.
Most criminal law requires a specific intent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern legislation, dispense with the requirement of intent).
In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil law—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in liability.
Major crimes are known as felonies.
Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors.
Most people have a general notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft.
But conventional knowledge does not suffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false pretenses.
These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for committing one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit such an act.
It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main crime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put him into serious trouble.
Of major concern to the business executive is white-collar crime, which encompasses a host of offenses, including bribery, embezzlement, fraud, restraints of trade, and computer crime.
Anyone accused of crime should know that they always have the right to consult with a lawyer and should always do so.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 253  Chapter 7 Introduction to Tort Law LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: 1.
Know why most legal systems have tort law.
2.
Identify the three kinds of torts.
3.
Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law.
4.
Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence.
5.
Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system.
In civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous.
The law attempts to adjust for harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant was the cause of the plaintiff’s losses.
Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability torts.
Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in tort.
This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims.
7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain why a sound market system requires tort law.
2.
Define a tort and give two examples.
3.
Explain the moral basis of tort liability.
4.
Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort.
Definition of Tort The term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong.
The word tort is also derived from the Latin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which means straight (rectitude uses that Latin root).
Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is a tort.
The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 254  Long ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system.
A judge will instruct a jury that a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of money damages.
The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal the underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere.
Hurting someone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet the law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a remedy for "defaming" someone, orally or in writing, to others.
Although the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines.
More and more people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the courts).
Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, against newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire ecosystems.
All are examples of tort suits.
The law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by legislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on.
Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the common law (judicial decisions).
Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules that govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other.
Through contracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other.
In the absence of contracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions.
Those who suffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated.
Many acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious.
But torts and crimes are different, and the difference is worth noting.
A crime is an act against the people as a whole.
Society punishes the murderer; it does not usually compensate the family of the victim.
Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a private wrong for which damages are owed.
In a civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, brings the action.
The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit is usually expressed in monetary terms, not in terms of prison times or fines, and is the legal system’s way of trying to make up for the victim’s loss.
Kinds of Torts Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 255  There are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts.
Intentional torts arise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a surgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished).
Both intentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant.
In strict liability torts, by contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for the victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm.
Dimensions of Tort Liability There is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless (negligent) or has intentionally caused harm.
Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings with basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will usually react negatively.
As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” The law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging your arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual touching (battery).
Under a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities.
That is, actions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties.
The law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a money judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim.
Figure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 256  Dimensions of Tort: Fault Tort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.
One is the fault dimension.
Like criminal law, tort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover.
Unlike criminal law, however, there need not be a specific intent.
Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than criminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions.
An innocent act or a relatively innocent one may still provide the basis for liability.
Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on standards of fault, or blameworthiness.
The most obvious standard is willful conduct.
If the defendant (often called thetortfeasor—i.e., the one committing the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability.
Thus all crimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.)
are also torts, and the plaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 257  Most tort suits do not rely on intentional fault.
They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the circumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage.
Most automobile accident and medical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits.
The fault dimension is a continuum.
At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury.
The middle ground is occupied by careless conduct.
At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in the moral sense.
The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable.
This is calledstrict liability.
An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that is placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection.
In many states, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable.
Dimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury Tort liability varies by the type of injury caused.
The most obvious type is physical harm to the person (assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) or property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract).
Mental suffering can be redressed if it is a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident).
A few states now permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while both were crossing the street).
Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by defamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and economic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair competition).
Dimensions of Tort: Excuses A third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong.
The law does not condemn every act that ultimately results in injury.
One common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk.
A baseball fan who sits along the third base line close to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him.
He will not be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management should have either warned him or put up a protective barrier.
Another excuse is negligence of the plaintiff.
If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, some states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other.
Still another excuse Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 258  is consent: two boxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear).
Damages Since the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually measured by the extent of the injury.
Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property destroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are supposed to approximate the pain that is suffered.
Damages for these injuries are called compensatory damages.
In certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages.
As the word punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions.
Because a punitive award (sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only in aggravated situations.
The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the defendant has deliberately committed a wrong with malicious intent or has otherwise done something outrageous.
Punitive damages are rarely allowed in negligence cases for that reason.
But if someone sets out intentionally and maliciously to hurt another person, punitive damages may well be appropriate.
Punitive damages are intended not only to punish the wrongdoer, by exacting an additional and sometimes heavy payment (the exact amount is left to the discretion of jury and judge), but also to deter others from similar conduct.
The punitive damage award has been subject to heavy criticism in recent years in cases in which it has been awarded against manufacturers.
One fear is that huge damage awards on behalf of a multitude of victims could swiftly bankrupt the defendant.
Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are taxable.
KEY TAKEAWAY There are three kinds of torts, and in two of them (negligent torts and strict liability torts), damages are usually limited to making the victim whole through an enforceable judgment for money damages.
These compensatory damages awarded by a court accomplish only approximate justice for the injuries or property damage caused by a tortfeasor.
Tort laws go a step further toward deterrence, beyond compensation to the plaintiff, in occasionally Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 259  awarding punitive damages against a defendant.
These are almost always in cases where an intentional tort has been committed.
EXERCISES 1.
Why is deterrence needed for intentional torts (where punitive damages are awarded) rather than negligent torts?
2.
Why are costs imposed on others without their consent problematic for a market economy?
What if the law did not try to reimpose the victim’s costs onto the tortfeasor?
What would a totally nonlitigious society be like?
7.2 Intentional Torts LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Distinguish intentional torts from other kinds of torts.
2.
Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to property, and one that causes injury to a reputation.
The analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already discussed in Chapter 6 "Criminal Law".
When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is rarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm.
Certain other intentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business.
Assault and Battery One of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery.
Both criminal law and tort law serve to restrain individuals from using physical force on others.
Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or offense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm.
Battery is unauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury.
Often an assault results in battery, but not always.
In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, the defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even without an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, couldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) on the part of the plaintiff's wife.
It is also possible Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 260  to have a battery without an assault.
For example, if someone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a battery but no assault.
Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a stranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of offensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm.
Thus there has been no tort of assault, but she could allege the tort of battery.
(The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting argument.)
Under the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and the impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent from the target to the actual victim of the act.
Thus Hermione could sue Draco for battery for any damages she had suffered.
False Imprisonment The tort of false imprisonment originally implied a locking up, as in a prison, but today it can occur if a person is restrained in a room or a car or even if his or her movements are restricted while walking down the street.
People have a right to be free to go as they please, and anyone who without cause deprives another of personal freedom has committed a tort.
Damages are allowed for time lost, discomfort and resulting ill health, mental suffering, humiliation, loss of reputation or business, and expenses such as attorneys’ fees incurred as a result of the restraint (such as a false arrest).
But as the case of Lester v. Albers Super Markets, Inc. (Section 7.5 "Cases") shows, the defendant must be shown to have restrained the plaintiff in order for damages to be allowed.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Until recently, the common-law rule was that there could be no recovery for acts, even though intentionally undertaken, that caused purely mental or emotional distress.
For a case to go to the jury, the courts required that the mental distress result from some physical injury.
In recent years, many courts have overthrown the older rule and now recognize the so-called new tort.
In an employment context, however, it is rare to find a case where a plaintiff is able to recover.
The most difficult hurdle is proving that the conduct was “extreme” or “outrageous.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 261  In an early California case, bill collectors came to the debtor’s home repeatedly and threatened the debtor’s pregnant wife.
Among other things, they claimed that the wife would have to deliver her child in prison.
The wife miscarried and had emotional and physical complications.
The court found that the behavior of the collection company’s two agents was sufficiently outrageous to prove the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
In Roche v. Stern (New York), the famous cable television talk show host Howard Stern had tastelessly discussed the remains of Deborah Roche, a topless dancer and cable access television host.
[1] The remains had been brought to Stern’s show by a close friend of Roche, Chaunce Hayden, and a number of crude comments by Stern and Hayden about the remains were videotaped and broadcast on a national cable television station.
Roche’s sister and brother sued Howard Stern and Infinity broadcasting and were able to get past the defendant’s motion to dismiss to have a jury consider their claim.
A plaintiff’s burden in these cases is to show that the mental distress is severe.
Many states require that this distress must result in physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, ulcers, or, as in the case of the pregnant wife, a miscarriage.
Other states have not required physical symptoms, finding that shame, embarrassment, fear, and anger constitute severe mental distress.
Trespass and Nuisance Trespass is intentionally going on land that belongs to someone else or putting something on someone else’s property and refusing to remove it.
This part of tort law shows how strongly the law values the rights of property owners.
The right to enjoy your property without interference from others is also found in common law of nuisance.
There are limits to property owners’ rights, however.
In Katko v. Briney, for example, the plaintiff was injured by a spring gun while trespassing on the defendant’s property.
[2] The defendant had set up No Trespassing signs after ten years of trespassing and housebreaking events, with the loss of some household items.
Windows had been broken, and there was “messing up of the property in general.” The defendants had boarded up the windows and doors in order to stop the intrusions and finally had set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house.
One defendant had cleaned and oiled his 20-gauge shotgun and taken it to the old house where it was secured to an iron bed with the barrel pointed at the bedroom door.
“It was rigged with wire from the doorknob to the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 262  gun’s trigger so would fire when the door was opened.” The angle of the shotgun was adjusted to hit an intruder in the legs.
The spring could not be seen from the outside, and no warning of its presence was posted.
The plaintiff, Katko, had been hunting in the area for several years and considered the property abandoned.
He knew it had long been uninhabited.
He and a friend had been to the house and found several old bottles and fruit jars that they took and added to their collection of antiques.
When they made a second trip to the property, they entered by removing a board from a porch window.
When the plaintiff opened the north bedroom door, the shotgun went off and struck him in the right leg above the ankle bone.
Much of his leg was blown away.
While Katko knew he had no right to break and enter the house with intent to steal bottles and fruit jars, the court held that a property owner could not protect an unoccupied boarded-up farmhouse by using a spring gun capable of inflicting death or serious injury.
In Katko, there is an intentional tort.
But what if someone trespassing is injured by the negligence of the landowner?
States have differing rules about trespass and negligence.
In some states, a trespasser is only protected against the gross negligence of the landowner.
In other states, trespassers may be owed the duty of due care on the part of the landowner.
The burglar who falls into a drained swimming pool, for example, may have a case against the homeowner unless the courts or legislature of that state have made it clear that trespassers are owed the limited duty to avoid gross negligence.
Or a very small child may wander off his own property and fall into a gravel pit on a nearby property and suffer death or serious injury; if the pit should (in the exercise of due care) have been filled in or some barrier erected around it, then there was negligence.
But if the state law holds that the duty to trespassers is only to avoid gross negligence, the child’s family would lose, unless the state law makes an exception for very young trespassers.
In general, guests, licensees, and invitees are owed a duty of due care; a trespasser may not be owed such a duty, but states have different rules on this.
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations Tortious interference with a contract can be established by proving four elements: 1.
There was a contract between the plaintiff and a third party.
2.
The defendant knew of the contract.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 263  3.
The defendant improperly induced the third party to breach the contract or made performance of the contract impossible.
4.
There was injury to the plaintiff.
In a famous case of contract interference, Texaco was sued by Pennzoil for interfering with an agreement that Pennzoil had with Getty Oil.
After complicated negotiations between Pennzoil and Getty, a takeover share price was struck, a memorandum of understanding was signed, and a press release announced the agreement in principle between Pennzoil and Getty.
Texaco’s lawyers, however, believed that Getty oil was “still in play,” and before the lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty could complete the paperwork for their agreement, Texaco announced it was offering Getty shareholders an additional $12.50 per share over what Pennzoil had offered.
Texaco later increased its offer to $228 per share, and the Getty board of directors soon began dealing with Texaco instead of Pennzoil.
Pennzoil decided to sue in Texas state court for tortious interference with a contract.
After a long trial, the jury returned an enormous verdict against Texaco: $7.53 billion in actual damages and $3 billion in punitive damages.
The verdict was so large that it would have bankrupted Texaco.
Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not been completed.
If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one.
After the SEC filed a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil to dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract.
Malicious Prosecution Malicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that there was no probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the crime.
The plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice.
A mere complaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the claim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest.
The criminal proceeding must terminate in the plaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 264  A majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings.
Civil litigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless accusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense.
However, because, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be vindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to litigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case.
The mere dismissal of the original lawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted.
The plaintiff in a suit for wrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed the action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually well grounded.
Defamation Defamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation.
In general, if the harm is done through the spoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander.
If the defamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel.
The Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.” [3] A statement is not defamatory unless it is false.
Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander.
Moreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person.
You cannot be libeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a third person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps).
Any living person is capable of being defamed, but the dead are not.
Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the statements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions.
The statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name.
A statement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major network weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show that the words were aimed at them.
But statements about large groups Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 265  will not support an action for defamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor).
The law of defamation is largely built on strict liability.
That a person did not intend to defame is ordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, magazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel.
Even the exercise of due care is usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated.
Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel cannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else.
Though a plaintiff may be able to prove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages.
That is because the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation.
Publishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or trade libel.
In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement.
It may be difficult to establish damages, however.
A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the slander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well.
Absolute Privilege Statements made during the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged, meaning that they cannot serve as the basis for a defamation suit.
Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are absolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in court.
“Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the government.
The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any statements made in connection with legislative business.
The courts have constructed a similar privilege for many executive branch officials.
Qualified Privilege Absolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector.
A narrower privilege exists for private citizens.
In general, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable purpose.
Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third person, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the warning, even though false.
Likewise, an employee may warn an employer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 266  about the conduct or character of a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence or conduct of a child’s teacher.
There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an idle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong.
In 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding that under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot stand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the statement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” [4] In subsequent cases, the court extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but to public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find themselves the objects of public scrutiny.
Whether a private person is or is not a public figure is a difficult question that has so far eluded rigorous definition and has been answered only from case to case.
A CEO of a private corporation ordinarily will be considered a private figure unless he puts himself in the public eye—for example, by starring in the company’s television commercials.
Invasion of Privacy The right of privacy—the right “to be let alone”—did not receive judicial recognition until the twentieth century, and its legal formulation is still evolving.
In fact there is no single right of privacy.
Courts and commentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the appropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on your “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts of your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” Appropriation of Name or Likeness The earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else placing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a product or in the product name.
A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or picture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first obtaining written consent.
The law also permits Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 267  the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for unauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of the plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image.
This is particularly useful to celebrities.
Because the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays an important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country.
Deciding what “commercial” or “trade” purposes are is not always easy.
Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball player’s picture on its cover without first obtaining written permission, but a chocolate manufacturer could not put the player’s picture on a candy wrapper without consent.
Personal Space One form of intrusion upon a person’s solitude—trespass—has long been actionable under common law.
Physical invasion of home or other property is not a new tort.
But in recent years, the notion of intrusion has been broadened considerably.
Now, taking photos of someone else with your cell phone in a locker room could constitute invasion of the right to privacy.
Reading someone else’s mail or e-mail could also constitute an invasion of the right to privacy.
Photographing someone on a city street is not tortious, but subsequent use of the photograph could be.
Whether the invasion is in a public or private space, the amount of damages will depend on how the image or information is disclosed to others.
Public Disclosure of Embarassing Facts Circulation of false statements that do injury to a person are actionable under the laws of defamation.
What about true statements that might be every bit as damaging—for example, disclosure of someone’s income tax return, revealing how much he earned?
The general rule is that if the facts are truly private and of no “legitimate” concern to the public, then their disclosure is a violation of the right to privacy.
But a person who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection.
False Light A final type of privacy invasion is that which paints a false picture in a publication.
Though false, it might not be libelous, since the publication need contain nothing injurious to reputation.
Indeed, the publication might even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic than he actually is.
Subject to the First Amendment requirement that the plaintiff must show intent or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 268  extreme recklessness, statements that put a person in a false light, like a fictionalized biography, are actionable.
KEY TAKEAWAY There are many kinds of intentional torts.
Some of them involve harm to the physical person or to his or her property, reputation or feelings, or economic interests.
In each case of intentional tort, the plaintiff must show that the defendant intended harm, but the intent to harm does not need to be directed at a particular person and need not be malicious, as long as the resulting harm is a direct consequence of the defendant’s actions.
EXERCISES 1.
Name two kinds of intentional torts that could result in damage to a business firm’s bottom line.

7.3 Negligence LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how the duty of due care relates to negligence.
2.
Distinguish between actual and proximate cause.
3.
Explain the primary defenses to a claim of negligence.
Elements of Negligence Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 269  Physical harm need not be intentionally caused.
A pedestrian knocked over by an automobile does not hurt less because the driver intended no wrong but was merely careless.
The law imposes a duty of care on all of us in our everyday lives.
Accidents caused by negligence are actionable.
Determining negligence is not always easy.
If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent because a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is.
Suppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing down at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, seeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him.
Must one always stop at a red light?
Is proof that the light was red always proof of negligence?
Usually, but not always: negligence is an abstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances.
Whether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide.
Rarely is it a legal question that a judge can settle.
The tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) the breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or loss.
Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law excuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim.
We examine each of these factors below.
Standard of Care Not every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent.
If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart out in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, you have not acted negligently toward the person in the house.
The purpose of the negligence standard is to protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous conduct.
Given the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable standard of care is possible.
Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous standard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries are instructed to compare defendants with in assessing Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 270  whether those defendants have acted negligently.
Analysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators.
How much knowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect?
With what physical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed?
If the defendant is a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat the “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will not?
(Answer: in most cases, yes.)
Despite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases ultimately turn.
If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed an unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct.
Perhaps in most instances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do.
The reasonable man stops for traffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs surgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of his grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions to avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on.
The "reasonable man" standard imposes hindsight on the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may sometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable.
Duty of Care and Its Breach The law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person.
If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in this interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might subject us to liability for its effect on someone else.
The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the number of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful.
In general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers.
We may pass the drowning child without risking a lawsuit.
But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully.
The law of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in order to avoid unreasonable risks of injury.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 271  During the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of “foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the case.
For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to immediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.
This limitation was known as the rule of privity.
And users who were not immediate purchasers were said not to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer.
In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the New York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, though it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line.
Determining a duty of care can be a vexing problem.
Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of medical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients.
Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he intends to kill his girlfriend.
Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim?
The California Supreme Court has said yes.
[1] Establishing a breach of the duty of due care where the defendant has violated a statute or municipal ordinance is eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se, a doctrine common to all US state courts.
If a legislative body sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts to protect a certain set of people from harm and a violation of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the defendant is negligent per se.
If Harvey is driving sixty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour zone when he crashes into Haley’s car and the police accident report establishes that or he otherwise admits to going ten miles per hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that Harvey has breached a duty of due care.
She will only have to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate cause of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the resulting damages to her.
Causation: Actual Cause and Proximate Cause “For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” as the old saying has it.
Virtually any cause of an injury can be traced to some preceding cause.
The problem for the law is to know when to draw the line between causes that are immediate and causes too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them.
In tort theory, there are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must prove: actual cause and proximate cause.Actual cause (causation in fact) can be found if the connection Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 272  between the defendant’s act and the plaintiff’s injuries passes the “but for” test: if an injury would not have occurred “but for” the defendant’s conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the injury.
Still, this is not enough causation to create liability.
The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not “too remote,” for the defendant’s act to create liability.
This is proximate cause: a cause that is not too remote or unforseeable.
Suppose that the person who was injured was not one whom a reasonable person could have expected to be harmed.
Such a situation was presented in one of the most famous US tort cases, Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad (Section 7.5 "Cases"), which was decided by Judge Benjamin Cardozo.
Although Judge Cardozo persuaded four of his seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the case demonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present.
Damages For a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove that she was injured.
The fear that she might be injured in the future is not a sufficient basis for a suit.
This rule has proved troublesome in medical malpractice and industrial disease cases.
A doctor’s negligent act or a company’s negligent exposure of a worker to some form of contamination might not become manifest in the body for years.
In the meantime, the tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the victim from suing at all.
An increasing number of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease.
The law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in danger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity.
If you discover your neighbor experimenting with explosives in his basement, you could bring suit to enjoin him from further experimentation, even though he has not yet blown up his house—and yours.
Problems of Proof The plaintiff in a tort suit, as in any other, has the burden of proving his allegations.
He must show that the defendant took the actions complained of as negligent, demonstrate the circumstances that make the actions negligent, and prove the occurrence and extent of injury.
Factual issues are for the jury to resolve.
Since it is frequently difficult to make out the requisite Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 273  proof, the law allows certain presumptions and rules of evidence that ease the plaintiff’s task, on the ground that without them substantial injustice would be done.
One important rule goes by the Latin phraseres ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most direct evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question.
But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and in any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the reasonableness of someone’s conduct, which inevitably can only be inferred from the circumstances.
In many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence or will constitute the bulk of the evidence.
Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no one saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly conclusive.
Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference of negligence.
A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of negligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] If a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane crashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the defendants, that there was negligence.
The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining precisely how the accident occurred.
A defendant can always offer evidence that he acted reasonably—for example, that the flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning, for which he was not responsible, broke its bands, causing it to roll out the window.
But testimony by the factory employees that they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the inference.
That the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry or automatically entitle the plaintiff to a judgment.
Tort law provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are discussed briefly in the next section.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 274  Excuses There are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but contributory negligence or comparative negligence, assumption of risk, and act of God are among the principal defenses that will completely or partially excuse the negligence of the defendant.
Contributory and Comparative Negligence Under an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit was himself negligent.
Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to the defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury.
In a few states today, this rule ofcontributory negligence is still in effect.
Although referred to as negligence, the rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the plaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the defendant is charged with conduct careless toward others.
This rule was so manifestly unjust in many cases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version of comparative negligence.
Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned according to the defendant’s degree of culpability.
For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 injury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages.
Assumption of Risk Risk of injury pervades the modern world, and plaintiffs should not win a lawsuit simply because they took a risk and lost.
The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she must suffer the consequences.
The assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways.
The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the defendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury occur.
(“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I haven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the defendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is hit by a line drive in a ballpark).
Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance to have been created by the defendant’s Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 275  negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do so, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk).
The difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity.
If the plaintiff had no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have assumed it.
On the other hand, it is easy to claim that you did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an objective standard of community knowledge (a “but you should have known” test) in many situations.
When the plaintiff has no real alternative, however, assumption of risk fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to light the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the risk of using it).
At the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers injured on the job.
They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions or equipment.
This rule has been abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states.
Act of God Technically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes called, is not an excuse but a defense premised on a lack of causation.
If a force of nature caused the harm, then the defendant was not negligent in the first place.
A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at its dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys someone’s vessel.
However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by a natural event, then there is liability.
For example, a work crew failed to remove residue explosive gas from an oil barge.
Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several workmen.
The plaintiff recovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against any one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas.
[3] Vicarious Liability Liability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent.
Under certain circumstances, the liability is imputed to others.
For example, an employer is responsible for the negligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment.
This rule of vicarious liability is often called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority must Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 276  respond to claims brought against one of its agents.
Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment relationship but extends to a number of other agency relationships as well.
Legislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people with whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency.
It is common, for example, for the owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car.
So-called dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol to one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others.
In these situations, although the injurious act of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) is not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now turn.
KEY TAKEAWAY The most common tort claim is based on the negligence of the defendant.
In each negligence claim, the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the defendant had a duty of due care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, (3) that the breach of duty both actually and approximately has caused harm to the plaintiff, and (4) that the harm is measurable in money damages.
It is also possible for the negligence of one person to be imputed to another, as in the case of respondeat superior, or in the case of someone who loans his automobile to another driver who is negligent and causes injury.
There are many excuses (defenses) to claims of negligence, including assumption of risk and comparative negligence.
In those few jurisdictions where contributory negligence has not been modified to comparative negligence, plaintiffs whose negligence contributes to their own injuries will be barred from any recovery.

7.4 Strict Liability LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how strict liability torts differ from negligent torts.
2.
Understand the historical origins of strict liability under common law.
3.
Be able to apply strict liability concepts to liability for defective products.
4.
Distinguish strict liability from absolute liability, and understand the major defenses to a lawsuit in products-liability cases.
Historical Basis of Strict Liability: Animals and Ultrahazardous Activities To this point, we have considered principles of liability that in some sense depend upon the “fault” of the tortfeasor.
This fault is not synonymous with moral blame.
Aside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure to live up to a standard of reasonableness or due care.
But this is not the only basis for tort liability.
Innocent mistakes can be a sufficient basis.
As we have already seen, someone who unknowingly trespasses on another’s property is liable for the damage that he does, even if he has a reasonable belief that the land is his.
And it has long been held that someone who engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally dangerous) activities is liable for damage that he causes, even though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm to someone else.
Likewise, the owner of animals that escape from their pastures or homes and damage neighboring property may be liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power of the owner to stop (e.g., a fire started by lightning that burns open a barn door).
In such cases, the courts invoke the principle of strict liability, or, as it is sometimes called, liability without fault.
The reason for the rule is explained in Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation (Section 7.5 "Cases").
Strict Liability for Products Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 278  Products liability is extremely important.
Strict liability may also apply as a legal standard for products, even those that are not ultrahazardous.
In some national legal systems, strict liability is not available as a cause of action to plaintiffs seeking to recover a judgment of products liability against a manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer.
(Some states limit liability to the manufacturer.)
But it is available in the United States and initially was created by a California Supreme Court decision in the 1962 case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.
In Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and bench, the Shopsmith, designed and manufactured by the defendant.
He was experienced in using power tools and was injured while using the approved lathe attachment to the Shopsmith to fashion a wooden chalice.
The case was decided on the premise that Greenman had done nothing wrong in using the machine but that the machine had a defect that was “latent” (not easily discoverable by the consumer).
Rather than decide the case based on warranties, or requiring that Greenman prove how the defendant had been negligent, Justice Traynor found for the plaintiff based on the overall social utility of strict liability in cases of defective products.
According to his decision, the purpose of such liability is to ensure that the “cost of injuries resulting from defective products is borne by the manufacturers…rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves.” Today, the majority of US states recognize strict liability for defective products, although some states limit strict liability actions to damages for personal injuries rather than property damage.
Injured plaintiffs have to prove the product caused the harm but do not have to prove exactly how the manufacturer was careless.
Purchasers of the product, as well as injured guests, bystanders, and others with no direct relationship with the product, may sue for damages caused by the product.
The Restatement of the Law of Torts, Section 402(a), was originally issued in 1964.
It is a widely accepted statement of the liabilities of sellers of goods for defective products.
The Restatement specifies six requirements, all of which must be met for a plaintiff to recover using strict liability for a product that the plaintiff claims is defective: 1.
The product must be in a defective condition when the defendant sells it.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 279  2.
The defendant must normally be engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing the product.
3.
The product must be unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer because of its defective condition.
4.
The plaintiff must incur physical harm to self or to property by using or consuming the product.
5.
The defective condition must be the proximate cause of the injury or damage.
6.
The goods must not have been substantially changed from the time the product was sold to the time the injury was sustained.
Section 402(a) also explicitly makes clear that a defendant can be held liable even though the defendant has exercised “all possible care.” Thus in a strict liability case, the plaintiff does not need to show “fault” (or negligence).
For defendants, who can include manufacturers, distributors, processors, assemblers, packagers, bottlers, retailers, and wholesalers, there are a number of defenses that are available, including assumption of risk, product misuse and comparative negligence, commonly known dangers, and the knowledgeable-user defense.
We have already seen assumption of risk and comparative negligence in terms of negligence actions; the application of these is similar in products-liability actions.
Under product misuse, a plaintiff who uses a product in an unexpected and unusual way will not recover for injuries caused by such misuse.
For example, suppose that someone uses a rotary lawn mower to trim a hedge and that after twenty minutes of such use loses control because of its weight and suffers serious cuts to his abdomen after dropping it.
Here, there would be a defense of product misuse, as well as contributory negligence.
Consider the urban (or Internet) legend of Mervin Gratz, who supposedly put his Winnebago on autopilot to go back and make coffee in the kitchen, then recovered millions after his Winnebago turned over and he suffered serious injuries.
There are multiple defenses to this alleged action; these would include the defenses of contributory negligence, comparative negligence, and product misuse.
(There was never any such case, and certainly no such recovery; it is not known who started this legend, or why.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 280  Another defense against strict liability as a cause of action is the knowledgeable user defense.
If the parents of obese teenagers bring a lawsuit against McDonald’s, claiming that its fast-food products are defective and that McDonald’s should have warned customers of the adverse health effects of eating its products, a defense based on the knowledgeable user is available.
In one case, the court found that the high levels of cholesterol, fat, salt, and sugar in McDonald’s food is well known to users.
The court stated, “If consumers know (or reasonably should know) the potential ill health effects of eating at McDonald’s, they cannot blame McDonald’s if they, nonetheless, choose to satiate their appetite with a surfeit of supersized McDonald’s products.” [1] KEY TAKEAWAY Common-law courts have long held that certain activities are inherently dangerous and that those who cause damage to others by engaging in those activities will be held strictly liable.
More recently, courts in the United States have applied strict liability to defective products.
Strict liability, however, is not absolute liability, as there are many defenses available to defendants in lawsuits based on strict liability, such as comparative negligence and product abuse.

7.5 Cases Intentional Torts: False Imprisonment Lester v. Albers Super Markets, Inc. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 281  94 Ohio App.
313, 114 N.E.2d 529 (Ohio 1952) Facts: The plaintiff, carrying a bag of rolls purchased at another store, entered the defendant’s grocery store to buy some canned fruit.
Seeing her bus outside, she stepped out of line and put the can on the counter.
The store manager intercepted her and repeatedly demanded that she submit the bag to be searched.
Finally she acquiesced; he looked inside and said she could go.
She testified that several people witnessed the scene, which lasted about fifteen minutes, and that she was humiliated.
The jury awarded her $800.
She also testified that no one laid a hand on her or made a move to restrain her from leaving by any one of numerous exits.
* * * MATTHEWS, JUDGE.
As we view the record, it raises the fundamental question of what is imprisonment.
Before any need for a determination of illegality arises there must be proof of imprisonment.
In 35 Corpus Juris Secundum (C.J.S.
), False Imprisonment, § II, pages 512–13, it is said: “Submission to the mere verbal direction of another, unaccompanied by force or by threats of any character, cannot constitute a false imprisonment, and there is no false imprisonment where an employer interviewing an employee declines to terminate the interview if no force or threat of force is used and false imprisonment may not be predicated on a person’s unfounded belief that he was restrained.” Many cases are cited in support of the text.
* * * In Fenn v. Kroger Grocery & Baking Co., Mo.
Sup., 209 S.W.
885, 887, the court said: A case was not made out for false arrest.
The plaintiff said she was intercepted as she started to leave the store; that Mr. Krause stood where she could not pass him in going out.
She does not say that he made any attempt to intercept her.
She says he escorted her back to the desk, that he asked her to let him see the change.
…She does not say that she went unwillingly…Evidence is wholly lacking to show that she was detained by force or threats.
It was probably a disagreeable experience, a humiliating one to her, but she came out victorious and was allowed to go when she desired with the assurance of Mr. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 282  Krause that it was all right.
The demurrer to the evidence on both counts was properly sustained.
The result of the cases is epitomized in 22 Am.Jur.
368, as follows: A customer or patron who apparently has not paid for what he has received may be detained for a reasonable time to investigate the circumstances, but upon payment of the demand, he has the unqualified right to leave the premises without restraint, so far as the proprietor is concerned, and it is false imprisonment for a private individual to detain one for an unreasonable time, or under unreasonable circumstances, for the purpose of investigating a dispute over the payment of a bill alleged to be owed by the person detained for cash services.
* * * For these reasons, the judgment is reversed and final judgment entered for the defendant- appellant.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
The court begins by saying what false imprisonment is not.
What is the legal definition of false imprisonment?
2.
What kinds of detention are permissible for a store to use in accosting those that may have been shoplifting?
3.
Jody broke up with Jeremy and refused to talk to him.
Jeremy saw Jody get into her car near the business school and parked right behind her so she could not move.
He then stood next to the driver’s window for fifteen minutes, begging Jody to talk to him.
She kept saying, “No, let me leave!” Has Jeremy committed the tort of false imprisonment?
Negligence: Duty of Due Care Whitlock v. University of Denver 744 P.2d 54 (Supreme Court of Colorado1987) On June 19, 1978, at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Oscar Whitlock suffered a paralyzing injury while attempting to complete a one-and-three-quarters front flip on a trampoline.
The injury rendered him a quadriplegic.
The trampoline was owned by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity (the Beta house) and was situated on the front yard of the fraternity premises, located on the University campus.
At the time of his injury, Whitlock was twenty years old, attended the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 283  University of Denver, and was a member of the Beta house, where he held the office of acting house manager.
The property on which the Beta house was located was leased to the local chapter house association of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by the defendant University of Denver.
Whitlock had extensive experience jumping on trampolines.
He began using trampolines in junior high school and continued to do so during his brief tenure as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he learned to execute the one-and-three-quarters front flip.
Whitlock testified that he utilized the trampoline at West Point every other day for a period of two months.
He began jumping on the trampoline owned by the Beta house in September of 1977.
Whitlock recounted that in the fall and spring prior to the date of his injury, he jumped on the trampoline almost daily.
He testified further that prior to the date of his injury, he had successfully executed the one-and-three-quarters front flip between seventy-five and one hundred times.
During the evening of June 18 and early morning of June 19, 1978, Whitlock attended a party at the Beta house, where he drank beer, vodka and scotch until 2:00 a.m. Whitlock then retired and did not awaken until 2:00 p.m. on June 19.
He testified that he jumped on the trampoline between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., and again at 7:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the time of the injury, there again was a party in progress at the Beta house, and Whitlock was using the trampoline with only the illumination from the windows of the fraternity house, the outside light above the front door of the house, and two street lights in the area.
As Whitlock attempted to perform the one-and-three-quarters front flip, he landed on the back of his head, causing his neck to break.
Whitlock brought suit against the manufacturer and seller of the trampoline, the University, the Beta Theta Pi fraternity and its local chapter, and certain individuals in their capacities as representatives of the Beta Theta Pi organizations.
Whitlock reached settlements with all of the named defendants except the University, so only the negligence action against the University proceeded to trial.
The jury returned a verdict in favor of Whitlock, assessing his total damages at $ 7,300,000.
The jury attributed twenty-eight percent of causal negligence to the conduct of Whitlock and seventy-two percent of causal negligence to the conduct of the University.
The trial court accordingly reduced the amount of the award against the University to $ 5,256,000.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 284  The University moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, a new trial.
The trial court granted the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, holding that as a matter of law, no reasonable jury could have found that the University was more negligent than Whitlock, and that the jury’s monetary award was the result of sympathy, passion or prejudice.
A panel of the court of appeals reversed…by a divided vote.
Whitlock v. University of Denver, 712 P.2d 1072 (Colo. App.
1985).
The court of appeals held that the University owed Whitlock a duty of due care to remove the trampoline from the fraternity premises or to supervise its use.…The case was remanded to the trial court with orders to reinstate the verdict and damages as determined by the jury.
The University then petitioned for certiorari review, and we granted that petition.
II.
A negligence claim must fail if based on circumstances for which the law imposes no duty of care upon the defendant for the benefit of the plaintiff.
[Citations] Therefore, if Whitlock’s judgment against the University is to be upheld, it must first be determined that the University owed a duty of care to take reasonable measures to protect him against the injury that he sustained.
Whether a particular defendant owes a legal duty to a particular plaintiff is a question of law.
[Citations] “The court determines, as a matter of law, the existence and scope of the duty—that is, whether the plaintiff’s interest that has been infringed by the conduct of the defendant is entitled to legal protection.” [Citations] In Smith v. City & County of Denver, 726 P.2d 1125 (Colo. 1986), we set forth several factors to be considered in determining the existence of duty in a particular case: Whether the law should impose a duty requires consideration of many factors including, for example, the risk involved, the foreseeability and likelihood of injury as weighed against the social utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury or harm, and the consequences of placing the burden upon the actor.
…A court’s conclusion that a duty does or does not exist is “an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is [or is not] entitled to protection.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 285  … We believe that the fact that the University is charged with negligent failure to act rather than negligent affirmative action is a critical factor that strongly militates against imposition of a duty on the University under the facts of this case.
In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the law has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active misconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps to protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373.
Liability for nonfeasance was slow to receive recognition in the law.
“The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by ‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has at least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his affairs.” Id.
The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: The fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.
Imposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary standards.
In nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations involving a limited group of special relationships between parties.
Such special relationships are predicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies the imposition of a duty to act.” W. Keeton, § 56, at 374.
Special relationships that have been recognized by various courts for the purpose of imposition of a duty of care include common carrier/passenger, innkeeper/guest, possessor of land/invited entrant, employer/employee, parent/child, and hospital/patient.
See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 A (1965); 3 Harper and James, § 18.6, at 722–23.
The authors of theRestatement (Second) of Torts § 314 A, comment b (1965), state that “the law appears…to be working slowly toward a recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of dependence or of mutual dependence.” … Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 286  III.
The present case involves the alleged negligent failure to act, rather than negligent action.
The plaintiff does not complain of any affirmative action taken by the University, but asserts instead that the University owed to Whitlock the duty to assure that the fraternity’s trampoline was used only under supervised conditions comparable to those in a gymnasium class, or in the alternative to cause the trampoline to be removed from the front lawn of the Beta house.…If such a duty is to be recognized, it must be grounded on a special relationship between the University and Whitlock.
According to the evidence, there are only two possible sources of a special relationship out of which such a duty could arise in this case: the status of Whitlock as a student at the University, and the lease between the University and the fraternity of which Whitlock was a member.
We first consider the adequacy of the student-university relationship as a possible basis for imposing a duty on the University to control or prohibit the use of the trampoline, and then examine the provisions of the lease for that same purpose.
A.
The student-university relationship has been scrutinized in several jurisdictions, and it is generally agreed that a university is not an insurer of its students’ safety.
[Citations] The relationship between a university and its students has experienced important change over the years.
At one time, college administrators and faculties stood in loco parentis to their students, which created a special relationship “that imposed a duty on the college to exercise control over student conduct and, reciprocally, gave the students certain rights of protection by the college.” Bradshaw, 612 F.2d at 139.
However, in modern times there has evolved a gradual reapportionment of responsibilities from the universities to the students, and a corresponding departure from the in loco parentis relationship.
Id.
at 139–40.
Today, colleges and universities are regarded as educational institutions rather than custodial ones.
Beach, 726 P.2d at 419 (contrasting colleges and universities with elementary and high schools).
… …By imposing a duty on the University in this case, the University would be encouraged to exercise more control over private student recreational choices, thereby effectively taking away Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 287  much of the responsibility recently recognized in students for making their own decisions with respect to private entertainment and personal safety.
Such an allocation of responsibility would “produce a repressive and inhospitable environment, largely inconsistent with the objectives of a modern college education.” Beach, 726 P.2d at 419.
The evidence demonstrates that only in limited instances has the University attempted to impose regulations or restraints on the private recreational pursuits of its students, and the students have not looked to the University to assure the safety of their recreational choices.
Nothing in the University’s student handbook, which contains certain regulations concerning student conduct, reflects an effort by the University to control the risk-taking decisions of its students in their private recreation.…Indeed, fraternity and sorority self-governance with minimal supervision appears to have been fostered by the University.
… Aside from advising the Beta house on one occasion to put the trampoline up when not in use, there is no evidence that the University officials attempted to assert control over trampoline use by the fraternity members.
We conclude from this record that the University’s very limited actions concerning safety of student recreation did not give Whitlock or the other members of campus fraternities or sororities any reason to depend upon the University for evaluation of the safety of trampoline use.…Therefore, we conclude that the student-university relationship is not a special relationship of the type giving rise to a duty of the University to take reasonable measures to protect the members of fraternities and sororities from risks of engaging in extra- curricular trampoline jumping.
The plaintiff asserts, however, that we should recognize a duty of the University to take affirmative action to protect fraternity members because of the foreseeability of the injury, the extent of the risks involved in trampoline use, the seriousness of potential injuries, and the University’s superior knowledge concerning these matters.
The argument in essence is that a duty should spring from the University’s natural interest in the welfare and safety of its students, its superior knowledge of the nature and degree of risk involved in trampoline use, and its knowledge of the use of trampolines on the University campus.
The evidence amply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential for an Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 288  injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable.
It shows further that prior injuries resulting from trampoline accidents had been reported to campus security and to the student clinic, and that University administrators were aware of the number and severity of trampoline injuries nationwide.
The record, however, also establishes through Whitlock’s own testimony that he was aware of the risk of an accident and injury of the very nature that he experienced.… We conclude that the relationship between the University and Whitlock was not one of dependence with respect to the activities at issue here, and provides no basis for the recognition of a duty of the University to take measures for protection of Whitlock against the injury that he suffered.
B.
We next examine the lease between the University and the fraternity to determine whether a special relationship between the University and Whitlock can be predicated on that document.
The lease was executed in 1929, extends for a ninety-nine year term, and gives the fraternity the option to extend the term for another ninety-nine years.
The premises are to be occupied and used by the fraternity “as a fraternity house, clubhouse, dormitory and boarding house, and generally for religious, educational, social and fraternal purposes.” Such occupation is to be “under control of the tenant.” (emphasis added) The annual rental at all times relevant to this case appears from the record to be one dollar.
The University has the obligation to maintain the grounds and make necessary repairs to the building, and the fraternity is to bear the cost of such maintenance and repair.
… We conclude that the lease, and the University’s actions pursuant to its rights under the lease, provide no basis of dependence by the fraternity members upon which a special relationship can be found to exist between the University and the fraternity members that would give rise to a duty upon the University to take affirmative action to assure that recreational equipment such as a trampoline is not used under unsafe conditions.
IV.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 289  Considering all of the factors presented, we are persuaded that under the facts of this case the University of Denver had no duty to Whitlock to eliminate the private use of trampolines on its campus or to supervise that use.
There exists no special relationship between the parties that justifies placing a duty upon the University to protect Whitlock from the well-known dangers of using a trampoline.
Here, a conclusion that a special relationship existed between Whitlock and the University sufficient to warrant the imposition of liability for nonfeasance would directly contravene the competing social policy of fostering an educational environment of student autonomy and independence.
We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return this case to that court with directions to remand it to the trial court for dismissal of Whitlock’s complaint against the University.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
How are comparative negligence numbers calculated by the trial court?
How can the jury say that the university is 72 percent negligent and that Whitlock is 28 percent negligent?
2.
Why is this not an assumption of risk case?
3.
Is there any evidence that Whitlock was contributorily negligent?
If not, why would the court engage in comparative negligence calculations?
Negligence: Proximate Cause Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R.
248 N.Y. 339,162 N.E.
99 (N.Y. 1928) CARDOZO, Chief Judge Plaintiff was standing on a platform of defendant’s railroad after buying a ticket to go to Rockaway Beach.
A train stopped at the station, bound for another place.
Two men ran forward to catch it.
One of the men reached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving.
The other man, carrying a package, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to fall.
A guard on the car, who had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed him from behind.
In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails.
It was a package of small size, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by a newspaper.
In fact it contained fireworks, but there was Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 290  nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents.
The fireworks when they fell exploded.
The shock of· the explosion threw down some scales at the other end of the platform many feet away.
The scales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues.
The conduct of the defendant’s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away.
Relatively to her it was not negligence at all.
Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus removed.
Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the violation of a right.
“Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.…If no hazard was apparent to the eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to her, did not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not one involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to someone else.…The plaintiff sues in her own right for a wrong personal to her, and not as the vicarious beneficiary of a breach of duty to another.
A different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions.
A guard stumbles over a package which has been left upon a platform.
It seems to be a bundle of newspapers.
It turns out to be a can of dynamite.
To the eye of ordinary vigilance, the bundle is abandoned waste, which may be kicked or trod on with impunity.
Is a passenger at the other end of the platform protected by the law against the unsuspected hazard concealed beneath the waste?
If not, is the result to be any different, so far as the distant passenger is concerned, when the guard stumbles over a valise which a truckman or a porter has left upon the walk?…The orbit of the danger as disclosed to the eye of reasonable vigilance would be the orbit of the duty.
One who jostles one’s neighbor in a crowd does not invade the rights of others standing at the outer fringe when the unintended contact casts a bomb upon the ground.
The wrongdoer as to them is the man who carries the bomb, not the one who explodes it without suspicion of the danger.
Life will have to be made over, and human nature transformed, before prevision so extravagant can be accepted as the norm of conduct, the customary standard to which behavior must conform.
The argument for the plaintiff is built upon the shifting meanings of such words as “wrong” and “wrongful” and shares their instability.
For what the plaintiff must show is a “wrong” to herself; Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 291  i.e., a violation of her own right, and not merely a “wrong” to someone else, nor conduct “wrongful” because unsocial, but not a “wrong” to anyone.
We are told that one who drives at reckless speed through a crowded city street is guilty of a negligent act and therefore of a wrongful one, irrespective of the consequences.
Negligent the act is, and wrongful in the sense that it is unsocial, but wrongful and unsocial in relation to other travelers, only because the eye of vigilance perceives the risk of damage.
If the same act were to be committed on a speedway or a race course, it would lose its wrongful quality.
The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension.
This does not mean, of course, that one who launches a destructive force is always relieved of liability, if the force, though known to be destructive, pursues an unexpected path.…Some acts, such as shooting are so imminently dangerous to anyone who may come within reach of the missile however unexpectedly, as to impose a duty of prevision not far from that of an insurer.
Even today, and much oftener in earlier stages of the law, one acts sometimes at one’s peril.…These cases aside, wrong-is defined in terms of the natural or probable, at least when unintentional.…Negligence, like risk, is thus a term of relation.
Negligence in the abstract, apart from things related, is surely not a tort, if indeed it is understandable at all.…One who seeks redress at law does not make out a cause of action by showing without more that there has been damage to his person.
If the harm was not willful, he must show that the act as to him had possibilities of danger so many and apparent as to entitle him to be protected against the doing of it though the harm was unintended.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 292  Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation 810 P.2d 917 (Supreme Court of Washington 1991) Pyrodyne Corporation (Pyrodyne) is a licensed fireworks display company that contracted to display fireworks at the Western Washington State Fairgrounds in Puyallup, Washington, on July 4,1987.
During the fireworks display, one of the mortar launchers discharged a rocket on a horizontal trajectory parallel to the earth.
The rocket exploded near a crowd of onlookers, including Danny Klein.
Klein’s clothing was set on fire, and he suffered facial burns and serious injury to his eyes.
Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict liability to recover for his injuries.
Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was negligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable.
The trial court applied the doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein.
Pyrodyne appealed.
Section 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally dangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages.
The public display of fireworks fits this definition.
The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to explode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property damage is created.
That risk arises because of the possibility that a rocket will malfunction or be misdirected.” Pyrodyne argued that its liability was cut off by the Chinese manufacturer’s negligence.
The court rejected this argument, stating, “Even if negligence may properly be regarded as an intervening cause, it cannot function to relieve Pyrodyne from strict liability.” The Washington Supreme Court held that the public display of fireworks is an abnormally dangerous activity that warrants the imposition of strict liability.
Affirmed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Why would certain activities be deemed ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous so that strict liability is imposed?
2.
If the activities are known to be abnormally dangerous, did Klein assume the risk?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 293  3.
Assume that the fireworks were negligently manufactured in China.
Should Klein’s only remedy be against the Chinese company, as Pyrodyne argues?
Why or why not?
7.6 Summary and Exercises Summary The principles of tort law pervade modern society because they spell out the duties of care that we owe each other in our private lives.
Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern technology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide class of consumers.
Unlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for which he or she will be held liable to pay damages.
Negligence—that is, carelessness— is a major factor in tort liability.
In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault standard called strict liability is applied.
What constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances.
A person can assume a risk or consent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability.
To be liable, the tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause.
On the other hand, certain people are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts of his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too many drinks.
Two types of statutes— workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have eliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance payment plan.
Among the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal injury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with contractual relations.

Some basic contract taxonomy 5.
The required elements of a contract: mutual assent, consideration, legality, and capacity 6.

The remedies for breach of contract The two fundamental concepts considered the twin cornerstones of business relationships are contract and tort.
Although both involve the concept of duty, creation of the duty differs in a manner that is important to business.
The parties create contractduties through a bargaining process.
The key element in the process is control; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the freedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship.
Tort duties, in contrast, are obligations the law imposes.
Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an understanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk management.
8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the role of contract in society: it moves society from status to contract.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 297  2.
Know the definition of a contract.
3.
Recognize the sources of contract law: the common law, the UCC, and the Convention on the International Sale of Goods—a treaty (the CISG).
4.
Understand some fundamental contract taxonomy and terminology.
The Role of Contract in Society Contract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our society because it is so central to a deeply held conviction about the essence of our political, economic, and social life.
In common parlance, the term is used interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies our notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others.
Contract is central because it is the means by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy.
So commonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is difficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one another were not freely determined.
Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were rare, entered into if at all by very few.
In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our institutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that each person owed to family, tribe, or manor.
Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a nineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law.
As he put it: (F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations of Family, we seem to have steadily moved towards a phase of social order in which all these relations arise from the free agreement of Individuals.

Thus the status of the Slave has disappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master.

The status of the Female under Tutelage .

has also ceased to exist.
.
.
.
So too the status of the Son under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies.
If any civil obligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives its legal validity....
If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to signify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 298  may say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract.
[1] This movement was not accidental.
It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy with all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, commercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity.
Contract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan.
It was a response to changing conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the quieter, imagined pastoral life of their forefathers.
Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, did a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism.
Contract Defined As usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic.
The Restatement says: “A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.”(Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the Uniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the parties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” (Section 1-201(11)) A short-hand definition is: “A contract is a legally enforceable promise.” Economic View of Contract Law In An Economic Analysis of Law (1973), Judge Richard A. Posner (a former University of Chicago law professor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions.
First, it helps maintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently.
Second, it reduces the costs of economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of negotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out.
Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to trouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently and avoid potential pitfalls.
Sources of Contract Law Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 299  There are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state case law, and administrative law.
For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will examine at some length, are case lawand statutes.
Case (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts Because contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil of individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions.
By the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the published opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves.
Clearly this mass of case law was too unwieldy for efficient use.
A similar problem had developed in the other leading branches of the common law.
Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, a group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 to attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law.
One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most successful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932.
A revision— the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979.
The Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, restitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field.
These analyses are made with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the maximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be.
The Restatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through several so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various committees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents.
The Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases.
The Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they are nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance.
They are as close to “black letter” rules of law as exist anywhere in the American legal system for judge-made (common) law.
Statutory Law: The Uniform Commercial Code Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 300  Common law contract principles govern contracts for real estate and for services, obviously very important areas of law.
But in one area the common law has been superseded by an important statute: the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), especially Article 2, which deals with the sale of goods.
A Brief History The UCC is a model law developed by the American law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws; it has been adopted in one form or another in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the American territories.
It is the only “national” law not enacted by Congress.
Before the UCC was written, commercial law varied, sometimes greatly, from state to state.
This first proved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became nationwide during the twentieth century.
Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with commercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and none nationally.
As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, securities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt of untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state.
Initial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of hundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges.
A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and the Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951.
Pennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953.
It was the only state to enact the original version, because the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line and had serious objections.
Three years later, in 1956, a revised code was issued.
This version, known as the 1957 Official Text, was enacted in Massachusetts and Kentucky.
In 1958, the Conference and the Institute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text.
Sixteen states, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 301  But in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions.
As a consequence, the Uniform Commercial Code was no longer so uniform.
Responding to this development the American Law Institute established a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code.
Various subcommittees went to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published.
Twelve more states adopted the code, eleven of them the 1962 text.
By 1966, only three states and two territories had failed to enact any version: Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Guam, and Puerto Rico.
Meanwhile, non-uniform provisions continued to be enacted in various states, particularly in Article 9, to which 337 such amendments had been made.
In 1971, a redraft of that article was readied and the 1972 Official Text was published.
By that time, Louisiana was the only holdout.
Two years later, in 1974, Louisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text (significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2).
One more major change was made, a revision of Article 8, necessitated by the electronics revolution that led to new ways of transferring investment securities from seller to purchaser.
This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version that remains current.
From this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and business lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have adopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still.
The Basic Framework of the UCC The UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity.
A commercial transaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a contract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods under a bill of Lading, and so on.
However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet of one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods.
The Code deals with phases of this transaction from start to finish.
These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: • Sales (Article 2) • Commercial Paper (Article 3) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 302  • Bank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) • Letters of Credit (Article 5) • Bulk Transfers (Article 6) • Warehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) • Investment Securities (Article 8) • Secured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) We now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction.
Sales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined (Section 2-105) in part as “all things .
.
.
which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid.
.
.
.” The only contracts and agreements covered by Article 2 are those relating to the present or future sale of goods.
In certain cases, the courts have difficulty in determining the nature of the object of a sales contract.
The problem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a combination of goods and services?
This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the buyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties.
For example, you go to the hairdresser for a permanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash.
May you recover damages on the grounds that either the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods?
When the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win.
Compare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of goods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only incidentally used, with Newmark v.Gimbel’s Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), in which the court said “[i]f the permanent wave lotion were sold … for home consumption .
.
.
unquestionably an implied warranty of fitness for that purpose would have been an integral incident of the sale.” The New Jersey court rejected the defendant’s argument that by actually applying the lotion to the patron’s head the salon lessened the liability it otherwise would have had if it had simply sold her the lotion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 303  In two areas, state legislatures have taken the goods vs. services issue out of the courts’ hands and resolved the issue through legislation.
One area involves restaurant cases, in which typically the plaintiff charges that he became ill because of tainted food.
UCC Section 2·314(1) states that any seller who is regularly a merchant of the goods sold impliedly warrants their merchantability in a contract for their sale.
This section explicitly declares that serving food or drink is a sale, whether they are to be consumed on or off the premises.
The second type of case involves blood transfusions, which can give a patient hepatitis, a serious and sometimes fatal disease.
Hospitals and blood banks obviously face large potential liability under the UCC provision just referred to on implied warranty of merchantability.
Because medical techniques cannot detect the hepatitis virus in any form of blood used, hospitals and blood banks would be in constant jeopardy, without being able to take effective action to minimize the danger.
Most states have enacted legislation specifically providing that blood supplies to be used in transfusions are a service, not goods, thus relieving the suppliers and hospitals of an onerous burden.
Three Basic Contract Types: Sources of Law With this brief description of the UCC, it should now be clear that the primary sources of law for the three basic types of contracts are: • Real estate: common law; • Services: common law; • Sale of goods: UCC (as interpreted by the courts).
Common law and UCC rules are often similar.
For example, both require good faith in the performance of a contract.
However, there are two general differences worth noting between the common law of contracts and the UCC’s rules governing the sales of goods.
First, the UCC is more liberal than the common law in upholding the existence of a contract.
For example, in a sales contract (covered by the UCC), “open” terms—that is, those the parties have not agreed upon—do not require a court to rule that no contract was made.
However, open terms in a nonsales contract will frequently result in a ruling that there is no contract.
Second, although the common law of contracts applies to every person equally, under the UCC “merchants” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 304  occasionally receive special treatment.
By “merchants” the UCC means persons who have special knowledge or skill who deal in the goods involved in the transaction.
The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods A Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) was approved in 1980 at a diplomatic conference in Vienna.
(A convention is a preliminary agreement that serves as the basis for a formal treaty.)
The Convention has been adopted by several countries, including the United States.
The Convention is significant for three reasons.
First, the Convention is a uniform law governing the sale of goods—in effect, an international Uniform Commercial Code.
The major goal of the drafters was to produce a uniform law acceptable to countries with different legal, social and economic systems.
Second, although provisions in the Convention are generally consistent with the UCC, there are significant differences.
For instance, under the Convention, consideration (discussed below) is not required to form a contract and there is no Statute of Frauds (a requirement that some contracts be evidenced by a writing to be enforceable—also discussed below).
Finally, the Convention represents the first attempt by the US Senate to reform the private law of business through its treaty powers, for the Convention preempts the UCC if the parties to a contract elect to use the CISG.
Basic Contract Taxonomy Contracts are not all cut from the same die.
Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not.
Because contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts has developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences.
In general, contracts are classified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion.Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not party to it.
Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only one.
Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding.Completion considers whether the contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties.
We will examine each of these concepts in turn.
Explicitness Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 305  Express Contract An express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express contract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement.
For example, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an express contract.
Implied Contract An implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties.
Although no discussion of terms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they intended there be one.
A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract and is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made.
By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing to the price, whether posted or not.
Contract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract Both express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties.
Aquasi-contract, by contrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at the expense of another.
In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts created to prevent injustice.
Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired him to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him.
One Saturday morning he arrives at your doorstep and begins to work.
Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of having your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay his bill).
Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work.
Mutuality The garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises.
Each is both promisor and promisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge.
This type of contract is called a bilateral contract.
But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a contract.
Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend upon performance of the promise to be binding.
If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you wash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car.
Fran never makes a promise, but by actually performing she makes Charles Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 306  liable to pay.
A common example of a unilateral contract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but if she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50.
Enforceability Not every agreement between two people is a binding contract.
An agreement that is lacking one of the legal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all.
An agreement that is illegal—for example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void.
Neither party to a void “contract” may enforce it.
By contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other.
For example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; the adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain.
But the adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed.
(A contract may be voidable by both parties if both are minors.)
Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to their original condition.
Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car.
He delivers it to you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week.
He has the legal right to terminate the deal and recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him.
If you have already paid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs).
You must return the car to him; he must return the cash to you.
A voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided.
Thus, a contract with a minor remains in force unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it.
When the minor reaches his majority, he may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be voidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable.
An unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing.
For example, Tom owes Pete money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute of limitations has run out.
The contract for repayment is unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new promise to pay or actually pays part of the debt.
(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is entitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 307  Degree of Completion In medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept.
The courts gave relief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the debtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust.
But the issue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled.
Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a quantity of wheat in one month.
On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay.
The modem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John.
An agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is carried out.
Most executory contracts are enforceable.
If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, for example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed.
A contract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract.
KEY TAKEAWAYS Contract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to being born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies.
A contract is a legally enforceable promise.
The law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the Uniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention on the International Sale of Goods).
Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion.

8.2 Contract Formation LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the elements of common-law contracts: mutuality of agreement (offer and acceptance), consideration, legality, and capacity.
2.
Learn when a contract must be in writing—or evidenced by some writing—to be enforceable.
Although it has countless wrinkles and nuances, contract law asks two principal questions: did the parties create a valid, enforceable contract?
What remedies are available when one party breaks the contract?
The answer to the first question is not always obvious; the range of factors that must be taken into account can be large and their relationship subtle.
Since people in business frequently conduct contract negotiations without the assistance of a lawyer, it is important to attend to the nuances to avoid legal trouble at the outset.
Whether a valid enforceable contract has been formed depends in turn on whether: 1.
The parties reached an agreement (offer and acceptance); 2.
Consideration was present (some “price was paid for what was received in return); 3.
The agreement was legal; 4.
The parties entered into the contract with capacity to make a contract; and 5.
The agreement is in the proper form (something in writing, if required).
The Agreement: Offer and Acceptance The core of a legal contract is the agreement between the parties.
That is not merely a matter of convenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs.
As the great student of contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: It was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of a contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred.
Accordingly we find at the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent idea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract.
(1921, p. 365) Although agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section 2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and anacceptance.
Note, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 309  however, that not every agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is entirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract.
For example, people may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food rather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed.
One of the major functions of the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—from those that are not.
In interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard.
TheRestatement (Second) of Contracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one another.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what they thought they said or did.
The distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims he spoke in jest.
The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the Washington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked board.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to the company office, and demanded payment.
The company refused, claiming that the statement was made in jest (the audience before the commission had laughed when the offer was made).
The court disagreed, holding that it was reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of promoting punchboards: (I)f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable hearer would believe that an offer was being made, then the speaker risks the formation of a contract which was not intended.
It is the objective manifestations of the offeror that count and not secret, unexpressed intentions.
If a party’s words or acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree in regard to the matter in question, that agreement is established, and it is immaterial what may be the real but unexpressed state of the party’s mind on the subject.
[1] An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain such that it would be reasonable for another individual to conclude that assent to the offer would complete the bargain.
Offers Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 310  must be communicated and must be definite; that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can assent.
To constitute an agreement, there must be an acceptance of the offer.
The offeree must manifest his assent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer.
Complications arise when an offer is accepted indirectly through correspondence.
Although offers and revocations of offers are not effective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner specified by the offeror.
If the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the offeree uses a reasonable method of acceptance.
It is implied that the offeree can use the same means used by the offeror or a means of communication customary to the industry.
For example, the use of the postal service was so customary that acceptances are considered effective when mailed, regardless of the method used to transmit the offer.
Indeed, the so-called “mailbox rule” (the acceptance is effective upon dispatch) has an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two hundred years to the English courts.
[2] Consideration Consideration, is the quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) between the contracting parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the promise or promises made.
Consider the following three “contracts”: 1.
Betty offers to give a book to Lou.
Lou accepts.
2.
Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou’s promise to pay $15.
Lou accepts.
3.
Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick it up at Betty’s house.
Lou accepts.
The question is which, if any, is a binding contract?
In American law, only situation 2 is a binding contract, because only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which each party pledges to give up something to the benefit of the other.
The question of what constitutes a binding contract has been answered differently throughout history and in other cultures.
For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, whether or not there was consideration in our sense.
Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of gifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States.
And in the Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 311  was once sufficient to make a contract binding without any other consideration.
In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute for consideration, although in some states it creates a presumption of consideration.
The Uniform Commercial Code has abolished the seal on contracts for the sale of goods.
The existence of consideration is determined by examining whether the person against whom a promise is to be enforced (the promisor) received something in return from the person to whom he made the promise (the promisee).
That may seem a simple enough question.
But as with much in the law, the complicating situations are never very far away.
The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just be anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as alegal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee.
The detriment need not be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss.
At the same time, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee can agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor.
Whether consideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to make the bargain a fair one.
Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise contingent on an event that may never happen.
Consideration is a legalconcept, and it centers on the giving up of a legal right or benefit.
Consideration has two elements.
The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal detriment.
(Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the promisor is sufficient consideration.)
The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did the promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise?
Applying this two-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the second is there legally sufficient consideration.
In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no pledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting.
In the third example, what might appear to be such a promise is not really so.
Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou come to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift.
Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her house by promising the book.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 312  There is a widely recognized exception to the requirement of consideration.
In cases of promissory estoppel, the courts will enforce promises without consideration.
Simply stated, promissory estoppel means that the courts will stop the promisor from claiming that there was no consideration.
The doctrine of promissory estoppel is invoked in the interests of justice when three conditions are met: (1) the promise is one that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce the promisee to take action or forbear from taking action of a definite and substantial character; (2) the action or forbearance is taken; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise.
Timko served on the board of trustees of a school.
He recommended that the school purchase a building for a substantial sum of money, and to induce the trustees to vote for the purchase, he promised to help with the purchase and to pay at the end of five years the purchase price less the down payment.
At the end of four years, Timko died.
The school sued his estate, which defended on the ground that there was no consideration for the promise.
Timko was promised or given nothing in return, and the purchase of the building was of no direct benefit to him (which would have made the promise enforceable as a unilateral contract).
The court ruled that under the three-pronged promissory estoppel test, Timko’s estate was liable.
[3] Illegality In general, illegal contracts are unenforceable.
The courts must grapple with two types of illegalities: (1) statutory violations (e.g., the practice of law by a non-lawyer is forbidden by statute), and (2) violations of public policy not expressly declared unlawful by statute, but so declared by the courts.
Capacity A contract is a meeting of minds.
If someone lacks mental capacity to understand what he is assenting to—or that he is assenting to anything—it is unreasonable to hold him to the consequences of his act.
The general rule is that persons younger than eighteen can avoid their contracts.
Although the age of majority was lowered in most states during the 1970s to correspond to the Twenty-sixth Amendment (ratified in 1971, guaranteeing the right to vote at eighteen), some states still put the age of majority at twenty-one.
Legal rights for those under twenty-one remain ambiguous, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 313  however.
Although eighteen-year-olds may assent to binding contracts, not all creditors and landlords believe it, and they may require parents to cosign.
For those under twenty-one, there are also legal impediments to holding certain kinds of jobs, signing certain kinds of contracts, marrying, leaving home, and drinking alcohol.
There is as yet no uniform set of rules.
The exact day on which the disability of minority vanishes also varies.
The old common law rule put it on the day before the twenty-first birthday.
Many states have changed this rule so that majority commences on the day of the eighteenth (or twenty-first) birthday.
A minor’s contract is voidable, not void.
A child wishing to avoid the contract need do nothing positive to disaffirm; the defense of minority to a lawsuit is sufficient.
Although the adult cannot enforce the contract, the child can (which is why it is said to be voidable, not void).
When the minor becomes an adult, he has two choices: he may ratify the contract ordisaffirm it.
She may ratify explicitly; no further consideration is necessary.
She may also do so by implication—for instance, by continuing to make payments or retaining goods for an unreasonable period of time.
(In some states, a court may ratify the contract before the child becomes an adult.
In California, for example, a state statute permits a movie producer to seek court approval of a contract with a child actor in order to prevent the child from disaffirming it upon reaching majority and suing for additional wages.
As quid pro quo, the court can order the producer to pay a percentage of the wages into a trust fund that the child’s parents or guardians cannot invade.)
If the child has not disaffirmed the contract while still a minor, she may do so within a reasonable time after reaching majority.
In most cases of disavowal, the only obligation is to return the goods (if he still has them) or repay the consideration (unless it has been dissipated).
However, in two situations, a minor might incur greater liability: contracts for necessities and misrepresentation of age.
Contract for Necessities At common law, a “necessity” was defined as an essential need of a human being: food, medicine, clothing, and shelter.
In recent years, however, the courts have expanded the concept, so that in many states today necessities include property and services that will enable the minor to earn a living and to provide for those dependent on him.
If the contract is executory, the minor can simply disaffirm.
If the contract has been executed, however, the minor must face Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 314  more onerous consequences.
Although he will not be required to perform under the contract, he will be liable under a theory of “quasi-contract” for the reasonable value of the necessity.
Misrepresentation of Age In most states, a minor may misrepresent his age and disaffirm in accordance with the general rule, because that’s what kids do, misrepresent their age.
That the adult reasonably believed the minor was also an adult is of no consequence in a contract suit.
But some states have enacted statutes that make the minor liable in certain situations.
A Michigan statute, for instance, prohibits a minor from disaffirming if he has signed a “separate instrument containing only the statement of age, date of signing and the signature:” And some states “estop” him from claiming to be a minor if he falsely represented himself as an adult in making the ·contract.
“Estoppel” is a refusal by the courts on equitable grounds to listen to an otherwise valid defense; unless the minor can return the consideration, the contract will be enforced.
Contracts made by an insane or intoxicated person are also said to have been made by a person lacking capacity.
In general, such contracts are voidable by the person when capacity is regained (or by the person’s legal representative if capacity is not regained).
Form As a general rule, a contract need not be in writing to be enforceable.
An oral agreement to pay a high-fashion model $1 million to pose for a photograph is as binding as if the language of the deal were printed on vellum and signed in the presence of twenty bishops.
For centuries, however, a large exception has grown up around theStatute of Frauds, first enacted in England in 1677 under the formal name “An Act for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries.” The purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to prevent the fraud that occurs when one party attempts to impose upon another a contract that did not in fact exist.
The two sections dealing with contracts read as follows: [Sect.
4] ...no action shall be brought whereby to charge any executor or administrator upon any special promise, to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person; (3) or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage; (4) or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 315  concerning them; (5) or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof; (6) unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.
[Sect.
17] ...no contract for the sale of any goods, wares and merchandizes, for the price of ten pounds sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the goods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or in part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made and signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized.
Again, as may be evident from the title of the act and its language, the general purpose of the law is to provide evidence, in areas of some complexity and importance, that a contract was actually made.
To a lesser degree, the law serves to caution those about to enter a contract and “to create a climate in which parties often regard their agreements as tentative until there is a signed writing.” (Restatement (Second) of ContractsChapter 5, statutory note) The Statute of Frauds has been enacted in form similar to the seventeenth century act in most states.
However, in the twentieth century Section 7 was been replaced by a section Uniform Commercial Code.
The UCC requires contracts for the sale of goods for $500 or more and for the sale of securities to be in writing.
KEY TAKEAWAYS A contract requires mutuality—an offer and an acceptance of the offer; it requires consideration—a “price” paid for what is obtained; it requires that the parties to the contract have legal capacity to know what they are doing; it requires legality.
Certain contracts— governed by the statute of frauds—are required to be evidenced by some writing, signed by the party to be bound.
The purpose here is to avoid the fraud that occurs when one person attempts to impose upon another a contract that did not really exist.

8.3 Remedies LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Know the types of damages: compensatory and punitive.
2.
Understand specific performance as a remedy.
3.
Understand restitution as a remedy.
4.
Recognize the interplay between contract and tort as a cause of action.
Monetary awards (called “damages”), specific performance, and restitution are the three principle remedies.
In view of the importance given to the intention of the parties in forming and interpreting contracts, it may seem surprising that the remedy for every breach is not a judicial order that the obligor carry out his undertakings.
But it is not.
Of course, some duties cannot be performed after a breach: time and circumstances will have altered their purpose and rendered many worthless.
Still, although there are numerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out their contracts, the courts will not do it.
In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous line that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the promisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, though not the right, to breach a contract.
Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an incentive to break the contract.
In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay.
The purpose of contract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to put the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach.
Compensatory Damages Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 317  One party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of course, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that right.
Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non- breaching party whole.
Consequential Damages A basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to compensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the loss as a probable result of the breach.
The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common law, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854.
Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a flour mill in Gloucester.
In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling.
An employee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as possible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one.
The carrier’s agent promised delivery within two days.
But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than by rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days.
The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing director of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay.
In ordering a new trial, the Court of Exchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.
[1] This rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages for any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate it.
But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual course of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not cease.
[2] Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 318  This sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a foreseeable consequence of the breach.
For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he does a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the poor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on.
Nominal Damages If the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, called nominal damages.
When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same price as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in the event of breach.
Incidental Damages Suppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search.
After one year the professor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract.
If City College has to pay $5000 more to find a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages.
But what if it costs City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement?
City College can claim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching party after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful.
Punitive Damages Punitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in which criminal sanctions may be unavailable.
They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; they are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to deter others from acting similarly.
Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, punitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is also a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered.
Punitive damages are permitted in the law of torts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, deliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some kinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security under a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 319  contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor was not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort ofconversion.
Punitive damages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken.
Punitive damages are not fixed by law.
The judge or jury may award at its discretion whatever sum is believed necessary to redress the wrong or deter like conduct in the future.
This means that a richer person may be slapped with much heavier punitive damages than a poorer one in the appropriate case.
But the judge in all cases mayremit (lower) some or all of a punitive damage award if he or she considers it excessive.
Punitive damage claims have been made in cases dealing with the refusal by insurance companies to honor their contracts.
Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are charges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees.
California has been the leader among the state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints that the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless companies.
Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of contract.
Specific Performance Specific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which he obligated himself in a contract.
Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be issued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions.
(When the promisee is seeking enforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from doing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate remedy.)
Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental value because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother.
Emily then repudiates the contract while still executory.
A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily.
Specific performance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique item (real estate is always unique).
Restitution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 320  As the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other.
Therefore, only to the extent that the injured party conferred a benefit on the other party may the injured party be awarded restitution.
If the claimant has given the other party a sum of money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the restitution interest.
Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood.
Tim repudiates.
Tom’s restitution interest is $100.
But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance.
The courts have considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the injured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the property of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance.
Mellors, a gardener, agrees to construct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500.
After erecting three, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value.
Assume that he has increased the value of the Lady’s grounds by $800.
If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s restitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would have cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work.
Which measure to use depends on who repudiated the contract and for what reason.
Tort vs. Contract Remedies Frequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct.
A physician warrants her treatment as perfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life.
The patient could sue for malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract).
The choice involves at least four considerations: 1.
Statute of limitations.
Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort actions.
2.
Allowable damages.
Punitive damages are more often permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of injuries are compensable in tort but not in contract suits—for example, pain and suffering.
3.
Expert testimony.
In most cases, the use of experts would be the same in either tort or contract suits, but in certain contract cases, the expert witness could be dispensed with, as, for example, in a contract case charging that the physician abandoned the patient.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 321  4.
Insurance coverage.
Most policies do not cover intentional torts, so a contract theory that avoids the element of willfulness would provide the plaintiff with a surer chance of recovering money damages.
KEY TAKEAWAYS The purpose of remedies in contract is, usually, to put the non-breaching party in the position he or she would have been in had there been no breach.
The remedies are: compensatory damages (money paid to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses caused by the breach), which also include sub-categories of incidental and nominal damages; punitive damages (to punish the breaching party) are sometimes allowed where the breach is egregious and intentional.

8.4 Cases Objective Intention Lucy v. Zehmer 84 S.E.2d 516 (Va. 1954) Buchanan, J. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 322  This suit was instituted by W. O. Lucy and J. C. Lucy, complainants, against A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer, his wife, defendants, to have specific performance of a contract by which it was alleged the Zehmers had sold to W. O. Lucy a tract of land owned by A. H. Zehmer in Dinwiddie county containing 471.6 acres, more or less, known as the Ferguson farm, for $50,000.
J. C. Lucy, the other complainant, is a brother of W. O. Lucy, to whom W. O. Lucy transferred a half interest in his alleged purchase.
The instrument sought to be enforced was written by A. H. Zehmer on December 20, 1952, in these words: “We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer,” and signed by the defendants, A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer.
The answer of A. H. Zehmer admitted that at the time mentioned W. O. Lucy offered him $50,000 cash for the farm, but that he, Zehmer, considered that the offer was made in jest; that so thinking, and both he and Lucy having had several drinks, he wrote out “the memorandum” quoted above and induced his wife to sign it; that he did not deliver the memorandum to Lucy, but that Lucy picked it up, read it, put it in his pocket, attempted to offer Zehmer $5 to bind the bargain, which Zehmer refused to accept, and realizing for the first time that Lucy was serious, Zehmer assured him that he had no intention of selling the farm and that the whole matter was a joke.
Lucy left the premises insisting that he had purchased the farm.… In his testimony Zehmer claimed that he “was high as a Georgia pine,” and that the transaction “was just a bunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who could talk the biggest and say the most.” That claim is inconsistent with his attempt to testify in great detail as to what was said and what was done.… If it be assumed, contrary to what we think the evidence shows, that Zehmer was jesting about selling his farm to Lucy and that the transaction was intended by him to be a joke, nevertheless the evidence shows that Lucy did not so understand it but considered it to be a serious business transaction and the contract to be binding on the Zehmers as well as on himself.
The very next day he arranged with his brother to put up half the money and take a half interest in the land.
The day after that he employed an attorney to examine the title.
The next night, Tuesday, he was back at Zehmer’s place and there Zehmer told him for the first time, Lucy said, that he wasn’t Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 323  going to sell and he told Zehmer, “You know you sold that place fair and square.” After receiving the report from his attorney that the title was good he wrote to Zehmer that he was ready to close the deal.
Not only did Lucy actually believe, but the evidence shows he was warranted in believing, that the contract represented a serious business transaction and a good faith sale and purchase of the farm.
In the field of contracts, as generally elsewhere, “We must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention.
The law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.” At no time prior to the execution of the contract had Zehmer indicated to Lucy by word or act that he was not in earnest about selling the farm.
They had argued about it and discussed its terms, as Zehmer admitted, for a long time.
Lucy testified that if there was any jesting it was about paying $50,000 that night.
The contract and the evidence show that he was not expected to pay the money that night.
Zehmer said that after the writing was signed he laid it down on the counter in front of Lucy.
Lucy said Zehmer handed it to him.
In any event there had been what appeared to be a good faith offer and a good faith acceptance, followed by the execution and apparent delivery of a written contract.
Both said that Lucy put the writing in his pocket and then offered Zehmer $5 to seal the bargain.
Not until then, even under the defendants’ evidence, was anything said or done to indicate that the matter was a joke.
Both of the Zehmers testified that when Zehmer asked his wife to sign he whispered that it was a joke so Lucy wouldn’t hear and that it was not intended that he should hear.
The mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract.
If the words or other acts of one of the parties have but one reasonable meaning, his undisclosed intention is immaterial except when an unreasonable meaning which he attaches to his manifestations is known to the other party.
“* * * The law, therefore, judges of an agreement between two persons exclusively from those expressions of their intentions which are communicated between them.
* * *.” [Citation] Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 324  An agreement or mutual assent is of course essential to a valid contract but the law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.
If his words and acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree, it is immaterial what may be the real but unexpressed state of his mind.
So a person cannot set up that he was merely jesting when his conduct and words would warrant a reasonable person in believing that he intended a real agreement.
Whether the writing signed by the defendants and now sought to be enforced by the complainants was the result of a serious offer by Lucy and a serious acceptance by the defendants, or was a serious offer by Lucy and an acceptance in secret jest by the defendants, in either event it constituted a binding contract of sale between the parties.… Reversed and remanded.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
What objective evidence was there to support the defendants’ contention that they were just kidding when they agreed to sell the farm?
2.
Suppose the defendants really did think the whole thing was a kind of joke.
Would that make any difference?
3.
As a matter of public policy, why does the law use an objective standard to determine the seriousness of intention, instead of a subjective standard?

Consideration: Preexisting Obligation Denney v. Reppert 432 S.W.2d 647 (Ky. 1968) R. L. Myre, Sr., Special Commissioner.
The sole question presented in this case is which of several claimants is entitled to an award for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of certain bank robbers.… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 325  On June 12th or 13th, 1963, three armed men entered the First State Bank, Eubank, Kentucky, and with a display of arms and threats robbed the bank of over $30,000 [about $208,000 in 2010 dollars].
Later in the day they were apprehended by State Policemen Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert, placed under arrest, and the entire loot was recovered.
Later all of the prisoners were convicted and Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert appeared as witnesses at the trial.
The First State Bank of Eubank was a member of the Kentucky Bankers Association which provided and advertised a reward of $500.00 for the arrest and conviction of each bank robber.
Hence the outstanding reward for the three bank robbers was $1,500.00 [about $11,000 in 2010 dollars].
Many became claimants for the reward and the Kentucky State Bankers Association being unable to determine the merits of the claims for the reward asked the circuit court to determine the merits of the various claims and to adjudge who was entitled to receive the reward or share in it.
All of the claimants were made defendants in the action.
At the time of the robbery the claimants Murrell Denney, Joyce Buis, Rebecca McCollum and Jewell Snyder were employees of the First State Bank of Eubank and came out of the grueling situation with great credit and glory.
Each one of them deserves approbation and an accolade.
They were vigilant in disclosing to the public and the peace officers the details of the crime, and in describing the culprits, and giving all the information that they possessed that would be useful in capturing the robbers.
Undoubtedly, they performed a great service.
It is in the evidence that the claimant Murrell Denney was conspicuous and energetic in his efforts to make known the robbery, to acquaint the officers as to the personal appearance of the criminals, and to give other pertinent facts.
The first question for determination is whether the employees of the robbed bank are eligible to receive or share in the reward.
The great weight of authority answers in the negative.
[Citation] states the rule thusly: ‘To the general rule that, when a reward is offered to the general public for the performance of some specified act, such reward may be claimed by any person who performs such act, is the exception of agents, employees and public officials who are acting within the scope of their employment or official duties.
* * *.’… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 326  At the time of the robbery the claimants Murrell Denney, Joyce Buis, Rebecca McCollum, and Jewell Snyder were employees of the First State Bank of Eubank.
They were under duty to protect and conserve the resources and moneys of the bank, and safeguard every interest of the institution furnishing them employment.
Each of these employees exhibited great courage, and cool bravery, in a time of stress and danger.
The community and the county have recompensed them in commendation, admiration and high praise, and the world looks on them as heroes.
But in making known the robbery and assisting in acquainting the public and the officers with details of the crime and with identification of the robbers, they performed a duty to the bank and the public, for which they cannot claim a reward.
The claims of Corbin Reynolds, Julia Reynolds, Alvie Reynolds and Gene Reynolds also must fail.
According to their statements they gave valuable information to the arresting officers.
However, they did not follow the procedure as set forth in the offer of reward in that they never filed a claim with the Kentucky Bankers Association.
It is well established that a claimant of a reward must comply with the terms and conditions of the offer of reward.
[Citation] State Policemen Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert made the arrest of the bank robbers and captured the stolen money.
All participated in the prosecution.
At the time of the arrest, it was the duty of the state policemen to apprehend the criminals.
Under the law they cannot claim or share in the reward and they are interposing no claim to it.
This leaves the defendant, Tilford Reppert the sole eligible claimant.
The record shows that at the time of the arrest he was a deputy sheriff in Rockcastle County, but the arrest and recovery of the stolen money took place in Pulaski County.
He was out of his jurisdiction, and was thus under no legal duty to make the arrest, and is thus eligible to claim and receive the reward.
In [Citation] it was said: ‘It is * * * well established that a public officer with the authority of the law to make an arrest may accept an offer of reward or compensation for acts or services performed outside of his bailiwick or not within the scope of his official duties.
* * *.’… It is manifest from the record that Tilford Reppert is the only claimant qualified and eligible to receive the reward.
Therefore, it is the judgment of the circuit court that he is entitled to receive payment of the $1,500.00 reward now deposited with the Clerk of this Court.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 327  The judgment is affirmed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Why did the Bankers Association put the resolution of this matter into the court’s hands?
2.
Several claimants came forward for the reward; only one person got it.
What was the difference between the person who got the reward and those who did not?
Consequential Damages EBWS, LLC v. Britly Corp. 928 A.2d 497 (Vt. 2007) Reiber, C.J.
The Ransom family owns Rock Bottom Farm in Strafford, Vermont, where Earl Ransom owns a dairy herd and operates an organic dairy farm.
In 2000, the Ransoms decided to build a creamery on-site to process their milk and formed EBWS, LLC to operate the dairy-processing plant and to market the plant’s products.
In July 2000, Earl Ransom, on behalf of EBWS, met with Britly’s president to discuss building the creamery.…In January 2001, EBWS and Britly entered into a contract requiring Britly to construct a creamery building for EBWS in exchange for $160,318.…The creamery was substantially completed by April 15, 2001, and EBWS moved in soon afterward.
On June 5, 2001, EBWS notified Britly of alleged defects in construction.
[EBWS continued to use the creamery pending the necessity to vacate it for three weeks when repairs were commenced].
On September 12, 2001, EBWS filed suit against Britly for damages resulting from defective design and construction.… Following a three-day trial, the jury found Britly had breached the contract and its express warranty, and awarded EBWS: (1) $38,020 in direct damages, and (2) $35,711 in consequential damages.… …The jury’s award to EBWS included compensation for both direct and consequential damages that EBWS claimed it would incur while the facility closed for repairs.
Direct damages [i.e., compensatory damages] are for “losses that naturally and usually flow from the breach itself,” and it is not necessary that the parties actually considered these damages.
[Citation].
In comparison, special or consequential damages “must pass the tests of causation, certainty and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 328  foreseeability, and, in addition, be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract.” …The court ruled that EBWS could not recover for lost profits because it was not a going concern at the time the contract was entered into, and profits were too speculative.
The court concluded, however, that EBWS could submit evidence of other business losses, including future payment for unused milk and staff wages.… At trial, Huyffer, the CEO of EBWS, testified that during a repairs closure the creamery would be required to purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom Farm, even though it could not process this milk.
She admitted that such a requirement was self-imposed as there was no written output contract between EBWS and the farm to buy milk.
In addition, Huyffer testified that EBWS would pay its employees during the closure even though EBWS has no written contract to pay its employees when they are not working.
The trial court allowed these elements of damages to be submitted to the jury, and the jury awarded EBWS consequential damages for unused milk and staff wages.
On appeal, Britly contends that because there is no contractual or legal obligation for EBWS to purchase milk or pay its employees, these are not foreseeable damages.
EBWS counters that it is common knowledge that cows continue to produce milk, even if the processing plant is not working, and thus it is foreseeable that this loss would occur.
We conclude that these damages are not the foreseeable result of Britly’s breach of the construction contract and reverse the award.… [W]e conclude that…it is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee that its failure to perform under the contract would result in this type of damages.
While we are sympathetic to EBWS’s contention that the cows continue to produce milk, even when the plant is closed down, this fact alone is not enough to demonstrate that buying and dumping milk is a foreseeable result of Britly’s breach of the construction contract.
Here, the milk was produced by a separate and distinct entity, Rock Bottom Farm, which sold the milk to EBWS.… Similarly, EBWS maintained no employment agreements with its employees obligating it to pay wages during periods of closure for repairs, dips in market demand, or for any other reason.
Any losses EBWS might suffer in the future because it chooses to pay its employees during a plant Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 329  closure for repairs would be a voluntary expense and not in Britly’s contemplation at the time it entered the construction contract.
It is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee losses incurred as a result of agreements that are informal in nature and carry no legal obligation on EBWS to perform.
“[P]arties are not presumed to know the condition of each other’s affairs nor to take into account contracts with a third party that is not communicated.” [Citation] While it is true that EBWS may have business reasons to pay its employees even without a contractual obligation, for example, to ensure employee loyalty, no evidence was introduced at trial by EBWS to support a sound rationale for such considerations.
Under these circumstances, this business decision is beyond the scope of what Britly could have reasonably foreseen as damages for its breach of contract.… In addition, the actual costs of the wages and milk are uncertain.…[T]he the milk and wages here are future expenses, for which no legal obligation was assumed by EBWS, and which are separate from the terms of the parties’ contract.
We note that at the time of the construction contract EBWS had not yet begun to operate as a creamery and had no history of buying milk or paying employees.
See [Citation] (explaining that profits for a new business are uncertain and speculative and not recoverable).
Thus, both the cost of the milk and the number and amount of wages of future employees that EBWS might pay in the event of a plant closure for repairs are uncertain.
Award for consequential damages is reversed.… CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Why, according to EBWS’s CEO, would EBWS be required to purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom Farm, even though it could not process this milk?
2.
Surely it is well known in Vermont dairy country that dairy farmers can’t simply stop milking cows when no processing plant is available to take the milk—the cows will soon stop producing.
Why was EBWS then not entitled to those damages which it will certainly suffer when the creamery is down for repairs?
3.
Britly (the contractor) must have known EBWS had employees that would be idled when the creamery shut down for repairs.
Why was it not liable for their lost wages?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 330  4.
What could EBWS have done at the time of contracting to protect itself against the damages it would incur in the event the creamery suffered downtime due to faulty construction?
8.5 Summary and Exercises Summary In this chapter we have seen that two fundamental sources of contract law are the common law as developed in the state courts and as summarized in theRestatement (Second) of Contracts, and the Uniform Commercial Code for the sale of goods.
Sales law is a special type of contract law, governed by Article 2 of the UCC.
Article 2 governs the sale of goods only, defined as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale.
When the goods are “sold” incidental to a service, the courts do not agree on whether Article 2 applies.
For two categories of goods, legislation specifically answers the question: foodstuffs served by a restaurant are goods; blood supplied for transfusions is not.
Types of contracts can be distinguished along these axes: (1) express and implied, including quasi-contracts implied by law; (2) bilateral and unilateral; (3) enforceable and unenforceable; and (4) completed (executed) and uncompleted (executory).
To understand contract law, it is necessary to master these distinctions and their nuances.
In order to determine whether a valid, enforceable contract exists, the following questions must be answered: (1) Did the parties reach an agreement?
(2) Was consideration present?
(3) Was the agreement legal?
(4) Did the parties have capacity to make a contract?
(5) Was the agreement in the proper form?
Remedies available against someone who breaches a contract include damages, specific performance, and restitution.
Frequently the party who is not in breach must choose between tort and contract remedies.

Sara Hohe, a fifteen-year-old junior at Mission Bay High School in San Diego, was injured during a campus hypnotism show sponsored by the PTSA as a fund-raiser for the senior class.
Hypnotism shows had been held annually since 1980, and Sara had seen the previous year’s show.
She was selected at random from a group of many volunteers.
Her participation in the “Magic of the Mind Show” was conditioned on signing two release forms.
Hohe’s father signed a form entitled “Mission Bay High School PTSA Presents Dr. Karl Santo.” Hohe and her father both signed a form titled “Karl Santo Hypnotist,” releasing Santo and the school district from all liability.
During the course of the show, while apparently hypnotized, Hohe slid from her chair and also fell to the floor about six times and was injured.
She, through her father, then sued the school district.
The Hohes claimed the release was contrary to public policy; the trial court dismissed the suit on summary judgment.
Was the release contrary to public policy?

Plaintiff Irma Kozlowski cohabited with Defendant Thaddeus Kozlowski for fifteen years without marriage.
She repeatedly asked him specifically about her financial situation should he predecease her, and he assured her—she said—that he would arrange to provide for her for the rest of her life.
She had provided the necessary household services and emotional support to permit him to successfully pursue his business career; she had performed housekeeping, cleaning, and shopping services and had run the household and raised the children, her own as well as his.
When they separated and she was “literally forced out of the house,” she was sixty-three years old and had no means or wherewithal for survival.
When she sued, he raised the Statute of Frauds’ one-year rule as a defense.
Is the defense good?

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 335  9.1 The General Nature of Property Rights LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the elastic and evolving boundaries of what the law recognizes as property that can be bought or sold on the market.
2.
Distinguish real property from personal property.
Definition of Property Property, which seems like a commonsense concept, is difficult to define in an intelligible way; philosophers have been striving to define it for the past 2,500 years.
To say that “property is what we own” is to beg the question—that is, to substitute a synonym for the word we are trying to define.
Blackstone’s famous definition is somewhat wordy: “The right of property is that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.
It consists in the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of all a person’s acquisitions, without any control or diminution save only by the laws of the land.” A more concise definition, but perhaps too broad, comes from the Restatement of the Law of Property, which defines property as the “legal relationship between persons with respect to a thing.” The Restatement’s definition makes an important point: property is a legal relationship, the power of one person to use objects in ways that affect others, to exclude others from the property, and to acquire and transfer property.
Still, this definition does not contain a specific list of those nonhuman “objects” that could be in such a relationship.
We all know that we can own personal objects like iPods and DVDs, and even more complex objects like homes and minerals under the ground.
Property also embraces objects whose worth is representative or symbolic: ownership of stock in a corporation is valued not for the piece of paper called a stock certificate but for dividends, the power to vote for directors, and the right to sell the stock on the open market.
Wholly intangible things or objects like copyrights and patents and bank accounts are capable of being owned as property.
But the list of things that can be property is not fixed, for our concept of property continues to evolve.
Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 336  structured investment vehicles (SIVs), prime players in the subprime mortgage crisis, were not on anyone’s list of possible property even fifteen years ago.
The Economist’s View Property is not just a legal concept, of course, and different disciplines express different philosophies about the purpose of property and the nature of property rights.
To the jurist, property rights should be protected because it is just to do so.
To an economist, the legal protection of property rights functions to create incentives to use resources efficiently.
For a truly efficient system of property rights, some economists would require universality (everything is owned), exclusivity (the owners of each thing may exclude all others from using it), and transferability (owners may exchange their property).
Together, these aspects of property would lead, under an appropriate economic model, to efficient production and distribution of goods.
But the law of property does not entirely conform to the economic conception of the ownership of productive property by private parties; there remain many kinds of property that are not privately owned and some parts of the earth that are considered part of “the commons.” For example, large areas of the earth’s oceans are not “owned” by any one person or nation-state, and certain land areas (e.g., Yellowstone National Park) are not in private hands.
Classification of Property Property can be classified in various ways, including tangible versus intangible, private versus public, and personal versus real.
Tangible property is that which physically exists, like a building, a popsicle stand, a hair dryer, or a steamroller.Intangible property is something without physical reality that entitles the owner to certain benefits; stocks, bonds, and intellectual property would be common examples.Public property is that which is owned by any branch of government;private property is that which is owned by anyone else, including a corporation.
Perhaps the most important distinction is between real and personal property.
Essentially, real property is immovable; personal property is movable.
At common law, personal property has been referred to as “chattels.” When chattels become affixed to real property in a certain manner, they are called fixtures and are treated as real property.
(For example, a bathroom cabinet purchased at Home Depot and screwed into the bathroom wall may be Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 337  converted to part of the real property when it is affixed.)
Fixtures are discussed in Section 9.3 "Fixtures" of this chapter.
Importance of the Distinction between Real and Personal Property In our legal system, the distinction between real and personal property is significant in several ways.
For example, the sale of personal property, but not real property, is governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).
Real estate transactions, by contrast, are governed by the general law of contracts.
Suppose goods are exchanged for realty.
Section 2-304 of the UCC says that the transfer of the goods and the seller’s obligations with reference to them are subject to Article 2, but not the transfer of the interests in realty nor the transferor’s obligations in connection with them.
The form of transfer depends on whether the property is real or personal.
Real property is normally transferred by a deed, which must meet formal requirements dictated by state law.
By contrast, transfer of personal property often can take place without any documents at all.
Another difference can be found in the law that governs the transfer of property on death.
A person’s heirs depend on the law of the state for distribution of his property if he dies intestate— that is, without a will.
Who the heirs are and what their share of the property will be may depend on whether the property is real or personal.
For example, widows may be entitled to a different percentage of real property than personal property when their husbands die intestate.
Tax laws also differ in their approach to real and personal property.
In particular, the rules of valuation, depreciation, and enforcement depend on the character of the property.
Thus real property depreciates more slowly than personal property, and real property owners generally have a longer time than personal property owners to make good unpaid taxes before the state seizes the property.
KEY TAKEAWAY Property is difficult to define conclusively, and there are many different classifications of property.
There can be public property as well as private property, tangible property as well as intangible property, and, most importantly, real property as well as personal property.
These are important distinctions, with many legal consequences.

When can private property become public property?
Does public property ever become private property?
9.2 Personal Property LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Explain the various ways that personal property can be acquired by means other than purchase.
Most legal issues about personal property center on its acquisition.
Acquisition by purchase is the most common way we acquire personal property, but there are at least five other ways to legally acquire personal property: (1) possession, (2) finding lost or misplaced property, (3) gift, (4) accession, and (5) confusion.
Possession It is often said that “possession is nine-tenths of the law.” There is an element of truth to this, but it’s not the whole truth.
For our purposes, the more important question is, what is meant by “possession”?
Its meaning is not intuitively obvious, as a moment’s reflection will reveal.
For example, you might suppose than you possess something when it is physically within your control, but what do you say when a hurricane deposits a boat onto your land?
What if you are not even home when this happens?
Do you possess the boat?
Ordinarily, we would say that you don’t, because you don’t have physical control when you are absent.
You may not even have the intention to control the boat; perhaps instead of a fancy speedboat in relatively good shape, the boat is a rust bucket badly in need of repair, and you want it removed from your front yard.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 339  Even the element of physical domination of the object may not be necessary.
Suppose you give your new class ring to a friend to examine.
Is it in the friend’s possession?
No: the friend has custody, not possession, and you retain the right to permit a second friend to take it from her hands.
This is different from the case of a bailment, in which the bailor gives possession of an object to the bailee.
For example, a garage (a bailee) entrusted with a car for the evening, and not the owner, has the right to exclude others from the car; the owner could not demand that the garage attendants refrain from moving the car around as necessary.
From these examples, we can see that possession or physical control must usually be understood as the power to exclude others from using the object.
Otherwise, anomalies arise from the difficulty of physically controlling certain objects.
It is more difficult to exercise control over a one-hundred-foot television antenna than a diamond ring.
Moreover, in what sense do you possess your household furniture when you are out of the house?
Only, we suggest, in the power to exclude others.
But this power is not purely a physical one: being absent from the house, you could not physically restrain anyone.
Thus the concept of possession must inevitably be mixed with legal rules that do or could control others.
Possession confers ownership in a restricted class of cases only: when no person was the owner at the time the current owner took the object into his possession.
The most obvious categories of objects to which this rule of possession applies are wild animals and abandoned goods.
The rule requires that the would-be owner actually take possession of the animal or goods; the hunter who is pursuing a particular wild animal has no legal claim until he has actually captured it.
Two hunters are perfectly free to pursue the same animal, and whoever actually grabs it will be the owner.
But even this simple rule is fraught with difficulties in the case of both wild animals and abandoned goods.
We examine abandoned goods in Section 9.2.2 "Lost or Misplaced Property".
In the case of wild game, fish in a stream, and the like, the general rule is subject to the rights of the owner of the land on which the animals are caught.
Thus even if the animals caught by a hunter are wild, as long as they are on another’s land, the landowner’s rights are superior to the hunter’s.
Suppose a hunter captures a wild animal, which subsequently escapes, and a second Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 340  hunter thereafter captures it.
Does the first hunter have a claim to the animal?
The usual rule is that he does not, for once an animal returns to the wild, ownership ceases.
Lost or Misplaced Property At common law, a technical distinction arose between lost and misplaced property.
An object is lost if the owner inadvertently and unknowingly lets it out of his possession.
It is merely misplaced if the owner intentionally puts it down, intending to recover it, even if he subsequently forgets to retrieve it.
These definitions are important in considering the old saying “Finders keepers, losers weepers.” This is a misconception that is, at best, only partially true, and more often false.
The following hierarchy of ownership claims determines the rights of finders and losers.
First, the owner is entitled to the return of the property unless he has intentionally abandoned it.
The finder is said to be a quasi-bailee for the true owner, and as bailee she owes the owner certain duties of care.
The finder who knows the owner or has reasonable means of discovering the owner’s identity commits larceny if she holds on to the object with the intent that it be hers.
This rule applies only if the finder actually takes the object into her possession.
For example, if you spot someone’s wallet on the street you have no obligation to pick it up; but if you do pick it up and see the owner’s name in it, your legal obligation is to return it to the rightful owner.
The finder who returns the object is not automatically entitled to a reward, but if the loser has offered a reward, the act of returning it constitutes performance of a unilateral contract.
Moreover, if the finder has had expenses in connection with finding the owner and returning the property, she is entitled to reasonable reimbursement as a quasi-bailee.
But the rights of the owner are frequently subject to specific statutes, such as the one discussed in Bishop v. Ellsworth in Section 9.4.1 "Lost or Misplaced Property".
Second, if the owner fails to claim the property within the time allowed by statute or has abandoned it, then the property goes to the owner of the real estate on which it was found if (1) the finder was a trespasser, (2) the goods are found in a private place (though what exactly constitutes a private place is open to question: is the aisle of a grocery store a private place?
the back of the food rack?
the stockroom?
), (3) the goods are buried, or (4) the goods are misplaced rather than lost.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 341  If none of these conditions apply, then the finder is the owner.
These rules are considered in the Bishop case, (see Section 9.4.1 "Lost or Misplaced Property").
Gift A gift is a voluntary transfer of property without consideration or compensation.
It is distinguished from a sale, which requires consideration.
It is distinguished from a promise to give, which is a declaration of an intention to give in the future rather than a present transfer.
It is distinguished from a testamentary disposition (will), which takes effect only upon death, not upon the preparation of the documents.
Two other distinctions are worth noting.
An inter vivos (enter VYE vos) gift is one made between living persons without conditions attached.
A causa mortis (KAW zuh mor duz) gift is made by someone contemplating death in the near future.
Requirements Figure 9.1 Gift Requirements To make an effective gift inter vivos or causa mortis, the law imposes three requirements: (1) the donor must deliver a deed or object to the donee; (2) the donor must actually intend to make a gift, and (3) the donee must accept (see Figure 9.1 "Gift Requirements").
Delivery Although it is firmly established that the object be delivered, it is not so clear what constitutes delivery.
On the face of it, the requirement seems to be that the object must be transferred to the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 342  donee’s possession.
Suppose your friend tells you he is making a gift to you of certain books that are lying in a locked trunk.
If he actually gives you the trunk so that you can carry it away, a gift has been made.
Suppose, however, that he had merely given you the key, so that you could come back the next day with your car.
If this were the sole key, the courts would probably construe the transfer of the key as possession of the trunk.
Suppose, instead, that the books were in a bank vault and the friend made out a legal document giving both you and him the power to take from the bank vault.
This would not be a valid gift, since he retained power over the goods.
Intent The intent to make a gift must be an intent to give the property at the present time, not later.
For example, suppose a person has her savings account passbook put in her name and a friend’s name, intending that on her death the friend will be able to draw out whatever money is left.
She has not made a gift, because she did not intend to give the money when she changed the passbook.
The intent requirement can sometimes be sidestepped if legal title to the object is actually transferred, postponing to the donee only the use or enjoyment of the property until later.
Had the passbook been made out in the name of the donee only and delivered to a third party to hold until the death of the donor, then a valid gift may have been made.
Although it is sometimes difficult to discern this distinction in practice, a more accurate statement of the rule of intent is this: Intention to give in the future does not constitute the requisite intent, whereas present gifts of future interests will be upheld.
Acceptance In the usual case, the rule requiring acceptance poses no difficulties.
A friend hands you a new book and says, “I would like you to have this.” Your taking the book and saying “thank-you” is enough to constitute your acceptance.
But suppose that the friend had given you property without your knowing it.
For example, a secret admirer puts her stock certificates jointly in your name and hers without telling you.
Later, you marry someone else, and she asks you to transfer the certificates back to her name.
This is the first you have heard of the transaction.
Has a gift been made?
The usual answer is that even though you had not accepted the stock when the name change was made, the transaction was a gift that took effect immediately, subject to your right to repudiate when you find out about it.
If you do not reject the gift, you have joint rights in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 343  the stock.
But if you expressly refuse to accept a gift or indicate in some manner that you might not have accepted it, then the gift is not effective.
For example, suppose you are running for office.
A lobbyist whom you despise gives you a donation.
If you refuse the money, no gift has been made.
Gifts Causa Mortis Even though the requirements of delivery, intent, and acceptance apply to gifts causa mortis as well as inter vivos, a gift causa mortis (one made in contemplation of death) may be distinguished from a gift inter vivos on other grounds.
The difference between the two lies in the power of the donor to revoke the gift before he dies; in other words, the gift is conditional on his death.
Since the law does not permit gifts that take place in the future contingent on some happening, how can it be that a gift causa mortis is effective?
The answer lies in the nature of the transfer: the donee takes actual title when the gift is made; should the donor not in fact die or should he revoke the gift before he dies, then and only then will the donee lose title.
The difference is subtle and amounts to the difference between saying “If I die, the watch is yours” and “The watch is yours, unless I survive.” In the former case, known as a condition precedent, there is no valid gift; in the latter case, known as a condition subsequent, the gift is valid.
Gifts to Minors Every state has adopted either the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), both of which establish the manner by which irrevocable gifts are made to minors.
Under these acts, a custodian holds the gifts until the minor reaches the age of eighteen, twenty-one, or twenty-five, depending on state law.
Gifts under UGMA are limited for the most part to money or securities, while UTMA allows other types of gifts as well, such as real estate or tangible personal property.
Gift Tax The federal government and many states impose gift taxes on gifts above a certain dollar amount.
We discuss gift taxes in connection with estate taxes in Chapter 14 "Estate Planning: Wills, Estates, and Trusts".
Accession Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 344  An accession is something that is added to what one already possesses.
In general, the rule is that the owner of the thing owns the additional thing that comes to be attached to it.
For example, the owner of a cow owns her calves when she gives birth.
But when one person adds value to another person’s property, either through labor alone or by adding new materials, the rule must be stated somewhat differently.
The general rule is this: when goods are added to goods, the owner of the principal goods becomes the owner of the enhanced product.
For example, a garage uses its paint to repaint its customer’s automobile.
The car owner, not the painter, is the owner of the finished product.
When someone has wrongfully converted—that is, taken as her own—the property of another, the owner may sue for damages, either to recover his property or its value.
But a problem arises when the converter has added to the value of that property.
In general, the courts hold that when the conversion is willful, the owner is entitled to the full value of the goods as enhanced by the converter.
Suppose that a carpenter enters a ten-acre forest that he knows belongs to his neighbor, cuts down one hundred trees, transports them to his shop, and cuts them up into standard lumber, thus increasing their market value.
The owner is entitled to this full value, and the carpenter will get nothing for his trouble.
Thus the willful converter loses the value of his labor or materials.
If, on the other hand, the conversion was innocent, or at most negligent, the rule is somewhat more uncertain.
Generally the courts will award the forest owner the value of the standing timber, giving the carpenter the excess attributable to his labor and transportation.
A more favorable treatment of the owner is to give her the full value of the lumber as cut, remitting to the carpenter the value of his expenses.
Confusion In accession, the goods of one owner are transformed into a more valuable commodity or are inextricably united with the goods of another to form a constituent part.
Still another type of joining is known as confusion, and it occurs when goods of different owners, while maintaining their original form, are commingled.
A common example is the intermingling of grain in a silo.
But goods that are identifiable as belonging to a particular person—branded cattle, for instance—are not confused, no matter how difficult it may be to separate herds that have been put together.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 345  When the goods are identical, no particular problem of division arises.
Assuming that each owner can show how much he has contributed to the confused mass, he is entitled to that quantity, and it does not matter which particular grains or kernels he extracts.
So if a person, seeing a container of grain sitting on the side of the road, mistakes it for his own and empties it into a larger container in his truck, the remedy is simply to restore a like quantity to the original owner.
When owners of like substances consent to have those substances combined (such as in a grain silo), they are said to be tenants in common, holding a proportional share in the whole.
In the case of willful confusion of goods, many courts hold that the wrongdoer forfeits all his property unless he can identify his particular property.
Other courts have modified this harsh rule by shifting the burden of proof to the wrongdoer, leaving it up to him to claim whatever he can establish was his.
If he cannot establish what was his, then he will forfeit all.
Likewise, when the defendant has confused the goods negligently, without intending to do so, most courts will tend to shift to the defendant the burden of proving how much of the mass belongs to him.
KEY TAKEAWAY Other than outright purchase of personal property, there are various ways in which to acquire legal title.
Among these are possession, gift, accession, confusion, and finding property that is abandoned, lost, or mislaid, especially if the abandoned, lost, or mislaid property is found on real property that you own.

9.3 Fixtures Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 346  LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Know the three tests for when personal property becomes a fixture and thus becomes real property.
Definition A fixture is an object that was once personal property but that has become so affixed to land or structures that it is considered legally a part of the real property.
For example, a stove bolted to the floor of a kitchen and connected to the gas lines is usually considered a fixture, either in a contract for sale, or for testamentary transfer (by will).
For tax purposes, fixtures are treated as real property.
Tests Figure 9.2 Fixture Tests Obviously, no clear line can be drawn between what is and what is not a fixture.
In general, the courts look to three tests to determine whether a particular object has become a fixture: annexation, adaptation, and intention (see Figure 9.2 "Fixture Tests").
Annexation The object must be annexed or affixed to the real property.
A door on a house is affixed.
Suppose the door is broken and the owner has purchased a new door made to fit, but the house is sold before the new door is installed.
Most courts would consider that new door a fixture under a rule of constructive annexation.
Sometimes courts have said that an item is a fixture if its removal would damage the real property, but this test is not always followed.
Must the object be attached with nails, screws, glue, bolts, or some other physical device?
In one case, the court held that a four-ton statue was sufficiently affixed merely by its weight.
[1] Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 347  Adaptation Another test is whether the object is adapted to the use or enjoyment of the real property.
Examples are home furnaces, power equipment in a mill, and computer systems in bank buildings.
Intention Recent decisions suggest that the controlling test is whether the person who actually annexes the object intends by so doing to make it a permanent part of the real estate.
The intention is usually deduced from the circumstances, not from what a person might later say her intention was.
If an owner installs a heating system in her house, the law will presume she intended it as a fixture because the installation was intended to benefit the house; she would not be allowed to remove the heating system when she sold the house by claiming that she had not intended to make it a fixture.
Fixture Disputes Because fixtures have a hybrid nature (once personal property, subsequently real property), they generate a large number of disputes.
We have already examined disputes between mortgagees and secured parties (Chapter 16 "Secured Transactions and Suretyship").
Two other types of disputes are discussed here.
Transfer of Real Estate When a homeowner sells her house, the problem frequently crops up as to whether certain items in the home have been sold or may be removed by the seller.
Is a refrigerator, which simply plugs into the wall, a fixture or an item of personal property?
If a dispute arises, the courts will apply the three tests—annexation, adaptation, and intention.
Of course, the simplest way of avoiding the dispute is to incorporate specific reference to questionable items in the contract for sale, indicating whether the buyer or the seller is to keep them.
Tenant’s Fixtures Tenants frequently install fixtures in the buildings they rent or the property they occupy.
A company may install tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment; a tenant in an apartment may bolt a bookshelf into the wall or install shades over a window.
Who owns the fixtures when the tenant’s lease expires?
The older rule was that any fixture, determined by the usual tests, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 348  must remain with the landlord.
Today, however, certain types of fixtures—known as tenant’s fixtures—stay with the tenant.
These fall into three categories: (1) trade fixtures— articles placed on the premises to enable the tenant to carry on his or her trade or business in the rented premises; (2) agricultural fixtures—devices installed to carry on farming activities (e.g., milling plants and silos); (3) domestic fixtures—items that make a tenant’s personal life more comfortable (carpeting, screens, doors, washing machines, bookshelves, and the like).
The three types of tenant’s fixtures remain personal property and may be removed by the tenant if the following three conditions are met: (1) They must be installed for the requisite purposes of carrying on the trade or business or the farming or agricultural pursuits or for making the home more comfortable, (2) they must be removable without causing substantial damage to the landlord’s property, and (3) they must be removed before the tenant turns over possession of the premises to the landlord.
Again, any debatable points can be resolved in advance by specifying them in the written lease.
KEY TAKEAWAY Personal property is often converted to real property when it is affixed to real property.
There are three tests that courts use to determine whether a particular object has become a fixture and thus has become real property: annexation, adaptation, and intention.
Disputes over fixtures often arise in the transfer of real property and in landlord-tenant relations.

Clara thinks that the decorative chandelier in the entryway is lovely and gives the house an immediate appeal.
The chandelier was a gift from Donna’s mother, “to enhance the entryway” and provide “a touch of beauty” for Jim and Donna’s house.
Clem and Clara assume that the chandelier will stay, and nothing specific is mentioned about the chandelier in the contract for sale.
Clem and Clara are shocked when they move in and find the chandelier is gone.
Have Jim and Donna breached their contract of sale?
2.
Blaine Goodfellow rents a house from Associated Properties in Abilene, Texas.
He is there for two years, and during that time he installs a ceiling fan, custom-builds a bookcase for an alcove on the main floor, and replaces the screening on the front and back doors, saving the old screening in the furnace room.
When his lease expires, he leaves, and the bookcase Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 349  remains behind.
Blaine does, however, take the new screening after replacing it with the old screening, and he removes the ceiling fan and puts back the light.
He causes no damage to Associated Properties’ house in doing any of this.
Discuss who is the rightful owner of the screening, the bookcase, and the ceiling fan after the lease expires.

9.4 Case Lost or Misplaced Property Bishop v. Ellsworth 91 Ill. App.2d 386, 234 N.E.
2d 50 (1968) OPINION BY: STOUDER, Presiding Justice Dwayne Bishop, plaintiff, filed a complaint alleging that on July 21, 1965, defendants, Mark and Jeff Ellsworth and David Gibson, three small boys, entered his salvage yard premises at 427 Mulberry Street in Canton, without his permission, and while there happened upon a bottle partially embedded in the loose earth on top of a landfill, wherein they discovered the sum of $12,590 in US currency.
It is further alleged that said boys delivered the money to the municipal chief of police who deposited it with defendant, Canton State Bank.
The complaint also alleges defendants caused preliminary notices to be given as required by Ill. Rev.
Stats., chapter 50, subsections 27 and 28 (1965), but that such statute or compliance therewith does not affect the rights of the plaintiff.
[The trial court dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint.]
…It is defendant’s contention that the provisions of Ill Rev Stats, chapter 50, subsections 27 and 28 govern this case.
The relevant portions of this statute are as follows: “27.
Lost goods…If any person or persons shall hereafter find any lost goods, money, bank notes, or other choses in action, of any description whatever, such person or persons shall inform the owner thereof, if known, and shall make restitution of the same, without any compensation whatever, except the same shall be voluntarily given on the part of the owner.
If the owner be unknown, and if such property found is of the value of $ 15 or upwards, the finder…shall, within Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 350  five days after such finding…appear before some judge or magistrate…and make affidavit of the description thereof, the time and place when and where the same was found, that no alteration has been made in the appearance thereof since the finding of the same, that the owner thereof is unknown to him and that he has not secreted, withheld or disposed of any part thereof.
The judge or magistrate shall enter the value of the property found as near as he can ascertain in his estray book together with the affidavit of the finder, and shall also, within ten days after the proceedings have been entered on his estray book, transmit to the county clerk a certified copy thereof, to be by him recorded in his estray book and to file the same in his office…28.
Advertisement…If the value thereof exceeds the sum of $ 15, the county clerk, within 20 days after receiving the certified copy of the judge or magistrate’s estray record shall cause an advertisement to be set up on the court house door, and in 3 other of the most public places in the county, and also a notice thereof to be published for 3 weeks successively in some public newspaper printed in this state and if the owner of such goods, money, bank notes, or other choses in action does not appear and claim the same and pay the finder’s charges and expenses within one year after the advertisement thereof as aforesaid, the ownership of such property shall vest in the finder.” * * * We think it apparent that the statute to which defendants make reference provides a means of vesting title to lost property in the finder where the prescribed search for the owner proves fruitless.
This statute does not purport to provide for the disposition of property deemed mislaid or abandoned nor does it purport to describe or determine the right to possession against any party other than the true owner.
The plain meaning of this statute does not support plaintiff’s position that common law is wholly abrogated thereby.
The provisions of the statute are designed to provide a procedure whereby the discoverer of “lost” property may be vested with the ownership of said property even as against the true owner thereof, a right which theretofore did not exist at common law.
In the absence of any language in the statute from which the contrary can be inferred it must be assumed that the term “lost” was used in its generally accepted legal sense and no extension of the term was intended.
Thus the right to possession of discovered property still depends upon the relative rights of the discoverer and the owner of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 351  locus in quo and the distinctions which exist between property which is abandoned, mislaid, lost or is treasure trove.
The statute assumes that the discoverer is in the rightful possession of lost property and proceedings under such statute is (sic) not a bar where the issue is a claim to the contrary.
There is a presumption that the owner or occupant of land or premises has custody of property found on it or actually imbedded in the land.
The ownership or possession of the locus in quo is related to the right to possession of property discovered thereon or imbedded therein in two respects.
First, if the premises on which the property is discovered are private it is deemed that the property discovered thereon is and always has been in the constructive possession of the owner of said premises and in a legal sense the property can be neither mislaid nor lost.
Pyle v. Springfield Marine Bank, 330 Ill App 1, 70 NE2d 257.
Second, the question of whether the property is mislaid or lost in a legal sense depends upon the intent of the true owner.
The ownership or possession of the premises is an important factor in determining such intent.
If the property be determined to be mislaid, the owner of the premises is entitled to the possession thereof against the discoverer.
It would also appear that if the discoverer is a trespasser such trespasser can have no claim to possession of such property even if it might otherwise be considered lost.
…The facts as alleged in substance are that the Plaintiff was the owner and in possession of real estate, that the money was discovered in a private area of said premises in a bottle partially imbedded in the soil and that such property was removed from the premises by the finders without any right or authority and in effect as trespassers.
We believe the averment of facts in the complaint substantially informs the defendants of the nature of and basis for the claim and is sufficient to state a cause of action.
[The trial court’s dismissal of the Plaintiff’s complaint is reversed and the case is remanded.]
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
What is the actual result in this case?
Do the young boys get any of the money that they found?
Why or why not?
2. Who is Dwayne Bishop, and why is he a plaintiff here?
Was it Bishop that put the $12,590 in US currency in a bottle in the landfill at the salvage yard?
If not, then who did?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 352  3.
If Bishop is not the original owner of the currency, what are the rights of the original owner in this case?
Did the original owner “lose” the currency?
Did the original owner “misplace” the currency?
What difference does it make whether the original owner “lost” or “misplaced” the currency?
Can the original owner, after viewing the legal advertisement, have a claim superior to Dwayne Bishop’s claim?
9.5 Summary and Exercises Summary Property is the legal relationship between persons with respect to things.
The law spells out what can be owned and the degree to which one person can assert an interest in someone else’s things.
Property is classified in several ways: personal versus real, tangible versus intangible, private versus public.
The first distinction, between real and personal, is the most important, for different legal principles often apply to each.
Personal property is movable, whereas real property is immovable.
Among the ways personal property can be acquired are: by (1) possession, (2) finding, (3) gift, (4) accession, and (5) confusion.
Possession means the power to exclude others from using an object.
Possession confers ownership only when there is no owner at the time the current owner takes possession.
“Finders keepers, losers weepers” is not a universal rule; the previous owner is entitled to return of his goods if it is reasonably possible to locate him.
If not, or if the owner does not claim his property, then it goes to the owner of the real estate on which it was found, if the finder was a trespasser, or the goods were buried, were in a private place, or were misplaced rather than lost.
If none of these conditions applies, the property goes to the finder.
A gift is a voluntary transfer of property without consideration.
Two kinds of gifts are possible: inter vivos and causa mortis.
To make an effective gift, (1) the donor must make out a deed or physically deliver the object to the donee, (2) the donor must intend to make a gift, and (3) the donee must accept the gift.
Delivery does not always require physical transfer; sometimes, surrender of control is sufficient.
The donor must intend to give the gift now, not later.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 353  Accession is an addition to that which is already owned—for example, the birth of calves to a cow owned by a farmer.
But when someone else, through labor or by supplying material, adds value, the accession goes to the owner of the principal goods.
Confusion is the intermingling of like goods so that each, while maintaining its form, becomes a part of a larger whole, like grain mixed in a silo.
As long as the goods are identical, they can easily enough be divided among their owners.
A fixture is a type of property that ceases to be personal property and becomes real property when it is annexed or affixed to land or buildings on the land and adapted to the use and enjoyment of the real property.
The common-law rules governing fixtures do not employ clear- cut tests, and sellers and buyers can avoid many disputes by specifying in their contracts what goes with the land.
Tenant’s fixtures remain the property of the tenant if they are for the convenience of the tenant, do not cause substantial damage to the property when removed, and are removed before possession is returned to the landlord.

The principal kinds of intellectual property 2.
The difference between patents and trade secrets, and why a company might choose to rely on trade secrets rather than obtain a patent 3.
What copyrights are, how to obtain them, and how they differ from trademarks 4.
Why some “marks” may not be eligible for trademark protection, and how to obtain trademark protection for those that are Few businesses of any size could operate without being able to protect their rights to a particular type of intangible personal property: intellectual property.
The major forms of intellectual property are patents, copyrights, and trademarks.
Unlike tangible personal property (machines, inventory) or real property (land, office buildings), intellectual property is formless.
It is the product of the human intellect that is embodied in the goods and services a company offers and by which the company is known.
A patent is a grant from government that gives an inventor the exclusive right to make, use, and sell an invention for a period of twenty years from the date of filing the application for a patent.
A copyright is the right to exclude others from using or marketing forms of expression.
A trademark is the right to prevent others from using a company’s product name, slogan, or identifying design.
Other forms of intellectual property are trade secrets (particular kinds of information of commercial use to a company that created it) and right of publicity (the right to exploit a person’s name or image).
Note that the property interest protected in each case is not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 356  the tangible copy of the invention or writing—not the machine with a particular serial number or the book lying on someone’s shelf—but the invention or words themselves.
That is why intellectual property is said to be intangible: it is a right to exclude any others from gaining economic benefit from your own intellectual creation.
In this chapter, we examine how Congress, the courts, and the Patent and Trademark Office have worked to protect the major types of intellectual property.
10.1 Patents LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain why Congress would grant exclusive monopolies (patents) for certain periods of time.
2.
Describe what kinds of things may be patentable and what kinds of things may not be patentable.
3.
Explain the procedures for obtaining a patent, and how patent rights may be an issue where the invention is created by an employee.
4.
Understand who can sue for patent infringement, on what basis, and with what potential remedies.
Source of Authority and Duration Patent and copyright law are federal, enacted by Congress under the power given by Article I of the Constitution “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” Under current law, a patent gives an inventor exclusive rights to make, use, or sell an invention for twenty years.
(If the patent is a design patent—protecting the appearance rather than the function of an item—the period is fourteen years.)
In return for this limited monopoly, the inventor must fully disclose, in papers filed in the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), a complete description of the invention.
Patentability What May Be Patented The patent law says that “any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof” may be patented.
[1] A process is a “process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 357  of matter, or material.” [2] A process for making rolled steel, for example, qualifies as a patentable process under the statute.
Amachine is a particular apparatus for achieving a certain result or carrying out a distinct process—lathes, printing presses, motors, and the cotton gin are all examples of the hundreds of thousands of machines that have received US patents since the first Patent Act in 1790.
A manufacture is an article or a product, such as a television, an automobile, a telephone, or a lightbulb.
A composition of matter is a new arrangement of elements so that the resulting compound, such as a metal alloy, is not found in nature.
In Commissioner of Patents v. Chakrabarty, [3] the Supreme Court said that even living organisms—in particular, a new “genetically engineered” bacterium that could “eat” oil spills— could be patented.
The Chakrabarty decision has spawned innovation: a variety of small biotechnology firms have attracted venture capitalists and other investors.
According to the PTO, gene sequences are patentable subject matter, provided they are isolated from their natural state and processed in a way that separates them from other molecules naturally occurring with them.
Gene patenting, always controversial, generated new controversy when the PTO issued a patent to Human Genome Sciences, Inc. for a gene found to serve as a platform from which the AIDS virus can infect cells of the body.
Critics faulted the PTO for allowing “ownership” of a naturally occurring human gene and for issuing patents without requiring a showing of the gene’s utility.
New guidelines from the PTO followed in 2000; these focused on requiring the applicant to make a strong showing on the utility aspect of patentability and somewhat diminished the rush of biotech patent requests.
There are still other categories of patentable subjects.
An improvement is an alteration of a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter that satisfies one of the tests for patentability given later in this section.
New, original ornamental designs for articles of manufacture are patentable (e.g., the shape of a lamp); works of art are not patentable but are protected under the copyright law.
New varieties of cultivated or hybridized plants are also patentable, as are genetically modified strains of soybean, corn, or other crops.
What May Not Be Patented Many things can be patented, but not (1) the laws of nature, (2) natural phenomena, and (3) abstract ideas, including algorithms (step-by-step formulas for accomplishing a specific task).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 358  One frequently asked question is whether patents can be issued for computer software.
The PTO was reluctant to do so at first, based on the notion that computer programs were not “novel”— the software program either incorporated automation of manual processes or used mathematical equations (which were not patentable).
But in 1998, the Supreme Court held in Diamond v. Diehr [4] that patents could be obtained for a process that incorporated a computer program if the process itself was patentable.
A business process can also be patentable, as the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in 1998 in State Street Bank and Trust v. Signature Financial Group, Inc.[5] Signature Financial had a patent for a computerized accounting system that determined share prices through a series of mathematical calculations that would help manage mutual funds.
State Street sued to challenge that patent.
Signature argued that its model and process was protected, and the court of appeals upheld it as a “practical application of a mathematical, algorithm, formula, or calculation,” because it produces a “useful, concrete and tangible result.” Since State Street, many other firms have applied for business process patents.
For example, Amazon.com obtained a business process patent for its “one-click” ordering system, a method of processing credit-card orders securely.
(But see Amazon.com v. Barnesandnoble.com, [6] in which the court of appeals rejected Amazon’s challenge to Barnesandnoble.com using its Express Land one-click ordering system.)
Tests for Patentability Just because an invention falls within one of the categories of patentable subjects, it is not necessarily patentable.
The Patent Act and judicial interpretations have established certain tests that must first be met.
To approve a patent application, the PTO (as part of the Department of Commerce) will require that the invention, discovery, or process be novel, useful, and nonobvious in light of current technology.
Perhaps the most significant test of patentability is that of obviousness.
The act says that no invention may be patented “if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.” This provision of the law has produced innumerable court cases, especially over Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 359  improvement patents, when those who wish to use an invention on which a patent has been issued have refused to pay royalties on the grounds that the invention was obvious to anyone who looked.
Procedures for Obtaining a Patent In general, the United States (unlike many other countries) grants a patent right to the first person to invent a product or process rather than to the first person to file for a patent on that product or process.
As a practical matter, however, someone who invents a product or process but does not file immediately should keep detailed research notes or other evidence that would document the date of invention.
An inventor who fails to apply for a patent within a year of that date would forfeit the rights granted to an inventor who had published details of the invention or offered it for sale.
But until the year has passed, the PTO may not issue a patent to X if Y has described the invention in a printed publication here or abroad or the invention has been in public use or on sale in this country.
An inventor cannot obtain a patent automatically; obtaining a patent is an expensive and time- consuming process, and the inventor will need the services of a patent attorney, a highly specialized practitioner.
The attorney will help develop the requiredspecification, a description of the invention that gives enough detail so that one skilled in the art will be able to make and use the invention.
After receiving an application, a PTO examiner will search the records and accept or reject the claim.
Usually, the attorney will negotiate with the examiner and will rewrite and refine the application until it is accepted.
A rejection may be appealed, first to the PTO’s Board of Appeals and then, if that fails, to the federal district court in the District of Columbia or to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the successor court to the old US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
Once a patent application has been filed, the inventor or a company to which she has assigned the invention may put the words “patent pending” on the invention.
These words have no legal effect.
Anyone is free to make the invention as long as the patent has not yet been issued.
But they do put others on notice that a patent has been applied for.
Once the patent has been granted, infringers may be sued even if the infringed has made the product and offered it for sale before the patent was granted.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 360  In today’s global market, obtaining a US patent is important but is not usually sufficient protection.
The inventor will often need to secure patent protection in other countries as well.
Under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883), parties in one country can file for patent or trademark protection in any of the other member countries (172 countries as of 2011).
The World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) established standards for protecting intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks, and copyrights) and provides that each member nation must have laws that protect intellectual property rights with effective access to judicial systems for pursuing civil and criminal penalties for violations of such rights.
Patent Ownership The patent holder is entitled to make and market the invention and to exclude others from doing so.
Because the patent is a species of property, it may be transferred.
The inventor may assign part or all of his interest in the patent or keep the property interest and license others to manufacture or use the invention in return for payments known as royalties.
The license may be exclusive with one licensee, or the inventor may license many to exploit the invention.
One important limitation on the inventor’s right to the patent interest is the so-called shop right.
This is a right created by state courts on equitable grounds giving employers a nonexclusive royalty-free license to use any invention made by an employee on company time and with company materials.
The shop right comes into play only when a company has no express or implied understanding with its employees.
Most corporate laboratories have contractual agreements with employees about who owns the invention and what royalties will be paid.
Infringement and Invalidity Suits Suits for patent infringement can arise in three ways: (1) the patent holder may seek damages and an injunction against the infringer in federal court, requesting damages for royalties and lost profits as well; (2) even before being sued, the accused party may take the patent holder to court under the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking a court declaration that the patent is invalid; (3) the patent holder may sue a licensee for royalties claimed to be due, and the licensee may counterclaim that the patent is invalid.
Such a suit, if begun in state court, may be removed to federal court.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 361  In a federal patent infringement lawsuit, the court may grant the winning party reimbursement for attorneys’ fees and costs.
If the infringement is adjudged to be intentional, the court can triple the amount of damages awarded.
Prior to 2006, courts were typically granting permanent injunctions to prevent future infringement.
CitingeBay, Inc. v. Merc Exchange, LLC, [7] the Supreme Court ruled that patent holders are not automatically entitled to a permanent injunction against infringement during the life of the patent.
Courts have the discretion to determine whether justice requires a permanent injunction, and they may conclude that the public interest and equitable principles may be better satisfied with compensatory damages only.
Proving infringement can be a difficult task.
Many companies employ engineers to “design around” a patent product—that is, to seek ways to alter the product to such an extent that the substitute product no longer consists of enough of the elements of the invention safeguarded by the patent.
However, infringing products, processes, or machines need not be identical; as the Supreme Court said in Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winers, [8] “one device is an infringement of another…if two devices do the same work in substantially the same way, and accomplish substantially the same result…even though they differ in name, form, or shape.” This is known as thedoctrine of equivalents.
In an infringement suit, the court must choose between these two extremes: legitimate “design around” and infringement through some equivalent product.
An infringement suit can often be dangerous because the defendant will almost always assert in its answer that the patent is invalid.
The plaintiff patent holder thus runs the risk that his entire patent will be taken away from him if the court agrees.
In ruling on validity, the court may consider all the tests, such as prior art and obviousness, discussed in Section 10.1.2 "Patentability" and rule on these independently of the conclusions drawn by the PTO.
Patent Misuse Although a patent is a monopoly granted to the inventor or his assignee or licensee, the monopoly power is legally limited.
An owner who misuses the patent may find that he will lose an infringement suit.
One common form of misuse is to tie the patented good to some unpatented one—for example, a patented movie projector that will not be sold unless the buyer agrees to rent films supplied only by the manufacturer of the movie projector, or a copier Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 362  manufacturer that requires buyers to purchase plain paper from it.
Various provisions of the federal antitrust laws, including, specifically, Section 3 of the Clayton Act, outlaw certain kinds of tying arrangements.
Another form of patent misuse is a provision in the licensing agreement prohibiting the manufacturer from also making competing products.
Although the courts have held against several other types of misuse, the general principle is that the owner may not use his patent to restrain trade in unpatented goods.
KEY TAKEAWAY Many different “things” are patentable, include gene sequences, business processes, and any other “useful invention.” The US Patent and Trademark Office acts on initial applications and may grant a patent to an applicant.
The patent, which allows a limited-time monopoly, is for twenty years.
The categories of patentable things include processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, and improvements.
Ideas, mental processes, naturally occurring substances, methods of doing business, printed matter, and scientific principles cannot be patented.
Patent holders may sue for infringement and royalties from an infringer user.

10.2 Trade Secrets LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the difference between trade secrets and patents, and explain why a firm might prefer keeping a trade secret rather than obtaining a patent.
2.
Understand the dimensions of corporate espionage and the impact of the federal Economic Espionage Act.
Definition of Trade Secrets A patent is an invention publicly disclosed in return for a monopoly.
A trade secret is a means to a monopoly that a company hopes to maintain by preventing public disclosure.
Why not always take out a patent?
There are several reasons.
The trade secret might be one that is not patentable, such as a customer list or an improvement that does not meet the tests of novelty or nonobviousness.
A patent can be designed around; but if the trade secret is kept, its owner will be the exclusive user of it.
Patents are expensive to obtain, and the process is extremely time consuming.
Patent protection expires in twenty years, after which anyone is free to use the invention, but a trade secret can be maintained for as long as the secret is kept.
However, a trade secret is valuable only so long as it is kept secret.
Once it is publicly revealed, by whatever means, anyone is free to use it.
The critical distinction between a patent and a trade secret is this: a patent gives its owner the right to enjoin anyone who infringes it from making use of it, whereas a trade secret gives its “owner” the right to sue only the person who improperly took it or revealed it.
According to the Restatement of Torts, Section 757, Comment b, a trade secret may consist of any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one’s business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 364  use it.
It may be a formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list of customers.…A trade secret is a process or device for continuous use in the operation of a business.
Generally it relates to the production of goods, as, for example, a machine or formula for the production of an article.
Other types of trade secrets are customer information, pricing data, marketing methods, sources of supply, and secret technical know-how.
Elements of Trade Secrets To be entitled to protection, a trade secret must be (1) original and (2) secret.
Originality The trade secret must have a certain degree of originality, although not as much as would be necessary to secure a patent.
For example, a principle or technique that is common knowledge does not become a protectable trade secret merely because a particular company taught it to one of its employees who now wants to leave to work for a competitor.
Secrecy Some types of information are obviously secret, like the chemical formula that is jealously guarded through an elaborate security system within the company.
But other kinds of information might not be secret, even though essential to a company’s business.
For instance, a list of suppliers that can be devised easily by reading through the telephone directory is not secret.
Nor is a method secret simply because someone develops and uses it, if no steps are taken to guard it.
A company that circulates a product description in its catalog may not claim a trade secret in the design of the product if the description permits someone to do “reverse engineering.” A company that hopes to keep its processes and designs secret should affirmatively attempt to do so—for example, by requiring employees to sign a nondisclosure agreement covering the corporate trade secrets with which they work.
However, a company need not go to every extreme to guard a trade secret.
Trade-secrets espionage has become a big business.
To protect industrial secrets, US corporations spend billions on security arrangements.
The line between competitive intelligence gathering and espionage can sometimes be difficult to draw.
The problem is by no means Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 365  confined to the United States; companies and nations all over the world have become concerned about theft of trade secrets to gain competitive advantage, and foreign governments are widely believed to be involved in espionage and cyberattacks.
Economic Espionage Act The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996 makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime.
The act is aimed at protecting commercial information rather than classified national defense information.
Two sorts of activities are criminalized.
The first section of the act [1] criminalizes the misappropriation of trade secrets (including conspiracy to misappropriate trade secrets and the subsequent acquisition of such misappropriated trade secrets) with the knowledge or intent that the theft will benefit a foreign power.
Penalties for violation are fines of up to US$500,000 per offense and imprisonment of up to fifteen years for individuals, and fines of up to US$10 million for organizations.
The second section [2] criminalizes the misappropriation of trade secrets related to or included in a product that is produced for or placed in interstate (including international) commerce, with the knowledge or intent that the misappropriation will injure the owner of the trade secret.
Penalties for violation are imprisonment for up to ten years for individuals (no fines) and fines of up to US$5 million for organizations.
In addition to these specific penalties, the fourth section of the EEA [3] also requires criminal forfeiture of (1) any proceeds of the crime and property derived from proceeds of the crime and (2) any property used, or intended to be used, in commission of the crime.
The EEA authorizes civil proceedings by the Department of Justice to enjoin violations of the act but does not create a private cause of action.
This means that anyone believing they have been victimized must go through the US attorney general in order to obtain an injunction.
The EEA is limited to the United States and has no extraterritorial application unless (1) the offender is a US company or a citizen operating from abroad against a US company or (2) an act in furtherance of the espionage takes place in the United States.
Other nations lack such legislation, and some may actively support industrial espionage using both their national intelligence services.
The US Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive publishes an Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 366  annual report, mandated by the US Congress, on foreign economic collection and industrial espionage, which outlines these espionage activities of many foreign nations.
Right of Employees to Use Trade Secrets A perennial source of lawsuits in the trade secrets arena is the employee who is hired away by a competitor, allegedly taking trade secrets along with him.
Companies frequently seek to prevent piracy by requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements.
An agreement not to disclose particular trade secrets learned or developed on the job is generally enforceable.
Even without an agreement, an employer can often prevent disclosure under principles of agency law.
Sections 395 and 396 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency suggest that it is an actionable breach of duty to disclose to third persons information given confidentially during the course of the agency.
However, every person is held to have a right to earn a living.
If the rule were strictly applied, a highly skilled person who went to another company might be barred from using his knowledge and skills.
The courts do not prohibit people from using elsewhere the general knowledge and skills they developed on the job.
Only specific trade secrets are protected.
To get around this difficulty, some companies require their employees to sign agreements not to compete.
But unless the agreements are limited in scope and duration to protect a company against only specific misuse of trade secrets, they are unenforceable.
KEY TAKEAWAY Trade secrets, if they can be kept, have indefinite duration and thus greater potential value than patents.
Trade secrets can be any formula, pattern, device, process, or compilation of information to be used in a business.
Customer information, pricing data, marketing methods, sources of supply, and technical know-how could all be trade secrets.
State law has protected trade secrets, and federal law has provided criminal sanctions for theft of trade secrets.
With the importance of digitized information, methods of theft now include computer hacking; theft of corporate secrets is a burgeoning global business that often involves cyberattacks.

10.3 Copyright LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe and explain copyrights, how to obtain one, and how they differ from trademarks.
2.
Explain the concept of fair use and describe its limits.
Definition and Duration Copyright is the legal protection given to “authors” for their “writings.” Copyright law is federal; like patent law, its source lies in the Constitution.
Copyright protects the expression of ideas in some tangible form, but it does not protect the ideas themselves.
Under the 1976 Copyright Act as amended, a copyright in any work created after January 1, 1978, begins when the work is fixed in tangible form—for example, when a book is written down or a picture is painted—and generally lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years after his or her death.
This is similar to copyright protection in many countries, but in some countries, the length of copyright protection is the life of the author plus 50 years.
For copyrights owned by publishing houses, done as works for hire, common copyright expires 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever is first.
For works created before 1978, such as many of Walt Disney’s movies and cartoons, the US Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 provided additional protection of up to 95 years from publication date.
Thus works created in 1923 by Disney would not enter the public domain until 2019 or after, unless the copyright had expired prior to 1998 or unless the Disney company released the work into the public domain.
In general, after expiration of the copyright, the work enters the public domain.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 368  In 1989, the United States signed the Berne Convention, an international copyright treaty.
This law eliminated the need to place the symbol © or the word Copyright or the abbreviation Copr.
on the work itself.
Copyrights can be registered with the US Copyright Office in Washington, DC.
Protected Expression The Copyright Act protects a variety of “writings,” some of which may not seem written at all.
These include literary works (books, newspapers, and magazines), music, drama, choreography, films, art, sculpture, and sound recordings.
Since copyright covers the expression and not the material or physical object, a book may be copyrighted whether it is on paper, microfilm, tape, or computer disk.
Rights Protected by the Copyright Act Preventing Copying A copyright gives its holder the right to prevent others from copying his or her work.
The copyright holder has the exclusive right to reproduce the work in any medium (paper, film, sound recording), to perform it (e.g., in the case of a play), or to display it (a painting or film).
A copyright also gives its holder the exclusive right to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted work.
Thus a playwright could not adapt to the stage a novelist’s book without the latter’s permission.
Fair Use One major exception to the exclusivity of copyrights is the fair use doctrine.
Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides as follows: Fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by section 106 of the copyright, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.
In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use, the factors to be considered shall include– (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 369  (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
[1] These are broad guidelines.
Accordingly, any copying could be infringement, and fair use could become a question of fact on a case-by-case basis.
In determining fair use, however, courts have often considered the fourth factor (effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work) to be the most important.
Clear examples of fair use would be when book reviewers or writers quote passages from copyrighted books.
Without fair use, most writing would be useless because it could not readily be discussed.
But the doctrine of fair use grew more troublesome with the advent of plain-paper copiers and is now even more troublesome with electronic versions of copyrighted materials that are easily copied and distributed.
The 1976 act took note of the new copier technology, listing “teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use)” as one application of fair use.
The Copyright Office follows guidelines specifying just how far the copying may go—for example, multiple copies of certain works may be made for classroom use, but copies may not be used to substitute for copyrighted anthologies.
Infringement Verbatim use of a copyrighted work is easily provable.
The more difficult question arises when the copyrighted work is altered in some way.
As in patent law, the standard is one of substantial similarity.
Copyrightability Standards To be subject to copyright, the writing must be “fixed” in some “tangible medium of expression.” A novelist who composes a chapter of her next book in her mind and tells it to a friend before putting it on paper could not stop the friend from rushing home, writing it down, and selling it (at least the federal copyright law would offer no protection; some states might independently offer a legal remedy, however).
The work also must be creative, at least to a minimal degree.
Words and phrases, such as names, titles, and slogans, are not copyrightable; nor are symbols or designs familiar to the public.
But an author who contributes her own creativity—like taking a photograph of nature—may Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 370  copyright the resulting work, even if the basic elements of the composition were not of her making.
Finally, the work must be “original,” which means simply that it must have originated with the author.
The law does not require that it be novel or unique.
This requirement was summarized pithily by Judge Learned Hand: “If by some magic a man who had never known it were to compose anew Keats’s Ode on a Grecian Urn, he would be an author, and, if he copyrighted it, others might not copy that poem, though they might of course copy Keats’s.” [2] Sometimes the claim is made that a composer, for example, just happened to compose a tune identical or strikingly similar to a copyrighted song; rather than assume the unlikely coincidence that Judge Hand hypothesized, the courts will look for evidence that the alleged copier had access to the copyrighted song.
If he did—for example, the song was frequently played on the air—he cannot defend the copying with the claim that it was unconscious, because the work would not then have been original.
Section 102 of the Copyright Act excludes copyright protection for any “idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied.” [3] Einstein copyrighted books and monographs he wrote on the theory of relativity, but he could not copyright the famous formula E = mc2, nor could he prevent others from writing about the theory.
But he could protect the particular way in which his ideas were expressed.
In general, facts widely known by the public are not copyrightable, and mathematical calculations are not copyrightable.
Compilations of facts may be copyrightable, if the way that they are coordinated or arranged results in a work that shows some originality.
For example, compiled information about yachts listed for sale may qualify for copyright protection.
[4] One of the most troublesome recent questions concerning expression versus ideas is whether a computer program may be copyrighted.
After some years of uncertainty, the courts have accepted the copyrightability of computer programs.
[5] Now the courts are wrestling with the more difficult question of the scope of protection: what constitutes an “idea” and what constitutes its mere “expression” in a program.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 371  How far the copyright law will protect particular software products is a hotly debated topic, sparked by a federal district court’s ruling in 1990 that the “look and feel” of Lotus 1-2-3’s menu system is copyrightable and was in fact infringed by Paperback Software’s VP-Planner, a competing spreadsheet.
[6] The case has led some analysts to “fear that legal code, rather than software code, is emerging as the factor that will determine which companies and products will dominate the 1990s.” [7] Who May Obtain a Copyright?
With one important exception, only the author may hold the initial copyright, although the author may assign it or license any one or more of the rights conveyed by the copyright.
This is a simple principle when the author has written a book or painted a picture.
But the law is unclear in the case of a motion picture or a sound recording.
Is the author the script writer, the producer, the performer, the director, the engineer, or someone else?
As a practical matter, all parties involved spell out their rights by contract.
The exception, which frequently covers the difficulties just enumerated, is for works for hire.
Any person employed to write—a journalist or an advertising jingle writer, for example—is not the “author.” For purposes of the statute, the employer is the author and may take out the copyright.
When the employee is in fact an “independent contractor” and the work in question involves any one of nine types (book, movies, etc.)
spelled out in the Copyright Act, the employer and the creator must spell out their entitlement to the copyright in a written agreement.
[8] Obtaining a Copyright Until 1978, a work could not be copyrighted unless it was registered in the Copyright Office or was published and unless each copy of the work carried a copyright notice, consisting of the word Copyright, the abbreviation Copr., or the common symbol ©, together with the date of first publication and the name of the copyright owner.
Under the 1976 act, copyright became automatic whenever the work was fixed in a tangible medium of expression (e.g., words on paper, images on film or videotape, sound on tape or compact disc), even if the work remained unpublished or undistributed.
However, to retain copyright protection, the notice had to be affixed once the work was “published” and copies circulated to the public.
After the United States entered the Berne Convention, an international treaty governing copyrights, Congress Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 372  enacted the Berne Implementation Act, declaring that, effective in 1989, notice, even after publication, was no longer required.
Notice does, however, confer certain benefits.
In the absence of notice, a copyright holder loses the right to receive statutory damages (an amount stated in the Copyright Act and not required to be proved) if someone infringes the work.
Also, although it is no longer required, an application and two copies of the work (for deposit in the Library of Congress) filed with the Copyright Office, in Washington, DC, will enable the copyright holder to file suit should the copyright be infringed.
Unlike patent registration, which requires elaborate searching of Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) records, copyright registration does not require a reading of the work to determine whether it is an original creation or an infringement of someone else’s prior work.
But copyright registration does not immunize the holder from an infringement suit.
If a second work has been unlawfully copied from an earlier work, the second author’s copyright will not bar the infringed author from collecting damages and obtaining an injunction.
Computer Downloads and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act The ubiquity of the Internet and the availability of personal computers with large capacities have greatly impacted the music business.
Sharing of music files took off in the late 1990s with Napster, which lost a legal battle on copyright and had to cease doing business.
By providing the means by which individuals could copy music that had been purchased, major record labels were losing substantial profits.
Grokster, a privately owned software company based in the West Indies, provided peer-to-peer file sharing from 2001 to 2005 until the US Supreme Court’s decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. [9] For computers with the Microsoft operating system, the Court disallowed the peer-to-peer file sharing, even though Grokster claimed it did not violate any copyright laws because no files passed through its computers.
(Grokster had assigned certain user computers as “root supernodes” that acted as music hubs for the company and was not directly involved in controlling any specific music-file downloads.)
Grokster had argued, based on Sony v. Universal Studios, [10] that the sale of its copying equipment (like the Betamax videocassette recorders at issue in that case) did not constitute contributory infringement “if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 373  purposes.” Plaintiffs successfully argued that the Sony safe-harbor concept requires proof that the noninfringing use is the primary use in terms of the product’s utility.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), passed into law in 1998, implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization.
It criminalizes production and sale of devices or services intended to get around protective measures that control access to copyrighted works.
In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.
The DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.
KEY TAKEAWAY Copyright is the legal protection given to “authors” for their “writings.” It protects ideas in fixed, tangible form, not ideas themselves.
Copyright protection can extend as long as 120 years from the date of creation or publication.
Expression found in literary works, music, drama, film, art, sculpture, sound recordings, and the like may be copyrighted.
The fair use doctrine limits the exclusivity of copyright in cases where scholars, critics, or teachers use only selected portions of the copyrighted material in a way that is unlikely to affect the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

10.4 Trademarks LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand what a trademark is and why it deserves protection.
2.
Know why some “marks” may not be eligible for trademark protection, and how to obtain trademark protection for those that are.
3.
Explain what “blurring” and “tarnishment” are and what remedies are available to the holder of the mark.
Definitions of Trademarks A trademark is defined in the federal Lanham Act of 1946 as “any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from goods manufactured or sold by others.”[1] Examples of well-known trademarks are Coca-Cola, Xerox, and Apple.
Aservice mark is used in the sale or advertising of services to identify the services of one person and distinguish them from the services of others.
Examples of service marks are McDonald’s, BP, and Hilton.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 375  A certification mark is used in connection with many products “to certify regional or other origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy or other characteristics of such goods or services or that the work or labor on the goods or services was performed by members of a union or other organization.” Examples are the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval and UL (Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., approval mark).
Unlike other forms of trademark, the owner of the certification mark (e.g., Good Housekeeping, or the Forest Stewardship Council’s FSC mark) is not the owner of the underlying product.
Extent of Trademark Protection Kinds of Marks Trademarks and other kinds of marks may consist of words and phrases, pictures, symbols, shapes, numerals, letters, slogans, and sounds.
Trademarks are a part of our everyday world: the sounds of a radio or television network announcing itself (NBC, BBC), the shape of a whiskey bottle (Haig & Haig’s Pinch Bottle), a series of initials (GE, KPMG, IBM), or an animal’s warning growl (MGM’s lion).
Limitations on Marks Although trademarks abound, the law limits the subjects that may fall into one of the defined categories.
Not every word or shape or symbol will be protected in an infringement action.
To qualify for protection, a trademark must be used to identify and distinguish.
The courts employ a four-part test: (1) Is the mark so arbitrary and fanciful that it merits the widest protection?
(2) Is it “suggestive” enough to warrant protection without proof of secondary meaning?
(3) Is it “descriptive,” warranting protection if secondary meaning is proved?
(4) Is the mark generic and thus unprotectable?
These tests do not have mechanical answers; they call for judgment.
Some marks are wholly fanciful, clearly identify origin of goods, and distinguish them from others—Kodak, for example.
Other marks may not be so arbitrary but may nevertheless be distinctive, either when adopted or as a result of advertising—for example, Crest, as the name of a toothpaste.
Marks that are merely descriptive of the product are entitled to protection only if it can be shown that the mark has acquired secondary meaning.
This term reflects a process of identification on the mark in the public mind with the originator of the product.
Holiday Inn Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 376  was initially deemed too descriptive: an inn where people might go on holiday.
But over time, travelers came to identify the source of the Great Sign and the name Holiday Inn as the Holiday Inn Corporation in Memphis, and secondary meaning was granted.
Holiday Inn could thus protect its mark against other innkeepers, hoteliers, and such; however, the trademark protection for the words Holiday Inn was limited to the corporation’s hotel and motel business, and no other.
Certain words and phrases may not qualify at all for trademark protection.
These include generic terms like “straw broom” (for a broom made of straw) and ordinary words like “fast food.” In one case, a federal appeals court held that the word “Lite” is generic and cannot be protected by a beer manufacturer to describe a low-calorie brew.
[2] Donald Trump’s effort to trademark “You’re fired!” and Paris Hilton’s desire to trademark “That’s hot!” were also dismissed as being generic.
Deceptive words will not be accepted for registration.
Thus the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied registration to the word Vynahyde because it suggested that the plastic material to which it was applied came from animal skin.
Geographic terms are descriptive words and may not be used as protected trademarks unless they have acquired a secondary meaning, such as Hershey when used for chocolates.
(Hershey’s chocolates are made in Hershey, Pennsylvania.)
A design that reflects a common style cannot be protected in a trademark to exclude other similar designs in the same tradition.
Thus the courts have ruled that a silverware pattern that is a “functional feature” of the “baroque style” does not qualify for trademark protection.
Finally, the Lanham Act denies federal registration to certain marks that fall within categories of words and shapes, including the following: the flag; the name, portrait, or signature of any living person without consent, or of a deceased US president during the lifetime of his widow; and immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter (in an earlier era, the phrase “Bubby Trap” for brassieres was denied registration).
Dilution, Tarnishment, and Blurring Under the federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, companies with marks that dilute the value of a senior mark may be liable for damages.
The act provides that owners of marks of significant value have property rights that should not be eroded, blurred, tarnished, or diluted in any way Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 377  by another.
But as a plaintiff, the holder of the mark must show (1) that it is a famous mark, (2) that the use of a similar mark is commercial, and (3) that such use causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.
Thus a T-shirt maker who promotes a red-and-white shirt bearing the mark Buttweiser may be liable to Anheuser-Busch, or a pornographic site called Candyland could be liable to Parker Brothers, the board game company.
Interesting cases have already been brought under this act, including a case brought by Victoria’s Secret against a small adult store in Kentucky called Victor’s Little Secret.
Notice that unlike most prior trademark law, the purpose is not to protect the consumer from confusion as to the source or origin of the goods or services being sold; for example, no one going to the Candyland site would think that Parker Brothers was the source.
Acquiring Trademark Rights For the first time in more than forty years, Congress, in 1988, changed the way in which trademarks can be secured.
Under the Lanham Act, the fundamental means of obtaining a trademark was through use.
The manufacturer or distributor actually must have placed the mark on its product—or on related displays, labels, shipping containers, advertisements, and the like—and then have begun selling the product.
If the product was sold in interstate commerce, the trademark was entitled to protection under the Lanham Act (or if not, to protection under the common law of the state in which the product was sold).
Under the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, which went into effect in 1989, trademarks can be obtained in advance by registering with the PTO an intention to use the mark within six months (the applicant can gain extensions of up to thirty more months to put the mark into use).
Once obtained, the trademark will be protected for ten years (before the 1988 revision, a federal trademark remained valid for twenty years); if after that time the mark is still being used, the registration can be renewed.
Obtaining a trademark registration lies between obtaining patents and obtaining copyrights in difficulty.
The PTO will not routinely register a trademark; it searches its records to ensure that the mark meets several statutory tests and does not infringe another mark.
Those who feel that their own marks would be hurt by registration of a proposed mark may file an opposition proceeding with the PTO.
Until 1990, the office received Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 378  about 77,000 applications each year.
With the change in procedure, some experts predicted that applications would rise by 30 percent.
In many foreign countries, use need not be shown to obtain trademark registration.
It is common for some people in these countries to register marks that they expect to be valuable so that they can sell the right to use the mark to the company that established the mark’s value.
Companies that expect to market abroad should register their marks early.
Loss of Rights Trademark owners may lose their rights if they abandon the mark, if a patent or copyright expires on which the mark is based, or if the mark becomes generic.
A mark is abandoned if a company goes out of business and ceases selling the product.
Some marks are based on design patents; when the patent expires, the patent holder will not be allowed to extend the patent’s duration by arguing that the design or name linked with the design is a registrable trademark.
The most widespread difficulty that a trademark holder faces is the prospect of too much success: if a trademark comes to stand generically for the product itself, it may lose exclusivity in the mark.
Famous examples are aspirin, escalator, and cellophane.
The threat is a continual one.
Trademark holders can protect themselves from their marks’ becoming generic in several ways.
1.
Use a descriptive term along with the trademark.
Look on a jar of Vaseline and you will see that the label refers to the contents as Vaseline petroleum jelly.
2.
Protest generic use of the mark in all publications by writing letters and taking out advertisements.
3.
Always put the words Trademark, Registered Trademark, or the symbol ® (meaning “registered”) next to the mark itself, which should be capitalized.
KEY TAKEAWAY Trademark protection is federal, under the Lanham Act.
Branding of corporate logos, names, and products is essential to business success, and understanding trademarks is pivotal to branding.
A “mark” must be distinctive, arbitrary, or fanciful to merit protection: this means that it must not be generic or descriptive.
Marks can be words, symbols, pictures, slogans, sounds, phrases, and even shapes.
In the United States, rights to marks are obtained by registration and intent to use in commerce and must be renewed every ten years.

10.5 Cases Fair Use in Copyright Elvis Presley Enterprises et al.
v. Passport Video et al.
349 F.3d 622 (9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 2003) TALLMAN, CIRCUIT JUDGE: Plaintiffs are a group of companies and individuals holding copyrights in various materials relating to Elvis Presley.
For example, plaintiff SOFA Entertainment, Inc., is the registered owner of several Elvis appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Plaintiff Promenade Trust owns the copyright to two television specials featuring Elvis: The Elvis 1968 Comeback Special and Elvis Aloha from Hawaii.…Many Plaintiffs are in the business of licensing their copyrights.
For example, SOFA Entertainment charges $10,000 per minute for use of Elvis’ appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Passport Entertainment and its related entities (collectively “Passport”) produced and sold The Definitive Elvis, a 16-hour video documentary about the life of Elvis Presley.The Definitive Elvis sold for $99 at retail.
Plaintiffs allege that thousands of copies were sent to retail outlets and other distributors.
On its box, The Definitive Elvisdescribes itself as an all-encompassing, in- Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 380  depth look at the life and career of a man whose popularity is unrivaled in the history of show business and who continues to attract millions of new fans each year.… The Definitive Elvis uses Plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials in a variety of ways.
With the video footage, the documentary often uses shots of Elvis appearing on television while a narrator or interviewee talks over the film.
These clips range from only a few seconds in length to portions running as long as 30 seconds.
In some instances, the clips are the subject of audio commentary, while in other instances they would more properly be characterized as video “filler” because the commentator is discussing a subject different from or more general than Elvis’ performance on a particular television show.
But also significant is the frequency with which the copyrighted video footage is used.
The Definitive Elvis employs these clips, in many instances, repeatedly.
In total, at least 5% to 10% of The Definitive Elvis uses Plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials.
Use of the video footage, however, is not limited to brief clips.…Thirty-five percent of his appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show is replayed, as well as three minutes from The 1968 Comeback Special.
* * * Plaintiffs sued Passport for copyright infringement.…Passport, however, asserts that its use of the copyrighted materials was “fair use” under 17 U.S.C.
§ 107.
Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which was granted by the district court after a hearing.
The district court found that Passport’s use of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials was likely not fair use.
The court enjoined Passport from selling or distributing The Definitive Elvis.
Passport timely appeals.
* * * We first address the purpose and character of Passport’s use of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials.
Although not controlling, the fact that a new use is commercial as opposed to non-profit weighs against a finding of fair use.
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 562, 85 L. Ed.
2d 588, 105 S.Ct.
2218 (1985).
And the degree to which the new user exploits the copyright for commercial gain—as opposed to incidental use as part of a commercial enterprise—affects the weight we afford commercial nature as a factor.
More importantly for the first fair-use factor, however, is the “transformative” nature of the new work.
Specifically, we ask “whether the new work…merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 381  something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.…” The more transformative a new work, the less significant other inquiries, such as commercialism, become.
* * * The district court below found that the purpose and character of The Definitive Elviswill likely weigh against a finding of fair use.
We cannot say, based on this record, that the district court abused its discretion.
First, Passport’s use, while a biography, is clearly commercial in nature.
But more significantly, Passport seeks to profit directly from the copyrights it uses without a license.
One of the most salient selling points on the box of The Definitive Elvis is that “Every Film and Television Appearance is represented.” Passport is not advertising a scholarly critique or historical analysis, but instead seeks to profit at least in part from the inherent entertainment value of Elvis’ appearances on such shows as The Steve Allen Show, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The 1968 Comeback Special.
Passport’s claim that this is scholarly research containing biographical comments on the life of Elvis is not dispositive of the fair use inquiry.
Second, Passport’s use of Plaintiffs’ copyrights is not consistently transformative.
True, Passport’s use of many of the television clips is transformative because the clips play for only a few seconds and are used for reference purposes while a narrator talks over them or interviewees explain their context in Elvis’ career.
But voice-overs do not necessarily transform a work.… It would be impossible to produce a biography of Elvis without showing some of his most famous television appearances for reference purposes.
But some of the clips are played without much interruption, if any.
The purpose of showing these clips likely goes beyond merely making a reference for a biography, but instead serves the same intrinsic entertainment value that is protected by Plaintiffs’ copyrights.
* * * The third factor is the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.
This factor evaluates both the quantity of the work taken and the quality and importance of the portion taken.
Regarding the quantity, copying “may not be Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 382  excused merely because it is insubstantial with respect to the infringingwork.” Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565 (emphasis in original).
But if the amount used is substantial with respect to the infringing work, it is evidence of the value of the copy-righted work.
Passport’s use of clips from television appearances, although in most cases of short duration, were repeated numerous times throughout the tapes.
While using a small number of clips to reference an event for biographical purposes seems fair, using a clip over and over will likely no longer serve a biographical purpose.
Additionally, some of the clips were not short in length.
Passport’s use of Elvis’ appearance on The Steve Allen Show plays for over a minute and many more clips play for more than just a few seconds.
Additionally, although the clips are relatively short when compared to the entire shows that are copyrighted, they are in many instances the heart of the work.
What makes these copyrighted works valuable is Elvis’ appearance on the shows, in many cases singing the most familiar passages of his most popular songs.
Plaintiffs are in the business of licensing these copyrights.
Taking key portions extracts the most valuable part of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works.
With respect to the photographs, the entire picture is often used.
The music, admittedly, is usually played only for a few seconds.
* * * The last, and “undoubtedly the single most important” of all the factors, is the effect the use will have on the potential market for and value of the copyrighted works.
Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566.
We must “consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant…would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590.
The more transformative the new work, the less likely the new work’s use of copyrighted materials will affect the market for the materials.
Finally, if the purpose of the new work is commercial in nature, “the likelihood [of market harm] may be presumed.” A&M Records, 239 F.3d at 1016 (quoting Sony, 464 U.S. at 451).
The district court found that Passport’s use of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials likely does affect the market for those materials.
This conclusion was not clearly erroneous.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 383  First, Passport’s use is commercial in nature, and thus we can assume market harm.
Second, Passport has expressly advertised that The Definitive Elvis contains the television appearances for which Plaintiffs normally charge a licensing fee.
If this type of use became wide-spread, it would likely undermine the market for selling Plaintiffs’ copyrighted material.
This conclusion, however, does not apply to the music and still photographs.
It seems unlikely that someone in the market for these materials would purchase The Definitive Elvis instead of a properly licensed product.
Third, Passport’s use of the television appearances was, in some instances, not transformative, and therefore these uses are likely to affect the market because they serve the same purpose as Plaintiffs’ original works.
* * * We emphasize that our holding today is not intended to express how we would rule were we examining the case ab initio as district judges.
Instead, we confine our review to whether the district court abused its discretion when it weighed the four statutory fair-use factors together and determined that Plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits.
Although we might view this case as closer than the district court saw it, we hold there was no abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to grant Plaintiffs’ requested relief.
AFFIRMED.

Trademark Infringement and Dilution Playboy Enterprises v. Welles 279 F.3d 796 (9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 2001) T. G. NELSON, Circuit Judge: Terri Welles was on the cover of Playboy in 1981 and was chosen to be the Playboy Playmate of the Year for 1981.
Her use of the title “Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981,” and her use of other Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 384  trademarked terms on her website are at issue in this suit.
During the relevant time period, Welles’ website offered information about and free photos of Welles, advertised photos for sale, advertised memberships in her photo club, and promoted her services as a spokesperson.
A biographical section described Welles’ selection as Playmate of the Year in 1981 and her years modeling for PEI.
The site included a disclaimer that read as follows: “This site is neither endorsed, nor sponsored, nor affiliated with Playboy Enterprises, Inc. PLAYBOY tm PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR tm AND PLAYMATE OF THE MONTH tm are registered trademarks of Playboy Enterprises, Inc.” Wells used (1) the terms “Playboy ”and “Playmate” in the metatags of the website; (2) the phrase “Playmate of the Year 1981” on the masthead of the website; (3) the phrases “Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981” and “Playmate of the Year 1981” on various banner ads, which may be transferred to other websites; and (4) the repeated use of the abbreviation “PMOY ’81” as the watermark on the pages of the website.
PEI claimed that these uses of its marks constituted trademark infringement, dilution, false designation of origin, and unfair competition.
The district court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
PEI appeals the grant of summary judgment on its infringement and dilution claims.
We affirm in part and reverse in part.
A.
Trademark Infringement Except for the use of PEI’s protected terms in the wallpaper of Welles’ website, we conclude that Welles’ uses of PEI’s trademarks are permissible, nominative uses.
They imply no current sponsorship or endorsement by PEI.
Instead, they serve to identify Welles as a past PEI “Playmate of the Year.” We articulated the test for a permissible, nominative use in New Kids On The Block v. New America Publishing, Inc.
The band, New Kids On The Block, claimed trademark infringement arising from the use of their trademarked name by several newspapers.
The newspapers had conducted polls asking which member of the band New Kids On The Block was the best and most popular.
The papers’ use of the trademarked term did not fall within the traditional fair use doctrine.
Unlike a traditional fair use scenario, the defendant newspaper was using the trademarked term to describe not its own product, but the plaintiff’s.
Thus, the factors used to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 385  evaluate fair use were inapplicable.
The use was nonetheless permissible, we concluded, based on its nominative nature.
We adopted the following test for nominative use: First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; second, only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and third, the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.
We group the uses of PEI’s trademarked terms into three for the purpose of applying the test for nominative use.
1.
Headlines and banner advertisements.
.
.
.
The district court properly identified Welles’ situation as one which must… be excepted.
No descriptive substitute exists for PEI’s trademarks in this context.…Just as the newspapers in New Kids could only identify the band clearly by using its trademarked name, so can Welles only identify herself clearly by using PEI’s trademarked title.
The second part of the nominative use test requires that “only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service[.
]” New Kids provided the following examples to explain this element: “[A] soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to Coca-Cola or Coke, but would not be entitled to use Coca-Cola’s distinctive lettering.” Similarly, in a past case, an auto shop was allowed to use the trademarked term “Volkswagen” on a sign describing the cars it repaired, in part because the shop “did not use Volkswagen’s distinctive lettering style or color scheme, nor did he display the encircled ‘VW’ emblem.” Welles’ banner advertisements and headlines satisfy this element because they use only the trademarked words, not the font or symbols associated with the trademarks.
The third element requires that the user do “nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.” As to this element, we conclude that aside from the wallpaper, which we address separately, Welles does nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by PEI.
The marks are clearly used to describe the title she received from PEI in 1981, a title that helps describe who she is.
It Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 386  would be unreasonable to assume that the Chicago Bulls sponsored a website of Michael Jordan’s simply because his name appeared with the appellation “former Chicago Bull.” Similarly, in this case, it would be unreasonable to assume that PEI currently sponsors or endorses someone who describes herself as a “Playboy Playmate of the Year in 1981.” The designation of the year, in our case, serves the same function as the “former” in our example.
It shows that any sponsorship or endorsement occurred in the past.
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Welles’ use of PEI’s marks in her headlines and banner advertisements is a nominative use excepted from the law of trademark infringement.
2.
Metatags Welles includes the terms “playboy” and “playmate” in her metatags.
Metatags describe the contents of a website using keywords.
Some search engines search metatags to identify websites relevant to a search.
Thus, when an internet searcher enters “playboy” or “playmate” into a search engine that uses metatags, the results will include Welles’ site.
Because Welles’ metatags do not repeat the terms extensively, her site will not be at the top of the list of search results.
Applying the three-factor test for nominative use, we conclude that the use of the trademarked terms in Welles’ metatags is nominative.
As we discussed above with regard to the headlines and banner advertisements, Welles has no practical way of describing herself without using trademarked terms.
In the context of metatags, we conclude that she has no practical way of identifying the content of her website without referring to PEI’s trademarks.
.
.
.
Precluding their use would have the unwanted effect of hindering the free flow of information on the internet, something which is certainly not a goal of trademark law.
Accordingly, the use of trademarked terms in the metatags meets the first part of the test for nominative use.…We conclude that the metatags satisfy the second and third elements of the test as well.
The metatags use only so much of the marks as reasonably necessary and nothing is done in conjunction with them to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.
We note that our decision might differ if the metatags listed the trademarked term so repeatedly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 387  that Welles’ site would regularly appear above PEI’s in searches for one of the trademarked terms.
3.
Wallpaper/watermark.
The background, or wallpaper, of Welles’ site consists of the repeated abbreviation “PMOY ’81,” which stands for “Playmate of the Year 1981.” Welles’ name or likeness does not appear before or after “PMOY ’81.” The pattern created by the repeated abbreviation appears as the background of the various pages of the website.
Accepting, for the purposes of this appeal, that the abbreviation “PMOY” is indeed entitled to protection, we conclude that the repeated, stylized use of this abbreviation fails the nominative use test.
The repeated depiction of “PMOY ‘81” is not necessary to describe Welles.
“Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981” is quite adequate.
Moreover, the term does not even appear to describe Welles— her name or likeness do not appear before or after each “PMOY ’81.” Because the use of the abbreviation fails the first prong of the nominative use test, we need not apply the next two prongs of the test.
Because the defense of nominative use fails here, and we have already determined that the doctrine of fair use does not apply, we remand to the district court.
The court must determine whether trademark law protects the abbreviation “PMOY,” as used in the wallpaper.
B.
Trademark Dilution [At this point, the court considers and rejects PEI’s claim for trademark dilution.]
Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment as to PEI’s claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution, with the sole exception of the use of the abbreviation “PMOY.” We reverse as to the abbreviation and remand for consideration of whether it merits protection under either an infringement or a dilution theory.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Do you agree with the court’s decision that there is no dilution here?
2.
If PMOY is not a registered trademark, why does the court discuss it?
3.
What does “nominative use” mean in the context of this case?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 388  4.
In business terms, why would PEI even think that it was losing money, or could lose money, based on Welles’s use of its identifying marks?
10.6 Summary and Exercises Summary The products of the human mind are at the root of all business, but they are legally protectable only to a certain degree.
Inventions that are truly novel may qualify for a twenty-year patent; the inventor may then prohibit anyone from using the art (machine, process, manufacture, and the like) or license it on his own terms.
A business may sue a person who improperly gives away its legitimate trade secrets, but it may not prevent others from using the unpatented trade secret once publicly disclosed.
Writers or painters, sculptors, composers, and other creative artists may generally protect the expression of their ideas for the duration of their lives plus seventy years, as long as the ideas are fixed in some tangible medium.
That means that they may prevent others from copying their words (or painting, etc.
), but they may not prevent anyone from talking about or using their ideas.
Finally, one who markets a product or service may protect its trademark or service or other mark that is distinctive or has taken on a secondary meaning, but may lose it if the mark becomes the generic term for the goods or services.

The various kinds of interests (or “estates”) in real property 2.
The various rights that come with ownership of real property 3.
What easements are, how they are created, and how they function 4.
How ownership of real property is regulated by tort law, by agreement, and by the public interest (through eminent domain) 5.
The various ways in which environmental laws affect the ownership and use of real property Real property is an important part of corporate as well as individual wealth.
As a consequence, the role of the corporate real estate manager has become critically important within the corporation.
The real estate manager must be aware not only of the value of land for purchase and sale but also of proper lease negotiation, tax policies and assessments, zoning and land development, and environmental laws.
In this chapter and in Chapter 12 "The Transfer of Real Estate by Sale" and Chapter 13 "Landlord and Tenant Law", we focus on regulation of land use and the environment (see Figure 11.1 "Chapter Overview").
We divide our discussion of the nature of real estate into three major categories: (1) estates; (2) rights that are incidental to the possession and ownership of land—for example, the right to air, water, and minerals; and (3) easements—the rights in lands of others.
11.1 Estates LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Distinguish between the various kinds of estates, or interests, in real property that the law recognizes.
In property law, an estate is an interest in real property, ranging from absolute dominion and control to bare possession.
Ordinarily when we think of property, we think of only one kind: absolute ownership.
The owner of a car has the right to drive it where and when she wants, rebuild it, repaint it, and sell it or scrap it.
The notion that the owner might lose her property when a particular event happens is foreign to our concept of personal property.
Not so with real property.
You would doubtless think it odd if you were sold a used car subject to the condition that you not paint it a different color—and that if you did, you would automatically be stripped of ownership.
But land can be sold that way.
Land and other real property can be divided into Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 392  many categories of interests, as we will see.
(Be careful not to confuse the various types of interests in real property with the forms of ownership, such as joint tenancy.
An interest in real property that amounts to an estate is a measure of the degree to which a thing is owned; the form of ownership deals with the particular person or persons who own it.)
Figure 11.1 Chapter Overview Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 393  The common law distinguishes estates along two main axes: (1) freeholds versus leaseholds and (2) present versus future interests.
A freehold estate is an interest in land that has an uncertain duration.
The freehold can be outright ownership—called the fee simple absolute—or it can be an interest in the land for the life of the possessor; in either case, it is impossible to say exactly how long the estate will last.
In the case of one who owns property outright, her estate will last until she sells or transfers it; in the case of a life estate, it will last until the death of the owner or another specified individual.
A leasehold estate is one whose termination date is usually known.
A one-year lease, for example, will expire precisely at the time stated in the lease agreement.
A present estate is one that is currently owned and enjoyed; a future estate is one that will come into the owner’s possession upon the occurrence of a particular event.
In this chapter, we Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 394  consider both present and future freehold interests; leasehold interests we save for Chapter 13 "Landlord and Tenant Law".
Present Estates (Freeholds) Fee Simple Absolute The strongest form of ownership is known as the fee simple absolute (or fee simple, or merely fee).
This is what we think of when we say that someone “owns” the land.
As one court put it, “The grant of a fee in land conveys to the grantee complete ownership, immediately and forever, with the right of possession from boundary to boundary and from the center of the earth to the sky, together with all the lawful uses thereof.” [1]Although the fee simple may be encumbered by a mortgage (you may borrow money against the equity in your home) or an easement (you may grant someone the right to walk across your backyard), the underlying control is in the hands of the owner.
Though it was once a complex matter in determining whether a person had been given a fee simple interest, today the law presumes that the estate being transferred is a fee simple, unless the conveyance expressly states to the contrary.
(In her will, Lady Gaga grants her five-thousand-acre ranch “to my screen idol, Tilda Swinton.” On the death of Lady Gaga, Swinton takes ownership of the ranch outright in fee simple absolute.)
Fee Simple Defeasible Not every transfer of real property creates a fee simple absolute.
Some transfers may limit the estate.
Any transfer specifying that the ownership will terminate upon a particular happening is known as a fee simple defeasible.
Suppose, for example, that Mr. Warbucks conveys a tract of land “to Miss Florence Nightingale, for the purpose of operating her hospital and for no other purpose.
Conveyance to be good as long as hospital remains on the property.” This grant of land will remain the property of Miss Nightingale and her heirs as long as she and they maintain a hospital.
When they stop doing so, the land will automatically revert to Mr. Warbucks or his heirs, without their having to do anything to regain title.
Note that the conveyance of land could be perpetual but is not absolute, because it will remain the property of Miss Nightingale only so long as she observes the conditions in the grant.
Life Estates Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 395  An estate measured by the life of a particular person is called a life estate.
A conventional life estate is created privately by the parties themselves.
The simplest form is that conveyed by the following words: “to Scarlett for life.” Scarlett becomes a life tenant; as such, she is the owner of the property and may occupy it for life or lease it or even sell it, but the new tenant or buyer can acquire only as much as Scarlett has to give, which is ownership for her life (i.e., all she can sell is a life estate in the land, not a fee simple absolute).
If Scarlett sells the house and dies a month later, the buyer’s interest would terminate.
A life estate may be based on the life of someone other than the life tenant: “to Scarlett for the life of Rhett.” The life tenant may use the property as though he were the owner in fee simple absolute with this exception: he may not act so as to diminish the value of the property that will ultimately go to the remainderman—the person who will become owner when the life estate terminates.
The life tenant must pay the life estate for ordinary upkeep of the property, but the remainderman is responsible for extraordinary repairs.
Some life estates are created by operation of law and are known as legal life estates.
The most common form is a widow’s interest in the real property of her husband.
In about one-third of the states, a woman is entitled to dower, a right to a percentage (often one-third) of the property of her husband when he dies.
Most of these states give a widower a similar interest in the property of his deceased wife.
Dower is an alternative to whatever is bequeathed in the will; the widow has the right to elect the share stated in the will or the share available under dower.
To prevent the dower right from upsetting the interests of remote purchasers, the right may be waived on sale by having the spouse sign the deed.
Future Estates To this point, we have been considering present estates.
But people also can have future interests in real property.
Despite the implications of its name, the future interest is owned now but is not available to be used or enjoyed now.
For the most part, future interests may be bought and sold, just as land held in fee simple absolute may be bought and sold.
There are several classes of future interests, but in general there are two major types: reversion and remainder.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 396  Reversion A reversion arises whenever the estate transferred has a duration less than that originally owned by the transferor.
A typical example of a simple reversion is that which arises when a life estate is conveyed.
The ownership conveyed is only for the life; when the life tenant dies, the ownership interest reverts to the grantor.
Suppose the grantor has died in the meantime.
Who gets the reversion interest?
Since the reversion is a class of property that is owned now, it can be inherited, and the grantor’s heirs would take the reversion at the subsequent death of the life tenant.
Remainder The transferor need not keep the reversion interest for himself.
He can give that interest to someone else, in which case it is known as a remainder interest, because the remainder of the property is being transferred.
Suppose the transferor conveys land with these words: “to Scarlett for life and then to Rhett.” Scarlett has a life estate; the remainder goes to Rhett in fee simple absolute.
Rhett is said to have a vested remainder interest, because on Scarlett’s death, he or his heirs will automatically become owners of the property.
Some remainder interests are contingent—and are therefore known as contingent remainder interests—on the happening of a certain event: “to my mother for her life, then to my sister if she marries Harold before my mother dies.” The transferor’s sister will become the owner of the property in fee simple only if she marries Harold while her mother is alive; otherwise, the property will revert to the transferor or his heirs.
The number of permutations of reversions and remainders can become quite complex, far more than we have space to discuss in this text.
KEY TAKEAWAY An estate is an interest in real property.
Estates are of many kinds, but one generic difference is between ownership estates and possessory estates.
Fee simple estates and life estates are ownership estates, while leasehold interests are possessory.
Among ownership estates, the principal division is between present estates and future estates.
An owner of a future estate has an interest that can be bought and sold and that will ripen into present possession at the end of a period of time, at the end of the life of another, or with the happening of some contingent event.

11.2 Rights Incident to Possession and Ownership of Real Estate LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Understand that property owners have certain rights in the airspace above their land, in the minerals beneath their land, and even in water that adjoins their land.
Rights to Airspace The traditional rule was stated by Lord Coke: “Whoever owns the soil owns up to the sky.” This traditional rule remains valid today, but its application can cause problems.
A simple example would be a person who builds an extension to the upper story of his house so that it hangs out over the edge of his property line and thrusts into the airspace of his neighbor.
That would clearly be an encroachment on the neighbor’s property.
But is it trespass when an airplane—or an earth satellite—flies over your backyard?
Obviously, the courts must balance the right to travel against landowners’ rights.
In U.S. v. Causby, [1] the Court determined that flights over private land may constitute a diminution in the property value if they are so low and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of land.
Rights to the Depths Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 398  Lord Coke’s dictum applies to the depths as well as the sky.
The owner of the surface has the right to the oil, gas, and minerals below it, although this right can be severed and sold separately.
Perplexing questions may arise in the case of oil and gas, which can flow under the surface.
Some states say that oil and gas can be owned by the owner of the surface land; others say that they are not owned until actually extracted—although the property owner may sell the exclusive right to extract them from his land.
But states with either rule recognize that oil and gas are capable of being “captured” by drilling that causes oil or gas from under another plot of land to run toward the drilled hole.
Since the possibility of capture can lead to wasteful drilling practices as everyone nearby rushes to capture the precious commodities, many states have enacted statutes requiring landowners to share the resources.
Rights to Water The right to determine how bodies of water will be used depends on basic property rules.
Two different approaches to water use in the United States—eastern and western—have developed over time (see Figure 11.2 "Water Rights").
Eastern states, where water has historically been more plentiful, have adopted the so-called riparian rights theory, which itself can take two forms.
Riparian refers to land that includes a part of the bed of a waterway or that borders on a public watercourse.
A riparian owner is one who owns such land.
What are the rights of upstream and downstream owners of riparian land regarding use of the waters?
One approach is the “natural flow” doctrine: Each riparian owner is entitled to have the river or other waterway maintained in its natural state.
The upstream owner may use the river for drinking water or for washing but may not divert it to irrigate his crops or to operate his mill if doing so would materially change the amount of the flow or the quality of the water.
Virtually all eastern states today are not so restrictive and rely instead on a “reasonable use” doctrine, which permits the benefit to be derived from use of the waterway to be weighed against the gravity of the harm.
This approach is illustrated in Hoover v. Crane, (seeSection 11.6.1 "Reasonable Use Doctrine".
[2] Figure 11.2 Water Rights Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 399  In contrast to riparian rights doctrines, western states have adopted the prior appropriation doctrine.
This rule looks not to equality of interests but to priority in time: first in time is first in right.
The first person to use the water for a beneficial purpose has a right superior to latecomers.
This rule applies even if the first user takes all the water for his own needs and even if other users are riparian owners.
This rule developed in water-scarce states in which development depended on incentives to use rather than hoard water.
Today, the prior appropriation doctrine has come under criticism because it gives incentives to those who already have the right to the water to continue to use it profligately, rather than to those who might develop more efficient means of using it.
KEY TAKEAWAY Property owners have certain rights in the airspace above their land.
They also have rights in subsurface minerals, which include oil and gas.
Those property owners who have bodies of water adjacent to their land will also have certain rights to withdraw or impound water for their own use.
Regarding US water law, the reasonable use doctrine in the eastern states is distinctly different from the prior appropriation doctrine in western states.
EXERCISES 1.
Steve Hannaford farms in western Nebraska.
The farm has passed to succeeding generations of Hannafords, who use water from the North Platte River for irrigation purposes.
The headlands of the North Platte are in Colorado, but use of the water from the North Platte by Nebraskans preceded use of the water by settlers in Colorado.
What theory of water rights governs Nebraska and Colorado residents?
Can the state of Colorado divert and use water in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 400  such a way that less of it reaches western Nebraska and the Hannaford farm?

11.3 Easements: Rights in the Lands of Others LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain the difference between an easement and a license.
2.
Describe the ways in which easements can be created.
Definition An easement is an interest in land created by agreement that permits one person to make use of another’s estate.
This interest can extend to a profit, the taking of something from the other’s land.
Though the common law once distinguished between an easement and profit, today the distinction has faded, and profits are treated as a type of easement.
An easement must be distinguished from a mere license, which is permission, revocable at the will of the owner, to make use of the owner’s land.
An easement is an estate; a license is personal to the grantee and is not assignable.
The two main types of easements are affirmative and negative.
An affirmative easement gives a landowner the right to use the land of another (e.g., crossing it or using water from it), while a negative easement, by contrast, prohibits the landowner from using his land in ways that would affect the holder of the easement.
For example, the builder of a solar home would want to obtain negative easements from neighbors barring them from building structures on their land that would block sunlight from falling on the solar home.
With the growth of solar energy, some Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 401  states have begun to provide stronger protection by enacting laws that regulate one’s ability to interfere with the enjoyment of sunlight.
These laws range from a relatively weak statute in Colorado, which sets forth rules for obtaining easements, to the much stronger statute in California, which says in effect that the owner of a solar device has a vested right to continue to receive the sunlight.
Another important distinction is made between easements appurtenant and easements in gross.
An easement appurtenant benefits the owner of adjacent land.
The easement is thus appurtenant to the holder’s land.
The benefited land is called thedominant tenement, and the burdened land—that is, the land subject to the easement—is called the servient tenement (see Figure 11.3 "Easement Appurtenant").
An easement in gross is granted independent of the easement holder’s ownership or possession of land.
It is simply an independent right—for example, the right granted to a local delivery service to drive its trucks across a private roadway to gain access to homes at the other end.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 402  Figure 11.3 Easement Appurtenant Unless it is explicitly limited to the grantee, an easement appurtenant “runs with the land.” That is, when the dominant tenement is sold or otherwise conveyed, the new owner automatically owns the easement.
A commercial easement in gross may be transferred—for instance, easements to construct pipelines, telegraph and telephone lines, and railroad rights of way.
However, most noncommercial easements in gross are not transferable, being deemed personal to the original owner of the easement.
Rochelle sells her friend Mrs. Nanette—who does not own land adjacent to Rochelle—an easement across her country farm to operate skimobiles during the winter.
The easement is personal to Mrs. Nanette; she could not sell the easement to anyone else.
Creation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 403  Easements may be created by express agreement, either in deeds or in wills.
The owner of the dominant tenement may buy the easement from the owner of the servient tenement or may reserve the easement for himself when selling part of his land.
But courts will sometimes allow implied easements under certain circumstances.
For instance, if the deed refers to an easement that bounds the premises—without describing it in any detail—a court could conclude that an easement was intended to pass with the sale of the property.
An easement can also be implied from prior use.
Suppose a seller of land has two lots, with a driveway connecting both lots to the street.
The only way to gain access to the street from the back lot is to use the driveway, and the seller has always done so.
If the seller now sells the back lot, the buyer can establish an easement in the driveway through the front lot if the prior use was (1) apparent at the time of sale, (2) continuous, and (3) reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the back lot.
The rule of implied easements through prior use operates only when the ownership of the dominant and servient tenements was originally in the same person.
Use of the Easement The servient owner may use the easement—remember, it is on or under or above his land—as long as his use does not interfere with the rights of the easement owner.
Suppose you have an easement to walk along a path in the woods owned by your neighbor and to swim in a private lake that adjoins the woods.
At the time you purchased the easement, your neighbor did not use the lake.
Now he proposes to swim in it himself, and you protest.
You would not have a sound case, because his swimming in the lake would not interfere with your right to do so.
But if he proposed to clear the woods and build a mill on it, obliterating the path you took to the lake and polluting the lake with chemical discharges, then you could obtain an injunction to bar him from interfering with your easement.
The owner of the dominant tenement is not restricted to using his land as he was at the time he became the owner of the easement.
The courts will permit him to develop the land in some “normal” manner.
For example, an easement on a private roadway for the benefit of a large estate up in the hills would not be lost if the large estate were ultimately subdivided and many new owners wished to use the roadway; the easement applies to the entire portion of the original dominant tenement, not merely to the part that abuts the easement itself.
However, the owner Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 404  of an easement appurtenant to one tract of land cannot use the easement on another tract of land, even if the two tracts are adjacent.
KEY TAKEAWAY An easement appurtenant runs with the land and benefits the dominant tenement, burdening the servient tenement.
An easement, generally, has a specific location or description within or over the servient tenement.
Easements can be created by deed, by will, or by implication.
EXERCISE 1.
Beth Delaney owns property next to Kerry Plemmons.
The deed to Delaney’s property notes that she has access to a well on the Plemmons property “to obtain water for household use.” The well has been dry for many generations and has not been used by anyone on the Plemmons property or the Delaney property for as many generations.
The well predated Plemmons’s ownership of the property; as the servient tenement, the Plemmons property was burdened by this easement dating back to 1898.
Plemmons hires a company to dig a very deep well near one of his outbuildings to provide water for his horses.
The location is one hundred yards from the old well.
Does the Delaney property have any easement to use water from the new well?
11.4 Regulation of Land Use LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Compare the various ways in which law limits or restricts the right to use your land in any way that you decide is best for you.
2.
Distinguish between regulation by common law and regulation by public acts such as zoning or eminent domain.
3.
Understand that property owners may restrict the uses of land by voluntary agreement, subject to important public policy considerations.
Land use regulation falls into three broad categories: (1) restriction on the use of land through tort law, (2) private regulation by agreement, and (3) public ownership or regulation through the powers of eminent domain and zoning.
Regulation of Land Use by Tort Law Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 405  Tort law is used to regulate land use in two ways: (1) The owner may become liable for certain activities carried out on the real estate that affect others beyond the real estate.
(2) The owner may be liable to persons who, upon entering the real estate, are injured.
Landowner’s Activities The two most common torts in this area are nuisance and trespass.
A common-lawnuisance is an interference with the use and enjoyment of one’s land.
Examples of nuisances are excessive noise (especially late at night), polluting activities, and emissions of noxious odors.
But the activity must produce substantial harm, not fleeting, minor injury, and it must produce those effects on the reasonable person, not on someone who is peculiarly allergic to the complained-of activity.
A person who suffered migraine headaches at the sight of croquet being played on a neighbor’s lawn would not likely win a nuisance lawsuit.
While the meaning of nuisance is difficult to define with any precision, this common-law cause of action is a primary means for landowners to obtain damages for invasive environmental harms.
A trespass is the wrongful physical invasion of or entry upon land possessed by another.
Loud noise blaring out of speakers in the house next door might be a nuisance but could not be a trespass, because noise is not a physical invasion.
But spraying pesticides on your gladiolas could constitute a trespass on your neighbor’s property if the pesticide drifts across the boundary.
Nuisance and trespass are complex theories, a full explanation of which would consume far more space than we have.
What is important to remember is that these torts are two-edged swords.
In some situations, the landowner himself will want to use these theories to sue trespassers or persons creating a nuisance, but in other situations, the landowner will be liable under these theories for his own activities.
Injury to Persons Entering the Real Estate Traditionally, liability for injury has depended on the status of the person who enters the real estate.
Trespassers If the person is an intruder without permission—a trespasser—the landowner owes him no duty of care unless he knows of the intruder’s presence, in which case the owner must exercise Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 406  reasonable care in his activities and warn of hidden dangers on his land of which he is aware.
A known trespasser is someone whom the landowner actually sees on the property or whom he knows frequently intrudes on the property, as in the case of someone who habitually walks across the land.
If a landowner knows that people frequently walk across his property and one day he puts a poisonous chemical on the ground to eliminate certain insects, he is obligated to warn those who continue to walk on the grounds.
Intentional injury to known trespassers is not allowed, even if the trespasser is a criminal intent on robbery, for the law values human life above property rights.
Children If the trespasser is a child, a different rule applies in most states.
This is the doctrine ofattractive nuisance.
Originally this rule was enunciated to deal with cases in which something on the land attracted the child to it, like a swimming pool.
In recent years, most courts have dropped the requirement that the child must have been attracted to the danger.
Instead, the following elements of proof are necessary to make out a case of attractive nuisance (Restatement of Torts, Section 339): 1.
The child must have been injured by a structure or other artificial condition.
2.
The possessor of the land (not necessarily the owner) must have known or should have known that young children would be likely to trespass.
3.
The possessor must have known or should have known that the artificial condition exists and that it posed an unreasonable risk of serious injury.
4.
The child must have been too young to appreciate the danger that the artificial condition posed.
5.
The risk to the child must have far outweighed the utility of the artificial condition to the possessor.
6.
The possessor did not exercise reasonable care in protecting the child or eliminating the danger.
Old refrigerators, open gravel pits, or mechanisms that a curious child would find inviting are all examples of attractive nuisance.
Suppose Farmer Brown keeps an old buggy on his front lawn, accessible from the street.
A five-year-old boy clambers up the buggy one day, falls through a rotted floorboard, and breaks his leg.
Is Farmer Brown liable?
Probably so.
The child was too young to appreciate the danger posed by the buggy, a structure.
The farmer should have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 407  appreciated that young children would be likely to come onto the land when they saw the buggy and that they would be likely to climb up onto the buggy.
Moreover, he should have known, if he did not know in fact, that the buggy, left outside for years without being tended, would pose an unreasonable risk.
The buggy’s utility as a decoration was far overbalanced by the risk that it posed to children, and the farmer failed to exercise reasonable care.
Licensees A nontrespasser who comes onto the land without being invited, or if invited, comes for purposes unconnected with any business conducted on the premises, is known as alicensee.
This class of visitors to the land consists of (1) social guests (people you invite to your home for a party); (2) a salesman, not invited by the owner, who wishes to sell something to the owner or occupier of the property; and (3) persons visiting a building for a purpose not connected with the business on the land (e.g., students who visit a factory to see how it works).
The landowner owes the same duty of care to licensees that he owes to known trespassers.
That is, he must warn them against hidden dangers of which he is aware, and he must exercise reasonable care in his activities to ensure that they are not injured.
Invitees A final category of persons entering land is that of invitee.
This is one who has been invited onto the land, usually, though not necessarily, for a business purpose of potential economic benefit to the owner or occupier of the premises.
This category is confusing because it sounds as though it should include social guests (who clearly are invited onto the premises), but traditionally social guests are said to be licensees.
Invitees include customers of stores, users of athletic and other clubs, customers of repair shops, strollers through public parks, restaurant and theater patrons, hotel guests, and the like.
From the owner’s perspective, the major difference between licensees and invitees is that he is liable for injuries resulting to the latter from hidden dangers that he should have been aware of, even if he is not actually aware of the dangers.
How hidden the dangers are and how broad the owner’s liability is depends on the circumstances, but liability sometimes can be quite broad.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 408  Difficult questions arise in lawsuits brought by invitees (or business invitees, as they are sometimes called) when the actions of persons other than the landowner contribute to the injury.
The foregoing rules dealing with liability for persons entering the land are the traditional rules at common law.
In recent years, some courts have moved away from the rigidities and sometimes perplexing differences between trespassers, licensees, and invitees.
By court decision, several states have now abolished such distinctions and hold the proprietor, owner, or occupier liable for failing to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition.
According to the California Supreme Court, A man’s life or limb does not become less worthy of protection by the law nor a loss less worthy of compensation under the law because he has come upon the land of another without permission or with permission but without a business purpose.
Reasonable people do not ordinarily vary their conduct depending upon such matters, and to focus upon the status of the injured party as a trespasser, licensee, or invitee in order to determine the question whether the landowner has a duty of care, is contrary to our modern social mores and humanitarian values.
Where the occupier of land is aware of a concealed condition involving in the absence of precautions an unreasonable risk of harm to those coming in contact with it and is aware that a person on the premises is about to come in contact with it, the trier of fact can reasonably conclude that a failure to warn or to repair the condition constitutes negligence.
Whether or not a guest has a right to expect that his host will remedy dangerous conditions on his account, he should reasonably be entitled to rely upon a warning of the dangerous condition so that he, like the host, will be in a position to take special precautions when he comes in contact with it.
[1] Private Regulation of Land Use by Agreement A restrictive covenant is an agreement regarding the use of land that “runs with the land.” In effect, it is a contractual promise that becomes part of the property and that binds future owners.
Violations of covenants can be redressed in court in suits for damages or injunctions but will not result in reversion of the land to the seller.
Usually, courts construe restrictive covenants narrowly—that is, in a manner most conducive to free use of the land by the ultimate owner (the person against whom enforcement of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 409  covenant is being sought).
Sometimes, even when the meaning of the covenant is clear, the courts will not enforce it.
For example, when the character of a neighborhood changes, the courts may declare the covenant a nullity.
Thus a restriction on a one-acre parcel to residential purposes was voided when in the intervening thirty years a host of businesses grew up around it, including a bowling alley, restaurant, poolroom, and sewage disposal plant.
[2] An important nullification of restrictive covenants came in 1947 when the US Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional racially restrictive covenants, which barred blacks and other minorities from living on land so burdened.
The Supreme Court reasoned that when a court enforces such a covenant, it acts in a discriminatory manner (barring blacks but not whites from living in a home burdened with the covenant) and thus violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws.
[3] Public Control of Land Use through Eminent Domain The government may take private property for public purposes.
Its power to do so is known as eminent domain.
The power of eminent domain is subject to constitutional limitations.
Under the Fifth Amendment, the property must be put to public use, and the owner is entitled to “just compensation” for his loss.
These requirements are sometimes difficult to apply.
Public Use The requirement of public use normally means that the property will be useful to the public once the state has taken possession—for example, private property might be condemned to construct a highway.
Although not allowed in most circumstances, the government could even condemn someone’s property in order to turn around and sell it to another individual, if a legitimate public purpose could be shown.
For example, a state survey in the mid-1960s showed that the government owned 49 percent of Hawaii’s land.
Another 47 percent was controlled by seventy- two private landowners.
Because this concentration of land ownership (which dated back to feudal times) resulted in a critical shortage of residential land, the Hawaiian legislature enacted a law allowing the government to take land from large private estates and resell it in smaller parcels to homeowners.
In 1984, the US Supreme Court upheld the law, deciding that the land was being taken for a public use because the purpose was “to attack certain perceived evils of concentrated property ownership.” [4] Although the use must be public, the courts will not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 410  inquire into the necessity of the use or whether other property might have been better suited.
It is up to government authorities to determine whether and where to build a road, not the courts.
The limits of public use were amply illustrated in the Supreme Court’s 2002 decision ofKelo v. New London, [5] in which Mrs. Kelo’s house was condemned so that the city of New London, in Connecticut, could create a marina and industrial park to lease to Pfizer Corporation.
The city’s motives were to create a higher tax base for property taxes.
The Court, following precedent in Midkiff and other cases, refused to invalidate the city’s taking on constitutional grounds.
Reaction from states was swift; many states passed new laws restricting the bases for state and municipal governments to use powers of eminent domain, and many of these laws also provided additional compensation to property owners whose land was taken.
Just Compensation The owner is ordinarily entitled to the fair market value of land condemned under eminent domain.
This value is determined by calculating the most profitable use of the land at the time of the taking, even though it was being put to a different use.
The owner will have a difficult time collecting lost profits; for instance, a grocery store will not usually be entitled to collect for the profits it might have made during the next several years, in part because it can presumably move elsewhere and continue to make profits and in part because calculating future profits is inherently speculative.
Taking The most difficult question in most modern cases is whether the government has in fact “taken” the property.
This is easy to answer when the government acquires title to the property through condemnation proceedings.
But more often, a government action is challenged when a law or regulation inhibits the use of private land.
Suppose a town promulgates a setback ordinance, requiring owners along city sidewalks to build no closer to the sidewalk than twenty feet.
If the owner of a small store had only twenty-five feet of land from the sidewalk line, the ordinance would effectively prevent him from housing his enterprise, and the ordinance would be a taking.
Challenging such ordinances can sometimes be difficult under traditional tort theories because the government is immune from suit in some of these cases.
Instead, a theory of inverse condemnation has developed, in which the plaintiff private property owner asserts that the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 411  government has condemned the property, though not through the traditional mechanism of a condemnation proceeding.
Public Control of Land Use through Zoning Zoning is a technique by which a city or other municipality regulates the type of activity to be permitted in geographical areas within its boundaries.
Though originally limited to residential, commercial, and industrial uses, today’s zoning ordinances are complex sets of regulations.
A typical municipality might have the following zones: residential with a host of subcategories (such as for single-family and multiple-family dwellings), office, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and public lands.
Zones may be exclusive, in which case office buildings would not be permitted in commercial zones, or they may be cumulative, so that a more restricted use would be allowed in a less restrictive zone.
Zoning regulations do more than specify the type of use: they often also dictate minimum requirements for parking, open usable space, setbacks, lot sizes, and the like, and maximum requirements for height, length of side lots, and so on.
Nonconforming Uses When a zoning ordinance is enacted, it will almost always affect existing property owners, many of whom will be using their land in ways no longer permitted under the ordinance.
To avoid the charge that they have thereby “taken” the property, most ordinances permit previous nonconforming uses to continue, though some ordinances limit the nonconforming uses to a specified time after becoming effective.
But this permission to continue a nonconforming use is narrow; it extends only to the specific use to which the property was put before the ordinance was enacted.
A manufacturer of dresses that suddenly finds itself in an area zoned residential may continue to use its sewing machines, but it could not develop a sideline in woodworking.
Variances Sometimes an owner may desire to use his property in ways not permitted under an existing zoning scheme and will ask the zoning board for a variance—authority to carry on a nonconforming use.
The board is not free to grant a variance at its whim.
The courts apply three general tests to determine the validity of a variance: (1) The land must be unable to yield a reasonable return on the uses allowed by the zoning regulation.
(2) The hardship must be Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 412  unique to the property, not to property generally in the area.
(3) If granted, the variance must not change the essential character of the neighborhood.
KEY TAKEAWAY Land use regulation can mean (1) restrictions on the use of land through tort law, (2) private regulation—by agreement, or (3) regulation through powers of eminent domain or zoning.
EXERCISES 1.
Give one example of the exercise of eminent domain.
In order to exercise its power under eminent domain, must the government actually take eventual ownership of the property that is “taken”?

11.5 Environmental Law Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 413  LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the major federal laws that govern business activities that may adversely affect air quality and water quality.
2.
Describe the major federal laws that govern waste disposal and chemical hazards including pesticides.
In one sense, environmental law is very old.
Medieval England had smoke control laws that established the seasons when soft coal could be burned.
Nuisance laws give private individuals a limited control over polluting activities of adjacent landowners.
But a comprehensive set of US laws directed toward general protection of the environment is largely a product of the past quarter-century, with most of the legislative activity stemming from the late 1960s and later, when people began to perceive that the environment was systematically deteriorating from assaults by rapid population growth and greatly increased automobile driving, vast proliferation of factories that generate waste products, and a sharp rise in the production of toxic materials.
Two of the most significant developments in environmental law came in 1970, when the National Environmental Policy Act took effect and the Environmental Protection Agency became the first of a number of new federal administrative agencies to be established during the decade.
National Environmental Policy Act Signed into law by President Nixon on January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) declared that it shall be the policy of the federal government, in cooperation with state and local governments, “to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.…The Congress recognizes that each person should enjoy a healthful environment and that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.” [1] The most significant aspect of NEPA is its requirement that federal agencies prepare anenvironmental impact statement in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and whenever undertaking a major federal action that significantly affects environmental quality.
The statement must (1) detail the environmental impact of the proposed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 414  action, (2) list any unavoidable adverse impacts should the action be taken, (3) consider alternatives to the proposed action, (4) compare short-term and long-term consequences, and (5) describe irreversible commitments of resources.
Unless the impact statement is prepared, the project can be enjoined from proceeding.
Note that NEPA does not apply to purely private activities but only to those proposed to be carried out in some manner by federal agencies.
Environmental Protection Agency The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been in the forefront of the news since its creation in 1970.
Charged with monitoring environmental practices of industry, assisting the government and private business to halt environmental deterioration, promulgating regulations consistent with federal environmental policy, and policing industry for violations of the various federal environmental statutes and regulations, the EPA has had a pervasive influence on American business.
Business Week noted the following in 1977: “Cars rolling off Detroit’s assembly line now have antipollution devices as standard equipment.
The dense black smokestack emissions that used to symbolize industrial prosperity are rare, and illegal, sights.
Plants that once blithely ran discharge water out of a pipe and into a river must apply for permits that are almost impossible to get unless the plants install expensive water treatment equipment.
All told, the EPA has made a sizable dent in man-made environmental filth.” [2] The EPA is especially active in regulating water and air pollution and in overseeing the disposition of toxic wastes and chemicals.
To these problems we now turn.
Water Pollution Clean Water Act Legislation governing the nation’s waterways goes back a long time.
The first federal water pollution statute was the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
Congress enacted new laws in 1948, 1956, 1965, 1966, and 1970.
But the centerpiece of water pollution enforcement is the Clean Water Act of 1972 (technically, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972), as amended in 1977 and by the Water Quality Act of 1987.
The Clean Water Act is designed to restore and maintain the “chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” [3] It operates on the states, requiring them to designate the uses of every significant Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 415  body of water within their borders (e.g., for drinking water, recreation, commercial fishing) and to set water quality standards to reduce pollution to levels appropriate for each use.
Congress only has power to regulate interstate commerce, and so the Clean Water Act is applicable only to “navigable waters” of the United States.
This has led to disputes over whether the act can apply, say, to an abandoned gravel pit that has no visible connection to navigable waterways, even if the gravel pit provides habitat for migratory birds.
In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps of Engineers, the US Supreme Court said no.
[4] Private Industry The Clean Water Act also governs private industry and imposes stringent standards on the discharge of pollutants into waterways and publicly owned sewage systems.
The act created an effluent permit system known as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
To discharge any pollutants into navigable waters from a “point source” like a pipe, ditch, ship, or container, a company must obtain a certification that it meets specified standards, which are continually being tightened.
For example, until 1983, industry had to use the “best practicable technology” currently available, but after July 1, 1984, it had to use the “best available technology” economically achievable.
Companies must limit certain kinds of “conventional pollutants” (such as suspended solids and acidity) by “best conventional control technology.” Other EPA Water Activities Federal law governs, and the EPA regulates, a number of other water control measures.
Ocean dumping, for example, is the subject of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, which gives the EPA jurisdiction over wastes discharged into the oceans.
The Clean Water Act gives the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers authority to protect waters, marshlands, and other wetlands against degradation caused by dredging and fills.
The EPA also oversees state and local plans for restoring general water quality to acceptable levels in the face of a host of non-point-source pollution.
The Clean Water Act controls municipal sewage systems, which must ensure that wastewater is chemically treated before being discharged from the sewage system.
Obviously, of critical importance to the nation’s health is the supply of drinking water.
To ensure its continuing purity, Congress enacted the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, with amendments Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 416  passed in 1986 and 1996.
This act aims to protect water at its sources: rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and groundwater wells.
(The act does not regulate private wells that serve fewer than twenty-five individuals.)
This law has two strategies for combating pollution of drinking water.
It establishes national standards for drinking water derived from both surface reservoirs and underground aquifers.
It also authorizes the EPA to regulate the injection of solid wastes into deep wells (as happens, for instance, by leakage from underground storage tanks).
Air Pollution The centerpiece of the legislative effort to clean the atmosphere is the Clean Air Act of 1970 (amended in 1975, 1977, and 1990).
Under this act, the EPA has set two levels of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
The primary standards limit the ambient (i.e., circulating) pollution that affects human health; secondary standards limit pollution that affects animals, plants, and property.
The heart of the Clean Air Act is the requirement that subject to EPA approval, the states implement the standards that the EPA establishes.
The setting of these pollutant standards was coupled with directing the states to develop state implementation plans (SIPs), applicable to appropriate industrial sources in the state, in order to achieve these standards.
The act was amended in 1977 and 1990 primarily to set new goals (dates) for achieving attainment of NAAQS since many areas of the country had failed to meet the deadlines.
Beyond the NAAQS, the EPA has established several specific standards to control different types of air pollution.
One major type is pollution that mobile sources, mainly automobiles, emit.
The EPA requires new cars to be equipped with catalytic converters and to use unleaded gasoline to eliminate the most noxious fumes and to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere.
To minimize pollution from stationary sources, the EPA also imposes uniform standards on new industrial plants and those that have been substantially modernized.
And to safeguard against emissions from older plants, states must promulgate and enforce SIPs.
The Clean Air Act is even more solicitous of air quality in certain parts of the nation, such as designated wilderness areas and national parks.
For these areas, the EPA has set standards to prevent significant deterioration in order to keep the air as pristine and clear as it was centuries ago.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 417  The EPA also worries about chemicals so toxic that the tiniest quantities could prove fatal or extremely hazardous to health.
To control emission of substances like asbestos, beryllium, mercury, vinyl chloride, benzene, and arsenic, the EPA has established or proposed various National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.
Concern over acid rain and other types of air pollution prompted Congress to add almost eight hundred pages of amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990.
(The original act was fifty pages long.)
As a result of these amendments, the act was modernized in a manner that parallels other environmental laws.
For instance, the amendments established a permit system that is modeled after the Clean Water Act.
And the amendments provide for felony convictions for willful violations, similar to penalties incorporated into other statutes.
The amendments include certain defenses for industry.
Most important, companies are protected from allegations that they are violating the law by showing that they were acting in accordance with a permit.
In addition to this “permit shield,” the law also contains protection for workers who unintentionally violate the law while following their employers’ instructions.
Waste Disposal Though pollution of the air by highly toxic substances like benzene or vinyl chloride may seem a problem removed from that of the ordinary person, we are all in fact polluters.
Every year, the United States generates approximately 230 million tons of “trash”—about 4.6 pounds per person per day.
Less than one-quarter of it is recycled; the rest is incinerated or buried in landfills.
But many of the country’s landfills have been closed, either because they were full or because they were contaminating groundwater.
Once groundwater is contaminated, it is extremely expensive and difficult to clean it up.
In the 1965 Solid Waste Disposal Act and the 1970 Resource Recovery Act, Congress sought to regulate the discharge of garbage by encouraging waste management and recycling.
Federal grants were available for research and training, but the major regulatory effort was expected to come from the states and municipalities.
But shocking news prompted Congress to get tough in 1976.
The plight of homeowners near Love Canal in upstate New York became a major national story as the discovery of massive underground leaks of toxic chemicals buried during the previous quarter century led to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 418  evacuation of hundreds of homes.
Next came the revelation that Kepone, an exceedingly toxic pesticide, had been dumped into the James River in Virginia, causing a major human health hazard and severe damage to fisheries in the James and downstream in the Chesapeake Bay.
The rarely discussed industrial dumping of hazardous wastes now became an open controversy, and Congress responded in 1976 with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and in 1980 with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act The RCRA expresses a “cradle-to-grave” philosophy: hazardous wastes must be regulated at every stage.
The act gives the EPA power to govern their creation, storage, transport, treatment, and disposal.
Any person or company that generates hazardous waste must obtain a permit (known as a “manifest”) either to store it on its own site or ship it to an EPA-approved treatment, storage, or disposal facility.
No longer can hazardous substances simply be dumped at a convenient landfill.
Owners and operators of such sites must show that they can pay for damage growing out of their operations, and even after the sites are closed to further dumping, they must set aside funds to monitor and maintain the sites safely.
This philosophy can be severe.
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that bankruptcy is not a sufficient reason for a company to abandon toxic waste dumps if state regulations reasonably require protection in the interest of public health or safety.
The practical effect of the ruling is that trustees of the bankrupt company must first devote assets to cleaning up a dump site, and only from remaining assets may they satisfy creditors.
[5]Another severity is RCRA’s imposition of criminal liability, including fines of up to $25,000 a day and one-year prison sentences, which can be extended beyond owners to individual employees, as discussed in U.S. v. Johnson & Towers, Inc., et al., (seeSection 11.6.2 "Criminal Liability of Employees under RCRA").
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act The CERCLA, also known as the Superfund, gives the EPA emergency powers to respond to public health or environmental dangers from faulty hazardous waste disposal, currently estimated to occur at more than seventeen thousand sites around the country.
The EPA can direct immediate removal of wastes presenting imminent danger (e.g., from train wrecks, oil Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 419  spills, leaking barrels, and fires).
Injuries can be sudden and devastating; in 1979, for example, when a freight train derailed in Florida, ninety thousand pounds of chlorine gas escaped from a punctured tank car, leaving 8 motorists dead and 183 others injured and forcing 3,500 residents within a 7-mile radius to be evacuated.
The EPA may also carry out “planned removals” when the danger is substantial, even if immediate removal is not necessary.
The EPA prods owners who can be located to voluntarily clean up sites they have abandoned.
But if the owners refuse, the EPA and the states will undertake the task, drawing on a federal trust fund financed mainly by taxes on the manufacture or import of certain chemicals and petroleum (the balance of the fund comes from general revenues).
States must finance 10 percent of the cost of cleaning up private sites and 50 percent of the cost of cleaning up public facilities.
The EPA and the states can then assess unwilling owners’ punitive damages up to triple the cleanup costs.
Cleanup requirements are especially controversial when applied to landowners who innocently purchased contaminated property.
To deal with this problem, Congress enacted the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act in 1986, which protects innocent landowners who—at the time of purchase—made an “appropriate inquiry” into the prior uses of the property.
The act also requires companies to publicly disclose information about hazardous chemicals they use.
We now turn to other laws regulating chemical hazards.
Chemical Hazards Toxic Substances Control Act Chemical substances that decades ago promised to improve the quality of life have lately shown their negative side—they have serious adverse side effects.
For example, asbestos, in use for half a century, causes cancer and asbestosis, a debilitating lung disease, in workers who breathed in fibers decades ago.
The result has been crippling disease and death and more than thirty thousand asbestos-related lawsuits filed nationwide.
Other substances, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin, have caused similar tragedy.
Together, the devastating effects of chemicals led to enactment of the TSCA, designed to control the manufacture, processing, commercial distribution, use, and disposal of chemicals that pose unreasonable health or environmental risks.
(The TSCA does not apply to pesticides, tobacco, nuclear materials, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 420  firearms and ammunition, food, food additives, drugs, and cosmetics—all are regulated by other federal laws.)
The TSCA gives the EPA authority to screen for health and environmental risks by requiring companies to notify the EPA ninety days before manufacturing or importing new chemicals.
The EPA may demand that the companies test the substances before marketing them and may regulate them in a number of ways, such as requiring the manufacturer to label its products, to keep records on its manufacturing and disposal processes, and to document all significant adverse reactions in people exposed to the chemicals.
The EPA also has authority to ban certain especially hazardous substances, and it has banned the further production of PCBs and many uses of asbestos.
Both industry groups and consumer groups have attacked the TSCA.
Industry groups criticize the act because the enforcement mechanism requires mountainous paperwork and leads to widespread delay.
Consumer groups complain because the EPA has been slow to act against numerous chemical substances.
The debate continues.
Pesticide Regulation The United States is a major user of pesticides, substances that eliminate troublesome insects, rodents, fungi, and bacteria, consuming more than a billion pounds a year in the form of thirty- five thousand separate chemicals.
As useful as they can be, like many chemical substances, pesticides can have serious side effects on humans and plant and animal life.
Beginning in the early 1970s, Congress enacted major amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) of 1906.
These laws direct the EPA to determine whether pesticides properly balance effectiveness against safety.
If the pesticide can carry out its intended function without causing unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment, it may remain on the market.
Otherwise, the EPA has authority to regulate or even ban its distribution and use.
To enable the EPA to carry out its functions, the laws require manufacturers to provide a wealth of data about the way individual pesticides work and their side effects.
The EPA is required to inspect pesticides to ensure that they conform to their labeled purposes, content, and safety, and the agency is empowered to certify pesticides for either general or restricted use.
If a pesticide is restricted, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 421  only those persons certified in approved training programs may use it.
Likewise, under the Pesticide Amendment to the FFDCA, the EPA must establish specific tolerances for the residue of pesticides on feed crops and both raw and processed foods.
The Food and Drug Administration (for agricultural commodities) and the US Department of Agriculture (for meat, poultry, and fish products) enforce these provisions.
Other Types of Environmental Controls Noise Regulation Under the Noise Regulation Act of 1972, Congress has attempted to combat a growing menace to US workers, residents, and consumers.
People who live close to airports and major highways, workers who use certain kinds of machinery (e.g., air compressors, rock drills, bulldozers), and consumers who use certain products, such as power mowers and air conditioners, often suffer from a variety of ailments.
The Noise Regulation Act delegates to the EPA power to limit “noise emissions” from these major sources of noise.
Under the act, manufacturers may not sell new products that fail to conform to the noise standards the EPA sets, and users are forbidden from dismantling noise control devices installed on these products.
Moreover, manufacturers must label noisy products properly.
Private suits may be filed against violators, and the act also permits fines of up to $25,000 per day and a year in jail for those who seek to avoid its terms.
Radiation Controls The terrifying effects of a nuclear disaster became frighteningly clear when the Soviet Union’s nuclear power plant at Chernobyl exploded in early 1986, discharging vast quantities of radiation into the world’s airstream and affecting people thousands of miles away.
In the United States, the most notorious nuclear accident occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear utility in Pennsylvania in 1979, crippling the facility for years because of the extreme danger and long life of the radiation.
Primary responsibility for overseeing nuclear safety rests with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but many other agencies and several federal laws (including the Clean Air Act; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; the CERCLA; and the Ocean Dumping Act) govern the use of nuclear materials and the storage of radioactive wastes (some of which will remain severely Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 422  dangerous for thousands of years).
Through many of these laws, the EPA has been assigned the responsibility of setting radiation guidelines, assessing new technology, monitoring radiation in the environment, setting limits on release of radiation from nuclear utilities, developing guidance for use of X-rays in medicine, and helping to plan for radiation emergencies.
KEY TAKEAWAY Laws limiting the use of one’s property have been around for many years; common-law restraints (e.g., the law of nuisance) exist as causes of action against those who would use their property to adversely affect the life or health of others or the value of their neighbors’ property.
Since the 1960s, extensive federal laws governing the environment have been enacted.
These include laws governing air, water, chemicals, pesticides, solid waste, and nuclear activities.
Some laws include criminal penalties for noncompliance.

11.6 Cases Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 423  Reasonable Use Doctrine Hoover v. Crane 362 Mich. 36, 106 N.W.2d 563 (1960) EDWARDS, JUSTICE This appeal represents a controversy between plaintiff cottage and resort owners on an inland Michigan lake and defendant, a farmer with a fruit orchard, who was using the lake water for irrigation.
The chancellor who heard the matter ruled that defendant had a right to reasonable use of lake water.
The decree defined such reasonable use in terms which were unsatisfactory to plaintiffs who have appealed.
The testimony taken before the chancellor pertained to the situation at Hutchins Lake, in Allegan county, during the summer of 1958.
Defendant is a fruit farmer who owns a 180-acre farm abutting on the lake.
Hutchins Lake has an area of 350 acres in a normal season.
Seventy- five cottages and several farms, including defendant’s, abut on it.
Defendant’s frontage is approximately 1/4 mile, or about 10% of the frontage of the lake.
Hutchins Lake is spring fed.
It has no inlet but does have an outlet which drains south.
Frequently in the summertime the water level falls so that the flow at the outlet ceases.
All witnesses agreed that the summer of 1958 was exceedingly dry and plaintiffs’ witnesses testified that Hutchins Lake’s level was the lowest it had ever been in their memory.
Early in August, defendant began irrigation of his 50-acre pear orchard by pumping water out of Hutchins Lake.
During that month the lake level fell 6 to 8 inches—the water line receded 50 to 60 feet and cottagers experienced severe difficulties with boating and swimming.
* * * The tenor of plaintiffs’ testimony was to attribute the 6- to 8-inch drop in the Hutchins Lake level in that summer to defendant’s irrigation activities.
Defendant contended that the decrease was due to natural causes, that the irrigation was of great benefit to him and contributed only slightly to plaintiff’s discomfiture.
He suggests to us: One could fairly say that because plaintiffs couldn’t grapple with the unknown causes that admittedly occasioned a greater part of the injury complained of, they chose to grapple mightily with the defendant because he is known and visible.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 424  The circuit judge found it impossible to determine a normal lake level from the testimony, except that the normal summer level of the lake is lower than the level at which the lake ceases to drain into the outlet.
He apparently felt that plaintiffs’ problems were due much more to the abnormal weather conditions of the summer of 1958 than to defendant’s irrigation activities.
His opinion concluded: Accepting the reasonable use theory advanced by plaintiffs it appears to the court that the most equitable disposition of this case would be to allow defendant to use water from the lake until such time when his use interferes with the normal use of his neighbors.
One quarter inch of water from the lake ought not to interfere with the rights and uses of defendant’s neighbors and this quantity of water ought to be sufficient in time of need to service 45 acres of pears.
A meter at the pump, sealed if need be, ought to be a sufficient safeguard.
Pumping should not be permitted between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. Water need be metered only at such times as there is no drainage into the outlet.
The decree in this suit may provide that the case be kept open for the submission of future petitions and proofs as the conditions permit or require.
* * * Michigan has adopted the reasonable-use rule in determining the conflicting rights of riparian owners to the use of lake water.
In 1874, Justice COOLEY said: It is therefore not a diminution in the quantity of the water alone, or an alteration in its flow, or either or both of these circumstances combined with injury, that will give a right of action, if in view of all the circumstances, and having regard to equality of right in others, that which has been done and which causes the injury is not unreasonable.
In other words, the injury that is incidental to a reasonable enjoyment of the common right can demand no redress.
Dumont v. Kellogg, 29 Mich 420, 425.
And in People v. Hulbert, the Court said: No statement can be made as to what is such reasonable use which will, without variation or qualification, apply to the facts of every case.
But in determining whether a use is reasonable we must consider what the use is for; its extent, duration, necessity, and its application; the nature Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 425  and size of the stream, and the several uses to which it is put; the extent of the injury to the one proprietor and of the benefit to the other; and all other facts which may bear upon the reasonableness of the use.
Red River Roller Millsv.
Wright, 30 Minn 249, 15 NW 167, and cases cited.
The Michigan view is in general accord with 4 Restatement, Torts, §§ 851–853.
* * * We interpret the circuit judge’s decree as affording defendant the total metered equivalent in pumpage of 1/4 inch of the content of Hutchins Lake to be used in any dry period in between the cessation of flow from the outlet and the date when such flow recommences.
Where the decree also provides for the case to be kept open for future petitions based on changed conditions, it would seem to afford as much protection for plaintiffs as to the future as this record warrants.
Both resort use and agricultural use of the lake are entirely legitimate purposes.
Neither serves to remove water from the watershed.
There is, however, no doubt that the irrigation use does occasion some water loss due to increased evaporation and absorption.
Indeed, extensive irrigation might constitute a threat to the very existence of the lake in which all riparian owners have a stake; and at some point the use of the water which causes loss must yield to the common good.
The question on this appeal is, of course, whether the chancellor’s determination of this point was unreasonable as to plaintiffs.
On this record, we cannot overrule the circuit judge’s view that most of plaintiffs’ 1958 plight was due to natural causes.
Nor can we say, if this be the only irrigation use intended and the only water diversion sought, that use of the amount provided in the decree during the dry season is unreasonable in respect to other riparian owners.
Affirmed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
If the defendant has caused a diminution in water flow, an alteration of the water flow, and the plaintiff is adversely affected, why would the Supreme Court of Michigan not provide some remedy?
2.
Is it possible to define an injury that is “not unreasonable”?
3.
Would the case even have been brought if there had not been a drought?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 426  Criminal Liability of Employees under RCRA U.S. v. Johnson & Towers, Inc., Jack W. Hopkins, and Peter Angel 741 F.2d 662 (1984) SLOVITER, Circuit Judge Before us is the government’s appeal from the dismissal of three counts of an indictment charging unlawful disposal of hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
In a question of first impression regarding the statutory definition of “person,” the district court concluded that the Act’s criminal penalty provision imposing fines and imprisonment could not apply to the individual defendants.
We will reverse.
The criminal prosecution in this case arose from the disposal of chemicals at a plant owned by Johnson & Towers in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.
In its operations the company, which repairs and overhauls large motor vehicles, uses degreasers and other industrial chemicals that contain chemicals such as methylene chloride and trichlorethylene, classified as “hazardous wastes” under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.
§§ 6901–6987 (1982) and “pollutants” under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.
§§ 1251–1376 (1982).
During the period relevant here, the waste chemicals from cleaning operations were drained into a holding tank and, when the tank was full, pumped into a trench.
The trench flowed from the plant property into Parker’s Creek, a tributary of the Delaware River.
Under RCRA, generators of such wastes must obtain a permit for disposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.).
The E.P.A.
had neither issued nor received an application for a permit for Johnson & Towers’ operations.
The indictment named as defendants Johnson & Towers and two of its employees, Jack Hopkins, a foreman, and Peter Angel, the service manager in the trucking department.
According to the indictment, over a three-day period federal agents saw workers pump waste from the tank into the trench, and on the third day observed toxic chemicals flowing into the creek.
Count 1 of the indictment charged all three defendants with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.
§ 371 (1982).
Counts 2, 3, and 4 alleged violations under the RCRA criminal provision, 42 U.S.C.
§ 6928(d) (1982).
Count 5 alleged a violation of the criminal provision of the Clean Water Act, 33 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 427  U.S.C.
§ 1319(c) (1982).
Each substantive count also charged the individual defendants as aiders and abettors under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2 (1982).
The counts under RCRA charged that the defendants “did knowingly treat, store, and dispose of, and did cause to be treated, stored and disposed of hazardous wastes without having obtained a permit…in that the defendants discharged, deposited, injected, dumped, spilled, leaked and placed degreasers…into the trench.…” The indictment alleged that both Angel and Hopkins “managed, supervised and directed a substantial portion of Johnson & Towers’ operations…including those related to the treatment, storage and disposal of the hazardous wastes and pollutants” and that the chemicals were discharged by “the defendants and others at their direction.” The indictment did not otherwise detail Hopkins’ and Angel’s activities or responsibilities.
Johnson & Towers pled guilty to the RCRA counts.
Hopkins and Angel pled not guilty, and then moved to dismiss counts 2, 3, and 4.
The court concluded that the RCRA criminal provision applies only to “owners and operators,” i.e., those obligated under the statute to obtain a permit.
Since neither Hopkins nor Angel was an “owner” or “operator,” the district court granted the motion as to the RCRA charges but held that the individuals could be liable on these three counts under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2 for aiding and abetting.
The court denied the government’s motion for reconsideration, and the government appealed to this court under 18 U.S.C.
§ 3731 (1982).
* * * The single issue in this appeal is whether the individual defendants are subject to prosecution under RCRA’s criminal provision, which applies to: any person who— .… (2) knowingly treats, stores, or disposes of any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter either— (A) without having obtained a permit under section 6925 of this title…or (B) in knowing violation of any material condition or requirement of such permit.
42 U.S.C.
§ 6928(d) (emphasis added).
The permit provision in section 6925, referred to in section 6928(d), requires “each person owning or operating a facility for the treatment, storage, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 428  or disposal of hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter to have a permit” from the E.P.A.
The parties offer contrary interpretations of section 6928(d)(2)(A).
Defendants consider it an administrative enforcement mechanism, applying only to those who come within section 6925 and fail to comply; the government reads it as penalizing anyone who handles hazardous waste without a permit or in violation of a permit.
Neither party has cited another case, nor have we found one, considering the application of this criminal provision to an individual other than an owner or operator.
As in any statutory analysis, we are obliged first to look to the language and then, if needed, attempt to divine Congress’ specific intent with respect to the issue.
First, “person” is defined in the statute as “an individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a government corporation), partnership, association, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.” 42 U.S.C.
§ 6903(15) (1982).
Had Congress meant in section 6928(d)(2)(A) to take aim more narrowly, it could have used more narrow language.
Since it did not, we attribute to “any person” the definition given the term in section 6903(15).
Second, under the plain language of the statute the only explicit basis for exoneration is the existence of a permit covering the action.
Nothing in the language of the statute suggests that we should infer another provision exonerating persons who knowingly treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste but are not owners or operators.
Finally, though the result may appear harsh, it is well established that criminal penalties attached to regulatory statutes intended to protect public health, in contrast to statutes based on common law crimes, are to be construed to effectuate the regulatory purpose.
* * * Congress enacted RCRA in 1976 as a “cradle-to-grave” regulatory scheme for toxic materials, providing “nationwide protection against the dangers of improper hazardous waste disposal.” H.R.
Rep. No.
1491, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.

& Ad.
News 6238, 6249.
RCRA was enacted to provide “a multifaceted approach toward solving the problems associated with the 3–4 billion tons of discarded materials generated each year, and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 429  the problems resulting from the anticipated 8% annual increase in the volume of such waste.” Id.
at 2, 1976 U.S. Code Cong.
& Ad.
News at 6239.
The committee reports accompanying legislative consideration of RCRA contain numerous statements evincing the Congressional view that improper disposal of toxic materials was a serious national problem.
The original statute made knowing disposal (but not treatment or storage) of such waste without a permit a misdemeanor.
Amendments in 1978 and 1980 expanded the criminal provision to cover treatment and storage and made violation of section 6928 a felony.
The fact that Congress amended the statute twice to broaden the scope of its substantive provisions and enhance the penalty is a strong indication of Congress’ increasing concern about the seriousness of the prohibited conduct.
We conclude that in RCRA, no less than in the Food and Drugs Act, Congress endeavored to control hazards that, “in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self- protection.” United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. at 280.
It would undercut the purposes of the legislation to limit the class of potential defendants to owners and operators when others also bear responsibility for handling regulated materials.
The phrase “without having obtained a permit under section 6925” (emphasis added) merely references the section under which the permit is required and exempts from prosecution under section 6928(d)(2)(A) anyone who has obtained a permit; we conclude that it has no other limiting effect.
Therefore we reject the district court’s construction limiting the substantive criminal provision by confining “any person” in section 6928(d)(2)(A) to owners and operators of facilities that store, treat or dispose of hazardous waste, as an unduly narrow view of both the statutory language and the congressional intent.

11.7 Summary and Exercises Summary An estate is an interest in real property; it is the degree to which a thing is owned.
Freehold estates are those with an uncertain duration; leaseholds are estates due to expire at a definite time.
A present estate is one that is currently owned; a future estate is one that is owned now but not yet available for use.
Present estates are (1) the fee simple absolute; (2) the fee simple defeasible, which itself may be divided into three types, and (3) the life estate.
Future estates are generally of two types: reversion and remainder.
A reversion arises whenever a transferred estate will endure for a shorter time than that originally owned by the transferor.
A remainder interest arises when the transferor gives the reversion interest to someone else.
Use of air, earth, and water are the major rights incident to ownership of real property.
Traditionally, the owner held “up to the sky” and “down to the depths,” but these rules have been modified to balance competing rights in a modern economy.
The law governing water rights varies with the states; in general, the eastern states with more plentiful water have adopted either the natural flow doctrine or the reasonable use doctrine of riparian rights, giving those who live along a waterway certain rights to use the water.
By contrast, western states have tended to apply the prior appropriation doctrine, which holds that first in time is first in right, even if those downstream are disadvantaged.
An easement is an interest in land—created by express agreement, prior use, or necessity—that permits one person to make use of another’s estate.
An affirmative easement gives one person the right to use another’s land; a negative easement prevents the owner from using his land in a way that will affect another person’s land.
In understanding easement law, the important distinctions are between easements appurtenant and in gross, and between dominant and servient owners.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 431  The law not only defines the nature of the property interest but also regulates land use.
Tort law regulates land use by imposing liability for (1) activities that affect those off the land and (2) injuries caused to people who enter it.
The two most important theories relating to the former are nuisance and trespass.
With respect to the latter, the common law confusingly distinguishes among trespassers, licensees, and invitees.
Some states are moving away from the perplexing and rigid rules of the past and simply require owners to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition.
Land use may also be regulated by private agreement through the restrictive covenant, an agreement that “runs with the land” and that will be binding on any subsequent owner.
Land use is also regulated by the government’s power under eminent domain to take private land for public purposes (upon payment of just compensation), through zoning laws, and through recently enacted environmental statutes, including the National Environmental Policy Act and laws governing air, water, treatment of hazardous wastes, and chemicals.

12.1 Forms of Ownership LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Be familiar with the various kinds of interest in real property.
2.
Know the ways that two or more people can own property together.
3.
Understand the effect of marriage, divorce, and death on various forms of property ownership.
Overview The transfer of property begins with the buyer’s selection of a form of ownership.
Our emphasis here is not on what is being acquired (the type of property interest) but on how the property is owned.
One form of ownership of real property is legally quite simple, although lawyers refer to it with a complicated-sounding name.
This is ownership by one individual, known as ownership in severalty.
In purchasing real estate, however, buyers frequently complicate matters by grouping together—because of marriage, close friendship, or simply in order to finance the purchase more easily When purchasers group together for investment purposes, they often use various forms of organization—corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures, and business trusts.
The most popular of these forms of organization for owning real estate is the limited partnership.
A real estate limited partnership is designed to allow investors to take substantial deductions that offset current income from the partnership and other similar investments, while at the same time protecting the investor from personal liability if the venture fails.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 435  But you do not have to form a limited partnership or other type of business in order to acquire property with others; many other forms are available for personal or investment purposes.
To these we now turn.
Joint Tenancy Joint tenancy is an estate in land owned by two or more persons.
It is distinguished chiefly by the right of survivorship.
If two people own land as joint tenants, then either becomes the sole owner when the other dies.
For land to be owned jointly, four unities must coexist: 1.
Unity of time.
The interests of the joint owners must begin at the same time.
2.
Unity of title.
The joint tenants must acquire their title in the same conveyance—that is, the same will or deed.
3.
Unity of interest.
Each owner must have the same interest in the property; for example, one may not hold a life estate and the other the remainder interest.
4.
Unity of possession.
All parties must have an equal right to possession of the property (see Figure 12.1 "Forms of Ownership and Unities").
Figure 12.1 Forms of Ownership and Unities Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 436  Suppose a woman owns some property and upon marriage wishes to own it jointly with her husband.
She deeds it to herself and her husband “as joint tenants and not tenants in common.” Strictly speaking, the common law would deny that the resulting form of ownership was joint because the unities of title and time were missing.
The wife owned the property first and originally acquired title under a different conveyance.
But the modern view in most states is that an owner may convey directly to herself and another in order to create a joint estate.
When one or more of the unities is destroyed, however, the joint tenancy lapses.
Fritz and Gary own a farm as joint tenants.
Fritz decides to sell his interest to Jesse (or, because Fritz has gone bankrupt, the sheriff auctions off his interest at a foreclosure sale).
Jesse and Gary would hold as tenants in common and not as joint tenants.
Suppose Fritz had made out his will, leaving his interest in the farm to Reuben.
On Fritz’s death, would the unities be destroyed, leaving Gary and Reuben as tenants in common?
No, because Gary, as joint tenant, would own the entire farm on Fritz’s death, leaving nothing behind for Reuben to inherit.
Tenancy by the Entirety About half the states permit husbands and wives to hold property astenants by the entirety.
This form of ownership is similar to joint tenancy, except that it is restricted to husbands and wives.
This is sometimes described as the unity of person.
In most of the states permitting tenancy by the entirety, acquisition by husband and wife of property as joint tenants automatically becomes a tenancy by the entirety.
The fundamental importance of tenancy by the entirety is that neither spouse individually can terminate it; only a joint decision to do so will be effective.
One spouse alone cannot sell or lease an interest in such property without consent of the other, and in many states a creditor of one spouse cannot seize the individual’s separate interest in the property, because the interest is indivisible.
Tenancy in Common Two or more people can hold property as tenants in common when the unity of possession is present, that is, when each is entitled to occupy the property.
None of the other unities—of time, title, or interest—is necessary, though their existence does not impair the common ownership.
Note that the tenants in common do not own a specific portion of the real estate; each has an Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 437  undivided share in the whole, and each is entitled to occupy the whole estate.
One tenant in common may sell, lease, or mortgage his undivided interest.
When a tenant in common dies, his interest in the property passes to his heirs, not to the surviving tenants in common.
Because tenancy in common does not require a unity of interest, it has become a popular form of “mingling,” by which unrelated people pool their resources to purchase a home.
If they were joint tenants, each would be entitled to an equal share in the home, regardless of how much each contributed, and the survivor would become sole owner when the other owner dies.
But with a tenancy-in-common arrangement, each can own a share in proportion to the amount invested.
Community Property In ten states—Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin—property acquired during a marriage is said to becommunity property.
There are differences among these states, but the general theory is that with certain exceptions, each spouse has an undivided equal interest in property acquired while the husband and wife are married to each other.
The major exception is for property acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage.
(By definition, property owned by either spouse before the marriage is not community property.)
Property acquired by gift of inheritance or owned before the marriage is known as separate property.
Community property states recognize other forms of ownership; specifically, husbands and wives may hold property as joint tenants, permitting the survivor to own the whole.
The consequence of community property laws is that either the husband or the wife may manage the community property, borrow against it, and dispose of community personal property.
Community real estate may only be sold or encumbered by both jointly.
Each spouse may bequeath only half the community property in his or her will.
In the absence of a will, the one- half property interest will pass in accordance with the laws of intestate succession.
If the couple divorces, the states generally provide for an equal or near-equal division of the community property, although a few permit the court in its discretion to divide in a different proportion.
Condominiums In popular parlance, a condominium is a kind of apartment building, but that is not its technical legal meaning.
Condominium is a form of ownership, not a form of structure, and it can even Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 438  apply to space—for example, to parking spaces in a garage.
The wordcondominium means joint ownership or control, and it has long been used whenever land has been particularly scarce or expensive.
Condominiums were popular in ancient Rome (especially near the Forum) and in the walled cities of medieval Europe.
In its modern usage, condominium refers to a form of housing involving two elements of ownership.
The first is the living space itself, which may be held in common, in joint tenancy, or in any other form of ownership.
The second is the common space in the building, including the roof, land under the structure, hallways, swimming pool, and the like.
The common space is held by all purchasers as tenants in common.
The living space may not be sold apart from the interest in the common space.
Two documents are necessary in a condominium sale—the master deed and the bylaws.
The master deed (1) describes the condominium units, the common areas, and any restrictions that apply to them; (2) establishes the unit owner’s interest in the common area, his number of votes at owners’ association meetings, and his share of maintenance and operating expenses (sometimes unit owners have equal shares, and sometimes their share is determined by computing the ratio of living area or market price or original price of a single unit to the whole); and (3) creates a board of directors to administer the affairs of the whole condominium.
The bylaws usually establish the owners’ association, set out voting procedures, list the powers and duties of the officers, and state the obligations of the owners for the use of the units and the common areas.
Cooperatives Another popular form of owning living quarters with common areas is the cooperative.
Unlike the person who lives in a condominium, the tenant of a cooperative does not own a particular unit.
Instead, he owns a share of the entire building.
Since the building is usually owned by a corporation (a cooperative corporation, hence the name), this means that the tenant owns stock in the corporation.
A tenant occupies a unit under a lease from the corporation.
Together, the lease and stock in the building corporation are considered personal, not real, property.
In a condominium, an owner of a unit who defaults in paying monthly mortgage bills can face foreclosure on the unit, but neighbors in the building suffer no direct financial impact, except Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 439  that the defaulter probably has not paid monthly maintenance charges either.
In a cooperative, however, a tenant who fails to pay monthly charges can jeopardize the entire building, because the mortgage is on the building as a whole; consequently, the others will be required to make good the payments or face foreclosure.
Time-Shares A time-share is an arrangement by which several people can own the same property while being entitled to occupy the premises exclusively at different times on a recurring basis.
In the typical vacation property, each owner has the exclusive right to use the apartment unit or cottage for a specified period of time each year—for example, Mr. and Mrs. Smith may have possession from December 15 through December 22, Mr. and Mrs. Jones from December 23 through December 30, and so on.
The property is usually owned as a condominium but need not be.
The sharers may own the property in fee simple, hold a joint lease, or even belong to a vacation club that sells time in the unit.
Time-share resorts have become popular in recent years.
But the lure of big money has brought unscrupulous contractors and salespersons into the market.
Sales practices can be unusually coercive, and as a result, most states have sets of laws specifically to regulate time-share sales.
Almost all states provide a cooling-off period, or rescission period; these periods vary from state to state and provide a window where buyers can change their minds without forfeiting payments or deposits already made.
KEY TAKEAWAY Property is sometimes owned by one person or one entity, but more often two or more persons will share in the ownership.
Various forms of joint ownership are possible, including joint tenancies, tenancy by the entirety, and tenancy in common.
Married persons should be aware of whether the state they live in is a community property state; if it is, the spouse will take some interest in any property acquired during the marriage.
Beyond traditional landholdings, modern real estate ownership may include interests in condominiums, cooperatives, or time-shares.

12.2 Brokers, Contracts, Proof of Title, and Closing LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Know the duties of the real estate broker and how brokers are licensed.
2.
Be able to discuss the impact of constitutonal and statutory law on real estate sellers and brokers.
3.
Describe the various kinds of listing contracts and their import.
4.
Know the elements of a sales agreement and the various types of deeds to real estate.
5.
Understand the closing process and how “good title” is obtained through the title search and insurance process.
Once the buyer (or buyers) knows what form of ownership is most desirable, the search for a suitable property can begin.
This search often involves contact with a broker hired by the seller.
The seller’s contract with the broker, known as the listing agreement, is the first of the series of contracts in a typical real estate transaction.
As you consider these contracts, it is important to keep in mind that despite the size of the transaction and the dire financial consequences should anything go awry, the typical person (buyer or seller) usually acts as his or her own attorney.
An American Bar Association committee has noted the following: It is probably safe to say that in a high percentage of cases the seller is unrepresented and signs the contracts of brokerage and sale on the basis of his faith in the broker.
The buyer does not employ a lawyer.
He signs the contract of sale without reading it and, once financing has been obtained, leaves all the details of title search and closing to the lender or broker.
The lender or broker may employ an attorney but, where title insurance is furnished by a company maintaining its own title plant, it is possible that no lawyer, not even house counsel, will appear.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 441  This being so, the material that follows is especially important for buyers and sellers who are not represented in the process of buying or selling real estate.
Regulation of the Real Estate Business State Licensing Real estate brokers, and the search for real estate generally, are subject to state and federal government regulation.
Every state requires real estate brokers to be licensed.
To obtain a license, the broker must pass an examination covering the principles of real estate practice, transactions, and instruments.
Many states additionally insist that the broker take several courses in finance, appraisal, law, and real estate practice and apprentice for two years as a salesperson in a real estate broker’s office.
Civil Rights Act Two federal civil rights laws also play an important role in the modern real estate transaction.
These are the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act).
In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., [1] the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1866 law, which expressly gives all citizens of the United States the same rights to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.
A minority buyer or renter who is discriminated against may sue for relief in federal court, which may award damages, stop the sale of the house, or even direct the seller to convey the property to the plaintiff.
The 1968 Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or family status (i.e., no discrimination against families with children) by any one of several means, including the following: 1.
Refusing to sell or rent to or negotiate with any person 2.
Discriminating in the terms of sale or renting 3.
Discriminating in advertising 4.
Denying that the housing is available when in fact it is 5.
“Blockbusting” (panicking owners into selling or renting by telling them that minority groups are moving into the neighborhood) 6.
Creating different terms for granting or denying home loans by commercial lenders 7.
Denying anyone the use of real estate services Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 442  However, the 1968 act contains several exemptions: 1.
Sale or rental of a single-family house if the seller a. owns less than four such houses, b. does not use a broker, c. does not use discriminatory advertising, d. within two years sells no more than one house in which the seller was not the most recent occupant.
e. Rentals in a building occupied by the owner as long as it houses fewer than five families and the owner did not use discriminatory advertising f. Sale or rental of space in buildings or land restricted by religious organization owners to people of the same religion (assuming that the religion does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin) g. Private clubs, if they limit their noncommercial rentals to members The net impact of these laws is that discrimination based on color or race is flatly prohibited and that other types of discrimination are also barred unless one of the enumerated exemptions applies.
Hiring the Broker: The Listing Agreement When the seller hires a real estate broker, he will sign a listing agreement.
(In several states, the Statute of Frauds says that the seller must sign a written agreement; however, he should do so in all states in order to provide evidence in the event of a later dispute.)
This listing agreement sets forth the broker’s commission, her duties, the length of time she will serve as broker, and other terms of her agency relationship.
Whether the seller will owe a commission if he or someone other than the broker finds a buyer depends on which of three types of listing agreements has been signed.
Exclusive Right to Sell If the seller agrees to an exclusive-right-to-sell agency, he will owe the broker the stated commission regardless of who finds the buyer.
Language such as the following gives the broker an exclusive right to sell: “Should the seller or anyone acting for the seller (including his heirs) sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the property within the time fixed for the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 443  continuance of the agency, the broker shall be entitled nevertheless to the commission as set out herein.” Exclusive Agency Somewhat less onerous from the seller’s perspective (and less generous from the broker’s perspective) is the exclusive agency.
The broker has the exclusive right to sell and will be entitled to the commission if anyone other than the seller finds the buyer (i.e., the seller will owe no commission if he finds a buyer).
Here is language that creates an exclusive agency: “A commission is to be paid the broker whether the purchaser is secured by the broker or by any person other than the seller.” Open Listing The third type of listing, relatively rarely used, is the open listing, which authorizes “the broker to act as agent in securing a purchaser for my property.” The open listing calls for payment to the broker only if the broker was instrumental in finding the buyer; the broker is not entitled to her commission if anyone else, seller or otherwise, locates the buyer.
Suppose the broker finds a buyer, but the seller refuses at that point to sell.
May the seller simply change his mind and avoid having to pay the broker’s commission?
The usual rule is that when a broker finds a buyer who is “ready, willing, and able” to purchase or lease the property, she has earned her commission.
Many courts have interpreted this to mean that even if the buyers are unable to obtain financing, the commission is owed nevertheless once the prospective buyers have signed a purchase agreement.
To avoid this result, the seller should insist on either a “no deal, no commission” clause in the listing agreement (entitling the broker to payment only if the sale is actually consummated) or a clause in the purchase agreement making the purchase itself contingent on the buyer’s finding financing.
Broker’s Duties Once the listing agreement has been signed, the broker becomes the seller’s agent—or, as occasionally happens, the buyer’s agent, if hired by the buyer.
A broker is not a general agent with broad authority.
Rather, a broker is a special agent with authority only to show the property to potential buyers.
Unless expressly authorized, a broker may not accept money on behalf of the seller from a prospective buyer.
Suppose Eunice hires Pete’s Realty to sell her house.
They sign a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 444  standard exclusive agency listing, and Pete cajoles Frank into buying the house.
Frank writes out a check for $10,000 as a down payment and offers it to Pete, who absconds with the money.
Who must bear the loss?
Ordinarily, Frank would have to bear the loss, because Pete was given no authority to accept money.
If the listing agreement explicitly said that Pete could accept the down payment from a buyer, then the loss would fall on Eunice.
Although the broker is but a special agent, she owes the seller, her principal, afiduciary duty.
A fiduciary duty is a duty of the highest loyalty and trust.
It means that the broker cannot buy the property for herself through an intermediary without full disclosure to the seller of her intentions.
Nor may the broker secretly receive a commission from the buyer or suggest to a prospective buyer that the property can be purchased for less than the asking price.
The Sales Agreement Once the buyer has selected the real estate to be acquired, an agreement of sale will be negotiated and signed.
Contract law in general is discussed in Chapter 8 "Contracts"; our discussion here will focus on specific aspects of the real estate contract.
The Statute of Frauds requires that contracts for sale of real estate must be in writing.
The writing must contain certain information.
Names of Buyers and Sellers The agreement must contain the names of the buyers and sellers.
As long as the parties sign the agreement, however, it is not necessary for the names of buyers and sellers to be included within the body of the agreement.
Real Estate Description The property must be described sufficiently for a court to identify the property without having to look for evidence outside the agreement.
The proper address, including street, city, and state, is usually sufficient.
Price The price terms must be clear enough for a court to enforce.
A specific cash price is always clear enough.
But a problem can arise when installment payments are to be made.
To say “$50,000, payable monthly for fifteen years at 12 percent” is not sufficiently detailed, because it is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 445  impossible to determine whether the installments are to be equal each month or are to be equal principal payments with varying interest payments, declining monthly as the balance decreases.
Signature As a matter of prudence, both buyer and seller should sign the purchase agreement.
However, the Statute of Frauds requires only the signature of the party against whom the agreement is to be enforced.
So if the seller has signed the agreement, he cannot avoid the agreement on the grounds that the buyer has not signed it.
However, if the buyer, not having signed, refuses to go to closing and take title, the seller would be unable to enforce the agreement against him.
Easements and Restrictive Covenants Unless the contract specifically states otherwise, the seller must delivermarketable title.
A marketable title is one that is clear of restrictions to which a reasonable buyer would object.
Most buyers would refuse to close the deal if there were potential third-party claims to all or part of the title.
But a buyer would be unreasonable if, at closing, he refused to consummate the transaction on the basis that there were utility easements for the power company or a known and visible driveway easement that served the neighboring property.
As a precaution, a seller must be sure to say in the contract for sale that the property is being sold “subject to easements and restrictions of record.” A buyer who sees only such language should insist that the particular easements and restrictive covenants be spelled out in the agreement before he signs.
Risk of Loss Suppose the house burns down after the contract is signed but before the closing.
Who bears the loss?
Once the contract is signed, most states apply the rule of equitable conversion, under which the buyer’s interest (his executory right to enforce the contract to take title to the property) is regarded as real property, and the seller’s interest is regarded as personal property.
The rule of equitable conversion stems from an old maxim of the equity courts: “That which ought to be done is regarded as done.” That is, the buyer ought to have the property and the seller ought to have the money.
A practical consequence of this rule is that the loss of the property falls on the buyer.
Because most buyers do not purchase insurance until they take title, eleven states have adopted the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act, which reverses the equitable conversion rule and places risk of loss on the seller.
The parties may themselves Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 446  reverse the application of the rule; the buyer should always insist on a clause in a contract stating that risk of loss remains with the seller until a specified date, such as the closing.
Earnest Money As protection against the buyer’s default, the seller usually insists on a down payment known as earnest money.
This is intended to cover such immediate expenses as proof of marketable title and the broker’s commission.
If the buyer defaults, he forfeits the earnest money, even if the contract does not explicitly say so.
Contingencies Performance of most real estate contracts is subject to various contingencies—that is, it is conditioned on the happening of certain events.
For example, the buyer might wish to condition his agreement to buy the house on his ability to find a mortgage or to find one at a certain rate of interest.
Thus the contract for sale might read that the buyer “agrees to buy the premises for $50,000, subject to his obtaining a $40,000 mortgage at 5 percent.” The person protected by the contingency may waive it; if the lowest interest rate the buyer could find was 5.5 percent, he could either refuse to buy the house or waive the condition and buy it anyway.
Times for Performance A frequent difficulty in contracting to purchase real estate is the length of time it takes to receive an acceptance to an offer.
If the acceptance is not received in a reasonable time, the offeror may treat the offer as rejected.
To avoid the uncertainty, an offeror should always state in his offer that it will be held open for a definite period of time (five working days, two weeks, or whatever).
The contract also ought to spell out the times by which the following should be done: (1) seller’s proof that he has title, (2) buyer’s review of the evidence of title, (3) seller’s correction of title defects, (4) closing date, and (5) possession by the buyer.
The absence of explicit time provisions will not render the contract unenforceable—the courts will infer a reasonable time—but their absence creates the possibility of unnecessary disputes.
Types of Deeds Most real estate transactions involve two kinds of deeds, the general warranty deed and the quitclaim deed.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 447  1.
General warranty deed.
In a warranty deed, the seller warrants to the buyer that he possesses certain types of legal rights in the property.
In thegeneral warranty deed, the seller warrants that (a) he has good title to convey, (b) the property is free from any encumbrance not stated in the deed (the warranty against encumbrances), and (c) the property will not be taken by someone with a better title (the warranty of quiet enjoyment).
Breach of any of these warranties exposes the seller to damages.
2.
Quitclaim deed.
The simplest form of deed is the quitclaim deed, in which the seller makes no warranties.
Instead, he simply transfers to the buyer whatever title he had, defects and all.
A quitclaim deed should not be used in the ordinary purchase and sale transaction.
It is usually reserved for removing a cloud on the title—for instance, a quitclaim deed by a widow who might have a dower interest in the property.
If the purchase agreement is silent about the type of deed, courts in many states will require the seller to give the buyer a quitclaim deed.
In the contract, the buyer should therefore specify that the seller is to provide a warranty deed at closing.
When buyers move in after the closing, they frequently discover defects (the boiler is broken, a pipe leaks, the electrical power is inadequate).
To obtain recourse against such an eventuality, the buyer could attempt to negotiate a clause in the contract under which the seller gives a warranty covering named defects.
However, even without an express warranty, the law implies two warranties when a buyer purchases a new house from a builder.
These are warranties that (1) the house is habitable and (2) the builder has completed the house in a workmanlike manner.
Most states have refused to extend these warranties to subsequent purchasers—for example, to the buyer from a seller who had bought from the original builder.
However, a few states have begun to provide limited protection to subsequent purchasers—in particular, for defects that a reasonable inspection will not reveal but that will show up only after purchase.
Proof of Title Contracts are often formed and performed simultaneously, but in real estate transactions there is more often a gap between contract formation and performance (the closing).
The reason is simple: the buyer must have time to obtain financing and to determine whether the seller has marketable title.
That is not always easy; at least, it is not as straightforward as looking at a piece Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 448  of paper.
To understand how title relates to the real estate transaction, some background on recording statutes will be useful.
Recording Statutes Suppose Slippery Sam owned Whispering Pines, a choice resort hotel on Torch Lake.
On October 1, Slippery deeded Whispering Pines to Lorna for $1,575,000.
Realizing the profit potential, Slippery decided to sell it again, and did so on November 1, without bothering to tell Malvina, the new buyer to whom he gave a new deed, that he had already sold it to Lorna.
He then departed for a long sailing trip to the British Virgin Islands.
When Malvina arrives on the doorstep to find Lorna already tidying up, who should prevail?
At common law, the first deed prevailed over subsequent deeds.
So in our simple example, if this were a pure common-law state, Lorna would have title and Malvina would be out of luck, stuck with a worthless piece of paper.
Her only recourse, probably futile, would be to search out and sue Slippery Sam for fraud.
Most states, however, have enacted recording statutes, which award title to the person who has complied with the requirement to place the deed in a publicly available file in a public office in the county, often called the recorder’s office or the register of deeds.
Notice Statute Under the most common type of recording statute, called a notice statute, a deed must be recorded in order for the owner to prevail against a subsequent purchaser.
Assume in our example that Lorna recorded her deed on November 2 and that Malvina recorded on November 4.
In a notice-statute state, Malvina’s claim to title would prevail over Lorna’s because on the day that Malvina received title (November 1), Lorna had not yet recorded.
For this rule to apply, Malvina must have been a bona fide purchaser, meaning that she must have (1) paid valuable consideration, (2) bought in good faith, and (3) had no notice of the earlier sale.
If Lorna had recorded before Malvina took the deed, Lorna would prevail if Malvina did not in fact check the public records; she should have checked, and the recorded deed is said to put subsequent purchasers onconstructive notice.
Notice-Race Statute Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 449  Another common type of recording statute is the notice-race statute.
To gain priority under this statute, the subsequent bona fide purchaser must also record—that is, win the race to the recorder’s office before the earlier purchaser.
So in our example, in a notice-race jurisdiction, Lorna would prevail, since she recorded before Malvina did.
Race Statute A third, more uncommon type is the race statute, which gives title to whoever records first, even if the subsequent purchaser is not bona fide and has actual knowledge of the prior sale.
Suppose that when she received the deed, Malvina knew of the earlier sale to Lorna.
Malvina got to the recording office the day she got the deed, November 1, and Lorna came in the following day.
In a race-statute jurisdiction, Malvina would take title.
Chain of Title Given the recording statutes, the buyer must check the deed on record to determine (1) whether the seller ever acquired a valid deed to the property—that is, whether a chain of title can be traced from earlier owners to the seller—and (2) whether the seller has already sold the property to another purchaser, who has recorded a deed.
There are any number of potential “clouds” on the title that would defeat a fee simple conveyance: among others, there are potential judgments, liens, mortgages, and easements that might affect the value of the property.
There are two ways to protect the buyer: the abstract of title and opinion, and title insurance.
Abstract and Opinion An abstract of title is a summary of the chain of title, listing all previous deeds, mortgages, tax liens, and other instruments recorded in the county land records office.
The abstract is prepared by either an attorney or a title company.
Since the list itself says nothing about whether the recorded instruments are legally valid, the buyer must also have the opinion of an attorney reviewing the abstract, or must determine by doing his own search of the public records, that the seller has valid title.
The attorney’s opinion is known as a title opinion or certificate of title.
The problem with this method of proving title is that the public records do not reveal hidden defects.
One of the previous owners might have been a minor or an incompetent person who can still void his sale, or a previous deed might have been forged, or a previous seller might have claimed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 450  to be single when in fact he was married and his wife failed to sign away her dower rights.
A search of the records would not detect these infirmities.
Title Insurance To overcome these difficulties, the buyer should obtain title insurance.
This is a one-premium policy issued by a title insurance company after a search through the same public records.
When the title company is satisfied that title is valid, it will issue the insurance policy for a premium that could be as high as 1 percent of the selling price.
When the buyer is taking out a mortgage, he will ordinarily purchase two policies, one to cover his investment in the property and the other to cover the mortgagee lender’s loan.
In general, a title policy protects the buyer against losses that would occur if title (1) turns out to belong to someone else; (2) is subject to a lien, encumbrance, or other defect; or (3) does not give the owner access to the land.
A preferred type of title policy will also insure the buyer against losses resulting from an unmarketable title.
Note that in determining whether to issue a policy, the title company goes through the process of searching through the public records again.
The title policy as such does not guarantee that title is sound.
A buyer could conceivably lose part or all of the property someday to a previous rightful owner, but if he does, the title insurance company must reimburse him for his losses.
Although title insurance is usually a sound protection, most policies are subject to various exclusions and exceptions.
For example, they do not provide coverage for zoning laws that restrict use of the property or for a government’s taking of the property under its power of eminent domain.
Nor do the policies insure against defects created by the insured or known by the insured but unknown to the company.
Some companies will not provide coverage for mechanics’ liens, public utility easements, and unpaid taxes.
(If the accrued taxes are known, the insured will be presented with a list, and if he pays them on or before the closing, they will be covered by the final policy.)
Furthermore, as demonstrated in Title and Trust Co. of Florida v. Barrows, (seeSection 12.4.1 "Title Insurance"), title insurance covers title defects only, not physical defects in the property.
The Closing Closing can be a confusing process because in most instances several contracts are being performed simultaneously: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 451  1.
The seller and purchaser are performing the sales contract.
2.
The seller is paying off a mortgage, while the buyer is completing arrangements to borrow money and mortgage the property.
3.
Title and other insurance arrangements will be completed.
4.
The seller will pay the broker.
5.
If buyer and seller are represented, attorneys for each party will be paid.
Figure 12.2 Closing Process Despite all these transactions, the critical players are the seller, the purchaser, and the bank.
To place the closing process in perspective, assume that one bank holds the existing (seller’s) mortgage on the property and is also financing the buyer’s purchase.
We can visualize the three main players sitting at a table, ready to close the transaction.
The key documents and the money will flow as illustrated in Figure 12.2 "Closing Process".
Form of the Deed The deed must satisfy two fundamental legal requirements: it must be in the proper form, and there must be a valid delivery.
Deeds are usually prepared by attorneys, who must include not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 452  only information necessary for a valid deed but also information required in order to be able to record the deed.
The following information is typically required either for a valid deed or by the recording statutes.
Grantor The grantor—the person who is conveying the property—must be designated in some manner.
Obviously, it is best to give the grantor’s full name, but it is sufficient that the person or persons conveying the deed are identifiable from the document.
Thus “the heirs of Lockewood Filmer” is sufficient identification if each of the heirs signs the deed.
Grantee Similarly, the deed should identify the grantee—the person to whom the property is being conveyed.
It does not void the deed to misspell a person’s name or to omit part of a name, or even to omit the name of one of the grantees (as in “Lockewood Filmer and wife”).
Although not technically necessary, the deed ought to detail the interests being conveyed to each grantee in order to avoid considerable legal difficulty later.
“To Francis Lucas, a single man, and Joseph Lucas and Matilda Lucas, his wife” was a deed of unusual ambiguity.
Did each party have a one- third interest?
Or did Joseph and Matilda hold half as tenants by the entirety and Francis have a one-half interest as a tenant in common?
Or perhaps Francis had a one-third interest as a tenant in common and Joseph and Matilda held two-thirds as tenants by the entirety?
Or was there some other possible combination?
The court chose the second interpretation, but considerable time and money could have been saved had the deed contained a few simple words of explanation.
[2] Addresses Addresses of the parties should be included, although their absence will not usually invalidate the deed.
However, in some states, failure to note the addresses will bar the deed from being recorded.
Words of Conveyance The deed must indicate that the grantor presently intends to convey his interest in the property to the grantee.
The deed may recite that the grantor “conveys and warrants” the property Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 453  (warranty deed) or “conveys and quitclaims” the property (quitclaim deed).
Some deeds use the words “bargain and sell” in place of convey.
Description The deed must contain an accurate description of the land being conveyed, a description clear enough that the land can be identified without resorting to other evidence.
Four general methods are used.
1.
The US government survey.
This is available west of the Mississippi (except in Texas) and in Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
With this survey, it is possible to specify with considerable exactitude any particular plot of land in any township in these states.
2.
Metes and bounds.
The description of metes and bounds begins with a particular designated point (called a monument)—for example, a drainpipe, an old oak tree, a persimmon stump—and then defines the boundary with distances and angles until returning to the monument.
As you can tell, using monuments that are biological (like trees and stumps) will have a limited utility as time goes on.
Most surveyors put in stakes (iron pins), and the metes and bounds description will go from points where stakes have been put in the ground.
3.
Plats.
Many land areas have been divided into numbered lots and placed on a map called a plat.
The plats are recorded.
The deed, then, need only refer to the plat and lot number—for example, “Lot 17, Appledale Subdivision, record in Liber 2 of Plats, page 62, Choctaw County Records.” 4.
Informal description.
If none of the preceding methods can be used, an informal description, done precisely enough, might suffice.
For instance, “my home at 31 Fernwood Street, Maplewood, Idaho” would probably pass muster.
Statement of Consideration Statutes usually require that some consideration be stated in the deed, even though a grantor may convey property as a gift.
When there is a selling price, it is easy enough to state it, although the actual price need not be listed.
When land is being transferred as a gift, a statement of nominal consideration—for example, one dollar—is sufficient.
Date Dates are customary, but deeds without dates will be enforced.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 454  Execution The deed must be signed by the grantor and, in some states, witnesses, and these signatures must be acknowledged by a notary public in order to make the deed eligible for recording.
If someone is signing for the grantor under a power of attorney, a written instrument authorizing one person to sign for another, the instrument must be recorded along with the deed.
Delivery To validly convey title to the property, the deed must not only be in proper form but also be delivered.
This technical legal requirement is sometimes misunderstood.
Deliveryentails (1) physical delivery to the grantee, (2) an intention by the grantor to convey title, and (3) acceptance of title by the grantee.
Because the grantor must intend to convey title, failure to meet the other two elements during the grantor’s lifetime will void title on his death (since at that point he of course cannot have an intention).
Thus when a grantee is unaware of the grantor’s intention to deed the property to him, an executed deed sitting in a safe-deposit box will be invalid if discovered after the grantor’s death.
Delivery to Grantee If the deed is physically delivered to the grantee or recorded, there is a rebuttable presumption that legal delivery has been made.
That is, the law presumes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that all three conditions have been met if delivery or recording takes place.
But this presumption can be rebutted, as shown in Havens v. Schoen, (see Section 12.4.2 "Delivery of a Deed").
Delivery to Third Party (Commercial Escrow) The grantor may deliver the deed to a third party to hold until certain conditions have been met.
Thus to avoid the problem of the deed sitting in the grantor’s own safe-deposit box, he could deliver it to a third party with instructions to hold it until his death and then to deliver it to the grantee.
This would be an effective delivery, even though the grantee could not use the property until the grantor died.
For this method to be effective, the grantor must lose all control over the deed, and the third party must be instructed to deliver the deed when the specified conditions occur.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 455  This method is most frequently used in the commercial escrow.
Escrow is a method by which a third party holds a document or money or both until specified conditions have been met.
A typical example would be a sale in which the buyer is afraid of liens that might be filed after the closing.
A contractor that has supplied materials for the building of a house, for example, might file a lien against the property for any amounts due but unpaid under the contract.
The effectiveness of the lien would relate back to the time that the materials were furnished.
Thus, at closing, all potential liens might not have been filed.
The buyer would prefer to pay the seller after the time for filing materialmen’s liens has lapsed.
But sellers ordinarily want to ensure that they will receive their money before delivering a deed.
The solution is for the buyer to pay the money into escrow (e.g., to a bank) and for the seller to deliver the deed to the same escrow agent.
The bank would be instructed to hold both the money and the deed until the time for filing mechanics’ liens has ended.
If no materialmen’s liens have been filed, then the money is paid out of escrow to the seller and the deed is released to the buyer.
If a lien has been filed, then the money will not be paid until the seller removes the lien (usually by paying it off).
KEY TAKEAWAY Most real estate is bought and sold through real estate brokers, who must be licensed by the state.
Brokers have different kinds of agreements with clients, including exclusive right to sell, exclusive agency, and open listing.
Brokers will usually arrange a sales agreement that includes standard provisions such as property description, earnest money, and various contingencies.
A deed, usually a warranty deed, will be exchanged at the closing, but not before the buyer has obtained good proof of title, usually by getting an abstract and opinion and paying for title insurance.
The deed will typically be delivered to the buyer and recorded at the county courthouse in the register of deeds’ office.
EXERCISES 1.
Kitty Korniotis is a licensed real estate broker.
Barney Woodard and his wife, Carol, sign an exclusive agency listing with Kitty to sell their house on Woodvale Avenue.
At a social gathering, Carol mentions to a friend, Helen Nearing, that the house on Woodvale is for sale.
The next day, Helen drives by the property and calls the number on Kitty’s sign.
Helen and Scott Nearing sign a contract to buy the house from the Woodards.
Is Kitty entitled to the commission?

Deepak Abhishek, a single man, lives in a race-notice state.
He contracts to buy a large parcel of land from his friend, Ron Khurana, for the sum of $280,000.
Subsequent to the contract, Khurana finds another buyer, who is willing to pay $299,000.
Khurana arranges for two closings on the same day, within two hours of each other.
At 10 a.m., he sells the property to Beverly Hanks and her husband, John, for $299,000.
The Hanks are not represented by an attorney.
Khurana hands them the deed at closing, but he takes it back from them and says, “I will record this at the courthouse this afternoon.” The Hankses take a copy of the deed with them and are satisfied that they have bought the property; moreover, Khurana gives them a commitment from Lawyer’s Title Company that the company will insure that they are receiving fee simple title from Khurana, subject to the deed’s being recorded in the county register of deeds’ office.
At noon, Khurana has a closing with Abhishek, who is represented by an attorney.
The attorney went to the courthouse earlier, at 11:30 a.m., and saw nothing on record that would prevent Khurana from conveying fee simple title.
As the deal closes, and as Khurana prepares to leave town, Abhishek’s attorney goes to the courthouse and records the deed at 1:15 p.m. At 2:07 p.m., on his way out of town, Abhishek records the deed to the Hankses.
a.
Who has better claim to the property—the Hankses or Deepak Abhishek?
b.
Does it matter if the state is a notice jurisdiction or a notice-race jurisdiction?
c. A warranty deed is given in both closings.
What would be the best remedy for whichever buyer did not get the benefit of clear title from these two transactions?

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 457  12.3 Adverse Possession LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Explain how it is possible to own land without paying for it.
In some instances, real property can be acquired for free—or at least without paying the original owner anything.
(Considerable cost may be involved in meeting the requisite conditions.)
This method of acquisition—known as adverse possession—is effective when five conditions are met: (1) the person claiming title by adverse possession must assert that he has a right to possession hostile to the interest of the original owner, (2) he must actually possess the property, (3) his possession must be “open and notorious,” (4) the possession must be continuous, and (5) the possession must be exclusive.
Hostile Possession Suppose Jean and Jacques are tenants in common of a farm.
Jean announces that he no longer intends to pursue agricultural habits and leaves for the city.
Jacques continues to work on the land, making improvements and paying taxes and the mortgage.
Years later, Jacques files suit for title, claiming that he now owns the land outright by adverse possession.
He would lose, since his possession was not hostile to Jacques.
To be hostile, possession of the land must be without permission and with the intention to claim ownership.
Possession by one cotenant is deemed permissive, since either or both are legally entitled to possession.
Suppose, instead, that Jean and Jacques are neighboring farmers, each with title to his own acreage, and that Jean decides to fence in his property.
Just to be on the safe side, he knowingly constructs the fence twenty feet over on Jacques’s side.
This is adverse possession, since it is clearly hostile to Jacques’s possession of the land.
Actual Possession Not only must the possession be hostile but it must also be actual.
The possessor must enter onto the land and make some use of it.
Many state statutes define the permissible type of possession—for example, substantial enclosure or cultivation and improvement.
In other states, the courts will look to the circumstances of each case to determine whether the claimant had in fact possessed the land (e.g., by grazing cattle on the land each summer).
Open and Notorious Possession Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 458  The possessor must use the land in an open way, so that the original owner could determine by looking that his land was being claimed and so that people in the area would know that it was being used by the adverse possessor.
In the melodramatic words of one court, the adverse possessor “must unfurl his flag on the land, and keep it flying so that the owner may see, if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains, and planted the standard of conquest.” [1] Construction of a building on the owner’s property would be open and notorious; development of a cave or tunnel under the owner’s property would not be.
Continuous Possession The adverse possessor must use the land continuously, not intermittently.
In most states, this continuous period must last for at least twenty years.
If the adverse possession is passed on to heirs or the interest is sold, the successor adverse possessors may tack on the time they claim possession to reach the twenty years.
Should the original owner sell his land, the time needed to prove continuous possession will not lapse.
Of course, the original owner may interrupt the period—indeed, may terminate it—by moving to eject the adverse possessor any time before the twenty years has elapsed.
Exclusive Possession The adverse possessor must claim exclusive possession of the land.
Sharing the land with the owner is insufficient to ground a claim of legal entitlement based on adverse possession, since the sharing is not fully adverse or hostile.
Jean finds a nice wooded lot to enjoy weekly picnics.
The lot belongs to Jacques, who also uses it for picnics.
This use would be insufficient to claim adverse possession because it is neither continuous nor exclusive.
If the five tests are met, then the adverse possessor is entitled to legal title.
If any one of the tests is missing, the adverse possession claim will fail.
KEY TAKEAWAY Real property can be acquired without paying the lawful owner if five conditions of adverse possession are met: (1) the person claiming title by adverse possession must assert that he has a right to possession hostile to the interest of the original owner, (2) he must actually possess the property, (3) his possession must be “open and notorious,” (4) the possession must be continuous, and (5) the possession must be exclusive.
EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 459  1.
Tyler decides to camp out on a sandy beach lot near Isle of Palms, South Carolina.
The owner, who had hoped to build a large house there, lived out of state.
Tyler made no secret of his comings and goings, and after several weeks, when no one challenged his right to be there, he built a sturdy lean-to.
After a while, he built a “micro house” and put a propane tank next to it.
Although there was no running water, Tyler was plenty comfortable.
His friends came often, they partied on the beach, and life was good.
Five years after he first started camping out there, an agent of the owner came and told him to deconstruct his shelter and “move on.” Does Tyler have any rights in the property?
Why or why not?

12.4 Cases Title Insurance Title and Trust Co. of Florida v. Barrows 381 So.2d 1088 (Fla. App.
1979) McCORD, ACTING CHIEF JUDGE.
This appeal is from a final judgment awarding money damages to appellees (Barrows) for breach of title insurance policy.
We reverse.
Through a realtor, the Barrowses purchased, for $ 12,500, a lot surrounded on three sides by land owned by others, all of which is a part of a beach subdivision.
The fourth side of their lot borders on a platted street called Viejo Street, the right-of-way for which has been dedicated to and accepted by St. Johns County.
The right-of-way line opposite their lot abuts a Corps of Engineers’ right-of-way in which there is a stone breakwater.
The intracoastal waterway flows on the other side of the breakwater.
The realtor who sold the lot to the Barrows represented to them that the county would build a road in the right-of-way along Viejo Street when they began plans for building on their lot.
There have been no street improvements in the dedicated right-of-way, and St. Johns County has no Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 460  present plans for making any improvements.
The “road” is merely a continuation of a sandy beach.
A year after purchasing the land the Barrowses procured a survey which disclosed that the elevation of their lot is approximately one to three feet above the mean high water mark.
They later discovered that their lot, along with the Viejo Street right-of-way abutting it, is covered by high tide water during the spring and fall of each year.
At the time appellees purchased their lot, they obtained title insurance coverage from appellant.
The title policy covered: Any defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title to the estate or title covered hereby…or a lack of a right of access to and from the land.… Appellees’ complaint of lack of right of access was founded on the impassable condition of the platted street.
After trial without a jury, the trial court entered final judgment finding that appellees did not have access to their property and, therefore, were entitled to recover $ 12,500 from appellant the face amount of the policy.
Appellant and Florida Land Title Association, appearing as amicus curiae, argue that appellant cannot be held liable on grounds of “lack of right of access to and from the land” since there is no defect shown by the public record as to their right of access; that the public record shows a dedicated and accepted public right-of-way abutting the lot.
They contend that title insurance does not insure against defects in the physical condition of the land or against infirmities in legal right of access not shown by the public record.
See Pierson v. Bill, 138 Fla. 104, 189 So.
679 (1939).
They argue that defects in the physical condition of the land such as are involved here are not covered by title insurance.
We agree.
Title insurance only insures against title defects.
The Supreme Court of North Carolina in Marriott Financial Services, Inc. v. Capitol Funds, Inc., 288 N.C. 122, 217 S.E.2d 551 (1975), construed “right of access” to mean the right to go to and from the public right-of-way without unreasonable restrictions.Compare Hocking v. Title Insurance & Trust Company, 37 Cal.2d 644, 234 P.2d 625 (1951), where, in ruling that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action in a suit brought under her title policy, the court said: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 461  She appears to possess fee simple title to the property for whatever it may be worth; if she has been damaged by false representations in respect to the condition and value of the land her remedy would seem to be against others than the insurers of the title she acquired.
In Mafetone, et al., v. Forest Manor Homes, Inc., et al., 34 A.D.2d 566, 310 N.Y.S.2d 17 (N.Y.1970), the plaintiff brought an action against a title insurance company for damages allegedly flowing from a change in the grade of a street.
There the court said: The title company is not responsible to plaintiffs for the damages incurred by reason of the change in elevating the abutting street to its legal grade, since the provisions of the standard title insurance policy here in question are concerned with matters affecting title to property and do not concern themselves with physical conditions of the abutting property absent a specific request by the person ordering a title report and policy.… In McDaniel v. Lawyers’ Title Guaranty Fund, 327 So.2d 852 (Fla. 2 D.C.A.
1976), our sister court of the Second District said: The man on the street buys a title insurance policy to insure against defects in the record title.
The title insurance company is in the business of guaranteeing the insured’s title to the extent it is affected by the public records.
In the case here before us, there is no dispute that the public record shows a legal right of access to appellant’s property via the platted Viejo Street.
The title insurance policy only insured against record title defects and not against physical infirmities of the platted street.
Reversed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Do you think that the seller (or the seller’s agent) actually took the Barrowses to see the property when it was underwater?
Why or why not?
2.
Before buying, should the Barrowses have actually gone to the property to see for themselves “the lay of the land” or made inquiries of neighboring lot owners?
3.
Assuming that they did not make inspection of the property or make other inquiries, do you think the seller or the seller’s agent made any misrepresentations about the property that would give the Barrowses any remedies in law or equity?
Delivery of a Deed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 462  Havens v. Schoen 108 Mich. App.
758; 310 N.W.2d 870 (Mich. App.
1981) [Norma Anderson Havens, the owner of certain farm property in Marlette, Michigan, in contemplation of her death executed a quit-claim deed to the property to her only daughter, Linda Karen Anderson.
The deed was subsequently recorded.
Subsequently, Linda Karen Anderson married and became Linda Karen Adams and died.
Thereafter, Norma Anderson Havens and Norman William Scholz, a nephew of Havens who has an interest in the property as the beneficiary of a trust, brought a suit in Sanilac Circuit Court against Ernest E. Schoen, Administrator of the estate of Linda Karen Adams, deceased, and other heirs of James W. Anderson, the ex-husband of Norma Anderson Havens, seeking to set aside the deed or to impose a constructive trust on the farm property which was the subject of the deed.
Arthur E. Moore, J., found no cause of action and entered judgment for defendants.
The plaintiffs appeal alleging error because there never was a delivery of the deed or an intent by Havens to then presently and unconditionally convey an interest in the property.]
PER CURIAM.
In 1962, plaintiff Dr. [Norma Anderson] Havens purchased the Scholz family farm from the estate of her twin brother, Norman Scholz.
She gave a deed of trust to her other brother Earl Scholz in 1964, naming her daughter Linda Karen Adams as the principal beneficiary.
In 1969, she filed suit against Earl and Inez Scholz and, in settlement of that suit, the property was conveyed to Dr. Havens and her daughter, now deceased.
On August 13, 1969, Dr. Havens executed a quit-claim deed to her daughter of her remaining interest in the farm.
It is this deed which Dr. Havens wishes to set aside.
The trial court found that plaintiffs failed to meet the burden of proving an invalid conveyance.
Plaintiffs claim that there was never a delivery or an intent to presently and unconditionally convey an interest in the property to the daughter.
The deed was recorded but defendants presented no other evidence to prove delivery.
The recording of a deed raises a presumption of delivery.
Hooker v Tucker, 335 Mich 429, 434; 56 NW2d 246 (1953).
The only effect of this presumption is to cast upon the opposite party the burden of moving forward with the evidence.

The burden of proving delivery by a preponderance of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 463  evidence remains with the party relying on the deed.
Camp v Guaranty Trust Co, 262 Mich 223, 226; 247 NW 162 (1933).
Acknowledging that the deed was recorded, plaintiffs presented substantial evidence showing no delivery and no intent to presently and unconditionally convey an interest in the property.
The deed, after recording, was returned to Dr. Havens.
She continued to manage the farm and pay all expenses for it.
When asked about renting the farm, the daughter told a witness to ask her mother.
Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to dispel the presumption.
We find that the trial court erred when it stated that plaintiffs had the burden of proof on all issues.
The defendants had the burden of proving delivery and requisite intent.
In Haasjes v Woldring, 10 Mich App 100; 158 NW2d 777 (1968), leave denied 381 Mich 756 (1968), two grandparents executed a deed to property to two grandchildren.
The grandparents continued to live on the property, pay taxes on it and subsequent to the execution of the deed they made statements which this Court found inconsistent with a prior transfer of property.
These circumstances combined with the fact that the deed was not placed beyond the grantors’ control led the Haasjes Court to conclude that a valid transfer of title had not been effected.
The Haasjes Court, citing Wandel v Wandel, 336 Mich 126; 57 NW2d 468 (1953), and Resh v Fox, 365 Mich 288, 112 NW2d 486 (1961), held that in considering whether there was a present intent to pass title, courts may look to the subsequent acts of the grantor.
This Court reviews de novo the determinations of a trial court sitting in an equity case.Chapman v Chapman, 31 Mich App 576, 579; 188 NW2d 21 (1971).
Having reviewed the evidence presented by the defendants to prove delivery, we find that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proof.
Under the circumstances, the recording itself and the language of the deed were not persuasive proof of delivery or intent.
Defendants presented no evidence of possession of the deed by anyone but the grantor and presented no evidence showing knowledge of the deed by the grantee.
No evidence was presented showing that the daughter was ever aware that she owned the property.
The showing made by defendants was inadequate to carry their burden of proof.
The deed must be set aside.
Plaintiffs alleged none of the grounds which have traditionally been recognized as justifying the imposition of a constructive trust.
See Chapman v Chapman, supra.
A constructive trust is imposed only when it would be inequitable to do otherwise.
Arndt v Vos, 83 Mich App 484; 268 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 464  NW2d 693 (1978).
Although plaintiffs claim relief for a mutual mistake, plaintiffs have presented no facts suggesting a mistake on the part of the grantee.
Creation of a constructive trust is not warranted by the facts as found by the trial court.
There has been no claim that those findings are erroneous.
We remand to the trial court to enter an order setting aside the August 13, 1969, deed from Norma Anderson Havens to Linda Karen Anderson Adams purporting to convey the interest of Dr. Havens in the farm.
The decision of the trial court finding no justification for imposing a trust upon the property is affirmed.
Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
DISSENT BY: MacKenzie, J.
(dissenting).
I respectfully dissent.
The deed was recorded with the knowledge and assent of the grantor, which creates a presumption of delivery.
See Schmidt v Jennings, 359 Mich 376, 383; 102 NW2d 589 (1960), Reed v Mack, 344 Mich 391, 397; 73 NW2d 917 (1955).
Crucial evidence was conflicting and I would disagree that the trial court’s findings were clearly erroneous.
In Reed v Mack, the Court affirmed the trial court’s finding that there had been delivery where the grantor defendant, who had owned the property with her husband, recorded a deed conveying a property jointly to herself and the two other grantees, stating: “We are in agreement with the trial court.
The defendant-appellant, a grantor in the deed, caused the recording of the deed, the delivery of which she attacks.
The recording of a warranty deed may, under some circumstances, be effectual to show delivery.
A delivery to one of several joint grantees, in absence of proof to the contrary, is delivery to all.
Mayhew v Wilhelm, 249 Mich 640 [229 NW 459 (1930)].
While placing a deed on record does not in itself necessarily establish delivery, the recording of a deed raises a presumption of delivery, and the whole object of delivery is to indicate an intent by the grantor to give effect to the instrument.” [Citations] In McMahon v Dorsey, 353 Mich 623, 626; 91 NW2d 893 (1958), the significance of delivery was characterized as the manifestation of the grantor’s intent that the instrument be a completed act.
* * * Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 465  The evidence herein indicates that plaintiff Norma Anderson Havens, after she had been told she was dying from cancer, executed a quit-claim deed on August 16, 1969, to her daughter, Linda Karen Anderson.
Plaintiff Havens testified that the reason she executed the deed was that she felt “if something should happen to me, at least Karen would be protected”.
The deed was recorded the same day by plaintiff Havens’s attorney.
Plaintiff Havens either knew that the deed was recorded then or learned of the recording shortly thereafter.
Although plaintiff Havens testified that she intended only a testamentary disposition, she apparently realized that the deed was effective to convey the property immediately because her testimony indicated an intention to execute a trust agreement.
Linda Karen lived on the farm for five years after the deed was recorded until her death in 1974, yet plaintiff Havens did not attempt to have Linda Karen deed the farm back to her so she could replace the deed with a trust agreement or a will.
Plaintiff Havens testified that she approached her attorneys regarding a trust agreement, but both attorneys denied this.
The trial judge specifically found the testimony of the attorneys was convincing and he, of course, had the benefit of observing the witnesses.
Haasjes v Woldring, 10 Mich App 100; 158 NW2d 777 (1968), relied upon by the majority, involved unrecorded deeds which remained in a strongbox under control of the grantors until after their deaths.
The grantors continued to live alone on the property and pay taxes thereon.
Based on the lack of recording, I find Haasjesdistinguishable from the present case.
In Hooker v Tucker, 335 Mich 429; 56 NW2d 246 (1953), delivery was held not to have occurred where the grantor handed her attorney a copy of a deed containing a legal description of property she wished included in a will to be drawn by him and he subsequently mailed the deed to the grantee without the grantor’s knowledge or permission.
The purported delivery by mailing being unauthorized distinguishesHooker from this case where there was no indication the recording was done without the grantor’s authorization.
The majority relies on the grantee’s purported lack of knowledge of the conveyance but the record is not at all clear in this regard.
Further, if a deed is beneficial to the grantee, its acceptance is presumed.
Tackaberry v Monteith, 295 Mich 487, 493; 295 NW 236 (1940), see also Holmes v McDonald, 119 Mich 563; 78 NW 647 (1899).
While the burden of proving delivery is on the person relying upon the instrument, the burden shifts upon its recordation so Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 466  that the grantor must go forward with the evidence of showing nondelivery, once recordation and beneficial interest have been shown.Hooker v Tucker, supra, and Tackaberry, supra.
The trial court properly found that plaintiffs failed to go forward with the evidence and found that the deed conveyed title to the farm.
Factually, this is a difficult case because plaintiff Havens executed a deed which she intended to be a valid conveyance at the time it was executed and recorded.
Subsequently, when her daughter unexpectedly predeceased her, the deed created a result she had not foreseen.
She seeks to eradicate the unintended result by this litigation.
I am reluctant to set aside an unambiguous conveyance which was on record and unchallenged for five years on the basis of the self-serving testimony of the grantor as to her intent at the time she executed the deed and authorized its recordation.
I would affirm.
CASE QUESTION 1.
Which opinion, the majority or the dissenting opinion, do you agree with, and why?
12.5 Summary and Exercises Summary Real property can be held in various forms of ownership.
The most common forms are tenancy in common, joint tenancy, and tenancy by the entirety.
Ten states recognize the community property form of ownership.
In selling real property, various common-law and statutory provisions come into play.
Among the more important statutory provisions are the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1968.
These laws control the manner in which property may be listed and prohibit discrimination in sales.
Sellers and buyers must also be mindful of contract and agency principles governing the listing agreement.
Whether the real estate broker has an exclusive right to sell, an exclusive agency, or an open listing will have an important bearing on the fee to which the broker will be entitled when the property is sold.
The Statute of Frauds requires contracts for the sale of real property to be in writing.
Such contracts must include the names of buyers and sellers, a description of the property, the price, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 467  and signatures.
Unless the contract states otherwise, the seller must deliver marketable title, and the buyer will bear the loss if the property is damaged after the contract is signed but before the closing.
The seller will usually insist on being paid earnest money, and the buyer will usually protect himself contractually against certain contingencies, such as failure to obtain financing.
The contract should also specify the type of deed to be given to the buyer.
To provide protection to subsequent buyers, most states have enacted recording statutes that require buyers to record their purchases in a county office.
The statutes vary: which of two purchasers will prevail depends on whether the state has a notice, notice-race, or race statute.
To protect themselves, buyers usually purchase an abstract and opinion or title insurance.
Although sale is the usual method of acquiring real property, it is possible to take legal title without the consent of the owner.
That method is adverse possession, by which one who openly, continuously, and exclusively possesses property and asserts his right to do so in a manner hostile to the interest of the owner will take title in twenty years in most states.

The rights and duties of landlords 4.
The rights and duties of tenants 5.
The potential tort liability of landlords 13.1 Types and Creation of Leasehold Estates LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 470  1.
Distinguish between the different types of leasehold estates.
2.
Describe how leasehold states can be created, both orally and in writing, and the requirements for creating leases that last for more than one year.
In Chapter 11 "The Nature and Regulation of Real Estate and the Environment", we noted that real property can be divided into types of interests: freehold estates and leasehold estates.
The freehold estate is characterized by indefinite duration, and the owner has title and the right to possess.
The leasehold estate, by contrast, lasts for a specific period.
The owner of the leasehold estate—the tenant—may take possession but does not have title to the underlying real property.
When the period of the leasehold ends, the right to possession reverts to the landlord—hence the landlord’s interest during the tenant’s possession is known as a reversionary interest.
Although a leasehold estate is said to be an interest in real property, the leasehold itself is in fact personal property.
The law recognizes three types of leasehold estates: the estate for years, the periodic tenancy, and the tenancy at will.
Types of Leasehold Estates Estate for Years The estate for years is characterized by a definite beginning and a definite end.
When you rent an apartment for two years, beginning September 1 and ending on the second August 31, you are the owner of an estate for years.
Virtually any period will do; although it is called an estate “for years,” it can last but one day or extend one thousand years or more.
Some statutes declare that any estate for years longer than a specified period—one hundred years in Massachusetts, for instance—is a fee simple estate.
Unless the lease—the agreement creating the leasehold interest—provides otherwise, the estate for years terminates automatically at midnight of the last day specified in the lease.
The lease need not refer explicitly to calendar dates.
It could provide that “the tenant may occupy the premises for six months to commence one week from the date of signing.” Suppose the landlord and tenant sign on June 23.
Then the lease term begins at 12:00 a.m. on July 1 and ends just before midnight of December 31.
Unless a statute provides otherwise, the landlord is not obligated to send the tenant a notice of termination.
Should the tenant die before the lease term Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 471  ends, her property interest can be inherited under her will along with her other personal property or in accordance with the laws of intestate succession.
Periodic Tenancy As its name implies, a periodic tenancy lasts for a period that is renewed automatically until either landlord or tenant notifies the other that it will end.
The periodic tenancy is sometimes called an estate from year to year (or month to month, or week to week).
The lease may provide explicitly for the periodic tenancy by specifying that at the expiration of, say, a one-year lease, it will be deemed renewed for another year unless one party notifies the other to the contrary within six months prior to the expiration of the term.
Or the periodic tenancy may be created by implication, if the lease fails to state a term or is defective in some other way, but the tenant takes possession and pays rent.
The usual method of creating a periodic tenancy occurs when the tenant remains on the premises (“holds over”) when an estate for years under a lease has ended.
The landlord may either reject or accept the implied offer by the tenant to rent under a periodic tenancy.
If he rejects the implied offer, the tenant may be ejected, and the landlord is entitled to rent for the holdover period.
If he accepts the offer, the original lease determines the rent and length of the renewable period, except that no periodic tenancy may last longer than from year to year—that is, the renewable period may never be any longer than twelve months.
At common law, a party was required to give notice at least six months prior to the end of a year- to-year tenancy, and notice equal to the term for any other periodic tenancy.
In most states today, the time period for giving notice is regulated by statute.
In most instances, a year-to-year tenancy requires a month’s notice, and shorter tenancies require notice equal to the term.
To illustrate the approach typically used, suppose Simone rents from Anita on a month-to-month tenancy beginning September 15.
On March 30, Simone passes the orals for her doctorate and decides to leave town.
How soon may she cancel her tenancy?
If she calls Anita that afternoon, she will be two weeks shy of a full month’s notice for the period ending April 15, so the earliest she can finish her obligation to pay rent is May 15.
Suppose her term had been from the first of each month.
On April 1, she notifies Anita of her intention to leave at the end of April, but she is stuck until the end of May, because notice on the first of the month is not notice for a full month.
She would have had to notify Anita by March 31 to terminate the tenancy by April 30.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 472  Tenancy at Will If the landlord and tenant agree that the lease will last only as long as both want it to, then they have created a tenancy at will.
Statutes in most states require some notice of intention to terminate.
Simone comes to the university to study, and Anita gives her a room to stay in for free.
The arrangement is a tenancy at will, and it will continue as long as both want it to.
One Friday night, after dinner with classmates, Simone decides she would rather move in with Bob.
She goes back to her apartment, packs her suitcase, and tells Anita she’s leaving.
The tenancy at will terminates that day.
Creation of Leasehold Estates Oral Leases Leases can be created orally, unless the term of the lease exceeds the period specified by the Statute of Frauds.
In most states, that period is one year.
Any oral lease for a period longer than the statutory period is invalid.
Suppose that Simone, in a state with a one-year Statute of Frauds period, orally agrees with Anita to rent Anita’s apartment for two years, at a monthly rent of $250.
The lease is invalid, and either could repudiate it.
Written Leases A lease required to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds must contain the following items or provisions: (1) it must identify the parties, (2) it must identify the premises, (3) it must specify the duration of the lease, (4) it must state the rent to be paid, and (5) it must be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought (known as “the party to be charged”).
The provisions need not be perfectly stated.
As long as they satisfy the five requirements, they will be adequate to sustain the lease under the Statute of Frauds.
For instance, the parties need not necessarily be named in the lease itself.
Suppose that the prospective tenant gives the landlord a month’s rent in advance and that the landlord gives the tenant a receipt listing the property and the terms of the lease but omitting the name of the tenant.
The landlord subsequently refuses to let the tenant move in.
Who would prevail in court?
Since the tenant had the receipt in her possession, that would be sufficient to identify her as the tenant to whom the terms of the lease were meant to apply.
Likewise, the lease need not specify every aspect of the premises to be enjoyed.
Thus the tenant who rents an apartment in a building will be entitled to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 473  the use of the common stairway, the roof, and so on, even though the lease is silent on these points.
And as long as a specific amount is ascertainable, the rent may be stated in other than absolute dollar terms.
For example, it could be expressed in terms of a cost-of-living index or as a percentage of the tenant’s dollar business volume.
KEY TAKEAWAY A leasehold estate, unlike a freehold estate, has a definite duration.
The landlord’s interest during the term of a leasehold estate is a reversionary interest.
Leasehold estates can last for short terms or very long terms; in the case of long-term leases, a property right is created that can be passed to heirs.
The usual landlord-tenant relationship is a periodic tenancy, which carries with it various common-law and statutory qualifications regarding renewal and termination.
In a tenancy at will, either landlord or tenant can end the leasehold estate as soon as notice is provided by either party.
EXERCISES 1.
What is the difference between a periodic tenancy and a tenancy at will?
2.
What are the essential terms that must be in a written lease?
13.2 Rights and Duties of Landlords and Tenants LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Itemize and explain the rights and duties of landlords.
2.
List and describe the rights and duties of tenants.
3.
Understand the available remedies for tenants when a landlord is in breach of his or her duties.
Rights and Duties of Landlords The law imposes a number of duties on the landlord and gives the tenant a number of corresponding rights.
These include (1) possession, (2) habitable condition, and (3) noninterference with use.
Possession The landlord must give the tenant the right of possession of the property.
This duty is breached if, at the time the tenant is entitled to take possession, a third party has paramount title to the property and the assertion of this title would deprive the tenant of the use contemplated by the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 474  parties.
Paramount title means any legal interest in the premises that is not terminable at the will of the landlord or at the time the tenant is entitled to take possession.
If the tenant has already taken possession and then discovers the paramount title, or if the paramount title only then comes into existence, the landlord is not automatically in breach.
However, if the tenant thereafter is evicted from the premises and thus deprived of the property, then the landlord is in breach.
Suppose the landlord rents a house to a doctor for ten years, knowing that the doctor intends to open a medical office in part of the home and knowing also that the lot is restricted to residential uses only.
The doctor moves in.
The landlord is not yet in default.
The landlord will be in default if a neighbor obtains an injunction against maintaining the office.
But if the landlord did not know (and could not reasonably have known) that the doctor intended to use his home for an office, then the landlord would not be in default under the lease, since the property could have been put to normal—that is, residential—use without jeopardizing the tenant’s right to possession.
Warranty of Habitability As applied to leases, the old common-law doctrine of caveat emptor said that once the tenant has signed the lease, she must take the premises as she finds them.
Since she could inspect them before signing the lease, she should not complain later.
Moreover, if hidden defects come to light, they ought to be easy enough for the tenant herself to fix.
Today this rule no longer applies, at least to residential rentals.
Unless the parties specifically agree otherwise, the landlord is in breach of his lease if the conditions are unsuitable for residential use when the tenant is due to move in.
The landlord is held to an implied warranty of habitability.
The change in the rule is due in part to the conditions of the modern urban setting: tenants have little or no power to walk away from an available apartment in areas where housing is scarce.
It is also due to modem construction and technology: few tenants are capable of fixing most types of defects.
A US court of appeals has said the following: Today’s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested not in the land, but solely in “a house suitable for occupation.” Furthermore, today’s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the “jack-of-all-trades” farmer who was the common law’s model of the lessee.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 475  Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before.
A tenant’s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs.
In addition, the increasing complexity of today’s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times.
In a multiple dwelling, repairs may require access to equipment and areas in control of the landlord.
Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.
[1] At common law, the landlord was not responsible if the premises became unsuitable once the tenant moved in.
This rule was often harshly applied, even for unsuitable conditions caused by a sudden act of God, such as a tornado.
Even if the premises collapsed, the tenant would be liable to pay the rent for the duration of the lease.
Today, however, many states have statutorily abolished the tenant’s obligation to pay the rent if a non-man-made force renders the premises unsuitable.
Moreover, most states today impose on the landlord, after the tenant has moved in, the responsibility for maintaining the premises in a safe, livable condition, consistent with the safety, health, and housing codes of the jurisdiction.
These rules apply only in the absence of an express agreement between the parties.
The landlord and tenant may allocate in the lease the responsibility for repairs and maintenance.
But it is unlikely that any court would enforce a lease provision waiving the landlord’s implied warranty of habitability for residential apartments, especially in areas where housing is relatively scarce.
Noninterference with Use In addition to maintaining the premises in a physically suitable manner, the landlord has an obligation to the tenant not to interfere with a permissible use of the premises.
Suppose Simone moves into a building with several apartments.
One of the other tenants consistently plays music late in the evening, causing Simone to lose sleep.
She complains to the landlord, who has a provision in the lease permitting him to terminate the lease of any tenant who persists in disturbing other tenants.
If the landlord does nothing after Simone has notified him of the disturbance, he will be in breach.
This right to be free of interference with permissible uses is sometimes said to arise from the landlord’s implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 476  Tenant’s Remedies When the landlord breaches one of the foregoing duties, the tenant has a choice of three basic remedies: termination, damages, or rent adjustment.
In virtually all cases where the landlord breaches, the tenant may terminate the lease, thus ending her obligation to continue to pay rent.
To terminate, the tenant must (1) actually vacate the premises during the time that she is entitled to terminate and (2) either comply with lease provisions governing the method of terminating or else take reasonable steps to ensure that the landlord knows she has terminated and why.
When the landlord physically deprives the tenant of possession, he has evicted the tenant; wrongful eviction permits the tenant to terminate the lease.
Even if the landlord’s conduct falls short of actual eviction, it may interfere substantially enough with the tenant’s permissible use so that they are tantamount to eviction.
This is known as constructive eviction, and it covers a wide variety of actions by both the landlord and those whose conduct is attributable to him, as illustrated by Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. v Kaminsky, (see Section 13.5.1 "Constructive Eviction").
Damages Another traditional remedy is money damages, available whenever termination is an appropriate remedy.
Damages may be sought after termination or as an alternative to termination.
Suppose that after the landlord had refused Simone’s request to repair the electrical system, Simone hired a contractor to do the job.
The cost of the repair work would be recoverable from the landlord.
Other recoverable costs can include the expense of relocating if the lease is terminated, moving costs, expenses connected with finding new premises, and any increase in rent over the period of the terminated lease for comparable new space.
A business may recover the loss of anticipated business profits, but only if the extent of the loss is established with reasonable certainty.
In the case of most new businesses, it would be almost impossible to prove loss of profits.
In all cases, the tenant’s recovery will be limited to damages that would have been incurred by a tenant who took all reasonable steps to mitigate losses.
That is, the tenant must take reasonable Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 477  steps to prevent losses attributable to the landlord’s breach, to find new space if terminating, to move efficiently, and so on.
Rent Remedies Under an old common-law rule, the landlord’s obligation to provide the tenant with habitable space and the tenant’s obligation to pay rent wereindependent covenants.
If the landlord breached, the tenant was still legally bound to pay the rent; her only remedies were termination and suit for damages.
But these are often difficult remedies for the tenant.
Termination means the aggravation of moving, assuming that new quarters can be found, and a suit for damages is time consuming, uncertain, and expensive.
The obvious solution is to permit the tenant to withhold rent, or what we here call rent adjustment.
The modern rule, adopted in several states (but not yet in most), holds that the mutual obligations of landlord and tenant are dependent.
States following this approach have developed three types of remedies: rent withholding, rent application, and rent abatement.
The simplest approach is for the tenant to withhold the rent until the landlord remedies the defect.
In some states, the tenant may keep the money.
In other states, the rent must be paid each month into an escrow account or to the court, and the money in the escrow account becomes payable to the landlord when the default is cured.
Several state statutes permit the tenant to apply the rent money directly to remedy the defect or otherwise satisfy the landlord’s performance.
Thus Simone might have deducted from her rent the reasonable cost of hiring an electrician to repair the electrical system.
In some states, the rent may be reduced or even eliminated if the landlord fails to cure specific types of defects, such as violations of the housing code.
The abatement will continue until the default is eliminated or the lease is terminated.
Rights and Duties of Tenants In addition to the duties of the tenant set forth in the lease itself, the common law imposes three other obligations: (1) to pay the rent reserved (stated) in the lease, (2) to refrain from committing waste (damage), and (3) not to use the premises for an illegal purpose.
Duty to Pay Rent Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 478  What constitutes rent is not necessarily limited to the stated periodic payment usually denominated “rent.” The tenant may also be responsible for such assessments as taxes and utilities, payable to the landlord as rent.
Simone’s lease calls for her to pay taxes of $500 per year, payable in quarterly installments.
She pays the rent on the first of each month and the first tax bill on January 1.
On April 1, she pays the rent but defaults on the next tax bill.
She has failed to pay the rent reserved in the lease.
The landlord in the majority of states is not obligated to mitigate his losses should the tenant abandon the property and fail thereafter to pay the rent.
As a practical matter, this means that the landlord need not try to rent out the property but instead can let it sit vacant and sue the defaulting tenant for the balance of the rent as it becomes due.
However, the tenant might notify the landlord that she has abandoned the property or is about to abandon it and offer to surrender it.
If the landlord accepts the surrender, the lease then terminates.
Unless the lease specifically provides for it, a landlord who accepts the surrender will not be able to recover from the tenant the difference between the amount of her rent obligation and the new tenant’s rent obligation.
Many leases require the tenant to make a security deposit—a payment of a specific sum of money to secure the tenant’s performance of duties under the lease.
If the tenant fails to pay the rent or otherwise defaults, the landlord may use the money to make good the tenant’s performance.
Whatever portion of the money is not used to satisfy the tenant’s obligations must be repaid to the tenant at the end of the lease.
In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the landlord must pay interest on the security deposit when he returns the sum to the tenant at the end of the lease.
Alteration and Restoration of the Premises In the absence of a specific agreement in the lease, the tenant is entitled to physically change the premises in order to make the best possible permissible use of the property, but she may not make structural alterations or damage (waste) the property.
A residential tenant may add telephone lines, put up pictures, and affix bookshelves to the walls, but she may not remove a wall in order to enlarge a room.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 479  The tenant must restore the property to its original condition when the lease ends, but this requirement does not include normal wear and tear.
Simone rents an apartment with newly polished wooden floors.
Because she likes the look of oak, she decides against covering the floors with rugs.
In a few months’ time, the floors lose their polish and become scuffed.
Simone is not obligated to refinish the floors, because the scuffing came from normal walking, which is ordinary wear and tear.
Use of the Property for an Illegal Purpose It is a breach of the tenant’s obligation to use the property for an illegal purpose.
A landlord who found a tenant running a numbers racket, for example, or making and selling moonshine whisky could rightfully evict her.
Landlord’s Remedies In general, when the tenant breaches any of the three duties imposed by the common law, the landlord may terminate the lease and seek damages.
One common situation deserves special mention: the holdover tenant.
When a tenant improperly overstays her lease, she is said to be a tenant at sufferance, meaning that she is liable to eviction.
Some cultures, like the Japanese, exhibit a considerable bias toward the tenant, making it exceedingly difficult to move out holdover tenants who decide to stay.
But in the United States, landlords may remove tenants through summary (speedy) proceedings available in every state or, in some cases, through self- help.
Self-help is a statutory remedy for landlords or incoming tenants in some states and involves the peaceful removal of a holdover tenant’s belongings.
If a state has a statute providing a summary procedure for removing a holdover tenant, neither the landlord nor the incoming tenant may resort to self-help, unless the statute specifically allows it.
A provision in the lease permitting self-help in the absence of statutory authority is unenforceable.
Self-help must be peaceful, must not cause physical harm or even the expectation of harm to the tenant or anyone on the premises with his permission, and must not result in unreasonable damage to the tenant’s property.
Any clause in the lease attempting to waive these conditions is void.
Self-help can be risky, because some summary proceeding statutes declare it to be a criminal act and because it can subject the landlord to tort liability.
Suppose that Simone improperly holds over in her apartment.
With a new tenant scheduled to arrive in two days, the landlord knocks Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 480  on her door the evening after her lease expires.
When Simone opens the door, she sees the landlord standing between two 450-pound Sumo wrestlers with menacing expressions.
He demands that she leave immediately.
Fearing for her safety, she departs instantly.
Since she had a reasonable expectation of harm had she not complied with the landlord’s demand, Simone would be entitled to recover damages in a tort suit against her landlord, although she would not be entitled to regain possession of the apartment.
Besides summary judicial proceedings and self-help, the landlord has another possible remedy against the holdover tenant: to impose another rental term.
In order to extend the lease in this manner, the landlord need simply notify the holdover tenant that she is being held to another term, usually measured by the periodic nature of the rent payment.
For example, if rent was paid each month, then imposition of a new term results in a month-to-month tenancy.
One year is the maximum tenancy that the landlord can create by electing to hold the tenant to another term.
KEY TAKEAWAY Both landlords and tenants have rights and duties.
The primary duty of a landlord is to meet the implied warranty of habitability: that the premises are in a safe, livable condition.
The tenant has various remedies available if the landlord fails to meet that duty, or if the landlord fails to meet the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.
These include termination, damages, and withholding of rent.
The tenant has duties as well: to pay the rent, refrain from committing waste, and not use the property for an illegal purpose.
EXERCISES 1.
Consistent with the landlord’s implied warranty of habitability, can the landlord and tenant agree in a lease that the tenant bear any and all expenses to repair the refrigerator, the stove, and the microwave?
2.
Under what conditions is it proper for a tenant to withhold rent from the landlord?

13.3 Transfer of Landlord’s or Tenant’s Interest LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 481  1.
Explain how the landlord’s reversionary interest works and how it may be assigned.
2.
Describe the two ways in which a tenant’s leasehold interest may be transferred to another party.
General Rule At common law, the interests of the landlord and tenant may be transferred freely unless (1) the tenancy is at will; (2) the lease requires either party to perform significant personal services, which would be substantially less likely to be performed if the interest was transferred; or (3) the parties agree that the interest may not be transferred.
Landlord’s Interest When the landlord sells his interest, the purchaser takes subject to the lease.
If there are tenants with leases in an apartment building, the new landlord may not evict them simply because he has taken title.
The landlord may divide his interest as he sees fit, transferring all or only part of his entire interest in the property.
He may assign his right to the rent or sell his reversionary interest in the premises.
For instance, Simone takes a three-year lease on an apartment near the university.
Simone’s landlord gives his aged uncle his reversionary interest for life.
This means that Simone’s landlord is now the uncle, and she must pay him rent and look to him for repairs and other performances owed under the lease.
When Simone’s lease terminates, the uncle will be entitled to rent the premises.
He does so, leasing to another student for three years.
One year later, the uncle dies.
His nephew (Simone’s original landlord) has the reversionary interest and so once again becomes the landlord.
He must perform the lease that the uncle agreed to with the new student, but when that lease expires, he will be free to rent the premises as he sees fit.
Tenant’s Interest Why would a tenant be interested in transferring her leasehold interest?
For at least two reasons: she might need to move before her lease expired, or she might be able to make money on the leasehold itself.
In recent years, many companies in New York have discovered that their present leases were worth far more to them by moving out than staying in.
They had signed long-term leases years ago when the real estate market was glutted and were paying far less than current market prices.
By subletting the premises and moving to cheaper quarters, they could pocket the difference between their lease rate and the market rate they charged their subtenants.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 482  The tenant can transfer her interest in the lease by assigning or by subletting.
In anassignment, the tenant transfers all interest in the premises and all obligations.
Thus the assignee-tenant is duty bound to pay the landlord the periodic rental and to perform all other provisions in the lease.
If the assignee defaulted, however, the original tenant would remain liable to the landlord.
In short, with an assignment, both assignor and assignee are liable under the lease unless the landlord releases the assignor.
By contrast, a sublease is a transfer of something less than the entire leasehold interest (see Figure 13.1 "Assignment vs. Sublease").
For instance, the tenant might have five years remaining on her lease and sublet the premises for two years, or she might sublet the ground floor of a four-story building.
Unlike an assignee, the subtenant does not step into the shoes of the tenant and is not liable to the landlord for performance of the tenant’s duties.
The subtenant’s only obligations are to the tenant.
What distinguishes the assignment from the sublease is not the name but whether or not the entire leasehold interest has been transferred.
If not, the transfer is a sublease.
Figure 13.1 Assignment vs. Sublease Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 483  Many landlords include clauses in their leases prohibiting assignments or subleases, and these clauses are generally upheld.
But the courts construe them strictly, so that a provision barring subleases will not be interpreted to bar assignments.
KEY TAKEAWAY The interests of landlords and tenants can be freely transferred unless the parties agree otherwise or unless there is a tenancy at will.
If the tenant assigns her leasehold interest, she remains liable under the lease unless the landlord releases her.
If less than the entire leasehold interest is transferred, it is a sublease rather than an assignment.
But the original lease may prohibit either or both.
EXERCISES 1.
What is the difference between an assignment and a sublease?
2.
Are the duties of the tenant any different if the reversionary interest is assigned?
Suppose that Simone is in year one of a three-year lease and that Harry is the landlord.
If Harry assigns his reversionary interest to Louise, can Louise raise the rent for the next two years beyond what is stated in the original lease?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 484  13.4 Landlord’s Tort Liability LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
State the general common-law rule as to the liability of the landlord for injuries occurring on the leased premises.
2.
State the exceptions to the general rule, and explain the modern trend toward increased liability of the landlord.
In Chapter 11 "The Nature and Regulation of Real Estate and the Environment", we discussed the tort liability of the owner or occupier of real estate to persons injured on the property.
As a general rule, when injury occurs on premises rented to a tenant, it is the tenant—an occupier— who is liable.
The reason for this rule seems clear: The landlord has given up all but a reversionary interest in the property; he has no further control over the premises.
Indeed, he is not even permitted on the property without the tenant’s permission.
But over the years, certain exceptions have developed to the rule that the landlord is not liable.
The primary reason for this change is the recognition that the landlord is better able to pay for repairs to his property than his relatively poorer tenants and that he has ultimate control over the general conditions surrounding the apartment or apartment complex.
Exceptions to the General Rule Hidden Dangers Known to Landlord The landlord is liable to the tenant, her family, or guests who are injured by hidden and dangerous conditions that the landlord knew about or should have known about but failed to disclose to the tenant.
Dangers to People off the Premises The landlord is liable to people injured outside the property by defects that existed when the lease was signed.
Simone rents a dilapidated house and agrees with the landlord to keep the building repaired.
She neglects to hire contractors to repair the cracked and sagging wall on the street.
The building soon collapses, crushing several automobiles parked alongside.
Simone can be held responsible and so can the landlord; the tenant’s contractual agreement to maintain the property is not sufficient to shift the liability away from the landlord.
In a few cases, the landlord Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 485  has even been held liable for activities carried on by the tenant, but only because he knew about them when the lease was signed and should have known that the injuries were probable results.
Premises Leased for Admitting the Public A landlord is responsible for injuries caused by dangerous conditions on property to be used by the public if the danger existed when the lease was made.
Thus an uneven floor that might cause people to trip or a defective elevator that stops a few inches below the level of each floor would be sufficiently dangerous to pin liability on the landlord.
Landlord Retaining Control of Premises Frequently, a landlord will retain control over certain areas of the property—for example, the common hallways and stairs in an apartment building.
When injuries occur as a result of faulty and careless maintenance of these areas, the landlord will be responsible.
In more than half the states, the landlord is liable for failure to remove ice and snow from a common walkway and stairs at the entrance.
In one case, the tenant even recovered damages for a broken hip caused when she fell in fright from seeing a mouse that jumped out of her stove; she successfully charged the landlord with negligence in failing to prevent mice from entering the dwelling in areas under his control.
Faulty Repair of Premises Landlords often have a duty to repair the premises.
The duty may be statutory or may rest on an agreement in the lease.
In either case, the landlord will be liable to a tenant or others for injury resulting from defects that should have been repaired.
No less important, a landlord will be liable even if he has no duty to repair but negligently makes repairs that themselves turn out to be dangerous.
KEY TAKEAWAY At common law, injuries taking place on leased premises were the responsibility of the tenant.
There were notable exceptions, including situations where hidden dangers were known to the landlord but not the tenant, where the premises’ condition caused injury to people off the premises, or where faulty repairs caused the injuries.
The modern trend is to adopt general negligence principles to determine landlord liability.
Thus where the landlord Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 486  does not use reasonable care and subjects others to an unreasonable risk of harm, there may be liability for the landlord.
This varies from state to state.
EXERCISES 1.
What was the basic logic of the common law in having tenants be responsible for all injuries that took place on leased premises?
2.
Does the modern trend of applying general negligence principles to landlords make more sense?
Explain your answer.
13.5 Cases Constructive Eviction Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Kaminsky 768 S.W.2d 818 (Tx.
Ct. App.
1989) MURPHY, JUSTICE The issue in this landlord-tenant case is whether sufficient evidence supports the jury’s findings that the landlord and appellant, Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company [“Fidelity”], constructively evicted the tenant, Robert P. Kaminsky, M.D., P.A.
[“Dr.
Kaminsky”] by breaching the express covenant of quiet enjoyment contained in the parties’ lease.
We affirm.
Dr. Kaminsky is a gynecologist whose practice includes performing elective abortions.
In May 1983, he executed a lease contract for the rental of approximately 2,861 square feet in the Red Oak Atrium Building for a two-year term which began on June 1, 1983.
The terms of the lease required Dr. Kaminsky to use the rented space solely as “an office for the practice of medicine.” Fidelity owns the building and hires local companies to manage it.
At some time during the lease term, Shelter Commercial Properties [“Shelter”] replaced the Horne Company as managing agents.
Fidelity has not disputed either management company’s capacity to act as its agent.
The parties agree that: (1) they executed a valid lease agreement; (2) Paragraph 35 of the lease contains an express covenant of quiet enjoyment conditioned on Dr. Kaminsky’s paying rent when due, as he did through November 1984; Dr. Kaminsky abandoned the leased premises on or about December 3, 1984 and refused to pay additional rent; anti-abortion protestors began Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 487  picketing at the building in June of 1984 and repeated and increased their demonstrations outside and inside the building until Dr. Kaminsky abandoned the premises.
When Fidelity sued for the balance due under the lease contract following Dr. Kaminsky’s abandonment of the premises, he claimed that Fidelity constructively evicted him by breaching Paragraph 35 of the lease.
Fidelity apparently conceded during trial that sufficient proof of the constructive eviction of Dr. Kaminsky would relieve him of his contractual liability for any remaining rent payments.
Accordingly, he assumed the burden of proof and the sole issue submitted to the jury was whether Fidelity breached Paragraph 35 of the lease, which reads as follows: Quiet Enjoyment Lessee, on paying the said Rent, and any Additional Rental, shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Leased Premises for the said term.
A constructive eviction occurs when the tenant leaves the leased premises due to conduct by the landlord which materially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.
Texas law relieves the tenant of contractual liability for any remaining rentals due under the lease if he can establish a constructive eviction by the landlord.
The protests took place chiefly on Saturdays, the day Dr. Kaminsky generally scheduled abortions.
During the protests, the singing and chanting demonstrators picketed in the building’s parking lot and inner lobby and atrium area.
They approached patients to speak to them, distributed literature, discouraged patients from entering the building and often accused Dr. Kaminsky of “killing babies.” As the protests increased, the demonstrators often occupied the stairs leading to Dr. Kaminsky’s office and prevented patients from entering the office by blocking the doorway.
Occasionally they succeeded in gaining access to the office waiting room area.
Dr. Kaminsky complained to Fidelity through its managing agents and asked for help in keeping the protestors away, but became increasingly frustrated by a lack of response to his requests.
The record shows that no security personnel were present on Saturdays to exclude protestors from the building, although the lease required Fidelity to provide security service on Saturdays.
The record also shows that Fidelity’s attorneys prepared a written statement to be handed to the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 488  protestors soon after Fidelity hired Shelter as its managing agent.
The statement tracked TEX.
PENAL CODE ANN.
§30.05 (Vernon Supp.
1989) and generally served to inform trespassers that they risked criminal prosecution by failing to leave if asked to do so.
Fidelity’s attorneys instructed Shelter’s representative to “have several of these letters printed up and be ready to distribute them and verbally demand that these people move on and off the property.” The same representative conceded at trial that she did not distribute these notices.
Yet when Dr. Kaminsky enlisted the aid of the Sheriff’s office, officers refused to ask the protestors to leave without a directive from Fidelity or its agent.
Indeed, an attorney had instructed the protestors to remain unless the landlord or its representative ordered them to leave.
It appears that Fidelity’s only response to the demonstrators was to state, through its agents, that it was aware of Dr. Kaminsky’s problems.
Both action and lack of action can constitute “conduct” by the landlord which amounts to a constructive eviction.… This case shows ample instances of Fidelity’s failure to act in the fact of repeated requests for assistance despite its having expressly covenanted Dr. Kaminsky’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.
These instances provided a legally sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that Dr. Kaminsky abandoned the leased premises, not because of the trespassing protestors, but because of Fidelity’s lack of response to his complaints about the protestors.
Under the circumstances, while it is undisputed that Fidelity did not “encourage” the demonstrators, its conduct essentially allowed them to continue to trespass.
[The trial court judgment is affirmed.]
CASE QUESTIONS A constructive eviction occurs when the tenant leaves the leased premises because of conduct by the landlord that materially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.
1.
At the trial, who concluded that Fidelity’s “conduct” constituted constructive eviction?
Is this a question of fact, an interpretation of the contract, or both?
2.
How can failure to act constitute “conduct”?
What could explain Fidelity’s apparent reluctance to give notice to protestors that they might be arrested for trespass?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 489  Landlord’s Tort Liability Stephens v. Stearns 106 Idaho 249; 678 P.2d 41 (Idaho Sup.
Ct. 1984) Donaldson, Chief Justice Plaintiff-appellant Stephens filed this suit on October 2, 1978, for personal injuries she sustained on July 15, 1977, from a fall on an interior stairway of her apartment.
Plaintiff’s apartment, located in a Boise apartment complex, was a “townhouse” consisting of two separate floors connected by an internal stairway.
The apartments were built by defendant Koch and sold to defendant Stearns soon after completion in 1973.
Defendant Stearns was plaintiff’s landlord from the time she moved into the apartment in 1973 through the time of plaintiff’s fall on July 15, 1977.
Defendant Albanese was the architect who designed and later inspected the apartment complex.
* * * When viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, the facts are as follows: On the evening of July 15, 1977, Mrs. Stephens went to visit friends.
While there she had two drinks.
She returned to her apartment a little past 10:00 p.m. Mrs. Stephens turned on the television in the living room and went upstairs to change clothes.
After changing her clothes, she attempted to go downstairs to watch television.
As Mrs. Stephens reached the top of the stairway, she either slipped or fell forward.
She testified that she “grabbed” in order to catch herself.
However, Mrs. Stephens was unable to catch herself and she fell to the bottom of the stairs.
As a result of the fall, she suffered serious injury.
The evidence further showed that the stairway was approximately thirty-six inches wide and did not have a handrail although required by a Boise ordinance.
* * * In granting defendant Stearns’ motion for directed verdict, the trial judge concluded that there was “an absolute lack of evidence” and that “to find a proximate cause between the absence of the handrail and the fall suffered by the plaintiff would be absolutely conjecture and speculation.” (Although the trial judge’s conclusion referred to “proximate cause,” it is apparent Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 490  that he was referring to factual or actual cause.
See Munson v. State, Department of Highways, 96 Idaho 529, 531 P.2d 1174 (1975).)
We disagree with the conclusion of the trial judge.
We have considered the facts set out above in conjunction with the testimony of Chester Shawver, a Boise architect called as an expert in the field of architecture, that the primary purpose of a handrail is for user safety.
We are left with the firm conviction that there is sufficient evidence from which reasonable jurors could have concluded that the absence of a handrail was the actual cause of plaintiff’s injuries; i.e., that plaintiff would not have fallen, or at least would have been able to catch herself, had there been a handrail available for her to grab.
In addition, we do not believe that the jury would have had to rely on conjecture and speculation to find that the absence of the handrail was the actual cause.
To the contrary, we believe that reasonable jurors could have drawn legitimate inferences from the evidence presented to determine the issue.
This comports with the general rule that the factual issue of causation is for the jury to decide.
McKinley v. Fanning, 100 Idaho 189, 595 P.2d 1084 (1979); Munson v. State, Department of Highways, supra.
In addition, courts in several other jurisdictions, when faced with similar factual settings, have held that this issue is a question for the jury.
* * * Rather than attempt to squeeze the facts of this case into one of the common-law exceptions, plaintiff instead has brought to our attention the modern trend of the law in this area.
Under the modern trend, landlords are simply under a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.
The Tennessee Supreme Court had the foresight to grasp this concept many years ago when it stated: “The ground of liability upon the part of a landlord when he demises dangerous property has nothing special to do with the relation of landlord and tenant.
It is the ordinary case of liability for personal misfeasance, which runs through all the relations of individuals to each other.” Wilcox v. Hines, 100 Tenn. 538, 46 S.W.
297, 299 (1898).
Seventy- five years later, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire followed the lead of Wilcox.
Sargent v. Ross, 113 N.H. 388, 308 A.2d 528 (1973).
The Sargent court abrogated the common-law rule and its exceptions, and adopted the reasonable care standard by stating: We thus bring up to date the other half of landlord-tenant law.
Henceforth, landlords as other persons must exercise reasonable care not to subject others to an unreasonable risk of harm.…A Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 491  landlord must act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk.
Id.
at 534 [Citations] Tennessee and New Hampshire are not alone in adopting this rule.
As of this date, several other states have also judicially adopted a reasonable care standard for landlords.
* * * In commenting on the common-law rule, A. James Casner, Reporter of Restatement (Second) of Property—Landlord and Tenant, has stated: “While continuing to pay lip service to the general rule, the courts have expended considerable energy and exercised great ingenuity in attempting to fit various factual settings into the recognized exceptions.” Restatement (Second) of Property—Landlord and Tenant ch.
17 Reporter’s Note to Introductory Note (1977).
We believe that the energies of the courts of Idaho should be used in a more productive manner.
Therefore, after examining both the common-law rule and the modern trend, we today decide to leave the common-law rule and its exceptions behind, and we adopt the rule that a landlord is under a duty to exercise reasonable care in light of all the circumstances.
We stress that adoption of this rule is not tantamount to making the landlord an insurer for all injury occurring on the premises, but merely constitutes our removal of the landlord’s common- law cloak of immunity.
Those questions of hidden danger, public use, control, and duty to repair, which under the common-law were prerequisites to the consideration of the landlord’s negligence, will now be relevant only inasmuch as they pertain to the elements of negligence, such as foreseeability and unreasonableness of the risk.
We hold that defendant Stearns did owe a duty to plaintiff Stephens to exercise reasonable care in light of all the circumstances, and that it is for a jury to decide whether that duty was breached.
Therefore, we reverse the directed verdict in favor of defendant Stearns and remand for a new trial of plaintiff’s negligence action against defendant Stearns.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Why should actual cause be a jury question rather than a question that the trial judge decides on her own?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 492  2.
Could this case have fit one of the standard exceptions to the common-law rule that injuries on the premises are the responsibility of the tenant?
3.
Does it mean anything at all to say, as the court does, that persons (including landlords) must “exercise reasonable care not to subject others to an unreasonable risk of harm?” Is this a rule that gives very much direction to landlords who may wonder what the limit of their liabilities might be?
13.6 Summary and Exercises Summary A leasehold is an interest in real property that terminates on a certain date.
The leasehold itself is personal property and has three major forms: (1) the estate for years, (2) the periodic tenancy, and (3) the tenancy at will.
The estate for years has a definite beginning and end; it need not be measured in years.
A periodic tenancy—sometimes known as an estate from year to year or month to month—is renewed automatically until either landlord or tenant notifies the other that it will end.
A tenancy at will lasts only as long as both landlord and tenant desire.
Oral leases are subject to the Statute of Frauds.
In most states, leases to last longer than a year must be in writing, and the lease must identify the parties and the premises, specify the duration, state the rent, and be signed by the party to be charged.
The law imposes on the landlord certain duties toward the tenant and gives the tenant corresponding rights, including the right of possession, habitable condition, and noninterference with use.
The right of possession is breached if a third party has paramount title at the time the tenant is due to take possession.
In most states, a landlord is obligated to provide the tenant with habitable premises not only when the tenant moves in but also during the entire period of the lease.
The landlord must also refrain from interfering with a tenant’s permissible use of the premises.
If the landlord breaches an obligation, the tenant has several remedies.
He may terminate the lease, recover damages, or (in several states) use a rent-related remedy (by withholding rent, by applying it to remedy the defect, or by abatement).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 493  The tenant has duties also.
The tenant must pay the rent.
If she abandons the property and fails to pay, most states do not require the landlord to mitigate damages, but several states are moving away from this general rule.
The tenant may physically change the property to use it to her best advantage, but she may not make structural alterations or commit waste.
The tenant must restore the property to its original condition when the lease ends.
This rule does not include normal wear and tear.
Should the tenant breach any of her duties, the landlord may terminate the lease and seek damages.
In the case of a holdover tenant, the landlord may elect to hold the tenant to another rental term.
The interest of either landlord or tenant may be transferred freely unless the tenancy is at will, the lease requires either party to perform significant personal services that would be substantially less likely to be performed, or the parties agree that the interest may not be transferred.
Despite the general rule that the tenant is responsible for injuries caused on the premises to outsiders, the landlord may have significant tort liability if (1) there are hidden dangers he knows about, (2) defects that existed at the time the lease was signed injure people off the premises, (3) the premises are rented for public purposes, (4) the landlord retains control of the premises, or (5) the landlord repairs the premises in a faulty manner.

How a will is distinguished from a trust, and how a trust is created, how it functions, and how it may come to an end 6.
The various kinds of trusts, as well as factors that affect both estates and trusts Broadly defined, estate planning is the process by which someone decides how his assets are to be passed on to others at his death.
Estate planning has two general objectives: to ensure that the assets are transferred according to the owner’s wishes and to minimize state and federal taxes.
People have at their disposal four basic estate planning tools: (1) wills, (2) trusts, (3) gifts, and (4) joint ownership (see Figure 14.1 "Estate Planning").
The rules governing gifts are discussed in Chapter 9 "Introduction to Property: Personal Property and Fixtures", and joint ownership is treated in Chapter 11 "The Nature and Regulation of Real Estate and the Environment".
Consequently, we focus on the first two tools here.
In addition to these tools, certain assets, such as insurance (discussed in Chapter 15 "Insurance"), are useful in estate planning.
Figure 14.1 Estate Planning Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 497  Estate planning not only provides for the spouses and children, other relatives and friends, the children’s education, payoff of the mortgage, and so on, but also serves as the principal means by which liquidity can be guaranteed for taxes, expenses for administering the estate, and the like, while preserving the assets of the estate.
And whenever a business is formed, estate planning consequences should always be considered, because the form and structure of the business can have important tax ramifications for the individual owners.
14.1 Wills and Estate Administration LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe how property, both real and personal, can be devised and bequeathed to named heirs in a will.
2.
Understand what happens to property of a decedent when there is no will.
3.
Explain the requirements for “testamentary capacity”—what it takes to make a valid will that can be admitted to probate.
4.
Describe the steps in the probate and administration of a will.
Definition A will is the declaration of a person’s wishes about the disposition of his assets on his death.
Normally a written document, the will names the persons who are to receive specific items of real and personal property.
Unlike a contract or a deed, a will is not binding as long as the person making the will lives.
He may revoke it at any time.
Wills have served their present function for virtually all of recorded history.
The earliest known will is from 1800 BC (see Figure 14.2 "An Ancient Will").
Even if somewhat different in form, it served the same basic function as a modern will.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 498  Figure 14.2 An Ancient Will Source: John H. Wigmore, A Panorama of the World’s Legal Systems, vol.
1, p. 22.
Although most wills are written in a standardized form, some special types of wills are enforceable in many states.
1.
A nuncupative will is one that is declared orally in front of witnesses.
In states where allowed, the statutes permit it to be used only when the testator is dying as he declares his will.
(A testator is one who dies with a will.)
2.
A holographic will is one written entirely by the testator’s hand and not witnessed.
At common law, a holographic will was invalid if any part of the paper on which it was written contained Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 499  printing.
Modern statutes tend to validate holographic wills, even with printing, as long as the testator who signs it puts down material provisions in his own hand.
3.
Soldiers’ and sailors’ wills are usually enforceable, no matter how informal the document, if made while the soldier is on service or the sailor is at sea (although they cannot usually transfer real property without observing certain formalities).
4.
A conditional will is one that will take effect only on the happening of a particular named event.
For example, a man intending to marry might write, “This will is contingent on my marrying Alexa Jansey.” If he and Ms. Jansey do not marry, the will can have no operational effect.
5.
A joint will is one in which two (or more) people use the same instrument to dispose of their assets.
It must be signed by each person whose assets it is to govern.
6.
Mutual or reciprocal wills are two or more instruments with reciprocal terms, each written by a person who intends to dispose of his or her assets in favor of the others.
The Uniform Probate Code Probate is the process by which a deceased’s estate is managed under the supervision of a court.
In most states, the court supervising this process is a specialized one and is often called the probate court.
Probate practices vary widely from state to state, although they follow a general pattern in which the assets of an estate are located, added up, and disbursed according to the terms of the will or, if there is no will, according to the law of intestate succession.
To attempt to bring uniformity into the conflicting sets of state laws the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws issued the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) in 1969, and by 2011 it had been adopted in its entirety in sixteen states.
Several other states have adopted significant parts of the UPC, which was revised in 2006.
Our discussion of wills and estate administration is drawn primarily from the UPC, but you should note that there are variations among the states in some of the procedures standardized in the UPC.
Will Requirements and Interpretation Capacity Any person who is over eighteen and of “sound mind” may make a will.
One who is insane may not make an enforceable will, although the degree of mental capacity necessary to sustain a will is generally said to be a “modest level of competence” and is lower than the degree of capacity Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 500  people must possess to manage their own affairs during their life.
In other words, a court might order a guardian to manage the affairs of one who is mentally deficient but will uphold a will that the person has written.
Insanity is not the only type of mental deficiency that will disqualify a will; medication of a person for serious physical pain might lead to the conclusion that the person’s mind was dulled and he did not understand what he was doing when writing his will.
The case Estate of Seymour M. Rosen, (see Section 14.4.1 "Testamentary Capacity"), considers just such a situation.
Writing Under the UPC, wills must be in writing.
The will is not confined to the specific piece of paper called “will” and signed by the testator.
It may incorporate by reference any other writing in existence when the will is made, as long as the will sufficiently identifies the other writing and manifests an intent to incorporate it.
Although lawyers prepare neatly typed wills, the document can be written in pencil or pen and on any kind of paper or even on the back of an envelope.
Typically, the written will has the following provisions: (1) a “publication clause,” listing the testator’s name and his or her intention to make a will; (2) a “revocation clause,” revoking all previously made wills; (3) burial instructions; (4) debt payments, listing specific assets to be used; (5)bequests, which are gifts of personal property by will; (6) devises, which are gifts of real property by will; (7) a “residuary clause,” disposing of all property not covered by a specific bequest or devise; (8) a “penalty clause,” stating a penalty for anyone named in the will who contests the will; (9) the name of minor children’s guardian; and (10) the name of the executor.
The executor’s job is to bring in all the assets of an estate, pay all just claims, and make distribution to beneficiaries in accord with the testator’s wishes.
Beginning with California in 1983, several states have adopted statutory wills—simple fill-in-the-blank will forms that can be completed without consulting an attorney.
Signature The testator must sign the will, and the proper place for the signature is at the end of the entire document.
The testator need not sign his full name, although that is preferable; his initials or some other mark in his own hand, intended as an execution of the document, will suffice.
The Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 501  UPC permits someone else to sign for the testator as long as the signing is done in the testator’s presence and by his or her direction.
Witnesses Most states require two or three witnesses to sign the will.
The UPC requires two witnesses.
The witnesses should observe the testator sign the will and then sign it themselves in the presence of each other.
Since the witnesses might be asked to attest in court to the testator’s signature, it is sound practice to avoid witnesses who are unduly elderly and to use an extra witness or two.
Most states forbid a person who has an interest in the will—that is, one who is a beneficiary under the will—from witnessing.
In some states, a beneficiary who serves as a witness will lose his or her right to a bequest or devise.
The UPC differs from the usual rule: no will or any provision of a will is invalid because an interested party witnesses it, nor does the interested witness forfeit a bequest or devise.
Revocation and Modification Since wills are generally effective only at death, the testator may always revoke or amend a will during his lifetime.
He may do so by tearing, burning, obliterating, or otherwise destroying it.
A subsequent will has the effect of revoking an inconsistent prior will, and most wills expressly state that they are intended to revoke all prior wills.
A written modification of or supplement to a prior will is called a codicil.
The codicil is often necessary, because circumstances are constantly changing.
The testator may have moved to a new state where he must meet different formal requirements for executing the will; one of his beneficiaries may have died; his property may have changed.
Or the law, especially the tax law, may have changed.
One exception to the rule that wills are effective only at death is the so-calledliving will.
Beginning with California in 1976, most states have adopted legislation permitting people to declare that they refuse further treatment should they become terminally ill and unable to tell physicians not to prolong their lives if they can survive only by being hooked up to life- preserving machines.
This living will takes effect during the patient’s life and must be honored by physicians unless the patient has revoked it.
The patient may revoke at any time, even as he sees the doctor moving to disconnect the plug.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 502  In most states, a later marriage revokes a prior will, but divorce does not.
Under the UPC, however, a divorce or annulment revokes any disposition of property bequeathed or devised to the former spouse under a will executed prior to the divorce or annulment.
A will is at least partially revoked if children are born after it is executed, unless it has either provided for subsequently born children or stated the testator’s intention to disinherit such children.
Abatement Specific bequests listed in a will might not be available in the estate when the testator or testatrix dies.
Abatement of a bequest happens when there are insufficient assets to pay the bequest.
Suppose the testatrix leaves $10,000 each to “my four roommates,” but when she dies, her estate is worth only $20,000.
The gift to each of the roommates is said to have abated, and each will take only $5,000.
Abatement can pose a serious problem in wills not carefully drafted.
Since circumstances can always change, a general provision in a father’s will, providing “my dear daughter with all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate,” will do her little good if business reverses mean that the $10,000 bequest to the local hospital exhausts the estate of its assets—even though at the time the will was made, the testator had assets of $1 million and supposed his daughter would be getting the bulk of it.
Since specific gifts must be paid out ahead of general bequests or devises, abatement can cause the residual legatee (the person taking all assets not specifically distributed to named individuals) to suffer.
Ademption Suppose that a testator bequeathed her 1923 Rolls Royce to “my faithful secretary,” but that the car had been sold and she owned only a 1980 Volkswagen when she died.
Since the Rolls was not part of the estate, it is said to have adeemed (to have been taken away).
Ademption of a gift in a will means that the intended legatee (the person named in the will) forfeits the object because it no longer exists.
An object used as a substitute by the testator will not pass to the legatee unless it is clear that she intended the legatee to have it.
Intestacy Intestacy means dying without a will.
Intestacy happens all too frequently; even those who know the consequences for their heirs often put off making a will until it is too late—Abraham Lincoln, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 503  for one, who as an experienced lawyer knew very well the hazards to heirs of dying intestate.
On his death, Lincoln’s property was divided, with one-third going to his widow, one-third to a grown son, and one-third to a twelve-year-old son.
Statistics show that in New York, about one- third of the people who die with estates of $5,000 or more die without wills.
In every state, statutes provide for the disposition of property of decedents dying without wills.
If you die without a will, the state in effect has made one for you.
Although the rules vary by statute from state to state, a common distribution pattern prevails.
Unmarried Decedent At common law, parents of an intestate decedent could not inherit his property.
Today, however, many states provide that parents will share in the property.
If the parents have already died, then the estate will pass to collateral heirs (siblings, nieces, nephews, aunts, and uncles).
If there are no collateral heirs, most state laws provide that the next surviving kin of equal degree will share the property equally (e.g., first cousins).
If there are no surviving kin, the estate escheats (es CHEETS) to the state, which is then the sole owner of the assets of the estate.
Married with No Children In some states, the surviving spouse without children will inherit the entire estate.
In other states, the spouse must share the property with the decedent’s parents or, if they are deceased, with the collateral heirs.
Married with Children In general, the surviving spouse will be entitled to one-third of the estate, and the remainder will pass in equal shares to living children of the decedent.
The share of any child who died before the decedent will be divided equally among that child’s offspring.
These grandchildren of the decedent are said to take per stirpes (per STIR peas), meaning that they stand in the shoes of their parent.
Suppose that the decedent left a wife, three children, and eight grandchildren (two children each of the three surviving children and two children of a fourth child who predeceased the decedent), and that the estate was worth $300,000.
Under a typical intestate succession law, the widow would receive property worth $100,000.
The balance of the property would be divided into four equal parts, one for each of the four children.
The three surviving children Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 504  would each receive $50,000.
The two children of the fourth child would each receive $25,000.
The other grandchildren would receive nothing.
A system of distribution in which all living descendants share equally, regardless of generation, is said to be a distribution per capita.
In the preceding example, after the widow took her share, the remaining sum would be divided into eleven parts, three for the surviving children and eight for the surviving grandchildren.
Unmarried with Children If the decedent was a widow or widower with children, then the surviving children generally will take the entire estate.
Estate Administration To carry on the administration of an estate, a particular person must be responsible for locating the estate property and carrying out the decedent’s instructions.
If named in the will, this person is called an executor.
When a woman serves, she is still known in many jurisdictions as an executrix.
If the decedent died intestate, the court will appoint an administrator (or administratrix, if a woman), usually a close member of the family.
The UPC refers to the person performing the function of executor or administrator as a personal representative.
Unless excused by the will from doing so, the personal representative must post a bond, usually in an amount that exceeds the value of the decedent’s personal property.
The personal representative must immediately become familiar with the decedent’s business, preserve the assets, examine the books and records, check on insurance, and notify the appropriate banks.
When confirmed by the court (if necessary), the personal representative must offer the will in probate—that is, file the will with the court, prove its authenticity through witnesses, and defend it against any challenges.
Once the court accepts the will, it will enter a formal decree admitting the will to probate.
Traditionally, a widow could make certain elections against the will; for example, she could choose dower and homestead rights.
The right of dower entitled the widow to a life estate in one-third of the husband’s inheritable land, while a homestead right is the right to the family home as measured by an amount of land (e.g., 160 acres of rural land or 1 acre of urban land in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 505  Kansas) or a specific dollar amount.
In some states, this amount is quite low (e.g., $4,000 in Kansas) where the legislature has not upwardly adjusted the dollar amount for many years.
Today, most states have eliminated traditional dower rights.
These states give the surviving spouse (widow or widower) the right to reject provisions made in a will and to take a share of the decedent’s estate instead.
Once the will is admitted to probate, the personal representative must assemble and inventory all assets.
This task requires the personal representative to collect debts and rent due, supervise the decedent’s business, inspect the real estate, store personal and household effects, prove the death and collect proceeds of life insurance policies, take securities into custody, and ascertain whether the decedent held property in other states.
Next, the assets must be appraised as of the date of death.
When inventory and appraisal are completed, the personal representative must decide how and when to dispose of the assets by answering the following sorts of questions: Should a business be liquidated, sold, or allowed to continue to operate?
Should securities be sold, and if so, when?
Should the real estate be kept intact under the will or sold?
To whom must the personal effects be given?
The personal representative must also handle claims against the estate.
If the decedent had unpaid debts while alive, the estate will be responsible for paying them.
In most states, the personal representative is required to advertise that the estate is in probate.
When all claims have been gathered and authenticated, the personal representative must pay just claims in order of priority.
In general (though by no means in every state), the order of priority is as follows: (1) funeral expenses, (2) administration expenses (cost of bond, advertising expenses, filing fees, lawsuit costs, etc.
), (3) family allowance, (4) claims of the federal government, (5) hospital and other expenses associated with the decedent’s last illness, (6) claims of state and local governments, (7) wage claims, (8) lien claims, (9) all other debts.
If the estate is too small to cover all these claims, every claim in the first category must be satisfied before the claims in the second category may be paid, and so on.
Before the estate can be distributed, the personal representative must take care of all taxes owed by the estate.
She will have to file returns for both estate and income taxes and pay from assets of the estate the taxes due.
(She may have to sell some assets to obtain sufficient cash to do Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 506  so.)
Estate taxes—imposed by the federal government and based on the value of the estate—are nearly as old as the Republic; they date back to 1797.
They were instituted originally to raise revenue, but in our time they serve also to break up large estates.
As of 2011, the first $1 million of an estate is exempt from taxation, lowering the threshold from an earlier standard.
The Tax Policy Institute of the Brookings Institution estimates that 108,200 estates of people dying in 2011 will file estate tax returns, and 44,200 of those estates will pay taxes totaling $34.4 billion.
Although a unified tax is imposed on gifts during life and transfers at death, everyone is permitted to give away $13,000 per donee each year without paying any tax on the gift.
A tax on sizable gifts is imposed to prevent people with large estates from giving away during their lives portions of their estate in order to escape estate taxes.
Thus two grandparents with two married children and four grandchildren may give away $26,000 ($13,000 from each grandparent) to their eight descendants (children, spouses, grandchildren) each year, for a total of $208,000, without paying any tax.
State governments also impose taxes at death.
In many states, these are known asinheritance taxes and are taxes on the heir’s right to receive the property.
The tax rate depends on the relationship to the decedent: the closer the relation, the smaller the tax.
Thus a child will pay less than a nephew or niece, and either of them will pay less than an unrelated friend who is named in the will.
Once the taxes are paid, a final accounting must be prepared, showing the remaining principal, income, and disbursements.
Only at this point may the personal representative actually distribute the assets of the estate according to the will.
KEY TAKEAWAY Any person with the requisite capacity may make a will and bequeath personal property to named heirs.
A will can also devise real property.
Throughout the United States, there are fairly common requirements to be met for a will to qualify for probate.
Intestacy statutes will govern where there is no will, and an administrator will be appointed by the probate court.
Intestacy statutes will dictate which relatives will get what portion of the decedent’s estate, portions that are likely to differ from what the decedent would have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 507  done had he or she left a valid will.
Where there are no heirs, the decedent’s property escheats to the state.
An executor (or executrix) is the person named in the will to administer the estate and render a final accounting.
Estate and inheritance taxes may be owed if the estate is large enough.
EXERCISES 1.
Donald Trump is married to Ivanna Trump, but they divorce.
Donald neglects to change his will, which leaves everything to Ivanna.
If he were to die before remarrying, would the will still be valid?
2.
Tom Tyler, married to Tina Tyler, dies without a will.
If his legal state of residence is California, how will his estate be distributed?
(This will require a small amount of Internet browsing.)
3.
Suppose Tom Tyler is very wealthy.
When he dies at age sixty-three, there are two wills: one leaves everything to his wife and family, and the other leaves everything to his alma mater, the University of Colorado.
The family wishes to dispute the validity of the second (later in time) will.
What, in general, are the bases on which a will can be challenged so that it does not enter into probate?
14.2 Trusts LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Distinguish a will from a trust, and describe how a trust is created, how it functions, and how it may come to an end.
2.
Compare the various kinds of trusts, as well as factors that affect both estates and trusts.
Definitions When the legal title to certain property is held by one person while another has the use and benefit of it, a relationship known as a trust has been created.
The trust developed centuries ago to get around various nuances and complexities, including taxes, of English real property law.
The trustee has legal title and the beneficiary has “equitable title,” since the courts of equity Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 508  would enforce the obligations of the trustee to honor the terms by which the property was conveyed to him.
A typical trust might provide for the trustee to manage an estate for the grantor’s children, paying out income to the children until they are, say, twenty-one, at which time they would become legal owners of the property.
Trusts may be created by bequest in a will, by agreement of the parties, or by a court decree.
However created, the trust is governed by a set of rules that grew out of the courts of equity.
Every trust involves specific property, known as the res (rees; Latin for “thing”), and three parties, though the parties may be the same person.
Settlor or Grantor Anyone who has legal capacity to make a contract may create a trust.
The creator is known as the settlor or grantor.
Trusts are created for many reasons; for example, so that a minor can have the use of assets without being able to dissipate them or so that a person can have a professional manage his money.
Trustee The trustee is the person or legal entity that holds the legal title to the res.
Banks do considerable business as trustees.
If the settlor should neglect to name a trustee, the court may name one.
The trustee is a fiduciary of the trust beneficiary and will be held to the highest standard of loyalty.
Not even an appearance of impropriety toward the trust property will be permitted.
Thus a trustee may not loan trust property to friends, to a corporation of which he is a principal, or to himself, even if he is scrupulous to account for every penny and pays the principal back with interest.
The trustee must act prudently in administering the trust.
Beneficiary The beneficiary is the person, institution, or other thing for which the trust has been created.
Beneficiaries are not limited to one’s children or close friends; an institution, a corporation, or some other organization, such as a charity, can be a beneficiary of a trust, as can one’s pet dogs, cats, and the like.
The beneficiary may usually sell or otherwise dispose of his interest in a trust, and that interest likewise can usually be reached by creditors.
Note that the settlor may create a trust of which he is the beneficiary, just as he may create a trust of which he is the trustee.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 509  Continental Bank & Trust Co. v. Country Club Mobile Estates, Ltd., (see Section 14.4.2 "Settlor’s Limited Power over the Trust"), considers a basic element of trust law: the settlor’s power over the property once he has created the trust.
Express Trusts Trusts are divided into two main categories: express and implied.
Express trusts includetestamentary trusts and inter vivos (or living) trusts.
The testamentary trust is one created by will.
It becomes effective on the testator’s death.
The inter vivos trust is one created during the lifetime of the grantor.
It can be revocable or irrevocable (seeFigure 14.3 "Express Trusts").
Figure 14.3 Express Trusts A revocable trust is one that the settlor can terminate at his option.
On termination, legal title to the trust assets returns to the settlor.
Because the settlor can reassert control over the assets whenever he wishes, the income they generate is taxed to him.
By contrast, an irrevocable trust is permanent, and the settlor may not revoke or modify its terms.
All income to the trust must be accumulated in the trust or be paid to the beneficiaries in accordance with the trust agreement.
Because income does not go to the settlor, the irrevocable trust has important income tax advantages, even though it means permanent loss of control over Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 510  the assets (beyond the instructions for its use and disposition that the settlor may lay out in the trust agreement).
A hybrid form is the reversionary trust: until the end of a fixed period, the trust is irrevocable and the settlor may not modify its terms, but thereafter the trust assets revert to the settlor.
The reversionary trust combines tax advantages with ultimate possession of the assets.
Of the possible types of express trusts, five are worth examining briefly: (1) Totten trusts, (2), blind trusts, (3) Clifford trusts, (4) charitable trusts, and (5) spendthrift trusts.
The use of express trusts in business will also be noted.
Totten Trust The Totten trust, which gets its name from a New York case, In re Totten, [1] is a tentative trust created when someone deposits funds in a bank as trustee for another person as beneficiary.
(Usually, the account will be named in the following form: “Mary, in trust for Ed.”) During the beneficiary’s lifetime, the grantor-depositor may withdraw funds at his discretion or revoke the trust altogether.
But if the grantor-depositor dies before the beneficiary and had not revoked the trust, then the beneficiary is entitled to whatever remains in the account at the time of the depositor’s death.
Blind Trust In a blind trust, the grantor transfers assets—usually stocks and bonds—to trustees who hold and manage them for the grantor as beneficiary.
The trustees are not permitted to tell the grantor how they are managing the portfolio.
The blind trust is used by high government officials who are required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to put their assets in blind trusts or abstain from making decisions that affect any companies in which they have a financial stake.
Once the trust is created, the grantor-beneficiary is forbidden from discussing financial matters with the trustees or even to give the trustees advice.
All that the grantor-beneficiary sees is a quarterly statement indicating by how much the trust net worth has increased or decreased.
Clifford Trust The Clifford trust, named after the settlor in a Supreme Court case, Helvering v. Clifford, [2] is reversionary: the grantor establishes a trust irrevocable for at least ten years and a day.
By so doing, the grantor shifts the tax burden to the beneficiary.
So a person in a higher bracket can Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 511  save considerable money by establishing a Clifford trust to benefit, say, his or her children.
The tax savings will apply as long as the income from the trust is not devoted to needs of the children that the grantor is legally required to supply.
At the expiration of the express period in the trust, legal title to the res reverts to the grantor.
However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed the tax advantages for Clifford trusts established after March 1986.
As a result, all income from such trusts is taxed to the grantor.
Existing Clifford trusts were not affected by the 1986 tax law.
Charitable Trust A charitable trust is one devoted to any public purpose.
The definition is broad; it can encompass funds for research to conquer disease, to aid battered wives, to add to museum collections, or to permit a group to proselytize on behalf of a particular political or religious doctrine.
The law in all states recognizes the benefits to be derived from encouraging charitable trusts, and states use the cy pres (see press; “as near as possible”) doctrine to further the intent of the grantor.
The most common type of trust is the charitable remainder trust.
You would donate property—usually intangible property such as stock—in trust to an approved charitable organization, usually one that has tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status from the IRS.
The organization serves as trustee during your life and provides you or someone you designate with a specified level of income from the property that you donated.
This could be for a number of years or for your lifetime.
After your death or the period that you set, the trust ends and the charitable organization owns the assets that were in the trust.
There are important tax reasons why people set up charitable trusts.
The trustor gets five years' worth of tax deductions for the value of the assets in the charitable trust.
Capital gains are treated favorably, as well: charitable trusts are irrevocable, which means that the person setting up the trust (the “trustor”) permanently gives up control of the assets to the charitable organization.
Thus, the charitable organization could sell an asset in the trust that would ordinarily incur significant capital gains taxes, but since the trustor no longer owns the asset, there is no capital gains tax: as a tax-exempt organization, the charity will not pay capital gains, either.
Spendthrift Trust Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 512  A spendthrift trust is established when the settlor believes that the beneficiary is not to be trusted with whatever rights she might possess to assign the income or assets of the trust.
By express provision in a trust instrument, the settlor may ensure that the trustees are legally obligated to pay only income to the beneficiary; no assignment of the assets may be made, either voluntarily by the beneficiary or involuntarily by operation of law.
Hence the spendthrift beneficiary cannot gamble away the trust assets nor can they be reached by creditors to pay her gambling (or other) debts.
Express Trusts in Business In addition to their use in estate planning, express trusts are also created for business purposes.
The business trust was popular late in the nineteenth century as a way of getting around state limitations on the corporate form and is still used today.
By giving their shares to a voting trust, shareholders can ensure that their agreement to vote as a bloc will be carried out.
But voting trusts can be dangerous.
Agreements that result in price fixing or other restraints of trade violate the antitrust laws; for example, companies are in violation when they act collusively to fix prices by pooling voting stock under a trust agreement, as happened frequently at the turn of the century.
Implied Trusts Trusts can be created by courts without any intent by a settlor to do so.
For various reasons, a court will declare that particular property is to be held by its owner in trust for someone else.
Such trusts are implied trusts and are usually divided into two types:constructive trusts and resulting trusts.
A constructive trust is one created usually to redress a fraud or to prevent unjust enrichment.
Suppose you give $1 to an agent to purchase a lottery ticket for you, but the agent buys the ticket in his own name instead and wins $1,000,000, payable into an account in amounts of $50,000 per year for twenty years.
Since the agent had violated his fiduciary obligation and unjustly enriched himself, the court would impose a constructive trust on the account, and the agent would find himself holding the funds as trustee for you as beneficiary.
By contrast, a resulting trust is one imposed to carry out the supposed intent of the parties.
You give an agent $100,000 to purchase a house for you.
Title is put in your agent’s name at the closing, although it is clear that since she was paid for her Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 513  services, you did not intend to give the house to her as a gift.
The court would declare that the house was to be held by the agent as trustee for you during the time that it takes to have the title put in your name.
KEY TAKEAWAY A trust can be created during the life of the settlor of the trust.
A named trustee and beneficiary are required, as well as some assets that the trustee will administer.
The trustee has a fiduciary duty to administer the trust with the utmost care.
Inter vivos trusts can be revocable or irrevocable.
Testamentary trusts are, by definition, not revocable, as they take effect on the death of the settlor.

14.3 Factors Affecting Estates and Trusts LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 514  1.
Know how principal and income are distinguished in administering a trust.
2.
Explain how estates and trusts are taxed, and the utility of powers of appointment.
Principal and Income Often, one person is to receive income from a trust or an estate and another person, the remainderman, is to receive the remaining property when the trust or estate is terminated.
In thirty-six states, a uniform act, the Uniform Principal and Income Act (UPIA), defines principal and income and specifies how expenses are to be paid.
If the trust agreement expressly gives the trustee power to determine what is income and what is principal, then his decision is usually unreviewable.
If the agreement is silent, the trustee is bound by the provisions of the UPIA.
The general rule is that ordinary receipts are income, whereas extraordinary receipts are additions to principal.
Ordinary receipts are defined as the return of money or property derived from the use of the principal, including rent, interest, and cash dividends.
Extraordinary receipts include stock dividends, revenues or other proceeds from the sale or exchange of trust assets, proceeds from insurance on assets, all income accrued at the testator’s death, proceeds from the sale or redemption of bonds, and awards or judgments received in satisfaction of injuries to the trust property.
Expenses or obligations incurred in producing or preserving income—including ordinary repairs and ordinary taxes—are chargeable to income.
Expenses incurred in making permanent improvements to the property, in investing the assets, and in selling or purchasing trust property are chargeable to principal, as are all obligations incurred before the decedent’s death.
Taxation Estates and trusts are taxable entities under the federal income tax statute.
The general rule is that all income paid out to the beneficiaries is taxable to the beneficiaries and may be deducted from the trust’s or estate’s gross income in arriving at its net taxable income.
The trust or estate is then taxed on the balance left over—that is, on any amounts accumulated.
This is known as the conduit rule, because the trust or estate is seen as a conduit for the income.
Power of Appointment A power of appointment is the authority given by one person (the donor) to another (the donee) to dispose of the donor’s property according to whatever instructions the donor provides.
A Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 515  power of appointment can be created in a will, in a trust, or in some other writing.
The writing may imply the power of appointment rather than specifically calling it a power of appointment.
For example, a devise or bequest of property to a person that allows that person to receive it or transfer it gives that person a power of appointment.
The person giving the power is the donor, and the person receiving it is the donee.
There are three classes of powers of appointment.
General powers of appointment give donees the power to dispose of the property in any way they see fit.
Limited powers of appointment, also known as special powers of appointment, give donees the power to transfer the property to a specified class of persons identified in the instrument creating the power.
Testamentary powers of appointment are powers of appointment that typically are created by wills.
If properly used, the power of appointment is an important tool, because it permits the donee to react flexibly to circumstances that the donor could not have foreseen.
Suppose you desire to benefit your children when they are thirty-five or forty according to whether they are wealthy or poor.
The poorer children will be given more from the estate or trust than the wealthier ones.
Since you will not know when you write the will or establish the trust which children will be poorer, a donee with a power of appointment will be able to make judgments impossible for the donor to make years or decades before.
KEY TAKEAWAY Administering either an estate or a trust requires knowing the distinction between principal and income in a variety of situations.
For example, knowing which receipts are ordinary and which are extraordinary is essential to knowing whether to allocate the receipts as income or as an addition to principal.
Knowing which expenses are chargeable to principal and which are chargeable to income is also important.
Both estates and trusts are taxable entities, subject to federal and state laws on estate and trust taxation.
Powers of appointment can be used in both trusts and estates in order to give flexibility to named donees.
EXERCISES 1.
In his will, Hagrid leaves his pet dragon, Norberta, to Ron Weasley as donee with power of appointment.
He intends to restrict Ron’s power as donee to give or sell Norberta only to wizards or witches.

14.4 Cases Testamentary Capacity Estate of Seymour M. Rosen Supreme Judicial Court of Maine 447 A.2d 1220 (1982) GODFREY, JUSTICE Phoebe Rosen and Jeffrey Rosen, widow and son of the decedent, Seymour M. Rosen, appeal from an order of the Knox County Probate Court admitting the decedent’s will to probate.
Appellants argue that the decedent lacked the testamentary capacity necessary to execute a valid will and that the Probate Court’s finding that he did have the necessary capacity is clearly erroneous.
On direct appeal from the Probate Court pursuant to section 1-308 of the Probate Code (18-A M.R.S.A.
§ 1-308), this Court reviews for clear error the findings of fact by the Probate Court.
Estate of Mitchell, Me., 443 A.2d 961 (1982).
We affirm the judgment.
Decedent, a certified public accountant, had an accounting practice in New York City, where he had been married to Phoebe for about thirty years.
Their son, Jeffrey, works in New York City.
In 1973, the decedent was diagnosed as having chronic lymphatic leukemia, a disease that, as it progresses, seriously impairs the body’s ability to fight infection.
From 1973 on, he understood that he might die within six months.
In June, 1978, he left his home and practice and moved to Maine with his secretary of two months, Robin Gordon, the appellee.
He set up an accounting practice in Camden.
The leukemia progressed.
The decedent was on medication and was periodically hospitalized for infections, sometimes involving septic shock, a condition described by the treating physician as Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 517  akin to blood poisoning.
The infections were treated with antibiotics with varying degrees of success.
Despite his medical problems, the decedent continued his accounting practice, working usually three days a week, until about two months before his death on December 4, 1980.
Robin Gordon lived with him and attended him until his death.
While living in New York, the decedent had executed a will leaving everything to his wife or, if she should not survive him, to his son.
In November, 1979, decedent employed the services of Steven Peterson, a lawyer whose office was in the same building as decedent’s, to execute a codicil to the New York will leaving all his Maine property to Robin.
At about this time, decedent negotiated a property settlement with his wife, who is now living in Florida.
He executed the will at issue in this proceeding on July 25, 1980, shortly after a stay in the hospital with a number of infections, and shortly before a hospitalization that marked the beginning of the decedent’s final decline.
This will, which revoked all earlier wills and codicils, left all his property, wherever located, to Robin, or to Jeffrey if Robin did not survive him.
The court admitted the 1980 will to probate over the objections of Phoebe and son, making extensive findings to support its conclusion that “the decedent clearly had testamentary capacity when he executed his Will.” The Probate Court applied the standard heretofore declared by this Court for determining whether a decedent had the mental competence necessary to execute a valid will: A ‘disposing mind’ involves the exercise of so much mind and memory as would enable a person to transact common and simple kinds of business with that intelligence which belongs to the weakest class of sound minds; and a disposing memory exists when one can recall the general nature, condition and extent of his property, and his relations to those to whom he gives, and also to those from whom he excludes, his bounty.
He must have active memory enough to bring to his mind the nature and particulars of the business to be transacted, and mental power enough to appreciate them, and act with sense and judgment in regard to them.
He must have sufficient capacity to comprehend the condition of his property, his relations to the persons who were or should have been the objects of his bounty, and the scope and bearing of the provisions of his will.
He must have sufficient active memory to collect in his mind, without prompting, the particulars or elements of the business to be transacted, and to hold them in his mind a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 518  sufficient length of time to perceive at least their obvious relations to each other, and be able to form some rational judgment in relation to them.
In re Leonard, Me., 321 A.2d 486, 488-89 (1974), quoting Hall v. Perry, 87 Me.
569, 572, 33 A.
160, 161 (1895).
Appellants portray the decedent as “a man ravaged by cancer and dulled by medication,” and it is true that some evidence in the record tends to support this characterization.
However, the law as set out in In re Leonard requires only a modest level of competence (“the weakest class of sound minds”), and there is considerable evidence of record that the decedent had at least that level of mental ability and probably more: 1.
The three women who witnessed the will all testified that decedent was of sound mind.
They worked in the same building as the decedent, knew him, and saw him regularly.
Such testimony is admissible to show testamentary capacity.
In re Leonard, 321 A.2d at 489.
2.
Lawyer Peterson, who saw the decedent daily, testified that he was of sound mind.
Peterson used the decedent as a tax adviser, and the decedent did accounting work for Peterson’s clients.
Peterson had confidence in the decedent’s tax abilities and left the tax aspects of the will to the decedent’s own consideration.
3.
Dr. Weaver, the treating physician, testified that although the decedent would be mentally deadened for a day or two while in shock in the hospital, he would then regain “normal mental function.” Though on medication, the decedent was able to conduct his business until soon before his death.
Dr. Weaver testified without objection that on one occasion he had offered a written opinion that the decedent was of sound mind.
Appellants’ principal objection to the will is that the decedent lacked the necessary knowledge of “the general nature, condition and extent of his property.” In re Leonard, 321 A.2d at 488.
The record contains testimony of Robin Gordon and lawyer Peterson that decedent did not know what his assets were or their value.
However, there is other evidence, chiefly Peterson’s testimony about his discussions with the decedent preliminary to the drafting of the 1980 will and, earlier, when the 1979 codicil to the New York will was being prepared, that the decedent did have knowledge of the contents of his estate.
He knew that he had had a Florida condominium, although he was unsure whether this had been turned over to his wife as part of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 519  the recent property settlement; he knew that he had an interest in an oil partnership, and, although he was unable to place a value on that interest, he knew the name of an individual who could supply further information about it; he knew he had stocks and bonds, two motor vehicles, an account at the Camden National Bank, and accounts receivable from his accounting practice.
The law does not require that a testator’s knowledge of his estate be highly specific in order for him to execute a valid will.
It requires only that the decedent be able to recall “the general nature, condition and extent of his property.” In re Leonard, 321 A.2d at 488.
Such knowledge of one’s property is an aspect of mental soundness, not an independent legal requirement as the appellants seem to suggest.
Here, there was competent evidence that the decedent had a general knowledge of his estate.
The Probate Court was justified in concluding that, in the circumstances, the decedent’s ignorance of the precise extent of his property did not establish his mental incompetence.
The decedent’s uncertainty about his property was understandable in view of the fact that some of his property had been transferred to his wife in the recent property negotiations in circumstances rendering it possible that the decedent might have wanted to put the matter out of his mind.
Also, there was evidence from which the court could have inferred that much of the property was of uncertain or changing value.
On the evidence of record, this Court cannot hold that the findings of the Probate Court were clearly erroneous.
Where, as here, there is a choice between two permissible views of the weight of the evidence, the findings of the Probate Court must stand.

Settlor’s Limited Power over the Trust Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 520  Continental Bank & Trust Co. v. Country Club Mobile Estates, Ltd. 632 P.2d 869 (Utah 1981) Oaks, Justice The issue in this appeal is whether a settlor who has created a trust by conveying property that is subject to an option to sell can thereafter extend the period of the option without the participation or consent of the trustee.
We hold that he cannot.
For ease of reference, this opinion will refer to the plaintiff-appellant, Continental Bank & Trust Co., as the “trustee,” to defendant-respondent, Country Club Mobile Estates, Ltd., as the “lessee-optionee,” and to Marshall E. Huffaker, deceased, as the “settlor.” The sequence of events is critical.
On September 29, 1965, the settlor gave the lessee-optionee a fifty-year lease and an option to purchase, during the sixth year of the lease, the 31 acres of land at issue in this litigation.
On March 1, 1971, the settlor granted the lessee-optionee a five-year extension of its option, to September 29, 1976.
On December 6, 1973, the settlor conveyed the subject property to the trustee in trust for various members of his family, signing a trust agreement and conveying the property to the trustee by a warranty deed, which was promptly recorded.
The lessee-optionee had actual as well as constructive notice of the creation of this trust by at least April, 1975, when it began making its monthly lease payments directly to the trustee.
On March 1, 1976, the settlor signed an instrument purporting to grant the lessee- optionee another five-year extension of its option, to September 29, 1981.
The trustee was unaware of this action and did not participate in it.
On October 30, 1978, approximately one week after the settlor’s death, the trustee learned of the March 1, 1976, attempted extension and demanded and obtained a copy of the instrument.
On July 3, 1979, the trustee brought this action against the lessee-optionee and other interested parties to quiet title to the 31 acres of trust property and to determine the validity of the attempted extension of the option.
Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of the validity of the extended option.
The district court denied the trustee’s motion and granted the lessee-optionee’s motion, and the trustee appealed.
We reverse.
A settlor admittedly could reserve power to extend the duration of an option on trust property, and do so without the consent or involvement of the trustee.
The question is whether this settlor Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 521  did so.
The issue turns on the terms of the trust instrument, which, in this case, gave the trustee broad powers, including the power to grant options, but also reserved to the settlor the right to revoke the trust or to direct the trustee to sell trust property.
The relevant clauses are as follows: ARTICLE IV.
To carry out the Trust purposes of the Trust created hereby…the Trustee is vested with the following powers…: B.
To manage, control, sell, convey…; to grant options… K.…The enumeration of certain powers of the Trustee herein shall not be construed as a limitation of the Trustee’s power, it being intended that the Trustee shall have all rights, powers and privileges that an absolute owner of the property would have.
ARTICLE V. The Trustor by an instrument in writing filed with the Trustee may modify, alter or revoke this Agreement in whole or in part, and may withdraw any property subject to the agreement;… There is hereby reserved to the Trustor the power to direct the trustee, in writing, from time to time, to retain, sell, exchange or lease any property of the trust estate.…Upon receipt of such directions, the Trustee shall comply therewith.
The lessee-optionee argues, and the district court held, that in the foregoing provisions of the trust agreement the settlor reserved the power to direct the trustee in regard to the leased property, and that the effect of his executing the extension of the option on March 1, 1976, was to direct the trustee to sell the property to the lessee-optionee upon its exercise of the option.
We disagree.
We are unable to find an exercise of the “power to direct the trustee, in writing,” in an act that was not intended to communicate and did not in fact communicate anything to the trustee.
We are likewise unable to construe the extension agreement signed by the settlor and the lessee-optionee as “an instrument in writing filed with the Trustee” to “modify, alter or revoke this Agreement.…” Nor can we agree with the dissent’s argument for “liberal construction…to the reserved powers of a settlor” in a trust agreement which expressly vests the trustee with the power “to grant options” and explicitly states its intention that the trustee “shall have all rights, powers and privileges that an absolute owner of the property would have.” Article IV, quoted above.
(emphases in original) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 522  A trust is a form of ownership in which the legal title to property is vested in a trustee, who has equitable duties to hold and manage it for the benefit of the beneficiaries.Restatement of Trusts, Second, § 2 (1959).
It is therefore axiomatic in trust law that the trustee under a valid trust deed has exclusive control of the trust property, subject only to the limitations imposed by law or the trust instrument, and that once the settlor has created the trust he is no longer the owner of the trust property and has only such ability to deal with it as is expressly reserved to him in the trust instrument.
Boone v. Davis, 64 Miss.
133, 8 So.
202 (1886); Marvin v. Smith, 46 N.Y. 571 (1871).
As stated in Bogert,Trusts & Trustees, §42 (2d ed.
1965): After a settlor has completed the creation of a trust he is, with small exceptions noted below, and except as expressly provided otherwise by the trust instrument or by statute, not in any legal relationship with the beneficiaries or the trustee, and has no liabilities or powers with regard to the trust administration.
None of the exceptions identified by Bogert applies in this case.
This is a case where a settlor created a trust and then chose to ignore it.
He could have modified or revoked the trust, or directed the trustee in writing to sell or lease the trust property, but he took neither of these actions.
Instead, more than two years after the creation and recording of the trust, and without any direction or notice to the trustee, the settlor gave the lessee-optionee a signed instrument purporting to extend its option to buy the trust property for another five years.
The trustee did not learn of this instrument until two and one-half years later, immediately following the death of the settlor.
An extension of the option to buy would obviously have a limiting effect on the value of the reversion owned by the trust (and thus on the rights of the trust beneficiaries), which the trustee has a duty to protect.
Even a revocable trust clothes beneficiaries, for the duration of the trust, with a legally enforceable right to insist that the terms of the trust be adhered to.
If we gave legal effect to the settlor’s extension of this option in contravention of the existence and terms of the trust, we would prejudice the interests of the beneficiaries, blur some fundamental principles of trust law, and cast doubt upon whether it is the trustee or the settlor who is empowered to manage and dispose of the trust property in a valid revocable trust.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 523  The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiff.
Costs to appellant.
HOWE, Justice: (Dissenting) I dissent.
The majority opinion has overlooked the cardinal principle of construction of a trust agreement which is that the settlor’s intent should be followed.
See Leggroan v. Zion’s Savings Bank & Trust Co., 120 Utah 93, 232 P.2d 746 (1951).
Instead, the majority places a strict and rigid interpretation on the language of the trust agreement which defeats the settlor’s intent and denies him an important power he specifically reserved to himself.
All of this is done in a fact situation where there is no adverse interest asserted and no one will be prejudiced in any way by following the undisputed and obvious intent of the settlor.
Unlike the situation found with many trusts, Huffaker in establishing his trust reserved to himself broad powers in Article V.: ARTICLE V. The Trustor by an instrument in writing filed with the Trustee may modify, alter or revoke this Agreement in whole or in part, and may withdraw any property subject to the Agreement; Provided, however, that the duties, powers and limitations of the Trustee shall not be substantially changed without its written consent, except as to revocation or withdrawal.
(emphasis added) * * * * There is hereby reserved to the Trustor the power to direct the trustee, in writing, from time to time, to retain, sell, exchange or lease any property of the Trust estate, to invest Trust funds, or to purchase for the Trust any property which they [sic] may designate and which is acceptable to the Trustee.
Upon receipt of such directions, the Trustee shall comply therewith.
(emphasis added) Thus while Huffaker committed the property into the management and control of the trustee, he retained the right in Article V. to direct the trustee from time to time with regard to the property, and the trustee agreed that upon receipt of any such directions it would comply.
It is significant that the consent of the trustee was not required.
These broad reserved powers in effect gave him greater power over the property than the trustee possessed since he had the final word.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 524  The property in question was subject to defendant’s option when it was placed in trust.
The trustee took title subject to that option and subject to future directions from Huffaker.
The extension granted by Huffaker to the defendant was in effect a directive that the trustee sell the property to the defendant if and when it elected to purchase the property.
At that time, the defendant could deliver the directive to the trustee which held legal title and the sale could be consummated.
Contrary to what is said in the majority opinion, the extension was intended to communicate and did communicate to the trustee the settlor’s intention to sell to the defendant.
The trustee does not claim to have any doubt as to what the settlor intended.
There was no requirement in the trust agreement as to when the directive to sell had to be delivered to the trustee nor was there any requirement that the settlor must himself deliver the direction to sell to the trustee rather than the buyer deliver it.
The majority opinion concedes that Huffaker had the power to extend the option but denies him that power because he did not communicate his intention to exercise that power to the trustee at the time he extended the option.
It ignores the fact that the lessee had five years to decide whether it wanted to buy the property, at which time it could deliver the direction to sell to the trustee.
The majority opinion reads into the trust agreement rigidity and strictness which is unwarranted.
The majority opinion contains a quote from Bogert, Trust and Trustees, § 42, for authority that after a settlor has completed the creation of a trust he is not in any legal relationship with the beneficiaries or the trustee, and has no liabilities or power with regard to the trust administration.
However, as will be seen in that quote, it is there recognized that those rules do not apply where it has been expressly provided otherwise by the trust instrument.
Such is the case here where the settlor reserved extensive powers and was himself the primary beneficiary.
Huffaker’s extension agreement apparently would not have been challenged by his trustee if he had given written directions to the trustee to extend the option instead of executing the extension with the defendant himself, and apparently would not have been challenged had he not died.
Yet, although the trustee did not itself extend the option nor receive a copy of the agreement until after Huffaker’s death, it had not in the meantime dealt with third parties concerning the property or made any commitments that were inconsistent with Huffaker’s action.
Since there were no intervening third-party rights and it is not unfair to the trust Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 525  beneficiaries to require them to abide by the intention of their donor and benefactor, I see no justification for the refusal of the trustee to accept the extension agreement as a valid direction to sell the property as provided for by the terms of the trust.
This is not a case where the trustee in ignorance of the action of the settlor in granting an option had also granted an option or dealt with the property in a manner inconsistent with the actions of the settlor so that there are conflicting claims of innocent third-parties presented.
In such a case there would be some justification for applying a strict construction so that there can be orderliness in trust administration.
After all, the reason for the provisions of the trust agreement defining the powers of the trustee and the reserved powers of the settlor was to provide for the exercise of those powers in a manner that would be orderly and without collision between the trustee and settlor.
In the instant case the trustee has not even suggested how it will be prejudiced by following Huffaker’s directions.
The majority opinion makes reference to protecting the interest of the contingent beneficiaries but overlooks that Huffaker was not only the settlor but also the primary beneficiary both when the trust was established and when the option was extended.
The majority opinion treats the relationship between Huffaker and his trustee as an adversary relationship instead of recognizing that the trustee was Huffaker’s fiduciary to assist him in managing his property.
Therefore, there is no reason to construe the trust agreement as if it were meant to deal with a relationship between two adverse parties.
My view that a liberal construction should be given to the reserved powers of a settlor under these circumstances finds support in a decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Trager v. Schwartz, 345 Mass.
653, 189 N.E.2d 509 (1963).
There the settlor on July 15, 1942, executed as donor a declaration of trust.
The property was 65 shares of stock and 4 lots of land.
In that instrument he reserved the right to alter, amend or revoke the instrument in whole or in part.
However, it was specifically provided in the declaration of trust that “any such alterations, amendments or revocations of this trust shall be by an instrument in writing signed by the donor, and shall become effective only upon being recorded in the South District Registry of Deeds for Middlesex County.” Later, on February 4, 1954, the trustor executed a document entitled “Modification and Amendment of Trust” whereby he withdrew the 65 shares of stock from the trust and sold them Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 526  to his son and told him that he had arranged for the recording of that instrument by his lawyer.
However, he did not record the document nor instruct his attorney to do so.
On August 25, 1960, the settlor executed a document entitled “Revocation of Declaration of Trust,” in which he revoked in whole the declaration of trust of July 15, 1942.
This revocation was recorded on August 26th.
He thereupon directed the trustees to deliver to him the 65 shares of stock and the 4 lots of real estate.
His son received notice of the revocation on August 30, 1960, and recorded the following day the modification and amendment dated February 4, 1954, by which he had obtained the 165 shares of stock.
In a suit brought by the settlor to regain ownership of the stock, he contended that the recording of his complete revocation on August 26, 1960, rendered ineffective the recording of the partial revocation on August 31, 1960.
He relied upon the principle that “A valid trust once created cannot be revoked or altered except by the exercise of a reserve power to do so, which must be exercised in strict conformity to its terms.” The court upheld the earlier sale of stock stating: The provision of the declaration of trust that amendments and revocations ‘shall become effective only upon being recorded’ shall not be interpreted, where there are no intervening rights of third-parties, as preventing the carrying out of the earlier amendment once it has been recorded.
This should be the result, particularly where there was an express undertaking by one of the parties to see to the recording.
In the instant case, defendant will be greatly prejudiced, and the settlor’s intention thwarted, as a result of following the majority opinion’s interpretation of the trust terms as they relate to a written direction to the trustee to sell trust property.
Defendant gave up the opportunity to purchase the property within the original option period in reliance on Huffaker’s execution of the extension agreement, a document prepared by his attorney.
I am not persuaded that because defendant was making its rental payments to the trustee it was unreasonable in obtaining the extension of the option, which previously had been granted it by Huffaker, to again deal with him and rely on him since he was the final power respecting his property, and since neither he nor his attorney who had full and complete knowledge of the trust apparently raised any question as to the propriety of what they were doing.
Just as the settlor in Trager v. Schwartz, supra, was not permitted to gain advantage by his failure to record as required by the trust Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 527  agreement, I think the settlor’s beneficiaries in the instant case should not gain by Huffaker’s omissions and to the extreme prejudice of defendant.
The trustee has based its arguments on cases and principles that are distinguishable or inapplicable to the instant case.
It regards the trust agreement as expressly allowing only it, as trustee and holder of the legal title to the property, to sell, option, or otherwise dispose of it.
But the language of the trust regarding powers retained by Huffaker is inclusive enough to encompass his action in this case, for he expressly retained the right to direct the plaintiff to sell the property, a right that is compatible with his granting of the option extension.
The trustee also asserts that the written instrument received after Huffaker’s death was ineffective as a directive to the trustee.
Plaintiff cites authority for the principle that a revocable trust can only be modified during the settlor’s lifetime, e.g., Chase National Bank of City of N.Y. v. Tomagno, 172 Misc.
63, 14 N.Y.S.2d 759 (1939).
We are not dealing with an attempted testamentary disposition in this case, however.
The option extension agreement was executed during Huffaker’s lifetime, and the fact that it was received by plaintiff only after he died does not deprive it of its effect.
I would affirm the judgment below.

14.5 Summary and Exercises Summary Estate planning is the process by which an owner decides how her property is to be passed on to others.
The four basic estate planning tools are wills, trusts, gifts, and joint ownership.
In this chapter, we examined wills and trusts.
A will is the declaration of a person’s wishes about the disposition of her assets on her death.
The law of each state sets forth certain formalities, such as the number of witnesses, to which written wills must adhere.
Wills are managed through the probate process, which varies from state to state, although many states have now adopted the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 528  Uniform Probate Code.
In general, anyone over eighteen and of sound mind may make a will.
It must be signed by the testator, and two or three others must witness the signature.
A will may always be modified or revoked during the testator’s lifetime, either expressly through a codicil or through certain actions, such as a subsequent marriage and the birth of children, not contemplated by the will.
Wills must be carefully drafted to avoid abatement and ademption.
The law provides for distribution in the case of intestacy.
The rules vary from state to state and depend on whether the decedent was married when she died, had children or parents who survived her, or had collateral heirs.
Once a will is admitted to probate, the personal representative must assemble and inventory all assets, have them appraised, handle claims against the estate, pay taxes, prepare a final accounting, and only then distribute the assets according to the will.
A trust is a relationship in which one person holds legal title to certain property and another person has the use and benefit of it.
The settlor or grantor creates the trust, giving specific property (the res) to the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiary.
Trusts may be living or testamentary, revocable or irrevocable.
Express trusts come in many forms, including Totten trusts, blind trusts, Clifford trusts, charitable trusts, and spendthrift trusts.
Trusts may also be imposed by law; constructive and resulting trusts are designed to redress frauds, prevent unjust enrichment, or see to it that the intent of the parties is carried out.

The basic types of insurance for property, liability, and life Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 531  3.
The basic defenses to claims against insurance companies by the insured: representation, concealment, and warranties We conclude our discussions about property with a focus on insurance law, not only because insurance is a means of compensating an owner for property losses but also because the insurance contract itself represents a property right.
In this chapter, we begin by examining regulation of the insurance industry.
We then look at legal issues relating to specific types of insurance.
Finally, we examine defenses that insurance companies might raise to avoid making payments under insurance policies.
15.1 Definitions and Types of Insurance LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Know the basic types of insurance for individuals.
2.
Name and describe the various kinds of business insurance.
Certain terms are usefully defined at the outset.
Insurance is a contract of reimbursement.
For example, it reimburses for losses from specified perils, such as fire, hurricane, and earthquake.
An insurer is the company or person who promises to reimburse.
The insured (sometimes called the assured) is the one who receives the payment, except in the case of life insurance, where payment goes to the beneficiary named in the life insurance contract.
The premium is the consideration paid by the insured—usually annually or semiannually—for the insurer’s promise to reimburse.
The contract itself is called the policy.
The events insured against are known as risks orperils.
Regulation of insurance is left mainly in the hands of state, rather than federal, authorities.
Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Congress exempted state-regulated insurance companies from the federal antitrust laws.
Every state now has an insurance department that oversees insurance rates, policy standards, reserves, and other aspects of the industry.
Over the years, these departments have come under fire in many states for being ineffective and “captives” of the industry.
Moreover, large insurers operate in all states, and both they and consumers must contend with fifty different state regulatory schemes that provide very different degrees of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 532  protection.
From time to time, attempts have been made to bring insurance under federal regulation, but none have been successful.
We begin with an overview of the types of insurance, from both a consumer and a business perspective.
Then we examine in greater detail the three most important types of insurance: property, liability, and life.
Public and Private Insurance Sometimes a distinction is made between public and private insurance.
Public (or social) insurance includes Social Security, Medicare, temporary disability insurance, and the like, funded through government plans.
Private insurance plans, by contrast, are all types of coverage offered by private corporations or organizations.
The focus of this chapter is private insurance.
Types of Insurance for the Individual Life Insurance Life insurance provides for your family or some other named beneficiaries on your death.
Two general types are available: term insurance provides coverage only during the term of the policy and pays off only on the insured’s death; whole-life insurance provides savings as well as insurance and can let the insured collect before death.
Health Insurance Health insurance covers the cost of hospitalization, visits to the doctor’s office, and prescription medicines.
The most useful policies, provided by many employers, are those that cover 100 percent of the costs of being hospitalized and 80 percent of the charges for medicine and a doctor’s services.
Usually, the policy will contain a deductible amount; the insurer will not make payments until after the deductible amount has been reached.
Twenty years ago, the deductible might have been the first $100 or $250 of charges; today, it is often much higher.
Disability Insurance A disability policy pays a certain percentage of an employee’s wages (or a fixed sum) weekly or monthly if the employee becomes unable to work through illness or an accident.
Premiums are lower for policies with longer waiting periods before payments must be made: a policy that begins to pay a disabled worker within thirty days might cost twice as much as one that defers payment for six months.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 533  Homeowner’s Insurance A homeowner’s policy provides insurance for damages or losses due to fire, theft, and other named perils.
No policy routinely covers all perils.
The homeowner must assess his needs by looking to the likely risks in his area—earthquake, hailstorm, flooding, and so on.
Homeowner’s policies provide for reduced coverage if the property is not insured for at least 80 percent of its replacement costs.
In inflationary times, this requirement means that the owner must adjust the policy limits upward each year or purchase a rider that automatically adjusts for inflation.
Where property values have dropped substantially, the owner of a home (or a commercial building) might find savings in lowering the policy’s insured amount.
Automobile Insurance Automobile insurance is perhaps the most commonly held type of insurance.
Automobile policies are required in at least minimum amounts in all states.
The typical automobile policy covers liability for bodily injury and property damage, medical payments, damage to or loss of the car itself, and attorneys’ fees in case of a lawsuit.
Other Liability Insurance In this litigious society, a person can be sued for just about anything: a slip on the walk, a harsh and untrue word spoken in anger, an accident on the ball field.
A personal liability policy covers many types of these risks and can give coverage in excess of that provided by homeowner’s and automobile insurance.
Such umbrella coverage is usually fairly inexpensive, perhaps $250 a year for $1 million in liability.
Types of Business Insurance Workers’ Compensation Almost every business in every state must insure against injury to workers on the job.
Some may do this through self-insurance—that is, by setting aside certain reserves for this contingency.
Most smaller businesses purchase workers’ compensation policies, available through commercial insurers, trade associations, or state funds.
Automobile Insurance Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 534  Any business that uses motor vehicles should maintain at least a minimum automobile insurance policy on the vehicles, covering personal injury, property damage, and general liability.
Property Insurance No business should take a chance of leaving unprotected its buildings, permanent fixtures, machinery, inventory, and the like.
Various property policies cover damage or loss to a company’s own property or to property of others stored on the premises.
Malpractice Insurance Professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and accountants will often purchase malpractice insurance to protect against claims made by disgruntled patients or clients.
For doctors, the cost of such insurance has been rising over the past thirty years, largely because of larger jury awards against physicians who are negligent in the practice of their profession.
Business Interruption Insurance Depending on the size of the business and its vulnerability to losses resulting from damage to essential operating equipment or other property, a company may wish to purchase insurance that will cover loss of earnings if the business operations are interrupted in some way—by a strike, loss of power, loss of raw material supply, and so on.
Liability Insurance Businesses face a host of risks that could result in substantial liabilities.
Many types of policies are available, including policies for owners, landlords, and tenants (covering liability incurred on the premises); for manufacturers and contractors (for liability incurred on all premises); for a company’s products and completed operations (for liability that results from warranties on products or injuries caused by products); for owners and contractors (protective liability for damages caused by independent contractors engaged by the insured); and for contractual liability (for failure to abide by performances required by specific contracts).
Some years ago, different types of individual and business coverage had to be purchased separately and often from different companies.
Today, most insurance is available on a package basis, through single policies that cover the most important risks.
These are often called multiperil policies.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 535  KEY TAKEAWAY Although insurance is a need for every US business, and many businesses operate in all fifty states, regulation of insurance has remained at the state level.
There are several forms of public insurance (Social Security, disability, Medicare) and many forms of private insurance.
Both individuals and businesses have significant needs for various types of insurance, to provide protection for health care, for their property, and for legal claims made against them by others.
EXERCISES 1.
Theresa Conley is joining the accounting firm of Hunter and Patton in Des Moines, Iowa.
She is a certified public accountant.
What kind of insurance will she (or the firm, on her behalf) need to buy because of her professional activities?
2.
Nate Johnson has just signed a franchise agreement with Papa Luigi’s Pizza and will be operating his own Papa Luigi’s store in Lubbock, Texas.
The franchise agreement requires that he personally contract for “all necessary insurance” for the successful operation of the franchise.
He expects to have twelve employees, five full-time and seven part-time (the delivery people), at his location, which will be on a busy boulevard in Lubbock and will offer take-out only.
Pizza delivery employees will be using their own automobiles to deliver orders.
What kinds of insurance will be “necessary”?
15.2 Property Insurance, Liability Insurance, and Life Insurance LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Distinguish and define the basic types of insurance for property, liability, and life.
2.
Explain the concepts of subrogation and assignment.
We turn now to a more detailed discussion of the law relating to the three most common types of insurance: property, liability, and life insurance.
Property Insurance It is sometimes said that property is the foundation for a system of free market capitalism.
If so, then protecting property is a necessary part of being part of that system, whether as an individual or as a business entity.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 536  Coverage As we have noted, property insurance provides coverage for real and personal property owned by a business or an individual.
Property insurance is also part of automobile policies covering damage to the car caused by an accident (collision coverage) or by other events such as vandalism or fire (comprehensive coverage).
Different levels of coverage are available.
For example, many basic homeowners’ policies cover damage resulting from the following types of perils only: fire and lightning, windstorm and hail, explosions, riots and civil commotions, aircraft and vehicular accidents, smoke, vandalism and malicious mischief, theft, and breakage of glass that is part of a building.
A broader policy, known as broad coverage, also includes these perils: falling objects; weight of ice, snow, and sleet; collapse of buildings; sudden and accidental damage to heating systems; accidental discharge from plumbing, heating, or air-conditioning systems; freezing of heating, plumbing, and air conditioning systems; and sudden and accidental injury from excess currents to electrical appliances and wiring.
Even with the broadest form of coverage, known as comprehensive, which covers all perils except for certain named exclusions, the homeowner can be left without protection.
For example, comprehensive policies do not usually cover damage resulting from flooding, earthquakes, war, or nuclear radiation.
The homeowner can purchase separate coverage for these perils but usually at a steep premium.
Insurable Interest in Property To purchase property insurance, the would-be insured must have aninsurable interest in the property.
Insurable interest is a real and substantial interest in specific property such that a loss to the insured would ensue if the property were damaged.
You could not, for instance, take out an insurance policy on a motel down the block with which you have no connection.
If a fire destroyed it, you would suffer no economic loss.
But if you helped finance the motel and had an investment interest in it, you would be permitted to place an insurance policy on it.
This requirement of an insurable interest stems from the public policy against wagering.
If you could insure anything, you would in effect be betting on an accident.
To insure property, therefore, you must have a legal interest and run the risk of a pecuniary loss.
Any legal interest is sufficient: a contractual right to purchase, for instance, or the right of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 537  possession (a bailee may insure).
This insurable interest must exist both at the time you take out the policy and at the time the loss occurs.
Moreover, coverage is limited to the extent of the interest.
As a mortgagee, you could ensure only for the amount still due.
Prior to the financial meltdown of 2008, many investment banks took insurance against possible losses from collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other financial products based on subprime loans.
The principal insurer was American International Group, Inc. (AIG), which needed a US government bailout when the risks covered by AIG turned out to be riskier than AIG’s models had projected.
Subrogation Figure 15.1 Subrogation Subrogation is the substitution of one person for another in pursuit of a legal claim.
When an insured is entitled to recover under a policy for property damage, the insurer is said to be subrogated to the insured’s right to sue any third party who caused the damage.
For example, a wrecking company negligently destroys an insured’s home, mistaking it for the building it was hired to tear down.
The insured has a cause of action against the wrecking company.
If the insured chooses instead to collect against a homeowner’s policy, the insurance company may sue the wrecking company in the insured’s place to recover the sum it was obligated to pay out under the policy (seeFigure 15.1 "Subrogation").
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 538  Assignment Assignment is the transfer of any property right to another.
In property insurance, a distinction is made between assignment of the coverage and assignment of the proceeds.
Ordinarily, the insured may not assign the policy itself without the insurer’s permission—that is, he may not commit the insurer to insure someone else.
But the insured may assign any claims against the insurer—for example, the proceeds not yet paid out on a claim for a house that has already burned down.
Intentional Losses Insurance is a means of spreading risk.
It is economically feasible because not every house burns down and not every car is stolen.
The number that do burn down or that are stolen can be calculated and the premium set accordingly.
Events that will certainly happen, like ordinary wear and tear and the destruction of property through deliberate acts such as arson, must be excluded from such calculations.
The injury must result from accidental, not deliberate, causes.
Coinsurance Clause Most commercial property policies contain a so-called coinsurance clause, which requires the insured to maintain insurance equal to a specified percentage of the property value.
It is often 80 percent but may be higher or lower.
If the property owner insures for less than that percentage, the recovery will be reduced.
In effect, the owner becomes a coinsurer with the insurance company.
The usual formula establishes the proportion that the insurer must pay by calculating the ratio of (1) the amount of insurance actually taken to (2) the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the total dollar value of the property.
Suppose a fire causes $160,000 damage to a plant worth $1,000,000.
The plant should have been insured for 80 percent ($800,000), but the insured took out only a $500,000 policy.
He will recover only $100,000.
To see why, multiply the total damages of $160,000 by the coinsurance proportion of five-eighths ($500,000 of insurance on the required minimum of $800,000).
Five-eighths of $160,000 equals $100,000, which would be the insured’s recovery where the policy has a coinsurance clause.
Liability Insurance Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 539  Liability insurance has taken on great importance for both individuals and businesses in contemporary society.
Liability insurance covers specific types of legal liabilities that a homeowner, driver, professional, business executive, or business itself might incur in the round of daily activities.
A business is always at risk in sending products into the marketplace.
Doctors, accountants, real estate brokers, insurance agents, and lawyers should obtain liability insurance to cover the risk of being sued for malpractice.
A prudent homeowner will acquire liability insurance as part of homeowner’s policy and a supplemental umbrella policy that insures for liability in excess of a limit of, say, $100,000 in the regular homeowner’s policy.
And businesses, professionals, and individuals typically acquire liability insurance for driving-related activities as part of their automobile insurance.
In all cases, liability policies cover not only any settlement or award that might ultimately have to be paid but also the cost of lawyers and related expenses in defending any claims.
Liability insurance is similar in several respects to property insurance and is often part of the same package policy.
As with property insurance, subrogation is allowed with liability insurance, but assignment of the policy is not allowed (unless permission of the insurer is obtained), and intentional losses are not covered.
For example, an accountant who willfully helps a client conceal fraud will not recover from his malpractice insurance policy if he is found guilty of participating in the fraud.
No-Fault Trends The major legal development of the century relating to liability insurance has been the elimination of liability in the two areas of greatest exposure: in the workplace and on the highway.
In the next unit on agency law, we discuss the no-fault system of workers’ compensation, under which a worker receives automatic benefits for workplace injuries and gives up the right to sue the employer under common-law theories of liability.
Here we will look briefly at the other major type of no-fault system: recovery for damages stemming from motor vehicle accidents.
“No-fault” means that recovery for damages in an accident no longer depends on who was at fault in causing it.
A motorist will file a claim to recover his actual damages (medical expenses, income loss) directly from his own insurer.
The no-fault system dispenses with the costly and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 540  uncertain tort system of having to prove negligence in court.
Many states have adopted one form or another of no-fault automobile insurance, but even in these states the car owner must still carry other insurance.
Some no-fault systems have a dollar “threshold” above which a victim may sue for medical expenses or other losses.
Other states use a “verbal threshold,” which permits suits for “serious” injury, defined variously as “disfigurement,” “fracture,” or “permanent disability.” These thresholds have prevented no-fault from working as efficiently as theory predicts.
Inflation has reduced the power of dollar thresholds (in some states as low as $200) to deter lawsuits, and the verbal thresholds have standards that can only be defined in court, so much litigation continues.
No state has adopted a “pure” no-fault system.
A pure no-fault system trades away entirely the right to sue in return for the prompt payment of “first-party” insurance benefits—that is, payment by the victim’s own insurance company instead of traditional “third-party” coverage, in which the victim collects from the defendant’s insurance company.
Among the criticisms of no-fault insurance is the argument that it fails to strengthen the central purpose of the tort system: to deter unsafe conduct that causes accidents.
No-fault lessens, it is said, the incentive to avoid accidents.
In any event, no-fault automobile insurance has been a major development in the insurance field since 1970 and seems destined to be a permanent fixture of insurance law.
Life Insurance Insurable Interest The two types of life insurance mentioned in Section 15.1.2 "Types of Insurance for the Individual", term and whole-life policies, are important both to individuals and to businesses (insurance for key employees).
As with property insurance, whoever takes out a life insurance policy on a person’s life must have an insurable interest.
Everyone has an insurable interest in his own life and may name whomever he pleases as beneficiary; the beneficiary need not have an insurable interest.
But the requirement of insurable interest restricts those who may take out insurance on someone else’s life.
A spouse or children have an insurable interest in a spouse or parent.
Likewise, a parent has an insurable interest in any minor child.
That means that a wife, for example, may take out a life insurance policy on her husband without his consent.
But she Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 541  could not take out a policy on a friend or neighbor.
As long as the insurable interest existed when the policy was taken out, the owner may recover when the insured dies, even if the insurable interest no longer exists.
Thus a divorced wife who was married when the policy was obtained may collect when her ex-husband dies as long as she maintained the payments.
Likewise, an employer has an insurable interest in his key employees and partners; such insurance policies help to pay off claims of a partner’s estate and thus prevent liquidation of the business.
Subrogation Unlike property insurance, life insurance does not permit subrogation.
The insurer must pay the claim when the insured dies and may not step into the shoes of anyone entitled to file a wrongful death claim against a person who caused the death.
Of course, if the insured died of natural causes, there would be no one to sue anyway.
Change of Beneficiary and Assignment Unless the insured reserves the right to change beneficiaries, his or her initial designation is irrevocable.
These days, however, most policies do reserve the right if certain formalities are observed, including written instructions to the insurer’s home office to make the change and endorsement of the policy.
The insured may assign the policy, but the beneficiary has priority to collect over the assignee if the right to change beneficiaries has not been reserved.
If the policy permits beneficiaries to be changed, then the assignee will have priority over the original beneficiary.
Intentional Losses Two types of intentional losses are especially important in life insurance: suicide and murder of the insured by the beneficiary.
Suicide In a majority of states, in the absence of a suicide clause in the policy, when an insured commits suicide, the insurer need not pay out if the policy is payable to the insured’s estate.
However, if the policy is payable to a third person (e.g., the insured’s company), payment will usually be allowed.
And if an insured kills himself while insane, all states require payment, whether to the estate or a third party.
Most life insurance policies today have a provision that explicitly excepts Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 542  suicide from coverage for a limited period, such as two years, after the policy is issued.
In other words, if the insured commits suicide within the first two years, the insurer will refund the premiums to his estate but will not pay the policy amount.
After two years, suicide is treated as any other death would be.
Murder Under the law in every state, a beneficiary who kills the insured in order to collect the life insurance is barred from receiving it.
But the invocation of that rule does not absolve the insurer of liability to pay the policy amount.
An alternate beneficiary must be found.
Sometimes the policy will name contingent beneficiaries, and many, but not all, states require the insurer to pay the contingent beneficiaries.
When there are no contingent beneficiaries or the state law prohibits paying them, the insurer will pay the insured’s estate.
Not every killing is murder; the critical question is whether the beneficiary intended his conduct to eliminate the insured in order to collect the insurance.
The willful, unlawful, and felonious killing of the insured by the person named as beneficiary in a life policy results in the forfeiture of all rights of such person therein.
It is unnecessary that there should be an express exception in the contract of insurance forbidding a recovery in favor of such a person in such an event.
On considerations of public policy, the death of the insured, willfully and intentionally caused by the beneficiary of the policy, is an excepted risk so far as the person thus causing the death is concerned.
KEY TAKEAWAY Many kinds of insurance are available for individuals and businesses.
For individuals, life insurance, homeowner’s insurance, and automobile insurance are common, with health insurance considered essential but often expensive.
Businesses with sufficient employees will obtain workers’ compensation insurance, property insurance, and liability insurance, and auto insurance for any employees driving company vehicles.
Insurance companies will often pay a claim for their insured and take over the insured’s claim against a third party.
Liability insurance is important for individuals, companies, and licensed professionals.
A trend toward no-fault in liability insurance is seen in claims for work-related injuries (workers’ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 543  compensation) and in automobile insurance.
Life insurance is common for most families and for businesses that want to protect against the loss of key employees.
EXERCISES 1.
Helen Caldicott raises a family and then begins a career as a caterer.
As her business grows, she hires several employees and rents space near downtown that has a retail space, parking, and a garage for the three vehicles that bear her business’s name.
What kinds of insurance does Helen need for her business?
2.
One of Helen’s employees, Bob Zeek, is driving to a catered event when another car fails to stop at a red light and severely injures Bob and nearly totals the van Bob was driving.
The police issue a ticket for careless and reckless driving to the other driver, who pleads guilty to the offense.
The other driver is insured, but Helen’s automobile insurance carrier goes ahead and pays for the damages to the company vehicle.
What will her insurance company likely do next?
3.
The health insurance provider for Helen’s employees pays over $345,000 of Bob’s medical and hospitalization bills.
What will Helen’s insurance company likely do next?
4.
Many homeowners live on floodplains but have homeowner’s insurance nonetheless.
Must insurance companies write such policies?
Do homeowners on floodplains pay more in premiums?
If insurance companies are convinced that global climate change is happening, with rising sea levels and stronger storms, can they simply avoid writing policies for homes and commercial buildings in coastal areas?
15.3 Insurer’s Defenses LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the principal defenses available to insurers when claims are made.
2.
Recognize that despite these defenses, insurance companies must act in good faith.
Types of Defenses It is a common perception that because insurance contracts are so complex, many insureds who believe they are covered end up with uninsured losses.
In other words, the large print giveth, and the small print taketh away.
This perception is founded, to some extent, on the use by Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 544  insurance companies of three common defenses, all of which relate to a duty of good faith on the part of the insured: (1) representation, (2) concealment, and (3) warranties.
Representation A representation is a statement made by someone seeking an insurance policy—for example, a statement that the applicant did (or did not) consult a doctor for any illness during the previous five years.
An insurer has grounds to avoid the contract if the applicant makes a false representation.
The misrepresentation must have been material; that is, a false description of a person’s hair coloring should not defeat a claim under an automobile accident policy.
But a false statement, even if innocent, about a material fact—for instance, that no one in the family uses the car to go to work, when unbeknownst to the applicant, his wife uses the car to commute to a part-time job she hasn’t told him about—will at the insurer’s option defeat a claim by the insured to collect under the policy.
The accident need not have arisen out of the misrepresentation to defeat the claim.
In the example given, the insurance company could refuse to pay a claim for any accident in the car, even one occurring when the car was driven by the husband to go to the movies, if the insurer discovered that the car was used in a manner in which the insured had declared it was not used.
This chapter’s case, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. v. JMR Electronics Corp., (see Section 15.4.1 "Misrepresentation to Insurer"), illustrates what happens when an insured misrepresents his smoking habits.
Concealment An insured is obligated to volunteer to the insurer all material facts that bear on insurability.
The failure of an insured to set forth such information is a concealment, which is, in effect, the mirror image of a false representation.
But the insured must have had a fraudulent intent to conceal the material facts.
For example, if the insured did not know that gasoline was stored in his basement, the insurer may not refuse to pay out on a fire insurance policy.
Warranties Many insurance policies covering commercial property will contain warranties.
For example, a policy may have a warranty that the insured bank has installed or will install a particular type of burglar alarm system.
Until recently, the rule was strictly enforced: any breach of a warranty voided the contract, even if the breach was not material.
A nonmaterial breach might be, for Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 545  example, that the bank obtained the alarm system from a manufacturer other than the one specified, even though the alarm systems are identical.
In recent years, courts or legislatures have relaxed the application of this rule.
But a material breach still remains absolute grounds for the insurer to avoid the contract and refuse to pay.
Incontestable Clause In life insurance cases, the three common defenses often are unavailable to the insurer because of the so-called incontestable clause.
This states that if the insured has not died during a specified period of time in which the life insurance policy has been in effect (usually two years), then the insurer may not refuse to pay even if it is later discovered that the insured committed fraud in applying for the policy.
Few nonlife policies contain an incontestable clause; it is used in life insurance because the effect on many families would be catastrophic if the insurer claimed misrepresentation or concealment that would be difficult to disprove years later when the insured himself would no longer be available to give testimony about his intentions or knowledge.
Requirement of Insurer’s Good Faith Like the insured, the insurer must act in good faith.
Thus defenses may be unavailable to an insurer who has waived them or acted in such a manner as to create an estoppel.
Suppose that when an insured seeks to increase the amount on his life insurance policy, the insurance company learns that he lied about his age on his original application.
Nevertheless, the company accepts his application for an increase.
The insured then dies, and the insurer refuses to pay his wife any sum.
A court would hold that the insurer had waived its right to object, since it could have cancelled the policy when it learned of the misrepresentation.
Finally, an insurer that acts in bad faith by denying a claim that it knows it should pay may find itself open to punitive damage liability.
KEY TAKEAWAY Some claims by insured parties can be legally denied by insurance companies where the insured has made a material misrepresentation.
Some claims can be legally denied if the insured has deliberately concealed important matters in applying for insurance coverage.
Because insurance coverage is by contract, courts often strictly construe the contract Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 546  language, and if the language does not cover the insured, the courts will typically not bend the language of the contract to help the insured.
EXERCISES 1.
Amir Labib gets a reduced rate from his auto insurance company because he represents in his application that he commutes less than ten miles a day to work.
Three years later, he and his wife buy a new residence, farther away from work, and he begins a fifteen-mile-a-day commute.
The rate would be raised if he were to mention this to his insurance company.
The insurance company sees that he has a different address, because they are mailing invoices to his new home.
But the rate remains the same.
Amir has a serious accident on a vacation to Yellowstone National Park, and his automobile is totaled.
His insurance policy is a no-fault policy as it relates to coverage for vehicle damage.
Is the insurance company within its rights to deny any payment on his claim?
How so, or why not?
2.
In 2009, Peter Calhoun gets a life insurance policy from Northwest Mutual Life Insurance Company, and the death benefit is listed as $250,000.
The premiums are paid up when he dies in 2011 after a getaway car being chased by the police slams into his car at fifty miles per hour on a street in suburban Chicago.
The life insurance company gets information that he smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, whereas in his application in 2009, he said he smoked only one pack a day.
In fact, he had smoked about a pack and a half every day since 1992.
Is the insurance company within its rights to deny any payment on his claim?
How so, or why not?
15.4 Case Misrepresentation to Insurer Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. v. JMR Electronics Corp. 848 F.2d 30 (2nd Cir.
1988) PER CURIAM JMR Electronics Corporation (“JMR”) appeals from a judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Robert W. Sweet, Judge) ordering rescission of a life insurance policy issued by plaintiff-appellant The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (“Mutual”) and dismissing JMR’s counterclaim for the policy’s proceeds.
Judge Sweet ruled that a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 547  misrepresentation made in the policy application concerning the insured’s history of cigarette smoking was material as a matter of law.
Appellant contends that the misrepresentation was not material because Mutual would have provided insurance—albeit at a higher premium rate—even if the insured’s smoking history had been disclosed.
We agree with the District Court that summary judgment was appropriate and therefore affirm.
The basic facts are not in dispute.
On June 24, 1985, JMR submitted an application to Mutual for a $ 250,000 “key man” life insurance policy on the life of its president, Joseph Gaon, at the non-smoker’s discounted premium rate.
Mutual’s 1985 Ratebook provides: “The Non-Smoker rates are available when the proposed insured is at least 20 years old and has not smoked a cigarette for at least twelve months prior to the date of the application.” Question 13 of the application inquired about the proposed insured’s smoking history.
Question 13(a) asked, “Do you smoke cigarettes?
How many a day?” Gaon answered this question, “No.” Question 13(b) asked, “Did you ever smoke cigarettes?
“ Gaon again answered, “No.” Based on these representations, Mutual issued a policy on Gaon’s life at the non-smoker premium rate.
Gaon died on June 22, 1986, within the period of contestability contained in policy, seeN.Y.
Ins.
Law § 3203 (a)(3) (McKinney 1985).
Upon routine investigation of JMR’s claim for proceeds under the policy, Mutual discovered that the representations made in the insurance application concerning Gaon’s smoking history were untrue.
JMR has stipulated that, at the time the application was submitted, Gaon in fact “had been smoking one-half of a pack of cigarettes per day for a continuous period of not less than 10 years.” Mutual brought this action seeking a declaration that the policy is void.
Judge Sweet granted Mutual’s motion for summary judgment, dismissed JMR’s counterclaim for the proceeds of the policy, and ordered rescission of the insurance policy and return of JMR’s premium payments, with interest.
Under New York law, which governs this diversity suit, “it is the rule that even an innocent misrepresentation as to [the applicant’s medical history], if material, is sufficient to allow the insurer to avoid the contract of insurance or defeat recovery thereunder.” Process Plants Corp. v. Beneficial National Life Insurance Co., 366 N.E.2d 1361 (1977).
A “misrepresentation” is defined by statute as a false “statement as to past or present fact, made to the insurer…at or before the making of the insurance contract as an inducement to the making thereof.” N.Y. Ins.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 548  Law § 3105(a) (McKinney 1985).
A misrepresentation is “material” if “knowledge by the insurer of the facts misrepresented would have led to a refusal by the insurer to make such contract.” Id.
§ 3105(b).… In the present case JMR has stipulated that Gaon’s smoking history was misrepresented in the insurance application.
However, JMR disputes that this misrepresentation is material as a matter of law.
JMR argues that under New York law a misrepresentation is not material unless the insurer can demonstrate that, had the applicant provided complete and accurate information, coverage either would have been refused or at the very least withheld pending a more detailed underwriting examination.
In JMR’s view summary judgment was inappropriate on the facts of this case because a jury could reasonably have found that even “had appellee been aware of Gaon’s smoking history, a policy at the smoker’s premium rate would have been issued.” JMR takes the position that the appropriate remedy in this situation is to permit recovery under the policy in the amount that the premium actually paid would have purchased for a smoker.
We agree with Judge Sweet that this novel theory is without basis in New York law.
The plain language of the statutory definition of “materiality,” found in section 3105(b), permits avoidance of liability under the policy where “knowledge by the insurer of the facts misrepresented would have led to a refusal by the insurer to make such contract.” (emphasis added) Moreover, numerous courts have observed that the materiality inquiry under New York law is made with respect to the particular policy issued in reliance upon the misrepresentation.
* * * There is no doubt that Mutual was induced to issue the non-smoker, discounted-premium policy to JMR precisely as a result of the misrepresentations made by Gaon concerning his smoking history.
That Mutual might not have refused the risk on anyterms had it known the undisclosed facts is irrelevant.
Most risks are insurable at some price.
The purpose of the materiality inquiry is not to permit the jury to rewrite the terms of the insurance agreement to conform to the newly disclosed facts but to make certain that the risk insured was the risk covered by the policy agreed upon.
If a fact is material to the risk, the insurer may avoid liability under a policy if that fact was misrepresented in an application for that policy whether or not the parties might have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 549  agreed to some other contractual arrangement had the critical fact been disclosed.
As observed by Judge Sweet, a contrary result would reward the practice of misrepresenting facts critical to the underwriter’s task because the unscrupulous (or merely negligent) applicant “would have everything to gain and nothing to lose” from making material misrepresentations in his application for insurance.
Such a claimant could rest assured not only that he may demand full coverage should he survive the contestability period, N.Y. Ins.
Law § 3203 (a)(3), but that even in the event of a contested claim, he would be entitled to the coverage that he might have contracted for had the necessary information been accurately disclosed at the outset.
New York law does not permit this anomalous result.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
When you read this case, did you assume that Gaon died from lung cancer or some other smoking-related cause?
Does the court actually say that?
2.
Can you reasonably infer from the facts here that Gaon himself filled out the form and signed it?
That is, can you know with some degree of certainty that he lied to the insurance company?
Would it make any difference if he merely signed a form that his secretary filled out?
Why or why not?
3.
What if Gaon died of causes unrelated to smoking (e.g., he was in a fatal automobile accident), and the insurance company was looking for ways to deny the claim?
Does the court’s opinion and language still seem reasonable (e.g., the statement “there is no doubt that Mutual was induced to issue the non-smoker, discounted-premium policy to JMR precisely as a result of the misrepresentations made by Gaon concerning his smoking history”)?
4.
If Gaon had accurately disclosed his smoking history, is it clear that the insurance company would have refused to write any policy at all?
Why is this question important?
Do you agree with the court that the question is irrelevant?
15.5 Summary and Exercises Summary Insurance is an inescapable cost of doing business in a modern economy and an important service for any individual with dependents or even a modest amount of property.
Most readers Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 550  of this book will someday purchase automobile, homeowner’s, and life insurance, and many readers will deal with insurance in the course of a business career.
Most insurance questions are governed by contract law, since virtually all insurance is voluntary and entered into through written agreements.
This means that the insured must pay careful attention to the wording of the policies to determine what is excluded from coverage and to ensure that he makes no warranties that he cannot keep and no misrepresentations or concealments that will void the contract.
But beyond contract law, some insurance law principles—such as insurable interest and subrogation rights—are important to bear in mind.
Defenses available to an insurance company may be based upon representation, concealment, or warranties, but an insurer that is overzealous in denying coverage may find itself subject to punitive damages.
EXERCISES 1.
Martin and Williams, two business partners, agreed that each would insure his life for the benefit of the other.
On his application for insurance, Martin stated that he had never had any heart trouble when in fact he had had a mild heart attack some years before.
Martin’s policy contained a two-year incontestable clause.
Three years later, after the partnership had been dissolved but while the policy was still in force, Martin’s car was struck by a car being negligently driven by Peters.
Although Martin’s injuries were superficial, he suffered a fatal heart attack immediately after the accident—an attack, it was established, that was caused by the excitement.
The insurer has refused to pay the policy proceeds to Williams.
Does the insurer have a valid defense based on Martin’s misrepresentation?
Explain.
2.
In Exercise 1, was it necessary for Williams to have an insurable interest in Martin’s life to recover under the policy?
Why?
3.
In Exercise 1, if Williams had taken out the policy rather than Martin, could the insurer defend the claim on the ground that at the time of Martin’s death, Williams had no insurable interest?
Why?
4.
If Williams had no insurable interest, would the incontestable clause prevent the company from asserting this defense?
Why?
5.
If the insurer pays Williams’s claim, may it recover from Peters?
Why?

Skidmore Trucking Company decided to expand its operations into the warehousing field.
After examining several available properties, it decided to purchase a carbarn for $100,000 from a local bus company and to convert it into a warehouse.
The standard contract for a real estate purchase was signed by the parties.
The contract obligated Skidmore to pay the seller on an apportioned basis for the prepaid premiums on the existing fire insurance policy ($100,000 extended coverage).
The policy expired two years and one month from the closing date.
At the closing, the seller duly assigned the fire insurance policy to Skidmore in return for the payment of the apportioned amount of the prepaid premiums, but Skidmore failed to notify the insurance company of the change in ownership.
Skidmore took possession of the premises and, after extensive renovation, began to use the building as a warehouse.
Soon afterward, one of Skidmore’s employees negligently dropped a lighted cigarette into a trash basket and started a fire that totally destroyed the building.
Was the assignment of the policy to Skidmore valid?
Why?
7.
In Exercise 6, assuming the assignment is valid, would the insurer be obligated to pay for the loss resulting from the employee’s negligence?
Why?

The Problem of Security Creditors want assurances that they will be repaid by the debtor.
An oral promise to pay is no security at all, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove.
A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor to repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a defaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent.
Again, that’s no security at all.
Real security for the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an agreement.
By Agreement with the Debtor Security obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most common form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated party does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate.
By Operation of Law Security obtained through operation of law is known as a lien.
Derived from the French for “string” or “tie,” a lien is the legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or discharge an obligation.
In this chapter, we take up security interests in personal property and suretyship.
In the next chapter, we look at mortgages and nonconsensual liens.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 554  Basics of Secured Transactions The law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can be the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of the security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that is, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) the rights of creditors when the debtor defaults.
After considering the source of the law and some key terminology, we examine each of these components in turn.
Here is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, signs a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s default, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it.
Figure 16.1 "The Grasping Hand"illustrates this scenario—the grasping hand is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but the hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 555  Figure 16.1 The Grasping Hand Source of Law and Definitions Source of Law Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property.
The UCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] This chapter applies to the following: 1.
A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or fixtures by contract; 2.
An agricultural lien; 3.
A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; 4.
A consignment… Definitions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 556  As always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is possible.
The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a security interest, and collateral.
Article 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1- 201(35) defines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation.” Security agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract that sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults.
[2] Collateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] Purchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest.
Section 9- 103(a) of the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money obligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the creditor takes a secured interest in those goods.
Suppose you want to buy a big hardbound textbook on credit at your college bookstore.
The manager refuses to extend you credit outright but says she will take back a PMSI.
In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, you’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed.
Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might make: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you default), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet ring.
Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the particular goods purchased.
A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and gave the lender a security interest in the book.
Whether a transaction is a lease or a PMSI is an issue that frequently arises.
The answer depends on the facts of each case.
However, a security interest is created if (1) the lessee is obligated to continue payments for the term of the lease; (2) the lessee cannot terminate the obligation; and (3) one of several economic tests, which are listed in UCC Section 1-201 (37), is met.
For example, one of the economic tests is that “the lessee has an option to become owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 557  The issue of lease versus security interest gets litigated because of the requirements of Article 9 that a security interest be perfected in certain ways (as we will see).
If the transaction turns out to be a security interest, a lessor who fails to meet these requirements runs the risk of losing his property to a third party.
And consider this example.
Ferrous Brothers Iron Works “leases” a $25,000 punch press to Millie’s Machine Shop.
Under the terms of the lease, Millie’s must pay a yearly rental of $5,000 for five years, after which time Millie’s may take title to the machine outright for the payment of $1.
During the period of the rental, title remains in Ferrous Brothers.
Is this “lease” really a security interest?
Since ownership comes at nominal charge when the entire lease is satisfied, the transaction would be construed as one creating a security interest.
What difference does this make?
Suppose Millie’s goes bankrupt in the third year of the lease, and the trustee in bankruptcy wishes to sell the punch press to satisfy debts of the machine shop.
If it were a true lease, Ferrous Brothers would be entitled to reclaim the machine (unless the trustee assumed the lease).
But if the lease is really intended as a device to create a security interest, then Ferrous Brothers can recover its collateral only if it has otherwise complied with the obligations of Article 9—for example, by recording its security interest, as we will see.
Now we return to definitions.
Debtor is “a person (1) having an interest in the collateral other than a security interest or a lien; (2) a seller of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; or (3) a consignee.” [4] Obligor is “a person that, with respect to an obligation secured by a security interest in or an agricultural lien on the collateral, (i) owes payment or other performance of the obligation, (ii) has provided property other than the collateral to secure payment or other performance of the obligation, or (iii) is otherwise accountable in whole or in part for payment or other performance of the obligation.” [5] Here is example 1 from the Official Comment to UCC Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt.
Behnfeldt is a debtor and an obligor.” Behnfeldt is a debtor because she has an interest in the car—she owns it.
She is an obligor because she owes payment to the creditor.
Usually the debtor is the obligor.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 558  A secondary obligor is “an obligor to the extent that: (A) [the] obligation is secondary; or (b) [the person] has a right of recourse with respect to an obligation secured by collateral against the debtor, another obligor, or property of either.” [6] The secondary obligor is a guarantor (surety) of the debt, obligated to perform if the primary obligor defaults.
Consider example 2 from the Official Comment to Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt.
Bruno cosigns a negotiable note as maker.
As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor.
As an accommodation party, Bruno is a secondary obligor.
Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary obligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.” Again, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: “Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis.
Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in her Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation.
Inasmuch as Behnfeldt does not have a property interest in the Honda, Behnfeldt is not a debtor.
Having granted the security interest, Bruno is the debtor.
Because Behnfeldt is a principal obligor, she is not a secondary obligor.
Whatever the outcome of enforcement of the security interest against the Honda or Bruno’s secondary obligation, Bruno will look to Behnfeldt for her losses.
The enforcement will not affect Behnfeldt’s aggregate obligations.” Secured party is “a person in whose favor a security interest is created or provided for under a security agreement,” and it includes people to whom accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes have been sold; consignors; and others under Section 9- 102(a)(72).
Chattel mortgage means “a debt secured against items of personal property rather than against land, buildings and fixtures.” [7] Property Subject to the Security Interest Now we examine what property may be put up as security—collateral.
Collateral is—again— property that is subject to the security interest.
It can be divided into four broad categories: goods, intangible property, indispensable paper, and other types of collateral.
Goods Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 559  Tangible property as collateral is goods.
Goods means “all things that are movable when a security interest attaches.
The term includes (i) fixtures, (ii) standing timber that is to be cut and removed under a conveyance or contract for sale, (iii) the unborn young of animals, (iv) crops grown, growing, or to be grown, even if the crops are produced on trees, vines, or bushes, and (v) manufactured homes.
The term also includes a computer program embedded in goods.” [8] Goods are divided into several subcategories; six are taken up here.
Consumer Goods These are “goods used or bought primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” [9] Inventory “Goods, other than farm products, held by a person for sale or lease or consisting of raw materials, works in progress, or material consumed in a business.” [10] Farm Products “Crops, livestock, or other supplies produced or used in farming operations,” including aquatic goods produced in aquaculture.
[11] Equipment This is the residual category, defined as “goods other than inventory, farm products, or consumer goods.” [12] Fixtures These are “goods that have become so related to particular real property that an interest in them arises under real property law.” [13] Examples would be windows, furnaces, central air conditioning, and plumbing fixtures—items that, if removed, would be a cause for significant reconstruction.
Accession These are “goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the original goods is lost.” [14] A new engine installed in an old automobile is an accession.
Intangible Property Two types of collateral are neither goods nor indispensible paper: accounts and general intangibles.
Accounts Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 560  This type of intangible property includes accounts receivable (the right to payment of money), insurance policy proceeds, energy provided or to be provided, winnings in a lottery, health-care- insurance receivables, promissory notes, securities, letters of credit, and interests in business entities.
[15] Often there is something in writing to show the existence of the right—such as a right to receive the proceeds of somebody else’s insurance payout—but the writing is merely evidence of the right.
The paper itself doesn’t have to be delivered for the transfer of the right to be effective; that’s done by assignment.
General Intangibles General intangibles refers to “any personal property, including things in action, other than accounts, commercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, or other minerals before extraction.” General intangibles include payment intangibles and software.
[16] Indispensable Paper This oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible property.
It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse receipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the value.
For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a security interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse.
If Deborah defaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is entitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation.
The warehouser will not let Carl have the chairs without the warehouse receipt— it’s indispensable paper.
There are four kinds of indispensable paper.
Chattel Paper Chattel is another word for goods.
Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both “a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain goods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral.
For example, Creditor Car Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a purchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper).
The chattel paper is not yet collateral; the automobile is.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 561  Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from Lift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to Lift Co.
The chattel paper is now collateral.
Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic.
Documents This category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples.
Instruments An “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any other writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security agreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with any necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) letters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or charge card or information contained on or for use with the card.
[18] Investment Property This includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity contracts.
[19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a certificate).
[20] Other Types of Collateral Among possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is thefloating lien.
This is a security interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was executed.
The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and proceeds held by—most often—the business debtor.
It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell their collateralized inventory.
Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily depleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers.
Pretty soon, there’d be no security at all.
The floating lien includes the following: • After-acquired property.
This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set up.
It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more property subject to collateralization.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 562  • Sale proceeds.
These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral.
Carl Creditor takes a secured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat.
She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor.
The secured interest attaches to the garden tractor.
• Future advances.
Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present and future advances of credit without any additional paperwork.
Here are examples of future advances: Example 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a future o advances clause.
The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a $700,000 inventory- picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor.
The parties contemplate that the debtor will, from time to time, borrow more money, and when the debtor does, the machine will stand as collateral to secure the further indebtedness, without new paperwork.
Example 2: A debtor signs a security agreement with a bank to buy a car.
The security agreement o contains a future advances clause.
A few years later, the bank sends the debtor a credit card.
Two years go by: the car is paid for, but the credit card is in default.
The bank seizes the car.
“Whoa!” says the debtor.
“I paid for the car.” “Yes,” says the bank, “but it was collateral for all future indebtedness you ran up with us.
Check out your loan agreement with us and UCC Section 9-204(c), especially Comment 5.” See Figure 16.2 "Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral".
Figure 16.2 Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 563  Attachment of the Security Interest In General Attachment is the term used to describe when a security interest becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral.
In Figure 16.1 "The Grasping Hand", ”Attachment” is the outreached hand that is prepared, if the debtor defaults, to grasp the collateral.
[21] Requirements for Attachment Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 564  There are three requirements for attachment: (1) the secured party gives value; (2) the debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in it to the secured party; (3) the parties have a security agreement “authenticated” (signed) by the debtor, or the creditor has possession of the collateral.
Creditor Gives Value The creditor, or secured party, must give “value” for the security interest to attach.
The UCC, in Section 1-204, provides that a person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them (1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection; or (2) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim; or (3) by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase; or (4) generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.
Suppose Deborah owes Carl $3,000.
She cannot repay the sum when due, so she agrees to give Carl a security interest in her automobile to the extent of $3,000 in return for an extension of the time to pay.
That is sufficient value.
Debtor’s Rights in Collateral The debtor must have rights in the collateral.
Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some ownership interest in it).
The rights need not necessarily be the immediate right to possession, but they must be rights that can be conveyed.
[22] A person can’t put up as collateral property she doesn’t own.
Security Agreement (Contract) or Possession of Collateral by Creditor The debtor most often signs the written security agreement, or contract.
The UCC says that “the debtor [must have] authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral.…” “Authenticating” (or “signing,” “adopting,” or “accepting”) means to sign or, in recognition of electronic commercial transactions, “to execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a record…with the present intent of the authenticating person to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 565  identify the person and adopt or accept a record.” The “record” is the modern UCC’s substitution for the term “writing.” It includes information electronically stored or on paper.
[23] The “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases.
It is not required if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor to possess.
For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the debtor offers up his stamp collection.
The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and show me the appraisal.
If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my safe until you’ve repaid me.
If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any goods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible.
In commercial transactions, it would be common for the creditor to have possession of—actually or virtually—certified securities, deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, or other such paper or electronic evidence of value.
[24] Again, Figure 16.1 "The Grasping Hand" diagrams the attachment, showing the necessary elements: the creditor gives value, the debtor has rights in collateral, and there is a security agreement signed (authenticated) by the debtor.
If the debtor defaults, the creditor’s “hand” will grab (repossess) the collateral.
Perfection of the Security Interest As between the debtor and the creditor, attachment is fine: if the debtor defaults, the creditor will repossess the goods and—usually—sell them to satisfy the outstanding obligation.
But unless an additional set of steps is taken, the rights of the secured party might be subordinated to the rights of other secured parties, certain lien creditors, bankruptcy trustees, and buyers who give value and who do not know of the security interest.
Perfection is the secured party’s way of announcing the security interest to the rest of the world.
It is the secured party’s claim on the collateral.
There are five ways a creditor may perfect a security interest: (1) by filing a financing statement, (2) by taking or retaining possession of the collateral, (3) by taking control of the collateral, (4) by taking control temporarily as specified by the UCC, or (5) by taking control automatically.
Perfection by Filing Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 566  “Except as otherwise provided…a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security agreements.” [25] The Financing Statement A financing statement is a simple notice showing the creditor’s general interest in the collateral.
It is what’s filed to establish the creditor’s “dibs.” Contents of the Financing Statement It may consist of the security agreement itself, as long as it contains the information required by the UCC, but most commonly it is much less detailed than the security agreement: it “indicates merely that a person may have a security interest in the collateral[.
]…Further inquiry from the parties concerned will be necessary to disclose the full state of affairs.” [26] The financing statement must provide the following information: • The debtor’s name.
Financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name, so getting that correct is important.
Section 9-503 of the UCC describes what is meant by “name of debtor.” • The secured party’s name.
• An “indication” of what collateral is covered by the financing statement.
[27] It may describe the collateral or it may “indicate that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property” (such generic references are not acceptable in the security agreement but are OK in the financing statement).
[28] If the collateral is real-property-related, covering timber to be cut or fixtures, it must include a description of the real property to which the collateral is related.
[29] The form of the financing statement may vary from state to state, but see Figure 16.3 "UCC-1 Financing Statement" for a typical financing statement.
Minor errors or omissions on the form will not make it ineffective, but the debtor’s signature is required unless the creditor is authorized by the debtor to make the filing without a signature, which facilitates paperless filing.
[30] Figure 16.3 UCC-1 Financing Statement Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 567  Duration of the Financing Statement Generally, the financing statement is effective for five years; acontinuation statement may be filed within six months before the five-year expiration date, and it is good for another five years.
[31] Manufactured-home filings are good for thirty years.
When the debtor’s obligation is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 568  satisfied, the secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon demand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement.
[32] Debtor Moves out of State The UCC also has rules for continued perfection of security interests when the debtor—whether an individual or an association (corporation)—moves from one state to another.
Generally, an interest remains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the debtor moves to a new jurisdiction.
[33] Where to File the Financing Statement For most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—the place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office.
[34] For other collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state.
In some states, that is the office of the Secretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that maintains the state’s filing system.
[35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or her primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered organization.
[36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is already encumbered.
In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt.
The filing office will provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available for at least some types of collateral.
Exemptions Some transactions are exempt from the filing provision.
The most important category of exempt collateral is that covered by state certificate of title laws.
For example, many states require automobile owners to obtain a certificate of title from the state motor vehicle office.
Most of these states provide that it is not necessary to file a financing statement in order to perfect a security interest in an automobile.
The reason is that the motor vehicle regulations require any security interests to be stated on the title, so that anyone attempting to buy a car in which a security interest had been created would be on notice when he took the actual title certificate.
[37] Temporary Perfection Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 569  The UCC provides that certain types of collateral are automatically perfected but only for a while: “A security interest in certificated securities, or negotiable documents, or instruments is perfected without filing or the taking of possession for a period of twenty days from the time it attaches to the extent that it arises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement.” [38] Similar temporary perfection covers negotiable documents or goods in possession of a bailee, and when a security certificate or instrument is delivered to the debtor for sale, exchange, presentation, collection, enforcement, renewal, or registration.
[39] After the twenty-day period, perfection would have to be by one of the other methods mentioned here.
Perfection by Possession A secured party may perfect the security interest by possession where the collateral is negotiable documents, goods, instruments, money, tangible chattel paper, or certified securities.
[40] This is a pledge of assets (mentioned in the example of the stamp collection).
No security agreement is required for perfection by possession.
A variation on the theme of pledge is field warehousing.
When the pawnbroker lends money, he takes possession of the goods—the watch, the ring, the camera.
But when large manufacturing concerns wish to borrow against their inventory, taking physical possession is not necessarily so easy.
The bank does not wish to have shipped to its Wall Street office several tons of copper mined in Colorado.
Bank employees perhaps could go west to the mine and take physical control of the copper, but banks are unlikely to employ people and equipment necessary to build a warehouse on the spot.
Thus this so-called field pledge is rare.
More common is the field warehouse.
The field warehouse can take one of two forms.
An independent company can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—thus establishing physical control of the collateral.
Or the independent company can lease the warehouse facilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody.
Either way, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service.
The field warehouse then segregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to the lender for those goods.
The lender is thus assured of a security interest in the collateral.
Perfection by Control Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 570  “A security interest in investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic chattel paper may be perfected by control of the collateral.” [41] “Control” depends on what the collateral is.
If it’s a checking account, for example, the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has “control”: the bank gets a security interest automatically because, as Official Comment 3 to UCC Section 9-104 puts it, “all actual and potential creditors of the debtor are always on notice that the bank with which the debtor’s deposit account is maintained may assert a claim against the deposit account.” “Control” of electronic chattel paper of investment property, and of letter-of-credit rights is detailed in Sections 9-105, 9-106, and 9-107.
Obtaining “control” means that the creditor has taken whatever steps are necessary, given the manner in which the items are held, to place itself in a position where it can have the items sold, without further action by the owner.
[42] Automatic Perfection The fifth mechanism of perfection is addressed in Section 9-309 of the UCC: there are several circumstances where a security interest is perfected upon mere attachment.
The most important here is automatic perfection of a purchase-money security interest given in consumer goods.
If a seller of consumer goods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection of the security interest is automatic.
But the seller may file a financial statement and faces a risk if he fails to file and the consumer debtor sells the goods.
Under Section 9-320(b), a buyer of consumer goods takes free of a security interest, even though perfected, if he buys without knowledge of the interest, pays value, and uses the goods for his personal, family, or household purposes—unless the secured party had first filed a financing statement covering the goods.
Figure 16.4 Attachment and Perfection KEY TAKEAWAY Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 571  A creditor may be secured—allowed to take the debtor’s property upon debtor’s default—by agreement between the parties or by operation of law.
The law governing agreements for personal property security is Article 9 of the UCC.
The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest.
This is usually accomplished when the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some valuable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving the creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults.
The UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to assets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights).
Sometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral.
After attachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors claim an interest in the collateral.
Perfection is most often accomplished by filing a financing statement in the appropriate place to put the world on notice of the creditor’s interest.
Perfection can also be achieved by a pledge (possession by the secured creditor) or by “control” of certain assets (having such control over them as to be able to sell them if the debtor defaults).
Perfection is automatic temporarily for some items (certified securities, instruments, and negotiable documents) but also upon mere attachment to purchase-money security interests in consumer goods.

16.2 Priorities LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the general rule regarding who gets priority among competing secured parties.
2.
Know the immediate exceptions to the general rule—all involving PMSIs.
3.
Understand the basic ideas behind the other exceptions to the general rule.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 574  Priorities: this is the money question.
Who gets what when a debtor defaults?
Depending on how the priorities in the collateral were established, even a secured creditor may walk away with the collateral or with nothing.
Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions.
General Rule The general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the one who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins.
The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors.
Application of the Rule If both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins.
If one has perfected and one attached, the perfected party wins.
If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins.
If neither has attached, they are unsecured creditors.
Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: 1.
Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain collateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat.
Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the security interest attaches.
On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any money.
On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the statement she filed on March 1.
On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat as security.
Who has priority?
Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first extended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed).
This result is dictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she subsequently made her loan.
2.
Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by the fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet.
Erika gives Susan the money a week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either.
A week later, they find out they have each made a loan against the same coat.
Who has priority?
Whoever perfects first: the rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet.
Whoever can submit the financing statement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not depend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 575  claiming a security interest in the same collateral.
But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest first attached has priority?
This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC commentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation without [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, neither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee.
To rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors lose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected).
If both parties are secured (have attached the interest), the first to perfect wins.
[1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins.
[2] Exceptions to the General Rule There are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—actually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them.
Immediate Exceptions We call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate priority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it.
They all involve purchase-money security interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor had sold the debtor.
(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock).The UCC provides that “a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase- money security interest is perfected when debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to this UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an after-acquired property clause.” Suppose Susan manufactures fur coats.
On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security agreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause.
Rosemary files a financing statement that same day.
On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 and gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 576  financing statement within twenty days of the time that the machine is delivered to Susan.
Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments?
Under the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI.
Suppose, however, that Susan had not bought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it.
Then Rosemary would have priority, because her filing was prior to Erika’s.
What would happen if this kind of PMSI in noninventory goods (here, equipment) did not get priority status?
A prudent Erika would not extend credit to Susan at all, and if the new machine is necessary for Susan’s business, she would soon be out of business.
That certainly would not inure to the benefit of Rosemary.
It is, mostly, to Rosemary’s advantage that Susan gets the machine: it enhances Susan’s ability to make money to pay Rosemary.
(2) Purchase-money security interest in inventory.
The UCC provides that a perfected PMSI in inventory has priority over conflicting interests in the same inventory, provided that the PMSI is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the inventory, the PMSI-secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting interest and that person receives the notice within five years before the debtor receives possession of the inventory, and the notice states that the person sending it has or expects to acquire a PMSI in the inventory and describes the inventory.
[4] The notice requirement is aimed at protecting a secured party in the typical situation in which incoming inventory is subject to a prior agreement to make advances against it.
If the original creditor gets notice that new inventory is subject to a PMSI, he will be forewarned against making an advance on it; if he does not receive notice, he will have priority.
It is usually to the earlier creditor’s advantage that her debtor is able to get credit to “floor” (provide) inventory, without selling which, of course, the debtor cannot pay back the earlier creditor.
(3) Purchase-money security interest in fixtures.
Under UCC Section 9-334(e), a perfected security in fixtures has priority over a mortgage if the security interest is a PMSI and the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days after.
A mortgagee is usually a bank (the mortgagor is the owner of the real estate, subject to the mortgagee’s interest).
The bank’s mortgage covers the real estate and fixtures, even fixtures added after the date of the mortgage (after-acquired property clause).
In accord with the general Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 577  rule, then, the mortgagee/bank would normally have priority if the mortgage is recorded first, as would a fixture filing if made before the mortgage was recorded.
But with the exception noted, the bank’s interest is subordinate to the fixture-seller’s later-perfected PMSI.
Example: Susan buys a new furnace from Heating Co. to put in her house.
Susan gave a bank a thirty-year mortgage on the house ten years before.
Heating Co. takes back a PMSI and files the appropriate financing statement before or within twenty days of installation.
If Susan defaults on her loan to the bank, Heating Co. would take priority over the bank.
And why not?
The mortgagee has, in the long run, benefited from the improvement and modernization of the real estate.
(Again, there are further nuances in Section 9-334 beyond our scope here.)
A non-PMSI in fixtures or PMSIs perfected more than twenty days after goods become a fixture loses out to prior recorded interests in the realty.
Other Exceptions We have noted the three immediate exceptions to the general rule that “the firstest with the mostest” prevails.
There are some other exceptions.
Think about how these other exceptions might arise: who might want to take property subject to a security agreement (not including thieves)?
That is, Debtor gives Creditor a security interest in, say, goods, while retaining possession.
First, buyers of various sorts might want the goods if they paid for them; they usually win.
Second, lien creditors might want the goods (a lien creditor is one whose claim is based on operation of law—involuntarily against Debtor, and including a trustee in bankruptcy—as opposed to one whose claim is based on agreement); lien creditors may be statutory (landlords, mechanics, bailees) or judicial.
Third, a bankruptcy trustee representing Debtor’s creditors (independent of the trustee’s role as a lien creditor) might want to take the goods to sell and satisfy Debtor’s obligations to the creditors.
Fourth, unsecured creditors; fifth, secured creditors; and sixth, secured and perfected creditors.
We will examine some of the possible permutations but are compelled to observe that this area of law has many fine nuances, not all of which can be taken up here.
First we look at buyers who take priority over, or free of, unperfected security interests.
Buyers who take delivery of many types of collateral covered by an unperfected security interest win out over the hapless secured party who failed to perfect if they give value and don’t know of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 578  security interest or agricultural lien.
[5] A buyer who doesn’t give value or who knows of the security interest will not win out, nor will a buyer prevail if the seller’s creditor files a financing statement before or within twenty days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral.
Now we look at buyers who take priority over perfected security interests.
Sometimes people who buy things even covered by a perfected security interest win out (the perfected secured party loses).
• Buyers in the ordinary course of business.
“A buyer in the ordinary course of business, other than [one buying farm products from somebody engaged in farming] takes free of a security interest created by the buyer’s seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows [it].” [6] Here the buyer is usually purchasing inventory collateral, and it’s OK if he knows the inventory is covered by a security interest, but it’s not OK if he knows “that the sale violates a term in an agreement with the secured party.” [7] It would not be conducive to faith in commercial transactions if buyers of inventory generally had to worry whether their seller’s creditors were going to repossess the things the buyers had purchased in good faith.
For example (based on example 1 to the same comment, UCC 9-320, Official Comment 3), Manufacturer makes appliances and owns manufacturing equipment covered by a perfected security agreement in favor of Lender.
Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, whose business is buying and selling used equipment; Dealer, in turn, sells the stuff to Buyer, a buyer in the ordinary course.
Does Buyer take free of the security interest?
No, because Dealer didn’t create it; Manufacturer did.
• Buyers of consumer goods purchased for personal, family, or household use take free of security interests, even if perfected, so long as they buy without knowledge of the security interest, for value, for their own consumer uses, and before the filing of a financing statement covering the goods.
This—again—is the rub when a seller of consumer goods perfects by “mere attachment” (automatic perfection) and the buyer of the goods turns around and sells them.
For example, Tom buys a new refrigerator from Sears, which perfects by mere attachment.
Tom has cash flow problems and sells the fridge to Ned, his neighbor.
Ned doesn’t know about Sears’s security interest and pays a reasonable amount for it.
He puts it in his kitchen for home use.
Sears cannot repossess the fridge from Ned.
If it wanted to protect itself fully, Sears would have filed a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 579  financing statement; then Ned would be out the fridge when the repo men came.
[8] The “value” issue is interestingly presented in the Nicolosi case (Section 16.5 "Cases").
• Buyers of farm products.
The UCC itself does not protect buyers of farm products from security interests created by “the person engaged in farming operations who is in the business of selling farm products,” and the result was that sometimes the buyer had to pay twice: once to the farmer and again to the lender whom the farmer didn’t pay.
As a result, Congress included in its 1985 Farm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course of business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a security interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer knows of the existence of such interest.” There are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here.
Lien Creditors Persons (including bankruptcy trustees) who become lien creditors before the security interest is perfected win out—the unperfected security interest is subordinate to lien creditors.
Persons who become lien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the lien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security interest and the type of collateral).
[9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides otherwise).
[10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a lien situation.
Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security interest to Bank.
Owner doesn’t pay Bank.
Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic.
It will have to pay the Mechanic first.
And why not?
If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired anyway.
Bankruptcy Trustee To what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest?
It depends.
If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take the collateral.
[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 580  subject to rules on preferential transfers: the Bankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—including a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, (3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one year, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more than it would have in the bankruptcy.
[12] There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but the short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find out that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them.
Deposit accounts perfected by control.
A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings account, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account perfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes priority over all other conflicting security agreements.
[13] For example, a debtor enters into a security agreement with his sailboat as collateral.
The creditor perfects.
The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits the proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds.
The debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s account by control.
The debtor defaults.
Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds?
The bank does.
The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to examine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit account.” [14] KEY TAKEAWAY Who among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults?
The general rule on priorities is that the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins.
If one has perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins.
If all have attached, the first to attach wins.
If none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors.
To this general rule there are a number of exceptions.
Purchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in the same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have priority over previously perfected mortgagees.
Buyers in the ordinary course of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 581  business take free of a security interest created by their seller, so long as they don’t know their purchase violates a security agreement.
Buyers of consumer goods perfected by mere attachment win out over the creditor who declined to file.
Buyers in the ordinary course of business of farm products prevail over the farmer’s creditors (under federal law, not the UCC).
Lien creditors who become such before perfection win out; those who become such after perfection usually lose.
Bailees in possession and material men have priority over previous perfected claimants.
Bankruptcy trustees win out over unperfected security interests and over perfected ones if they are considered voidable transfers from the debtor to the secured party.
Deposit accounts perfected by control prevail over previously perfected secured parties in the same deposit accounts.
EXERCISES 1.
What is the general rule regarding priorities for the right to repossess goods encumbered by a security interest when there are competing creditors clamoring for that right?
2.
Why does it make good sense to allow purchase-money security creditors in (1) inventory, (2) equipment, and (3) fixtures priority over creditors who perfected before the PMSI was perfected?
3.
A buyer in the ordinary course of business is usually one buying inventory.
Why does it make sense that such a buyer should take free of a security interest created by his seller?

16.3 Rights of Creditor on Default and Disposition after Repossession LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand that the creditor may sue to collect the debt.
2.
Recognize that more commonly the creditor will realize on the collateral—repossess it.
3.
Know how collateral may be disposed of upon repossession: by sale or by strict foreclosure.
Rights of Creditor on Default Upon default, the creditor must make an election: to sue, or to repossess.
Resort to Judicial Process After a debtor’s default (e.g., by missing payments on the debt), the creditor could ignore the security interest and bring suit on the underlying debt.
But creditors rarely resort to this remedy because it is time-consuming and costly.
Most creditors prefer to repossess the collateral and sell it or retain possession in satisfaction of the debt.
Repossession Section 9-609 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) permits the secured party to take possession of the collateral on default (unless the agreement specifies otherwise): (a) After default, a secured party may (1) take possession of the collateral; and (2) without removal, may render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a debtor’s premises.
(b) A secured party may proceed under subsection (a): (1) pursuant to judicial process; or (2) without judicial process, if it proceeds without breach of the peace.
This language has given rise to the flourishing business of professional “repo men” (and women).
“Repo” companies are firms that specialize in repossession collateral.
They have trained car-lock pickers, in-house locksmiths, experienced repossession teams, damage-free towing equipment, and the capacity to deliver repossessed collateral to the client’s desired destination.
Some firms advertise that they have 360-degree video cameras that record every Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 583  aspect of the repossession.
They have “skip chasers”—people whose business it is to track down those who skip out on their obligations, and they are trained not to breach the peace.
[1] See Pantoja-Cahue v. Ford Motor Credit Co., a case discussing repossession, in Section 16.5 "Cases".
The reference in Section 9-609(a)(2) to “render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a debtor’s premises” gets to situations involving “heavy equipment [when] the physical removal from the debtor’s plant and the storage of collateral pending disposition may be impractical or unduly expensive.…Of course…all aspects of the disposition must be commercially reasonable.” [2] Rendering the equipment unusable would mean disassembling some critical part of the machine—letting it sit there until an auction is set up on the premises.
The creditor’s agents—the repo people—charge for their service, of course, and if possible the cost of repossession comes out of the collateral when it’s sold.
A debtor would be better off voluntarily delivering the collateral according to the creditor’s instructions, but if that doesn’t happen, “self-help”—repossession—is allowed because, of course, the debtor said it would be allowed in the security agreement, so long as the repossession can be accomplished without breach of peace.
“Breach of peace” is language that can cover a wide variety of situations over which courts do not always agree.
For example, some courts interpret a creditor’s taking of the collateral despite the debtor’s clear oral protest as a breach of the peace; other courts do not.
Disposition after Repossession After repossession, the creditor has two options: sell the collateral or accept it in satisfaction of the debt (see Figure 16.5 "Disposition after Repossession").
Figure 16.5 Disposition after Repossession Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 584  Sale Sale is the usual method of recovering the debt.
Section 9-610 of the UCC permits the secured creditor to “sell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its present condition or following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing.” The collateral may be sold as a whole or in parcels, at one time or at different times.
Two requirements limit the creditor’s power to resell: (1) it must send notice to the debtor and secondary obligor, and (unless consumer goods are sold) to other secured parties; and (2) all aspects of the sale must be “commercially reasonable.” [3] Most frequently the collateral is auctioned off.
Section 9-615 of the UCC describes how the proceeds are applied: first, to the costs of the repossession, including reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses as provided for in the security agreement (and it will provide for that!
); second, to the satisfaction of the obligation owed; and third, to junior creditors.
This again emphasizes the importance of promptly perfecting the security interest: failure to do so frequently subordinates the tardy creditor’s interest to junior status.
If there is money left over from disposing of the collateral—a surplus— the debtor gets that back.
If there is still money owing—a deficiency—the debtor is liable for that.
In Section 9-616, the UCC carefully explains how the surplus or deficiency is calculated; the explanation is required in a consumer goods transaction, and it has to be sent to the debtor after the disposition.
Strict Foreclosure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 585  Because resale can be a bother (or the collateral is appreciating in value), the secured creditor may wish simply to accept the collateral in full satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the debt, as permitted in UCC Section 9-620(a).
This is known asstrict foreclosure.
The debtor must consent to letting the creditor take the collateral without a sale in a “record authenticated after default,” or after default the creditor can send the debtor a proposal for the creditor to accept the collateral, and the proposal is effective if not objected to within twenty days after it’s sent.
The strict foreclosure provisions contain a safety feature for consumer goods debtors.
If the debtor has paid at least 60 percent of the debt, then the creditor may not use strict foreclosure— unless the debtor signs a statement after default renouncing his right to bar strict foreclosure and to force a sale.
[4] A consumer who refuses to sign such a statement thus forces the secured creditor to sell the collateral under Section 9-610.
Should the creditor fail to sell the goods within ninety days after taking possession of the goods, he is liable to the debtor for the value of the goods in a conversion suit or may incur the liabilities set forth in Section 9-625, which provides for minimum damages for the consumer debtor.
Recall that the UCC imposes a duty to act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, and in most cases with reasonable notification.
[5] See Figure 16.5 "Disposition after Repossession".
Foreclosure on Intangible Collateral A secured party’s repossession of inventory or equipment can disrupt or even close a debtor’s business.
However, when the collateral is intangible—such as accounts receivable, general intangibles, chattel paper, or instruments—collection by a secured party after the debtor’s default may proceed without interrupting the business.
Section 9-607 of the UCC provides that on default, the secured party is entitled to notify the third party—for example, a person who owes money on an account—that payment should be made to him.
The secured party is accountable to the debtor for any surplus, and the debtor is liable for any deficiency unless the parties have agreed otherwise.
As always in parsing the UCC here, some of the details and nuances are necessarily omitted because of lack of space or because a more detailed analysis is beyond this book’s scope.
KEY TAKEAWAY Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 586  Upon default, the creditor may bring a lawsuit against the debtor to collect a judgment.
But the whole purpose of secured transactions is to avoid this costly and time-consuming litigation.
The more typical situation is that the creditor repossesses the collateral and then either auctions it off (sale) or keeps it in satisfaction of the debt (strict foreclosure).
In the former situation, the creditor may then proceed against the debtor for the deficiency.
In consumer cases, the creditor cannot use strict foreclosure if 60 percent of the purchase price has been paid.
EXERCISES 1.
Although a creditor could sue the debtor, get a judgment against it, and collect on the judgment, usually the creditor repossesses the collateral.
Why is repossession the preferred method of realizing on the security?
2.
Why is repossession allowed so long as it can be done without a breach of the peace?
3.
Under what circumstances is strict foreclosure not allowed?

16.4 Suretyship LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand what a surety is and why sureties are used in commercial transactions.
2.
Know how suretyships are created.
3.
Recognize the general duty owed by the surety to the creditor, and the surety’s defenses.
4.
Recognize the principal obligor’s duty to the surety, and the surety’s rights against the surety.
5.
Understand the rights among cosureties.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 587  Definition, Types of Sureties, and Creation of the Suretyship Definition Suretyship is the second of the three major types of consensual security arrangements noted at the beginning of this chapter (personal property security, suretyship, real property security)— and a common one.
Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the company, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts.
The earliest sureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee.
Today most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as suretyship).
A surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by theprincipal debtor, and, strictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the surety when the debt is due.
The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, strictly speaking) owes an obligation.
Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up collateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain the creditor is paid or performance is made.
For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his corporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000.
Bank says, “Okay, Mr.
Debtor, we’ll loan the corporation money, but we want its computer equipment as security, and we want you personally to guarantee the debt if the corporation can’t pay.” Sometimes, though, the surety and the principal debtor may have no agreement between each other; the surety might have struck a deal with the creditor to act as surety without the consent or knowledge of the principal debtor.
A guarantor also is one who guarantees an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, therefore, guarantor is usually synonymous with surety—the terms are used pretty much interchangeably.
But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and signs her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the principal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very start, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to inform her of it does not discharge her of any liability.
On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not make his agreement with the creditor at the same Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 588  time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract requiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the guarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him.
But, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both.
Figure 16.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety Types of Suretyship Where there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, sureties are engaged.
For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a security deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if the tenant defaults.
Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety available in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project.
Many states require general contractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s license; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the client’s house.
These are Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 589  types of a performance bond.
A judge will often require that a criminal defendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-bonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays caused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond.
A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal money from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond).
However, as we will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, mostly, to be repaid if it has to perform.
The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the bond—the suretyship policy.
The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond applied for, and the applicant’s financial history.
A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 percent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent and 20 percent of the bond amount.
When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s mortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee releases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults.
Creation of the Suretyship Suretyship can arise only through contract.
The general principles of contract law apply to suretyship.
Thus a person with the general capacity to contract has the power to become a surety.
Consideration is required for a suretyship contract: if Debtor asks a friend to act as a surety to induce Creditor to make Debtor a loan, the consideration Debtor gives Creditor also acts as the consideration Friend gives.
Where the suretyship arises after Creditor has already extended credit, new consideration would be required (absent application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel [1]).
You may recall from the chapters on contracts that the promise by one person to pay or perform for the debts or defaults of another must be evidenced by a writing under the statute of frauds (subject to the “main purpose” exception).
Suretyship contracts are affected to some extent by government regulation.
Under a 1985 Federal Trade Commission Credit Practices Rule, creditors are prohibited from misrepresenting a surety’s liability.
Creditors must also give the surety a notice that explains the nature of the obligation and the potential liability that can arise if a person cosigns on another’s debt.
[2] Duties and Rights of the Surety Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 590  Duties of the Surety Upon the principal debtor’s default, the surety is contractually obligated to perform unless the principal herself or someone on her behalf discharges the obligation.
When the surety performs, it must do so in good faith.
Because the principal debtor’s defenses are generally limited, and because—as will be noted—the surety has the right to be reimbursed by the debtor, debtors not infrequently claim the surety acted in bad faith by doing things like failing to make an adequate investigation (to determine if the debtor really defaulted), overpaying claims, interfering with the contact between the surety and the debtor, and making unreasonable refusals to let the debtor complete the project.
The case Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co., in Section 16.5 "Cases", is typical.
Rights of the Surety The surety has four main rights stemming from its obligation to answer for the debt or default of the principal debtor.
Exoneration If, at the time a surety’s obligation has matured, the principal can satisfy the obligation but refuses to do so, the surety is entitled to exoneration—a court order requiring the principal to perform.
It would be inequitable to force the surety to perform and then to have to seek reimbursement from the principal if all along the principal is able to perform.
Reimbursement If the surety must pay the creditor because the principal has defaulted, the principal is obligated to reimburse the surety.
The amount required to be reimbursed includes the surety’s reasonable, good-faith outlays, including interest and legal fees.
Subrogation Suppose the principal’s duty to the creditor is fully satisfied and that the surety has contributed to this satisfaction.
Then the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor against the principal.
In other words, the surety stands in the creditor’s shoes and may assert against the principal whatever rights the creditor could have asserted had the duty not been discharged.
The right of subrogation includes the right to take secured interests that the creditor obtained from the principal to cover the duty.
Sarah’s Pizzeria owes Martha $5,000, and Martha Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 591  has taken a security interest in Sarah’s Chevrolet.
Eva is surety for the debt.
Sarah defaults, and Eva pays Martha the $5,000.
Eva is entitled to have the security interest in the car transferred to her.
Contribution Two or more sureties who are bound to answer for the principal’s default and who should share between them the loss caused by the default are known as cosureties.
A surety who in performing its own obligation to the creditor winds up paying more than its proportionate share is entitled to contribution from the cosureties.
Defenses of the Parties The principal and the surety may have defenses to paying.
Defenses of the Principal The principal debtor may avail itself of any standard contract defenses as against the creditor, including impossibility, illegality, incapacity, fraud, duress, insolvency, or bankruptcy discharge.
However, the surety may contract with the creditor to be liable despite the principal’s defenses, and a surety who has undertaken the suretyship with knowledge of the creditor’s fraud or duress remains obligated, even though the principal debtor will be discharged.
When the surety turns to the principal debtor and demands reimbursement, the latter may have defenses against the surety—as noted—for acting in bad faith.
One of the main reasons creditors want the promise of a surety is to avoid the risk that the principal debtor will go bankrupt: the debtor’s bankruptcy is a defense to the debtor’s liability, certainly, but that defense cannot be used by the surety.
The same is true of the debtor’s incapacity: it is a defense available to the principal debtor but not to the surety.
Defenses of the Surety Generally, the surety may exercise defenses on a contract that would have been available to the principal debtor (e.g., creditor’s breach; impossibility or illegality of performance; fraud, duress, or misrepresentation by creditor; statute of limitations; refusal of creditor to accept tender or performance from either debtor or surety.)
Beyond that, the surety has some defenses of its own.
Common defenses raised by sureties include the following: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 592  • Release of the principal.
Whenever a creditor releases the principal, the surety is discharged, unless the surety consents to remain liable or the creditor expressly reserves her rights against the surety.
The creditor’s release of the surety, though, does not release the principal debtor because the debtor is liable without regard to the surety’s liability.
• Modification of the contract.
If the creditor alters the instrument sufficiently to discharge the principal, the surety is discharged as well.
Likewise, when the creditor and principal modify their contract, a surety who has not consented to the modification is discharged if the surety’s risk is materially increased (but not if it is decreased).
Modifications include extension of the time of payment, release of collateral (this releases the surety to the extent of the impairment), change in principal debtor’s duties, and assignment or delegation of the debtor’s obligations to a third party.
The surety may consent to modifications.
• Creditor’s failure to perfect.
A creditor who fails to file a financing statement or record a mortgage risks losing the security for the loan and might also inadvertently release a surety, but the failure of the creditor to resort first to collateral is no defense.
• Statute of frauds.
Suretyship contracts are among those required to be evidenced by some writing under the statute of frauds, and failure to do so may discharge the surety from liability.
• Creditor’s failure to inform surety of material facts within creditor’s knowledge affecting debtor’s ability to perform (e.g., that debtor has defaulted several times before).
• General contract defenses.
The surety may raise common defenses like incapacity (infancy), lack of consideration (unless promissory estoppel can be substituted or unless no separate consideration is necessary because the surety’s and debtor’s obligations arise at the same time), and creditor’s fraud or duress on surety.
However, fraud by the principal debtor on the surety to induce the suretyship will not release the surety if the creditor extended credit in good faith; if the creditor knows of the fraud perpetrated by the debtor on the surety, the surety may avoid liability.
See Figure 16.6 "Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety".
The following are defenses of principal debtor only: • Death or incapacity of principal debtor • Bankruptcy of principal debtor • Principal debtor’s setoffs against creditor Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 593  The following are defenses of both principal debtor and surety: • Material breach by creditor • Lack of mutual assent, failure of consideration • Creditor’s fraud, duress, or misrepresentation of debtor • Impossibility or illegality of performance • Material and fraudulent alteration of the contract • Statute of limitations The following are defenses of surety only: • Fraud or duress by creditor on surety Illegality of suretyship contract o Surety’s incapacity o Failure of consideration for surety contract (unless excused) o Statute of frauds o Acts of creditor or debtor materially affecting surety’s obligations: o  Refusal by creditor to accept tender of performance  Release of principal debtor without surety’s consent  Release of surety  Release, surrender, destruction, or impairment of collateral  Extension of time on principal debtor’s obligation  Modification of debtor’s duties, place, amount, or manner of debtor’s obligations KEY TAKEAWAY Creditors often require not only the security of collateral from the debtor but also that the debtor engage a surety.
A contract of suretyship is a type of insurance policy, where the surety (insurance company) promises the creditor that if the principal debtor fails to perform, the surety will undertake good-faith performance instead.
A difference between insurance and suretyship, though, is that the surety is entitled to reimbursement by the principal debtor if the surety pays out.
The surety is also entitled, where appropriate, to exoneration, subrogation, and contribution.
The principal debtor and the surety both have some defenses Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 594  available: some are personal to the debtor, some are joint defenses, and some are personal to the surety.

Findings of Fact The [debtor] purchased from the Rike-Kumler Company, on July 7, 1964, the diamond ring in question, for $1237.35 [about $8,500 in 2010 dollars], as an engagement ring for his fiancée.
He executed a purchase money security agreement, which was not filed.
Also, no financing statement was filed.
The chattel was adequately described in the security agreement.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 595  The controversy is between the trustee in bankruptcy and the party claiming a perfected security interest in the property.
The recipient of the property has terminated her relationship with the [debtor], and delivered the property to the trustee.
Conclusion of Law, Decision, and Order If the diamond ring, purchased as an engagement ring by the bankrupt, cannot be categorized as consumer goods, and therefore exempted from the notice filing requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in Ohio, a perfected security interest does not exist.
No judicial precedents have been cited in the briefs.
Under the commercial code, collateral is divided into tangible, intangible, and documentary categories.
Certainly, a diamond ring falls into the tangible category.
The classes of tangible goods are distinguished by the primary use intended.
Under [the UCC] the four classes [include] “consumer goods,” “equipment,” “farm products” and “inventory.” The difficulty is that the code provisions use terms arising in commercial circles which have different semantical values from legal precedents.
Does the fact that the purchaser bought the goods as a special gift to another person signify that it was not for his own “personal, family or household purposes”?
The trustee urges that these special facts control under the express provisions of the commercial code.
By a process of exclusion, a diamond engagement ring purchased for one’s fiancée is not “equipment” bought or used in business, “farm products” used in farming operations, or “inventory” held for sale, lease or service contracts.
When the [debtor] purchased the ring, therefore, it could only have been “consumer goods” bought “primarily for personal use.” There could be no judicial purpose to create a special class of property in derogation of the statutory principles.
Another problem is implicit, although not covered by the briefs.
By the foregoing summary analysis, it is apparent that the diamond ring, when the interest of the debtor attached, was consumer goods since it could have been no other class of goods.
Unless the fiancée had a special status under the code provision protecting a bona fide buyer, without knowledge, for value, of consumer goods, the failure to file a financing statement is not crucial.
No evidence has been adduced pertinent to the scienter question.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 596  Is a promise, as valid contractual consideration, included under the term “value”?
In other words, was the ring given to his betrothed in consideration of marriage (promise for a promise)?
If so, and “value” has been given, the transferee is a “buyer” under traditional concepts.
The Uniform Commercial Code definition of “value”…very definitely covers a promise for a promise.
The definition reads that “a person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them…generally in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.” It would seem unrealistic, nevertheless, to apply contract law concepts historically developed into the law of marriage relations in the context of new concepts developed for uniform commercial practices.
They are not, in reality, the same juristic manifold.
The purpose of uniformity of the code should not be defeated by the obsessions of the code drafters to be all inclusive for secured creditors.
Even if the trustee, in behalf of the unsecured creditors, would feel inclined to insert love, romance and morals into commercial law, he is appearing in the wrong era, and possibly the wrong court.
Ordered, that the Rike-Kumler Company holds a perfected security interest in the diamond engagement ring, and the security interest attached to the proceeds realized from the sale of the goods by the trustee in bankruptcy.

Why didn’t the jewelry store, Rike-Kumler, file a financing statement to protect its security interest in the ring?
2.
How did the bankruptcy trustee get the ring?
3.
What argument did the trustee make as to why he should be able to take the ring as an asset belonging to the estate of the debtor?

Repossession and Breach of the Peace Pantoja-Cahue v. Ford Motor Credit Co. 872 N.E.2d 1039 (Ill. App.
2007) Plaintiff Mario Pantoja-Cahue filed a six-count complaint seeking damages from defendant Ford Motor Credit Company for Ford’s alleged breach of the peace and “illegal activities” in repossessing plaintiff’s automobile from his locked garage.… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 597  In August 2000, plaintiff purchased a 2000 Ford Explorer from auto dealer Webb Ford.
Plaintiff, a native Spanish speaker, negotiated the purchase with a Spanish-speaking salesperson at Webb.
Plaintiff signed what he thought was a contract for the purchase and financing of the vehicle, with monthly installment payments to be made to Ford.
The contract was in English.
Some years later, plaintiff discovered the contract was actually a lease, not a purchase agreement.
Plaintiff brought suit against Ford and Webb on August 22, 2003, alleging fraud.
Ford brought a replevin action against plaintiff asserting plaintiff was in default on his obligations under the lease.
In the late night/early morning hours of March 11–12, 2004, repossession agents [from Doe Repossession Services] entered plaintiff’s locked garage and removed the car… Plaintiff sought damages for Ford and Doe’s “unlawful activities surrounding the wrongful repossession of Plaintiff’s vehicle.” He alleged Ford and Doe’s breaking into plaintiff’s locked garage to effectuate the repossession and Ford’s repossession of the vehicle knowing that title to the car was the subject of ongoing litigation variously violated section 2A-525(3) of the [Uniform Commercial] Code (count I against Ford), the [federal] Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (count II against Doe),…Ford’s contract with plaintiff (count V against Ford) and section 2A-108 of the Code (count VI against Ford and Doe).… Uniform Commercial Code Section 2A-525(3) In count I, plaintiff alleged “a breach of the peace occurred as [Ford]’s repossession agent broke into Plaintiff’s locked garage in order to take the vehicle” and Ford’s agent “repossessed the subject vehicle by, among other things, breaking into Plaintiff’s locked garage and causing substantial damage to Plaintiff’s personal property in violation of [section 2A-525(3)]”: “After a default by the lessee under the lease contract * * * or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor has the right to take possession of the goods.
* * * The lessor may proceed under subsection (2) without judicial process if it can be done without breach of the peace or the lessor may proceed by action.” [emphasis added.]
[U]pon a lessee’s default, a lessor has the right to repossess the leased goods in one of two ways: by using the judicial process or, if repossession could be accomplished without a breach of the peace, by self-help [UCC Section 2A-525(3)].
“If a breach of the peace is likely, a properly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 598  instituted civil action is the appropriate remedy.” [Citation] (interpreting the term “breach of the peace” in the context of section 9-503 of the Code, which provides for the same self-help repossession as section 2A-525 but for secured creditors rather than lessors).
Taking plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations as true, Ford resorted to self-help, by employing an agent to repossess the car and Ford’s agent broke into plaintiff’s locked garage to effectuate the repossession.
Although plaintiff’s count I allegations are minimal, they are sufficient to plead a cause of action for a violation of section 2A-525(3) if breaking into a garage to repossess a car is, as plaintiff alleged, a breach of the peace.
Accordingly, the question here is whether breaking into a locked garage to effectuate a repossession is a breach of the peace in violation of section 2A-525(3).
There are no Illinois cases analyzing the meaning of the term “breach of the peace” as used in the lessor repossession context in section 2A-525(3).
However, there are a few Illinois cases analyzing the term as used in section 9-503 of the Code, which contains a similar provision providing that a secured creditor may, upon default by a debtor, repossess its collateral either “(1) pursuant to judicial process; or (2) without judicial process, if it proceeds without breach of the peace.” The seminal case, and the only one of any use in resolving the issue, is Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Koontz, 277 Ill.App.3d 1078, 214 Ill.Dec.
726, 661 N.E.2d 1171 (1996).
In Koontz, Chrysler, the defendant creditor, sent repossession agents to repossess the plaintiff’s car after the plaintiff defaulted on his payments.
The car was parked in the plaintiff’s front yard.
The plaintiff heard the repossession in progress and ran outside in his underwear shouting “Don’t take it” to the agents.
The agents did not respond and proceeded to take the car.
The plaintiff argued the repossession breached the peace and he was entitled to the statutory remedy for violation of section 9-503, denial of a deficiency judgment to the secured party, Chrysler.… After a thorough analysis of the term “breach of the peace,” the court concluded the term “connotes conduct which incites or is likely to incite immediate public turbulence, or which leads to or is likely to lead to an immediate loss of public order and tranquility.
Violent conduct is not a necessary element.
The probability of violence at the time of or immediately prior to the repossession is sufficient.”…[The Koontz court] held the circumstances of the repossession did not amount to a breach the peace.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 599  The court then considered the plaintiff’s argument that Chrysler breached the peace by repossessing the car under circumstances constituting criminal trespass to property.
Looking to cases in other jurisdictions, the court determined that, “in general, a mere trespass, standing alone, does not automatically constitute a breach of the peace.” [Citation] (taking possession of car from private driveway does not, without more, constitute breach of the peace), [Citation] (no breach of the peace occurred where car repossessed from debtor’s driveway without entering “any gates, doors, or other barricades to reach” car), [Citation] (no breach of the peace occurred where car was parked partially under carport and undisputed that no door, “not even one to a garage,” on the debtor’s premises was opened, much less broken, to repossess the car), [Citation] (although secured party may not break into or enter homes or buildings or enclosed spaces to effectuate a repossession, repossession of vehicle from parking lot of debtor’s apartment building was not breach of the peace), [Citation] (repossession of car from debtor’s driveway without entering any gates, doors or other barricades was accomplished without breach of the peace).… Although the evidence showed the plaintiff notified Chrysler prior to the repossession that it was not permitted onto his property, the court held Chrysler’s entry onto the property to take the car did not constitute a breach of the peace because there was no evidence Chrysler entered through a barricade or did anything other than drive the car away.
[Citation] “Chrysler enjoyed a limited privilege to enter [the plaintiff’s] property for the sole and exclusive purpose of effectuating the repossession.
So long as the entry was limited in purpose (repossession), and so long as no gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, buildings, or chains were breached or cut, no breach of the peace occurred by virtue of the entry onto his property.” …[W]e come to essentially the same conclusion: where a repossession is effectuated by an actual breaking into the lessee/debtor’s premises or breaching or cutting of chains, gates, barricades, doors or other barriers designed to exclude trespassers, the likelihood that a breach of the peace occurred is high.
Davenport v. Chrysler Credit Corp., [Citation] (Tenn.App.1991), a case analyzing Tennessee’s version of section 9-503 is particularly helpful, holding that “‘[a] breach of the peace is almost certain to be found if the repossession is accompanied by the unauthorized entry into a closed or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 600  locked garage.’”…This is so because “public policy favors peaceful, non-trespassory repossessions when the secured party has a free right of entry” and “forced entries onto the debtor’s property or into the debtor’s premises are viewed as seriously detrimental to the ordinary conduct of human affairs.” Davenportheld that the creditor’s repossession of a car by entering a closed garage and cutting a chain that would have prevented it from removing the car amounted to a breach of the peace, “[d]espite the absence of violence or physical confrontation” (because the debtor was not at home when the repossession occurred).
Davenport recognized that the secured creditors’ legitimate interest in obtaining possession of collateral without having to resort to expensive and cumbersome judicial procedures must be balanced against the debtors’ legitimate interest in being free from unwarranted invasions of their property and privacy interests.
“Repossession is a harsh procedure and is, essentially, a delegation of the State’s exclusive prerogative to resolve disputes.
Accordingly, the statutes governing the repossession of collateral should be construed in a way that prevents abuse and discourages illegal conduct which might otherwise go unchallenged because of the debtor’s lack of knowledge of legally proper repossession techniques” [Citation].
We agree with [this] analysis of the term “breach of the peace” in the context of repossession and hold, with regard to section 2A-525(3) of the Code, that breaking into a locked garage to effectuate a repossession may constitute a breach of the peace.
Here, plaintiff alleges more than simply a trespass.
He alleges Ford, through Doe, broke into his garage to repossess the car.
Given our determination that breaking into a locked garage to repossess a car may constitute a breach of the peace, plaintiff’s allegation is sufficient to state a cause of action under section 2A-525(3) of the Code.
The court erred in dismissing count I of plaintiff’s second amended complaint and we remand for further proceedings.
Uniform Commercial Code Section 2A-108 In count VI, plaintiff alleged the lease agreement was unconscionable because it was formed in violation of [the Illinois Consumer Fraud Statute, requiring that the customer verify that the negotiations were conducted in the consumer’s native language and that the document was Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 601  translated so the customer understood it.
]…Plaintiff does not quote [this] or explain how the agreement violates [it].
Instead, he quotes UCC section 2A-108 of the Code, as follows: “With respect to a consumer lease, if the court as a matter of law finds that a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract has been induced by unconscionable conduct or that unconscionable conduct has occurred in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract, the court may grant appropriate relief.
Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the lease contract or clause thereof, or of the conduct.” He then, in “violation one” under count VI, alleges the lease was made in violation of [the Illinois Consumer Fraud Statute] because it was negotiated in Spanish but he was only given a copy of the contract in English; he could not read the contract and, as a result, Webb Ford was able to trick him into signing a lease, rather than a purchase agreement; such contract was induced by unconscionable conduct; and, because it was illegal, the contract was unenforceable.
This allegation is insufficient to state a cause of action against Ford under section 2A- 108.…First, Ford is an entirely different entity than Webb Ford and plaintiff does not assert otherwise.
Nor does plaintiff assert that Webb Ford was acting as Ford’s agent in inducing plaintiff to sign the lease.
Plaintiff asserts no basis on which Ford can be found liable for something Webb Ford did.
Second, there is no allegation as to how the contract violates [the statute], merely the legal conclusion that it does, as well as the unsupported legal conclusion that a violation of [it] is necessarily unconscionable.…[Further discussion omitted.]
For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court’s dismissal of counts IV, V and VI of plaintiff’s second amended complaint.
We reverse the court’s dismissal of count I and remand for further proceedings.
Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Under what circumstances, if any, would breaking into a locked garage to repossess a car not be considered a breach of the peace?
2.
The court did not decide that a breach of the peace had occurred.

4.
What alternatives had Ford besides taking the car from the plaintiff’s locked garage?

Defenses of the Principal Debtor as against Reimbursement to Surety Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co. 338 Fed.Appx.
886, 11th Cir.
Ct. (2009) Per Curium: [1] The Georgia Department of Transportation (“GDOT”) contracted with Douglas Asphalt Company to perform work on an interstate highway.
After Douglas Asphalt allegedly failed to pay its suppliers and subcontractors and failed to perform under the contract, GDOT defaulted and terminated Douglas Asphalt.
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland and Zurich American Insurance Company had executed payment and performance bonds in connection with Douglas Asphalt’s work on the interstate, and after Douglas Asphalt’s default, Fidelity and Zurich spent $15,424,798 remedying the default.
Fidelity and Zurich, seeking to recover their losses related to their remedy of the default, brought this suit against Douglas Asphalt, Joel Spivey, and Ronnie Spivey.
The Spiveys and Douglas Asphalt had executed a General Indemnity Agreement in favor of Fidelity and Zurich.
[2] After a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Fidelity and Zurich for $16,524,798.
Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys now appeal.
Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of Fidelity and Zurich because Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith in three ways.
First, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in not finding that Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith because they claimed excessive costs to remedy the default.
Specifically, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that they introduced evidence that the interstate project was 98% complete, and that only approximately $3.6 million was needed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 603  to remedy any default.
But, the district court found that the interstate project was only 90%– 92% complete and that approximately $2 million needed to be spent to correct defective work already done by Douglas Asphalt.
Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys have not shown that the district court’s finding was clearly erroneous, and accordingly, their argument that Fidelity and Zurich showed bad faith in claiming that the project was only 90% complete and therefore required over $15 million to remedy the default fails.
Second, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith by failing to contest the default.
However, the district court concluded that the indemnity agreement required Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys to request a contest of the default, and to post collateral security to pay any judgment rendered in the course of contesting the default.
The court’s finding that Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys made no such request and posted no collateral security was not clearly erroneous, and the sureties had no independent duty to investigate a default.
Accordingly, Fidelity and Zurich’s failure to contest the default does not show bad faith.
Finally, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich’s refusal to permit them to remain involved with the interstate project, either as a contractor or consultant, was evidence of bad faith.
Yet, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys did not direct the district court or this court to any case law that holds that the refusal to permit a defaulting contractor to continue working on a project is bad faith.
As the district court concluded, Fidelity and Zurich had a contractual right to take possession of all the work under the contract and arrange for its completion.
Fidelity and Zurich exercised that contractual right, and, as the district court noted, the exercise of a contractual right is not evidence of bad faith.
Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Why were Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys supposed to pay the sureties nearly $15.5 million?
2.
What did the plaintiffs claim the defendant sureties did wrong as relates to how much money they spent to cure the default?
3.
What is a “contest of the default”?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 604  4.
Why would the sureties probably not want the principal involved in the project?

[2] They promised to reimburse the surety for its expenses and hold it harmless for further liability.
16.6 Summary and Exercises Summary The law governing security interests in personal property is Article 9 of the UCC, which defines a security interest as an interest in personal property or fixtures that secures payment or performance of an obligation.
Article 9 lumps together all the former types of security devices, including the pledge, chattel mortgage, and conditional sale.
Five types of tangible property may serve as collateral: (1) consumer goods, (2) equipment, (3) farm products, (4) inventory, and (5) fixtures.
Five types of intangibles may serve as collateral: (1) accounts, (2) general intangibles (e.g., patents), (3) documents of title, (4) chattel paper, and (5) instruments.
Article 9 expressly permits the debtor to give a security interest in after- acquired collateral.
To create an enforceable security interest, the lender and borrower must enter into an agreement establishing the interest, and the lender must follow steps to ensure that the security interest first attaches and then is perfected.
There are three general requirements for attachment: (1) there must be an authenticated agreement (or the collateral must physically be in the lender’s possession), (2) the lender must have given value, and (3) the debtor must have some rights in the collateral.
Once the interest attaches, the lender has rights in the collateral superior to those of unsecured creditors.
But others may defeat his interest unless he perfects the security interest.
The three common ways of doing so are (1) filing a financing statement, (2) pledging collateral, and (3) taking a purchase-money security interest (PMSI) in consumer goods.
A financing statement is a simple notice, showing the parties’ names and addresses, the signature of the debtor, and an adequate description of the collateral.
The financing statement, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 605  effective for five years, must be filed in a public office; the location of the office varies among the states.
Security interests in instruments and negotiable documents can be perfected only by the secured party’s taking possession, with twenty-one-day grace periods applicable under certain circumstances.
Goods may also be secured through pledging, which is often done through field warehousing.
If a seller of consumer goods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection is automatic and no filing is required, although the lender may file and probably should, to avoid losing seniority to a bona fide purchaser of consumer goods without knowledge of the security interest, if the goods are used for personal, family, or household purposes.
The general priority rule is “first in time, first in right.” Priority dates from the earlier of two events: (1) filing a financing statement covering the collateral or (2) other perfection of the security interest.
Several exceptions to this rule arise when creditors take a PMSI, among them, when a buyer in the ordinary course of business takes free of a security interest created by the seller.
On default, a creditor may repossess the collateral.
For the most part, self-help private repossession continues to be lawful but risky.
After repossession, the lender may sell the collateral or accept it in satisfaction of the debt.
Any excess in the selling price above the debt amount must go to the debtor.
Suretyship is a legal relationship that is created when one person contracts to be responsible for the proper fulfillment of another’s obligation, in case the latter (the principal debtor) fails to fulfill it.
The surety may avail itself of the principal’s contract defenses, but under various circumstances, defenses may be available to the one that are not available to the other.
One general defense often raised by sureties is alteration of the contract.
If the surety is required to perform, it has rights for reimbursement against the principal, including interest and legal fees; and if there is more than one surety, each standing for part of the obligation, one who pays a disproportionate part may seek contribution from the others.
EXERCISES 1.
Kathy Knittle borrowed $20,000 from Bank to buy inventory to sell in her knit shop and signed a security agreement listing as collateral the entire present and future inventory in the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 606  shop, including proceeds from the sale of inventory.
Bank filed no financing statement.
A month later, Knittle borrowed $5,000 from Creditor, who was aware of Bank’s security interest.
Knittle then declared bankruptcy.
Who has priority, Bank or Creditor?
2.
Assume the same facts as in Exercise 1, except Creditor—again, aware of Bank’s security interest—filed a financing statement to perfect its interest.
Who has priority, Bank or Creditor?
3.
Harold and Wilma are married.
First Bank has a mortgage on their house, and it covers after- acquired property.
Because Harold has a new job requiring travel to neighboring cities, they purchase a second car for Wilma’s normal household use, financed by Second Bank.
They sign a security agreement; Second Bank files nothing.
If they were to default on their house payments, First Bank could repossess the house; could it repossess the car, too?
4. a. Kathy Knittle borrowed $20,000 from Bank to buy inventory to sell in her knit shop and signed a security agreement listing her collateral—present and future— as security for the loan.
Carlene Customer bought yarn and a tabletop loom from Knittle.
Shortly thereafter, Knittle declared bankruptcy.
Can Bank get the loom from Customer?
b.
Assume that the facts are similar to those in Exercise 4a, except that the loom that Knittle sold had been purchased from Larry Loomaker, who had himself given a secured interest in it (and the other looms he manufactured) from Fine Lumber Company (FLC) to finance the purchase of the lumber to make the looms.
Customer bought the loom from Knittle (unaware of Loomaker’s situation); Loomaker failed to pay FLC.
Why can FLC repossess the loom from Customer?
c. What recourse does Customer have now?
Creditor loaned Debtor $30,000 with the provision that the loan was callable by Creditor with sixty days’ notice to Debtor.
Debtor, having been called for repayment, asked for a ninety-day extension, which Creditor assented to, provided that Debtor would put up a surety to secure repayment.
Surety agreed to serve as surety.
When Debtor defaulted, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 607  Creditor turned to Surety for payment.
Surety asserted that Creditor had given no consideration for Surety’s promise, and therefore Surety was not bound.
Is Surety correct?
a. Mrs.
Ace said to University Bookstore: “Sell the books to my daughter.
I’ll pay for them.” When University Bookstore presented Mrs.
Ace a statement for $900, she refused to pay, denying she’d ever promised to do so, and she raised the statute of frauds as a defense.
Is this a good defense?
b.
Defendant ran a stop sign and crashed into Plaintiff’s car, causing $8,000 damage.
Plaintiff’s attorney orally negotiated with Defendant’s insurance company, Goodhands Insurance, to settle the case.
Subsequently, Goodhands denied liability and refused to pay, and it raised the statute of frauds as a defense, asserting that any promise by it to pay for its insured’s negligence would have to be in writing to be enforceable under the statute’s suretyship clause.
Is Goodhands’s defense valid?
a.
First Bank has a security interest in equipment owned by Kathy Knittle in her Knit Shop.
If Kathy defaults on her loan and First Bank lawfully repossesses, what are the bank’s options?
Explain.
b.
Suppose, instead, that First Bank had a security interest in Kathy’s home knitting machine, worth $10,000.
She paid $6,200 on the machine and then defaulted.
Now what are the bank’s options?

Understand how the mortgage is created.
Having discussed in Chapter 16 "Secured Transactions and Suretyship" security interests in personal property and suretyship—two of the three common types of consensual security arrangements—we turn now to the third type of consensual security arrangement, the mortgage.
We also discuss briefly various forms of nonconsensual liens (see Figure 17.1 "Security Arrangements").
Figure 17.1 Security Arrangements Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 610  Definitions A mortgage is a means of securing a debt with real estate.
A long time ago, the mortgage was considered an actual transfer of title, to become void if the debt was paid off.
The modern view, held in most states, is that the mortgage is but a lien, giving the holder, in the event of default, the right to sell the property and repay the debt from the proceeds.
The person giving the mortgage is the mortgagor, or borrower.
In the typical home purchase, that’s the buyer.
The buyer needs to borrow to finance the purchase; in exchange for the money with which to pay the seller, the buyer “takes out a mortgage” with, say, a bank.
The lender is the mortgagee, the person or institution holding the mortgage, with the right to foreclose on the property if the debt is not timely paid.
Although the law of real estate mortgages is different from the set of rules in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that we examined in Chapter 16 "Secured Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 611  Transactions and Suretyship", the circumstances are the same, except that the security is real estate rather than personal property (secured transactions) or the promise of another (suretyship).
The Uses of Mortgages Most frequently, we think of a mortgage as a device to fund a real estate purchase: for a homeowner to buy her house, or for a commercial entity to buy real estate (e.g., an office building), or for a person to purchase farmland.
But the value in real estate can be mortgaged for almost any purpose (a home equity loan): a person can take out a mortgage on land to fund a vacation.
Indeed, during the period leading up to the recession in 2007–08, a lot of people borrowed money on their houses to buy things: boats, new cars, furniture, and so on.
Unfortunately, it turned out that some of the real estate used as collateral was overvalued: when the economy weakened and people lost income or their jobs, they couldn’t make the mortgage payments.
And, to make things worse, the value of the real estate sometimes sank too, so that the debtors owed more on the property than it was worth (that’s called being underwater).
They couldn’t sell without taking a loss, and they couldn’t make the payments.
Some debtors just walked away, leaving the banks with a large number of houses, commercial buildings, and even shopping centers on their hands.
Short History of Mortgage Law The mortgage has ancient roots, but the form we know evolved from the English land law in the Middle Ages.
Understanding that law helps to understand modern mortgage law.
In the fourteenth century, the mortgage was a deed that actually transferred title to the mortgagee.
If desired, the mortgagee could move into the house, occupy the property, or rent it out.
But because the mortgage obligated him to apply to the mortgage debt whatever rents he collected, he seldom ousted the mortgagor.
Moreover, the mortgage set a specific date (the “law day”) on which the debt was to be repaid.
If the mortgagor did so, the mortgage became void and the mortgagor was entitled to recover the property.
If the mortgagor failed to pay the debt, the property automatically vested in the mortgagee.
No further proceedings were necessary.
This law was severe.
A day’s delay in paying the debt, for any reason, forfeited the land, and the courts strictly enforced the mortgage.
The only possible relief was a petition to the king, who Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 612  over time referred these and other kinds of petitions to the courts of equity.
At first fitfully, and then as a matter of course (by the seventeenth century), the equity courts would order the mortgagee to return the land when the mortgagor stood ready to pay the debt plus interest.
Thus a new right developed: the equitable right of redemption, known for short as the equity of redemption.
In time, the courts held that this equity of redemption was a form of property right; it could be sold and inherited.
This was a powerful right: no matter how many years later, the mortgagor could always recover his land by proffering a sum of money.
Understandably, mortgagees did not warm to this interpretation of the law, because their property rights were rendered insecure.
They tried to defeat the equity of redemption by having mortgagors waive and surrender it to the mortgagees, but the courts voided waiver clauses as a violation of public policy.
Hence a mortgage, once a transfer of title, became a security for debt.
A mortgage as such can never be converted into a deed of title.
The law did not rest there.
Mortgagees won a measure of relief in the development of the foreclosure.
On default, the mortgagee would seek a court order giving the mortgagor a fixed time—perhaps six months or a year—within which to pay off the debt; under the court decree, failure meant that the mortgagor was forever foreclosed from asserting his right of redemption.
This strict foreclosure gave the mortgagee outright title at the end of the time period.
In the United States today, most jurisdictions follow a somewhat different approach: the mortgagee forecloses by forcing a public sale at auction.
Proceeds up to the amount of the debt are the mortgagee’s to keep; surplus is paid over to the mortgagor.Foreclosure by sale is the usual procedure in the United States.
At bottom, its theory is that a mortgage is a lien on land.
(Foreclosure issues are further discussed in Section 17.2 "Priority, Termination of the Mortgage, and Other Methods of Using Real Estate as Security".)
Under statutes enacted in many states, the mortgagor has one last chance to recover his property, even after foreclosure.
This statutory right of redemption extends the period to repay, often by one year.
Creation of the Mortgage Statutory Regulation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 613  The decision whether to lend money and take a mortgage is affected by several federal and state regulations.
Consumer Credit Statutes Apply Statutes dealing with consumer credit transactions have a bearing on the mortgage, including state usury statutes, and the federal Truth in Lending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Other federal statutes are directed more specifically at mortgage lending.
One, enacted in 1974, is the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), aimed at abuses in the settlement process—the process of obtaining the mortgage and purchasing a residence.
The act covers all federally related first mortgage loans secured by residential properties for one to four families.
It requires the lender to disclose information about settlement costs in advance of the closing day: it prohibits the lender from “springing” unexpected or hidden costs onto the borrower.
The RESPA is a US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) consumer protection statute designed to help home buyers be better shoppers in the home-buying process, and it is enforced by HUD.
It also outlaws what had been a common practice of giving and accepting kickbacks and referral fees.
The act prohibits lenders from requiring mortgagors to use a particular company to obtain insurance, and it limits add-on fees the lender can demand to cover future insurance and tax charges.
Redlining.
Several statutes are directed to the practice of redlining—the refusal of lenders to make loans on property in low-income neighborhoods or impose stricter mortgage terms when they do make loans there.
(The term derives from the supposition that lenders draw red lines on maps around ostensibly marginal neighborhoods.)
The most important of these is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977.
[1] The act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operation.
To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA compliance and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions.
The information is compiled under the authority of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 614  within its purview to report annually by transmitting information from their loan application registers to a federal agency.
The Note and the Mortgage Documents The note and the mortgage documents are the contracts that set up the deal: the mortgagor gets credit, and the mortgagee gets the right to repossess the property in case of default.
The Note If the lender decides to grant a mortgage, the mortgagor signs two critical documents at the closing: the note and the mortgage.
It is enough here to recall that in a note (really a type of IOU), the mortgagor promises to pay a specified principal sum, plus interest, by a certain date or dates.
The note is the underlying obligation for which the mortgage serves as security.
Without the note, the mortgagee would have an empty document, since the mortgage would secure nothing.
Without a mortgage, a note is still quite valid, evidencing the debtor’s personal obligation.
One particular provision that usually appears in both mortgages and the underlying notes is the acceleration clause.
This provides that if a debtor should default on any particular payment, the entire principal and interest will become due immediately at the lender’s option.
Why an acceleration clause?
Without it, the lender would be powerless to foreclose the entire mortgage when the mortgagor defaulted but would have to wait until the expiration of the note’s term.
Although the acceleration clause is routine, it will not be enforced unless the mortgagee acts in an equitable and fair manner.
The problem arises where the mortgagor’s default was the result of some unconscionable conduct of the mortgagee, such as representing to the mortgagee that she might take a sixty-day “holiday” from having to make payments.
In Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group (Section 17.4 "Cases"), the equitable powers of the court were invoked to prevent acceleration.
The Mortgage Under the statute of frauds, the mortgage itself must be evidenced by some writing to be enforceable.
The mortgagor will usually make certain promises and warranties to the mortgagee and state the amount and terms of the debt and the mortgagor’s duties concerning taxes, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 615  insurance, and repairs.
A sample mortgage form is presented inFigure 17.2 "Sample Mortgage Form".
Figure 17.2 Sample Mortgage Form Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 616  KEY TAKEAWAY As a mechanism of security, a mortgage is a promise by the debtor (mortgagor) to repay the creditor (mortgagee) for the amount borrowed or credit extended, with real estate put up as security.
If the mortgagor doesn’t pay as promised, the mortgagee may repossess the real estate.
Mortgage law has ancient roots and brings with it various permutations on the theme that even if the mortgagor defaults, she may nevertheless have the right to get the property Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 617  back or at least be reimbursed for any value above that necessary to pay the debt and the expenses of foreclosure.
Mortgage law is regulated by state and federal statute.

17.2 Priority, Termination of the Mortgage, and Other Methods of Using Real Estate as Security LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand why it is important that the mortgagee (creditor) record her interest in the debtor’s real estate.
2.
Know the basic rule of priority—who gets an interest in the property first in case of default— and the exceptions to the rule.
3.
Recognize the three ways mortgages can be terminated: payment, assumption, and foreclosure.
4.
Be familiar with other methods (besides mortgages) by which real property can be used as security for a creditor.
Priorities in Real Property Security You may recall from Chapter 16 "Secured Transactions and Suretyship" how important it is for a creditor to perfect its secured interest in the goods put up as collateral.
Absent perfection, the creditor stands a chance of losing out to another creditor who took its interest in the goods subsequent to the first creditor.
The same problem is presented in real property security: the mortgagee wants to make sure it has first claim on the property in case the mortgagor (debtor) defaults.
The General Rule of Priorities Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 618  The general rule of priority is the same for real property security as for personal property security: the first in time to give notice of the secured interest is first in right.
For real property, the notice is by recording the mortgage.
Recording is the act of giving public notice of changes in interests in real estate.
Recording was created by statute; it did not exist at common law.
The typical recording statute calls for a transfer of title or mortgage to be placed in a particular county office, usually the auditor, recorder, or register of deeds.
A mortgage is valid between the parties whether or not it is recorded, but a mortgagee might lose to a third party—another mortgagee or a good-faith purchaser of the property—unless the mortgage is recorded.
Exceptions to the General Rule There are exceptions to the general rule; two are taken up here.
Fixture Filing The fixture-filing provision in Article 9 of the UCC is one exception to the general rule.
As noted in Chapter 16 "Secured Transactions and Suretyship", the UCC gives priority to purchase-money security interests in fixtures if certain requirements are met.
Future Advances A bank might make advances to the debtor after accepting the mortgage.
If the future advances are obligatory, then the first-in-time rule applies.
For example: Bank accepts Debtor’s mortgage (and records it) and extends a line of credit on which Debtor draws, up to a certain limit.
(Or, as in the construction industry, Bank might make periodic advances to the contractors as work progresses, backed by the mortgage.)
Second Creditor loans Debtor money—secured by the same property—before Debtor began to draw against the first line of credit.
Bank has priority: by searching the mortgage records, Second Creditor should have been on notice that the first mortgage was intended as security for the entire line of credit, although the line was doled out over time.
However, if the future advances are not obligatory, then priority is determined by notice.
For example, a bank might take a mortgage as security for an original loan and for any future loans that the bank chooses to make.
A later creditor can achieve priority by notifying the bank with the first mortgage that it is making an advance.
Suppose Jimmy mortgages his property to a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 619  wealthy dowager, Mrs. Calabash, in return for an immediate loan of $20,000 and they agree that the mortgage will serve as security for future loans to be arranged.
The mortgage is recorded.
A month later, before Mrs. Calabash loans him any more money, Jimmy gives a second mortgage to Louella in return for a loan of $10,000.
Louella notifies Mrs. Calabash that she is loaning Jimmy the money.
A month later, Mrs. Calabash loans Jimmy another $20,000.
Jimmy then defaults, and the property turns out to be worth only $40,000.
Whose claims will be honored and in what order?
Mrs. Calabash will collect her original $20,000, because it was recited in the mortgage and the mortgage was recorded.
Louella will collect her $10,000 next, because she notified the first mortgage holder of the advance.
That leaves Mrs. Calabash in third position to collect what she can of her second advance.
Mrs. Calabash could have protected herself by refusing the second loan.
Termination of the Mortgage The mortgagor’s liability can terminate in three ways: payment, assumption (with a novation), or foreclosure.
Payment Unless they live in the home for twenty-five or thirty years, the mortgagors usually pay off the mortgage when the property is sold.
Occasionally, mortgages are paid off in order to refinance.
If the mortgage was taken out at a time of high interest rates and rates later drop, the homeowner might want to obtain a new mortgage at the lower rates.
In many mortgages, however, this entails extra closing costs and penalties for prepaying the original mortgage.
Whatever the reason, when a mortgage is paid off, the discharge should be recorded.
This is accomplished by giving the mortgagor a copy of, and filing a copy of, a Satisfaction of Mortgage document.
In the Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group case (Section 17.4 "Cases"), the bank mistakenlyfiled the Satisfaction of Mortgage document, later discovered its mistake, retracted the satisfaction, accelerated the loan because the mortgagor stopped making payments (the bank, seeing no record of an outstanding mortgage, refused to accept payments), and then tried to foreclose on the mortgage, meanwhile having lost the note and mortgage besides.
Assumption Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 620  The property can be sold without paying off the mortgage if the mortgage is assumed by the new buyer, who agrees to pay the seller’s (the original mortgagor’s) debt.
This is a novation if, in approving the assumption, the bank releases the old mortgagor and substitutes the buyer as the new debtor.
The buyer need not assume the mortgage.
If the buyer purchases the property without agreeing to be personally liable, this is a sale “subject to” the mortgage (see Figure 17.3 "“Subject to” Sales versus Assumption").
In the event of the seller’s subsequent default, the bank can foreclose the mortgage and sell the property that the buyer has purchased, but the buyer is not liable for any deficiency.
Figure 17.3 “Subject to” Sales versus Assumption Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 621  What if mortgage rates are high?
Can buyers assume an existing low-rate mortgage from the seller rather than be forced to obtain a new mortgage at substantially higher rates?
Banks, of course, would prefer not to allow that when interest rates are rising, so they often include in the mortgage a due-on-sale clause, by which the entire principal and interest become due when the property is sold, thus forcing the purchaser to get financing at the higher rates.
The clause is a device for preventing subsequent purchasers from assuming loans with lower-than-market Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 622  interest rates.
Although many state courts at one time refused to enforce the due-on-sale clause, Congress reversed this trend when it enacted the Garn–St.
Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982.
[1] The act preempts state laws and upholds the validity of due-on-sale clauses.
When interest rates are low, banks have no interest in enforcing such clauses, and there are ways to work around the due-on-sale clause.
Foreclosure The third method of terminating the mortgage is by foreclosure when a mortgagor defaults.
Even after default, the mortgagor has the right to exercise his equity of redemption—that is, to redeem the property by paying the principal and interest in full.
If he does not, the mortgagee may foreclose the equity of redemption.
Although strict foreclosure is used occasionally, in most cases the mortgagee forecloses by one of two types of sale (see Figure 17.4 "Foreclosure").
The first type is judicial sale.
The mortgagee seeks a court order authorizing the sale to be conducted by a public official, usually the sheriff.
The mortgagor is entitled to be notified of the proceeding and to a hearing.
The second type of sale is that conducted under a clause called a power of sale, which many lenders insist be contained in the mortgage.
This clause permits the mortgagee to sell the property at public auction without first going to court—although by custom or law, the sale must be advertised, and typically a sheriff or other public official conducts the public sale or auction.
Figure 17.4 Foreclosure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 623  Once the property has been sold, it is deeded to the new purchaser.
In about half the states, the mortgagor still has the right to redeem the property by paying up within six months or a year— the statutory redemption period.
Thereafter, the mortgagor has no further right to redeem.
If the sale proceeds exceed the debt, the mortgagor is entitled to the excess unless he has given second and third mortgages, in which case the junior mortgagees are entitled to recover their claims before the mortgagor.
If the proceeds are less than the debt, the mortgagee is entitled to recover the deficiency from the mortgagor.
However, some states have statutorily abolished deficiency judgments.
Other Methods of Using Real Estate as Security Besides the mortgage, there are other ways to use real estate as security.
Here we take up two: the deed of trust and the installment or land contract.
Deed of Trust The deed of trust is a device for securing a debt with real property; unlike the mortgage, it requires three parties: the borrower, the trustee, and the lender.
Otherwise, it is at base identical to a mortgage.
The borrower conveys the land to a third party, the trustee, to hold in trust for the lender until the borrower pays the debt.
(The trustee’s interest is really a kind of legal fiction: that person is expected to have no interest in the property.)
The primary benefit to the deed of trust is that it simplifies the foreclosure process by containing a provision empowering the trustee to sell the property on default, thus doing away with the need for any court filings.
The disinterested third party making sure things are done properly becomes the trustee, not a judge.
In thirty states and the District of Columbia—more than half of US jurisdictions—the deed of trust is usually used in lieu of mortgages.
[2] But the deed of trust may have certain disadvantages as well.
For example, when the debt has been fully paid, the trustee will not release the deed of trust until she sees that all notes secured by it have been marked canceled.
Should the borrower have misplaced the canceled notes or failed to keep good records, he will need to procure a surety bond to protect the trustee in case of a mistake.
This can be an expensive procedure.
In many jurisdictions, the mortgage holder is prohibited from seeking a deficiency judgment if the holder chooses to sell the property through nonjudicial means.
Alpha Imperial Building, LLC v. Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, Section 17.4 "Cases", discusses several issues involving deeds of trust.
Installment or Land Contract Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 624  Under the installment contract or land contract, the purchaser takes possession and agrees to pay the seller over a period of years.
Until the final payment, title belongs to the seller.
The contract will specify the type of deed to be conveyed at closing, the terms of payment, the buyer’s duty to pay taxes and insure the premises, and the seller’s right to accelerate on default.
The buyer’s particular concern in this type of sale is whether the seller in fact has title.
The buyers can protect themselves by requiring proof of title and title insurance when the contract is signed.
Moreover, the buyer should record the installment contract to protect against the seller’s attempt to convey title to an innocent third-party purchaser while the contract is in effect.
The benefit to the land contract is that the borrower need not bank-qualify, so the pool of available buyers is larger, and buyers who have inadequate resources at the time of contracting but who have the expectation of a rising income in the future are good candidates for the land contract.
Also, the seller gets all the interest paid by the buyer, instead of the bank getting it in the usual mortgage.
The obvious disadvantage from the seller’s point is that she will not get a big lump sum immediately: the payments trickle in over years (unless she can sell the contract to a third party, but that would be at a discount).
KEY TAKEAWAY The general rule on priority in real property security is that the first creditor to record its interest prevails over subsequent creditors.
There are some exceptions; the most familiar is that the seller of a fixture on a purchase-money security interest has priority over a previously recorded mortgagee.
The mortgage will terminate by payment, assumption by a new buyer (with a novation releasing the old buyer), and foreclosure.
In a judicial-sale foreclosure, a court authorizes the property’s sale; in a power-of-sale foreclosure, no court approval is required.
In most states, the mortgagor whose property was foreclosed is given some period of time—six months or a year—to redeem the property; otherwise, the sale is done, but the debtor may be liable for the deficiency, if any.
The deed of trust avoids any judicial involvement by having the borrower convey the land to a disinterested trustee for the benefit of the lender; the trustee sells it upon default, with the proceeds (after expenses) going to the lender.
Another method of real property security is a land contract: title shifts to the buyer only at the end of the term of payments.

17.3 Nonconsensual Lien LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand the nonconsensual liens issued by courts—attachment liens and judgment liens—and how they are created.
2.
Recognize other types of nonconsensual liens: mechanic’s lien, possessory lien, and tax lien.
The security arrangements discussed so far—security interests, suretyship, mortgages—are all obtained by the creditor with the debtor’s consent.
A creditor may obtain certain liens without the debtor’s consent.
Court-Decreed Liens Some nonconsensual liens are issued by courts.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 626  Attachment Lien An attachment lien is ordered against a person’s property—real or personal—to prevent him from disposing of it during a lawsuit.
To obtain an attachment lien, the plaintiff must show that the defendant likely will dispose of or hide his property; if the court agrees with the plaintiff, she must post a bond and the court will issue a writ of attachment to the sheriff, directing the sheriff to seize the property.
Attachments of real property should be recorded.
Should the plaintiff win her suit, the court issues a writ of execution, directing the sheriff to sell the property to satisfy the judgment.
Judgment Lien A judgment lien may be issued when a plaintiff wins a judgment in court if an attachment lien has not already been issued.
Like the attachment lien, it provides a method by which the defendant’s property may be seized and sold.
Mechanic’s Lien Overview The most common nonconsensual lien on real estate is the mechanic’s lien.
A mechanic’s lien can be obtained by one who furnishes labor, services, or materials to improve real estate: this is statutory, and the statute must be carefully followed.
The “mechanic” here is one who works with his or her hands, not specifically one who works on machines.
An automobile mechanic could not obtain a mechanic’s lien on a customer’s house to secure payment of work he did on her car.
(The lien to which the automobile mechanic is entitled is a “possessory lien” or “artisan’s lien,” considered inSection 17.3.3 "Possessory Lien") To qualify for a mechanic’s lien, the claimant must file a sworn statement describing the work done, the contract made, or the materials furnished that permanently improved the real estate.
A particularly difficult problem crops up when the owner has paid the contractor, who in turn fails to pay his subcontractors.
In many states, the subcontractors can file a lien on the owner’s property, thus forcing the owner to pay them (see Figure 17.5 "Subcontractors’ Lien")—and maybe twice.
To protect themselves, owners can demand a sworn statement from general contractors listing the subcontractors used on the job, and from them, owners can obtain a waiver of lien rights before paying the general contractor.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 627  Figure 17.5Subcontractors’ Lien Procedure for Obtaining a Mechanic’s Lien Anyone claiming a lien against real estate must record a lien statement stating the amount due and the nature of the improvement.
The lienor has a specified period of time (e.g., ninety days) to file from the time the work is finished.
Recording as such does not give the lienor an automatic right to the property if the debt remains unpaid.
All states specify a limited period of time, usually one year, within which the claimant must file suit to enforce the lien.
Only if the court decides the lien is valid may the property be sold to satisfy the debt.
Difficult questions sometimes arise when a lien is filed against a landlord’s property as a result of improvements and services provided to a tenant, as discussed in F & D Elec.
Contractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc.,Section 17.4 "Cases".
Mechanic’s Liens Priorities Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 628  A mechanic’s lien represents a special risk to the purchaser of real estate or to lenders who wish to take a mortgage.
In most states, the mechanic’s lien is given priority not from the date when the lien is recorded but from an earlier date—either the date the contractor was hired or the date construction began.
Thus a purchaser or lender might lose priority to a creditor with a mechanic’s lien who filed after the sale or mortgage.
A practical solution to this problem is to hold back part of the funds (purchase price or loan) or place them in escrow until the period for recording liens has expired.
Possessory Lien The most common nonconsensual lien on personal property (not real estate) is thepossessory lien.
This is the right to continue to keep the goods on which work has been performed or for which materials have been supplied until the owner pays for the labor or materials.
The possessory lien arises both under common law and under a variety of statutes.
Because it is nonconsensual, the possessory lien is not covered by Article 9 of the UCC, which is restricted to consensual security interests.
Nor is it governed by the law of mechanic’s liens, which are nonpossessory and relate only to work done to improve real property.
The common-law rule is that anyone who, under an express or implied contract, adds value to another’s chattel (personal property) by labor, skill, or materials has a possessory lien for the value of the services.
Moreover, the lienholder may keep the chattel until her services are paid.
For example, the dry cleaner shop is not going to release the wool jacket that you took in for cleaning unless you make satisfactory arrangements to pay for it, and the chain saw store won’t let you take the chain saw that you brought in for a tune-up until you pay for the labor and materials for the tune-up.
Tax Lien An important statutory lien is the federal tax lien.
Once the government assesses a tax, the amount due constitutes a lien on the owner’s property, whether real or personal.
Until it is filed in the appropriate state office, others take priority, including purchasers, mechanics’ lienors, judgment lien creditors, and holders of security interests.
But once filed, the tax lien takes priority over all subsequently arising liens.
Federal law exempts some property from the tax lien; for example, unemployment benefits, books and tools of a trade, workers’ compensation, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 629  judgments for support of minor children, minimum amounts of wages and salary, personal effects, furniture, fuel, and provisions are exempt.
Local governments also can assess liens against real estate for failure to pay real estate taxes.
After some period of time, the real estate may be sold to satisfy the tax amounts owing.
KEY TAKEAWAY There are four types of nonconsensual liens: (1) court-decreed liens are attachment liens, which prevent a person from disposing of assets pending a lawsuit, and judgment liens, which allow the prevailing party in a lawsuit to take property belonging to the debtor to satisfy the judgment; (2) mechanics’ liens are authorized by statute, giving a person who has provided labor or material to a landowner the right to sell the property to get paid; (3) possessory liens on personal property allow one in possession of goods to keep them to satisfy a claim for work done or storage of them; and (4) tax liens are enforced by the government to satisfy outstanding tax liabilities and may be assessed against real or personal property.

On November 14, 2000, Chase sent Cherry a “Loan Reactivation” letter with a new loan number upon which to make the payments.
During this time, Cherry was placing his mortgage payments into a bank account, which subsequently were put into an escrow account maintained by his attorney.
These payments were not, and have not, been tendered to Chase.
As a result of the failure to tender, Chase sent Cherry an acceleration warning on November 17, 2000, and again on March 16, 2001.
Chase notified the credit bureaus as to Cherry’s default status and moved for foreclosure.
In a letter addressed to Cherry’s attorney, dated April 24, 2001, Chase’s attorney advised Cherry to make the mortgage payments to Chase.
Chase recorded a “vacatur, revocation, and cancellation of satisfaction of mortgage” (vacatur) [vacatur: an announcement filed in court that something is cancelled or set aside; an annulment] in the Pinellas County public records on May 3, 2001.
Chase signed the vacatur on March 21, 2001, and had it notarized on March 27, 2001.
Chase has also been unable to locate the original note, dated October 15, 1997, and deems it to be lost.… Foreclosure Chase accelerated Cherry’s mortgage debt after determining he was in a default status under the mortgage provisions.
Chase claims that the right to foreclose under the note and mortgage is “absolute,” [Citation], and that this Court should enforce the security interest in the mortgage though Chase made an administrative error in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the public records.… Mortgage Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 631  …Chase relies on the Florida Supreme Court decision in United Service Corp. v. Vi-An Const.
Corp., [Citation] (Fla.1955), which held that a Satisfaction of Mortgage “made through a mistake may be canceled” and a mortgage reestablished as long as no other innocent third parties have “acquired an interest in the property.” Generally the court looks to the rights of any innocent third parties, and if none exist, equity will grant relief to a mortgagee who has mistakenly satisfied a mortgage before fully paid.
[Citation].
Both parties agree that the mortgage was released before the debt was fully paid.
Neither party has presented any facts to this Court that implies the possibility nor existence of a third party interest.
Although Cherry argues under Biggs v. Smith, 184 So.
106, 107 (1938), that a recorded satisfaction of mortgage is “prima facie evidence of extinguishment of a mortgage lien,” Biggs does not apply this standard to mortgage rights affected by a mistake in the satisfaction.
Therefore, on these facts, this Court acknowledges that a vacatur is a proper remedy for Chase to correct its unilateral mistake since “equity will grant relief to those who have through mistake released a mortgage.” [Citation.]
Accordingly, this Court holds that an equity action is required to make a vacatur enforceable unless the parties consent to the vacatur or a similar remedy during the mortgage negotiation.… Tender Cherry has not made a mortgage payment to Chase since August 2000, but claims to have made these payments into an escrow account, which he claims were paid to the escrow account because Chase recorded a satisfaction of his mortgage and, therefore, no mortgage existed.
Cherry also claims that representatives of Chase rejected his initial attempts to make payments because of a lack of a valid loan number.
Chase, however, correctly argues that payments made to an escrow account are not a proper tender of payment.
Matthews v. Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court).
Nor did Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], allowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or any part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the payments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” of the mortgage and note.
[Citation.]
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 632  Chase may, therefore, recover the entire amount of the mortgage indebtedness, unless the court finds a “limited circumstance” upon which the request may be denied.
[Citation.]
Although not presented by Chase in its discussion of this case, the Court may refuse foreclosure, notwithstanding that the defendant established a foreclosure action, if the acceleration was unconscionable and the “result would be inequitable and unjust.” This Court will analyze the inequitable result test and the limited circumstances by which the court may deny foreclosure.
First, this Court does not find the mortgage acceleration unconscionable by assuming arguendo [for the purposes of argument] that the mortgage was valid during the period that the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered into the public records.
Chase did not send the first acceleration warning until November 14, 2000, the fourth month of non-payment, followed by the second acceleration letter on March 16, 2001, the eighth month of non-payment.
Although Cherry could have argued that a foreclosure action was an “inequitable” and “unjust” result after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered on his behalf, the result does not rise to an unconscionable level since Cherry could have properly tendered the mortgage payments to the court.
Second, the following “limited circumstances” will justify a court’s denial of foreclosure: 1) waiver of right to accelerate; 2) mortgagee estopped from asserting foreclosure because mortgagor reasonably assumed the mortgagee would not foreclose; 3) mortgagee failed to perform a condition precedent for acceleration; 4) payment made after default but prior to receiving intent to foreclose; or, 5) where there was intent to make to make timely payment, and it was attempted, or steps taken to accomplish it, but nevertheless the payment was not made due to a misunderstanding or excusable neglect, coupled with some conduct of the mortgagee which in a measure contributed to the failure to pay when due or within the grace period.
[Citations.]
Chase fails to address this fifth circumstance in its motion, an apparent obfuscation of the case law before the court.
This Court acknowledges that Cherry’s facts do not satisfy the first four limited circumstances.
Chase at no time advised Cherry that the acceleration right was being waived; nor is Chase estopped from asserting foreclosure on the mortgage because of the administrative error, and Cherry has not relied on this error to his detriment; and since Chase Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 633  sent the acceleration letter to Cherry and a request for payment to his attorney, there can be no argument that Cherry believed Chase would not foreclose.
Chase has performed all conditions precedent required by the mortgage provisions prior to notice of the acceleration; sending acceleration warnings on November 17, 2000, and March 16, 2001.
Cherry also has no argument for lack of notice of intent to accelerate after default since he has not tendered a payment since July 2000, thus placing him in default of the mortgage provisions, and he admits receiving the acceleration notices.
This Court finds, however, that this claim fails squarely into the final limited circumstance regarding intent to make timely payments.
Significant factual issues exist as to the intent of Cherry to make or attempt to make timely mortgage payments to Chase.
Cherry claims that he attempted to make the payments, but was told by a representative of Chase that there was no mortgage loan number upon which to apply the payments.
As a result, the mortgage payments were placed into an account and later into his counsel’s trust account as a mortgage escrow.
Although these payments should have, at a minimum, been placed with the court to ensure tender during the resolution of the mortgage dispute, Cherry did take steps to accomplish timely mortgage payments.
Although Cherry, through excusable neglect or a misunderstanding as to what his rights were after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered, failed to tender the payments, Chase is also not without fault; its conduct in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the Pinellas County public records directly contributed to Cherry’s failure to tender timely payments.
Cherry’s attempt at making the mortgage payments, coupled with Chase’s improper satisfaction of mortgage fits squarely within the limited circumstance created to justify a court’s denial of a foreclosure.
Equity here requires a balancing between Chase’s right to the security interest encumbered by the mortgage and Cherry’s attempts to make timely payments.
As such, these limited circumstances exist to ensure that a foreclosure remains an action in equity.
In applying this analysis, this Court finds that equity requires that Chase’s request for foreclosure be denied at this juncture.… Reestablishment of the Lost Note and Mortgage Chase also requests, as part of the foreclosure counterclaim, the reestablishment of the note initially associated with the mortgage, as it is unable to produce the original note and provide by Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 634  affidavit evidence of its loss.
Chase has complied with the [necessary statutory] requirements[.
]…This Court holds the note to be reestablished and that Chase has the lawful right to enforce the note upon the issuance of this order.
This Court also agrees that Chase may reestablish the mortgage through a vacatur, revocation, and cancellation of satisfaction of mortgage.
[Citation] (allowing the Equity Court to reestablish a mortgage that was improperly canceled due to a mistake).
However, this Court will deem the vacatur effective as of the date of this order.
This Court leaves the status of the vacatur during the disputed period, and specifically since May 3, 2001, to be resolved in subsequent proceedings.…Accordingly, it is: ORDERED that [Chase cannot foreclose and] the request to reestablish the note and mortgage is hereby granted and effective as of the date of this order.
Cherry will tender all previously escrowed mortgage payments to the Court, unless the parties agree otherwise, within ten days of this order and shall henceforth, tender future monthly payments to Chase as set out in the reestablished note and mortgage.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
When Chase figured out that it had issued a Satisfaction of Mortgage erroneously, what did it file to rectify the error?
2.
Cherry had not made any mortgage payments between the time Chase sent the erroneous Satisfaction of Mortgage notice to him and the time of the court’s decision in this case.
The court listed five circumstances in which a mortgagee (Chase here) might be denied the right to foreclose on a delinquent account: which one applied here?
The court said Chase had engaged in “an apparent obfuscation of the case law before the court”?
What obfuscation did it engage in?
3.
What did Cherry do with the mortgage payments after Chase erroneously told him the mortgage was satisfied?
What did the court say he should have done with the payments?
Mechanic’s Lien Filed against Landlord for Payment of Tenant’s Improvements F & D Elec.
Contractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc. 567 S.E.2d 842 (S.C. 2002) Factual/ Procedural Background Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 635  BG Holding f/k/a Colite Industries, Inc. (“BG Holding”) is a one-third owner of about thirty acres of real estate in West Columbia, South Carolina.
A warehouse facility is located on the property.
In September 1996, Powder Coaters, Inc. (“Powder Coaters”) agreed to lease a portion of the warehouse to operate its business.
Powder Coaters was engaged in the business of electrostatically painting machinery parts and equipment and then placing them in an oven to cure.
A signed lease was executed between Powder Coaters and BG Holding.
Prior to signing the lease, Powder Coaters negotiated the terms with Mark Taylor, (“Taylor”) who was the property manager for the warehouse facility and an agent of BG Holding.
The warehouse facility did not have a sufficient power supply to support Powder Coaters’ machinery.
Therefore, Powder Coaters contracted with F & D Electrical (“F & D”) to perform electrical work which included installing two eight foot strip light fixtures and a two hundred amp load center.
Powder Coaters never paid F & D for the services.
Powder Coaters was also unable to pay rent to BG Holding and was evicted in February 1997.
Powder Coaters is no longer a viable company.
In January 1997, F & D filed a Notice and Certificate of Mechanic’s Lien and Affidavit of Mechanic’s Lien.
In February 1997, F & D filed this action against BG Holding foreclosing on its mechanic’s lien pursuant to S.C. [statute].… A jury trial was held on September 2nd and 3rd, 1998.
At the close of F & D’s evidence, and at the close of all evidence, BG Holding made motions for directed verdicts, which were denied.
The jury returned a verdict for F & D in the amount of $8,264.00.
The court also awarded F & D attorneys’ fees and cost in the amount of $8,264.00, for a total award of $16,528.00.
BG Holding appealed.
The Court of Appeals, in a two to one decision, reversed the trial court, holding a directed verdict should have been granted to BG Holding on the grounds BG Holding did not consent to the electrical upgrade, as is required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute.
This Court granted F & D’s petition for certiorari, and the issue before this Court is: Did the trial court err in denying BG Holding’s motion for directed verdict because the record was devoid of any evidence of owner’s consent to materialman’s performance of work on its property as required by [the S.C. statute]?
Law/Analysis Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 636  F & D argues the majority of the Court of Appeals erred in holding the facts of the case failed to establish that BG Holding consented to the work performed by F & D, as is required by the [South Carolina] Mechanic’s Lien Statute.
We agree.… South Carolina’s Mechanic’s Lien Statute provides: A person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building…by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of the building or structure, or a person having authority from, or rightfully acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall have a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of the building or structure …to secure the payment of the debt due.
[emphasis added.]
Both parties in this case concede there was no express “agreement” between F & D and BG Holding.
Therefore, the issue in this appeal turns on the meaning of the word “consent” in the statute, as applied in the landlord-tenant context.
This is a novel issue in South Carolina.
This Court must decide who must give the consent, who must receive consent, and what type of consent (general, specific, oral, written) must be given in order to satisfy the statute.
Finally, the Court must decide whether the evidence in this case shows BG Holding gave the requisite consent.
A.
Who Must Receive the Consent.
The Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case contemplates the consent must be between the materialman (lien claimant) and the landlord (owner).
“It is only logical…that consent under [the relevant section] must…be between the owner and the entity seeking the lien…” [Citation from Court of Appeals].
As stated previously, applying the Mechanic’s Lien Statute in the landlord-tenant context presents a novel issue.
We find the consent required by the statute does not have to be between the landlord/owner and the materialman, as the Court of Appeals’ opinion indicates.
A determination that the required consent must come from the owner to the materialman means the materialman can only succeed if he can prove an agreement with the owner.
Such an interpretation would render meaningless the language of the statute that provides: “…by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of the owner.…" Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 637  Therefore, it is sufficient for the landlord/owner or his agent to give consent to his tenant.
The landlord/owner should be able to delegate to his tenant the responsibility for making the requested improvements.
The landlord/owner may not want to have direct involvement with the materialman or sub-contractors, but instead may wish to allow the tenant to handle any improvements or upgrades himself.
In addition, the landlord/owner may be located far away and may own many properties, making it impractical for him to have direct involvement with the materialman.
We find the landlord/owner or his agent is free to enter into a lease or agreement with a tenant which allows the tenant to direct the modifications to the property which have been specifically consented to by the landlord/owner or his agent.
We hold a landlord/owner or his agent can give his consent to the lessee/tenant, as well as directly to the lien claimant, to make modifications to the leased premises.
B.
What Kind of Consent Is Necessary.
This Court has already clearly held the consent required by [the relevant section] is “something more than a mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence.
It implies an agreement to that which, but for the consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting has a right to forbid.” [Citations.]
However, our Mechanics Lien Statute has never been applied in the landlord-tenant context where a third party is involved.
Other jurisdictions have addressed this issue.
The Court of Appeals cited [a Connecticut case, 1987] in support of its holding.
We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut court’s reasoning is persuasive, especially since Connecticut has a similar mechanics lien statute.… The Connecticut courts have stated “the consent required from the owner or one acting under the owner’s authority is more than the mere granting of permission for work to be conducted on one’s property; or the mere knowledge that work was being performed on one’s land.” Furthermore, although the Connecticut courts have stated the statute does not require an express contract, the courts have required “consent that indicates an agreement that the owner of…the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.”… The reasoning of [Connecticut and other states that have decided this issue] is persuasive.
F & D’s brief appears to argue that mere knowledge by the landowner that the work needed to be done, coupled with the landlord’s general “permission” to perform the work, is enough to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 638  establish consent under the statute.
Under this interpretation, a landlord who knew a tenant needed to improve, upgrade, or add to the leased premises would be liable to any contractor and/or subcontractor who performed work on his land.
Under F & D’s interpretation the landlord would not be required to know the scope, cost, etc.
of the work, but would only need to give the tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements.
Clearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can be established.
Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific.
The landlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease provided in the instant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant).
The consent needs to be more than “mere knowledge” that the tenant will perform work on the property.
There must be some kind of express or implied agreement that the landlord may be held liable for the work or material.
The landlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project or work to his tenant, but there must be an express or implied agreement about the specific work to be done.
A general provision in a lease which allows tenant to make repairs or improvements is not enough.
C. Evidence There Was No Consent • The record is clear that no contract, express or implied, existed between BG Holding and F & G. BG Holding had no knowledge F & G would be performing the work.
• F & G’s supervisor, David Weatherington, and Ray Dutton, the owner of F & D, both testified they never had a conversation with anyone from BG Holding.
In fact, until Powder Coaters failed to pay under the contract, F & D did not know BG Holding was the owner of the building.
• Mark Taylor, BG Holding’s agent, testified he never authorized any work by F & D, nor did he see any work being performed by them on the site.
• The lease specifically provided that all work on the property was to be approved in writing by BG Holding.
• David Weatherington of F & D testified he was looking to Powder Coaters, not BG Holding, for payment.
• Powder Coaters acknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding to pay for the modifications.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 639  • The lease states, “[i]f the Lessee should make any [alterations, modification, additions, or installations], the Lessee hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and save harmless the Lessor from any liability…” D. Evidence There Was Consent • Bruce Houston, owner of Powder Coaters testified that during the lease negotiations, he informed Mark Taylor, BG Holding’s property manager and agent, that electrical and gas upgrading would be necessary for Powder Coaters to perform their work.
• Houston testified Mark Taylor was present at the warehouse while F & D performed their work.
[However, Taylor testified he did not see F & D performing any work on the premises.]
• Houston testified he would not have entered into the lease if he was not authorized to upgrade the electrical since the existing power source was insufficient to run the machinery needed for Powder Coaters to operate.
• Houston testified Mark Taylor, BG Holding’s agent, showed him the power source for the building so Taylor could understand the extent of the work that was going to be required.
• Houston testified Paragraph 5 of the addendum to the lease was specifically negotiated.
He testified the following language granted him the authority to perform the electrical upfit, so that he was not required to submit the plans to BG Holding as required by a provision in the lease: “Lessor shall allow Lessee to put Office Trailer in Building.
All Utilities necessary to handle Lessee’s equipment shall be paid for by the Lessee including, but not limited to electricity, water, sewer, and gas.” (We note that BG Holding denies this interpretation, but insists it just requires the Lessee to pay for all utility bills.)
• Powder Coaters no longer occupies the property, and BG Holding possibly benefits from the work done.
In the instant case, there is some evidence of consent.
However, it does not rise to the level required under the statute.… Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to F & D, whether BG Holding gave their consent is a close question.
However, we agree with the Court of Appeals, that F & D has not presented enough evidence to show: (1) BG Holding gave anything more than general consent to make improvements (as the lease could be interpreted to allow); or (2) BG Holding had anything Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 640  more that “mere knowledge” that the work was to be done.
Powder Coaters asserted the lease’s addendum evidenced BG Holding’s consent to perform the modifications; however, there is no evidence BG Holding expressly or implicitly agreed that it might be liable for the work.
In fact, the lease between Powder Coaters and BG Holding expressly provided Powder Coaters was responsible for any alterations made to the property.
Even Powder Coaters acknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding.…Therefore, it is impossible to see how the very general provision requiring Powder Coaters to pay for water, sewer, and gas can be interpreted to authorize Powder Coaters to perform an electrical upgrade.
Furthermore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the mere presence of BG Holding’s agent at the work site is not enough to establish consent.
Conclusion We hold consent, as required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute, is something more than mere knowledge work will be or could be done on the property.
The landlord/owner must do more than grant the tenant general permission to make repairs or improvements to the leased premises.
The landlord/owner or his agent must give either his tenant or the materialman express or implied consent acknowledging he may be held liable for the work.
The Court of Appeals’ opinion is affirmed as modified.

Deeds of Trust; Duties of Trustee Alpha Imperial Building, LLC v. Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, II (SFI).
2005 WL 715940, (Wash. Ct. App.
2005) Applewick, J. Alpha Imperial LLC challenges the validity of a non-judicial foreclosure sale on multiple grounds.
Alpha was the holder of a third deed of trust on the building sold, and contests the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 641  location of the sale and the adequacy of the sale price.
Alpha also claims that the trustee had a duty to re-open the sale, had a duty to the junior lienholder, chilled the bidding, and had a conflict of interest.
We find that the location of the sale was proper, the price was adequate, bidding was not chilled, and that the trustee had no duty to re-open the sale, [and] no duty to the junior lienholder.…We affirm.
Facts Mayur Sheth and another individual formed Alpha Imperial Building, LLC in 1998 for the purpose of investing in commercial real estate.
In February 2000 Alpha sold the property at 1406 Fourth Avenue in Seattle (the Property) to Pioneer Northwest, LLC (Pioneer).
Pioneer financed this purchase with two loans from [defendant Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, II (SFI)].
Pioneer also took a third loan from Alpha at the time of the sale for $1.3 million.
This loan from Alpha was junior to the two [other] loans[.]
Pioneer defaulted and filed for bankruptcy in 2002.…In October 2002 defendant Blackstone Corporation, an entity created to act as a non-judicial foreclosure trustee, issued a Trustee’s Notice of Sale.
Blackstone is wholly owned by defendant Witherspoon, Kelley, Davenport & Toole (Witherspoon).
Defendant Michael Currin, a shareholder at Witherspoon, was to conduct the sale on January 10, 2003.
Currin and Witherspoon represented SFI and 4th Avenue LLC.
Sheth received a copy of the Notice of Sale through his attorney.
On January 10, 2003, Sheth and his son Abhi arrived at the Third Avenue entrance to the King County courthouse between 9:30 and 9:45 a.m.
They waited for about ten minutes.
They noticed two signs posted above the Third Avenue entrance.
One sign said that construction work was occurring at the courthouse and ‘all property auctions by the legal and banking communities will be moved to the 4th Avenue entrance of the King County Administration Building.’ The other sign indicated that the Third Avenue entrance would remain open during construction.
Sheth and Abhi asked a courthouse employee about the sign, and were told that all sales were conducted at the Administration Building.
Sheth and Abhi then walked to the Administration Building, and asked around about the sale of the Property.
[He was told Michael Currin, one of the shareholders of Blackstone—the trustee— was holding the sale, and was advised] to call Currin’s office in Spokane.
Sheth did so, and was Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 642  told that the sale was at the Third Avenue entrance.
Sheth and Abhi went back to the Third Avenue entrance.
In the meantime, Currin had arrived at the Third Avenue entrance between 9:35 and 9:40 a.m.
The head of SFI, Danny Schnitzer (Schnitzer), and his son were also present.
Currin was surprised to notice that no other foreclosure sales were taking place, but did not ask at the information desk about it.
Currin did not see the signs directing auctions to occur at the Administration Building.
Currin conducted the auction, Schnitzer made the only bid, for $2.1 million, and the sale was complete.
At this time, the debt owed on the first two deeds of trust totaled approximately $4.1 million.
Currin then left the courthouse, but when he received a call from his assistant telling him about Sheth, he arranged to meet Sheth back at the Third Avenue entrance.
When they met, Sheth told Currin that the sales were conducted at the Administration Building.
Currin responded that the sale had already been conducted, and he was not required to go to the Administration Building.
Currin told Sheth that the notice indicated the sale was to be at the Third Avenue entrance, and that the sale had been held at the correct location.
Sheth did not ask to re-open the bidding.… Sheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003.
The lawsuit asked for declaratory relief, restitution, and other damages.
The trial court granted the defendants’ summary judgment motion on August 8, 2003.
Alpha appeals.
Location of the Sale Alpha argues that the sale was improper because it was at the Third Avenue entrance, not the Administration Building.
Alpha points to a letter from a King County employee stating that auctions are held at the Administration Building.
The letter also stated that personnel were instructed to direct bidders and trustees to that location if asked.
In addition, Alpha argues that the Third Avenue entrance was not a ‘public’ place, as required by [the statute], since auction sales were forbidden there.
We disagree.
Alpha has not shown that the Third Avenue entrance was an improper location.
The evidence shows that the county had changed its policy as to where auctions would be held and had posted signs to that effect.
However, the county did not exclude people from the Third Avenue entrance or prevent auctions from being held there.
Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations.
The sale was Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 643  held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be.
In addition, Alpha has not introduced any evidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale.
The public was free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies on Morton v. Resolution Trust(S.D.
Miss.
1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was improper.
[But] Morton is not on point.
Duty to Re-Open Sale Alpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale.
However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not request that Currin re-open it.
The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest in bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to protect his interest in the Property.
But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to offer to re-open the sale.
In addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been obligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to.
The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully within the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, continue the sale.” [Citation.]
Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins.
Co., Missouri (1936) to support its contention that Currin should have re- opened the sale is unavailing.
In Peterson, the Notice of Sale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse.
But, the courthouse had four doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door.
The sheriff, acting as the trustee, conducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some sales at the south door.
Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when learning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson.
However, Peterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south door.
This case is not on point.
Chilled Bidding Alpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full credit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse.
Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting aside a sale.
Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims,[Washington Court of Appeals] (1997).
The Country Express court explained the two types of chilled bidding: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 644  The first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids.
The second consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the bidding.
To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, which can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price.
We hold that there was no chilling.
Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling.
There is no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration Building when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from which he knew bidders would be absent.
Additionally, Currin’s statement to [an interested person who might bid on the property] that a full credit sale price was expected and that the opening bid would be $4.1 million did not constitute intentional chilling.
SFI was owed $4.1 million on the Property.
SFI could thus bid up to that amount at no cost to itself, as the proceeds would go back to SFI.
Currin confirmed that SFI was prepared to make a full-credit bid.
[It is common for trustees to] disclose the full-credit bid amount to potential third party bidders, and for investors to lose interest when they learn of the amount of indebtedness on property.
It was therefore not a misrepresentation for Currin to state $4.1 million as the opening bid, due to the indebtedness on the Property.
Currin’s statements had no chilling effect—they merely informed [interested persons] of the minimum amount necessary to prevail against SFI.
Thus, Currin did not intentionally chill the bidding by giving Street that information.
Alpha also argues that the chilled bidding could have been unintended by Currin.… [But the evidence is that] Currin’s actions did not intentionally or unintentionally chill the bidding, and the sale will not be set aside.
Adequacy of the Sale Price Alpha claims that the sale price was ‘greatly inadequate’ and that the sale should thus be set aside.
Alpha submitted evidence that the property had an ‘as is’ value of $4.35 million in December 2002, and an estimated 2004 value of $5.2 million.
The debt owed to SFI on the property was $4.1 million.
SFI bought the property for $2.1 million.
These facts do not suggest that the sale must be set aside.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 645  Washington case law suggests that the price the property is sold for must be ‘grossly inadequate’ for a trustee’s sale to be set aside on those grounds alone.
In Cox [Citation, 1985], the property was worth between $200,000 and $300,000, and was sold to the beneficiary for $11,873.
The Court held that amount to be grossly inadequate InSteward [Citation, 1988] the property had been purchased for approximately $64,000, and then was sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale for $4,870.
This court held that $4,870 was not grossly inadequate.
In Miebach [Citation] (1984), the Court noted that a sale for less than two percent of the property’s fair market value was grossly inadequate.
The Court in Miebach also noted prior cases where the sale had been voided due to grossly inadequate purchase price; the properties in those cases had been sold for less than four percent of the value and less than three percent of the value.
In addition, the Restatement indicates that gross inadequacy only exists when the sale price is less than 20 percent of the fair market value—without other defects, sale prices over 20 percent will not be set aside.
[Citation.]
The Property was sold for between 40 and 48 percent of its value.
These facts do not support a grossly inadequate purchase price.
Alpha cites Miebach for the proposition that ‘where the inadequacy of price is great the sale will be set aside with slight indications of fraud or unfairness,’ arguing that such indications existed here.
However, the cases cited by the Court in Miebach to support this proposition involved properties sold for less than three and four percent of their value.
Alpha has not demonstrated the slightest indication of fraud, nor shown that a property that sold for 40 to 48 percent of its value sold for a greatly inadequate price.
Duty to a Junior Lienholder Alpha claims that Currin owed a duty to Alpha, the junior lienholder.
Alpha cites no case law for this proposition, and, indeed, there is none—Division Two specifically declined to decide this issue in Country Express [Citation].
Alpha acknowledges the lack of language in RCW 61.24 (the deed of trust statute) regarding fiduciary duties of trustees to junior lienholders.
But Alpha argues that since RCW 61.24 requires that the trustee follow certain procedures in conducting the sale, and allows for sales to be restrained by anyone with an interest, a substantive duty from the trustee to a junior lienholder can be inferred.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 646  Alpha’s arguments are unavailing.
The procedural requirements in RCW 61.24 do not create implied substantive duties.
The structure of the deed of trust sale illustrates that no duty is owed to the junior lienholder.
The trustee and the junior lienholder have no relationship with each other.
The sale is pursuant to a contract between the grantor, the beneficiary and the trustee.
The junior lienholder is not a party to that contract.
The case law indicates only that the trustee owes a fiduciary duty to the debtor and beneficiary: “a trustee of a deed of trust is a fiduciary for both the mortgagee and mortgagor and must act impartially between them.” Cox [Citation].
The fact that a sale in accordance with that contract can extinguish the junior lienholder’s interest further shows that the grantor’s and beneficiary’s interest in the deed of trust being foreclosed is adverse to the junior lienholder.
We conclude the trustee, while having duties as fiduciary for the grantor and beneficiary, does not have duties to another whose interest is adverse to the grantor or beneficiary.
Thus, Alpha’s claim of a special duty to a junior lienholder fails.… Attorney Fees …Defendants claim they are entitled to attorney fees for opposing a frivolous claim, pursuant to [the Washington statute].
An appeal is frivolous ‘if there are no debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ and it is so totally devoid of merit that there was no reasonable possibility of reversal.’ [Citation] Alpha has presented several issues not so clearly resolved by case law as to be frivolous, although Alpha’s arguments ultimately fail.
Thus, Respondents’ request for attorney fees under [state law] is denied.
Affirmed.

17.5 Summary and Exercises Summary A mortgage is a means of securing a debt with real estate.
The mortgagor, or borrower, gives the mortgage.
The lender is the mortgagee, who holds the mortgage.
On default, the mortgagee may foreclose the mortgage, convening the security interest into title.
In many states, the mortgagor has a statutory right of redemption after foreclosure.
Various statutes regulate the mortgage business, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which together prescribe a code of fair practices and require various disclosures to be made before the mortgage is created.
The mortgagor signs both a note and the mortgage at the closing.
Without the note, the mortgage would secure nothing.
Most notes and mortgages contain an acceleration clause, which calls for the entire principal and interest to be due, at the mortgagee’s option, if the debtor defaults on any payment.
In most states, mortgages must be recorded for the mortgagee to be entitled to priority over third parties who might also claim an interest in the land.
The general rule is “First in time, first in right,” although there are exceptions for fixture filings and nonobligatory future advances.
Mortgages are terminated by repayment, novation, or foreclosure, either through judicial sale or under a power-of-sale clause.
Real estate may also be used as security under a deed of trust, which permits a trustee to sell the land automatically on default, without recourse to a court of law.
Nonconsensual liens are security interests created by law.
These include court-decreed liens, such as attachment liens and judgment liens.
Other liens are mechanic’s liens (for labor, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 648  services, or materials furnished in connection with someone’s real property), possessory liens (for artisans working with someone else’s personal properly), and tax liens.
EXERCISES 1.
Able bought a duplex from Carr, who had borrowed from First Bank for its purchase.
Able took title subject to Carr’s mortgage.
Able did not make mortgage payments to First Bank; the bank foreclosed and sold the property, leaving a deficiency.
Which is correct?
a. Carr alone is liable for the deficiency.
b.
Able alone is liable for the deficiency because he assumed the mortgage.
c. First Bank may pursue either Able or Carr.
d. Only if Carr fails to pay will Able be liable.
Harry borrowed $175,000 from Judith, giving her a note for that amount and a mortgage on his condo.
Judith did not record the mortgage.
After Harry defaulted on his payments, Judith began foreclosure proceedings.
Harry argued that the mortgage was invalid because Judith had failed to record it.
Judith counterargues that because a mortgage is not an interest in real estate, recording is not necessary.
Who is correct?
Explain.
Assume in Exercise 2 that the documents did not contain an acceleration clause and that Harry missed three consecutive payments.
Could Judith foreclose?
Explain.
Rupert, an automobile mechanic, does carpentry work on weekends.
He built a detached garage for Clyde for $20,000.
While he was constructing the garage, he agreed to tune up Clyde’s car for an additional $200.
When the work was completed, Clyde failed to pay him the $20,200, and Rupert claimed a mechanic’s lien on the garage and car.
What problems, if any, might Rupert encounter in enforcing his lien?
Explain.
In Exercise 4, assume that Clyde had borrowed $50,000 from First Bank and had given the bank a mortgage on the property two weeks after Rupert commenced work on the garage but several weeks before he filed the lien.
Assuming that the bank immediately recorded its mortgage and that Rupert’s lien is valid, does the mortgage take priority over the lien?
Why?
Defendant purchased a house from Seller and assumed the mortgage indebtedness to Plaintiff.
All monthly payments were made on time until March 25, 1948, when no more Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 649  were made.
On October 8, 1948, Plaintiff sued to foreclose and accelerate the note.
In February of 1948, Plaintiff asked to obtain a loan elsewhere and pay him off; he offered a discount if she would do so, three times, increasing the amount offered each time.
Plaintiff understood that Defendant was getting a loan from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), but she was confronted with a number of requirements, including significant property improvements, which—because they were neighbors—Plaintiff knew were ongoing.
While the improvements were being made, in June or July, he said to her, “Just let the payments go and we’ll settle everything up at the same time,” meaning she need not make monthly payments until the FHA was consummated, and he’d be paid from the proceeds.
But then “he changed his tune” and sought foreclosure.
Should the court order it?

2.
Recognize how bailments compare with sales.
3.
Point out the elements required to create a bailment.
Finally, we turn to the legal relationships that buyers and sellers have with warehousers and carriers—the parties responsible for physically transferring goods from seller to buyer.
This topic introduces a new branch of law—that of bailments; we’ll examine it before turning directly to warehousers and carriers.
Overview of Bailments A bailment is the relationship established when someone entrusts his property temporarily to someone else without intending to give up title.
Although bailment has often been said to arise only through a contract, the modern definition does not require that there be an agreement.
One widely quoted definition holds that a bailment is “the rightful possession of goods by one who is not the owner.
It is the element of lawful possession, however created, and the duty to account for the thing as the property of another, that creates the bailment, regardless of whether such possession is based upon contract in the ordinary sense or not.” [1] The word bailment derives from a Latin verb, bajulare, meaning “to bear a burden,” and then from French, bailler, which means “to deliver” (i.e., into the hands or possession of someone).
The one who bails out a boat, filling a bucket and emptying it overboard, is a water-bearer.
The one who bails someone out of jail takes on the burden of ensuring that the one sprung appears in court to stand trial; he also takes on the risk of loss of bond money if the jailed party does not appear in court.
The one who is abailee takes on the burden of being responsible to return the goods to their owner.
The law of bailments is important to virtually everyone in modern society: anyone who has ever delivered a car to a parking lot attendant, checked a coat in a restaurant, deposited property in a safe-deposit box, rented tools, or taken items clothes or appliance in to a shop for repair.
In commercial transactions, bailment law governs the responsibilities of warehousers and the carriers, such as UPS and FedEx, that are critical links in the movement of goods from manufacturer to the consumer.
Bailment law is an admixture of common law (property and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 652  tort), state statutory law (in the Uniform Commercial Code; UCC), federal statutory law, and— for international issues—treaty.
[2] Bailments Compared with Sales Bailment versus Sales In a sale, the buyer acquires title and must pay for the goods.
In a bailment, the bailee acquires possession and must return the identical object.
In most cases the distinction is clear, but difficult borderline cases can arise.
Consider the sad case of the leased cows: Carpenter v. Griffen (N.Y. 1841).
Carpenter leased a farm for five years to Spencer.
The lease included thirty cows.
At the end of the term, Spencer was to give Carpenter, the owner, “cows of equal age and quality.” Unfortunately, Spencer fell into hard times and had to borrow money from one Griffin.
When the time came to pay the debt, Spencer had no money, so Griffin went to court to levy against the cows (i.e., he sought a court order giving him the cows in lieu of the money owed).
Needless to say, this threatened transfer of the cows upset Carpenter, who went to court to stop Griffin from taking the cows.
The question was whether Spencer was a bailee, in which case the cows would still belong to Carpenter (and Griffin could not levy against them), or a purchaser, in which case Spencer would own the cows and Griffin could levy against them.
The court ruled that title had passed to Spencer—the cows were his.
Why?
The court reasoned that Spencer was not obligated to return the identical cows to Carpenter, hence Spencer was not a bailee.
[3] Section 2-304(1) of the UCC confirms this position, declaring that whenever the price of a sale is payable in goods, each party is a seller of the goods that he is to transfer.
Note the implications that flow from calling this transaction a sale.
Creditors of the purchaser can seize the goods.
The risk of loss is on the purchaser.
The seller cannot recover the goods (to make up for the buyer’s failure to pay him) or sell them to a third party.
Fungible Goods Fungible goods (goods that are identical, like grain in a silo) present an especially troublesome problem.
In many instances the goods of several owners are mingled, and the identical items are not intended to be returned.
For example, the operator of a grain elevator agrees to return an equal quantity of like-quality grain but not the actual kernels deposited there.
Following the rule in Carpenter’s cow case, this might seem to be a sale, but it is not.
Under the UCC, Section 2- Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 653  207, the depositors of fungible goods are “tenants in common” of the goods; in other words, the goods are owned by all.
This distinction between a sale and a bailment is important.
When there is a loss through natural causes—for example, if the grain elevator burns—the depositors must share the loss on a pro rata basis (meaning that no single depositor is entitled to take all his grain out; if 20 percent of the grain was destroyed, then each depositor can take out no more than 80 percent of what he deposited).
Elements of a Bailment As noted, bailment is defined as “the rightful possession of goods by one who is not the owner.” For the most part, this definition is clear (and note that it does not dictate that a bailment be created by contract).
Bailment law applies to the delivery of goods—that is, to the delivery personal property.
Personal property is usually defined as anything that can be owned other than real estate.
As we have just seen in comparing bailments to sales, the definition implies a duty to return the identical goods when the bailment ends.
But one word in the definition is both critical and troublesome: possession.
Possession requires both a physical and a mental element.
We examine these in turn.
Possession: Physical Control In most cases, physical control is proven easily enough.
A car delivered to a parking garage is obviously within the physical control of the garage.
But in some instances, physical control is difficult to conceptualize.
For example, you can rent a safe-deposit box in a bank to store valuable papers, stock certificates, jewelry, and the like.
The box is usually housed in the bank’s vault.
To gain access, you sign a register and insert your key after a bank employee inserts the bank’s key.
You may then inspect, add to, or remove contents of the box in the privacy of a small room maintained in the vault for the purpose.
Because the bank cannot gain access to the box without your key and does not know what is in the box, it might be said to have no physical control.
Nevertheless, the rental of a safe-deposit box is a bailment.
In so holding, a New York court pointed out that if the bank was not in possession of the box renter’s property “it is difficult to know who was.
Certainly [the renter] was not, because she could not obtain access to the property without the consent and active participation of the defendant.
She could not go into her safe unless the defendant used its key first, and then allowed her to open the box with her Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 654  own key; thus absolutely controlling [her] access to that which she had deposited within the safe.
The vault was the [company’s] and was in its custody, and its contents were under the same conditions.” [4] Statutes in some states, however, provide that the relationship is not a bailment but that of a landlord and tenant, and many of these statutes limit the bank’s liability for losses.
Possession: Intent to Possess In addition to physical control, the bailee must have had an intent to possess the goods; that is, to exercise control over them.
This mental condition is difficult to prove; it almost always turns on the specific circumstances and, as a fact question, is left to the jury to determine.
To illustrate the difficulty, suppose that one crisp fall day, Mimi goes to Sally Jane’s Boutique to try on a jacket.
The sales clerk hands Mimi a jacket and watches while Mimi takes off her coat and places it on a nearby table.
A few minutes later, when Mimi is finished inspecting herself in the mirror, she goes to retrieve her coat, only to discover it is missing.
Who is responsible for the loss?
The answer depends on whether the store is a bailee.
In some sense the boutique had physical control, but did it intend to exercise that control?
In a leading case, the court held that it did, even though no one said anything about guarding the coat, because a store invites its patrons to come in.
Implicit in the act of trying on a garment is the removal of the garment being worn.
When the customer places it in a logical place, with the knowledge of and without objection from the salesperson, the store must exercise some care in its safekeeping.
[5] Now suppose that when Mimi walked in, the salesperson told her to look around, to try on some clothes, and to put her coat on the table.
When the salesperson was finished with her present customer, she said, she would be glad to help Mimi.
So Mimi tried on a jacket and minutes later discovered her coat gone.
Is this a bailment?
Many courts, including the New York courts, would say no.
The difference?
The salesperson was helping another customer.
Therefore, Mimi had a better opportunity to watch over her own coat and knew that the salesperson would not be looking out for it.
This is a subtle distinction, but it has been sufficient in many cases to change the ruling.
[6] Questions of intent and control frequently arise in parking lot cases.
As someone once said, “The key to the problem is the key itself.” The key is symbolic of possession and intent to possess.
If you give the attendant your key, you are a bailor and he (or the company he works for) is the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 655  bailee.
If you do not give him the key, no bailment arises.
Many parking lot cases do not fall neatly within this rule, however.
Especially common are cases involving self-service airport parking lots.
The customer drives through a gate, takes a ticket dispensed by a machine, parks his car, locks it, and takes his key.
When he leaves, he retrieves the car himself and pays at an exit gate.
As a general rule, no bailment is created under these circumstances.
The lot operator does not accept the vehicle nor intend to watch over it as bailee.
In effect, the operator is simply renting out space.
[7] But a slight change of facts can alter this legal conclusion.
Suppose, for instance, that the lot had an attendant at the single point of entrance and exit, that the attendant jotted down the license number on the ticket, one portion of which he retained, and that the car owner must surrender the ticket when leaving or prove that he owns the car.
These facts have been held to add up to an intention to exercise custody and control over the cars in the lot, and hence to have created a bailment.
[8] For a bailment to exist, the bailee must know or have reason to know that the property exists.
When property is hidden within the main object entrusted to the bailee, lack of notice can defeat the bailment in the hidden property.
For instance, a parking lot is not responsible for the disappearance of valuable golf clubs stored in the trunk of a car, nor is a dance hall cloak room responsible for the disappearance of a fur wrap inside a coat, if they did not know of their existence.
[9] This result is usually justified by observing that when a person is unaware that goods exist or does not know their value, it is inequitable to hold him responsible for their loss since he cannot take steps to prevent it.
This rule has been criticized: trunks are meant to hold things, and if the car was within the garage’s control, surely its contents were too.
Some courts soften the impact of the rule by holding that a bailee is responsible for goods that he might reasonably expect to be present, like gloves in a coat checked at a restaurant or ordinary baggage in a car checked at a hotel.
KEY TAKEAWAY A bailment arises when one person (a bailee) rightfully holds property belonging to another (a bailor).
The law of bailments addresses the critical links in the movement of goods from the manufacturer to the end user in a consumer society: to the storage and transportation of goods.
Bailments only apply to personal property; a bailment requires that the bailor deliver Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 656  physical control of the goods to the bailee, who has an intention to possess the goods and a duty to return them.

Liability of the Bailee Duty of Care The basic rule is that the bailee is expected to return to its owner the bailed goods when the bailee’s time for possession of them is over, and he is presumed liable if the goods are not returned.
But that a bailee has accepted delivery of goods does not mean that he is responsible for their safekeeping no matter what.
The law of bailments does not apply a standard of absolute liability: the bailee is not an insurer of the goods’ safety; her liability depends on the circumstances.
The Ordinary Care Rule Some courts say that the bailee’s liability is the straightforward standard of “ordinary care under the circumstances.” The question becomes whether the bailee exercised such care.
If she did, she is not liable for the loss.
The Benefit-of-the-Bargain Rule Most courts use a complex (some say annoying) tripartite division of responsibility.
If the bailment is for the sole benefit of the owner (the bailor), the bailee is answerable only for gross neglect or fraud: the duty of care is slight.
For example, imagine that your car breaks down on a dark night and you beg a passing motorist to tow it to a gas station; or you ask your neighbor if you can store your utility trailer in her garage.
On the other hand, if the goods are entrusted to the bailee for his sole benefit, then he owes the bailor extraordinary care.
For example, imagine that your neighbor asks you to let him borrow your car to go to the grocery store downtown because his car is in the shop; or a friend asks if she can borrow your party canopy.
If the bailment is for the mutual benefit of bailee and bailor, then the ordinary negligence standard of care will govern.
For example, imagine you park your car in a commercial parking lot, or you take your suit jacket to a dry cleaner (see Figure 18.1 "Duty of Care").
Figure 18.1 Duty of Care Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 658  One problem with using the majority approach is the inherent ambiguity in the standards of care.
What constitutes “gross” negligence as opposed to “ordinary” negligence?
The degree-of- care approach is further complicated by the tendency of the courts to take into account the value of the goods; the lesser the value of the goods, the lesser the obligation of the bailee to watch out for them.
To some degree, this approach makes sense, because it obviously behooves a person guarding diamonds to take greater precautions against theft than one holding three paperback books.
But the value of the goods ought not to be the whole story: some goods obviously have great value to the owner, regardless of any lack of intrinsic value.
Another problem in using the majority approach to the standard of care is determining whether or not a benefit has been conferred on the bailee when the bailor did not expressly agree to pay compensation.
For example, a bank gives its customers free access to safe-deposit boxes.
Is the bank a “gratuitous bailee” that owes its bailor only a slight degree of care, or has it made the boxes available as a commercial matter to hold onto its customers?
Some courts cling to one theory, some to the other, suggesting the difficulty with the tripartite division of the standard of care.
However, in many cases, whatever the formal theory, the courts look to the actual benefits to be derived.
Thus when a customer comes to an automobile showroom and leaves her car in the lot while she test-drives the new car, most courts would hold that two bailments for mutual benefit have been created: (1) the bailment to hold the old car in the lot, with the customer as the bailor; and (2) the bailment to try out the new car, with the customer as the bailee.
Burden of Proof In a bailment case, the plaintiff bailor has the burden of proving that a loss was caused by the defendant bailee’s failure to exercise due care.
However, the bailor establishes a prima facie (“at first sight”—on first appearance, but subject to further investigation) case by showing that he Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 659  delivered the goods into the bailee’s hands and that the bailee did not return them or returned them damaged.
At that point, a presumption of negligence arises, and to avoid liability the defendant must rebut that presumption by showing affirmatively that he was not negligent.
The reason for this rule is that the bailee usually has a much better opportunity to explain why the goods were not returned or were returned damaged.
To put this burden on the bailor might make it impossible for him to win a meritorious case.
Liability of the Bailor As might be expected, most bailment cases involve the legal liability of bailees.
However, a body of law on the liability of bailors has emerged.
Negligence of Bailor A bailor may be held liable for negligence.
If the bailor receives a benefit from the bailment, then he has a duty to inform the bailee of known defects and to make a reasonable inspection for other defects.
Suppose the Tranquil Chemical Manufacturing Company produces an insecticide that it wants the Plattsville Chemical Storage Company to keep in tanks until it is sold.
One of the batches is defectively acidic and oozes out of the tanks.
This acidity could have been discovered through a routine inspection, but Tranquil neglects to inspect the batch.
The tanks leak and the chemical builds up on the floor until it explodes.
Since Tranquil, the bailor, received a benefit from the storage, it had a duty to warn Plattsville, and its failure to do so makes it liable for all damages caused by the explosion.
If the bailor does not receive any benefit, however, then his only duty is to inform the bailee of known defects.
Your neighbor asks to borrow your car.
You have a duty to tell her that the brakes are weak, but you do not need to inspect the car beforehand for unknown defects.
Other Types of Liability The theory of products liability extends to bailors.
Both warranty and strict liability theories apply.
The rationale for extending liability in the absence of sale is that in modern commerce, damage can be done equally by sellers or lessors of equipment.
A rented car can inflict substantial injury no less than a purchased one.
In several states, when an automobile owner (bailor) lends a vehicle to a friend (bailee) who causes an accident, the owner is liable to third persons injured in the accident.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 660  Disclaimers of Liability Bailee’s Disclaimer Bailees frequently attempt to disclaim their liability for loss or damage.
But courts often refuse to honor the disclaimers, usually looking to one of two justifications for invalidating them.
Lack of Notice The disclaimer must be brought to the attention of the bailor and must be unambiguous.
Thus posted notices and receipts disclaiming or limiting liability must set forth clearly and legibly the legal effects intended.
Most American courts follow the rule that the defendant bailee must show that the bailor in fact knew about the disclaimer.
Language printed on the back side of a receipt will not do.
Public Policy Exception Even if the bailor reads the disclaimer, some courts will nevertheless hold the bailee liable on public policy grounds, especially when the bailee is a “business bailee,” such as a warehouse or carrier.
Indeed, to the extent that a business bailee attempts to totally disclaim liability, he will probably fail in every American jurisdiction.
But the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 195(2)(b), does not go quite this far for most nonbusiness bailees.
They may disclaim liability as long as the disclaimer is read and does not relieve the bailee from wanton carelessness.
Bailor’s Disclaimer Bailors most frequently attempt to disclaim liability in rental situations.
For example, in Zimmer v. Mitchell and Ness, the plaintiff went to the defendant’s rental shop at the Camelback ski area to rent skis, boots, and poles.
[1] He signed a rental agreement before accepting the ski equipment.
He was a lessee and a bailee.
Later, while descending the beginners’ slope, he fell.
The bindings on his skis did not release, thereby causing him to sustain numerous injuries.
The plaintiff sued the defendant and Camelback Ski Corporation, alleging negligence, violation of Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and breach of warranty.
The defendant filed an answer and claimed that the plaintiff signed a rental agreement that fully released the defendant from liability.
In his reply, the plaintiff admitted signing the agreement but generally denied that it released the defendant from liability.
The defendant won on summary judgment.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 661  On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held for the defendant and set out the law: “The test for determining the validity of exculpatory clauses, admittedly not favored in the law, is set out in [Citation].
The contract must not contravene any policy of the law.
It must be a contract between individuals relating to their private affairs.
Each party must be a free bargaining agent, not simply one drawn into an adhesion contract, with no recourse but to reject the entire transaction.…We must construe the agreement strictly and against the party asserting it [and], the agreement must spell out the intent of the parties with the utmost particularity.” The court here was satisfied with the disclaimer.
Other Rights and Duties Compensation If the bailor hires the bailee to perform services for the bailed property, then the bailee is entitled to compensation.
Remember, however, that not every bailment is necessarily for compensation.
The difficult question is whether the bailee is entitled to compensation when nothing explicit has been said about incidental expenses he has incurred to care for the bailed property—as, for example, if he were to repair a piece of machinery to keep it running.
No firm rule can be given.
Perhaps the best generalization that can be made is that, in the absence of an express agreement, ordinary repairs fall to the bailee to pay, but extraordinary repairs are the bailor’s responsibility.
An express agreement between the parties detailing the responsibilities would solve the problem, of course.
Bailee’s Lien Lien is from the French, originally meaning “line,” “string,” or “tie.” In law a lien is the hold that someone has over the property of another.
It is akin, in effect, to a security interest.
A common type is the mechanic’s lien (“mechanic” here means one who works with his hands).
For example, a carpenter builds a room on your house and you fail to pay him; he can secure a lien on your house, meaning that he has a property interest in the house and can start foreclosure proceedings if you still fail to pay.
Similarly, a bailee is said to have a lien on the bailed property in his possession and need not redeliver it to the bailor until he has been paid.
Try to take your car out of a parking lot without paying and see what happens.
The attendant’s refusal to give you the car is entirely lawful under a common-law rule now more than a century and a half old.
As Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 662  the rule is usually stated, the common law confers the lien on the bailee if he has added value to the property through his labor, skill, or materials.
But that statement of the rule is somewhat deceptive, since the person who has simply housed the goods is entitled to a lien, as is a person who has altered or repaired the goods without measurably adding value to them.
Perhaps a better way of stating the rule is this: a lien is created when the bailee performs some special benefit to the goods (e.g., preserving them or repairing them).
Many states have enacted statutes governing various types of liens.
In many instances, these have broadened the bailee’s common-law rights.
This book discusses two types of liens in great detail: the liens of warehousemen and those of common carriers.
Recall that a lease creates a type of bailment: the lessor is the bailor and the lessee is the bailee.
This book references the UCC’s take on leasing in its discussion of the sale of goods.
[2] Rights When Goods Are Taken or Damaged by a Third Party The general rule is that the bailee can recover damages in full if the bailed property is damaged or taken by a third party, but he must account in turn to the bailor.
A delivery service is carrying parcels—bailed goods entrusted to the trucker for delivery—when the truck is struck from behind and blows up.
The carrier may sue the third person who caused the accident and recover for the total loss, including the value of the packages.
The bailor may also recover for damages to the parcels, but not if the bailee has already recovered a judgment.
Suppose the bailee has sued and lost.
Does the bailor have a right to sue independently on the same grounds?
Ordinarily, the principle of res judicata would prevent a second suit, but if the bailor did not know of and cooperate in the bailee’s suit, he probably has the right to proceed on his own suit.
Innkeepers’ Liability The liability of an innkeeper—a type of bailor—is thought to have derived from the warlike conditions that prevailed in medieval England, where brigands and bandits roamed the countryside and the innkeeper himself might not have been above stealing from his guests.
The innkeeper’s liability extended not merely to loss of goods through negligence.
His was an insurer’s liability, extending to any loss, no matter how occasioned, and even to losses that occurred in the guest’s room, a place where the guest had the primary right of possession.
The only exception was for losses due to the guest’s own negligence.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 663  Most states have enacted statutes providing exceptions to this extraordinarily broad common- law duty.
Typically, the statutes exempt the hotel keeper from insurer’s liability if the hotelier furnishes a safe in which the guests can leave their jewels, money, and other valuables and if a notice is posted a notice advising the guests of the safe’s availability.
The hotelier might face liability for valuables lost or stolen from the safe but not from the rooms.
KEY TAKEAWAY If the bailee fails to redeliver the goods to the bailor, a presumption of negligence arises, but the bailee can rebut the presumption by showing that she exercised appropriate care.
What is “appropriate care” depends on the test used in the jurisdiction: some courts use the “ordinary care under the circumstances,” and some determine how much care the bailee should have exercised based on the extent to which she was benefited from the transaction compared to the bailor.
The bailor can be liable too for negligently delivering goods likely to cause damage to the bailee.
In either case reasonable disclaimers of liability are allowed.
If the bailed goods need repair while in the bailee’s possession, the usual rule is that ordinary repairs are the bailee’s responsibility, extraordinary ones the bailor’s.
Bailees are entitled to liens to enforce payment owing to them.
In common law, innkeepers were insurers of their guests’ property, but hotels and motels today are governed mostly by statute: they are to provide a safe for their guests’ valuables and are not liable for losses from the room.

Understand a warehouser’s liability for losing goods, what types of losses a warehouser is liable for, and what rights the warehouser has concerning the goods.
2.
Know the duties, liabilities, and exceptions to liability a carrier of freight has, and what rights the carrier has.

Storage of Goods Warehousing has been called the “second oldest profession,” stemming from the biblical story of Joseph, who stored grain during the seven good years against the famine of the seven bad years.
Whatever its origins, warehousing is today a big business, taking in billions of dollars to stockpile foods and other goods.
As noted previously, the source of law governing warehousing is Article 7 of the UCC, but noncode law also can apply.
Section 7-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) specifically provides that any federal statute or treaty and any state regulation or tariff supersedes the provisions of Article 7.
A federal example is the United States Warehouse Act, which governs receipts for stored agricultural products.
Here we take up, after some definitions, the warehouser’s liabilities and rights.
A warehouser is a special type of bailee.
Definitions A warehouser is defined in UCC, Section 7-102(h), as “a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire,” and under Section 1-201(45) awarehouse receipt is any receipt issued by a warehouser.
The warehouse receipt is an important document because it can be used to transfer title to the goods, even while they remain in storage: it is worth money.
No form is prescribed for the warehouse receipt, but unless it lists in its terms the following nine items, the warehouser is liable to anyone who is injured by the omission of any of them: 1.
Location of the warehouse 2.
Date receipt was issued 3.
Consecutive number of the receipt 4.
Statement whether the goods will be delivered to bearer, to a specified person, or “to a specified person or his order” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 665  5.
The rate of storage and handling charges 6.
Description of the goods or the packages containing them 7.
Signature of the warehouser, which his or her authorized agent may make 8.
The warehouser’s ownership of the goods, if he or she has a sole or part ownership in them 9.
The amount (if known, otherwise the fact) of advances made and liabilities incurred for which the warehouser claims a lien or security interest General Duty of Care The warehouser’s general duty of care is embodied in the tort standard for measuring negligence: he is liable for any losses or injury to the goods caused by his failure to exercise “such care in regard to them as a reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances.” [1] However, subsection 4 declares that this section does not repeal or dilute any other state statute that imposes a higher responsibility on a warehouser.
Nor does the section invalidate contractual limitations otherwise permissible under Article 7.
The warehouser’s duty of care under this section is considerably weaker than the carrier’s duty.
Determining when a warehouser becomes a carrier, if the warehouser is to act as shipper, can become an important issue.
Limitation of Liability The warehouser may limit the amount of damages she will pay by so stating in the warehouse receipt, but she must strictly observe that section’s requirements, under which the limitation must be stated “per article or item, or value per unit of weight.” [2]Moreover, the warehouser cannot force the bailor to accept this limitation: the bailor may demand in writing increased liability, in which event the warehouser may charge more for the storage.
If the warehouser converts the goods to her own UCC, the limitation of liability does not apply.
Specific Types of Liability and Duties Several problems recur in warehousing, and the law addresses them.
Nonreceipt or Misdescription Under UCC Section 7-203, a warehouser is responsible for goods listed in a warehouse receipt that were not in fact delivered to the warehouse (or were misdescribed) and must pay damages to a good-faith purchaser of or party to a document of title.
To avoid this liability, the issuer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 666  must conspicuously note on the document that he does not know whether the goods were delivered or are correctly described.
One simple way is to mark on the receipt that “contents, condition, and quality are unknown.” Delivery to the Wrong Party The bailee is obligated to deliver the goods to any person with documents that entitle him to possession, as long as the claimant pays any outstanding liens and surrenders the document so that it can be marked “cancelled” (or can be partially cancelled in the case of partial delivery).
The bailee can avoid liability for no delivery by showing that he delivered the goods to someone with a claim to possession superior to that of the claimant, that the goods were lost or destroyed through no fault of the bailee, or that certain other lawful excuses apply.
[3] Suppose a thief deposits goods he has stolen with a warehouse.
Discovering the theft, the warehouser turns the goods over to the rightful owner.
A day later the thief arrives with a receipt and demands delivery.
Because the rightful owner had the superior claim, the warehouser is not liable in damages to the thief.
Now suppose you are moving and have placed your goods with a local storage company.
A few weeks later, you accidentally drop your wallet, which contains the receipt for the goods and all your identification.
A thief picks up the wallet and immediately heads for the warehouse, pretending to be you.
Having no suspicion that anything is amiss—it’s a large place and no one can be expected to remember what you look like—the warehouse releases the goods to the thief.
This time you are probably out of luck.
Section 7-404 says that “a bailee who in good faith including observance of reasonable commercial standards has received goods and delivered…them according to the terms of the document of title…is not liable.” This rule is true even though the person to whom he made delivery had no authority to receive them, as in the case of the thief.
However, if the warehouser had a suspicion and failed to take precautions, then he might be liable to the true owner.
Duty to Keep Goods Separate Except for fungible goods, like grain, the warehouse must keep separate goods covered by each warehouse receipt.
The purpose of this rule, which may be negated by explicit language in the receipt, is to permit the bailor to identify and take delivery of his goods at any time.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 667  Rights of the Warehouser The warehouser has certain rights concerning the bailed goods.
Termination A warehouser is not obligated to store goods indefinitely.
Many warehouse receipts will specify the period of storage.
At the termination of the period, the warehouser may notify the bailor to pay and to recover her goods.
If no period is fixed in the receipt or other document of title, the warehouser may give notice to pay and remove within no less than thirty days.
The bailor’s failure to pay and remove permits the warehouser to sell the goods for her fee.
Suppose the goods begin to deteriorate.
Sections 7-207(2) and 7-207(3) of the UCC permit the warehouser to sell the goods early if necessary to recover the full amount of her lien or if the goods present a hazard.
But if the rightful owner demands delivery before such a sale, the warehouser is obligated to do so.
Liens Section 7-209(1) of the UCC provides that a warehouser has a lien on goods covered by a warehouse receipt to recover the following charges and expenses: charges for storage or transportation, insurance, labor, and expenses necessary to preserve the goods.
The lien is not discharged if the bailor transfers his property interest in the goods by negotiating a warehouse receipt to a purchaser in good faith, although the warehouser is limited then to an amount or a rate fixed in the receipt or to a reasonable amount or rate if none was stated.
The lien attaches automatically and need not be spelled out in the warehouse receipt.
The warehouser may enforce the lien by selling the goods at a public or private sale, as long as she does so in a commercially reasonable manner, as defined in Section 7-210.
All parties known to be claiming an interest in the goods must be notified of the sale and told the amount due, the nature of the sale, and its time and place.
Any person who in good faith purchases the goods takes them free of any claim by the bailor, even if the warehouser failed to comply with the requirements of Section 7-210.
However, her failure to comply subjects her to damages, and if she has willfully violated the provisions of this section she is liable to the bailor for conversion.
Shipment of Goods Introduction and Terminology Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 668  The shipment of goods throughout the United States and abroad is a very big business, and many specialized companies have been established to undertake it, including railways, air cargo operations, trucking companies, and ocean carriers.
Article 7 of the UCC applies to carriage of goods as it does to warehousing, but federal law is more important.
The Federal Bill of Lading Act (FBLA) covers bills of lading issued by common carriers for transportation of goods in interstate or foreign commerce (i.e., from one state to another; in federal territory; or to foreign countries).
The Carmack Amendment was enacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, and it is now part of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995; it covers liability of interstate carriers for loss, destruction, and damage to goods.
The shipper is the entity hiring the one who transports the goods: if you send your sister crystal goblets for her birthday, you are the shipper.
Two terms are particularly important in discussing shipment of goods.
One is common carrier; the common carrier is “one who undertakes for hire or reward to transport the goods of such as chooses to employ him, from place to place.” [4] This definition contains three elements: (1) the carrier must hold itself out for all in common for hire—the business is not restricted to particular customers but is open to all who apply for its services; (2) it must charge for his services—it is for hire; (3) the service in question must be carriage.
Included within this tripartite definition are numerous types of carriers: household moving companies, taxicabs, towing companies, and even oil and gas pipelines.
Note that to be a common carrier it is not necessary to be in the business of carrying every type of good to every possible point; common carriers may limit the types of goods or the places to which they will transport them.
A bill of lading is any document that evidences “the receipt of goods for shipment issued by a person engaged in the business of transporting or forwarding goods.” [5]This is a comprehensive definition and includes documents used by contract carriers—that is, carriers who are not common carriers.
An example of a bill of lading is depicted in Figure 18.2 "A Bill of Lading Form".
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 669  Figure 18.2 A Bill of Lading Form Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 670  Duties and Liabilities Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 671  The transportation of goods has been an important part of all evolved economic systems for a long time, and certainly it is critical to the development and operation of any capitalistic system.
The law regarding it is well developed.
Absolute Liability Damage, destruction, and loss are major hazards of transportation for which the carrier will be liable.
Who will assert the claim against the carrier depends on who bears the risk of loss.
The rules governing risk of loss determine whether the buyer or seller will be the plaintiff.
But whoever is the plaintiff, the common carrier defendant faces absolute liability.
With five exceptions explored two paragraphs on, the common carrier is an insurer of goods, and regardless of the cause of damage or loss—that is, whether or not the carrier was negligent—it must make the owner whole.
This ancient common-law rule is codified in state law, in the federal Carmack Amendment, and in the UCC, Section 7-309(1), all of which hold the common carrier to absolute liability to the extent that the common law of the state had previously done so.
Absolute liability was imposed in the early cases because the judges believed such a rule was necessary to prevent carriers from conspiring with thieves.
Since it is difficult for the owner, who was not on the scene, to prove exactly what happened, the judges reasoned that putting the burden of loss on the carrier would prompt him to take extraordinary precautions against loss (and would certainly preclude him from colluding with thieves).
Note that the rules in this section govern only common carriers; contract carriers that do not hold themselves out for transport for hire are liable as ordinary bailees.
Exceptions to Absolute Liability In general, the burden or proof rests on the carrier in favor of the shipper.
The shipper (or consignee of the shipper) can make out a prima facie case by showing that it delivered the goods to the carrier in good condition and that the goods either did not arrive or arrived damaged in a specified amount.
Thereafter the carrier has the burden of proving that it was not negligent and that the loss or damage was caused by one of the five following recognized exceptions to the rule of absolute liability.
Act of God Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 672  No one has ever succeeded in defining precisely what constitutes an act of God, but the courts seem generally agreed that it encompasses acts that are of sudden and extraordinary natural, as opposed to human, origin.
Examples of acts of God are earthquakes, hurricanes, and fires caused by lightning against which the carrier could not have protected itself.
Rapid River Carriers contracts to transport a refrigerated cargo of beef down the Mississippi River on the SS Rapid.
When the ship is en route, it is hit by a tornado and sinks.
This is an act of God.
But a contributing act of negligence by a carrier overcomes the act of God exception.
If it could be shown that the captain was negligent to set sail when the weather warned of imminent tornados, the carrier might be liable.
Act of Public Enemy This is a narrow exception that applies only to acts committed by pirates at high sea or by the armed forces of enemies of the state to which the carrier owes allegiance.
American ships at sea that are sunk during wartime by enemy torpedoes would not be liable for losses to the owners of cargo.
Moreover, public enemies do not include lawless mobs or criminals listed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, even if federal troops are required, as in the Pullman Strike of 1894, to put down the violence.
After the Pullman Strike, carriers were held liable for property destroyed by violent strikers.
Act of Public Authority When a public authority—a sheriff or federal marshal, for example—through lawful process seizes goods in the carrier’s possession, the carrier is excused from liability.
Imagine that federal agents board the SS Rapid in New Orleans and, as she is about to sail, show the captain a search warrant and seize several boxes of cargo marked “beef” that turn out to hold cocaine.
The owner or consignee of this illegal cargo will not prevail in a suit against the carrier to recover damages.
Likewise, if the rightful owner of the goods obtains a lawful court order permitting him to attach them, the carrier is obligated to permit the goods to be taken.
It is not the carrier’s responsibility to contest a judicial writ or to face the consequences of resisting a court order.
The courts generally agree that the carrier must notify the owner whenever goods are seized.
Act of Shipper Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 673  When goods are lost or damaged because of the shipper’s negligence, the shipper is liable, not the carrier.
The usual situation under this exception arises from defective packing.
The shipper who packs the goods defectively is responsible for breakage unless the defect is apparent and the carrier accepts the goods anyway.
For example, if you ship your sister crystal goblets packed loosely in the box, they will inevitably be broken when driven in trucks along the highways.
The trucker who knowingly accepts boxes in this condition is liable for the damage.
Likewise, the carrier’s negligence will overcome the exception and make him absolutely liable.
A paper supplier ships several bales of fine stationery in thin cardboard boxes susceptible to moisture.
Knowing their content, SS Rapid accepts the bales and exposes them to the elements on the upper deck.
A rainstorm curdles the stationery.
The carrier is liable.
Inherent Nature of the Goods The fifth exception to the rule of absolute liability is rooted in the nature of the goods themselves.
If they are inherently subject to deterioration or their inherent characteristics are such that they might be destroyed, then the loss must lie on the owner.
Common examples are chemicals that can explode spontaneously and perishable fruits and vegetables.
Of course, the carrier is responsible for seeing that foodstuffs are properly stored and cared for, but if they deteriorate naturally and not through the carrier’s negligence, he is not liable.
Which Carrier Is Liable?
The transportation system is complex, and few goods travel from portal to portal under the care of one carrier only.
In the nineteenth century, the shipper whose goods were lost had a difficult time recovering their value.
Initial carriers blamed the loss on subsequent carriers, and even if the shipper could determine which carrier actually had possession of the goods when the damage or loss occurred, diverse state laws made proof burdensome.
The Carmack Amendment ended the considerable confusion by placing the burden on the initial carrier; connecting carriers are deemed agents of the initial carrier.
So the plaintiff, whether seller or buyer, need sue only the initial carrier, no matter where the loss occurred.
Likewise, Section 7-302 of the UCC fastens liability on an initial carrier for damages or loss caused by connecting carriers.
When Does Carrier Liability Begin and End?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 674  When a carrier’s liability begins and ends is an important issue because the same company can act both to store the goods and to carry them.
The carrier’s liability is more stringent than the warehouser’s.
So the question is, when does a warehouser become a carrier and vice versa?
The basic test for the beginning of carrier liability is whether the shipper must take further action or give further instructions to the carrier before its duty to transport arises.
Suppose that Cotton Picking Associates delivers fifty bales of cotton to Rapid River Carriers for transport on the SS Rapid.
The SS Rapid is not due back to port for two more days, so Rapid River Carrier stores the cotton in its warehouse, and on the following day the warehouse is struck by lightning and burns to the ground.
Is Rapid River Carriers liable in its capacity as a carrier or warehouse?
Since nothing was left for the owner to do, and Rapid River was storing the cotton for its own convenience awaiting the ship’s arrival, it was acting as a carrier and is liable for the loss.
Now suppose that when Cotton Picking Associates delivered the fifty bales it said that another fifty bales would be coming in a week and the entire lot was to be shipped together.
Rapid River stores the first fifty bales and lightning strikes.
Since more remained for Cotton Picking to do before Rapid River was obligated to ship, the carrier was acting in its warehousing capacity and is not liable.
The carrier’s absolute liability ends when it has delivered the goods to the consignee’s residence or place of business, unless the agreement states otherwise (as it often does).
By custom, certain carriers—notably rail carriers and carriers by water—are not required to deliver the goods to the consignee (since rail lines and oceans do not take the carrier to the consignee’s door).
Instead, consignees must take delivery at the dock or some other place mutually agreed on or established by custom.
When the carrier must make personal delivery to the consignee, carrier liability continues until the carrier has made reasonable efforts to deliver.
An express trucking company cannot call on a corporate customer on Sunday or late at night, for instance.
If reasonable efforts to deliver fail, it may store the goods in its own warehouse, in which case its liability reverts to that of a warehouser.
If personal delivery is not required (e.g., as in shipment by rail), the states use different approaches for determining when the carrier’s liability terminates.
The most popular intrastate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 675  approach provides that the carrier continues to be absolutely responsible for the goods until the consignee has been notified of their arrival and has had a reasonable opportunity to take possession of them.
Interstate shipments are governed by the Carmack Amendment, which generally provides that liability will be determined by language in the bill of lading.
The typical bill of lading (or “BOL” and “B/L”) provides that if the consignee does not take the goods within a stated period of time after receiving notice of their arrival, the carrier will be liable as warehouser only.
Disclaimers The apparently draconian liability of the carrier—as an insurer of the goods—is in practice easily minimized.
Under neither federal nor state law may the carrier disclaim its absolute liability, but at least as to commercial transactions it may limit the damages payable under certain circumstances.
Both the Carmack Amendment and Section 7-309 of the UCC permit the carrier to set alternate tariffs, one costing the shipper more and paying full value, the other costing less and limited to a dollar per pound or some other rate less than full value.
The shipper must have a choice; the carrier may not impose a lesser tariff unilaterally on the shipper, and the loss must not be occasioned by the carrier’s own negligence.
Specific Types of Liability The rules just discussed relate to the general liability of the carrier for damages to the goods.
There are two specific types of liability worth noting.
Nonreceipt or Misdescription Under the UCC, Section 7-301(1), the owner of the goods (e.g., a consignee) described in a bill of lading may recover damages from the issuer of the bill (the carrier) if the issuer did not actually receive the goods from the shipper, if the goods were misdescribed, or if the bill was misdated.
The issuer may avoid liability by reciting in the bill of lading that she does not know whether the goods were received or if they conform to the description; the issuer may avoid liability also by marking the goods with such words as “contents or condition of contents unknown.” Even this qualifying language may be ineffective.
For instance, a common carrier may not hide behind language indicating that the description was given by the shipper; the carrier must actually count the packages of goods or ascertain the kind and quantity of bulk freight.
Just because the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 676  carrier is liable to the consignee for errors in description does not mean that the shipper is free from blame.
Section 7-301(5) requires the shipper to indemnify the carrier if the shipper has inaccurately described the goods in any way (including marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight).
Delivery to the Wrong Party The rule just discussed for warehouser applies to carriers under both state and federal law: carriers are absolutely liable for delivering the goods to the wrong party.
In the classic case of Southern Express Co. v. C. L. Ruth & Son, a clever imposter posed as the representative of a reputable firm and tricked the carrier into delivering a diamond ring.
[6] The court held the carrier liable, even though the carrier was not negligent and there was no collusion.
The UCC contains certain exceptions; under Section 7-303(1), the carrier is immune from liability if the holder, the consignor, or (under certain circumstances) the consignee gives instructions to deliver the goods to someone other than a person named in the bill of lading.
Carrier’s Right to Lien and Enforcement of Lien Just as the warehouser can have a lien, so too can the carrier.
The lien can cover charges for storage, transportation, and preservation of goods.
When someone has purchased a negotiable bill of lading, the lien is limited to charges stated in the bill, allowed under applicable tariffs, or, if none are stated, to a reasonable charge.
A carrier who voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver the goods loses its lien.
The carrier has rights paralleling those of the warehouser to enforce the lien.
Passengers In addition to shipping goods, common carriers also transport passengers and their baggage.
The carrier owes passengers a high degree of care; in 1880 the Supreme Court described the standard as “the utmost caution characteristic of very careful prudent men.” [7] This duty implies liability for a host of injuries, including mental distress occasioned by insults (“lunatic,” “whore,” “cheap, common scalawag”) and by profane or indecent language.
In Werndli v. Greyhound, [8] Mrs. Werndli deboarded the bus at her destination at 2:30 a.m.; finding the bus station closed, she walked some distance to find a bathroom.
While doing so, she became the victim of an assault.
The court held Greyhound liable: it should have known the station was Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 677  closed at 2:30 a.m. and that it was located in a area that became dangerous after hours.
The case illustrates the degree to which a carrier is responsible for its passengers’ safety and comfort.
The baggage carrier is liable as an insurer unless the baggage is not in fact delivered to the carrier.
A passenger who retains control over his hand luggage by taking it with him to his seat has not delivered the baggage to the carrier, and hence the carrier has no absolute liability for its loss or destruction.
The carrier remains liable for negligence, however.
When the passenger does deliver his luggage to the carrier, the question often arises whether the property so delivered is “baggage.” If it is not, the carrier does not have an insurer’s liability toward it.
Thus a person who transports household goods in a suitcase would not have given the carrier “baggage,” as that term is usually defined (i.e., something transported for the passenger’s personal use or convenience).
At most, the carrier would be responsible for the goods as a gratuitous bailee.
KEY TAKEAWAY The storage of goods is a special type of bailment.
People who store goods can retrieve them or transfer ownership of them by transferring possession of the warehouse receipt: whoever has rightful possession of the receipt can take the goods, and the warehouser is liable for misdelivery or for mixing up goods.
The warehouser has a right to a lien to secure his fee, enforceable by selling the goods in a commercially reasonable way.
The shipping of goods is of course an important business.
Common carriers (those firms that hire out their trucks, airplanes, ships, or trains to carry cargo) are strictly liable to ensure the proper arrival of the goods to their destination, with five exceptions (act of God, public enemy, public authority, shipper; inherent nature of the goods); the first carrier to receive them is liable—others who subsequently carry are that carrier’s agents.
The carrier may also store goods: if it does so for its own convenience it is liable as a carrier; if it does so for the shipper’s convenience, it is liable as a warehouser.
As with warehousers, the carrier is liable for misdelivery and is entitled to a lien to enforce payment.
Carriers also carry people, and the standard of care they owe to passengers is very high.
Carrying passengers’ baggage, the carrier is liable as an insurer—it is strictly liable.

App., 1978) 18.4 Negotiation and Transfer of Documents of Title (or Commodity Paper) LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how commodity paper operates in the sale of goods.
2.
Recognize when the transferee of a properly negotiated document of title gets better rights than her transferor had and the exceptions to this principle.
Overview of Negotiability We have discussed in several places the concept of a document of title (also calledcommodity paper).
That is a written description, identification, or declaration of goods authorizing the holder—usually a bailee—to receive, hold, and dispose of the document and the goods it covers.
Examples of documents of title are warehouse receipts, bills of lading, and delivery orders.
The document of title, properly negotiated (delivered), gives its holder ownership of the goods it represents.
It is much easier to pass around a piece of paper representing the ownership interest in goods than it is to pass around the goods themselves.
It is a basic feature of our legal system that a person cannot transfer more rights to property than he owns.
It would follow here that no holder of a document of title has greater rights in the goods than the holder’s transferor—the one from whom she got the document (and thus the goods).
But there are certain exceptions to this rule; for example, the power of a merchant in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 679  certain circumstances to transfer title to goods, even though the merchant himself did not have title to them.
A critically important exception to the general rule arises when certain types of paper are sold; for example, commercial paper such as checks and notes.
To conclude this chapter, we discuss the rule as it applies to documents of title, sometimes known as commodity paper.
The Elements and Effect of Negotiation If a document of title is “negotiable” and is “duly negotiated,” the purchaser can obtain rights greater than those of the storer or shipper.
In the following discussion, we refer only to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), although federal law also distinguishes between negotiable and nonnegotiable documents of title (some of the technical details in the federal law may differ, but these are beyond the scope of this book).
Negotiable Defined Any document of title, including a warehouse receipt and a bill of lading, is negotiable or becomes negotiable if by its terms the goods are to be delivered “to bearer or to the order of” a named person.
[1] All other documents of title are nonnegotiable.
Suppose a bill of lading says that the goods are consigned to Tom Thumb but that they may not be delivered unless Tom signs a written order that they be delivered.
Under Section 7-104(2), that is not a negotiable document of title.
A negotiable document of title must bear words such as “Deliver to the bearer” or “deliver to the order of Tom Thumb.” These are the “magic words” that create a negotiable document.
Duly Negotiated To transfer title effectively through negotiation of the document of title, it must be “duly negotiated.” In general terms, under Section 7-501 of the UCC, a negotiable document of title is duly negotiated when the person named in it indorses (signs it over—literally “on the back of”) and delivers it to a holder who purchases it in good faith and for value, without any notice that someone else might have a claim against the goods, assuming the transaction is in the regular course of business or financing.
Note that last part: assuming the transaction is in the regular course of business.
If you gave your roommate a negotiable document of title in payment for a car you bought from her, your roommate would have something of value, but it would not have Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 680  been duly negotiated.
Paper made out “to bearer” (bearer paper) is negotiated by delivery alone; no indorsement is needed.
A holder is anyone who possesses a document of title that is drawn to his order, indorsed to him, or made out “to bearer.” Effect As a general rule, if these requirements are not met, the transferee acquires only those rights that the transferor had and nothing more.
And if a nonnegotiable document is sold, the buyer’s rights may be defeated.
For example, a creditor of the transferor might be entitled to treat the sale as void.
Under Section 7-502 of the UCC, however, if the document is duly negotiated, then the holder acquires (1) title to the document, (2) title to the goods, (3) certain rights to the goods delivered to the bailee after the document itself was issued, and (4) the right to have the issuer of the document of title hold the goods or deliver the goods free of any defense or claim by the issuer.
To contrast the difference between sale of goods and negotiation of the document of title, consider the plight of Lucy, the owner of presidential campaign pins and other political memorabilia.
Lucy plans to hold them for ten years and then sell them for many times their present value.
She does not have the room in her cramped apartment to keep them, so she crates them up and takes them to a friend for safekeeping.
The friend gives her a receipt that says simply: “Received from Lucy, five cartons; to be stored for ten years at $25 per year.” Although a document of title, the receipt is not negotiable.
Two years later, a browser happens on Lucy’s crates, discovers their contents, and offers the friend $1,000 for them.
Figuring Lucy will forget all about them, the friend sells them.
As it happens, Lucy comes by a week later to check on her memorabilia, discovers what her former friend has done, and sues the browser for their return.
Lucy would prevail.
Now suppose instead that the friend, who has authority from Lucy to store the goods, takes the cartons to the Trusty Storage Company, receives a negotiable warehouse receipt (“deliver to bearer five cartons”), and then negotiates the receipt.
This time Lucy would be out of luck.
The bona fide purchaser from her friend would cut off Lucy’s right to recover the goods, even though the friend never had good title to them.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 681  A major purpose of the concept is to allow banks and other creditors to loan money with the right to the goods as represented on the paper as collateral.
They can, in effect, accept the paper as collateral without fear that third parties will make some claim on the goods.
But even if the requirements of negotiability are met, the document of title still will confer no rights in certain cases.
For example, when a thief forges the indorsement of the owner, who held negotiable warehouse receipts, the bona fide purchaser from the thief does not obtain good title.
Only if the receipts were in bearer form would the purchaser prevail in a suit by the owner.
Likewise, if the owner brought his goods to a repair shop that warehoused them without any authority and then sold the negotiable receipts received for them, the owner would prevail over the subsequent purchaser.
Another instance in which an apparent negotiation of a document of title will not give the bona fide purchaser superior rights occurs when a term in the document is altered without authorization.
But if blanks are filled in without authority, the rule states different consequences for bills of lading and warehouse receipts.
Under Section 7-306 of the UCC, any unauthorized filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the bill enforceable only as it was originally.
However, under Section 7-208, an unauthorized filling in of a blank in a warehouse receipt permits the good-faith purchaser with no notice that authority was lacking to treat the insertion as authorized, thus giving him good title.
This section makes it dangerous for a warehouser to issue a receipt with blanks in it, because he will be liable for any losses to the owner if a good- faith purchaser takes the goods.
Finally, note that a purchaser of a document of title who is unable to get his hands on the goods—perhaps the document was forged—might have a breach of warranty action against the seller of the document.
Under Section 7-507 of the UCC, a person who negotiates a document of title warrants to his immediate purchaser that the document is genuine, that he has no knowledge of any facts that would impair its validity, and that the negotiation is rightful and effective.
Thus the purchaser of a forged warehouse receipt would not be entitled to recover the goods but could sue his transferor for breach of the warranty.
KEY TAKEAWAY Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 682  It is a lot easier to move pieces of paper around than goods in warehouses.
Therefore commercial paper, or commodity paper, was invented: the paper represents the goods, and the paper is transferred from one person to another by negotiation.
The holder signs on the back of the paper and indicates who its next holder should be (or foolishly leaves that blank); that person then has rights to the goods and, indeed, better rights.
On due negotiation the transferee does not merely stand in the transferor’s shoes: the transferee takes free of defects and defenses that could have been available against the transferor.
For a document of title to be a negotiable one, it must indicate that the intention of it is that it should be passed on through commerce, with the words “to bearer” or “to the order of [somebody],” and it must be duly negotiated: signed off on by its previous holder (or without any signature needed if it was bearer paper).

18.5 Cases Bailments and Disclaimers of Bailee’s Liability Carr v. Hoosier Photo Supplies, Inc. 441 N.E.2d 450 (Ind.
1982) Givan, J.
Litigation in this cause began with the filing of a complaint in Marion Municipal Court by John R. Carr, Jr. (hereinafter “Carr”), seeking damages in the amount of $10,000 from defendants Hoosier Photo Supplies, Inc. (hereinafter “Hoosier”) and Eastman Kodak Company (hereinafter “Kodak”).
Carr was the beneficiary of a judgment in the amount of $1,013.60.
Both sides appealed.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in its entirety.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 683  The facts were established by stipulation agreement between the parties and thus are not in dispute.
In the late spring or early summer of 1970, Carr purchased some Kodak film from a retailer not a party to this action, including four rolls of Kodak Ektachrome-X 135 slide film that are the subject matter of this dispute.
During the month of August, 1970, Carr and his family vacationed in Europe.
Using his own camera Carr took a great many photographs of the sites they saw, using among others the four rolls of film referred to earlier.
Upon their return to the United States, Carr took a total of eighteen [18] rolls of exposed film to Hoosier to be developed.
Only fourteen [14] of the rolls were returned to Carr after processing.
All efforts to find the missing rolls or the pictures developed from them were unsuccessful.
Litigation commenced when the parties were unable to negotiate a settlement.
The film Carr purchased, manufactured by Kodak, is distributed in boxes on which there is printed the following legend: READ THIS NOTICE This film will be replaced if defective in manufacture, labeling, or packaging, or if damaged or lost by us or any subsidiary company even though by negligence or other fault.
Except for such replacement, the sale, processing, or other handling of this film for any purpose is without other warranty of liability.
In the stipulation of facts it was agreed though Carr never read this notice on the packages of film he bought, he knew there was printed on such packages “a limitation of liability similar or identical to the Eastman Kodak limitation of liability.” The source of Carr’s knowledge was agreed to be his years of experience as an attorney and as an amateur photographer.
When Carr took all eighteen [18] rolls of exposed film to Hoosier for processing, he was given a receipt for each roll.
Each receipt contained the following language printed on the back side: Although film price does not include processing by Kodak, the return of any film or print to us for processing or any other purpose, will constitute an agreement by you that if any such film or print is damaged or lost by us or any subsidiary company, even though by negligence or other fault, it will be replaced with an equivalent amount of Kodak film and processing and, except for such replacement, the handling of such film or prints by us for any purpose is without other warranty or liability.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 684  Again, it was agreed though Carr did not read this notice he was aware Hoosier “[gave] to their customers at the time of accepting film for processing, receipts on which there are printed limitations of liability similar or identical to the limitation of liability printed on each receipt received by Carr from Hoosier Photo.” It was stipulated upon receipt of the eighteen [18] rolls of exposed film only fourteen [14] were returned to Hoosier by Kodak after processing.
Finally, it was stipulated the four rolls of film were lost by either Hoosier or Kodak.… That either Kodak or Hoosier breached the bailment contract, by negligently losing the four rolls of film, was established in the stipulated agreement of facts.
Therefore, the next issue raised is whether either or both, Hoosier or Kodak, may limit their liability as reflected on the film packages and receipts.… [A] prerequisite to finding a limitation of liability clause in a contract unconscionable and therefore void is a showing of disparity in bargaining power in favor of the party whose liability is thus limited.…In the case at bar the stipulated facts foreclose a finding of disparate bargaining power between the parties or lack of knowledge or understanding of the liability clause by Carr.
The facts show Carr is an experienced attorney who practices in the field of business law.
He is hardly in a position comparable to that of the plaintiff in Weaver, supra.
Moreover, it was stipulated he was aware of the limitation of liability on both the film packages and the receipts.
We believe these crucial facts belie a finding of disparate bargaining power working to Carr’s disadvantage.
Contrary to Carr’s assertions, he was not in a “take it or leave it position” in that he had no choice but to accept the limitation of liability terms of the contract.
As cross-appellants Hoosier and Kodak correctly point out, Carr and other photographers like him do have some choice in the matter of film processing.
They can, for one, undertake to develop their film themselves.
They can also go to independent film laboratories not a part of the Kodak Company.
We do not see the availability of processing as limited to Kodak.… We hold the limitation of liability clauses operating in favor of Hoosier and Kodak were assented to by Carr; they were not unconscionable or void.
Carr is, therefore, bound by such terms and is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 685  limited in his remedy to recovery of the cost of four boxes of unexposed Kodak Ektachrome-X 135 slide film.
The Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case is hereby vacated.
The cause is remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter a judgment in favor of appellant, John R. Carr, Jr., in the amount of $13.60, plus interest.
Each party is to bear its own costs.
Hunter and Pivarnik, JJ., concur.
Prentice, J., concurs in result without opinion.
DeBruler, J., dissenting.
…As a general rule the law does not permit professional bailees to escape or diminish liability for their own negligence by posting signs or handing out receipts.
[Citations] The statements on the film box and claim check used by Kodak and Hoosier Photo are in all respects like the printed forms of similar import which commonly appear on packages, signs, chits, tickets, tokens and receipts with which we are all bombarded daily.
No one does, or can reasonably be expected, to take the time to carefully read the front, back, and sides of such things.
We all know their gist anyway.
The distinguished trial judge below characterizes these statements before us as “mere notices” and concludes that plaintiff below did not “assent” to them so as to render them a binding part of the bailment contract.
Implicit here is the recognition of the exception to the general rule regarding such notices, namely, that they may attain the dignity of a special contract limiting liability where the bailor overtly assents to their terms.
[Citations] To assent to provisions of this sort requires more than simply placing the goods into the hands of the bailee and taking back a receipt or claim check.
Such acts are as probative of ignorance as they are of knowledge.
However, according to the agreed statement of facts, plaintiff Carr “knew” by past experience that the claim checks carried the limitation of liability statements, but he did not read them and was unaware of the specific language in them.
There is nothing in this agreed statement that Carr recalled this knowledge to present consciousness at the time of these transactions.
Obviously we all know many things which we do not recall or remember at any given time.
The assent required by law is more than this; it is, I believe, to perform an act of understanding.
There is no evidence of that here.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 686  The evidence presented tending to support the award of damages included an actual uncontroverted amount of $13.60 thereby precluding mere nominal damages.
There was further evidence that 150 exposures were lost.
The actual award of $1,014.60 amounted to between $6.00 and $7.00 per picture.
Carr provided evidence that the pictures were of exceptional value to him, having been taken in a once-in-a-lifetime European trip costing $6000 [about $33,000 in 2110 dollars], including visits arranged there before hand with relatives.
The award was fair and just compensation for the loss of value to the owner and does not include sentimental or fanciful value.
The trial court judgment should be affirmed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
Four out of eighteen rolls of film were not returned to the bailor, Mr. Carr.
The court here affirmed a judgment for about $6 per lost image.
How could an image taken by an amateur photographer be worth $6 a piece?
2.
The European trip cost him $6,000 in 1970; he asked for $10,000 (about $55,000 in 2010 dollars).
Upon what basis could such damages be arrived?
What did he apparently want?
3.
What argument did the plaintiff make as to why the limitation of liability should not be enforced?
What response did the court have to that?
4.
Would it have made a difference if the plaintiff were not himself a business attorney?
Why or why not?
5.
Why did the dissent think the court of appeals’ decision to award the plaintiff $1,000 was correct and the majority’s opinion incorrect?
Bailed Goods of Sentimental Value Mieske v. Bartell Drug Co. 593 P.2d 1308 (Wash. 1979) Brachtenbach, J.
This case determines the measure of damages for personal property, developed movie film, which is destroyed, and which cannot be replaced or reproduced.
It also decides the legal effect of a clause which purports to limit the responsibility of a film processor to replacement of film.… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 687  The facts are that over a period of years the plaintiffs had taken movie films of their family activities.
The films started with the plaintiffs’ wedding and honeymoon and continued through vacations in Mexico, Hawaii and other places, Christmas gatherings, birthdays, Little League participation by their son, family pets, building of their home and irreplaceable pictures of members of their family, such as the husband’s brother, who are now deceased.
Plaintiffs had 32 50-foot reels of such developed film which they wanted spliced together into four reels for convenience of viewing.
Plaintiff wife visited defendant Bartell’s camera department, with which she had dealt as a customer for at least 10 years.
She was told that such service could be performed.
The films were put in the order which plaintiffs desired them to be spliced and so marked.
They were then placed in four separate paper bags which in turn were placed in one large bag and delivered to the manager of Bartell.
The plaintiff wife explained the desired service and the manner in which the films were assembled in the various bags.
The manager placed a film processing packet on the bag and gave plaintiff wife a receipt which contained this language: “We assume no responsibility beyond retail cost of film unless otherwise agreed to in writing.” There was no discussion about the language on the receipt.
Rather, plaintiff wife told the manager, “Don’t lose these.
They are my life.” Bartell sent the film package to defendant GAF Corporation, which intended to send them to another processing lab for splicing.
Plaintiffs assumed that Bartell did this service and were unaware of the involvement of two other firms.
The bag of films arrived at the processing lab of GAF.
The manager of the GAF lab described the service ordered and the packaging as very unusual.
Yet it is undisputed that the film was in the GAF lab at the end of one day and gone the next morning.
The manager immediately searched the garbage disposal dumpster which already had been emptied.
The best guess is that the plaintiffs’ film went from GAF’s lab to the garbage dumpster to a truck to a barge to an up- Sound landfill where it may yet repose.
After several inquiries to Bartell, plaintiff wife was advised to call GAF.
Not surprisingly, after being advised of the complete absence and apparent fatality of plaintiffs’ films, this lawsuit ensued.… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 688  Two main issues are raised: (1) the measure of damages and (2) the effect of the exclusionary clause appearing on the film receipt.
On damages, the defendants assign error to (a) the court’s damages instruction and (b) the court’s failure to give their proposed damages instruction.
The standard of recovery for destruction of personal property was summarized in [McCurdy].
We recognized in McCurdy that (1) personal property which is destroyed may have a market value, in which case that market value is the measure of damages; (2) if destroyed property has no market value but can be replaced or reproduced, then the measure is the cost of replacement or reproduction; (3) if the destroyed property has no market value and cannot be replaced or reproduced, then the value to the owner is to be the proper measure of damages.
However, while not stated in McCurdy, we have held that in the third McCurdy situation, damages are not recoverable for the sentimental value which the owner places on the property.
[Citations] The defendants argue that plaintiffs’ property comes within the second rule of McCurdy, i.e., the film could be replaced and that their liability is limited to the cost of replacement film.
Their position is not well taken.
Defendants’ proposal would award the plaintiffs the cost of acquiring film without pictures imposed thereon.
That is not what plaintiffs lost.
Plaintiffs lost not merely film able to capture images by exposure but rather film upon which was recorded a multitude of frames depicting many significant events in their lives.
Awarding plaintiffs the funds to purchase 32 rolls of blank film is hardly a replacement of the 32 rolls of images which they had recorded over the years.
Therefore the third rule of McCurdy is the appropriate measure of damages, i.e., the property has no market value and cannot be replaced or reproduced.
The law, in those circumstances, decrees that the measure of damages is to be determined by the value to the owner, often referred to as the intrinsic value of the property.
Restatement of Torts s. 911 (1939).
Necessarily the measure of damages in these circumstances is the most imprecise of the three categories.
Yet difficulty of assessment is not cause to deny damages to a plaintiff whose property has no market value and cannot be replaced or reproduced.
[Citations] The fact that damages are difficult to ascertain and measure does not diminish the loss to the person whose property has been destroyed.
Indeed, the very statement of the rule suggests the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 689  opposite.
If one’s destroyed property has a market value, presumably its equivalent is available on the market and the owner can acquire that equivalent property.
However, if the owner cannot acquire the property in the market or by replacement or reproduction, then he simply cannot be made whole.
The problem is to establish the value to the owner.
Market and replacement values are relatively ascertainable by appropriate proof.
Recognizing that value to the owner encompasses a subjective element, the rule has been established that compensation for sentimental or fanciful values will not be allowed.
[Citations] That restriction was placed upon the jury in this case by the court’s damages instruction.… Under these rules, the court’s damages instruction was correct.
In essence it allowed recovery for the actual or intrinsic value to the plaintiffs but denied recovery for any unusual sentimental value of the film to the plaintiffs or a fanciful price which plaintiffs, for their own special reasons, might place thereon.… The next issue is to determine the legal effect of the exclusionary clause which was on the film receipt given plaintiff wife by Bartell.
As noted above, it read: “We assume no responsibility beyond retail cost of film unless otherwise agreed to in writing.” Is the exclusionary clause valid?
Defendants rely upon 2-719(3), a section of the Uniform Commercial Code, which authorizes a limitation or exclusion of consequential damages unless the limitation is unconscionable.
Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that the Uniform Commercial Code is not applicable to this transaction.…It is now clearly established that the reach of Article 2 goes considerably beyond the confines of that type transaction which the Code itself defines to be a “sale”; namely, the passing of title from a party called the seller to one denominated a buyer for a price.
Chief opportunity for this expansion is found in Section 2-102, which states that the article applies to “transactions in goods.” “Article 2 sections are finding their way into more and more decisions involving transactions which are not sales, but which are used as substitutes for a sale or which to a court appear to have attributes to which sales principles or at least some of them seem appropriate for application.…Most important of these is the application of the Article’s warranty provisions to leases, bailments, or construction contracts.
Of growing importance is the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 690  tendency of courts to find the Section on unconscionability, Section 2-302, appropriate to nonsales deals.” Application of the Uniform Commercial Code to this transaction leads to defendants’ next two contentions.
First, they urge that the code’s recognition of course of dealings and trade usage validates the exclusionary clause.
Second, defendants assign error to the grounds upon which the court found the clause to be unconscionable and therefore invalid.
Defendants contend that it is the uniform trade practice of film processors to impose an exclusionary clause similar to that contained in Bartell’s film receipt.
However, the existence of a trade usage is to be established as a fact [Citation].
It was proved as a usage among film processors, but not as between commercial film processors and their retail customers.…Consequently, defendants’ reliance on trade usage to uphold the exclusionary clause is not well founded.
As to course of dealings, the record is clear that Mrs. Mieske and the Bartell manager never discussed the exclusionary clause.
Mrs. Mieske had never read it, she viewed the numbered slip as merely a receipt.
The manager was not “too clear on what it said.” There was no showing what was the language on any other receipt given in prior dealings between the parties.
In summary, defendants’ proof fell short of that required by the express language of 1-205(3).
Defendants contend we should apply a course of dealing standard as a matter of law, but cite no authority for such proposition.
We decline the invitation.
Defendants next assert that the trial court held the exclusionary clause to be unconscionable without considering the rules laid down in Schroeder v. Fageol Motors, Inc., 544 P.2d 20 (1975).
In Schroeder, we recognized that the term unconscionable is not defined in the Uniform Commercial Code.
We acknowledge that the code mandates the court to determine unconscionability as a matter of law, 2-302(1).
Schroeder held that numerous factors enter into a determination of unconscionability.
No one element is controlling.
The court must examine all the circumstances surrounding the transaction, including conspicuousness of the clause, prior course of dealings between the parties, negotiations about the clause, the commercial setting and usage of the trade.
Not each element will be applicable factually to every transaction.… Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 691  The real question is whether the court considered the necessary elements of Schroeder.
A review of the record convinces us that it did.
The court had the facts, the Schroeder case was argued, the criteria set forth therein were discussed by defendants’ counsel both on objections and on exceptions.
There was no error.
Judgment affirmed.
CASE QUESTIONS 1.
This case presents pretty much the same fact situation as the previous one, but it comes out the other way.
Why?
What’s the difference?
2.
The court said there could be “recovery for the actual or intrinsic value to the plaintiffs but [not for] for any unusual sentimental value of the film to the plaintiffs or a fanciful price which plaintiffs, for their own special reasons, might place thereon.” What actual value does a role of film have if not sentimental value, and if the court were not concerned about the sentimental value, why did it mention all the irreplaceable memories recorded on the film— what difference would it make what was on the film if it had an ascertainable “actual value”?
3.
Determining that this bailment was governed by the UCC opened up three lines of argument for the defendant.
What were they?
4.
Why did the court here say the disclaimer was unconscionable?
Liability of Carrier; Limitations on Liability Calvin Klein Ltd. v. Trylon Trucking Corp. 892 F.2d 191C.A.2 (N.Y. 1989) Miner, J. Defendant-appellant Trylon Trucking Corp. (“Trylon”) appeals from a judgment…in favor of plaintiff-appellee Calvin Klein Ltd. (“Calvin Klein”) for the full value of a lost shipment of clothing.
The appeal presents a novel issue under New York law: whether a limitation of liability agreement between a shipper and a carrier is enforceable when the shipment is lost as a result of the carrier’s gross negligence.
The district court held that the parties’ customary limitation of liability agreement did not extend to the shipment at issue, due to the absence of assent and consideration.
The court observed that, had there been such an agreement, the liability of the carrier for its gross negligence would be limited.
For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the district Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 692  court, find that the parties agreed to the limitation of liability, and determine that the agreement limits Trylon’s liability for its gross negligence.… Trylon is a New Jersey trucking firm which engaged in the business of transporting goods from New York City’s airports for delivery to its customers’ facilities.
Calvin Klein, a New York clothing company, had used the services of Trylon for at least three years, involving hundreds of shipments, prior to the lost shipment at issue.
In past deliveries Calvin Klein, through its customs broker, would contact Trylon to pick up the shipment from the airport for delivery to Calvin Klein’s facility.
After completing the carriage, Trylon would forward to Calvin Klein an invoice, which contained a limitation of liability provision as follows: In consideration of the rate charged, the shipper agrees that the carrier shall not be liable for more than $50.00 on any shipment accepted for delivery to one consignee unless a greater value is declared, in writing, upon receipt at time of shipment and charge for such greater value paid, or agreed to be paid, by the shipper.
A shipment of 2,833 blouses from Hong Kong arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport for Calvin Klein on March 27, 1986.
Calvin Klein arranged for Trylon to pick up the shipment and deliver it to Calvin Klein’s New Jersey warehouse.
On April 2, Trylon dispatched its driver, Jamahl Jefferson, to pick up this shipment.
Jefferson signed a receipt for the shipment from Calvin Klein’s broker.
By April 2, the parties discovered that Jefferson had stolen Trylon’s truck and its shipment.
The shipment never was recovered.
Calvin Klein sent a claim letter to Trylon for the full value of the lost blouses.
In the absence of any response by Trylon, Calvin Klein filed this action…to recover $150,000, allegedly the value of the lost shipment.… In their stipulation in lieu of a jury trial, the parties agreed that Trylon is liable to Calvin Klein for the loss of the shipment and that Trylon was grossly negligent in the hiring and supervision of Jefferson.
They also agreed that “[t]he terms and conditions of [Trylon]’s carriage [were] that liability for loss or damage to cargo is limited to $50 in accordance with the legend on Trylon’s invoice forms.” Calvin Klein conceded that it was aware of this limitation of liability, and that it did not declare a value on the blouses at the time of shipment.
The parties left at issue whether the limitation of liability clause was valid and enforceable.
Calvin Klein argued in the district court, as it does here, that the limitation clause was not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 693  enforceable for two reasons: no agreement existed between Calvin Klein and Trylon as to the limitation of liability; and, if such an agreement existed, public policy would prevent its enforcement because of Trylon’s gross negligence.
The district court applied New York law, finding that the carriage was exempt from the Interstate Commerce Commission’s jurisdiction, being entirely within the New York City commercial zone.… A common carrier…under New York law is strictly liable for the loss of goods in its custody.
“Where the loss is not due to the excepted causes [that is, act of God or public enemy, inherent nature of goods, or shipper’s fault], it is immaterial whether the carrier was negligent or not.…” [Citations] Even in the case of loss from theft by third parties, liability may be imposed up on a negligent common carrier.
[Citation] A shipper and a common carrier may contract to limit the carrier’s liability in cases of loss to an amount agreed to by the parties [Citations], so long as the language of the limitation is clear, the shipper is aware of the terms of the limitation, and the shipper can change the terms by indicating the true value of the goods being shipped.
[Citations]…(similar scheme under Interstate Commerce Act).
Such a limitation agreement is generally valid and enforceable despite carrier negligence.
The limitation of liability provision involved here clearly provides that, at the time of delivery, the shipper may increase the limitation by written notice of the value of the goods to be delivered and by payment of a commensurately higher fee.
The parties stipulated to the fact that the $50 limitation of liability was a term and condition of carriage and that Calvin Klein was aware of that limitation.
This stipulated fact removes the first issue, namely whether an agreement existed as to a liability limitation between the parties, from this case.
Calvin Klein’s argument that it never previously acknowledged this limitation by accepting only $50 in settlement of a larger loss does not alter this explicit stipulation.
“[A] stipulation of fact that is fairly entered into is controlling on the parties and the court is bound to enforce it.” [Citations] Neither party here has argued that the stipulation was unfairly entered into.… The remaining issue concerns the enforceability of the limitation clause in light of Trylon’s conceded gross negligence.
The district court considered that, assuming an agreement between Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 694  the parties as to Trylon’s liability, Trylon’s gross negligence would not avoid the enforcement of a limitation clause.
The district court found that New York law, as opposed to federal interstate commerce law, applies in this case.
The parties do not seriously contest this choice of law.
With the choice thus unchallenged, we must apply both established New York law as well as our belief of how the New York Court of Appeals would rule if this case were before it.… Although the New York Court of Appeals has addressed a limitation of liability provision in the context of a contract between an airline and a passenger, [Citation] (refusing to enforce unilateral limitation provision for death of passenger due to defendant’s negligence), that court has never been called upon to enforce a limitation provision in the case of a grossly negligent common carrier of goods.
The various departments of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court have addressed whether gross negligence bars enforcement of limitations of liability in the context of contracts for the installation, maintenance and monitoring of burglar alarm systems and are divided on the issue.
Compare [Citation] (enforcing limitation despite gross negligence) and [Citation] (even if gross negligence were established, plaintiff’s recovery would be limited by limitation clause) with [Citation] (limitation clause cannot limit liability for gross negligence) and [Citation] (finding “no significant distinction” between complete exculpation and limitation “to a nominal sum,” therefore limitation is ineffective).
The First Department distinguished between exculpatory provisions and limitation provisions, indicating that the latter would be effective even if the former are unenforceable due to the contracting party’s gross negligence.
[Citations].…The other departments which have considered the question applied the holding of [Citation], that “[a]greements which purport to exempt a party from liability for willful or grossly negligent acts are contrary to public policy and are void.”… Absent a rule of decision formulated by the New York Court of Appeals, we are not bound by the opinions issued by the state’s lower courts.… In the absence of direct New York authority, we must make our best estimate as to how New York’s highest court would rule in this case.
In making that determination, we are free to consider all the resources the highest court of the state could use, including decisions reached in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 695  other jurisdictions.…We believe that the New York Court of Appeals would not differentiate between gross negligence and ordinary negligence in recognizing the validity of the limitation of liability in this case.
Since carriers are strictly liable for loss of shipments in their custody and are insurers of these goods, the degree of carrier negligence is immaterial.
[Citation] The common carrier must exercise reasonable care in relation to the shipment in its custody.
U.C.C.
§ 7-309(1).
Carriers can contract with their shipping customers on the amount of liability each party will bear for the loss of a shipment, regardless of the degree of carrier negligence.
See U.C.C.
§ 7-309(2) (allowing limitation of liability for losses from any cause save carrier conversion).
Unlike the parachute school student, see [Citation], or the merchant acquiring a burglar alarm, the shipper can calculate the specific amount of its potential damages in advance, declare the value of the shipment based on that calculation, and pay a commensurately higher rate to carry the goods, in effect buying additional insurance from the common carrier.
In this case, Calvin Klein and Trylon were business entities with an on-going commercial relationship involving numerous carriages of Calvin Klein’s goods by Trylon.
Where such entities deal with each other in a commercial setting, and no special relationship exists between the parties, clear limitations between them will be enforced.
[Citation].
Here, each carriage was under the same terms and conditions as the last, including a limitation of Trylon’s liability.
See [Citation] (court enforced limitation on shipper who possessed over five years of the carrier’s manifests which included the $50 limitation).
This is not a case in which the shipper was dealing with the common carrier for the first time or contracting under new or changed terms.
Calvin Klein was aware of the terms and was free to adjust the limitation upon a written declaration of the value of a given shipment, but failed to do so with the shipment at issue here.
Since Calvin Klein failed to adjust the limitation, the limitation applies here, and no public policy that dictates otherwise can be identified.
Calvin Klein now argues that the limitation is so low as to be void.…This amount is immaterial because Calvin Klein had the opportunity to negotiate the amount of coverage by declaring the value of the shipment.…Commercial entities can easily negotiate the degree of risk each party will bear and which party will bear the cost of insurance.
That this dispute actually involves who Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 696  will bear the cost of insurance is illustrated by the fact that this case has been litigated not by the principal parties, but by their insurers.
Calvin Klein could have increased Trylon’s coverage by declaring the value of its shipment, but did not do so.
Calvin Klein had the opportunity to declare a higher value and we find all of its arguments relating to the unreasonableness of the limitation to be without merit.
We reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment against defendant in the sum of $50.

18.6 Summary and Exercises Summary Ownership and sale of goods are not the only important legal relationships involving goods.
In a modern economy, possession of goods is often temporarily surrendered without surrendering title.
This creates a bailment, which is defined as the lawful possession of goods by one who is not the owner.
To create a bailment, the goods must be in the possession of the bailee.
Possession requires physical control and intent.
Whether the owner or someone else must bear a loss often hinges on whether the other person is or is not a bailee.
The bailee’s liability for loss depends on the circumstances.
Some courts use a straightforward standard of ordinary care.
Others use a tripartite test, depending on whether the bailment was Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 697  for the benefit of the owner (the standard then is gross negligence), for the bailee (extraordinary care), or for both (ordinary care).
Bailees may disclaim liability unless they have failed to give adequate notice or unless public policy prohibits disclaimers.
A bailee who converts the property will be held liable as an insurer.
A bailor may have liability toward the bailee—for example, for negligent failure to warn of hazards in the bailed property and for strict liability if the injury was caused by a dangerous object in a defective condition.
Special bailments arise in the cases of innkeepers (who have an insurer’s liability toward their guests, although many state statutes provide exceptions to this general rule), warehouses, carriers, and leases.
A warehouser is defined as a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire.
The general standard of care is the same as that of ordinary negligence.
Many states have statutes imposing a higher standard.
A common carrier—one who holds himself out to all for hire to transport goods—has an insurer’s liability toward the goods in his possession, with five exceptions: act of God, act of public enemy, act of public authority, negligence of shipper, and inherent nature of the goods.
Because many carriers are involved in most commercial shipments of goods, the law places liability on the initial carrier.
The carrier’s liability begins once the shipper has given all instructions and taken all action required of it.
The carrier’s absolute liability ends when it has delivered the goods to the consignee’s place of business or residence (unless the agreement states otherwise) or, if no delivery is required, when the consignee has been notified of the arrival of the goods and has had a reasonable opportunity to take possession.
Commodity paper—any document of title—may be negotiated; that is, through proper indorsements on the paper, title may be transferred without physically touching the goods.
A duly negotiated document gives the holder title to the document and to the goods, certain rights to the goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued, and the right to take possession free of any defense or claim by the issuer of the document of title.
Certain rules limit the seemingly absolute right of the holder to take title better than that held by the transferor.

Joe Andrews delivered his quarter horse I’ll Call Ya (worth about $319,000 in 2010 dollars) to Harold Stone for boarding and stabling.
Later he asked Stone if Stone could arrange for the horse’s transportation some distance, and Stone engaged the services of the Allen brothers for that purpose.
Andrews did not know the Allens, but Stone had previously done business with them.
On the highway the trailer with I’ll Call Ya in it became disengaged from the Allens’ truck and rolled over.
The mare, severely injured, “apparently lingered for several hours on the side of the road before she died without veterinary treatment.” The evidence was that the Allens had properly secured the horse’s head at the front of the trailer and used all other equipment that a reasonably prudent person would use to secure and haul the horse; that the ball was the proper size and in good condition; that the ball was used without incident to haul other trailers after the accident; that Ronny Allen was driving at a safe speed and in a safe manner immediately before the accident; that after the accident the sleeve of the trailer hitch was still in the secured position; and that they made a reasonable effort to obtain veterinary treatment for the animal after the accident.
The court determined this was a mutual-benefit bailment.
Are the Allens liable?

Fisher Corporation, a manufacturer of electronic equipment, delivered VCRs to Consolidated Freightways’ warehouse in California for shipment to World Radio Inc., an electronics retailer in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
World Radio rejected the shipments as duplicative, and they were returned to Consolidated’s terminal in Sarpy County, Nebraska, pending Fisher’s instructions.
The VCRs were loaded onto a trailer; the doors of the trailer were sealed but not padlocked, and the trailer was parked at the south end of the terminal.
Padlocks were not used on any trailers so as not to call attention to a trailer containing expensive cargo.
The doors of the trailer faced away from the terminal toward a cyclone fence that encircled the yard.
Two weeks later, on Sunday, July 15, a supervisor checked the grounds and found nothing amiss.
On Tuesday, July 17, Consolidated’s employees discovered a 3 × 5 foot hole had been cut in the fence near the trailer, and half the VCRs were gone; they were never recovered.
Consolidated received Fisher’s return authorization after the theft occurred.
If Consolidated is considered a carrier, it would be strictly liable for the loss; if it is considered a bailee, it is not liable unless negligent.
Which is it?

Mrs. Carter, Plaintiff, took her fur coat to Reichlin Furriers for cleaning, glazing, and storage until the next winter season.
She was given a printed receipt form on the front of which Furrier’s employee had written “$100” as the coat’s value, though Mrs. Carter did not discuss its value with the employee, did not know that such a value had been noted, and didn’t read the receipt.
A space for the customer’s signature on the front of the receipt was blank; below this in prominent type was this notice: “see reverse side for terms and conditions.” On the back was a statement that this was a storage contract and the customer would be bound by the terms unless contrary notice was given within ten days.
There were fifteen conditions, one of which was the following: “Storage charges are based upon valuation herein declared by the depositor and amount recoverable for loss or damage shall not exceed…the depositor’s valuation appearing in this receipt.” Six months later, when Mrs. Carter sought to retrieve her coat, she was informed by Furrier that it was lost.
Carter sued Furrier for $450 (about $2,200 in 2010 dollars); Furrier claimed its liability was limited to $100.

Michael Capezzaro (Plaintiff) reported to the police that he had been robbed of $30,000 (in 2010 dollars) at gunpoint by a woman.
The next day police arrested a woman with $9,800 in her possession.
Plaintiff identified her as the woman who had robbed him, and the money was impounded as evidence.
Two years later the case against her was dismissed because she was determined to have been insane when she committed the crime, and the money in the police property room was released to her.
Plaintiff then sued the police department, which claimed it was “obligated to return the money to [the woman] as bailor.” Who wins and why?

Harley Hightower delivered his Cadillac to Auto Auction, where it was damaged.
Auto Auction defended itself against Hightower’s claim that it was a negligent bailee by asserting (1) that he had not met the required burden of proof that a proximate cause of the injury was Auto Auction’s negligence because it introduced evidence that negligence of a third party was a proximate cause of the damage to his car and (2) that it was entitled to judgment in the absence of evidence of specific acts of negligence of the bailee.
There was evidence that a Mrs.
Tune drove her automobile onto the lot to sell it and parked it where she was directed to; that the automobiles on said lot for sale were ordinarily lined up and numbered by Auto Auction; that Plaintiff’s Cadillac was not so parked by the auction company but was parked so that if Mrs. Tune’s automobile continued forward it would strike Hightower’s Cadillac broadside; that when Mrs.
Tune stopped her Buick and alighted, her car rolled down the incline on the lot toward Hightower’s car; that she attempted to stop her car but it knocked her down and continued rolling toward appellee’s Cadillac and, finally, struck and damaged it.

Everlena Mitchell contracted in writing with All American Van & Storage to transport and store her household goods and furnishings, and she was to pay all charges incurred on a monthly basis.
As security she granted All American a warehouser’s lien giving it the right to sell the property if the charges remained unpaid for three months and if, in the opinion of the company, such action would be necessary to protect accrued charges.
Everlena fell eight months in arrears and on October 20 she received notice that the amount owed was to be paid by October 31, 1975.
The notice also stated that if payment was not made, her goods and furnishings would be sold on November 7, 1975.
Everlena had a pending claim with the Social Security Administration, and advised All American that she would be receiving a substantial sum of money soon from the Social Services Administration; this was confirmed by two government agents.
However, All American would not postpone the sale.
Everlena’s property was sold on November 7, 1975, for $925.50.
Near the end of November 1975, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 701  Everlena received approximately $5,500 (about $22,000 in 2010 dollars) from the United States as a disability payment under the Social Security Act, and she sued All American for improperly selling her goods.
The trial court ruled for All American on summary judgment.

Baker’s Transfer & Storage Company, Defendant, hauled household goods and personal effects by trucks “anywhere for hire.” Its trucks did not travel on regular routes or between established terminals; it hauled household goods and personal effects on private contracts with the owners as and when the opportunity presented itself.
Baker contracted to haul the Klein family’s household goods from Bakersfield, California, to Hollywood.
En route the goods were destroyed by fire without Baker’s negligence.
Baker’s contract provided it would redeliver the property “damage by the elements excepted.” If Baker were a common carrier, its liability would be statutorily limited to less than the amount ordered by the trial court; if it were a private carrier, its liability would be either based on ordinary negligence or as the parties’ contract provided.
