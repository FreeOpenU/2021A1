TheGalapagosTortoises The Galapagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador in South America, are famous for the amazing diversity and uniqueness of life they possess.
One of the most famous Galapagos residents is the Galapagos Giant Tortoise, whichisfoundnowhereelseonearth.

AnIntroductiontoAnalyzingStatisticalData The tortoises lived on nine of the Galapagos Islands, and each island developed its own unique species of tortoise.
Infact,onthelargestisland,therearefourvolcanoes,andeachvolcanohasitsownspecies.
Whenﬁrstdiscovered, itwasestimatedthatthetortoisepopulationoftheislandswasaround250,000.
Unfortunately,onceEuropeanships andsettlersstartedarriving,thosenumbersbegantoplummet.
Becausethetortoisescouldsurviveforlongperiods of time without food or water, expeditions would stop at the islands and take the tortoises to sustain their crews with fresh meat and other supplies for the long voyages.
Also, settlers brought in domesticated animals like goats andpigsthatdestroyedthetortoises’habitat.

A researcher studying Galapagos Tortoises would be interested in collecting information about different character- istics of the tortoises.
Those characteristics are called variables.
Each column of the previous ﬁgure contains a variable.

Thelastthreecolumnsofthepreviousﬁgureprovideinformationinwhichthecount,orquantity,ofthecharacteristic is most important.
For example, we are interested in the total number of each species of tortoise, or how many individuals there are per square kilometer.
This type of variable is called a numerical variable, or quantitative variable.

IntheGalapagos,itwouldbeverydifﬁcultandperhaps evendestructivetosearcheverysquaremeterofthehabitattobesurethatyoucountedeverytortoise.
Inanexample closer to home, it is very expensive to get accurate and complete information about all the residents of the United Statestohelpeffectivelyaddresstheneedsofachangingpopulation.
Thisiswhyacompletecounting,orcensus,is onlyattemptedeverytenyears.
Becauseoftheseproblems,itiscommontouseasmaller,representativegroupfrom thepopulation,calledasample.
Youmayrecallthetortoisedataincludedavariablefortheestimateofthepopulationsize.
Thisnumberwasfound using a sample and is actually just an approximation of the true number of tortoises.
If a researcher wanted to ﬁnd an estimate for the population of a species of tortoises, she would go into the ﬁeld and locate and mark a number of tortoises.
She would then use statistical techniques that we will discuss later in this text to obtain an estimate for the total numberof tortoises in the population.
In statistics, we call the actual number oftortoises a parameter.
Anynumberthatdescribestheindividualsinasample(length,weight,age)iscalledastatistic.
Eachstatisticisan estimateofaparameter,whosevaluemayormaynotbeknown.
ErrorsinSampling We have to accept that estimates derived from using a sample have a chance of being inaccurate.
This cannot be avoided unless we measure the entire population.
The researcher has to accept that there could be variations in the sampleduetochancethatleadtochangesinthepopulationestimate.
Astatisticianwouldreporttheestimateofthe parameter in two ways: as a point estimate (e.g., 915) and also as an interval estimate.
For example, a statistician wouldreport: “Iamfairlyconﬁdentthatthetruenumberoftortoisesisactuallybetween561and1075.”Thisrange of values is the unavoidable result of using a sample, and not due to some mistake that was made in the process of collecting and analyzing the sample.
The difference between the true parameter and the statistic obtained by samplingiscalledsamplingerror.

LessonSummary In statistics, the total group being studied is called the population.
The individuals (people, animals, or things) in thepopulationarecalledunits.
Thecharacteristicsofthoseindividualsofinteresttousarecalledvariables.
Those variablesareoftwotypes: numerical,orquantitative,andcategorical,orqualitative.
Because of the difﬁculties of obtaining information about all units in a population, it is common to use a small, representative subset of the population, called a sample.
An actual value of a population variable (for example, 51.1.
StatisticalTerminology www.ck12.org numberoftortoises,averageweightofalltortoises,etc.)
iscalledaparameter.
Anestimateofaparameterderived fromasampleiscalledastatistic.
Wheneverasampleisusedinsteadoftheentirepopulation,wehavetoacceptthatourresultsaremerelyestimates, andtherefore,havesomechanceofbeingincorrect.
Thisiscalledsamplingerror.

AnOverviewofData www.ck12.org 1.2 An Overview of Data LearningObjective • Givenatypeofmeasurement,identifythecorrectlevelofmeasurement: nominal,ordinal,interval,orratio.
Introduction Thislessonisanoverviewofthebasicconsiderationsinvolvedwithcollectingandanalyzingdata.
LevelsofMeasurement In the ﬁrst lesson, you learned about the different types of variables that statisticians use to describe the character- istics of a population.
Some researchers and social scientists use a more detailed distinction, called the levels of measurement, when examining the information that is collected for a variable.
This widely accepted (though not universallyused)theorywasﬁrstproposedbytheAmericanpsychologistStanleySmithStevensin1946.
According toStevens’theory,thefourlevelsofmeasurementarenominal,ordinal,interval,andratio.
Eachofthesefourlevelsreferstotherelationshipbetweenthevaluesofthevariable.
Nominalmeasurement Anominalmeasurement isoneinwhichthevaluesofthevariablearenames.
Thenamesofthedifferentspeciesof Galapagostortoisesareanexampleofanominalmeasurement.
Thedwellinginwhichyoulive-house,apartment, townhouse,condominium,treehouse-isanotherexampleofnominalmeasurement.
Ordinalmeasurement An ordinal measurement involves collecting information of which the order is somehow signiﬁcant.
The name of this level is derived from the use of ordinal numbers for ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
If we measured the different speciesoftortoisefromthelargestpopulationtothesmallest,thiswouldbeanexampleofordinalmeasurement.
In ordinal measurement, the distance between two consecutive values does not have meaning.
The 1st and 2nd largest tortoisepopulationsbyspeciesmaydifferbyafewthousandindividuals,whilethe7th and8th mayonlydifferbya fewhundred.
Another example of ordinal data is the satisfaction rating scale, sometimes called a Likert scale, which orders responses such as 1 = Strongly Agree, 2 = Agree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Disagree, 5 = Strongly Disagree.
Even when numbersareattachedtotheseresponses,theyarestillconsideredordinaldata.
Intervalmeasurement With interval measurement, there is signiﬁcance to the distance between any two values.
An example commonly citedforintervalmeasurementistemperature(eitherdegreesCelsiusordegreesFahrenheit).
Achangeof1degree is the same if the temperature goes from 0◦ C to 1◦ C as it is when the temperature goes from 40◦ C to 41◦ C. In addition,thereismeaningtothevaluesbetweenthenumbers.
Thatis,ahalfofadegreehasmeaning.

Avariablemeasuredatthislevelnotonlyincludestheconceptsoforderandinterval,butalsoadds the idea of ’nothingness’, or zero.
With the temperature scale of the previous example, 0◦ C is really an arbitrarily chosen number (the temperature at which water freezes) and does not represent the absence of temperature.
As a result,theratiobetweentemperaturesisrelative,and40◦ C,forexample,isnot twiceashotas20◦ C.Ontheother hand, for the Galapagos tortoises, the idea of a species having a population of 0 individuals is all too real!
As a result,theestimatesofthepopulationsaremeasuredonaratiolevel,andaspecieswithapopulationofabout3,300 reallyisapproximatelythreetimesaslargeasonewithapopulationnear1,100.
ComparingtheLevelsofMeasurement Using Stevens’ theory can help make distinctions in the type of data that the numerical/categorical classiﬁcation couldnot.
Let’suseanexamplefromtheprevioussectiontohelpshowhowyoucouldcollectdataatdifferentlevels of measurement from the same population.
Assume your school wants to collect data about all the students in the school.
If we collect information about the students’ gender, race, political opinions, or the town or sub-division in which theylive,wehaveanominalmeasurement.
If we collect data about the students’ year in school, we are now ordering that data numerically (9th, 10th,11th, or 12th grade),andthus,wehaveanordinalmeasurement.
If wegather datafor students’ SATmath scores, wehave an intervalmeasurement.

LessonSummary Datacanbemeasuredatdifferentlevels,dependingonthetypeofvariableandtheamountofdetailthatiscollected.
A widely used method for categorizing the different types of measurement breaks them down into four groups.
Nominal data is measured by classiﬁcation or categories.
Ordinal data uses numerical categories that convey a 91.2.
AnOverviewofData www.ck12.org meaningful order.
Interval measurements show order, and the spaces between the values also have signiﬁcant meaning.
In ratio measurement, the ratio between any two values has meaning, because the data include a true zerovalue.

AnIntroductiontoAnalyzingStatisticalData 1.3 Measures of Center LearningObjectives • Calculatethemean,median,andmodeforasetofdata,andcompareandcontrastthesemeasuresofcenter.
• Identifythesymbolsandknowtheformulasforsampleandpopulationmeans.
• Calculatetheweightedmean,percentiles,andquartilesforadataset.
Introduction Thislessonisanoverviewofsomeofthebasicstatisticsusedtomeasurethecenterofasetofdata.
MeasuresofCentralTendency Once data are collected, it is useful to summarize the data set by identifying a value around which the data are centered.
Threecommonlyusedmeasuresofcenterarethemode,themedian,andthemean.
Mode The mode is deﬁned as the most frequently occurring number in a data set.
The mode is most useful in situations that involve categorical (qualitative) data that are measured at the nominal level.
In the last chapter, we referred to the data with the Galapagos tortoises and noted that the variable ’Climate Type’ was such a measurement.
For this example,themodeisthevalue’humid’.
Example: The students in a statistics class were asked to report the number of children that live in their house (includingbrothersandsisterstemporarilyawayatcollege).
Thedataarerecordedbelow: 1,3,4,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,6 In this example, the mode could be a useful statistic that would tell us something about the families of statistics students in our school.
In this case, 2 is the mode, as it is the most frequently occurring number of children in the sample,tellingusthatmoststudentsintheclasscomefromfamilieswherethereare2children.
Iftherewereseven3-childhouseholdsandseven2-childhouseholds, wewouldsaythedatasethastwomodes.
In other words, the data would be bimodal.
When a data set is described as being bimodal, it is clustered about two differentmodes.
Technically,ifthereweremorethantwo,theywouldallbethemode.
However,themoreofthem thereare,themoretrivialthemodebecomes.
Inthesecases,wewouldmostlikelysearchforadifferentstatisticto describethecenterofsuchdata.
Ifthereisanequalnumberofeachdatavalue,themodeisnotusefulinhelpingusunderstandthedata,andthus,we saythedatasethasnomode.
Mean Another measure of central tendency is the arithmetic average, or mean.
This value is calculated by adding all the data values and dividing the sum by the total number of data points.
The mean is the numerical balancing point of thedataset.

OutliersandResistance Themeanandthemedianaresodifferentinthisexamplebecausethereisonegradethatisextremelydifferentfrom the rest of the data.
In statistics, we call such extreme values outliers.
The mean is affected by the presence of an outlier; however, the median is not.
A statistic that is not affected by outliers is called resistant.
We say that the medianisaresistantmeasureofcenter,andthemeanisnotresistant.
Inasense,themedianisabletoresistthe pull of a far away value, but the mean is drawn to such values.
It cannot resist the inﬂuence of outlier values.
As a result, when we have a data set that contains an outlier, it is often better to use the median to describe the center, ratherthanthemean.
Example: In2005, theCEOofYahoo, TerrySemel, waspaidalmost$231,000,000.
Thisiscertainlynottypicalof what the average worker at Yahoo could expect to make.
Instead of using the mean salary to describe how Yahoo paysitsemployees,itwouldbemoreappropriatetousethemediansalaryofalltheemployees.

OtherMeasuresofCenter WeightedMean Theweightedmeanisamethodofcalculatingthemeanwhereinsteadofeachdatapointcontributingequallytothe mean, some data points contribute more than others.
This could be because they appear more often or because a decisionwasmadetoincreasetheirimportance(givethemmoreweight).
Themostcommontypeofweighttouse is the frequency, which is the number of times each number is observed in the data.
When we calculated the mean for the children living at home, we could have used a weighted mean calculation.
The calculation would look like this: 14www.ck12.org Chapter1.
AnIntroductiontoAnalyzingStatisticalData (5)(1)+(8)(2)+(5)(3)+(2)(4)+(1)(5)+(1)(6) 22 Thesymbolicrepresentationofthisisasfollows: x¯= ∑fx ∑f where: xisthedatavalue f isthefrequency,howmanytimesaparticulardatavaluexoccurs ∑f isthesumofallthefrequencies,whichisthesameasn,thenumberofpiecesofdatayouhave PercentilesandQuartiles A percentile is a statistic that identiﬁes the percentage of the data that is less than the given value.
The most commonly used percentile is the median.
Because it is in the numeric middle of the data, half of the data is below the median.
Therefore, we could also call the median the 50th percentile.
A 40th percentile would be a value in which40%ofthenumbersarelessthanthatobservation.
Example: To check a child’s physical development, pediatricians use height and weight charts that help them to know how the child compares to children of the same age.
A child whose height is in the 70th percentile is taller than70%ofchildrenofthesameage.
Twoverycommonlyusedpercentilesarethe25th and75th percentiles.
Themedian,25th,and75th percentilesdivide thedataintofourparts.
Becauseofthis,the25th percentileisnotatedasQ andiscalledthelowerquartile,andthe 1 75th percentile is notated as Q and is called the upper quartile.
The median is a middle quartile and is sometimes 3 referredtoasQ .
2 Example: Let’sreturntothepreviousdataset,whichisasfollows: 1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,6 Recallthatthemedian(50th percentile)is2.

However,itislimited,becauseitonlyinvolvestwovaluesinthedataset,anditisnotresistant tooutliers.
InterquartileRange The interquartilerange isthe differencebetween the Q and Q , andit isabbreviated IQR.
Thus, IQR=Q −Q .
3 1 3 1 The IQR gives information about how the middle 50% of the data are spread.
Fifty percent of the data values are alwaysbetweenQ andQ .
3 1 Example: A recent study proclaimed Mobile, Alabama the wettest city in America (http://www.livescience.com/e nvironment/070518_rainy_cities.html).
The following table lists measurements of the approximate annual rainfall inMobileforthelast10years.

Source: http://www.cwop1353.com/CoopGaugeDat a.htm First, place the data in order from smallest to largest.
The range is the difference between the minimum and maximumrainfallamounts.
ToﬁndtheIQR,ﬁrstidentifythequartiles,andthencomputeQ −Q .
3 1 In this example, the range tells us that there is a difference of 44 inches of rainfall between the wettest and driest years in Mobile.
The IQR shows that there is a difference of 22 inches of rainfall, even in the middle 50% of the data.
Itappears thatMobile experiences wideﬂuctuations inyearly rainfalltotals, which mightbe explained byits positionneartheGulfofMexicoanditsexposuretotropicalstormsandhurricanes.
StandardDeviation Thestandarddeviationisanextremelyimportantmeasureofspreadthatisbasedonthemean.
Recallthatthemean is the numerical balancing point of the data.
One way to measure how the data are spread is to look at how far awayeachofthevaluesisfromthemean.
Thedifferencebetweenadatavalueandthemeaniscalledthedeviation.
Writtensymbolically,itwouldbeasfollows: Deviation=x−x Let’stakethesimpledatasetofthreemeasurementsshownbelow: 9.5,11.5,12 Themeanofthisdatasetis11.

Points that are above the meanhavepositivedeviations.
The standard deviation is a measure of the typical, or average, deviation for all of the data points from the mean.
However, the very property that makes the mean so special also makes it tricky to calculate a standard deviation.
Becausethemeanisthebalancingpointofthedata,whenyouaddthedeviations,theyalwayssumto0.

ObservedData Deviations 9.5 9.5−11=−1.5 11.5 11.5−11=0.5 12 12−11=1 Sumofdeviations −1.5+0.5+1=0 Therefore, we need all the deviations to be positive before we add them up.
One way to do this would be to make them positive by taking their absolute values.
This is a technique we use for a similar measure called the mean absolutedeviation.
Forthestandarddeviation,though,wesquareallthedeviations.
Thesquareofanyrealnumber isalwayspositive.

Inﬁndingthestandarddeviation,however,wedividebyn−1.
Inthisexample,sincen=3,wedivide by 2.
The result, which is called the variance, is 1.75.
The variance of a sample is denoted by s2 and is a measure of how closely the data are clustered around the mean.
Because we squared the deviations before we added them, theunitswewereworkinginwerealsosquared.
Toreturntotheoriginalunits,wemusttakethesquarerootofour √ result: 1.75≈1.32.

So, whiletheaverageofeachofthesestudentsisthesame(50), oneofthemisconsistentintheworkhe/shedoes, and the other is not.
This raises questions: Why did student 1 get a zero on the second quiz when he/she had a perfect paper on the ﬁrst quiz?
Was the student sick?
Did the student forget about the quiz and not study?
Or was thesecondquizindicativeoftheworkthestudentcando,andwastheﬁrstquiztheonethatwasquestionable?
Did thestudentcheatontheﬁrstquiz?
There is one more question that we haven’t answered regarding standard deviation, and that is, "Why n−1?"
Dividing by n−1 is only necessary for the calculation of the standard deviation of a sample.
When you are calculating the standard deviation of a population, you divide by N, the number of data points in your population.
Whenyouhaveasample,youarenotgettingdatafortheentirepopulation,andthereisboundtoberandomvariation duetosampling(rememberthatthisiscalledsamplingerror).

AnIntroductiontoAnalyzingStatisticalData FIGURE1.6 the mean.
We can look at how individual points vary from the mean by subtracting the mean from the data value.
This is called the deviation.
The standard deviation is a measure of the average deviation for the entire data set.
Becausethedeviationsalwayssumtozero,weﬁndthestandarddeviationbyaddingthesquareddeviations.
When we have the entire population, the sum of the squared deviations is divided by the population size.
This value is called the variance.
Taking the square root of the variance gives the standard deviation.
For a population, the standarddeviationisdenotedbyσ.
Becauseasampleispronetorandomvariation(samplingerror),weadjustthe sample standard deviation to make it a little larger by dividing the sum of the squared deviations by one less than the number of observations.
The result of that division is the sample variance, and the square root of the sample varianceisthesamplestandarddeviation,usuallynotatedass.

FrequencyTables The earth has seemed so large in scope for thousands of years that it is only recently that many people have begun to take seriously the idea that we live on a planet of limited and dwindling resources.
This is something that residents of the Galapagos Islands are also beginning to understand.
Because of its isolation and lack of resources to support large, modernized populations of humans, the problems that we face on a global level are magniﬁed in theGalapagos.
Basichumanresourcessuchaswater,food,fuel,andbuildingmaterialsmustallbebroughtintothe islands.
More problematically, the waste products must either be disposed of in the islands, or shipped somewhere elseataprohibitivecost.
Asthehumanpopulationgrowsexponentially,theIslandsareconfrontedwiththeproblem of what to do with all the waste.

Example: Water,Water,Everywhere!
Bottled water consumption worldwide has grown, and continues to grow at a phenomenal rate.
According to the Earth Policy Institute, 154 billion gallons were produced in 2004.
While there are places in the world where safe water supplies are unavailable, most of the growth in consumption has been due to other reasons.
The largest consumer of bottled water is the United States, which arguably could be the country with the best access to safe, convenient, and reliable sources of tap water.

Oftenthismeans you have to extend the horizontal axis beyond the value of the last data point.
In this example, if we had stopped the graph at 8, we would have missed that data, because the 8’s actually appear in the bin between 8 and 9.
Very often, when you see histograms in newspapers, magazines, or online, they may instead label the midpoint of each bin.

Forexample, thereis onlyonedata valuein the ﬁrst bin.
This represents 1 , or approximately 3%, of the total data.
Thus, the vertical bar for the bin extends 32 upwardto3%.
FrequencyPolygons A frequency polygon is similar to a histogram, but instead of using bins, a polygon is created by plotting the frequenciesandconnectingthosepointswithaseriesoflinesegments.
To create a frequency polygon for the bottle data, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the midpoints of each classiﬁcation, plot a point at thefrequencyforeachbinatthemidpoint,andthenconnectthepointswithlinesegments.

Introduction In this section, we will continue to investigate the different types of graphs that can be used to interpret a data set.
In addition to a few more ways to represent single numerical variables, we will also study methods for displaying categorical variables.
You will also be introduced to using a scatterplot and a line graph to show the relationship betweentwovariables.
CategoricalVariables: BarGraphsandPieGraphs Example: E-WasteandBarGraphs We live in an age of unprecedented access to increasingly sophisticated and affordable personal technology.

The type of electronic equipment is a categorical variable, and therefore, this data can easily be represented using thebargraphbelow: Whilethislooksverysimilartoahistogram,thebarsinabargraphusuallyareseparatedslightly.
Thegraphisjust aseriesofdisjointcategories.
Pleasenotethatdiscussionsofshape,center,andspreadhavenomeaningforabargraph,anditisnot,infact,even appropriate to refer to this graph as a distribution.
For example, some students misinterpret a graph like this by saying it is skewed right.
If we rearranged the categories in a different order, the same data set could be made to lookskewedleft.
Donottrytoinferanyoftheseconceptsfromabargraph!
PieGraphs Usually, data that can be represented in a bar graph can also be shown using a pie graph (also commonly called a circle graph or pie chart).
In this representation, we convert the count into a percentage so we can show each category relative to the total.
Each percentage is then converted into a proportionate sector of the circle.
To make thisconversion,simplymultiplythepercentageby360,whichisthetotalnumberofdegreesinacircle.
Hereisatablewiththepercentagesandtheapproximateanglemeasureofeachsector: 492.2.

Afterchoosinganappropriatescaleontheaxes, each data point is plotted as a single dot.
Multiple points at the same value are stacked on top of each other using equalspacingtohelpconveytheshapeandcenter.

It is spread from 34% to 98%, and appears very roughly symmetric, perhaps even slightly skewed left.
Dot plots have the advantage of showing all the data points and giving a quick and easy snapshot of the shape, center, and spread.
Dotplots are not much help when thereis little repetition in the data.
They can also be verytedious if you arecreatingthembyhandwithlargedatasets,thoughcomputersoftwarecanmakequickandeasyworkofcreating dotplotsfromsuchdatasets.

Stem plots can be difﬁcult to create, depending on the numerical qualities and the spread of the data.
If the data values contain more than two digits, you will need to remove some of the information by rounding.
A data set that has large gaps between values can also make the stem plot hard to createandlessusefulwheninterpretingthedata.

CommonGraphsandDataPlots www.ck12.org We have already mentioned that the spread was larger in the glass distribution, and it is easy to see this in the comparison plot.
You can also see that the glass distribution is more symmetric and is centered lower (around the mid-50’s), which seems to indicate that overall, these countries manufacture a smaller percentage of glass from recycledmaterialthantheydopaper.

Next,wewill plot a point that shows each country’s rate of recycling for the two materials.
This series of disconnected points is referredtoasascatterplot.
Recall that one of the things you saw from the stem-and-leaf plot is that, in general, a country’s recycling rate for glass is lower than its paper recycling rate.
On the next graph, we have plotted a line that represents the paper and glassrecyclingratesbeingequal.

Hereistheboxplotforthisdata: The plot divides the data into quarters; about 25% of the data appears in each section.
You can also usually learn something about the shape of the distribution from the sections of the plot.
If each of the four sections of the plot isaboutthesamelength,thenthedatawillbesymmetric.
Inthisexample,thedifferentsectionsarenotexactlythe same length.
The left whisker is slightly longer than the right, and the right half of the box is slightly longer than the left.
We would most likely say that this distribution is moderately symmetric.
In other words, there is roughly thesameamountofdataineachsection.
Thedifferentlengthsofthesectionstellushowthedataarespreadineach section.
The numbers in the left whisker (lowest 25% of the data) are spread more widely than those in the right whisker.

VisualizationsofData ComparingMultipleBoxPlots Box-and-whiskerplotsareoftenusedtogetaquickandefﬁcientcomparisonofthegeneralfeaturesofmultipledata sets.
In the previous example, we looked at data for both Arizona and Colorado.
How do their reservoir capacities compare?
You will often see multiple box plots either stacked on top of each other, or drawn side-by-side for easy comparison.
Herearethetwoboxplots: The plots seem to be spread the same if we just look at the range, but with the box plots, we have an additional indicator of spread if we examine the length of the box (or interquartile range).
This tells us how the middle 50% of the data is spread, and Arizona’s data values appear to have a wider spread.
The center of the Colorado data (as evidencedbythelocationofthemedian)ishigher,whichwouldtendtoindicatethat,ingeneral,Arizona’scapacities are lower.
Recall that the median is a resistant measure of center, because it is not affected by outliers.
The mean isnotresistant, becauseitwillbepulledtowardoutlyingpoints.
Whenadatasetisskewedstronglyinaparticular direction,themeanwillbepulledinthedirectionoftheskewing,butthemedianwillnotbeaffected.
Forthisreason, themedianisamoreappropriatemeasureofcentertouseforstronglyskeweddata.
Even though we wouldn’t characterize either of these data sets as strongly skewed, this affect is still visible.

Let’s use a graphing calculator to investigate this plot.
Enter your data into a list as we have done before, and then choose a plot.
Under ’Type’, you will notice what looks like two different box and whisker plots.
For now choose thesecondone(eventhoughitappearsonthesecondline,youmustpresstherightarrowtoselecttheseplots).
Setting a window is not as important for a box plot, so we will use the calculator’s ability to automatically scale a windowtoourdatabypressing[ZOOM]andselecting’9:ZoomStat’.
While box plots give us a nice summary of the important features of a distribution, we lose the ability to identify individualpoints.

Similarly, calculations of the range, interquartile range, and standard deviation will also be increased by the same factor.
In other words, the center and the measures of spreadwillincreaseproportionally.
This should result in the graph maintaining the same shape, but being stretched out, or elongated.
Here are the side-by-sideboxplotsforbothdistributionsshowingtheeffectsofchangingunits.

VisualizationsofData Wecangeneralizetheeffectofmultiplyingalldatavaluesbyaconstant: Themeanandothermeasuresofcenter willalsobemultipliedbytheconstant.
Additionally,eventhoughitwasnotshownintheexample,themeasures ofspread,includingthestandarddeviation,willalsobemultipliedbytheconstant.
What if, instead, we add a constant value to every data value?
Then, the entire distribution is shifted to the right (increased) by the amount of the constant.
The mean, and other measures of center will be increased by the constant.
However, thestandard deviationwill notbeaffected atall becausethe distributionwas notstretched orcompressed; itwassimplymoved.
Example: ConsiderIQscoresthathaveameanof100andastandarddeviationof15.
Ifweweretoadd5points toeachIQscore,thenanoldscoreof100wouldnowhaveanewvalueof105.
Thus,thenewmeanIQscorewould now be 105.
An old score of 115 (one standard deviation above the mean) would now have a value of 120.
The new value of 120 is still one standard deviation above the mean, and the new standard deviation is (120 - 105) = 15, which is equal to the original standard deviation.
Thus, the standard deviation was unchanged.
Addition of a constantdoeschangethevalueofthemean,butitdoesn’taffectthevalueofthestandarddeviation.
LessonSummary The ﬁve-numbersummary is a useful collection of statistical measures consisting of the following in ascending order: minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, maximum.
A box-and-whiskerplot, or boxplot, is a graphicalrepresentationoftheﬁve-numbersummaryshowingaboxboundedbythelowerandupperquartilesand the median as a line in the box.
The whiskers are line segments extended from the quartiles to the minimum and maximum values.
Each whisker and section of the box contains approximately 25% of the data.
The width of the box is the interquartile range, or IQR, and shows the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
Box-and-whisker plots areeffectiveatgivinganoverallimpressionoftheshape,center,andspreadofadataset.
Whileanoutlierissimply a point that is not typical of the rest of the data, there is an accepted deﬁnition of an outlier in the context of a box-and-whiskerplot.
Anypointthatismorethan1.5timesthelengthofthebox(IQR)fromeitherendofthebox isconsideredtobeanoutlier.
When we change the units of a distribution by multiplication, the center and spread will both be affected.
When wechangetheunitsofadistributionbyaddition,thecenterisaffected,butthespreadisnot.

Events,SampleSpaces,andProbability An event is something that occurs, or happens.
For example, ﬂipping a coin is an event, and so is walking in the parkandpassingbyabench.

Likewise,whilewalkingintheparkisanevent,ﬁndingyourfriendsittingonthebenchisanoutcomeofthat event.
Suppose a coin is tossed once.
There are two possible outcomes, either heads, H, or tails, T. Notice that if the experiment is conducted only once, you will observe only one of the two possible outcomes.
An experiment is the process of taking ameasurement or making an observation.
These individual outcomes for anexperiment are each calledsimpleevents.
Example: Adiehassixpossibleoutcomes: 1,2,3,4,5,or6.
Whenwetossitonce,onlyoneofthesixoutcomesof thisexperimentwilloccur.
Theonethatdoesoccuriscalledasimpleevent.
Example: Suppose that two pennies are tossed simultaneously.
We could have both pennies land heads up (which we write as HH), or the ﬁrst penny could land heads up and the second one tails up (which we write as HT), etc.
We will see that there are four possible outcomes for each toss, which are HH,HT,TH, and TT.

Oncethisisdone,theprobabilityoftheevent,P(A), iscalculatedusingtherelationshipP(A)=1−P(A(cid:48)).
Example: Suppose you know that the probability of getting the ﬂu this winter is 0.43.
What is the probability that youwillnotgettheﬂu?
Let the event A be getting the ﬂu this winter.
We are given P(A)=0.43.
The event not getting the ﬂu is A(cid:48).
Thus, P(A(cid:48))=1−P(A)=1−0.43=0.57.
Example: Twocoinsaretossedsimultaneously.

To calculate the probability, it’s necessary to keep in mind that each time we toss the coin, the chance is the same for heads as it is for tails.
Therefore, we can say that each simple event among the 1024 possible events is equally likelytooccur.
Thus,theprobabilityofanyoneoftheseeventsis 1 .

TheComplementofanEvent www.ck12.org We are being asked to calculate the probability that we will observe at least one head.

ConditionalProbability www.ck12.org 3.4 Conditional Probability LearningObjective • CalculatetheconditionalprobabilitythateventAoccurs,giventhateventBhasoccurred,usingtheconditional probabilityformulaandthenaturalfrequenciesapproach.
Introduction In this lesson, you will learn about the concept of conditional probability and be presented with some examples of how conditional probability is used in the real world.
You will also learn the appropriate notation associated with conditionalprobability.
Notation Weknowthattheprobabilityofobservinganevennumberonathrowofadieis0.5.

Now suppose that we throw the die, and we know that the result is a number that is 3 or less.

Wouldtheprobabilityofobservinganevennumberonthatparticularthrowstillbe0.5?
The answerisno,becausewiththeintroductionofeventB,wehavereducedoursamplespacefrom6simpleeventsto3 simpleevents.
Inotherwords,sincewehaveanumberthatis3orless,wenowknowthatwehavea1,2or3.
This becomes,ineffect,oursamplespace.
Nowtheprobabilityofobservinga2is 1.
Withtheintroductionofaparticular 3 condition (event B), we have changed the probability of a particular outcome.
The Venn diagram below shows the reducedsamplespaceforthisexperiment,giventhateventBhasoccurred: The only even number in the sample space for B is the number 2.
We conclude that the probability that A occurs, given that B has occurred, is 1:3, or 1.
We write this with the notation P(A|B), which reads “the probability of A, 3 givenB.”Soforthedietossexperiment,wewouldwriteP(A|B)= 1.
3 ConditionalProbabilityofTwoEvents If A and B are two events, then the probability of event A occurring, given that event B has occurred, is called conditionalprobability.
WewriteitwiththenotationP(A|B),whichreads“theprobabilityofA,givenB.” 94www.ck12.org Chapter3.

Thatis: P(A)=P(AC)+P(AC(cid:48))=0.10+0.30=0.4 This tells us that according to this study, the probability of ﬁnding a smoker selected at random from the sample space(thecity)is40%.
Wecancontinueonwithourcalculationsasfollows: P(A∩C) P(AC) 0.10 P(C|A)= = = =0.25=25% P(A) P(A) 0.40 Similarly,wecancalculatetheconditionalprobabilityofanonsmokerdevelopingcancer: P(A(cid:48)∩C) P(A(cid:48)C) 0.05 P(C|A(cid:48))= = = =0.08=8% P(A(cid:48)) P(A(cid:48)) 0.60 Inthiscalculation,P(A(cid:48))=P(A(cid:48)C)+P(A(cid:48)C(cid:48))=0.05+0.55=0.60.
P(A(cid:48))canalsobefoundbyusingtheComple- mentRuleasshown: P(A(cid:48))=1−P(A)=1−0.40=0.60.
Fromthesecalculations, wecanclearlyseethatarelationshipexistsbetweensmokingandcancer.

TheNaturalFrequenciesApproach Here is an alternate way of conceptualizing the problem above, called the natural frequencies approach, and it doesn’trequiretheuseofaconfusingformula.
Wewillusetheprobabilityinformationgivenabovetodemonstrate this approach.
Suppose you have 1000 people.
Of these 1000 people, 100 smoke and have cancer, and 300 smoke anddon’thavecancer.
Therefore,ofthe400peoplewhosmoke,100havecancer.
Theprobabilityofhavingcancer, giventhatyousmoke,is 100 =0.25.
400 Ofthese1000people,50don’tsmokeandhavecancer,and550don’tsmokeanddon’thavecancer.
Thus,ofthe600 people who don’t smoke, 50 have cancer.
Therefore, the probability of having cancer, given that you don’t smoke, is 50 =0.08.

AnIntroductiontoProbability AdditionRuleofProbability Theprobabilityoftheunionoftwoeventscanbeobtainedbyaddingtheindividualprobabilitiesandsubtractingthe probabilityoftheirintersection: P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B).
We can rephrase the deﬁnition as follows: The probability that either event A or event B occurs is equal to the probabilitythateventAoccursplustheprobabilitythateventBoccursminustheprobabilitythatbothoccur.
Example: Consider the experiment of randomly selecting a card from a deck of 52 playing cards.
What is the probabilitythatthecardselectediseitheraspadeorafacecard?
Oureventisdeﬁnedasfollows: E :cardselectediseitheraspadeorafacecard There are 13 spades and 12 face cards, and of the 12 face cards, 3 are spades.
Therefore, the number of cards that are either a spade or a face card or both is 13+9=22.
That is, event E occurs when 1 of 22 cards is selected, the 22cardsbeingthe13spadecardsandthe9facecardsthatarenotspade.
ToﬁndP(E),weusetheAdditionRuleof Probability.
First,deﬁnetwoeventsasfollows: C:cardselectedisaspade D:cardselectedisafacecard NotethatP(E)=P(C∪D)=P(C)+P(D)−P(C∩D).
Remember,witheventC,1of13cardsthatarespadescan be selected, and with event D, 1 of 12 face cards can be selected.
EventC∩D occurs when 1 of the 3 face card spades is selected.
These cards are the king, jack, and queen of spades.
Using the Addition Rule of Probability formula: P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B) 13 12 3 = + − 52 52 52 =0.250+0.231−0.058 =0.423 =42.3% Recall that we are subtracting 0.058 because we do not want to double-count the cards that are at the same time spadesandfacecards.
Example: If you know that 84.2% of the people arrested in the mid 1990’s were males, 18.3% of those arrested wereundertheageof18, and14.1%weremalesundertheageof18, whatistheprobabilitythatapersonselected atrandomfromallthosearrestediseithermaleorundertheageof18?

If A∩B is empty (A∩B = ∅), or, in other words, if there is not overlap between the two sets, we say that A and B are mutually exclusive.

LessonSummary TheAdditionRuleofProbability states that the union of two events can be found by adding the probabilities of eacheventandsubtractingtheintersectionofthetwoevents,orP(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B).
If A∩B contains no simple events, then A and B are mutually exclusive.

Calculate different ways of ordering and combining items, using multiplication, combinations, and permuta- tions.
Introduction Inferential Statistics is a method of statistics that consists of drawing conclusions about a population based on informationobtainedfromsamples.
Samplesareusedbecauseitcanbequitecostlyintimeandmoneytostudyan entirepopulation.
Inaddition,becauseoftheinabilitytoactuallyreacheveryoneinacensus,asamplecanbemore accuratethanacensus.
The most important characteristic of any sample is that it must be a very good representation of the population.
It wouldnotmakesensetousetheaverageheightofbasketballplayerstomakeaninferenceabouttheaverageheight oftheentireUSpopulation.
Likewise,itwouldnotbereasonabletoestimatetheaverageincomeoftheentirestate ofCaliforniabysamplingtheaverageincomeofthewealthyresidentsofBeverlyHills.
Thegoalofsamplingisto obtain a representative sample.
There are a number of different methods for taking representative samples, and in this lesson, you be presented with the various counting rules used to assist researchers in choosing a good sample andincalculatingprobabilities.
TheMultiplicativeRuleofCounting TheMultiplicativeRuleofCountingstatesthefollowing: (I) If there are n possible outcomes for event A and m possible outcomes for event B, then there are a total of nm possibleoutcomesforeventAfollowedbyeventB.
This rule says that you simply multiply the number of items in each category to get the total possible number of possibleoutcomes.
Example: A restaurant offers a special dinner menu every day.
There are three entrées, ﬁve appetizers, and four dessertstochoosefrom.
Acustomercanonlyselectoneitemfromeachcategory.
Howmanydifferentmealscanbe orderedfromthespecialdinnermenu?
Let’ssummarizewhatwehave.
Entrees: 3 Appetizer: 5 Dessert: 4 We use the Multiplicative Rule of Counting to calculate the number of different dinners that can be selected.
We simply multiply each of the numbers of choices per item together: (3)(5)(4) = 60.
Thus, there are 60 different dinnersthatcanbeorderedbythecustomers.

Weﬁrstdrawatreediagramtoaidusinseeingallthepossibleoutcomesofthisexperiment.
The tree diagram shows us the two stages of drawing two balls without putting the ﬁrst one back into the box.
In the ﬁrst stage, we pick a ball blindly.
Since there are 2 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 1 yellow ball, the probability of gettingaredballis 2,theprobabilityofgettingablueballis 3,andtheprobabilityofgettingayellowballis 1.
6 6 6 Rememberthattheprobabilityassociatedwiththesecondballdependsonthecoloroftheﬁrstball.
Therefore, the two stages are not independent.
To calculate the probabilities when selecting the second ball, we can look back at thetreediagram.

We then go to the second branch, choosing a red ball on the second draw, the probability of which is 1.
Therefo6re, the probability of choosing RR is (cid:0)2(cid:1)(cid:0)1(cid:1).
The method used to solve the example above can be 5 6 5 generalizedtoanynumberofstages.

Example: Inhowmanydifferentwayscanyouseat8peopleatadinnertable?
For the ﬁrst person, there are eight seat choices.
For the second, there are seven remaining choices, since one person has already been seated.
For the third seat, there are 6 choices, since two people are already seated.
By the time we get to the last person, there is only one seat left.
Therefore, using the Multiplicative Rule above, we get (8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)=40,320.
The multiplication pattern above appears so often in statistics that it has its own name, which is factorial, and its ownsymbol,whichis’!’.
Whendescribingit,wesay,“Eightfactorial,”andwewrite,"8!."
FactorialNotation n!=n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3).....(3)(2)(1) The arrangement of elements in a distinct order, as the example above shows, is called a permutation.

40,320 = 6 =6,720 Another way of solving this problem is to use the Multiplicative Rule of Counting.
Since there are only 5 seats available for 8 people, for the ﬁrst seat, there are 8 people available.
For the second seat, there are 7 remaining peopleavailable,sinceonepersonhasalreadybeenseated.
Forthethirdseat,thereare6peopleavailable,sincetwo people have already been seated.

DiscreteProbabilityDistributions 4.1 Two Types of Random Variables LearningObjective • Learntodistinguishbetweenthetwotypesofrandomvariables: continuousanddiscrete.
Introduction The word discrete means countable.
For example, the number of students in a class is countable, or discrete.
The value could be 2, 24, 34, or 135 students, but it cannot be 232 or 12.23 students.
The cost of a loaf of bread is also 2 discrete; itcouldbe$3.17, forexample, wherewearecountingdollarsandcents, butitcannotincludefractionsof acent.

Theairpressurecantakevaluesfrom0psitosomelargeamountthatwouldcausethetiretoburst.
Another example is the height of your fellow students in your classroom.
The values could be anywhere from, say, 4.5 feet to7.2feet.
Ingeneral,quantitiessuchaspressure,height,mass,weight,density,volume,temperature,anddistance are examples of continuous random variables.
Discrete random variables would usually come from counting, say, the number of chickens in a coop, the number of passing scores on an exam, or the number of voters who showed uptothepolls.
Betweenanytwovaluesofacontinuousrandomvariable,thereareaninﬁnitenumberofothervalidvalues.
Thisis not the case for discrete random variables, because between any two discrete values, there is an integer number (0, 1,2,...) ofvalidvalues.
Discreterandomvariablesareconsideredcountablevalues,sinceyoucouldcountawhole number of them.
In this chapter, we will only describe and discuss discrete random variables and the aspects that makethemimportantforthestudyofstatistics.

IfweletX representaquantitativevariablethatcanbemeasuredorobserved, thenwewillbeinterestedinﬁnding the numerical value of this quantitative variable.
A random variable is a function that maps the elements of the samplespacetoasetofnumbers.
Example: Three voters are asked whether they are in favor of building a charter school in a certain district.
Each voter’sresponseisrecordedas’Yes(Y)’or’No(N)’.Whataretherandomvariablesthatcouldbeofinterestinthis experiment?
Asyoumaynotice,thesimpleeventsinthisexperimentarenotnumericalinnature,sinceeachoutcomeiseithera ’Yes’ or a ’No’.
However, one random variable of interest is the number of voters who are in favor of building the school.

Inthelightofthisexample,whatdowemeanbyrandomvariable?
Theadjective’random’meansthattheexperiment may result in one of several possible values of the variable.
For example, if the experiment is to count the number of customers who use the drive-up window in a fast-food restaurant between the hours of 8 AM and 11 AM, the random variable here is the number of customers who drive up within this time interval.
This number varies from day to day, depending on random phenomena, such as today’s weather, among other things.
Thus, we say that the possiblevaluesofthisrandomvariablerangefrom0tothemaximumnumberthattherestaurantcanhandle.
There are two types of random variables−discrete and continuous.
Random variables that can assume only a countable number of values are called discrete.
Random variables that can take on any of the countless number ofvaluesinanintervalarecalledcontinuous.

DiscreteProbabilityDistributions 4.3 Mean and Standard Deviation of Discrete Random Variables LearningObjectives • Knowthedeﬁnitionofthemean,orexpectedvalue,ofadiscreterandomvariable.
• Calculatethemean,standarddeviation,andvarianceofadiscreterandomvariable.
Introduction In this lesson, you will be presented with the formulas for the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a discrete randomvariable.
Youwill alsobeshownmany real-worldexamplesofhow tousetheseformulas.
In addition, the meaningofexpectedvaluewillbediscussed.
CharacteristicsofaProbabilityDistribution The most important characteristics of any probability distribution are the mean (or average value) and the standard deviation (a measure of how spread out the values are).
The example below illustrates how to calculate the mean andthestandarddeviationofarandomvariable.
Acommonsymbolforthemeanisµ(mu),thelowercasemofthe Greekalphabet.
Acommonsymbolforstandarddeviationisσ(sigma),theGreeklowercases.
Example: Recalltheprobabilitydistributionofthe2-coinexperiment.
Calculatethemeanofthisdistribution.
If we look at the graph of the 2-coin toss experiment (shown below), we can easily reason that the mean value is locatedrightinthemiddleofthegraph,namely,atx=1.
Thisisintuitivelytrue.
Hereishowwecancalculateit: To calculate the population mean, multiply each possible outcome of the random variable X by its associated probabilityandthensumoverallpossiblevaluesofX: (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19) 1 1 1 1 1 µ=(0) +(1) +(2) =0+ + =1 4 2 4 2 2 1254.3.

Example: An insurance company sells life insurance of $15,000 for a premium of $310 per year.
Actuarial tables show that the probability of death in the year following the purchase of this policy is 0.1%.
What is the expected gainforthistypeofpolicy?
There are two simple events here: either the customer will live this year or will die.
The probability of death, as givenbytheproblem,is0.001,andtheprobabilitythatthecustomerwillliveis1−0.001=0.999.
Thecompany’s expectedgainfromthispolicyintheyearafterthepurchaseistherandomvariable,whichcanhavethevaluesshown inthetablebelow.
TABLE 4.5: Gain,x SimpleEvent Probability $310 Live 0.999 −$14,690 Die 0.001 Figure: Analysisofthepossibleoutcomesofaninsurancepolicy.
Remember, if the customer lives, the company gains $310 as a proﬁt.
If the customer dies, the company "gains" $310−$15,000=−$14,690, or in other words, it loses $14,690.
Therefore, the expected proﬁt can be calculated asfollows: µ=E(x)=∑xp(x) µ=(310)(99.9%)+(310−15,000)(0.1%) =(310)(0.999)+(310−15,000)(0.001) =309.69−14.69=$295 µ=$295 This tells us that if the company were to sell a very large number of the 1-year $15,000 policies to many people, it wouldmake,onaverage,aproﬁtof$295persale.
Anotherapproachistocalculatetheexpectedpayout,nottheexpectedgain: 126www.ck12.org Chapter4.

TheVariance Thevarianceofadiscreterandomvariableisgivenbythefollowingformula: σ2=∑(x−µ)2P(x) TheStandardDeviation The square root of the variance, or, in other words, the square root of σ2, is the standard deviation of a discrete randomvariable: √ σ= σ2 Example: A university medical research center ﬁnds out that treatment of skin cancer by the use of chemotherapy has a success rate of 70%.

Introduction A probabilitydistribution is the setof values thata random variable cantake on.
At this time, there arethree ways thatyoucancreateprobabilitydistributionsfromdata.

Aprobabilitydistributioncanalsobeconstructed from the basic principles, assumptions, and rules of theoretical probability.
The examples in this lesson will lead youtoabetterunderstandingoftheserulesoftheoreticalprobability.
CreatingProbabilityDistributions Itisnotdifﬁculttocreateaprobabilitydistribution.
Considerthefollowingexample.
Example: Silicosis is a pulmonary (lung) disease often afﬂicting mine workers.
In a large study, assume that it is determined, of all silicosis sufferers, that 80% worked in mines.
We use the Complement Rule to determine that 20%ofsilicosissufferersdidnotworkinmines.
Suppose two silicosis patients are randomly selected from a large population with the disease.
We want to create theprobabilitydistributionofthepossiblecategorizationofthetwopatientsforthesourceofthedisease.
There are four possible outcomes for the two patients.
With ’Y’ representing “worked in the mines” and ’N’ representing“didnotworkinthemines”,theoutcomesinthesamplespaceareasfollows: (N,N) (neitherpatientworkedinthemines) (Y,N) (ﬁrstpatientworkedinthemines,secondpatientdidnot) (N,Y) (ﬁrstpatientdidnotworkinthemines,secondpatientdid) (Y,Y) (bothworkedinthemines) Asstatedpreviously,thepatientsforthissurveyhavebeenrandomlyselectedfromalargepopulation,andtherefore, theoutcomesareindependent.
TheprobabilityforeachoutcomecanbecalculatedbyusingtheMultiplicationRule forindependentoutcomes: P(nofor1st)•P(nofor2nd)=(0.2)(0.2)=0.04 P(yesfor1st)•P(nofor2nd)=(0.8)(0.2)=0.16 P(nofor1st)•P(yesfor2nd)=(0.2)(0.8)=0.16 P(yesfor1st)•P(yesfor2nd)=(0.8)(0.8)=0.64 Noticethatthesumofthe4probabilitiesis1,whichiswhatwewouldexpectforthesumofprobabilitiesinasample space.

We can now calculate the mean and the standard deviation of this probability distribution.
The mean is calculated usingtheformulaµ=∑(X)p(X).

SumsandDifferencesofIndependentRandomVariables www.ck12.org FIGURE4.3 Rule 1: To get the mean of a combined probability distribution, simply add the means of each of the individual probabilitydistributions.
Ifyoulookatthetableofindividualresults,youwillseethatthemeanoftheﬁrstcallcenterwas27,andthemean of the second call center was 38.
We add these two values and get 65 for the mean of the combined call center, whichisexactlywhatourenterprisingyoungemployeeobtained.
Rule 2: To get the variance of a combined probability distribution, simply add the variances of each of the individualprobabilitydistributions.
Again, look at the table of individual results, and you see that the variance of the ﬁrst call center was 16, and the variance of the second call center was 26.
We add these two values and get 42 as the combined variance.
This agreeswiththeemployee’scalculations.
Rule 3: To get the standard deviation of a combined probability distribution, DO NOT add the standard devia- tions!!!!
Instead,useRule2andaddthevariances.
Thentakethesquarerootofthesumofthevariances,and youwillgetthecombinedstandarddeviation.
We just saw that the combined variance is 42.
So, to get the standard deviation of the combined probability distribution, take the square root of 42, which is rounded to 6.5.
Again, this agrees with the calculations of the enterprisingyoungemployee.
The company executives are impressed with the young man’s initiative and hard work, but instead of giving him a promotion,theygivehimasmallbonus.
Theyjustifythisbytellinghimthat,whilehewascorrectinhiswork,he washighlyinefﬁcientbecausehecouldhavegottentheanswerstheyneededmuchmoreeasilyifhehadremembered the3rulesofcombiningprobabilitydistributions.
So did they decide to combine the call centers?
Yes, they did.
Their reasoning was this: For call center 1, they needed3employeestohandlethemeanof27callsperhour.
Forcallcenter2,theyneeded4employeestohandle themeanof38callsperhour.
Iftheycombinedthe2callcenters,withacombinedmeanof65callsperhour,they decided that they could have 6 employees (instead of 7), and that meant that customers might have to wait a little longerforassistance.

LessonSummary A chance process can be displayed as a probability distribution that describes all the possible outcomes, x.
You can also determine the probability of any set of possible outcomes.

Introduction Many experiments resultin responses for which thereare only two possible outcomes, such as either’yes’ or ’no’, ’pass’ or ’fail’, ’good’ or ’defective’, ’male’ or ’female’, etc.
A simple example is the toss of a coin.
Say, for example, that we toss the coin ﬁve times.
In each toss, we will observe either a head, H, or a tail, T. We might be interested in the probability distribution of X, the number of heads observed.
In this case, the possible values of X rangefrom0to5.
Itisscenarioslikethisthatwewillexamineinthislesson BinomialExperiments Example: Supposeweselect100studentsfromalargeuniversitycampusandaskthemwhethertheyareinfavorofa certainissuethatisbeingdebatedontheircampus.
Thestudentsaretoanswerwitheithera’yes’ora’no’.
Here,we areinterestedinX, thenumberofstudentswhofavortheissue(a’yes’).
Ifeachstudentisrandomlyselectedfrom the total population of the university, and the proportion of students who favor the issue is p, then the probability thatanyrandomlyselectedstudentfavorstheissueis p. Theprobabilityofaselectedstudentwhodoesnotfavorthe issue is 1−p.
Sampling 100 students in this way is equivalent to tossing a coin 100 times.
This experiment is an exampleofabinomialexperiment.

If youweretostandatthedoorofyourstatisticsclassandwatchthestudentscomingin,thinkabouthowthestudents would enter.
Usually, one or two students enter early, then more students come in, then a large group of students enter, and ﬁnally, the number of students entering decreases again, with one or two students barely making it on time,orperhapsevencominginlate!
Now consider this.
Have you ever popped popcorn in a microwave?
Think about what happens in terms of the rate at which the kernels pop.
For the ﬁrst few minutes, nothing happens, and then, after a while, a few kernels start popping.
This rate increases to the point at which you hear most of the kernels popping, and then it gradually decreasesagainuntiljustakernelortwopops.
Here’ssomethingelsetothinkabout.
Trymeasuringtheheight,shoesize,orthewidthofthehandsofthestudentsin yourclass.
Inmostsituations,youwillprobablyﬁndthatthereareacoupleofstudentswithverylowmeasurements andacouplewithveryhighmeasurements,withthemajorityofstudentscenteredonaparticularvalue.
All of these examples show a typical pattern that seems to be a part of many real-life phenomena.
In statistics, because this pattern is so pervasive, it seems to ﬁt to call it normal, or more formally, the normal distribution.
The normal distribution is an extremely important concept, because it occurs so often in the data we collect from the natural world, as well as in many of the more theoretical ideas that are the foundation of statistics.

Center Due to the exact symmetry of a normal curve, the center of a normal distribution, or a data set that approximates a normal distribution, is located at the highest point of the distribution, and all the statistical measures of center we havealreadystudied(themean,median,andmode)areequal.

Themostcommonway to measure the spread of a normal distribution is with the standard deviation, orthe typical distance away from the mean.
Because of the symmetry of a normal distribution, the standard deviation indicates how far away from the maximumpeakthedatawillbe.

To do so, ﬁrst press [Y=] , which is the upper left-most button on the TI-84.
To create a normal distribution, we will draw an idealized curve using something called a density function.
The command is called ’normalpdf(’, and it is found by pressing [2nd][DISTR][1].
Enter an X by pressing the calculator button with the symbols (X,T,θ,n) on it, to represent the random variable, followed by the mean and the standard deviation, all separated by commas.

NormalDistribution z-Scores A z-score is a measure of the number of standard deviations a particular data point is away from the mean.
For example,let’ssaythemeanscoreonatestforyourstatisticsclasswasan82,withastandarddeviationof7points.
If your score was an 89, it is exactly one standard deviation to the right of the mean; therefore, your z-score would be 1.
If, on the other hand, you scored a 75, your score would be exactly one standard deviation below the mean, and your z-score would be −1.
All values that are below the mean have negative z-scores, while all values that are abovethemeanhavepositivez-scores.
Az-scoreof−2wouldrepresentavaluethatisexactly2standarddeviations belowthemean,sointhiscase,thevaluewouldbe82−14=68.
Tocalculateaz-scoreforwhichthenumbersarenotsoobvious,youtakethedeviationanddivideitbythestandard deviation.
Deviation z= StandardDeviation You may recall that deviation is the mean value of the variable subtracted from the observed value, so in symbolic terms,thez-scorewouldbe: x−µ z= σ As previously stated, since σ is always positive, z will be positive when x is greater than µ and negative when x is less than µ.
A z-score of zero means that the term has the same value as the mean.
The value of z represents the numberofstandarddeviationsthegivenvalueofxisaboveorbelowthemean.
Example: Whatisthez-scoreforanAonthetestdescribedabove,whichhasameanscoreof82?
(Assumethatan Aisa93.)
Thez-scorecanbecalculatedasfollows: 1555.1.
TheStandardNormalProbabilityDistribution www.ck12.org x−µ z= σ 93−82 z= 7 11 z= ≈1.57 7 If we know that the test scores from the last example are distributed normally, then a z-score can tell us something about how our test score relates to the rest of the class.
From the Empirical Rule, we know that about 68% of the students would have scored between a z-score of −1 and 1, or between a 75 and an 89, on the test.
If 68% of the dataisbetweenthesetwovalues,thenthatleavestheremaining32%inthetailareas.

x−µ z= σ ∴z·σ=x−µ x=µ+z·σ x=70+(−1.5)(8) x=58 AssessingNormality The best way to determine if a data set approximates a normal distribution is to look at a visual representation.
Histogramsandboxplotscanbeusefulindicatorsofnormality,buttheyarenotalwaysdeﬁnitive.
Itisofteneasier totellifadatasetisnotnormalfromtheseplots.
156www.ck12.org Chapter5.
NormalDistribution If a data set is skewed right, it means that the right tail is signiﬁcantly longer than the left.
Similarly, skewed left means the left tail has more weight than the right.
A bimodal distribution, on the other hand, has two modes, or peaks.
For instance, with a histogram of the heights of American 30-year-old adults, you will see a bimodal distribution−onemodeformalesandonemodeforfemales.
Now that we know how to calculate z-scores, there is a plot we can use to determine if a distribution is normal.
If we calculate the z-scores for a data set and plot them against the actual values, we have what is called a normal probabilityplot,oranormalquantileplot.
Ifthedatasetisnormal,thenthisplotwillbeperfectlylinear.

1575.1.
TheStandardNormalProbabilityDistribution www.ck12.org The histogram is fairly symmetric and mound-shaped and appears to display the characteristics of a normal distri- bution.
When the z-scores are plotted against the data values, the normal probability plot appears strongly linear, indicatingthatthedatasetcloselyapproximatesanormaldistribution.

Hereisaplotofthepercentagesandthez-scores,orthenormalprobabilityplot: While not perfectly linear, this plot does have a strong linear pattern, and we would, therefore, conclude that the distributionisreasonablynormal.
One additional clue about the data’s normality might be gained from investigating the Empirical Rule.

Is it possible to predict the standard deviation of this distribution by estimating the x-coordinate of a point on the densitycurve?
Readontoﬁndout!
You may have noticed that the density curve changes shape at two points in each of our examples.
These are the points where the curve changes concavity.
Starting from the mean and heading outward to the left and right, the curve is concave down.
(It looks like a mountain, or ’n’ shape.)
After passing these points, the curve is concave up.
(It looks like a valley, or ’u’ shape.)
The points at which the curve changes from being concave up to being concavedownarecalledtheinﬂectionpoints.
Onanormaldensitycurve,theseinﬂectionpointsarealwaysexactly onestandarddeviationawayfromthemean.
164www.ck12.org Chapter5.
NormalDistribution In this example, the standard deviation is 3 units.
We can use this concept to estimate the standard deviation of a normallydistributeddataset.

z-Tables All normal distributions have the same basic shape, and therefore, rescaling and re-centering can be implemented to change any normal distributions to one with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
This conﬁguration is referred to as a standard normal distribution.
In a standard normal distribution, the variable along the horizontal axis is the z-score.
This score is another measure of the performance of an individual score in a population.
To review,thez-scoremeasureshowmanystandarddeviationsascoreisawayfromthemean.
Thez-scoreoftheterm x in a population distribution whose mean is µ and whose standard deviation is σ is given by: z= x−µ.
Since σ is σ alwayspositive,zwillbepositivewhenxisgreaterthanµandnegativewhenxislessthanµ.

Using a table, the probability of experiencing a value this low is approximately 0.5−0.4719=0.0281.
In other words, there is about a 3% chance that you would get a bag of candy with 55 or fewer pieces, so Endy should feel cheated.

LessonSummary A density curve is an idealized representation of a distribution in which the area under the curve is deﬁned as 1, or in terms of percentages, a probability of 100%.
A normal density curve is simply a density curve for a normal distribution.
Normal density curves have two inﬂection points, which are the points on the curve where it changes concavity.
Thesepointscorrespondtothepointsinthenormaldistributionthatareexactly1standarddeviationaway from the mean.
Applying the Empirical Rule tells us that the area under the normal density curve between these twopointsisapproximately0.68.
Thisismostcommonlythoughtofintermsofprobability(e.g.,theprobabilityof choosingavalueatrandomfromthisdistributionandhavingitbewithin1standarddeviationofthemeanis0.68).

A z-table most commonly gives the probabilities below given z-scores, or what are sometimes referred to as left-tail probabilities.
Probabilities above certain z-scores are complementary to those below, so all we have to do is subtract the table value from 1 to ﬁnd the probability above a certain z-score.
To calculate the probabilities between two z-scores, calculate the left tail probabilities for both z-scores and subtract the left-mostvaluefromtheright.

NormalDistributionswithRealData The foundation of performing experiments by collecting surveys and samples is most often based on the normal distribution,asyouwilllearningreaterdetailinlaterchapters.
Herearetwoexamplestogetyoustarted.
Example: The Information Centre of the National Health Service in Britain collects and publishes a great deal of information and statistics on health issues affecting the population.
One such comprehensive data set tracks information about the health of children1.
According to its statistics, in 2006, the mean height of 12-year-old boys was152.9cm, withastandarddeviationestimateofapproximately8.5cm.
(Thesearenottheexactﬁguresforthe 1795.3.

If12-year-oldCecilis158cm,approximatelywhatpercentageofall12-year-oldboysinBritainishetallerthan?
We ﬁrst must assume that the height of 12-year-old boys in Britain is normally distributed, and this seems like a reasonable assumption to make.
As always, draw a sketch and estimate a reasonable answer prior to calculating the percentage.
In this case, let’s use the calculator to sketch the distribution and the shading.
First decide on an appropriate window that includes about 3 standard deviations on either side of the mean.
In this case, 3 standard deviations is about 25.5 cm, so add and subtract this value to/from the mean to ﬁnd the horizontal extremes.
Then entertheappropriate’ShadeNorm(’commandasshown: From this data, we would estimate that Cecil is taller than about 73% of 12-year-old boys.

Using a graphing calculator, we can approximate the probability of a female marine iguana being less than 400 gramsasfollows: With a probability of approximately 0.045, or only about 5%, we could say it is rather unlikely that we would ﬁnd aniguanathissmall.
LessonSummary In order to ﬁnd the percentage of data in-between two values (or the probability of a randomly chosen value being between those values) in a normal distribution, we can use the ’normalcdf(’ command on the TI-83/84 calculator.
When you know the percentage or probability, use the ’invNorm(’ command to ﬁnd a z-score or value of the variable.
In order to use these tools in real situations, we need to know that the distribution of the variable in question is approximately normal.
When solving problems using normal probabilities, it helps to draw a sketch of thedistributionandshadetheappropriateregion.

Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhatdifferentresults.” These statements illustrate two different potential problems with opinion polls, surveys, observational studies, and experiments.
Inthischapter,wewillinvestigatetheseproblemsandmorebylookingatsamplingindetail.
Censusvs.
Sample A sample is a representative subset of a population.
If a statistician or other researcher wants to know some information about a population, the only way to be truly sure is to conduct a census.
In a census, every unit in the population being studied is measured or surveyed.
In opinion polls, like the New York Times poll mentioned above,resultsaregeneralizedfromasample.
Ifwereallywantedtoknowthetrueapprovalratingofthepresident, forexample,wewouldhavetoaskeverysingleAmericanadulthisorheropinion.

Even if it could be done in several months, by the time the results were published,itwouldbeveryprobablethatrecenteventshadchangedpeoples’opinionsandthattheresultswouldbe obsolete.
In addition, a census has the potential to be destructive to the population being studied.
For example, many manufacturing companies test their products for quality control.
A padlock manufacturer might use a machine to see how much force it can apply to the lock before it breaks.
If they did this with every lock, they would have nonelefttosell!

The U.S. Census is probably the largest and longest running census, since the Constitution mandates a complete countingofthepopulation.

1856.1.
SurveysandSampling www.ck12.org Taken every 10 years, a Census was conducted in 2010, and in a report by the Government Accountability Ofﬁce in 1994, was estimated to cost $11 billion.
This cost has recently increased as computer problems have forced the forms to be completed by hand3.
You can ﬁnd a great deal of information about the U.S. Census, as well as data frompastCensuses,ontheCensusBureau’swebsite: http://www.census.gov/.
Due to all of the difﬁculties associated with a census, sampling is much more practical.
However, it is important to understand that even the most carefully planned sample will be subject to random variation between the sample and the population.
Recall that these differences due to chance are called sampling error.
We can use the laws of probabilitytopredictthelevelofaccuracyinoursample.
Opinionpolls,liketheNewYorkTimespollmentionedin theintroduction,tendtorefertothisasmarginoferror.
ThesecondstatementquotedfromtheNewYorkTimesarticle mentionsanotherproblemwithsampling.
Thatis, itisoftendifﬁculttoobtainasamplethataccuratelyreﬂectsthe total population.
It is also possible to make mistakes in selecting the sample and collecting the information.
These problems result in a non-representative sample, or one in which our conclusions differ from what they would have beenifwehadbeenabletoconductacensus.
To help understand these ideas, consider the following theoretical example.
A coin is considered fair if the proba- bility, p,ofthecoinlandingonheadsisthesameastheprobabilityofitlandingontails(p=0.5).
Theprobability is deﬁned as the proportion of heads obtained if the coin were ﬂipped an inﬁnite number of times.
Since it is impractical, if not impossible, to ﬂip a coin an inﬁnite number of times, we might try looking at 10 samples, with each sample consisting of 10 ﬂips of the coin.
Theoretically, you would expect the coin to land on heads 50% of the time, but it is very possible that, due to chance alone, we would experience results that differ from this.
These differencesareduetosamplingerror.
Aswewillinvestigateindetailinlaterchapters,wecandecreasethesampling error by increasing the sample size (or the number of coin ﬂips in this case).
It is also possible that the results we obtain could differ from those expected if we were not careful about the way we ﬂipped the coin or allowed it to landondifferentsurfaces.
Thiswouldbeanexampleofanon-representativesample.

BiasinSamplesandSurveys The term most frequently applied to a non-representative sample is bias.
Bias has many potential sources.
It is important when selecting a sample or designing a survey that a statistician make every effort to eliminate potential sources of bias.
In this section, we will discuss some of the most common types of bias.
While these concepts are universal,thetermsusedtodeﬁnethemheremaybedifferentthanthoseusedinothersources.
SamplingBias In general, sampling bias refers to the methods used in selecting the sample.
The sampling frame is the term we usetorefertothegrouporlistingfromwhichthesampleistobechosen.

Thislistwouldbethesamplingframe.
IncorrectSamplingFrame If the list from which you choose your sample does not accurately reﬂect the characteristics of the population, this is called incorrect sampling frame.
A sampling frame error occurs when some group from the population does not have the opportunity to be represented in the sample.
For example, surveys are often done over the telephone.
You could use the telephone book as a sampling frame by choosing numbers from the telephone book.
However, in addition to the many other potential problems with telephone polls, some phone numbers are not listed in the telephonebook.
Also,ifyourpopulationincludesalladults,itispossiblethatyouareleavingoutimportantgroups of that population.
For example, many younger adults in particular tend to only use their cell phones or computer- basedphoneservicesandmaynotevenhavetraditionalphoneservice.
Evenifyoupickedphonenumbersrandomly, the sampling frame could be incorrect, because there are also people, especially those who may be economically disadvantaged, who have no phone.
There is absolutely no chance for these individuals to be represented in your sample.
Atermoftenusedtodescribetheproblemswhenagroupofthepopulationisnotrepresentedinasurveyis undercoverage.
Undercoveragecanresultfromallofthedifferentsamplingbiases.
One of the most famous examples of sampling frame error occurred during the 1936 U.S. presidential election.
The Literary Digest, a popular magazine at the time, conducted a poll and predicted that Alf Landon would win the election that, as it turned out, was won in a landslide by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The magazine obtained a hugesampleoftenmillionpeople, andfromthatpool, 2millionreplied.
Withthesenumbers, youwouldtypically expectveryaccurateresults.
However,themagazineusedtheirsubscriptionlistastheirsamplingframe.
Duringthe depression, these individuals would have been only the wealthiest Americans, who tended to vote Republican, and leftthemajorityoftypicalvotersunder-covered.
ConvenienceSampling Suppose your statistics teacher gave you an assignment to perform a survey of 20 individuals.
You would most likelytendtoaskyourfriendsandfamilytoparticipate,becauseitwouldbeeasyandquick.
Thisisanexampleof convenience sampling, or convenience bias.
While it is not always true, your friends are usually people who share common values, interests, and opinions.
This could cause those opinions to be over-represented in relation to the true population.
Also, have you ever been approached by someone conducting a survey on the street or in a mall?
If such a person were just to ask the ﬁrst 20 people they found, there is the potential that large groups representing variousopinionswouldnotbeincluded,resultinginundercoverage.
JudgmentSampling Judgmentsamplingoccurswhenanindividualororganizationthatisusuallyconsideredanexpertintheﬁeldbeing studiedchoosestheindividualsorgroupofindividualstobeusedinthesample.
Becauseitisbasedonasubjective choice, even by someone considered an expert, it is very susceptible to bias.
In some sense, this is what those responsible for the Literary Digest poll did.
They incorrectly chose groups they believed would represent the population.
If a person wants to do a survey on middle-class Americans, how would this person decide who to include?
Itwouldbelefttothisperson’sownjudgmenttocreatethecriteriaforthoseconsideredmiddle-class.

Ifwechoseastateatrandomfromamapbyclosingoureyesandpointingtoaparticular place, larger states would have a greater chance of being chosen than smaller ones.
As another example, suppose that we wanted to do a survey to ﬁnd out the typical size of a student’s math class at a school.
The chances are greater that we would choose someone from a larger class for our survey.
To understand this, say that you went to a very small school where there are only four math classes, with one class having 35 students, and the other three classes having only 8 students.
If you simply choose students at random, it is more likely you will select students foryoursamplewhowillsaythetypicalsizeofamathclassis35,sincetherearemorestudentsinthelargerclass.

ResponseBias Thetermresponsebiasreferstoproblemsthatresultfromthewaysinwhichthesurveyorpollisactuallypresented totheindividualsinthesample.
VoluntaryResponseBias Television and radio stations often ask viewers/listeners to call in with opinions about a particular issue they are covering.
The websites for these and other organizations also usually include some sort of online poll question of the day.
Reality television shows and fan balloting in professional sports to choose all-star players make use of these types of polls as well.
All of these polls usually come with a disclaimer stating that, “This is not a scientiﬁc poll.” While perhaps entertaining, these types of polls are very susceptible to voluntary response bias.
The people who respond to these types of surveys tend to feel very strongly one way or another about the issue in question, and the results might not reﬂect the overall population.
Those who still have an opinion, but may not feel quite so passionately about the issue, may not be motivated to respond to the poll.
This is especially true for phone-in or mail-in surveys in which there is a cost to participate.
The effort or cost required tends to weed out much of the population in favor of those who hold extremely polarized views.
A news channel might show a report about a child killed in a drive-by shooting and then ask for people to call in and answer a question about tougher criminal sentencing laws.
They would most likely receive responses from people who were very moved by the emotional nature of the story and wanted anything to be done to improve the situation.
An even bigger problem is present in thosetypesofpollsinwhichthereisnocontroloverhowmanytimesanindividualmayrespond.

PlanningandConductinganExperimentorStudy QuestionnaireBias Questionnaire bias occurs when the way in which the question is asked inﬂuences the response given by the individual.
It is possible to ask the same question in two different ways that would lead individuals with the same basicopinionstoresponddifferently.
Considerthefollowingtwoquestionsaboutguncontrol.
"Do you believe that it is reasonable for the government to impose some limits on purchases of certain types of weaponsinanefforttoreducegunviolenceinurbanareas?"
"Do you believe that it is reasonable for the government to infringe on an individual’s constitutional right to bear arms?"
A gun rights activist might feel very strongly that the government should never be in the position of limiting guns in any way and would answer no to both questions.
Someone who is very strongly against gun ownership would similarly answer no to both questions.
However, individuals with a more tempered, middle position on the issue mightbelieveinanindividual’srighttoownagunundersomecircumstances,whilestillfeelingthatthereisaneed forregulation.

IncorrectResponseBias Amajorproblemwithsurveysisthatyoucanneverbesurethatthepersonisactuallyrespondingtruthfully.
Whenan individual intentionally responds to a survey with an untruthful answer, this is called incorrect response bias.
This can occur when asking questions about extremely sensitive or personal issues.
For example, a survey conducted about illegal drinking among teens might be prone to this type of bias.

Another example is related to the donation of blood.
Because the dangers of donated blood being tainted with diseases carrying a negative social stereotype increased in the 1990’s, the Red Cross has recently had to deal with incorrect response bias on a constant and especially urgent basis.

SurveysandSampling www.ck12.org ReducingBiasbyUsingAppropriateSamplingTechniques SimpleRandomSample(SRS) The best technique for reducing bias in sampling is randomization.
When a simple random sample of size n (commonly referred to as an SRS) is taken from a population, all possible samples of size n in the population have an equal probability of being selected for the sample.
For example, if your statistics teacher wants to choose a student at random for a special prize, he or she could simply place the names of all the students in the class in a hat,mixthemup,andchooseone.
Morescientiﬁcally,yourteachercouldassigneachstudentintheclassanumber from1to25(assumingthereare25studentsintheclass)andthenuseacomputerorcalculatortogeneratearandom numbertochooseonestudent.

It is important that you understand that there is no such thing as true randomness, especially on a calculator or computer.
When you choose the ’rand’ function, the calculator has been programmed to return a ten digit decimal that,usingaverycomplicatedmathematicalformula,simulatesrandomness.
Eachdigit,intheory,isequallylikely to occur in any of the individual decimal places.
What this means in practice is that if you had the patience (and the time!)
to generate a million of these on your calculator and keep track of the frequencies in a table, you would ﬁnd there would be an approximately equal number of each digit.
However, two brand-new calculators will give the exact same sequences of random numbers!
This is because the function that simulates randomness has to start at some number, called a seed value.
All the calculators are programmed from the factory (or when the memory is reset) to use a seed value of zero.
If you want to be sure that your sequence of random digits is different from everyoneelse’s,youneedtoseedyourrandomnumberfunctionusinganumberdifferentfromtheirs.

Insystematicsampling,afterchoosingastartingpointatrandom,subjectsareselectedusingajumpnumber.
Ifyou have ever chosen teams or groups in gym class by counting off by threes or fours, you were engaged in systematic sampling.
The jump number is determined by dividing the population size by the desired sample size to insure that the sample combs through the entire population.
If we had a list of everyone in your class of 25 students in alphabetical order, and we wanted to choose 5 of them, we would choose every 5th student.
Let’s try choosing a startingpointatrandombygeneratingarandomnumberfrom1to25asshownbelow: In this case, we would start with student number 14 and then select every 5th student until we had 5 in all.
When we came to the end of thelist, we would continue the countat number 1.
Thus, ourchosen students would be: 14, 19, 24, 4, and 9.
It is important to note that this is not a simple random sample, as not every possible sample of 5 studentshasanequalchanceofbeingchosen.
Forexample,itisimpossibletohaveasampleconsistingofstudents 5,6,7,8,and9.
ClusterSampling Cluster sampling is when a naturally occurring group is selected at random, and then either all of that group, or randomly selected individuals from that group, are used for the sample.
If we select at random from out of that group,orclusterintosmallersubgroups,thisisreferredtoasmulti-stagesampling.

Very often, groups in a population that are similar may respond differently to a survey.
In order to help reﬂect the population, we stratify to insure that each opinion is represented in the sample.

PlanningandConductinganExperimentorStudy LessonSummary If you collect information from every unit in a population, it is called a census.
Because a census is so difﬁcult to do, we instead take a representative subset of the population, called a sample, to try and make conclusions about the entire population.
The downside to sampling is that we can never be completely sure that we have captured the truth about the entire population, due to random variation in our sample that is called sampling error.
The list of the population from which the sample is chosen is called the sampling frame.
Poor technique in surveying or choosingasamplecanalsoleadtoincorrectconclusionsaboutthepopulationthataregenerallyreferredtoasbias.
Selection bias refers to choosing a sample that results in a subgroup that is not representative of the population.

Introduction A recent study published by the Royal Society of Britain1 concluded that there is a relationship between the nutritional habits of mothers around the time of conception and the gender of their children.
The study found that women who ate more calories and had a higher intake of essential nutrients and vitamins were more likely to conceive sons.
As we learned in the ﬁrst chapter, this study provides useful evidence of an association between these two variables, but it is only an observational study.
It is possible that there is another variable that is actually responsible for the gender differences observed.
In order to be able to convincingly conclude that there is a cause andeffectrelationshipbetweenamother’sdietandthegenderofherchild,wemustperformacontrolledstatistical experiment.

A variable that is not included in a study but that may still have an effect on the other variables involved is called a lurkingvariable.

Example: It’s possible that in the study presented above, the mother’s exercise habits caused both her increased consumptionofcaloriesandherincreasedlikelihoodofhavingamalechild.
A slightly different type of additional variable is called a confounding variable.

Theeffectofaconfoundingvariable on the response variable cannot be separated from the effect of the explanatory variable.
They are both observed, butitcannotbedistinguishedwhichoneisactuallycausingthechangeintheresponsevariable.

Experiments: Treatments,Randomization,andReplication Therearethreeelementsthatareessentialtoanystatisticalexperimentthatcanearnthetitleofarandomizedclinical trial.
Theﬁrstisthatatreatment mustbeimposedonthesubjectsoftheexperiment.
IntheexampleoftheBritish study on gender, we would have to prescribe different diets to different women who were attempting to become pregnant,ratherthansimplyobservingorhavingthemrecordthedetailsoftheirdietsduringthistime,aswasdone for the study.
The next element is that the treatments imposed must be randomly assigned.
Random assignment helps to eliminate other confounding variables.
Just as randomization helps to create a representative sample in a survey, if we randomly assign treatments to the subjects, we can increase the likelihood that the treatment groups are equally representative of the population.
The other essential element of an experiment is replication.
The conditionsofawell-designedexperimentwillbeabletobereplicatedbyotherresearcherssothattheresultscanbe independentlyconﬁrmed.
To design an experiment similar to the British study, we would need to use valid sampling techniques to select a representative sample of women who were attempting to conceive.
(This might be difﬁcult to accomplish!)
The women might then be randomly assigned to one of three groups in which their diets would be strictly controlled.
Theﬁrstgroupwouldberequiredtoskipbreakfast,thesecondgroupwouldbeputonahigh-calorie,nutrition-rich diet, and the third group would be put on a low-calorie, low-nutrition diet.
This brings up some ethical concerns.

Control Let’ssaythatyourstatisticsteacherreadsomewherethatclassicalmusichasapositiveeffectonlearning.
Toimpose a treatment in this scenario, she decides to have students listen to an MP3 player very softly playing Mozart string quartets while they sleep for a week prior to administering a unit test.
To help minimize the possibility that some other unknown factor might inﬂuence student performance on the test, she randomly assigns the class into two groupsofstudents.
Onegroupwilllistentothemusic,andtheothergroupwillnot.
Whenthetreatmentofinterest is actually withheld from one of the treatment groups, it is usually referred to as the control group.
By randomly assigning subjects to these two groups, we can help improve the chances that each group is representative of the classasawhole.
PlacebosandBlindExperiments In medical studies, the treatment group usually receives some experimental medication or treatment that has the potential to offer a new cure or improvement for some medical condition.
This would mean that the control group would not receive the treatment or medication.
Many studies and experiments have shown that the expectations of participants can inﬂuence the outcomes.
This is especially true in clinical medication studies in which participants 196www.ck12.org Chapter6.
PlanningandConductinganExperimentorStudy who believe they are receiving a potentially promising new treatment tend to improve.
To help minimize these expectations, researchers usually will not tell participants in a medical study if they are receiving a new treatment.
In order to help isolate the effects of personal expectations, the control group is typically given a placebo.
The placebogroupwouldthinktheyarereceivingthenewmedication,buttheywould,infact,begivenmedicationwith no active ingredient in it.
Because neither group would know if they are receiving the treatment or the placebo, anychangethatmightresultfromtheexpectationoftreatment(thisiscalledtheplaceboeffect)shouldtheoretically occurequallyinbothgroups,providedtheyarerandomlyassigned.
Whenthesubjectsinanexperimentdonotknow whichtreatmenttheyarereceiving,itiscalledablindexperiment.
Example: If you wanted to do an experiment to see if people preferred a brand-name bottled water to a generic brand,youwouldmostlikelyneedtoconcealtheidentityofthetypeofwater.
Aparticipantmightexpectthebrand- name water to taste better than a generic brand, which would alter the results.
Also, sometimes the expectations or prejudices of the researchers conducting the study could affect their ability to objectively report the results, or couldcausethemtounknowinglygivecluestothesubjectsthatwouldaffecttheresults.
Toavoidthisproblem,itis possible to design the experiment so that the researcher also does not know which individuals have been given the treatmentorplacebo.
Thisiscalledadouble-blindexperiment.

Blocking Blocking in an experiment serves a purpose similar to that of stratiﬁcation in a survey.
For example, if we believe men and women might have different opinions about an issue, we must be sure those opinions are properly repre- sented in the sample.
The terminology comes from agriculture.
In testing different yields for different varieties of crops, researchers would need to plant crops in large ﬁelds, or blocks, that could contain variations in conditions, such as soil quality, sunlight exposure, and drainage.
It is even possible that a crop’s position within a block could affect its yield.
Similarly, if there is a sub-group in the population that might respond differently to an imposed treatment,ourresultscouldbeconfounded.

MatchedPairsDesign Amatchedpairsdesignisatypeofrandomizedblockdesigninwhichtherearetwotreatmentstoapply.
Example: Suppose you were interested in the effectiveness of two different types of running shoes.
You might search for volunteers among regular runners using the database of registered participants in a local distance run.
Afterpersonalinterviews,asampleof50runnerswhorunasimilardistanceandpace(averagespeed)onroadways onaregularbasiscouldbechosen.
Supposethatbecauseyoufeelthattheweightoftherunnerswilldirectlyaffect the life of the shoe, you decided to block on weight.
In a matched pairs design, you could list the weights of all 50 runners in order and then create 25 matched pairs by grouping the weights two at a time.
One runner would be randomly assigned shoe A, and the other would be given shoe B.
After a sufﬁcient length of time, the amount of wearontheshoescouldbecompared.
In the previous example, there may be some potential confounding inﬂuences.
Factors such as running style, foot shape, height, or gender may also cause shoes to wear out too quickly or more slowly.
It would be more effective to compare the wear of each shoe on each runner.
This is a special type of matched pairs design in which each experimental unit becomes its own matched pair.
Because the matched pair is in fact two different observations of the same subject, it is called a repeated measures design.
Each runner would use shoe A and shoe B for equal periods of time, and then the wear of the shoes for each individual would be compared.
Randomization could still beimportant,though.
Let’ssaythatwehaveeachrunneruseeachshoetypeforaperiodof3months.
Itispossible that the weather during those three months could inﬂuence the amount of wear on the shoe.
To minimize this, we couldrandomlyassignhalfthesubjectsshoeA,withtheotherhalfreceivingshoeB,andthenswitchaftertheﬁrst 3months.
LessonSummary The important elements of a statistical experiment are randomness, imposed treatments, and replication.
The use of these elements is the only effective method for establishing meaningful cause-and-effect relationships.
An experiment attempts to isolate, or control, other potential variables that may contribute to changes in the response variable.
If these other variables are known quantities but are difﬁcult, or impossible, to distinguish from the other explanatoryvariables,theyarecalledconfoundingvariables.
Ifthereisanadditionalexplanatoryvariableaffecting the response variable that was not considered in an experiment, it is called a lurking variable.
A treatment is the term used to refer to a condition imposed on the subjects in an experiment.
An experiment will have at least two treatments.
Whentryingtotesttheeffectivenessofaparticulartreatment, itisofteneffectivetowithholdapplying that treatment to a group of randomly chosen subjects.
This is called a control group.
If the subjects are aware of theconditionsoftheirtreatment,theymayhavepreconceivedexpectationsthatcouldaffecttheoutcome.
Especially inmedicalexperiments,thepsychologicaleffectofbelievingyouarereceivingapotentiallyeffectivetreatmentcan 198www.ck12.org Chapter6.
PlanningandConductinganExperimentorStudy lead to different results.
This phenomenon is called the placebo effect.
When the participants in a clinical trial are led to believe they are receiving the new treatment, when, in fact, they are not, they receive what is called a placebo.
If the participants are not aware of the treatment they are receiving, it is called a blind experiment, and when neither the participant nor the researcher is aware of which subjects are receiving the treatment and which subjectsarereceivingaplacebo,itiscalledadouble-blindexperiment.
Blockingisatechniqueusedtocontrolthepotentialconfoundingofvariables.
Itissimilartotheideaofstratiﬁcation in sampling.
In a randomized block design, the researcher creates blocks of subjects that exhibit similar traits that might cause different responses to the treatment and then randomly assigns the different treatments within each block.

Italsodiscusseshowsamplingdistributionsareusedininferentialstatistics.
Supposeyourandomlysampled10peoplefromthepopulationofwomeninHouston,Texas,betweentheagesof21 and 35 years and computed the mean height of your sample.
You would not expect your sample mean to be equal to the mean of all women in Houston.
It might be somewhat lower or it might be somewhat higher, but it would probablynotequalthepopulationmeanexactly.
Similarly,ifyoutookasecondsampleof10peoplefromthesame population,youwouldnotexpectthemeanofthissecondsampletoequalthemeanoftheﬁrstsample.
Recall that inferential statistics concerns generalizing from a sample to a population.
A critical part of inferential statistics involves determining how far sample statistics are likely to vary from each other and from the population parameter.
(In this example, the sample statistics are the sample means and the population parameter is the populationmean.)
DiscreteDistributions We will illustrate the concept of sampling distributions with a simple example.

Now we will consider sampling distributions when the population distribution is continuous.
What if we had a thousand pool balls with numbers ranging from 0.001to1.000inequalsteps?
(Althoughthisdistributionisnotreallycontinuous,itiscloseenoughtobeconsidered continuous for practical purposes.)

SamplingDistributionsandInferentialStatistics As we stated in the beginning of this chapter, sampling distributions are important for inferential statistics.
In the examples given so far, a population was speciﬁed and the sampling distribution of the mean was determined.
In practice, the process proceeds the other way: you collect sample data and from these data you estimate parameters ofthesamplingdistribution.
Thisknowledgeofthesamplingdistributioncanbeveryuseful.
Forexample,knowing 210www.ck12.org Chapter7.
SamplingDistributionsandEstimations thedegreetowhichmeansfromdifferentsampleswoulddifferfromeachotherandfromthepopulationmeanwould giveyouasenseofhowcloseyourparticularsamplemeanislikelytobetothepopulationmean.
Fortunately, this information is directly available from a sampling distribution.
The most common measure of how much sample means differ from each other is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean.
This standard deviationiscalledthestandarderrorofthemean.
Ifallthesamplemeanswereveryclosetothepopulationmean, then the standard error of the mean would be small.
On the other hand, if the sample means varied considerably, thenthestandarderrorofthemeanwouldbelarge.
To be speciﬁc, assume your sample mean were 125 and you estimated that the standard error of the mean were 5 (usingamethodshowninalatersection).
Ifyouhadanormaldistribution,thenitwouldbelikelythatyoursample mean would be within 10 units of the population mean since most of a normal distribution is within two standard deviationsofthemean.
LessonSummary Inthislesson,wehavelearnedaboutthesamplingdistributionofthemeanforbothdiscreteandcontinuousrandom variables.
When we study the distribution NOT of the individual data, but rather the distribution of the MEAN of all samples of a particular size, then we have a sampling distribution.
In the next section we will study how sample means and sample proportions are distributed when we learn the Central Limit Theorem.
We will learn how to calculate probabilities using the sampling distribution of the mean and the sampling distribution of the proportion.
Thenwewillbereadytoentertherealmofinferentialstatistics.

We used the pool balls to illustrate that when we take all possible samples of size 2 and calculate eachsamplemean,theshapeofthedistributionofthemeansisquitedifferentfromtheoriginaldistribution’sshape.
It is now time to deﬁne some properties of a sampling distribution of sample means and sample proportions and to examinewhatwecanconcludeabouttheentirepopulationbasedontheseproperties.
The sampling distribution of the mean was deﬁned in the section introducing sampling distributions.
This section reviewssomeimportantpropertiesofthesamplingdistributionofthemean.
Mean Themeanofthesamplingdistributionofthemeanisthemeanofthepopulationfromwhichthescoresweresampled.
Therefore,ifapopulationhasameanµ,thenthemeanofthesamplingdistributionofthemeanisalsoµ.
Thesymbol µx¯isusedtorefertothemeanofthesamplingdistributionofthemean.
Therefore,theformulaforthemeanofthe samplingdistributionofthemeancanbewrittenas: µ =µ.
Inwords,wearesayingthatthemeanofthesampling x¯ distributionistheoriginalpopulationmean.
Variance Thevarianceofthesamplingdistributionofthemeaniscomputedasfollows: That is, the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean is the population variance divided by n, the samplesize(thenumberofscoresusedtocomputeamean).
Thus,thelargerthesamplesize,thesmallerthe varianceofthesamplingdistributionofthemean.
The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean.
It is therefore thesquarerootofthevarianceofthesamplingdistributionofthemeanandcanbewrittenasσ = √σ .

212www.ck12.org Chapter7.
SamplingDistributionsandEstimations TheCentralLimitTheoremstatesthat: Given a population with mean µ and standard deviation σ, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normaldistribution with a mean of µ and a standard deviation of √σ , which is also called the standard n errorofthemean.
The expressions for the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean are not new or remarkable.
Whatisremarkableisthatregardlessoftheshapeoftheparentpopulation,thesamplingdistributionof themeanapproachesanormaldistributionasnincreases.

Before going any further, you should become familiar with (or reacquaint yourself with) the symbols that are commonly used when dealing with properties of the sampling distribution of sample means.
These symbols are showninthetablebelow: TABLE 7.3: PopulationParameter SampleStatistic SamplingDistribution Mean µ x¯ µ x¯ StandardDeviation σ s S orσ x¯ x¯ Size N n As the sample size, n, increases, the resulting sampling distribution would approach a normal distribution with the samemeanasthepopulationandwithσ = √σ .

TheCentralLimitTheoremstatesthefollowing: 214www.ck12.org Chapter7.
SamplingDistributionsandEstimations If samples of size n are drawn at random from any population with a ﬁnite mean and standard deviation, then the samplingdistributionofthesamplemeans,x¯,approximatesanormaldistributionasnincreases.
The mean of this sampling distribution approximates the population mean, and the standard deviation of this samplingdistributionapproximatesthestandarddeviationofthepopulationdividedbythesquarerootofthesample size: µ =µandσ = √σ .
x¯ x¯ n These properties of the sampling distribution of sample means can be applied to determining probabilities.
If the sample size is sufﬁciently large (> 30), the sampling distribution of sample means can be assumed to be approximatelynormal,eveniftheparentpopulationisnotnormallydistributed.
Example: Supposeyouwantedtoanswerthequestion,“Whatistheprobabilitythatarandomsampleof20families in Canada will have an average of 1.5 pets or fewer?” where the mean of the population is 0.8 and the standard deviationofthepopulationis1.2.
Forthesamplingdistribution,µ =µ=0.8andσ = √σ = √1.2 =0.268.
x¯ x¯ n 20 Usingtechnology,asketchofthisproblemisasfollows: Theshadedareashowstheprobabilitythatthesamplemeanislessthan1.5.
Thez-scoreforthevalue1.5isz= x¯−µx¯ = 1.5−0.8 ≈2.6.
σx¯ 0.27 As shown above, the area under the standard normal curve to the left of 1.5 (a z-score of 2.6) is approximately 0.9937.
Thisvaluecanalsobedeterminedbyusingagraphingcalculatorasfollows: Therefore,theprobabilitythatthesamplemeanwillbebelow1.5is0.9937.
Inotherwords,witharandomsample of20families,itisalmostdeﬁnitethattheaveragenumberofpetsperfamilywillbelessthan1.5.

SamplingDistributionsandEstimations SamplingDistributionoftheProportion pˆ Thus far, we have used examples and illustrations of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using sample means.
But wecanextendtheCLTtosampleproportionsaswell.
Hereisadiscussionandanexample: Assume that in an election race between Candidate A and Candidate B, 0.60 of the voters prefer Candidate A.
If a random sample of 10 voters were polled, it is unlikely that exactly 60% of them (6) would prefer Candidate A.
By chance the proportion in the sample preferring Candidate A could easily be a little lower than0.60oralittlehigherthan0.60.
Thesamplingdistributionof pˆisthedistributionthatwouldresultifyou repeatedlysampled10votersanddeterminedthesampleproportionforeachsampleof10voters thatfavored CandidateA.
The sampling distribution of pˆ is a special case of the sampling distribution of the mean.
Table 1 shows a hypothetical random sample of 10 voters.
Those who prefer Candidate A are given scores of 1 and those whopreferCandidateBaregivenscoresof0.
NotethatsevenofthevotersprefercandidateAsothesample proportion(pˆ)is pˆ=7/10=0.70 Asyoucansee, pˆisthemeanofthe10preferencescores.

TABLE 7.4: Voter Preference 1 1 2 0 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 0 7 1 8 0 9 1 10 1 The distribution of pˆ is closely related to the binomial distribution.
The binomial distribution is the distribution of thetotalnumberofsuccesses(favoringCandidateA,forexample)whereasthedistributionof pˆ isthedistribution of the proportion of successes.
The mean, of course, is the total divided by the sample size, n. Therefore, the samplingdistributionof pˆ andthebinomialdistributiondifferinthat pˆ isthemeanproportionofthescores(0.70) andthebinomialdistributionisdealingwiththetotalnumberofsuccesses(7).
Thebinomialdistributionhasameanof µ=np Dividing by n to adjust for the fact that the sampling distribution of pˆ is dealing with the mean proportion insteadoftotals,weﬁndthatthemeanofthesamplingdistributionof pˆis: Another way of saying this is that the mean of all the sample proportions (all of the pˆs) is the population proportionp.
(cid:112) Rememberthatthestandarddeviationofthebinomialdistributionis: σ= np(1−p) (cid:112) (cid:114) np(1−p) p(1−p) Dividingbynbecausepisameanandnotatotal,weﬁndthestandarderrorof pˆas = n n 2177.2.
TheCentralLimitTheorem www.ck12.org Returningtothevoterexample,p=0.60andn=10.
(Don’tconfusep=0.60,thepopulationproportionand pˆ = 0.70, the sample proportion.)
Therefore, the mean of the sampling distribution of pˆ is 0.60.
The standard erroris FIGURE7.6 The sampling distribution of pˆ is a discrete rather than a continuous distribution.
For example, with an n of 10,itispossibletohavea pˆof0.50ora pˆof0.60butnota pˆof0.55.
The sampling distribution of pˆ is approximately normally distributed if n is fairly large and p is not close to 0 or 1.
A rule of thumb is that the approximation is good if both np and n(1 - p) are greater than 10.

Example: Itisknownthatinaparticularschooldistrict,theproportionofparentsinfavorofcombiningtwoelementary schools into one school (to save money) is .43.
We draw a random sample of 100 parents.
What is the probability that the sample proportion of parents in this sample in favor of combining the 2 schools will be greaterthan.50?
Answer: We can use the normal distribution z table to answer this question.
We know that p = .43 and we want to knowtheprobabilitythatthesampleproportion pˆ willbegreaterthan.50.

Thus, when the population proportion is .43, the probability that our sample proportion will be .50 or greater(withasamplesizeof100)isabout.0793.

Introduction Theobjectiveofinferentialstatisticsistousesampledatatoincreaseknowledgeabouttheentirepopulation.
Inthis lesson, we will examine how to use samples to make estimates about the populations from which they came.
We willalsoseehowtodeterminehowwidetheseestimatesshouldbeandhowconﬁdentweshouldbeaboutthem.
Oneofthemajorapplicationsofstatisticsisestimatingpopulationparametersfromsamplestatistics.

Outofarandomsampleof200people, 106saytheysupporttheproposition.
Thusinthesample, 0.53of thepeoplesupportedtheproposition.
Thisvalueof0.53iscalledapointestimateofthepopulationproportion.
It iscalledapointestimatebecausetheestimateconsistsofasinglevalueorpoint.
Pointestimatesareusuallysupplementedbyintervalestimatescalledconﬁdenceintervals.
Conﬁdenceintervalsare intervals constructed using a method that contains the population parameter a speciﬁed proportion of the time.
For example,ifthepollsterusedamethodthatcontainstheparameter95%ofthetimeitisused,heorshewouldarrive atthefollowing95%conﬁdenceinterval: 0.46<p<0.60.
Thepollsterwouldthenconcludethatsomewherebetween 0.46 and 0.60 of the population supports the proposal.
The media usually reports this type of result by saying that 53%favorthepropositionwithamarginoferrorof7%.
Anotherwayofexpressingthisis53%±7%.
Sayyouwereinterestedinthemeanweightof10-year-oldgirlslivingintheUnitedStates.
Sinceitwouldhavebeen impracticaltoweighallthe10-year-oldgirlsintheUnitedStates,youtookasampleof16andfoundthatthemean weightwas90pounds.
Thissamplemeanof90isapointestimateofthepopulationmean.
Apointestimatebyitself is of limited usefulness because it does not reveal the uncertainty associated with the estimate; you do not have a goodsenseofhowfarthissamplemeanmaybefromthepopulationmean.
Forexample,canyoubeconﬁdentthat thepopulationmeaniswithin5poundsof90?
Yousimplydonotknow.
Conﬁdence intervals provide more information than point estimates.
Conﬁdence intervals for means are inter- valsconstructedusingaprocedurethatwillcontainthepopulationmeanaspeciﬁedproportionofthetime,typically either95%or99%ofthetime.
Theseintervalsarereferredtoas95%and99%conﬁdenceintervalsrespectively.
An exampleofa95%conﬁdenceintervalisshownbelow: 72.85<µ<107.15 Thereisgoodreasontobelievethatthepopulationmeanliesbetweenthesetwoboundsof72.85and107.15 since95%ofthetimeconﬁdenceintervalscontainthetruemean.
If repeated samples were taken and the 95% conﬁdence interval computed for each sample, 95% of the 220www.ck12.org Chapter7.
SamplingDistributionsandEstimations intervalswouldcontainthepopulationmean.
Naturally,5%oftheintervalswouldnotcontainthepopulation mean.
Itseemsreasonabletointerpreta95%conﬁdenceintervalasanintervalwitha0.95probabilityofcontaining thepopulationmean.
However,theproperinterpretationisnotthatsimple.
Let’sconsiderthe95%conﬁdence intervalcalculatedabove:72.85<µ<107.15.
Theappropriateinterpretationofthisintervalisthis: "Weare 95% conﬁdent that the true population mean is between 72.85 and 107.15."
We don’t use a probability statementwhenweinterpretconﬁdenceintervals.
Thetruevalueoftheparametereitherisorisnotcaptured intheinterval.
It is important to understand the term "conﬁdence level."
This is the percent that is stated in the conﬁdence interval.
A 95% conﬁdence interval uses a 95% conﬁdence level.
A 92% conﬁdence interval uses a 92% conﬁdencelevel.
Notethata95%conﬁdenceintervalisarangeofvaluesthat(wehope)containsthevalue ofthetruepopulationparameter,suchasµ,whereasaconﬁdencelevelisthevaluethatweuse(suchas95% or90%)fordeterminingtheamountofconﬁdenceabouttheintervalwehavejustcalculated.
Hereisashort interpretation of a 95% conﬁdence level: If we were to take many, many samples of a speciﬁed size, and we calculated a 95% conﬁdence interval for each one of those samples, then about 95% of the computed conﬁdenceintervalswouldcapturethetruevalueoftheparameter.
When you compute a conﬁdence interval, you compute the mean of a sample in order to estimate the mean ofthepopulation.
Clearly,ifyoualreadyknewthepopulationmean,therewouldbenoneedforaconﬁdence interval.
However,toexplainhowconﬁdenceintervalsareconstructed,wearegoingtoworkbackwardsand begin by assuming characteristics of the population.
Then we will show how sample data can be used to constructaconﬁdenceinterval.
CONFIDENCEINTERVALFORAPOPULATIONMEAN Assume that the weights of 10-year-old children are normally distributed with a mean of 90 and a standard deviationof36.
Whatisthesamplingdistributionofthemeanforasamplesizeof9?
Recallfromthesection on the sampling distribution of the mean that the mean of the sampling distribution is µ and the standard error of the mean is σ = √σ .
For the present example, the sampling distribution of the mean has a x n meanof90andastandarddeviationof36/3=12.
Notethatthestandarddeviationofasamplingdistribution is its standard error.
Figure 1 shows this distribution.
The shaded area represents the middle 95% of the distributionandstretchesfrom66.48to113.52.
Theselimitswerecomputedbyaddingandsubtracting1.96 standarderrorsto/fromthemeanof90asfollows: FIGURE7.9 The 95% conﬁdence intervalis: 66.48 ≤ µ ≤113.52 .
Based on our sample mean, we are 95% conﬁdent thatthetruepopulationmeanisbetween66.48and113.52.
The value of 1.96 is based on the fact that 95% of the area of a normal distribution is within 1.96 standard deviationsofthemean;12isthestandarderrorofthemean.

Themiddle95%ofthedistributionisshaded.
Figure 1 shows that 95% of the means are no more than 23.52 units (1.96 standard deviations) from the mean of 90.
Now consider the probability that a sample mean computed in a random sample is within 23.52 units of the populationmeanof90.
Since95%ofthedistributioniswithin23.52of90, theprobabilitythatthemeanfromany givensamplewillbewithin23.52of90is0.95.
Thismeansthatifwerepeatedlycomputethesamplemean(x¯)from asample,andcreateanintervalrangingfrom x¯-23.52 to x¯+23.52, thisintervalwillcontainthepopulationmean 95%ofthetime.

x If you look closely at this formula for a conﬁdence interval, you will notice that you need to know the population standard deviation (σ) in order to estimate the mean.
This may sound unrealistic, and it is.
However, computing a conﬁdence interval when σ is known is easier than when σ has to be estimated, and servesapedagogicalpurpose.
Laterwewillshowhowtocomputeaconﬁdenceintervalforthemeanwhenσ hastobeestimatedusings,thesamplestandarddeviation.
Suppose the following ﬁve numbers were sampled from a normal distribution with a known population standard deviation of 2.5: 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
To compute the 95% conﬁdence interval, start by computingthemeanandstandarderror: √ µ=(2+3+5+6+9)/5=5.
Thestandarderroris σ =2.5/ 5=1.118.

Construct a conﬁdence interval for this populationproportion.
Answer: Our sample proportion is 0.746, and our standard error of the proportion is 0.0251.
We will construct a 95% conﬁdence interval for the population proportion.

Introduction Inthischapter, wewillexplorehypothesistesting, whichinvolvesmakingconjecturesaboutapopulationbasedon a sample drawn from the population.
Hypothesis tests are often used in statistics to analyze the likelihood that a populationhascertaincharacteristics.

Ahypothesisissimplyaconjectureaboutacharacteristicorsetoffacts.
Whenperformingstatisticalanalyses,our hypothesesprovidethegeneralframeworkofwhatwearetestingandhowtoperformthetest.
These tests are never certain, and we can never prove or disprove hypotheses with statistics, but the outcomes of thesetestsprovideinformationthateitherhelpssupportorrefutethehypothesisitself.
Inthissection,wewilllearnaboutdifferenthypothesistests,howtodevelophypotheses,howtocalculatestatistics tohelpsupportorrefutethehypotheses,andhowtobetterunderstandtheerrorsassociatedwithhypothesistesting.
DevelopingNullandAlternativeHypotheses Hypothesis testing involves testing the difference between a hypothesized value of a population parameter and the estimate of that parameter, which is calculated from a sample.
If the parameter of interest is the mean of the population in hypothesis testing, we are essentially determining the magnitude of the difference between the mean ofthesampleandthehypothesizedmeanofthepopulation.
Ifthedifferenceisverylarge,werejectourhypothesis aboutthepopulation.
Ifthedifferenceisverysmall,wedonot.
Belowisanoverviewofthisprocess.
In statistics, the hypothesis to be tested is called the null hypothesis and is given the symbol H .
The alternative 0 hypothesisisgiventhesymbolH .
a The null hypothesis deﬁnes a speciﬁc value of the population parameter that is of interest.
Therefore, the null hypothesisalwaysincludesthepossibilityofequality.
Considerthefollowing: 2318.1.
HypothesisTestingandtheP-Value www.ck12.org H :µ=3.2 0 H :µ(cid:54)=3.2 a Inthissituation,ifoursamplemean, x¯, isverydifferentfrom3.2, wewouldrejectH .
Thatis,wewouldrejectH 0 0 ifx¯ismuchlargerthan3.2ormuchsmallerthan3.2.
Thisiscalledatwo-tailedtest.
Anx¯thatisveryunlikelyifH 0 istrueisconsideredtobegoodevidencethattheclaimH isnottrue.
0 Now consider H :µ=3.2 and H :µ>32.
In this situation, we would reject H for very large values of x¯.
This o a 0 is called a one-tailed test.
If, for this test, our data gives x¯=15, it would be highly unlikely that ﬁnding an x¯ this differentfrom3.2wouldoccurbychance,sowewouldprobablyrejectthenullhypothesisinfavorofthealternative hypothesis.
Example: If we were to test the hypothesis that the seniors had a mean SAT score of 1100, our null hypothesis wouldbethattheSATscorewouldbeequalto1100,or: H :µ=1100 0 We test the null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis, which, as previously stated, is given the symbol H a andincludestheoutcomesnotcoveredbythenullhypothesis.
Basically,thealternativehypothesisstatesthatthere isa(large)differencebetweenthehypothesizedpopulationmeanandthesamplemean.
Thealternativehypothesis can be supported only by rejecting the null hypothesis.
In our example above about the SAT scores of graduating seniors,ouralternativehypothesiswouldstatetheoppositeofthenullhypothesis,or: H :µ(cid:54)=1100 a Let’stakealookatexamplesanddevelopafewnullandalternativehypotheses.
Example: We have a medicine that is being manufactured, and each pill is supposed to have 14 milligrams of the activeingredient.
Whatareournullandalternativehypotheses?
Solution: H :µ=14 0 H :µ(cid:54)=14 a Our null hypothesis states that the population has a mean equal to 14 milligrams.
Our alternative hypothesis states thatthepopulationhasameanthatdiffersfrom14milligrams.
Thisisatwo-tailedtest.
Example: Aschoolprincipalwantstotestifitistruewhatteacherssay−thathighschooljuniorsusethecomputer anaverage3.2hoursaday.

H :µ=3.2 0 H :µ(cid:54)=3.2 a Our null hypothesis states that the population has a mean equal to 3.2 hours.
Our alternative hypothesis states that thepopulationhasameanthatdiffersfrom3.2hours.
Thisisalsoatwo-tailedtest.

Itistoolikelythat thediscrepancywasmerelyduetochance.
Weuseasamplemeaninstead.
We use statistical tests to determine if the sample data give good evidence against the H .
The numerical measure 0 thatweusetodeterminethestrengthofthesampleevidencewearewillingtoconsiderstrongenoughtorejectH is 0 calledthelevelofsigniﬁcance,anditisdenotedbyα.
Ifwechoose,forexample,α=0.01,wearesayingthatthe datawehavecollectedwouldhappen1%orlessofthetimewhenH istrue.
Ifourexperimentaloutcomewereto 0 happen1%ofthetimeorless,comparedtothevaluestatedinthenullhypothesis,wewoulddecidethatthisissuch anunusualoutcome(verysmallprobability)thatitisverylikelythatthenullhypothesisisfalse.
Themostfrequentlyusedlevelsofsigniﬁcanceare0.05and0.01.
Ifourdataresultinastatisticthatfallswithinthe regiondeterminedbythelevelofsigniﬁcance,thenwerejectH .
Therefore,theregioniscalledthecriticalregion 0 ortheregionofrejection.
Whendeterminingthecriticalregionsforatwo-tailedhypothesistest,thelevelofsigniﬁcancerepresentstheextreme areas under the normal density curve.
The ﬁgure below illustrates a two-tailed hypothesis test, because the critical region is located in both ends (tails) of the distribution.
For example, if there were a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, the criticalregionwouldbethemostextreme5percentunderthecurve,with2.5percentineachtailofthedistribution.
Figure1.
CriticalRegionfor.05two-tailedtest Therefore, if the mean from the sample taken from the population falls in one of these critical regions, we would concludethattherewastoomuchofadifferencebetweenoursamplemeanandthehypothesizedpopulationmean, andwewouldrejectthenullhypothesis.
However,ifthemeanfromthesamplefallsinthemiddleofthedistribution (inbetweenthecriticalregions),wewouldfailtorejectthenullhypothesis.
Wecalculatethecriticalregionforasingle-tailhypothesistestabitdifferently.
Wewoulduseasingle-tailhypothesis test when the direction of the results is anticipated or we are only interested in one direction of the results.
For example, a single-tail hypothesis test may be used when evaluating whether or not to adopt a new textbook.
We wouldonlydecidetoadoptthetextbookifitimprovedstudentachievementrelativetotheoldtextbook.
Asingle-tail alternativehypothesissimplystatesthatthemeanisgreaterorlessthanthehypothesizedvalue.
Whenperformingasingle-tailhypothesistest,ouralternativehypothesislooksabitdifferent.
Whendevelopingthe alternative hypothesis in a single-tail hypothesis test, we would use the symbols for "greater than" or "less than."
UsingourexampleaboutSATscoresofgraduatingseniors,ournullandalternativehypothesiswouldlooksomething like: H :µ=1100 0 H :µ>1100 a In this scenario, our null hypothesis states that the mean SAT score would be equal to 1100, while the alternative hypothesisstatesthatthemeanSATscorewouldbegreaterthan1100.

HypothesisTestingandtheP-Value www.ck12.org wehaveonlyonecriticalregion, becauseweputtheentireregionofrejectionintojustonesideofthedistribution.
When the alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is "greater than," the critical region is on the right side of the distribution.
When the alternative hypothesis is that the sample is "less than," the critical region is on the left sideofthedistribution(seebelow).

These values are speciﬁed by the z-distribution and can be found in a table that lists the areas of each of the tails under a normal distribution.
Using this table, we ﬁnd that for a 0.05 signiﬁcance level, our critical values would fallat1.96standarderrorsaboveandbelowthemean.
Fora0.01signiﬁcancelevel,ourcriticalvalueswouldfallat 2.57standarderrorsaboveandbelowthemean.

If ouralternativehypothesisisthatthemeanisgreaterthanaspeciﬁedvalue,thecriticalvaluewouldbe1.645.
Dueto thesymmetryofthenormaldistribution,ifthealternativehypothesisisthatthemeanislessthanaspeciﬁedvalue, thecriticalvaluewouldbe−1.645.

TechnologyNote: FindingCriticalz-ValuesontheTI-83/84Calculator You can also ﬁnd this critical value using the TI-83/84 calculator as follows: Press [2ND][DISTR], choose ’in- vNorm(’, enter 0.05, 0, and 1, separated by commas, and press [ENTER].
This returns −1.64485.
The syntax for the’invNorm(’commandis’invNorm(areatotheleft,mean,standarddeviation)’.
CalculatingtheTestStatistic Before evaluating our hypotheses by determining the critical region and calculating the test statistic, we need to conﬁrmthatthedistributionisnormalanddeterminethehypothesizedmean,µ,ofthedistribution.

Example: College A has an average SAT score of 1500.
From a random sample of 125 freshman psychology students, we ﬁnd the average SAT score to be 1450, with a standard deviation of 100.
We want to know if these freshman psychology students are representative of the overall population in terms of SAT scores.
What are our hypothesesandteststatistic?
Answer: 1.
Let’sﬁrstdevelopournullandalternativehypotheses: H :µ=1500 0 H :µ(cid:54)=1500 a 2.
Wechooseα=0.05.

Ifwechooseα=0.05,thecriticalvalueswillbe−1.96and1.96.
(Use’invNorm(0.025,0,1)’ and the symmetry of the normal distribution to determine these critical values.)

Based on this sample, we believe that freshman psychology students’ SAT scores are not representative of the overallSATscoreforthecollege.
Example: A farmer is trying out a planting technique that he hopes will increase the yield of his pea plants.
Over thelast5years,theaveragenumberofpodsononeofhispeaplantswas145pods,withastandarddeviationof100 pods.
Thisyear,aftertryinghisnewplantingtechnique,hetakesarandomsampleof144ofhisplantsandﬁndsthe average number of pods to be 147.

First,wedevelopournullandalternativehypotheses: 2358.1.
HypothesisTestingandtheP-Value www.ck12.org H :µ=145 0 H :µ>145 a This alternative hypothesis uses the ’>’ symbol, since the farmer believes that there might be a gain in the number ofpods.

A group of students collects 16 candy bars and weighs each bar.

Based on our sample, the mean weight of Yummy candy bars is not what the manufacturer stated in the null hypothesis.

FindingtheP-ValueofanEvent Wecanalsoevaluateahypothesisbyasking,“Whatistheprobabilityofobtainingthevalueoftheteststatisticthat wedidifthenullhypothesisistrue?”ThisiscalledtheP-value.
Example: Let’susetheexampleofthepeafarmer.
Aswementioned,thefarmeriswonderingifthenumberofpea pods per plant has gone up with his new planting technique and ﬁnds that out of a sample of 144 peas, there is an average number of 147 pods per plant (compared to the historical average of 145 pods).
To determine the P-value, 236www.ck12.org Chapter8.
HypothesisTesting we ask, "What is P(z>0.24)?"
That is, what is the probability of obtaining a z-score greater than 0.24 if the null hypothesisistrue?
Answer: Usingthe’normcdf(0.24,99999999,0,1)’commandonagraphingcalculator,orusingatableofz-values, weﬁndthisprobabilitytobe0.41.
Thisindicatesthatthereisa41%chancethatunderthenullhypothesis,thepeas will produce more than 147 pods.
Since the P-value is greater than α, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
This is thesameconclusionthatwasreachedearlier.
Example: SupposeyourhypothesesareH : µ=6andH : µ>6.
Yourcalculatedteststatisticisz=2.1.
Youare 0 a toldthatyoursigniﬁcancelevelαis.05.
Determinethep-value.
Answer: When you are told to calculate the p-value, it is not necessary to ﬁnd a critical value.
Simply use the value of your test statistic, which is z = 2.1, and ﬁnd the area (or probability) to its right.
Using a calculator or Normal Table, the p-value is calculated as .0179.
Because the p-value is less than α of .05, you would reject the nullhypothesis.
Example: This is the same situation as the previous example, except that a 2-sided alternative hypothesis is used, and we calculate the p-value a bit differently.
Suppose your hypotheses are H : µ = 6 and H : µ (cid:54)= 6.
Your 0 a calculatedteststatisticisz=2.1.
Youaretoldthatyoursigniﬁcancelevelαis.05.
Determinethep-value.
Answer: Weﬁndthearea(orprobability)totherightoftheteststatistic,whichwepreviouslyfoundas.0179.
But becausethealternativehypothesiswas2-sided,weneedtodoublethe.0179,takingintoaccountthatthealternative hypothesis said that we might ﬁnd our test statistic either in the right tail or in the left tail.
Thus, for a 2-sided alternative,wedoubletheoriginalvalue.
Thep-valueforthis2-sidedtestis.0358.
Thisvalueisstilllessthan.05, sowewouldstillrejectthenullhypothesis.
(Note: When you use a calculator to perform the hypothesis test, the p-value is automatically doubled by the calculator.)

Introduction Intheprevioussection,westudiedtheteststatisticthatisusedwhenyouaretestinghypothesesaboutthemeanofa populationandyouhavealargesample(n>30).
In addition to the mean, statisticians are often interested in making inferences about a population proportion.
For example,whenwelookatelectionresults,weoftenlookattheproportionofpeoplewhovoteandwhothesevoters choose.
Typically, we call these proportions percentages, and we would say something like, “Approximately 68 percentofthepopulationvotedinthiselection,and48percentofthesevotersvotedforBarackObama.” Sohowdowetesthypothesesaboutproportions?

• WhatproportionofvoterswillvoteforJohnMcCain?
• WhatpercentageofpeoplewillchooseDietPepsioverDietCoke?
To test questions like these, we make hypotheses about population proportions.
For example, here are some hypotheseswecouldmake: H :35%ofgraduatingseniorswillattenda4-yearcollege.
0 H :42%ofvoterswillvoteforJohnMcCain.
0 H :26%ofpeoplewillchooseDietPepsioverDietCoke.

• Randomlyselectasample.
• Usethesampleproportion, pˆ,totestthestatedhypothesis.
To determine the test statistic, we need to know the sampling distribution of the sample proportions.
We use the binomial distribution, which is appropriate for situations in which two outcomes are possible (for example, voting foracandidateandnotvotingforacandidate).
Therefore,theteststatisticcanbecalculatedasfollows: 240www.ck12.org Chapter8.

Whatwouldbeourhypothesesandteststatistic?
Since we want to test the proportion of graduating seniors, and we think that proportion is around 60 percent, our hypothesesare: H : p=0.6 0 H : p(cid:54)=0.6 a Also, the test statistic would be z= (cid:113) pˆ−0.6 .
To complete this calculation, we would have to have a value for 0.6(1−0.6) 400 thesampleproportion.

Thus, the critical region is a z-value of 1.645 or greater.
A sketchcanbeuseful.
Next,wecalculatethevalueoftheteststatistic: Theteststatisticisz= (cid:113)0.74−0.7 ≈1.51.
(0.7)(1−0.7) 300 Since our critical value is 1.645 and our test statistic is 1.51, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
This means that we cannot statistically conclude that the population proportion is greater than 0.70 .
In other words, given this information, it is not safe to conclude that at least 70 percent of the voters would favor this bill with any degree of certainty.
Even though the sample proportion of voters supporting the bill is over 70 percent, this could be due to chanceandisnotstatisticallysigniﬁcant.
We can calculate the p-value for this hypothesis test.
We use the test statistic z = 1.51 and determine the area (probability)toitsright.
Usingthecalculatorortableofz-values,weﬁndthatthisarea(probability)is1-.9345= .0655.

LessonSummary In statistics, we also make inferences about proportions of a population.

Finally,wecalculatetheteststatisticforthesampleof7th gradersasfollows: 147−145 z= ≈1.414 √20 200 Since the calculated z-score of 1.414 is smaller than 1.64, it does not fall in the critical region.

• UseStudent’st-distributiontocalculateaconﬁdenceintervalforthepopulationmean.
Introduction Back in the early 1900s, a chemist at a brewery in Ireland discovered that when he was working with very small samples, the distributions of the means differed signiﬁcantly from the normal distribution.
He noticed that as his samplesizeschanged,theshapeofthedistributionchangedaswell.

HypothesisTestingwithSmallSampleSizes Student’st-distributionsareafamilyofdistributionsthat,likethenormaldistribution,aresymmetrical,bell-shaped, andcenteredonamean.
However, thedistributionshapechangesasthesamplesizechanges.
Therefore, thereisa speciﬁc shape, or distribution, for every sample of a given size (see ﬁgure below; each distribution has a different valueofk,thenumberofdegreesoffreedom,whichis1lessthanthesizeofthesample).

HypothesisTesting As the number of observations gets larger, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the normal distribution.
In general,oncethesamplesizeislargeenough−usuallyabout120−wewouldusethenormaldistributionoraz-table instead.

Answer: First,weestablishournullandalternativehypotheses: H :µ=3.10 0 H :µ(cid:54)=3.10 a Next,weuseouralphalevelof0.05andthet-distributiontabletoﬁndourcriticalvalues.
Foratwo-tailedtestwith 19degreesoffreedomanda0.05levelofsigniﬁcance,ourcriticalvaluesareequalto±2.093.
Finally,incalculatingtheteststatistic,weusetheformulaasshown: x¯−µ 3.18−3.10 0 t = = ≈0.66 √s 0√.54 n 20 ThismeansthattheobservedsamplemeanoftheGPAoffootballplayersof3.18is0.66standarderrorsabovethe hypothesized value of 3.10.

AvisualpictureoftheP-valuecanbeobtainedbyusingagraphingcalculatorasfollows: The spread of any t-distribution is greater than that of a standard normal distribution.
This is due to the fact that in thedenominator ofthe formula, σ has beenreplaced with s. Since s is arandom quantitychanging withvarious samples,thevariabilityint isgreater,resultinginalargerspread.
248www.ck12.org Chapter8.
HypothesisTesting Noticethatintheﬁrstdistributiongraphshownabove,thespreadoftheinnercurveissmall,butinthesecondgraph, both distributions are basically overlapping and are roughly normal.
This is due to the increase in the degrees of freedom.
To further illustrate this point, the t-distributions for 1 and 12 degrees of freedom can be graphed on a graphing calculator.

WealreadyknowthattheCentral LimitTheoremstatesthatthesamplingdistributionofastatisticwillbeclosetonormalwithalargeenoughsample size, but, in fact, the Central Limit Theorem predicts a roughly normal distribution under any of the following conditions: • Thepopulationdistributionisnormal.
• Thesamplingdistributionissymmetricandthesamplesizeis≤15.
• Thesamplingdistributionismoderatelyskewedandthesamplesizeis16≤n≤30.
• Thesamplesizeisgreaterthan30,withoutoutliers.
In addition to the fact that thet-distribution can be used with any bell-shaped distribution, it also has some unique properties.
Thesepropertiesareasfollows: • Themeanofthedistributionequalszero.
• Thepopulationstandarddeviationisunknown.
• Although the t-distribution is bell-shaped, the smaller sample sizes produce a ﬂatter curve.
The distribution is not as mound-shaped as a normal distribution, and the tails are thicker.
As the sample size increases and approaches30,thedistributionapproachesanormaldistribution.
• Thepopulationisunimodalandsymmetric.

Student’st-Distribution www.ck12.org Answer: The null hypothesis is H : µ = 300 and the alternative hypothesis is H : µ <300.
This is a one-sided hypothesis 0 a test.

CONFIDENCEINTERVALUSINGTHEtDISTRIBUTION Rememberthataconﬁdenceintervalgivesusarangeofvaluesforthevalueoftheunknownpopulationmean.
We earlier used the formula below for calculating a 95% conﬁdence interval when we knew the population standard deviation.

Student’st-Distribution www.ck12.org FIGURE8.3 You should use the t distribution rather than the normal distribution when the population standard deviation is not knownandhastobeestimatedfromsampledata.
Whenthesamplesizeislarge,say100orabove,thetdistributionis verysimilartothestandardnormaldistribution.
However,withsmallersamplesizes,thetdistributionhasrelatively more scores in its tails than does the normal distribution.
As a result, you have to extend farther from the mean to containagivenproportionofthearea.
Recallthatwithanormaldistribution,95%ofthedistributioniswithin1.96 standard deviations of the mean.
Using the t distribution, if you have a sample size of only 5, 95% of the area is within2.78standarddeviationsofthemean.
Therefore,thestandarderrorofthemeanwouldbemultipliedby2.78 ratherthan1.96.

DependentandIndependentSamples When we are working with one sample, we know that we have to randomly select the sample from the population, measure that sample’s statistics, and then make a hypothesis about the population based on that sample.
When we workwithtwoindependentsamples,weassumethatifthesamplesareselectedatrandomorarerandomlyassigned toagroup,thetwosampleswillvaryonlybychance,andanydifferenceobtainedwillbebecauseofsomeunderlying truedifferencebetweenthegroups.
Independentsamplescanoccurintwoscenarios.
In one, when testing the difference of the means between two ﬁxed populations, we test the differences between samples from each population.
When both samples are randomly selected, we can make inferences about the populations.
Intheother,whenworkingwithsubjects(people,pets,etc.
),ifweselectarandomsampleandthenrandomlyassign halfofthesubjectstoonegroupandhalftoanother,wecanmakeinferencesaboutthepopulation.
Dependent samples are a bit different.
Two samples of data are dependent when each observation in one sample is paired with a speciﬁc observation in the other sample.
This gives rise to the term "matched-pairs," which is often used to describe this type of experimental situation.
In short, these types of samples are related to each other.
Dependent samples can occur in two scenarios.
In one, each member will be measured twice, such as in a pre-test/post-test situation (scores on a test before and after the lesson).
The other scenario is one in which an observationinonesampleismatchedwithanobservationinthesecondsample.

TestingaHypothesisforDependentandIndependentSamples www.ck12.org To distinguish between tests of hypotheses for independent and dependent samples, we use a different symbol for hypotheses with dependent samples.
For dependent sample hypotheses, we use the symbol µ to symbolize the d mean difference between the two samples.
Therefore, in our null hypothesis, we state that the mean difference of thetwosamplesisequalto0,or µ =0.
d TestingHypotheseswithDependentSamples Dependentsamplesgenerallyoccurwithwhatiscalledmatchedpairs.

Iftheweight-lossprogramisnoteffective,weexpectthemeanweightloss tobe0.
Ifwehave10peopleusingtheweight-lossprogram,weweigheachpersonatthebeginningofthedietand then again at the end of a 6-month period.
The weight loss for each person is the difference between the starting weight and the ending weight.
Each person actually has two measurements, but we consider the difference (net weight loss) as a single data value for each person.
For a sample of 10 people, we would have 20 measurements, butwewouldbeinterestedinonlythe10valuesofthenetweightloss.
Continuing with the weight-loss example, consider what the situation would be if the weight-loss program were bogus.
If this were the case, then the expected weight loss for the participants would be 0.

TestingHypothesesabouttheDifferenceinProportionsbetweenTwoIndependentSamples Suppose we want to test if there is a difference between proportions of two independent samples.
As discussed in the previous lesson, proportions are used extensively in polling and surveys, especially by people trying to predict election results.
It is possible to test a hypothesis about the proportions of two independent samples by using a methodsimilartothatdescribedabove.

• Wheninvestigatingtheproportionsoffreshmanandsophomorestudentswhoreporttestanxiety.
• Whentestingiftheproportionsofhighschoolboysandgirlswhosmokecigarettesisequal.
In testing hypotheses about the difference in proportions of two independent samples, we state the hypotheses and set the criterion for rejecting the null hypothesis in similar ways as the other hypotheses tests.
In these types of tests, we set the proportions of the samples equal to each other in the null hypothesis, H : p = p , and use the 0 1 2 appropriate standard table to determine the critical values.
Remember that we would use the binomial distribution forsmallsampleprobabilities,aswedidearlierinthiscourse.

Introduction So far we have learned how to describe distributions of a single variable and how to perform hypothesis tests concerning parameters of these distributions.
But what if we notice that two variables seem to be related?
We may notice that the values of two variables, such as verbal SAT score and GPA, behave in the same way and that students who have a high verbal SAT score also tend to have a high GPA (see table below).
In this case, we would wanttostudythenatureoftheconnectionbetweenthetwovariables.
TABLE 9.1: AtableofverbalSATvaluesandGPAsforsevenstudents.
Student SATScore GPA 1 595 3.4 2 520 3.2 3 715 3.9 4 405 2.3 5 680 3.9 6 490 2.5 7 565 3.5 These types of studies are quite common, and we can use the concept of correlation to describe the relationship betweenthetwovariables.
BivariateData,CorrelationBetweenValues,andtheUseofScatterplots Correlation measures the relationship between bivariate data.
Bivariate data are data sets in which each subject has two observations associated with it.
In our example above, we notice that there are two observations (verbal SATscoreandGPA)foreachsubject(inthiscase,astudent).
Canyouthinkofotherscenarioswhenwewoulduse bivariatedata?

RegressionandCorrelation Whenallthepointsonascatterplotlieonastraightline, youhavewhatiscalledaperfectcorrelationbetweenthe twovariables(seebelow).
A scatterplot in which the points do not have a linear trend (either positive or negative) is called a zero correlation oranear-zerocorrelation(seebelow).
When examining scatterplots, we also want to look not only at the direction of the relationship (positive, negative, or zero), but also at the magnitude of the relationship.
If we drew an imaginary oval around all of the points on the scatterplot, we would be able to see the extent, or the magnitude, of the relationship.
If the points are close to one another and the width of the imaginary oval is small, this means that there is a strong correlation between the variables(seebelow).
2719.1.

CorrelationCoefﬁcients While examining scatterplots gives us some idea about the relationship between two variables, we use a statistic called the correlation coefﬁcient to give us a more precise measurement of the relationship between the two variables.
The correlation coefﬁcient is an index that describes the relationship and can take on values between −1.0 and +1.0, with a positive correlation coefﬁcient indicating a positive correlation and a negative correlation coefﬁcientindicatinganegativecorrelation.
The absolute value of the coefﬁcient indicates the magnitude, or the strength, of the relationship.
The closer the absolutevalueofthecoefﬁcientisto1, thestrongertherelationship.
Forexample, acorrelationcoefﬁcientof0.20 indicates that there is a weak linear relationship between the variables, while a coefﬁcient of −0.90 indicates that thereisastronglinearrelationship.
Thevalueofaperfectpositivecorrelationis1.0,whilethevalueofaperfectnegativecorrelationis−1.0.
When there is no linear relationship between two variables, the correlation coefﬁcient is 0.
It is important to remember that a correlation coefﬁcient of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship, but there may still be a strongrelationshipbetweenthetwovariables.

The Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁcient is a statistic that is used to measure the strength and direction ofalinearcorrelation.

Tounderstandhowthiscoefﬁcientiscalculated,let’ssuppose that there is a positive relationship between two variables, X andY.
If a subject has a score on X that is above the mean, we expect the subject to have a score onY that is also above the mean.
Pearson developed his correlation 272www.ck12.org Chapter9.
RegressionandCorrelation coefﬁcient by computing the sum of cross products.
He multiplied the two scores, X andY, for each subject and then added these cross products across the individuals.
Next, he divided this sum by the number of subjects minus one.
Thiscoefﬁcientis,therefore,themeanofthecrossproductsofscores.

Therefore,theformulaforthiscoefﬁcientisasfollows: ∑zXzY r = XY n−1 Inotherwords, thecoefﬁcientisexpressedasthesumofthecrossproductsofthestandardz-scoresdividedbythe numberofdegreesoffreedom.

Let’s use our example from the introduction to demonstrate how to calculate the correlation coefﬁcient using the raw score formula.

For example, the correlationcoefﬁcient of 0.95 thatwe calculated above tellsus that to ahigh degree, the variance in the scores on the verbal SAT is associated with the variance in the GPA, and vice versa.
For example, we could say that factors that inﬂuence the verbal SAT, such as health, parent college level, etc., would also contribute to individualdifferencesintheGPA.Thehigherthecorrelationwehavebetweentwovariables, thelargertheportion ofthevariancethatcanbeexplainedbytheindependentvariable.

Therefore, the coefﬁcient of determination is written as r2.

However, while many pairs of variables have a linear relationship, some do not.
For example, let’s consider performance anxiety.

(Wesome- times call this good stress.)
However, at some point, the increase in anxiety may cause a person’s performance to godown.
Wecallthesenon-linearrelationshipscurvilinearrelationships.
Wecanidentifycurvilinearrelationships byexaminingscatterplots(seebelow).
Onemayaskwhycurvilinearrelationshipsposeaproblemwhencalculating the correlation coefﬁcient.
The answer is that if we use the traditional formula to calculate these relationships, it will not be an accurate index, and we will be underestimating the relationship between the variables.
If we graphedperformanceagainstanxiety,wewouldseethatanxietyhasastrongaffectonperformance.
However,ifwe calculatedthecorrelationcoefﬁcient,wewouldarriveataﬁgurearoundzero.
Therefore,thecorrelationcoefﬁcient isnotalwaysthebeststatistictousetounderstandtherelationshipbetweenvariables.
HomogeneityoftheGroup Another error we could encounter when calculating the correlation coefﬁcient is homogeneity of the group.
When a group is homogeneous, or possesses similar characteristics, the range of scores on either or both of the variables is restricted.
For example, suppose we are interested in ﬁnding out the correlation between IQ and salary.
If only membersoftheMensaClub(aclubforpeoplewithIQsover140)aresampled,wewillmostlikelyﬁndaverylow correlationbetweenIQandsalary, sincemostmemberswillhaveaconsistentlyhighIQ,buttheirsalarieswillstill vary.
This does not mean that there is not a relationship−it simply means that the restriction of the sample limited themagnitudeofthecorrelationcoefﬁcient.
SampleSize Finally, we should consider sample size.
One may assume that the number of observations used in the calculation ofthecorrelationcoefﬁcientmayinﬂuencethemagnitudeofthecoefﬁcientitself.
However,thisisnotthecase.
Yet while the sample size does not affect the correlation coefﬁcient, it may affect the accuracy of the relationship.
The largerthesample,themoreaccurateofapredictorthecorrelationcoefﬁcientwillbeoftherelationshipbetweenthe twovariables.
LessonSummary Bivariate data are data sets with two observations that are assigned to the same subject.
Correlation measures the direction and magnitude of the linear relationship between bivariate data.
When examining scatterplot graphs, we can determine if correlations are positive, negative, perfect, or zero.
A correlation is strong when the points in the scatterplotareclosetogether.
The correlation coefﬁcient is a precise measurement of the relationship between the two variables.
This index can takeonvaluesbetweenandincluding−1.0and+1.0.
To calculate the correlation coefﬁcient, we most often use the raw score formula, which allows us to calculate the coefﬁcientbyhand.

Introduction In the last section, we learned about the concept of correlation, which we deﬁned as the measure of the linear relationship between two variables.
As a reminder, when we have a strong positive correlation, we can expect that if the score on one variable is high, the score on the other variable will also most likely be high.
With correlation, weareabletoroughlypredictthescoreofonevariablewhenwehavetheother.
Predictionissimplytheprocessof estimatingscoresofonevariablebasedonthescoresofanothervariable.
In the previous section, we illustrated the concept of correlation through scatterplot graphs.
We saw that when variables were correlated, the points on a scatterplot graph tended to follow a straight line.
If we could draw this straight line, it would, in theory, represent the change in one variable associated with the change in the other.
This lineiscalledtheleastsquaresline,orthelinearregressionline(seeﬁgurebelow).
CalculatingandGraphingtheRegressionLine Linear regression involves using data to calculate a line that best ﬁts that data and then using that line to predict scores.
In linear regression, we use one variable (the explanatory variable) to predict the outcome of another (the responsevariable).
Tocalculatethisline,weanalyzethepatternsbetweenthetwovariables.
Wearelookingforalineofbestﬁt,andtherearemanywaysonecoulddeﬁnethis"best"ﬁt.
Statisticiansdeﬁnethis linetobetheonewhichminimizesthesumofthesquareddistancesfromtheobserveddatatotheline.
To determine this line, we want to ﬁnd the change in X that will be reﬂected by the average change inY.
After we calculatethisaveragechange, wecanapplyittoanyvalueofX togetanapproximationofY.
Sincetheregression lineisusedtopredictthevalueofY foranygivenvalueofX,allpredictedvalueswillbelocatedontheregression line, itself.
Therefore, we try to ﬁt the regression line to the data by having the smallest sum of squared distances possible from each of the data points to the line.

RegressionandCorrelation is minimal difference between the observations and the line is called the method of least squares, which we will discussfurtherinthefollowingsections.
As you can see, the regression line is a straight line that expresses the relationship between two variables.
When predicting one score by using another, we use an equation such as the following, which is equivalent to the slope- interceptformoftheequationforastraightline: yˆ=a+bx where: yˆisthescorethatwearetryingtopredict.

Forexample,ifwearediscussingthelinearrelationshipofyearsofeducationand annualincome,wewouldusex,yearsofeducation(theexplanatoryvariable),topredicttheannualincome(response variable).
In the formula, we use the symbol yˆ for the y-value of income, because it is predicted from the linear equation.
To calculate the line itself, we need to ﬁnd the values for b (the slope) and a (the y-intercept).
The regression coefﬁcient explains the nature of the relationship between the two variables.
It is the slope of the regression line, and slope measures the change in y with respect to a unit change in x.
Essentially, the regression coefﬁcient tells us that a certain change in the explanatory variable (x) is associated with a certain change in the response variable (y).
For example, if we had a regression coefﬁcient (slope) of 10.76, rewritten as 10.76 we would say that a change 1 of1unitinX isassociatedwithachangeof10.76unitsofY.

CalculatingResidualsandUnderstandingtheirRelationtotheRegressionEquation Recall that the linear regression line is the line that best ﬁts the given data.
Ideally, we would like to minimize the distances of all data points to the regression line.
These distances are called the error, e, and are also known as the residual values.
As mentioned, we ﬁt the regression line to the data points in a scatterplot using the least-squares method.
Agoodlinewillhavesmallresiduals.
Noticeintheﬁgurebelowthattheresidualsaretheverticaldistances betweentheobservationsandthepredictedvaluesontheregressionline: To ﬁnd the residual values, we subtract the predicted values from the actual values, so e = y−yˆ.
Theoretically, the sum of all residual values is zero, since we are ﬁnding the line of best ﬁt, with the predicted values as close as 2839.2.
Least-SquaresRegression www.ck12.org possible to the actual value.
It does not make sense to use the sum of the residuals as an indicator of the ﬁt, since, again, the negative and positive residuals always cancel each other out to give a sum of zero.
Therefore, we try to minimizethesumofthesquaredresiduals,or∑(y−yˆ)2.

RegressionandCorrelation 9.3 Inferences about Regression LearningObjectives • Makeinferencesaboutregressionmodels,includinghypothesistestingforlinearrelationships.
• Checkregressionassumptions.
Introduction In the previous section, we learned about the least-squares model, or the linear regression model.
The linear regression model uses the concept of correlation to help us predict the score of a variable based on our knowledge ofthescoreofanothervariable.
Inthissection, wewillinvestigateseveralinferencesandassumptionsthatwecan makeaboutthelinearregressionmodel.

Theﬁgurebelowshowsanexampleofwhataregressionlineﬁttovariableswithnocorrelation(r=0)would looklike.
Asyoucansee,foranyvalueofX,wealwaysgetthesamepredictedvalueofY.
Usingthisknowledge,wecandeterminethatifthereisnorelationshipbetweenX andY,constructingaregression line doesn’t help us very much, because, again, the predicted score would always be the same.
Therefore, when we estimate a linear regression model, we want to ensure that the slope, β, for the population does not equal zero.
Furthermore,itisbeneﬁcialtotesthowstrong(orfaraway)fromzerotheslopemustbetostrengthenourprediction oftheY scores.

InferencesaboutRegression www.ck12.org In hypothesis testing of linear regression models, the null hypothesis to be tested is that the slope, β, equals zero.

H : β=0 0 H : β(cid:54)=0 a The null hypothesis is saying, essentially, that there is no linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
The alternative hypothesis is saying that the slope is signiﬁcantly different from 0, and therefore, the linearrelationshipexistsandcanbeusefulforprediction.

Chi-Square 10.1 The Goodness-of-Fit Test LearningObjectives • Knowthatthechi-squaredistributionisafamilyofcurvesdeﬁnedbythedegreesoffreedom.
• Identifytheconditionswhichmustbesatisﬁedwhenusingthechi-squaretest.
• Evaluateahypothesisusingthegoodness-of-ﬁttest.
Introduction In previous lessons, we learned that there are several different tests that we can use to analyze data and test hypotheses.
The type of test that we choose depends on the data available and what question we are trying to answer.
Weanalyzesimpledescriptivestatistics,suchasthemean,median,mode,andstandarddeviationtogiveus anideaofthedistributionandtoremoveoutliers,ifnecessary.
Wecalculateprobabilitiestodeterminethelikelihood of something happening.
Finally, we use regression analysis to examine the relationship between two or more continuousvariables.
However, there is another test that we have yet to cover.
To analyze patterns between distinct categories, such as genders,politicalcandidates,locations,orpreferences,weusethechi-squaretest.
Uptothispoint,everyhypothesis testhasusednumericaldata,butthechi-squaretestgivesusapowerfultoolforanalyzingcategoricaldata.
This test is used when estimating how closely a sample matches the expected distribution (also known as the goodness-of-ﬁt test) and when estimating if two random variables are independent of one another (also known asthetestofindependence).
In this lesson, we will learn more about the goodness-of-ﬁt test and how to create and evaluate hypotheses using thistest.
TheChi-SquareDistribution Thechi-squaredistributioncanbeusedtoperformthegoodness-of-ﬁttest, whichcomparestheobservedvaluesof acategoricalvariablewiththeexpectedvaluesofthatsamevariable.
Example: Wewouldusethechi-squaregoodness-of-ﬁttesttoevaluateiftherewasapreferenceinthetypeoflunch that 11th grade students bought in the cafeteria.
For this type of comparison, it helps to make a table to visualize the problem.
We could construct the following table, known as a contingency table, to compare the observed and expectedvalues.
Research Question: Do 11th grade students prefer a certain type of lunch?
Notice that the categories are now categorical(salad,sub,dailyspecial,homemade),andwearecountingonlyhowmanystudentsﬁtintoeachofthese categories.
Usingasampleof11th gradestudents,werecordedthefollowinginformation: TABLE 10.1: FrequencyofTypeofSchoolLunchChosenbyStudents TypeofLunch ObservedFrequency(O) ExpectedFrequency(E) Salad 21 25 29310.1.
TheGoodness-of-FitTest www.ck12.org TABLE 10.1: (continued) TypeofLunch ObservedFrequency(O) ExpectedFrequency(E) SubSandwich 29 25 DailySpecial 14 25 Homemade 36 25 If there is no difference in which type of lunch is preferred, we would expect the students to prefer each type of lunch equally.
To calculate the expected frequency of each category when assuming school lunch preferences are distributed equally, we divide the number of observations by the number of categories.
Since there are 100 observationsand4categories,theexpectedfrequencyofeachcategoryis 100,or25.
4 The value that indicates the comparison between the observed and expected frequency is called the chi-square statistic.
The idea is that if the observed frequency is close to the expected frequency, then the chi-square statistic will be small.
On the other hand, if there is a substantial difference between the two frequencies, then we would expectthechi-squarestatistictobelarge.
Tocalculatethechi-squarestatistic,χ2,weusethefollowingformula: χ2=∑(O−E)2 E where: χ2 isthechi-squareteststatistic.
O istheobservedfrequencyvalueforeachevent.
E istheexpectedfrequencyvalueforeachevent.

Thatis,df =c−1.
Example: Usingourexampleaboutthepreferencesfortypesofschoollunches,wecalculatethedegreesoffreedom asfollows: df =numberofcategories−1 3=4−1 There are many situations that use the goodness-of-ﬁt test, including surveys, taste tests, genetics, and analysis of behaviors.
Interestingly, goodness-of-ﬁt tests are also used in casinos to determine if there is cheating in games of chance, such as cards or dice.
For example, if a certain card or number on a die shows up more than expected (a highobservedfrequencycomparedtotheexpectedfrequency),ofﬁcialsusethegoodness-of-ﬁttesttodeterminethe likelihoodthattheplayermaybecheatingorthatthegamemaynotbefair.
EvaluatingHypothesesUsingtheGoodness-of-FitTest Let’suseouroriginalexampletocreateandtestahypothesisusingthegoodness-of-ﬁtchi-squaretest.
First,wewill need to state the null and alternative hypotheses for our research question.
Since our research question asks, “Do 294www.ck12.org Chapter10.

Therefore, our alternative hypothesis would statethatthereisasigniﬁcantdifferencebetweentheobservedandexpectedfrequencies.
NullHypothesis H :O=E (Thereisnostatisticallysigniﬁcantdifferencebetweenobservedandexpectedfrequencies.)

a Also,thenumberofdegreesoffreedomforthistestis3.
Usinganalphalevelof0.05,welookunderthecolumnfor0.05andtherowfordegreesoffreedom,which,again, is 3.
According to the standard chi-square distribution table, we see that the critical value for chi-square is 7.815.
Therefore,wewouldrejectthenullhypothesisifthechi-squarestatisticisgreaterthan7.815.
Notethatwecancalculatethechi-squarestatisticwithrelativeease.

TestofIndependence www.ck12.org 10.2 Test of Independence LearningObjectives • Identifythedataitemsneededtoperformcalculationswhenperformingthechi-squaretestfromcontingency tables.
• Conductthetestofindependencetodeterminewhethertwovariablesareindependentornot.
• Conductthetestofhomogeneitytoexaminetheproportionsofavariableattributedtodifferentpopulations.
Introduction As mentioned in the previous lesson, the chi-square test can be used to both estimate how closely an observed distributionmatchesanexpecteddistribution(thegoodness-of-ﬁttest)andtoestimatewhethertworandomvariables areindependentofoneanother(thetestofindependence).
Inthislesson,wewillexaminethetestofindependence ingreaterdetail.
The chi-square test of independence is used to assess if two factors are related.
This test is often used in social science research to determine if factors are independent of each other.
For example, we would use this test to determinerelationshipsbetweenvotingpatternsandrace,incomeandgender,andbehaviorandeducation.
Ingeneral,whenrunningthetestofindependence,weask,“IsVariableX independentofVariableY?”Itisimportant tonotethatthistestdoesnottesthowthevariablesarerelated,justsimplywhetherornottheyareindependentofone another.
Forexample, whilethetestofindependencecanhelpusdetermineifincomeandgenderareindependent, itcannothelpusassesshowonecategorymightaffecttheother.
DrawingDatafromContingencyTablesNeededtoPerformCalculationswhenRunningaChi-Square Test Contingency tables can help us frame our hypotheses and solve problems.
Often, we use contingency tables to list the variables and observational patterns that will help us to run a chi-square test.
For example, we could use a contingencytabletorecordtheanswerstophonesurveysorobservedbehavioralpatterns.
Example: We would use a contingency table to record the data when analyzing whether women are more likely to voteforaRepublicanorDemocraticcandidatewhencomparedtomen.
Inthisexample,wewanttoknowifvoting patterns are independent of gender.
Hypothetical data for 76 females and 62 males from the state of California are inthecontingencytablebelow.
TABLE 10.4: FrequencyofCaliforniaCitizensvotingforaRepublicanorDemocraticCandidate Democratic Republican Total Female 48 28 76 Male 36 26 62 Total 84 54 138 Similar to the chi-square goodness-of-ﬁt test, the test of independence is a comparison of the differences between observed and expected values.
However, in this test, we need to calculate the expected value using the row and column totals from the table.
The expected value for each of the potential outcomes in the table can be calculated 298www.ck12.org Chapter10.
Chi-Square usingthefollowingformula: (RowTotal)(ColumnTotal) ExpectedFrequency= TotalNumberofObservations In the table above, we calculated the row totals to be 76 females and 62 males, while the column totals are 84 Democrats and 54 Republicans.
Using the formula, we ﬁnd the following expected frequencies for the potential outcomes: TheexpectedfrequencyforfemaleDemocraticoutcomeis (76)(84) =46.26 138 TheexpectedfrequencyforfemaleRepublicanoutcomeis (76)(54) =29.74.
138 TheexpectedfrequencyformaleDemocraticoutcomeis (62)(84) =37.74.
138 TheexpectedfrequencyformaleRepublicanoutcomeis (62)(54) =24.26.
138 Usingthesecalculatedexpectedfrequencies,wecanmodifythetableabovetolooksomethinglikethis: TABLE 10.5: Democratic Democratic Republican Republican Total Observed Expected Observed Expected Female 48 46.26 28 29.74 76 Male 36 37.74 26 24.26 62 Total 84 54 138 Withtheﬁguresabove,weareabletocalculatethechi-squarestatisticwithrelativeease.
TheChi-SquareTestofIndependence When running the test of independence, we use similar steps as when running the goodness-of-ﬁt test described earlier.
First, we need to establish a hypothesis based on our research question.
Using our scenario of gender and votingpatterns,ournullhypothesisisthatthereisnotasigniﬁcantdifferenceinthefrequencieswithwhichfemales voteforaRepublicanorDemocraticcandidatewhencomparedtomales.
Therefore,ourhypothesescanbestatedas follows: NullHypothesis H :O=E (Thereisnostatisticallysigniﬁcantdifferencebetweentheobservedandexpectedfrequencies.)
0 AlternativeHypothesis H :O(cid:54)=E (Thereisastatisticallysigniﬁcantdifferencebetweentheobservedandexpectedfrequencies.)
a Using the table above, we can calculate the degrees of freedom and the chi-square statistic.
The formula for calculatingthechi-squarestatisticisthesameasbefore: (O−E)2 χ2=∑ E where: χ2 isthechi-squareteststatistic.
O istheobservedfrequencyvalueforeachevent.

According to the table, we see that thecriticalvalueforchi-squareis3.841.
Therefore,wewouldrejectthenullhypothesisifthechi-squarestatisticis greaterthan3.841.
Sinceourcalculatedchi-squarevalueof0.37islessthan3.841,wefailtorejectthenullhypothesis.
Therefore,we can conclude that females are not signiﬁcantly more likely to vote for a Republican or Democratic candidate than males.
Inotherwords,thesetwofactorsappeartobeindependentofoneanother.
TestofHomogeneity Thechi-squaregoodness-of-ﬁttestandthetestofindependencearetwowaystoexaminetherelationshipsbetween categorical variables.
To determine whether or not the assignment of categorical variables is random (that is, to examinetherandomnessofasample),weperformthetestofhomogeneity.
Inotherwords,thetestofhomogeneity testswhethersamplesfrompopulationshavethesameproportionofobservationswithacommoncharacteristic.
For example,wefoundinourlasttestofindependencethatthefactorsofgenderandvotingpatternswereindependentof oneanother.
However,ouroriginalquestionwasiffemalesweremorelikelytovoteforaRepublicanorDemocratic candidatewhencomparedtomales.
Wewouldusethetestofhomogeneitytoexaminetheprobabilitythatchoosing a Republican or Democratic candidate was the same for females and males.
