You are employed by a company as a sales person, and you eventually become the sales manager of a territory.
While attending a sales managers' meeting, financial results are reviewed by the Vice President of Sales and terms such as gross margin percentage, cash flows from operating activities, and LIFO inventory methods are being discussed.
The Vice President eventually asks you to discuss these topics as they relate to your territory.
You try to do so, but it is obvious to everyone in the meeting that you do not know what you are talking about.
Accounting principles courses teach you the "language of business" so you understand terms and concepts used in business decisions.
If you understand how accounting information is prepared, you will be in an even stronger position when faced with a management decision based on accounting information.
The importance of transactions analysis and proper recording of transactions has clearly been demonstrated in some of the recent business failures that have been reported in the press.
If the financial statements of an enterprise are to properly represent the results of operations and the financial condition of the company, the transactions must be analyzed and recorded in the accounts following generally accepted accounting principles.
The debits and credits are important not only to accounting majors but also to those entering or engaged in a business career to become managers because the ultimate effects of these journal entries are reflected in the financial statements.
If expenses are reported as assets, liabilities and their related expenses are omitted from the financial statements, or reported revenues are recorded prematurely or do not really exist, the financial statements are misleading.
The financial statements are only useful and meaningful if they are fair and clearly represent the business events of the company.
We wrote this text to give you an understanding of how to use accounting information to analyze business performance and make business decisions.
The text takes a business perspective.
We use the annual reports of real companies to illustrate many of the accounting concepts.
You are familiar with many of the companies we use, such as The Limited, The Home Depot, and Coca-Cola Company.
Gaining an understanding of accounting terminology and concepts, however, is not enough to ensure your success.
You also need to be able to find information on the Internet, analyze various p. 4 of 433 business situations, work effectively as a member of a team, and communicate your ideas clearly.
This text was developed to help you develop these skills.
Curriculum concerns Significant changes have been recommended for accounting education.
Some parties have expressed concern that recent accounting graduates do not possess the necessary set of skills to succeed in an accounting career.
The typical accounting graduate seems unable to successfully deal with complex and unstructured "real world" accounting problems and generally lacks communication and interpersonal skills.
One recommendation is the greater use of active learning techniques in a re- energized classroom environment.
The traditional lecture and structured problem solving method approach would be supplemented or replaced with a more informal classroom setting dealing with cases, simulations, and group projects.
Both inside and outside the classroom, there would be two-way communication between (1) professor and student and (2) student and student.
Study groups would be formed so that students could tutor other students.
The purposes of these recommendations include enhancing students' critical thinking skills, written and oral communication skills, and interpersonal skills.
One of the most important benefits you can obtain from a college education is that you "learn how to learn".
The concept that you gain all of your learning in school and then spend the rest of your life applying that knowledge is not valid.
Change is occurring at an increasingly rapid pace.
You will probably hold many different jobs during your career, and you will probably work for many different companies.
Much of the information you learn in college will be obsolete in just a few years.
Therefore, you will be expected to engage in life-long learning.
Memorizing is much less important than learning how to think critically.
With this changing environment in mind, we have developed a text that will lend itself to developing the skills that will lead to success in your future career in business.
The section at the end of each chapter titled, "Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking", provides the opportunity for you to address unstructured case situations, the analysis of real companies' financial situations, ethics cases, and team projects.
Each chapter also includes one or two Internet projects in the section titled "Using the Internet—A view of the real world".
For many of these items, you will use written and oral communication skills in presenting your results.
p. 5 of 433 Objectives and overall approach of the eighth edition The Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC) made specific recommendations regarding teaching materials and methods used in the first-year accounting course.
As a result, significant changes have taken place in that course at many universities.
The AECC states: The first course in accounting can significantly benefit those who enter business, government, and other organizations, where decision-makers use accounting information.
These individuals will be better prepared for their responsibilities if they understand the role of accounting information in decision-making by managers, investors, government regulators, and others.
All organizations have accountability responsibilities to their constituents, and accounting, properly used, is a powerful tool in creating information to improve the decisions that affect those constituents.1 One of the purposes of the first course should be to recruit accounting majors.
To help accomplish this, the text has a section preceding each chapter entitled, "Careers in accounting".
We retained a solid coverage of accounting that serves business students well regardless of the majors they select.
Those who choose not to major in accounting, which is a majority of those taking this course, will become better users of accounting information because they will know something about the preparation of that information.
Approach and organization Business emphasis Without actual business experience, business students sometimes lack a frame of reference in attempting to apply accounting concepts to business transactions.
We seek to involve the business student more in real world business applications as we introduce and explain the subject matter.
 "An accounting perspective: Business insight" boxes throughout the text provide examples of how companies featured in text examples use accounting information every day, or they provide other useful information.
1 Accounting Education Change Commission, Position Statement No.
Two, “The First Course in Account” (Torrance, CA, June 1992), pp.
1-2. p. 6 of 433  "Accounting perspective: Uses of technology" boxes throughout the text demonstrate how technology has affected the way accounting information is prepared, manipulated, and accessed.
 Some chapters contain "A broader perspective".
These situations, taken from annual reports of real companies and from articles in current business periodicals such as Accounting Today, and Management Accounting, relate to subject matter discussed in that chapter or present other useful information.
These real world examples demonstrate the business relevance of accounting.
 Real world questions and real world business decision cases are included in almost every chapter.
 The annual report appendix included with this text contains significant portions of the annual report of The Limited, Inc.
Many of the real world questions and business decision cases are based on this annual report.
 Numerous illustrations adapted from Accounting Trends & Techniques show the frequency of use in business of various accounting techniques.
Placed throughout the text, these illustrations give students real world data to consider while learning about different accounting techniques.
 Throughout the text we have included numerous references to the annual reports of many companies.
 Chapters 1-16 contain a section entitled, "Analyzing and using the financial results".
This section discusses and illustrates a ratio or other analysis technique that pertains to the content of the chapter.
For instance, this section in Chapter 4 discusses the current ratio as it relates to a classified balance sheet.
 Some of the chapters contain end-of-chapter questions, exercises, or business decision cases that require the student to refer to the Annual report appendix and answer certain questions.
As stated earlier, this appendix is included with the text and contains the significant portions of the annual report of The Limited, Inc.  Each chapter contains a section entitled, "Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking".
This section contains business decision cases, annual report analysis problems, writing assignments based on the Ethical perspective and Broader perspective boxes, group projects, and Internet projects.
p. 7 of 433 Pedagogy Students often come into accounting principles courses feeling anxious about learning the subject matter.
Recognizing this apprehension, we studied ways to make learning easier and came up with some helpful ideas on how to make this edition work even better for students.
 Improvements in the text's content reflect feedback from adopters, suggestions by reviewers, and a serious study of the learning process itself by the authors and editors.
New subject matter is introduced only after the stage has been set by transitional paragraphs between topic headings.
These paragraphs provide students with the reasons for proceeding to the new material and explain the progression of topics within the chapter.
 The Introduction contains a section entitled "How to study the chapters in this text", which should be very helpful to students.
 Each chapter has an "Understanding the learning objectives" section.
These "summaries" enable the student to determine how well the learning objectives were accomplished.
We were the first authors (1974) to ever include Learning objectives in an accounting text.
These objectives have been included at the beginning of the chapter, as marginal notes within the chapter, at the end of the chapter, and in supplements such as the Test bank, Instructors' resource guide, Computerized test bank, and Study guide.
The objectives are also indicated for each exercise and problem.
 Demonstration problems and solutions are included for each chapter, and a different one appears for each chapter in the Study guide.
These demonstration problems help students to assess their own progress by showing them how problems that focus on the topic(s) covered in the chapter are worked before students do assigned homework problems.
 Key terms are printed for emphasis.
End-of-chapter glossaries contain the definition.
 Each chapter includes a "Self-test" consisting of true-false and multiple-choice questions.
The answers and explanations appear at the end of the chapter.
These self-tests are designed to determine whether the student has learned the essential information in each chapter.
 In the margin beside each exercise and problem, we have included a description of the requirements and the related Learning objective(s).
These descriptions let students know what they are expected to do in the problem.
 Throughout the text we use examples taken from everyday life to relate an accounting concept being introduced or discussed to students' experiences.
p. 8 of 433 Ethics There is no better time to emphasize high ethical standards to students.
This text includes many items throughout the text entitled, "An ethical perspective".
These items present situations in which students are likely to find themselves throughout their careers.
They range from resisting pressure by a superior or a client to do the wrong thing to deciding between alternative corporate behaviors that have environmental and profit consequences.
End-of-chapter materials Describing teaching methods, the AECC stated, "Teachers...should place a priority on their interaction with students and on interaction among students.
Students' involvement should be promoted by methods such as cases, simulations, and group projects..."2 A section entitled "Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking" at the end of every chapter is designed to implement these recommendations.
Business decision cases require critical thinking in complex situations often based on real companies.
The Annual report analysis section requires analyzing annual reports and interpreting the results in writing.
The Ethics cases require students to respond in writing to situations they are likely to encounter in their careers.
These cases do not necessarily have one right answer.
The Group projects for each chapter teach students how to work effectively in teams, a skill that was stressed by the AECC and is becoming increasingly necessary for success in business.
The Internet projects teach students how to retrieve useful information from the Internet.
A team approach can also be introduced in the classroom using the regular exercises and problems in the text.
Teams can be assigned the task of presenting their solutions to exercises or problems to the rest of the class.
Using this team approach in class can help re-energize the classroom by creating an active, informal environment in which students learn from each other.
(Two additional group projects are described in the Instructor's resource guide.
These projects are designed to be used throughout the semester or quarter.)
We have included a vast amount of other resource materials for each chapter within the text from which the instructor may draw: (1) one of the largest selections of end-of-chapter questions, exercises, and problems available; (2) several comprehensive review problems that allow students to review all major concepts covered to that point; and (3) from one to three business decision cases per chapter.
Other key features regarding end-of-chapter material follow.
2Ibid, p.2.
p. 9 of 433  A uniform chart of accounts appears in a separate file you can download.
This uniform chart of accounts is used consistently throughout the first 11 chapters.
We believe students will benefit from using the same chart of accounts for all homework problems in those chapters.
 A comprehensive review problem at the end of Chapter 4 serves as a mini practice set to test all material covered to that point.
Another comprehensive problem at the end of Chapter 19 reviews the material covered in Chapters 18 and 19.
Two comprehensive budgeting problems are also included as business decision cases at the end of Chapter 23.
 Some of the end-of-chapter problem materials (questions, exercises, problems, business decision cases, other "Beyond the numbers" items, and comprehensive review problems) have been updated.
Each exercise and problem is identified with the learning objective(s) to which it relates.
 All end-of-chapter exercises and problems have been traced back to the chapters to ensure that nothing is asked of a student that does not appear in the book.
This feature was a strength of previous editions, ensuring that instructors could confidently assign problems without having to check for applicability.
Also, we took notes while teaching from the text and clarified problem and exercise instructions that seemed confusing to our students.

this introduction, you should be able to:  Define accounting.
 Describe the functions performed by accountants.
 Describe employment opportunities in accounting.
 Differentiate between financial and managerial accounting.
 Identify several organizations that have a role in the development of financial accounting standards.
You have embarked on the challenging and rewarding study of accounting—an old and time- honored discipline.
History indicates that all developed societies require certain accounting records.
Record-keeping in an accounting sense is thought to have begun about 4000 BCE The record-keeping, control, and verification problems of the ancient world had many characteristics similar to those we encounter today.
For example, ancient governments also kept records of receipts and disbursements and used procedures to check on the honesty and reliability of employees.
A study of the evolution of accounting suggests that accounting processes have developed primarily in response to business needs.
Also, economic progress has affected the development of accounting processes.
History shows that the higher the level of civilization, the more elaborate the accounting methods.
The emergence of double-entry bookkeeping was a crucial event in accounting history.
In 1494, a Franciscan monk, Luca Pacioli, described the double-entry Method of Venice system in his text called Summa de Arithmetica, Geometric, Proportion et Proportionate (Everything about arithmetic, geometry, and proportion).
Many consider Pacioli's Summa to be a reworked version of a manuscript that circulated among teachers and pupils of the Venetian school of commerce and arithmetic.
Since Pacioli's days, the roles of accountants and professional accounting organizations have expanded in business and society.
As professionals, accountants have a responsibility for placing public service above their commitment to personal economic gain.
Complementing their obligation to society, accountants have analytical and evaluative skills needed in the solution of ever-growing world p. 14 of 433 problems.
The special abilities of accountants, their independence, and their high ethical standards permit them to make significant and unique contributions to business and areas of public interest.
You probably will find that of all the business knowledge you have acquired or will learn, the study of accounting will be the most useful.
Your financial and economic decisions as a student and consumer involve accounting information.
When you file income tax returns, accounting information helps determine your taxes payable.
Understanding the discipline of accounting also can influence many of your future professional decisions.
You cannot escape the effects of accounting information on your personal and professional life.
Every profit-seeking business organization that has economic resources, such as money, machinery, and buildings, uses accounting information.
For this reason, accounting is called the language of business.
Accounting also serves as the language providing financial information about not-for-profit organizations such as governments, churches, charities, fraternities, and hospitals.
However, this text concentrates on accounting for business firms.
The accounting system of a profit-seeking business is an information system designed to provide relevant financial information on the resources of a business and the effects of their use.
Information is relevant if it has some impact on a decision that must be made.
Companies present this relevant information in their financial statements.
In preparing these statements, accountants consider the users of the information, such as owners and creditors, and decisions they make that require financial information.
As a background for studying accounting, this Introduction defines accounting and lists the functions accountants perform.
In addition to surveying employment opportunities in accounting, it differentiates between financial and managerial accounting.
Because accounting information must conform to certain standards, we discuss several prominent organizations contributing to these standards.
As you continue your study of accounting in this text, accounting—the language of business —will become your language also.
You will realize that you are constantly exposed to accounting information in your everyday life.
1.2 Accounting Defined The American Accounting Association—one of the accounting organizations discussed later in this Introduction—defines accounting as "the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating p. 15 of 433 economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of the information".1 This information is primarily financial—stated in money terms.
Accounting, then, is a measurement and communication process used to report on the activities of profit-seeking business organizations and not-for-profit organizations.
As a measurement and communication process for business, accounting supplies information that permits informed judgments and decisions by users of the data.
The accounting process provides financial data for a broad range of individuals whose objectives in studying the data vary widely.
Bank officials, for example, may study a company's financial statements to evaluate the company's ability to repay a loan.
Prospective investors may compare accounting data from several companies to decide which company represents the best investment.
Accounting also supplies management with significant financial data useful for decision making.
Reliable information is necessary before decision makers can make a sound decision involving the allocation of scarce resources.
Accounting information is valuable because decision makers can use it to evaluate the financial consequences of various alternatives.
Accountants eliminate the need for a crystal ball to estimate the future.
They can reduce uncertainty by using professional judgment to quantify the future financial impact of taking action or delaying action.
Although accounting information plays a significant role in reducing uncertainty within the organization, it also provides financial data for persons outside the company.
This information tells how management has discharged its responsibility for protecting and managing the company's resources.
Stockholders have the right to know how a company is managing its investments.
In fulfilling this obligation, accountants prepare financial statements such as an income statement, a statement of retained earnings, a balance sheet, and a statement of cash flows.
In addition, they prepare tax returns for federal and state governments, as well as fulfill other governmental filing requirements.
Accounting is often confused with bookkeeping.
Bookkeeping is a mechanical process that records the routine economic activities of a business.
Accounting includes bookkeeping but goes well beyond it in scope.
Accountants analyze and interpret financial information, prepare financial statements, conduct audits, design accounting systems, prepare special business and financial studies, prepare forecasts and budgets, and provide tax services.
Specifically the accounting process consists of the following groups of functions (see Exhibit 1 below): 1 American Accounting Association, A Statement of Basic Accounting Theory (Evanston, III., 1966), p. 1. p. 16 of 433  Accountants observe many events (or activities) and identify and measure in financial terms (dollars) those events considered evidence of economic activity.
(Often, these three functions are collectively referred to as analyze.)
The purchase and sale of goods and services are economic events.
 Next, the economic events are recorded, classified into meaningful groups, and summarized.
 Accountants report on economic events (or business activity) by preparing financial statements and special reports.
Often accountants interpret these statements and reports for various groups such as management, investors, and creditors.
Interpretation may involve determining how the business is performing compared to prior years and other similar businesses.
1.3 Employment opportunities in accounting During the last half-century, accounting has gained the same professional status as the medical and legal professions.
Today, the accountants in the United States number well over a million.
In addition, several million people hold accounting-related positions.
Typically, accountants provide services in various branches of accounting.
These include public accounting, management (industrial) accounting, governmental or other not-for-profit accounting, and higher education.
The demand for accountants will likely increase dramatically in the future.
This increase is greater than for any other profession.
You may want to consider accounting as a career.
Public accounting firms offer professional accounting and related services for a fee to companies, other organizations, and individuals.
An accountant may become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) by passing an examination prepared and graded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
The exam is administered by computer.
In addition to passing the exam, CPA candidates must meet other requirements, which include obtaining a state license.
These requirements vary by state.
A number of states require a CPA candidate to have completed specific accounting courses and earned a certain number of college credits (five years of study in many states); worked a certain number of years in public accounting, industry, or government; and lived in that state a certain length of time before taking the CPA examination.
As of the year 2000, five years of course work were required to become a member of the AICPA.
After a candidate passes the CPA examination, some states (called one-tier states) insist that the candidate meet all requirements before the state grants the CPA certificate and license to practice.
Other states (called two-tier states) issue the CPA certificate immediately after the candidate passes the exam.
However, these states issue the license to practice only after all other requirements have been met.
CPAs who want to renew their licenses to practice must stay current through continuing p. 17 of 433 professional education programs and must prove that they have done so.
No one can claim to be a CPA and offer the services normally provided by a CPA unless that person holds an active license to practice.
Exhibit 1: Functions performed by accountants p. 18 of 433 The public accounting profession in the United States consists of the Big-Four international CPA firms, several national firms, many regional firms, and numerous local firms.
The Big-Four firms include Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
At all levels, these public accounting firms provide auditing, tax, and, for nonaudit clients, management advisory (or consulting) services.
Auditing A business seeking a loan or attempting to have its securities traded on a stock exchange usually must provide financial statements to support its request.
Users of a company's financial statements are more confident that the company is presenting its statements fairly when a CPA has audited the statements.
For this reason, companies hire CPA firms to conduct examinations (independent audits) of their accounting and related records.
Independent auditors of the CPA firm check some of the company's records by contacting external sources.
For example, the accountant may contact a bank to verify the cash balances of the client.
After completing a company audit, independent auditors give an independent auditor's opinion or report.
(For an example of an auditor's opinion, see The Limited, Inc. annual report in the Annual report appendix at the end of the text.)
This report states whether the company's financial statements fairly (equitably) report the economic performance and financial condition of the business.
As you will learn in the next section, auditors within a business also conduct audits, which are not independent audits.
Currently auditing standards are established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
In 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed.
The Act was passed as one result of the large losses to the employees and investors from accounting fraud situations involving companies such as Enron and WorldCom.
The Act created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
The Board consists of five members appointed and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Board oversees and investigates the audits and auditors of public companies and can sanction both firms and individuals for violations of laws, regulations, and rules.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of a public company must now certify the company's financial statements.
Corporate audit committees, rather than the corporate management, are now responsible for hiring, compensating, and overseeing the external auditors.
Tax services CPAs often provide expert advice on tax planning and preparing federal, state, and local tax returns.
The objective in preparing tax returns is to use legal means to minimize the taxes paid.
Almost every major business decision has a tax impact.
Tax planning helps clients know the tax effects of each financial decision.
Management advisory (or consulting) services Before Sarbanes-Oxley management advisory services were the fastest growing service area for most large and many smaller CPA firms.
Management p. 19 of 433 frequently identifies projects for which it decides to retain the services of a CPA.
However, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act specifically prohibits providing certain types of consulting services to a publicly- held company by its external auditor.
These services include bookkeeping, information systems design and implementation, appraisals or valuation services, actuarial services, internal audits, management and human resources services, broker/dealer and investment services, and legal or expert services related to audit services.
Accounting firms can perform many of these services for publicly held companies they do not audit.
Other services not specifically banned are allowed if pre-approved by the company's audit committee.
In contrast to public accountants, who provide accounting services for many clients, management accountants provide accounting services for a single business.
In a company with several management accountants, the person in charge of the accounting activity is often the controller or chief financial officer.
Management accountants may or may not be CPAs.
If management accountants pass an examination prepared and graded by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants (ICMA) and meet certain other requirements, they become Certified Management Accountants (CMAs).
The ICMA is an affiliate of the Institute of Management Accountants, an organization primarily consisting of management accountants employed in private industry.
A career in management accounting can be very challenging and rewarding.
Many management accountants specialize in one particular area of accounting.
For example, some may specialize in measuring and controlling costs, others in budgeting (the development of plans for future operations), and still others in financial accounting and reporting.
Many management accountants become specialists in the design and installation of computerized accounting systems.
Other management accountants are internal auditors who conduct internal audits.
They ensure that the company's divisions and departments follow the policies and procedures of management.
This last group of management accountants may earn the designation of Certified Internal Auditor (CIA).
The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) grants the CIA certificate to accountants after they have successfully completed the IIA examination and met certain other requirements.
Many accountants, including CPAs, work in governmental and other not-for-profit accounting.
They have essentially the same educational background and training as accountants in public accounting and management accounting.
Governmental agencies at the federal, state, and local levels employ governmental accountants.
Often the duties of these accountants relate to tax revenues and expenditures.
For example, Internal Revenue Service employees use their accounting backgrounds in reviewing tax returns and p. 20 of 433 investigating tax fraud.
Government agencies that regulate business activity, such as a state public service commission that regulates public utilities (e.g.
telephone company, electric company), usually employ governmental accountants.
These agencies often employ governmental accountants who can review and evaluate the utilities' financial statements and rate increase requests.
Also, FBI agents trained as accountants find their accounting backgrounds useful in investigating criminals involved in illegal business activities, such as drugs or gambling.
Not-for-profit organizations, such as churches, charities, fraternities, and universities, need accountants to record and account for funds received and disbursed.
Even though these agencies do not have a profit motive, they should operate efficiently and use resources effectively.
Approximately 10,000 accountants are employed in higher education.
The activities of these academic accountants include teaching accounting courses, conducting scholarly and applied research and publishing the results, and performing service for the institution and the community.
Faculty positions exist in two-year colleges, four-year colleges, and universities with graduate programs.
A significant shortage of accounting faculty has developed due to the retirement beginning in the late 1990s of many faculty members.
Starting salaries will continue to rise significantly because of the shortage.
You may want to talk with some of your professors about the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing an accounting career in higher education.
A section preceding each chapter, entitled "Careers in accounting", describes various accounting careers.
You might find one that you would like to pursue.
1.4 Financial accounting versus managerial accounting An accounting information system provides data to help decision makers both outside and inside the business.
Decision makers outside the business are affected in some way by the performance of the business.
Decision makers inside the business are responsible for the performance of the business.
For this reason, accounting is divided into two categories: financial accounting for those outside and managerial accounting for those inside.
Financial accounting information appears in financial statements that are intended primarily for external use (although management also uses them for certain internal decisions).
Stockholders and creditors are two of the outside parties who need financial accounting information.
These outside parties decide on matters pertaining to the entire company, such as whether to increase or decrease their investment in a company or to extend credit to a company.
Consequently, financial accounting information relates to the company as a whole, while managerial accounting focuses on the parts or segments of the company.
p. 21 of 433 Management accountants in a company prepare the financial statements.
Thus, management accountants must be knowledgeable concerning financial accounting and reporting.
The financial statements are the representations of management, not the CPA firm that performs the audit.
The external users of accounting information fall into six groups; each has different interests in the company and wants answers to unique questions.
The groups and some of their possible questions are:  Owners and prospective owners.
Has the company earned satisfactory income on its total investment?
Should an investment be made in this company?
Should the present investment be increased, decreased, or retained at the same level?
Can the company install costly pollution control equipment and still be profitable?
 Creditors and lenders.
Should a loan be granted to the company?
Will the company be able to pay its debts as they become due?
 Employees and their unions.
Does the company have the ability to pay increased wages?
Is the company financially able to provide long-term employment for its workforce?
 Customers.
Does the company offer useful products at fair prices?
Will the company survive long enough to honor its product warranties?
 Governmental units.
Is the company, such as a local public utility, charging a fair rate for its services?
 General public.
Is the company providing useful products and gainful employment for citizens without causing serious environmental problems?
General-purpose financial statements provide much of the information needed by external users of financial accounting.
These financial statements are formal reports providing information on a company's financial position, cash inflows and outflows, and the results of operations.
Many companies publish these statements in annual reports.
(See The Limited, Inc., annual report in the Annual report appendix.)
The annual report also contains the independent auditor's opinion as to the fairness of the financial statements, as well as information about the company's activities, products, and plans.
Financial accounting information is historical in nature, reporting on what has happened in the past.
To facilitate comparisons between companies, this information must conform to certain accounting standards or principles called generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
These generally accepted accounting principles for businesses or governmental organizations have developed through accounting practice or been established by an authoritative organization.
We describe several of these authoritative organizations in the next major section of this Introduction.
p. 22 of 433 Managerial accounting information is for internal use and provides special information for the managers of a company.
The information managers use may range from broad, long-range planning data to detailed explanations of why actual costs varied from cost estimates.
Managerial accounting information should:  Relate to the part of the company for which the manager is responsible.
For example, a production manager wants information on costs of production but not of advertising.
 Involve planning for the future.
For instance, a budget would show financial plans for the coming year.
 Meet two tests: the accounting information must be useful (relevant) and must not cost more to gather and process than it is worth.
Managerial accounting generates information that managers can use to make sound decisions.
The four major types of internal management decisions are:  Financial decisions—deciding what amounts of capital (funds) are needed to run the business and whether to secure these funds from owners (stockholders) or creditors.
In this sense, capital means money used by the company to purchase resources such as machinery and buildings and to pay expenses of conducting the business.
 Resource allocation decisions—deciding how the total capital of a company is to be invested, such as the amount to be invested in machinery.
 Production decisions—deciding what products are to be produced, by what means, and when.
 Marketing decisions—setting selling prices and advertising budgets; determining the location of a company's markets and how to reach them.
1.5 Development of financial accounting standards Several organizations are influential in the establishment of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for businesses or governmental organizations.
These are the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the American Accounting Association, the Financial Executives Institute, and the Institute of Management Accountants.
Each organization has contributed in a different way to the development of GAAP.
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is a professional organization of CPAs.
Many of these CPAs are in public accounting practice.
Until recent years, the AICPA was the dominant organization in the development of accounting standards.
In a 20-year period ending in p. 23 of 433 1959, the AICPA Committee on Accounting Procedure issued 51 Accounting Research Bulletins recommending certain principles or practices.
From 1959 through 1973, the committee's successor, the Accounting Principles Board (APB), issued 31 numbered Opinions that CPAs generally are required to follow.
Through its monthly magazine, the Journal of Accountancy, its research division, and its other divisions and committees, the AICPA continues to influence the development of accounting standards and practices.
Two of its committees—the Accounting Standards Committee and the Auditing Standards Committee—are particularly influential in providing input to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the current rule-making body) and to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies.
In 1973, an independent, seven-member, full-time Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) replaced the Accounting Principles Board.
The FASB has issued numerous Statements of Financial Accounting Standards.
The old Accounting Research Bulletins and Accounting Principles Board Opinions are still effective unless specifically superseded by a Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement.
The FASB is the private sector organization now responsible for the development of new financial accounting standards.
The Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB interprets official pronouncements for general application by accounting practitioners.
The conclusions of this task force must also be followed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In 1984, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) was established with a full-time chairperson and four part-time members.
The GASB issues statements on accounting and financial reporting in the governmental area.
This organization is the private sector organization now responsible for the development of new governmental accounting concepts and standards.
The GASB also has the authority to issue interpretations of these standards.
Created under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a government agency that administers important acts dealing with the interstate sale of securities (stocks and bonds).
The SEC has the authority to prescribe accounting and reporting practices for companies under its jurisdiction.
This includes virtually every major US business corporation.
Instead of exercising this power, the SEC has adopted a policy of working closely with the accounting profession, especially the FASB, in the development of accounting standards.
The SEC indicates to the FASB the accounting topics it believes the FASB should address.
Consisting largely of accounting educators, the American Accounting Association (AAA) has sought to encourage research and study at a theoretical level into the concepts, standards, and principles of accounting.
One of its quarterly magazines, The Accounting Review, carries many articles p. 24 of 433 reporting on scholarly accounting research.
Another quarterly journal, Accounting Horizons, reports on more practical matters directly related to accounting practice.
A third journal, Issues in Accounting Education, contains articles relating to accounting education matters.
Students may join the AAA as associate members by contacting the American Accounting Association, 5717 Bessie Drive, Sarasota, Florida 34233.
The Financial Executives Institute is an organization established in 1931 whose members are primarily financial policy-making executives.
Many of its members are chief financial officers (CFOs) of very large corporations.
The role of the CFO has evolved in recent years from number cruncher to strategic planner.
These CFOs played a major role in restructuring American businesses in the early 1990s.
Slightly more than 14,000 financial officers, representing approximately 7,000 companies in the United States and Canada, are members of the FEI.
Through its Committee on Corporate Reporting (CCR) and other means, the FEI is very effective in representing the views of the private financial sector to the FASB and to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies.
The Institute of Management Accountants (formerly the National Association of Accountants) is an organization with approximately 70,000 members, consisting of management accountants in private industry, CPAs, and academics.
The primary focus of the organization is on the use of management accounting information for internal decision making.
However, management accountants prepare the financial statements for external users.
Thus, through its Management Accounting Practices (MAP) Committee and other means, the IMA provides input on financial accounting standards to the Financial Accounting Standards Board and to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies.
Many other organizations such as the Financial Analysts Federation (composed of investment advisers and investors), the Securities Industry Associates (composed of investment bankers), and CPA firms have committees or task forces that respond to Exposure Drafts of proposed FASB Statements.
Their reactions are in the form of written statements sent to the FASB and testimony given at FASB hearings.
Many individuals also make their reactions known to the FASB.
1.6 Ethical behavior of accountants Several accounting organizations have codes of ethics governing the behavior of their members.
For instance, both the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Institute of Management Accountants have formulated such codes.
Many business firms have also developed codes of ethics for their employees to follow.
p. 25 of 433 Ethical behavior involves more than merely making sure you are not violating a code of ethics.
Most of us sense what is right and wrong.
Yet get-rich-quick opportunities can tempt many of us.
Almost any day, newspaper headlines reveal public officials and business leaders who did not do the right thing.
Greed won out over their sense of right and wrong.
These individuals followed slogans such as: "Get yours while the getting is good"; "Do unto others before they do unto you"; and "You have done wrong only if you get caught".
More appropriate slogans might be: "If it seems too good to be true, it usually is"; "There are no free lunches"; and the golden rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".
An accountant's most valuable asset is an honest reputation.
Those who take the high road of ethical behavior receive praise and honor; they are sought out for their advice and services.
They also like themselves and what they represent.
Occasionally, accountants do take the low road and suffer the consequences.
They sometimes find their names mentioned in The Wall Street Journal and news programs in an unfavorable light, and former friends and colleagues look down on them.
Some of these individuals are removed from the profession.
Fortunately, the accounting profession has many leaders who have taken the high road, gained the respect of friends and colleagues, and become role models for all of us to follow.
Many chapters in the text include an ethics case entitled, "An ethical perspective".
We know you will benefit from thinking about the situational ethics in these cases.
Often you will not have much difficulty in determining "right and wrong".
Instead of making the cases "close calls", we have attempted to include situations business students might actually encounter in their careers.
1.7 Critical thinking and communication skills Accountants in practice and business executives have generally been dissatisfied with accounting graduates' ability to think critically and to communicate their ideas effectively.
The Accounting Education Change Commission has recommended that changes be made in the education of accountants to remove these complaints.
To address these concerns, we have included a section at the end of each chapter entitled, "Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking".
In that section, you are required to work relatively unstructured business decision cases, analyze real-world annual report data, write about situations involving ethics, and participate in group projects.
Most of the other end-of-chapter materials also involve analysis and written communication of ideas.
In some of the cases, (analysis, ethics situations, and group projects), you are asked to write a memorandum regarding the situation.
In writing such a memorandum, identify your role (auditor, p. 26 of 433 consultant), the audience (management, stockholders, and creditors), and the task (the specific assignment).
Present your ideas clearly and concisely.
The purpose of the group projects is to assist you in learning to listen to and work with others.
These skills are important in succeeding in the business world.
Team players listen to the views of others and work cohesively with them to achieve group goals.
1.8 Internet skills The Internet is a fact of life.
It is important for accountants and students to be able to use the Internet to find relevant information.
Thus, each chapter contains approximately two Internet projects related to accounting.
Your instructor might assign some of these, or you could pursue them on your own.
1.9 How to study the chapters in this text In studying each chapter:  Begin by reading the learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter.
 Read "Understanding the learning objectives" at the end of the chapter for a preview of the chapter content.
 Read the chapter content.
Each exercise at the end of the chapters identifies the learning objective(s) to which it pertains.
If you learn best by reading about a concept and then working a short exercise that illustrates that concept, work the exercises as you read the chapter.
 Reread "Understanding the learning objectives" to determine if you have achieved each objective.
 Study the Key terms to see if you understand each term.
If you do not understand a certain term, refer to the page indicated to read about the term in its original context.
 Take the Self-test and then check your answers with those at the end of the chapter.
 Work the Demonstration problem to further reinforce your understanding of the chapter content.
Then, compare your solution to the correct solution that follows immediately.
 Look over the questions at the end of the chapter and think out an answer to each one.
If you cannot answer a particular question, refer back into the chapter for the needed information.
 Work at least some of the exercises at the end of the chapter.
 Work the Problems assigned by your instructor, using the forms available.
They can be downloaded from the publisher's website (www.freeloadpress.com).
p. 27 of 433  Study the items in the "Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking" section and the "Using the Internet—A view of the real world" section at the end of each chapter to relate what you have learned to real-world situations.
 Work the Study guide for the chapter.
The Study guide is a supplement that contains (for each chapter) Learning objectives; Demonstration problem and solution (different from the one in the text); Matching, Completion, True-false, and Multiple-choice questions; and Solutions to all questions and exercises in the study guide.
The Study guide can be downloaded from the publisher's website (www.freeloadpress.com).
If you perform each of these steps for each chapter, you should do well in the course.
Remember that a knowledge of accounting will serve you well regardless of the career you pursue.
International accounting standards In recent years, there has been a movement to develop a single set of global accounting standards for use around the world.
Proponents of this movement say that it will boost cross-border investment, deepen international capital markets and save multinational companies, who must currently report under multiple systems, a lot of time and money.
The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) Foundation was established as an independent, not-for profit, private sector organisation to work towards this goal.
It seeks to develop a globally accepted set of financial reporting standards (IFRSs) under the direction of its standards-setting body, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The AICPA (as well as the other entities mentioned above) supports this effort and, as of early 2010, states on its website that: “The growing acceptance of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as a basis for U.S. financial reporting represents a fundamental change for the U.S. accounting profession.
Today approximately 113 countries require or allow the use of IFRS for the preparation of financial statements by publicly held companies.
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been taking steps to set a date to allow U.S. public companies to use IFRS, and perhaps make its adoption mandatory.
In fact, on November 14, 2008, the SEC released for public comment a proposed roadmap with a timeline and key milestones for adopting IFRS beginning in 2014”.
Clearly, many new issues can emerge between now and 2014, but the direction seems to be clear.
The AICPA has a link on its website to a page with current p. 28 of 433 information on the planned migration to IFRS.
You might like to check it out from time to time at http://www.ifrs.com/Backgrounder_Get_Ready.html.
There is also a wealth of information on the IFRS website at http://ifrs.org.
Students from countries other than the US should check the website of the professional accounting organization in your country for an update on the current status.
For example, if you go to the website of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at http://icai.org and search on IFRS you will find a number of links to documents covering the planned migration to IFRS in India.
p. 29 of 433  2 Accounting and its use in business decisions 2.1 Learning objectives  Identify and describe the three basic forms of business organizations.
 Distinguish among the three types of activities performed by business organizations.
 Describe the content and purposes of the income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.
 State the basic accounting equation and describe its relationship to the balance sheet.
 Using the underlying assumptions or concepts, analyze business transactions and determine their effects on items in the financial statements.
 Prepare an income statement, a statement of retained earnings, and a balance sheet.
 Analyze and use the financial results—the equity ratio.
2.2 A career as an entrepreneur When today’s college students are polled about their long-term career choice, a surprisingly large number respond that they wish to someday own and manage their own business.
In fact, the aspiration to start a business, to be an entrepreneur, is nearly universal.
It is widely acknowledged that a degree in accounting offers many advantages to a would-be entrepreneur.
In fact, if you ask owners of small businesses which skill they wish they had more expertise in, they will very frequently reply “accounting”.
No matter what the business may be, the owner and/or manager must be able to understand the accounting and financial consequences of business decisions.
Most successful entrepreneurs have learned that it takes a lot more than a great marketing idea or product innovation to make a successful business.
There are many steps involved before an idea becomes a successful and rewarding business.
Entrepreneurs must be able to raise capital, either from banks or investors.
Once a business has been launched, the entrepreneur must be a manager—a manager of people, inventory, facilities, customer relationships, and relationships with the very banks and investors that provided the capital.
Business owners quickly learn that in order to survive they need to be well-rounded, savvy individuals who can successfully manage these diverse relationships.
An accounting education is ideal for providing this versatile background.
In addition to providing a good foundation for entrepreneurship in any business, an accounting degree offers other ways of building your own business.
For example, a large percentage of public accountants work as sole proprietors—building and managing their own professional practice.
This can p. 30 of 433 be a very rewarding career, working closely with individuals and small businesses.
One advantage of this career is that you can establish your practice in virtually any location ranging from large cities to rural settings.
Finally, many accountants who have gained specialized expertise and experience in a particular field start their own practice as consultants.
Expertise such as this, which may be in a field outside of traditional accounting practice, can generate billing rates well in the excess of USD 100 an hour.
The introduction to this text provided a background for your study of accounting.
Now you are ready to learn about the forms of business organizations and the types of business activities they perform.
This chapter presents the financial statements used by businesses.
These financial statements show the results of decisions made by management.
Investors, creditors, and managers use these statements in evaluating management’s past decisions and as a basis for making future decisions.
In this chapter, you also study the accounting process (or accounting cycle) that accountants use to prepare those financial statements.
This accounting process uses financial data such as the records of sales made to customers and purchases made from suppliers.
In a systematic manner, accountants analyze, record, classify, summarize, and finally report these data in the financial statements of businesses.
As you study this chapter, you will begin to understand the unique, systematic nature of accounting—the language of business.
2.3 Forms of business organizations Accountants frequently refer to a business organization as an accounting entity or a business entity.
A business entity is any business organization, such as a hardware store or grocery store, that exists as an economic unit.
For accounting purposes, each business organization or entity has an existence separate from its owner(s), creditors, employees, customers, and other businesses.1 This separate existence of the business organization is known as the business entity concept.
Thus, in the accounting records of the business entity, the activities of each business should be kept separate from the activities of other businesses and from the personal financial activities of the owner(s).
Assume, for example, that you own two businesses, a physical fitness center and a horse stable.
According to the business entity concept, you would consider each business as an independent business unit.
Thus, you would normally keep separate accounting records for each business.
Now 1 When first studying any discipline, students encounter new terms.
Usually these terms are set in bold.
The boldface color terms are also listed and defined at the end of each chapter (see Key terms).
p. 31 of 433 assume your physical fitness center is unprofitable because you are not charging enough for the use of your exercise equipment.
You can determine this fact because you are treating your physical fitness center and horse stable as two separate business entities.
You must also keep your personal financial activities separate from your two businesses.
Therefore, you cannot include the car you drive only for personal use as a business activity of your physical fitness center or your horse stable.
However, the use of your truck to pick up feed for your horse stable is a business activity of your horse stable.
As you will see shortly, the business entity concept applies to the three forms of businesses—single proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations.
Thus, for accounting purposes, all three business forms are separate from other business entities and from their owner(s).
Since most large businesses are corporations, we use the corporate approach in this text and include only a brief discussion of single proprietorships and partnerships.
A single proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by an individual and often managed by that same person.
Single proprietors include physicians, lawyers, electricians, and other people in business for themselves.
Many small service businesses and retail establishments are also single proprietorships.
No legal formalities are necessary to organize such businesses, and usually business operations can begin with only a limited investment.
In a single proprietorship, the owner is solely responsible for all debts of the business.
For accounting purposes, however, the business is a separate entity from the owner.
Thus, single proprietors must keep the financial activities of the business, such as the receipt of fees from selling services to the public, separate from their personal financial activities.
For example, owners of single proprietorships should not enter the cost of personal houses or car payments in the financial records of their businesses.
A partnership is an unincorporated business owned by two or more persons associated as partners.
Often the same persons who own the business also manage the business.
Many small retail establishments and professional practices, such as dentists, physicians, attorneys, and many CPA firms, are partnerships.
A partnership begins with a verbal or written agreement.
A written agreement is preferable because it provides a permanent record of the terms of the partnership.
These terms include the initial investment of each partner, the duties of each partner, the means of dividing profits or losses between the partners each year, and the settlement after the death or withdrawal of a partner.
Each partner may be held liable for all the debts of the partnership and for the actions of each partner within the scope of the business.
However, as with the single proprietorship, for accounting purposes, the partnership is a separate business entity.
p. 32 of 433 A corporation is a business incorporated under the laws of a state and owned by a few stockholders or thousands of stockholders.
Almost all large businesses and many small businesses are incorporated.
The corporation is unique in that it is a separate legal business entity.
The owners of the corporation are stockholders, or shareholders.
They buy shares of stock, which are units of ownership, in the corporation.
Should the corporation fail, the owners would only lose the amount they paid for their stock.
The corporate form of business protects the personal assets of the owners from the creditors of the corporation.2 Stockholders do not directly manage the corporation.
They elect a board of directors to represent their interests.
The board of directors selects the officers of the corporation, such as the president and vice presidents, who manage the corporation for the stockholders.
Accounting is necessary for all three forms of business organizations, and each company must follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Since corporations have such an important impact on our economy, we use them in this text to illustrate basic accounting principles and concepts.
An accounting perspective: Business insight Although corporations constitute about 17 per cent of all business organizations, they account for almost 90 per cent of all sales volume.
Single proprietorships constitute about 75 per cent of all business organizations but account for less than 10 per cent of sales volume.
2.4 Types of activities performed by business organizations The forms of business entities discussed in the previous section are classified according to the type of ownership of the business entity.
Business entities can also be grouped by the type of business activities they perform—service companies, merchandising companies, and manufacturing companies.
Any of these activities can be performed by companies using any of the three forms of business organizations.
2 When individuals seek a bank loan to finance the formation of a small corporation, the bank often requires those individuals to sign documents making them personally responsible for repaying the loan if the corporation cannot pay.
In this instance, the individuals can lose their original investments plus the amount of the loan they are obligated to repay.
p. 33 of 433  Service companies perform services for a fee.
This group includes accounting firms, law firms, and dry cleaning establishments.
The early chapters of this text describe accounting for service companies.
 Merchandising companies purchase goods that are ready for sale and then sell them to customers.
Merchandising companies include auto dealerships, clothing stores, and supermarkets.
We begin the description of accounting for merchandising companies in Chapter 6.
 Manufacturing companies buy materials, convert them into products, and then sell the products to other companies or to the final consumers.
Manufacturing companies include steel mills, auto manufacturers, and clothing manufacturers.
All of these companies produce financial statements as the final end product of their accounting process.
These financial statements provide relevant financial information both to those inside the company—management—and to those outside the company—creditors, stockholders, and other interested parties.
The next section introduces four common financial statements—the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows.
2.5 Financial statements of business organizations Business entities may have many objectives and goals.
For example, one of your objectives in owning a physical fitness center may be to improve your physical fitness.
However, the two primary objectives of every business are profitability and solvency.
Profitability is the ability to generate income.
Solvency is the ability to pay debts as they become due.
Unless a business can produce satisfactory income and pay its debts as they become due, the business cannot survive to realize its other objectives.
There are four basic financial statements.
Together they present the profitability and strength of a company.
The financial statement that reflects a company’s profitability is the income statement.
The statement of retained earnings shows the change in retained earnings between the beginning and end of a period (e.g.
a month or a year).
The balance sheet reflects a company’s solvency and financial position.
The statement of cash flows shows the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period of time.
The headings and elements of each statement are similar from company to company.
You can see this similarity in the financial statements of actual companies in the appendix of this textbook.
The income statement, sometimes called an earnings statement, reports the profitability of a business organization for a stated period of time.
In accounting, we measure profitability for a period, p. 34 of 433 such as a month or year, by comparing the revenues earned with the expenses incurred to produce these revenues.
Revenues are the inflows of assets (such as cash) resulting from the sale of products or the rendering of services to customers.
We measure revenues by the prices agreed on in the exchanges in which a business delivers goods or renders services.
Expenses are the costs incurred to produce revenues.
Expenses are measured by the assets surrendered or consumed in serving customers.
If the revenues of a period exceed the expenses of the same period, net income results.
Thus, Net income = Revenues – Expenses Net income is often called the earnings of the company.
When expenses exceed revenues, the business has a net loss, and it has operated unprofitably.
In Exhibit 2, Part A shows the income statement of Metro Courier, Inc., for July 2010.
This corporation performs courier delivery services of documents and packages in San Diego in the state of California, USA.
Metro’s income statement for the month ended 2010 July 31, shows that the revenues (or delivery fees) generated by serving customers for July totaled USD 5,700.
Expenses for the month amounted to USD 3,600.
As a result of these business activities, Metro’s net income for July was USD 2,100.
To determine its net income, the company subtracts its expenses of USD 3,600 from its revenues of USD 5,700.
Even though corporations are taxable entities, we ignore corporate income taxes at this point.
One purpose of the statement of retained earnings is to connect the income statement and the balance sheet.
The statement of retained earnings explains the changes in retained earnings between two balance sheet dates.
These changes usually consist of the addition of net income (or deduction of net loss) and the deduction of dividends.
Dividends are the means by which a corporation rewards its stockholders (owners) for providing it with investment funds.
A dividend is a payment (usually of cash) to the owners of the business; it is a distribution of income to owners rather than an expense of doing business.
Corporations are not required to pay dividends and, because dividends are not an expense, they do not appear on the income statement.
The effect of a dividend is to reduce cash and retained earnings by the amount paid out.
Then, the company no longer retains a portion of the income earned but passes it on to the stockholders.
Receiving dividends is, of course, one of the primary reasons people invest in corporations.
The statement of retained earnings for Metro Courier, Inc., for July 2010 is relatively simple (see Part B of Exhibit 2).
Organized on June 1, Metro did not earn any revenues or incur any expenses during June.
So Metro’s beginning retained earnings balance on July 1 is zero.
Metro then adds its USD p. 35 of 433 2,100 net income for July.
Since Metro paid no dividends in July, the USD 2,100 would be the ending balance of retained earnings.
See below.

If there had been a net loss, it would have deducted the loss from the beginning balance on the statement of retained earnings.
For instance, if during the next month (August) there is a net loss of p. 36 of 433 USD 500, the loss would be deducted from the beginning balance in retained earnings of USD 2,100.
The retained earnings balance at the end of August would be USD 1,600.
Dividends could also have affected the Retained Earnings balance.
To give a more realistic illustration, assume that (1) Metro Courier, Inc.’s net income for August was actually USD 1,500 (revenues of USD 5,600 less expenses of USD 4,100) and (2) the company declared and paid dividends of USD 1,000.
Then, Metro’s statement of retained earnings for August would be: METRO COURIER, INC.
Statement of Retained Earnings For the Month Ended 2010 August 31 Retained earnings, August 1.......................... $2,100 Add: Net income for August..................... 1,500 Total.......................................... $3,600 Less: Dividends................................... 1,000 Retained earnings, August 31........................ $2,600 The balance sheet, sometimes called the statement of financial position, lists the company’s assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity (including dollar amounts) as of a specific moment in time.
That specific moment is the close of business on the date of the balance sheet.
Notice how the heading of the balance sheet differs from the headings on the income statement and statement of retained earnings.
A balance sheet is like a photograph; it captures the financial position of a company at a particular point in time.
The other two statements are for a period of time.
As you study about the assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity contained in a balance sheet, you will understand why this financial statement provides information about the solvency of the business.
Assets are things of value owned by the business.
They are also called the resources of the business.
Examples include cash, machines, and buildings.
Assets have value because a business can use or exchange them to produce the services or products of the business.
In Part C of Exhibit 2 the assets of Metro Courier, Inc., amount to USD 38,700.
Metro’s assets consist of cash, accounts receivable (amounts due from customers for services previously rendered), trucks, and office equipment.
Liabilities are the debts owed by a business.
Typically, a business must pay its debts by certain dates.
A business incurs many of its liabilities by purchasing items on credit.
Metro’s liabilities consist of accounts payable (amounts owed to suppliers for previous purchases) and notes payable (written promises to pay a specific sum of money) totaling USD 6,600.3 3 Most notes bear interest, but in this chapter we assume that all notes bear no interest.
Interest is an amount paid by the borrower to the lender (in addition to the amount of the loan) for use of the money over time.
p. 37 of 433 Metro Courier, Inc., is a corporation.
The owners’ interest in a corporation is referred to as stockholders’ equity.
Metro’s stockholders’ equity consists of (1) USD 30,000 paid for shares of capital stock and (2) retained earnings of USD 2,100.
Capital stock shows the amount of the owners’ investment in the corporation.
Retained earnings generally consists of the accumulated net income of the corporation minus dividends distributed to stockholders.
We discuss these items later in the text.
At this point, simply note that the balance sheet heading includes the name of the organization and the title and date of the statement.
Notice also that the dollar amount of the total assets is equal to the claims on (or interest in) those assets.
The balance sheet shows these claims under the heading “Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity”.
Management is interested in the cash inflows to the company and the cash outflows from the company because these determine the company’s cash it has available to pay its bills when due.
The statement of cash flows shows the cash inflows and cash outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities.
Operating activities generally include the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income.
Investing activities generally include business transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of long-term assets such as land, buildings, and equipment.
Financing activities generally include the cash effects of transactions and other events involving creditors and owners (stockholders).
Chapter 16 describes the statement of cash flows in detail.
Our purpose here is to merely introduce this important financial statement.
Normally, a firm prepares a statement of cash flows for the same time period as the income statement.
The following statement, however, shows the cash inflows and outflows for Metro Courier, Inc., since it was formed on 2010 June 1.
Thus, this cash flow statement is for two months.
METRO COURIER, INC.
Statement of Cash Flows For the Two-Month Period Ended 2010 July 31 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income.......................................................................... $2.100 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Increase in accounts receivable......................................

We do not ask you to prepare such a statement until you have studied Chapter 16.
The income statement, the statement of retained earnings, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows of Metro Courier, Inc., show the results of management’s past decisions.
They are the end products of the accounting process, which we explain in the next section.
These financial statements give a picture of the solvency and profitability of the company.
The accounting process details how this picture was made.
Management and other interested parties use these statements to make future decisions.
Management is the first to know the financial results; then, it publishes the financial statements to inform other users.
The most recent financial statements for most companies can be found on their websites under “Investor Relations” or some similar heading.
2.6 The financial accounting process In this section, we explain the accounting equation—the framework for the entire accounting process.
Then, we show you how to recognize a business transaction and describe underlying assumptions that accountants use to record business transactions.
Next you learn how to analyze and record business transactions.
In the balance sheet presented in Exhibit 2 (Part C), the total assets of Metro Courier, Inc., were equal to its total liabilities and stockholders’ equity.
This equality shows that the assets of a business are equal to its equities; that is, Assets = Equities Assets were defined earlier as the things of value owned by the business, or the economic resources of the business.
Equities are all claims to, or interests in, assets.
For example, assume that you purchased a new company automobile for USD 15,000 by investing USD 10,000 in your own corporation and borrowing USD 5,000 in the name of the corporation from a bank.
Your equity in the automobile is USD 10,000, and the bank’s equity is USD 5,000.
You can further describe the USD 5,000 as a liability because you owe the bank USD 5,000.
If you are a corporation, you can describe your USD 10,000 equity as stockholders’ equity or interest in the asset.
Since the owners in a corporation are stockholders, the basic accounting equation becomes: Assets A = Liabilities L + Stockholders’ Equity SE From Metro’s balance sheet in Exhibit 2 (Part C), we can enter in the amount of its assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity: p. 39 of 433 A = L + SE USD 38,700 = USD 6,600 + USD 32,100 Remember that someone must provide assets or resources—either a creditor or a stockholder.
Therefore, this equation must always be in balance.
You can also look at the right side of this equation in another manner.
The liabilities and stockholders’ equity show the sources of an existing group of assets.
Thus, liabilities are not only claims against assets but also sources of assets.
Together, creditors and owners provide all the assets in a corporation.
The higher the proportion of assets provided by owners, the more solvent the company.
However, companies can sometimes improve their profitability by borrowing from creditors and using the funds effectively.
As a business engages in economic activity, the dollar amounts and composition of its assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity change.
However, the equality of the basic accounting equation always holds.
An accounting transaction is a business activity or event that causes a measurable change in the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ equity.
An exchange of cash for merchandise is a transaction.
The exchange takes place at an agreed price that provides an objective measure of economic activity.
For example, the objective measure of the exchange may be USD 5,000.
These two factors—evidence and measurement—make possible the recording of a transaction.
Merely placing an order for goods is not a recordable transaction because no exchange has taken place.
A source document usually supports the evidence of the transaction.
A source document is any written or printed evidence of a business transaction that describes the essential facts of that transaction.
Examples of source documents are receipts for cash paid or received, checks written or received, bills sent to customers for services performed or bills received from suppliers for items purchased, cash register tapes, sales tickets, and notes given or received.
We handle source documents constantly in our everyday life.
Each source document initiates the process of recording a transaction.
2.7 Underlying assumptions or concepts In recording business transactions, accountants rely on certain underlying assumptions or concepts.
Both preparers and users of financial statements must understand these assumptions:  Business entity concept (or accounting entity concept).
Data gathered in an accounting system relates to a specific business unit or entity.
The business entity concept assumes that each business has an existence separate from its owners, creditors, employees, customers, other interested parties, and other businesses.
p. 40 of 433  Money measurement concept.
Economic activity is initially recorded and reported in a common monetary unit of measure—the dollar in the United States.
This form of measurement is known as money measurement.
 Exchange-price (or cost) concept (principle).
Most of the amounts in an accounting system are the objective money prices determined in the exchange process.
As a result, we record most assets at their acquisition cost.
Cost is the sacrifice made or the resources given up, measured in money terms, to acquire some desired thing, such as a new truck (asset).
 Going-concern (continuity) concept.
Unless strong evidence exists to the contrary, accountants assume that the business entity will continue operations into the indefinite future.
Accountants call this assumption the going-concern or continuity concept.
Assuming that the entity will continue indefinitely allows accountants to value long-term assets, such as land, at cost on the balance sheet since they are to be used rather than sold.
Market values of these assets would be relevant only if they were for sale.
For instance, accountants would still record land purchased in 1988 at its cost of USD 100,000 on the 2010 December 31, balance sheet even though its market value has risen to USD 300,000.
 Periodicity (time periods) concept.
According to the periodicity (time periods) concept or assumption, an entity’s life can be meaningfully subdivided into time periods (such as months or years) to report the results of its economic activities.
Now that you understand business transactions and the five basic accounting assumptions, you are ready to follow some business transactions step by step.
To begin, we divide Metro’s transactions into two groups: (1) transactions affecting only the balance sheet in June, and (2) transactions affecting the income statement and/or the balance sheet in July.
Note that we could also classify these transactions as operating, investing, or financing activities, as shown in the statement of cash flows.
2.8 Transactions affecting only the balance sheet Since each transaction affecting a business entity must be recorded in the accounting records, analyzing a transaction before actually recording it is an important part of financial accounting.
An error in transaction analysis results in incorrect financial statements.
To illustrate the analysis of transactions and their effects on the basic accounting equation, the activities of Metro Courier, Inc., that led to the statements in Exhibit 2 follow.
The first set of transactions (for June), 1a, 2a, and so on, are repeated in the summary of transactions, Exhibit 3 (Part A).
The second set of transactions (for July) (1b–6b) are repeated in Exhibit 4 (Part A).
p. 41 of 433  2.8.1 1a.
Owners invested cash When Metro Courier, Inc., was organized as a corporation on 2010 June 1, the company issued shares of capital stock for USD 30,000 cash to Ron Chaney, his wife, and their son.
This transaction increased assets (cash) of Metro by USD 30,000 and increased equities (the capital stock element of stockholders’ equity) by USD 30,000.
Consequently, the transaction yields the following basic accounting equation: Assets =Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity Accounts Office Notes Trans- Explan- Accounts Capital Cash Receiv- Trucks Equip- Payable action ation Payable Stock able ment + Beginning balances $ -0- $ -0- 1a Stockholder $ -0- $ -0- $ -0- = $ -0- $ -0- 30,000 30,000 s invested cash Balance after $ 30,000 $ 30,000 transaction Increased Increased by by $30,000 $30,000 2.8.2 2a.
Borrowed money The company borrowed USD 6,000 from Chaney’s father.
Chaney signed the note for the company.
The note bore no interest and the company promised to repay (recorded as a note payable) the amount borrowed within one year.
After including the effects of this transaction, the basic accounting equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity Trans- Explan- Accounts Office Accounts Notes Capital Cash Trucks action ation Receivable Equipment Payable Payable + Stock Balances before $ 30,000 $ -0- $ -0- $ -0- = $ -0- $ -0- $ 30,000 transaction Borrowed 2a 6,000 6,000 money Balance after $ 36,000 = $ 6,000 + $ 30,000 transaction Increased by Increased by $6,000 $6,000 2.8.3 3a.
Purchased trucks and office equipment for cash Metro paid USD 20,000 cash for two used delivery trucks and USD 1,500 for office equipment.
Trucks and office equipment are assets because the company uses them to earn revenues in the future.
Note that this transaction does not change the total amount of assets in the basic equation but only changes the composition of the assets.
This transaction decreased cash and increased trucks and office p. 42 of 433 equipment (assets) by the total amount of the cash decrease.
Metro received two assets and gave up one asset of equal value.
Total assets are still USD 36,000.
The accounting equation now is: Stockholders' Assets = Liabilities + Equity Accounts Office Accounts Notes Capital Cash Trucks Receivable Equipment Payable Payable + Stock $ 36,000 $ -0- $ -0- $ -0- = $ -0- $ 6,000 + $ 30,000 (21,500) 20,000 1,500 $ 14,500 $ 20,000 $ 1,500 = $ 6,000 + $ 30,000 Decreased Increased Increased by by by $1,500 $21,500 $20,000 2.8.4 4a.
Purchased office equipment on account (for credit) Metro purchased an additional USD 1,000 of office equipment on account, agreeing to pay within 10 days after receiving the bill.
(To purchase an item on account means to buy it on credit.)
This transaction increased assets (office equipment) and liabilities (accounts payable) by USD 1,000.
As stated earlier, accounts payable are amounts owed to suppliers for items purchased on credit.
Now you can see the USD 1,000 increase in the assets and liabilities as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity Accounts Notes Capital Cash Trucks Office Equipment Accounts Payable Receivable Payable + Stock $ 14,500 $ 20,000 $ 1,500 = $ 6,000 $ 30,000 1,000 1,000 $ 14,500 $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 1,000 $ 6,000 + $ 30,000 Increased by Increased by $1,000 $1,000 2.8.5 5a.
Paid an account payable Eight days after receiving the bill, Metro paid USD 1,000 for the office equipment purchased on account (transaction 4a).
This transaction reduced cash by USD 1,000 and reduced accounts payable by USD 1,000.
Thus, the assets and liabilities both are reduced by USD 1,000, and the equation again balances as follows: p. 43 of 433 Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders equity Trans- Explanatio Accounts Office Accounts Notes Cash Trucks + Capital Stock action n Receivable Equipment Payable Payable Balances before $ 14,500 $ -0- $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 1,000 $ 6,000 + $30,000 transaction Paid an 5a account (1,000) (1,000) payable Balance after $ 13,500 $ -0- $ 20,000 $ 2,500 $ -0- $ 6,000 +$30,000 transaction Decreased Decreased by by $1,000 $1,000 A.

A summary of transactions is a teaching tool used to show the effects of transactions on the accounting equation.
Note that the stockholders’ equity has remained at USD 30,000.
This amount p. 44 of 433 changes as the business begins to earn revenues or incur expenses.
You can see how the totals at the bottom of Part A of Exhibit 3 tie into the balance sheet shown in Part B.
The date on the balance sheet is 2010 June 30.
These totals become the beginning balances for July 2010.
Thus far, all transactions have consisted of exchanges or acquisitions of assets either by borrowing or by owner investment.
We used this procedure to help you focus on the accounting equation as it relates to the balance sheet.
However, people do not form a business only to hold existing assets.
They form businesses so their assets can generate greater amounts of assets.
Thus, a business increases its assets by providing goods or services to customers.
The results of these activities appear in the income statement.
The section that follows shows more of Metro’s transactions as it began earning revenues and incurring expenses.
2.9 Transactions affecting the income statement and/or balance sheet To survive, a business must be profitable.
This means that the revenues earned by providing goods and services to customers must exceed the expenses incurred.
In July 2010, Metro Courier, Inc., began selling services and incurring expenses.
The explanations of transactions that follow allow you to participate in this process and learn the necessary accounting procedures.
2.9.1 1b.
Earned service revenue and received cash As its first transaction in July, Metro performed delivery services for customers and received USD 4,800 cash.
This transaction increased an asset (cash) by USD 4,800.
Stockholders’ equity (retained earnings) also increased by USD 4,800, and the accounting equation was in balance.
The USD 4,800 is a revenue earned by the business and, as such, increases stockholders’ equity (in the form of retained earnings) because stockholders prosper when the business earns profits.
Likewise, if the corporation sustains a loss, the loss would reduce retained earnings.
Revenues increase the amount of retained earnings while expenses and dividends decrease them.
(In this first chapter, we show all of these items as immediately affecting retained earnings.
In later chapters, the revenues, expenses, and dividends are accounted for separately from retained earnings during the accounting period and are transferred to retained earnings only at the end of the accounting period as part of the closing process described in Chapter 4.)
The effects of this USD 4,800 transaction on the financial position of Metro are: p. 45 of 433 Metro would record the increase in stockholders’ equity brought about by the revenue transaction as a separate account, retained earnings.
This does not increase capital stock because the Capital Stock account increases only when the company issues shares of stock.
The expectation is that revenue transactions will exceed expenses and yield net income.
If net income is not distributed to stockholders, it is in fact retained.
Later chapters show that because of complexities in handling large numbers of transactions, revenues and expenses affect retained earnings only at the end of an accounting period.
The preceding procedure is a shortcut used to explain why the accounting equation remains in balance.

Service revenue earned on account (for credit) Metro performed courier delivery services for a customer who agreed to pay USD 900 at a later date.
The company granted credit rather than requiring the customer to pay cash immediately.
This is called earning revenue on account.
The transaction consists of exchanging services for the customer’s promise to pay later.
This transaction is similar to the preceding transaction in that stockholders’ equity (retained earnings) increases because the company has earned revenues.
However, the transaction differs because the company has not received cash.
Instead, the company has received another asset, an account receivable.
As noted earlier, an account receivable is the amount due from a customer for goods or services already provided.
The company has a legal right to collect from the customer in the future.
Accounting recognizes such claims as assets.
The accounting equation, including this USD 900 item, is as follows: Stockholders' + Assets Liabilities Equity Capital Transac Accounts Office Accounts Notes Retained Explanation Cash Trucks + tion Receivable Equipment Payable Payable Earnings Stock Balances before $ $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 6,000 $ 30,000 $ 4,800 transaction 18,300 Earned service 2b $900 900 revenue on account $ + $ Balances after transaction $900 $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 6,000 $5,700 18,300 30,000 Increased Increased by by $900 $900 p. 46 of 433  2.9.3 3b.
Collected cash on accounts receivable Metro collected USD 200 on account from the customer in transaction 2b.
The customer will pay the remaining USD 700 later.
This transaction affects only the balance sheet and consists of giving up a claim on a customer in exchange for cash.
The transaction increases cash by USD 200 and decreases accounts receivable by USD 200.
Note that this transaction consists solely of a change in the composition of the assets.
When the company performed the services, it recorded the revenue.
Therefore, the company does not record the revenue again when collecting the cash.

Paid salaries Metro paid employees USD 2,600 in salaries.
This transaction is an exchange of cash for employee services.
Typically, companies pay employees for their services after they perform their work.
Salaries (or wages) are costs companies incur to produce revenues, and companies consider them an expense.
Thus, the accountant treats the transaction as a decrease in an asset (cash) and a decrease in stockholders’ equity (retained earnings) because the company has incurred an expense.
Expense transactions reduce net income.
Since net income becomes a part of the retained earnings balance, expense transactions also reduce the retained earnings.

Paid rent In July, Metro paid USD 400 cash for office space rental.
This transaction causes a decrease in cash of USD 400 and a decrease in retained earnings of USD 400 because of the incurrence of rent expense.
Transaction 5b has the following effects on the amounts in the accounting equation: p. 47 of 433 Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity Office Accounts Notes Retained Cash Accounts Receivable Trucks + Capital Stock Equipment Payable Payable Earnings $ 15,900 $ 3,100 $ 700 $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 6,000 $ 30,000 (400) (400) $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 6,000 + $ 30,000 $ 2,700 Decreased by Decreased by $400 $400 2.9.6 6b.
Received bill for gas and oil used At the end of the month, Metro received a USD 600 bill for gas and oil consumed during the month.
This transaction involves an increase in accounts payable (a liability) because Metro has not yet paid the bill and a decrease in retained earnings because Metro has incurred an expense.
Metro’s accounting equation now reads: Assets =Liabilities + Stockholders' +Equity Office Cash Accounts Receivable Trucks Accounts Payable Notes Payable Capital + Stock Retained Earnings Equipment $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 6,000 $ 30,000 $ 2,700 600 (600) $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 20,000 $ 2,500 = $ 600 $ 6,000 + $ 30,000 $ 2,100 Increased by Decreased by $600 $600 2.10 Summary of balance sheet and income statement transactions Part A of Exhibit 4 summarizes the effects of all the preceding transactions on the assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity of Metro Courier, Inc., in July.
The beginning balances are the ending balances in Part A of Exhibit 3.
The summary shows subtotals after each transaction; these subtotals are optional and may be omitted.
Note how the accounting equation remains in balance after each transaction and at the end of the month.
The ending balances in each of the columns in Part A of Exhibit 4 are the dollar amounts in Part B and those reported earlier in the balance sheet in Part C of Exhibit 2.
The itemized data in the Retained Earnings column are the revenue and expense items in Part C of Exhibit 4 and those reported earlier in the income statement in Part A of Exhibit 2.
The beginning balance in the Retained Earnings column (USD 0) plus net income for the month (USD 2,100) is equal to the ending balance in retained earnings (USD 2,100) shown earlier in Part B of Exhibit 2.
Remember that the financial statements are not an end in themselves, but are prepared to assist users of those statements to make informed decisions.
Throughout the text we show how people use accounting information in decision making.
p. 48 of 433  2.11 Dividends paid to owners (stockholders) Stockholders’ equity is (1) increased by capital contributed by stockholders and by revenues earned through operations and (2) decreased by expenses incurred in producing revenues.
The payment of cash or other assets to stockholders in the form of dividends also reduces stockholders’ equity.
Thus, if the owners receive a cash dividend, the effect would be to reduce the retained earnings part of stockholders’ equity; the amount of dividends is not an expense but a distribution of income.
An ethical perspective: State university James Stevens was taking an accounting course at State University.
Also, he was helping companies find accounting systems that would fit their information needs.
He advised one of his clients to acquire a software computer package that could record the business transactions and prepare the financial statements.
The licensing agreement with the software company specified that the basic charge for one site was USD 4,000 and that USD 1,000 must be paid for each additional site where the software was used.
James was pleased that his recommendation to acquire the software was followed.
However, he was upset that management wanted him to install the software at eight other sites in the company and did not intend to pay the extra USD 8,000 due the software company.
A member of management stated, “The software company will never know the difference and, besides, everyone else seems to be pirating software.
If they do find out, we will pay the extra fee at that time.
Our expenses are high enough without paying these unnecessary costs.” James believed he might lose this client if he did not do as management instructed.

To find the equity ratio, divide stockholders’ equity by total equities or total assets, since total equities equals total assets.
In formula format: Stockholders'equity Equityratio= Totalequities The higher the proportion of equities (or assets) supplied by the owners, the more solvent the company.
However, a high portion of debt may indicate higher profitability because quite often the interest rate on debt is lower than the rate of earnings realized from using the proceeds of the debt.
An example illustrates this concept: Suppose that a company with USD 100,000 in assets could have raised the funds to acquire those assets in these two ways: Case 1 Assets................$100,000 Liabilities.........................$20,000 Stockholders' equity............$80,000 Case 2 Assets................$100,000 Liabilities.........................$80,000 Stockholders' equity............$20,000 When a company suffers operating losses, its assets decrease.
In Case 1, the assets would have to shrink by 80 per cent before the liabilities would equal the assets.
In Case 2, the assets would have to shrink only 20 per cent before the liabilities would equal the assets.
When the liabilities exceed the assets, the company is said to be insolvent.
Therefore, creditors are safer in Case 1 and will more readily lend money to the company.
However, if funds borrowed at 10 per cent are used to produce earnings at a 20 per cent rate, Case 2 is preferable in terms of profitability.
Therefore, owners are better off in Case 2 if the borrowed funds can earn more than they cost.
Next, we examine the recent equity ratios of some actual companies: Stockholders' Name of Company Total Equities ($ millions) Equity Ratio Equity ($ millions) Johnson & Johnson $ 23,734 $ 37,053 64.1% 3M Corporation 6,166 15,205 40.6 General Electric Company 53,597 460,097 11.6 p. 52 of 433 As you can see from the preceding data, the equity ratios of actual companies vary widely.
Companies such as Johnson & Johnson and 3M Corporation employ a higher proportion of stockholders’ equity (a lower proportion of debt) than GE in an effort to have stronger balance sheets (more solvency).
GE employs a greater proportion of debt, possibly in an attempt to increase profitability.
Every company must strike a balance between solvency and profitability to ensure long- run survival.
The correct balance between proportions of stockholder and creditor equities depends on the industry, general business conditions, and management philosophy.
Chapter 1 has introduced two important components of the accounting process—the accounting equation and the business transaction.
In Chapter 2, you learn about debits and credits and how accountants use them in recording transactions.
Understanding how data are accumulated, classified, and reported in financial statements helps you understand how to use financial statement data in making decisions.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology When you apply for your first job after graduation, prospective employers will expect you to know how to use a PC to perform many tasks.
Therefore, before you graduate you should be able to use word processing, spreadsheet, and database software.
You should be able to use the Internet to find useful information.
In many universities, you can learn these skills in courses taken for credit.
If your school does not offer credit courses, take noncredit courses or attend a training center.

 Service companies perform services for a fee.
 Merchandising companies purchase goods that are ready for sale and then sell them to customers.
p. 53 of 433  Manufacturing companies buy materials, convert them into products, and then sell the products to other companies or to final customers.
 The income statement reports the revenues and expenses of a company and shows the profitability of that business organization for a stated period of time.
 The statement of retained earnings shows the change in retained earnings between the beginning of the period (e.g.
a month) and its end.
 The balance sheet lists the assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity (including dollar amounts) of a business organization at a specific moment in time.
 The statement of cash flows shows the cash inflows and cash outflows for a company for a stated period of time.
 The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ equity.
 The left side of the equation represents the left side of the balance sheet and shows things of value owned by the business.
 The right side of the equation represents the right side of the balance sheet and shows who provided the funds to acquire the things of value (assets).
 Some transactions affect only balance sheet items: assets (such as cash, accounts receivable, and equipment), liabilities (such as accounts payable and notes payable), and stockholders’ equity (capital stock).
Other transactions affect both balance sheet items and income statement items (revenues, expenses, and eventually retained earnings).

2.14 Appendix: A comparison of corporate accounting with accounting for a sole proprietorship and a partnership Some textbook authors use a sole proprietorship and a partnership form of business ownership to illustrate accounting concepts and practices.
In a survey of users and nonusers of our text, we learned that the majority preferred the corporate approach because most students will probably work for or p. 54 of 433 invest in corporations.
Also, many small businesses operate as corporations because of the investors’ desire for limited liability.
This appendix briefly describes the differences in accounting for these three forms of business ownership.
The major difference is in the stockholders’ equity or owner’s equity section of the balance sheet.
As you learned in this chapter, the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet for a corporation consists of capital stock and retained earnings.
The owner’s equity section of the balance sheet for a sole proprietorship consists only of the owner’s capital account.
The owner’s equity section of a partnership is similar to that of a single proprietorship except that it shows a capital account and its balance for each partner.
Corporation Sole Proprietorship Partnership Stockholders' Owner's equity: Partners' capital: equity: John Smith, John Smith, Capital stock...$100,000 Capital....$150,000 Capital............ $75,000 Retained Sam Jones, earnings..... 50,000 Capital............ 75,000 Total..................$150,000 $150,000 $150,000 The stockholders’ equity section of a corporate balance sheet can become more complex as you will see later in the text.
However, the items in the owner’s equity section of the balance sheets of a sole proprietorship and a partnership always remain as just shown.
In a sole proprietorship, the owner’s capital balance consists of the owner’s investments in the business, plus cumulative net income since the beginning of the business, less any amounts withdrawn by the owner.
Thus, all of the amounts in the various stockholders’ equity accounts for a corporation are in the owner’s capital account in a single proprietorship.
In a partnership, each partner’s capital account balance consists of that partner’s investments in the business, plus that partner’s cumulative share of net income since that partner became a partner, less any amounts withdrawn by that partner.
The Dividends account in a corporation is similar to an owner’s drawing account in a single proprietorship.
These accounts both show amounts taken out of the business by the owners.
In a partnership, each partner has a drawing account.
Accountants treat asset, liability, revenue, and expense accounts similarly in all three forms of organization.

2.18.7 Beyond the numbers—critical thinking Business decision case A Upon graduation from high school, Jim Crane went to work for a builder of houses and small apartment buildings.
During the next six years, Crane earned a reputation as an excellent employee—hardworking, dedicated, and dependable—in the light construction industry.
He could handle almost any job requiring carpentry, electrical, or plumbing skills.
Crane then decided to go into business for himself under the name Jim’s Fix-It Shop, Inc.
He invested cash, some power tools, and a used truck in his business.
He completed many repair and remodeling jobs for homeowners and apartment owners.
The demand for his services was so large that he had more work than he could handle.
He operated out of his garage, which he had converted into a shop, adding several new pieces of power woodworking equipment.
Now, two years after going into business for himself, Crane must decide whether to continue in his own business or to accept a position as construction supervisor for a home builder.
He has been offered an annual salary of USD 50,000 and a package of fringe benefits (medical and hospitalization insurance, pension contribution, vacation and sick pay, and life insurance) worth approximately USD 8,000 per year.
The offer is attractive to Crane.
But he dislikes giving up his business since he has thoroughly enjoyed being his own boss, even though it has led to an average workweek well in excess of the standard 40 hours Suppose Crane comes to you for assistance in gathering the information needed to help him make a decision.
He brings along the accounting records that have been maintained for his business by an experienced accountant.
Using logic and your own life experiences, indicate the nature of the information Jim needs if he is to make an informed decision.
Pay particular attention to the information likely to be found in his business accounting records.
Does the accounting information available enter directly into the decision?
Write a memorandum to Jim describing the information he will need to make an informed decision.
The memo’s headings should include Date, To, From, and Subject.
(See the format in Group Project E below.)
p. 73 of 433 Annual report analysis B Recall that in this chapter we showed that the equity ratio is calculated by dividing stockholders’ equity by total equities (or total assets).
Another format for analyzing solvency is to divide total debt by total equities.
This latter calculation tells the proportion of assets financed by debt rather than the proportion of assets financed by stockholders’ equity.
These two ratios are complements and must add to 100 per cent.
Thus, if 25 per cent of assets were financed by debt, 75 per cent were financed by stockholders’ equity.
Using the following historical data from Gateway, calculate the “total-debt-to total-capital” ratio for each year.
2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Total USD USD USD USD USD USD USD liabilities 1,772,205 1,937,570 1,546,005 1,109,337 857,870 568,492 394,545 (000's) Total 2380339 2017118 1344375 930044 815541 555519 376035 stockholder s equity Study these amounts and comment on the solvency of the company.
Is there a trend in the company’s solvency over time?
Gateway has experienced tremendous growth in stockholders’ equity during the past six years, but has also increased liabilities significantly.
Could Gateway have grown this much without increasing liabilities?

Group project E In teams of two or three students, interview a businessperson in your community.
Ask how that person uses accounting information in making business decisions and obtain specific examples.
Each team should write a memorandum to the instructor summarizing the results of the interview.
Information contained in the memo should include: Date: To: From: Subject: Content of the memo must include the name and title of the person interviewed, name of the company, date of the interview, examples of the use of accounting information for decision making, and any other pertinent information.
Group project F With a team composed of one or two other students, conceive of a business that you would like to form after graduation.
Then describe approximately 15–20 transactions that the business might undertake in its first month of operations.
Prepare a summary of transactions showing how each transaction affects the accounting equation.
Identify each asset, liability, and stockholders’ equity item in your summary of transactions.
For instance, instead of grouping all assets in one number, show cash, accounts receivable, and so on in your accounting equation.
Group project G With a team of one or two other students and using library sources, write a paper on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, their services to members, and their activities.
Be careful to cite sources for your information.
Direct quotes should be labeled as such and should be single-spaced and indented if relatively long or in quote marks and not indented if relatively short.
To quote without giving the source is plagiarism and should be avoided at all costs.

p. 76 of 433  3 Recording business transactions 3.1 Learning objectives After studying this chapter, you should be able to:  Use the account as the basic classifying and storage unit for accounting information.
 Express the effects of business transactions in terms of debits and credits to different types of accounts.
 List the steps in the accounting cycle.
 Record the effects of business transactions in a journal.

3.2 Salary potential of accountants Selecting a major represents much more than the choice of courses a student takes in college.
To a significant degree, the student's major, along with academic performance, will determine the career paths available upon graduation.
Few professionals would recommend a specific career choice based solely on salaries.
However, as students select their major and map out their career path, it is important that they make informed decisions with respect to the potential financial rewards of the various options.
Outlined below is information on selected salaries for many accounting-related careers.
These salaries, current as of 2009, should be viewed only as guidelines.
Salaries at all levels can vary significantly between locations.
Also, one should add 10 to 15 per cent to the listed salary for professional certifications (such as the CPA) or for a graduate degree (Masters of Accounting or MBA).
p. 77 of 433 Salaries for Public Accounting, Non-Partners Position Large CPA Firms: Salary Range Starting Salaries $35,750 - $42,500 Salary between 1-3 years $41,000 - $51,250 Manager/Director $77,750 - $119,000 Small CPA Firms: Starting Salaries $29,500 - $36,250 Salary between 1-3 years $33,750 - $42,500 Manager/Director $62,750 - $84,500 Salaries for Corporate Accounting - Large Corporations Position Salary Range Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer $244,500 - $347,000 Vice President, Finance $189,000 - $293,500 Director of Finance $121,500 - $178,250 Director of Accounting $115,250 - $157,500 Controller $105,750 - $147,250 Assistant Controller $89,750 - $114,750 Tax Director $117,000 - $209,750 Tax Manager $78,000 - $113,750 Audit Director $127,750 - $200,750 General Accounting - Manager $61,250 - $83,250 General Accounting - 1-3 years experience $37,500 - $48,750 General Accounting - starting salary $31,750 - $39,750 Students interested in a career in accounting and finance can find detailed information for these and many other accounting related careers at Robert Half (www.roberthalf.com).
Also, accounting professors are generally familiar with starting salaries and job opportunities for accounting graduates, so you may want to address more specific questions about potential careers and salaries with them.
In Chapter 1, we illustrated the income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.
These statements are the end products of the financial accounting process, which is based on the accounting equation.
The financial accounting process quantifies past management decisions.
The results of these decisions are communicated to users—management, creditors, and investors—and serve as a basis for making future decisions.
The raw data of accounting are the business transactions.
We recorded the transactions in Chapter 1 as increases or decreases in the assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity items of the accounting equation.
This procedure showed you how various transactions affected the accounting equation.
When working through these sample transactions, you probably suspected that listing all transactions as increases or decreases in the transactions summary columns would be too cumbersome in practice.
Most businesses, even small ones, enter into many transactions every day.
Chapter 2 teaches you how to actually record business transactions in the accounting process.
To explain the dual procedure of recording business transactions with debits and credits, we introduce you to some new tools: the T-account, the journal, and the ledger.
Using these tools, you can follow a company through its various business transactions.
Like accountants, you can use a trial balance to check the equality of your recorded debits and credits.
This is the double-entry accounting p. 78 of 433 system that the Franciscan monk, Luca Pacioli, described centuries ago.
Understanding this system enables you to better understand the content of financial statements so you can use the information provided to make informed business decisions.
3.3 The account and rules of debit and credit A business may engage in thousands of transactions during a year.
An accountant classifies and summarizes the data in these transactions to create useful information.
Steps in recording business transactions Look at Exhibit 5 to see the steps in recording and posting the effects of a business transaction.
Note that source documents provide the evidence that a business transaction occurred.
These source documents include such items as bills received from suppliers for goods or services received, bills sent to customers for goods sold or services performed, and cash register tapes.
The information in the source document serves as the basis for preparing a journal entry.
Then a firm posts (transfers) that information to accounts in the ledger.
You can see from Exhibit 5 that after you prepare the journal entry, you post it to the accounts in the ledger.
However, before you can record the journal entry, you must understand the rules of debit and credit.
To teach you these rules, we begin by studying the nature of an account.
Fortunately, most business transactions are repetitive.
This makes the task of accountants somewhat easier because they can classify the transactions into groups having common characteristics.
For example, a company may have thousands of receipts or payments of cash during a year.
As a result, a part of every cash transaction can be recorded and summarized in a single place called an account.
An account is a part of the accounting system used to classify and summarize the increases, decreases, and balances of each asset, liability, stockholders' equity item, dividend, revenue, and expense.
Firms set up accounts for each different business element, such as cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.
Every business has a Cash account in its accounting system because knowledge of the amount of cash on hand is useful information.
Accountants may differ on the account title (or name) they give the same item.
For example, one accountant might name an account Notes Payable and another might call it Loans Payable.
Both account titles refer to the amounts borrowed by the company.
The account title should be logical to help the accountant group similar transactions into the same account.
Once you give an account a title, you must use that same title throughout the accounting records.
The number of accounts in a company's accounting system depends on the information needs of those interested in the business.
The main requirement is that each account provides information p. 79 of 433 useful in making decisions.
Thus, one account may be set up for all cash rather than having a separate account for each form of cash (coins on hand, currency on hand, and deposits in banks).
The amount of cash is useful information; the form of cash often is not.
To illustrate recording the increases and decreases in an account, texts use the T-account, which looks like a capital letter T. The name of the account, such as Cash, appears across the top of the T. We record increases on one side of the vertical line of the T and decreases on the other side.
A T-account appears as follows: An accounting perspective: Business insight Have you ever considered starting your own business?
If so, you will need to understand accounting to successfully run your business.
To know how well your business is doing, you must understand and analyze financial statements.
Accounting information also tells you why you are performing as reported.
If you are in business to sell or develop a certain product or perform a specific service, you cannot operate profitably or consider expanding unless you base your business decisions on accounting information.
Exhibit 5: The steps in recording and posting the effects of a business transaction In Chapter 1, you saw that each business transaction affects at least two items.
For example, if you— an owner—invest cash in your business, the company's assets increase and its stockholders' equity increases.
This result was illustrated in the summary of transactions in Exhibit 1.3.
In the following p. 80 of 433 sections, we use debits and credits and the double-entry procedure to record the increases and decreases caused by business transactions.
Accountants use the term debit instead of saying, "Place an entry on the left side of the T-account".
They use the term credit for "Place an entry on the right side of the T-account".
Debit (abbreviated Dr.) simply means left side; credit (abbreviated Cr.)
means right side.1 Thus, for all accounts a debit entry is an entry on the left side, while a credit entry is an entry on the right side.
Any Account Left, or Right, or debit, side credit, side After recognizing a business event as a business transaction, we analyze it to determine its increase or decrease effects on the assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity items, dividends, revenues, or expenses of the business.
Then we translate these increase or decrease effects into debits and credits.
In each business transaction we record, the total dollar amount of debits must equal the total dollar amount of credits.
When we debit one account (or accounts) for USD 100, we must credit another account (or accounts) for a total of USD 100.
The accounting requirement that each transaction be recorded by an entry that has equal debits and credits is called double-entry procedure, or duality.
This double-entry procedure keeps the accounting equation in balance.
The dual recording process produces two sets of accounts—those with debit balances and those with credit balances.
The totals of these two groups of accounts must be equal.
Then, some assurance exists that the arithmetic part of the transaction recording process has been properly carried out.
Now, let us actually record business transactions in T-accounts using debits and credits.
3.4 Recording changes in assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity While recording business transactions, remember that the foundation of the accounting process is the following basic accounting equation: Assets=Liabilities+Stockholders'Equity Recording transactions into the T-accounts is easier when you focus on the equal sign in the accounting equation.
Assets, which are on the left of the equal sign, increase on the left side of the T- accounts.
Liabilities and stockholders' equity, to the right of the equal sign, increase on the right side of the T-accounts.
You already know that the left side of the T-account is the debit side and the right side 1The abbreviations “Dr.” and “Cr.” are based on the Latin words “debere” and “credere”.
A synonym for debit an account is charge an account.
p. 81 of 433 is the credit side.
So you should be able to fill in the rest of the rules of increases and decreases by deduction, such as: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity Debit for Credit for Debit for Credit for Debit for Credit for increases decreases decreases increases decreases increases To summarize:  Assets increase by debits (left side) to the T-account and decrease by credits (right side) to the T- account.
 Liabilities and stockholders' equity decrease by debits (left side) to the T-account and increase by credits (right side) to the T-account.
Applying these two rules keeps the accounting equation in balance.
Now we apply the debit and credit rules for assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity to business transactions.
Assume a corporation issues shares of its capital stock for USD 10,000 in transaction 1.
(Note the figure in parentheses is the number of the transaction and ties the two sides of the transaction together.)
The company records the receipt of USD 10,000 as follows: (Dr.) Cash (Cr) (Dr.) Capital Stock (Cr (1) 10,000 (1) 10,000 This transaction increases the asset, cash, which is recorded on the left side of the Cash account.
Then, the transaction increases stockholders' equity, which is recorded on the right side of the Capital Stock account.
Assume the company borrowed USD 5,000 from a bank on a note (transaction 2).
A note is an unconditional written promise to pay to another party (the bank) the amount owed either when demanded or at a specified date, usually with interest at a specified rate.
The firm records this transaction as follows: (Dr.) Cash (Cr) (Dr.) Notes Payable (Cr) (1) (2) 5,000 (2) 10,000 5,000 Observe that liabilities, Notes Payable, increase with an entry on the right (credit) side of the account.
Recording changes in revenues and expenses In Chapter 1, we recorded the revenues and expenses directly in the Retained Earnings account.
However, this is not done in practice because of the volume of revenue and expense transactions.
Instead, businesses treat the expense accounts as if they were subclassifications of the debit side of the Retained Earnings account, and the revenue accounts as if they were subclassifications of the credit side.
Since firms need the amounts of revenues p. 82 of 433 and expenses to prepare the income statement, they keep a separate account for each type of revenue and expense.
The recording rules for revenues and expenses are:  Record increases in revenues on the right (credit) side of the T-account and decreases on the left (debit) side.
The reasoning behind this rule is that revenues increase retained earnings, and increases in retained earnings are recorded on the right side.
 Record increases in expenses on the left (debit) side of the T-account and decreases on the right (credit) side.
The reasoning behind this rule is that expenses decrease retained earnings, and decreases in retained earnings are recorded on the left side.
To illustrate these rules, assume the same company received USD 1,000 cash from a customer for services rendered (transaction 3).
The Cash account, an asset, increases on the left (debit) side of the T- account; and the Service Revenue account, an increase in retained earnings, increases on the right (credit) side.
(Dr.) Cash (Cr) (Dr.) Service Revenue (Cr) (1) 10,000 (3) 1,000 (2) 5,000 (3) 1,000 Now assume this company paid USD 600 in salaries to employees (transaction 4).
The Cash account, an asset, decreases on the right (credit) side of the T-account; and the Salaries Expense account, a decrease in retained earnings, increases on the left (debit) side.2 (Dr) Cash (Cr) (Dr.) Salaries Expense (Cr) (1) 10,000 (4) 600 (4) 600 (2) 5,000 (3) 1,000 Recording changes in dividends Since dividends decrease retained earnings, increases appear on the left side of the Dividends account and decreases on the right side.
Thus, the firm records payment of a USD 2,000 cash dividend (transaction 5) as follows: (Dr) Cash (Cr) (Dr.) Dividends3 (Cr) (1) 10,000 (4) 600 (5) 2,000 (2) 5,000 (5) 2,000 (3) 1,000 2Certain deductions are normally taken out of employees' pay for social security taxes, federal and state withholding, and so on.
Those deductions are ignored here.
p. 83 of 433 3 At the end of the accounting period, the accountant transfers any balances in the expense, revenue, and Dividends accounts to the Retained Earnings account.
This transfer occurs only after the information in the expense and revenue accounts has been used to prepare the income statement.
We discuss and illustrate this step in Chapter 4.
To determine the balance of any T-account, total the debits to the account, total the credits to the account, and subtract the smaller sum from the larger.
If the sum of the debits exceeds the sum of the credits, the account has a debit balance.
For example, the following Cash account uses information from the preceding transactions.
The account has a debit balance of USD 13,400, computed as total debits of USD 16,000 less total credits of USD 2,600.
(Dr.) Cash (Cr) (1) 10,000 (4) 600 (2) 5,000 (5) 2,000 (3) 1,000 16,000 2,600 Dr. bal 13,400 If, on the other hand, the sum of the credits exceeds the sum of the debits, the account has a credit balance.
For instance, assume that a company has an Accounts Payable account with a total of USD 10,000 in debits and USD 13,000 in credits.
The account has a credit balance of USD 3,000, as shown in the following T-account: (Dr.) Accounts Payable (Cr) 10,000 7,000 6,000 10,000 13,000 Cr.
bal 3,000 Normal balances Since debits increase asset, expense, and dividend accounts, they normally have debit (or left-side) balances.
Conversely, because credits increase liability, capital stock, retained earnings, and revenue accounts, they normally have credit (or right-side) balances.
The following chart shows the normal balances of the seven accounts we have used: Normal Balances Types of Accounts Debit Credit Assets X Liabilities X 3As we illustrate later in the text, some companies debt dividends directly to the Retained Earnings account rather than to a Dividends account.
p. 84 of 433 Stockholders' Equity Capital Stock X Retained earnings X Dividends X Expenses X Revenues X At this point, you should memorize the six rules of debit and credit.
Later, as you proceed in your study of accounting, the rules will become automatic.
Then, you will no longer ask yourself, "Is this increase a debit or credit?"
Asset accounts increase on the debit side, while liability and stockholders' equity accounts increase on the credit side.
When the account balances are totaled, they conform to the following independent equations: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity Debits = Credits The arrangement of these two formulas gives the first three rules of debit and credit:  Increases in asset accounts are debits; decreases are credits.
 Decreases in liability accounts are debits; increases are credits.
 Decreases in stockholders' equity accounts are debits; increases are credits.
Assets Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity Stockholders' Equity Account(s) Asset Accounts = Liability Accounts + (Capital Stock and Retained Earnings) Debit* Credit Debit Credit* Debit Credit* + - - + + Debit Credit Debit Credit Debit Credit for for for for for for increase decrease decrease increase decrease increase Expense Accounts Debits Credits and Dividends Account Revenue Accounts 1.

Exhibit 6: Rules of debit and credit The debit and credit rules for expense and Dividends accounts and for revenue accounts follow logically if you remember that expenses and dividends are decreases in stockholders' equity and revenues are increases in stockholders' equity.
Since stockholders' equity accounts decrease on the p. 85 of 433 debit side, expense and Dividend accounts increase on the debit side.
Since stockholders' equity accounts increase on the credit side, revenue accounts increase on the credit side.
The last three debit and credit rules are:  Decreases in revenue accounts are debits; increases are credits.
 Increases in expense accounts are debits; decreases are credits.
 Increases in Dividends accounts are debits; decreases are credits.
In Exhibit 6, we depict these six rules of debit and credit.
Note first the treatment of expense and Dividends accounts as if they were subclassifications of the debit side of the Retained Earnings account.
Second, note the treatment of the revenue accounts as if they were subclassifications of the credit side of the Retained Earnings account.
Next, we discuss the accounting cycle and indicate where steps in the accounting cycle are discussed in Chapters 2 through 4.
3.5 The accounting cycle The accounting cycle is a series of steps performed during the accounting period (some throughout the period and some at the end) to analyze, record, classify, summarize, and report useful financial information for the purpose of preparing financial statements.
Before you can visualize the eight steps in the accounting cycle, you must be able to recognize a business transaction.
Business transactions are measurable events that affect the financial condition of a business.
For example, assume that the owner of a business spilled a pot of coffee in her office or broke her leg while skiing.
These two events may briefly interrupt the operation of the business.
However, they are not measurable in terms that affect the solvency and profitability of the business.
Business transactions can be the exchange of goods for cash between the business and an external party, such as the sale of a book, or they can involve paying salaries to employees.
These events have one fundamental criterion: They must have caused a measurable change in the amounts in the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity.
The evidence that a business event has occurred is a source document such as a sales ticket, check, and so on.
Source documents are important because they are the ultimate proof of business transactions.4 After you have determined that an event is a measurable business transaction and have adequate proof of this transaction, mentally analyze the transaction's effects on the accounting equation.
You 4Many companies send and receive source documents electronically, rather than on paper.
In such an electronic computer environment, source documents might exist only in the computer databases of the two parties involved in the transaction.
p. 86 of 433 learned how to do this in Chapter 1.
This chapter and Chapters 3 and 4 describe the other steps in the accounting cycle.
The eight steps in the accounting cycle and the chapters that discuss them are:  Analyze transactions by examining source documents (Chapters 1 and 2).
 Journalize transactions in the journal (Chapter 2).
 Post journal entries to the accounts in the ledger (Chapter 2).
 Prepare a trial balance of the accounts (Chapter 2) and complete the work sheet (Chapter 4).
(This step includes adjusting entries from Chapter 3.)
 Prepare financial statements (Chapter 4).
 Journalize and post adjusting entries (Chapters 3 and 4).
 Journalize and post closing entries (Chapter 4).
 Prepare a post-closing trial balance (Chapter 4).
This listing serves as a preview of what you will study in Chapters 2-4.
Notice that firms perform the last five steps at the end of the accounting period.
Step 5 precedes steps 6 and 7 because management needs the financial statements at the earliest possible date.
After the statements have been delivered to management, the adjusting and closing entries can be journalized and posted.
In Exhibit 7, we diagram the eight steps in the accounting cycle.
You can perform many of these steps on a computer with an accounting software package.
However, you must understand a manual accounting system and all of the steps in the accounting cycle to understand what the computer is doing.
This understanding removes the mystery of what the computer is doing when it takes in raw data and produces financial statements.
3.6 The journal In explaining the rules of debit and credit, we recorded transactions directly in the accounts.
Each ledger (general ledger) account shows only the increases and decreases in that account.
Thus, all the effects of a single business transaction would not appear in any one account.
For example, the Cash account contains only data on changes in cash and does not show how the cash was generated or how it was spent.
To have a permanent record of an entire transaction, the accountant uses a book or record known as a journal.
A journal is a chronological (arranged in order of time) record of business transactions.
A journal entry is the recording of a business transaction in the journal.
A journal entry shows all the effects of a business transaction as expressed in debit(s) and credit(s) and may include an explanation of the transaction.
A transaction is entered in a journal before it is entered in ledger accounts.
Because each p. 87 of 433 transaction is initially recorded in a journal rather than directly in the ledger, a journal is called a book of original entry.
A business usually has more than one journal.
Chapter 4 briefly describes several special journals.
In this chapter, we use the basic form of journal, the general journal.
As shown in Exhibit 8, a general journal contains the following columns: Exhibit 7: Steps in the accounting cycle p. 88 of 433 MICROTRAIN COMPANY General Journal Date Account Titles and Explanation Post.
Debit Credit Ref.
2010 Nov. 28 Cash (+A) 100 5 0 0 0 0 Capital Stock (+SE) 300 5 0 0 0 0 Stockholders invested $50,000 cash in business.
Exhibit 8: Journal entry  Date column.
The first column on each journal page is for the date.
For the first journal entry on a page, this column contains the year, month, and day (number).
For all other journal entries on a page, this column contains only the day of the month, until the month changes.
 Account titles and explanation column.
The first line of an entry shows the account debited.
The second line shows the account credited.
Notice that we indent the credit account title to the right.
For instance, in Exhibit 8 we show the debit to the Cash account and then the credit to the Capital Stock account.
Any necessary explanation of a transaction appears on the line(s) below the credit entry and is indented halfway between the accounts debited and credited.
A journal entry explanation should be concise and yet complete enough to describe fully the transaction and prove the entry's accuracy.
When a journal entry is self-explanatory, we omit the explanation.
 Posting reference column.
This column shows the account number of the debited or credited account.
For instance, in Exhibit 8, the number 100 in the first entry means that the Cash account number is 100.
No number appears in this column until the information has been posted to the appropriate ledger account.
We discuss posting later in the chapter.
 Debit column.
In the debit column, the amount of the debit is on the same line as the title of the account debited.
 Credit column.
In the credit column, the amount of the credit is on the same line as the title of the account credited.
An account perspective: Uses of technology Preparing journal entries in a computerized system is different than in a manual system.
The computer normally asks for the number of the account to be debited.
After you type the account number, the computer shows the account title in its proper position.
The cursor then moves to the debit column and waits for you to enter the p. 89 of 433 amount of the debit.
Then it asks if there are more debits.
If not, the computer prompts you for the account number of the credit.
After you type the account number, the computer supplies the account name of the credit and enters the same amount debited as the credit.
When there is more than one credit, you can override the amount and enter the correct amount.
Then you would enter the other credit in the same way.
If your debits and credits are not equal, the computer warns you and makes you correct the error.
You can supply an explanation for the entry from a standard list or type it in.
As you enter the journal entries, the computer automatically posts them to the ledger accounts.
At any time, you can have the computer print a trial balance.
A summary of the functions and advantages of using a journal follows: The journal—  Records transactions in chronological order.
 Shows the analysis of each transaction in debits and credits.
 Supplies an explanation of each transaction when necessary.
 Serves as a source for future reference to accounting transactions.
 Eliminates the need for lengthy explanations from the accounts.
 Makes possible posting to the ledger at convenient times.
 Assists in maintaining the ledger in balance because the debit(s) must always equal the credit(s) in each journal entry.
 Aids in tracing errors when the ledger is not in balance.
3.7 The ledger A ledger (general ledger) is the complete collection of all the accounts of a company.
The ledger may be in loose-leaf form, in a bound volume, or in computer memory.
Accounts fall into two general groups: (1) balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity) and (2) income statement accounts (revenues and expenses).
The terms real accounts and permanent accounts also refer to balance sheet accounts.
Balance sheet accounts are real accounts because they are not subclassifications or subdivisions of any other account.
They are permanent accounts because their balances are not transferred (or closed) to any other account at the end of the accounting period.
Income statement accounts and the Dividends account are nominal accounts because they are merely subclassifications of the stockholders' equity accounts.
Nominal literally means "in name only".
Nominal accounts are also called temporary accounts because they p. 90 of 433 temporarily contain revenue, expense, and dividend information that is transferred (or closed) to the Retained Earnings account at the end of the accounting period.
The chart of accounts is a complete listing of the titles and numbers of all the accounts in the ledger.
The chart of accounts can be compared to a table of contents.
The groups of accounts usually appear in this order: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, dividends, revenues, and expenses.
Individual accounts are in sequence in the ledger.
Each account typically has an identification number and a title to help locate accounts when recording data.
For example, a company might number asset accounts, 100-199; liability accounts, 200-299; stockholders' equity accounts and Dividends account, 300-399; revenue accounts, 400-499; and expense accounts, 500-599.
We use this numbering system in this text.
The uniform chart of accounts used in the first 11 chapters appears in a separate file at the end of the text.
You should print that file and keep it handy for working certain problems and exercises.
Companies may use other numbering systems.
For instance, sometimes a company numbers its accounts in sequence starting with 1, 2, and so on.
The important idea is that companies use some numbering system.
Now that you understand how to record debits and credits in an account and how all accounts together form a ledger, you are ready to study the accounting process in operation.
3.8 The accounting process in operation MicroTrain Company is a small corporation that provides on-site personal computer software training using the clients' equipment.
The company offers beginning through advanced training with convenient scheduling.
A small fleet of trucks transports personnel and teaching supplies to the clients' sites.
The company rents a building and is responsible for paying the utilities.
We illustrate the capital stock transaction that occurred to form the company (in November) and the first month of operations (December).
The accounting process used by this company is similar to that of any small company.
The ledger accounts used by MicroTrain Company are: p. 91 of 433 Acct.
Account Title No.
Description 100 Cash Bank deposits and cash on hand.
103 Accounts Receivable Amounts owed to the company by customers.
107 Supplies on Hand Items such as paper, envelopes, writing materials, and other materials used in performing training services for customers or in doing administrative Assets and clerical office work.
108 Prepaid Insurance Insurance policy premiums paid in advance of the periods for which the insurance coverage applies.
112 Prepaid Rent Rent paid in advance of the periods for which the rent payment applies.
150 Trucks Trucks used to transport personnel and training supplies to clients' locations.
200 Accounts Payable Amounts owed to creditors for items purchased Liabilities 216 Unearned Service Fees from them.
Amounts received from customers before the training services have been performed for them.
Stockholders' 300 Capital Stock Retained The stockholders' investment in the business.
The earnings equity 310 Earnings retained in the business.
Dividends 320 Dividends The amount of dividends declared to stockholders.
Revenues 400 Service Revenue Amounts earned by performing training services for customers.
505 Advertising Expense The cost of advertising incurred in the current period.
506 Gas and Oil Expense The cost of gas and oil used in trucks in the Expenses current period.
507 Salaries Expense The amount of salaries incurred in the current period. ]
511 Utilities Expense The cost of utilities incurred in the current period.
Notice the gaps left between account numbers (100, 103, 107, etc.).
These gaps allow the firm to later add new accounts between the existing accounts.
To begin, a transaction must be journalized.
Journalizing is the process of entering the effects of a transaction in a journal.
Then, the information is transferred, or posted, to the proper accounts in the ledger.
Posting is the process of recording in the ledger accounts the information contained in the journal.
We explain posting in more detail later in the chapter.
In the following example, notice that each business transaction affects two or more accounts in the ledger.
Also note that the transaction date in both the general journal and the general ledger accounts is the same.
In the ledger accounts, the date used is the date that the transaction was recorded in the general journal, even if the entry is not posted until several days later.
Our example shows the journal entries posted to T-accounts.
In practice, firms post journal entries to ledger accounts, as we show later in the chapter.
Accountants use the accrual basis of accounting.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, they recognize revenues when the company makes a sale or performs a service, regardless of when the company receives the cash.
They recognize expenses as incurred, whether or not the company has paid out cash.
Chapter 3 discusses the accrual basis of accounting in more detail.
p. 92 of 433 In the following MicroTrain Company example, transaction 1 increases (debits) Cash and increases (credits) Capital Stock by USD 50,000.
First, MicroTrain records the transaction in the general journal; second, it posts the entry to the accounts in the general ledger.

The company prepares financial statements at the end of each month.
Exhibit 9 shows the company's balance sheet at 2010 November 30.
The balance sheet reflects ledger account balances as of the close of business on 2010 November 30.
These closing balances are the beginning balances on 2010 December 1.
The ledger accounts show these closing balances as beginning balances (Beg.
bal.).
Now assume that in December 2010, MicroTrain Company engaged in the following transactions.
We show the proper recording of each transaction in the journal and then in the ledger accounts (in T- account form), and describe the effects of each transaction.

The debit is to Prepaid Insurance rather than Insurance Expense because the policy covers more than the current accounting period of December (insurance policies are usually paid one year in advance).
As you will see in Chapter 3, prepaid items are expensed as they are used.
If this insurance p. 94 of 433 policy was only written for December, the entire USD 2,400 debit would have been to Insurance Expense.

2010 Dec. 4 1,400 Effects of transaction An asset, supplies on hand, increases (debited); and a liability, accounts payable, increases (credited) by USD 1,400.
The debit is to Supplies on Hand rather than Supplies Expense because the supplies are to be used over several accounting periods.
In each of the three preceding entries, we debited an asset rather than an expense.
The reason is that the expenditure applies to (or benefits) more than just the current accounting period.
Whenever a company will not fully use up an item such as insurance, rent, or supplies in the period when purchased, it usually debits an asset.
In practice, however, sometimes the expense is initially debited in these situations.
Companies sometimes buy items that they fully use up within the current accounting period.
For example, during the first part of the month a company may buy supplies that it intends to consume fully during that month.
If the company fully consumes the supplies during the period of purchase, the best practice is to debit Supplies Expense at the time of purchase rather than Supplies on Hand.
This same advice applies to insurance and rent.
If a company purchases insurance that it fully consumes during the current period, the company should debit Insurance Expense at the time of purchase rather than Prepaid Insurance.
Also, if a company pays rent that applies only to the current period, Rent Expense should be debited at the time of purchase rather than Prepaid Rent.
As illustrated in Chapter 3, following this advice simplifies the procedures at the end of the accounting period.

The credit is to Unearned Service Fees rather than Service Revenue because the USD 4,500 applies to more than just the current accounting period.
Unearned Service Fees is a liability because, if the services are never performed, the USD 4,500 will have to be refunded.
If the payment had been for services to be provided in December, the credit would have been to Service Revenue.

Transaction 15 concludes the analysis of the MicroTrain Company transactions.
The next section discusses and illustrates posting to ledger accounts and cross-indexing.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology p. 104 of 433 The concept of the Internet dates to the 1960s when the military tied together several computers forming a "network" that allowed users to communicate with each other instantaneously on their computers over many miles.
Then universities and scientific institutions connected to the network to meet their research and communication needs.
More and more organizations hooked up to the network over time.
Today many companies seek customers and employees over the Internet.
Students and faculty use the Internet to perform research, communicate with their colleagues (using e-mail), and search distant libraries.
Accountants in practice are heavy users of the Internet to locate company data, tax regulations, and almost any other information they need.
You will find that learning to use the Internet effectively is essential to your future success.
3.9 The use of ledger accounts A journal entry is like a set of instructions.
The carrying out of these instructions is known as posting.
As stated earlier, posting is recording in the ledger accounts the information contained in the journal.
A journal entry directs the entry of a certain dollar amount as a debit in a specific ledger account and directs the entry of a certain dollar amount as a credit in a specific ledger account.
Earlier, we posted the journal entries for MicroTrain Company to T-accounts.
In practice, however, companies post these journal entries to ledger accounts.
Using a new example, Jenks Company, we illustrate posting to ledger accounts.
Later, we show you how to post the MicroTrain Company journal entries to ledger accounts.
In Exhibit 10, the first journal entry for the Jenks Company directs that USD 10,000 be posted in the ledger as a debit to the Cash account and as a credit to the Capital Stock account.
We post the debit in the general ledger Cash account by using the following procedure: Enter in the Cash account the date, a short explanation, the journal designation ("G" for general journal) and the journal page number from which the debit is posted, and the USD 10,000 in the Debit column.
Then, enter the number of the account to which the debit is posted in the Posting Reference column of the general journal.
Post the credit in a similar manner but as a credit to Account No.
300.
The arrows in Exhibit 10 show how these amounts were posted to the correct accounts.
Exhibit 10 shows the ledger account.
In contrast to the two-sided T-account format shown so far, the three-column format has columns for debit, credit, and balance.
The three-column form has the p. 105 of 433 advantage of showing the balance of the account after each item has been posted.
In addition, in this chapter, we indicate whether each balance is a debit or a credit.
In later chapters and in practice, the nature of the balance is usually not indicated since it is understood.
Also, notice that we give an explanation for each item in the ledger accounts.
Often accountants omit these explanations because each item can be traced back to the general journal for the explanation.
Posting is always from the journal to the ledger accounts.
Postings can be made (1) at the time the transaction is journalized; (2) at the end of the day, week, or month; or (3) as each journal page is filled.
The choice is a matter of personal taste.
When posting the general journal, the date used in the ledger accounts is the date the transaction was recorded in the journal, not the date the journal entry was posted to the ledger accounts.
Frequently, accountants must check and trace the origin of their transactions, so they provide cross- indexing.
Cross-indexing is the placing of (1) the account number of the ledger account in the general journal and (2) the general journal page number in the ledger account.
As shown in Exhibit 10, the account number of the ledger account to which the posting was made is in the Posting Reference column of the general journal.
Note the arrow from Account No.
100 in the ledger to the 100 in the Posting Reference column beside the first debit in the general journal.
Accountants place the number of the general journal page from which the entry was posted in the Posting Reference column of the ledger account.
Note the arrow from page 1 in Exhibit 10 the general journal to G1 in the Posting Reference column of the Cash account in the general ledger.
The notation "G1" means general journal, page 1.
The date of the transaction also appears in the general ledger.
Note the arrows from the date in the general journal to the dates in the general ledger.

Exhibit 11: General journal (after posting) To understand the posting and cross-indexing process, trace the entries from the general journal to the general ledger.
The ledger accounts need not contain explanations of all the entries, since any needed explanations can be obtained from the general journal.
Look at Exhibit 11 to see how all the November and December transactions of MicroTrain Company would be journalized.
As shown in Exhibit 11, you skip a line between journal entries to show where one journal entry ends and another begins.
This procedure is standard practice among accountants.
Note that no dollar signs appear in journals or ledgers.
When amounts are in even dollar amounts, accountants leave the cents column blank or use zeros or a dash.
When they use lined accounting work p. 109 of 433 papers, commas or decimal points are not needed to record an amount.
When they use unlined paper, they add both commas and decimal points.
Next, observe Exhibit 12, the three-column general ledger accounts of MicroTrain Company after the journal entries have been posted.
Each ledger account would appear on a separate page in the ledger.
Trace the postings from the general journal to the general ledger to make sure you know how to post journal entries.
All the journal entries illustrated so far have involved one debit and one credit; these journal entries are called simple journal entries.
Many business transactions, however, affect more than two accounts.
The journal entry for these transactions involves more than one debit and/or credit.
Such journal entries are called compound journal entries.
As an illustration of a compound journal entry, assume that on 2011 January 2, MicroTrain Company purchased USD 8,000 of training equipment from Wilson Company.

The general journal entry for MicroTrain Company is: Debit Credit 2011 Jan. 2 Equipment (+A) 8,000 Cash (-A) 2,000 Accounts Payable (+L) 6,000 Training equipment purchased from Wilson Company.
Note that the firm credits two accounts, Cash and Accounts Payable, in this one entry.
However, the dollar totals of the debits and credits are equal.
Periodically, accountants use a trial balance to test the equality of their debits and credits.
A trial balance is a listing of the ledger accounts and their debit or credit balances to determine that debits equal credits in the recording process.
The accounts appear in this order: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, dividends, revenues, and expenses.
Within the assets category, the most liquid (closest to becoming cash) asset appears first and the least liquid appears last.
Within the liabilities, those liabilities with the shortest maturities appear first.
Study Exhibit 13, the trial balance for MicroTrain Company.
Note the listing of the account numbers and account titles on the left, the column for debit balances, the column for credit balances, and the equality of the two totals.
When the trial balance does not balance, try re-totaling the two columns.
If this step does not locate the error, divide the difference in the totals by 2 and then by 9.
If the difference is divisible by 2, you may have transferred a debit-balanced account to the trial balance as a credit, or a credit-balanced account as a debit.
When the difference is divisible by 2, look for an amount in the trial balance that is equal to one-half of the difference.
Thus, if the difference is USD 800, look for an account with a balance of USD 400 and see if it is in the wrong column.
If the difference is divisible by 9, you may have made a transposition error in transferring a balance to the trial balance or a slide error.
A transposition error occurs when two digits are reversed in an amount (e.g.
writing 753 as 573 or 110 as 101).
A slide error occurs when you place a decimal point incorrectly (e.g.
USD 1,500 recorded as USD 15.00).
Thus, when a difference is divisible by 9, compare the trial balance amounts with the general ledger account balances to see if you made a transposition or slide error in transferring the amounts.

At first, things were going smoothly.
He was tall, good looking, and had an outgoing personality.
The president of the company took a liking to him.
However, Larry was somewhat bothered when the president started asking him to do some things that were slightly unethical.
When he protested mildly, the president said: "Come on, son, this is the way the business world works.
You have great potential if you don't let things like this get in your way."
As time went on, Larry was asked to do things that were more unethical, and finally he was performing illegal acts.
When he resisted, the president appealed to his loyalty and asked him to be a team player.
The president also promised Larry great wealth sometime in the future.
Finally, when he was told to falsify some financial statements by making improper entries and to sign some documents containing material errors, the president supported his request by stating: "You are in too deep now to refuse to cooperate.
If I go down, you are going with me."
Through various company schemes, Larry had convinced some friends and relatives to invest about USD 10 million.
Most of this would be lost if the various company schemes were revealed.
Larry could not sleep at night and began each day with a pain in his stomach and by becoming physically ill.
He was under great strain and believed that he could lose his mind.
He also heard that the president had a shady past and could become violent in retaliating against his enemies.
If Larry blows the whistle, he believes he will go to prison for his part in the schemes.
(Note: This scenario is based on an actual situation with some facts changed to protect the guilty.)
If you still cannot find the error, it may be due to one of the following causes:  Failing to post part of a journal entry.
 Posting a debit as a credit, or vice versa.
 Incorrectly determining the balance of an account.
 Recording the balance of an account incorrectly in the trial balance.
 Omitting an account from the trial balance.
p. 114 of 433  Making a transposition or slide error in the accounts or the journal.
Usually, you should work backward through the steps taken to prepare the trial balance.
Assuming you have already re-totaled the columns and traced the amounts appearing in the trial balance back to the general ledger account balances, use the following steps: Verify the balance of each general ledger account, verify postings to the general ledger, verify general journal entries, and then review the transactions and possibly the source documents.
The equality of the two totals in the trial balance does not necessarily mean that the accounting process has been error-free.
Serious errors may have been made, such as failure to record a transaction, or posting a debit or credit to the wrong account.
For instance, if a transaction involving payment of a USD 100 account payable is never recorded, the trial balance totals still balance, but at an amount that is USD 100 too high.
Both cash and accounts payable would be overstated by USD 100.
You can prepare a trial balance at any time—at the end of a day, a week, a month, a quarter, or a year.
Typically, you would prepare a trial balance before preparing the financial statements.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology The computers of persons in a given department or building are frequently connected in a Local Area Network (LAN).
These persons can then access simultaneously the programs and databases stored in the LAN and can communicate with all other persons in the LAN through email.
A more advanced type of computer network is called Client/Server Computing.
Under this structure, any computer in the network can be used to update the information stored elsewhere in the network.
For example, accounting information stored in one computer could be updated by authorized persons from a number of other computers in the system.
The use of networks is designed to improve efficiency and to reduce software and hardware costs.
3.10 Analyzing and using the financial results— Horizontal and vertical analyses The calculation of dollar and/or percentage changes from one year to the next in an item on financial statements is horizontal analysis.
For instance, in the following data taken from the 2000 annual report of Hewlett-Packard Company, the amount of inventory increased by USD 836 million from 1999 October 31, to 2000 October 31.
This amount represented a 17 per cent increase.
To find the p. 115 of 433 amount of the increase or decrease, subtract the 1999 amount from the 2000 amount.
To find the percentage change, divide the increase or decrease by the 1999 amount.
Knowing the dollar amount and percentage of change in an amount is much more meaningful than merely knowing the amount at one point in time.
By analyzing the data, we can see that cash and cash equivalents declined in 2000.
Their decline at least partially explains the increases in some of the other current assets.
We can also see that the company invested in property, plant and equipment.
Any terms in Hewlett-Packard's list of assets that you do not understand are explained in later chapters.
At this point, all we want you to understand is the nature of horizontal and vertical analyses.
Vertical analysis shows the percentage that each item in a financial statement is of some significant total such as total assets or sales.
For instance, in the Hewlett-Packard data we can see that cash and cash equivalents were 15.3 per cent of total assets as of 1999 October 31, and had declined to 10.0 per cent of total assets by 2000 October 31.
Total current assets (cash plus other amounts that will become cash or be used up within one year) increased from 61.3 per cent of total assets to 68.3 per cent during 2000.
Long-term investments and other non-current assets accounted for 18.4 per cent of total assets as of 2000 October 31.
Increase or Percent of (Decrease) Total Assets 2000 over 1999 October 31 2000 1999 Dollars Percent 2000 1999 Assets (in millions) Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,415 $ 5,411 $ (1,996) -37% 10.0% 15.3% Short-term investments 592 179 413 231% 1.7% 0.5% Accounts receivable 6,394 5,958 436 7% 18.8% 16.9% Financing receivables 2,174 1,889 285 15% 6.4% 5.4% Inventory 5,699 4,863 836 17% 16.8% 13.8% Other current assets 4,970 3,342 1,628 49% 14.6% 9.5% Total current assets $ 23,244 $ 21,642 $ 1,602 7% 68.3% 61.3% Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, net 4,500 4,333 167 4% 13.2% 12.3% Long-term investments and other non-current assets 6,265 9,322 (3,057) -33% 18.4% 26.4% Total assets $ 34,009 $ 35,297 $ (1,288) -4% 100.0% 100.0% Management performs horizontal and vertical analyses along with other forms of analysis to help evaluate the wisdom of its past decisions and to plan for the future.
Other data would have to be examined before decisions could be made regarding the assets shown.
For instance, if you discovered the liabilities that would have to be paid within a short time by Hewlett-Packard were more than USD 30 billion, you might conclude that the company is short of cash even though current assets increased p. 116 of 433 substantially during 2000.
We illustrate horizontal and vertical analyses to a much greater extent later in the text.
An accounting perspective: Business insight Many companies have been restructuring their organizations and reducing the number of employees to cut expenses.
General Motors, AT&T, IBM, and numerous other companies have taken this action.
One could question whether companies place as much value on their employees as in the past.
In previous years it was common to see the following statement in the annual reports of companies: "Our employees are our most valuable asset".
Companies are not permitted to show employees as assets on their balance sheets.
Do you think they should be allowed to do so?
What you have learned in this chapter is basic to your study of accounting.
The entire process of accounting is based on the double-entry concept.
Chapter 3 explains that adjustments bring the accounts to their proper balances before accurate financial statements are prepared.
3.10.1 Understanding the learning objectives  An account is a storage unit used to classify and summarize money measurements of business activities of a similar nature.
 A firm sets up an account whenever it needs to provide useful information about a particular business item to some party having a valid interest in the business.
 A T-account resembles the letter T.  Debits are entries on the left side of a T-account.
 Credits are entries on the right side of a T-account.
 Debits increase asset, expense, and Dividends accounts.
 Credits increase liability, stockholders' equity, and revenue accounts.
 Analyze transactions by examining source documents.
 Journalize transactions in the journal.
 Post journal entries to the accounts in the ledger.
 Prepare a trial balance of the accounts and complete the work sheet.
 Prepare financial statements.
p. 117 of 433  Journalize and post adjusting entries.
 Journalize and post closing entries.
Prepare a post-closing trial balance.
 A journal contains a chronological record of the transactions of a business.
An example of a general journal is shown in Exhibit 11.
Journalizing is the process of entering a transaction in a journal.
 Posting is the process of transferring information recorded in the journal to the proper places in the ledger.
 Cross-indexing is the placing of (1) the account number of the ledger account in the general journal and (2) the general journal page number in the ledger account.
 An example of cross-indexing appears in Exhibit 10.
 A trial balance is a listing of the ledger accounts and their debit or credit balances.
 If the trial balance does not balance, an accountant works backward to discover the error.
 A trial balance is shown in Exhibit 13.
 Horizontal analysis involves calculating the dollar and/or percentage changes in an item from one year to the next.
 Vertical analysis shows the percentage that each item in a financial statement is of some significant total.

p. 140 of 433 Annual report analysis C In The Home Depot's recent Annual Report, the following passages appear: The primary key to our success is our 39,000 employees who wear those orange aprons you see in our stores.
Few great achievements—in business or in any aspect of life—are reached and sustained without the support and involvement of large numbers of people committed to shared values and goals they deem worthy.
Indeed, one need look no further than the business section of the morning newspaper to read of how yet another "blue chip" American business, entrenched in and isolated by its own bureaucracy, has lost the support of its employees and customers...
Frankly, the biggest difference between The Home Depot and our competitors is not the products on our shelves, it is our people and their ability to forge strong bonds of loyalty and trust with our customers...
...Contrary to conventional management wisdom, those at the top of organization charts are not the source of all wisdom.
Many of our best ideas come from the people who work on the sales floor.
We encourage our employees to challenge senior management directives if they feel strongly enough about their dissenting opinions... ...We want our people to be themselves and to be bold enough to apply their talents as individuals.
Certainly, people can often perceive great risk acting this way.
Thus, we go to great lengths to empower our employees to be mavericks, to express differences of opinion without fear of being fired or demoted...We do everything we can to make people feel challenged and inspired at work instead of being threatened and made to feel insecure.
An organization can, after all, accomplish more when people work together instead of against each other.
Write answers to the following questions: a.
Do you think The Home Depot management regards its employees more as expenses or assets?
Explain.
b.
What does The Home Depot regard as its most valuable asset?

4.2 A career as a tax specialist While most students are aware that accountants frequently assist their clients with tax returns and other tax issues, few are aware of the large number of diverse and challenging careers available in the field of taxation.
Nearly all public accounting firms, ranging from the “Big 4” international firms to the sole practitioner, generate a significant portion of their fees through tax compliance, planning and consulting.
With over 155 million individual tax returns filed in the US every year, it is not surprising that many individuals and most businesses need assistance in dealing with the incredibly complex US and international tax laws.
This complexity also provides tremendous tax planning opportunities.
As a tax specialist, you will show individual clients how to reduce their taxes while simultaneously helping them make decisions about investing, buying a house, funding their children’s education, and planning their retirement.
For your business clients, careful planning and structuring of business investments and transactions can save millions of dollars in taxes.
In fact, it is safe to say that very few significant business transactions take place without the careful guidance of a tax specialist.
A career in taxation is by no means limited to public accounting.
Because there are so many types of taxes impacting so many aspects of our lives, tax specialists act as consultants in a large number of fields.
For example, many companies offer deferred compensation or stock bonus plans to their executives.
Nearly all companies provide some sort of pension or other retirement plan for their employees, as well as health care benefits.
Significant tax savings can be generated for both the company and their employees if these benefits are structured correctly.
In response to the amazing complexity of our tax laws, many schools offer masters degrees specializing in tax.
Such a degree is not required to specialize in tax, but does offer students a significant advantage if they want to pursue a career in taxation.
In a recent survey of 1,400 chief financial officers, the top two responses to the p. 144 of 433 question “which one of the following areas of specialization would you recommend to someone just beginning his or her career in accounting?” were personal financial planning and tax accounting.
These responses reflect the indisputable fact that as the US demographic includes more wealthy, and older, Americans than ever before, professional tax guidance will be in ever-increasing demand.
The career paths outlined above do not nearly cover all of the many professional options available to tax specialists.
For example, are you concerned that a traditional tax accounting job may be too tame for you?
Special agents of the IRS routinely participate in criminal investigations and arrests, working closely with other federal law enforcement agencies.
Are you interested in law?
Accounting offers an ideal undergraduate degree for aspiring business and tax attorneys.
If you think you may be interested in a career as a tax specialist, be sure to consult with one of your school’s tax professors about the many job opportunities this field provides.
Chapters 1 and 2 introduced the accounting process of analyzing, classifying, and summarizing business transactions into accounts.
You learned how these transactions are entered into the journal and posted to the ledger accounts.
You also know how to use the trial balance to test the equality of debits and credits in the journalizing and posting process.
The purpose of the accounting process is to produce accurate financial statements so they may be used for making sound business decisions.
At this point in your study of accounting, you are concentrating on three financial statements—the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, and the balance sheet.
Detailed coverage of the statement of cash flows appears in Chapter 16.
When you began to analyze business transactions in Chapter 1, you saw that the evidence of the transaction is usually a source document.
It is any written or printed evidence that describes the essential facts of a business transaction.
Examples are receipts for cash paid or received, checks written or received, bills sent to customers, or bills received from suppliers.
The giving, receiving, or creating of source documents triggered the journal entries made in Chapter 2.
The journal entries we discuss in this chapter are adjusting entries.
The arrival of the end of the accounting period triggers adjusting entries.
Accountants use adjusting entries to bring accounts to their proper balances before preparing financial statements.
In this chapter, you learn the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting.
Then you learn about the classes and types of adjusting entries and how to prepare them.
4.3 Cash versus accrual basis accounting Professionals such as physicians and lawyers and some relatively small businesses may account for their revenues and expenses on a cash basis.
The cash basis of accounting recognizes revenues p. 145 of 433 when cash is received and recognizes expenses when cash is paid out.
For example, under the cash basis, a company would treat services rendered to clients in 2010 for which the company collected cash in 2011 as 2011 revenues.
Similarly, under the cash basis, a company would treat expenses incurred in 2010 for which the company disbursed cash in 2011 as 2011 expenses.
Under the “pure” cash basis, even the purchase of a building would be debited to an expense.
However, under the “modified” cash basis, the purchase of long-lived assets (such as a building) would be debited to an asset and depreciated (gradually charged to expense) over its useful life.
Normally the “modified” cash basis is used by those few individuals and small businesses that use the cash basis.
Cash Basis Accrual Basis Revenues are recognized As cash is received As earned (goods are delivered or services are performed) Expenses are recognized As cash is paid As incurred to produce revenues Exhibit 14: Cash basis and accrual basis of accounting compared Because the cash basis of accounting does not match expenses incurred and revenues earned, it is generally considered theoretically unacceptable.
The cash basis is acceptable in practice only under those circumstances when it approximates the results that a company could obtain under the accrual basis of accounting.
Companies using the cash basis do not have to prepare any adjusting entries unless they discover they have made a mistake in preparing an entry during the accounting period.
Under certain circumstances, companies may use the cash basis for income tax purposes.
Throughout the text we use the accrual basis of accounting, which matches expenses incurred and revenues earned, because most companies use the accrual basis.
The accrual basis of accounting recognizes revenues when sales are made or services are performed, regardless of when cash is received.
Expenses are recognized as incurred, whether or not cash has been paid out.
For instance, assume a company performs services for a customer on account.
Although the company has received no cash, the revenue is recorded at the time the company performs the service.
Later, when the company receives the cash, no revenue is recorded because the company has already recorded the revenue.
Under the accrual basis, adjusting entries are needed to bring the accounts up to date for unrecorded economic activity that has taken place.
In Exhibit 14, shown below, we show when revenues and expenses are recognized under the cash basis and under the accrual basis.
p. 146 of 433  4.4 The need for adjusting entries The income statement of a business reports all revenues earned and all expenses incurred to generate those revenues during a given period.
An income statement that does not report all revenues and expenses is incomplete, inaccurate, and possibly misleading.
Similarly, a balance sheet that does not report all of an entity’s assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity at a specific time may be misleading.
Each adjusting entry has a dual purpose: (1) to make the income statement report the proper revenue or expense and (2) to make the balance sheet report the proper asset or liability.
Thus, every adjusting entry affects at least one income statement account and one balance sheet account.
January 30 February 9 March 16 April 8 May 18 June 49 July 8 August 14 September 42 October 17 November 13 Subtotal 224 December 376 Total Companies 600 Source' American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting Trends & Techniques (New York' AICPA, 2004) p39 Exhibit 15: Summary-fiscal year ending by month Since those interested in the activities of a business need timely information, companies must prepare financial statements periodically.
To prepare such statements, the accountant divides an entity’s life into time periods.
These time periods are usually equal in length and are called accounting periods.
An accounting period may be one month, one quarter, or one year.
An accounting year, or fiscal year, is an accounting period of one year.
A fiscal year is any 12 consecutive months.
The fiscal year may or may not coincide with the calendar year, which ends on December 31.
As we show in Exhibit 15, 63 per cent of the companies surveyed in 2004 had fiscal years that coincide with the calendar year.
In 2008, the comparable figure for publicly-traded companies in the US was 65 per cent.
Companies in certain industries often have a fiscal year that differs from the calendar year.
For instance many retail stores end their fiscal year on January 31 to avoid closing their books during their peak sales period.
Other companies select a fiscal year ending at a time when inventories and business activity are lowest.
Periodic reporting and the matching principle necessitate the preparation of adjusting entries.
Adjusting entries are journal entries made at the end of an accounting period or at any time p. 147 of 433 financial statements are to be prepared to bring about a proper matching of revenues and expenses.
The matching principle requires that expenses incurred in producing revenues be deducted from the revenues they generated during the accounting period.
The matching principle is one of the underlying principles of accounting.
This matching of expenses and revenues is necessary for the income statement to present an accurate picture of the profitability of a business.
Adjusting entries reflect unrecorded economic activity that has taken place but has not yet been recorded.
Why has the company not recorded this activity by the end of the period?
One reason is that it is more convenient and economical to wait until the end of the period to record the activity.
A second reason is that no source document concerning that activity has yet come to the accountant’s attention.
Adjusting entries bring the amounts in the general ledger accounts to their proper balances before the company prepares its financial statements.
That is, adjusting entries convert the amounts that are actually in the general ledger accounts to the amounts that should be in the general ledger accounts for proper financial reporting.
To make this conversion, the accountants analyze the accounts to determine which need adjustment.
For example, assume a company purchased a three-year insurance policy costing USD 600 at the beginning of the year and debited USD 600 to Prepaid Insurance.
At year-end, the company should remove USD 200 of the cost from the asset and record it as an expense.
Failure to do so misstates assets and net income on the financial statements.
Exhibit 16: Two classes and four types of adjusting entries p. 148 of 433 Companies continuously receive benefits from many assets such as prepaid expenses (e.g.
prepaid insurance and prepaid rent).
Thus, an entry could be made daily to record the expense incurred.
Typically, firms do not make the entry until financial statements are to be prepared.
Therefore, if monthly financial statements are prepared, monthly adjusting entries are required.
By custom, and in some instances by law, businesses report to their owners at least annually.
Accordingly, adjusting entries are required at least once a year.
Remember, however, that the entry transferring an amount from an asset account to an expense account should transfer only the asset cost that has expired.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology Eventually, computers will probably enter adjusting entries continuously on a real- time basis so that up-to-date financial statements can be printed at any time without prior notice.
Computers will be fed the facts concerning activities that would normally result in adjusting entries and instructed to seek any necessary information from their own databases or those of other computers to continually adjust the accounts.
4.5 Classes and types of adjusting entries Adjusting entries fall into two broad classes: deferred (meaning to postpone or delay) items and accrued (meaning to grow or accumulate) items.
Deferred items consist of adjusting entries involving data previously recorded in accounts.
These entries involve the transfer of data already recorded in asset and liability accounts to expense and revenue accounts, respectively.
Accrued items consist of adjusting entries relating to activity on which no data have been previously recorded in the accounts.
These entries involve the initial, or first, recording of assets and liabilities and the related revenues and expenses (see Exhibit 16).
Deferred items consist of two types of adjusting entries: asset/expense adjustments and liability/revenue adjustments.
For example, prepaid insurance and prepaid rent are assets until they are used up; then they become expenses.
Also, unearned revenue is a liability until the company renders the service; then the unearned revenue becomes earned revenue.
Accrued items consist of two types of adjusting entries: asset/revenue adjustments and liability/expense adjustments.
For example, assume a company performs a service for a customer but has not yet billed the customer.
The accountant records this transaction as an asset in the form of a receivable and as revenue because the company has earned a revenue.
Also, assume a company owes p. 149 of 433 its employees salaries not yet paid.
The accountant records this transaction as a liability and an expense because the company has incurred an expense.

Look at Exhibit 17, the trial balance of the MicroTrain Company at 2010 December 31.
As you can see, MicroTrain must adjust several accounts before it can prepare accurate financial statements.
The adjustments for these accounts involve data already recorded in the company’s accounts.
In making adjustments for MicroTrain Company, we must add several accounts to the company’s chart of accounts shown in Chapter 2.
These new accounts are: Type of Account Acct.
Account Title Description Asset No.

*Accountants deduct the balance of a contra asset from the balance of the related reasons for using a asset account on the balance sheet.
We explain the contra asset account later in the chapter.
Now you are ready to follow as MicroTrain Company makes its adjustments for deferred items.
If you find the process confusing, review the beginning of this chapter so you clearly understand the purpose of adjusting entries.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology It is difficult to name a publicly owned company that does not provide an extensive website.
In fact, websites have become an important link between companies and their investors.
Most websites will have a link titled investor relations or merely company information which provides a wealth of financial information ranging from audited financial statements to charts of the company's stock prices.
As an example, check out the Gap, Incs website at: http://www.gapinc.com Browse the Gap site and see for yourself the comprehensiveness of the financial information available there.
4.6 Adjustments for deferred items This section discusses the two types of adjustments for deferred items: asset/expense adjustments and liability/revenue adjustments.
In the asset/expense group, you learn how to prepare adjusting entries for prepaid expenses and depreciation.
In the liability/revenue group, you learn how to prepare adjusting entries for unearned revenues.
MicroTrain Company must make several asset/expense adjustments for prepaid expenses.
A prepaid expense is an asset awaiting assignment to expense, such as prepaid insurance, prepaid rent, and supplies on hand.
Note that the nature of these three adjustments is the same.
Prepaid insurance When a company pays an insurance policy premium in advance, the purchase creates the asset, prepaid insurance.
This advance payment is an asset because the company will p. 151 of 433 receive insurance coverage in the future.
With the passage of time, however, the asset gradually expires.
The portion that has expired becomes an expense.
To illustrate this point, recall that in Chapter 2, MicroTrain Company purchased for cash an insurance policy on its trucks for the period 2010 December 1, to 2011 November 30.
The journal entry made on 2010 December 1, to record the purchase of the policy was: 2010 Dec. 1 Prepaid Insurance 2,400 Cash 2400 Purchased truck insurance to cover a one-year period.
The two accounts relating to insurance are Prepaid Insurance (an asset) and Insurance Expense (an expense).
After posting this entry, the Prepaid Insurance account has a USD 2,400 debit balance on 2010 December 1.
The Insurance Expense account has a zero balance on 2010 December 1, because no time has elapsed to use any of the policy’s benefits.
(Dr.) Prepaid Insurance (Cr) (Dr.) Insurance Expense (Cr) 2010 2010 Dec. 1 Dec. 1 Bal.
2,400 Bal.
-0- By 2010 December 31, one month of the year covered by the policy has expired.
Therefore, part of the service potential (or benefit obtained from the asset) has expired.
The asset now provides less future services or benefits than when the company acquired it.
We recognize this reduction by treating the cost of the services received from the asset as an expense.
For the MicroTrain Company example, the service received was one month of insurance coverage.
Since the policy provides the same services for every month of its one-year life, we assign an equal amount (USD 200) of cost to each month.
Thus, 1 MicroTrain charges /12 of the annual premium to Insurance Expense on 2010 December 31.
The adjusting journal entry is: 2010 Dec. 31 Insurance Expense 200 Adjustment Prepaid Insurance 200 1—Insurance p. 152 of 433 To record insurance expense for December.
After posting these two journal entries, the accounts in T-account format appear as follows: (Dr.) Prepaid Insurance (Cr) 2010 2010 Dec. 1 Purchased Dec. 31 Adjustment 1 200 on account 2,400 Decreased by $200 2,200 Bal.
After adjustment (Dr.) Insurance Expense (Cr.)
Increased by 2010 $200 31 Adjustment 1 200 In practice, accountants do not use T-accounts.
Instead, they use three-column ledger accounts that have the advantage of showing a balance after each transaction.
After posting the preceding two entries, the three-column ledger accounts appear as follows: Prepaid Insurance Date Explanation Post Ref.
Debit Credit Balance Dec. 2010 1 Purchased on Account G1 2400 2400 Dr. 31 Adjustment G3* 200 2200 Dr. Insurance Expense Date Explanation Post Ref.
Debit Credit Balance Dec. 2010 31 Adjustment G3* 200 200 Dr. *Assumed page number Before this adjusting entry was made, the entire USD 2,400 insurance payment made on 2010 December 1, was a prepaid expense for 12 months of protection.
So on 2010 December 31, one month of protection had passed, and an adjusting entry transferred USD 200 of the USD 2,400 (USD 2,400/12 = USD 200) to Insurance Expense.
On the income statement for the year ended 2010 December 31, MicroTrain reports one month of insurance expense, USD 200, as one of the expenses it incurred in generating that year’s revenues.
It reports the remaining amount of the prepaid expense, USD 2,200, as an asset on the balance sheet.
The USD 2,200 prepaid expense represents 11 months of insurance protection that remains as a future benefit.
Prepaid rent Prepaid rent is another example of the gradual consumption of a previously recorded asset.
Assume a company pays rent in advance to cover more than one accounting period.
On p. 153 of 433 the date it pays the rent, the company debits the prepayment to the Prepaid Rent account (an asset account).
The company has not yet received benefits resulting from this expenditure.
Thus, the expenditure creates an asset.
We measure rent expense similarly to insurance expense.
Generally, the rental contract specifies the amount of rent per unit of time.
If the prepayment covers a three-month rental, we charge one-third of this rental to each month.
Notice that the amount charged is the same each month even though some months have more days than other months.
For example, MicroTrain Company paid USD 1,200 rent in advance on 2010 December 28, to cover a three-month period beginning on that date.
The journal entry would be: 2010 Dec. 1 Prepaid Rent 1,200 Cash 1,200 Paid three months' rent on a building.
The two accounts relating to rent are Prepaid Rent (an asset) and Rent Expense.
After this entry is posted, the Prepaid Rent account has a USD 1,200 balance and the Rent Expense account has a zero balance because no part of the rent period has yet elapsed.
(Dr.) Prepaid Rent (Cr) (Dr.) Rent Expense (Cr) 2010 2010 Dec. 1 Dec. 1 Bal.
Cash Paid 1,200 Bal.
-0- On 2010 December 31, MicroTrain must prepare an adjusting entry.
Since one third of the period covered by the prepaid rent has elapsed, it charges one-third of the USD 1,200 of prepaid rent to expense.
The required adjusting entry is: 2010 Dec.
Adjustment 31 Rent Expense 400 2—Rent Prepaid Rent To record rent expense for December 400 p. 154 of 433 After posting this adjusting entry, the T-accounts appear as follows: (Dr.) Prepaid Rent (Cr) 2010 1,200 2010 Dec. 31 Decreased Dec. 1 Cash Paid Adjustment 2 400 Bal.
after adjustment 800 by $400 (Dr.) Rent Expense (Cr) Increased by 2010 400 $400 Dec. 31 Adjustment 2 The USD 400 rent expense appears in the income statement for the year ended 2010 December 31.
MicroTrain reports the remaining USD 800 of prepaid rent as an asset in the balance sheet on 2010 December 31.
Thus, the adjusting entries have accomplished their purpose of maintaining the accuracy of the financial statements.
Supplies on hand Almost every business uses supplies in its operations.
It may classify supplies simply as supplies (to include all types of supplies), or more specifically as office supplies (paper, stationery, floppy diskettes, pencils), selling supplies (gummed tape, string, paper bags, cartons, wrapping paper), or training supplies (transparencies, training manuals).
Frequently, companies buy supplies in bulk.
These supplies are an asset until the company uses them.
This asset may be called supplies on hand or supplies inventory.
Even though these terms indicate a prepaid expense, the firm does not use prepaid in the asset’s title.
On 2010 December 4, MicroTrain Company purchased supplies for USD 1,400 and recorded the transaction as follows: 2010 Dec. 4 Supplies on Hand 1,400 Cash 1,400 To record the purchase of supplies for future use.
MicroTrain’s two accounts relating to supplies are Supplies on Hand (an asset) and Supplies Expense.
After this entry is posted, the Supplies on Hand account shows a debit balance of USD 1,400 and the Supplies Expense account has a zero balance as shown in the following T-accounts: (Dr.) Supplies On Hand (Cr.)
(Dr.) Supplies Expense (Cr.)
2010 2010 Dec. 4 Dec. 4 Bal.
Cash Paid 1,400 Bal.
-0- An actual physical inventory (a count of the supplies on hand) at the end of the month showed only USD 900 of supplies on hand.
Thus, the company must have used USD 500 of supplies in December.
p. 155 of 433 An adjusting journal entry brings the two accounts pertaining to supplies to their proper balances.
The adjusting entry recognizes the reduction in the asset (Supplies on Hand) and the recording of an expense (Supplies Expense) by transferring USD 500 from the asset to the expense.
According to the physical inventory, the asset balance should be USD 900 and the expense balance, USD 500.
So MicroTrain makes the following adjusting entry: 2010 Dec. 31 Supplies Expense 500 Adjustment Supplies on Hand 500 3—Supplies To record supplies used during December.
After posting this adjusting entry, the T-accounts appear as follows: (Dr.) Supplies on Hand (Cr) 2010 2010 Decreased by $500 Dec. 4 Cash Paid 1,400 Dec. 31 Adjustment 3 500 Bal.
after 900 adjustment (Dr.) Supplies Expense (Cr.)
Increased by 2010 500 $500 Dec 31 Adjustment 3 The entry to record the use of supplies could be made when the supplies are issued from the storeroom.
However, such careful accounting for small items each time they are issued is usually too costly a procedure.
Accountants make adjusting entries for supplies on hand, like for any other prepaid expense, before preparing financial statements.
Supplies expense appears in the income statement.
Supplies on hand is an asset in the balance sheet.
Sometimes companies buy assets relating to insurance, rent, and supplies knowing that they will use them up before the end of the current accounting period (usually one month or one year).
If so, an expense account is usually debited at the time of purchase rather than debiting an asset account.
This procedure avoids having to make an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period.
Sometimes, too, a company debits an expense even though the asset will benefit more than the current period.
Then, at the end of the accounting period, the firm’s adjusting entry transfers some of the cost from the expense to the asset.
For instance, assume that on January 1, a company paid USD 1,200 rent to cover a three-year period and debited the USD 1,200 to Rent Expense.
At the end of the year, it transfers USD 800 from Rent Expense to Prepaid Rent.
To simplify our approach, we will consistently debit the asset when the asset will benefit more than the current accounting period.
p. 156 of 433 Depreciation Just as prepaid insurance and prepaid rent indicate a gradual using up of a previously recorded asset, so does depreciation.
However, the overall time involved in using up a depreciable asset (such as a building) is much longer and less definite than for prepaid expenses.
Also, a prepaid expense generally involves a fairly small amount of money.
Depreciable assets, however, usually involve larger sums of money.
A depreciable asset is a manufactured asset such as a building, machine, vehicle, or piece of equipment that provides service to a business.
In time, these assets lose their utility because of (1) wear and tear from use or (2) obsolescence due to technological change.
Since companies gradually use up these assets over time, they record depreciation expense on them.
Depreciation expense is the amount of asset cost assigned as an expense to a particular period.
The process of recording depreciation expense is called depreciation accounting.
The three factors involved in computing depreciation expense are:  Asset cost.
The asset cost is the amount that a company paid to purchase the depreciable asset.
 Estimated residual value.
The estimated residual value (scrap value) is the amount that the company can probably sell the asset for at the end of its estimated useful life.
 Estimated useful life.
The estimated useful life of an asset is the estimated time that a company can use the asset.
Useful life is an estimate, not an exact measurement, that a company must make in advance.
However, sometimes the useful life is determined by company policy (e.g.
keep a fleet of automobiles for three years).
Accountants use different methods for recording depreciation.
The method illustrated here is the straight-line method.
We discuss other depreciation methods in Chapter 10.
Straight-line depreciation assigns the same amount of depreciation expense to each accounting period over the life of the asset.
The depreciation formula (straight-line) to compute straight-line depreciation for a one-year period is: Assetcost–Estimatedresidualvalue Annualdeprecation= Estimatedyearsofusefullife To illustrate the use of this formula, recall that on December 1, MicroTrain Company purchased four small trucks at a cost of USD 40,000.
The journal entry was: 2010 Dec. 1 Trucks 40,000 Cash 40,000 To record the purchase of four trucks.
p. 157 of 433 The estimated residual value for each truck was USD 1,000, so MicroTrain estimated the total residual value for all four trucks at USD 4,000.
The company estimated the useful life of each truck to be four years.
Using the straight-line depreciation formula, MicroTrain calculated the annual depreciation on the trucks as follows: USD40,000–USD4,000 Annual deprecation = =USD9,000 4years 1 The amount of depreciation expense for one month would be /12 of the annual amount.
Thus, depreciation expense for December is USD 9,000 ÷ 12 = USD 750.
The difference between an asset’s cost and its estimated residual value is an asset’s depreciable amount.
To satisfy the matching principle, the firm must allocate the depreciable amount as an expense to the various periods in the asset’s useful life.
It does this by debiting the amount of depreciation for a period to a depreciation expense account and crediting the amount to an accumulated depreciation account.
MicroTrain’s depreciation on its delivery trucks for December is USD 750.
The company records the depreciation as follows: 2010 Dec. 31 Depreciation Expense – Trucks 750 Accumulated Depreciation - Trucks 750 Adjusted 4- Depreciation To record depreciation expense for December.
After posting the adjusting entry, the T-accounts appear as follow: (Dr.) Depreciation Expense—Trucks (Cr) Increased by 2010 $750 Dec 31 Adjustment 4 750 (Dr.) Accumulated Depreciation—Trucks (Cr.)
Increased by $750 (book value of asset decreased) 2010 Dec. 31 Adjustment 4 750 MicroTrain reports depreciation expense in its income statement.
And it reports accumulated depreciation in the balance sheet as a deduction from the related asset.
p. 158 of 433 The accumulated depreciation account is a contra asset account that shows the total of all depreciation recorded on the asset from the date of acquisition up through the balance sheet date.
A contra asset account is a deduction from the asset to which it relates in the balance sheet.
The purpose of a contra asset account is to reduce the original cost of the asset down to its remaining undepreciated cost or book value.
The accumulated depreciation account does not represent cash that is being set aside to replace the worn out asset.
The undepreciated cost of the asset is the debit balance in the asset account (original cost) minus the credit balance in the accumulated depreciation contra account.
Accountants also refer to an asset’s cost less accumulated depreciation as the book value (or net book value) of the asset.
Thus, book value is the cost not yet allocated to an expense.
In the previous example, the book value of the equipment after the first month is: Cost USD 40,000 Less: Accumulated depreciation 750 Book value (or cost not yet allocated to as an expense) 39,250 MicroTrain credits the depreciation amount to an accumulated depreciation account, which is a contra asset, rather than directly to the asset account.
Companies use contra accounts when they want to show statement readers the original amount of the account to which the contra account relates.
For instance, for the asset Trucks, it is useful to know both the original cost of the asset and the total accumulated depreciation amount recorded on the asset.
Therefore, the asset account shows the original cost.
The contra account, Accumulated Depreciation—Trucks, shows the total amount of recorded depreciation from the date of acquisition.
By having both original cost and the accumulated depreciation amounts, a user can estimate the approximate percentage of the benefits embodied in the asset that the company has consumed.
For instance, assume the accumulated depreciation amount is about three-fourths the cost of the asset.
Then, the benefits would be approximately three-fourths consumed, and the company may have to replace the asset soon.
Thus, to provide more complete balance sheet information to users of financial statements, companies show both the original acquisition cost and accumulated depreciation.
In the preceding example for adjustment 4, the balance sheet at 2010 December 31, would show the asset and contra asset as follows: Assets Trucks USD 40,000 Less: Accumulated deprecation 750 USD 39,250 p. 159 of 433 As you may expect, the accumulated depreciation account balance increases each period by the amount of depreciation expense recorded until the remaining book value of the asset equals the estimated residual value.
A liability/revenue adjustment involving unearned revenues covers situations in which a customer has transferred assets, usually cash, to the selling company before the receipt of merchandise or services.
Receiving assets before they are earned creates a liability called unearned revenue.
The firm debits such receipts to the asset account Cash and credits a liability account.
The liability account credited may be Unearned Fees, Revenue Received in Advance, Advances by Customers, or some similar title.
The seller must either provide the services or return the customer’s money.
By performing the services, the company earns revenue and cancels the liability.
Companies receive advance payments for many items, such as training services, delivery services, tickets, and magazine or newspaper subscriptions.
Although we illustrate and discuss only advanced receipt of training fees, firms treat the other items similarly.
Unearned service fees On December 7, MicroTrain Company received USD 4,500 from a customer in payment for future training services.
The firm recorded the following journal entry: 2010 Dec. 7 Cash 4,500 Unearned Service Fees 4,500 To record the receipt of cash from a customer in payment for future training services.
The two T-accounts relating to training fees are Unearned Service Fees (a liability) and Service Revenue.
These accounts appear as follows on 2010 December 31 (before adjustment): (Dr.) Unearned Service Fees (Cr.)
2010 Dec. 7 Cash received in advance 4,500 (Dr.) Service Revenue (Cr.)
2010 Bal.
before adjustment 10,700* *The $10,700 balance came from transactions discussed in Chapter 2.
The balance in the Unearned Service Fees liability account established when MicroTrain received the cash will be converted into revenue as the company performs the training services.
Before MicroTrain prepares its financial statements, it must make an adjusting entry to transfer the amount of the services performed by the company from a liability account to a revenue account.
If we assume that p. 160 of 433 MicroTrain earned one-third of the USD 4,500 in the Unearned Service Fees account by December 31, then the company transfers USD 1,500 to the Service Revenue account as follows: 2010 Dec.
Adjustment 5— 31 Unearned Service Fees 1,500 Revenue earned Service Revenue 1,500 To transfer a portion of training fees from the liability account to the revenue account.
After posting the adjusting entry, the T-accounts would appear as follows: Decreased by (Dr.) Unearned Service Fees (Cr.)
$1,500 2010 2010 2010 Dec. 31 Adjustment 5 1,500 Dec. 7 Cash received in advance 4,500 Bal.

before adjustment Dec. 31 1,500 $1,500 Adjustment 5 Bal.
after adjustment 12,200 MicroTrain reports the service revenue in its income statement for 2010.
The company reports the USD 3,000 balance in the Unearned Service Fees account as a liability in the balance sheet.
In 2011, the company will likely earn the USD 3,000 and transfer it to a revenue account.
If MicroTrain does not perform the training services, the company would have to refund the money to the training service customers.
For instance, assume that MicroTrain could not perform the remaining USD 3,000 of training services and would have to refund the money.
Then, the company would make the following entry: Unearned Service Fees 3,000 Cash 3,000 To record the refund of unearned training fees.
Thus, the company must either perform the training services or refund the fees.
This fact should strengthen your understanding that unearned service fees and similar items are liabilities.
p. 161 of 433 Accountants make the adjusting entries for deferred items for data already recorded in a company’s asset and liability accounts.
They also make adjusting entries for accrued items, which we discuss in the next section, for business data not yet recorded in the accounting records.
An accounting perspective: Business insight According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, the average offer to an accounting major in 2009 was USD 48,334 and tends to increase each year.
According to recent surveys, the market for accounting graduates remains brisk.
Often, one of the chief problems for graduates is how to handle multiple job offers.
As a result of the low unemployment rate, employers—especially small accounting firms with limited recruiting budgets—are doing whatever they can to grab qualified candidates.
4.7 Adjustments for accrued items Accrued items require two types of adjusting entries: asset/revenue adjustments and liability/expense adjustments.
The first group—asset/revenue adjustments—involves accrued assets; the second group—liability/expense adjustments—involves accrued liabilities.
Accrued assets are assets, such as interest receivable or accounts receivable, that have not been recorded by the end of an accounting period.
These assets represent rights to receive future payments that are not due at the balance sheet date.
To present an accurate picture of the affairs of the business on the balance sheet, firms recognize these rights at the end of an accounting period by preparing an adjusting entry to correct the account balances.
To indicate the dual nature of these adjustments, they record a related revenue in addition to the asset.
We also call these adjustments accrued revenues because the revenues must be recorded.
Interest revenue Savings accounts literally earn interest moment by moment.
Rarely is payment of the interest made on the last day of the accounting period.
Thus, the accounting records normally do not show the interest revenue earned (but not yet received), which affects the total assets owned by the investor, unless the company makes an adjusting entry.
The adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period debits a receivable account (an asset) and credits a revenue account to record the interest earned and the asset owned.
For example, assume MicroTrain Company has some money in a savings account.
On 2010 December 31, the money on deposit has earned one month’s interest of USD 600, although the p. 162 of 433 company has not received the interest.
An entry must show the amount of interest earned by 2010 December 31, as well as the amount of the asset, interest receivable (the right to receive this interest).
The entry to record the accrual of revenue is: 2010 Adjustment Dec. 31 Interest Receivable 600 6—Interest Interest Revenue 600 revenue accrued To record one month's interest revenue.
The T-accounts relating to interest would appear as follows: (Dr.) Interest Receivable (Cr.)
Increased by 2010 $600 Dec 31 Adjustment 6 600 (Dr.) Interest Revenue (Cr.)
2010 Increased by $600 Dec. 31 Adjustment 6 600.
MicroTrain reports the USD 600 debit balance in Interest Receivable as an asset in the 2010 December 31, balance sheet.
This asset accumulates gradually with the passage of time.
The USD 600 credit balance in Interest Revenue is the interest earned during the month.
Recall that in recording revenue under accrual basis accounting, it does not matter whether the company collects the actual cash during the year or not.
It reports the interest revenue earned during the accounting period in the income statement.
Unbilled training fees A company may perform services for customers in one accounting period while it bills for the services in a different accounting period.
MicroTrain Company performed USD 1,000 of training services on account for a client at the end of December.
Since it takes time to do the paper work, MicroTrain will bill the client for the services in January.
The necessary adjusting journal entry at 2010 December 31, is: Adjustment 7—Unbilled 2010 Accounts Receivable (or Service Fees Receivable) Dec. 31 1,000 Service Revenue 1,000 To record unbilled training services performed in December.
p. 163 of 433 After posting the adjusting entry, the T-accounts appear as follows: (Dr.) Accounts Receivable (Cr.)
2010 Previous bal.
5,200* Dec. 31 Adjustment 7 1,000*_ Bal.
after adjustment 6,200 *This previous balance came from transactions discussed in Chapter 2.
(Dr.) Service Revenue (Cr.)
2010 Bal.
before adjustment 10,700 Dec. 31 Adjustment 5—previously unearned revenue.
1,500 Dec. 31 Adjustment 7 1,000 Bal.
after both adjustments 13200 The service revenue appears in the income statement; the asset, accounts receivable, appears in the balance sheet.
Accrued liabilities are liabilities not yet recorded at the end of an accounting period.
They represent obligations to make payments not legally due at the balance sheet date, such as employee salaries.
At the end of the accounting period, the company recognizes these obligations by preparing an adjusting entry including both a liability and an expense.
For this reason, we also call these obligations accrued expenses.
Salaries The recording of the payment of employee salaries usually involves a debit to an expense account and a credit to Cash.
Unless a company pays salaries on the last day of the accounting period for a pay period ending on that date, it must make an adjusting entry to record any salaries incurred but not yet paid.
MicroTrain Company paid USD 3,600 of salaries on Friday, 2010 December 28, to cover the first four weeks of December.
The entry made at that time was: 2010 Dec. 28 Salaries Expense 3,600 Cash 3,600 Paid training employee salaries for the first four weeks of December.
p. 164 of 433 Assuming that the last day of December 2010 falls on a Monday, this expense account does not show salaries earned by employees for the last day of the month.
Nor does any account show the employer’s obligation to pay these salaries.
The T-accounts pertaining to salaries appear as follows before adjustment: (Dr.) Salaries Expense (Cr) (Dr.) Salaries Payable (Cr) 2010 Dec. 3,600 2010 -0- 28 Dec. 28 Bal.
If salaries are USD 3,600 for four weeks, they are USD 900 per week.
For a five-day workweek, daily salaries are USD 180.
MicroTrain makes the following adjusting entry on December 31 to accrue salaries for one day: 2010 Dec. 31 Salaries Expense 180 Salaries Payable 180 To accrue one day's salaries that were earned but not paid.
After adjustment, the two T-accounts involved appear as follows: (Dr.) Salaries Expense (Cr) 2010 Dec. 28 Bal.
3,600 Dec. 31 Adjustment 8 180 Bal.
after adjustment 3,780 (Dr.) Salaries Payable (Cr.)
2010 180 Increased by Dec. 31 Adjustment 8 $180 Failure to Recognize Effect on Net Income Effect on Balance Sheet Items 1.
Consumption of the benefits of an asset Overstates net income Overstates assets Overstates retained earnings (prepaid expense) 2.
Earning of previously unearned revenues Understates net income Overstates liabilities Understates retained earnings 3.
Accrual of assets Understates net income Understates assets Understates retained earnings 4.
Accrual of liabilities Overstates net income Understates liabilities Overstates retained earnings Exhibit 18: Effects of failure to recognize adjustments The debit in the adjusting journal entry brings the month’s salaries expense up to its correct USD 3,780 amount for income statement purposes.
The credit to Salaries Payable records the USD 180 salary liability to employees.
The balance sheet shows salaries payable as a liability.
p. 165 of 433 Another example of a liability/expense adjustment is when a company incurs interest on a note payable.
The debit would be to Interest Expense, and the credit would be to Interest Payable.
We discuss this adjustment in Chapter 9.
4.8 Effects of failing to prepare adjusting entries Failure to prepare proper adjusting entries causes net income and the balance sheet to be in error.
You can see the effect of failing to record each of the major types of adjusting entries on net income and balance sheet items in Exhibit 18.
Using MicroTrain Company as an example, this chapter has discussed and illustrated many of the typical entries that companies must make at the end of an accounting period.
Later chapters explain other examples of adjusting entries.
4.9 Analyzing and using the financial results—trend percentages It is sometimes more informative to express all the dollar amounts as a percentage of one of the amounts in the base year rather than to look only at the dollar amount of the item in the financial statements.
You can calculate trend percentages by dividing the amount for each year for an item, such as net income or net sales, by the amount of that item for the base year: Currentyearamount Trendpercentage= Baseyearamount To illustrate, assume that ShopaLot, a large retailer, and its subsidiaries reported the following net income for the years ended 2001 January 31, through 2010.
The last column expresses these dollar amounts as a percentage of the 2001 amount.
For instance, we would calculate the 125 per cent for 2002 as: [(USD 1,609,000/USD 1,291,000)5 100] Dollar Amount of Net Income Percentage of (millions) 1991 Net Income 1991 $1,291 100 % 1992 1.609 125 1993 1,995 155 1994 2,333 181 1995 2,681 208 1996 2,740 212 1997 3,056 237 1998 3,526 273 1999 4,430 343 2000 5,377 416 2001 6,295 488 p. 166 of 433 Examining the trend percentages, we can see that ShopaLot's s net income has increased steadily over the 10-year period.
The 2010 net income is over 4 times as much as the 2001 amount.
This is the kind of performance that management and stockholders seek, but do not always get.

4.10 Understanding the learning objectives  The cash basis of accounting recognizes revenues when cash is received and recognizes expenses when cash is paid out.
 The accrual basis of accounting recognizes revenues when sales are made or services are performed, regardless of when cash is received; expenses are recognized as incurred, whether or not cash has been paid out.
 The accrual basis is more generally accepted than the cash basis because it provides a better matching of revenues and expenses.
 Adjusting entries convert the amounts that are actually in the accounts to the amounts that should be in the accounts for proper periodic financial reporting.
 Adjusting entries reflect unrecorded economic activity that has taken place but has not yet been recorded.
 Deferred items consist of adjusting entries involving data previously recorded in accounts.
Adjusting entries in this class normally involve moving data from asset and liability accounts to expense and revenue accounts.
The two types of adjustments within this deferred items class are asset/expense adjustments and liability/revenue adjustments.
 Accrued items consist of adjusting entries relating to activity on which no data have been previously recorded in the accounts.
These entries involve the initial recording of assets and p. 167 of 433 liabilities and the related revenues and expenses.
The two types of adjustments within this accrued items class are asset/revenue adjustments and liability/expense adjustments.
 This chapter illustrates entries for deferred items and accrued items.
 Failure to prepare adjusting entries causes net income and the balance sheet to be in error.
 For a particular item such as sales or net income, select a base year and express all dollar amounts in other years as a percentage of the base year dollar amount.
4.10.1 Demonstration problem Among other items, the trial balance of Korman Company for 2010 December 31, includes the following account balances: Debits Credits Supplies on Hand $ 6,000 Prepaid Rent 25,200 Buildings 200,000 Accumulated Depreciation—Buildings $33,250 Salaries Expense 124,000 Unearned Delivery Fees 4,000 Some of the supplies represented by the USD 6,000 balance of the Supplies on Hand account have been consumed.
An inventory count of the supplies actually on hand at December 31 totaled USD 2,400.
On May 1 of the current year, a rental payment of USD 25,200 was made for 12 months’ rent; it was debited to Prepaid Rent.
The annual depreciation for the buildings is based on the cost shown in the Buildings account less an estimated residual value of USD 10,000.
The estimated useful lives of the buildings are 40 years each.
The salaries expense of USD 124,000 does not include USD 6,000 of unpaid salaries earned since the last payday.
The company has earned one-fourth of the unearned delivery fees by December 31.
Delivery services of USD 600 were performed for a customer, but a bill has not yet been sent.

4.10.6 Questions  Which events during an accounting period trigger the recording of normal journal entries?
Which event triggers the making of adjusting entries?
 Describe the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting.
 Why are adjusting entries necessary?
Why not treat every cash disbursement as an expense and every cash receipt as a revenue when the cash changes hands?
 “Adjusting entries would not be necessary if the ‘pure’ cash basis of accounting were followed (assuming no mistakes were made in recording cash transactions as they occurred).
Under the cash basis, receipts that are of a revenue nature are considered revenue when received, and expenditures that are of an expense nature are considered expenses when paid.
It is the use of the accrual basis of accounting, where an effort is made to match expenses incurred against the revenues they create, that makes adjusting entries necessary.” Do you agree with this statement?
Why?
 Why do accountants not keep all the accounts at their proper balances continuously throughout the period so that adjusting entries would not have to be made before financial statements are prepared?

4.10.10 Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking Business decision case A You have just been hired by Top Executive Employment Agency, Inc., to help prepare adjusting entries at the end of an accounting period.
It becomes obvious to you that management does not seem to have much of an understanding about the necessity or adjusting entries or which accounts might possibly need adjustment.
The first step you take is to prepare the following unadjusted trial balance from the general ledger.
Only those ledger accounts that had end-of-year balances are included in the trial balance.
p. 185 of 433 Debits Credits Cash $ 80,000 Accounts Receivable 28,000 Supplies on Hand 3,000 Prepaid Insurance 2,700 Office Equipment 120,000 Accumulated Depreciation—Office Equipment $ 45,000 Buildings 360,000 Accumulated Depreciation—Buildings 105,000 Accounts Payable 9,000 Loan Payable (Bank) 15,000 Unearned Commission Fees 30,000 Capital Stock 160,000 Retained Earnings 89,300 Commissions Revenue 270,000 Advertising Expense 6,000 Salaries Expense 112,500 Utilities Expense 7,500 Miscellaneous Expense 3,600 $723,300 $723,300 a.
Explain to management why adjusting entries in general are made.
b.
Explain to management why some of the specific accounts appearing in the trial balance may need adjustment and what the nature of each adjustment might be (do not worry about specific dollar amounts).
Business decision case B A friend of yours, Jack Andrews, is quite excited over the opportunity he has to purchase the land and several miscellaneous assets of Drake Bowling Lanes Company for USD 400,000.
Andrews tells you that Mr and Mrs Drake (the sole stockholders in the company) are moving due to Mr Drake’s ill health.
The annual rent on the building and equipment is USD 54,000.
Drake reports that the business earned a profit of USD 100,000 in 2010 (last year).
Andrews believes an annual profit of USD 100,000 on an investment of USD 400,000 is a really good deal.
But, before completing the deal, he asks you to look it over.
You agree and discover the following: Drake has computed his annual profit for 2010 as the sum of his cash dividends plus the increase in the Cash account: Dividends of USD 60,000 + Increase in Cash account of USD 40,000 = USD 100,000 profit.
As buyer of the business, Andrews will take over responsibility for repayment of a USD 300,000 loan (plus interest) on the land.
The land was acquired at a cost of USD 624,000 seven years ago.
An analysis of the Cash account shows the following for 2010: p. 186 of 433 Rental revenues received $465,000 Cash paid out in 2010 for— Salaries paid to employees $260,000 Utilities paid 18,000 Advertising expenses paid 15,000 Supplies purchased and used 24,000 Interest paid on loan 18,000 Loan principal paid 30,000 Cash dividends 60,000 425,000 In crease in cash balance for the year $ 40,000 You also find that the annual rent of USD 54,000, a December utility bill of USD 4,000, and an advertising bill of USD 6,000 have not been paid.
a.
Prepare a written report for Andrews giving your appraisal of Drake Bowling Lanes Company as an investment.
Comment on Drake’s method of computing the annual profit of the business.
b.
Include in your report an approximate income statement for 2010.
Group project C In teams of two or three students, go to the library to locate one company’s annual report for the most recent year.
Identify the name of the company and the major products or services offered, as well as gross revenues, major expenses, and the trend of profits over the last three years.
Calculate trend percentages for revenues, expenses, and profits using the oldest year as the base year.
Each team should write a memorandum to management summarizing the data and commenting on the trend percentages.
The heading of the memorandum should contain the date, to whom it is written, from whom, and the subject matter.
Group project D With one or two other students and using library and internet sources, write a paper on Statement of Accounting Standards No.
106, “Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”.
This standard resulted in some of the largest adjusting entries ever made.
Companies had to record an expense and a liability to account for these costs on an accrual basis.
In the past they typically had recorded this expense on a cash basis, recognizing the expense only when cash was paid to retirees.
Be sure to cite your sources and treat direct quotes properly.
Group project E With one or two other students and using library sources, write a paper on human resource accounting.
Generally accepted accounting principles do not allow “human assets” to p. 187 of 433 be included among assets on the balance sheet.
Why is this?
Be sure to cite your sources and to treat direct quotes properly.

4.10.12 Answers to self-test 4.10.12.1 True-false True.
Every adjusting entry involves either moving previously recorded data from an asset account to an expense account or from a liability account to a revenue account (or in the opposite direction) or simultaneously entering new data in an asset account and a revenue account or in a liability account and an expense account.
True.
A fiscal year is any 12 consecutive months, so all calendar years are also fiscal years.
A calendar year, however, must end on December 31, so it does not include fiscal years that end on any date other than December 31 (such as June 30).
False.
The accumulated depreciation account is a contra asset that shows the total of all depreciation recorded on an asset from its acquisition date up through the balance sheet date.
False.
The Unearned Delivery Fees account is a liability.
As the fees are earned, the amount in that account is transferred to a revenue account.
True.
If an adjusting entry is overlooked and not made, at least one income statement account and one balance sheet account will be incorrect.
4.10.12.2 Multiple-choice d. One-third of the benefits have expired.
Therefore, USD 400 must be moved from the asset (credit) to an expense (debit).
a. USD 1,100 of the supplies have been used, so that amount must be moved from the asset (credit) to an expense (debit).
c. The amount of annual depreciation is determined as (USD 20,000 – USD 5,000) divided by 5 = USD 3,000.
The debit is to Depreciation Expense—Trucks, and the credit is to Accumulated Depreciation—Trucks, a contra asset account.
p. 188 of 433 b.
Each month USD 2,000 would be transferred from the liability account (debit), Unearned Subscription Fees, to a revenue account (credit).
b.
An asset, Interest Receivable, is debited, and Interest Revenue is credited.
a.
The debit would be to Salaries Expense, and the credit would be to Salaries Payable.
p. 189 of 433  5 Completing the accounting cycle 5.1 Learning objectives After studying this chapter, you should be able to:  Summarize the steps in the accounting cycle.
 Prepare a work sheet for a service company.
 Prepare an income statement, statement of retained earnings, and balance sheet using information contained in the work sheet.
 Prepare adjusting and closing entries using information contained in the work sheet.
 Prepare a post-closing trial balance.
 Describe the evolution of accounting systems.
 Prepare a classified balance sheet.
 Analyze and use the financial results—the current ratio.
5.2 A career in information systems Have you ever heard the sayings "knowledge is power" or "information is money"?
When people talk about accounting, what they are really talking about is information.
The information used by businesses, as well as the technology that supports that information, represents some of the most valuable assets for organizations around the world.
Very often, the success of a business depends on effective creation, management, and use of information.
As companies become ever more reliant on technology, the need for well-educated Management Information Systems (MIS) auditors and control professionals increases.
Improved technology has the potential to dramatically improve business organizations and practices, reduce costs and exploit new business and investment opportunities.
At the same time, companies face constant challenges in selecting and implementing these new technologies.
Because of their high value and inherent complexity, the development, support, and auditing of information systems has become one of the fastest growing specialties in accounting.
Graduates with special interests and skills in computing and technology have expansive opportunities.
In addition to traditional accounting and auditing functions, MIS professionals perform evaluations of technologies and communications protocols involving electronic data interchange, client servers, local and wide area networks, data communications, telecommunications, and integrated voice/data/video systems.
In public accounting, technology has impacted the auditing profession by p. 190 of 433 extending the knowledge required to draw conclusions and the skills required to audit advanced accounting and information systems.
With management consulting practices growing and information systems becoming a larger percentage of public accounting revenue, MIS professionals are in high demand.
If you are considering a degree in computer or information systems, you should consider the advantages that an accounting major or minor can give you in working closely with businesses and consulting firms.
A dual major in accounting and MIS is one of the most desirable undergraduate degree combinations in the workforce.
This chapter explains two new steps in the accounting cycle—the preparation of the work sheet and closing entries.
In addition, we briefly discuss the evolution of accounting systems and present a classified balance sheet.
This balance sheet format more closely resembles actual company balance sheets.
After completing this chapter, you will understand how accounting begins with source documents that are evidence of a business entity's transactions and ends with financial statements that show the solvency and profitability of the entity.
5.3 The accounting cycle summarized In Chapter 1, you learned that when an event is a measurable business transaction, you need adequate proof of this transaction.
Then, you analyze the transaction's effects on the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' equity.
In Chapters 2 and 3, you performed other steps in the accounting cycle.
Chapter 2 presented the eight steps in the accounting cycle as a preview of the content of Chapters 2 through 4.
As a review, study the diagram of the eight steps in the accounting cycle in Exhibit 19.
Remember that the first three steps occur during the accounting period and the last five occur at the end.
The next section explains how to use the work sheet to facilitate the completion of the accounting cycle.
5.4 The work sheet The work sheet is a columnar sheet of paper or a computer spreadsheet on which accountants summarize information needed to make the adjusting and closing entries and to prepare the financial statements.
Usually, they save these work sheets to document the end-of-period entries.
A work sheet is only an accounting tool and not part of the formal accounting records.
Therefore, work sheets may vary in format; some are prepared in pencil so that errors can be corrected easily.
Other work sheets are prepared on personal computers with spreadsheet software.
Accountants prepare work sheets each time financial statements are needed—monthly, quarterly, or at the end of the accounting year.
p. 191 of 433 This chapter illustrates a 12-column work sheet that includes sets of columns for an unadjusted trial balance, adjustments, adjusted trial balance, income statement, statement of retained earnings, and balance sheet.
Each set has a debit and a credit column.
(See Exhibit 20.)
Accountants use these initial steps in preparing the work sheet.
The following sections describe the detailed steps for completing the work sheet.
 Enter the titles and balances of ledger accounts in the Trial Balance columns.
 Enter adjustments in the Adjustments columns.
 Enter adjusted account balances in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
 Extend adjusted balances of revenue and expense accounts from the Adjusted Trial Balance columns to the Income Statement columns.
 Extend any balances in the Retained Earnings and Dividends accounts to the Statement of Retained Earnings columns.
 Extend adjusted balances of asset, liability, and capital stock accounts from the Adjusted Trial Balance columns to the Balance Sheet columns.
Instead of preparing a separate trial balance as we did in Chapter 2, accountants use the Trial Balance columns on a work sheet.
Look at Exhibit 20 and note that the numbers and titles of the ledger accounts of MicroTrain Company are on the left portion of the work sheet.
Usually, only those accounts with balances as of the end of the accounting period are listed.
(Some accountants do list the entire chart of accounts, even those with zero balances.)
Assume you are MicroTrain's accountant.
You list the Retained Earnings account in the trial balance even though it has a zero balance to (1) show its relative position among the accounts and (2) indicate that December 2010 is the first month of operations for this company.
Next, you enter the balances of the ledger accounts in the Trial Balance columns.
The accounts are in the order in which they appear in the general ledger: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, dividends, revenues, and expenses.
Then, total the columns.
If the debit and credit column totals are not equal, an error exists that must be corrected before you proceed with the work sheet.
As you learned in Chapter 3, adjustments bring the accounts to their proper balances before accountants prepare the income statement, statement of retained earnings, and balance sheet.
You enter these adjustments in the Adjustments columns of the work sheet.
Also, you cross-reference the debits and credits of the entries by placing a key number or letter to the left of the amounts.
This key number facilitates the actual journalizing of the adjusting entries later because you do not have to rethink the adjustments to record them.
For example, the number (1) identifies the adjustment debiting Insurance Expense and crediting Prepaid Insurance.
Note in the Account Titles column that p. 192 of 433 the Insurance Expense account title is below the trial balance totals because the Insurance Expense account did not have a balance before the adjustment and, therefore, did not appear in the trial balance.
Work sheet preparers often provide brief explanations at the bottom for the keyed entries as in Exhibit 20.
Although these explanations are optional, they provide valuable information for those who review the work sheet later.
The adjustments (which were discussed and illustrated in Chapter 3) for MicroTrain Company are: Exhibit 19: Steps in the accounting cycle  Entry (1) records the expiration of USD 200 of prepaid insurance in December.
 Entry (2) records the expiration of USD 400 of prepaid rent in December.
 Entry (3) records the using up of USD 500 of supplies during the month.
 Entry (4) records USD 750 depreciation expense on the trucks for the month.
MicroTrain acquired the trucks at the beginning of December.
p. 193 of 433 MicroTrain acquired the trucks at the beginning of December  Entry (5) records the earning of USD 1,500 of the USD 4,500 in the Unearned Service Fees account.
 Entry (6) records USD 600 of interest earned in December.
 Entry (7) records USD 1,000 of unbilled training services performed in December.
 Entry (8) records the USD 180 accrual of salaries expense at the end of the month.
Often it is difficult to discover all the adjusting entries that should be made.
The following steps are helpful:  Examine adjusting entries made at the end of the preceding accounting period.
The same types of entries often are necessary period after period.
 Examine the account titles in the trial balance.
For example, if the company has an account titled Trucks, an entry must be made for depreciation.
 Examine various business documents (such as bills for services received or rendered) to discover other assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that have not yet been recorded.
 Ask the manager or other personnel specific questions regarding adjustments that may be necessary.
For example: "Were any services performed during the month that have not yet been billed?"

(4) To record depreciation expenses for December.
(5) To transfer fees for service provided in December from the liability account to the revenue account.
(6) To record one month's interest revenue.
(7) To record unbilled training services performed in December.
(8) To accrue one day's salaries that were earned but are unpaid.
After all the adjusting entries are entered in the Adjustments columns, total the two columns.
The totals of these two columns should be equal when all debits and credits are entered properly.
After MicroTrain's adjustments, compute the adjusted balance of each account and enter these in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
For example, Supplies on Hand (Account No.
107) had an unadjusted balance of USD 1,400.
Adjusting entry (3) credited the account for USD 500, leaving a debit balance of USD 900.
This amount is a debit in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
Next, extend all accounts having balances to the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
Note carefully how the rules of debit and credit apply in determining whether an adjustment increases or decreases the account balance.
For example, Salaries Expense (Account No.
507) has a USD 3,600 debit balance in the Trial Balance columns.
A USD 180 debit adjustment increases this account, which has a USD 3,780 debit balance in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
Some account balances remain the same because no adjustments have affected them.
For example, the balance in Accounts Payable (Account No.
200) does not change and is simply extended to the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
Now, total the Adjusted Trial Balance debit and credit columns.
The totals must be equal before taking the next step in completing the work sheet.
When the Trial Balance and Adjustments columns both balance but the Adjusted Trial Balance columns do not, the most probable cause is a math error or an error in extension.
The Adjusted Trial Balance columns make the next step of sorting the amounts to the Income Statement, the Statement of Retained Earnings, and the Balance Sheet columns much easier.
Begin by extending all of MicroTrain's revenue and expense account balances in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns to the Income Statement columns.
Since revenues carry credit balances, extend them to the credit column.
After extending expenses to the debit column, subtotal each column.
MicroTrain's total expenses are USD 6,510 and total revenues are USD 13,800.
Thus, net income for the period is p. 196 of 433 USD 7,290 (USD 13,800—USD 6,510).
Enter this USD 7,290 income in the debit column to make the two column totals balance.
You would record a net loss in the opposite manner; expenses (debits) would have been larger than revenues (credits) so a net loss would be entered in the credit column to make the columns balance.
Next, complete the Statement of Retained Earnings columns.
Enter the USD 7,290 net income amount for December in the credit Statement of Retained Earnings column.
Thus, this net income amount is the balancing figure for the Income Statement columns and is also in the credit Statement of Retained Earnings column.
Net income appears in the Statement of Retained Earnings credit column because it causes an increase in retained earnings.
Add the USD 7,290 net income to the beginning retained earnings balance of USD 0, and deduct the dividends of USD 3,000.
As a result, the ending balance of the Retained Earnings account is USD 4,290.
Now extend the assets, liabilities, and capital stock accounts in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns to the Balance Sheet columns.
Extend asset amounts as debits and liability and capital stock amounts as credits.
Note that the ending retained earnings amount determined in the Statement of Retained Earnings columns appears again as a credit in the Balance Sheet columns.
The ending retained earnings amount is a debit in the Statement of Retained Earnings columns to balance the Statement of Retained Earnings columns.
The ending retained earnings is a credit in the Balance Sheet columns because it increases stockholders' equity, and increases in stockholders' equity are credits.
(Retained earnings would have a debit ending balance only if cumulative losses and dividends exceed cumulative earnings.)
With the inclusion of the ending retained earnings amount, the Balance Sheet columns balance.
When the Balance Sheet column totals do not agree on the first attempt, work backward through the process used in preparing the work sheet.
Specifically, take the following steps until you discover the error: p. 197 of 433 MICROTRAIN COMPANY Income Statement For the Month Ended 2010 December 31 Revenues: Service Revenue $13,200 Interest Revenue 600 Total Revenue $13,800 Expenses: Advertising Expense $ 50 Gas and Oil Expense 680 Salaries Expense 3,780 Utilities Expense 150 Insurance Expense 200 Rent Expense 400 Supplies Expense 500 Depreciation Expense—Trucks 750 Total Expense 6,510 Net Income $ 7,290 Exhibit 21: Income statement  Re-total the two Balance Sheet columns to see if you made an error in addition.
If the column totals do not agree, check to see if you did not extend a balance sheet item or if you made an incorrect extension from the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
 Re-total the Statement of Retained Earnings columns and determine whether you entered the correct amount of retained earnings in the appropriate Statement of Retained Earnings and Balance Sheet columns.
 Re-total the Income Statement columns and determine whether you entered the correct amount of net income or net loss for the period in the appropriate Income Statement and Statement of Retained Earnings columns.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology Electronic spreadsheets have numerous applications in accounting.
An electronic spreadsheet is simply a large blank page that contains rows and columns on the computer screen.
The blocks created by the intersection of the rows and columns are cells; each cell can hold one or more words, a number, or the product of a mathematical formula.
Spreadsheets are ideal for creating large work sheets, trial balances, and other schedules, and for performing large volumes of calculations such as depreciation calculations.
The most popular spreadsheet program is Microsoft p. 198 of 433 Excel®.
Free spreadsheet programs are also available from companies such as Google and Zoho.
5.5 Preparing financial statements from the work sheet When the work sheet is completed, all the necessary information to prepare the income statement, statement of retained earnings, and balance sheet is readily available.
Now, you need only recast the information into the appropriate financial statement format.
The information you need to prepare the income statement in Exhibit 21 is in the work sheet's Income Statement columns in Exhibit 20.
The information you need to prepare the statement of retained earnings is taken from the Statement of Retained Earnings columns in the work sheet.
Look at Exhibit 22, MicroTrain Company's statement of retained earnings for the month ended 2010 December 31.
To prepare this statement, use the beginning Retained Earnings account balance (Account No.
310), add the net income (or deduct the net loss), and then subtract the Dividends (Account No.
320).
Carry the ending Retained Earnings balance forward to the balance sheet.
Remember that the statement of retained earnings helps to relate income statement information to balance sheet information.
It does this by indicating how net income on the income statement relates to retained earnings on the balance sheet.

As stated earlier, the correct amount for the ending retained earnings appears on the statement of retained earnings.
See the completed balance sheet for MicroTrain in Exhibit 23.
5.6 Journalizing adjusting entries After completing MicroTrain's financial statements from the work sheet, you should enter the adjusting entries in the general journal and post them to the appropriate ledger accounts.
You would prepare these adjusting entries as you learned in Chapter 3, except that the work sheet is now your source for making the entries.
The preparation of a work sheet does not eliminate the need to prepare and post adjusting entries because the work sheet is only an informal accounting tool and is not part of the formal accounting records.
The numerical notations in the Adjustments columns and the adjustments explanations at the bottom of the work sheet identify each adjusting entry.
The Adjustments columns show each entry with its appropriate debit and credit.
MicroTrain's adjusting entries as they would appear in the general journal after posting are: p. 200 of 433 MICROTRAIN COMPANY General Journal page3 Date Account Titles and Explanation Post.

5.7 The closing process In Chapter 2, you learned that revenue, expense, and dividends accounts are nominal (temporary) accounts that are merely subclassifications of a real (permanent) account, Retained Earnings.
You also learned that we prepare financial statements for certain accounting periods.
The closing process transfers (1) the balances in the revenue and expense accounts to a clearing account called Income p. 201 of 433 Summary and then to Retained Earnings and (2) the balance in the Dividends account to the Retained Earnings account.
The closing process reduces revenue, expense, and Dividends account balances to zero so they are ready to receive data for the next accounting period.
Accountants may perform the closing process monthly or annually.
The Income Summary account is a clearing account used only at the end of an accounting period to summarize revenues and expenses for the period.
After transferring all revenue and expense account balances to Income Summary, the balance in the Income Summary account represents the net income or net loss for the period.
Closing or transferring the balance in the Income Summary account to the Retained Earnings account results in a zero balance in Income Summary.
Also closed at the end of the accounting period is the Dividends account containing the dividends declared by the board of directors to the stockholders.
We close the Dividends account directly to the Retained Earnings account and not to Income Summary because dividends have no effect on income or loss for the period.
In accounting, we often refer to the process of closing as closing the books.
Remember that only revenue, expense, and Dividend accounts are closed—not asset, liability, Capital Stock, or Retained Earnings accounts.
The four basic steps in the closing process are:  Closing the revenue accounts—transferring the balances in the revenue accounts to a clearing account called Income Summary.
 Closing the expense accounts—transferring the balances in the expense accounts to a clearing account called Income Summary.
 Closing the Income Summary account—transferring the balance of the Income Summary account to the Retained Earnings account.
 Closing the Dividends account—transferring the balance of the Dividends account to the Retained Earnings account.
Revenues appear in the Income Statement credit column of the work sheet.
The two revenue accounts in the Income Statement credit column for MicroTrain Company are service revenue of USD 13,200 and interest revenue of USD 600 (Exhibit 20).
Because revenue accounts have credit balances, you must debit them for an amount equal to their balance to bring them to a zero balance.
When you debit Service Revenue and Interest Revenue, credit Income Summary (Account No.
600).
Enter the account numbers in the Posting Reference column when the journal entry has been posted to the ledger.
Do this for all other closing journal entries.

We show the Income Summary account in Step 3.
Expenses appear in the Income Statement debit column of the work sheet.
MicroTrain Company has eight expenses in the Income Statement debit column.
As shown by the column subtotal, these expenses add up to USD 6,510.
Since expense accounts have debit balances, credit each account to bring it to a zero balance.
Then, make the debit in the closing entry to the Income Summary account for USD 6,510.
Thus, to close the expense accounts, MicroTrain makes the following entry: p. 203 of 433 MICROTRAIN COMPANY Page General Journal 4 Date Account Titles and Explanation Post.

This comparison with the work sheet serves as a check that all revenue and expense items have been listed and closed.
If the debit in the preceding entry was made for a different amount than the column subtotal, the company would have an error in the closing entry for expenses.
After they have been closed, MicroTrain's expense accounts appear as follows.

after closing process is complete 4,290 After you have completed the closing process, the only accounts in the general ledger that have not been closed are the permanent balance sheet accounts.
Because these accounts contain the opening balances for the coming accounting period, debit balance totals must equal credit balance totals.
The preparation of a post-closing trial balance serves as a check on the accuracy of the closing process and ensures that the books are in balance at the start of the new accounting period.
The post-closing trial balance differs from the adjusted trial balance in only two important respects: (1) it excludes all temporary accounts since they have been closed; and (2) it updates the Retained Earnings account to its proper ending balance.
p. 208 of 433 A post-closing trial balance is a trial balance taken after the closing entries have been posted.
The only accounts that should be open are assets, liabilities, capital stock, and Retained Earnings accounts.
List all the account balances in the debit and credit columns and total them to make sure debits and credits are equal.
Look at Exhibit 24, a post-closing trial balance for MicroTrain Company as of 2010 December 31.
The amounts in the post-closing trial balance are from the ledger after the closing entries have been posted.
The next section briefly describes the evolution of accounting systems from the one-journal, one- ledger manual system you have been studying to computerized systems.
Then, we discuss the role of an accounting system.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology If you are studying in the US, you may want to visit the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants website at: http://www.aicpa.org You will find information about the CPA exam, about becoming a CPA, hot accounting topics, and various other topics, such as the US states that have passed a 150-hour requirement to sit for the CPA exam.
You can also learn such things as the states that have approved limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs).
These forms of organization serve to place limits on accountants' liability.
You can also find the phone numbers and mailing addresses of State Boards of accountancy and State Societies of CPAs.

5.8 Accounting systems: From manual to computerized The manual accounting system with only one general journal and one general ledger has been in use for hundreds of years and is still used by some very small companies.
Gradually, some manual systems evolved to include multiple journals and ledgers for increased efficiency.
For instance, a manual system with multiple journals and ledgers often includes: a sales journal to record all credit sales, a purchases journal to record all credit purchases, a cash receipts journal to record all cash receipts, and a cash disbursements journal to record all cash payments.
Still recorded in the general journal are adjusting and closing entries and any other entries that do not fit in one of the special journals.
Besides the general ledger, such a system normally has subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable and accounts p. 209 of 433 payable showing how much each customer owes and how much is owed to each supplier.
The general ledger shows the total amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable, but the details in the subsidiary ledgers allow companies to send bills to customers and pay bills to suppliers.
Another innovation in manual systems was the "one write" or pegboard system.
By creating one document and aligning other records under it on a pegboard, companies could record transactions more efficiently.
These systems permit the writing of a check and the simultaneous recording of the check in the cash disbursements journal.
Even though some of these systems are still in use today, computers make them obsolete.
During the 1950s, companies also used bookkeeping machines to supplement manual systems.
These machines recorded recurring transactions such as sales on account.
They posted transactions to the general ledger and subsidiary ledger accounts and computed new balances.
With the development of computers, bookkeeping machines became obsolete.
They were quite expensive, and computers easily outperformed them.
In the mid-1950s, large companies began using mainframe computers.
Early accounting applications were in payroll, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory.
Within a few years, programs existed for all phases of accounting, including manufacturing operations and the total integration of other accounting programs with the general ledger.
Until the 1980s, small and medium-sized companies either continued with a manual system, rented time on another company's computer, or hired a service bureau to perform at least some accounting functions.

How would this company know to whom to send bills and in what amounts?
Also, how would employees know for which suppliers to write checks and in what amounts?
Such subsidiary records are necessary either on paper or in a computer file.
Here is how the general ledger and subsidiary ledgers might look: Subsidiary General Ledger Subsidiary Accounts Accounts Payable Ledger Receivable Ledger JOHN JONES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BELL CORPORATION 200 1 900 100 SYLVIA SMITH GRANGER CORPORATION 300 1 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE 600 1,000 JAMES WELLS WONG CORPORATION 400 1 300 When a sale on account is made to John Jones, the debit is posted to both the control account, Accounts Receivable, in the General Ledger and the subsidiary account, John Jones, in the Subsidiary Accounts Receivable Ledger.
Likewise, when a purchase on account is made from Bell Corporation, the credit is posted to both the control account, Accounts Payable, in the General Ledger and to the subsidiary account, Bell Corporation, in the Subsidiary Accounts Payable Ledger.
At the end of the accounting period, the balances in each of the control accounts in the General Ledger must agree with the totals of the accounts in their respective subsidiary ledgers as shown above.
A given company could have hundreds or even thousands of accounts in their subsidiary ledgers that show the detail not supplied by the totals in the control accounts.
A broader perspective: Skills for the long haul p. 211 of 433 The decision has been made: You [Tracy] have opted to start your career by joining an international accounting firm.
But you can not help wondering if you have the right skills both for short and long-term success in public accounting.
Most students understand that accounting knowledge, organizational ability and interpersonal skills are critical to success in public accounting.
But it is important for the beginner to realize that different skills are emphasized at different points in a public accountant's career.
Let us examine the duties and skills needed at each level—Staff Accountant (years 1-2), Senior Accountant (years 3-4), Manager/ Senior Manager (years 5-11) and Partner (years 11+).
Staff accountant—Enthusiastic learner Let us travel with Tracy as she begins her career at the staff level.
At the outset, she works directly under a senior accountant on each of her audits and is responsible for completing audits and administrative tasks assigned to her.
Her duties include documenting work papers, interacting with client accounting staff, clerical tasks and discussing questions that arise with her senior.
Tracy will work on different audit engagements during her first year and learn the firm's audit approach.
She will be introduced to various industries and accounting systems.
The two most important traits to be demonstrated at the staff level are (1) a positive attitude and (2) the ability to learn quickly while adapting to unfamiliar situations.
Senior accountant—Organizer and teacher As a senior accountant, Tracy will be responsible for the day-to-day management of several audit engagements during the year.
She will plan the audits, oversee the performance of interim audit testing and direct year-end field work.
She will also perform much of the final wrap-up work, such as preparing checklists, writing the management letter and reviewing or drafting the financial statements.
Throughout this process, Tracy will spend a substantial amount of time instructing and supervising staff accountants.
The two most critical skills needed at the senior level are (1) the ability to organize and control an audit and (2) the ability to teach staff accountants how to audit.
Manager/senior manager—General manager and salesperson p. 212 of 433 Upon promotion to manager, Tracy will begin the transformation from auditor to executive.
She will manage several audits at one time and become active in billing clients as well as negotiating audit fees.
She will handle many important client meetings and closing conferences.
Tracy will also become more involved in the firm's administrative tasks.
Finally, outside of her client service and administrative duties, Tracy will be evaluated to a large extent on her community involvement and ability to assist the partners in generating new business for the firm.
The two skills most emphasized at the manager level are (1) general management ability and (2) sales and communication skills.
Partner—Leader and expert As a partner in the firm, Tracy will have many broad responsibilities.
She will engage in high-level client service activities, business development, recruiting, strategic planning, office administration and counseling.
Besides serving as the engagement partner on several audits, she will have ultimate responsibility for the quality of service provided to each of her clients.
Although a certain industry or administrative function will become her specialty, she will often be called upon to perform a wide variety of audit and administrative duties when other partners have scheduling conflicts.
She will be expected to serve as a positive example to those who work for her and will train others in her areas of expertise.
At the partnership level, what is looked for is leadership ability plus the ability to become an expert in a specific industry or administrative function.
In the meantime Those planning on a public accounting career should do more than just learn accounting.
To develop the needed skills, a broad education background in business and nonbusiness courses is required plus participation in extracurricular activities that promote leadership and communication skills.
It is never too early to start building the skills for long-term success.

The development of the personal computer (PC) in 1976 and its widespread use a decade later drastically changed the accounting systems of small and medium-sized businesses.
The number and p. 213 of 433 quality of accounting software packages for PCs and the power of PCs quickly increased.
Soon small and medium-sized businesses could maintain all accounting functions on a PC.
By the 1990s, the cost of PCs and accounting software packages had decreased significantly, accounting software packages had become more user-friendly, and computer literacy had increased so much that many very small businesses converted from manual to computerized systems.
However, some small business owners still use manual systems because they are familiar and meet their needs, and the persons keeping the records may not be computer literate.
Your knowledge of the basic manual accounting system described in these first four chapters enables you to better understand a computerized accounting system.
The computer automatically performs some of the steps in the accounting cycle, such as posting journal entries to the ledger accounts, closing the books, and preparing the financial statements.
However, if you understand all of the steps in the accounting cycle, you will better understand how to use the resulting data in decision making.
An accounting perspective: The impact of technology Results from a recent survey of 1,400 chief financial officers (CFOs) indicate that tomorrow's accounting professionals will be called upon to bridge the gap between technology and business.
With the rise of integrated accounting and information systems, technical expertise will go hand in hand with general business knowledge.
As we show in Exhibit 25, an accounting system is a set of records and the procedures and equipment used to perform the accounting functions.
Manual systems consist of journals and ledgers on paper.
Computerized accounting systems consist of accounting software, computer files, computers, and related peripheral equipment such as printers.
Regardless of the system, the functions of accountants include: (1) observing, identifying, and measuring economic events; (2) recording, classifying, and summarizing measurements; and (3) reporting economic events and interpreting financial statements.
Both internal and external users tell accountants their information needs.
The accounting system enables a company's accounting staff to supply relevant accounting information to meet those needs.
As internal and external users make decisions that become economic events, the cycle of information, decisions, and economic events begins again.
p. 214 of 433 The primary focus of the first four chapters has been on how you can use an accounting system to prepare financial statements.
However, we also discussed how to use that information in making decisions.
Later chapters also show how to prepare information and how that information helps users to make informed decisions.
We have not eliminated the preparation aspects because we believe that the most informed users are ones who also understand how the information was prepared.
These users understand not only the limitations of the information but also its relevance for decision making.
The next section discusses and illustrates the classified balance sheet, which aids in the analysis of the financial position of companies.
One example of this analysis is the current ratio and its use in analyzing the short-term debt-paying ability of a company.
Exhibit 25: The role of an accounting system An accounting perspective: Uses of technology Accounting software packages are typically menu driven and organized into modules such as general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable, invoicing, inventory, payroll, fixed assets, job cost, and purchase order.
For instance, general journal entries are made in the general ledger module, and this module contains all of the company's accounts.
The accounts payable module records all transactions involving credit p. 215 of 433 purchases from suppliers and payments made to those suppliers.
The accounts receivable module records all sales on credit to various customers and amounts received from customers.
5.9 A classified balance sheet The balance sheets we presented so far have been unclassified balance sheets.
As shown in Exhibit 23, an unclassified balance sheet has three major categories: assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity.
A classified balance sheet contains the same three major categories and subdivides them to provide useful information for interpretation and analysis by users of financial statements.
Exhibit 26, shows a slightly revised classified balance sheet for The Home Depot, Inc., and subsidiaries.1 Note that The Home Depot classified balance sheet is in a vertical format (assets appearing above liabilities and stockholders' equity) rather than the horizontal format (assets on the left and liabilities and stockholders' equity on the right).
The two formats are equally acceptable.
The Home Depot classified balance sheet subdivides two of its three major categories.
The Home Depot subdivides its assets into current assets, property and equipment, long-term investments, long- term notes receivable, intangible assets (cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired), and other assets.
The company subdivides its liabilities into current liabilities and long-term liabilities (including deferred income taxes).
A later chapter describes minority interest.
Stockholders' equity is the same in a classified balance sheet as in an unclassified balance sheet.
Later chapters describe further subdivisions of the stockholders' equity section.
We discuss the individual items in the classified balance sheet later in the text.
Our only purpose here is to briefly describe the items that can be listed under each category.
Some of these items are not in The Home Depot's balance sheet.
1Founded in 1978, The Home Depot is America's largest home improvement retailer and ranks among the nation's 30 largest retailers.
The company has more than 1,000 full-service warehouse stores.
Their primary customers are do-it-yourselfers.

An operating cycle is the time it takes to start with cash, buy necessary items to produce revenues (such as materials, supplies, labor, and/or finished goods), sell services or goods, and receive cash by collecting the resulting receivables.
Companies in service industries and merchandising industries generally have operating cycles shorter than one year.
Companies in some manufacturing industries, such as distilling and lumber, have operating cycles longer than one year.
However, since most operating cycles are shorter than one year, the one-year period is usually used in identifying current assets and current liabilities.
Common current assets in a service business include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, notes receivable, interest receivable, and prepaid expenses.
Note that on a balance sheet, current assets are in order of how easily they are convertible to cash, from most liquid to least liquid.
Cash includes deposits in banks available for current operations at the balance sheet date plus cash on hand consisting of currency, undeposited checks, drafts, and money orders.
Cash is the first current asset to appear on a balance sheet.
The term cash normally includes cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments acquired with temporarily idle cash and easily convertible into a known cash amount.
Examples are Treasury bills, short-term notes maturing within 90 days, certificates of deposit, and money market funds.
Marketable securities are temporary investments such as short-term ownership of stocks and bonds of other companies.
Such investments do not qualify as cash equivalents.
These investments earn additional money on cash that the business does not need at present but will probably need within one year.
Accounts receivable (also called trade accounts receivable) are amounts owed to a business by customers.
An account receivable arises when a company performs a service or sells merchandise on credit.
Customers normally provide no written evidence of indebtedness on sales invoices or delivery p. 218 of 433 tickets except their signatures.
Notice the term net in the balance sheet of The Home Depot (Exhibit 26).
This term indicates the possibility that the company may not collect some of its accounts receivable.
In the balance sheet, the accounts receivable amount is the sum of the individual accounts receivable from customers shown in a subsidiary ledger or file.
Merchandise inventories are goods held for sale.
Chapter 6 begins our discussion of merchandise inventories.
A note is an unconditional written promise to pay another party the amount owed either when demanded or at a certain specified date, usually with interest (a charge made for use of the money) at a specified rate.
A note receivable appears on the balance sheet of the company to which the note is given.
A note receivable arises (1) when a company makes a sale and receives a note from the customer, (2) when a customer gives a note for an amount due on an account receivable, or (3) when a company loans money and receives a note in return.
Chapter 9 discusses notes at length.
Other current assets might include interest receivable and prepaid expenses.
Interest receivable arises when a company has earned but not collected interest by the balance sheet date.
Usually, the amount is not due until later.
Prepaid expenses include rent, insurance, and supplies that have been paid for but all the benefits have not yet been realized (or consumed) from these expenses.
If prepaid expenses had not been paid for in advance, they would require the future disbursement of cash.
Furthermore, prepaid expenses are considered assets because they have service potential.
Long-term assets are assets that a business has on hand or uses for a relatively long time.
Examples include property, plant, and equipment; long-term investments; and intangible assets.
Property, plant, and equipment are assets with useful lives of more than one year; a company acquires them for use in the business rather than for resale.
(These assets are called property and equipment in The Home Depot's balance sheet.)
The terms plant assets or fixed assets are also used for property, plant, and equipment.
To agree with the order in the heading, balance sheets generally list property first, plant next, and equipment last.
These items are fixed assets because the company uses them for long-term purposes.
We describe several types of property, plant, and equipment next.
Land is ground the company uses for business operations; this includes ground on which the company locates its business buildings and that is used for outside storage space or parking.
Land owned for investment is not a plant asset because it is a long-term investment.
Buildings are structures the company uses to carry on its business.
Again, the buildings that a company owns as investments are not plant assets.
Office furniture includes file cabinets, desks, chairs, and shelves.
Office equipment includes computers, copiers, FAX machines, and phone answering machines.
p. 219 of 433 Leasehold improvements are any physical alterations made by the lessee to the leased property when these benefits are expected to last beyond the current accounting period.
An example is when the lessee builds room partitions in a leased building.
(The lessee is the one obtaining the rights to possess and use the property.)
Construction in progress represents the partially completed stores or other buildings that a company such as The Home Depot plans to occupy when completed.
Accumulated depreciation is a contra asset account to depreciable assets such as buildings, machinery, and equipment.
This account shows the total depreciation taken for the depreciable assets.
On the balance sheet, companies deduct the accumulated depreciation (as a contra asset) from its related asset.
Long-term investments A long-term investment usually consists of securities of another company held with the intention of (1) obtaining control of another company, (2) securing a permanent source of income for the investor, or (3) establishing friendly business relations.
The long-term investment classification in the balance sheet does not include those securities purchased for short- term purposes.
For most businesses, long-term investments may be stocks or bonds of other corporations.
Occasionally, long-term investments include funds accumulated for specific purposes, rental properties, and plant sites for future use.
Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of the noncurrent, nonmonetary, nonphysical assets of a business.
Companies must charge the costs of intangible assets to expense over the period benefited.
Among the intangible assets are rights granted by governmental bodies, such as patents and copyrights.
Other intangible assets include leaseholds and goodwill.
A patent is a right granted by the federal government; it gives the owner of an invention the authority to manufacture a product or to use a process for a specified time.
A copyright granted by the federal government gives the owner the exclusive privilege of publishing written material for a specified time.
Leaseholds are rights to use rented properties, usually for several years.
Goodwill is an intangible value attached to a business, evidenced by the ability to earn larger net income per dollar of investment than that earned by competitors in the same industry.
The ability to produce superior profits is a valuable resource of a business.
Normally, companies record goodwill only at the time of purchase and then only at the price paid for it.
The Home Depot has labeled its goodwill "cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired".
Accumulated amortization is a contra asset account to intangible assets.
This account shows the total amortization taken on the intangible assets.
p. 220 of 433 Current liabilities are debts due within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer.
The payment of current liabilities normally requires the use of current assets.
Balance sheets list current liabilities in the order they must be paid; the sooner a liability must be paid, the earlier it is listed.
Examples of current liabilities follow.
Accounts payable are amounts owed to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.
Accounts payable are generally due in 30 or 60 days and do not bear interest.
In the balance sheet, the accounts payable amount is the sum of the individual accounts payable to suppliers shown in a subsidiary ledger or file.
Notes payable are unconditional written promises by the company to pay a specific sum of money at a certain future date.
The notes may arise from borrowing money from a bank, from the purchase of assets, or from the giving of a note in settlement of an account payable.
Generally, only notes payable due in one year or less are included as current liabilities.
Salaries payable are amounts owed to employees for services rendered.
The company has not paid these salaries by the balance sheet date because they are not due until later.
Sales taxes payable are the taxes a company has collected from customers but not yet remitted to the taxing authority, usually the state.
Other accrued expenses might include taxes withheld from employees, income taxes payable, and interest payable.
Taxes withheld from employees include federal income taxes, state income taxes, and social security taxes withheld from employees' paychecks.
The company plans to pay these amounts to the proper governmental agencies within a short period.
Income taxes payable are the taxes paid to the state and federal governments by a corporation on its income.
Interest payable is interest that the company has accumulated on notes or bonds but has not paid by the balance sheet date because it is not due until later.
Dividends payable, or amounts the company has declared payable to stockholders, represent a distribution of income.
Since the corporation has not paid these declared dividends by the balance sheet date, they are a liability.
Unearned revenues (revenues received in advance) result when a company receives payment for goods or services before earning the revenue, such as payments for subscriptions to a magazine.
These unearned revenues represent a liability to perform the agreed services or other contractual requirements or to return the assets received.
Companies report any current installment on long-term debt due within one year under current liabilities.
The remaining portion continues to be reported as a long-term liability.
p. 221 of 433 Long-term liabilities are debts such as a mortgage payable and bonds payable that are not due for more than one year.
Companies should show maturity dates in the balance sheet for all long-term liabilities.
Normally, the liabilities with the earliest due dates are listed first.
Notes payable with maturity dates at least one year beyond the balance sheet date are long-term liabilities.
Bonds payable are long-term liabilities and are evidenced by formal printed certificates sometimes secured by liens (claims) on property, such as mortgages.
Maturity dates should appear on the balance sheet for all major long-term liabilities.
The deferred income taxes on The Home Depot's balance sheet result from a difference between income tax expense in the accounting records and the income tax payable on the company's tax return.
Stockholders' equity shows the owners' interest in the business.
This interest is equal to the amount contributed plus the income left in the business.
The items under stockholders' equity in The Home Depot's balance sheet are paid-in capital (including common stock) and retained earnings.
Paid-in capital shows the capital paid into the company as the owners' investment.
Retained earnings shows the cumulative income of the company less the amounts distributed to the owners in the form of dividends.
Cumulative translation adjustments result from translating foreign currencies into US dollars (a topic discussed in advanced accounting courses).
The unrealized loss on investments is discussed in Chapter 14.
The next section shows how two categories on the classified balance sheet relate to each other.
Together they help reveal a company's short-term debt-paying ability.
5.10 Analyzing and using the financial results — the current ratio The current ratio indicates the short-term debt-paying ability of a company.
To find the current ratio, we divide current assets by current liabilities.
For instance, Exhibit 26 shows that The Home Depot's current assets as of 2001 January 28, were USD 7,777,000,000 and its current liabilities were Currentassets USD 4,385,000,000.
Thus, its current ratio was: Currentratio= Currentliabilities USD7,777,000,000 =1.77:1 USD4,385,000,000 The current ratio of 1.77:1 for The Home Depot means that it has almost twice as many current assets as current liabilities.
Because current liabilities are normally paid with current assets, the company appears to be able to pay its short-term obligations easily.
In evaluating a company's short-term debt-paying ability, you should also examine the quality of the current assets.
If they include large amounts of uncollectable accounts receivable and/or obsolete p. 222 of 433 and unsalable inventory, even a 2:1 current ratio may be inadequate to allow the company to pay its current liabilities.
The Home Depot undoubtedly does not have such a problem.
The current assets, current liabilities, and current ratios of some other companies as of the third quarter of 2001 were: Current Current Current Ratio Company Assets Liabilities Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. $ 32,620,000,000 $ 32,869,000,000 .99:1 Hewlett-Packard Company 15,782,000,000 13,950,000,000 1.13:1 3M Corporation 6,556,000,000 5,006,000,000 1.31:1 General Electric Company 313,050,000,000 168,788,000,000 1.85:1 Johnson & Johnson 19,079,000,000 7,504,000,000 2.54:1 We described each of these companies earlier in the text.
As you can see from these comparisons, the current ratios vary a great deal.
An old rule of thumb is that the current ratio should be at least 2:1.
However, what constitutes an adequate current ratio depends on available lines of credit, the cash-generating ability of the company, and the nature of the industry in which the company operates.
For instance, companies in the airline industry are able to generate huge amounts of cash on a daily basis and may be able to pay their current liabilities even if their current ratio is less than 1:1.
Comparing a company's current ratio with other companies in the same industry makes sense because all of these companies face about the same economic conditions.
A company with the lowest current ratio in its industry may be unable to pay its short-term obligations on a timely basis, unless it can borrow funds from a bank on a line of credit.
A company with the highest current ratio in its industry may have on hand too many current assets, such as cash and marketable securities, which could be invested in more productive assets.
The next chapter describes the assumptions, concepts, and principles that constitute the accounting theory underlying financial accounting.
Thus, accounting theory dictates the standards and procedures applied to the reporting of financial information in the financial statements.
5.11 Understanding the learning objectives  Analyze transactions by examining source documents.
 Journalize transactions in the journal.
 Post journal entries to the accounts in the ledger.
 Prepare a trial balance of the accounts and complete the work sheet.
 Prepare financial statements.
 Journalize and post adjusting entries.
 Journalize and post closing entries.
 Prepare a post-closing trial balance.
p. 223 of 433  The work sheet is a columnar sheet of paper on which accountants summarize information needed to make the adjusting and closing entries and to prepare the financial statements.
 Work sheets may vary in format.
The work sheet illustrated in the chapter has 12 columns— two each for trial balance, adjustments, adjusted trial balance, income statement, statement of retained earnings, and balance sheet.
 The information needed to prepare the income statement is in the Income Statement columns of the work sheet.
Net income for the period is the amount needed to balance the two Income Statement columns in the work sheet.
 The information needed to prepare the statement of retained earnings is in the Statement of Retained Earnings columns of the work sheet.
The ending Retained Earnings balance is carried forward to the balance sheet.
 The information needed to prepare the balance sheet is in the Balance Sheet columns of the work sheet.
 As explained in Chapter 3, adjusting entries are necessary to bring the accounts to their proper balances before preparing the financial statements.
Closing entries are necessary to reduce the balances of revenue, expense, and Dividends accounts to zero so they are ready to receive data for the next accounting period.
 Revenue accounts are closed by debiting them and crediting the Income Summary account.
 Expense accounts are closed by crediting them and debiting the Income Summary account.
 The balance in the Income Summary account represents the net income or net loss for the period.
 To close the Income Summary account, the balance is transferred to the Retained Earnings account.
 To close the Dividends account, the balance is transferred to the Retained Earnings account.
 Only the balance sheet accounts have balances and appear on the post-closing trial balance.
 All revenue, expense, and Dividends accounts have zero balances and are not included in the post-closing trial balance.
 Manual systems and computerized systems perform the same accounting functions.
 The ease of accounting with a PC has encouraged even small companies to convert to computerized systems.
 A classified balance sheet subdivides the major categories on the balance sheet.
For instance, a classified balance sheet subdivides assets into current assets; long-term investments; property, plant, and equipment; and intangible assets.
It subdivides liabilities into current p. 224 of 433 liabilities and long-term liabilities.
Later chapters show more accounts in the stockholders' equity section, but the subdivisions remain basically the same.
 The current ratio gives some indication of the short-term debt-paying ability of a company.
 To find the current ratio, divide current assets by current liabilities.

5.11.4.7 Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking Business decision case A Heather and Dan Holt met while both were employed in the interior trim and upholstery department of an auto manufacturer.
After their marriage, they decided to earn some extra income by doing small jobs involving canvas, vinyl, and upholstered products.
Their work was considered excellent, and at the urging of their customers, they decided to go into business for themselves, operating out of the basement of the house they owned.
To do this, they invested USD 120,000 cash in their business.
They spent USD 10,500 for a sewing machine (expected life, 10 years) and USD 12,000 for other miscellaneous tools and equipment (expected life, 5 years).
They undertook only custom work, with the customers purchasing the required materials, to avoid stocking any inventory other than supplies.
Generally, they required an advance deposit on all jobs.
The business seemed successful from the start, as the Holts received orders from many customers.
But they felt something was wrong.
They worked hard and charged competitive prices.
Yet there seemed to be barely enough cash available from the business to cover immediate personal needs.
Summarized, the checkbook of the business for 2010, their second year of operations, showed: Balance, 2010 January 1 $ 99,200 Cash received from customers: For work done in 2009 $ 36,000 For work done in 2010 200,000 For work to be done in 2011 48,000 284,000 $ 383,200 Cash paid out: Two-year insurance policy dated 2010 January 1 $ 19,200 Utilities 48,000 Supplies 104,000 Other Expenses 72,000 Taxes, including sales taxes 26,400 Dividends 40,000 309,600 Balance, 2010 December 31 $ 73,600 Considering how much they worked, the Holts were concerned that the cash balance decreased by USD 25,600 even though they only received dividends of USD 40,000.
Their combined income from the auto manufacturer had been USD 45,000.
They were seriously considering giving up their business and going back to work for the auto manufacturer.
They turned to you for advice.
You discovered the following: p. 248 of 433 Of the supplies purchased in 2010, USD 24,000 were used on jobs billed to customers in 2010; no supplies were used for any other work.
Work completed in 2010 and billed to customers for which cash had not yet been received by year- end amounted to USD 40,000.
Prepare a written report for the Holts, responding to their belief that their business is not sufficiently profitable.

The three trial balances are the unadjusted trial balance, the adjusted trial balance, and the post-closing trial balance.
The first two trial balances appear on the work sheet.
False.
If a debit-balance account (such as Prepaid Rent) is credited in the adjustment, the amount in the Adjustments columns is deducted from the amount in the Trial Balance columns to determine the amount for that item in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
True.
The net loss appears in the Income Statement credit column to balance the Income Statement columns.
Then the loss appears in the Statement of Retained Earnings debit column because it reduces Retained Earnings.
True.
All of these accounts are closed, or reduced to zero balances, as a result of the closing process.
False.
All revenue and expense accounts have zero balances after closing.
False.
Some manual accounting systems are still in use.
Multiple-choice b.
The other accounts are very likely to be adjusted.
The Land account would be adjusted only if an error has been made involving that account.
c. The Adjusted Trial Balance columns should balance before items are spread to the Income Statement, Statement of Retained Earnings, and Balance Sheet columns.
Therefore, if the Balance Sheet columns do not balance, the error is likely to exist in the last six columns of the work sheet.

6.2 A career as an accounting professor Do you enjoy college life?
Do you enjoy teaching others?
If so, you might want to consider a career as a college professor.
Although a position as a college professor may pay less than some other career alternatives, the intangible benefits are beyond measure.
A college professor can make a real difference in the lives of hundreds, even thousands, of students over a career.
Students come to college with great potential, but are in need of some additional training and guidance.
The work of a college professor is a valuable investment in our nation's most valuable resource—people.
College faculty generally teach fewer hours each week than elementary and secondary school teachers.
This is because most college faculty have at least two additional important responsibilities: research and service.
The research component represents far more than just summarizing what others have already learned.
It represents arriving at new knowledge by discovering things that previously were unknown.
For instance, accounting research has demonstrated the ways in which accounting numbers such as earnings and stockholder's equity are related to stock prices.
This illustrates the importance of accounting numbers and has resulted in a large stream of discovery called Capital Markets research.
Besides teaching and research, most faculty have significant service responsibilities as well.
Accounting faculty are involved in service to the university, the accounting profession, and to the general public.
Many college faculty dedicate 10-20 hours or more each week to the service component of their jobs.
The demand for college professors varies greatly by discipline.
In fields such as English, Fine Arts, Philosophy, and Psychology there is a large supply of candidates with advanced degrees and, thus, the competition for positions as college professors in these areas is intense.
However, in applied fields such p. 253 of 433 as accounting and engineering, there is a shortage of candidates with advanced degrees.
The opportunities for professors in these applied fields are excellent, and the chance to make a real difference in the lives of others is exciting.
Chapter 1 briefly introduced the body of theory underlying accounting procedures.
In this chapter, we discuss accounting theory in greater depth.
Now that you have learned some accounting procedures, you are better able to relate these theoretical concepts to accounting practice.
Accounting theory is "a set of basic concepts and assumptions and related principles that explain and guide the accountant's actions in identifying, measuring, and communicating economic information".1 To some people, the word theory implies something abstract and out of reach.
Understanding the theory behind the accounting process, however, helps one make decisions in diverse accounting situations.
Accounting theory provides a logical framework for accounting practice.
The first part of the chapter describes underlying accounting assumptions or concepts, the measurement process, the major principles, and modifying conventions or constraints.
Accounting theory has developed over the years and is contained in authoritative accounting literature and textbooks.
The next part of the chapter describes the development of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) conceptual framework for accounting.
This framework builds on accounting theory developed over time and serves as a basis for formulating accounting standards in the future.
Presenting the traditional body of theory first and the conceptual framework second gives you a sense of the historical development of accounting theory.
Despite some overlap between the two parts of the chapter, remember that FASB's conceptual framework builds on traditional theory rather than replaces it.
The final part of the chapter discusses significant accounting policies contained in annual reports issued by companies and illustrates them with an actual example from an annual report of the Walt Disney Company.
6.3 Traditional accounting theory Traditional accounting theory consists of underlying assumptions, rules of measurement, major principles, and modifying conventions (or constraints).
The following sections describe these aspects of accounting theory that greatly influence accounting practice.
1American Accounting Association, A Statement of Basic Accounting Theory (Sarasota, Fla., 1966), pp.
1-2. p. 254 of 433  6.4 Underlying assumptions or concepts The major underlying assumptions or concepts of accounting are (1) business entity, (2) going concern (continuity), (3) money measurement, (4) stable dollar, and (5) periodicity.
This section discusses the effects of these assumptions on the accounting process.
Data gathered in an accounting system must relate to a specific business unit or entity.
The business entity concept assumes that each business has an existence separate from its owners, creditors, employees, customers, interested parties, and other businesses.
For each business (such as a horse stable or a fitness center), the business, not the business owner, is the accounting entity.
Therefore, financial statements are identified as belonging to a particular business entity.
The content of these financial statements reports only on the activities, resources, and obligations of that entity.
A business entity may be made up of several different legal entities.
For instance, a large business (such as General Motors Corporation) may consist of several separate corporations, each of which is a separate legal entity.
For reporting purposes, however, the corporations may be considered as one business entity because they have a common ownership.
Chapter 14 illustrates this concept.
When accountants record business transactions for an entity, they assume it is a going concern.
The going-concern (continuity) assumption states that an entity will continue to operate indefinitely unless strong evidence exists that the entity will terminate.
The termination of an entity occurs when a company ceases business operations and sells its assets.
The process of termination is called liquidation.
If liquidation appears likely, the going-concern assumption is no longer valid.
Accountants often cite the going-concern assumption to justify using historical costs rather than market values in measuring assets.
Market values are of less significance to an entity using its assets rather than selling them.
On the other hand, if an entity is liquidating, it should use liquidation values to report assets.
The economic activity of a business is normally recorded and reported in money terms.
Money measurement is the use of a monetary unit such as the dollar instead of physical or other units of measurement.
Using a particular monetary unit provides accountants with a common unit of measurement to report economic activity.
Without a monetary unit, it would be impossible to add such items as buildings, equipment, and inventory on a balance sheet.
Financial statements identify their unit of measure (such as the dollar in the United States) so the statement user can make valid comparisons of amounts.
For example, it would be difficult to compare relative asset amounts or profitability of a company reporting in US dollars with a company reporting in Japanese yen.
p. 255 of 433 In the United States, accountants make another assumption regarding money measurement—the stable dollar assumption.
Under the stable dollar assumption, the dollar is accepted as a reasonably stable unit of measurement.
Thus, accountants make no adjustments for the changing value of the dollar in the primary financial statements.
Using the stable dollar assumption creates a difficulty in depreciation accounting.
Assume, for example, that a company acquired a building in 1975 and computed the 30-year straight-line depreciation on the building without adjusting for any changes in the value of the dollar.
Thus, the depreciation deducted in 2008 is the same as the depreciation deducted in 1975.
The company makes no adjustments for the difference between the values of the 1975 dollar and the 2008 dollar.
Both dollars are treated as equal monetary units of measurement despite substantial price inflation over the 30-year period.
Accountants and business executives have expressed concern over this inflation problem, especially during periods of high inflation.
According to the periodicity (time periods) assumption, accountants divide an entity's life into months or years to report its economic activities.
Then, accountants attempt to prepare accurate reports on the entity's activities for these periods.
Although these time-period reports provide useful and timely financial information for investors and creditors, they may be inaccurate for some of these time periods because accountants must estimate depreciation expense and certain other adjusting entries.
Accounting reports cover relatively short periods.
These time periods are usually of equal length so that statement users can make valid comparisons of a company's performance from period to period.
The length of the accounting period must be stated in the financial statements.
For instance, so far, the income statements in this text were for either one month or one year.
Companies that publish their financial statements, such as publicly held corporations, generally prepare monthly statements for internal management and publish financial statements quarterly and annually for external statement users.
Accrual basis and periodicity Chapter 3 demonstrated that financial statements more accurately reflect the financial status and operations of a company when prepared under the accrual basis rather than the cash basis of accounting.
Under the cash basis, we record revenues when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid.
Under the accrual basis, however, we record revenues when services are rendered or products are sold and expenses when incurred.
The periodicity assumption requires preparing adjusting entries under the accrual basis.
Without the periodicity assumption, a business would have only one time period running from its inception to its termination.
Then, the concepts of cash basis and accrual basis accounting would be irrelevant p. 256 of 433 because all revenues and all expenses would be recorded in that one time period and would not have to be assigned to artificially short periods of one year or less.
Approximation and judgment because of periodicity To provide periodic financial information, accountants must often estimate expected uncollectible accounts (see Chapter 9) and the useful lives of depreciable assets.
Uncertainty about future events prevents precise measurement and makes estimates necessary in accounting.
Fortunately, these estimates are often reasonably accurate.
6.5 Other basic concepts Other basic accounting concepts that affect accounting for entities are (1) general-purpose financial statements, (2) substance over form, (3) consistency, (4) double entry, and (5) articulation.
We discuss these basic accounting concepts next.
Accountants prepare general-purpose financial statements at regular intervals to meet many of the information needs of external parties and top-level internal managers.
In contrast, accountants can gather special-purpose financial information for a specific decision, usually on a one-time basis.
For example, management may need specific information to decide whether to purchase a new computer system.
Since special-purpose financial information must be specific, this information is best obtained from the detailed accounting records rather than from the financial statements.
In some business transactions, the economic substance of the transaction conflicts with its legal form.
For example, a contract that is legally a lease may, in fact, be equivalent to a purchase.
A company may have a three-year contract to lease (rent) an automobile at a stated monthly rental fee.
At the end of the lease period, the company receives title to the auto after paying a nominal sum (say, USD 1).
The economic substance of this transaction is a purchase rather than a lease of the auto.
Thus, under the substance-over-form concept, the auto is an asset on the balance sheet and is depreciated instead of showing rent expense on the income statement.
Accountants record a transaction's economic substance rather than its legal form.
Consistency generally requires that a company use the same accounting principles and reporting practices through time.
This concept prohibits indiscriminate switching of accounting principles or methods, such as changing inventory methods every year.
However, consistency does not prohibit a change in accounting principles if the information needs of financial statement users are better served by the change.
When a company makes a change in accounting principles, it must make the following disclosures in the financial statements: (1) nature of the change; (2) reasons for the change; (3) effect of the change on current net income, if significant; and (4) cumulative effect of the change on past income.
p. 257 of 433 Chapter 2 introduced the basic accounting concept of the double-entry method of recording transactions.
Under the double-entry approach, every transaction has a two-sided effect on each party engaging in the transaction.
Thus, to record a transaction, each party debits at least one account and credits at least one account.
The total debits equal the total credits in each journal entry.
When learning how to prepare work sheets in Chapter 4, you learned that financial statements are fundamentally related and articulate (interact) with each other.
For example, we carry the amount of net income from the income statement to the statement of retained earnings.
Then we carry the ending balance on the statement of retained earnings to the balance sheet to bring total assets and total equities into balance.
In Exhibit 27 we summarize the underlying assumptions or concepts.
The next section discusses the measurement process used in accounting.
6.6 The measurement process in accounting Earlier, we defined accounting as "the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of the information".2 In this section, we focus on the measurement process of accounting.
Accountants measure a business entity's assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and any changes that occur in them.
By assigning the effects of these changes to particular time periods (periodicity), they can find the net income or net loss of the accounting entity for those periods.
Accountants measure the various assets of a business in different ways.
They measure cash at its specified amount.
Chapter 9 explains how they measure claims to cash, such as accounts receivable, at their expected cash inflows, taking into consideration possible uncollectibles.
They measure inventories, prepaid expenses, plant assets, and intangibles at their historical costs (actual amounts paid).
After the acquisition date, they carry some items, such as inventory, at the lower-of-cost-or- market value.
After the acquisition date, they carry plant assets and intangibles at original cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization.
They measure liabilities at the amount of cash that will be paid or the value of services that will be performed to satisfy the liabilities.
Accountants can easily measure some changes in assets and liabilities, such as the acquisition of an asset on credit and the payment of a liability.
Other changes in assets and liabilities, such as those recorded in adjusting entries, are more difficult to measure because they often involve estimates and/or calculations.
The accountant must determine when a change has taken place and the amount of 2Ibid., p. 1. p. 258 of 433 the change.
These decisions involve matching revenues and expenses and are guided by the principles discussed next.

related to one another.
For instance, earning revenue increases net income on the income statement, retained earnings on the statement of retained earnings, and assets and retained earnings on the balance sheet.
The statement of retained earnings ties the income statement and balance sheet together.
Exhibit 27: The underlying assumptions or concepts 6.7 The major principles Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) set forth standards or methods for presenting financial accounting information.
A standardized presentation format enables users to compare the p. 259 of 433 financial information of different companies more easily.
Generally accepted accounting principles have been either developed through accounting practice or established by authoritative organizations.
Organizations that have contributed to the development of the principles are the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the American Accounting Association (AAA), the Financial Executives Institute (FEI), and the Institute of Management Accounting (IMA).
This section explains the following major principles:  Exchange-price (or cost) principle.
 Revenue recognition principle.
 Matching principle.
 Gain and loss recognition principle.
 Full disclosure principle.
Whenever resources are transferred between two parties, such as buying merchandise on account, the accountant must follow the exchange-price (or cost) principle in presenting that information.
The exchange-price (or cost) principle requires an accountant to record transfers of resources at prices agreed on by the parties to the exchange at the time of exchange.
This principle sets forth (1) what goes into the accounting system—transaction data; (2) when it is recorded—at the time of exchange; and (3) the amounts—exchange prices—at which assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, revenues, and expenses are recorded.
As applied to most assets, this principle is often called the cost principle.
It dictates that purchased or self-constructed assets are initially recorded at historical cost.
Historical cost is the amount paid, or the fair market value of the liability incurred or other resources surrendered, to acquire an asset and place it in a condition and position for its intended use.
For instance, when the cost of a plant asset (such as a machine) is recorded, its cost includes the net purchase price plus any costs of reconditioning, testing, transporting, and placing the asset in the location for its intended use.
Accountants prefer the term exchange-price principle to cost principle because it seems inappropriate to refer to liabilities, stockholders' equity, and such assets as cash and accounts receivable as being measured in terms of cost.
More recently, the FASB in SFAS 157 has moved definitively towards fair market value accounting, or “mark-to-market”, which records the value of an asset or liability at its current market value (also known as a “fair value”) rather than its book value.
SFAS 157 defines “fair value” as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date”.
p. 260 of 433 It is also defined as “an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability”, whether or not the business plans to hold the asset/liability for investment, or sell it.
“The fair value accounting standard SFAS 157 applies to financial assets of all publicly-traded companies in the US as of 2007 Nov. 15.
It also applies to non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized, or disclosed, at fair value on a recurring basis.
Beginning in 2009, the standard will apply to other non-financial assets.
SFAS 157 applies to items for which other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements except share-based payment transactions, such as stock option compensation.
“SFAS 157 provides a hierarchy of three levels of input data for determining the fair value of an asset or liability.
This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of information used to determine fair values, with level 1 inputs being the most reliable and level 3 inputs being the least reliable.
 Level 1 is quoted prices for identical items in active, liquid and visible markets such as stock exchanges.
 Level 2 is observable information for similar items in active or inactive markets, such as two similarly situated buildings in a downtown real estate market.
 Level 3 are unobservable inputs to be used in situations where markets do not exist or are illiquid such as the present credit crisis.
At this point fair market valuation becomes highly subjective.” Fair value accounting has been a contentious topic since it was introduced, For example, “banks and investment banks have had to reduce the value of the mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to reflect current prices”.
Those prices declined severely with the collapse of credit markets as mortgage defaults escalated in the financial crisis of 2008-2009.
Despite debate over the proper implementation of fair market value accounting, International Financial Reporting Standards utilize this approach much more than the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States.

An accounting perspective: Business insight In some European countries, the financial statements contain secret reserves.
These secret reserves arise from a company not reporting all of its profits when it has a very good year.
The justification is that the stockholders vote on the amount of dividends they receive each p. 261 of 433 year; if all profits were reported, the stockholders might vote to pay the entire amount out as dividends.
By holding back some profits, not only are the creditors more protected but the company is also more solvent and has more resources to invest in productive assets.
Revenue is not difficult to define or measure; it is the inflow of assets from the sale of goods and services to customers, measured by the cash expected to be received from customers.
However, the crucial question for the accountant is when to record a revenue.
Under the revenue recognition principle, revenues should be earned and realized before they are recognized (recorded).
Earning of revenue All economic activities undertaken by a company to create revenues are part of the earning process.
Many activities may have preceded the actual receipt of cash from a customer, including (1) placing advertisements, (2) calling on the customer several times, (3) submitting samples, (4) acquiring or manufacturing goods, and (5) selling and delivering goods.
For these activities, the company incurs costs.
Although revenue was actually being earned by these activities, accountants do not recognize revenue until the time of sale because of the requirement that revenue be substantially earned before it is recognized (recorded).
This requirement is the earning principle.
Realization of revenue Under the realization principle, the accountant does not recognize (record) revenue until the seller acquires the right to receive payment from the buyer.
The seller acquires this right from the buyer at the time of sale for merchandise transactions or when services have been performed in service transactions.
Legally, a sale of merchandise occurs when title to the goods passes to the buyer.
The time at which title passes normally depends on the shipping terms— FOB shipping point or FOB destination (as we discuss in Chapter 6).
As a practical matter, accountants generally record revenue when goods are delivered.
The advantages of recognizing revenue at the time of sale are (1) the actual transaction—delivery of goods—is an observable event; (2) revenue is easily measured; (3) risk of loss due to price decline or destruction of the goods has passed to the buyer; (4) revenue has been earned, or substantially so; and (5) because the revenue has been earned, expenses and net income can be determined.
As discussed later, the disadvantage of recognizing revenue at the time of sale is that the revenue might not be recorded in the period during which most of the activity creating it occurred.
Exceptions to the realization principle The following examples are instances when practical considerations may cause accountants to vary the point of revenue recognition from the time of sale.
These examples illustrate the effect that the business environment has on the development of accounting principles and standards.
p. 262 of 433 Cash collection as point of revenue recognition Some small companies record revenues and expenses at the time of cash collection and payment, which may not occur at the time of sale.
This procedure is the cash basis of accounting.
The cash basis is acceptable primarily in service enterprises that do not have substantial credit transactions or inventories, such as business entities of doctors or dentists.
Installment basis of revenue recognition When collecting the selling price of goods sold in monthly or annual installments and considerable doubt exists as to collectibility, the company may use the installment basis of accounting.
Companies make these sales in spite of the doubtful collectibility of the account because their margin of profit is high and the goods can be repossessed if the payments are not received.
Under the installment basis, the percentage of total gross margin (selling price of a good minus its cost) recognized in a period is equal to the percentage of total cash from a sale that is received in that period.
Thus, the gross margin recognized in a period is equal to the cash received times the gross margin percentage (gross margin divided by selling price).
The formula to recognize gross profit on cash collections made on installment sales of a certain year is: CashcollectionsxGrossmarginpercentage=Grossmarginrecognized To be more precise, we expand the descriptions in the formula as follows: Cash collections this year resulting X Gross margin percentage = Gross margin recognized this from installment sales made in a for the year of sale year on cash collections this certain year year from installment sales made in a certain year To illustrate, assume a company sold a stereo set.
The facts of the sale are: Date of sale Selling price Cost Gross margin (Selling price – Gross margin percentage (Gross Cost) margin/Selling price) 2010 Oct. 1 USD 500 USD 300 (500-300) – 200 (200/500) = 40 per cent The buyer makes 10 equal monthly installment payments of USD 50 to pay for the set (10 X USD 50 = USD 500).
If the company receives three monthly payments in 2010, the total amount of cash received in 2010 is USD 150 (3 X USD 50).
The gross margin to recognize in 2010 is: 2010 cash collections from X Gross margin percentage = 2010 gross margin 2010 installment sales on 2010 installment salesrecognized on 2010 cash collections from 2010 installment sales USD 150 X 40 per cent = USD 60 p. 263 of 433 The company collects the other installments when due so it receives a total of USD 350 in 2011 from 2010 installment sales.
The gross margin to recognize in 2011 on these cash collections is as follows: 2011 cash collections from 2010 X Gross margin percentage on 2010 = 2011 gross margin recognized on installment sales installment sales 2011 cash collections from 2010 installment sales USD 350 X 40 per cent = USD 140 In summary, the total receipts and gross margin recognized in the two years are as follows: Total Amount of Gross Margin Year Cash Recognized Recognized 2010 $150 30% $ 60 30% 2011 ..... 350 70% 140 70% $500 100% $200 100% Because the installment basis delays some revenue recognition beyond the time of sale, it is acceptable for accounting purposes only when considerable doubt exists as to collectibility of the installments.
Revenue recognition on long-term construction projects Companies recognize revenue from a long-term construction project under two different methods: (1) the completed-contract method or (2) the percentage-of-completion method.
The completed-contract method does not recognize any revenue until the project is completed.
In that period, they recognize all revenue even though the contract may have required three years to complete.
Thus, the completed-contract method recognizes revenues at the time of sale, as is true for most sales transactions.
Companies carry costs incurred on the project forward in an inventory account (Construction in Process) and charge them to expense in the period in which the revenue is recognized.
Some accountants argue that waiting so long to recognize any revenue is unreasonable.
They believe that because revenue-producing activities have been performed during each year of construction, revenue should be recognized in each year of construction even if estimates are needed.
The percentage-of-completion method recognizes revenue based on the estimated stage of completion of a long-term project.
To measure the stage of completion, firms compare actual costs incurred in a period with the total estimated costs to be incurred on the project.
To illustrate, assume that a company has a contract to build a dam for USD 44 million.
The estimated construction cost is USD 40 million.
You calculate the estimated gross margin as follows: Sales price of dam Estimated costs of construct Estimated gross margin (sales price – dam estimated costs) USD 44 million USD 40 million (44 million – 40 million) – 4 million p. 264 of 433 The firm recognizes the USD 4 million gross margin in the financial statements by recording the assigned revenue for the year and then deducting actual costs incurred that year.
The formula to recognize revenue is: Actualconstructioncostsincurredduringtheperiod xTotalsalesprice=Revenuerecognizedforperiod Totalestimatedconstructioncostsfortheentireproject Suppose that by the end of the first year (2010), the company had incurred actual construction costs of USD 30 million.
These costs are 75 per cent of the total estimated construction costs (USD 30 million/USD 40 million = 75 per cent).
Under the percentage-of-completion method, the firm would use the 75 per cent figure to assign revenue to the first year.
In 2011, it incurs another USD 6 million of construction costs.
In 2012, it incurs the final USD 4 million of construction costs.
The amount of revenue to assign to each year is as follows: Year Amount of Ratio of Actual Construction Agreed Price = Revenue to Costs to Total Estimated X of Dam = Recognize Construction Costs (Assign) 2010 ($30 million + $40 million = 75%) 75% X $44 million = $33 million 2011 ($6 million + $40 million = 15%) 15% X $44 million = $6.6 million 2012 ($4 million + $40 million = 10%) 10% X $44 million = $4.4 million $44 million The amount of gross margin to recognize in each year is as follows: Year Assigned Actual Recognized Revenues - Construction = Gross Costs Margin 2010 $33.0 million - $30.0 million = $3.0 million 2011 6.6 - 6.0 = 0.6 2012 4.4 - 4.0 = 0.4 $44.0 million $40.0 million $4.0 million Number of Companies 2003 2002 2001 2000 Percentage of completion 78 82 80 71 Units of delivery 32 26 21 19 Completed contract 9 5 3 5 Source: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Accounting Trends & Techniques (New York: AICPA, 2004), p. 432 Exhibit 28: Methods of accounting for long-term contracts This company would deduct other costs incurred in the accounting period, such as general and administrative expenses, from gross margin to determine net income.
For instance, assuming general and administrative expenses were USD 100,000 in 2010, net income would be (USD 3,000,000 - USD 100,000) = USD 2,900,000. p. 265 of 433 Expense recognition is closely related to, and sometimes discussed as part of, the revenue recognition principle.
The matching principle states that expenses should be recognized (recorded) as they are incurred to produce revenues.
An expense is the outflow or using up of assets in the generation of revenue.
Firms voluntarily incur expense to produce revenue.
For instance, a television set delivered by a dealer to a customer in exchange for cash is an asset consumed to produce revenue; its cost becomes an expense.
Similarly, the cost of services such as labor are voluntarily incurred to produce revenue.
The measurement of expense Accountants measure most assets used in operating a business by their historical costs.
Therefore, they measure a depreciation expense resulting from the consumption of those assets by the historical costs of those assets.
They measure other expenses, such as wages that are paid for currently, at their current costs.
The timing of expense recognition The matching principle implies that a relationship exists between expenses and revenues.
For certain expenses, such as costs of acquiring or producing the products sold, you can easily see this relationship.
However, when a direct relationship cannot be seen, we charge the costs of assets with limited lives to expense in the periods benefited on a systematic and rational allocation basis.
Depreciation of plant assets is an example.
Product costs are costs incurred in the acquisition or manufacture of goods.
As you will see in the next chapter, included as product costs for purchased goods are invoice, freight, and insurance-in- transit costs.
For manufacturing companies, product costs include all costs of materials, labor, and factory operations necessary to produce the goods.
Product costs attach to the goods purchased or produced and remain in inventory accounts as long as the goods are on hand.
We charge product costs to expense when the goods are sold.
The result is a precise matching of cost of goods sold expense to its related revenue.
Period costs are costs not traceable to specific products and expensed in the period incurred.
Selling and administrative costs are period costs.
The gain and loss recognition principle states that we record gains only when realized, but losses when they first become evident.
Thus, we recognize losses at an earlier point than gains.
This principle is related to the conservatism concept.
Gains typically result from the sale of long-term assets for more than their book value.
Firms should not recognize gains until they are realized through sale or exchange.
Recognizing potential gains before they are actually realized is not allowed.
Losses consume assets, as do expenses.
However, unlike expenses, they do not produce revenues.
Losses are usually involuntary, such as the loss suffered from destruction by fire on an uninsured p. 266 of 433 building.
A loss on the sale of a building may be voluntary when management decides to sell the building even though incurring a loss.
The full disclosure principle states that information important enough to influence the decisions of an informed user of the financial statements should be disclosed.
Depending on its nature, companies should disclose this information either in the financial statements, in notes to the financial statements, or in supplemental statements.
In judging whether or not to disclose information, it is better to err on the side of too much disclosure rather than too little.
Many lawsuits against CPAs and their clients have resulted from inadequate or misleading disclosure of the underlying facts.
We summarize the major principles and describe the importance of each in Exhibit 29.
An accounting perspective: Business insight The accounting model involves reporting revenues earned and expenses incurred by the company.
Some have argued that social benefits and social costs created by the company should also be reported.
Suppose, for instance, that a company is dumping toxic waste into a river and this action causes cancer among the citizens downstream.
Should this cost be reported when preparing financial statements showing the performance of the company?
What do you think ?
6.8 Modifying conventions (or constraints) In certain instances, companies do not strictly apply accounting principles because of modifying conventions (or constraints).
Modifying conventions are customs emerging from accounting practice that alter the results obtained from a strict application of accounting principles.
Three modifying conventions are cost-benefit, materiality, and conservatism.
Cost-benefit The cost-benefit consideration involves deciding whether the benefits of including optional information in financial statements exceed the costs of providing the information.
Users tend to think information is cost free since they incur none of the costs of providing the information.
Preparers realize that providing information is costly.
The benefits of using information should exceed the costs of providing it.
The measurement of benefits is inexact, which makes application of this modifying convention difficult in practice.
Materiality Materiality is a modifying convention that allows accountants to deal with immaterial (unimportant) items in an expedient but theoretically incorrect manner.
The fundamental question accountants must ask in judging the materiality of an item is whether a knowledgeable user's decisions would be different if the information were presented in the theoretically correct manner.
If not, the p. 267 of 433 item is immaterial and may be reported in a theoretically incorrect but expedient manner.
For instance, because inexpensive items such as calculators often do not make a difference in a statement user's decision to invest in the company, they are immaterial (unimportant) and may be expensed when purchased.
However, because expensive items such as mainframe computers usually do make a difference in such a decision, they are material (important) and should be recorded as assets and depreciated.
Accountants should record all material items in a theoretically correct manner.
They may record immaterial items in a theoretically incorrect manner simply because it is more convenient and less expensive to do so.
For example, they may debit the cost of a wastebasket to an expense account rather than an asset account even though the wastebasket has an expected useful life of 30 years.
It simply is not worth the cost of recording depreciation expense on such a small item over its life.
The FASB defines materiality as "the magnitude of an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would have been changed or influenced by the omission or misstatement".3 The term magnitude in this definition suggests that the materiality of an item may be assessed by looking at its relative size.
A USD 10,000 error in an expense in a company with earnings of USD 30,000 is material.
The same error in a company earning USD 30,000,000 may not be material.
Materiality involves more than the relative dollar amounts.
Often the nature of the item makes it material.
For example, it may be quite significant to know that a company is paying bribes or making illegal political contributions, even if the dollar amounts of such items are relatively small.
Conservatism Conservatism means being cautious or prudent and making sure that assets and net income are not overstated.
Such overstatements can mislead potential investors in the company and creditors making loans to the company.
We apply conservatism when the lower-of-cost-or-market rule is used for inventory (see Chapter 7).
Accountants must realize a fine line exists between conservative and incorrect accounting.
See Exhibit 30 for a summary of the modifying conventions and their importance.
The next section of this chapter discusses the conceptual framework project of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

Also, conservative application of the matching principle involves making sure that adjustments for expenses for such items as uncollectible accounts, warranties, and depreciation are adequate.
Exhibit 30: Modifying conventions 6.9 The financial accounting standards board's conceptual framework project Experts have debated the exact nature of the basic concepts and related principles composing accounting theory for years.
The debate continues today despite numerous references to generally p. 269 of 433 accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
To date, all attempts to present a concise statement of GAAP have received only limited acceptance.
Due to this limited success, many accountants suggest that the starting point in reaching a concise statement of GAAP is to seek agreement on the objectives of financial accounting and reporting.
The belief is that if a person (1) carefully studies the environment, (2) knows what objectives are sought, (3) can identify certain qualitative traits of accounting information, and (4) can define the basic elements of financial statements, that person can discover the principles and standards leading to the stated objectives.
The FASB completed the first three goals by publishing "Objectives of Financial Reporting by Business Enterprises" and "Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information".4 Addressing the fourth goal are concepts statements entitled "Elements of Financial Statements of Business Enterprises" and "Elements of Financial Statements".5 6.10 Objectives of financial reporting Financial reporting objectives are the broad overriding goals sought by accountants engaging in financial reporting.
According to the FASB, the first objective of financial reporting is to: provide information that is useful to present and potential investors and creditors and other users in making rational investment, credit, and similar decisions.
The information should be comprehensible to those who have a reasonable understanding of business and economic activities and are willing to study the information with reasonable diligence.6 4FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.

1, p. viii.
p. 270 of 433 Interpreted broadly, the term other users includes employees, security analysts, brokers, and lawyers.
Financial reporting should provide information to all who are willing to learn to use it properly.
The second objective of financial reporting is to: provide information to help present and potential investors and creditors and other users in assessing the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of prospective cash receipts from dividends [owner withdrawals] or interest and the proceeds from the sale, redemption, or maturity of securities or loans.
Since investors' and creditors' cash flows are related to enterprise cash flows, financial reporting should provide information to help investors, creditors, and others assess the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of prospective net cash inflows to the related enterprise.7 This objective ties the cash flows of investors (owners) and creditors to the cash flows of the enterprise, a tie-in that appears entirely logical.
Enterprise cash inflows are the source of cash for dividends, interest, and the redemption of maturing debt.
Third, financial reporting should: provide information about the economic resources of an enterprise, the claims to those resources (obligations of the enterprise to transfer resources to other entities and owners' equity), and the effects of transactions, events, and circumstances that change its resources and claims to those resources.8 We can draw some conclusions from these three objectives and from a study of the environment in which financial reporting is carried out.
For example, financial reporting should:  Provide information about an enterprise's past performance because such information is a basis for predicting future enterprise performance.
 Focus on earnings and its components, despite the emphasis in the objectives on cash flows.
(Earnings computed under the accrual basis generally provide a better indicator of ability to generate favorable cash flows than do statements prepared under the cash basis.)
On the other hand, financial reporting does not seek to:  Measure the value of an enterprise but to provide information useful in determining its value.
 Evaluate management's performance, predict earnings, assess risk, or estimate earning power but to provide information to persons who wish to make these evaluations.
7Ibid.
8Ibid.
p. 271 of 433 These conclusions are some of those reached in Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.

As the Board stated, these statements "are intended to establish the objectives and concepts that the Financial Accounting Standards Board will use in developing standards of financial accounting and reporting".9 How successful the Board will be in the approach adopted remains to be seen.
6.11 Qualitative characteristics Accounting information should possess qualitative characteristics to be useful in decision making.
This criterion is difficult to apply.
The usefulness of accounting information in a given instance depends not only on information characteristics but also on the capabilities of the decision makers and their professional advisers.
Accountants cannot specify who the decision makers are, their characteristics, the decisions to be made, or the methods chosen to make the decisions.
Therefore, they direct their attention to the characteristics of accounting information.
Note the FASB's graphic summarization of the qualities accountants consider in Exhibit 3110 To have relevance, information must be pertinent to or affect a decision.
The information must make a difference to someone who does not already have it.
Relevant information makes a difference in a decision either by affecting users' predictions of outcomes of past, present, or future events or by confirming or correcting expectations.
Note that information need not be a prediction to be useful in developing, confirming, or altering expectations.
Expectations are commonly based on the present or past.
For example, any attempt to predict future earnings of a company would quite likely start with a review of present and past earnings.
Although information that merely confirms prior expectations may be less useful, it is still relevant because it reduces uncertainty.
Critics have alleged that certain types of accounting information lack relevance.
For example, some argue that a cost of USD 1 million paid for a tract of land 40 years ago and reported in the current balance sheet at that amount is irrelevant (except for possible tax implications) to users for decision making today.
Such criticism has encouraged research into the types of information relevant to users.
Some suggest using a different valuation basis, such as current cost, in reporting such assets.
Predictive value and feedback value Since actions taken now can affect only future events, information is obviously relevant when it possesses predictive value, or improves users' abilities to predict outcomes of events.
Information that reveals the relative success of users in predicting outcomes possesses feedback value.
Feedback reports on past activities and can make a difference in 9Ibid., p. i.
10FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.
2, p. 15. p. 272 of 433 decision making by (1) reducing uncertainty in a situation, (2) refuting or confirming prior expectations, and (3) providing a basis for further predictions.
For example, a report on the first quarter's earnings of a company reduces the uncertainty surrounding the amount of such earnings, confirms or refutes the predicted amount of such earnings, and provides a possible basis on which to predict earnings for the full year.
Remember that although accounting information may possess predictive value, it does not consist of predictions.
Making predictions is a function performed by the decision maker.
Timeliness Timeliness requires accountants to provide accounting information at a time when it may be considered in reaching a decision.
Utility of information decreases with age.
To know what the net income for 2010 was in early 2011 is much more useful than receiving this information a year later.
If information is to be of any value in decision making, it must be available before the decision is made.
If not, the information is of little value.
In determining what constitutes timely information, accountants consider the other qualitative characteristics and the cost of gathering information.
For example, a timely estimate for uncollectible accounts may be more valuable than a later, verified actual amount.
Timeliness alone cannot make information relevant, but potentially relevant information can be rendered irrelevant by a lack of timeliness.
Exhibit 31: A hierarchy of accounting qualities p. 273 of 433 In addition to being relevant, information must be reliable to be useful.
Information has reliability when it faithfully depicts for users what it purports to represent.
Thus, accounting information is reliable if users can depend on it to reflect the underlying economic activities of the organization.
The reliability of information depends on its representational faithfulness, verifiability, and neutrality.
The information must also be complete and free of bias.
Representational faithfulness To gain insight into this quality, consider a map.
When it shows roads and bridges where roads and bridges actually exist, a map possesses representational faithfulness.
A correspondence exists between what is on the map and what is present physically.
Similarly, representational faithfulness exists when accounting statements on economic activity correspond to the actual underlying activity.
Where there is no correspondence, the cause may be (1) bias or (2) lack of completeness.
 Effects of bias.
Accounting measurements contain bias if they are consistently too high or too low.
Accountants create bias in accounting measurements by choosing the wrong measurement method or introducing bias either deliberately or through lack of skill.
 Completeness.
To be free from bias, information must be sufficiently complete to ensure that it validly represents underlying events and conditions.
Completeness means disclosing all significant information in a way that aids understanding and does not mislead.
Firms can reduce the relevance of information by omitting information that would make a difference to users.
Currently, full disclosure requires presentation of a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of cash flows, and necessary notes to the financial statements and supporting schedules.
Also required in annual reports of corporations are statements of changes in stockholders' equity which contain information included in a statement of retained earnings.
Such statements must be complete, with items properly classified and segregated (such as reporting sales revenue separately from other revenues).
Required disclosures may be made in (1) the body of the financial statements, (2) the notes to such statements, (3) special communications, and/or (4) the president's letter or other management reports in the annual report.
Another aspect of completeness is fully disclosing all changes in accounting principles and their effects.11 Disclosure should include unusual activities (loans to officers), changes in expectations (losses on inventory), depreciation expense for the period, long-term obligations entered into that are not recorded by the accountant (a 20-year lease on a building), new arrangements with certain groups (pension and profit-sharing plans for employees), and significant events that occur after the date of the 11APB, APB Opinion No.
20, "Accounting Changes" (New York: AICPA, July 1971).
p. 274 of 433 statements (loss of a major customer).
Firms must also disclose accounting policies (major principles and their manner of application) followed in preparing the financial statements.12 Because of its emphasis on disclosure, we often call this aspect of reliability the full disclosure principle.
Verifiability Financial information has verifiability when independent measurers can substantially duplicate it by using the same measurement methods.
Verifiability eliminates measurer bias.
The requirement that financial information be based on objective evidence arises from the demonstrated needs of users for reliable, unbiased financial information.
Unbiased information is especially necessary when parties with opposing interests (credit seekers and credit grantors) rely on the same information.
If the information is verifiable, this enhances the reliability of information.
Financial information is never completely free of subjective opinion and judgment; it always possesses varying degrees of verifiability.
Canceled checks and invoices support some measurements.
Accountants can never verify other measurements, such as periodic depreciation charges, because of their very nature.
Thus, financial information in many instances is verifiable only in that it represents a consensus of what other accountants would report if they followed the same procedures.
Neutrality Neutrality means that the accounting information should be free of measurement method bias.
The primary concern should be relevance and reliability of the information that results from application of the principle, not the effect that the principle may have on a particular interest.
Non-neutral accounting information favors one set of interested parties over others.
For example, a particular form of measurement might favor stockholders over creditors, or vice versa.
"To be neutral, accounting information must report economic activity as faithfully as possible, without coloring the image it communicates for the purpose of influencing behavior in some particular direction.
"13 Accounting standards are not like tax regulations that deliberately foster or restrain certain types of activity.
Verifiability seeks to eliminate measurer bias; neutrality seeks to eliminate measurement method bias.
When comparability exists, reported differences and similarities in financial information are real and not the result of differing accounting treatments.
Comparable information reveals relative strengths and weaknesses in a single company through time and between two or more companies at the same time.
Consistency requires that a company use the same accounting principles and reporting practices through time.
Consistency leads to comparability of financial information for a single company 12APB, APB Opinion No.

13FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.
2, par.
100. p. 275 of 433 through time.
Comparability between companies is more difficult because they may account for the same activities in different ways.
For example, Company B may use one method of depreciation, while Company C accounts for an identical asset in similar circumstances using another method.
A high degree of inter-company comparability in accounting information does not exist unless accountants are required to account for the same activities in the same manner across companies and through time.
As we show in Exhibit 31, accountants must consider one pervasive constraint and one threshold for recognition in providing useful information.
First, the benefits secured from the information must be greater than the costs of providing that information.
Second, only material items need be disclosed and accounted for strictly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
We discussed cost-benefit and materiality earlier in the chapter.
An accounting perspective: Use of technology You may want to visit the home page of the Financial Accounting Standards Board at: http://www.fasb.org You can check out the latest developments at the FASB to see how the rules of accounting might be changing.
You can investigate facts about the FASB, press releases, exposure drafts, publications, emerging issues, board actions, forthcoming meetings, and many other topics.
6.12 The basic elements of financial statements Thus far we have discussed objectives of financial reporting and qualitative characteristics of accounting information.
A third important task in developing a conceptual framework for any discipline is identifying and defining its basic elements.
The FASB identified and defined the basic elements of financial statements in Concepts Statement No.
3.
Later, Concepts Statement No.
6 revised some of the definitions.
We defined most of the terms earlier in this text in a less technical way; the more technical definitions follow.
(These items are not repeated in this chapter's Key terms.)
Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events.
Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events.
Equity or net assets is the residual interest in the assets of an entity that remains after deducting its liabilities.
In a business enterprise, the equity is the ownership interest.
In a not-for-profit p. 276 of 433 organization, which has no ownership interest in the same sense as a business enterprise, net assets is divided into three classes based on the presence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions— permanently restricted, temporarily restricted, and unrestricted net assets.
Comprehensive income is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
Revenues are inflows or other enhancements of assets of any entity or settlements of its liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing major or central operations.
Expenses are outflows or other using up of assets or incurrences of liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing major or central operations.
Gains are increases in equity (net assets) from peripheral or incidental transactions of an entity and from all other transactions and other events and circumstances affecting the entity except those that result from revenues or investments by owners.
Losses are decreases in equity (net assets) from peripheral or incidental transactions of an entity and from all other transactions and other events and circumstances affecting the entity except those that result from expenses or distributions to owners.
Investments by owners are increases in equity of a particular business enterprise resulting from transfers to it from other entities of something valuable to obtain or increase ownership interests (or equity) in it.
Assets are most commonly received as investments by owners, but that which is received may also include services or satisfaction or conversion of liabilities of the enterprise.
Distributions to owners are decreases in equity of a particular business enterprise resulting from transferring assets, rendering services, or incurring liabilities by the enterprise to owners.
Distributions to owners decrease ownership interest (or equity) in an enterprise.14 14FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.
6. p. 277 of 433 An accounting perspective: Business insight Accountants record expenditures on physical resources such as land, buildings, and equipment that benefit future periods as assets.
However, they expense expenditures on human resources for hiring and training that benefit future periods.
Also, when a computer is dropped and destroyed, accountants record a loss.
However, when the president of the company dies, they record no loss.
Should the accounting model be changed regarding the accounting for human resources?
6.13 Recognition and measurement in financial statements In December 1984, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.
5, "Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises", describing recognition criteria and providing guidance for the timing and nature of information included in financial statements.15 The recognition criteria established in the Statement are fairly consistent with those used in current practice.
The Statement indicates, however, that when information more useful than currently reported information is available at a reasonable cost, it should be included in financial statements.
6.14 Summary of significant accounting policies As part of their annual reports, companies include summaries of significant accounting policies.
These policies assist users in interpreting the financial statements.
To a large extent, accounting theory determines the nature of these policies.
Companies must follow generally accepted accounting principles in preparing their financial statements.
The accounting policies of The Walt Disney Company, one of the world's leading entertainment companies, as contained in a recent annual report follow.
After each, the chapter of this text where we discuss that particular policy is in parentheses.
While a few of the items have already been covered, the remainder offer a preview of the concepts explained in later chapters.

4, it pertains to accounting for not-for-profit organizations and is, therefore, not relevant to this text.)
p. 278 of 433 An ethical perspective: Maplehurst company Maplehurst Company manufactures large spinning machines for the textile industry.
The company had purchased USD 100,000 of small hand tools to use in its business.
The company's accountant recorded the tools in an asset account and was going to write them off over 20 years.
Management wanted to write these tools off as an expense of this year because revenues this year had been abnormally high and were expected to be lower in the future.
Management's goal was to smooth out income rather than showing sharp increases and decreases.
When told by the accountant that USD 100,000 was a material item that must be accounted for in a theoretically correct manner, management decided to consider the tools as consisting of 10 groups, each having a cost of USD 10,000.
Since amounts under USD 20,000 are considered immaterial for this company, all of the tools could then be charged to expense this year.
The accountant is concerned about this treatment.
She doubts that she could successfully defend management's position if the auditors challenge the expensing of these items.
6.15 Significant accounting policies 6.15.1 Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of inter-company accounts and transactions.
Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for using the equity method.
(Chapter 14) 6.15.2 Accounting changes The Company changed its method of accounting for pre-opening costs (see Note 12).
These changes had no cash impact.
The pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated statement of income reflect the effect of retroactive application of expensing pre-opening costs.
(Chapters 13 and 14) 6.15.3 Revenue recognition Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized when motion pictures are exhibited.
Television licensing revenues are recorded when the program material is available for p. 279 of 433 telecasting by the licensee and when certain other conditions are met.
Revenues from video sales are recognized on the date that video units are made widely available for sale by retailers.
Revenues from participants and sponsors at the theme parks are generally recorded over the period of the applicable agreements commencing with the opening of the related attraction.
(Chapter 5) 6.15.4 Cash, cash equivalents and investments Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.
(Chapter 8) SFAS 115 requires that certain investments in debt and equity securities be classified into one of three categories.
Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as "held-to-maturity" and reported at amortized cost.
Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and marketable equity securities are classified as either "trading" or "available-for-sale", and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings or stockholders' equity, respectively.
(Chapter 14) 6.15.5 Merchandise inventories Carrying amounts of merchandise, materials and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are stated at the lower of cost or market.
(Chapter 7) 6.15.6 Film and television costs Film and television production and participation costs are expensed based on the ratio of the current period's gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues from all sources on an individual production basis.
Estimates of total gross revenues are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted accordingly.
Television broadcast rights are amortized principally on an accelerated basis over the estimated useful lives of the programs.
(Chapter 11) 6.15.7 Theme parks, resorts and other property Theme parks, resorts and other property are carried at cost.
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives ranging from three to fifty years.
(Chapter 3) 6.15.8 Other assets Rights to the name, likeness and portrait of Walt Disney, goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from two to forty years.
(Chapter 11) p. 280 of 433  6.15.9 Risk management contracts In the normal course of business, the Company employs a variety of off-balance-sheet financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements, forward and option contracts, and interest rate exchange-traded futures.
The company designates interest rate and cross-currency swaps as hedges of investments and debt, and accrues the differential to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change over the lives of the contracts.
Differences paid or received on swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest income or expense over the life of the swaps, thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying investment or obligation.
Gains and losses on the termination of swap agreements, prior to the original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest income or expense over the original term of the swaps.
Gains and losses arising from interest rate futures, forwards and option contracts, and foreign currency forward and option contracts are recognized in income or expense as offsets of gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions.
(Chapter 14) Cash flows from interest rate and foreign exchange risk management activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the related investment, borrowing or foreign exchange activity.
(Chapter 16) The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments as held or issued for purposes other than trading.
(Chapter 14) 6.15.10 Earnings per share Earnings per share amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year.
Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an antidilutive effect.
(Chapter 13) As you proceed through the remaining chapters, you can see the accounting theories introduced in this chapter being applied.
In Chapter 6, for instance, we discuss why sales revenue is recognized and recorded only after goods have been delivered to the customer.
So far, we have used service companies to illustrate accounting techniques.
Chapter 6 introduces merchandising operations.
Merchandising companies, such as clothing stores, buy goods in their finished form and sell them to customers.
p. 281 of 433  6.16 Understanding the learning objectives  The major underlying assumptions or concepts of accounting are (1) business entity, (2) going concern (continuity), (3) money measurement, (4) stable dollar, (5) periodicity, and (6) accrual basis and periodicity.
 Other basic accounting concepts that affect the accounting for entities are (1) general-purpose financial statements, (2) substance over form, (3) consistency, (4) double entry, and (5) articulation.
 The major principles include exchange-price (or cost), revenue recognition, matching, gain and loss recognition, and full disclosure.
Major exceptions to the realization principle include cash collection as point of revenue recognition, installment basis of revenue recognition, and the percentage-of-completion method of recognizing revenue on long-term construction projects.
 Modifying conventions include cost-benefit, materiality, and conservatism.
 The FASB has defined the objectives of financial reporting, qualitative characteristics of accounting information, and elements of financial statements.
 Financial reporting objectives are the broad overriding goals sought by accountants engaging in financial reporting.
 Qualitative characteristics are those that accounting information should possess to be useful in decision making.
The two primary qualitative characteristics are relevance and reliability.
Another qualitative characteristic is comparability.
 Pervasive constraints include cost-benefit analysis and materiality.
 The FASB has identified and defined the basic elements of financial statements.
 The FASB has also described revenue recognition criteria and provided guidance as to the timing and nature of information to be included in financial statements.
 The summary of significant accounting policies aid users in interpreting the financial statements.
 To a large extent, accounting theory determines the nature of those policies.
6.16.1 Demonstration problem For each of the following transactions or circumstances and the entries made, state which, if any, of the assumptions, concepts, principles, or modifying conventions of accounting have been violated.
For each violation, give the entry to correct the improper accounting assuming the books have not been closed.
During the year, Dorsey Company did the following: p. 282 of 433  Had its buildings appraised.
They were found to have a market value of USD 410,000, although their book value was only USD 380,000.
The accountant debited the Buildings and Accumulated Depreciation—Buildings accounts for USD 15,000 each and credited Paid-in Capital—From Appreciation.
No separate mention was made of this action in the financial statements.
 Purchased new electric pencil sharpeners for its offices at a total cost of USD 60.
These pencil sharpeners were recorded as assets and are being depreciated over five years.
6.16.1.1 Solution to demonstration problem  The cost principle and the modifying convention of conservatism may have been violated.
Such write-ups simply are not looked on with favor in accounting.
To correct the situation, the entry made needs to be reversed: Paid-in Capital 30,000 Building 15,000 Accumulated Depreciation—Building 15,000  Theoretically, no violations occurred, but the cost of compiling insignificant information could be considered a violation of acceptable accounting practice.
As a practical matter, the USD 60 could have been expensed on materiality grounds.
6.16.2 Key terms Accounting theory "A set of basic concepts and assumptions and related principles that explain and guide the accountant's actions in identifying, measuring, and communicating economic information".
Bias Exists when accounting measurements are consistently too high or too low.
Business entity concept The specific unit for which accounting information is gathered.
Business entities have a separate existence from owners, creditors, employees, customers, other interested parties, and other businesses.
Comparability A qualitative characteristic of accounting information; when information is comparable, it reveals differences and similarities that are real and are not the result of differing accounting treatments.
Completed-contract method A method of recognizing revenue on long-term projects under which no revenue is recognized until the period in which the project is completed; similar to recognizing revenue upon the completion of a sale.
Completeness A qualitative characteristic of accounting information; requires disclosure of all significant information in a way that aids understanding and does not mislead; sometimes called the full disclosure principle.
Conservatism Being cautious or prudent and making sure that net assets and net income are not overstated.
Consistency Requires a company to use the same accounting principles and reporting practices through time.
p. 283 of 433 Cost-benefit consideration Determining whether benefits of including information in financial statements exceed costs.
Cost principle See Exchange-price principle.
Earning principle The requirement that revenue be substantially earned before it is recognized (recorded).
Exchange-price (or cost) principle Transfers of resources are recorded at prices agreed on by the parties at the time of the exchange.
Feedback value A qualitative characteristic that information has when it reveals the relative success of users in predicting outcomes.
Financial reporting objectives The broad overriding goals sought by accountants engaging in financial reporting.
Full disclosure principle Information important enough to influence the decisions of an informed user of the financial statements should be disclosed.
Gain and loss recognition principle Gains may be recorded only when realized, but losses should be recorded when they first become evident.
Gains Typically result from the sale of long-term assets for more than their book value.
Going-concern (continuity) assumption The assumption that an entity will continue to operate indefinitely unless strong evidence exists that the entity will terminate.
Historical cost The amount paid, or the fair market value of a liability incurred or other resources surrendered, to acquire an asset and place it in a condition and position for its intended use.
Installment basis A revenue recognition procedure in which the percentage of total gross margin recognized in a period on an installment sale is equal to the percentage of total cash from the sale that is received in that period.
Liquidation Terminating a business by ceasing business operations and selling off its assets.
Losses Asset expirations that are usually involuntary and do not create revenues.
Matching principle Expenses should be recognized as they are incurred to produce revenues.
Materiality A modifying convention that allows the accountant to deal with immaterial (unimportant) items in an expedient but theoretically incorrect manner; also a qualitative characteristic specifying that financial accounting report only information significant enough to influence decisions or evaluations.
Modifying conventions Customs emerging from accounting practice that alter the results obtained from a strict application of accounting principles; conservatism is an example.
Money measurement Use of a monetary unit of measurement, such as the dollar, instead of physical or other units of measurement—feet, inches, grams, and so on.
Neutrality A qualitative characteristic that requires accounting information to be free of measurement method bias.
Percentage-of-completion method A method of recognizing revenue based on the estimated stage of completion of a long-term project.
The stage of completion is measured by comparing actual costs incurred in a period with total estimated costs to be incurred in all periods.
Period costs Costs that cannot be traced to specific products and are expensed in the period incurred.
p. 284 of 433 Periodicity (time periods) assumption An assumption of the accountant that an entity's life can be divided into time periods for reporting its economic activities.
Predictive value A qualitative characteristic that information has when it improves users' abilities to predict outcomes of events.
Product costs Costs incurred in the acquisition or manufacture of goods.
Product costs are accounted for as if they were attached to the goods, with the result that they are charged to expense when the goods are sold.
Qualitative characteristics Characteristics that accounting information should possess to be useful in decision making.
Realization principle A principle that directs that revenue is recognized only after the seller acquires the right to receive payment from the buyer.
Relevance A qualitative characteristic requiring that information be pertinent to or affect a decision.
Reliability A qualitative characteristic requiring that information faithfully depict for users what it purports to represent.
Representational faithfulness A qualitative characteristic requiring that accounting statements on economic activity correspond to the actual underlying activity.
Revenue recognition principle The principle that revenues should be earned and realized before they are recognized (recorded).
Stable dollar assumption An assumption that the dollar is a reasonably stable unit of measurement.
Timeliness A qualitative characteristic requiring that accounting information be provided at a time when it may be considered before making a decision.
Verifiability A qualitative characteristic of accounting information; information is verifiable when it can be substantially duplicated by independent measurers using the same measurement methods.
6.16.3 Self-test True-false Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or false.
o The business entity concept assumes that each business has an existence separate from all parties except its owners.
o When the substance of a transaction differs from its legal form, the accountant should record the economic substance.

6.16.8 Beyond the numbers—Critical thinking Business decision case A Jim Casey recently received his accounting degree from State University and went to work for a Big-Four CPA firm.
After he had been with the firm for about six months, he was sent to the Ling Clothing Company to work on the audit.
He was not very confident of his knowledge at this early point in his career.
He noticed, however, that some of the company's transactions and events were recorded in a way that might be in violation of accounting theory and generally accepted accounting principles.
Study each of the following facts to see if the auditors should challenge the financial accounting practices used or the intentions of management.
Write your decisions and the reasoning behind your conclusions.
This problem can serve as an opportunity to apply accounting theory to situations with which you are not yet familiar and as a preview of future chapters.
Some of the following situations relate to material you have already covered, and some situations relate to material to be covered in future chapters.
After each item, we have given an indication of the chapter in which that item is discussed.
You may research future chapters to find the correct answer.
Alternatively, you could use your present knowledge of accounting theory to determine whether or not Casey should challenge each of the p. 297 of 433 financial accounting practices used.
Realize, however, that some generally accepted accounting practices were based on compromise and seem to differ with accounting theory as described in this chapter.
One of the senior members of management stated the company planned to replace all of the furniture next year.
He said that the cash in the Accumulated Depreciation account would be used to pay for the furniture.
(Ch.
3) The company held the books open at the end of 2010 so they could record some early 2011 sales as 2010 revenue.
The justification for this practice was that 2010 was not a good year for profits.
(Ch.
3, 5, 6) The company's buildings were appraised for insurance purposes.
The appraised values were USD 10,000,000 higher than the book value.
The accountant debited Buildings and credited Paid-in Capital from Appreciation for the difference.
(Ch.
5) The company recorded purchases of merchandise at the list price rather than the gross selling (invoice) price.
(Ch.
6) Goods shipped to the company from a supplier, FOB destination, were debited to Purchases.
The goods were not included in ending inventory because the goods had not yet arrived.
(Ch.
5, 6) The company counted some items twice in taking the physical inventory at the end of the year.
The person taking the inventory said he had forgotten to include some items in last year's physical inventory, and counting some items twice would make up for the items missed last year so that net income this year would be about correct.
(Ch.
7) The company switched from FIFO to LIFO in accounting for inventories.
The preceding year it had switched from the weighted-average method to FIFO.
The reason given for the most recent change was that federal income taxes would be lower.
No indication of this switch was to appear in the financial statements.
(Ch.
5, 7) Since things were pretty hectic at year-end, the accountant made no effort to reconcile the bank account.
His reason was that the bank probably had not made any errors.
The bank balance was lower than the book balance, so the accountant debited Miscellaneous Expense and credited Cash for the difference.
(Ch.
8) When a customer failed to pay the amount due, the accountant debited Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts and credited Accounts Receivable.
The amount of accounts written off in this manner was huge.
(Ch.
9) p. 298 of 433 A completely depreciated machine was still being used.
The accountant left the asset and its related accumulated depreciation on the books, stopped recording depreciation on the machine, and did not go back and correct earlier years' net income and reduce accumulated depreciation.
(Ch.
10) The accountant stated that even though research and development costs incurred to develop a new product would benefit future periods, these costs must be expensed as incurred.
This year USD 200,000 of these costs were charged to expense.
(Ch.
11) An old truck was traded for a new truck.
Since the trade-in value of the old truck was higher than its book value, a gain was recorded on the transaction.

Merchandising transactions p. 301 of 433  7 Introduction to inventories and the classified income statement 7.1 Learning objective After studying this chapter, you should be able to:  Record journal entries for sales transactions involving merchandise.
 Describe briefly cost of goods sold and the distinction between perpetual and periodic inventory procedures.
 Record journal entries for purchase transactions involving merchandise.
 Describe the freight terms and record transportation costs.
 Determine cost of goods sold.
 Prepare a classified income statement.
 Analyze and use the financial results—gross margin percentage.
 Prepare a work sheet and closing entries for a merchandising company (Appendix).
7.2 A career as a CEO Are you a leader?
Would you enjoy someday becoming the president or chief executive officer (CEO) of the company you work for?
Then you should consider a degree in accounting.
The accounting field greatly values individuals with leadership potential.
Accounting students with the most job offers and the highest starting salaries are also likely to be the ones who best demonstrate an ability to lead others.
Recruiters in public accounting (i.e.
auditing, tax, consulting) and private accounting (i.e.
financial reporting, cost accounting, financial analysis, internal auditing) alike demonstrate a strong preference for students with leadership potential.
Fortunately, you do not have to run a company to demonstrate leadership abilities to college recruiters.
Some examples of leadership potential that would look good on a resume include organizing a successful fund-raiser, participating effectively as an officer in a student club, or taking the lead in a group project.
If you do not have a resume yet, stop by the career placement center at your college and ask them to assist you in preparing one.
Many students at your level already have a resume, and it takes time to refine and develop an effective one.
A well-prepared resume will be important for securing internship opportunities and part-time work in the business field, as well as for landing that first job upon graduation.
p. 302 of 433 Did you know that the chief executive officers (CEO) of many of the largest manufacturing, merchandising, and service organizations in the United States have degrees in accounting?
James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Gary C. Kelly of Southwest Airlines, Phil Knight of Nike, James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips, and Indra K. Nooyi of PepsiCo all have degrees in accounting.
It is really not that surprising that accounting majors are so successful, as accounting provides an excellent foundation in business.
With a strong accounting foundation and the continued development of leadership abilities over your career, you might become a CEO yourself someday.
Your study of accounting began with service companies as examples because they are the least complicated type of business.
You are now ready to apply the accounting process to a more complex business—a merchandising company.
Although the fundamental accounting concepts for service businesses apply to merchandising businesses, merchandise accounting requires some additional accounts and techniques to record sales and purchases.
The normal flow of goods from manufacturer to final customer is as follows: Manufacturers produce goods from raw materials and normally sell them to wholesalers.
After performing certain functions, such as packaging or labeling, wholesalers sell the goods to retailers.
Retailers sell the goods to final customers.
The two middle boxes in the diagram represent merchandising companies.
These companies buy goods in finished form for resale.
This chapter begins by comparing the income statement of a service company with that of a merchandising company.
Then, we describe (1) how to record merchandise-related transactions (2) a classified income statement and (3) the gross margin percentage.
Finally, in the appendix we explain the work sheet and the closing process for a merchandising company.
p. 303 of 433 SERVICE COMPANY MERCHANDISING COMPANY Income Statement Income Statement For the Year Ended 2010 December 31 For the Year Ended 2010 December 31 Service revenues $13,200 Sales revenues $262,000 Cost of goods sold 159,000 Gross Margin $103,000 Expenses 6,510 Expenses 74,900 Net income $ 6,690 Net income $ 28,100 Exhibit 32: Condensed income statements of a service company and a merchandising company compared 7.3 Two income statements compared— Service company and merchandising company In Exhibit 32 we compare the main divisions of an income statement for a service company with those for a merchandising company.
To determine profitability or net income, a service company deducts total expenses incurred from revenues earned.
A merchandising company is a more complex business and, therefore, has a more complex income statement.
As shown in Exhibit 32, merchandising companies must deduct from revenues the cost of the goods they sell to customers to arrive at gross margin.
Then, they deduct other expenses.
The income statement of a merchandising company has three main divisions: (1) sales revenues, which result from the sale of goods by the company; (2) cost of goods sold, which is an expense that indicates how much the company paid for the goods sold; and (3) expenses, which are the company's other expenses in running the business.
In the next two sections we discuss the first two main divisions of the income statement of a merchandising company.
The third division (expenses) is similar to expenses for a service company, which we illustrated in preceding chapters.
As you study these sections, keep in mind how the divisions of the merchandising income statement are related to each other and produce the final figure—net income or net loss—which indicates the profitability of the company.
7.4 Sales revenues The sale of goods occurs between two parties.
The seller of the goods transfers them to the buyer in exchange for cash or a promise to pay at a later date.
This exchange is a relatively simple business p. 304 of 433 transaction.
Sellers make sales to create revenues; this inflow of assets in the form of cash or accounts receivable results from selling goods to customers.
In Exhibit 32, we show a condensed income statement to emphasize its major divisions.
Next, we describe the more complete income statement actually prepared by accountants.
The merchandising company that we use to illustrate the income statement is Hanlon Retail Food Store.
This section explains how to record sales revenues, including the effect of trade discounts.
Then, we explain how to record two deductions from sales revenues—sales discounts and sales returns and allowances (Exhibit 33).
The amount that remains is net sales.
The formula for determining net sales is: Net sales = Gross sales - (Sales discounts + Sales returns and allowances) HANLON RETAIL FOOD STORE Partial income Statement For the Year Ended 2010 December 31 Operating revenues: Gross sales $282,000 Less: Sales discounts $ 5,000 Sales returns and allowances 15,000 20,000 Net sales $262,000 Exhibit 33: Partial income statement of merchandising company BRYAN WHOLESALE CO.

5868-24393 200 $100 $20,000 Total $20,000 Exhibit 34: Invoice In a sales transaction, the seller transfers the legal ownership (title) of the goods to the buyer.
Usually, the physical delivery of the goods occurs at the same time as the sale of the goods.
A business document called an invoice (a sales invoice for the seller and a purchase invoice for the buyer) becomes the basis for recording the sale.
p. 305 of 433 An invoice is a document prepared by the seller of merchandise and sent to the buyer.
The invoice contains the details of a sale, such as the number of units sold, unit price, total price billed, terms of sale, and manner of shipment.
A retail company prepares the invoice at the point of sale.
A wholesale company, which supplies goods to retailers, prepares the invoice after the shipping department notifies the accounting department that it has shipped the goods to the retailer.
Exhibit 34 is an example of an invoice prepared by a wholesale company for goods sold to a retail company.
Using the invoice as the source document, a wholesale company records the revenue from the sale at the time of the sale for the following reasons:  The seller has passed legal title of the goods to the buyer, and the goods are now the responsibility and property of the buyer.
 The seller has established the selling price of the goods.
 The seller has completed its obligation.
 The seller has exchanged the goods for another asset, such as cash or accounts receivable.
 The seller can determine the costs incurred in selling the goods.
Each time a company makes a sale, the company earns revenue.
This revenue increases a revenue account called Sales.
Recall from Chapter 2 that credits increase revenues.
Therefore, the firm credits the Sales account for the amount of the sale.
Usually sales are for cash or on account.
When a sale is for cash, the company credits the Sales account and debits Cash.
For example, it records a USD 20,000 sale for cash as follows: Cash (+A) 20,000 Sales (+SE) 20,000 To record the sales of merchandise for cash.
When a sale is on account, it credits the Sales account and debits Accounts Receivable.
The following entry records a USD 20,000 sale on account: Accounts Receivable (+A) 20,000 Sales (+SE) 20,000 To record the sales of merchandise on account.
Usually, a seller quotes the gross selling price, also called the invoice price, of goods to the buyer.
However, sometimes a seller quotes a list price of goods along with available trade discounts.
In this latter situation, the buyer must calculate the gross selling price.
The list price less all trade discounts is the gross selling price.
Merchandising companies that sell goods use the gross selling price as the credit to sales.
p. 306 of 433 An accounting perspective: Uses of technology A database management system stores related data—such as monthly sales data (salespersons, customers, products, and sales amounts)—independent of the application.
Once you have defined this information to the database management system, you can use commands to answer such questions as: Which products have been sold to which customers?
What are the amounts of sales by individual salespersons?
You could also print a customer list sorted by ZIP code, the alphabet, or salesperson.
A trade discount is a percentage deduction, or discount, from the specified list price or catalog price of merchandise.
Companies use trade discounts to:  Reduce the cost of catalog publication.
A seller can use a catalog for a longer time by printing list prices in the catalog and giving separate discount sheets to salespersons whenever prices change.
 Grant quantity discounts.
 Allow quotation of different prices to various customers, such as retailers and wholesalers.
The seller's invoice may show trade discounts.
However, sellers do not record trade discounts in their accounting records because the discounts are used only to calculate the gross selling price.
Nor do trade discounts appear on the books of the purchaser.
To illustrate, assume an invoice contains the following data: List price, 200 swimsuits at $24 $4,800 Less: Trade discount, 30% 1,440 Gross selling price (invoice price) $3,360 The seller records a sale of USD 3,360.
The purchaser records a purchase of USD 3,360.
Thus, neither the seller nor the purchaser enters list prices and trade discounts on their books.
Sometimes the list price of a product is subject to several trade discounts; this series of discounts is a chain discount.
Chain discounts exist, for example, when a wholesaler receives two trade discounts for services performed, such as packaging and distributing.
When more than one discount is given, the buyer applies each discount to the declining balance successively.
If a product has a list price of USD 100 and is subject to trade discounts of 20 per cent and 10 per cent, the gross selling price (invoice price) would be USD 100 - 0.2(USD 100) = USD 80; USD 80 - 0.1(USD 80) = USD 72, computed as follows: List price $100 p. 307 of 433 Less 20% - 20 $ 80 Less 10% ■ 8 Gross selling price (invoice price) $ 72 You could obtain the same results by multiplying the list price by the complements of the trade discounts allowed.
The complement of 20 per cent is 80 per cent because 20 per cent + 80 per cent = 100 per cent.
The complement of 10 per cent is 90 per cent because 10 per cent + 90 per cent = 100 per cent.
Thus, the gross selling price is USD 100 X 0.8 X 0.9 = USD 72.
Two common deductions from gross sales are (1) sales discounts and (2) sales returns and allowances.
Sellers record these deductions in contra revenue accounts to the Sales account.
Contra accounts have normal balances that are opposite to the balance of the account they reduce.
For example, since the Sales account normally has a credit balance, the Sales Discounts account and Sales Returns and Allowances account have debit balances.
We explain the methods of recording these contra revenue accounts next.
Sales discounts Whenever a company sells goods on account, it clearly specifies terms of payment on the invoice.
For example, the invoice in Exhibit 34 states the terms of payment as "net 30".
Net 30 is sometimes written as "n/30".
Either way, this term means that the buyer may not take a discount and must pay the entire amount of the invoice (USD 20,000) on or before 30 days after 2010 December 19 (invoice date)—or 2011 January 18.
In Exhibit 34, if the terms had read "n/10/EOM" (EOM means end of month), the buyer could not take a discount, and the invoice would be due on the 10th day of the month following the month of sale—or 2011 January 10. Credit terms vary from industry to industry.
In some industries, credit terms include a cash discount of 1 per cent to 3 per cent to induce early payment of an amount due.
A cash discount is a deduction from the invoice price that can be taken only if the invoice is paid within a specified time.
A cash discount differs from a trade discount in that a cash discount is a deduction from the gross selling price for the prompt payment of an invoice.
In contrast, a trade discount is a deduction from the list price to determine the gross selling price (or invoice price).
Sellers call a cash discount a sales discount and buyers call it a purchase discount.
Companies often state cash discount terms as follows:  2/10, n/30—means a buyer who pays within 10 days following the invoice date may deduct a discount of 2 per cent of the invoice price.
If payment is not made within the discount period, the entire invoice price is due 30 days from the invoice date.
p. 308 of 433  2/EOM, n/60—means a buyer who pays by the end of the month of purchase may deduct a 2 per cent discount from the invoice price.
If payment is not made within the discount period, the entire invoice price is due 60 days from the invoice date.
 2/10/EOM, n/60—means a buyer who pays by the 10th of the month following the month of purchase may deduct a 2 per cent discount from the invoice price.
If payment is not made within the discount period, the entire invoice price is due 60 days from the invoice date.
Sellers cannot record the sales discount before they receive the payment since they do not know when the buyer will pay the invoice.
A cash discount taken by the buyer reduces the cash that the seller actually collects from the sale of the goods, so the seller must indicate this fact in its accounting records.
The following entries show how to record a sale and a subsequent sales discount.
Assume that on July 12, a business sold merchandise for USD 2,000 on account; terms are 2/10, n/30.
On July 21 (nine days after invoice date), the business received a USD 1,960 check in payment of the account.
The required journal entries for the seller are: July 12 Accounts Receivable (+A) 2,000 Sales (+SE) 2,000 To record sale on account; terms 2/10, n/30 21 Cash (+A) 1,960 Sales Discounts (-SE; Contra-Revenue Account) 40 Accounts Receivable (-A) 2,000 To record collection on account, less a discount.
The Sales Discounts account is a contra revenue account to the Sales account.
In the income statement, the seller deducts this contra revenue account from gross sales.
Sellers use the Sales Discounts account (rather than directly reducing the Sales account) so management can examine the sales discounts figure to evaluate the company's sales discount policy.
Note that the Sales Discounts account is not an expense incurred in generating revenue.
Rather, the purpose of the account is to reduce recorded revenue to the amount actually realized from the sale.
Sales returns and allowances Merchandising companies usually allow customers to return goods that are defective or unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons, such as wrong color, wrong size, wrong style, wrong amounts, or inferior quality.
In fact, when their policy is satisfaction guaranteed, some companies allow customers to return goods simply because they do not like the merchandise.
A sales return is merchandise returned by a buyer.
Sellers and buyers regard a sales return as a cancellation of a sale.
Alternatively, some customers keep unsatisfactory goods, and the seller gives p. 309 of 433 them an allowance off the original price.
A sales allowance is a deduction from the original invoiced sales price granted when the customer keeps the merchandise but is dissatisfied for any of a number of reasons, including inferior quality, damage, or deterioration in transit.
When a seller agrees to the sales return or sales allowance, the seller sends the buyer a credit memorandum indicating a reduction (crediting) of the buyer's account receivable.
A credit memorandum is a document that provides space for the name and address of the concerned parties, followed by a space for the reason for the credit and the amount to be credited.
A credit memorandum becomes the basis for recording a sales return or a sales allowance.
In theory, sellers could record both sales returns and sales allowances as debits to the Sales account because they cancel part of the recorded selling price.
However, because the amount of sales returns and sales allowances is useful information to management, it should be shown separately.
The amount of returns and allowances in relation to goods sold can indicate the quality of the goods (high-return percentage, equals low quality) or of pressure applied by salespersons (high-return percentage, equals high-pressure sales).
Thus, sellers record sales returns and sales allowances in a separate Sales Returns and Allowances account.
The Sales Returns and Allowances account is a contra revenue account (to Sales) that records the selling price of merchandise returned by buyers or reductions in selling prices granted.
(Some companies use separate accounts for sales returns and for sales allowances, but this text does not.)
Following are two examples illustrating the recording of sales returns in the Sales Returns and Allowances account:  Assume that a customer returns USD 300 of goods sold on account.
If payment has not yet been received, the required entry is:  Sales Returns and Allowances (-SE) 300 Accounts Receivable (-A) 300 To record a sales return from a customer.
 Assume that the customer has already paid the account and the seller gives the customer a cash refund.
Now, the credit is to Cash rather than to Accounts Receivable.
If the customer has taken a 2 per cent discount when paying the account, the company would return to the customer the sales price less the sales discount amount.
For example, if a customer returns goods that sold for USD 300, on which a 2 per cent discount was taken, the following entry would be made: p. 310 of 433 Sales Returns and Allowances (-SE) 300 Cash (-A) 294 Sales Discount (+SE) 6 To record a sales return from a customer who had taken a discount and was sent a cash refund.
The debit to the Sales Returns and Allowances account is for the full selling price of the purchase.
The credit of USD 6 reduces the balance of the Sales Discounts account.
Next, we illustrate the recording of a sales allowance in the Sales Returns and Allowances account.
Assume that a company grants a USD 400 allowance to a customer for damage resulting from improperly packed merchandise.
If the customer has not yet paid the account, the required entry would be: Sales Returns and Allowances (-SE) 400 Accounts Receivable (-A) 400 To record a sales allowance granted for damaged merchandise.
If the customer has already paid the account, the credit is to Cash instead of Accounts Receivable.
If the customer took a 2 per cent discount when paying the account, the company would refund only the net amount (USD 392).
Sales Discounts would be credited for USD 8.
The entry would be: Sales Returns and Allowances (-SE) 400 Cash (-A) 392 Sales Discount (+SE) 8 To record a sales allowance when a customer has paid and taken a 2% discount.
HANLON RETAIL FOOD STORE Partial income Statement For the Year Ended 2010 December 31, Operating revenues: Gross sales $282,000 Less: Sales discounts $ 5,000 Sales returns and allowances 15,000 20,000 Net sales $262,000 *This illustration is the same as Exhibit 33, repeated here for your convenience.
Exhibit 35: Partial income statement* p. 311 of 433 Exhibit 35 shows how a company could report sales, sales discounts, and sales returns and allowances in the income statement.
More often, the income statement in a company's annual report begins with "Net sales" because sales details are not important to external financial statement users.
An accounting perspective: Business insight When examining a company's sales cycle, management and users of financial data should be aware of any seasonal changes that may affect its reported sales.
A national retailer of personal computers and related products and services, for example, should include wording similar to that in the following paragraph in its Annual Report describing seasonality.
Seasonality Based upon its operating history, the company believes that its business is seasonal.
Excluding the effects of new store openings, net sales and earnings are generally lower during the first and fourth fiscal quarters than in the second and third fiscal quarters.
An accounting perspective: Business insight For many retailers a large percentage of their annual sales occurs during the period from Thanksgiving to Christmas.
They attempt to stock just the right amount of goods to meet demand.
Since this is a difficult estimate to make accurately, many retailers end up with a large amount of unsold goods at the end of this season.
The only way they can unload these goods is to offer huge discounts during the following period.
7.5 Cost of goods sold The second main division of an income statement for a merchandising business is cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold is the cost to the seller of the goods sold to customers.
For a merchandising company, the cost of goods sold can be relatively large.
All merchandising companies have a quantity of goods on hand called merchandise inventory to sell to customers.
Merchandise inventory (or inventory) is the quantity of goods available for sale at any given time.
Cost of goods sold is determined by computing the cost of (1) the beginning inventory, (2) the net cost of goods purchased, and (3) the ending inventory.
Look at the cost of goods sold section of Hanlon Retail Food Store's income statement in Exhibit 36.
The merchandise inventory on 2010 January 1, was USD 24,000.
The net cost of purchases for the year p. 312 of 433 was USD 166,000.
Thus, Hanlon had USD 190,000 of merchandise available for sale during 2010.
On 2010 December 31, the merchandise inventory was USD 31,000, meaning that this amount was left unsold.
Subtracting the unsold inventory (the ending inventory), USD 31,000, from the amount Hanlon had available for sale during the year, USD 190,000, gives the cost of goods sold for the year of USD 159,000.
Understanding this relationship shown on Hanlon Retail Food Store's partial income statement gives you the necessary background to determine the cost of goods sold as presented in this section.
Cost of goods sold: Merchandise inventory, 2010 January 1 $ 24,000 Purchases $167,00 0 Less: Purchase discounts $3,00 0 Purchase returns and allowances 8,000 11,000 Net Purchases $156,00 0 Add: Transportation-in 10,000 Net cost of purchases 166,000 Cost of goods available for sale $190,00 0 Less: Merchandise inventory, 2010 31,000 December 31 Cost of goods sold $159,00 0 Exhibit 36: Determination of cost of goods sold for Hanlon Retail Food Store To determine the cost of goods sold, accountants must have accurate merchandise inventory figures.
Accountants use two basic methods for determining the amount of merchandise inventory— perpetual inventory procedure and periodic inventory procedure.
We mention perpetual inventory procedure only briefly here.
In the next chapter, we emphasize perpetual inventory procedure and further compare it with periodic inventory procedure.
When discussing inventory, we need to clarify whether we are referring to the physical goods on hand or the Merchandise Inventory account, which is the financial representation of the physical goods on hand.
The difference between perpetual and periodic inventory procedures is the frequency with which the Merchandise Inventory account is updated to reflect what is physically on hand.
Under perpetual inventory procedure, the Merchandise Inventory account is continuously updated to reflect items on hand.
For example, your supermarket uses a scanner to ring up your purchases.
When your box of Rice Krispies crosses the scanner, the Merchandise Inventory account shows that one less box of Rice Krispies is on hand.
p. 313 of 433 Under periodic inventory procedure, the Merchandise Inventory account is updated periodically after a physical count has been made.
Usually, the physical count takes place immediately before the preparation of financial statements.
Perpetual inventory procedure Companies use perpetual inventory procedure in a variety of business settings.
Historically, companies that sold merchandise with a high individual unit value, such as automobiles, furniture, and appliances, used perpetual inventory procedure.
Today, computerized cash registers, scanners, and accounting software programs automatically keep track of inflows and outflows of each inventory item.
Computerization makes it economical for many retail stores to use perpetual inventory procedure even for goods of low unit value, such as groceries.
Under perpetual inventory procedure, the Merchandise Inventory account provides close control by showing the cost of the goods that are supposed to be on hand at any particular time.
Companies debit the Merchandise Inventory account for each purchase and credit it for each sale so that the current balance is shown in the account at all times.
Usually, firms also maintain detailed unit records showing the quantities of each type of goods that should be on hand.
Company personnel also take a physical inventory by actually counting the units of inventory on hand.
Then they compare this physical count with the records showing the units that should be on hand.
Chapter 7 describes perpetual inventory procedure in more detail.
Periodic inventory procedure Merchandising companies selling low unit value merchandise (such as nuts and bolts, nails, Christmas cards, or pencils) that have not computerized their inventory systems often find that the extra costs of record-keeping under perpetual inventory procedure more than outweigh the benefits.
These merchandising companies often use periodic inventory procedure.
Under periodic inventory procedure, companies do not use the Merchandise Inventory account to record each purchase and sale of merchandise.
Instead, a company corrects the balance in the Merchandise Inventory account as the result of a physical inventory count at the end of the accounting period.
Also, the company usually does not maintain other records showing the exact number of units that should be on hand.
Although periodic inventory procedure reduces record-keeping, it also reduces control over inventory items.
Companies using periodic inventory procedure make no entries to the Merchandise Inventory account nor do they maintain unit records during the accounting period.
Thus, these companies have no up-to-date balance against which to compare the physical inventory count at the end of the period.
Also, these companies make no attempt to determine the cost of goods sold at the time of each sale.
Instead, they calculate the cost of all the goods sold during the accounting period at the end of the period.
To determine the cost of goods sold, a company must know: p. 314 of 433  Beginning inventory (cost of goods on hand at the beginning of the period).
 Net cost of purchases during the period.
 Ending inventory (cost of unsold goods at the end of the period).
The company would show this information as follows: Beginning inventory $ 34,000 Add: Net cost of purchases during the period 140,000 Cost of goods available for sale during the period $174,000 Deduct: Ending inventory 20,000 Cost of goods sold during the period $154,000 In this schedule, notice that the company began the accounting period with USD 34,000 of merchandise and purchased an additional USD 140,000, making a total of USD 174,000 of goods that could have been sold during the period.
Then, a physical inventory showed that USD 20,000 remained unsold, which implies that USD 154,000 was the cost of goods sold during the period.
Of course, the USD 154,000 is not necessarily the precise amount of goods sold because no actual record was made of the dollar cost of the goods sold.
Periodic inventory procedure basically assumes that everything not on hand at the end of the period has been sold.
This method disregards problems such as theft or breakage because the Merchandise Inventory account contains no up-to-date balance at the end of the accounting period against which to compare the physical count.
Under periodic inventory procedure, a merchandising company uses the Purchases account to record the cost of merchandise bought for resale during the current accounting period.
The Purchases account, which is increased by debits, appears with the income statement accounts in the chart of accounts.
To illustrate entries affecting the Purchases account, assume that Hanlon Retail Food Store made two purchases of merchandise from Smith Wholesale Company.
Hanlon purchased USD 30,000 of merchandise on credit (on account) on May 4, and on May 21 purchased USD 20,000 of merchandise for cash.
The required journal entries for Hanlon are: May 4 Purchases (+A) 30,000 Accounts Payable (+L) 30,000 To record purchases of merchandise on account.
21 Purchases (+A) 20,000 Cash (-A) 20,000 To record purchase of merchandise for cash.
p. 315 of 433 The buyer deducts purchase discounts and purchase returns and allowances from purchases to arrive at net purchases.
The accountant records these items in contra accounts to the Purchases account.
Purchase discounts Often companies purchase merchandise under credit terms that permit them to deduct a stated cash discount if they pay invoices within a specified time.
Assume that credit terms for Hanlon's May 4 purchase are 2/10, n/30.
If Hanlon pays for the merchandise by May 14, the store may take a 2 per cent discount.
Thus, Hanlon must pay only USD 29,400 to settle the USD 30,000 account payable.
The entry to record the payment of the invoice on May 14 is: May 14 Accounts Payable (-L) 30,000 Cash (-A) 29,400 Purchase Discount (+SE) 600 To record payment on account within the discount period.
The buyer records the purchase discount only when the invoice is paid within the discount period and the discount is taken.
The Purchase Discounts account is a contra account to Purchases that reduces the recorded invoice price of the goods purchased to the price actually paid.
Hanlon reports purchase discounts in the income statement as a deduction from purchases.
Companies base purchase discounts on the invoice price of goods.
If an invoice shows purchase returns or allowances, they must be deducted from the invoice price before calculating purchase discounts.
For example, in the previous transaction, the invoice price of goods purchased was USD 30,000.
If Hanlon returned USD 2,000 of the goods, the seller calculates the 2 per cent purchase discount on USD 28,000.
Interest rate implied in cash discounts To decide whether you should take advantage of discounts by using your cash or borrowing, make this simple analysis.
Assume that you must pay USD 10,000 within 30 days or USD 9,800 within 10 days to settle a USD 10,000 invoice with terms of 2/10, n/30.
By advancing payment 20 days from the final due date, you can secure a discount of USD 200.
The interest expense incurred to borrow USD 9,800 at 12 per cent per year for 20 days is USD 65.33, calculated as (USD 9,800 x .12 x 20/360).
You would save USD 134.67 (USD 200 - USD 65.33) by borrowing the money and paying the invoice within the discount period.
In terms of an annual rate of interest, the 2 per cent rate of discount for 20 days is equivalent to a 36 per cent annual rate: (360/20) X 2 per cent.
The formula is: p. 316 of 433 You can convert all cash discount terms to their approximate annual interest rate equivalents by use of this formula.
Thus, a company could afford to pay up to 36 per cent [(360/20) X 2 per cent] on borrowed funds to take advantage of discount terms of 2/10, n/ 30.
The company could pay 18 per cent on terms of 1/10, n/30.
Purchase returns and allowances A purchase return occurs when a buyer returns merchandise to a seller.
When a buyer receives a reduction in the price of goods shipped, a purchase allowance results.
Then, the buyer commonly uses a debit memorandum to notify the seller that the account payable with the seller is being reduced (Accounts Payable is debited).
The buyer may use a copy of a debit memorandum to record the returns or allowances or may wait for confirmation, usually a credit memorandum, from the seller.
Both returns and allowances reduce the buyer's debt to the seller and decrease the cost of the goods purchased.
The buyer may want to know the amount of returns and allowances as the first step in controlling the costs incurred in returning unsatisfactory merchandise or negotiating purchase allowances.
For this reason, buyers record purchase returns and allowances in a separate Purchase Returns and Allowances account.
If Hanlon returned USD 350 of merchandise to Smith Wholesale before paying for the goods, it would make this journal entry: Accounts Payable (-L) 350 Purchase Returns and Allowances (+SE) 350 To record return of damaged merchandise to supplier The entry would have been the same to record a USD 350 allowance.
Only the explanation would change.
If Hanlon had already paid the account, the debit would be to Cash instead of Accounts Payable, since Hanlon would receive a refund of cash.
If the company took a discount at the time it paid the account, only the net amount would be refunded.
For instance, if a 2 per cent discount had been taken, Hanlon's journal entry for the return would be: p. 317 of 433 Cash (+A) 343 Purchase Discounts (-SE) 7 Purchase Returns and Allowances (+SE) 350 To record return of damaged merchandise to supplier and record receipt of cash.
Purchase returns and allowances is a contra account to the Purchases account, and the income statement shows it as a deduction from purchases.
When both purchase discounts and purchase returns and allowances are deducted from purchases, the result is net purchases.
Transportation costs are an important part of cost of goods sold.
To understand how to account for transportation costs, you must know the meaning of the following terms:  FOB shipping point means "free on board at shipping point".
The buyer incurs all transportation costs after the merchandise has been loaded on a railroad car or truck at the point of shipment.
Thus, the buyer is responsible for ultimately paying the freight charges.
 FOB destination means "free on board at destination".
The seller ships the goods to their destination without charge to the buyer.
Thus, the seller is ultimately responsible for paying the freight charges.
 Passage of title is a term that indicates the transfer of the legal ownership of goods.
Title to the goods normally passes from seller to buyer at the FOB point.
Thus, when goods are shipped FOB shipping point, title usually passes to the buyer at the shipping point.
When goods are shipped FOB destination, title usually passes at the destination.
 Freight prepaid means the seller must initially pay the freight at the time of shipment.
 Freight collect indicates the buyer must initially pay the freight bill on the arrival of the goods.
To illustrate the use of these terms, assume that a company ships goods FOB shipping point, freight collect.
Title passes at the shipping point.
The buyer is responsible for paying the USD 100 freight costs and does so.
The seller makes no entry for freight charges; the entry on the buyer's books is: Transportation-In (or Freight-In) (+SE) 100 Cash (-A) 100 To record payment of freight bill on goods purchased.
The Transportation-In account records the inward freight costs of acquiring merchandise.
Transportation-In is an adjunct account in that it is added to net purchases to arrive at net cost of p. 318 of 433 purchases.
An adjunct account is closely related to another account (Purchases, in this instance), and its balance is added to the balance of the related account in the financial statements.
Recall that a contra account is just the opposite of an adjunct account.
Buyers deduct a contra account, such as accumulated depreciation, from the related fixed asset account in the financial statements.
When shipping goods FOB destination, freight prepaid, the seller is responsible for and pays the freight bill.
Because the seller cannot bill a separate freight cost to the buyer, the buyer shows no entry for freight on its books.
The seller, however, has undoubtedly considered the freight cost in setting selling prices.
The following entry is required on the seller's books: Delivery Expense (or Transportation-Out Expense) (-SE) 100 Cash (-A) 100 To record freight cost on goods sold.
When the terms are FOB destination, the seller records the freight costs as delivery expense; this selling expense appears on the income statement with other selling expenses.
FOB terms are especially important at the end of an accounting period.
Goods in transit then belong to either the seller or the buyer, and one of these parties must include these goods in its ending inventory.
Goods shipped FOB destination belong to the seller while in transit, and the seller includes these goods in its ending inventory.
Goods shipped FOB shipping point belong to the buyer while in transit, and the buyer records these goods as a purchase and includes them in its ending inventory.
For example, assume that a seller ships goods on 2009 December 30, and they arrive at their destination on 2010 January 5.
If terms are FOB destination, the seller includes the goods in its 2009 December 31, inventory, and neither seller nor buyer records the exchange transaction until 2010 January 5.
If terms are FOB shipping point, the buyer includes the goods in its 2009 December 31, inventory, and both parties record the exchange transaction as of 2009 December 30.
Sometimes the seller prepays the freight as a convenience to the buyer, even though the buyer is ultimately responsible for it.
The buyer merely reimburses the seller for the freight paid.
For example, assume that Wood Company sold merchandise to Loud Company with terms of FOB shipping point, freight prepaid.
The freight charges were USD 100.
The following entries are necessary on the books of the buyer and the seller: Buyer—Loud Company Seller—Wood Company Transportation-In (-SE) 100 Accounts Receivable (+A) 100 Accounts Payable (+L) Cash (-A) 100 100 p. 319 of 433 Such entries are necessary because Wood initially paid the freight charges when not required to do so.
Therefore, Loud Company must reimburse Wood for the charges.
If the buyer pays freight for the seller (e.g.
FOB destination, freight collect), the buyer merely deducts the freight paid from the amount owed to the seller.
The following entries are necessary on the books of the buyer and the seller: Buyer—Loud Company Seller—Wood Company Accounts Payable (-L) 100 Delivery Expense (-SE) 100 Accounts Receivable (-A) 100 100 Cash (-A) Purchase discounts may be taken only on the purchase price of goods.
Therefore, a buyer who owes the seller for freight charges cannot take a discount on the freight charges owed, even if the buyer makes payment within the discount period.
We summarize our discussion of freight terms and the resulting journal entries to record the freight charges in Exhibit 37.
Merchandise inventory is the cost of goods on hand and available for sale at any given time.
To determine the cost of goods sold in any accounting period, management needs inventory information.
Management must know its cost of goods on hand at the start of the period (beginning inventory), the net cost of purchases during the period, and the cost of goods on hand at the close of the period (ending inventory).
Since the ending inventory of the preceding period is the beginning inventory for the current period, management already knows the cost of the beginning inventory.
Companies record purchases, purchase discounts, purchase returns and allowances, and transportation-in throughout the period.
Therefore, management needs to determine only the cost of the ending inventory at the end of the period in order to calculate cost of goods sold.
Taking a physical inventory Under periodic inventory procedure, company personnel determine ending inventory cost by taking a physical inventory.
Taking a physical inventory consists of counting physical units of each type of merchandise on hand.
To calculate inventory cost, they multiply the number of each kind of merchandise by its unit cost.
Then, they combine the total costs of the various kinds of merchandise to provide the total ending inventory cost.
In taking a physical inventory, company personnel must be careful to count all goods owned, regardless of where they are located, and include them in the inventory.
Shipping point: Detroit- Destination: San Diego Goods travel from shipping point to destination If shipping terms are: FOB shipping point—Buyer incurs the freight FOB destination—Seller incurs the freight p. 320 of 433 charges charge Freight prepaid—Seller initially pays the freight Freight collect—Buyer initially pays the freight charges charges If the freight terms are combined as follows: Party that Party that Ultimately Bears Terms Initially Pays Expense (1) FOB shipping point, freight collect Buyer Buyer (2) FOB destination, freight prepaid Seller Seller (3) FOB shipping point, freight prepaid Seller Buyer (4) FOB destination, freight collect Buyer Seller Exhibit 37: Summary of shipping terms Explanations: FOB shipping point, freight collect – Buyer both incurs and initially pays the freight chargers.
The proper party (buyer) paid the freight.
The buyer debits Transportation-In and credits Cash.
FOB destination, freight prepaid – Seller both incurs and initially pays the freight charges.
The proper party (seller) paid the freight.
The seller debits Delivery Expense and credits Cash.
FOB shipping point, freight prepaid – Buyer incurs the freight chargers, and seller initially pays the freight charges.
Buyer must reimburse seller for freight charges.
The seller debits Accounts Receivable and credits Cash upon paying the freight.
The buyer debits Transportation-In and credits Accounts Payable when informed of the freight charges.
FOB destination, freight collect – Seller incurs freight charges, and buyer initially pays freight charges.
Buyer deducts freight charges from amount owed to seller.
The buyer debits Accounts Payable and credits Cash when paying the freight.
The seller debits Delivery Expense and credits Accounts Receivable when informed of the freight charges.
Thus, companies should include goods shipped to potential customers on approval in their inventories.
Similarly, companies should not record consigned goods (goods delivered to another party who attempts to sell them for a commission) as sold goods.
These goods remain the property of the owner (consignor) until sold by the consignee and must be included in the owner's inventory.
Merchandise in transit is merchandise in the hands of a freight company on the date of a physical inventory.
As stated above, buyers must record merchandise in transit at the end of the accounting period as a purchase if the goods were shipped FOB shipping point and they have received title to the merchandise.
In general, the goods belong to the party who ultimately bears the transportation charges.
When accounting personnel know the beginning and ending inventories and the various items making up the net cost of purchases, they can determine the cost of goods sold.
To illustrate, assume the following account balances for Hanlon Retail Food Store as of 2010 December 31: Merchandise Inventory, 2010 January 1 $ 24,000 Dr.
Purchases 167,000 Dr. Purchase Discounts 3,000 Cr.
Purchase Returns and Allowances 8,000 Cr.
Transportation-In 10,000 Dr. By taking a physical inventory, Hanlon determined the 2010 December 31, merchandise inventory to be USD 31,000.
Hanlon then calculated its cost of goods sold as shown in Exhibit 38.
This computation appears in a section of the income statement directly below the calculation of net sales.
p. 321 of 433 Cost of goods sold: Merchandise inventory, 2010 January 1 $ 24,000 Purchases $167,000 Less: Purchase discounts $3,000 Purchase returns and allowances 8,000 11,000 Net Purchases $156,000 Add: Transportation-in 10,000 Net cost of purchases 166,000 Cost of goods available for sale $190,000 Less: Merchandise inventory, 2010 December 31 31,000 Cost of goods sold $159,000 This illustration is the same as Exhibit 36, repeated here for your convenience.
Exhibit 38: Determination of cost of goods sold for Hanlon Retain Food Store* In Exhibit 38, Hanlon's beginning inventory (USD 24,000) plus net cost of purchases (USD 166,000) is equal to cost of goods available for sale (USD 190,000).
The firm deducts the ending inventory cost (USD 31,000) from cost of goods available for sale to arrive at cost of goods sold (USD 159,000).
Another way of looking at this relationship is the following diagram: Beginning inventory and net cost of purchases combine to form cost of goods available for sale.
Hanlon divides the cost of goods available for sale into ending inventory (which is the cost of goods not sold) and cost of goods sold.
To continue the calculation appearing in Exhibit 38, net cost of purchases (USD 166,000) is equal to purchases (USD 167,000), less purchase discounts (USD 3,000) and purchase returns and allowances (USD 8,000), plus transportation-in (USD 10,000).
p. 322 of 433 As shown in Exhibit 38, ending inventory cost (merchandise inventory) appears in the income statement as a deduction from cost of goods available for sale to compute cost of goods sold.
Ending inventory cost (merchandise inventory) is also a current asset in the end-of-period balance sheet.
Companies use periodic inventory procedure because of its simplicity and relatively low cost.
However, periodic inventory procedure provides little control over inventory.
Firms assume any items not included in the physical count of inventory at the end of the period have been sold.
Thus, they mistakenly assume items that have been stolen have been sold and include their cost in cost of goods sold.
To illustrate, suppose that the cost of goods available for sale was USD 200,000 and ending inventory was USD 60,000.
These figures suggest that the cost of goods sold was USD 140,000.
Now suppose that USD 2,000 of goods were actually shoplifted during the year.
If such goods had not been stolen, the ending inventory would have been USD 62,000 and the cost of goods sold only USD 138,000.
Thus, the USD 140,000 cost of goods sold calculated under periodic inventory procedure includes both the cost of the merchandise delivered to customers and the cost of merchandise stolen.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology Many companies are building private networks to link their employees, customers, and suppliers together.
These networks within the Internet are referred to as companies' intranets.
The Internet can be likened to the entire universe, while an intranet can be likened to a solar system within the universe.
A company's intranet is built to be secure from outside users.
For instance, these networks are designed to be secure against "hackers" and other unauthorized persons.
The intranet software typically encrypts data sent over the Internet to safeguard financial transactions.
7.6 Classified income statement In preceding chapters, we illustrated the unclassified (or single-step) income statement.
An unclassified income statement has only two categories—revenues and expenses.
In contrast, a classified income statement divides both revenues and expenses into operating and nonoperating items.
The statement also separates operating expenses into selling and administrative expenses.
A classified income statement is also called a multiple-step income statement.
In Exhibit 39, we present a classified income statement for Hanlon Retail Food Store.
This statement uses the previously presented data on sales (Exhibit 35) and cost of goods sold (Exhibit 38), p. 323 of 433 together with additional assumed data on operating expenses and other expenses and revenues.
Note in Exhibit 39 that a classified income statement has the following four major sections:  Operating revenues.
 Cost of goods sold.
 Operating expenses.
 Nonoperating revenues and expenses (other revenues and other expenses).
The classified income statement shows important relationships that help in analyzing how well the company is performing.
For example, by deducting cost of goods sold from operating revenues, you can determine by what amount sales revenues exceed the cost of items being sold.
If this margin, called gross margin, is lower than desired, a company may need to increase its selling prices and/or decrease its cost of goods sold.
The classified income statement subdivides operating expenses into selling and administrative expenses.
Thus, statement users can see how much expense is incurred in selling the product and how much in administering the business.
Statement users can also make comparisons with other years' data for the same business and with other businesses.
Nonoperating revenues and expenses appear at the bottom of the income statement because they are less significant in assessing the profitability of the business.
An accounting perspective: Business insight Management chooses whether to use a classified or unclassified income statement to present a company's financial data.
This choice may be based either on how their competitors present their data or on the costs associated with assembling the data.

The terms in some of these headings are already familiar to you.
Although future illustrations of classified income statements may vary somewhat in form, we retain the basic organization.
 Operating revenues are the revenues generated by the major activities of the business— usually the sale of products or services or both.
p. 325 of 433  Cost of goods sold is the major expense in merchandising companies.
Note the cost of goods sold section of the classified income statement in Exhibit 39.
This chapter has already discussed the items used in calculating cost of goods sold.
Merchandisers usually highlight the amount by which sales revenues exceed the cost of goods sold in the top part of the income statement.
The excess of net sales over cost of goods sold is the gross margin or gross profit.
To express gross margin as a percentage rate, we divide gross margin by net sales.
In Exhibit 39, the gross margin rate is approximately 39.3 per cent (USD 103,000/USD 262,000).
The gross margin rate indicates that out of each sales dollar, approximately 39 cents is available to cover other expenses and produce income.
Business owners watch the gross margin rate closely since a small percentage fluctuation can cause a large dollar change in net income.
Also, a downward trend in the gross margin rate may indicate a problem, such as theft of merchandise.
For instance, one Southeastern sporting goods company, SportsTown, Inc., suffered significant gross margin deterioration from increased shoplifting and employee theft.
 Operating expenses for a merchandising company are those expenses, other than cost of goods sold, incurred in the normal business functions of a company.
Usually, operating expenses are either selling expenses or administrative expenses.
Selling expenses are expenses a company incurs in selling and marketing efforts.
Examples include salaries and commissions of salespersons, expenses for salespersons' travel, delivery, advertising, rent (or depreciation, if owned) and utilities on a sales building, sales supplies used, and depreciation on delivery trucks used in sales.
Administrative expenses are expenses a company incurs in the overall management of a business.
Examples include administrative salaries, rent (or depreciation, if owned) and utilities on an administrative building, insurance expense, administrative supplies used, and depreciation on office equipment.
Certain operating expenses may be shared by the selling and administrative functions.
For example, a company might incur rent, taxes, and insurance on a building for both sales and administrative purposes.
Expenses covering both the selling and administrative functions must be analyzed and prorated between the two functions on the income statement.
For instance, if USD 1,000 of depreciation expense relates 60 per cent to selling and 40 per cent to administrative based on the square footage or number of employees, the income statement would show USD 600 as a selling expense and USD 400 as an administrative expense.
 Nonoperating revenues (other revenues) and nonoperating expenses (other expenses) are revenues and expenses not related to the sale of products or services regularly offered for sale by a business.
An example of a nonoperating revenue is interest that a business earns on notes p. 326 of 433 receivable.
An example of a nonoperating expense is interest incurred on money borrowed by the company.
To summarize the more important relationships in the income statement of a merchandising firm in equation form:  Net sales = Gross sales - (Sales discounts + Sales returns and allowances).
 Net purchases = Purchases - (Purchase discounts + Purchase returns and allowances).
 Net cost of purchases = Net purchases + Transportation-in.
 Cost of goods sold = Beginning inventory + Net cost of purchases - Ending inventory.
 Gross margin = Net sales - Cost of goods sold.
 Income from operations = Gross margin - Operating (selling and administrative) expenses.
 Net income = Income from operations + Nonoperating revenues - Nonoperating expenses.
Each of these relationships is important because of the way it relates to an overall measure of business profitability.
For example, a company may produce a high gross margin on sales.
However, because of large sales commissions and delivery expenses, the owner may realize only a very small percentage of the gross margin as profit.
The classifications in the income statement allow a user to focus on the whole picture as well as on how net income was derived (statement relationships).
An ethical perspective: World auto parts corporation John Bentley is the chief financial officer for World Auto Parts Corporation.
The company buys approximately USD 500 million of auto parts each year from small suppliers all over the world and resells them to auto repair shops in the United States.
Most of the suppliers have cash discount terms of 2/10, n/30.
John has instructed his personnel to pay invoices on the 30th day after the invoice date but to take the 2 per cent discount even though they are not entitled to do so.
Whenever a supplier complains, John instructs his purchasing agent to find another supplier who will go along with this practice.
When some of his own employees questioned the practice, John responded as follows: This practice really does no harm.
These small suppliers are much better off to go along and have our business than to not go along and lose it.
For most of them, we are their largest customer.
Besides, if they are willing to sell to others at a 2 per cent discount, why should they not be willing to sell to us at that same discount even though we pay a little later?
The benefit to our company is very significant.
Last year p. 327 of 433 our profits were USD 100 million.
A total of USD 10 million of the profits was attributable to this practice.
Do you really want me to change this practice and give up USD 10 million of our profits?
7.7 Analyzing and using the financial results—Gross margin percentage As discussed earlier, you can calculate the gross margin percentage by using the following formula: Grossmargin Grossmarginpercentage= Netsales To demonstrate the use of this ratio, consider the following information from the 2000 Annual Report of Abercrombie & Fitch.
($ millions) 2000 1999 1998 Revenues $ 1,238.6 $ 1,030.9 $ 805.2 Gross profit 509.4 450.4 331.4 Gross profit (margin) percentage $ 509.5/$1,238.6 = 41.13% $450.4/$1,030.9 = 43.69% $331.4/$805.2 = 41.16% Abercrombie's gross margin held at a rather high 41-43 per cent over those three years.
You should now understand the distinction between accounting for a service company and a merchandising company.
The next chapter continues the discussion of merchandise inventory carried by merchandising companies.
7.8 Understanding the learning objectives  In a sales transaction, the seller transfers the legal ownership (title) of the goods to the buyer.
 An invoice is a document, prepared by the seller of merchandise and sent to the buyer, that contains the details of a sale, such as the number of units sold, unit price, total price, terms of sale, and manner of shipment.
 Usually sales are for cash or on account.
When a sale is for cash, the debit is to Cash and the credit is to Sales.
When a sale is on account, the debit is to Accounts Receivable and the credit is to Sales.
 When companies offer trade discounts, the gross selling price (gross invoice price) at which the sale is recorded is equal to the list price minus any trade discounts.
p. 328 of 433  Two common deductions from gross sales are (1) sales discounts and (2) sales returns and allowances.
These deductions are recorded in contra revenue accounts to the Sales account.
Both the Sales Discounts account and the Sales Returns and Allowances account normally have debit balances.
Net sales = Sales - (Sales discounts + Sales returns and allowances).
 Sales discounts arise when the seller offers the buyer a cash discount of 1 per cent to 3 per cent to induce early payment of an amount due.
 Sales returns result from merchandise being returned by a buyer because the goods are considered unsatisfactory or have been damaged.
A sales allowance is a deduction from the original invoiced sales price granted to a customer when the customer keeps the merchandise but is dissatisfied.
 Costof goodssold=Beginninginventory+Netcostof purchases−Endinginventory.
Netcostof purchases=Purchases−(Purchasediscounts+Purchasereturns)+Transportation−¿  Two methods of accounting for inventory are perpetual inventory procedure and periodic inventory procedure.
Under perpetual inventory procedure, the inventory account is continuously updated during the accounting period.
Under periodic inventory procedure, the inventory account is updated only periodically—after a physical count has been made.
 Purchases of merchandise are recorded by debiting Purchases and crediting Cash (for cash purchases) or crediting Accounts Payable (for purchases on account).
 Two common deductions from purchases are (1) purchase discounts and (2) purchase returns and allowances.
In the general ledger, both of these items normally carry credit balances.
From the buyer's side of the transactions, cash discounts are purchase discounts, and merchandise returns and allowances are purchase returns and allowances.
 FOB shipping point means free on board at shipping point—the buyer incurs the freight.
 FOB destination means free on board at destination—the seller incurs the freight.
 Passage of title is a term indicating the transfer of the legal ownership of goods.
 Freight prepaid is when the seller must initially pay the freight at the time of shipment.
 Freight collect is when the buyer must initially pay the freight on the arrival of the goods.
 Expansion and application of the relationship introduced in Learning objective 2.
Beginning inventory + Net cost of purchases = Cost of goods available for sale.
Cost of goods available for sale - Ending inventory = Cost of goods sold.
 A classified income statement has four major sections—operating revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and nonoperating revenues and expenses.
p. 329 of 433  Operating revenues are the revenues generated by the major activities of the business—usually the sale of products or services or both.
 Cost of goods sold is the major expense in merchandising companies.
 Operating expenses for a merchandising company are those expenses other than cost of goods sold incurred in the normal business functions of a company.
Usually, operating expenses are classified as either selling expenses or administrative expenses.
 Nonoperating revenues and expenses are revenues and expenses not related to the sale of products or services regularly offered for sale by a business.
Grossmargin  Grossmarginpercentage= Netsales  The gross margin rate indicates the amount of sales dollars available to cover expenses and produce income.
 Except for the merchandise-related accounts, the work sheet for a merchandising company is the same as for a service company.
 Any revenue accounts and contra purchases accounts in the Adjusted Trial Balance credit column of the work sheet are carried to the Income Statement credit column.
 Beginning inventory, contra revenue accounts.
Purchases, Transportation-In, and expense accounts in the Adjusted Trial Balance debit column are carried to the Income Statement debit column.
 Ending merchandise inventory is entered in the Income Statement credit column and in the Balance Sheet debit column.
 Closing entries may be prepared directly from the work sheet.
The first journal entry debits all items appearing in the Income Statement credit column and credits Income Summary.
The second entry credits all items appearing in the Income Statement debit column and debits Income Summary.
The third entry debits Income Summary and credits the Retained Earnings account (assuming positive net income).
The fourth entry debits the Retained Earnings account and credits the Dividends account.
7.9 Appendix: The work sheet for a merchandising company Exhibit 40 shows a work sheet for a merchandising company.
Lyons Company is a small sporting goods firm.
The illustration for Lyons Company focuses on merchandise-related accounts.
Thus, we do not show the fixed assets (land, building, and equipment).
Except for the merchandise-related accounts, the work sheet for a merchandising company is the same as for a service company.
Recall p. 330 of 433 that use of a work sheet assists in the preparation of the adjusting and closing entries.
The work sheet also contains all the information needed for the preparation of the financial statements.
To further simplify this illustration, assume Lyons needs no adjusting entries at month-end.
The trial balance is from the ledger accounts at 2010 December 31.
The USD 7,000 merchandise inventory in the trial balance is the beginning inventory.
The sales and sales-related accounts and the purchases and purchases-related accounts summarize the merchandising activity for December 2010.
Lyons carries any revenue accounts (Sales) and contra purchases accounts (Purchase Discounts, Purchase Returns and Allowances) in the Adjusted Trial Balance credit columns of the work sheet to the Income Statement credit column.
It carries beginning inventory, contra revenue accounts (Sales Discounts, Sales Returns and Allowances), Purchases, Transportation-In, and expense accounts (Selling Expenses, Administrative Expenses) in the Adjusted Trial Balance debit column to the Income Statement debit column.
Assume that ending inventory is USD 8,000.
Lyons enters this amount in the Income Statement credit column because it is deducted from cost of goods available for sale (beginning inventory plus net cost of purchases) in determining cost of goods sold.
It also enters the ending inventory in the Balance Sheet debit column to establish the proper balance in the Merchandise Inventory account.
The beginning and ending inventories are on the Income Statement because Lyons uses both to calculate cost of goods sold in the income statement.
Net income of USD 5,843 for the period balances the Income Statement columns.
The firm carries the net income to the Statement of Retained Earnings credit column.
Retained earnings of USD 18,843 balances the Statement of Retained Earnings columns.
Lyons Company carries the retained earnings to the Balance Sheet credit column.
Lyons carries all other asset account balances (Cash, Accounts Receivable, and ending Merchandise Inventory) to the Balance Sheet debit column.
It also carries the liability (Accounts Payable) and Capital Stock account balances to the Balance Sheet credit column.
The balance sheet columns total to USD 29,543.
Once the work sheet has been completed, Lyons prepares the financial statements.
After entering any adjusting and closing entries in the journal, the firm posts them to the ledger.
This process clears the records for the next accounting period.
Finally, it prepares a post-closing trial balance.
Income statement Exhibit 41 shows the income statement Lyons prepared from its work sheet in Exhibit 40.
The focus in this income statement is on determining the cost of goods sold.
Statement of retained earnings The statement of retained earnings, as you recall, is a financial statement that summarizes the transactions affecting the Retained Earnings account balance.
In p. 331 of 433 Exhibit 42, the statement of retained earnings shows an increase in equity resulting from net income and a decrease in equity resulting from dividends.

Note the USD 8,000 ending inventory is a current asset.
The Retained Earnings account balance comes from the statement of retained earnings.
Recall from Chapter 4 that the closing process normally takes place after the accountant has prepared the financial statements for the period.
The closing process closes revenue and expense accounts by transferring their balances to a clearing account called Income Summary and then to Retained Earnings.
The closing process reduces the revenue and expense account balances to zero so that information for each accounting period may be accumulated separately.
Lyons's accountant would prepare closing entries directly from the work sheet in Exhibit 40 using the same procedure presented in Chapter 4.
The closing entries for Lyons Company follow.
The first journal entry debits all items appearing in the Income Statement credit column of the work sheet and credits Income Summary for the total of the column, USD 22,782.
2010 Dec. 31 Merchandise Inventory (ending) 8,000 Sales 14,600 Purchase Discounts 82 • 1st entry Purchase Returns and Allowances 100 Income Summary 22,782 To close accounts with a credit balance in the Income Statement columns and to establish ending merchandise inventory.
The second entry credits all items appearing in the Income Statement debit column and debits Income Summary for the total of that column, USD 16,939. p. 334 of 433 2010 Dec. 31 Income Summary 16,939 7,000 Merchandise Inventory (beginning) 44 Sales Discounts 20 Sales Returns and Allowance • 2nd entry Purchases 6,000 Transportation-In 75 Miscellaneous Selling Expenses 2,650 Miscellaneous Administrative Expenses 1,150 To close accounts with a debit balance in the Income Statement columns.
The third entry closes the credit balance in the Income Summary account of USD 5,843 to the Retained Earnings account.
2010 5,843 Dec. 31 Income Summary 5,843 Retained Earnings To close the Income Summary account to the Retained Earnings account.
The fourth entry closes the Dividends account balance of $2,000 to the Retained Earnings account by debiting Retained Earnings and crediting Dividends.
2010 2,000 Dec. 31 Retained Earnings 2,000 Dividends To close the Dividends account to the Retained Earnings account.
Note how the first three closing entries tie into the totals in the Income Statement columns of the work sheet in Exhibit 40.
In the first closing journal entry, the credit to the Income Summary account is equal to the total of the Income Statement credit column.
In the second entry, the debit to the Income Summary account is equal to the subtotal of the Income Statement debit column.
The difference between the totals of the two Income Statement columns (USD 5,843) represents net income and is the amount of the third closing entry.

8.2 Choosing an accounting career Chapter 7 discusses how companies have a choice in inventory cost methods between specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, and weighted-average.
Similarly, one of the greatest benefits of obtaining an accounting degree is the broad range of career choices available.
There are over 40 different types of accounting jobs available in public accounting, private industry, and governmental accounting.
For example, check out the list of accounting jobs at: http://www.uncwil.edu/stuaff/career/Majors/accounting.htm#related careertitles.
One of the primary reasons many students go into accounting is successful job placement.
Accounting majors have been better able to find positions than majors in any of the other business options, with the possible exception of management information systems (MIS).
Even the relative demand for MIS majors has diminished recently, while the demand for accounting majors remains strong.
We are currently experiencing a shortage of accounting majors across the nation.
Another important factor to keep in mind regarding job placement is where you would like to be three to five years from now.
Accounting offers an excellent foundation with opportunities for advancement, whereby many accounting graduates make double their entry-level salary in only five years.
Many students pursue an accounting degree because it does not restrict their career opportunities as much as having a different business degree.
For example, with an accounting degree, a student can p. 358 of 433 apply for positions in management, marketing, and finance, as well as accounting.
In fact, many recruiters in business favor accounting graduates because they recognize an accounting degree as a more difficult business degree to obtain.
However, management, marketing, and finance students cannot apply for accounting positions because they lack necessary accounting coursework.
In fact, with some additional courses in systems, an accounting major is well equipped to pursue a career in any business field including information systems.
Have you ever taken advantage of a pre-inventory sale at your favorite retail store?
Many stores offer bargain prices to reduce the merchandise on hand and to minimize the time and expense of taking the inventory.
A smaller inventory also enhances the probability of taking an accurate inventory since the store has less merchandise to count.
From Chapter 6 you know that companies use inventory amounts to determine the cost of goods sold; this major expense affects a merchandising company's net income.
In this chapter, you learn how important inventories are in preparing an accurate income statement, statement of retained earnings, and balance sheet.
This chapter discusses merchandise inventory carried by merchandising retailers and wholesalers.
Merchandise inventory is the quantity of goods held by a merchandising company for resale to customers.
Merchandising companies determine the quantity of inventory items by a physical count.
The merchandise inventory figure used by accountants depends on the quantity of inventory items and the cost of the items.
This chapter discusses four accepted methods of costing the items: (1) specific identification; (2) first-in, first-out (FIFO); (3) last-in, first-out (LIFO); and (4) weighted- average.
Each method has advantages and disadvantages.
This chapter stresses the importance of having accurate inventory figures and the serious consequences of using inaccurate inventory figures.
When you finish this chapter, you should understand how taking inventory connects with the cost of goods sold figure on the store's income statement, the retained earnings amount on the statement of retained earnings, and both the inventory figure and the retained earnings amount on the store's balance sheet.
8.3 Inventories and cost of goods sold Inventory is often the largest and most important asset owned by a merchandising business.
The inventory of some companies, like car dealerships or jewelry stores, may cost several times more than any other asset the company owns.
As an asset, the inventory figure has a direct impact on reporting the solvency of the company in the balance sheet.
As a factor in determining cost of goods sold, the inventory figure has a direct impact on the profitability of the company's operations as reported in the income statement.
Thus, the importance of the inventory figure should not be underestimated.
p. 359 of 433  8.4 Importance of proper inventory valuation A merchandising company can prepare accurate income statements, statements of retained earnings, and balance sheets only if its inventory is correctly valued.
On the income statement, a company using periodic inventory procedure takes a physical inventory to determine the cost of goods sold.
Since the cost of goods sold figure affects the company's net income, it also affects the balance of retained earnings on the statement of retained earnings.
On the balance sheet, incorrect inventory amounts affect both the reported ending inventory and retained earnings.
Inventories appear on the balance sheet under the heading "Current Assets", which reports current assets in a descending order of liquidity.
Because inventories are consumed or converted into cash within a year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer, inventories usually follow cash and receivables on the balance sheet.
Recall that under periodic inventory procedure we determine the cost of goods sold figure by adding the beginning inventory to the net cost of purchases and deducting the ending inventory.
In each accounting period, the appropriate expenses must be matched with the revenues of that period to determine the net income.
Applied to inventory, matching involves determining (1) how much of the cost of goods available for sale during the period should be deducted from current revenues and (2) how much should be allocated to goods on hand and thus carried forward as an asset (merchandise inventory) in the balance sheet to be matched against future revenues.
Because we determine the cost of goods sold by deducting the ending inventory from the cost of goods available for sale, a highly significant relationship exists: Net income for an accounting period depends directly on the valuation of ending inventory.
This relationship involves three items: First, a merchandising company must be sure that it has properly valued its ending inventory.
If the ending inventory is overstated, cost of goods sold is understated, resulting in an overstatement of gross margin and net income.
Also, overstatement of ending inventory causes current assets, total assets, and retained earnings to be overstated.
Thus, any change in the calculation of ending inventory is reflected, dollar for dollar (ignoring any income tax effects), in net income, current assets, total assets, and retained earnings.
Second, when a company misstates its ending inventory in the current year, the company carries forward that misstatement into the next year.
This misstatement occurs because the ending inventory amount of the current year is the beginning inventory amount for the next year.
Third, an error in one period's ending inventory automatically causes an error in net income in the opposite direction in the next period.
After two years, however, the error washes out, and assets and retained earnings are properly stated.
p. 360 of 433 Exhibit 44 and Exhibit 45 prove that net income for an accounting period depends directly on the valuation of the inventory.
Allen Company's income statements and the statements of retained earnings for years 2009 and 2010 show this relationship.
ALLEN COMPANY For Year Ended 2009 December 31 Ending Inventory Ending Inventory Overstated Income Statement Correctly Stated By $5,000 Sales $400,000 $400,000 Cost of goods available for sale $300,000 $300,000 Ending inventory 35,000 40,000 Cost of goods sold 265,000 260,000 Gross margin $135,000 $140,000 Other expenses $85,000 85,000 Net income $ 50,000 $55,000 Statement of Retained Earnings Beginning retained earnings $120,000 $120,000 Net income 50,000 55,000 Ending retained earnings $170,000 $175,000 Exhibit 44: Effects of an overstated ending inventory ALLEN COMPANY For Year Ended 2010 December 31 Beginning Beginning Inventory Inventory Overstated Income Statement Correctly Stated By $5,000 Sales $425,000 $425,000 Beginning inventory $ 35,000 $40,000 Purchases 290,000 290,000 Cost of goods available for sale $325,000 $330,000 Ending inventory 45,000 45,000 Cost of goods sold 280,000 285,000 Gross margin $145,000 $140,000 Other expenses 53,500 53,500 Net income $ 91,500 $ 86,500 Statement of Retained Earnings Beginning retained earnings $170,000 $175,000 Net income 91,500 86,500 Ending retained earnings $261,500 $261,500 Exhibit 45: Effects of an overstated beginning inventory In Exhibit 44 the correctly stated ending inventory for the year 2009 is USD 35,000.
As a result, Allen has a gross margin of USD 135,000 and net income of USD 50,000.
The statement of retained earnings shows a beginning retained earnings of USD 120,000 and an ending retained earnings of USD 170,000.
When the ending inventory is overstated by USD 5,000, as shown on the right in Exhibit 44, the gross margin is USD 140,000, and net income is USD 55,000.
The statement of retained earnings p. 361 of 433 then has an ending retained earnings of USD 175,000.
The ending inventory overstatement of USD 5,000 causes a USD 5,000 overstatement of net income and a USD 5,000 overstatement of retained earnings.
The balance sheet would show both an overstated inventory and an overstated retained earnings.
Due to the error in ending inventory, both the stockholders and creditors may overestimate the profitability of the business.
Exhibit 45 is a continuation of Exhibit 44 and contains Allen's operating results for the year ended 2010 December 31.
Note that the ending inventory in Exhibit 44 now becomes the beginning inventory of Exhibit 45.
However, Allen's inventory at 2010 December 31, is now an accurate inventory of USD 45,000.
As a result, the gross margin in the income statement with the beginning inventory correctly stated is USD 145,000, and Allen Company has net income of USD 91,500 and an ending retained earnings of USD 261,500.
In the income statement columns at the right, in which the beginning inventory is overstated by USD 5,000, the gross margin is USD 140,000 and net income is USD 86,500, with the ending retained earnings also at USD 261,500.
Thus, in contrast to an overstated ending inventory, resulting in an overstatement of net income, an overstated beginning inventory results in an understatement of net income.
If the beginning inventory is overstated, then cost of goods available for sale and cost of goods sold also are overstated.
Consequently, gross margin and net income are understated.
Note, however, that when net income in the second year is closed to retained earnings, the retained earnings account is stated at its proper amount.
The overstatement of net income in the first year is offset by the understatement of net income in the second year.
For the two years combined the net income is correct.
At the end of the second year, the balance sheet contains the correct amounts for both inventory and retained earnings.
Exhibit 46 summarizes the effects of errors of inventory valuation: Ending Inventory Beginning Inventory Understated Overstated Understated Overstated Cost of good sold Overstated Understated Understated Overstated Net income Understated Overstated Overstated Understated Exhibit 46: Inventory errors 8.5 Determining inventory cost To place the proper valuation on inventory, a business must answer the question: Which costs should be included in inventory cost?
Then, when the business purchases identical goods at different p. 362 of 433 costs, it must answer the question: Which cost should be assigned to the items sold?
In this section, you learn how accountants answer these questions.
The costs included in inventory depend on two variables: quantity and price.
To arrive at a current inventory figure, companies must begin with an accurate physical count of inventory items.
They multiply the quantity of inventory by the unit cost to compute the cost of ending inventory.
This section discusses the taking of a physical inventory and the methods of costing the physical inventory under both perpetual and periodic inventory procedures.
The remainder of the chapter discusses departures from the cost basis of inventory measurement.
As briefly described in Chapter 6, to take a physical inventory, a company must count, weigh, measure, or estimate the physical quantities of the goods on hand.
For example, a clothing store may count its suits; a hardware store may weigh bolts, washers, and nails; a gasoline company may measure gasoline in storage tanks; and a lumberyard may estimate quantities of lumber, coal, or other bulky materials.
Throughout the taking of a physical inventory, the goal should be accuracy.
Taking a physical inventory may disrupt the normal operations of a business.
Thus, the count should be administered as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
The actual taking of the inventory is not an accounting function; however, accountants often plan and coordinate the count.
Proper forms are required to record accurate counts and determine totals.
Identification names or symbols must be chosen, and those persons who count, weigh, or measure the inventory items must know these symbols.

281 Date Description Location Quantity Counted Counted by Checked by p. 363 of 433 Exhibit 47: Inventory tag Taking a physical inventory often involves using inventory tags, such as that in Exhibit 47.
These tags are consecutively numbered for control purposes.
A tag usually consists of a stub and a detachable duplicate section.
The duplicate section facilitates checking discrepancies.
The format of the tags can vary.
However, the tag usually provides space for (1) a detailed description and identification of inventory items by product, class, and model; (2) location of items; (3) quantity of items on hand; and (4) initials of the counters and checkers.
The descriptive information and count may be entered on one copy of the tag by one team of counters.
Another team of counters may record its count on the duplicate copy of the tag.
Discrepancies between counts of the same items by different teams are reconciled by supervisors, and the correct counts are assembled on intermediate inventory sheets.
Only when the inventory counts are completed and checked does management send the final sheets to the accounting department for pricing and extensions (quantity X price).
The tabulated result is the dollar amount of the physical inventory.
Later in the chapter we explain the different methods accountants use to cost inventory.
Usually, inventory cost includes all the necessary outlays to obtain the goods, get the goods ready to sell, and have the goods in the desired location for sale to customers.
Thus, inventory cost includes:  Seller's invoice price less any purchase discount.
 Cost of the buyer's insurance to cover the goods while in transit.
 Transportation charges when borne by the buyer.
 Handling costs, such as the cost of pressing clothes wrinkled during shipment.
In theory, the cost of each unit of inventory should include its net invoice price plus its share of other costs incurred in shipment.
The 1986 Tax Reform Act requires companies to assign these costs to inventory for tax purposes.
For accounting purposes, these cost assignments are recommended but not required.
Practical difficulties arise in allocating some of these costs to inventory items.
Assume, for example, that the freight bill on a shipment of clothes does not separate out the cost of shipping one shirt.
Also, assume that the company wants to include the freight cost as part of the inventory cost of the shirt.
Then, the freight cost would have to be allocated to each unit because it cannot be measured directly.
In practice, allocations of freight, insurance, and handling costs to the individual units of inventory purchased are often not worth the additional cost.
Consequently, in the past many companies have not assigned the costs of freight, insurance, and handling to inventory.
Instead, they have expensed these costs as incurred.
When companies omit these costs from both beginning and ending inventories, they p. 364 of 433 minimize the effect of expensing these costs on net income.
The required allocation for tax purposes has probably resulted in many companies using the same inventory amounts in their financial statements.
Even if a company derives a cost for each unit in inventory, the inventory valuation problem is not solved.
Management must consider two other aspects of the problem:  If goods were purchased at varying unit costs, how should the cost of goods available for sale be allocated between the units sold and those that remain in inventory?
For example, assume Hi-Fi Buys, Inc., purchased two identical DVD players for resale.
One cost USD 250 and the other, USD 200.
If one was sold during the period, should Hi-Fi Buys assign it a cost of USD 250, USD 200, or an average cost of USD 225?
 Does the fact that current replacement costs are less than the costs of some units in inventory have any bearing on the amount at which inventory should be carried?
Using the same example, if Hi-Fi Buys can currently buy all DVD players for USD 200, is it reasonable to carry some units in inventory at USD 250 rather than USD 200?
We answer these questions in the next section.
Generally companies should account for inventories at historical cost; that is, the cost at which the items were purchased.
However, this rule does not indicate how to assign costs to ending inventory and to cost of goods sold when the goods have been purchased at different unit costs.
For example, suppose a retailer has three shirts on hand.
One costs USD 20; another, USD 22; and a third, USD 24.
If the retailer sells two shirts for USD 30 each, what is the cost of the two shirts sold?
Accountants developed these four inventory costing methods to solve costing problems: (1) specific identification; (2) first-in, first-out (FIFO); (3) last-in, first-out (LIFO); and (4) weighted-average.
Before explaining the inventory costing methods, we briefly introduce perpetual inventory procedure and compare periodic and perpetual inventory procedures.
In Chapter 6, the emphasis was on periodic inventory procedure.
Under periodic inventory procedure, firms debit the Purchases account when goods are acquired; they use other accounts, such as Purchase Discounts, Purchase Returns and Allowances, and Transportation-In, for purchase-related transactions.
Companies determine cost of goods sold only at the end of the period as the difference between cost of goods available for sale and ending inventory.
They keep no records of the cost of items as they are sold, and have no information on possible inventory shortages.
They assume any goods not in ending inventory have been sold.

Under perpetual inventory procedure, companies have no Purchases and purchase-related accounts.
Instead, they make all entries involving merchandise purchased for sale to customers directly in the Merchandise Inventory account.
Thus, they debit or credit Merchandise Inventory in place of debiting or crediting Purchases, Purchase Discounts, Purchase Returns and Allowances, and Transportation-In.
At the time of each sale, firms make two entries: the first debits Accounts Receivable or Cash and credits Sales at the retail selling price.
The second debits Cost of Goods Sold and credits Merchandise Inventory at cost.
Therefore, at the end of the period the Merchandise Inventory account shows the cost of the inventory that should be on hand.
Comparison of this amount with the cost obtained by taking and pricing a physical inventory may reveal inventory shortages.
Thus, perpetual inventory procedure is an important element in providing internal control over goods in inventory.
Perpetual inventory records Even though companies could apply perpetual inventory procedure manually, tracking units and dollars in and out of inventory is much easier using a computer.
Both manual and computer processing maintain a record for each item in inventory.
Look at Exhibit 48, an inventory record for Entertainment World, a firm that sells many different brands of television sets.
This inventory record shows the information on one particular brand and model of television set carried in inventory.
Other information on the record includes (1) the maximum and p. 366 of 433 minimum number of units the company wishes to stock at any time, (2) when and how many units were acquired and at what cost, and (3) when and how many units were sold and what cost was assigned to cost of goods sold.
The number of units on hand and their cost are readily available also.
Entertainment World assumes that the first units acquired are the first units sold.
This assumption is the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory costing; we will discuss it later.
An accounting perspective: Uses of technology Keeping track of inventories under a perpetual inventory system is much more cost- effective with computers.
Under a manual system, the cost of an up-to-date inventory for stores with high turnover would outweigh the benefit.
Most retail stores use scanning devices to read the inventory numbers of products purchased at the cash register.
These bar codes not only provide accurate sales prices but also record the merchandise sold so that the total cost of the store's inventory is up to date.
The following comparison reveals several differences between accounting for inventories under periodic and perpetual procedures.
We explain these differences by using data from Exhibit 48 and making additional assumptions.
Later, we discuss other journal entries under perpetual inventory procedure.
These entries record the purchase on July 5 under each of the methods: Periodic Procedure Perpetual Procedure Purchases (+A) 3,000 Merchandise Inventory (+A) 3,000 Accounts Payable (+L) 3,000 Accounts Payable (+L) 3,000 Assuming the merchandise sold on July 7 was priced at USD 4,800, these entries record the sale: Periodic Procedure Perpetual Procedure Accounts Receivable (+A) 4,800 Accounts Receivable (+A) 4,800 Sales (+SE) 4,800 Sales (+SE) 4,800 Cost of Goods Sold (-SE) 3,600 Merchandise Inventory(-A) 3,600 Several other transactions not included in Exhibit 48 could occur:  Assume that two of the units purchased on July 5 were returned to the supplier because they were defective.
The entries would be: p. 367 of 433 Periodic Procedure Perpetual Procedure Accounts Payable 600 Accounts Payable 600 Purchase Merchandise Returns and Inventory 600 Allowances 600  Assume that the supplier instead granted an allowance of USD 600 to the company because of the defective merchandise.
The entries would be: Periodic Procedure Perpetual Procedure Accounts Payable (-L) 600 Accounts Payable (-L) 600 Purchase Merchandise Returns and Inventory (-A) 600 Allowances (-A) 600  Assume that the company incurred and paid freight charges of USD 100 on the purchase of July 5.
The entries would be: Periodic Procedure Perpetual Procedure Transportation-In (+A) 100 Merchandise Inventory 100 Cash (-A) 100 (+A) 100 Cash (-A) In these entries, notice that under perpetual inventory procedure the Merchandise Inventory account records purchases, purchase returns and allowances, purchase discounts, and transportation- in.
Also, when goods are sold, the seller debits (increases) Cost of Goods Sold and credits or reduces Merchandise Inventory.
At the end of the accounting period, under perpetual inventory procedure, the only merchandise- related expense account to be closed is Cost of Goods Sold.
The Purchases, Purchase Returns and Allowances, Purchase Discounts, and Transportation-In accounts do not even exist.

Exhibit 49: Beginning inventory, purchases and sales An accounting perspective: Business insight When you buy a box of breakfast cereal at the supermarket, the cashier scans the bar code on the box.
The name of the item and the price appear on a video display that you can see.
The information is also printed on the sales slip so that you can later compare the items paid for with the items received.
But this is not the end of the story.
The information is also fed to the store's computer to update the inventory records.
The information is included with other information and is used to order more merchandise from the warehouse so the items can be replenished in the store.
At a certain point, the company also uses the reduced inventory levels to order more merchandise from suppliers, such as wholesalers that supply the region with breakfast cereals and other goods.
The paperwork for the purchase and payment are often handled electronically through a process called electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic funds transfer (EFT).
Using the data for purchases, sales, and beginning inventory in Exhibit 49, next we explain the four inventory costing methods.
Except for the specific identification method, we first present all of the methods using periodic inventory procedure and then present all of the methods using perpetual inventory procedure.
Total goods available for sale consist of 80 units with a total cost of USD 690.
A physical inventory determined that 20 units are on hand at the end of the period.
Sales revenue for the p. 369 of 433 60 units sold was USD 780.
The questions to be answered are: What is the cost of the 20 units in inventory?
What is the cost of the 60 units sold?
Specific identification The specific identification method of inventory costing attaches the actual cost to an identifiable unit of product.
Firms find this method easy to apply when purchasing and selling large inventory items such as autos.
Under the specific identification method, the firm must identify each unit in inventory, unless it is unique, with a serial number or identification tag.
To illustrate, assume that the company in Exhibit 49 can identify the 20 units on hand at year-end as 10 units from the August 12 purchase and 10 units from the December 21 purchase.
The company computes the ending inventory as shown in Exhibit 50; it subtracts the USD 181 ending inventory cost from the USD 690 cost of goods available for sale to obtain the USD 509 cost of goods sold.
Note that you can also determine the cost of goods sold for the year by recording the cost of each unit sold.
The USD 509 cost of goods sold is an expense on the income statement, and the USD 181 ending inventory is a current asset on the balance sheet.
The specific identification costing method attaches cost to an identifiable unit of inventory.
The method does not involve any assumptions about the flow of the costs as in the other inventory costing methods.
Conceptually, the method matches the cost to the physical flow of the inventory and eliminates the emphasis on the timing of the cost determination.
Therefore, periodic and perpetual inventory procedures produce the same results for the specific identification method.

This method assumes the first goods purchased are the first goods sold.
In some companies, the first units in (bought) must be the first units out (sold) to avoid large losses from spoilage.
Such items as fresh dairy products, fruits, and vegetables should be sold on a FIFO basis.
In these cases, an assumed first-in, first-out flow corresponds with the actual physical flow of goods.
Because a company using FIFO assumes the older units are sold first and the newer units are still on hand, the ending inventory consists of the most recent purchases.
When using periodic inventory procedure, to determine the cost of the ending inventory at the end of the period under FIFO, you would begin by listing the cost of the most recent purchase.
If the ending inventory contains more units than acquired in the most recent purchase, it also includes units from the next-to-the-latest purchase at the unit cost incurred, and so on.
You would list these units from the latest purchases until that number agrees with the units in the ending inventory.
In Exhibit 51, you can see how to determine the cost of ending inventory under FIFO using periodic inventory procedure.
The company assumes that the 20 units in inventory consist of 10 units purchased December 21 and 10 units purchased October 12.
The total cost of ending inventory is USD 179, and the cost of goods sold is USD 511.
We show the relationship between the cost of goods sold and the cost of ending inventory under FIFO using periodic inventory procedure in Exhibit 52.
The 80 units in cost of goods available for sale consists of the beginning inventory and all of the purchases during the period.
Under FIFO, the ending inventory of 20 units consists of the most recent purchases—10 units of the December 21 purchase and 10 units of the October 12 purchase—costing USD 179.
We assume the beginning inventory and other earlier purchases have been sold during the period, representing the cost of goods sold of USD 511. p. 371 of 433 Unit Total Units Cost Cost Ending inventory composed of purchases made on: December 21 10 $9.10 $ 91 October 12 10 8.80 88 Ending inventory 20 $179 Cost of goods sold composed of: Beginning inventory 10 8.00 $ 80 Purchases made on: March 2 10 8.50 85 May 28 20 8.40 168 August 12 10 9.00 90 October 12 10 8.80 88 $511 Cost of goods available for sale $690 Ending inventory 179 Cost of goods sold $511 Exhibit 51: Determining FIFO cost of ending inventory under periodic inventory procedure Exhibit 52: FIFO flow of costs LIFO (last-in, first-out) under periodic inventory procedure The LIFO (last-in, first- out) method of inventory costing assumes that the costs of the most recent purchases are the first costs charged to cost of goods sold when the company actually sells the goods.
In Exhibit 53, we show the use of LIFO under periodic inventory procedure.
Since the company charges the latest costs to cost of goods sold under periodic inventory procedure, the ending inventory always consists of the oldest costs.
Therefore, when determining the cost of inventory under periodic p. 372 of 433 inventory procedure, the company lists the oldest units and their costs.
The first units listed are those in beginning inventory, then the first purchase, and so on, until the number listed agrees with the units in ending inventory.
Thus, ending inventory in Exhibit 53 consists of the 10 units from beginning inventory and the 10 units purchased on March 2.
The total cost of these 20 units, USD 165, is the ending inventory cost; the cost of goods sold is USD 525.
Exhibit 54 is a graphic representation of the LIFO flow of costs under periodic inventory procedure.

Companies most often use the weighted-average method to determine a cost for units that are basically the same, such as identical games in a toy store or identical electrical tools in a hardware store.
Since the units are alike, firms can assign the same unit cost to them.
Under periodic inventory procedure, a company determines the average cost at the end of the accounting period by dividing the total units purchased plus those in beginning inventory into total cost of goods available for sale.
The ending inventory is carried at this per unit cost.
To see how a company uses the weighted-average method to determine inventory costs using periodic inventory procedure, look at Exhibit 55.
Note that we compute weighted-average cost per unit by dividing the cost of units available for sale, USD 690, by the total number of units available for sale, 80.
Thus, the weighted-average cost per unit is USD 8.625, meaning that each unit sold or remaining in inventory is valued at USD 8.625.

Also, the firm has already recorded the cost of goods sold in the Cost of Goods Sold account.
Exhibit 56 shows how to determine the cost of ending inventory under FIFO using perpetual inventory procedure.

Total cost of ending inventory = $171 Exhibit 57: Determining LIFO cost of ending inventory under perpetual inventory procedure Notice in Exhibit 56 that each time a sale occurs, the company assumes the items sold are the oldest on hand.
Thus, after each transaction, it can readily determine the balance in the Merchandise Inventory account from the perpetual inventory record.
The balance after the December 21 purchase represents the 20 units from the most recent purchases.
The total cost of ending inventory is USD 179, which the company reports as a current asset on the balance sheet.
During the accounting period, as sales occurred the firm would have debited a total of USD 511 to Cost of Goods Sold.
Adding this USD 511 to the ending inventory of USD 179 accounts for the USD 690 cost of goods available for sale.
Under FIFO, using either perpetual or periodic inventory procedures results in the same total amounts for ending inventory and for cost of goods sold.
LIFO under perpetual inventory procedure Look at Exhibit 57 to see the LIFO method using perpetual inventory procedure.
Under this procedure, the inventory composition and balance are updated with each purchase and sale.
Notice in Exhibit 57 that each time a sale occurs, the items sold are assumed to be the most recent ones acquired.
Despite numerous purchases and sales during the p. 376 of 433 year, the ending inventory still includes the 10 units from beginning inventory in our example.
The remainder of the ending inventory consists of the last purchase because no sale occurred after the December 21 purchase.
The total cost of the 20 units in ending inventory is USD 171; the cost of goods sold is USD 519.
Exhibit 58 shows graphically the LIFO flow of costs under perpetual inventory procedure.
Applying LIFO on a perpetual basis during the accounting period, as shown in Exhibit 57, results in different ending inventory and cost of goods sold figures than applying LIFO only at year-end using periodic inventory procedure.
(Compare Exhibit 57 and Exhibit 53 to verify that ending inventory and cost of goods sold are different under the two procedures.)
For this reason, if LIFO is applied on a perpetual basis during the period, special adjustments are sometimes necessary at year-end to take full advantage of using LIFO for tax purposes.
Complicated applications of LIFO perpetual inventory procedures that require such adjustments are beyond the scope of this text.

Exhibit 59: Determining ending inventory under weighted-average method using perpetual inventory procedure Look at Exhibit 58 and Exhibit 54, the flow of inventory costs under LIFO using both the perpetual and periodic inventory procedures.
Note that ending inventory and cost of goods sold are different under the two procedures.
Weighted-average under perpetual inventory procedure Under perpetual inventory procedure, firms compute a new weighted-average unit cost after each purchase by dividing total cost of goods available for sale by total units available for sale.
The unit cost is a moving weighted-average because it changes after each purchase.
In Exhibit 59, you can see how to compute the moving weighted-average using perpetual inventory procedure.
The new weighted-average unit cost computed after each purchase is the unit cost for inventory items sold until a new purchase is made.
The unit cost of the 20 units in ending inventory is USD 8.929 for a total inventory cost of USD 178.58.
Cost of goods sold under this procedure is USD 690 minus the USD 178.58, or USD 511.42. p. 378 of 433 Advantages and disadvantages of specific identification Companies that use the specific identification method of inventory costing state their cost of goods sold and ending inventory at the actual cost of specific units sold and on hand.
Some accountants argue that this method provides the most precise matching of costs and revenues and is, therefore, the most theoretically sound method.
This statement is true for some one-of-a-kind items, such as autos or real estate.
For these items, use of any other method would seem illogical.
One disadvantage of the specific identification method is that it permits the manipulation of income.
For example, assume that a company bought three identical units of a given product at different prices.
One unit cost USD 2,000, the second cost USD 2,100, and the third cost USD 2,200.
The company sold one unit for USD 2,800.
The units are alike, so the customer does not care which of the identical units the company ships.
However, the gross margin on the sale could be either USD 800, USD 700, or USD 600, depending on which unit the company ships.
Advantages and disadvantages of FIFO The FIFO method has four major advantages: (1) it is easy to apply, (2) the assumed flow of costs corresponds with the normal physical flow of goods, (3) no manipulation of income is possible, and (4) the balance sheet amount for inventory is likely to approximate the current market value.
All the advantages of FIFO occur because when a company sells goods, the first costs it removes from inventory are the oldest unit costs.
A company cannot manipulate income by choosing which unit to ship because the cost of a unit sold is not determined by a serial number.
Instead, the cost attached to the unit sold is always the oldest cost.
Under FIFO, purchases at the end of the period have no effect on cost of goods sold or net income.
The disadvantages of FIFO include (1) the recognition of paper profits and (2) a heavier tax burden if used for tax purposes in periods of inflation.
We discuss these disadvantages later as advantages of LIFO.
Advantages and disadvantages of LIFO The advantages of the LIFO method are based on the fact that prices have risen almost constantly for decades.
LIFO supporters claim this upward trend in prices leads to inventory, or paper, profits if the FIFO method is used.
Inventory, or paper, profits are equal to the current replacement cost of a unit of inventory at the time of sale minus the unit's historical cost.
For example, assume a company has three units of a product on hand, each purchased at a different cost: USD 12, USD 15, and USD 20 (the most recent cost).
The sales price of the unit normally rises because the unit's replacement cost is rising.
Assume that the company sells one unit for USD 30.
FIFO gross margin would be USD 18 (USD 30 – USD 12), while LIFO would show a gross margin of USD 10 (USD 30 – USD 20).
LIFO supporters would say that the extra USD 8 gross margin shown under FIFO p. 379 of 433 represents inventory (paper) profit; it is merely the additional amount that the company must spend over cost of goods sold to purchase another unit of inventory (USD 8 + USD 12 = USD 20).
Thus, the profit is not real; it exists only on paper.
The company cannot distribute the USD 8 to owners, but must retain it to continue handling that particular product.
LIFO shows the actual profits that the company can distribute to the owners while still replenishing inventory.
During periods of inflation, LIFO shows the largest cost of goods sold of any of the costing methods because the newest costs charged to cost of goods sold are also the highest costs.
The larger the cost of goods sold, the smaller the net income.
Those who favor LIFO argue that its use leads to a better matching of costs and revenues than the other methods.
When a company uses LIFO, the income statement reports both sales revenue and cost of goods sold in current dollars.
The resulting gross margin is a better indicator of management's ability to generate income than gross margin computed using FIFO, which may include substantial inventory (paper) profits.
Supporters of FIFO argue that LIFO (1) matches the cost of goods not sold against revenues, (2) grossly understates inventory, and (3) permits income manipulation.
The first criticism—that LIFO matches the cost of goods not sold against revenues—is an extension of the debate over whether the assumed flow of costs should agree with the physical flow of goods.
LIFO supporters contend that it makes more sense to match current costs against current revenues than to worry about matching costs for the physical flow of goods.
The second criticism—that LIFO grossly understates inventory—is valid.
A company may report LIFO inventory at a fraction of its current replacement cost, especially if the historical costs are from several decades ago.
LIFO supporters contend that the increased usefulness of the income statement more than offsets the negative effect of this undervaluation of inventory on the balance sheet.
The third criticism—that LIFO permits income manipulation—is also valid.
Income manipulation is possible under LIFO.
For example, assume that management wishes to reduce income.
The company could purchase an abnormal amount of goods at current high prices near the end of the current period, with the purpose of selling the goods in the next period.
Under LIFO, these higher costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the current period, resulting in a substantial decline in reported net income.
To obtain higher income, management could delay making the normal amount of purchases until the next period and thus include some of the older, lower costs in cost of goods sold.
Tax benefit of LIFO The LIFO method results in the lowest taxable income, and thus the lowest income taxes, when prices are rising.
The Internal Revenue Service allows companies to use LIFO for tax purposes only if they use LIFO for financial reporting purposes.
Companies may also report an p. 380 of 433 alternative inventory amount in the notes to their financial statements for comparison purposes.
Because of high inflation during the 1970s, many companies switched from FIFO to LIFO for tax advantages.
Advantages and disadvantages of weighted-average When a company uses the weighted- average method and prices are rising, its cost of goods sold is less than that obtained under LIFO, but more than that obtained under FIFO.
Inventory is not as badly understated as under LIFO, but it is not as up-to-date as under FIFO.
Weighted-average costing takes a middle-of-the-road approach.
A company can manipulate income under the weighted-average costing method by buying or failing to buy goods near year-end.
However, the averaging process reduces the effects of buying or not buying.
The four inventory costing methods, specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, and weighted-average, involve assumptions about how costs flow through a business.
In some instances, assumed cost flows may correspond with the actual physical flow of goods.
For example, fresh meats and dairy products must flow in a FIFO manner to avoid spoilage losses.
In contrast, firms use coal stacked in a pile in a LIFO manner because the newest units purchased are unloaded on top of the pile and sold first.
Gasoline held in a tank is a good example of an inventory that has an average physical flow.
As the tank is refilled, the new gasoline mixes with the old.
Thus, any amount used is a blend of the old gas with the new.
Although physical flows are sometimes cited as support for an inventory method, accountants now recognize that an inventory method's assumed cost flows need not necessarily correspond with the actual physical flow of the goods.
In fact, good reasons exist for simply ignoring physical flows and choosing an inventory method based on other criteria.
In Exhibit 60 and Exhibit 61, we use data from Exhibit 49 to show the cost of goods sold, inventory cost, and gross margin for each of the four basic costing methods using perpetual and periodic inventory procedures.
The differences for the four methods occur because the company paid different prices for goods purchased.
No differences would occur if purchase prices were constant.
Since a company's purchase prices are seldom constant, inventory costing method affects cost of goods sold, inventory cost, gross margin, and net income.
Therefore, companies must disclose on their financial statements which inventory costing methods were used.
Which is the correct method?
All four methods of inventory costing are acceptable; no single method is the only correct method.
Different methods are attractive under different conditions.
If a company wants to match sales revenue with current cost of goods sold, it would use LIFO.
If a company seeks to reduce its income taxes in a period of rising prices, it would also use LIFO.
On the p. 381 of 433 other hand, LIFO often charges against revenues the cost of goods not actually sold.
Also, LIFO may allow the company to manipulate net income by changing the timing of additional purchases.
The FIFO and specific identification methods result in a more precise matching of historical cost with revenue.
However, FIFO can give rise to paper profits, while specific identification can give rise to income manipulation.
The weighted-average method also allows manipulation of income.
Only under FIFO is the manipulation of net income not possible.
An accounting perspective: Business insight Management decides which inventory costing method or methods (LIFO, FIFO, etc.)
to use.
Also, management must determine which method is the most meaningful and useful in representing economic results.
Then, it must use the selected method consistently.
The principal business of Kellwood Company is the marketing, merchandising, and manufacturing of apparel, primarily for women.
Note in the following footnote from Kellwood's financial statements that it, like other companies, uses several costing methods within the same enterprise: “Summary of significant accounting policies 3.
Inventories and revenue recognition Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method is used to determine the value of 46 per cent of the domestic inventories, and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to value the remaining domestic inventories.
Inventories of foreign subsidiaries are valued using the specific identification method.
Sales are recognized when goods are shipped.” Generally, companies use the inventory method that best fits their individual circumstances.
However, this freedom of choice does not include changing inventory methods every year or so, especially if the goal is to report higher income.
Continuous switching of methods violates the accounting principle of consistency, which requires using the same accounting methods from period to period in preparing financial statements.
Consistency of methods in preparing financial statements enables financial statement users to compare statements of a company from period to period and determine trends.

Improved financial reporting is the only justification for a change in inventory method.
A company that changes its inventory method must make a full disclosure of the change.
Usually, the company makes a full disclosure in a footnote to the financial statements.
The footnote consists of a complete description of the change, the reasons why the change was made, and, if possible, the effect of the change on net income.
J. M. Tull Industries, Inc., sells a diverse range of metals (aluminum, brass, copper, steel, stainless steel, and nickel alloys) for severe corrosion conditions and high- temperature applications.
For example, when J. M. Tull changed from lower of average cost or market to LIFO, the following footnote appeared in its annual report: Note B.
Change in accounting method for inventory The company changed its method of determining inventory cost from the lower of average cost or market method to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all inventory.
This change was made because management believes LIFO more clearly reflects income by providing a closer matching of current cost against current revenue.
Now we illustrate in more detail the journal entries made when using perpetual inventory procedure.
Data from Exhibit 56 serves as the basis for some of the entries.
You would debit the Merchandise Inventory account to record the increases in the asset due to purchase costs and transportation-in costs.
You would credit Merchandise Inventory to record the decreases in the asset brought about by purchase returns and allowances, purchase discounts, and cost of goods sold to customers.
The balance in the account is the cost of the inventory that should be on hand at any date.
This entry records the purchase of 10 units on March 2 in Exhibit 56: Mar.
2 Merchandise Inventory (+A) 85 Accounts Payable (+L) 85 To record purchases of 10 units at $8.50 on account.
p. 384 of 433 You would also record the 10 units sold on the perpetual inventory record in Exhibit 56.
Perpetual inventory procedure requires two journal entries for each sale.
One entry is at selling price—a debit to Accounts Receivable (or Cash) and a credit to Sales.
The other entry is at cost—a debit to Cost of Goods Sold and a credit to Merchandise Inventory.
Assuming that the 10 units sold on March 10 in Exhibit 56 had a retail price of USD 13 each, you would record the following entries: Mar.
10 Accounts Receivable (+A) 130 Sales (+SE) 130 To record 10 units sold at $13 each on account.
10 Cost of Goods Sold (-SE) 80 Merchandise Inventory (-A) 80 To record cost of $8 on each of the 10 units sold.
When a company sells merchandise to customers, it transfers the cost of the merchandise from an asset account (Merchandise Inventory) to an expense account (Cost of Goods Sold).
The company makes this transfer because the sale reduces the asset, and the cost of the goods sold is one of the expenses of making the sale.
Thus, the Cost of Goods Sold account accumulates the cost of all the merchandise that the company sells during a period.
A sales return also requires two entries, one at selling price and one at cost.
Assume that a customer returned merchandise that cost USD 20 and originally sold for USD 32.
The entry to reduce the accounts receivable and to record the sales return of USD 32 is: Mar.
17 Sales Return and Allowances (-SE) 32 Accounts Receivable (-A) 32 To record the reduction in amount owed by a customer upon return of goods.
The entry that increases the Merchandise Inventory account and decreases the Cost of Goods Sold account by USD 20 is as follows: Mar.
17 Merchandise Inventory (+A) 20 Cost of Goods Sold (+SE) 20 To record replacement of goods returned to inventory.
Sales returns affect both revenues and cost of goods sold because the goods charged to cost of goods sold are actually returned to the seller.
In contrast, sales allowances granted to customers affect only revenues because the customers do not have to return goods.
Thus, if the company had granted a sales allowance of USD 32 on March 17, only the first entry would be required.
p. 385 of 433 The balance of the Merchandise Inventory account is the cost of the inventory that should be on hand.
This fact is a major reason some companies choose to use perpetual inventory procedure.
The cost of inventory that should be on hand is readily available.
A physical inventory determines the accuracy of the account balance.
Management may investigate any major discrepancies between the balance in the account and the cost based on the physical count.
It thereby achieves greater control over inventory.
When a shortage is discovered, an adjusting entry is required.
Assuming a USD 15 shortage (at cost) is discovered, the entry is: Dec. 31 Loss from Inventory Shortage (-SE) 15 Merchandise Inventory (-A) 15 To record inventory shortage Assume that the Cost of Goods Sold account had a balance of USD 200,000 by year-end when it is closed to Income Summary.
There are no other purchase-related accounts to be closed.
The entry to close the Cost of Goods Sold account is: Dec. 31 Income Summary 200,000 Cost of Goods Sold 200,000 To close Cost of Goods Sold account to Income Summary at the end of the year.
8.6 Departures from cost basis of inventory measurement Generally, companies should use historical cost to value inventories and cost of goods sold.
However, some circumstances justify departures from historical cost.
One of these circumstances is when the utility or value of inventory items is less than their cost.
A decline in the selling price of the goods or their replacement cost may indicate such a loss of utility.
This section explains how accountants handle some of these departures from the cost basis of inventory measurement.
Companies should not carry goods in inventory at more than their net realizable value.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of an item less the estimated costs that the company incurs in preparing the item for sale and selling it.
Damaged, obsolete, or shopworn goods often have a net realizable value lower than their historical cost and must be written down to their net realizable value.
However, goods do not have to be damaged, obsolete, or shopworn for this situation to occur.
Technological changes and increased competition have caused significant reductions in selling prices for such products as computers, TVs, DVD players, and digital cameras.
p. 386 of 433 To illustrate a necessary write-down in the cost of inventory, assume that an automobile dealer has a demonstrator on hand.
The dealer acquired the auto at a cost of USD 18,000.
The auto had an original selling price of USD 19,600.
Since the dealer used the auto as a demonstrator and the new models are coming in, the auto now has an estimated selling price of only USD 18,100.
However, the dealer can get the USD 18,100 only if the demonstrator receives some scheduled maintenance, including a tune-up and some paint damage repairs.
This work and the sales commission cost USD 300.
The net realizable value of the demonstrator, then, is USD 17,800 (selling price of USD 18,100 less costs of USD 300).
For inventory purposes, the required journal entry is: Loss Due to the Decline in Market Value of Inventory (-SE) 200 Merchandise Inventory (-A) 200 To write down inventory to net realizable value ($18,000 - $17,800) This entry treats the USD 200 inventory decline as a loss in the period in which the decline in utility occurred.
Such an entry is necessary only when the net realizable value is less than cost.
If net realizable value declines but still exceeds cost, the dealer would continue to carry the item at cost.
The lower-of-cost-or-market (LCM) method is an inventory costing method that values inventory at the lower of its historical cost or its current market (replacement) cost.
The term cost refers to historical cost of inventory as determined under the specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, or weighted-average inventory method.
Market generally refers to a merchandise item's replacement cost in the quantity usually purchased.
The basic assumption of the LCM method is that if the purchase price of an item has fallen, its selling price also has fallen or will fall.
The LCM method has long been accepted in accounting.
Under LCM, inventory items are written down to market value when the market value is less than the cost of the items.
For example, assume that the market value of the inventory is USD 39,600 and its cost is USD 40,000.
Then, the company would record a USD 400 loss because the inventory has lost some of its revenue-generating ability.
The company must recognize the loss in the period the loss occurred.
On the other hand, if ending inventory has a market value of USD 45,000 and a cost of USD 40,000, the company would not recognize this increase in value.
To do so would recognize revenue before the time of sale.
LCM applied A company may apply LCM to each inventory item (such as Monopoly), each inventory class (such as games), or total inventory.
To see how the company would apply the method to individual items and total inventory, look at Exhibit 62. p. 387 of 433 If LCM is applied on an item-by-item basis, ending inventory would be USD 5,000.
The company would deduct the USD 5,000 ending inventory from cost of goods available for sale on the income statement and report this inventory in the current assets section of the balance sheet.
Under the class method, a company applies LCM to the total cost and total market for each class of items compared.
One class might be games; another might be toys.
Then, the company values each class at the lower of its cost or market amount.
If LCM is applied on a total inventory basis, ending inventory would be USD 5,100, since total cost of USD 5,100 is lower than total market of USD 5,150.
An annual report of Du Pont contains an actual example of applying LCM.
The report states that "substantially all inventories are valued at cost as determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method; in the aggregate, such valuations are not in excess of market".
The term in the aggregate means that Du Pont applied LCM to total inventory.
An accounting perspective: Business insight Procter & Gamble markets a broad range of laundry, cleaning, paper, beauty care, health care, food, and beverage products around the world.
Procter & Gamble's footnote in its Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in its annual report illustrates that companies often disclose LCM in their notes to financial statements.
Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of current market price.
Cost is primarily determined by either the average cost or the first-in, first-out method.
The replacement cost of last-in, first-out inventories exceeds carrying value by approximately USD 169 [million].

The effort of taking a physical inventory can be very expensive and disrupts normal business operations; once a year is often enough.
 To compare with physical inventories to determine whether shortages exist.
 To determine the amount recoverable from an insurance company when fire has destroyed inventory or the inventory has been stolen.
Next, we introduce two recognized methods of estimating the cost of ending inventory when a company has not taken a physical inventory—the gross margin method and the retail inventory method.
Gross margin method The steps in calculating ending inventory under the gross margin method are:  Estimate gross margin (based on net sales) using the same gross margin rate experienced in prior accounting periods.
 Determine estimated cost of goods sold by deducting estimated gross margin from net sales.
 Determine estimated ending inventory by deducting estimated cost of goods sold from cost of goods available for sale.
Thus, the gross margin method estimates ending inventory by deducting estimated cost of goods sold from cost of goods available for sale.
The gross margin method assumes that a fairly stable relationship exists between gross margin and net sales.
In other words, gross margin has been a fairly constant percentage of net sales, and this relationship has continued into the current period.
If this percentage relationship has changed, the gross margin method does not yield satisfactory results.
p. 389 of 433 To illustrate the gross margin method of computing inventory, assume that for several years Field Company has maintained a 30 per cent gross margin on net sales.
The following data for 2010 are available: The January 1 inventory was USD 40,000; net cost of purchases of merchandise was USD 480,000; and net sales of merchandise were USD 700,000.
As shown in Exhibit 63, Field can estimate the inventory for 2010 December 31, by deducting the estimated cost of goods sold from the actual cost of goods available for sale.
An alternative format for calculating estimated ending inventory uses the standard income statement format and solves for the one unknown (ending inventory): Net sales $700,000 Less cost of goods sold: Merchandise inventory, 2010 January 1 $ 40,000 Net cost of purchases 480,000 Cost of goods available for sale $520,000 Less estimated inventory, 2010 December 31 (70% of Estimated cost of goods sold 490,000 net sales (30% of Estimated gross margin $210,000 net sales) We know that: Costsofgoodsavailableforsale−Endinginventory=Costofgoodssold Therefore (let X = Ending inventory): USD 520,000 - X = USD 490,000 X = USD 30,000 The gross margin method is not precise enough to be used for year-end financial statements.
At year-end, a physical inventory must be taken and valued by either the specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, or weighted-average methods.
Retail inventory method Retail stores frequently use the retail inventory method to estimate ending inventory at times other than year-end.
Taking a physical inventory during an accounting period (such as monthly or quarterly) is too time consuming and significantly interferes with business operations.
The retail inventory method estimates the cost of the ending inventory by applying a cost/retail price ratio to ending inventory stated at retail prices.
The advantage of this method is that companies can estimate ending inventory (at cost) without taking a physical inventory.
Thus, the use of this estimate permits the preparation of interim financial statements (monthly or quarterly) without p. 390 of 433 taking a physical inventory.
The steps for finding the ending inventory by the retail inventory method are:  Total the beginning inventory and the net amount of goods purchased during the period at both cost and retail prices.
 Divide the cost of goods available for sale by the retail price of the goods available for sale to find the cost/retail price ratio.
 Deduct the retail sales from the retail price of the goods available for sale to determine ending inventory at retail.
 Multiply the cost/retail price ratio or percentage by the ending inventory at retail prices to reduce it to the ending inventory at cost.
Cost Retail Merchandise inventory, 2010 January 1 $ 22,000 $ 40,000 Purchases 182,000 303,000 Purchase returns (2,000) (3,000) Purchase allowances (3,000) Transportation-in 5,000 Goods available for sale $204,000 $340,000 Cost/retail price ratio: $204,000/$340,000=60% Sales 280,000 Ending inventory at retail prices $ 60,000 Times cost/retail price ratio x 60% Ending inventory at cost, 2010 March 31 $ 36,000 Exhibit 64: Inventory estimation In Exhibit 64, we show the retail inventory method.
In the exhibit, the cost (USD 22,000) and retail (USD 40,000) amounts for beginning inventory are available from the preceding period's computation.
The amounts for the first quarter purchases, purchase returns, purchase allowances, and transportation-in came from the accounting records.
The amounts for purchase allowances and transportation-in appear only in the cost column.
The first quarter sales amount (USD 280,000) is from the Sales account and stated at retail (sales) prices.
The difference between what was available for sale at retail prices and what was sold at retail prices (which is sales) equals what should be on hand (March 31 inventory of USD 60,000) expressed in retail prices.
The retail price of the March 31 inventory needs to be converted into cost for use in the financial statements.
We do this by multiplying it times the cost/retail price ratio.
In the example, the cost/retail price ratio is 60 per cent, which means that on the average, 60 cents of each sales dollar is cost of goods sold.
To find the 2010 March 31, inventory at cost (USD 36,000), we multiplied the ending inventory at retail (USD 60,000) by 60 per cent.
p. 391 of 433 Once the March 31 inventory has been estimated at cost (USD 36,000), we deduct the cost of the inventory from cost of goods available for sale (USD 204,000) to determine cost of goods sold (USD 168,000).
We can also find the cost of goods sold by multiplying the cost/retail price ratio of 60 per cent by sales of USD 280,000.
For the next quarterly period, the USD 36,000 and USD 60,000 amounts would appear on the schedule as beginning inventory at cost and retail, respectively.
We would include other quarterly data regarding purchases, purchase returns, purchase allowances, and transportation-in to determine goods available for sale at cost and at retail.
From these amounts, we could compute a new cost/retail price ratio for the second quarter.
At the end of each year, merchandisers usually take a physical inventory at retail prices.
Since the retail prices are on the individual items (while the cost is not), taking an inventory at retail prices is more convenient than taking an inventory at cost.
Accountants can then compare the results of the physical inventory to the calculation of inventory at retail under the retail inventory method for the fourth quarter to determine whether a shortage exists.
Both the gross margin and the retail inventory methods can help you detect inventory shortages.
To illustrate how you can determine inventory shortages using the retail method, assume that a physical inventory taken at year end, showed only USD 62,000 of retail-priced goods in the store.
Assume that use of the retail method for the fourth quarter showed that USD 66,000 of goods should be on hand, thus indicating a USD 4,000 inventory shortage at retail.
After converting the USD 4,000 to USD 2,400 of cost (USD 4,000 X 0.60) you would report this as a "Loss from inventory shortage" in the income statement.
Knowledge of such shortages may lead management to reduce or prevent them, by increasing security or improving the training of employees.
p. 392 of 433 An ethical perspective: Dorsey hardware Terry Dorsey started Dorsey Hardware, a small hardware store, two years ago and has struggled to make it successful.
The first year of operations resulted in a substantial loss; in the second year, there was a small net income.
His initial cash investment was almost depleted because he had to withdraw money for living expenses.
The current year of operations looked much better.
His customer base was growing and seemed to be loyal.
To increase sales, however, Terry had to invest his remaining funds and the proceeds of a USD 40,000 bank loan into doubling the size of his inventory and purchasing some new display shelves and a new truck.
At the end of the third year, Terry's accountant asked him for his ending inventory figure and later told him that initial estimates indicated that net income (and taxable income) for the year would be approximately USD 80,000.
Terry was delighted until he learned that the federal income taxes on that income would be about USD 17,250.
He told the accountant that he did not have enough cash to pay the taxes and could not even borrow it, since he already had an outstanding loan at the bank.
Terry asked the accountant for a copy of the income statement figures so he could see if any items had been overlooked that might reduce his net income.
He noticed that ending inventory of USD 160,000 had been deducted from cost of goods available for sale of USD 640,000 to arrive at cost of goods sold of USD 480,000.
Net sales of USD 720,000 and expenses of USD 160,000 could not be changed.
But Terry hit on a scheme to reduce his net income.
The next day he told his accountant that he had made an error in determining ending inventory and that its correct amount was USD 120,000.
This lower inventory amount would increase cost of goods sold by USD 40,000 and reduce net income by that same amount.
The resulting income taxes would be about USD 6,000, which was just about what Terry had paid in estimated taxes.
To justify his action in his own mind, Terry used the following arguments: (1) federal taxes are too high, and the federal government seems to be taxing the little guy out of existence; (2) no harm is really done because, when the business becomes more profitable, I will use correct inventory amounts, and this loan from the government will be paid back; (3) since I am the only one who knows the correct ending inventory I will not get caught; and (4) I bet a lot of other people do the same thing.
p. 393 of 433  8.7 Analyzing and using financial results—inventory turnover ratio An important ratio for managers, investors, and creditors to consider when analyzing a company's inventory is the inventory turnover ratio.
This ratio tests whether a company is generating a sufficient volume of business based on its inventory.
To calculate the inventory turnover ratio: Costofgoodssold Inventoryturnoverratio= Averageinventory Inventory turnover measures the efficiency of the firm in managing and selling inventory: thus, it gauges the liquidity of the firm's inventory.
A high inventory turnover is generally a sign of efficient inventory management and profit for the firm; the faster inventory sells, the less time funds are tied up in inventory.
A relatively low turnover could be the result of a company carrying too much inventory or stocking inventory that is obsolete, slow-moving, or inferior.
In assessing inventory turnover, analysts also consider the type of industry.
When making comparisons among firms, they check the cost-flow assumption used to value inventory and cost of products sold.
Abercrombie & Fitch reported the following financial data for 2000 (in thousands): Cost of goods sold....... $728,229 Beginning inventory...... 75,262 Ending inventory........ 120,997 Their inventory turnover is: USD 728,229/[(USD 75,262 + USD 120,997)/2] = 7.4 times You should now understand the importance of taking an accurate physical inventory and knowing how to value this inventory.
In the next chapter, you will learn the general principles of internal control and how to control cash.
Cash is one of a company's most important and mobile assets.
8.8 Understanding the learning objectives  Net income for an accounting period depends directly on the valuation of ending inventory.
 If ending inventory is overstated, cost of goods sold is understated, resulting in an overstatement of gross margin, net income, and retained earnings.
p. 394 of 433  When ending inventory is misstated in the current year, companies carry that misstatement forward into the next year.
 An error in the net income of one year caused by misstated ending inventory automatically causes an error in net income in the opposite direction in the next period because of the misstated beginning inventory.
 Inventory cost includes all necessary outlays to obtain the goods, get the goods ready to sell, and have the goods in the desired location for sale to customers.
 Inventory cost includes: a.
Seller's gross selling price less purchase discount.
b.
Cost of insurance on the goods while in transit.
c. Transportation charges when borne by the buyer.
d. Handling costs, such as the cost of pressing clothes wrinkled during shipment.
 Specific identification: Attaches actual cost of each unit of product to units in ending inventory and cost of goods sold.
Specific identification creates precise matching in determining net income.
 FIFO (first-in, first-out): Ending inventory consists of the most recent purchases.
FIFO assumes that the costs of the first goods purchased are those charged to cost of goods sold when goods are sold.
During periods of rising prices, FIFO creates higher net income since the costs charged to cost of goods sold are lower.
 LIFO (last-in, first-out): Ending inventory consists of the oldest costs.
LIFO assumes that the costs of the most recent purchases are the first costs charged to cost of goods sold.
Net income is usually lower under LIFO since the costs charged to cost of goods sold are higher due to inflation.
The ending inventory may differ between perpetual and periodic inventory procedures.
 Weighted-average: Ending inventory is priced using a weighted-average unit cost.
Under perpetual inventory procedure, a new weighted-average is determined after each purchase.
Under periodic procedure, the average is determined at the end of the accounting period by dividing the total number of units purchased plus those in beginning inventory into total cost of goods available for sale.
In determining cost of goods sold, this average unit cost is applied to each item.
Under the weighted-average method, in a period of rising prices net income is usually higher than income under LIFO and lower than income under FIFO.
 Specific identification: Advantages: (1) States cost of goods sold and ending inventory at the actual cost of specific units sold and on hand, and (2) provides the most precise matching of costs and revenues.
Disadvantage: Income manipulation is possible.
p. 395 of 433  FIFO: Advantages: (1) FIFO is easy to apply, (2) the assumed flow of costs often corresponds with the normal physical flow of goods, (3) no manipulation of income is possible, and (4) the balance sheet amount for inventory is likely to approximate the current market value.
Disadvantages: (1) Recognizes paper profits, and (2) tax burden is heavier if used for tax purposes when prices are rising.
 LIFO: Advantages: (1) LIFO reports both sales revenue and cost of goods sold in current dollars, and (2) lower income taxes result if used for tax purposes when prices are rising.
Disadvantages: (1) Often matches the cost of goods not sold against revenues, (2) grossly understates inventory, and (3) permits income manipulation.
 Weighted-average: Advantages: Due to the averaging process, the effects of year-end buying or not buying are lessened.
Disadvantage: Manipulation of income is possible.
 Perpetual inventory procedure requires an entry to Merchandise Inventory whenever goods are purchased, returned, sold, or otherwise adjusted, so that inventory records reflect actual units on hand at all times.
Thus, an entry is required to record cost of goods sold for each sale.
 Companies should not carry goods in inventory at more than their net realizable value.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of an item less the estimated costs incurred in preparing the item for sale and selling it.
Inventory items are written down to market value when the market value is less than the cost of the items.
If market value is greater than cost, the increase in value is not recognized.
LCM may be applied to each inventory item, each inventory class, or total inventory.
 The steps in calculating ending inventory under the gross margin method are: a.
Estimate gross margin (based on net sales) using the same gross margin rate experienced in prior accounting periods.
b.
Determine estimated cost of goods sold by deducting estimated gross margin from net sales.
c. Determine estimated ending inventory by deducting estimated cost of goods sold from cost of goods available for sale.
 The retail inventory method estimates the cost of the ending inventory by applying a cost/retail price ratio to ending inventory stated at retail prices.
To find the cost/retail price ratio, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the retail price of the goods available for sale.
(Costofgoodssold)  Inventoryturnoverration= (Averageinventory) p. 396 of 433  Inventory turnover measures the efficiency of the firm in managing and selling inventory.
It gauges the liquidity of the firm's inventory.

$ 16,800 8.8.3 Key terms FIFO (first-in, first-out) A method of costing inventory that assumes the costs of the first goods purchased are those charged to cost of goods sold when the company actually sells goods.
Gross margin method A procedure for estimating inventory cost in which estimated cost of goods sold (determined using an estimated gross margin) is deducted from the cost of goods available for sale to determine estimated ending inventory.
The estimated gross margin is calculated using gross margin rates (in relation to net sales) of prior periods.
Inventory, or paper, profits Equal to the current replacement cost to purchase a unit of inventory at time of sale minus the unit's historical cost.
Inventory turnover ratio Cost of goods sold/Average inventory.
LIFO (last-in, first-out) A method of costing inventory that assumes the costs of the most recent purchases are the first costs charged to cost of goods sold when the company actually sells the goods.
Lower-of-cost-or-market (LCM) method An inventory costing method that values inventory at the lower of its historical cost or its current market (replacement) cost.
Merchandise inventory The quantity of goods held by a merchandising company for resale to customers.
Net realizable value Estimated selling price of an item less the estimated costs incurred in preparing the item for sale and selling it.
Retail inventory method A procedure for estimating the cost of the ending inventory by applying a cost/ retail price ratio to ending inventory stated at retail prices.
p. 403 of 433 Specific identification method An inventory costing method that attaches the actual cost to an identifiable unit of product.
Weighted-average method A method of costing ending inventory using a weighted-average unit cost.
Under perpetual inventory procedure, a new weighted-average is calculated after each purchase.
Under periodic procedure, the weighted-average is determined by dividing the total number of units purchased plus those in beginning inventory into total cost of goods available for sale.
Units in the ending inventory are carried at this per unit cost.
8.8.4 Self-test 8.8.4.1 True-false Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or false.
(1) Overstated ending inventory results in an overstatement of cost of goods sold and an understatement of gross margin and net income.
(2) In a period of rising prices, FIFO results in the lowest cost of goods sold.
(3) Under LCM, inventory is written down to market value when the market value is less than the cost, and inventory is written up to market value when the market value is greater than the cost.
(4) Under the gross margin method, an estimate must be made of gross margin to determine estimated cost of goods sold and estimated ending inventory.
(5) To use the retail inventory method, both cost and retail prices must be known for the goods available for sale.
(6) Under perpetual procedure, cost of goods sold is determined as a result of the closing entries made at the end of the period.

Both heard a presentation by the manufacturer of an exercise device and decided to become a distributor of this exerciser.
Green's sales territory is Cobb County, and Lewis's sales territory is Gwinnett County.
Each owns her own business.
To induce Green and Lewis to become distributors, the manufacturer made price concessions on the first 1,000 units purchased.
The manufacturer sold the first 200 units at USD 15 each, the next 300 at USD 18 per unit, and the next 500 at USD 19 per unit.
After that, Green and Lewis had to pay USD 20 per unit.
During the first year, each bought 1,200 units; coincidentally, both sold exactly 950 units for USD 27 each.
Green had USD 2,600 of selling expenses; Lewis incurred USD 1,700 of selling expenses.
(Green's expenses were considerably higher because on December 28 she distributed 4,000 sales brochures to households in her territory at a cost of USD 800.
The brochures stressed that people would want to take off the extra pounds gained during the holiday season; also, these exercisers were inexpensive and could be used at home.)
At the end of the year, both had to determine their net incomes.
Green received a B in the accounting course she took at State University.
She remembered the FIFO inventory method and plans to use it.
Lewis knows nothing about inventory costing methods.

8.8.7 Answers to self-test 8.8.7.1 True-false False.
Overstated ending inventory results in an understatement of cost of goods sold and an overstatement of gross margin and net income.
True.
The cost of goods sold consists of the earliest purchases at the lowest costs in a period of rising prices.
False.
Under LCM, inventory is adjusted to market value only when the market (replacement) value is less than the cost.
True.
The first step in the gross margin method is to estimate gross margin using the gross margin rate experienced in the past.
p. 424 of 433 True.
The cost/retail ratio is computed by dividing the cost of goods available for sale by the retail price of the goods available for sale.
False.
Under perpetual procedure, the Cost of Goods Sold account is updated as sales occur.
8.8.7.2 Multiple-choice b.
The cost of ending inventory using FIFO consists of the most recent purchase: Costof endinginventory=3,400×USD36=USD122,400 c. The cost of goods sold using FIFO is: Costof goodsavailableforsale=(3,000×USD30)+(5,000×USD36)=USD270,000 Costof goodssold=USD270,000–USD122,400=USD147,600 a.
The cost of ending inventory using LIFO is: (3,000×USD30)+(400×USD36)=USD104,400 d. The cost of goods sold using LIFO is: USD270,000–USD104,400=USD165,600 a.
The cost of ending inventory using weighted-average cost is computed: Unitcost=USD270,000−8,000=USD33.75 Costof endinginventory=3,400XUSD33.75=USD114,750 c. The cost of goods sold using weighted-average cost is: USD270,000–USD114,750=USD155,250 b.
During a period of rising prices, FIFO results in the lowest cost of goods sold, thus the highest net income.
