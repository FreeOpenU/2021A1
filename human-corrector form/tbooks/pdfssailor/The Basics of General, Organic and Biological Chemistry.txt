Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1  Preface This textbook is intended for the one-semester GOB course.
Although a two-semester GOB sequence is available at many colleges and universities, one-semester GOB offerings are increasing in popularity.
The need to cover so many topics in one semester or quarter places additional pressure on the tools used to teach the course, and the authors feel that a textbook developed explicitly for the one-semester course will provide students with a superior educational experience.
Many one-semester GOB courses employ either a rewritten, watered-down two-semester textbook or a bona fide two- semester textbook with cherry-picked topics.
In the opinion of this author team, neither choice provides students with the best learning experience.
This textbook does not have a two-semester counterpart.
It was developed specifically for the one-semester GOB course.
As such, the chapters are short and succinct, covering the fundamental material and leaving out the extraneous.
We recognize that students taking this particular course are likely interested in health professions, such as nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistance, and the like.
As such, we have focused certain examples and textbook features on these areas so students realize from the beginning how these basic chemistry topics apply to their career choice.
This textbook is divided into approximately one-half general chemistry topics, one- fourth organic chemistry topics, and one-fourth biochemistry topics.
We feel that these fractions provide the appropriate mix of chemistry topics for most students’ needs.
The presentation is standard: there is no attempt to integrate organic and biological chemistry throughout a general chemistry textbook, although there is an early introduction to organic chemistry so that carbon-containing compounds can be included as soon as possible.
The first chapter stands out a bit for covering a relatively large amount of material, but that is necessary.
There is a certain skill set that students must have to be successful in any GOB course, and rather than relegate these skills to an appendix that is too often overlooked, the first chapter covers them explicitly.
Some of these topics can be omitted at the instructor’s discretion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 2  The G part of the textbook then continues into atoms and molecules, chemical reactions, simple stoichiometry, energy, the phases of matter, solutions, and acids and bases (including a short treatment of equilibrium) and then ends with nuclear chemistry.
The O part of the textbook starts with hydrocarbons and quickly covers aromatic compounds and the basic functional groups, focusing on those functional groups that have specific applications in biochemistry.
The B part starts by immediately applying the organic knowledge to carbohydrates and other biologically important compounds.
This section ends with a chapter on metabolism, which is, after all, the ultimate goal for a textbook like this—a discussion of the chemistry of life.
Each chapter is filled with example problems that illustrate the concepts at hand.
In the mathematical exercises, a consistent style of problem solving has been used.
We understand that there may be more than one way to solve a mathematical problem, but having a consistent problem-solving style increases the chance for student comprehension.
Particular emphasis is placed on the units of quantities and how they have to work out appropriately in algebraic treatments.
For each example problem, there is a Skill-Building Exercise immediately following that will help students practice the very same concept but without an elaborate answer worked out.
Every section of each chapter starts with one or more Learning Objectives that preview the section.
These Learning Objectives are echoed at the end of each section with Key Takeaways as well as Concept Review Exercises that ask about the main ideas of the section.
Sections then end with a set of exercises that students can use to immediately put the knowledge of that section into practice.
Most of the exercises are paired, so that students can work two similar exercises for additional practice.
Finally, Additional Exercises at the end of each chapter ask more challenging questions, bring multiple concepts together into a single exercise, or extend the chapter concepts to broader perspectives.
The complete exercise portfolio of the textbook—Skill-Building Exercises, Concept Review Exercises, end-of-section exercises, and Additional Exercises—provides multiple opportunities for students to practice the content.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 3  Other features in the textbook include Looking Closer, a chance to expand on a topic more than a typical textbook would.
We have selected topics that are relevant and should appeal to students at this level.
There are essays titled To Your Health that focus on how some of the topics relate directly to health issues—the focus of most of the students in this course.
Do students realize that the simple act of breathing, something most of us do without thinking, is a gas law in action?
Most chapters also have a Career Focus that presents an occupation related to the health professions.
Students at this level may not know exactly what they want to do in the health professions, so having these essays gives some information about the career possibilities awaiting them.
These features are kept to a minimum, however; this is a one-semester textbook covering general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry.
We recognize that users appreciate features like this, but we also recognize the need to focus on the core chemistry content.
We hope we have reached an appropriate balance with the amount of additional features.
We hope that this textbook meets your and your students’ goals.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 4  Chapter 1 Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement Opening Essay In April 2003, the US Pharmacopeia, a national organization that establishes quality standards for medications, reported a case in which a physician ordered “morphine [a powerful painkiller] 2–3 mg IV [intravenously] every 2–3 hours for pain.” A nurse misread the dose as “23 mg” and thus administered approximately 10 times the proper amount to an 8-year-old boy with a broken leg.
The boy stopped breathing but was successfully resuscitated and left the hospital three days later.
Quantities and measurements are as important in our everyday lives as they are in medicine.
The posted speed limits on roads and highways, such as 55 miles per hour (mph), are quantities we might encounter all the time.
Both parts of a quantity, the amount (55) and the unit (mph), must be properly communicated to prevent potential problems.
In chemistry, as in any technical endeavor, the proper expression of quantities is a necessary fundamental skill.
As we begin our journey into chemistry, we will learn this skill so that errors—from homework mistakes to traffic tickets to more serious consequences—can be avoided.
The study of chemistry will open your eyes to a fascinating world.
Chemical processes are continuously at work all around us.
They happen as you cook and eat food, strike a match, shampoo your hair, and even read this page.
Chemistry is called the central science because a knowledge of chemical principles is essential for other sciences.
You might be surprised at the extent to which chemistry pervades your life.
1.1 What Is Chemistry?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define chemistry in relation to other sciences.
2.
Identify the general steps in the scientific method.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 5  Chemistry is the study of matter—what it consists of, what its properties are, and how it changes.
Being able to describe the ingredients in a cake and how they change when the cake is baked is called chemistry.
Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space—that is, anything that is physically real.
Some things are easily identified as matter—this book, for example.
Others are not so obvious.
Because we move so easily through air, we sometimes forget that it, too, is matter.
Chemistry is one branch of science.
Science is the process by which we learn about the natural universe by observing, testing, and then generating models that explain our observations.
Because the physical universe is so vast, there are many different branches of science (Figure 1.1 "The Relationships between Some of the Major Branches of Science").
Thus, chemistry is the study of matter, biology is the study of living things, and geology is the study of rocks and the earth.
Mathematics is the language of science, and we will use it to communicate some of the ideas of chemistry.
Although we divide science into different fields, there is much overlap among them.
For example, some biologists and chemists work in both fields so much that their work is called biochemistry.
Similarly, geology and chemistry overlap in the field called geochemistry.
Figure 1.1 "The Relationships between Some of the Major Branches of Science" shows how many of the individual fields of science are related.
Figure 1.1 The Relationships between Some of the Major Branches of Science Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 6  Chemistry lies more or less in the middle, which emphasizes its importance to many branches of science.
Note There are many other fields of science, in addition to the ones (biology, medicine, etc.)
listed here.
Looking Closer: Alchemy As our understanding of the universe has changed over time, so has the practice of science.
Chemistry in its modern form, based on principles that we consider valid today, was developed in the 1600s and 1700s.
Before that, the study of matter was known as alchemy and was practiced mainly in China, Arabia, Egypt, and Europe.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 7  Alchemy was a somewhat mystical and secretive approach to learning how to manipulate matter.
Practitioners, called alchemists, thought that all matter was composed of different proportions of the four basic elements—fire, water, earth, and air—and believed that if you changed the relative proportions of these elements in a substance, you could change the substance.
The long-standing attempts to “transmute” common metals into gold represented one goal of alchemy.
Alchemy’s other major goal was to synthesize the philosopher’s stone, a material that could impart long life—even immortality.
Alchemists used symbols to represent substances, some of which are shown in the accompanying figure.
This was not done to better communicate ideas, as chemists do today, but to maintain the secrecy of alchemical knowledge, keeping others from sharing in it.
In spite of this secrecy, in its time alchemy was respected as a serious, scholarly endeavor.
Isaac Newton, the great mathematician and physicist, was also an alchemist.
EXAMPLE 1 Which fields of study are branches of science?
Explain.
1. sculpture 2. astronomy Solution 1.
Sculpture is not considered a science because it is not a study of some aspect of the natural universe.
2.
Astronomy is the study of stars and planets, which are part of the natural universe.
Astronomy is therefore a field of science.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 8  Which fields of study are branches of science?
1. politics 2. physiology (the study of the function of an animal’s or a plant’s body) 3. geophysics 4. agriculture How do scientists work?
Generally, they follow a process called the scientific method.
The scientific method is an organized procedure for learning answers to questions.
To find the answer to a question (for example, “Why do birds fly toward Earth’s equator during the cold months?”), a scientist goes through the following steps, which are also illustrated in Figure 1.2 "The General Steps of the Scientific Method": Figure 1.2 The General Steps of the Scientific Method Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 9  The steps may not be as clear-cut in real life as described here, but most scientific work follows this general outline.
1.
Propose a hypothesis.
A scientist generates a testable idea, or hypothesis, to try to answer a question or explain how the natural universe works.
Some people use the word theory in place of hypothesis, but the word hypothesis is the proper word in science.
For scientific applications, the word theory is a general statement that describes a large set of observations and data.
A theory represents the highest level of scientific understanding.
2.
Test the hypothesis.
A scientist evaluates the hypothesis by devising and carrying out experiments to test it.
If the hypothesis passes the test, it may be a proper answer to the question.
If the hypothesis does not pass the test, it may not be a good answer.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 10  3.
Refine the hypothesis if necessary.
Depending on the results of experiments, a scientist may want to modify the hypothesis and then test it again.
Sometimes the results show the original hypothesis to be completely wrong, in which case a scientist will have to devise a new hypothesis.
Not all scientific investigations are simple enough to be separated into these three discrete steps.
But these steps represent the general method by which scientists learn about our natural universe.

1.2 The Classification of Matter LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Use physical and chemical properties, including phase, to describe matter.
2.
Identify a sample of matter as an element, a compound, or a mixture.
Part of understanding matter is being able to describe it.
One way chemists describe matter is to assign different kinds of properties to different categories.
Physical and Chemical Properties Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 14  The properties that chemists use to describe matter fall into two general categories.
Physical properties are characteristics that describe matter.
They include characteristics such as size, shape, color, and mass.
Chemical properties are characteristics that describe how matter changes its chemical structure or composition.
An example of a chemical property is flammability—a material’s ability to burn—because burning (also known as combustion) changes the chemical composition of a material.
Elements and Compounds Any sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout the sample is called a substance.
There are two types of substances.
A substance that cannot be broken down into chemically simpler components is an element.
Aluminum, which is used in soda cans, is an element.
A substance that can be broken down into chemically simpler components (because it has more than one element) is acompound (Figure 1.2 "The General Steps of the Scientific Method").
Water is a compound composed of the elements hydrogen and oxygen.
Today, there are about 118 elements in the known universe.
In contrast, scientists have identified tens of millions of different compounds to date.
Note Sometimes the word pure is added to substance, but this is not absolutely necessary.
By definition, any single substance is pure.
The smallest part of an element that maintains the identity of that element is called an atom.
Atoms are extremely tiny; to make a line 1 inch long, you would need 217 million iron atoms.
The smallest part of a compound that maintains the identity of that compound is called a molecule.
Molecules are composed of atoms that are attached together and behave as a unit.
Scientists usually work with millions and millions of atoms and molecules at a time.
When a scientist is working with large numbers of atoms or molecules at a time, the scientist is studying the macroscopic view of the universe.
However, scientists can also describe chemical events on the level of individual atoms or molecules, which is referred to as the microscopic viewpoint.
We will see examples of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 15  both macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints throughout this book (Figure 1.3 "How Many Particles Are Needed for a Period in a Sentence?").
Figure 1.3 How Many Particles Are Needed for a Period in a Sentence?
Although we do not notice it from a macroscopic perspective, matter is composed of microscopic particles so tiny that billions of them are needed to make a speck we can see with the naked eye.
The ×25 and ×400,000,000 indicate the number of times the image is magnified.
Mixtures A material composed of two or more substances is a mixture.
In a mixture, the individual substances maintain their chemical identities.
Many mixtures are obvious combinations of two or more substances, such as a mixture of sand and water.
Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures.
In some mixtures, the components are so intimately combined that they act like a single substance (even though they are not).
Mixtures with a consistent composition throughout are called homogeneous mixtures (or solutions).
Sugar dissolved in water is an example of a solution.
A metal alloy, such as steel, is an example of a solid solution.
Air, a mixture of mainly nitrogen and oxygen, is a gaseous solution.
EXAMPLE 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 16  How would a chemist categorize each example of matter?
1. saltwater 2. soil 3. water 4. oxygen Solution 1.
Saltwater acts as if it were a single substance even though it contains two substances—salt and water.
Saltwater is a homogeneous mixture, or a solution.
2.
Soil is composed of small pieces of a variety of materials, so it is a heterogeneous mixture.
3.
Water is a substance; more specifically, because water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, it is a compound.
4.
Oxygen, a substance, is an element.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE How would a chemist categorize each example of matter?
1. coffee 2. hydrogen 3. an egg Phases Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 17  Another way to classify matter is to describe it as a solid, a liquid, or a gas, which was done in the examples of solutions.
These three descriptions, each implying that the matter has certain physical properties, represent the three phases of matter.
A solid has a definite shape and a definite volume.
Liquids ordinarily have a definite volume but not a definite shape; they take the shape of their containers.
Gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume, and they expand to fill their containers.
We encounter matter in each phase every day; in fact, we regularly encounter water in all three phases: ice (solid), water (liquid), and steam (gas).
We know from our experience with water that substances can change from one phase to another if the conditions are right.
Typically, varying the temperature of a substance (and, less commonly, the pressure exerted on it) can cause a phase change, a physical process in which a substance goes from one phase to another (Figure 1.4 "Boiling Water").
Phase changes have particular names depending on what phases are involved, as summarized in Table 1.1 "Phase Changes".
Table 1.1 Phase Changes Change Name solid to liquid melting, fusion solid to gas sublimation liquid to gas boiling, evaporation liquid to solid solidification, freezing gas to liquid condensation gas to solid deposition Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 18  Figure 1.5 "The Classification of Matter" illustrates the relationships between the different ways matter can be classified.
Figure 1.5 The Classification of Matter Matter can be classified in a variety of ways, depending on its properties.

Express quantities properly, using a number and a unit.
A coffee maker’s instructions tell you to fill the coffeepot with 4 cups of water and use 3 scoops of coffee.
When you follow these instructions, you are measuring.
When you visit a doctor’s office, a nurse checks your temperature, height, weight, and perhaps blood pressure (Figure 1.6 "Measuring Blood Pressure").
The nurse is also measuring.
Chemists measure the properties of matter and express these measurements as quantities.
A quantity is an amount of something and consists of a number and a unit.
The number tells us how many (or how much), and the unit tells us what the scale of measurement is.
For example, when a distance is reported as “5 kilometers,” we know that the quantity has been expressed in units of kilometers and that the number of kilometers is 5.
If you ask a friend how far he or she walks from home to school, and the friend answers “12” without specifying a unit, you do not know whether your friend walks—for example, 12 miles, 12 kilometers, 12 furlongs, or 12 yards.
Both a number and a unit must be included to express a quantity properly.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 24  To understand chemistry, we need a clear understanding of the units chemists work with and the rules they follow for expressing numbers.
The next two sections examine the rules for expressing numbers.
EXAMPLE 3 Identify the number and the unit in each quantity.
1. one dozen eggs 2.
2.54 centimeters 3. a box of pencils 4.
88 meters per second Solution 1.
The number is one, and the unit is dozen eggs.
2.
The number is 2.54, and the unit is centimeter.
3.
The number 1 is implied because the quantity is only a box.
The unit is box of pencils.
4.
The number is 88, and the unit is meters per second.
Note that in this case the unit is actually a combination of two units: meters and seconds.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Identify the number and the unit in each quantity.
1.
99 bottles of soda 2.
60 miles per hour 3.
32 fluid ounces 4.
98.6 degrees Fahrenheit CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 25  What are the two necessary parts of a quantity?
ANSWER The two necessary parts are the number and the unit.
To Your Health: Dosages As we saw in the chapter-opening essay, a medicine can be more harmful than helpful if it is not taken in the proper dosage.
A dosage (or dose) is the specific amount of a medicine that is known to be therapeutic for an ailment in a patient of a certain size.
Dosages of the active ingredient in medications are usually described by units of mass, typically grams or milligrams, and generally are equated with a number of capsules or teaspoonfuls to be swallowed or injected.
(For more information about mass, see Section 1.6 "The International System of Units".)
The amount of the active ingredient in a medicine is carefully controlled so that the proper number of pills or spoonfuls contains the proper dose.
Most drugs must be taken in just the right amount.
If too little is taken, the desired effects will not occur (or will not occur fast enough for comfort); if too much is taken, there may be potential side effects that are worse than the original ailment.
Some drugs are available in multiple dosages.
For example, tablets of the medication levothyroxine sodium, a synthetic thyroid hormone for those suffering from decreased thyroid gland function, are available in 11 different doses, ranging from 25 micrograms (µg) to 300 µg.
It is a doctor’s responsibility to prescribe the correct dosage for a patient, and it is a pharmacist’s responsibility to provide the patient with the correct medicine at the dosage prescribed.
Thus, proper quantities—which are expressed using numbers and their associated units—are crucial for keeping us healthy.
KEY TAKEAWAY Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 26  Identify a quantity properly with a number and a unit.
 EXERCISES 1.
Why are both parts of a quantity important when describing it?
2.
Why are measurements an important part of any branch of science, such as chemistry?
3.
You ask a classmate how much homework your chemistry professor assigned.
Your classmate answers, “twenty.” Is that a proper answer?
Why or why not?
4.
Identify the number and the unit in each quantity.
a. five grandchildren b.
16 candles c. four score and seven years d. 40 days and 40 nights e. 12.01 grams f. 9.8 meters per second squared g. 55 miles per hour h. 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit ANSWERS 1.
The number states how much, and the unit states of what.
Without the number and the unit, a quantity cannot be properly communicated.
3.
No, it is not a proper answer; you do not know whether the professor meant homework problem number 20 or 20 homework problems.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 27  1.4 Expressing Numbers: Scientific Notation LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Express a large number or a small number in scientific notation.
The instructions for making a pot of coffee specified 3 scoops (rather than 12,000 grounds) because any measurement is expressed more efficiently with units that are appropriate in size.
In science, however, we often must deal with quantities that are extremely small or incredibly large.
For example, you may have 5,000,000,000,000 red blood cells in a liter of blood, and the diameter of an iron atom is 0.000000014 inches.
Numbers with many zeros can be cumbersome to work with, so scientists use scientific notation.
Scientific notation is a system for expressing very large or very small numbers in a compact manner.
It uses the idea that such numbers can be rewritten as a simple number multiplied by 10 raised to a certain exponent, or power.
Let us look first at large numbers.
Suppose a spacecraft is 1,500,000 miles from Mars.
The number 1,500,000 can be thought of as follows: That is, 1,500,000 is the same as 1.5 times 1 million, and 1 million is 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10, or 106 (which is read as “ten to the sixth power”).
Therefore, 1,500,000 can be rewritten as 1.5 times 106, or 1.5 × 106.
The distance of the spacecraft from Mars can therefore be expressed as 1.5 × 106 miles.
100 = 1 101 = 10 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 28  102 = 100 103 = 1,000 104 = 10,000 and so forth The convention for expressing numbers in scientific notation is to write a single nonzero first digit, a decimal point, and the rest of the digits, excluding any trailing zeros.
This figure is followed by a multiplication sign and then by 10 raised to the power necessary to reproduce the original number.
For example, although 1,500,000 can also be written as 15.
× 105 (which would be 15.
× 100,000), the convention is to have only one digit before the decimal point.
How do we know to what power 10 is raised?
The power is the number of places you have to move the decimal point to the left to make it follow the first digit, so that the number being multiplied is between 1 and 10: EXAMPLE 4 Express each number in scientific notation.
1.
67,000,000,000 2.
1,689 3.
12.6 Solution 1.
Moving the decimal point 10 places to the left gives 6.7 × 1010.
2.
The decimal point is assumed to be at the end of the number, so moving it three places to the left gives 1.689 × 103.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 29  3.
In this case, we need to move the decimal point only one place to the left, which yields 1.26 × 101.

1.005 × 102 We can also use scientific notation to express numbers whose magnitudes are less than 1.
For example, the number 0.006 can be expressed as follows: 10−1 = 1/10 10−2 = 1/100 10−3 = 1/1,000 10−4 = 1/10,000 10−5 = 1/100,000 and so forth We use a negative number as the power to indicate the number of places we have to move the decimal point to the right to follow the first nonzero digit.
This is illustrated as follows: In scientific notation, numbers with a magnitude greater than one have a positive power, while numbers with a magnitude less than one have a negative power.

1.5 Expressing Numbers: Significant Figures LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Identify the number of significant figures in a reported value.
2.
Use significant figures correctly in arithmetical operations.
Scientists have established certain conventions for communicating the degree of precision of a measurement.
Imagine, for example, that you are using a meterstick to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 36  measure the width of a table.
The centimeters (cm) are marked off, telling you how many centimeters wide the table is.
Many metersticks also have millimeters (mm) marked off, so we can measure the table to the nearest millimeter.
But most metersticks do not have any finer measurements indicated, so you cannot report the table’s width any more exactly than to the nearest millimeter.
All you can do is estimate the next decimal place in the measurement (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob-ch01_s05_f01).
Figure 1.7 Measuring an Object to the Correct Number of Digits How many digits should be reported for the length of this object?
The concept of significant figures takes this limitation into account.
The significant figures of a measured quantity are defined as all the digits known with certainty and the first uncertain, or estimated, digit.
It makes no sense to report any Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 37  digits after the first uncertain one, so it is the last digit reported in a measurement.
Zeros are used when needed to place the significant figures in their correct positions.
Thus, zeros may not be significant figures.
Note “Sig figs” is a common abbreviation for significant figures.
For example, if a table is measured and reported as being 1,357 mm wide, the number 1,357 has four significant figures.
The 1 (thousands), the 3 (hundreds), and the 5 (tens) are certain; the 7 (units) is assumed to have been estimated.
It would make no sense to report such a measurement as 1,357.0 or 1,357.00 because that would suggest the measuring instrument was able to determine the width to the nearest tenth or hundredth of a millimeter, when in fact it shows only tens of millimeters and the units have to be estimated.
On the other hand, if a measurement is reported as 150 mm, the 1 (hundreds) and the 5 (tens) are known to be significant, but how do we know whether the zero is or is not significant?
The measuring instrument could have had marks indicating every 10 mm or marks indicating every 1 mm.
Is the zero an estimate, or is the 5 an estimate and the zero a placeholder?
The rules for deciding which digits in a measurement are significant are as follows: 1.
All nonzero digits are significant.
In 1,357, all the digits are significant.
2.
Captive (or embedded) zeros, which are zeros between significant digits, are significant.
In 405, all the digits are significant.
3.
Leading zeros, which are zeros at the beginning of a decimal number less than 1, are not significant.
In 0.000458, the first four digits are leading zeros and are not significant.
The zeros serve only to put the digits 4, 5, and 8 in the correct positions.
This number has three significant figures.
4.
Trailing zeros, which are zeros at the end of a number, are significant only if the number has a decimal point.
Thus, in 1,500, the two trailing zeros are not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 38  significant because the number is written without a decimal point; the number has two significant figures.
However, in 1,500.00, all six digits are significant because the number has a decimal point.

500 Combining Numbers Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 39  It is important to be aware of significant figures when you are mathematically manipulating numbers.
For example, dividing 125 by 307 on a calculator gives 0.4071661238… to an infinite number of digits.
But do the digits in this answer have any practical meaning, especially when you are starting with numbers that have only three significant figures each?
When performing mathematical operations, there are two rules for limiting the number of significant figures in an answer—one rule is for addition and subtraction, and one rule is for multiplication and division.
For addition or subtraction, the rule is to stack all the numbers with their decimal points aligned and then limit the answer’s significant figures to the rightmost column for which all the numbers have significant figures.
Consider the following: The arrow points to the rightmost column in which all the numbers have significant figures—in this case, the tenths place.
Therefore, we will limit our final answer to the tenths place.
Is our final answer therefore 1,459.0?
No, because when we drop digits from the end of a number, we also have to round the number.
Notice that the second dropped digit, in the hundredths place, is 8.
This suggests that the answer is actually closer to 1,459.1 than it is to 1,459.0, so we need to round up to 1,459.1.
The rules in rounding are simple: If the first dropped digit is 5 or higher, round up.
If the first dropped digit is lower than 5, do not round up.
For multiplication or division, the rule is to count the number of significant figures in each number being multiplied or divided and then limit the significant figures in the answer to the lowest count.
An example is as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 40  The final answer, limited to four significant figures, is 4,094.
The first digit dropped is 1, so we do not round up.
Scientific notation provides a way of communicating significant figures without ambiguity.
You simply include all the significant figures in the leading number.
For example, the number 450 has two significant figures and would be written in scientific notation as 4.5 × 102, whereas 450.0 has four significant figures and would be written as 4.500 × 102.
In scientific notation, all significant figures are listed explicitly.
EXAMPLE 9 Write the answer for each expression using scientific notation with the appropriate number of significant figures.
1.
23.096 × 90.300 2.
125 × 9.000 3.
1,027 + 610 + 363.06 Solution 1.
The calculator answer is 2,085.5688, but we need to round it to five significant figures.
Because the first digit to be dropped (in the hundredths place) is greater than 5, we round up to 2,085.6, which in scientific notation is 2.0856 × 103.
2.
The calculator gives 1,125 as the answer, but we limit it to three significant figures and convert into scientific notation: 1.13 × 103.
3.
The calculator gives 2,000.06 as the answer, but because 610 has its farthest-right significant figure in the tens column, our answer must be limited to the tens position: 2.0 × 103.

Recognize the SI base units and explain the system of prefixes used with them.
Now that we have discussed some of the conventions for expressing numbers, let us focus on the other component of a quantity—the units.
People who live in the United States measure weight in pounds, height in feet and inches, and a car’s speed in miles per hour.
In contrast, chemistry and other branches of science use the International System of Units (also known as SI after Système Internationale d’Unités), which was established so that scientists around the world could communicate efficiently with each other.
Many countries have also adopted SI units for everyday use as well.
The United States is one of the few countries that has not.
Base SI Units Base (or basic) units, are the fundamental units of SI.
There are seven base units, which are listed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob- ch01_s06_s01_t01.
Chemistry uses five of the base units: the mole for amount, the kilogram for mass, the meter for length, the second for time, and the kelvin for temperature.
The degree Celsius (°C) is also commonly used for temperature.
The numerical relationship between kelvins and degrees Celsius is as follows: K = °C + 273 Table 1.2 The Seven Base SI Units Property Unit Abbreviation length meter m mass kilogram kg time second s amount mole mol temperature kelvin K Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 47  Property Unit Abbreviation electrical current ampere amp luminous intensity candela cd Note The United States uses the English system of units for many quantities.
Inches, feet, miles, gallons, pounds, and so forth, are all units connected with the English system of units.
The size of each base unit is defined by international convention.
For example, the kilogram is defined as the quantity of mass of a special metal cylinder kept in a vault in France (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob-ch01_s06_s01_f01).
The other base units have similar definitions.
The sizes of the base units are not always convenient for all measurements.
For example, a meter is a rather large unit for describing the width of something as narrow as human hair.
Instead of reporting the diameter of hair as 0.00012 m or even 1.2 × 10−4 m, SI also provides a series of prefixes that can be attached to the units, creating units that are larger or smaller by powers of 10.
Common prefixes and their multiplicative factors are listed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob-ch01_s06_s01_t02.
(Perhaps you have already noticed that the base unit kilogram is a combination of a prefix, kilo- meaning 1,000 ×, and a unit of mass, the gram.)
Some prefixes create a multiple of the original unit: 1 kilogram equals 1,000 grams, and 1 megameter equals 1,000,000 meters.
Other prefixes create a fraction of the original unit.
Thus, 1 centimeter equals 1/100 of a meter, 1 millimeter equals 1/1,000 of a meter, 1 microgram equals 1/1,000,000 of a gram, and so forth.
Table 1.3 Prefixes Used with SI Units Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 48  Multiplicative Multiplicative Factor in Prefix Abbreviation Factor Scientific Notation giga- G 1,000,000,000 × 109 × mega- M 1,000,000 × 106 × kilo- k 1,000 × 103 × deca- D 10 × 101 × deci- d 1/10 × 10−1 × centi- c 1/100 × 10−2 × milli- m 1/1,000 × 10−3 × micro- µ* 1/1,000,000 × 10−6 × nano- n 1/1,000,000,000 × 10−9 × *The letter µ is the Greek lowercase letter for m and is called “mu,” which is pronounced “myoo.” Both SI units and prefixes have abbreviations, and the combination of a prefix abbreviation with a base unit abbreviation gives the abbreviation for the modified unit.
For example, kg is the abbreviation for kilogram.
We will be using these abbreviations throughout this book.
Derived SI Units Derived units are combinations of SI base units.
Units can be multiplied and divided, just as numbers can be multiplied and divided.
For example, the area of a square having a side of 2 cm is 2 cm × 2 cm, or 4 cm2 (read as “four centimeters squared” or “four Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 49  square centimeters”).
Notice that we have squared a length unit, the centimeter, to get a derived unit for area, the square centimeter.
Volume is an important quantity that uses a derived unit.
Volume is the amount of space that a given substance occupies and is defined geometrically as length × width × height.
Each distance can be expressed using the meter unit, so volume has the derived unit m × m × m, or m3 (read as “meters cubed” or “cubic meters”).
A cubic meter is a rather large volume, so scientists typically express volumes in terms of 1/1,000 of a cubic meter.
This unit has its own name—the liter (L).
A liter is a little larger than 1 US quart in volume.
(http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob- ch01_s06_s02_t01 gives approximate equivalents for some of the units used in chemistry.)
As shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob- ch01_s06_s02_f01, a liter is also 1,000 cm3.
By definition, there are 1,000 mL in 1 L, so 1 milliliter and 1 cubic centimeter represent the same volume.
1 mL = 1 cm3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 50  Figure 1.9 The Liter A liter is defined as a cube 10 cm (1/10th of a meter) on a side.
A milliliter, 1/1,000th of a liter, is equal to 1 cubic centimeter.
Table 1.4 Approximate Equivalents to Some SI Units 1 m ≈ 39.36 in.
≈ 3.28 ft ≈ 1.09 yd 1 cm ≈ 2.54 in.
1 km ≈ 0.62 mi 1 kg ≈ 2.20 lb 1 lb ≈ 454 g 1 L ≈ 1.06 qt Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 51  1 qt ≈ 0.946 L Energy, another important quantity in chemistry, is the ability to perform work, such as moving a box of books from one side of a room to the other side.
It has a derived unit of kg·m2/s2.
(The dot between the kg and m units implies the units are multiplied together.)
Because this combination is cumbersome, this collection of units is redefined as a joule (J).
An older unit of energy, the calorie (cal), is also widely used.
There are 4.184 J in 1 cal.
All chemical processes occur with a simultaneous change in energy.
(For more information on energy changes, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547?e=gob-chab - gob-ch07.)
To Your Health: Energy and Food The food in our diet provides the energy our bodies need to function properly.
The energy contained in food could be expressed in joules or calories, which are the conventional units for energy, but the food industry prefers to use the kilocalorie and refers to it as the Calorie (with a capital C).
The average daily energy requirement of an adult is about 2,000–2,500 Calories, which is 2,000,000–2,500,000 calories (with a lowercase c).
If we expend the same amount of energy that our food provides, our body weight remains stable.
If we ingest more Calories from food than we expend, however, our bodies store the extra energy in high-energy-density compounds, such as fat, and we gain weight.
On the other hand, if we expend more energy than we ingest, we lose weight.
Other factors affect our weight as well—genetic, metabolic, behavioral, environmental, cultural factors—but dietary habits are among the most important.
In 2008 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report stating that 73% of Americans were either overweight or obese.
More alarmingly, the report also noted that 19% of children aged 6–11 and 18% of adolescents aged 12–19 were overweight—numbers that had tripled over the preceding two decades.
Two major reasons for this increase are excessive calorie consumption (especially in the form of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 52  high-fat foods) and reduced physical activity.
Partly because of that report, many restaurants and food companies are working to reduce the amounts of fat in foods and provide consumers with more healthy food options.
Density is defined as the mass of an object divided by its volume; it describes the amount of matter contained in a given amount of space.
Thus, the units of density are the units of mass divided by the units of volume: g/cm3 or g/mL (for solids and liquids), g/L (for gases), kg/m3, and so forth.
For example, the density of water is about 1.00 g/cm3, while the density of mercury is 13.6 g/mL.
(Remember that 1 mL equals 1 cm3.)
Mercury is over 13 times as dense as water, meaning that it contains over 13 times the amount of matter in the same amount of space.
The density of air at room temperature is about 1.3 g/L.
EXAMPLE 10 Give the abbreviation for each unit and define the abbreviation in terms of the base unit.
1. kiloliter 2. microsecond 3. decimeter 4. nanogram Solution 1.
The abbreviation for a kiloliter is kL.
Because kilo means “1,000 ×,” 1 kL equals 1,000 L. 2.
The abbreviation for microsecond is µs.
Micro implies 1/1,000,000th of a unit, so 1 µs equals 0.000001 s. 3.
The abbreviation for decimeter is dm.
Deci means 1/10th, so 1 dm equals 0.1 m. 4.
The abbreviation for nanogram is ng and equals 0.000000001 g. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 53  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Give the abbreviation for each unit and define the abbreviation in terms of the base unit.

Convert a value reported in one unit to a corresponding value in a different unit.
The ability to convert from one unit to another is an important skill.
For example, a nurse with 50 mg aspirin tablets who must administer 0.2 g of aspirin to a patient needs to know that 0.2 g equals 200 mg, so 4 tablets are needed.
Fortunately, there is a simple way to convert from one unit to another.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 57  Conversion Factors If you learned the SI units and prefixes described in Section 1.6 "The International System of Units", then you know that 1 cm is 1/100th of a meter.
or 100 cm = 1 m Suppose we divide both sides of the equation by 1 m (both the number and the unit): As long as we perform the same operation on both sides of the equals sign, the expression remains an equality.
Look at the right side of the equation; it now has the same quantity in the numerator (the top) as it has in the denominator (the bottom).
Any fraction that has the same quantity in the numerator and the denominator has a value of 1: We know that 100 cm is 1 m, so we have the same quantity on the top and the bottom of our fraction, although it is expressed in different units.
A fraction that has equivalent quantities in the numerator and the denominator but expressed in different units is called a conversion factor.
Here is a simple example.
How many centimeters are there in 3.55 m?
Perhaps you can determine the answer in your head.
If there are 100 cm in every meter, then 3.55 m equals 355 cm.
To solve the problem more formally with a conversion factor, we first write the quantity we are given, 3.55 m. Then we multiply this quantity by a conversion factor, which is the same as multiplying it by 1.
We can write 1 as and multiply: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 58  The 3.55 m can be thought of as a fraction with a 1 in the denominator.
Because m, the abbreviation for meters, occurs in both the numerator and the denominator of our expression, they cancel out: The final step is to perform the calculation that remains once the units have been canceled: In the final answer, we omit the 1 in the denominator.
Thus, by a more formal procedure, we find that 3.55 m equals 355 cm.
A generalized description of this process is as follows: quantity (in old units) × conversion factor = quantity (in new units) You may be wondering why we use a seemingly complicated procedure for a straightforward conversion.
In later studies, the conversion problems you will encounter will not always be so simple.
If you can master the technique of applying conversion factors, you will be able to solve a large variety of problems.
In the previous example, we used the fraction as a conversion factor.
Does the conversion factor also equal 1?
Yes, it does; it has the same quantity in the numerator as in the denominator (except that they are expressed in different units).
Why did we not use that conversion factor?
If we had used the second conversion factor, the original unit would not have canceled, and the result would have been meaningless.
Here is what we would have gotten: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 59  For the answer to be meaningful, we have to construct the conversion factor in a form that causes the original unit to cancel out.
Figure 1.10 "A Concept Map for Conversions" shows a concept map for constructing a proper conversion.
The steps for doing a unit conversion problem are summarized in the margin.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 60  Figure 1.10 A Concept Map for Conversions This is how you construct a conversion factor to convert from one unit to another.
Significant Figures in Conversions How do conversion factors affect the determination of significant figures?
Numbers in conversion factors based on prefix changes, such as kilograms to grams, are not considered in the determination of significant figures in a calculation because the numbers in such conversion factors are exact.
Exact numbers are defined or counted numbers, not measured numbers, and can be considered as having an infinite number of significant figures.
(In other words, 1 kg is exactly 1,000 g, by the definition of kilo-.)
Counted numbers are also exact.
If there are 16 students in a classroom, the number 16 is exact.
In contrast, conversion factors that come from measurements (such as density, as we will see shortly) or are approximations have a limited number of significant figures and should be considered in determining the significant figures of the final answer.
EXAMPLE 12 1.
The average volume of blood in an adult male is 4.7 L. What is this volume in milliliters?
2.
A hummingbird can flap its wings once in 18 ms. How many seconds are in 18 ms?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 61  Solution 1.
We start with what we are given, 4.7 L. We want to change the unit from liters to milliliters.
There are 1,000 mL in 1 L. From this relationship, we can construct two conversion factors: We use the conversion factor that will cancel out the original unit, liters, and introduce the unit we are converting to, which is milliliters.
The conversion factor that does this is the one on the right.
Because the numbers in the conversion factor are exact, we do not consider them when determining the number of significant figures in the final answer.
Thus, we report two significant figures in the final answer.
2.
We can construct two conversion factors from the relationships between milliseconds and seconds: To convert 18 ms to seconds, we choose the conversion factor that will cancel out milliseconds and introduce seconds.
The conversion factor on the right is the appropriate one.
We set up the conversion as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 62  The conversion factor’s numerical values do not affect our determination of the number of significant figures in the final answer.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Perform each conversion.
1.
101,000 ns to seconds 2.
32.08 kg to grams Conversion factors can also be constructed for converting between different kinds of units.
For example, density can be used to convert between the mass and the volume of a substance.
Consider mercury, which is a liquid at room temperature and has a density of 13.6 g/mL.
The density tells us that 13.6 g of mercury have a volume of 1 mL.
We can write that relationship as follows: 13.6 g mercury = 1 mL mercury This relationship can be used to construct two conversion factors: Which one do we use?
It depends, as usual, on the units we need to cancel and introduce.
For example, suppose we want to know the mass of 16 mL of mercury.
We would use the conversion factor that has milliliters on the bottom (so that the milliliter unit cancels) and grams on top so that our final answer has a unit of mass: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 63  In the last step, we limit our final answer to two significant figures because the volume quantity has only two significant figures; the 1 in the volume unit is considered an exact number, so it does not affect the number of significant figures.
The other conversion factor would be useful if we were given a mass and asked to find volume, as the following example illustrates.
Note Density can be used as a conversion factor between mass and volume.
EXAMPLE 13 A mercury thermometer for measuring a patient’s temperature contains 0.750 g of mercury.
What is the volume of this mass of mercury?
Solution Because we are starting with grams, we want to use the conversion factor that has grams in the denominator.
The gram unit will cancel algebraically, and milliliters will be introduced in the numerator.
We have limited the final answer to three significant figures.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
What is the volume of 100.0 g of air if its density is 1.3 g/L?
Looking Closer: Density and the Body Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 64  The densities of many components and products of the body have a bearing on our health.
Bones.
Bone density is important because bone tissue of lower-than-normal density is mechanically weaker and susceptible to breaking.
The density of bone is, in part, related to the amount of calcium in one’s diet; people who have a diet deficient in calcium, which is an important component of bones, tend to have weaker bones.
Dietary supplements or adding dairy products to the diet seems to help strengthen bones.
As a group, women experience a decrease in bone density as they age.
It has been estimated that fully half of women over age 50 suffer from excessive bone loss, a condition known as osteoporosis.
Exact bone densities vary within the body, but for a healthy 30-year-old female, it is about 0.95–1.05 g/cm3.
Osteoporosis is diagnosed if the bone density is below 0.6–0.7 g/cm3.
Urine.
The density of urine can be affected by a variety of medical conditions.
Sufferers of diabetes insipidus produce an abnormally large volume of urine with a relatively low density.
In another form of diabetes, called diabetes mellitus, there is excess glucose dissolved in the urine, so that the density of urine is abnormally high.
The density of urine may also be abnormally high because of excess protein in the urine, which can be caused by congestive heart failure or certain renal (kidney) problems.
Thus, a urine density test can provide clues to various kinds of health problems.
The density of urine is commonly expressed as a specific gravity, which is a unitless quantity defined as .
Normal values for the specific gravity of urine range from 1.002 to 1.028.
Body Fat.
The overall density of the body is one indicator of a person’s total body fat.
Fat is less dense than muscle and other tissues, so as it accumulates, the overall density of the body decreases.
Measurements of a person’s weight and volume provide the overall body density, which can then be correlated to the percentage of body fat.
(The body’s volume can be measured by immersion in a large tank of water.
The amount of water displaced is equal to the volume of the body.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 65  Sometimes you will have to perform more than one conversion to obtain the desired unit.
For example, suppose you want to convert 54.7 km into millimeters.
You can either memorize the relationship between kilometers and millimeters, or you can do the conversion in steps.
Most people prefer to convert in steps.
To do a stepwise conversion, we first convert the given amount to the base unit.
In this example, the base unit is meters.
We know that there are 1,000 m in 1 km: Then we take the result (54,700 m) and convert it to millimeters, remembering that there are 1,000 mm for every 1 m: We have expressed the final answer in scientific notation.
As a shortcut, both steps in the conversion can be combined into a single, multistep expression: Either method—one step at a time or all the steps together—is acceptable.
If you do all the steps together, the restriction for the proper number of significant figures should be done after the last step.
As long as the math is performed correctly, you should get the same answer no matter which method you use.
EXAMPLE 14 Convert 58.2 ms to megaseconds in one multistep calculation.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 66  Solution First, convert the given unit to the base unit—in this case, seconds—and then convert seconds to the final unit, megaseconds: Neither conversion factor affects the number of significant figures in the final answer.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.

Career Focus: Pharmacist A pharmacist dispenses drugs that have been prescribed by a doctor.
Although that may sound straightforward, pharmacists in the United States must hold a doctorate in pharmacy and be licensed by the state in which they work.
Most pharmacy programs require four years of education in a specialty pharmacy school.
Pharmacists must know a lot of chemistry and biology so they can understand the effects that drugs (which are chemicals, after all) have on the body.
Pharmacists can advise physicians on the selection, dosage, interactions, and side effects of drugs.
They can also advise patients on the proper use of their medications, including when and how to take specific drugs properly.
Pharmacists can be found in drugstores, hospitals, and other medical facilities.
Curiously, an outdated name for pharmacist is chemist, which was used when pharmacists formerly did a lot of drug preparation, or compounding.
In modern times, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 67  pharmacists rarely compound their own drugs, but their knowledge of the sciences, including chemistry, helps them provide valuable services in support of everyone’s health.

Chemistry is the study of matter, which is anything that has mass and takes up space.
Chemistry is one branch of science, which is the study of the natural universe.
Like all branches of science, chemistry relies on the scientific method, which is a process of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 71  learning about the world around us.
In the scientific method, a guess or hypothesis is tested through experiment and measurement.
Matter can be described in a number of ways.
Physical properties describe characteristics of a sample that do not change the chemical identity of the material (size, shape, color, and so on), while chemical properties describe how a sample of matter changes its chemical composition.
A substance is any material that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout.
An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into chemically simpler components.
The smallest chemically identifiable piece of an element is an atom.
A substance that can be broken down into simpler chemical components is a compound.
The smallest chemically identifiable piece of a compound is a molecule.
Two or more substances combine physically to make a mixture.
If the mixture is composed of discrete regions that maintain their own identity, the mixture is a heterogeneous mixture.
If the mixture is so thoroughly mixed that the different components are evenly distributed throughout, it is a homogeneous mixture.
Another name for a homogeneous mixture is a solution.
Substances can also be described by their phase: solid, liquid, or gas.
Scientists learn about the universe by making measurements of quantities, which consist of numbers (how many) and units (of what).
The numerical portion of a quantity can be expressed using scientific notation, which is based on powers, or exponents, of 10.
Large numbers have positive powers of 10, while numbers less than 1 have negative powers of 10.
The proper reporting of a measurement requires proper use of significant figures, which are all the known digits of a measurement plus the first estimated digit.
The number of figures to report in the result of a calculation based on measured quantities depends on the numbers of significant figures in those quantities.
For addition and subtraction, the number of significant figures is determined by position; for multiplication and division, it is decided by the number of significant figures in the original measured values.
Nonsignificant digits are dropped from a final answer in accordance with the rules of rounding.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 72  Chemistry uses SI, a system of units based on seven basic units.
The most important ones for chemistry are the units for length, mass, amount, time, and temperature.
Basic units can be combined with numerical prefixes to change the size of the units.
They can also be combined with other units to make derived units, which are used to express other quantities such as volume, density, or energy.
A formal conversion from one unit to another uses a conversion factor, which is constructed from the relationship between the two units.
Numbers in conversion factors may affect the number of significant figures in a calculated quantity, depending on whether the conversion factor is exact.
Conversion factors can be applied in separate computations, or several can be used at once in a single, longer computation.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 77  Chapter 2 Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table Opening Essay The hardest material in the human body is tooth enamel.
It has to be hard so that our teeth can serve us for a lifetime of biting and chewing; however, tough as it is, tooth enamel is susceptible to chemical attack.
Acids found in some foods or made by bacteria that feed on food residues on our teeth are capable of dissolving enamel.
Unprotected by enamel, a tooth will start to decay, thus developing cavities and other dental problems.
In the early 1900s, a dentist in Colorado Springs, Colorado, noted that many people who lived in the area had brown-stained teeth that, while unsightly, were surprisingly resistant to decay.
After years of study, excess fluorine compounds in the drinking water were discovered to be the cause of both these effects.
Research continued, and in the 1930s, the US Public Health Service found that low levels of fluorine in water would provide the benefit of resisting decay without discoloring teeth.
The protective effects of fluorine have a simple chemical explanation.
Tooth enamel consists mostly of a mineral called hydroxyapatite, which is composed of calcium, phosphorus, oxygen, and hydrogen.
We know now that fluorine combines with hydroxyapatite to make fluorapatite, which is more resistant to acidic decay than hydroxyapatite is.
Currently about 50% of the US population drinks water that has some fluorine added (in the form of sodium fluoride, NaF) to reduce tooth decay.
This intentional fluoridation, coupled with the use of fluoride-containing toothpastes and improved oral hygiene, has reduced tooth decay by as much as 60% in children.
The nationwide reduction of tooth decay has been cited as an important public health advance in history.
(Another important advance was the eradication of polio.)
Just as a language has an alphabet from which words are built, chemistry has an alphabet from which matter is described.
However, the chemical alphabet is larger than the one we use for spelling.
You may have already figured out that the chemical alphabet consists of the chemical elements.
Their role is central to chemistry, for they combine to form the millions and millions of known compounds.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 78  2.1 The Elements LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define a chemical element and give examples of the abundance of different elements.
2.
Represent a chemical element with a chemical symbol.
An element, as defined in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement", is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances.
There are about 90 naturally occurring elements known on Earth.
Using technology, scientists have been able to create nearly 30 additional elements that do not occur in nature.
Today, chemistry recognizes 118 elements—some of which were created an atom at a time.
Figure 2.1 "Samples of Elements" shows some of the chemical elements.
Abundance The elements vary widely in abundance.
In the universe as a whole, the most common element is hydrogen (about 90% of atoms), followed by helium (most of the remaining 10%).
All other elements are present in relatively minuscule amounts, as far as we can detect.
On the planet Earth, however, the situation is rather different.
Oxygen makes up 46.1% of the mass of Earth’s crust (the relatively thin layer of rock forming Earth’s surface), mostly in combination with other elements, while silicon makes up 28.5%.
Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, makes up only 0.14% of Earth’s crust.Table 2.1 "Elemental Composition of Earth" lists the relative abundances of elements on Earth as a whole and in Earth’s crust.
Table 2.2 "Elemental Composition of a Human Body" lists the relative abundances of elements in the human body.
If you compare Table 2.1 "Elemental Composition of Earth" and Table 2.2 "Elemental Composition of a Human Body", you will find disparities between the percentage of each element in the human body and on Earth.
Oxygen has the highest percentage in both Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 79  cases, but carbon, the element with the second highest percentage in the body, is relatively rare on Earth and does not even appear as a separate entry in Table 2.1 "Elemental Composition of Earth"; carbon is part of the 0.174% representing “other” elements.
How does the human body concentrate so many apparently rare elements?

The relative amounts of elements in the body have less to do with their abundances on Earth than with their availability in a form we can assimilate.
We obtain oxygen from the air we breathe and the water we drink.
We also obtain hydrogen from water.
On the other hand, although carbon is present in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, and about 80% of the atmosphere is nitrogen, we obtain those two elements from the food we eat, not the air we breathe.
Looking Closer: Phosphorus, the Chemical Bottleneck There is an element that we need more of in our bodies than is proportionately present in Earth’s crust, and this element is not easily accessible.
Phosphorus makes up 1.1% of the human body but only 0.105% of Earth’s crust.
We need phosphorus for our bones and teeth, and it is a crucial component of all living cells.
Unlike carbon, which can be obtained from carbon dioxide, there is no phosphorus compound present in our surroundings that can serve as a convenient source.
Phosphorus, then, is nature’s bottleneck.
Its availability limits the amount of life our planet can sustain.
Higher forms of life, such as humans, can obtain phosphorus by selecting a proper diet (plenty of protein); but lower forms of life, such as algae, must absorb it from the environment.
When phosphorus-containing detergents were introduced in the 1950s, wastewater from normal household activities greatly increased the amount of phosphorus available to algae and other plant life.
Lakes receiving this wastewater experienced sudden increases in growth of algae.
When the algae died, concentrations of bacteria that ate the dead algae increased.
Because of the large bacterial concentrations, the oxygen content of the water dropped, causing fish to die in large numbers.
This process, calledeutrophication, is considered a negative environmental impact.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 82  Today, many detergents are made without phosphorus so the detrimental effects of eutrophication are minimized.
You may even see statements to that effect on detergent boxes.
It can be sobering to realize how much impact a single element can have on life— or the ease with which human activity can affect the environment.
Names and Symbols Each element has a name.
Some of these names date from antiquity, while others are quite new.
Today, the names for new elements are proposed by their discoverers but must be approved by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, an international organization that makes recommendations concerning all kinds of chemical terminology.
Note Today, new elements are usually named after famous scientists.
The names of the elements can be cumbersome to write in full, especially when combined to form the names of compounds.
Therefore, each element name is abbreviated as a one- or two-letter chemical symbol.
By convention, the first letter of a chemical symbol is a capital letter, while the second letter (if there is one) is a lowercase letter.
The first letter of the symbol is usually the first letter of the element’s name, while the second letter is some other letter from the name.
Some elements have symbols that derive from earlier, mostly Latin names, so the symbols may not contain any letters from the English name.
Table 2.3 "Element Names and Symbols" lists the names and symbols of some of the most familiar elements.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 84  †The symbol for tungsten comes from its German name—wolfram.
Note Element names in languages other than English are often close to their Latin names.
For example, gold is oro in Spanish and or in French (close to the Latinaurum), tin is estaño in Spanish (compare to stannum), lead is plomo in Spanish and plomb in French (compare to plumbum), silver is argent in French (compare to argentum), and iron is fer in French and hierro in Spanish (compare toferrum).
The closeness is even more apparent in pronunciation than in spelling.

2.2 Atomic Theory LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain how all matter is composed of atoms.
2.
Describe the modern atomic theory.
Take some aluminum foil.
Cut it in half.
Now you have two smaller pieces of aluminum foil.
Cut one of the pieces in half again.
Cut one of those smaller pieces in half again.
Continue cutting, making smaller and smaller pieces of aluminum foil.
It should be obvious that the pieces are still aluminum foil; they are just becoming smaller and smaller.
But how far can you take this exercise, at least in theory?
Can you continue cutting the aluminum foil into halves forever, making smaller and smaller pieces?
Or is there some limit, some absolute smallest piece of aluminum foil?
(Thought Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 91  experiments like this—and the conclusions based on them—were debated as far back as the fifth century BC.)
The modern atomic theory, proposed about 1803 by the English chemist John Dalton (Figure 2.2 "John Dalton"), is a fundamental concept that states that all elements are composed of atoms.
In Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement", we defined an atom as the smallest part of an element that maintains the identity of that element.
Individual atoms are extremely small; even the largest atom has an approximate diameter of only 5.4 × 10−10 m. With that size, it takes over 18 million of these atoms, lined up side by side, to equal the width of your little finger (about 1 cm).
Figure 2.2 John Most elements in their pure form exist as individual atoms.
Dalton For example, a macroscopic chunk of iron metal is composed, microscopically, of individual atoms.
Some elements, however, exist as groups of atoms called molecules, as discussed in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement".
Several important elements exist as two- atom combinations and are calleddiatomic molecules.
In representing a diatomic molecule, we use the symbol of the element and include the subscript 2 to indicate that two John Dalton was an atoms of that element are joined together.
The elements that English scientist who exist as diatomic molecules are hydrogen (H ), oxygen (O ), 2 2 enunciated the nitrogen (N ), fluorine (F ), chlorine (Cl ), bromine (Br ), 2 2 2 2 modern atomic theory.
and iodine (I ).
2 Looking Closer: Atomic Theory Dalton’s ideas are called the modern atomic theory because the concept of atoms is very old.
The Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus originally introduced atomic concepts in the fifth century BC.
(The word atom comes from the Greek word atomos, which means “indivisible” or “uncuttable.”) Dalton had Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 92  something that the ancient Greek philosophers didn’t have, however; he had experimental evidence, such as the formulas of simple chemicals and the behavior of gases.
In the 150 years or so before Dalton, natural philosophy had been maturing into modern science, and the scientific method was being used to study nature.
So when Dalton announced a modern atomic theory, he was proposing a fundamental theory to describe many previous observations of the natural world; he was not just participating in a philosophical discussion.

2.3 The Structure of Atoms LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 94  1.
Describe the three main subatomic particles.
2.
State how the subatomic particles are arranged in atoms.
There have been several minor but important modifications to Dalton’s atomic theory.
For one thing, Dalton considered atoms to be indivisible.
We know now that atoms not only can be divided but also are composed of three different kinds of particles with their own properties that are different from the chemical properties of atoms.
Subatomic Particles The first subatomic particle was identified in 1897 and called the electron.
It is an extremely tiny particle, with a mass of about 9.109 × 10−31 kg.
Experiments with magnetic fields showed that the electron has a negative electrical charge.
By 1920, experimental evidence indicated the existence of a second particle.
A proton has the same amount of charge as an electron, but its charge is positive, not negative.
Another major difference between a proton and an electron is mass.
Although still incredibly small, the mass of a proton is 1.673 × 10−27 kg, which is almost 2,000 times greater than the mass of an electron.
Because opposite charges attract each other (while like charges repel each other), protons attract electrons (and vice versa).
Finally, additional experiments pointed to the existence of a third particle.
Evidence produced in 1932 established the existence of the neutron, a particle with about the same mass as a proton but with no electrical charge.
We understand now that all atoms can be broken down into subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.
Table 2.4 "Properties of the Subatomic Particles" lists some of their important characteristics and the symbols used to represent each particle.
Table 2.4 Properties of the Subatomic Particles Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 95  Particle Symbol Mass (kg) Relative Mass (proton = 1) Relative Charge proton p+ 1.673 × 10−27 1 +1 neutron n0 1.675 × 10−27 1 0 electron e− 9.109 × 10−31 0.00055 −1 The Nucleus How are these subatomic particles arranged?
Between 1909 and 1911, Ernest Rutherford, a Cambridge physicist, and his associates Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden performed experiments that provided strong evidence concerning the internal structure of an atom.
They took a very thin metal foil, such as gold or platinum, and aimed a beam of positively charged particles (called alpha particles, which are combinations of two protons and two neutrons) from a radioactive source toward the foil.
Surrounding the foil was a detector—either a scintillator (a material that glows when hit by such particles) or some unexposed film (which is exposed where the particles hit it).
The detector allowed the scientists to determine the distribution of the alpha particles after they interacted with the foil.
Figure 2.3 "The Geiger-Marsden Experimental Setup" shows a diagram of the experimental setup.
Figure 2.3 The Geiger-Marsden Experimental Setup Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 96  Experiments using this setup were used to investigate the structure of atoms.
Most of the particles traveled straight through the foil, but some alpha particles were deflected off to one side.
Some were even deflected back toward the source.
This was unexpected.
Rutherford once said, “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.” Rutherford proposed the following model to explain these experimental results.
Protons and neutrons are concentrated in a central region he called the nucleus(plural, nuclei) of the atom.
Electrons are outside the nucleus and orbit about it because they are attracted to the positive charge in the nucleus.
Most of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus, while the orbiting electrons account for an atom’s size.
As a result, an atom consists largely of empty space.
Rutherford called his description the “planetary model” of the atom.
Figure 2.4 "Rutherford’s Metal-Foil Experiments"shows how this model explains the experimental results.
Figure 2.4 Rutherford’s Metal-Foil Experiments Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 97  Rutherford explained the results of the metal-foil experiments by proposing that most of the mass and the positive charge of an atom are located in its nucleus, while the relatively low-mass electrons orbit about the nucleus.
Most alpha particles go straight through the empty space, a few particles are deflected, and fewer still ricochet back toward the source.
The nucleus is much smaller proportionately than depicted here.
Note The planetary model of the atom replaced the plum pudding model, which had electrons floating around aimlessly like plums in a “pudding” of positive charge.
Rutherford’s model is essentially the same model that we use today to describe atoms but with one important modification.
The planetary model suggests that electrons occupy certain specific, circular orbits about the nucleus.
We know now that this model is overly simplistic.
A better description is that electrons form fuzzy clouds around nuclei.
Figure 2.5 "A Modern Depiction of Atomic Structure" shows a more modern version of our understanding of atomic structure.
Figure 2.5 A Modern Depiction of Atomic Structure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 98  A more modern understanding of atoms, reflected in these representations of the electron in a hydrogen atom, is that electrons occupy regions of space about the nucleus; they are not in discrete orbits like planets around the sun.
(a) The darker the color, the higher the probability that an electron will be at that point.
(b) In a two- dimensional cross section of the electron in a hydrogen atom, the more crowded the dots, the higher the probability that an electron will be at that point.
In both (a) and (b), the nucleus is in the center of the diagram.

2.4 Nuclei of Atoms LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define and differentiate between the atomic number and the mass number of an element.
2.
Explain how isotopes differ from one another.
Now that we know how atoms are generally constructed, what do atoms of any particular element look like?
How many protons, neutrons, and electrons are in a specific kind of atom?
First, if an atom is electrically neutral overall, then the number of protons equals the number of electrons.
Because these particles have the same but opposite charges, equal numbers cancel out, producing a neutral atom.
Atomic Number In the 1910s, experiments with X rays led to this useful conclusion: the magnitude of the positive charge in the nucleus of every atom of a particular element is the same.
In other words, all atoms of the same element have the same number of protons.
Furthermore, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 102  different elements have a different number of protons in their nuclei, so the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is characteristic of a particular element.
This discovery was so important to our understanding of atoms that the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called the atomic number.
For example, hydrogen has the atomic number 1; all hydrogen atoms have 1 proton in their nuclei.
Helium has the atomic number 2; all helium atoms have 2 protons in their nuclei.
There is no such thing as a hydrogen atom with 2 protons in its nucleus; a nucleus with 2 protons would be a helium atom.
The atomic number defines an element.
Chapter 21 "Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements" lists the elements and their atomic numbers.
From this table, you can determine the number of protons in the nucleus of any element.
The largest atoms have over 100 protons in their nuclei.

(Use the table in Chapter 21 "Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements".)

Therefore, every aluminum atom has 13 protons in its nucleus.
2.
Iron has an atomic number of 26.
Therefore, every iron atom has 26 protons in its nucleus.
3.
Carbon has an atomic number of 6.
Therefore, every carbon atom has 6 protons in its nucleus.

(Use the table inChapter 21 "Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements".)
1. sodium 2. oxygen 3. chlorine How many electrons are in an atom?
Previously we said that for an electrically neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, so the total opposite charges cancel.
Thus, the atomic number of an element also gives the number of electrons in an atom of that element.
(Later we will find that some elements may gain or lose electrons from their atoms, so those atoms will no longer be electrically neutral.
Thus we will need a way to differentiate the number of electrons for those elements.)
EXAMPLE 4 How many electrons are present in the atoms of each element?
1. sulfur 2. tungsten 3. argon Solution 1.
The atomic number of sulfur is 16.
Therefore, in a neutral atom of sulfur, there are 16 electrons.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 104  2.
The atomic number of tungsten is 74.
Therefore, in a neutral atom of tungsten, there are 74 electrons.
3.
The atomic number of argon is 18.
Therefore, in a neutral atom of argon, there are 18 electrons.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE How many electrons are present in the atoms of each element?
1. magnesium 2. potassium 3. iodine Isotopes How many neutrons are in atoms of a particular element?
At first it was thought that the number of neutrons in a nucleus was also characteristic of an element.
However, it was found that atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons.
Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
For example, 99% of the carbon atoms on Earth have 6 neutrons and 6 protons in their nuclei; about 1% of the carbon atoms have 7 neutrons in their nuclei.
Naturally occurring carbon on Earth, therefore, is actually a mixture of isotopes, albeit a mixture that is 99% carbon with 6 neutrons in each nucleus.
An important series of isotopes is found with hydrogen atoms.
Most hydrogen atoms have a nucleus with only a single proton.
About 1 in 10,000 hydrogen nuclei, however, also has a neutron; this particular isotope is called deuterium.
An extremely rare hydrogen isotope, tritium, has 1 proton and 2 neutrons in its nucleus.
Figure 2.6 "Isotopes of Hydrogen" compares the three isotopes of hydrogen.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 105  Figure 2.6 Isotopes of Hydrogen Most hydrogen atoms have only a proton in the nucleus (a).
A small amount of hydrogen exists as the isotope deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus (b).
A tiny amount of the hydrogen isotope tritium, with one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus, also exists on Earth (c).
The nuclei and electrons are proportionately much smaller than depicted here.
Note The discovery of isotopes required a minor change in Dalton’s atomic theory.
Dalton thought that all atoms of the same element were exactly the same.
Most elements exist as mixtures of isotopes.
In fact, there are currently over 3,500 isotopes known for all the elements.
When scientists discuss individual isotopes, they need an efficient way to specify the number of neutrons in any particular nucleus.
The mass number of an atom is the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
Given the mass number for a nucleus (and knowing the atomic number of that particular atom), you can determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number.
A simple way of indicating the mass number of a particular isotope is to list it as a superscript on the left side of an element’s symbol.
Atomic numbers are often listed as a subscript on the left side of an element’s symbol.
Thus, we might see Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 106  which indicates a particular isotope of iron.
The 26 is the atomic number (which is the same for all iron atoms), while the 56 is the mass number of the isotope.
To determine the number of neutrons in this isotope, we subtract 26 from 56: 56 − 26 = 30, so there are 30 neutrons in this atom.
EXAMPLE 5 How many protons and neutrons are in each atom?
Solution 1.
In there are 17 protons, and 35 − 17 = 18 neutrons in each nucleus.
2.
In there are 53 protons, and 127 − 53 = 74 neutrons in each nucleus.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE How many protons and neutrons are in each atom?
It is not absolutely necessary to indicate the atomic number as a subscript because each element has its own unique atomic number.
Many isotopes are indicated with a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 107  superscript only, such as 13C or 235U.
You may also see isotopes represented in print as, for example, carbon-13 or uranium-235.

Define atomic mass and atomic mass unit.
Even though atoms are very tiny pieces of matter, they have mass.
Their masses are so small, however, that chemists often use a unit other than grams to express them—the atomic mass unit.
The atomic mass unit (abbreviated u, although amu is also used) is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a 12C atom: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 113  It is equal to 1.661 × 10−24 g. Masses of other atoms are expressed with respect to the atomic mass unit.
For example, the mass of an atom of 1H is 1.008 u, the mass of an atom of 16O is 15.995 u, and the mass of an atom of 32S is 31.97 u.
Note, however, that these masses are for particular isotopes of each element.
Because most elements exist in nature as a mixture of isotopes, any sample of an element will actually be a mixture of atoms having slightly different masses (because neutrons have a significant effect on an atom’s mass).
How, then, do we describe the mass of a given element?
By calculating an average of an element’s atomic masses, weighted by the natural abundance of each isotope, we obtain a weighted average mass called the atomic mass (also commonly referred to as the atomic weight) of an element.
For example, boron exists as a mixture that is 19.9% 10B and 80.1% 11B.
The atomic mass of boron would be calculated as (0.199 × 10.0 u) + (0.801 × 11.0 u) = 10.8 u.
Similar average atomic masses can be calculated for other elements.
Carbon exists on Earth as about 99% 12C and about 1% 13C, so the weighted average mass of carbon atoms is 12.01 u.
The table in Chapter 21 "Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements" also lists the atomic masses of the elements.
EXAMPLE 6 What is the average mass of a carbon atom in grams?
Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 114  This is a simple one-step conversion, similar to conversions we did in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement".
We use the fact that 1 u = 1.661 × 10−24 g: This is an extremely small mass, which illustrates just how small individual atoms are.

The atomic mass is an average of an element’s atomic masses, weighted by the natural abundance of each isotope of that element.
It is a weighted average because different isotopes have different masses.

Describe how electrons are grouped within atoms.
Although we have discussed the general arrangement of subatomic particles in atoms, we have said little about how electrons occupy the space about the nucleus.
Do they move around the nucleus at random, or do they exist in some ordered arrangement?
The modern theory of electron behavior is called quantum mechanics.
It makes the following statements about electrons in atoms:  Electrons in atoms can have only certain specific energies.
We say that the energies of the electrons are quantized.
 Electrons are organized according to their energies into sets called shells.
Generally the higher the energy of a shell, the farther it is (on average) from the nucleus.
Shells do not have specific, fixed distances from the nucleus, but an electron in a higher-energy shell will spend more time farther from the nucleus than does an electron in a lower-energy shell.
 Shells are further divided into subsets of electrons called subshells.
The first shell has only one subshell, the second shell has two subshells, the third shell has three subshells, and so on.
The subshells of each shell are labeled, in order, with Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 117  the letters s, p, d, and f. Thus, the first shell has only an s subshell, the second shell has an s and a p subshell, the third shell has s, p, and d subshells, and so forth.
 Different subshells hold a different maximum number of electrons.
Any s subshell can hold up to 2 electrons; p, 6; d, 10; and f, 14.
It is the arrangement of electrons into shells and subshells that most concerns us here, so we will focus on that.
We use numbers to indicate which shell an electron is in.
The first shell, closest to the nucleus and with the lowest-energy electrons, is shell 1.
This first shell has only one subshell, which is labeled s and can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.
We combine the shell and subshell labels when referring to the organization of electrons about a nucleus and use a superscript to indicate how many electrons are in a subshell.
Thus, because a hydrogen atom has its single electron in the s subshell of the first shell, we use 1s1 to describe the electronic structure of hydrogen.
This structure is called an electron configuration.
Electron configurations are shorthand descriptions of the arrangements of electrons in atoms.
The electron configuration of a hydrogen atom is spoken out loud as “one-ess-one.” Helium atoms have 2 electrons.
Both electrons fit into the 1s subshell because ssubshells can hold up to 2 electrons; therefore, the electron configuration for helium atoms is 1s2 (spoken as “one-ess-two”).
The 1s subshell cannot hold 3 electrons (because an s subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons), so the electron configuration for a lithium atom cannot be 1s3.
Two of the lithium electrons can fit into the 1s subshell, but the third electron must go into the second shell.
The second shell has two subshells, s and p, which fill with electrons in that order.
The 2s subshell holds a maximum of 2 electrons, and the 2p subshell holds a maximum of 6 electrons.
Because lithium’s final electron goes into the 2s subshell, we write the electron configuration of a lithium atom as 1s22s1.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 118  The next largest atom, beryllium, has 4 electrons, so its electron configuration is 1s22s2.
Now that the 2s subshell is filled, electrons in larger atoms start filling the 2psubshell.
Thus, the electron configurations for the next six atoms are as follows: B: 1s22s22p1 C: 1s22s22p2 N: 1s22s22p3 O: 1s22s22p4 F: 1s22s22p5 Ne: 1s22s22p6 With neon, the 2p subshell is completely filled.
Because the second shell has only two subshells, atoms with more electrons now must begin the third shell.
The third shell has three subshells, labeled s, p, and d. The d subshell can hold a maximum of 10 electrons.
The first two subshells of the third shell are filled in order—for example, the electron configuration of aluminum, with 13 electrons, is 1s22s22p63s23p1.
However, a curious thing happens after the 3p subshell is filled: the 4s subshell begins to fill before the 3d subshell does.
In fact, the exact ordering of subshells becomes more complicated at this point (after argon, with its 18 electrons), so we will not consider the electron configurations of larger atoms.
A fourth subshell, the f subshell, is needed to complete the electron configurations for all elements.
An f subshell can hold up to 14 electrons.
EXAMPLE 7 What is the electron configuration of a neutral phosphorus atom?
Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 119  A neutral phosphorus atom has 15 electrons.
Two electrons can go into the 1ssubshell, 2 can go into the 2s subshell, and 6 can go into the 2p subshell.
That leaves 5 electrons.
Of those 5 electrons, 2 can go into the 3s subshell, and the remaining 3 electrons can go into the 3p subshell.
Thus, the electron configuration of neutral phosphorus atoms is 1s22s22p63s23p3.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
What is the electron configuration of a neutral chlorine atom?
Chemistry results from interactions between the outermost shells of electrons on different atoms.
Thus, it is convenient to separate electrons into two groups.
Valence shell electrons (or, more simply, the valence electrons) are the electrons in the highest-numbered shell, or valence shell, while core electrons are the electrons in lower-numbered shells.
We can see from the electron configuration of a carbon atom— 1s22s22p2—that it has 4 valence electrons (2s22p2) and 2 core electrons (1s2).
EXAMPLE 8 From the electron configuration of neutral phosphorus atoms in Example 7, how many valence electrons and how many core electrons does a neutral phosphorus atom have?
Solution The highest-numbered shell is the third shell, which has 2 electrons in the 3s subshell and 3 electrons in the 3p subshell.
That gives a total of 5 electrons, so neutral phosphorus atoms have 5 valence electrons.
The 10 remaining electrons, from the first and second shells, are core electrons.

Explain how elements are organized into the periodic table.
2.
Describe how some characteristics of elements relate to their positions on the periodic table.
In the 19th century, many previously unknown elements were discovered, and scientists noted that certain sets of elements had similar chemical properties.
For example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine react with other elements (such as sodium) to make similar compounds.
Likewise, lithium, sodium, and potassium react with other elements (such as oxygen) to make similar compounds.
Why is this so?
In 1864, Julius Lothar Meyer, a German chemist, organized the elements by atomic mass and grouped them according to their chemical properties.
Later that decade, Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, organized all the known elements according to similar properties.
He left gaps in his table for what he thought were undiscovered elements, and he made some bold predictions regarding the properties of those undiscovered elements.
When elements were later discovered whose properties closely matched Mendeleev’s predictions, his version of the table gained favor in the scientific community.
Because certain properties of the elements repeat on a regular basis throughout the table (that is, they are periodic), it became known as the periodic table.
Note Mendeleev had to list some elements out of the order of their atomic masses to group them with other elements that had similar properties.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 124  The periodic table is one of the cornerstones of chemistry because it organizes all the known elements on the basis of their chemical properties.
A modern version is shown in Figure 2.7 "A Modern Periodic Table".
Most periodic tables provide additional data (such as atomic mass) in a box that contains each element’s symbol.
The elements are listed in order of atomic number.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 125  Figure 2.7 A Modern Periodic Table A modern periodic table lists elements left to right by atomic number.
Features of the Periodic Table Elements that have similar chemical properties are grouped in columns calledgroups (or families).
As well as being numbered, some of these groups have names—for example, alkali metals (the first column of elements), alkaline earth metals (the second column of elements), halogens (the next-to-last column of elements), andnoble gases (the last column of elements).
Note The word halogen comes from the Greek for “salt maker” because these elements combine with other elements to form a group of compounds called salts.
To Your Health: Radon Radon is an invisible, odorless noble gas that is slowly released from the ground, particularly from rocks and soils whose uranium content is high.
Because it is a noble Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 126  gas, radon is not chemically reactive.
Unfortunately, it is radioactive, and increased exposure to it has been correlated with an increased lung cancer risk.
Because radon comes from the ground, we cannot avoid it entirely.
Moreover, because it is denser than air, radon tends to accumulate in basements, which if improperly ventilated can be hazardous to a building’s inhabitants.
Fortunately, specialized ventilation minimizes the amount of radon that might collect.
Special fan-and-vent systems are available that draw air from below the basement floor, before it can enter the living space, and vent it above the roof of a house.
After smoking, radon is thought to be the second-biggest preventable cause of lung cancer in the United States.
The American Cancer Society estimates that 10% of all lung cancers are related to radon exposure.
There is uncertainty regarding what levels of exposure cause cancer, as well as what the exact causal agent might be (either radon or one of its breakdown products, many of which are also radioactive and, unlike radon, not gases).
The US Environmental Protection Agency recommends testing every floor below the third floor for radon levels to guard against long-term health effects.
Each row of elements on the periodic table is called a period.
Periods have different lengths; the first period has only 2 elements (hydrogen and helium), while the second and third periods have 8 elements each.
The fourth and fifth periods have 18 elements each, and later periods are so long that a segment from each is removed and placed beneath the main body of the table.
Certain elemental properties become apparent in a survey of the periodic table as a whole.
Every element can be classified as either a metal, a nonmetal, or a semimetal, as shown in Figure 2.8 "Types of Elements".
A metal is a substance that is shiny, typically (but not always) silvery in color, and an excellent conductor of electricity and heat.
Metals are also malleable (they can be beaten into thin sheets) and ductile (they can be drawn into thin wires).
A nonmetal is typically dull and a poor conductor of electricity and heat.
Solid nonmetals are also very brittle.
As shown in Figure 2.8 "Types of Elements", metals occupy the left three-fourths of the periodic table, while nonmetals Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 127  (except for hydrogen) are clustered in the upper right-hand corner of the periodic table.
The elements with properties intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals are called semimetals (or metalloids).
Elements adjacent to the bold line in the right- hand portion of the periodic table have semimetal properties.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 128  Figure 2.8 Types of Elements Elements are either metals, nonmetals, or semimetals.
Each group is located in a different part of the periodic table.
Another way to categorize the elements of the periodic table is shown in Figure 2.9 "Special Names for Sections of the Periodic Table".
The first two columns on the left and the last six columns on the right are called the main group elements.
The ten-column block between these columns contains the transition metals.
The two rows beneath the main body of the periodic table contain the inner transition metals.
The elements in these two rows are also referred to as, respectively, the lanthanide metals and the actinide metals.
Figure 2.9 Special Names for Sections of the Periodic Table Some sections of the periodic table have special names.
The elements lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium are collectively known as alkali metals.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 129  To Your Health: Transition Metals in the Body According to Table 2.2 "Elemental Composition of a Human Body", most of the elemental composition of the human body consists of main group elements.
The first element appearing on the list that is not a main group element is iron, at 0.006 percentage by mass.
Because iron has relatively massive atoms, it would appear even lower on a list organized in terms of percent by atoms rather than percent by mass.
Iron is a transition metal.
Transition metals have interesting chemical properties, partially because some of their electrons are in d subshells.
(For more information about electron shells, see Section 2.6 "Arrangements of Electrons".)
The chemistry of iron makes it a key component in the proper functioning of red blood cells.
Red blood cells are cells that transport oxygen from the lungs to cells of the body and then transport carbon dioxide from the cells to the lungs.
Without red blood cells, animal respiration as we know it would not exist.
The critical part of the red blood cell is a protein called hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin combines with oxygen and carbon dioxide, transporting these gases from one location to another in the body.
Hemoglobin is a relatively large molecule, with a mass of about 65,000 u.
The crucial atom in the hemoglobin protein is iron.
Each hemoglobin molecule has four iron atoms, which act as binding sites for oxygen.
It is the presence of this particular transition metal in your red blood cells that allows you to use the oxygen you inhale.
Other transition metals have important functions in the body, despite being present in low amounts.
Zinc is needed for the body’s immune system to function properly, as well as for protein synthesis and tissue and cell growth.
Copper is also needed for several proteins to function properly in the body.
Manganese is needed for the body to metabolize oxygen properly.
Cobalt is a necessary component of vitamin B-12, a vital nutrient.
(For more information about proteins and vitamins, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes".)
These last three metals are not listed explicitly in Table 2.2 "Elemental Composition of a Human Body", so they are present in the body in very Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 130  small quantities.
However, even these small quantities are required for the body to function properly.
The periodic table is organized on the basis of similarities in elemental properties, but what explains these similarities?
It turns out that the shape of the periodic table reflects the filling of subshells with electrons, as shown in Figure 2.10 "The Shape of the Periodic Table".
Starting with the first period and going from left to right, the table reproduces the order of filling of the electron subshells in atoms.
Furthermore, elements in the same column share the same valence shell electron configuration.
For example, all elements in the first column have a single s electron in their valence shells, so their electron configurations can be described as ns1 (where n represents the shell number).
This last observation is crucial.
Chemistry is largely the result of interactions between the valence electrons of different atoms.
Thus, atoms that have the same valence shell electron configuration will have similar chemistry.
Figure 2.10 The Shape of the Periodic Table The shape of the periodic table reflects the order in which electron shells and subshells fill with electrons.
EXAMPLE 9 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 131  Using the variable n to represent the number of the valence electron shell, write the valence shell electron configuration for each group.
1. the alkaline earth metals 2. the column of elements headed by carbon Solution 1.
The alkaline earth metals are in the second column of the periodic table.
This column corresponds to the s subshell being filled with 2 electrons.
Therefore, the valence shell electron configuration is ns2.
2.
The electron configuration of carbon is 1s22s22p2.
Its valence shell electron configuration is 2s22p2.
Every element in the same column should have a similar valence shell electron configuration, which we can represent as ns2np2.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Using the variable n to represent the number of the valence electron shell, write the valence shell electron configuration for each group.
1. the halogens 2. the column of elements headed by oxygen Atomic Radius The periodic table is useful for understanding atomic properties that show periodic trends.
One such property is the atomic radius (Figure 2.11 "Trends on the Periodic Table").
As mentioned earlier, the higher the shell number, the farther from the nucleus the electrons in that shell are likely to be.
In other words, the size of an atom is generally determined by the number of the valence electron shell.
Therefore, as we go down a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 132  column on the periodic table, the atomic radius increases.
As we go across a period on the periodic table, however, electrons are being added to the same valence shell; meanwhile, more protons are being added to the nucleus, so the positive charge of the nucleus is increasing.
The increasing positive charge attracts the electrons more strongly, pulling them closer to the nucleus.
Consequently, as we go across a period, the atomic radius decreases.
These trends are seen clearly in Figure 2.11 "Trends on the Periodic Table".
Figure 2.11 Trends on the Periodic Table Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 133  The relative sizes of the atoms show several trends with regard to the structure of the periodic table.
Atoms become larger going down a column and smaller going across a period.
EXAMPLE 10 Using the periodic table (rather than Figure 2.11 "Trends on the Periodic Table"), which atom is larger?
1.
N or Bi 2.
Mg or Cl Solution 1.
Because Bi is below N on the periodic table and has electrons in higher-numbered shells, we expect that Bi atoms are larger than N atoms.
2.
Both Mg and Cl are in period 3 of the periodic table, but Cl lies farther to the right.
Therefore we expect Mg atoms to be larger than Cl atoms.

The Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 134  absence or presence, or abnormally low or high amounts, of a substance can be a sign of some disease or an indication of health.
Many clinical chemists use sophisticated equipment and complex chemical reactions in their work, so they not only need to understand basic chemistry, but also be familiar with special instrumentation and how to interpret test results.

An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances.
Only about 90 naturally occurring elements are known.
They have varying abundances on Earth and in the body.
Each element has a one- or two-letter chemical symbol.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 140  The modern atomic theory states that the smallest piece of an element is anatom.
Individual atoms are extremely small, on the order of 10−10 m across.
Most elements exist in pure form as individual atoms, but some exist as diatomic molecules.
Atoms themselves are composed of subatomic particles.
Theelectron is a tiny subatomic particle with a negative charge.
The proton has a positive charge and, while small, is much larger than the electron.
The neutronis also much larger than an electron but has no electrical charge.
Protons, neutrons, and electrons have a specific arrangement in an atom.
The protons and neutrons are found in the center of the atom, grouped together into anucleus.
The electrons are found in fuzzy clouds around the nucleus.
Each element has a characteristic number of protons in its nucleus.
This number of protons is the atomic number of the element.
An element may have different numbers of neutrons in the nuclei of its atoms; such atoms are referred to asisotopes.
Two isotopes of hydrogen are deuterium, with a proton and a neutron in its nucleus, and tritium, with a proton and two neutrons in its nucleus.
The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in a nucleus is called the mass numberand is used to distinguish isotopes from each other.
Masses of individual atoms are measured in atomic mass units.
An atomic mass unit is equal to 1/12th of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom.
Because different isotopes of an element have different masses, the atomic mass of an element is a weighted average of the masses of all the element’s naturally occurring isotopes.
The modern theory of electron behavior is called quantum mechanics.
According to this theory, electrons in atoms can only have specific, orquantized, energies.
Electrons are grouped into general regions called shells, and within these into more specific regions called subshells.
There are four types of subshells, and each type can hold up to a maximum number of electrons.
The distribution of electrons into shells and subshells is the electron configurationof an atom.
Chemistry typically occurs Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 141  because of interactions between the electrons of the outermost shell of different atoms, called the valence shell electrons.
Electrons in inner shells are called core electrons.
Elements are grouped together by similar chemical properties into a chart called the periodic table.
Vertical columns of elements are called groups or families.
Some of the groups of elements have names, like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals, the halogens, and the noble gases.
A horizontal row of elements is called a period.
Periods and groups have differing numbers of elements in them.
The periodic table separates elements into metals, nonmetals, andsemimetals.
The periodic table is also separated into main group elements,transition metals, lanthanide elements, and actinide elements.
The lanthanide and actinide elements are also referred to as inner transition metal elements.
The shape of the periodic table reflects the sequential filling of shells and subshells in atoms.
The periodic table helps us understand trends in some of the properties of atoms.
One such property is the atomic radius of atoms.
From top to bottom of the periodic table, atoms get bigger because electrons are occupying larger and bigger shells.
From left to right across the periodic table, electrons are filling the same shell but are being attracted by an increasing positive charge from the nucleus, and thus the atoms get smaller.

This kind of salt is used as a condiment throughout the world, but it was not always so abundant.
Two thousand years ago, Roman soldiers received part of their pay as salt, which explains why the words salt and salary come from the same Latin root (salarium).
Today, table salt is either mined or obtained from the evaporation of saltwater.
Table salt is sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a simple compound of two elements that are necessary for the human body to function properly.
Sodium, for example, is important for nerve conduction and fluid balance.
In fact, human blood is about a 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and a solution called normal saline is commonly administered intravenously in hospitals.
Although some salt in our diets is necessary to replenish the sodium and chloride ions that we excrete in urine and sweat, too much is unhealthy, and many people may be ingesting more salt than their bodies need.
The RDI of sodium is 2,400 mg—the amount in about 1 teaspoon of salt—but the average intake of sodium in the United States is between 4,000 mg and 5,000 mg, partly because salt is a common additive in many prepared foods.
Previously, the high ingestion of salt was thought to be associated with high blood pressure, but current research does not support this link.
Even so, some doctors still recommend a low-salt diet (never a “no-salt” diet) for patients with high blood pressure, which may include using a salt substitute.
Most salt substitutes use potassium instead of sodium, but some people complain that the potassium imparts a slightly bitter taste.
There are only 118 known chemical elements but tens of millions of known chemical compounds.
Compounds can be very complex combinations of atoms, but many important compounds are fairly simple.
Table salt, as we have seen, consists of only two Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 145  elements: sodium and chlorine.
Nevertheless, the compound has properties completely different from either elemental sodium (a chemically reactive metal) or elemental chlorine (a poisonous, green gas).
We will see additional examples of such differences in this chapter and Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", as we consider how atoms combine to form compounds.
3.1 Two Types of Bonding LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define the octet rule.
2.
Describe how ionic bonds are formed.
Atoms can join together by forming a chemical bond, which is a very strong attraction between two atoms.
Chemical bonds are formed when electrons in different atoms interact with each other to make an arrangement that is more stable than when the atoms are apart.
What causes atoms to make a chemical bond with other atoms, rather than remaining as individual atoms?
A clue comes by considering the noble gas elements, the rightmost column of the periodic table.
These elements—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—do not form compounds very easily, which suggests that they are especially stable as lone atoms.
What else do the noble gas elements have in common?
Except for helium, they all have eight valence electrons.
Chemists have concluded that atoms are especially stable if they have eight electrons in their outermost shell.
This useful rule of thumb is called the octet rule, and it is a key to understanding why compounds form.
Note Of the noble gases, only krypton, xenon, and radon have been found to make compounds.
There are two ways for an atom that does not have an octet of valence electrons to obtain an octet in its outer shell.
One way is the transfer of electrons between two atoms Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 146  until all atoms have octets.
Because some atoms will lose electrons and some atoms will gain electrons, there is no overall change in the number of electrons, but individual atoms acquire a nonzero electric charge.
Those that lose electrons become positively charged, and those that gain electrons become negatively charged.
Charged atoms are called ions.
Because opposite charges attract (while like charges repel), these oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming ionic bonds.
The resulting compounds are called ionic compounds and are the primary subject of this chapter.
The second way for an atom to obtain an octet of electrons is by sharing electrons with another atom.
These shared electrons simultaneously occupy the outermost shell of more than one atom.
The bond made by electron sharing is called a covalent bond.
Covalent bonding and covalent compounds will be discussed in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds".
Note Despite our focus on the octet rule, we must remember that for small atoms, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the first shell is, or becomes, the outermost shell and hold only two electrons.
Therefore, these atoms satisfy a “duet rule” rather than the octet rule.
EXAMPLE 1 A sodium atom has one valence electron.
Do you think it is more likely for a sodium atom to lose one electron or gain seven electrons to obtain an octet?
Solution Although either event is possible, a sodium atom is more likely to lose its single valence electron.
When that happens, it becomes an ion with a net positive charge.
This can be illustrated as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 147  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.

3.
It is more likely to lose two electrons.
5.
It is more likely to gain two electrons.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 149  3.2 Ions LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define the two types of ions.
2.
Use Lewis diagrams to illustrate ion formation.
Most atoms do not have eight electrons in their valence electron shell.
Some atoms have only a few electrons in their outer shell, while some atoms lack only one or two electrons to have an octet.
In cases where an atom has three or fewer valence electrons, the atom may lose those valence electrons quite easily until what remains is a lower shell that contains an octet.
Atoms that lose electrons acquire a positive charge as a result because they are left with fewer negatively charged electrons to balance the positive charges of the protons in the nucleus.
Positively charged ions are called cations.
Most metals become cations when they make ionic compounds.
Some atoms have nearly eight electrons in their valence shell and can gain additional valence electrons until they have an octet.
When these atoms gain electrons, they acquire a negative charge because they now possess more electrons than protons.
Negatively charged ions are called anions.
Most nonmetals become anions when they make ionic compounds.
Note The names for positive and negative ions are pronounced CAT-eye-ons and ANN-eye- ons, respectively.
Electron Transfer We can use electron configurations to illustrate the electron transfer process between sodium atoms and chlorine atoms.
Recall the electron configuration of sodium fromChapter 2 "Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table": Na: 1s22s22p63s1 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 150  As demonstrated in Example 1 (in Section 3.1 "Two Types of Bonding"), sodium is likely to achieve an octet in its outermost shell by losing its one valence electron.
The remaining species has the following electron configuration: The cation produced in this way, Na+, is called the sodium ion to distinguish it from the element.
The outermost shell of the sodium ion is the second electron shell, which has eight electrons in it.
The octet rule has been satisfied.
Figure 3.1 "The Formation of a Sodium Ion" is a graphical depiction of this process.
Figure 3.1 The Formation of a Sodium Ion On the left, a sodium atom has 11 electrons.
On the right, the sodium ion only has 10 electrons and a 1+ charge.
A chlorine atom has the following electron configuration: Cl: 1s22s22p63s23p5 Only one more electron is needed to achieve an octet in chlorine’s valence shell.
(In table salt, this electron comes from the sodium atom.)
The electron configuration of the new species that results is as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 151  In this case, the ion has the same outermost shell as the original atom, but now that shell has eight electrons in it.
Once again, the octet rule has been satisfied.
The resulting anion, Cl−, is called the chloride ion; note the slight change in the suffix (-ide instead of - ine) to create the name of this anion.
Figure 3.2 "The Formation of a Chlorine Ion" is a graphical depiction of this process.
Figure 3.2 The Formation of a Chlorine Ion On the left, the chlorine atom has 17 electrons.
On the right, the chloride ion has 18 electrons and has a 1− charge.
With two oppositely charged ions, there is an electrostatic attraction between them because opposite charges attract.
The resulting combination is the compound sodium chloride.
Notice that there are no leftover electrons.
The number of electrons lost by the sodium atom (one) equals the number of electrons gained by the chlorine atom (one), so the compound is electrically neutral.
In macroscopic samples of sodium chloride, there are billions and billions of sodium and chloride ions, although there is always the same number of cations and anions.
In many cases, elements that belong to the same group (vertical column) on the periodic table form ions with the same charge because they have the same number of valence electrons.
Thus, the periodic table becomes a tool for remembering the charges on many Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 152  ions.
For example, all ions made from alkali metals, the first column on the periodic table, have a 1+ charge.
Ions made from alkaline earth metals, the second group on the periodic table, have a 2+ charge.
On the other side of the periodic table, the next-to-last column, the halogens, form ions having a 1− charge.
Figure 3.3 "Predicting Ionic Charges" shows how the charge on many ions can be predicted by the location of an element on the periodic table.
Note the convention of first writing the number and then the sign on a multiply charged ion.
The barium cation is written Ba2+, not Ba+2.
Figure 3.3 Predicting Ionic Charges The charge that an atom acquires when it becomes an ion is related to the structure of the periodic table.
Within a group (family) of elements, atoms form ions of a certain charge.
Lewis Diagrams Chemists use simple diagrams to show an atom’s valence electrons and how they transfer.
These diagrams have two advantages over the electron shell diagrams introduced in Chapter 2 "Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table".
First, they show only valence electrons.
Second, instead of having a circle around the chemical symbol to represent the electron shell, they have up to eight dots around the symbol; each dot Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 153  represents a valence electron.
These dots are arranged to the right and left and above and below the symbol, with no more than two dots on a side.
For example, the representation for sodium is as follows: and the representation for chlorine is as follows: Note It does not matter what sides the dots are placed on in Lewis diagrams as long as each side has a maximum of two dots.
These diagrams are called Lewis electron dot diagrams, or simplyLewis diagrams, after Gilbert N. Lewis, the American chemist who introduced them.Figure 3.4 "Lewis Diagrams of the Elements Lithium through Neon" shows the electron configurations and Lewis diagrams of the elements lithium through neon, which is the entire second period of the periodic table.
For the main group elements, the number of valence electrons is the same as the group number listed at the top of the periodic table.
Figure 3.4 Lewis Diagrams of the Elements Lithium through Neon The transfer of electrons can be illustrated easily with Lewis diagrams: In representing the final formula, the dots are omitted.
EXAMPLE 2 Starting with lithium and bromine atoms, use Lewis diagrams to show the formation of the ionic compound LiBr.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 154  Solution From the periodic table, we see that lithium is in the same column as sodium, so it will have the same valence shell electron configuration.
That means that the neutral lithium atom will have the same Lewis diagram that the sodium atom has.
Similarly, bromine is in the same column as chlorine, so it will have the same Lewis diagram that chlorine has.
Therefore, SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Starting with magnesium and oxygen atoms, use Lewis diagrams to show the formation of the ionic compound MgO.
Some ionic compounds have different numbers of cations and anions.
In those cases, electron transfer occurs between more than one atom.
For example, here is the formation of MgBr : 2 Most of the elements that make ionic compounds form an ion that has a characteristic charge.
For example, sodium makes ionic compounds in which the sodium ion always has a 1+ charge.
Chlorine makes ionic compounds in which the chloride ion always has a 1− charge.
Some elements, especially transition metals, can form ions of multiple charges.
Figure 3.5 "Charges of the Monatomic Ions" shows the characteristic charges for some of these ions.
As we saw in Figure 3.1 "The Formation of a Sodium Ion", there is a pattern to the charges on many of the main group ions, but there is no simple pattern for transition metal ions (or for the larger main group elements).

Write the chemical formula for a simple ionic compound.
2.
Recognize polyatomic ions in chemical formulas.
We have already encountered some chemical formulas for simple ionic compounds.
A chemical formula is a concise list of the elements in a compound and the ratios of these elements.
To better understand what a chemical formula means, we must consider how an ionic compound is constructed from its ions.
Ionic compounds exist as alternating positive and negative ions in regular, three- dimensional arrays called crystals (Figure 3.6 "A Sodium Chloride Crystal").
As you can see, there are no individual NaCl “particles” in the array; instead, there is a continuous lattice of alternating sodium and chloride ions.
However, we can use the ratio of sodium ions to chloride ions, expressed in the lowest possible whole numbers, as a way of describing the compound.
In the case of sodium chloride, the ratio of sodium ions to chloride ions, expressed in lowest whole numbers, is 1:1, so we use NaCl (one Na symbol and one Cl symbol) to represent the compound.
Thus, NaCl is the chemical formula for sodium chloride, which is a concise way of describing the relative number of different ions in the compound.
A macroscopic sample is composed of myriads of NaCl pairs; each pair called a formula unit.
Although it is convenient to think that NaCl crystals are composed of individual NaCl units, Figure 3.6 "A Sodium Chloride Crystal" shows that no single ion is exclusively associated with any other single ion.
Each ion is surrounded by ions of opposite charge.
Figure 3.6 A Sodium Chloride Crystal Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 161  A crystal contains a three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions.
The precise pattern depends on the compound.
A crystal of sodium chloride, shown here, is a collection of alternating sodium and chlorine ions.
Note In Section 3.2 "Ions", we encountered LiBr and MgO, which are formulas for other ionic compounds.
The formula for an ionic compound follows several conventions.
First, the cation is written before the anion.
Because most metals form cations and most nonmetals form anions, formulas typically list the metal first and then the nonmetal.
Second, charges are Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 162  not written in a formula.
Remember that in an ionic compound, the component species are ions, not neutral atoms, even though the formula does not contain charges.
Finally, the proper formula for an ionic compound always obeys the following rule: the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge.
To determine the proper formula of any combination of ions, determine how many of each ion is needed to balance the total positive and negative charges in the compound.
Note This rule is ultimately based on the fact that matter is, overall, electrically neutral.
Note By convention, assume that there is only one atom if a subscript is not present.
We do not use 1 as a subscript.
If we look at the ionic compound consisting of lithium ions and bromide ions, we see that the lithium ion has a 1+ charge and the bromide ion has a 1− charge.
Only one ion of each is needed to balance these charges.
The formula for lithium bromide is LiBr.
When an ionic compound is formed from magnesium and oxygen, the magnesium ion has a 2+ charge, and the oxygen atom has a 2− charge.
Although both of these ions have higher charges than the ions in lithium bromide, they still balance each other in a one- to-one ratio.
Therefore, the proper formula for this ionic compound is MgO.
Now consider the ionic compound formed by magnesium and chlorine.
A magnesium ion has a 2+ charge, while a chlorine ion has a 1− charge: Mg2+ Cl− Combining one ion of each does not completely balance the positive and negative charges.
The easiest way to balance these charges is to assume the presence of twochloride ions for each magnesium ion: Mg2+ Cl− Cl− Now the positive and negative charges are balanced.
We could write the chemical formula for this ionic compound as MgClCl, but the convention is to use a numerical subscript when there is more than one ion of a given type—MgCl .
This chemical 2 formula says that there are one magnesium ion and two chloride ions in this formula.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 163  (Do not read the “Cl ” part of the formula as a molecule of the diatomic elemental 2 chlorine.
Chlorine does not exist as a diatomic element in this compound.
Rather, it exists as two individual chloride ions.)
By convention, the lowest whole number ratio is used in the formulas of ionic compounds.
The formula Mg Cl has balanced charges 2 4 with the ions in a 1:2 ratio, but it is not the lowest whole number ratio.
Note By convention, the lowest whole-number ratio of the ions is used in ionic formulas.
There are exceptions for certain ions, such as Hg 2+.
2 EXAMPLE 3 Write the chemical formula for an ionic compound composed of each pair of ions.
1. the sodium ion and the sulfur ion 2. the aluminum ion and the fluoride ion 3. the 3+ iron ion and the oxygen ion Solution 1.
To obtain a valence shell octet, sodium forms an ion with a 1+ charge, while the sulfur ion has a 2− charge.
Two sodium 1+ ions are needed to balance the 2− charge on the sulfur ion.
Rather than writing the formula as NaNaS, we shorten it by convention to Na S. 2 2.
The aluminum ion has a 3+ charge, while the fluoride ion formed by fluorine has a 1− charge.
Three fluorine 1− ions are needed to balance the 3+ charge on the aluminum ion.
This combination is written as AlF .
3 3.
Iron can form two possible ions, but the ion with a 3+ charge is specified here.
The oxygen atom has a 2− charge as an ion.
To balance the positive and negative charges, we look to the least common multiple—6: two iron 3+ ions will give 6+, while three 2− oxygen ions will give 6−, thereby balancing the overall positive and negative charges.
Thus, the formula for this ionic compound is Fe O .
2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 164  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Write the chemical formula for an ionic compound composed of each pair of ions.
1. the calcium ion and the oxygen ion 2. the 2+ copper ion and the sulfur ion 3. the 1+ copper ion and the sulfur ion Polyatomic Ions Some ions consist of groups of atoms bonded together and have an overall electric charge.
Because these ions contain more than one atom, they are calledpolyatomic ions.
Polyatomic ions have characteristic formulas, names, and charges that should be memorized.
For example, NO − is the nitrate ion; it has one nitrogen atom and three 3 oxygen atoms and an overall 1− charge.
Table 3.1 "Some Polyatomic Ions" lists the most common polyatomic ions.
Table 3.1 Some Polyatomic Ions Name Formula ammonium ion NH + 4 acetate ion C H O − (also written CH CO −) 2 3 2 3 2 carbonate ion CO 2− 3 chromate ion CrO 2− 4 dichromate ion Cr O 2− 2 7 hydrogen carbonate ion (bicarbonate ion) HCO − 3 cyanide ion CN− Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 165  Name Formula hydroxide ion OH− nitrate ion NO − 3 nitrite ion NO − 2 permanganate ion MnO − 4 phosphate ion PO 3− 4 hydrogen phosphate ion HPO 2− 4 dihydrogen phosphate ion H PO − 2 4 sulfate ion SO 2− 4 hydrogen sulfate ion (bisulfate ion) HSO − 4 sulfite ion SO 2− 3 The rule for constructing formulas for ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions is the same as for formulas containing monatomic (single-atom) ions: the positive and negative charges must balance.
If more than one of a particular polyatomic ion is needed to balance the charge, the entire formula for the polyatomic ion must be enclosed in parentheses, and the numerical subscript is placed outside the parentheses.
This is to show that the subscript applies to the entire polyatomic ion.
An example is Ba(NO ) .
3 2 EXAMPLE 4 Write the chemical formula for an ionic compound composed of each pair of ions.
1. the potassium ion and the sulfate ion 2. the calcium ion and the nitrate ion Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 166  Solution 1.
Potassium ions have a charge of 1+, while sulfate ions have a charge of 2−.
We will need two potassium ions to balance the charge on the sulfate ion, so the proper chemical formula is K SO .
2 4 2.
Calcium ions have a charge of 2+, while nitrate ions have a charge of 1−.
We will need two nitrate ions to balance the charge on each calcium ion.
The formula for nitrate must be enclosed in parentheses.
Thus, we write Ca(NO ) as the formula for this ionic 3 2 compound.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Write the chemical formula for an ionic compound composed of each pair of ions.
1. the magnesium ion and the carbonate ion 2. the aluminum ion and the acetate ion Recognizing Ionic Compounds There are two ways to recognize ionic compounds.
First, compounds between metal and nonmetal elements are usually ionic.
For example, CaBr contains a metallic element 2 (calcium, a group 2A metal) and a nonmetallic element (bromine, a group 7A nonmetal).
Therefore, it is most likely an ionic compound.
(In fact, it is ionic.)
In contrast, the compound NO contains two elements that are both nonmetals (nitrogen, from group 2 5A, and oxygen, from group 6A).
It is not an ionic compound; it belongs to the category of covalent compounds that we will study in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds".
Also note that this combination of nitrogen and oxygen has no electric charge specified, so it is not the nitrite ion.
Second, if you recognize the formula of a polyatomic ion in a compound, the compound is ionic.
For example, if you see the formula Ba(NO ) , you may recognize the “NO ” part 3 2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 167  as the nitrate ion, NO −.
(Remember that the convention for writing formulas for ionic 3 compounds is not to include the ionic charge.)
This is a clue that the other part of the formula, Ba, is actually the Ba2+ ion, with the 2+ charge balancing the overall 2− charge from the two nitrate ions.
Thus, this compound is also ionic.

SOCl 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 168  Looking Closer: Blood and Seawater Science has long recognized that blood and seawater have similar compositions.
After all, both liquids have ionic compounds dissolved in them.
The similarity may be more than mere coincidence; many scientists think that the first forms of life on Earth arose in the oceans.
A closer look, however, shows that blood and seawater are quite different.
A 0.9% solution of sodium chloride approximates the salt concentration found in blood.
In contrast, seawater is principally a 3% sodium chloride solution, over three times the concentration in blood.
Here is a comparison of the amounts of ions in blood and seawater: Most ions are more abundant in seawater than they are in blood, with some important exceptions.
There are far more hydrogen carbonate ions (HCO −) in blood than in 3 seawater.
This difference is significant because the hydrogen carbonate ion and some related ions have a crucial role in controlling the acid-base properties of blood.
(For more information on the acid-base properties of blood, see Chapter 10 "Acids and Bases", Section 10.5 "Buffers".)
The amount of hydrogen phosphate ions—HPO 2− and 4 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 169  H PO −—in seawater is very low, but they are present in higher amounts in blood, where 2 4 they also affect acid-base properties.
Another notable difference is that blood does not have significant amounts of the sulfate ion (SO 2−), but this ion is present in seawater.

Use the rules for naming ionic compounds.
After learning a few more details about the names of individual ions, you will be a step away from knowing how to name ionic compounds.
This section begins the formal study of nomenclature, the systematic naming of chemical compounds.
Naming Ions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 174  The name of a monatomic cation is simply the name of the element followed by the word ion.
Thus, Na+ is the sodium ion, Al3+ is the aluminum ion, Ca2+ is the calcium ion, and so forth.
We have seen that some elements lose different numbers of electrons, producing ions of different charges (Figure 3.3 "Predicting Ionic Charges").
Iron, for example, can form two cations, each of which, when combined with the same anion, makes a different compound with unique physical and chemical properties.
Thus, we need a different name for each iron ion to distinguish Fe2+ from Fe3+.
The same issue arises for other ions with more than one possible charge.
There are two ways to make this distinction.
In the simpler, more modern approach, called the Stock system, an ion’s positive charge is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses after the element name, followed by the word ion.
Thus, Fe2+ is called the iron(II) ion, while Fe3+ is called the iron(III) ion.
This system is used only for elements that form more than one common positive ion.
We do not call the Na+ ion the sodium(I) ion because (I) is unnecessary.
Sodium forms only a 1+ ion, so there is no ambiguity about the name sodium ion.
The second system, called the common system, is not conventional but is still prevalent and used in the health sciences.
This system recognizes that many metals have two common cations.
The common system uses two suffixes (-ic and -ous) that are appended to the stem of the element name.
The -ic suffix represents the greater of the two cation charges, and the -ous suffix represents the lower one.
In many cases, the stem of the element name comes from the Latin name of the element.
Table 3.2 "The Common System of Cation Names" lists the elements that use the common system, along with their respective cation names.
Table 3.2 The Common System of Cation Names Element Stem Charge Name iron ferr- 2+ ferrous ion Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 175  Element Stem Charge Name 3+ ferric ion 1+ cuprous ion copper cupr- 2+ cupric ion 2+ stannous ion tin stann- 4+ stannic ion 2+ plumbous ion lead plumb- 4+ plumbic ion 2+ chromous ion chromium chrom- 3+ chromic ion 1+ aurous ion gold aur- 3+ auric ion The name of a monatomic anion consists of the stem of the element name, the suffix - ide, and then the word ion.
Thus, as we have already seen, Cl− is “chlor-” + “-ide ion,” or the chloride ion.
Similarly, O2− is the oxide ion, Se2− is the selenide ion, and so forth.
Table 3.3 "Some Monatomic Anions" lists the names of some common monatomic ions.
Table 3.3 Some Monatomic Anions Ion Name F− fluoride ion Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 176  Ion Name Cl− chloride ion Br− bromide ion I− iodide ion O2− oxide ion S2− sulfide ion P3− phosphide ion N3− nitride ion The polyatomic ions have their own characteristic names, as we saw in Table 3.1 "Some Polyatomic Ions".

1. the fluoride ion 2. the carbonate ion 3. the stannous ion 4. the potassium ion Naming Compounds Now that we know how to name ions, we are ready to name ionic compounds.
We do so by placing the name of the cation first, followed by the name of the anion, and dropping the word ion from both parts.
For example, what is the name of the compound whose formula is Ba(NO ) ?
3 2 The compound’s name does not indicate that there are two nitrate ions for every barium ion.
You must determine the relative numbers of ions by balancing the positive and negative charges.
If you are given a formula for an ionic compound whose cation can have more than one possible charge, you must first determine the charge on the cation before identifying its correct name.
For example, consider FeCl and FeCl .
In the first compound, the iron ion 2 3 has a 2+ charge because there are two Cl− ions in the formula (1− charge on each Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 179  chloride ion).
In the second compound, the iron ion has a 3+ charge, as indicated by the three Cl− ions in the formula.
These are two different compounds that need two different names.
By the Stock system, the names are iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride.
If we were to use the stems and suffixes of the common system, the names would be ferrous chloride and ferric chloride, respectively.

Determine the formula mass of an ionic compound.
One skill needed in future chapters is the ability to determine the mass of the formula of an ionic compound.
This quantity is called the formula mass.
The formula mass is obtained by adding the masses of each individual atom in the formula of the compound.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 185  Because a proper formula is electrically neutral (with no net electrons gained or lost), the ions can be considered atoms for the purpose of calculating the formula mass.
Let us start by calculating the formula mass of sodium chloride (NaCl).
This formula mass is the sum of the atomic masses of one sodium atom and one chlorine atom, which we find from the periodic table; here, we use the masses to two decimal places: Na: 22.99 u Cl: + 35.45 u Total: 58.44 u To two decimal places, the formula mass of NaCl is 58.44 u.
When an ionic compound has more than one anion or cation, you must remember to use the proper multiple of the atomic mass for the element in question.
For the formula mass of calcium fluoride (CaF ), we must multiply the mass of the fluorine atom by 2 to 2 account for the two fluorine atoms in the chemical formula: Ca: 1 × 40.08 40.08 u F: 2 × 19.00 = + 38.00 u Total: 78.08 u The formula mass of CaF is 78.08 u.
2 For ionic compounds with polyatomic ions, the sum must include the number and mass of each atom in the formula for the polyatomic ion.
For example, potassium nitrate (KNO ) has one potassium atom, one nitrogen atom, and three oxygen atoms: 3 K: 1 × 39.10 39.10 u N: 1 × 14.00 + 14.00 u O: 3 × 16.00 = + 48.00 u Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 186  Total: 101.10 u The formula mass of KNO is 101.10 u.
3 Note Potassium nitrate is a key ingredient in gunpowder and has been used clinically as a diuretic.
When a formula contains more than one polyatomic unit in the chemical formula, as in Ca(NO ) , don’t forget to multiply the atomic mass of every atom inside the parentheses 3 2 by the subscript outside the parentheses.
This is necessary because the subscript refers to the entire polyatomic ion.
Thus, for Ca(NO ) , the subscript 2 implies two complete 3 2 nitrate ions, so we must sum the masses of two (1 × 2) nitrogen atoms and six (3 × 2) oxygen atoms, along with the mass of a single calcium atom: Ca: 1 × 40.08 40.08 u N: 2 × 14.00 = + 28.00 u O: 6 × 16.00 = + 96.00 u Total: 164.08 u The key to calculating the formula mass of an ionic compound is to correctly count each atom in the formula and multiply the atomic masses of its atoms accordingly.
EXAMPLE 9 Use the atomic masses (rounded to two decimal places) from the inside cover of this book to determine the formula mass for each ionic compound.

FeCl 3 2.
(NH ) PO 4 3 4 Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 187  1.
The formula mass of FeCl is 162.20 u.
3 2.
When we distribute the subscript 3 through the parentheses containing the formula for the ammonium ion, we see that we have 3 nitrogen atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms.
Thus, we set up the sum as follows: The formula mass for (NH ) PO is 148.97 u.

These 2 compounds, called hydrates, have a characteristic number of water units associated with each formula unit of the compound.
Hydrates are solids, not liquids or solutions, despite the water they contain.
To write the chemical formula of a hydrate, write the number of water units per formula unit of compound after its chemical formula.
The two chemical formulas are separated by a vertically centered dot.
The hydrate of copper(II) sulfate has five water units associated with each formula unit, so it is written as CuSO ·5H O.
The name of this 4 2 compound is copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, with the penta-prefix indicating the presence of five water units per formula unit of copper(II) sulfate.
Hydrates have various uses in the health industry.
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO ·½H O), known as plaster of Paris, is used to make casts for broken bones.
4 2 Epsom salt (MgSO ·7H O) is used as a bathing salt and a laxative.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 193  Atoms combine into compounds by forming chemical bonds.
A survey of stable atoms and molecules leads to the octet rule, which says that stable atoms tend to have eight electrons in their outermost, or valence, shell.
One way atoms obtain eight electrons in the valence shell is for some atoms to lose electrons while other atoms gain them.
When this happens, the atoms take on an electrical charge.
Charged atoms are called ions.
Ions having opposite charges attract each other.
This attraction is called ionic bonding, and the compounds formed are calledionic compounds.
Positively charged ions are called cations, while negatively charged ions are called anions.
The formation of both cations and anions can be illustrated using electron configurations.
Because elements in a column of the periodic table have the same valence shell electron configuration, atoms in the same column of the periodic table tend to form ions having the same charge.
Electron dot diagrams, or Lewis diagrams, can also be used to illustrate the formation of cations and anions.
Ionic compounds are represented in writing by a chemical formula, which gives the lowest ratio of cations and anions present in the compound.
In a formula, the symbol of the cation is written first, followed by the symbol of the anion.
Formula unit is considered the basic unit of an ionic compound because ionic compounds do not exist as discrete units.
Instead, they exist as crystals, three-dimensional arrays of ions, with cations surrounded by anions and anions surrounded by cations.
Chemical formulas for ionic compounds are determined by balancing the positive charge from the cation(s) with the negative charge from the anion(s).
A subscript to the right of the ion indicates that more than one of that ion is present in the chemical formula.
Some ions are groups of atoms bonded together and having an overall electrical charge.
These are called polyatomic ions.
Writing formulas with polyatomic ions follows the same rules as with monatomic ions, except that when more than one polyatomic ion is present in a chemical formula, the polyatomic ion is enclosed in parentheses and the subscript is outside the right parenthesis.
Ionic compounds typically form between metals and nonmetals or between polyatomic ions.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 194  Names of ionic compounds are derived from the names of the ions, with the name of the cation coming first, followed by the name of the anion.
If an element can form cations of different charges, there are two alternate systems for indicating the compound’s name.
In the Stock system, a roman numeral in parentheses indicates the charge on the cation.
An example is the name for FeCl , which is iron(II) chloride.
In the common 2 system, the suffixes -ous and -ic are used to stand for the lower and higher possible charge of the cation, respectively.
These suffixes are attached to a stem representing the element (which frequently comes from the Latin form of the element name).
An example is the common name for FeCl , which is ferrous chloride.
2 The formula mass of an ionic compound is the sum of the masses of each individual atom in the formula.
Care must be taken when calculating formula masses for formulas containing multiple polyatomic ions because the subscript outside the parentheses refers to all the atoms in the polyatomic ion.

N3− Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 199  Chapter 4 Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds Opening Essay Cholesterol (C H O), a compound that is sometimes in the news, is a white, waxy solid 27 46 produced in the liver of every animal, including humans.
It is important for building cell membranes and in producing certain hormones (chemicals that regulate cellular activity in the body).
As such, it is necessary for life, but why is cholesterol the object of attention?
Besides producing cholesterol, we also ingest some whenever we eat meat or other animal-based food products.
People who eat such products in large quantities, or whose metabolisms are unable to handle excess amounts, may experience an unhealthy buildup of cholesterol in their blood.
Deposits of cholesterol, called plaque, may form on blood vessel walls, eventually blocking the arteries and preventing the delivery of oxygen to body tissues.
Heart attacks, strokes, and other circulatory problems can result.
Most medical professionals recommend diets that minimize the amount of ingested cholesterol as a way of preventing heart attacks and strokes.
Tests are available to measure cholesterol in the blood, and there are several drugs capable of lowering cholesterol levels.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 200  Figure 4.1A Molecular Model of Cholesterol Chapter 3 "Ionic Bonding and Simple Ionic Compounds" discussed ionic bonding, which results from the transfer of electrons among atoms or groups of atoms.
In this chapter, we will consider another type of bonding—covalent bonding.
We will examine how atoms share electrons to form these bonds, and we will begin to explore how the resulting compounds, such as cholesterol, are different from ionic compounds.
4.1 Covalent Bonds LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe how a covalent bond forms.
You have already seen examples of substances that contain covalent bonds.
One substance mentioned in Chapter 3 "Ionic Bonding and Simple Ionic Compounds" was water (H O).
You can tell from its formula that it is not an ionic compound; it is not 2 composed of a metal and a nonmetal.
Consequently, its properties are different from those of ionic compounds.
Electron Sharing Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 201  Chapter 3 "Ionic Bonding and Simple Ionic Compounds" described how electrons can be transferred from one atom to another so that both atoms have an energy-stable outer electron shell.
Because most filled electron shells have eight electrons in them, chemists called this tendency the octet rule.
But there is another way an atom can achieve a full valence shell: atoms can share electrons.
This concept can be illustrated by using two hydrogen atoms, each of which has a single electron in its valence shell.
(For small atoms such as hydrogen atoms, the valence shell will be the first shell, which holds only two electrons.)
We can represent the two individual hydrogen atoms as follows: In contrast, when two hydrogen atoms get close enough together to share their electrons, they can be represented as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 202  By sharing their valence electrons, both hydrogen atoms now have two electrons in their respective valence shells.
Because each valence shell is now filled, this arrangement is more stable than when the two atoms are separate.
The sharing of electrons between atoms is called a covalent bond, and the two electrons that join atoms in a covalent bond are called a bonding pair of electrons.
A discrete group of atoms connected by covalent bonds is called a molecule—the smallest part of a compound that retains the chemical identity of that compound.
Chemists frequently use Lewis diagrams to represent covalent bonding in molecular substances.
For example, the Lewis diagrams of two separate hydrogen atoms are as follows: The Lewis diagram of two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons looks like this: This depiction of molecules is simplified further by using a dash to represent a covalent bond.
The hydrogen molecule is then represented as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 203  Remember that the dash, also referred to as a single bond, represents a pair of electrons.
The bond in a hydrogen molecule, measured as the distance between the two nuclei, is about 7.4 × 10−11 m, or 74 picometers (pm; 1 pm = 1 × 10−12 m).
This particular bond length represents a balance between several forces: the attractions between oppositely charged electrons and nuclei, the repulsion between two negatively charged electrons, and the repulsion between two positively charged nuclei.
If the nuclei were closer together, they would repel each other more strongly; if the nuclei were farther apart, there would be less attraction between the positive and negative particles.
Fluorine is another element whose atoms bond together in pairs to form diatomic(two- atom) molecules.
Two separate fluorine atoms have the following electron dot diagrams: Each fluorine atom contributes one valence electron, making a single bond and giving each atom a complete valence shell, which fulfills the octet rule: The circles show that each fluorine atom has eight electrons around it.
As with hydrogen, we can represent the fluorine molecule with a dash in place of the bonding electrons: Each fluorine atom has six electrons, or three pairs of electrons, that are not participating in the covalent bond.
Rather than being shared, they are considered to belong to a single atom.
These are called nonbonding pairs (or lone pairs) of electrons.
Covalent Bonds between Different Atoms Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 204  Now that we have looked at electron sharing between atoms of the same element, let us look at covalent bond formation between atoms of different elements.
Consider a molecule composed of one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom: Each atom needs one additional electron to complete its valence shell.
By each contributing one electron, they make the following molecule: In this molecule, the hydrogen atom does not have nonbonding electrons, while the fluorine atom has six nonbonding electrons (three lone electron pairs).
The circles show how the valence electron shells are filled for both atoms.
EXAMPLE 1 Draw the Lewis diagram for each compound.
1. a molecule composed of two chlorine atoms 2. a molecule composed of a hydrogen atom and a bromine atom Solution 1.
Chlorine has the same valence shell electron configuration as fluorine, so the Lewis diagram for a molecule composed of two chlorine atoms is similar to the one for fluorine: 2.
Bromine has the same valence shell electron configuration as fluorine, so the Lewis diagram for a molecule composed of a hydrogen atom and a bromine atom is similar to that for hydrogen and fluorine: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 205  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Draw the Lewis diagram for each compound.

Determine the name of a simple covalent compound from its chemical formula.
What elements make covalent bonds?
Covalent bonds form when two or more nonmetals combine.
For example, both hydrogen and oxygen are nonmetals, and when Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 210  they combine to make water, they do so by forming covalent bonds.
Nonmetal atoms in polyatomic ions are joined by covalent bonds, but the ion as a whole participates in ionic bonding.
For example, ammonium chloride has ionic bonds between a polyatomic ion, NH +, and Cl− ions, but within the ammonium ion, the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms are 4 connected by covalent bonds: EXAMPLE 2 Is each compound formed from ionic bonds, covalent bonds, or both?

Na O 2 2.

The elements in Na O are a metal and a nonmetal, which form ionic bonds.
2 2.
Because sodium is a metal and we recognize the formula for the phosphate ion (see Table 3.1 "Some Polyatomic Ions"), we know that this compound is ionic.
However, polyatomic ions are held together by covalent bonds, so this compound contains both ionic and covalent bonds.
3.
The elements in N O are both nonmetals, rather than a metal and a nonmetal.
2 4 Therefore, the atoms form covalent bonds.

Ba(OH) 2 2.

PCl 3 The chemical formulas for covalent compounds are referred to as molecular formulas because these compounds exist as separate, discrete molecules.
Typically, a molecular formula begins with the nonmetal that is closest to the lower left corner of the periodic table, except that hydrogen is almost never written first (H O is 2 the prominent exception).
Then the other nonmetal symbols are listed.
Numerical subscripts are used if there is more than one of a particular atom.
For example, we have already seen CH , the molecular formula for methane.
4 Naming binary (two-element) covalent compounds is similar to naming simple ionic compounds.
The first element in the formula is simply listed using the name of the element.
The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding the suffix -ide.
A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule.
Table 4.1 "Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds" lists these numerical prefixes.
Normally, no prefix is added to the first element’s name if there is only one atom of the first element in a molecule.
If the second element is oxygen, the trailing vowel is usually omitted from the end of a polysyllabic prefix but not a monosyllabic one (that is, we would say “monoxide” rather than “monooxide” and “trioxide” rather than “troxide”).
Table 4.1 Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds Number of Atoms in Compound Prefix on the Name of the Element 1 mono-* 2 di- Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 212  Number of Atoms in Compound Prefix on the Name of the Element 3 tri- 4 tetra- 5 penta- 6 hexa- 7 hepta- 8 octa- 9 nona- 10 deca- *This prefix is not used for the first element’s name.
Let us practice by naming the compound whose molecular formula is CCl .
The name 4 begins with the name of the first element—carbon.
The second element, chlorine, becomes chloride, and we attach the correct numerical prefix (“tetra-”) to indicate that the molecule contains four chlorine atoms.
Putting these pieces together gives the name carbon tetrachloride for this compound.

Recognize molecules that are likely to have multiple covalent bonds.
In many molecules, the octet rule would not be satisfied if each pair of bonded atoms shares two electrons.
Consider carbon dioxide (CO ).
If each oxygen atom shares one 2 electron with the carbon atom, we get the following: This does not give the carbon atom a complete octet; you will find only six electrons in its valence shell.
In addition, each oxygen atom has only seven electrons in its valence shell.
Finally, no atom makes the number of bonds it typically forms (Figure 4.2 "How Many Covalent Bonds Are Formed?").
This arrangement of shared electrons is far from satisfactory.
Sometimes more than one pair of electrons must be shared between two atoms for both atoms to have an octet.
In carbon dioxide, a second electron from each oxygen atom is also shared with the central carbon atom, and the carbon atom shares one more electron with each oxygen atom: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 220  In this arrangement, the carbon atom shares four electrons (two pairs) with the oxygen atom on the left and four electrons with the oxygen atom on the right.
There are now eight electrons around each atom.
Two pairs of electrons shared between two atoms make a double bond between the atoms, which is represented by a double dash: Some molecules contain triple bonds, covalent bonds in which three pairs of electrons are shared by two atoms.
A simple compound that has a triple bond is acetylene (C H ), 2 2 whose Lewis diagram is as follows: EXAMPLE 5 Draw the Lewis diagram for each molecule.

4.4 Characteristics of Covalent Bonds LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Compare covalent bonds in terms of bond length and bond polarity.
Covalent bonds have certain characteristics that depend on the identities of the atoms participating in the bond.
Two characteristics are bond length and bond polarity.
Bond Length Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 224  In Section 4.1 "Covalent Bonds", we stated that the covalent bond in the hydrogen molecule (H ) has a certain length (about 7.4 × 10−11 m).
Other covalent bonds also have 2 known bond lengths, which are dependent on both the identities of the atoms in the bond and whether the bonds are single, double, or triple bonds.
Table 4.2 "Approximate Bond Lengths of Some Single Bonds" lists the approximate bond lengths for some single covalent bonds.
The exact bond length may vary depending on the identity of the molecule but will be close to the value given in the table.
Table 4.2 Approximate Bond Lengths of Some Single Bonds Bond Length (× 10−12 m) H–H 74 H–C 110 H–N 100 H–O 97 H–I 161 C–C 154 C–N 147 C–O 143 N–N 145 O–O 145 Table 4.3 "Comparison of Bond Lengths for Single and Multiple Bonds" compares the lengths of single covalent bonds with those of double and triple bonds between the same atoms.
Without exception, as the number of covalent bonds between two atoms Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 225  increases, the bond length decreases.
With more electrons between the two nuclei, the nuclei can get closer together before the internuclear repulsion is strong enough to balance the attraction.
Table 4.3 Comparison of Bond Lengths for Single and Multiple Bonds Bond Length (× 10−12 m) C–C 154 C=C 134 C≡C 120 C–N 147 C=N 128 C≡N 116 C–O 143 C=O 120 C≡O 113 N–N 145 N=N 123 N≡N 110 O–O 145 O=O 121 Electronegativity and Bond Polarity Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 226  Although we defined covalent bonding as electron sharing, the electrons in a covalent bond are not always shared equally by the two bonded atoms.
Unless the bond connects two atoms of the same element, there will always be one atom that attracts the electrons in the bond more strongly than the other atom does, as shown in Figure 4.3 "Polar versus Nonpolar Covalent Bonds".
When such an imbalance occurs, there is a resulting buildup of some negative charge (called a partial negative charge and designated δ−) on one side of the bond and some positive charge (designated δ+) on the other side of the bond.
A covalent bond that has an unequal sharing of electrons, as in part (b) of Figure 4.3 "Polar versus Nonpolar Covalent Bonds", is called a polar covalent bond.
A covalent bond that has an equal sharing of electrons (part (a) of Figure 4.3 "Polar versus Nonpolar Covalent Bonds") is called a nonpolar covalent bond.
Figure 4.3 Polar versus Nonpolar Covalent Bonds Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 227  (a) The electrons in the covalent bond are equally shared by both hydrogen atoms.
This is a nonpolar covalent bond.
(b) The fluorine atom attracts the electrons in the bond more than the hydrogen atom does, leading to an imbalance in the electron distribution.
This is a polar covalent bond.
Any covalent bond between atoms of different elements is a polar bond, but the degree of polarity varies widely.
Some bonds between different elements are only minimally Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 228  polar, while others are strongly polar.
Ionic bonds can be considered the ultimate in polarity, with electrons being transferred rather than shared.
To judge the relative polarity of a covalent bond, chemists use electronegativity, which is a relative measure of how strongly an atom attracts electrons when it forms a covalent bond.
There are various numerical scales for rating electronegativity.
Figure 4.4 "Electronegativities of Various Elements" shows one of the most popular—the Pauling scale.
The polarity of a covalent bond can be judged by determining the difference in the electronegativities of the two atoms making the bond.
The greater the difference in electronegativities, the greater the imbalance of electron sharing in the bond.
Although there are no hard and fast rules, the general rule is if the difference in electronegativities is less than about 0.4, the bond is considered nonpolar; if the difference is greater than 0.4, the bond is considered polar.
If the difference in electronegativities is large enough (generally greater than about 1.8), the resulting compound is considered ionic rather than covalent.
An electronegativity difference of zero, of course, indicates a nonpolar covalent bond.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 229  Figure 4.4 Electronegativities of Various Elements A popular scale for electronegativities has the value for fluorine atoms set at 4.0, the highest value.
Looking Closer: Linus Pauling Arguably the most influential chemist of the 20th century, Linus Pauling (1901–94) is the only person to have won two individual (that is, unshared) Nobel Prizes.
In the 1930s, Pauling used new mathematical theories to enunciate some fundamental principles of the chemical bond.
His 1939 book The Nature of the Chemical Bond is one of the most significant books ever published in chemistry.
By 1935, Pauling’s interest turned to biological molecules, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on protein structure.
(He was very close to discovering the double helix structure of DNA when James Watson and James Crick announced their own discovery of its structure in 1953.)
He was later awarded the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to ban the testing of nuclear weapons.
In his later years, Pauling became convinced that large doses of vitamin C would prevent disease, including the common cold.
Most clinical research failed to show a connection, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 230  but Pauling continued to take large doses daily.
He died in 1994, having spent a lifetime establishing a scientific legacy that few will ever equal.
Linus Pauling was one of the most influential chemists of the 20th century.

For example, the orientation of the two O–H bonds in a water molecule (Figure 4.5 "Physical Properties and Polarity") is bent: one end of the molecule has a partial positive charge, and the other end has a partial negative charge.
In short, the molecule itself is polar.
The polarity of water has an enormous impact on its physical and chemical properties.
(For example, the boiling point of water [100°C] is high for such a small molecule and is due to the fact that polar molecules attract each other strongly.)
In contrast, while the two C=O bonds in carbon dioxide are polar, they lie directly opposite each other and so cancel each other’s effects.
Thus, carbon dioxide molecules are nonpolar overall.
This lack of polarity influences some of carbon dioxide’s properties.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 232  (For example, carbon dioxide becomes a gas at −77°C, almost 200° lower than the temperature at which water boils.)

Determine the molecular mass of a molecule.
2.
Predict the general shape of a simple covalent molecule.
Unlike the ions in ionic compounds, which are arranged in lattices called crystals, molecules of covalent compounds exist as discrete units with a characteristic mass and a certain three-dimensional shape.
Molecular Mass The mass of a molecule—the molecular mass (sometimes called the molecular weight)—is simply the sum of the masses of its atoms.
As with formula masses, it is important that you keep track of the number of atoms of each element in the molecular formula to obtain the correct molecular mass.
(For more information about formula masses, see Chapter 3 "Ionic Bonding and Simple Ionic Compounds", Section 3.5 "Formula Mass".)

BF 3 Molecular Shape: VSEPR Theory Unlike ionic compounds, with their extended crystal lattices, covalent molecules are discrete units with specific three-dimensional shapes.
The shape of a molecule is determined by the fact that covalent bonds, which are composed of negatively charged electrons, tend to repel one another.
This concept is called the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory.
For example, the two covalent bonds in BeCl stay as 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 239  far from each other as possible, ending up 180° apart from each other.
The result is a linear molecule: The three covalent bonds in BF repel each other to form 120° angles in a plane, in a 3 shape called trigonal planar: The molecules BeCl and BF actually violate the octet rule; however, such exceptions 2 3 are rare and will not be discussed in this text.
Note Try sticking three toothpicks into a marshmallow or a gumdrop and see if you can find different positions where your “bonds” are farther apart than the planar 120° orientation.
The four covalent bonds in CCl arrange themselves three dimensionally, pointing 4 toward the corner of a tetrahedron and making bond angles of 109.5°: Molecules with lone electron pairs around the central atom have a shape based on the position of the atoms, not the electron pairs.
For example, NH has one lone electron 3 pair and three bonded electron pairs.
These four electron pairs repel each other and adopt a tetrahedral arrangement: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 240  However, the shape of the molecule is described in terms of the positions of the atoms, not the lone electron pairs.
Thus, NH is said to have a pyramidal shape, not a 3 tetrahedral one.
Similarly, H O has two lone pairs of electrons around the central 2 oxygen atom, in addition to the two bonded pairs: Although the four electron pairs adopt a tetrahedral arrangement due to repulsion, the shape of the molecule is described by the positions of the atoms only.
The shape of H O 2 is bent.
In determining the shapes of molecules, it is useful to first determine the Lewis diagram for a molecule.
The shapes of molecules with multiple bonds are determined by treating the multiple bonds as one bond.
Thus, CH O has a shape similar to that of BF : 2 3 EXAMPLE 8 Describe the shape of each molecule.

PCl 3 2.
CO 2 Solution 1.
The Lewis diagram for PCl is as follows: 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 241  The four electron pairs arrange themselves tetrahedrally, but the lone electron pair is not considered in describing the molecular shape.
Like NH , this molecule is pyramidal.
3 2.
The Lewis diagram for CO is as follows: 2 The multiple bonds are treated as one group.
Thus, CO has only two groups of electrons 2 that repel each other.
They will direct themselves 180° apart from each other, so CO molecules are linear.

Define organic chemistry.
2.
Identify organic molecules as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, or carboxylic acids.
When methane was mentioned at the end of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch04_s02, we described it as the simplest organic compound.
In this section, we introduce organic chemistry more formally.
Organic chemistry is the study of the chemistry of carbon compounds.
Carbon is singled out because it has a chemical diversity unrivaled by any other chemical element.
Its diversity is based on the following:  Carbon atoms bond reasonably strongly with other carbon atoms.
 Carbon atoms bond reasonably strongly with atoms of other elements.
 Carbon atoms make a large number of covalent bonds (four).
Curiously, elemental carbon is not particularly abundant.
It does not even appear in the list of the most common elements in Earth’s crust.
(See http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch02_s01_s01_t01 in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch02.)
Nevertheless, all living things consist of organic compounds.
Most organic chemicals are covalent compounds, which is why we introduce organic chemistry here.
By convention, compounds containing carbonate ions and bicarbonate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 245  ions, as well as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, are not considered part of organic chemistry, even though they contain carbon.
The simplest organic compounds are the hydrocarbons, compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms only.
Some hydrocarbons have only single bonds and appear as a chain (which can be a straight chain or can have branches) of carbon atoms also bonded to hydrogen atoms.
These hydrocarbons are called alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons).
Each alkane has a characteristic, systematic name depending on the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
These names consist of a stem that indicates the number of carbon atoms in the chain plus the ending -ane.
The stem meth- means one carbon atom, so methane is an alkane with one carbon atom.
Similarly, the stem eth- means two carbon atoms; ethane is an alkane with two carbon atoms.
Continuing, the stem prop- means three carbon atoms, so propane is an alkane with three carbon atoms.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch04_s06_f01gives the formulas and the molecular models of the three simplest alkanes.
(For more information about alkanes, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch12.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 246  Figure 4.6 Formulas and Molecular Models of the Three Simplest Alkanes The three smallest alkanes are methane, ethane, and propane.
Some hydrocarbons have one or more carbon–carbon double bonds (denoted C=C).
These hydrocarbons are called alkenes.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch04_s06_f02shows the formulas and the molecular models of the two simplest alkenes.
Note that the names of alkenes have the same stem as the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms in its chain but have the ending -ene.
Thus, ethene is an alkene with two carbon atoms per molecule, and propene is a compound with three carbon atoms and one double bond.
Figure 4.7 Formulas and Molecular Models of the Two Simplest Alkenes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 247  Ethene is commonly called ethylene, while propene is commonly called propylene.
Alkynes are hydrocarbons with a carbon–carbon triple bond (denoted C≡C) as part of their carbon skeleton.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch04_s06_f03shows the formulas and the molecular models of the two simplest alkynes and their systematic names.
The names for alkynes have the same stems as for alkanes but with the ending -yne.
(For more information about alkenes and alkynes, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch13.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 248  Figure 4.8 Formulas and Molecular Models of the Two Simplest Alkynes Ethyne is more commonly called acetylene.
Note The compound acetylene, with its carbon–carbon triple bond, was introduced in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch04_s03 and is an alkyne.
To Your Health: Saturated and Unsaturated Fats Hydrocarbons are not the only compounds that can have carbon–carbon double bonds.
A group of compounds called fats can have them as well, and their presence or absence in the human diet is becoming increasingly correlated with health issues.
Fats are combinations of long-chain organic compounds (fatty acids) and glycerol (C H O ).
(For more information on fats, 3 8 3 see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch17, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch17_s01.)
The long carbon chains can have either all single bonds, in which case the fat is classified as saturated, or one or more double bonds, in which case it is a monounsaturated or a polyunsaturated fat, respectively.
Saturated fats are typically solids at room temperature; beef fat (tallow) is one example.
Mono- or polyunsaturated fats are likely to be liquids at room temperature and are often called oils.
Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and many fish oils are mono- or polyunsaturated fats.
Studies have linked higher amounts of saturated fats in people’s diets with a greater likelihood of developing heart disease, high cholesterol, and other diet-related diseases.
In contrast, increases in unsaturated fats (either mono- or polyunsaturated) have been Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 249  linked to a lower incidence of certain diseases.
Thus, there have been an increasing number of recommendations by government bodies and health associations to decrease the proportion of saturated fat and increase the proportion of unsaturated fat in the diet.
Most of these organizations also recommend decreasing the total amount of fat in the diet.
Recently, certain fats called trans fats have been implicated in the presence of heart disease.
These are fats from animal sources and are also produced when liquid oils are exposed to partial hydrogenation, an industrial process that increases their saturation.
Trans fats are used in many prepared and fried foods.
Because they bring with them the health risks that naturally occurring saturated fats do, there has been some effort to better quantify the presence of trans fats in food products.
US law now requires that food labels list the amount of trans fat in each serving.
Since 1992, the US Department of Agriculture has been promoting a food pyramid that gives a simple, visual picture of how much of what kind of foods make up a good, balanced diet.
It recommends eating as few fats as possible.
Although nutritionists recognize that some fat is necessary (and largely unavoidable, even by strict vegetarians), they emphasize that a large proportion of any fat, saturated or unsaturated, in the diet is unhealthy.
Even so, a difference as simple as the difference between a single and double carbon–carbon bond can have a significant impact on health.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 250  The food pyramid has suggestions for the number of daily servings of each type of food.

The carbon–carbon double and triple bonds are examples of functional groups in organic chemistry.
A functional group is a specific structural arrangement of atoms or bonds that imparts a characteristic chemical reactivity to a molecule.
Alkanes have no functional group.
A carbon–carbon double bond is considered a functional group because carbon–carbon double bonds chemically react in specific ways that differ from reactions of alkanes (for example, under certain circumstances, alkenes react with water); a carbon–carbon triple bond also undergoes certain specific chemical reactions.
In the remainder of this section, we introduce two other common functional groups.
If an OH group (also called a hydroxyl group) is substituted for a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon molecule, the compound is an alcohol.
Alcohols are named using the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 251  parent hydrocarbon name but with the final -e dropped and the suffix -ol attached.
The two simplest alcohols are methanol and ethanol.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch04_s06_f04 shows their formulas along with a molecular model of each.
Figure 4.9 The Two Simplest Organic Alcohol Compounds Alcohols have an OH functional group in the molecule.
Note Cholesterol, described in the chapter-opening essay, has an alcohol functional group, as its name implies.
Note Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol) is the alcohol in alcoholic beverages.
Other alcohols include methanol (or methyl alcohol), which is used as a solvent and a cleaner, and isopropyl alcohol (or rubbing alcohol), which is used as a medicinal disinfectant.
Neither methanol nor isopropyl alcohol should be ingested, as they are toxic even in small quantities.
Another important family of organic compounds has a carboxyl group, in which a carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and to an OH group.
Compounds with a carboxyl functional group are called carboxylic acids, and their names end in -oic acid.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch04_s06_f05 shows the formulas and the molecular models of the two simplest carboxylic acids, perhaps Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 252  best known by the common names formic acid and acetic acid.
The carboxyl group is sometimes written in molecules as COOH.
Figure 4.10 The Two Smallest Organic Acids The two smallest carboxylic acids are formic acid (found in the stingers of ants) and acetic acid (found in vinegar).
Many organic compounds are considerably more complex than the examples described here.
Many compounds, such as cholesterol discussed in the chapter-opening essay, contain more than one functional group.
The formal names can also be quite complex.
In http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch12through http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15, we will examine the characteristics and chemistry of other important organic compounds and functional groups.

Career Focus: Forensic Chemist The main job of a forensic chemist is to identify unknown materials and their origins.
Although forensic chemists are most closely associated in the public mind with crime labs, they are employed in pursuits as diverse as tracing evolutionary patterns in living organisms, identifying environmental contaminants, and determining the origin of manufactured chemicals.
In a crime lab, the forensic chemist has the job of identifying the evidence so that a crime can be solved.
The unknown samples may consist of almost anything—for example, paint chips, blood, glass, cloth fibers, drugs, or human remains.
The forensic chemist subjects them to a variety of chemical and instrumental tests to discover what the samples are.
Sometimes these samples are extremely small, but sophisticated Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 255  forensic labs have state-of-the-art equipment capable of identifying the smallest amount of unknown sample.
Another aspect of a forensic chemist’s job is testifying in court.
Judges and juries need to be informed about the results of forensic analyses, and it is the forensic chemist’s job to explain those results.
Good public-speaking skills, along with a broad background in chemistry, are necessary to be a successful forensic chemist.

Atoms can share pairs of valence electrons to obtain a valence shell octet.
This sharing of electrons is a covalent bond.
A species formed from covalently bonded atoms is a molecule and is represented by a molecular formula, which gives the number of atoms of each type in the molecule.
The two electrons shared in a covalent bond are called a bonding pair of electrons.
The electrons that do not participate in covalent bonds are called nonbonding pairs (or lone pairs) of electrons.
A covalent bond consisting of one pair of shared electrons is called a single bond.
Covalent bonds occur between nonmetal atoms.
Naming simple covalent compounds follows simple rules similar to those for ionic compounds.
However, for covalent compounds, numerical prefixes are used as necessary to specify the number of atoms of each element in the compound.
In some cases, more than one pair of electrons is shared to satisfy the octet rule.
Two pairs of electrons are shared by two atoms to make a double bond.
Three pairs of atoms are shared to make a triple bond.
Single, double, and triple covalent bonds may be represented by one, two, or three dashes, respectively, between the symbols of the atoms.
The distance between two covalently bonded atoms is the bond length.
Bond lengths depend on the types of atoms participating in the bond as well as the number of electron pairs being shared.
A covalent bond can be a polar covalent bond if the electron sharing between the two atoms is unequal.
If the sharing is equal, the bond is a nonpolar covalent bond.
Because the strength of an atom’s attraction for electrons Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 261  in a bond is rated by the atom’s electronegativity, the difference in the two atoms’ electronegativities indicates how polar a covalent bond between those atoms will be.
The mass of a molecule is called its molecular mass and is the sum of the masses of the atoms in the molecule.
The shape of a molecule can be predicted using valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR), which uses the fact that the negative electrons in covalent bonds repel each other as much as possible.
Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds.
Carbon forms covalent bonds with other carbon atoms and with the atoms of many other elements.
The simplest organic compounds are hydrocarbons, which consist solely of carbon and hydrogen.
Hydrocarbons containing only single bonds are called alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons).
Hydrocarbons containing carbon–carbon double bonds are alkenes, while hydrocarbons with carbon–carbon triple bonds are alkynes.
Carbon-carbon double and triple bonds are examples of functional groups, atoms or bonds that impart a characteristic chemical function to the molecule.
Other functional groups include the alcohol functional group (OH) and the carboxyl functional group (COOH).
They are the characteristic functional group in organic compounds called alcohols and carboxylic acids.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 266  Chapter 5 Introduction to Chemical Reactions Opening Essay Although yeast has been used for thousands of years, its true nature has been known only for the last two centuries.
Yeasts are single-celled fungi.
About 1,000 species are recognized, but the most common species is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is used in bread making.
Other species are used for the fermentation of alcoholic beverages.
Some species can cause infections in humans.
Yeasts live primarily on sugars, such as glucose (C H O ).
They convert glucose into 6 12 6 carbon dioxide (CO ) and ethanol (C H OH) in a chemical transformation that is 2 2 5 represented as follows: C H O → 2CO (g) + 2C H OH(ℓ) 6 12 6 2 2 5 Bread making depends on the production of carbon dioxide.
The gas, which is produced in tiny pockets in bread dough, acts as a leavening agent: it expands during baking and makes the bread rise.
Leavened bread is softer, lighter, and easier to eat and chew than unleavened bread.
The other major use of yeast, fermentation, depends on the production of ethanol, which results from the same chemical transformation.
Some alcoholic beverages, such as champagne, can also be carbonated using the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast.
Yeast is among the simplest life forms on Earth, yet it is absolutely necessary for at least two major food industries.
Without yeast to turn dough into bread and juice into wine, these foods and food industries would not exist today.
Chemical change is a central concept in chemistry.
The goal of chemists is to know how and why a substance changes in the presence of another substance or even by itself.
Because there are tens of millions of known substances, there are a huge number of possible chemical reactions.
In this chapter, we will find that many of these reactions can be classified into a small number of categories according to certain shared characteristics.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 267  5.1 The Law of Conservation of Matter LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Correctly define a law as it pertains to science.
2.
State the law of conservation of matter.
In science, a law is a general statement that explains a large number of observations.
Before being accepted, a law must be verified many times under many conditions.
Laws are therefore considered the highest form of scientific knowledge and are generally thought to be inviolable.
Scientific laws form the core of scientific knowledge.
One scientific law that provides the foundation for understanding in chemistry is the law of conservation of matter.
It states that in any given system that is closed to the transfer of matter (in and out), the amount of matter in the system stays constant.
A concise way of expressing this law is to say that the amount of matter in a system isconserved.
What does this mean for chemistry?
In any chemical change, one or more initial substances change into a different substance or substances.
Both the initial and final substances are composed of atoms because all matter is composed of atoms.
According to the law of conservation of matter, matter is neither created nor destroyed, so we must have the same number and type of atoms after the chemical change as were present before the chemical change.
Before looking at explicit examples of the law of conservation of matter, we need to examine the method chemists use to represent chemical changes.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 269  5.2 Chemical Equations LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define chemical reaction.
2.
Use a balanced chemical equation to represent a chemical reaction.
Water (H O) is composed of hydrogen and oxygen.
Suppose we imagine a process in 2 which we take some elemental hydrogen (H ) and elemental oxygen (O ) and let them 2 2 react to make water.
The statement hydrogen and oxygen react to make water is one way to represent that process, which is called a chemical reaction.
Figure 5.1 "The Formation of Water" shows a rather dramatic example of this very reaction.
Figure 5.1 The Formation of Water Hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water.
Here, the hydrogen gas in the zeppelin SS Hindenburg reacts with oxygen in the air to make water.
Source: Photo courtesy of the US Navy, http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hindenburg_burning.jpg.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 270  To simplify the writing of reactions, we use formulas instead of names when we describe a reaction.
We can also use symbols to represent other words in the reaction.
A plus sign connects the initial substances (and final substances, if there is more than one), and an arrow (→) represents the chemical change: H + O → H O 2 2 2 This statement is one example of a chemical equation, an abbreviated way of using symbols to represent a chemical change.
The substances on the left side of the arrow are called reactants, and the substances on the right side of the arrow are called products.
It is not uncommon to include a phase label with each formula—(s) for solid, (ℓ) for liquid, (g) for gas, and (aq) for a substance dissolved in water, also known as an aqueous solution.
If we included phase labels for the reactants and products, under normal environmental conditions, the reaction would be as follows: H (g) + O (g) → H O(ℓ) 2 2 2 Note Chemical equations can also be used to describe physical changes.
We will see examples of this soon.
This equation is still not complete because it does not satisfy the law of conservation of matter.
Count the number of atoms of each element on each side of the arrow.
On the reactant side, there are two H atoms and two O atoms; on the product side, there are two H atoms and only one oxygen atom.
The equation is not balanced because the number of oxygen atoms on each side is not the same (Figure 5.2 "Balanced—Yes or No?").
Figure 5.2 Balanced—Yes or No?
By counting the atoms of each element, we can see that the reaction is not balanced as written.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 271  To make this chemical equation conform to the law of conservation of matter, we must revise the amounts of the reactants and the products as necessary to get the same number of atoms of a given element on each side.
Because every substance has a characteristic chemical formula, we cannot change the chemical formulas of the individual substances.
For example, we cannot change the formula for elemental oxygen to O.
However, we can assume that different numbers of reactant molecules or product molecules may be involved.
For instance, perhaps two water molecules are produced, not just one: H (g) + O (g) → 2H O(ℓ) 2 2 2 The 2 preceding the formula for water is called a coefficient.
It implies that two water molecules are formed.
There are now two oxygen atoms on each side of the equation.
Note This point is so important that we should repeat it.
You cannot change the formula of a chemical substance to balance a chemical reaction!
You must use the proper chemical formula of the substance.
Unfortunately, by inserting the coefficient 2 in front of the formula for water, we have also changed the number of hydrogen atoms on the product side as well.
As a result, we no longer have the same number of hydrogen atoms on each side.
This can be easily fixed, however, by putting a coefficient of 2 in front of the diatomic hydrogen reactant: 2H (g) + O (g) → 2H O(ℓ) 2 2 2 Now we have four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms on each side of the equation.
The law of conservation of matter is satisfied because we now have the same number of atoms of each element in the reactants and in the products.
We say that the reaction is balanced (Figure 5.3 "Balanced—Yes or No?").
The diatomic oxygen has a coefficient of 1, which typically is not written but assumed in balanced chemical equations.
Figure 5.3 Balanced—Yes or No?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 272  By counting the atoms of each element, we can see that the reaction is now balanced.
Proper chemical equations should be balanced.
Writing balanced reactions is a chemist’s way of acknowledging the law of conservation of matter.
EXAMPLE 1 Is each chemical equation balanced?
1.
2Na(s) + O (g) → 2Na O(s) 2 2 2.
CH (g) + 2O (g) → CO (g) + 2H O(ℓ) 4 2 2 2 3.
AgNO (aq) + 2KCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + KNO (aq) 3 3 Solution 1.
By counting, we find two sodium atoms and two oxygen atoms in the reactants and four sodium atoms and two oxygen atoms in the products.
This equation is not balanced.
2.
The reactants have one carbon atom, four hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms.
The products have one carbon atom, four hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms.
This equation is balanced.
3.
The reactants have one silver atom, one nitrogen atom, three oxygen atoms, two potassium atoms, and two chlorine atoms.
The products have one silver atom, one chlorine atom, one potassium atom, one nitrogen atom, and three oxygen atoms.
Because there are different numbers of chlorine and potassium atoms, this equation is not balanced.

1.
2Hg(ℓ) + O (g) → Hg O (s) 2 2 2 2.
C H (g) + 2O (g) → 2CO (g) + 2H O(ℓ) 2 4 2 2 2 3.
Mg(NO ) (s) + 2Li(s) → Mg(s) + 2LiNO (s) 3 2 3 How does one balance a chemical equation, starting with the correct formulas of the reactants and products?
Basically, a back-and-forth approach is adopted, counting the number of atoms of one element on one side, checking the number of atoms of that element on the other side, and changing a coefficient if necessary.
Then check another element, going back and forth from one side of the equation to another, until each element has the same number of atoms on both sides of the arrow.
In many cases, it does not matter which element is balanced first and which is balanced last, as long as all elements have the same number of atoms on each side of the equation.
For example, to balance the equation CH + Cl → CCl + HCl 4 2 4 we might choose to count the carbon atoms first, finding that both sides are balanced with one carbon atom.
The reactant side has four hydrogen atoms, so the product side must also have four hydrogen atoms.
We fix this by putting a 4 in front of the HCl: CH + Cl → CCl + 4HCl 4 2 4 Now each side has four hydrogen atoms.
The product side has a total of eight chlorine atoms (four from the CCl and four from the four molecules of HCl), so we need eight 4 chlorine atoms as reactants.
Because elemental chlorine is a diatomic molecule, we need four chlorine molecules to get a total of eight chlorine atoms.
We add another 4 in front of the Cl reactant: 2 CH + 4Cl → CCl + 4HCl 4 2 4 Now we check: each side has one carbon atom, four hydrogen atoms, and eight chlorine atoms.
The chemical equation is balanced.

Calculate the amount of one substance that will react with or be produced from a given amount of another substance.
A balanced chemical equation not only describes some of the chemical properties of substances—by showing us what substances react with what other substances to make what products—but also shows numerical relationships between the reactants and the products.
The study of these numerical relationships is called stoichiometry.
The stoichiometry of chemical equations revolves around the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation because these coefficients determine the molecular ratio in which reactants react and products are made.
Note The word stoichiometry is pronounced “stow-eh-key-OM-et-tree.” It is of mixed Greek and English origins, meaning roughly “measure of an element.” Looking Closer: Stoichiometry in Cooking Let us consider a stoichiometry analogy from the kitchen.
A recipe that makes 1 dozen biscuits needs 2 cups of flour, 1 egg, 4 tablespoons of shortening, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 cup of milk.
If we were to write this as a chemical equation, we would write 2 c flour + 1 egg + 4 tbsp shortening + 1 tsp salt + 1 tsp baking soda + 1 c milk → 12 biscuits (Unlike true chemical reactions, this one has all 1 coefficients written explicitly—partly because of the many different units here.)
This equation gives us ratios of how much of what reactants are needed to make how much of what product.
Two cups of flour, when combined with the proper amounts of the other ingredients, will yield 12 biscuits.
One teaspoon of baking soda (when also combined with the right amounts of the other ingredients) will make 12 biscuits.
One egg must be combined with 1 cup of milk to yield the product food.
Other relationships can also be expressed.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 279  We can use the ratios we derive from the equation for predictive purposes.
For instance, if we have 4 cups of flour, how many biscuits can we make if we have enough of the other ingredients?
It should be apparent that we can make a double recipe of 24 biscuits.
But how would we find this answer formally, that is, mathematically?
We would set up a conversion factor, much like we did in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement".
Because 2 cups of flour make 12 biscuits, we can set up an equivalency ratio: We then can use this ratio in a formal conversion of flour to biscuits: Similarly, by constructing similar ratios, we can determine how many biscuits we can make from any amount of ingredient.
When you are doubling or halving a recipe, you are doing a type of stoichiometry.
Applying these ideas to chemical reactions should not be difficult if you use recipes when you cook.
Consider the following balanced chemical equation: 2C H + 5O → 4CO + 2H O 2 2 2 2 2 The coefficients on the chemical formulas give the ratios in which the reactants combine and the products form.
Thus, we can make the following statements and construct the following ratios: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 280  Other relationships are possible; in fact, 12 different conversion factors can be constructed from this balanced chemical equation.
In each ratio, the unit is assumed to be molecules because that is how we are interpreting the chemical equation.
Any of these fractions can be used as a conversion factor to relate an amount of one substance to an amount of another substance.
For example, suppose we want to know how many CO molecules are formed when 26 molecules of C H are reacted.
As usual 2 2 2 with a conversion problem, we start with the amount we are given—26C H —and 2 2 multiply it by a conversion factor that cancels out our original unit and introduces the unit we are converting to—in this case, CO .
That conversion factor is , which is 2 composed of terms that come directly from the balanced chemical equation.
Thus, we have The molecules of C H cancel, and we are left with molecules of CO .
Multiplying 2 2 2 through, we get Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 281  Thus, 52 molecules of CO are formed.
2 This application of stoichiometry is extremely powerful in its predictive ability, as long as we begin with a balanced chemical equation.
Without a balanced chemical equation, the predictions made by simple stoichiometric calculations will be incorrect.
EXAMPLE 2 Start with this balanced chemical equation.
KMnO + 8HCl + 5FeCl → 5 FeCl + MnCl + 4H O + KCl 4 2 3 2 2 1.
Verify that the equation is indeed balanced.
2.
Give 2 ratios that give the relationship between HCl and FeCl .
3 Solution 1.
Each side has 1 K atom and 1 Mn atom.
The 8 molecules of HCl yield 8 H atoms, and the 4 molecules of H O also yield 8 H atoms, so the H atoms are balanced.
The Fe atoms are 2 balanced, as we count 5 Fe atoms from 5 FeCl reactants and 5 FeCl products.
As for Cl, 2 3 on the reactant side, there are 8 Cl atoms from HCl and 10 Cl atoms from the 5 FeCl formula units, for a total of 18 Cl atoms.
On the product side, there are 15 Cl atoms 2 from the 5 FeCl formula units, 2 from the MnCl formula unit, and 1 from the KCl 3 2 formula unit.
This is a total of 18 Cl atoms in the products, so the Cl atoms are balanced.
All the elements are balanced, so the entire chemical equation is balanced.
2.
Because the balanced chemical equation tells us that 8 HCl molecules react to make 5 FeCl formula units, we have the following 2 ratios: .There are a total 3 of 42 possible ratios.

Classify a given chemical reaction into a variety of types.
Although there are untold millions of possible chemical reactions, most can be classified into a small number of general reaction types.
Classifying reactions has two purposes: it helps us to recognize similarities among them, and it enables us to predict the products of certain reactions.
A particular reaction may fall into more than one of the categories that we will define in this book.
A combination (composition) reaction is a chemical reaction that makes a single substance from two or more reactants.
There may be more than one molecule of product in the balanced chemical equation, but there is only one substance produced.
For example, the equation 4Fe + 3O → 2Fe O 2 2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 286  is a combination reaction that produces Fe O from its constituent elements—Fe and O .
2 3 2 Combination reactions do not have to combine elements, however.
The chemical equation Fe O + 3SO → Fe (SO ) 2 3 3 2 4 3 shows a combination reaction in which Fe O combines with three molecules of SO to 2 3 3 make Fe (SO ) .

P (s) + 6Cl (g) → 4PCl (g) 4 2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 287  2.
SO (ℓ) + H O(ℓ) → H SO (ℓ) 3 2 2 4 3.
NaOH(s) + HCl(g) → NaCl(s) + H O(ℓ) 2 A decomposition reaction is the reverse of a combination reaction.
In a decomposition reaction, a single substance is converted into two or more products.
There may be more than one molecule of the reactant, but there is only one substance initially.
For example, the equation 2NaHCO (s) → Na CO (s) + CO (g) + H O(ℓ) 3 2 3 2 2 is a decomposition reaction that occurs when NaHCO is exposed to heat.
Another 3 example is the decomposition of KClO : 3 2KClO (s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O (g) 3 2 This reaction was once commonly used to generate small amounts of oxygen in the chemistry lab.
Note The decomposition reaction of NaHCO is the reaction that occurs when baking soda is 3 poured on a small kitchen fire.
The intent is that the H O and CO produced by the 2 2 decomposition will smother the flames.
A combustion reaction occurs when a substance combines with molecular oxygen to make oxygen-containing compounds of other elements in the reaction.

Identify a chemical reaction as an oxidation-reduction reaction.
Figure 5.4 Zinc Metal plus When zinc metal is submerged into a quantity of Hydrochloric Acid aqueous HCl, the following reaction occurs (Figure 5.4 "Zinc Metal plus Hydrochloric Acid"): Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → H (g) + ZnCl (aq) 2 2 This is one example of what is sometimes called a single replacement reaction because Zn replaces H in combination with Cl.
Because some of the substances in this reaction are It is fairly obvious that zinc aqueous, we can separate them into ions: Zn(s) + 2H+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) → H (g) + Zn2+(aq) + metal reacts with aqueous 2 2Cl−(aq) hydrochloric acid!

charge transfer between zinc and hydrogen atoms.
Source: Photo courtesy of (There is no net change experienced by the chloride Chemicalinterest, ion.)
In fact, electrons are being transferred from the http://commons.wikimedi a.org/wiki/File:Zn_reactio Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org n_with_HCl.JPG.
292  zinc atoms to the hydrogen atoms (which ultimately make a molecule of diatomic hydrogen), changing the charges on both elements.
To understand electron-transfer reactions like the one between zinc metal and hydrogen ions, chemists separate them into two parts: one part focuses on the loss of electrons, and one part focuses on the gain of electrons.
The loss of electrons is called oxidation.
The gain of electrons is called reduction.
Because any loss of electrons by one substance must be accompanied by a gain in electrons by something else, oxidation and reduction always occur together.
As such, electron-transfer reactions are also called oxidation-reduction reactions, or simply redox reactions.
The atom that loses electrons is oxidized, and the atom that gains electrons is reduced.
Also, because we can think of the species being oxidized as causing the reduction, the species being oxidized is called the reducing agent, and the species being reduced is called the oxidizing agent.
Note Because batteries are used as sources of electricity (that is, of electrons), all batteries are based on redox reactions.
Although the two reactions occur together, it can be helpful to write the oxidation and reduction reactions separately as half reactions.
In half reactions, we include only the reactant being oxidized or reduced, the corresponding product species, any other species needed to balance the half reaction, and the electrons being transferred.
Electrons that are lost are written as products; electrons that are gained are written as reactants.
For example, in our earlier equation, now written without the chloride ions, Zn(s) + 2H+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + H (g) 2 zinc atoms are oxidized to Zn2+.
The half reaction for the oxidation reaction, omitting phase labels, is as follows: Zn → Zn2+ + 2e− This half reaction is balanced in terms of the number of zinc atoms, and it also shows the two electrons that are needed as products to account for the zinc atom losing two Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 293  negative charges to become a 2+ ion.
With half reactions, there is one more item to balance: the overall charge on each side of the reaction.
If you check each side of this reaction, you will note that both sides have a zero net charge.
Hydrogen is reduced in the reaction.
The balanced reduction half reaction is as follows: 2H+ + 2e− → H 2 There are two hydrogen atoms on each side, and the two electrons written as reactants serve to neutralize the 2+ charge on the reactant hydrogen ions.
Again, the overall charge on both sides is zero.
The overall reaction is simply the combination of the two half reactions and is shown by adding them together.
Because we have two electrons on each side of the equation, they can be canceled.
This is the key criterion for a balanced redox reaction: the electrons have to cancel exactly.
If we check the charge on both sides of the equation, we see they are the same—2+.
(In reality, this positive charge is balanced by the negative charges of the chloride ions, which are not included in this reaction because chlorine does not participate in the charge transfer.)
Redox reactions are often balanced by balancing each individual half reaction and then combining the two balanced half reactions.
Sometimes a half reaction must have all of its coefficients multiplied by some integer for all the electrons to cancel.
The following example demonstrates this process.
EXAMPLE 5 Write and balance the redox reaction that has silver ions and aluminum metal as reactants and silver metal and aluminum ions as products.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 294  Solution We start by using symbols of the elements and ions to represent the reaction: Ag+ + Al → Ag + Al3+ The equation looks balanced as it is written.
However, when we compare the overall charges on each side of the equation, we find a charge of +1 on the left but a charge of +3 on the right.
This equation is not properly balanced.
To balance it, let us write the two half reactions.
Silver ions are reduced, and it takes one electron to change Ag+ to Ag: Ag+ + e− → Ag Aluminum is oxidized, losing three electrons to change from Al to Al3+: Al → Al3+ + 3e− To combine these two half reactions and cancel out all the electrons, we need to multiply the silver reduction reaction by 3: Now the equation is balanced, not only in terms of elements but also in terms of charge.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Write and balance the redox reaction that has calcium ions and potassium metal as reactants and calcium metal and potassium ions as products.
Note Potassium has been used as a reducing agent to obtain various metals in their elemental form.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 295  To Your Health: Redox Reactions and Pacemaker Batteries All batteries use redox reactions to supply electricity because electricity is basically a stream of electrons being transferred from one substance to another.
Pacemakers— surgically implanted devices for regulating a person’s heartbeat—are powered by tiny batteries, so the proper operation of a pacemaker depends on a redox reaction.
Pacemakers used to be powered by NiCad batteries, in which nickel and cadmium (hence the name of the battery) react with water according to this redox reaction: Cd(s) + 2NiOOH(s) + 2H O(ℓ) → Cd(OH) (s) + 2Ni(OH) (s) 2 2 2 The cadmium is oxidized, while the nickel atoms in NiOOH are reduced.
Except for the water, all the substances in this reaction are solids, allowing NiCad batteries to be recharged hundreds of times before they stop operating.
Unfortunately, NiCad batteries are fairly heavy batteries to be carrying around in a pacemaker.
Today, the lighter lithium/iodine battery is used instead.
The iodine is dissolved in a solid polymer support, and the overall redox reaction is as follows: 2Li(s) + I (s) → 2LiI(s) 2 Lithium is oxidized, and iodine is reduced.
Although the lithium/iodine battery cannot be recharged, one of its advantages is that it lasts up to 10 years.
Thus, a person with a pacemaker does not have to worry about periodic recharging; about once per decade a person requires minor surgery to replace the pacemaker/battery unit.
Lithium/iodine batteries are also used to power calculators and watches.
Oxidation and reduction can also be defined in terms of changes in composition.
The original meaning of oxidation was “adding oxygen,” so when oxygen is added to a molecule, the molecule is being oxidized.
The reverse is true for reduction: if a molecule loses oxygen atoms, the molecule is being reduced.
For example, the acetaldehyde (CH CHO) molecule takes on an oxygen atom to become acetic acid (CH COOH).
3 3 2CH CHO + O → 2CH COOH 3 2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 296  Thus, acetaldehyde is being oxidized.
Similarly, oxidation and reduction can be defined in terms of the gain or loss of hydrogen atoms.
If a molecule adds hydrogen atoms, it is being reduced.
If a molecule loses hydrogen atoms, the molecule is being oxidized.
For example, in the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol (CH CH OH), hydrogen atoms are added to acetaldehyde, so 3 2 the acetaldehyde is being reduced: CH CHO + H → CH CH OH 3 2 3 2 EXAMPLE 6 In each conversion, indicate whether oxidation or reduction is occurring.

N → NH 2 3 2.
CH CH OHCH → CH COCH 3 2 3 3 3 3.

Hydrogen is being added to the original reactant molecule, so reduction is occurring.

Identify oxidation-reduction reactions with organic compounds.
Oxidation-reduction reactions are of central importance in organic chemistry and biochemistry.
The burning of fuels that provides the energy to maintain our civilization and the metabolism of foods that furnish the energy that keeps us alive both involve redox reactions.
All combustion reactions are also redox reactions.
A typical combustion reaction is the burning of methane, the principal component of natural gas (Figure 5.5 "The Burning of Natural Gas").
CH + 2O → CO + 2H O 4 2 2 2 In respiration, the biochemical process by which the oxygen we inhale in air oxidizes foodstuffs to carbon dioxide and water, redox reactions provide energy to living cells.
A typical respiratory reaction is the oxidation of glucose (C H O ), the simple sugar we 6 12 6 encountered in the chapter-opening essay that makes up the diet of yeast: C H O + 6O → 6CO + 6H O 6 12 6 2 2 2 Organic chemists use a variety of redox reactions.
For example, potassium dichromate (K Cr O ) is a common oxidizing agent that can be used to oxidize alcohols (symbolized 2 2 7 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 300  by the general formula ROH).
The product of the reaction depends on the location of the OH functional group in the alcohol molecule, the relative proportions of alcohol and the dichromate ion, and reaction conditions such as temperature.
If the OH group is attached to a terminal carbon atom and the product is distilled off as it forms, the product is an aldehyde, which has a terminal carbonyl group (C=O) and is often written as RCHO.
One example is the reaction used by the Breathalyzer to detect ethyl alcohol (C H OH) in a person’s breath: 2 5 3C H OH + Cr O 2− + 8H+ → 3CH CHO + 2Cr3+ + 7H O 2 5 2 7 3 2 If the product acetaldehyde (CH CHO) is not removed as it forms, it is further oxidized 3 to acetic acid (CH COOH).
In this case, the overall reaction is as follows: 3 3C H OH + 2Cr O 2− + 16H+ → 3CH COOH + 4Cr3+ + 11H O 2 5 2 7 3 2 In this reaction, the chromium atom is reduced from Cr O 2− to Cr3+, and the ethanol is 2 7 oxidized to acetic acid.
When the OH group of the alcohol is bonded to an interior carbon atom, the oxidation of an alcohol will produce a ketone.
(The formulas of ketones are often written as RCOR, and the carbon–oxygen bond is a double bond.)
The simplest ketone is derived from 2- propanol (CH CHOHCH ).
It is the common solvent acetone [(CH ) CO], which is used 3 3 3 2 in varnishes, lacquers, rubber cement, and nail polish remover.
Acetone can be formed by the following redox reaction: 3CH CHOHCH + Cr O 2− + 8H+ → 3(CH ) CO + 2Cr3+ + 7H O 3 3 2 7 3 2 2 As we have just seen, aldehydes and ketones can be formed by the oxidation of alcohols.
Conversely, aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to alcohols.
Reduction of the carbonyl group is important in living organisms.
For example, in anaerobic metabolism, in which biochemical processes take place in the absence of oxygen, pyruvic acid (CH COCOOH) is reduced to lactic acid (CH CHOHCOOH) in the muscles.
3 3 CH COCOOH → CH CHOHCOOH 3 3 (Pyruvic acid is both a carboxylic acid and a ketone; only the ketone group is reduced.)
The buildup of lactic acid during vigorous exercise is responsible in large part for the fatigue that we experience.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 301  In food chemistry, the substances known as antioxidants are reducing agents.
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C; C H O ) is thought to retard potentially damaging oxidation of 6 8 6 living cells.
In the process, it is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (C H O ).
In the 6 6 6 stomach, ascorbic acid reduces the nitrite ion (NO −) to nitric oxide (NO): 2 C H O + 2H+ + 2NO − → C H O + 2H O + 2NO 6 8 6 2 6 6 6 2 If this reaction did not occur, nitrite ions from foods would oxidize the iron in hemoglobin, destroying its ability to carry oxygen.
Tocopherol (vitamin E) is also an antioxidant.
In the body, vitamin E is thought to act by scavenging harmful by-products of metabolism, such as the highly reactive molecular fragments called free radicals.
In foods, vitamin E acts to prevent fats from being oxidized and thus becoming rancid.
Vitamin C is also a good antioxidant.
Finally, and of greatest importance, green plants carry out the redox reaction that makes possible almost all life on Earth.
They do this through a process calledphotosynthesis, in which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose (C H O ).
The synthesis of 6 12 6 glucose requires a variety of proteins called enzymes and a green pigment called chlorophyll that converts sunlight into chemical energy (Figure 5.7 "Life on Earth").
The overall change that occurs is as follows: 6CO + 6H O → C H O + 6O 2 2 6 12 6 2 In this reaction, carbon dioxide is reduced to glucose, and water is oxidized to oxygen gas.
Other reactions convert the glucose to more complex carbohydrates, plant proteins, and oils.

Scientific laws are general statements that apply to a wide variety of circumstances.
One important law in chemistry is the law of conservation of matter, which states that in any closed system, the amount of matter stays constant.
Chemical equations are used to represent chemical reactions.
Reactants change chemically into products.
The law of conservation of matter requires that a proper chemical equation be balanced.
Coefficients are used to show the relative numbers of reactant and product molecules.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 304  In stoichiometry, quantities of reactants and/or products can be related to each other using the balanced chemical equation.
The coefficients in a balanced chemical reaction are used to devise the proper ratios that relate the number of molecules of one substance to the number of molecules of another substance.
Chemical reactions can be classified by type.
Combination reactions (also called composition reactions) make a substance from other substances.
Decomposition reactions break one substance down into multiple substances.
Combustion reactions combine molecular oxygen with the atoms of another reactant.
Oxidation reactions are reactions in which an atom loses an electron.
Reduction reactions are reactions in which an atom gains an electron.
These two processes always occur together, so they are collectively referred to as oxidation- reduction (or redox) reactions.
The species being oxidized it called the reducing agent, while the species being reduced is the oxidizing agent.
Alternate definitions of oxidation and reduction focus on the gain or loss of oxygen atoms, or the loss or gain of hydrogen atoms.
Redox reactions are easily balanced if the overall reaction is first separated into half reactions, which are individually balanced.
Oxidation-reduction reactions are common in organic and biological chemistry.
Respiration, the process by which we inhale and metabolize oxygen, is a series of redox reactions.
In the absence of oxygen, redox reactions still occur in a process called anaerobic metabolism.
Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid also play a part in the human diet, acting as reducing agents in various biochemical reactions.
Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert water and carbon dioxide to glucose, is also based on redox reactions.

of water, joined to 28 grs.
of charcoal, have combined in such a way as to form 100 grs.
of carbonic acid, and 13.7 grs.
of a particular gas capable of being burnt.
(Bold emphasis added.)
In this paragraph from the Elements of Chemistry, Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94) is explaining an experiment in which he was trying to demonstrate that water is not an element but instead is composed of hydrogen (the gas “capable of being burnt”) and oxygen.
This is a historical account of a groundbreaking experiment and illustrates the importance of amounts in chemistry.
Lavoisier was pointing out that the initial total mass of water and charcoal, 85.7 g plus 28 g, equals the final total mass of carbonic acid and the particular gas, 100 g plus 13.7 g. In this way, he was illustrating the law of conservation of matter, which was introduced in Chapter 5 "Introduction to Chemical Reactions".
It is another way of saying that amounts matter.
Amounts do matter and in a variety of circumstances.
The chapter-opening essay in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement" tells the story of a nurse who mistakenly read “2–3 mg” as “23 mg” and administered the higher and potentially fatal dose of morphine to a child.
Food scientists who work in test kitchens must keep track of specific amounts of ingredients as they develop new products for us to eat.
Quality control technicians measure amounts of substances in manufactured products to ensure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 309  that the products meet company or government standards.
Supermarkets routinely weigh meat and produce and charge consumers by the ounce or the pound.
So far, we have talked about chemical reactions in terms of individual atoms and molecules.
Although this works, most of the reactions occurring around us involve much larger amounts of chemicals.
Even a tiny sample of a substance will contain millions, billions, or a hundred billion billions of atoms and molecules.
How do we compare amounts of substances to each other in chemical terms when it is so difficult to count to a hundred billion billion?
Actually, there are ways to do this, which we will explore in this chapter.
In doing so, we will increase our understanding of stoichiometry, which is the study of the numerical relationships between the reactants and the products in a balanced chemical reaction.
6.1 The Mole LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Define the mole unit.
Figure 6.1 "Water Molecules" shows that we need 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom to make 1 water molecule.
If we want to make 2 water molecules, we will need 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms.
If we want to make 5 molecules of water, we need 10 hydrogen atoms and 5 oxygen atoms.
The ratio of atoms we will need to make any number of water molecules is the same: 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom.
Figure 6.1 Water Molecules Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 310  The ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms used to make water molecules is always 2:1, no matter how many water molecules are being made.
One problem we have, however, is that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to organize atoms one at a time.
As stated in the introduction, we deal with billions of atoms at a time.
How can we keep track of so many atoms (and molecules) at a time?
We do it by using mass rather than by counting individual atoms.
A hydrogen atom has a mass of approximately 1 u.
An oxygen atom has a mass of approximately 16 u.
The ratio of the mass of an oxygen atom to the mass of a hydrogen atom is therefore approximately 16:1.
If we have 2 atoms of each element, the ratio of their masses is approximately 32:2, which reduces to 16:1—the same ratio.
If we have 12 atoms of each element, the ratio of their total masses is approximately (12 × 16):(12 × 1), or 192:12, which also reduces to 16:1.
If we have 100 atoms of each element, the ratio of the masses is approximately 1,600:100, which again reduces to 16:1.
As long as we have equal numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, the ratio of the masses will always be 16:1.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 311  The same consistency is seen when ratios of the masses of other elements are compared.
For example, the ratio of the masses of silicon atoms to equal numbers of hydrogen atoms is always approximately 28:1, while the ratio of the masses of calcium atoms to equal numbers of lithium atoms is approximately 40:7.
So we have established that the masses of atoms are constant with respect to each other, as long as we have the same number of each type of atom.
Consider a more macroscopic example.
If a sample contains 40 g of Ca, this sample has the same number of atoms as there are in a sample of 7 g of Li.
What we need, then, is a number that represents a convenient quantity of atoms so we can relate macroscopic quantities of substances.
Clearly even 12 atoms are too few because atoms themselves are so small.
We need a number that represents billions and billions of atoms.
Chemists use the term mole to represent a large number of atoms or molecules.
Just as a dozen implies 12 things, a mole (mol) represents 6.022 × 1023 things.
The number 6.022 × 1023, called Avogadro’s number after the 19th-century chemist Amedeo Avogadro, is the number we use in chemistry to represent macroscopic amounts of atoms and molecules.
Thus, if we have 6.022 × 1023 O atoms, we say we have 1 mol of O atoms.
If we have 2 mol of Na atoms, we have 2 × (6.022 × 1023) Na atoms, or 1.2044 × 1024 Na atoms.
Similarly, if we have 0.5 mol of benzene (C H ) molecules, we have 0.5 × 6 6 (6.022 × 1023) C H molecules, or 3.011 × 1023 C H molecules.
6 6 6 6 Note A mole represents a very large number!
If 1 mol of quarters were stacked in a column, it could stretch back and forth between Earth and the sun 6.8 billion times.
Notice that we are applying the mole unit to different types of chemical entities.
In these examples, we cited moles of atoms and moles of molecules.
The word mole represents a number of things—6.022 × 1023 of them—but does not by itself specify what “they” are.
They can be atoms, formula units (of ionic compounds), or molecules.
That information still needs to be specified.
Because 1 H molecule contains 2 H atoms, 1 mol of H molecules (6.022 × 2 2 1023molecules) has 2 mol of H atoms.
Using formulas to indicate how many atoms of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 312  each element we have in a substance, we can relate the number of moles of molecules to the number of moles of atoms.
For example, in 1 mol of ethanol (C H O), we can 2 6 construct the following relationships (Table 6.1 "Molecular Relationships"): Table 6.1 Molecular Relationships The following example illustrates how we can use these relationships as conversion factors.
EXAMPLE 1 If a sample consists of 2.5 mol of ethanol (C H O), how many moles of carbon atoms, 2 6 hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms does it have?
Solution Using the relationships in Table 6.1 "Molecular Relationships", we apply the appropriate conversion factor for each element: Note how the unit mol C H O molecules cancels algebraically.
Similar equations can be 2 6 constructed for determining the number of H and O atoms: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 313  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
If a sample contains 6.75 mol of Na SO , how many moles of sodium atoms, sulfur 2 4 atoms, and oxygen atoms does it have?

EXAMPLE 2 How many formula units are present in 2.34 mol of NaCl?
How many ions are in 2.34 mol?
Solution Typically in a problem like this, we start with what we are given and apply the appropriate conversion factor.
Here, we are given a quantity of 2.34 mol of NaCl, to which we can apply the definition of a mole as a conversion factor: Because there are two ions per formula unit, there are in the sample.

Learn how the masses of moles of atoms and molecules are expressed.
Now that we have introduced the mole and practiced using it as a conversion factor, we ask the obvious question: why is the mole that particular number of things?
Why is it 6.022 × 1023 and not 1 × 1023 or even 1 × 1020?
The number in a mole, Avogadro’s number, is related to the relative sizes of the atomic mass unit and gram mass units.
Whereas one hydrogen atom has a mass of approximately 1 u, 1 mol of H atoms has a mass of approximately 1 gram.
And whereas one sodium atom has an approximate mass of 23 u, 1 mol of Na atoms has an approximate mass of 23 grams.
One mole of a substance has the same mass in grams that one atom or molecule has in atomic mass units.
The numbers in the periodic table that we identified as the atomic masses of the atoms not only tell us the mass of one atom in u but also tell us the mass of 1 mol of atoms in grams.
Note One mole of a substance has the same mass in grams that one atom or molecule has in atomic mass units.

One mole of Al atoms has a mass in grams that is numerically equivalent to the atomic mass of aluminum.

According to the periodic table, 1 mol of U has a mass of 238.03 g, so the mass of 2 mol is twice that, or 476.06 g. SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE What is the mass of each quantity?

5 mol of Br atoms The mole concept can be extended to masses of formula units and molecules as well.
The mass of 1 mol of molecules (or formula units) in grams is numerically equivalent to the mass of one molecule (or formula unit) in atomic mass units.
For example, a single molecule of O has a mass of 32.00 u, and 1 mol of O molecules has a mass of 32.00 g. 2 2 As with atomic mass unit–based masses, to obtain the mass of 1 mol of a substance, we simply sum the masses of the individual atoms in the formula of that substance.
The mass of 1 mol of a substance is referred to as its molar mass, whether the substance is an element, an ionic compound, or a covalent compound.

Multiplying the molar mass of each atom by the number of atoms of that type in bilirubin’s formula and adding the results, we get The mass of 1 mol of bilirubin is 584.69 g. SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE What is the mass of 1 mol of each substance?

In formulas with polyatomic ions in parentheses, the subscript outside the parentheses is applied to every atom inside the parentheses.
For example, the molar mass of Ba(OH) requires the sum of 1 mass of Ba, 2 masses of O, 2 and 2 masses of H: 1 Ba molar mass: 1 × 137.33 g = 137.33 g 2 O molar mass: 2 × 16.00 g = 32.00 g 2 H molar mass: 2 × 1.01 g = 2.02 g Total: 171.35 g Because molar mass is defined as the mass for 1 mol of a substance, we can refer to molar mass as grams per mole (g/mol).
The division sign (/) implies “per,” and “1” is implied in the denominator.
Thus, the molar mass of bilirubin can be expressed as 584.05 g/mol, which is read as “five hundred eighty four point zero five grams per mole.” CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.

Convert quantities between mass units and mole units.
Example 3 in Section 6.2 "Atomic and Molar Masses" stated that the mass of 2 mol of U is twice the molar mass of uranium.
Such a straightforward exercise does not require any formal mathematical treatment.
Many questions concerning mass are not so straightforward, however, and require some mathematical manipulations.
The simplest type of manipulation using molar mass as a conversion factor is a mole- mass conversion (or its reverse, a mass-mole conversion).
In such a conversion, we use the molar mass of a substance as a conversion factor to convert mole units into mass units (or, conversely, mass units into mole units).
We established that 1 mol of Al has a mass of 26.98 g (Example 3 in Section 6.2 "Atomic and Molar Masses").
Stated mathematically, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 322  1 mol Al = 26.98 g Al We can divide both sides of this expression by either side to get one of two possible conversion factors: The first conversion factor can be used to convert from mass to moles, and the second converts from moles to mass.
Both can be used to solve problems that would be hard to do “by eye.” Note The algebra skills we are using here are the same skills that we used in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement" to perform unit conversions.
EXAMPLE 5 What is the mass of 3.987 mol of Al?
Solution The first step in a conversion problem is to decide what conversion factor to use.
Because we are starting with mole units, we want a conversion factor that will cancel the mole unit and introduce the unit for mass in the numerator.
Therefore, we should use the conversion factor.
We start with the given quantity and multiply by the conversion factor: Note that the mol units cancel algebraically.
(The quantity 3.987 mol is understood to be in the numerator of a fraction that has 1 in the unwritten denominator.)
Canceling and solving gives Our final answer is expressed to four significant figures.

EXAMPLE 6 A biochemist needs 0.00655 mol of bilirubin (C H N O ) for an experiment.
How many 33 36 4 6 grams of bilirubin will that be?
Solution To convert from moles to mass, we need the molar mass of bilirubin, which we can determine from its chemical formula: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 325  The molar mass of bilirubin is 584.69 g. (We did this calculation in Example 4 inSection 6.2 "Atomic and Molar Masses".)
Using the relationship 1 mol bilirubin = 584.69 g bilirubin we can construct the appropriate conversion factor for determining how many grams there are in 0.00655 mol.
Following the steps from Figure 6.3 "A Flowchart Illustrating the Steps in Performing a Unit Conversion": The mol bilirubin unit cancels.
The biochemist needs 3.83 g of bilirubin.

The accompanying table lists the RDIs for minerals, both in mass and moles, assuming a 2,000-calorie daily diet.

First, the needs of men and women for some minerals are different.
The extreme case is for iron; women need over twice as much as men do.
In all other cases where there is a different RDI, men need more than women.
Second, the amounts of the various minerals needed on a daily basis vary widely—both on a mass scale and a molar scale.
The average person needs 0.1 mol of Na a day, which Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 327  is about 2.5 g. On the other hand, a person needs only about 25–35 µg of Cr per day, which is under one millionth of a mole.
As small as this amount is, a deficiency of chromium in the diet can lead to diabetes-like symptoms or neurological problems, especially in the extremities (hands and feet).
For some minerals, the body does not require much to keep itself operating properly.
Although a properly balanced diet will provide all the necessary minerals, some people take dietary supplements.
However, too much of a good thing, even minerals, is not good.
Exposure to too much chromium, for example, causes a skin irritation, and certain forms of chromium are known to cause cancer (as presented in the movie Erin Brockovich).

Use a balanced chemical reaction to determine molar relationships between the substances.
In Chapter 5 "Introduction to Chemical Reactions", you learned to balance chemical equations by comparing the numbers of each type of atom in the reactants and products.
The coefficients in front of the chemical formulas represent the numbers of molecules or formula units (depending on the type of substance).
Here, we will extend the meaning of the coefficients in a chemical equation.
Consider the simple chemical equation 2H + O → 2H O 2 2 2 The convention for writing balanced chemical equations is to use the lowest whole- number ratio for the coefficients.
However, the equation is balanced as long as the coefficients are in a 2:1:2 ratio.
For example, this equation is also balanced if we write it as 4H + 2O → 4H O 2 2 2 The ratio of the coefficients is 4:2:4, which reduces to 2:1:2.
The equation is also balanced if we were to write it as 22H + 11O → 22H O 2 2 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 330  because 22:11:22 also reduces to 2:1:2.
Suppose we want to use larger numbers.
Consider the following coefficients: 12.044 × 1023 H + 6.022 × 1023 O → 12.044 × 1023 H O 2 2 2 These coefficients also have the ratio 2:1:2 (check it and see), so this equation is balanced.
But 6.022 × 1023 is 1 mol, while 12.044 × 1023 is 2 mol (and the number is written that way to make this more obvious), so we can simplify this version of the equation by writing it as 2 mol H + 1 mol O → 2 mol H O 2 2 2 We can leave out the word mol and not write the 1 coefficient (as is our habit), so the final form of the equation, still balanced, is 2H + O → 2H O 2 2 2 Now we interpret the coefficients as referring to molar amounts, not individual molecules.
The lesson?
Balanced chemical equations are balanced not only at the molecular level but also in terms of molar amounts of reactants and products.
Thus, we can read this reaction as “two moles of hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of water.” By the same token, the ratios we constructed in Chapter 5 "Introduction to Chemical Reactions" can also be constructed in terms of moles rather than molecules.
For the reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water, for example, we can construct the following ratios: We can use these ratios to determine what amount of a substance, in moles, will react with or produce a given number of moles of a different substance.
The study of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 331  numerical relationships between the reactants and the products in balanced chemical reactions is called stoichiometry.
EXAMPLE 7 How many moles of oxygen react with hydrogen to produce 27.6 mol of H O?
The 2 balanced equation is as follows: 2H + O → 2H O 2 2 2 Solution Because we are dealing with quantities of H O and O , we will use a ratio that relates 2 2 those two substances.
Because we are given an amount of H O and want to determine 2 an amount of O , we will use the ratio that has H O in the denominator (so it cancels) 2 2 and O in the numerator (so it is introduced in the answer).
Thus, 2 To produce 27.6 mol of H O, 13.8 mol of O react.

We have established that a balanced chemical equation is balanced in terms of moles as well as atoms or molecules.
We have used balanced equations to set up ratios, now in terms of moles of materials, that we can use as conversion factors to answer stoichiometric questions, such as how many moles of substance A react with so many moles of reactant B.
We can extend this technique even further.
Recall that we can relate a molar amount to a mass amount using molar mass.
We can use that ability to answer stoichiometry questions in terms of the masses of a particular substance, in addition to moles.
We do this using the following sequence: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 335  Collectively, these conversions are called mole-mass calculations.
As an example, consider the balanced chemical equation Fe O + 3SO → Fe (SO ) 2 3 3 2 4 3 If we have 3.59 mol of Fe O , how many grams of SO can react with it?
Using the mole- 2 3 3 mass calculation sequence, we can determine the required mass of SO in two steps.
3 First, we construct the appropriate molar ratio, determined from the balanced chemical equation, to calculate the number of moles of SO needed.
Then using the molar mass of 3 SO as a conversion factor, we determine the mass that this number of moles of SO has.
3 3 The first step resembles the exercises we did in Section 6.4 "Mole-Mole Relationships in Chemical Reactions".
As usual, we start with the quantity we were given: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 336  The mol Fe O units cancel, leaving mol SO unit.
Now, we take this answer and convert 2 3 3 it to grams of SO , using the molar mass of SO as the conversion factor: 3 3 Our final answer is expressed to three significant figures.
Thus, in a two-step process, we find that 862 g of SO will react with 3.59 mol of Fe O .
Many problems of this type can 3 2 3 be answered in this manner.
The same two-step problem can also be worked out in a single line, rather than as two separate steps, as follows: We get exactly the same answer when combining all the math steps together as we do when we calculate one step at a time.
EXAMPLE 8 How many grams of CO are produced if 2.09 mol of HCl are reacted according to this 2 balanced chemical equation?
CaCO + 2HCl → CaCl + CO + H O 3 2 2 2 Solution Our strategy will be to convert from moles of HCl to moles of CO and then from moles 2 of CO to grams of CO .
We will need the molar mass of CO , which is 44.01 g/mol.
2 2 2 Performing these two conversions in a single-line gives 46.0 g of CO : 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 337  The molar ratio between CO and HCl comes from the balanced chemical equation.
2 SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
How many grams of glucose (C H O ) are produced if 17.3 mol of H O are reacted 6 12 6 2 according to this balanced chemical equation?
6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 It is a small step from mole-mass calculations to mass-mass calculations.
If we start with a known mass of one substance in a chemical reaction (instead of a known number of moles), we can calculate the corresponding masses of other substances in the reaction.
The first step in this case is to convert the known mass into moles, using the substance’s molar mass as the conversion factor.
Then—and only then—we use the balanced chemical equation to construct a conversion factor to convert that quantity to moles of another substance, which in turn can be converted to a corresponding mass.
Sequentially, the process is as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 338  This three-part process can be carried out in three discrete steps or combined into a single calculation that contains three conversion factors.
The following example illustrates both techniques.
EXAMPLE 9 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 339  Methane can react with elemental chlorine to make carbon tetrachloride (CCl ).
The 4 balanced chemical equation is as follows: CH + 4Cl → CCl + 4HCl 4 2 4 How many grams of HCl are produced by the reaction of 100.0 g of CH ?
4 Solution First, let us work the problem in stepwise fashion.
We begin by converting the mass of CH to moles of CH , using the molar mass of CH (16.05 g/mol) as the conversion factor: 4 4 4 Note that we inverted the molar mass so that the gram units cancel, giving us an answer in moles.
Next, we use the balanced chemical equation to determine the ratio of moles CH and moles HCl and convert our first result into moles of HCl: 4 Finally, we use the molar mass of HCl (36.46 g/mol) as a conversion factor to calculate the mass of 24.92 mol of HCl: In each step, we have limited the answer to the proper number of significant figures.
If desired, we can do all three conversions on a single line: This final answer is slightly different from our first answer because only the final answer is restricted to the proper number of significant figures.
In the first answer, we limited Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 340  each intermediate quantity to the proper number of significant figures.
As you can see, both answers are essentially the same.

ANSWERS 1. mol first substance → mol second substance → mass second substance 2. mass first substance → mol first substance → mol second substance → mass second substance To Your Health: The Synthesis of Taxol Taxol is a powerful anticancer drug that was originally extracted from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia).
As you can see from the accompanying figure, taxol is a very complicated molecule, with a molecular formula of C H NO .
Isolating taxol from its 47 51 14 natural source presents certain challenges, mainly that the Pacific yew is a slow-growing tree, and the equivalent of six trees must be harvested to provide enough taxol to treat a single patient.
Although related species of yew trees also produce taxol in small Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 341  amounts, there is significant interest in synthesizing this complex molecule in the laboratory.
After a 20-year effort, two research groups announced the complete laboratory synthesis of taxol in 1994.
However, each synthesis required over 30 separate chemical reactions, with an overall efficiency of less than 0.05%.
To put this in perspective, to obtain a single 300 mg dose of taxol, you would have to begin with 600 g of starting material.
To treat the 26,000 women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year with one dose, almost 16,000 kg (over 17 tons) of starting material must be converted to taxol.
Taxol is also used to treat breast cancer, with which 200,000 women in the United States are diagnosed every year.
This only increases the amount of starting material needed.
Clearly, there is intense interest in increasing the overall efficiency of the taxol synthesis.
An improved synthesis not only will be easier but also will produce less waste materials, which will allow more people to take advantage of this potentially life-saving drug.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 345  Chemical reactions relate quantities of reactants and products.
Chemists use themole unit to represent 6.022 × 1023 things, whether the things are atoms of elements or molecules of compounds.
This number, called Avogadro’s number, is important because this number of atoms or molecules has the same mass in grams as one atom or molecule has in atomic mass units.
Molar masses of substances can be determined by summing the appropriate masses from the periodic table; the final molar mass will have units of grams.
Because one mole of a substance will have a certain mass, we can use that relationship to construct conversion factors that will convert a mole amount into a mass amount, or vice versa.
Such mole-mass conversions typically take one algebraic step.
Chemical reactions list reactants and products in molar amounts, not just molecular amounts.
We can use the coefficients of a balanced chemical equation to relate moles of one substance in the reaction to moles of other substances (stoichiometry).
In a mole- mass calculation, we relate the number of moles of one substance to the mass of another substance.
In a mass-mass calculation, we relate the mass of one substance to the mass of another substance.

Some of the energy from metabolism is in the form of heat, and some animals use this heat to regulate their body temperatures.
Such warm-blooded animals are called endotherms.
In endotherms, problems with metabolism can lead to fluctuations in body temperature.
When humans get sick, for instance, our body temperatures can rise higher than normal; we develop a fever.
When food is scarce (especially in winter), some endotherms go into a state of controlled decreased metabolism called hibernation.
During hibernation, the body temperatures of these endotherms actually decrease.
In hot weather or when feverish, endotherms will pant or sweat to rid their bodies of excess heat.
Table 7.1 Average Body Temperatures of Selected Endotherms Endotherm Body Temperature (°F) Body Temperature (°C) bird up to 110 up to 43.5 cat 101.5 38.6 dog 102 38.9 horse 100.0 37.8 human 98.6 37.0 pig 102.5 39.2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 349  Ectotherms, sometimes called cold-blooded animals, do not use the energy of metabolism to regulate body temperature.
Instead, they depend on external energy sources, such as sunlight.
Fish, for example, will seek out water of different temperatures to regulate body temperature.
The amount of energy available is directly related to the metabolic rate of the animal.
When energy is scarce, ectotherms may also hibernate.
The connection between metabolism and body temperature is a reminder that energy and chemical reactions are intimately related.
A basic understanding of this relationship is especially important when those chemical reactions occur within our own bodies.
Energy is a vital component of the world around us.
Nearly every physical and chemical process, including all the chemical reactions discussed in previous chapters, occurs with a simultaneous energy change.
In this chapter, we will explore the nature of energy and how energy and chemistry are related.
7.1 Energy and Its Units LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Define energy and heat.
Energy is the ability to do work.
You can understand what this means by thinking about yourself when you feel “energetic.” You feel ready to go—to jump up and get something done.
When you have a lot of energy, you can perform a lot of work.
By contrast, if you do not feel energetic, you have very little desire to do much of anything.
This description is not only applicable to you but also to all physical and chemical processes.
The quantity of work that can be done is related to the quantity of energy available to do it.
Energy can be transferred from one object to another if the objects have different temperatures.
The transfer of energy due to temperature differences is called heat.
For Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 350  example, if you hold an ice cube in your hand, the ice cube slowly melts as energy in the form of heat is transferred from your hand to the ice.
As your hand loses energy, it starts to feel cold.
Because of their interrelationships, energy, work, and heat have the same units.
The SI unit of energy, work, and heat is the joule (J).
A joule is a tiny amount of energy.
For example, it takes about 4 J to warm 1 mL of H O by 1°C.
Many processes occur with 2 energy changes in thousands of joules, so the kilojoule (kJ) is also common.
Another unit of energy, used widely in the health professions and everyday life, is the calorie (cal).
The calorie was initially defined as the amount of energy needed to warm 1 g of H O by 1°C, but in modern times, the calorie is related directly to the joule, as 2 follows: 1 cal = 4.184 J We can use this relationship to convert quantities of energy, work, or heat from one unit to another.
The calorie is used in nutrition to express the energy content of foods.
However, because a calorie is a rather small quantity, nutritional energies are usually expressed in kilocalories (kcal), also called Calories (capitalized; Cal).
For example, a candy bar may provide 120 Cal (nutritional calories) of energy, which is equal to 120,000 cal.
Proteins and carbohydrates supply 4 kcal/g, while fat supplies 9 kcal/g.
Note Although the joule is the proper SI unit for energy, we will use the calorie or the kilocalorie (or Calorie) in this chapter because they are widely used by health professionals.
EXAMPLE 1 The energy content of a single serving of bread is 70.0 Cal.
What is the energy content in calories?
In joules?
Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 351  This is a simple conversion-factor problem.
Using the relationship 1 Cal = 1,000 cal, we can answer the first question with a one-step conversion: Then we convert calories into joules and then kilojoules The energy content of bread comes mostly from carbohydrates.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
The energy content of one cup of honey is 1,030 Cal.
What is its energy content in calories and joules?
To Your Health: Energy Expenditures Most health professionals agree that exercise is a valuable component of a healthy lifestyle.
Exercise not only strengthens the body and develops muscle tone but also expends energy.
After obtaining energy from the foods we eat, we need to expend that energy somehow, or our bodies will store it in unhealthy ways.
Like the energy content in food, the energy expenditures of exercise are also reported in kilocalories, usually kilocalories per hour of exercise.
These expenditures vary widely, from about 440 kcal/h for walking at a speed of 4 mph to 1,870 kcal/h for mountain biking at 20 mph.
Table 7.2 "Energy Expenditure of a 180-Pound Person during Selected Exercises" lists the energy expenditure for a variety of exercises.

Relate heat transfer to temperature change.
Heat is a familiar manifestation of energy.
When we touch a hot object, energy flows from the hot object into our fingers, and we perceive that incoming energy as the object being “hot.” Conversely, when we hold an ice cube in our palms, energy flows from our Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 355  hand into the ice cube, and we perceive that loss of energy as “cold.” In both cases, the temperature of the object is different from the temperature of our hand, so we can conclude that differences in temperatures are the ultimate cause of heat transfer.
Suppose we consider the transfer of heat from the opposite perspective—namely, what happens to a system that gains or loses heat?
Generally, the system’s temperature changes.
(We will address a few exceptions later.)
The greater the original temperature difference, the greater the transfer of heat, and the greater the ultimate temperature change.
The relationship between the amount of heat transferred and the temperature change can be written as heat ∝ ΔT where ∝ means “is proportional to” and ΔT is the change in temperature of the system.
Any change in a variable is always defined as “the final value minus the initial value” of the variable, so ΔT is T − T .
In addition, the greater the mass of an object, the final initial more heat is needed to change its temperature.
We can include a variable representing mass (m) to the proportionality as follows: heat ∝ mΔT To change this proportionality into an equality, we include a proportionality constant.
The proportionality constant is called the specific heat, symbolized by c: heat = mcΔT Every substance has a characteristic specific heat, which is reported in units of cal/g·°C or cal/g·K, depending on the units used to express ΔT.
The specific heat of a substance is the amount of energy that must be transferred to or from 1 g of that substance to change its temperature by 1°.
Table 7.3 "Specific Heats of Selected Substances" lists the specific heats for various materials.
Table 7.3 Specific Heats of Selected Substances Substance c (cal/g·°C) aluminum (Al) 0.215 aluminum oxide (Al O ) 0.305 2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 356  Substance c (cal/g·°C) benzene (C H ) 0.251 6 6 copper (Cu) 0.092 ethanol (C H O) 0.578 2 6 hexane (C H ) 0.394 6 14 hydrogen (H ) 3.419 2 ice [H O(s)] 0.492 2 iron (Fe) 0.108 iron(III) oxide (Fe O ) 0.156 2 3 mercury (Hg) 0.033 oxygen (O ) 0.219 2 sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.207 steam [H O(g)] 0.488 2 water [H O(ℓ)] 1.00 2 Note The proportionality constant c is sometimes referred to as the specific heat capacity or (incorrectly) the heat capacity.
The direction of heat flow is not shown in heat = mcΔT.
If energy goes into an object, the total energy of the object increases, and the values of heat ΔT are positive.
If energy is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 357  coming out of an object, the total energy of the object decreases, and the values of heat and ΔT are negative.
EXAMPLE 2 What quantity of heat is transferred when a 150.0 g block of iron metal is heated from 25.0°C to 73.3°C?
What is the direction of heat flow?
Solution We can use heat = mcΔT to determine the amount of heat, but first we need to determine ΔT.
Because the final temperature of the iron is 73.3°C and the initial temperature is 25.0°C, ΔT is as follows: ΔT = T − T = 73.3°C − 25.0°C = 48.3°C final initial The mass is given as 150.0 g, and Table 7.3 "Specific Heats of Selected Substances"gives the specific heat of iron as 0.108 cal/g·°C.
Substitute the known values into heat = mcΔT and solve for amount of heat: Note how the gram and °C units cancel algebraically, leaving only the calorie unit, which is a unit of heat.
Because the temperature of the iron increases, energy (as heat) must be flowing into the metal.

EXAMPLE 3 A 10.3 g sample of a reddish-brown metal gave off 71.7 cal of heat as its temperature decreased from 97.5°C to 22.0°C.
What is the specific heat of the metal?
Can you identify the metal from the data in Table 7.3 "Specific Heats of Selected Substances"?
Solution The question gives us the heat, the final and initial temperatures, and the mass of the sample.
The value of ΔT is as follows: ΔT = T − T = 22.0°C − 97.5°C = −75.5°C final initial If the sample gives off 71.7 cal, it loses energy (as heat), so the value of heat is written as a negative number, −71.7 cal.
Substitute the known values into heat = mcΔT and solve for c: −71.7 cal = (10.3 g)(c)(−75.5°C) c = 0.0923 cal/g·°C This value for specific heat is very close to that given for copper in Table 7.3 "Specific Heats of Selected Substances".

0.496 cal/g·°C 7.3 Phase Changes LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Determine the heat associated with a phase change.
Depending on the surrounding conditions, normal matter usually exists as one of three phases: solid, liquid, or gas.
A phase change is a physical process in which a substance goes from one phase to another.
Usually the change occurs when adding or removing heat at a particular temperature, known as the melting point or the boiling point of the substance.
The melting point is the temperature at which the substance goes from a solid to a liquid (or from a liquid to a solid).
The boiling point is the temperature at which a substance goes from a liquid to a gas (or from a gas to a liquid).
The nature of the phase change depends on the direction of the heat transfer.
Heat going into a substance changes it from a solid to a liquid or a liquid to a gas.
Removing heat from a substance changes a gas to a liquid or a liquid to a solid.
Two key points are worth emphasizing.
First, at a substance’s melting point or boiling point, two phases can exist simultaneously.
Take water (H O) as an example.
On the 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 362  Celsius scale, H O has a melting point of 0°C and a boiling point of 100°C.
At 0°C, both 2 the solid and liquid phases of H O can coexist.
However, if heat is added, some of the 2 solid H O will melt and turn into liquid H O.
If heat is removed, the opposite happens: 2 2 some of the liquid H O turns into solid H O.
A similar process can occur at 100°C: 2 2 adding heat increases the amount of gaseous H O, while removing heat increases the 2 amount of liquid H O (Figure 7.2 "The Boiling Point of Water").
2 Note Water is a good substance to use as an example because many people are already familiar with it.
Other substances have melting points and boiling points as well.
Second, the temperature of a substance does not change as the substance goes from one phase to another.
In other words, phase changes are isothermal (isothermal means “constant temperature”).
Again, consider H O as an example.
Solid water (ice) can exist 2 at 0°C.
If heat is added to ice at 0°C, some of the solid changes phase to make liquid, which is also at 0°C.
Remember, the solid and liquid phases of H O can coexist at 0°C.
2 Only after all of the solid has melted into liquid does the addition of heat change the temperature of the substance.
For each phase change of a substance, there is a characteristic quantity of heat needed to perform the phase change per gram (or per mole) of material.
The heat of fusion (ΔH ) is the amount of heat per gram (or per mole) required for a phase change that fus occurs at the melting point.
The heat of vaporization (ΔH ) is the amount of heat vap per gram (or per mole) required for a phase change that occurs at the boiling point.
If you know the total number of grams or moles of material, you can use the ΔH or the fus ΔH to determine the total heat being transferred for melting or solidification using vap these expressions: heat = n × ΔH (where n is the number of moles) or heat = m × ΔH (where m is the mass in fus fus grams) For the boiling or condensation, use these expressions: heat = n × ΔH (where n is the number of moles) or heat = m × ΔH (where m is the mass in vap vap grams) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 363  Remember that a phase change depends on the direction of the heat transfer.
If heat transfers in, solids become liquids, and liquids become solids at the melting and boiling points, respectively.
If heat transfers out, liquids solidify, and gases condense into liquids.
EXAMPLE 4 How much heat is necessary to melt 55.8 g of ice (solid H O) at 0°C?
The heat of fusion 2 of H O is 79.9 cal/g.
2 Solution We can use the relationship between heat and the heat of fusion to determine how many joules of heat are needed to melt this ice: heat = m × ΔH fus SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
How much heat is necessary to vaporize 685 g of H O at 100°C?
The heat of vaporization 2 of H O is 540 cal/g.
2 Table 7.4 "Heats of Fusion and Vaporization for Selected Substances" lists the heats of fusion and vaporization for some common substances.
Note the units on these quantities; when you use these values in problem solving, make sure that the other variables in your calculation are expressed in units consistent with the units in the specific heats or the heats of fusion and vaporization.
Table 7.4 Heats of Fusion and Vaporization for Selected Substances Substance ΔH (cal/g) ΔH (cal/g) fus vap Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 364  Substance ΔH (cal/g) ΔH (cal/g) fus vap aluminum (Al) 94.0 2,602 gold (Au) 15.3 409 iron (Fe) 63.2 1,504 water (H O) 79.9 540 2 sodium chloride (NaCl) 123.5 691 ethanol (C H OH) 45.2 200.3 2 5 benzene (C H ) 30.4 94.1 6 6 Looking Closer: Sublimation There is also a phase change where a solid goes directly to a gas: solid → gas This phase change is called sublimation.
Each substance has a characteristic heat of sublimation associated with this process.
For example, the heat of sublimation (ΔH ) of sub H O is 620 cal/g.
2 We encounter sublimation in several ways.
You may already be familiar with dry ice, which is simply solid carbon dioxide (CO ).
At −78.5°C (−109°F), solid carbon dioxide 2 sublimes, changing directly from the solid phase to the gas phase: Solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice because it does not pass through the liquid phase.
Instead, it does directly to the gas phase.
(Carbon dioxide can exist as liquid but only under high pressure.)
Dry ice has many practical uses, including the long-term preservation of medical samples.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 365  Even at temperatures below 0°C, solid H O will slowly sublime.
For example, a thin 2 layer of snow or frost on the ground may slowly disappear as the solid H O sublimes, 2 even though the outside temperature may be below the freezing point of water.
Similarly, ice cubes in a freezer may get smaller over time.
Although frozen, the solid water slowly sublimes, redepositing on the colder cooling elements of the freezer, which necessitates periodic defrosting.
(Frost-free freezers minimize this redeposition.)
Lowering the temperature in a freezer will reduce the need to defrost as often.
Under similar circumstances, water will also sublime from frozen foods (e.g., meats or vegetables), giving them an unattractive, mottled appearance called freezer burn.
It is not really a “burn,” and the food has not necessarily gone bad, although it looks unappetizing.
Freezer burn can be minimized by lowering a freezer’s temperature and by wrapping foods tightly so water does not have any space to sublime into.

Determine if a chemical process is exothermic or endothermic.
What happens when you take a basketball, place it halfway up a playground slide, and then let it go?
The basketball rolls down the slide.
What happens if you do it again?
Does the basketball roll down the slide?
It should.
If you were to perform this experiment over and over again, do you think the basketball would ever roll up the slide?
Probably not.
Why not?
Well, for starters, in all of our experience, the basketball has always moved to a lower position when given the opportunity.
The gravitational attraction of Earth exerts a force on the basketball, and given the chance, the basketball will move down.
We say that the basketball is going to a lower gravitational potential energy.
The basketball can move up the slide, but only if someone exerts some effort (that is, work) on the basketball.
A general statement, based Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 368  on countless observations over centuries of study, is that all objects tend to move spontaneously to a position of minimum energy unless acted on by some other force or object.
A similar statement can be made about atoms in compounds.
Atoms bond together to form compounds because in doing so they attain lower energies than they possess as individual atoms.
A quantity of energy, equal to the difference between the energies of the bonded atoms and the energies of the separated atoms, is released, usually as heat.
That is, the bonded atoms have a lower energy than the individual atoms do.
When atoms combine to make a compound, energy is always given off, and the compound has a lower overall energy.
In making compounds, atoms act like a basketball on a playground slide; they move in the direction of decreasing energy.
We can reverse the process, just as with the basketball.
If we put energy into a molecule, we can cause its bonds to break, separating a molecule into individual atoms.
Bonds between certain specific elements usually have a characteristic energy, called the bond energy, that is needed to break the bond.
The same amount of energy was liberated when the atoms made the chemical bond in the first place.
The term bond energy is usually used to describe the strength of interactions between atoms that make covalent bonds.
For atoms in ionic compounds attracted by opposite charges, the term lattice energy is used.
For now, we will deal with covalent bonds in molecules.
Although each molecule has its own characteristic bond energy, some generalizations are possible.
For example, although the exact value of a C–H bond energy depends on the particular molecule, all C–H bonds have a bond energy of roughly the same value because they are all C–H bonds.
It takes roughly 100 kcal of energy to break 1 mol of C– H bonds, so we speak of the bond energy of a C–H bond as being about 100 kcal/mol.
A C–C bond has an approximate bond energy of 80 kcal/mol, while a C=C has a bond energy of about 145 kcal/mol.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch07_s04_t01lists the approximate bond energies of various covalent bonds.
Table 7.5 Approximate Bond Energies Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 369  Bond Bond Energy (kcal/mol) C–H 100 C–O 86 C=O 190 C–N 70 C–C 85 C=C 145 C≡C 200 N–H 93 H–H 105 When a chemical reaction occurs, the atoms in the reactants rearrange their chemical bonds to make products.
The new arrangement of bonds does not have the same total energy as the bonds in the reactants.
Therefore, when chemical reactions occur, there will always be an accompanying energy change.
In some reactions, the energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants.
Thus, in the course of the reaction, the substances lose energy to the surrounding environment.
Such reactions are exothermic and can be represented by an energy- level diagram like the one in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch07_s04_f01.
In most cases, the energy is given off as heat (although a few reactions give off energy as light).
Figure 7.3 Exothermic Reactions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 370  For an exothermic chemical reaction, energy is given off as reactants are converted to products.
In chemical reactions where the products have a higher energy than the reactants, the reactants must absorb energy from their environment to react.
These reactions are endothermic and can be represented by an energy-level diagram like the one shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch07_s04_f02.
Figure 7.4 Endothermic Reactions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 371  For an endothermic chemical reaction, energy is absorbed as reactants are converted to products.
Exothermic and endothermic reactions can be thought of as having energy as either a product of the reaction or a reactant.
Exothermic reactions give off energy, so energy is a product.
Endothermic reactions require energy, so energy is a reactant.
EXAMPLE 5 Is each chemical reaction exothermic or endothermic?

Because energy is a product, energy is given off by the reaction.
Therefore, this reaction is exothermic.
2.
Because energy is a reactant, energy is absorbed by the reaction.
Therefore, this reaction is endothermic.

Relate the concept of energy change to chemical reactions that occur in the body.
The chemistry of the human body, or any living organism, is very complex.
Even so, the chemical reactions found in the human body follow the same principles of energy that other chemical reactions follow.
Where does the energy that powers our bodies come from?
The details are complex, but we can look at some simple processes at the heart of cellular activity.
An important reaction that provides energy for our bodies is the oxidation of glucose (C H O ): 6 12 6 C H O (s) + 6O (g) → 6CO (g) + 6H O(ℓ) + 670 kcal 6 12 6 2 2 2 Considering that 1 mol of C H O (s) has a volume of about 115 mL, we can see that 6 12 6 glucose is a compact source of energy.
Glucose and other sugars are examples of carbohydrates, which are one of the three main dietary components of a human diet.
All carbohydrates supply approximately 4 kcal/g.
You can verify that by taking the heat of reaction for glucose oxidation and dividing it by its molar mass.
Proteins, the building blocks of structural tissues like muscle and skin, also supply about 4 kcal/g.
Other important energy sources for the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 375  body are fats, which are largely hydrocarbon chains.
Fats provide even more energy per gram, about 9 kcal/g.
A detailed discussion of carbohydrates and fats and their chemistry in the body is found in Chapter 16 "Carbohydrates" and Chapter 17 "Lipids".
Another important reaction is the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which is shown in Figure 7.5 "ATP to ADP".
Under physiological conditions, the breaking of an O–P bond and the formation of an O–P and two O–H bonds gives off about 7.5 kcal/mol of ATP.
This may not seem like much energy, especially compared to the amount of energy given off when glucose reacts.
It is enough energy, however, to fuel other biochemically important chemical reactions in our cells.
Figure 7.5 ATP to ADP The conversion of ATP (top) to ADP (bottom) provides energy for the cells of the body.
Note Even complex biological reactions must obey the basic rules of chemistry.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 376  Career Focus: Dietitian A dietitian is a nutrition expert who communicates food-related information to the general public.
In doing so, dietitians promote the general well-being among the population and help individuals recover from nutritionally related illnesses.
Our diet does not just supply us with energy.
We also get vitamins, minerals, and even water from what we eat.
Eating too much, too little, or not enough of the right foods can lead to a variety of problems.
Dietitians are trained to make specific dietary recommendations to address particular issues relating to health.
For example, a dietitian might work with a person to develop an overall diet that would help that person lose weight or control diabetes.
Hospitals employ dietitians in planning menus for patients, and many dietitians work with community organizations to improve the eating habits of large groups of people.

Energy is the ability to do work.
The transfer of energy from one place to another is heat.
Heat and energy are measured in units of joules, calories, or kilocalories (equal to 1,000 calories).
The amount of heat gained or lost when the temperature of an object changes can be related to its mass and a constant called the specific heat of the substance.
The transfer of energy can also cause a substance to change from one phase to another.
During the transition, called a phase change, heat is either added or lost.
Despite the fact that heat is going into or coming out of a substance during a phase change, the temperature of the substance does not change until the phase change is complete; that is, phase changes are isothermal.
Analogous to specific heat, a constant called the heat of fusion of a substance describes how much heat must be transferred for a substance to melt or solidify (that is, to change between solid and liquid phases), while the heat of vaporizationdescribes the amount of heat transferred in a boiling or condensation process (that is, to change between liquid and gas phases).
Every chemical change is accompanied by an energy change.
This is because the interaction between atoms bonding to each other has a certain bond energy, the energy required to break the bond (called lattice energy for ionic compounds), and the bond energies of the reactants will not be the same as the bond energies of the products.
Reactions that give off energy are called exothermic, while reactions that absorb energy are called endothermic.
Energy-level diagrams can be used to illustrate the energy changes that accompany chemical reactions.
Even complex biochemical reactions have to follow the rules of simple chemistry, including rules involving energy change.
Reactions of carbohydrates and proteins provide our bodies with about 4 kcal of energy per gram, while fats provide about 9 kcal per gram.

2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 383  Chapter 8 Solids, Liquids, and Gases Opening Essay We normally experience carbon dioxide (CO ) as a gas, but if it were cooled down to 2 about −78°C, it would become a solid.
The everyday term for solid carbon dioxide is dry ice.
Why “dry” ice?
Solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice because it converts from a solid to a gas directly, without going through the liquid phase, in a process calledsublimation.
Thus, there is no messy liquid phase to worry about.
Although it is a novelty, dry ice has some potential dangers.
Because it is so cold, it can freeze living tissues very quickly, so people handling dry ice should wear special protective gloves.
The cold carbon dioxide gas is also heavier than air (because it is cold and more dense), so people in the presence of dry ice should be in a well-ventilated area.
Dry ice has several common uses.
Because it is so cold, it is used as a refrigerant to keep other things cold or frozen (e.g., meats or ice cream).
In the medical field, dry ice is used to preserve medical specimens, blood products, and drugs.
It also has dermatological applications (e.g., freezing off warts).
Organs for transplant are kept cool with dry ice until the recipient of the new organ is ready for surgery.
In this respect, carbon dioxide is much like water—more than one phase of the same substance has significant uses in the real world.
Most of us are familiar with the three phases of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.
Indeed, we addressed the energy changes involved in phase changes in Chapter 7 "Energy and Chemical Processes".
The picture on this page shows the substance we are probably most familiar with as having those three phases: water.
In everyday life, we commonly come in contact with water as a solid (ice), as a liquid, and as a gas (steam).
All we have to do is change the conditions of the substance—typically temperature—and we can change the phase from solid to liquid to gas and back again.
Under the proper conditions of temperature and pressure, many substances—not only water—can experience the three different phases.
An understanding of the phases of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 384  matter is important for our understanding of all matter.
In this chapter, we will explore the three phases of matter.
8.1 Intermolecular Interactions LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Define phase.
2.
Identify the types of interactions between molecules.
A phase is a certain form of matter that includes a specific set of physical properties.
That is, the atoms, the molecules, or the ions that make up the phase do so in a consistent manner throughout the phase.
As mentioned in Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement", science recognizes three stable phases: the solid phase, in which individual particles can be thought of as in contact and held in place; the liquid phase, in which individual particles are in contact but moving with respect to each other; and the gas phase, in which individual particles are separated from each other by relatively large distances.
Not all substances will readily exhibit all phases.
For example, carbon dioxide does not exhibit a liquid phase unless the pressure is greater than about six times normal atmospheric pressure.
Other substances, especially complex organic molecules, may decompose at higher temperatures, rather than becoming a liquid or a gas.
Note For many substances, there are different arrangements the particles can take in the solid phase, depending on temperature and pressure.
Which phase a substance adopts depends on the pressure and the temperature it experiences.
Of these two conditions, temperature variations are more obviously related to the phase of a substance.
When it is very cold, H O exists in the solid form as ice.
2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 385  When it is warmer, the liquid phase of H O is present.
At even higher temperatures, 2 H O boils and becomes steam.
2 Pressure changes can also affect the presence of a particular phase (as we indicated for carbon dioxide), but its effects are less obvious most of the time.
We will mostly focus on the temperature effects on phases, mentioning pressure effects only when they are important.
Most chemical substances follow the same pattern of phases when going from a low temperature to a high temperature: the solid phase, then the liquid phase, and then the gas phase.
However, the temperatures at which these phases are present differ for all substances and can be rather extreme.
Table 8.1 "Temperature Ranges for the Three Phases of Various Substances" shows the temperature ranges for solid, liquid, and gas phases for three substances.
As you can see, there is extreme variability in the temperature ranges.
Table 8.1 Temperature Ranges for the Three Phases of Various Substances Substance Solid Phase Below Liquid Phase Above Gas Phase Above hydrogen (H ) −259°C −259°C −253°C 2 water (H O) 0°C 0°C 100°C 2 sodium chloride (NaCl) 801°C 801°C 1413°C The melting point of a substance is the temperature that separates a solid and a liquid.
The boiling point of a substance is the temperature that separates a liquid and a gas.
What accounts for this variability?
Why do some substances become liquids at very low temperatures, while others require very high temperatures before they become liquids?
It all depends on the strength of the intermolecular interactions between the particles of substances.
(Although ionic compounds are not composed of discrete molecules, we will still use the term intermolecular to include interactions between the ions in such compounds.)
Substances that experience strong intermolecular interactions require higher temperatures to become liquids and, finally, gases.
Substances that experience weak intermolecular interactions do not need much energy (as measured by Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 386  temperature) to become liquids and gases and will exhibit these phases at lower temperatures.
Substances with the highest melting and boiling points have covalent network bonding.
This type of intermolecular interaction is actually a covalent bond.
(For more information about covalent bonding, see Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds".)
In these substances, all the atoms in a sample are covalently bonded to other atoms; in effect, the entire sample is essentially one large molecule.
Many of these substances are solid over a large temperature range because it takes a lot of energy to disrupt all the covalent bonds at once.
One example of a substance that shows covalent network bonding is diamond, which is a form of pure carbon.
At temperatures over 3,500°C, diamond finally vaporizes into gas-phase atoms.
The strongest force between any two particles is the ionic bond, in which two ions of opposing charge are attracted to each other.
(For more information about ionic bonding, see Chapter 3 "Ionic Bonding and Simple Ionic Compounds".)
Thus, ionic interactions between particles are another type of intermolecular interaction.
Substances that contain ionic interactions are relatively strongly held together, so these substances typically have high melting and boiling points.
Sodium chloride is an example of a substance whose particles experience ionic interactions (Table 8.1 "Temperature Ranges for the Three Phases of Various Substances").
Many substances that experience covalent bonding exist as discrete molecules.
In many molecules, the electrons that are shared in a covalent bond are not shared equally between the two atoms in the bond.
Typically, one of the atoms attracts the electrons more strongly than the other, leading to an unequal sharing of electrons in the bond.
This idea is illustrated in Figure 8.4 "Polar Covalent Bonds", which shows a diagram of the covalent bond in hydrogen fluoride (HF).
The fluorine atom attracts the electrons in the bond more than the hydrogen atom does.
The result is an unequal distribution of electrons in the bond, favoring the fluorine side of the covalent bond.
Because of this unequal distribution, the fluorine side of the covalent bond actually takes on a partial negative charge (indicated by the δ− in Figure 8.4 "Polar Covalent Bonds"), while the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 387  hydrogen side of the bond, being electron deficient, takes on a partial positive charge (indicated by the δ+ in Figure 8.4 "Polar Covalent Bonds").
A covalent bond that has an unequal sharing of electrons is called a polar covalent bond.
(A covalent bond that has an equal sharing of electrons, as in a covalent bond with the same atom on each side, is called a nonpolar covalent bond.)
A molecule with a net unequal distribution of electrons in its covalent bonds is a polar molecule.
HF is an example of a polar molecule.
Figure 8.4 Polar Covalent Bonds The electrons in the HF molecule are not equally shared by the two atoms in the bond.
Because the fluorine atom has nine protons in its nucleus, it attracts the negatively charged electrons in the bond more than the hydrogen atom does with its one proton in its nucleus.
Thus, electrons are more strongly attracted to the fluorine atom, leading to an imbalance in the electron distribution between the atoms.
The fluorine side of the bond picks up a partial overall negative charge (represented by the δ− in the diagram), while the hydrogen side of the bond has an overall partial positive charge (represented by the δ+ in the diagram).
Such a bond is called a polar covalent bond.
The charge separation in a polar covalent bond is not as extreme as is found in ionic compounds, but there is a related result: oppositely charged ends of different molecules will attract each other.
This type of intermolecular interaction is called a dipole- dipole interaction.
Many molecules with polar covalent bonds experience dipole- dipole interactions.
The covalent bonds in some molecules are oriented in space in such a way that the bonds in the molecules cancel each other out.
The individual bonds are polar, but the overall molecule is not polar; rather, the molecule is nonpolar.
Such molecules experience little or no dipole-dipole interactions.
Carbon dioxide (CO ) and 2 carbon tetrachloride (CCl ) are examples of such molecules (Figure 8.5 "Nonpolar 4 Molecules").
Figure 8.5 Nonpolar Molecules Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 388  Although the individual bonds in both CO and CCl are polar, their effects cancel out 2 4 because of the spatial orientation of the bonds in each molecule.
As a result, such molecules experience little or no dipole-dipole interaction.
The H–F, O–H, and N–H bonds are strongly polar; in molecules that have these bonds, particularly strong dipole-dipole interactions (as strong as 10% of a true covalent bond) can occur.
Because of this strong interaction, hydrogen bonding is used to describe this dipole-dipole interaction.
The physical properties of water, which has two O–H bonds, are strongly affected by the presence of hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
Figure 8.6 "Hydrogen Bonding between Water Molecules"shows how molecules experiencing hydrogen bonding can interact.
Figure 8.6 Hydrogen Bonding between Water Molecules Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 389  The presence of hydrogen bonding in molecules like water can have a large impact on the physical properties of a substance.
Finally, there are forces between all molecules that are caused by electrons being in different places in a molecule at any one time, which sets up a temporary separation of charge that disappears almost as soon as it appears.
These are very weak intermolecular interactions and are called dispersion forces (or London forces).
(An alternate name is London dispersion forces.)
Molecules that experience no other type of intermolecular interaction will at least experience dispersion forces.
Substances that experience only dispersion forces are typically soft in the solid phase and have relatively low melting points.
Because dispersion forces are caused by the instantaneous Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 390  distribution of electrons in a molecule, larger molecules with a large number of electrons can experience substantial dispersion forces.
Examples include waxes, which are long hydrocarbon chains that are solids at room temperature because the molecules have so many electrons.
The resulting dispersion forces between these molecules make them assume the solid phase at normal temperatures.
The phase that a substance adopts depends on the type and magnitude of the intermolecular interactions the particles of a substance experience.
If the intermolecular interactions are relatively strong, then a large amount of energy—in terms of temperature—is necessary for a substance to change phases.
If the intermolecular interactions are weak, a low temperature is all that is necessary to move a substance out of the solid phase.
EXAMPLE 1 What intermolecular forces besides dispersion forces, if any, exist in each substance?
Are any of these substances solids at room temperature?
1. potassium chloride (KCl) 2. ethanol (C H OH) 2 5 3. bromine (Br ) 2 Solution 1.
Potassium chloride is composed of ions, so the intermolecular interaction in potassium chloride is ionic forces.
Because ionic interactions are strong, it might be expected that potassium chloride is a solid at room temperature.
2.
Ethanol has a hydrogen atom attached to an oxygen atom, so it would experience hydrogen bonding.
If the hydrogen bonding is strong enough, ethanol might be a solid at room temperature, but it is difficult to know for certain.
(Ethanol is actually a liquid at room temperature.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 391  3.
Elemental bromine has two bromine atoms covalently bonded to each other.
Because the atoms on either side of the covalent bond are the same, the electrons in the covalent bond are shared equally, and the bond is a nonpolar covalent bond.
Thus, diatomic bromine does not have any intermolecular forces other than dispersion forces.
It is unlikely to be a solid at room temperature unless the dispersion forces are strong enough.
Bromine is a liquid at room temperature.

9. very hard, high melting point Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 394  8.2 Solids and Liquids LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe the solid and liquid phases.
Solids and liquids are collectively called condensed phases because their particles are in virtual contact.
The two states share little else, however.
Solids In the solid state, the individual particles of a substance are in fixed positions with respect to each other because there is not enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular interactions between the particles.
As a result, solids have a definite shape and volume.
Most solids are hard, but some (like waxes) are relatively soft.
Many solids composed of ions can also be quite brittle.
Solids usually have their constituent particles arranged in a regular, three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions called a crystal.
The effect of this regular arrangement of particles is sometimes visible macroscopically, as shown in Figure 8.7 "Crystalline Arrangement".
Some solids, especially those composed of large molecules, cannot easily organize their particles in such regular crystals and exist as amorphous (literally, “without form”) solids.
Glass is one example of an amorphous solid.
Liquids If the particles of a substance have enough energy to partially overcome intermolecular interactions, then the particles can move about each other while remaining in contact.
This describes the liquid state.
In a liquid, the particles are still in close contact, so liquids have a definite volume.
However, because the particles can move about each other rather freely, a liquid has no definite shape and takes a shape dictated by its container.
Gases Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 395  If the particles of a substance have enough energy to completely overcome intermolecular interactions, then the particles can separate from each other and move about randomly in space.
This describes the gas state, which we will consider further in Section 8.3 "Gases and Pressure".
Like liquids, gases have no definite shape, but unlike solids and liquids, gases have no definite volume either.
The change from solid to liquid usually does not significantly change the volume of a substance.
However, the change from a liquid to a gas significantly increases the volume of a substance, by a factor of 1,000 or more.
Figure 8.8 "A Representation of the Solid, Liquid, and Gas States" shows the differences among solids, liquids, and gases at the molecular level, while Table 8.2 "Characteristics of the Three States of Matter" lists the different characteristics of these states.
Figure 8.8 A Representation of the Solid, Liquid, and Gas States A solid has definite volume and shape, a liquid has a definite volume but no definite shape, and a gas has neither a definite volume nor shape.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 397  CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISE 1.
How do the strengths of intermolecular interactions in solids and liquids differ?
ANSWER 1.
Solids have stronger intermolecular interactions than liquids do.
Looking Closer: Water, the Most Important Liquid Earth is the only known body in our solar system that has liquid water existing freely on its surface.
That is a good thing because life on Earth would not be possible without the presence of liquid water.
Water has several properties that make it a unique substance among substances.
It is an excellent solvent; it dissolves many other substances and allows those substances to react when in solution.
In fact, water is sometimes called the universal solvent because of this ability.
Water has unusually high melting and boiling points (0°C and 100°C, respectively) for such a small molecule.
The boiling points for similar-sized molecules, such as methane (BP = −162°C) and ammonia (BP = −33°C), are more than 100° lower.
Though a liquid at normal temperatures, water molecules experience a relatively strong intermolecular interaction that allows them to maintain the liquid phase at higher temperatures than expected.
Unlike most substances, the solid form of water is less dense than its liquid form, which allows ice to float on water.
In colder weather, lakes and rivers freeze from the top, allowing animals and plants to continue to live underneath.
Water also requires an unusually large amount of energy to change temperature.
While 100 J of energy will change the temperature of 1 g of Fe by 230°C, this same amount of energy will change the temperature of 1 g of H O by only 100°C.
Thus, water changes its temperature slowly 2 as heat is added or removed.
This has a major impact on weather, as storm systems like hurricanes can be impacted by the amount of heat that ocean water can store.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 398  Water’s influence on the world around us is affected by these properties.
Isn’t it fascinating that such a small molecule can have such a big impact?

Describe the gas phase.
The gas phase is unique among the three states of matter in that there are some simple models we can use to predict the physical behavior of all gases—independent of their identities.
We cannot do this for the solid and liquid states.
In fact, the development of this understanding of the behavior of gases represents the historical dividing point between alchemy and modern chemistry.
Initial advances in the understanding of gas behavior were made in the mid 1600s by Robert Boyle, an English scientist who founded the Royal Society (one of the world’s oldest scientific organizations).
How is it that we can model all gases independent of their chemical identity?
The answer is in a group of statements called the kinetic theory of gases:  Gases are composed of tiny particles that are separated by large distances.
 Gas particles are constantly moving, experiencing collisions with other gas particles and the walls of their container.
 The velocity of gas particles is related to the temperature of a gas.
 Gas particles do not experience any force of attraction or repulsion with each other.
Did you notice that none of these statements relates to the identity of the gas?
This means that all gases should behave similarly.
A gas that follows these statements perfectly is called an ideal gas.
Most gases show slight deviations from these statements and are called real gases.
However, the existence of real gases does not diminish the importance of the kinetic theory of gases.
One of the statements of the kinetic theory mentions collisions.
As gas particles are constantly moving, they are also constantly colliding with each other and with the walls of their container.
There are forces involved as gas particles bounce off the container walls (Figure 8.9 "Gas Pressure").
The force generated by gas particles divided by the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 401  area of the container walls yields pressure.
Pressure is a property we can measure for a gas, but we typically do not consider pressure for solids or liquids.
Figure 8.9 Gas Pressure Pressure is what results when gas particles rebound off the walls of their container.
The basic unit of pressure is the newton per square meter (N/m2).
This combined unit is redefined as a pascal (Pa).
One pascal is not a very large amount of pressure.
A more useful unit of pressure is the bar, which is 100,000 Pa (1 bar = 100,000 Pa).
Other common units of pressure are the atmosphere (atm), which was originally defined as the average pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level; and mmHg (millimeters of mercury), which is the pressure generated by a column of mercury 1 mm high.
The unit millimeters of mercury is also called a torr, named after the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer in the mid- 1600s.
A more precise definition of atmosphere, in terms of torr, is that there are exactly 760 torr in 1 atm.
A bar equals 1.01325 atm.
Given all the relationships between these pressure units, the ability to convert from one pressure unit to another is a useful skill.
EXAMPLE 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 402  Write a conversion factor to determine how many atmospheres are in 1,547 mmHg.
Solution Because 1 mmHg equals 1 torr, the given pressure is also equal to 1,547 torr.
Because there are 760 torr in 1 atm, we can use this conversion factor to do the mathematical conversion: Note how the torr units cancel algebraically.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Write a conversion factor to determine how many millimeters of mercury are in 9.65 atm.
The kinetic theory also states that there is no interaction between individual gas particles.
Although we know that there are, in fact, intermolecular interactions in real gases, the kinetic theory assumes that gas particles are so far apart that the individual particles don’t “feel” each other.
Thus, we can treat gas particles as tiny bits of matter whose identity isn’t important to certain physical properties.

Predict the properties of gases using the gas laws.
Experience has shown that several properties of a gas can be related to each other under certain conditions.
The properties are pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T, in kelvins), and amount of material expressed in moles (n).
What we find is that a sample of gas cannot have any random values for these properties.
Instead, only certain values, dictated by some simple mathematical relationships, will occur.
Boyle’s Law The first simple relationship, referred to as a gas law, is between the pressure of a gas and its volume.
If the amount of gas in a sample and its temperature are kept constant, then as the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume of the gas decreases proportionately.
Mathematically, this is written as where the “∝” symbol means “is proportional to.” This is one form of Boyle’s law, which relates the pressure of a gas to its volume.
A more useful form of Boyle’s law involves a change in conditions of a gas.
For a given amount of gas at a constant temperature, if we know the initial pressure and volume of a gas sample and the pressure or volume changes, we can calculate what the new volume or pressure will be.
That form of Boyle’s law is written PV = PV i i f f where the subscript i refers to initial conditions and the subscript f refers to final conditions.
To use PV = PV, you need to know any three of the variables so that you can i i f f algebraically calculate the fourth variable.
Also, the pressure quantities must have the same units, as must the two volume quantities.
If the two similar variables don’t have the same variables, one value must be converted to the other value’s unit.
EXAMPLE 4 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 406  What happens to the volume of a gas if its pressure is increased?
Assume all other conditions remain the same.
Solution If the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume decreases in response.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
What happens to the pressure of a gas if its volume is increased?
Assume all other conditions remain the same.
EXAMPLE 5 If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 1.56 atm and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final volume if the pressure is reduced to 0.987 atm?
Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant.
Solution The key in problems like this is to be able to identify which quantities represent which variables from the relevant equation.
The way the question is worded, you should be able to tell that 1.56 atm is P, 7.02 L is V, and 0.987 atm is P. What we are looking for is i i f the final volume—V.
Therefore, substituting these values into PV = PV: f i i f f (1.56 atm)(7.02 L) = (0.987 atm) × V f The expression has atmospheres on both sides of the equation, so they cancel algebraically: (1.56)(7.02 L) = (0.987) × V f Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 407  Now we divide both sides of the expression by 0.987 to isolate V, the quantity we are f seeking: Performing the multiplication and division, we get the value of V, which is 11.1 L. The f volume increases.
This should make sense because the pressure decreases, so pressure and volume are inversely related.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 3.66 atm and an initial volume of 11.8 L, what is the final pressure if the volume is reduced to 5.09 L?
Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant.
If the units of similar quantities are not the same, one of them must be converted to the other quantity’s units for the calculation to work out properly.
It does not matter which quantity is converted to a different unit; the only thing that matters is that the conversion and subsequent algebra are performed properly.
The following example illustrates this process.
EXAMPLE 6 If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 1.56 atm and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final volume if the pressure is changed to 1,775 torr?
Does the answer make sense?
Assume that the amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant.
Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 408  This example is similar to Example 5, except now the final pressure is expressed in torr.
For the math to work out properly, one of the pressure values must be converted to the other unit.
Let us change the initial pressure to torr: Now we can use Boyle’s law: (1,190 torr)(7.02 L) = (1,775 torr) × V f Torr cancels algebraically from both sides of the equation, leaving (1,190)(7.02 L) = (1,775) × V f Now we divide both sides of the equation by 1,775 to isolate V on one side.
Solving for f the final volume, Because the pressure increases, it makes sense that the volume decreases.
Note The answer for the final volume is essentially the same if we converted the 1,775 torr to atmospheres: 1,775 torr× = 2.336 atm.
Using Boyle’s law: (1.56 atm)(7.02 L) = (2.335 atm) × Vf; Vf= =4.69 L. SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
If a sample of gas has an initial pressure of 375 torr and an initial volume of 7.02 L, what is the final pressure if the volume is changed to 4,577 mL?
Does the answer make sense?
Assume that amount and the temperature of the gas remain constant.
To Your Health: Breathing Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 409  Breathing certainly is a major contribution to your health!
Without breathing, we could not survive.
Curiously, the act of breathing itself is little more than an application of Boyle’s law.
The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called alveoli.
It is in the alveoli that oxygen from the air transfers to the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream transfers to the lungs for exhalation.
For air to move in and out of the lungs, the pressure inside the lungs must change, forcing the lungs to change volume—just as predicted by Boyle’s law.
The pressure change is caused by the diaphragm, a muscle that covers the bottom of the lungs.
When the diaphragm moves down, it expands the size of our lungs.
When this happens, the air pressure inside our lungs decreases slightly.
This causes new air to rush in, and we inhale.
The pressure decrease is slight—only 3 torr, or about 0.4% of an atmosphere.
We inhale only 0.5–1.0 L of air per normal breath.
Exhaling air requires that we relax the diaphragm, which pushes against the lungs and slightly decreases the volume of the lungs.
This slightly increases the pressure of the air in the lungs, and air is forced out; we exhale.
Only 1–2 torr of extra pressure is needed to exhale.
So with every breath, our own bodies are performing an experimental test of Boyle’s law.
Charles’s Law Another simple gas law relates the volume of a gas to its temperature.
Experiments indicate that as the temperature of a gas sample is increased, its volume increases as long as the pressure and the amount of gas remain constant.
The way to write this mathematically is V ∝ T At this point, the concept of temperature must be clarified.
Although the Kelvin scale is the preferred temperature scale, the Celsius scale is also a common temperature scale used in science.
The Celsius scale is based on the melting and boiling points of water and is actually the common temperature scale used by most countries around the world Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 410  (except for the United States, which still uses the Fahrenheit scale).
The value of a Celsius temperature is directly related to its Kelvin value by a simple expression: Kelvin temperature = Celsius temperature + 273 Thus, it is easy to convert from one temperature scale to another.
Note The Kelvin scale is sometimes referred to as the absolute scale because the zero point on the Kelvin scale is at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature.
On the other temperature scales, absolute zero is −260°C or −459°F.
The expression relating a gas volume to its temperature begs the following question: to which temperature scale is the volume of a gas related?
The answer is that gas volumes are directly related to the Kelvin temperature.
Therefore, the temperature of a gas sample should always be expressed in (or converted to) a Kelvin temperature.
EXAMPLE 7 What happens to the volume of a gas if its temperature is decreased?
Assume that all other conditions remain constant.
Solution If the temperature of a gas sample is decreased, the volume decreases as well.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE What happens to the temperature of a gas if its volume is increased?
Assume that all other conditions remain constant.
As with Boyle’s law, the relationship between volume and temperature can be expressed in terms of initial and final values of volume and temperature, as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 411  where V and T are the initial volume and temperature, and V and T are the final i i f f volume and temperature.
This is Charles’s law.
The restriction on its use is that the pressure of the gas and the amount of gas must remain constant.
(Charles’s law is sometimes referred to as Gay-Lussac’s law, after the scientist who promoted Charles’s work.)
EXAMPLE 8 A gas sample at 20°C has an initial volume of 20.0 L. What is its volume if the temperature is changed to 60°C?
Does the answer make sense?
Assume that the pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant.
Solution Although the temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, we must convert them to the kelvins before we can use Charles’s law.
Thus, 20°C + 273 = 293 K = T60°C + 273 = 333 K = T i f Now we can substitute these values into Charles’s law, along with the initial volume of 20.0 L: Multiplying the 333 K to the other side of the equation, we see that our temperature units will cancel: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 412  Solving for the final volume, V = 22.7 L. So, as the temperature is increased, the volume f increases.
This makes sense because volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (as long as the pressure and the amount of the remain constant).
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
A gas sample at 35°C has an initial volume of 5.06 L. What is its volume if the temperature is changed to −35°C?
Does the answer make sense?
Assume that the pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant.
Combined Gas Law Other gas laws can be constructed, but we will focus on only two more.
The combined gas law brings Boyle’s and Charles’s laws together to relate pressure, volume, and temperature changes of a gas sample: To apply this gas law, the amount of gas should remain constant.
As with the other gas laws, the temperature must be expressed in kelvins, and the units on the similar quantities should be the same.
Because of the dependence on three quantities at the same time, it is difficult to tell in advance what will happen to one property of a gas sample as two other properties change.
The best way to know is to work it out mathematically.
EXAMPLE 9 A sample of gas has P = 1.50 atm, V = 10.5 L, and T = 300 K. What is the final volume i i i if P = 0.750 atm and T = 350 K?
f f Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 413  Using the combined gas law, substitute for five of the quantities: We algebraically rearrange this expression to isolate V on one side of the equation: f Note how all the units cancel except the unit for volume.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
A sample of gas has P = 0.768 atm, V = 10.5 L, and T = 300 K. What is the final pressure i i i if V = 7.85 L and T = 250 K?
f f EXAMPLE 10 A balloon containing a sample of gas has a temperature of 22°C and a pressure of 1.09 atm in an airport in Cleveland.
The balloon has a volume of 1,070 mL.
The balloon is transported by plane to Denver, where the temperature is 11°C and the pressure is 655 torr.
What is the new volume of the balloon?
Solution The first task is to convert all quantities to the proper and consistent units.
The temperatures must be expressed in kelvins, and the pressure units are different so one of the quantities must be converted.
Let us convert the atmospheres to torr: 22°C + 273 = 295 K = T i 11°C + 273 = 284 K = T f Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 414  Now we can substitute the quantities into the combined has law: To solve for V, we multiply the 284 K in the denominator of the right side into the f numerator on the left, and we divide 655 torr in the numerator of the right side into the denominator on the left: Notice that torr and kelvins cancel, as they are found in both the numerator and denominator.
The only unit that remains is milliliters, which is a unit of volume.
So V= f 1,300 mL.
The overall change is that the volume of the balloon has increased by 230 mL.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE A balloon used to lift weather instruments into the atmosphere contains gas having a volume of 1,150 L on the ground, where the pressure is 0.977 atm and the temperature is 18°C.
Aloft, this gas has a pressure of 6.88 torr and a temperature of −15°C.
What is the new volume of the gas?
The Ideal Gas Law So far, the gas laws we have used have focused on changing one or more properties of the gas, such as its volume, pressure, or temperature.
There is one gas law that relates all the independent properties of a gas under any particular condition, rather than a change in conditions.
This gas law is called the ideal gas law.
The formula of this law is as follows: PV = nRT Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 415  In this equation, P is pressure, V is volume, n is amount of moles, and T is temperature.
R is called the ideal gas law constant and is a proportionality constant that relates the values of pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas sample.
The variables in this equation do not have the subscripts i and f to indicate an initial condition and a final condition.
The ideal gas law relates the four independent properties of a gas under any conditions.
The value of R depends on what units are used to express the other quantities.
If volume is expressed in liters and pressure in atmospheres, then the proper value of R is as follows: This may seem like a strange unit, but that is what is required for the units to work out algebraically.
EXAMPLE 11 What is the volume in liters of 1.45 mol of N gas at 298 K and 3.995 atm?
2 Solution Using the ideal gas law where P = 3.995 atm, n = 1.45, and T = 298, On the right side, the moles and kelvins cancel.
Also, because atmospheres appear in the numerator on both sides of the equation, they also cancel.
The only remaining unit is liters, a unit of volume.
So 3.995 × V = (1.45)(0.08205)(298) L Dividing both sides of the equation by 3.995 and evaluating, we get V = 8.87 L. Note that the conditions of the gas are not changing.
Rather, the ideal gas law allows us to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 416  determine what the fourth property of a gas (here, volume) must be if three other properties (here, amount, pressure, and temperature) are known.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
What is the pressure of a sample of CO gas if 0.557 mol is held in a 20.0 L container at 2 451 K?
For convenience, scientists have selected 273 K (0°C) and 1.00 atm pressure as a set of standard conditions for gases.
This combination of conditions is called standard temperature and pressure (STP).
Under these conditions, 1 mol of any gas has about the same volume.
We can use the ideal gas law to determine the volume of 1 mol of gas at STP: This volume is 22.4 L. Because this volume is independent of the identity of a gas, the idea that 1 mol of gas has a volume of 22.4 L at STP makes a convenient conversion factor: 1 mol gas = 22.4 L (at STP) EXAMPLE 12 Cyclopropane (C H ) is a gas that formerly was used as an anesthetic.
How many moles 3 6 of gas are there in a 100.0 L sample if the gas is at STP?
Solution We can set up a simple, one-step conversion that relates moles and liters: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 417  There are almost 4.5 mol of gas in 100.0 L. Note Because of its flammability, cyclopropane is no longer used as an anesthetic gas.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Freon is a trade name for a series of fluorine- and chlorine-containing gases that formerly were used in refrigeration systems.
What volume does 8.75 mol of Freon have at STP?
Note Many gases known as Freon are no longer used because their presence in the atmosphere destroys the ozone layer, which protects us from ultraviolet light from the sun.
Career Focus: Respiratory Therapist Certain diseases—such as emphysema, lung cancer, and severe asthma—primarily affect the lungs.
Respiratory therapists help patients with breathing-related problems.
They can evaluate, help diagnose, and treat breathing disorders and even help provide emergency assistance in acute illness where breathing is compromised.
Most respiratory therapists must complete at least two years of college and earn an associate’s degree, although therapists can assume more responsibility if they have a college degree.
Therapists must also pass state or national certification exams.
Once certified, respiratory therapists can work in hospitals, doctor’s offices, nursing homes, or patient’s homes.
Therapists work with equipment such as oxygen tanks and respirators, may sometimes dispense medication to aid in breathing, perform tests, and educate patients in breathing exercises and other therapy.
Because respiratory therapists work directly with patients, the ability to work well with others is a must for this career.
It is an important job because it deals with one of the most crucial functions of the body.

A phase is a certain form of matter that has the same physical properties throughout.
Three phases are common: the solid, the liquid, and the gas phase.
What determines the phase of a substance?
Generally, the strength of the intermolecular interactions determines whether a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas under any particular conditions.
Covalent network bonding is a very strong form of intermolecular interaction.
Diamond is one example of a substance that has this intermolecular interaction.
Ionic interactions, the forces of attraction due to oppositely charged ions, are also relatively strong.
Covalent bonds are another type of interaction within molecules, but if the bonds are polar covalent bonds, then the unequal sharing of electrons can cause charge imbalances within molecules that cause interactions between molecules.
These molecules are described as polar, and these interactions are called dipole-dipole interactions.
A certain rather strong type of dipole-dipole interaction, involving a hydrogen atom, is called hydrogen bonding.
On the other hand, equal sharing of electrons forms nonpolar covalent bonds, and the interactions between different molecules is less because the molecules are nonpolar.
All substances have very weak dispersion forces (also called London forces) caused by the movement of electrons within the bonds themselves.
In the solid phase, intermolecular interactions are so strong that they hold the individual atoms or molecules in place.
In many solids, the regular three-dimensional arrangement of particles makes a crystal.
In other solids, the irregular arrangement of particles makes an amorphous solid.
In liquids, the intermolecular interactions are Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 423  strong enough to keep the particles of substance together but not in place.
Thus, the particles are free to move over each other but still remain in contact.
In gases, the intermolecular interactions are weak enough that the individual particles are separated from each other in space.
The kinetic theory of gases is a collection of statements that describe the fundamental behavior of all gases.
Among other properties, gases exert a pressure on their container.
Pressure is measured using units like pascal, bar, atmosphere, or mmHg (also called atorr).
There are several simple relationships between the variables used to describe a quantity of gas.
These relationships are called gas laws.
Boyle’s law relates the pressure and volume of a gas, while Charles’s law relates the volume and absolute temperature of a gas.
The combined gas law relates the volume, pressure, and absolute temperature of a gas sample.
All of these gas laws allow us to understand the changing conditions of a gas.
The ideal gas law relates the pressure, volume, amount, and absolute temperature of a gas under any conditions.
These four variables are related to the ideal gas law constant, which is the proportionality constant used to calculate the conditions of a gas.
Because the conditions of a gas can change, a set of benchmark conditions called standard temperature and pressure (STP) is defined.
Standard temperature is 0ºC, and standard pressure is 1.00 atm.

So what is Ringer’s lactate?
Intravenous (IV) solutions are administered for two main reasons: (1) to introduce necessary substances into the bloodstream, such as ions for proper body function, sugar and other food substances for energy, or drugs to treat a medical condition, and (2) to increase the volume of the bloodstream.
Many people with acute or long-term medical conditions have received some type of an IV solution.
One basic IV solution, called a normal saline solution, is simply a dilute solution of NaCl dissolved in water.
Normal saline is 9.0 g of NaCl dissolved in each liter of solution.
(The reason for this particular concentration is explained in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch09_s04.)
Ringer’s lactate is a normal saline solution that also has small amounts of potassium and calcium ions mixed in.
In addition, it contains about 2.5 g of lactate ions (C H O −) 3 5 3 per liter of solution.
The liver metabolizes lactate ions into bicarbonate (HCO −) ions, 3 which help maintain the acid-base balance of blood.
(Acids and bases are discussed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10.)
Many medical problems, such as heart attacks and shock, affect the acid-base balance of blood, and the presence of lactate in the IV solution eases problems caused by this imbalance.
Physicians can select from a range of premade IV solutions, in accordance with a patient’s particular needs.
Ringer’s lactate is commonly used when a patient’s blood Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 427  volume must be increased quickly.
Another frequently used IV solution, called D5W, is a 5% solution of dextrose (a form of sugar) in water.
Solutions are all around us.
Air, for example, is a solution.
If you live near a lake, a river, or an ocean, that body of water is not pure H O but most probably a solution.
Much of 2 what we drink—for example, soda, coffee, tea, and milk—is at least in part a solution.
Solutions are a large part of everyday life.
A lot of the chemistry occurring around us happens in solution.
In fact, much of the chemistry that occurs in our own bodies takes place in solution, and many solutions— such as the Ringer’s lactate IV solution—are important for our health.
In our understanding of chemistry, we need to understand a little bit about solutions.
In this chapter, you will learn about the special characteristics of solutions, how solutions are characterized, and some of their properties.
9.1 Solutions LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Understand what causes solutions to form.
A solution is another name for a homogeneous mixture.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch01defined a mixture as a material composed of two or more substances.
In a solution, the combination is so intimate that the different substances cannot be differentiated by sight, even with a microscope.
Compare, for example, a mixture of salt and pepper and another mixture consisting of salt and water.
In the first mixture, we can readily see individual grains of salt and the flecks of pepper.
A mixture of salt and pepper is not a solution.
However, in the second mixture, no matter how carefully we look, we cannot see two different substances.
Salt dissolved in water is a solution.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 428  The major component of a solution, called the solvent, is typically the same phase as the solution itself.
Each minor component of a solution (and there may be more than one) is called the solute.
In most of the solutions we will describe in this textbook, there will be no ambiguity about whether a component is the solvent or the solute.)
For example, in a solution of salt in water, the solute is salt, and solvent is water.
Solutions come in all phases, and the solvent and the solute do not have to be in the same phase to form a solution (such as salt and water).
For example, air is a gaseous solution of about 80% nitrogen and about 20% oxygen, with some other gases present in much smaller amounts.
An alloy is a solid solution consisting of a metal (like iron) with some other metals or nonmetals dissolved in it.
Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon and small amounts of other metals, is an example of a solid solution.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch09_s01_t01lists some common types of solutions, with examples of each.
Table 9.1 Types of Solutions Solvent Phase Solute Phase Example gas gas air liquid gas carbonated beverages liquid liquid ethanol (C H OH) in H O (alcoholic beverages) 2 5 2 liquid solid saltwater solid gas H gas absorbed by Pd metal 2 solid liquid Hg(ℓ) in dental fillings solid solid steel alloys What causes a solution to form?
The simple answer is that the solvent and the solute must have similar intermolecular interactions.
When this is the case, the individual particles of solvent and solute can easily mix so intimately that each particle of solute is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 429  surrounded by particles of solute, forming a solution.
However, if two substances have very different intermolecular interactions, large amounts of energy are required to force their individual particles to mix intimately, so a solution does not form.
This process leads to a simple rule of thumb: like dissolves like.
Solvents that are very polar will dissolve solutes that are very polar or even ionic.
Solvents that are nonpolar will dissolve nonpolar solutes.
Thus water, being polar, is a good solvent for ionic compounds and polar solutes like ethanol (C H OH).
However, water does not dissolve 2 5 nonpolar solutes, such as many oils and greases (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch09_s01_f01).
We use the word soluble to describe a solute that dissolves in a particular solvent, and the word insoluble for a solute that does not dissolve in a solvent.
Thus, we say that sodium chloride is soluble in water but insoluble in hexane (C H ).
If the solute and the 6 14 solvent are both liquids and soluble in any proportion, we use the word miscible, and the word immiscible if they are not.
EXAMPLE 1 Water is considered a polar solvent.
Which substances should dissolve in water?
1. methanol (CH OH) 3 2. sodium sulfate (Na SO ) 2 4 3. octane (C H ) 8 18 Solution Because water is polar, substances that are polar or ionic will dissolve in it.
1.
Because of the OH group in methanol, we expect its molecules to be polar.
Thus, we expect it to be soluble in water.
As both water and methanol are liquids, the word miscible can be used in place of soluble.
2.
Sodium sulfate is an ionic compound, so we expect it to be soluble in water.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 430  3.
Like other hydrocarbons, octane is nonpolar, so we expect that it would not be soluble in water.

The solubility of alcohols in water varies with the length of carbon chain.

Small alcohol molecules have strong polar intermolecular interactions, so they dissolve in water.
In large alcohol molecules, the nonpolar end overwhelms the polar end, so they do not dissolve very well in water.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 433  9.2 Concentration LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Express the amount of solute in a solution in various concentration units.
2.
Use molarity to determine quantities in chemical reactions.
3.
Determine the resulting concentration of a diluted solution.
To define a solution precisely, we need to state its concentration: how much solute is dissolved in a certain amount of solvent.
Words such as dilute or concentrated are used to describe solutions that have a little or a lot of dissolved solute, respectively, but these are relative terms whose meanings depend on various factors.
Solubility There is usually a limit to how much solute will dissolve in a given amount of solvent.
This limit is called the solubility of the solute.
Some solutes have a very small solubility, while other solutes are soluble in all proportions.
Table 9.2 "Solubilities of Various Solutes in Water at 25°C (Except as Noted)" lists the solubilities of various solutes in water.
Solubilities vary with temperature, so Table 9.2 "Solubilities of Various Solutes in Water at 25°C (Except as Noted)" includes the temperature at which the solubility was determined.
Table 9.2 Solubilities of Various Solutes in Water at 25°C (Except as Noted) Substance Solubility (g in 100 mL of H O) 2 AgCl(s) 0.019 C H (ℓ) (benzene) 0.178 6 6 CH (g) 0.0023 4 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 434  Substance Solubility (g in 100 mL of H O) 2 CO (g) 0.150 2 CaCO (s) 0.058 3 CaF (s) 0.0016 2 Ca(NO ) (s) 143.9 3 2 C H O (glucose) 120.3 (at 30°C) 6 12 6 KBr(s) 67.8 MgCO (s) 2.20 3 NaCl(s) 36.0 NaHCO (s) 8.41 3 C H O (sucrose) 204.0 (at 20°C) 12 22 11 If a solution contains so much solute that its solubility limit is reached, the solution is said to be saturated, and its concentration is known from information contained inTable 9.2 "Solubilities of Various Solutes in Water at 25°C (Except as Noted)".
If a solution contains less solute than the solubility limit, it is unsaturated.
Under special circumstances, more solute can be dissolved even after the normal solubility limit is reached; such solutions are called supersaturated and are not stable.
If the solute is solid, excess solute can easily recrystallize.
If the solute is a gas, it can bubble out of solution uncontrollably, like what happens when you shake a soda can and then immediately open it.
Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 435  Recrystallization of excess solute from a supersaturated solution usually gives off energy as heat.
Commercial heat packs containing supersaturated sodium acetate (NaC H O ) 2 3 2 take advantage of this phenomenon.
You can probably find them at your local drugstore.
Most solutions we encounter are unsaturated, so knowing the solubility of the solute does not accurately express the amount of solute in these solutions.
There are several common ways of specifying the concentration of a solution.
Percent Composition There are several ways of expressing the concentration of a solution by using a percentage.
The mass/mass percent (% m/m) is defined as the mass of a solute divided by the mass of a solution times 100: If you can measure the masses of the solute and the solution, determining the mass/mass percent is easy.
Each mass must be expressed in the same units to determine the proper concentration.
EXAMPLE 2 A saline solution with a mass of 355 g has 36.5 g of NaCl dissolved in it.
What is the mass/mass percent concentration of the solution?
Solution We can substitute the quantities given in the equation for mass/mass percent: SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 436  1.
A dextrose (also called D-glucose, C H O ) solution with a mass of 2.00 × 102 g has 15.8 6 12 6 g of dextrose dissolved in it.
What is the mass/mass percent concentration of the solution?
For gases and liquids, volumes are relatively easy to measure, so the concentration of a liquid or a gas solution can be expressed as a volume/volume percent (% v/v): the volume of a solute divided by the volume of a solution times 100: Again, the units of the solute and the solution must be the same.
A hybrid concentration unit, mass/volume percent (% m/v), is commonly used for intravenous (IV) fluids (Figure 9.2 "Mass/Volume Percent").
It is defined as the mass in grams of a solute, divided by volume in milliliters of solution times 100: Each percent concentration can be used to produce a conversion factor between the amount of solute, the amount of solution, and the percent.
Furthermore, given any two quantities in any percent composition, the third quantity can be calculated, as the following example illustrates.
EXAMPLE 3 A sample of 45.0% v/v solution of ethanol (C H OH) in water has a volume of 115 mL.
2 5 What volume of ethanol solute does the sample contain?
Solution Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 437  A percentage concentration is simply the number of parts of solute per 100 parts of solution.
Thus, the percent concentration of 45.0% v/v implies the following: That is, there are 45 mL of C H OH for every 100 mL of solution.
We can use this fraction 2 5 as a conversion factor to determine the amount of C H OH in 115 mL of solution: 2 5 Note The highest concentration of ethanol that can be obtained normally is 95% ethanol, which is actually 95% v/v.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
What volume of a 12.75% m/v solution of glucose (C H O ) in water is needed to obtain 6 12 6 50.0 g of C H O ?
6 12 6 EXAMPLE 4 A normal saline IV solution contains 9.0 g of NaCl in every liter of solution.
What is the mass/volume percent of normal saline?
Solution We can use the definition of mass/volume percent, but first we have to express the volume in milliliter units: 1 L = 1,000 mL Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 438  Because this is an exact relationship, it does not affect the significant figures of our result.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE The chlorine bleach that you might find in your laundry room is typically composed of 27.0 g of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), dissolved to make 500.0 mL of solution.
What is the mass/volume percent of the bleach?
In addition to percentage units, the units for expressing the concentration of extremely dilute solutions are parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb).
Both of these units are mass based and are defined as follows: Note Similar to parts per million and parts per billion, related units include parts per thousand (ppth) and parts per trillion (ppt).
Concentrations of trace elements in the body—elements that are present in extremely low concentrations but are nonetheless necessary for life—are commonly expressed in parts per million or parts per billion.
Concentrations of poisons and pollutants are also described in these units.
For example, cobalt is present in the body at a concentration of 21 ppb, while the State of Oregon’s Department of Agriculture limits the concentration of arsenic in fertilizers to 9 ppm.
Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 439  In aqueous solutions, 1 ppm is essentially equal to 1 mg/L, and 1 ppb is equivalent to 1 µg/L.
EXAMPLE 5 If the concentration of cobalt in a human body is 21 ppb, what mass in grams of Co is present in a body having a mass of 70.0 kg?
Solution A concentration of 21 ppb means “21 g of solute per 1,000,000,000 g of solution.” Written as a conversion factor, this concentration of Co is as follows: We can use this as a conversion factor, but first we must convert 70.0 kg to gram units: Now we determine the amount of Co: This is only 1.5 mg. SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
An 85 kg body contains 0.012 g of Ni.
What is the concentration of Ni in parts per million?
Molarity Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 440  Another way of expressing concentration is to give the number of moles of solute per unit volume of solution.
Such concentration units are useful for discussing chemical reactions in which a solute is a product or a reactant.
Molar mass can then be used as a conversion factor to convert amounts in moles to amounts in grams.
Molarity is defined as the number of moles of a solute dissolved per liter of solution: Molarity is abbreviated M (often referred to as “molar”), and the units are often abbreviated as mol/L.
It is important to remember that “mol” in this expression refers to moles of solute and that “L” refers to liters of solution.
For example, if you have 1.5 mol of NaCl dissolved in 0.500 L of solution, its molarity is therefore which is read as “three point oh molar sodium chloride.” Sometimes (aq) is added when the solvent is water, as in “3.0 M NaCl(aq).” Before a molarity concentration can be calculated, the amount of the solute must be expressed in moles, and the volume of the solution must be expressed in liters, as demonstrated in the following example.
EXAMPLE 6 What is the molarity of an aqueous solution of 25.0 g of NaOH in 750 mL?
Solution Before we substitute these quantities into the definition of molarity, we must convert them to the proper units.
The mass of NaOH must be converted to moles of NaOH.
The molar mass of NaOH is 40.00 g/mol: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 441  Next, we convert the volume units from milliliters to liters: Now that the quantities are expressed in the proper units, we can substitute them into the definition of molarity: SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
If a 350 mL cup of coffee contains 0.150 g of caffeine (C H N O ), what is the molarity 8 10 4 2 of this caffeine solution?
The definition of molarity can also be used to calculate a needed volume of solution, given its concentration and the number of moles desired, or the number of moles of solute (and subsequently, the mass of the solute), given its concentration and volume.
The following example illustrates this.
EXAMPLE 7 1.
What volume of a 0.0753 M solution of dimethylamine [(CH ) NH] is needed to obtain 3 2 0.450 mol of the compound?
2.
Ethylene glycol (C H O ) is mixed with water to make auto engine coolants.
How many 2 6 2 grams of C H O are in 5.00 L of a 6.00 M aqueous solution?
2 6 2 Solution In both parts, we will use the definition of molarity to solve for the desired quantity.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 442  1.
To solve for the volume of solution, we multiply both sides by volume of solution and divide both sides by the molarity value to isolate the volume of solution on one side of the equation: Note that because the definition of molarity is mol/L, the division of mol by M yields L, a unit of volume.
2.
The molar mass of C H O is 62.08 g/mol., so 2 6 2 To solve for the number of moles of solute, we multiply both sides by the volume: moles of solute = (6.00 M)(5.00 L) = 30.0 mol Note that because the definition of molarity is mol/L, the product M × L gives mol, a unit of amount.
Now, using the molar mass of C H O , we convert mol to g: 3 8 3 Thus, there are 1,860 g of C H O in the specified amount of engine coolant.
2 6 2 Note Dimethylamine has a “fishy” odor.
In fact, organic compounds called amines cause the odor of decaying fish.

Using Molarity in Stoichiometry Problems Of all the ways of expressing concentration, molarity is the one most commonly used in stoichiometry problems because it is directly related to the mole unit.
Consider the following chemical equation: HCl(aq) + NaOH(s) → H O(ℓ) + NaCl(aq) 2 Suppose we want to know how many liters of aqueous HCl solution will react with a given mass of NaOH.
A typical approach to answering this question is as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 444  In itself, each step is a straightforward conversion.
It is the combination of the steps that is a powerful quantitative tool for problem solving.
EXAMPLE 8 How many milliliters of a 2.75 M HCl solution are needed to react with 185 g of NaOH?
The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is as follows: HCl(aq) + NaOH(s) → H O(ℓ) + NaCl(aq) 2 Solution We will follow the flowchart to answer this question.
First, we convert the mass of NaOH to moles of NaOH using its molar mass, 40.00 g/mol: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 445  Using the balanced chemical equation, we see that there is a one-to-one ratio of moles of HCl to moles of NaOH.
We use this to determine the number of moles of HCl needed to react with the given amount of NaOH: Finally, we use the definition of molarity to determine the volume of 2.75 M HCl needed: We need 1,680 mL of 2.75 M HCl to react with the NaOH.

You may want to consult this figure when working with solutions in chemical reactions.

Looking Closer: The Dose Makes the Poison Why is it that we can drink 1 qt of water when we are thirsty and not be harmed, but if we ingest 0.5 g of arsenic, we might die?
There is an old saying: the dose makes the poison.
This means that what may be dangerous in some amounts may not be dangerous in other amounts.
Take arsenic, for example.
Some studies show that arsenic deprivation limits the growth of animals such as chickens, goats, and pigs, suggesting that arsenic is actually an essential trace element in the diet.
Humans are constantly exposed to tiny amounts of arsenic from the environment, so studies of completely arsenic-free humans are not Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 448  available; if arsenic is an essential trace mineral in human diets, it is probably required on the order of 50 ppb or less.
A toxic dose of arsenic corresponds to about 7,000 ppb and higher, which is over 140 times the trace amount that may be required by the body.
Thus, arsenic is not poisonous in and of itself.
Rather, it is the amount that is dangerous: the dose makes the poison.
Similarly, as much as water is needed to keep us alive, too much of it is also risky to our health.
Drinking too much water too fast can lead to a condition called water intoxication, which may be fatal.
The danger in water intoxication is not that water itself becomes toxic.
It is that the ingestion of too much water too fast dilutes sodium ions, potassium ions, and other salts in the bloodstream to concentrations that are not high enough to support brain, muscle, and heart functions.
Military personnel, endurance athletes, and even desert hikers are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink water but do not replenish the salts lost in sweat.
As this example shows, even the right substances in the wrong amounts can be dangerous!
Equivalents Concentrations of ionic solutes are occasionally expressed in units calledequivalents (Eq).
One equivalent equals 1 mol of positive or negative charge.
Thus, 1 mol/L of Na+(aq) is also 1 Eq/L because sodium has a 1+ charge.
A 1 mol/L solution of Ca2+(aq) ions has a concentration of 2 Eq/L because calcium has a 2+ charge.
Dilute solutions may be expressed in milliequivalents (mEq)—for example, human blood plasma has a total concentration of about 150 mEq/L.
(For more information about the ions present in blood plasma, see Chapter 3 "Ionic Bonding and Simple Ionic Compounds", Section 3.3 "Formulas for Ionic Compounds".)
Dilution When solvent is added to dilute a solution, the volume of the solution changes, but the amount of solute does not change.
Before dilution, the amount of solute was equal to its original concentration times its original volume: amount in moles = (concentration × volume) initial Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 449  After dilution, the same amount of solute is equal to the final concentration times the final volume: amount in moles = (concentration × volume) final To determine a concentration or amount after a dilution, we can use the following equation: (concentration × volume) = (concentration × volume) initial final Any units of concentration and volume can be used, as long as both concentrations and both volumes have the same unit.
EXAMPLE 9 A 125 mL sample of 0.900 M NaCl is diluted to 1,125 mL.
What is the final concentration of the diluted solution?
Solution Because the volume units are the same, and we are looking for the molarity of the final solution, we can use (concentration × volume) = (concentration × volume) : initial final (0.900 M × 125 mL) = (concentration × 1,125 mL) We solve by isolating the unknown concentration by itself on one side of the equation.
Dividing by 1,125 mL gives as the final concentration.

Describe the dissolution process at the molecular level.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 456  What occurs at the molecular level to cause a solute to dissolve in a solvent?
The answer depends in part on the solute, but there are some similarities common to all solutes.
Recall the rule that like dissolves like.
As we saw in Section 9.1 "Solutions", this means that substances must have similar intermolecular forces to form solutions.
When a soluble solute is introduced into a solvent, the particles of solute can interact with the particles of solvent.
In the case of a solid or liquid solute, the interactions between the solute particles and the solvent particles are so strong that the individual solute particles separate from each other and, surrounded by solvent molecules, enter the solution.
(Gaseous solutes already have their constituent particles separated, but the concept of being surrounded by solvent particles still applies.)
This process is called solvation.
When the solvent is water, the word hydration, rather than solvation, is used.
In the case of molecular solutes like glucose, the solute particles are individual molecules.
However, if the solute is ionic, the individual ions separate from each other and become surrounded by solvent particles.
That is, the cations and anions of an ionic solute separate when the solute dissolves.
This process is referred to as dissociation.
The dissociation of soluble ionic compounds gives solutions of these compounds an interesting property: they conduct electricity.
Because of this property, soluble ionic compounds are referred to as electrolytes.
Many ionic compounds dissociate completely and are therefore called strong electrolytes.
Sodium chloride is an example of a strong electrolyte.
Some compounds dissolve but dissociate only partially, and solutions of such solutes may conduct electricity only weakly.
These solutes are called weak electrolytes.
Acetic acid (CH COOH), the compound in vinegar, is a weak electrolyte.
Solutes that 3 dissolve into individual neutral molecules without dissociation do not impart additional electrical conductivity to their solutions and are called nonelectrolytes.
Table sugar (C H O ) is an example of a nonelectrolyte.
12 22 11 Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 457  The term electrolyte is used in medicine to mean any of the important ions that are dissolved in aqueous solution in the body.
Important physiological electrolytes include Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl−.
EXAMPLE 10 The following substances all dissolve to some extent in water.
Classify each as an electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.
1. potassium chloride (KCl) 2. fructose (C H O ) 6 12 6 3. isopropyl alcohol [CH CH(OH)CH ] 3 3 4. magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH) ] 2 Solution Each substance can be classified as an ionic solute or a nonionic solute.
Ionic solutes are electrolytes, and nonionic solutes are nonelectrolytes.
1.
Potassium chloride is an ionic compound; therefore, when it dissolves, its ions separate, making it an electrolyte.
2.
Fructose is a sugar similar to glucose.
(In fact, it has the same molecular formula as glucose.)
Because it is a molecular compound, we expect it to be a nonelectrolyte.
3.
Isopropyl alcohol is an organic molecule containing the alcohol functional group.
The bonding in the compound is all covalent, so when isopropyl alcohol dissolves, it separates into individual molecules but not ions.
Thus, it is a nonelectrolyte.
4.
Magnesium hydroxide is an ionic compound, so when it dissolves it dissociates.
Thus, magnesium hydroxide is an electrolyte.
Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 458  More information than that provided in this chapter is needed to determine if some electrolytes are strong or weak.
We will consider this in Chapter 10 "Acids and Bases".

Describe how the properties of solutions differ from those of pure solvents.
Solutions are likely to have properties similar to those of their major component— usually the solvent.
However, some solution properties differ significantly from those of the solvent.
Here, we will focus on liquid solutions that have a solid solute, but many of the effects we will discuss in this section are applicable to all solutions.
Colligative Properties Solutes affect some properties of solutions that depend only on the concentration of the dissolved particles.
These properties are called colligative properties.
Four important colligative properties that we will examine here are vapor pressure depression, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure.
Molecular compounds separate into individual molecules when they are dissolved, so for every 1 mol of molecules dissolved, we get 1 mol of particles.
In contrast, ionic compounds separate into their constituent ions when they dissolve, so 1 mol of an ionic compound will produce more than 1 mol of dissolved particles.
For example, every mole of NaCl that dissolves yields 1 mol of Na+ ions and 1 mol of Cl− ions, for a total of 2 mol of particles in solution.
Thus, the effect on a solution’s properties by dissolving NaCl may be twice as large as the effect of dissolving the same amount of moles of glucose (C H O ).
6 12 6 Vapor Pressure Depression All liquids evaporate.
In fact, given enough volume, a liquid will turn completely into a vapor.
If enough volume is not present, a liquid will evaporate only to the point where the rate of evaporation equals the rate of vapor condensing back into a liquid.
The pressure of the vapor at this point is called the vapor pressure of the liquid.
The presence of a dissolved solid lowers the characteristic vapor pressure of a liquid so that it evaporates more slowly.
(The exceptions to this statement are if the solute itself is a liquid or a gas, in which case the solute will also contribute something to the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 462  evaporation process.
We will not discuss such solutions here.)
This property is called vapor pressure depression and is depicted in Figure 9.6 "Vapor Pressure Depression".
Figure 9.6 Vapor Pressure Depression The presence of solute particles blocks some of the ability for liquid particles to evaporate.
Thus, solutions of solid solutes typically have a lower vapor pressure than the pure solvent.
Boiling Point and Freezing Point Effects A related property of solutions is that their boiling points are higher than the boiling point of the pure solvent.
Because the presence of solute particles decreases the vapor pressure of the liquid solvent, a higher temperature is needed to reach the boiling point.
This phenomenon is called boiling point elevation.
For every mole of particles dissolved in a liter of water, the boiling point of water increases by about 0.5°C.
Note Some people argue that putting a pinch or two of salt in water used to cook spaghetti or other pasta makes a solution that has a higher boiling point, so the pasta cooks faster.
In actuality, the amount of solute is so small that the boiling point of the water is practically unchanged.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 463  The presence of solute particles has the opposite effect on the freezing point of a solution.
When a solution freezes, only the solvent particles come together to form a solid phase, and the presence of solute particles interferes with that process.
Therefore, for the liquid solvent to freeze, more energy must be removed from the solution, which lowers the temperature.
Thus, solutions have lower freezing points than pure solvents do.
This phenomenon is called freezing point depression.
For every mole of particles in a liter of water, the freezing point decreases by about 1.9°C.
Both boiling point elevation and freezing point depression have practical uses.
For example, solutions of water and ethylene glycol (C H O ) are used as coolants in 2 6 2 automobile engines because the boiling point of such a solution is greater than 100°C, the normal boiling point of water.
In winter, salts like NaCl and CaCl are sprinkled on 2 the ground to melt ice or keep ice from forming on roads and sidewalks.
This is because the solution made by dissolving sodium chloride or calcium chloride in water has a lower freezing point than pure water, so the formation of ice is inhibited.
EXAMPLE 11 Which solution’s freezing point deviates more from that of pure water—a 1 M solution of NaCl or a 1 M solution of CaCl ?
2 Solution Colligative properties depend on the number of dissolved particles, so the solution with the greater number of particles in solution will show the greatest deviation.
When NaCl dissolves, it separates into two ions, Na+ and Cl−.
But when CaCl dissolves, it separates 2 into three ions—one Ca2+ ion and two Cl− ions.
Thus, mole for mole, CaCl will have 50% 2 more impact on freezing point depression than NaCl.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 464  1.
Which solution’s boiling point deviates more from that of pure water—a 1 M solution of CaCl or a 1 M solution of MgSO ?
2 4 Osmotic Pressure The last colligative property of solutions we will consider is a very important one for biological systems.
It involves osmosis, the process by which solvent molecules can pass through certain membranes but solute particles cannot.
When two solutions of different concentration are present on either side of these membranes (called semipermeable membranes), there is a tendency for solvent molecules to move from the more dilute solution to the more concentrated solution until the concentrations of the two solutions are equal.
This tendency is called osmotic pressure.
External pressure can be exerted on a solution to counter the flow of solvent; the pressure required to halt the osmosis of a solvent is equal to the osmotic pressure of the solution.
Osmolarity (osmol) is a way of reporting the total number of particles in a solution to determine osmotic pressure.
It is defined as the molarity of a solute times the number of particles a formula unit of the solute makes when it dissolves (represented by i): osmol = M × i If more than one solute is present in a solution, the individual osmolarities are additive to get the total osmolarity of the solution.
Solutions that have the same osmolarity have the same osmotic pressure.
If solutions of differing osmolarities are present on opposite sides of a semipermeable membrane, solvent will transfer from the lower-osmolarity solution to the higher-osmolarity solution.
Counterpressure exerted on the high- osmolarity solution will reduce or halt the solvent transfer.
An even higher pressure can be exerted to force solvent from the high-osmolarity solution to the low-osmolarity solution, a process called reverse osmosis.
Reverse osmosis is used to make potable water from saltwater where sources of fresh water are scarce.
EXAMPLE 12 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 465  A 0.50 M NaCl aqueous solution and a 0.30 M Ca(NO ) aqueous solution are placed on 3 2 opposite sides of a semipermeable membrane.
Determine the osmolarity of each solution and predict the direction of solvent flow.
Solution The solvent will flow into the solution of higher osmolarity.
The NaCl solute separates into two ions—Na+ and Cl−—when it dissolves, so its osmolarity is as follows: osmol (NaCl) = 0.50 M × 2 = 1.0 osmol The Ca(NO ) solute separates into three ions—one Ca2+ and two NO −—when it 3 2 3 dissolves, so its osmolarity is as follows: osmol [Ca(NO ) ] = 0.30 M × 3 = 0.90 osmol 3 2 The osmolarity of the Ca(NO ) solution is lower than that of the NaCl solution, so water 3 2 will transfer through the membrane from the Ca(NO ) solution to the NaCl solution.
3 2 SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
A 1.5 M C H O aqueous solution and a 0.40 M Al(NO ) aqueous solution are placed on 6 12 6 3 3 opposite sides of a semipermeable membrane.

To Your Health: Dialysis The main function of the kidneys is to filter the blood to remove wastes and extra water, which are then expelled from the body as urine.
Some diseases rob the kidneys of their ability to perform this function, causing a buildup of waste materials in the bloodstream.
If a kidney transplant is not available or desirable, a procedure called dialysis can be used to remove waste materials and excess water from the blood.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 466  In one form of dialysis, called hemodialysis, a patient’s blood is passed though a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine (also called adialysis machine).
A section of tubing composed of a semipermeable membrane is immersed in a solution of sterile water, glucose, amino acids, and certain electrolytes.
The osmotic pressure of the blood forces waste molecules and excess water through the membrane into the sterile solution.
Red and white blood cells are too large to pass through the membrane, so they remain in the blood.
After being cleansed in this way, the blood is returned to the body.
Dialysis is a continuous process, as the osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time.
Typically, 5–10 lb of waste-containing fluid is removed in each dialysis session, which can last 2–8 hours and must be performed several times a week.
Although some patients have been on dialysis for 30 or more years, dialysis is always a temporary solution because waste materials are constantly building up in the bloodstream.
A more permanent solution is a kidney transplant.
Cell walls are semipermeable membranes, so the osmotic pressures of the body’s fluids have important biological consequences.
If solutions of different osmolarity exist on either side of the cells, solvent (water) may pass into or out of the cells, sometimes with disastrous results.
Consider what happens if red blood cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, meaning a solution of lower osmolarity than the liquid inside the cells.
The cells swell up as water enters them, disrupting cellular activity and eventually causing the cells to burst.
This process is called hemolysis.
If red blood cells are placed in ahypertonic solution, meaning one having a higher osmolarity than exists inside the cells, water leaves the cells to dilute the external solution, and the red blood cells shrivel and die.
This process is called crenation.
Only if red blood cells are placed inisotonic solutions that have the same osmolarity as exists inside the cells are they unaffected by negative effects of osmotic pressure.
Glucose solutions of about 0.31 M, or sodium chloride solutions of about 0.16 M, are isotonic with blood plasma.
Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 467  The concentration of an isotonic sodium chloride (NaCl) solution is only half that of an isotonic glucose (C H O ) solution because NaCl produces two ions when a formula unit 6 12 6 dissolves, while molecular C H O produces only one particle when a formula unit 6 12 6 dissolves.
The osmolarities are therefore the same even though the concentrations of the two solutions are different.
Osmotic pressure explains why you should not drink seawater if you are abandoned in a life raft in the middle of the ocean.
Its osmolarity is about three times higher than most bodily fluids.
You would actually become thirstier as water from your cells was drawn out to dilute the salty ocean water you ingested.
Our bodies do a better job coping with hypotonic solutions than with hypertonic ones.
The excess water is collected by our kidneys and excreted.
Osmotic pressure effects are used in the food industry to make pickles from cucumbers and other vegetables and in brining meat to make corned beef.
It is also a factor in the mechanism of getting water from the roots to the tops of trees!
Career Focus: Perfusionist A perfusionist is a medical technician trained to assist during any medical procedure in which a patient’s circulatory or breathing functions require support.
The use of perfusionists has grown rapidly since the advent of open-heart surgery in 1953.
Most perfusionists work in operating rooms, where their main responsibility is to operate heart-lung machines.
During many heart surgeries, the heart itself must be stopped.
In these situations, a heart-lung machine keeps the patient alive by aerating the blood with oxygen and removing carbon dioxide.
The perfusionist monitors both the machine and the status of the blood, notifying the surgeon and the anesthetist of any concerns and taking corrective action if the status of the blood becomes abnormal.
Despite the narrow parameters of their specialty, perfusionists must be highly trained.
Certified perfusion education programs require a student to learn anatomy, physiology, pathology, chemistry, pharmacology, math, and physics.
A college degree is usually required.
Some perfusionists work with other external artificial organs, such as hemodialysis machines and artificial livers.

9.5 End-of-Chapter Material Chapter Summary Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 472  To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.
A solution is a homogeneous mixture.
The major component is the solvent, while the minor component is the solute.
Solutions can have any phase; for example, an alloy is a solid solution.
Solutes are soluble or insoluble, meaning they dissolve or do not dissolve in a particular solvent.
The terms miscible and immiscible, instead of soluble and insoluble, are used for liquid solutes and solvents.
The statement like dissolves like is a useful guide to predicting whether a solute will dissolve in a given solvent.
The amount of solute in a solution is represented by the concentration of the solution.
The maximum amount of solute that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent is called the solubility of the solute.
Such solutions are saturated.
Solutions that have less than the maximum amount are unsaturated.
Most solutions are unsaturated, and there are various ways of stating their concentrations.
Mass/mass percent, volume/volume percent, and mass/volume percent indicate the percentage of the overall solution that is solute.
Parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb) are used to describe very small concentrations of a solute.
Molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, is a common concentration unit in the chemistry laboratory.
Equivalents express concentrations in terms of moles of charge on ions.
When a solution is diluted, we use the fact that the amount of solute remains constant to be able to determine the volume or concentration of the final diluted solution.
Dissolving occurs by solvation, the process in which particles of a solvent surround the individual particles of a solute, separating them to make a solution.
For water solutions, the word hydration is used.
If the solute is molecular, it dissolves into individual molecules.
If the solute is ionic, the individual ions separate from each other, forming a solution that conducts electricity.
Such solutions are called electrolytes.
If the dissociation of ions is complete, the solution is a strong electrolyte.
If the dissociation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 473  is only partial, the solution is a weak electrolyte.
Solutions of molecules do not conduct electricity and are called nonelectrolytes.
Solutions have properties that differ from those of the pure solvent.
Some of these are colligative properties, which are due to the number of solute particles dissolved, not the chemical identity of the solute.
Colligative properties include vapor pressure depression, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure.
Osmotic pressure is particularly important in biological systems.
It is caused by osmosis, the passage of solvents through certain membranes like cell walls.
The osmolarity of a solution is the product of a solution’s molarity and the number of particles a solute separates into when it dissolves.
Osmosis can be reversed by the application of pressure; this reverse osmosis is used to make fresh water from saltwater in some parts of the world.
Because of osmosis, red blood cells placed in hypotonic or hypertonic solutions lose function through either hemolysis or crenation.
If they are placed in isotonic solutions, however, the cells are unaffected because osmotic pressure is equal on either side of the cell membrane.

Occasionally we hear a sensational news story about people stranded in a lifeboat on the ocean who had to drink their own urine to survive.
While distasteful, this act was probably necessary for survival.
Why not simply drink the ocean water?

The osmotic pressure of seawater is too high.
Drinking seawater would cause water to go from inside our cells into the more concentrated seawater, ultimately killing the cells.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 476  Chapter 10 Acids and Bases Opening Essay One of the most concentrated acids in the body is stomach acid, which can be approximated as a 0.05 M hydrochloric acid solution.
Special cells in the stomach wall secrete this acid, along with special enzymes, as part of the digestion process.
In a laboratory, a 0.05 M solution of hydrochloric acid would dissolve some metals.
How does the stomach survive the presence of such a reactive acid?
Actually, the stomach has several mechanisms for withstanding this chemical onslaught.
First, the lining of the stomach is coated with a thin layer of mucus that contains some bicarbonate ions (HCO −).
These react with the hydrochloric acid to produce water, 3 carbon dioxide, and harmless chloride ions.
If any acid penetrates through the mucus, it can attack the surface layer of stomach cells, called the gastric epithelium.
Cells in the gastric epithelium are being constantly shed, so damaged cells are quickly removed and replaced with healthy cells.
However, if the gastric epithelium is destroyed faster than it can be replaced, the acid may reach the wall of the stomach, resulting in ulcers.
If an ulcer grows large enough, it can expose blood vessels in the stomach wall, causing bleeding.
In extreme situations, the loss of blood through a severe ulcer can threaten a person’s health.
Ulcers can also result from the presence of a certain bacterium—Helicobacter pylori—in the stomach.
The mechanism for this ulcer formation is not the same as that for ulcers caused by stomach acid and is not completely understood.
However, there are two main treatments for ulcers: (1) antacids to react chemically with excess hydrochloric acid in the stomach and (2) antibiotics to destroy the H. pylori bacteria in the stomach.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 477  Many of us are familiar with the group of chemicals called acids.
But do you know what it takes for a compound to be an acid?
Actually, there are several different definitions of acid that chemistry uses, and each definition is appropriate under different circumstances.
Less familiar—but just as important to chemistry and ultimately to us—is the group of chemicals known as bases.
Both acids and bases are important enough that we devote an entire chapter to them—their properties and their reactions.
10.1 Arrhenius Definition of Acids and Bases LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Recognize a compound as an Arrhenius acid or an Arrhenius base.
One way to define a class of compounds is by describing the various characteristics its members have in common.
In the case of the compounds known as acids, the common characteristics include a sour taste, the ability to change the color of the vegetable dye litmus to red, and the ability to dissolve certain metals and simultaneously produce hydrogen gas.
For the compounds called bases, the common characteristics are a slippery texture, a bitter taste, and the ability to change the color of litmus to blue.
Acids and bases also react with each other to form compounds generally known as salts.
Note Although we include their tastes among the common characteristics of acids and bases, we never advocate tasting an unknown chemical!
Chemists prefer, however, to have definitions for acids and bases in chemical terms.
The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius developed the first chemical definitions of acids and bases in the late 1800s.
Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound that increases the concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) in aqueous solution.
Many acids are simple Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 478  compounds that release a hydrogen cation into solution when they dissolve.
Similarly, Arrhenius defined a base as a compound that increases the concentration of hydroxide ion (OH−) in aqueous solution.
Many bases are ionic compounds that have the hydroxide ion as their anion, which is released when the base dissolves in water.
Many bases and their aqueous solutions are named using the normal rules of ionic compounds that were presented in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch03, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch03_s04; that is, they are named as hydroxide compounds.
For example, the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is both an ionic compound and an aqueous solution.
However, aqueous solutions of acids have their own naming rules.
The names of binary acids (compounds with hydrogen and one other element in their formula) are based on the root of the name of the other element preceded by the prefix hydro- and followed by the suffix -ic acid.
Thus, an aqueous solution of HCl [designated “HCl(aq)”] is called hydrochloric acid, H S(aq) is 2 called hydrosulfuric acid, and so forth.
Acids composed of more than two elements (typically hydrogen and oxygen and some other element) have names based on the name of the other element, followed by the suffix -ic acid or -ous acid, depending on the number of oxygen atoms in the acid’s formula.
Other prefixes, like per- and hypo-, also appear in the names for some acids.
Unfortunately, there is no strict rule for the number of oxygen atoms that are associated with the -ic acid suffix; the names of these acids are best memorized.http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch10_s01_t01lists some acids and bases and their names.
Note that acids have hydrogen written first, as if it were the cation, while most bases have the negative hydroxide ion, if it appears in the formula, written last.
Note The name oxygen comes from the Latin meaning “acid producer” because its discoverer, Antoine Lavoisier, thought it was the essential element in acids.
Lavoisier was wrong, but it is too late to change the name now.

How does this compound increase the amount of hydroxide ion in aqueous solution?
Instead of dissociating into hydroxide ions, ammonia molecules react with water molecules by taking a hydrogen ion from the water molecule to produce an ammonium ion and a hydroxide ion: NH (aq) + H O(ℓ) → NH +(aq) + OH−(aq) 3 2 4 Because this reaction of ammonia with water causes an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions in solution, ammonia satisfies the Arrhenius definition of a base.
Many other nitrogen-containing compounds are bases because they too react with water to produce hydroxide ions in aqueous solution.
As we noted previously, acids and bases react chemically with each other to form salts.
A salt is a general chemical term for any ionic compound formed from an acid and a base.
In reactions where the acid is a hydrogen ion containing compound and the base is a hydroxide ion containing compound, water is also a product.
The general reaction is as follows: acid + base → water + salt The reaction of acid and base to make water and a salt is called neutralization.
Like any chemical equation, a neutralization chemical equation must be properly balanced.
For example, the neutralization reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid is as follows: NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H O(ℓ) 2 with coefficients all understood to be one.
The neutralization reaction between sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid is as follows: 2NaOH(aq) + H SO (aq) → Na SO (aq) + 2H O(ℓ) 2 4 2 4 2 Once a neutralization reaction is properly balanced, we can use it to perform stoichiometry calculations, such as the ones we practiced Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 482  in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch05and http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch06.

What volume of 2 0.432 M HNO solution is necessary to neutralize the Ca(OH) solution?
3 2 Solution 1.
Because there are two OH− ions in the formula for Ca(OH) , we need two moles of 2 HNO to provide H+ ions.
The balanced chemical equation is as follows: 3 Ca(OH) (aq) + 2HNO (aq) → Ca(NO ) (aq) + 2H O(ℓ) 2 3 3 2 2 The salt formed is calcium nitrate.
2.
This calculation is much like the calculations we did in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch06.
First we convert the mass of HNO to moles using its molar mass of 1.01 + 14.00 + 3(16.00) = 63.01 g/mol; 3 then we use the balanced chemical equation to determine the related number of moles of Ca(OH) needed to neutralize it; and then we convert that number of moles of 2 Ca(OH) to the mass of Ca(OH) using its molar mass of 40.08 + 2(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 2 2 74.10 g/mol.

Having concentration information allows us to employ the skills we developed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch09.
First, we use the concentration and volume data to determine the number of moles of Ca(OH) present.
2 Recognizing that 805 mL = 0.805 L, (0.672 M CaOH) × (0.805 L soln) = mol Ca(OH) = 0.541 mol Ca(OH) 2 2 2 We combine this information with the proper ratio from the balanced chemical equation to determine the number of moles of HNO needed: 3 Now, using the definition of molarity one more time, we determine the volume of acid solution needed: SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.

0.488 g 10.2 Brønsted-Lowry Definition of Acids and Bases LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Recognize a compound as a Brønsted-Lowry acid or a Brønsted-Lowry base.
2.
Illustrate the proton transfer process that defines a Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 488  Ammonia (NH ) increases the hydroxide ion concentration in aqueous solution by 3 reacting with water rather than releasing hydroxide ions directly.
In fact, the Arrhenius definitions of an acid and a base focus on hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions.
Are there more fundamental definitions for acids and bases?
In 1923, the Danish scientist Johannes Brønsted and the English scientist Thomas Lowry independently proposed new definitions for acids and bases.
Rather than considering both hydrogen and hydroxide ions, they focused on the hydrogen ion only.
A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a compound that supplies a hydrogen ion in a reaction.
A Brønsted-Lowry base, conversely, is a compound that accepts a hydrogen ion in a reaction.
Thus, the Brønsted-Lowry definitions of an acid and a base focus on the movement of hydrogen ions in a reaction, rather than on the production of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in an aqueous solution.
Let us use the reaction of ammonia in water to demonstrate the Brønsted-Lowry definitions of an acid and a base.
Ammonia and water molecules are reactants, while the ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion are products: NH (aq) + H O(ℓ) → NH +(aq) + OH−(aq) 3 2 4 What has happened in this reaction is that the original water molecule has donated a hydrogen ion to the original ammonia molecule, which in turn has accepted the hydrogen ion.
We can illustrate this as follows: Because the water molecule donates a hydrogen ion to the ammonia, it is the Brønsted- Lowry acid, while the ammonia molecule—which accepts the hydrogen ion—is the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 489  Brønsted-Lowry base.
Thus, ammonia acts as a base in both the Arrhenius sense and the Brønsted-Lowry sense.
Is an Arrhenius acid like hydrochloric acid still an acid in the Brønsted-Lowry sense?
Yes, but it requires us to understand what really happens when HCl is dissolved in water.
Recall that the hydrogen atom is a single proton surrounded by a single electron.
To make the hydrogen ion, we remove the electron, leaving a bare proton.
Do we really have bare protons floating around in aqueous solution?
No, we do not.
What really happens is that the H+ ion attaches itself to H O to make H O+, which is called 2 3 the hydronium ion.
For most purposes, H+ and H O+ represent the same species, but 3 writing H O+ instead of H+ shows that we understand that there are no bare protons 3 floating around in solution.
Rather, these protons are actually attached to solvent molecules.
Note A proton in aqueous solution may be surrounded by more than one water molecule, leading to formulas like H O + or H O + rather than H O+.
It is simpler, however, to use 5 2 9 4 3 H O+.
3 With this in mind, how do we define HCl as an acid in the Brønsted-Lowry sense?
Consider what happens when HCl is dissolved in H O: 2 HCl + H O(ℓ) → H O+(aq) + Cl−(aq) 2 3 We can depict this process using Lewis electron dot diagrams: Now we see that a hydrogen ion is transferred from the HCl molecule to the H O 2 molecule to make chloride ions and hydronium ions.
As the hydrogen ion donor, HCl acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid; as a hydrogen ion acceptor, H O is a Brønsted-Lowry 2 base.
So HCl is an acid not just in the Arrhenius sense but also in the Brønsted-Lowry sense.
Moreover, by the Brønsted-Lowry definitions, H O is a base in the formation of 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 490  aqueous HCl.
So the Brønsted-Lowry definitions of an acid and a base classify the dissolving of HCl in water as a reaction between an acid and a base—although the Arrhenius definition would not have labeled H O a base in this circumstance.
2 Note All Arrhenius acids and bases are Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases as well.
But not all Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases are Arrhenius acids and bases.
EXAMPLE 3 Aniline (C H NH ) is slightly soluble in water.
It has a nitrogen atom that can accept a 6 5 2 hydrogen ion from a water molecule just like the nitrogen atom in ammonia does.
Write the chemical equation for this reaction and identify the Brønsted-Lowry acid and base.
Solution C H NH and H O are the reactants.
When C H NH accepts a proton from H O, it gains 6 5 2 2 6 5 2 2 an extra H and a positive charge and leaves an OH− ion behind.
The reaction is as follows: C H NH (aq) + H O(ℓ) → C H NH +(aq) + OH−(aq) 6 5 2 2 6 5 3 Because C H NH accepts a proton, it is the Brønsted-Lowry base.
The H O molecule, 6 5 2 2 because it donates a proton, is the Brønsted-Lowry acid.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Caffeine (C H N O ) is a stimulant found in coffees and teas.
When dissolved in water, it 8 10 4 2 can accept a proton from a water molecule.
Write the chemical equation for this process and identify the Brønsted-Lowry acid and base.
The Brønsted-Lowry definitions of an acid and a base can be applied to chemical reactions that occur in solvents other than water.
The following example illustrates.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 491  EXAMPLE 4 Sodium amide (NaNH ) dissolves in methanol (CH OH) and separates into sodium ions 2 3 and amide ions (NH −).
The amide ions react with methanol to make ammonia and the 2 methoxide ion (CH O−).
Write a balanced chemical equation for this process and identify 3 the Brønsted-Lowry acid and base.
Solution The equation for the reaction is between NH − and CH OH to make NH and CH O− is as 2 3 3 3 follows: NH −(solv) + CH OH(ℓ) → NH (solv) + CH O−(solv) 2 3 3 3 The label (solv) indicates that the species are dissolved in some solvent, in contrast to(aq), which specifies an aqueous (H O) solution.
In this reaction, we see that the 2 NH −ion accepts a proton from a CH OH molecule to make an NH molecule.
Thus, as the 2 3 3 proton acceptor, NH − is the Brønsted-Lowry base.
As the proton donor, CH OH is the 2 3 Brønsted-Lowry acid.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Pyridinium chloride (C H NHCl) dissolves in ethanol (C H OH) and separates into 5 5 2 5 pyridinium ions (C H NH+) and chloride ions.
The pyridinium ion can transfer a hydrogen 5 5 ion to a solvent molecule.
Write a balanced chemical equation for this process and identify the Brønsted-Lowry acid and base.
To Your Health: Brønsted-Lowry Acid-Base Reactions in Pharmaceuticals There are many interesting applications of Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions in the pharmaceutical industry.
For example, drugs often need to be water soluble for maximum effectiveness.
However, many complex organic compounds are not soluble or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 492  are only slightly soluble in water.
Fortunately, those drugs that contain proton-accepting nitrogen atoms (and there are a lot of them) can be reacted with dilute hydrochloric acid [HCl(aq)].
The nitrogen atoms—acting as Brønsted-Lowry bases—accept the hydrogen ions from the acid to make an ion, which is usually much more soluble in water.
The modified drug molecules can then be isolated as chloride salts: where RN represents some organic compound containing nitrogen.
The label (sl aq) means “slightly aqueous,” indicating that the compound RN is only slightly soluble.
Drugs that are modified in this way are called hydrochloride salts.
Examples include the powerful painkiller codeine, which is commonly administered as codeine hydrochloride.
Acids other than hydrochloric acid are also used.
Hydrobromic acid, for example, gives hydrobromide salts.
Dextromethorphan, an ingredient in many cough medicines, is dispensed as dextromethorphan hydrobromide.
The accompanying figure shows another medication as a hydrochloride salt.

Write chemical equations for water acting as an acid and as a base.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 495  Water (H O) is an interesting compound in many respects.
Here, we will consider its 2 ability to behave as an acid or a base.
In some circumstances, a water molecule will accept a proton and thus act as a Brønsted-Lowry base.
We saw an example in the dissolving of HCl in H O: 2 HCl + H O(ℓ) → H O+(aq) + Cl−(aq) 2 3 In other circumstances, a water molecule can donate a proton and thus act as a Brønsted-Lowry acid.
For example, in the presence of the amide ion (see Example 4 inhttp://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s02), a water molecule donates a proton, making ammonia as a product: H O(ℓ) + NH −(aq) → OH−(aq) + NH (aq) 2 2 3 In this case, NH − is a Brønsted-Lowry base (the proton acceptor).
2 So, depending on the circumstances, H O can act as either a Brønsted-Lowry acid or a 2 Brønsted-Lowry base.
Water is not the only substance that can react as an acid in some cases or a base in others, but it is certainly the most common example—and the most important one.
A substance that can either donate or accept a proton, depending on the circumstances, is called an amphiprotic compound.
A water molecule can act as an acid or a base even in a sample of pure water.
About 6 in every 100 million (6 in 108) water molecules undergo the following reaction: H O(ℓ) + H O(ℓ) → H O+(aq) + OH−(aq) 2 2 3 This process is called the autoionization of water (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s03_f01) and occurs in every sample of water, whether it is pure or part of a solution.
Autoionization occurs to some extent in any amphiprotic liquid.
(For comparison, liquid ammonia undergoes autoionization as well, but only about 1 molecule in a million billion (1 in 1015) reacts with another ammonia molecule.)
Figure 10.2 Autoionization Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 496  A small fraction of water molecules—approximately 6 in 100 million—ionize spontaneously into hydronium ions and hydroxide ions.
This picture necessarily overrepresents the amount of autoionization that really occurs in pure water.

Describe the difference between strong and weak acids and bases.
2.
Describe how a chemical reaction reaches chemical equilibrium.
3.
Define the pH scale and use it to describe acids and bases.
Acids and bases do not all demonstrate the same degree of chemical activity in solution.
Different acids and bases have different strengths.
Strong and Weak Acids Let us consider the strengths of acids first.
A small number of acids ionize completely in aqueous solution.
For example, when HCl dissolves in water, every molecule of HCl separates into a hydronium ion and a chloride ion: HCl(aq) is one example of a strong acid, which is a compound that is essentially 100% ionized in aqueous solution.
There are very few strong acids.
The important ones are listed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s04_s01_t01.
Table 10.2 Strong Acids and Bases (All in Aqueous Solution) Acids Bases HCl LiOH HBr NaOH HI KOH HNO Mg(OH) 3 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 500  Acids Bases H SO Ca(OH) 2 4 2 HClO 4 By analogy, a strong base is a compound that is essentially 100% ionized in aqueous solution.
As with acids, there are only a few strong bases, which are also listed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s04_s01_t01.
If an acid is not listed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch10_s04_s01_t01, it is likely a weak acid, which is a compound that is not 100% ionized in aqueous solution.
Similarly, a weak base is a compound that is not 100% ionized in aqueous solution.
For example, acetic acid (HC H O ) is a weak acid.
The ionization 2 3 2 reaction for acetic acid is as follows: HC H O (aq) + H O(ℓ) → H O+(aq) + C H O −(aq) 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 2 Depending on the concentration of HC H O , the ionization reaction may occur only for 2 3 2 1%–5% of the acetic acid molecules.
Looking Closer: Household Acids and Bases Many household products are acids or bases.
For example, the owner of a swimming pool may use muriatic acid to clean the pool.
Muriatic acid is another name for hydrochloric acid [HCl(aq)].
Vinegar has already been mentioned as a dilute solution of acetic acid [HC H O (aq)].
In a medicine chest, one may find a bottle of vitamin C 2 3 2 tablets; the chemical name of vitamin C is ascorbic acid (HC H O ).
6 7 6 One of the more familiar household bases is ammonia (NH ), which is found in 3 numerous cleaning products.
As we mentioned previously, ammonia is a base because it increases the hydroxide ion concentration by reacting with water: NH (aq) + H O(ℓ) → NH +(aq) + OH−(aq) 3 2 4 Many soaps are also slightly basic because they contain compounds that act as Brønsted-Lowry bases, accepting protons from water and forming excess hydroxide ions.
This is one reason that soap solutions are slippery.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 501  Perhaps the most dangerous household chemical is the lye-based drain cleaner.
Lye is a common name for sodium hydroxide, although it is also used as a synonym for potassium hydroxide.
Lye is an extremely caustic chemical that can react with grease, hair, food particles, and other substances that may build up and form a clog in a pipe.
Unfortunately, lye can also attack tissues and other substances in our bodies.
Thus, when we use lye-based drain cleaners, we must be very careful not to touch any of the solid drain cleaner or spill the water it was poured into.
Safer, nonlye drain cleaners use peroxide compounds to react on the materials in the clog and clear the drain.
Chemical Equilibrium The behavior of weak acids and bases illustrates a key concept in chemistry.
Does the chemical reaction describing the ionization of a weak acid or base just stop when the acid or base is done ionizing?
Actually, no.
Rather, the reverse process—the reformation of the molecular form of the acid or base—occurs, ultimately at the same rate as the ionization process.
For example, the ionization of the weak acid HC H O (aq) is as 2 3 2 follows: HC H O (aq) + H O(ℓ) → H O+(aq) + C H O −(aq) 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 2 The reverse process also begins to occur: H O+(aq) + C H O −(aq) → HC H O (aq) + H O(ℓ) 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 Eventually, there is a balance between the two opposing processes, and no additional change occurs.
The chemical reaction is better represented at this point with a double arrow: HC H O (aq) + H O(ℓ) ⇆ H O+(aq) + C H O −(aq) 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 2 The ⇆ implies that both the forward and reverse reactions are occurring, and their effects cancel each other out.
A process at this point is considered to be at chemical equilibrium (or equilibrium).
It is important to note that the processes do not stop.
They balance out each other so that there is no further net change; that is, chemical equilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium.
EXAMPLE 6 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 502  Write the equilibrium chemical equation for the partial ionization of each weak acid or base.

HNO (aq) 2 2.
C H N(aq) 5 5 Solution 1.

1.
HF(aq) 2.
AgOH(aq) Note Hydrofluoric acid [HF(aq)] is one chemical that reacts directly with glass.
(Very few chemicals react with glass.)
Hydrofluoric acid is used in glass etching.
Finally, you may realize that the autoionization of water is actually an equilibrium process, so it is more properly written with the double arrow: H O(ℓ) + H O(ℓ) ⇆ H O+(aq) + OH−(aq) 2 2 3 The pH Scale One qualitative measure of the strength of an acid or a base solution is the pH scale, which is based on the concentration of the hydronium (or hydrogen) ion in aqueous solution.
A neutral (neither acidic nor basic) solution, one that has the same concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions, has a pH of 7.
A pH below 7 means that a solution is acidic, with lower values of pH corresponding to increasingly acidic solutions.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 503  A pH greater than 7 indicates a basic solution, with higher values of pH corresponding to increasingly basic solutions.
Thus, given the pH of several solutions, you can state which ones are acidic, which ones are basic, and which are more acidic or basic than others.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s04_s03_t01lists the pH of several common solutions.
Notice that some biological fluids are nowhere near neutral.
Table 10.3 The pH Values of Some Common Solutions Solution pH battery acid 0.3 stomach acid 1–2 lemon or lime juice 2.1 vinegar 2.8–3.0 Coca-Cola 3 wine 2.8–3.8 beer 4–5 coffee 5 milk 6 urine 6 pure H O 7 2 (human) blood 7.3–7.5 sea water 8 antacid (milk of magnesia) 10.5 NH (1 M) 11.6 3 bleach 12.6 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 504  Solution pH NaOH (1 M) 14.0 Weak acids and bases are relatively common.
You may notice from http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s04_s03_t01that many food products are slightly acidic.
They are acidic because they contain solutions of weak acids.
If the acid components of these foods were strong acids, the food would likely be inedible.

(answers will vary) 10.5 Buffers LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Define buffer and describe how it reacts with an acid or a base.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 508  As indicated in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch10_s04, weak acids are relatively common, even in the foods we eat.
But we occasionally come across a strong acid or base, such as stomach acid, that has a strongly acidic pH of 1–2.
By definition, strong acids and bases can produce a relatively large amount of hydrogen or hydroxide ions and, as a consequence, have a marked chemical activity.
In addition, very small amounts of strong acids and bases can change the pH of a solution very quickly.
If 1 mL of stomach acid [which we will approximate as 0.05 M HCl(aq)] is added to the bloodstream, and if no correcting mechanism is present, the pH of the blood would go from about 7.4 to about 4.9—a pH that is not conducive to continued living.
Fortunately, the body has a mechanism for minimizing such dramatic pH changes.
The mechanism involves a buffer, a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH.
Buffers do so by being composed of certain pairs of solutes: either a weak acid plus a salt derived from that weak acid or a weak base plus a salt of that weak base.
For example, a buffer can be composed of dissolved acetic acid (HC H O , a weak acid) and sodium 2 3 2 acetate (NaC H O , a salt derived from that acid).
Another example of a buffer is a 2 3 2 solution containing ammonia (NH , a weak base) and ammonium chloride (NH Cl, a 3 4 salt derived from that base).
Let us use an acetic acid–sodium acetate buffer to demonstrate how buffers work.
If a strong base—a source of OH−(aq) ions—is added to the buffer solution, those hydroxide ions will react with the acetic acid in an acid-base reaction: HC H O (aq) + OH−(aq) → H O(ℓ) + C H O −(aq) 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 Rather than changing the pH dramatically by making the solution basic, the added hydroxide ions react to make water, and the pH does not change much.
Note Many people are aware of the concept of buffers from buffered aspirin, which is aspirin that also has magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, or some other salt.
The salt acts like a base, while aspirin is itself a weak acid.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 509  If a strong acid—a source of H+ ions—is added to the buffer solution, the H+ ions will react with the anion from the salt.
Because HC H O is a weak acid, it is not ionized 2 3 2 much.
This means that if lots of hydrogen ions and acetate ions (from sodium acetate) are present in the same solution, they will come together to make acetic acid: H+(aq) + C H O −(aq) → HC H O (aq) 2 3 2 2 3 2 Rather than changing the pH dramatically and making the solution acidic, the added hydrogen ions react to make molecules of a weak acid.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch10_s05_f01illustrates both actions of a buffer.
Figure 10.3 The Action of Buffers Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 510  Buffers can react with both strong acids (top) and strong bases (bottom) to minimize large changes in pH.
Buffers made from weak bases and salts of weak bases act similarly.
For example, in a buffer containing NH and NH Cl, ammonia molecules can react with any excess 3 4 hydrogen ions introduced by strong acids: NH (aq) + H+(aq) → NH +(aq) 3 4 while the ammonium ion [NH +(aq)] can react with any hydroxide ions introduced by 4 strong bases: NH +(aq) + OH−(aq) → NH (aq) + H O(ℓ) 4 3 2 EXAMPLE 7 Which solute combinations can make a buffer solution?
Assume all are aqueous solutions.
1.
HCHO and NaCHO 2 2 2.
HCl and NaCl 3.
CH NH and CH NH Cl 3 2 3 3 4.
NH and NaOH 3 Solution 1.
Formic acid (HCHO ) is a weak acid, while NaCHO is the salt made from the anion of 2 2 the weak acid—the formate ion (CHO −).
The combination of these two solutes would 2 make a buffer solution.
2.
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, not a weak acid, so the combination of these two solutes would not make a buffer solution.
3.
Methylamine (CH NH ) is like ammonia with one of its hydrogen atoms substituted 3 2 with a CH (methyl) group.
Because it is not on our list of strong bases, we can assume 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 511  that it is a weak base.
The compound CH NH Cl is a salt made from that weak base, so 3 3 the combination of these two solutes would make a buffer solution.
4.
Ammonia (NH ) is a weak base, but NaOH is a strong base.
The combination of these 3 two solutes would not make a buffer solution.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Which solute combinations can make a buffer solution?
Assume all are aqueous solutions.
1.
NaHCO and NaCl 3 2.
H PO and NaH PO 3 4 2 4 3.
NH and (NH ) PO 3 4 3 4 4.
NaOH and NaCl Buffers work well only for limited amounts of added strong acid or base.
Once either solute is all reacted, the solution is no longer a buffer, and rapid changes in pH may occur.
We say that a buffer has a certain capacity.
Buffers that have more solute dissolved in them to start with have larger capacities, as might be expected.
Human blood has a buffering system to minimize extreme changes in pH.
One buffer in blood is based on the presence of HCO − and H CO [H CO is another way to write 3 2 3 2 3 CO (aq)].
With this buffer present, even if some stomach acid were to find its way 2 directly into the bloodstream, the change in the pH of blood would be minimal.
Inside many of the body’s cells, there is a buffering system based on phosphate ions.
Career Focus: Blood Bank Technology Specialist At this point in this text, you should have the idea that the chemistry of blood is fairly complex.
Because of this, people who work with blood must be specially trained to work with it properly.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 512  A blood bank technology specialist is trained to perform routine and special tests on blood samples from blood banks or transfusion centers.
This specialist measures the pH of blood, types it (according to the blood’s ABO+/− type, Rh factors, and other typing schemes), tests it for the presence or absence of various diseases, and uses the blood to determine if a patient has any of several medical problems, such as anemia.
A blood bank technology specialist may also interview and prepare donors to give blood and may actually collect the blood donation.
Blood bank technology specialists are well trained.
Typically, they require a college degree with at least a year of special training in blood biology and chemistry.
In the United States, training must conform to standards established by the American Association of Blood Banks.

The earliest chemical definition of an acid, the Arrhenius definition, says that an acid is a compound that increases the amount of hydrogen ion (H+) in aqueous solution.
An Arrhenius base is a compound that increases the amount of hydroxide ion (OH−) in aqueous solution.
While most bases are named as ionic hydroxide compounds, aqueous acids have a naming system unique to acids.
Acids and bases react together in a characteristic chemical reaction called neutralization, in which the products are water and a salt.
The principles of stoichiometry, along with the balanced chemical equation for a reaction between an acid and a base, can be used to determine how much of one compound will react with a given amount of the other.
A Brønsted-Lowry acid is any substance that donates a proton to another substance.
A Brønsted-Lowry base is any substance that accepts a proton from another substance.
The reaction of ammonia with water to make ammonium ions and hydroxide ions can be used to illustrate Brønsted-Lowry acid and base behavior.
Some compounds can either donate or accept protons, depending on the circumstances.
Such compounds are called amphiprotic.
Water is one example of an amphiprotic compound.
One result of water being amphiprotic is that a water molecule can donate a proton to another water molecule to make a hydronium ion and a hydroxide ion.
This process is called the autoionization of water and occurs in any sample of water.
Not all acids and bases are equal in chemical strength.
A strong acid is an acid whose molecules are all dissociated into ions in aqueous solution.
Hydrochloric acid is an example of a strong acid.
Similarly, a strong base is a base whose molecules are dissociated into ions in aqueous solution.
Sodium hydroxide is an example of a strong base.
Any acid or base whose molecules are not all dissociated into ions in aqueous solution is a weak acid or a weak base.
Solutions of weak acids and weak bases reach a chemical equilibrium between the un-ionized form of the compound and the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 516  dissociated ions.
It is a dynamic equilibrium because acid and base molecules are constantly dissociating into ions and reassociating into neutral molecules.
The pH scale is a scale used to express the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution.
A neutral solution, neither acidic nor basic, has a pH of 7.
Acidic solutions have a pH lower than 7, while basic solutions have a pH higher than 7.
Buffers are solutions that resist dramatic changes in pH when an acid or a base is added to them.
They contain a weak acid and a salt of that weak acid, or a weak base and a salt of that weak base.
When a buffer is present, any strong acid reacts with the anion of the salt, forming a weak acid and minimizing the presence of hydrogen ions in solution.
Any strong base reacts with the weak acid, minimizing the amount of additional hydroxide ions in solution.
However, buffers only have limited capacity; there is a limit to the amount of strong acid or strong base any given amount of buffer will react with.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 519  Chapter 11 Nuclear Chemistry Opening Essay Most of us may not be aware of a device in our homes that guards our safety and, at the same time, depends on radioactivity to operate properly.
This device is a smoke detector.
A typical smoke detector contains an electric circuit that includes two metal plates about 1 cm apart.
A battery in the circuit creates a voltage between the plates.
Next to the plates is a small disk containing a tiny amount (∼0.0002 g) of the radioactive element americium (Am).
The radioactivity of the americium ionizes the air between the plates, causing a tiny current to constantly flow between them.
(This constant drain on the battery explains why the batteries in smoke detectors should be replaced on a regular basis, whether the alarm has been triggered or not.)
When particles of smoke from a fire enter the smoke detector, they interfere with the ions between the metal plates, interrupting the tiny flow of current.
When the current drops beneath a set value, another circuit triggers a loud alarm, warning of the possible presence of fire.
Although radioactive, the americium in a smoke detector is embedded in plastic and is not harmful unless the plastic package is taken apart, which is unlikely.
Although many people experience an unfounded fear of radioactivity, smoke detectors provide an application of radioactivity that saves thousands of lives every year.
Most chemists pay little attention to the nucleus of an atom except to consider the number of protons it contains because that determines an element’s identity.
However, in nuclear chemistry, the composition of the nucleus and the changes that occur there are very important.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 520  Applications of nuclear chemistry may be more widespread than you realize.
Many people are aware of nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs, but nuclear chemistry also has applications ranging from smoke detectors to medicine, from the sterilization of food to the analysis of ancient artifacts.
In this chapter, we will examine some of the basic concepts of nuclear chemistry and some of the nuclear reactions that are important in our everyday lives.
11.1 Radioactivity LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Define and give examples of the major types of radioactivity.
We saw in Chapter 2 "Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table" that atoms are composed of subatomic particles—protons, neutrons, and electrons.
Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus and provide most of the mass of the atom, while electrons circle the nucleus in shells and subshells and account for an atom’s size.
We also introduced in Chapter 2 "Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table" the notation for succinctly representing an isotope of a particular atom: The element in this example, represented by the symbol C, is carbon.
Its atomic number, 6, is the lower left subscript on the symbol and is the number of protons in the atom.
The mass number, the superscript to the upper left of the symbol, is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of this particular isotope.
In this case, the mass number is 12, which means that the number of neutrons in the atom is 12 − 6 = 6 (that is, the mass number of the atom minus the number of protons in the nucleus equals the number of neutrons).
Occasionally, the atomic number is omitted in this Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 521  notation because the symbol of the element itself conveys its characteristic atomic number.
The two isotopes of hydrogen, 2H and 3H, are given their own names: deuterium (D) and tritium (T), respectively.
Another way of expressing a particular isotope is to list the mass number after the element name, like carbon-12 or hydrogen-3.
Atomic theory in the 19th century presumed that nuclei had fixed compositions.
But in 1896, the French scientist Henri Becquerel found that a uranium compound placed near a photographic plate made an image on the plate, even if the compound was wrapped in black cloth.
He reasoned that the uranium compound was emitting some kind of radiation that passed through the cloth to expose the photographic plate.
Further investigations showed that the radiation was a combination of particles and electromagnetic rays, with its ultimate source as the atomic nucleus.
These emanations were ultimately called, collectively, radioactivity.
There are three main forms of radioactive emissions.
The first is called an alpha particle, which is symbolized by the Greek letter α.
An alpha particle is composed of two protons and two neutrons, and so is the same as a helium nucleus.
(We often use to represent an alpha particle.)
It has a 2+ charge.
When a radioactive atom emits an alpha particle, the original atom’s atomic number decreases by two (because of the loss of two protons), and its mass number decreases by four (because of the loss of four nuclear particles).
We can represent the emission of an alpha particle with a chemical equation—for example, the alpha-particle emission of uranium-235 is as follows: How do we know that a product of the reaction is We use the law of conservation of matter, which says that matter cannot be created or destroyed.
This means we must have the same number of protons and neutrons on both sides of the chemical equation.
If our uranium nucleus loses 2 protons, there are 90 protons remaining, identifying the element as thorium.
Moreover, if we lose 4 nuclear particles of the original 235, there are 231 remaining.
Thus, we use subtraction to identify the isotope of the thorium atom—in this case, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 522  Chemists often use the names parent isotope and daughter isotope to represent the original atom and the product other than the alpha particle.
In the previous example, is the parent isotope, and is the daughter isotope.
When one element changes into another in this manner, it undergoes radioactive decay.
EXAMPLE 1 Write the nuclear equation that represents the radioactive decay of radon-222 by alpha particle emission and identify the daughter isotope.
Solution Radon has an atomic number of 86, so the parent isotope is represented as .
We represent the alpha particle as and use subtraction (222 − 4 = 218 and 86 − 2 = 84) to identify the daughter isotope as an isotope of polonium, SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Write the nuclear equation that represents the radioactive decay of polonium-209 by alpha particle emission and identify the daughter isotope.
The second major type of radioactive emission is called a beta particle, symbolized by the Greek letter β.
A beta particle is an electron ejected from the nucleus (not from the shells of electrons about the nucleus) and has a 1− charge.
We can also represent a beta particle as or β−.
The net effect of beta particle emission on a nucleus is that a neutron is converted to a proton.
The overall mass number stays the same, but because Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 523  the number of protons increases by one, the atomic number goes up by one.
Carbon-14 decays by emitting a beta particle: Again, the sum of the atomic numbers is the same on both sides of the equation, as is the sum of the mass numbers.
(Note that the electron is assigned an “atomic number” of 1−, equal to its charge.)
The third major type of radioactive emission is not a particle but rather a very energetic form of electromagnetic radiation called gamma rays, symbolized by the Greek letter γ. Gamma rays themselves do not carry an overall electrical charge, but they may knock electrons out of atoms in a sample of matter and make it electrically charged (for which gamma rays are termed ionizing radiation).
For example, in the radioactive decay of radon-222, both alpha and gamma radiation are emitted, with the latter having an energy of 8.2 × 10−14 J per nucleus decayed: This may not seem like much energy, but if 1 mol of radon atoms were to decay, the gamma ray energy would be 49 million kJ!
EXAMPLE 2 Write the nuclear equation that represents the radioactive decay of boron-12 by beta particle emission and identify the daughter isotope.
A gamma ray is emitted simultaneously with the beta particle.
Solution The parent isotope is , while one of the products is an electron, .
So that the mass and atomic numbers have the same value on both sides, the mass number of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 524  daughter isotope must be 12, and its atomic number must be 6.
The element having an atomic number of 6 is carbon.
Thus, the complete nuclear equation is as follows: The daughter isotope is SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Write the nuclear equation that represents the radioactive decay of iodine-131 by beta particle emission and identify the daughter isotope.
A gamma ray is emitted simultaneously with the beta particle.
Alpha, beta, and gamma emissions have different abilities to penetrate matter.
The relatively large alpha particle is easily stopped by matter (although it may impart a significant amount of energy to the matter it contacts).
Beta particles penetrate slightly into matter, perhaps a few centimeters at most.
Gamma rays can penetrate deeply into matter and can impart a large amount of energy into the surrounding matter.
Table 11.1 "The Three Main Forms of Radioactive Emissions" summarizes the properties of the three main types of radioactive emissions.
Table 11.1 The Three Main Forms of Radioactive Emissions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 525  Occasionally, an atomic nucleus breaks apart into smaller pieces in a radioactive process called spontaneous fission (or fission).
Typically, the daughter isotopes produced by fission are a varied mix of products, rather than a specific isotope as with alpha and beta particle emission.
Often, fission produces excess neutrons that will sometimes be captured by other nuclei, possibly inducing additional radioactive events.
Uranium-235 undergoes spontaneous fission to a small extent.
One typical reaction is where n01 is a neutron.
As with any nuclear process, the sums of the atomic numbers and the mass numbers must be the same on both sides of the equation.
Spontaneous fission is found only in large nuclei.
The smallest nucleus that exhibits spontaneous fission is lead-208.
Note Fission is the radioactive process used in nuclear power plants and one type of nuclear bomb.

11.2 Half-Life LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Define half-life.
2.
Determine the amount of radioactive substance remaining after a given number of half- lives.
Whether or not a given isotope is radioactive is a characteristic of that particular isotope.
Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and decay through a characteristic form of emission.
As time passes, less and less of the radioactive isotope will be present, and the level of radioactivity decreases.
An interesting and useful aspect of radioactive decay is half-life.
The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 530  amount of time it takes for one-half of the radioactive isotope to decay.
The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant; it is unaffected by conditions and is independent of the initial amount of that isotope.
Consider the following example.
Suppose we have 100.0 g of 3H (tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen).
It has a half-life of 12.3 y.
After 12.3 y, half of the sample will have decayed to 3He by emitting a beta particle, so that only 50.0 g of the original 3H remains.
After another 12.3 y—making a total of 24.6 y—another half of the remaining3H will have decayed, leaving 25.0 g of 3H.
After another 12.3 y—now a total of 36.9 y—another half of the remaining 3H will have decayed, leaving 12.5 g of 3H.
This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 11.1 "Radioactive Decay".
Figure 11.1 Radioactive Decay During each successive half-life, half of the initial amount will radioactively decay.
We can determine the amount of a radioactive isotope remaining after a given number half-lives by using the following expression: where n is the number of half-lives.
This expression works even if the number of half- lives is not a whole number.
EXAMPLE 3 The half-life of 20F is 11.0 s. If a sample initially contains 5.00 g of 20F, how much 20F remains after 44.0 s?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 531  Solution If we compare the time that has passed to the isotope’s half-life, we note that 44.0 s is exactly 4 half-lives, so using the previous equation, n = 4.
Substituting and solving results in the following: Less than one-third of a gram of 20F remains.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE The half-life of 44Ti is 60.0 y.
A sample initially contains 0.600 g of 44Ti.
How much 44Ti remains after 180.0 y?
Half-lives of isotopes range from fractions of a microsecond to billions of years.
Table 11.2 "Half-Lives of Various Isotopes" lists the half-lives of some isotopes.
Table 11.2 Half-Lives of Various Isotopes Isotope Half-Life 3H 12.3 y 14C 5,730 y 40K 1.26 × 109 y 51Cr 27.70 d Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 532  Isotope Half-Life 90Sr 29.1 y 131I 8.04 d 222Rn 3.823 d 235U 7.04 × 108 y 238U 4.47 × 109 y 241Am 432.7 y 248Bk 23.7 h 260Sg 4 ms Looking Closer: Half-Lives of Radioactive Elements Many people think that the half-life of a radioactive element represents the amount of time an element is radioactive.
In fact, it is the time required for half—not all—of the element to decay radioactively.
Occasionally, however, the daughter element is also radioactive, so its radioactivity must also be considered.
The expected working life of an ionization-type smoke detector (described in the opening essay) is about 10 years.
In that time, americium-241, which has a half-life of about 432 y, loses less than 4% of its radioactivity.
A half-life of 432 y may seem long to us, but it is not very long as half-lives go.
Uranium-238, the most common isotope of uranium, has a half-life of about 4.5 × 109 y, while thorium-232 has a half-life of 14 × 109 y.
On the other hand, some nuclei have extremely short half-lives, presenting challenges to the scientists who study them.
The longest-lived isotope of lawrencium, 262Lr, has a half- Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 533  life of 3.6 h, while the shortest-lived isotope of lawrencium, 252Lr, has a half-life of 0.36 s. As of this writing, the largest atom ever detected has atomic number 118, mass number 293, and a half-life of 120 ns.
Can you imagine how quickly an experiment must be done to determine the properties of elements that exist for so short a time?

25 y 11.3 Units of Radioactivity LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Express amounts of radioactivity in a variety of units.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 535  In Section 11.2 "Half-Life", we used mass to indicate the amount of radioactive substance present.
This is only one of several units used to express amounts of radiation.
Some units describe the number of radioactive events occurring per unit time, while others express the amount of a person’s exposure to radiation.
Perhaps the direct way of reporting radioactivity is the number of radioactive decays per second.
One decay per second is called one becquerel (Bq).
Even in a small mass of radioactive material, however, there are many thousands of decays or disintegrations per second.
The unit curie (Ci), now defined as 3.7 × 1010 decays per second, was originally defined as the number of decays per second in 1 g of radium.
Many radioactive samples have activities that are on the order of microcuries (µCi) or more.
Both the becquerel and curie can be used in place of grams to describe quantities of radioactive material.
As an example, the amount of americium in an average smoke detector has an activity of 0.9 µCi.
Note The unit becquerel is named after Henri Becquerel, who discovered radioactivity in 1896.
The unit curie is named after Polish scientist Marie Curie, who performed some of the initial investigations into radioactive phenomena in the early 1900s.
EXAMPLE 4 A sample of radium has an activity of 16.0 mCi (millicuries).
If the half-life of radium is 1,600 y, how long before the sample’s activity is 1.0 mCi?
Solution The following table shows the activity of the radium sample over multiple half-lives: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 536  Over a period of 4 half-lives, the activity of the radium will be halved four times, at which point its activity will be 1.0 mCi.
Thus, it takes 4 half-lives, or 4 × 1,600 y = 6,400 y, for the activity to decrease to 1.0 mCi.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE A sample of radon has an activity of 60,000 Bq.
If the half-life of radon is 15 h, how long before the sample’s activity is 3,750 Bq?
Other measures of radioactivity are based on the effects it has on living tissue.
Radioactivity can transfer energy to tissues in two ways: through the kinetic energy of the particles hitting the tissue and through the electromagnetic energy of the gamma rays being absorbed by the tissue.
Either way, the transferred energy—like thermal energy from boiling water—can damage the tissue.
The rad (an acronym for radiation absorbed dose) is a unit equivalent to a gram of tissue absorbing 0.01 J: 1 rad = 0.01 J/g Another unit of radiation absorption is the gray (Gy): 1 Gy = 100 rad The rad is more common.
To get an idea of the amount of energy this represents, consider that the absorption of 1 rad by 70,000 g of H O (approximately the same mass 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 537  as a 150 lb person) would increase its temperature by only 0.002°C.
This may not seem like a lot, but it is enough energy to break about 1 × 1021 molecular C–C bonds in a person’s body.
That amount of damage would not be desirable.
Predicting the effects of radiation is complicated by the fact that various tissues are affected differently by different types of emissions.
To quantify these effects, the unit rem (an acronym for roentgen equivalent, man) is defined as rem = rad × factor where factor is a number greater than or equal to 1 that takes into account the type of radioactive emission and sometimes the type of tissue being exposed.
For beta particles, the factor equals 1.
For alpha particles striking most tissues, the factor is 10, but for eye tissue, the factor is 30.
Most radioactive emissions that people are exposed to are on the order of a few dozen millirems (mrem) or less; a medical X ray is about 20 mrem.
A sievert (Sv) is a related unit and is defined as 100 rem.
What is a person’s annual exposure to radioactivity and radiation?
Table 11.3 "Average Annual Radiation Exposure (Approximate)" lists the sources and annual amounts of radiation exposure.
It may surprise you to learn that fully 82% of the radioactivity and radiation exposure we receive is from natural sources—sources we cannot avoid.
Fully 10% of the exposure comes from our own bodies—largely from 14C and 40K.
Table 11.3 Average Annual Radiation Exposure (Approximate) Source Amount (mrem) radon gas 200 medical sources 53 radioactive atoms in the body naturally 39 terrestrial sources 28 cosmic sources 28 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 538  Source Amount (mrem) consumer products 10 nuclear energy 0.05 Total 358 Note Flying from New York City to San Francisco adds 5 mrem to your overall radiation exposure because the plane flies above much of the atmosphere, which protects us from most cosmic radiation.
The actual effects of radioactivity and radiation exposure on a person’s health depend on the type of radioactivity, the length of exposure, and the tissues exposed.
Table 11.4 "Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Radioactivity and Radiation" lists the potential threats to health at various amounts of exposure over short periods of time (hours or days).
Table 11.4 Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Radioactivity and Radiation Exposure (rem) Effect 1 (over a full year) no detectable effect ∼20 increased risk of some cancers damage to bone marrow and other tissues; possible internal bleeding; decrease ∼100 in white blood cell count 200–300 visible “burns” on skin, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue >300 loss of white blood cells; hair loss ∼600 death Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 539  One of the simplest ways of detecting radioactivity is by using a piece of photographic film embedded in a badge or a pen.
On a regular basis, the film is developed and checked for exposure.
A comparison of the exposure level of the film with a set of standard exposures indicates the amount of radiation a person was exposed to.
Another means of detecting radioactivity is an electrical device called a Geiger counter.
It contains a gas-filled chamber with a thin membrane on one end that allows radiation emitted from radioactive nuclei to enter the chamber and knock electrons off atoms of gas (usually argon).
The presence of electrons and positively charged ions causes a small current, which is detected by the Geiger counter and converted to a signal on a meter or, commonly, an audio circuit to produce an audible “click.” CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISE 1.

11.4 Uses of Radioactive Isotopes LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Learn some applications of radioactivity.
Radioactive isotopes have a variety of applications.
Generally, however, they are useful either because we can detect their radioactivity or we can use the energy they release.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 542  Radioactive isotopes are effective tracers because their radioactivity is easy to detect.
A tracer is a substance that can be used to follow the pathway of that substance through some structure.
For instance, leaks in underground water pipes can be discovered by running some tritium-containing water through the pipes and then using a Geiger counter to locate any radioactive tritium subsequently present in the ground around the pipes.
(Recall that tritium, 3H, is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.)
Tracers can also be used to follow the steps of a complex chemical reaction.
After incorporating radioactive atoms into reactant molecules, scientists can track where the atoms go by following their radioactivity.
One excellent example of this is the use of radioactive carbon-14 to determine the steps involved in the photosynthesis in plants.
We know these steps because researchers followed the progress of the radioactive carbon-14 throughout the process.
Radioactive isotopes are useful for establishing the ages of various objects.
The half-life of radioactive isotopes is unaffected by any environmental factors, so the isotope acts like an internal clock.
For example, if a rock is analyzed and is found to contain a certain amount of uranium-235 and a certain amount of its daughter isotope, we can conclude that a certain fraction of the original uranium-235 has radioactively decayed.
If half of the uranium has decayed, then the rock has an age of one half-life of uranium-235, or about 4.5 × 109 y.
Many analyses like this, using a wide variety of isotopes, have indicated that the age of Earth itself is over 4 × 109 y.
In another interesting example of radioactive dating, 3H dating has been used to verify the stated vintages of some old fine wines.
Carbon-14 (half-life is 5,370 y) is particularly useful in determining the age of once- living artifacts (e.g., animal or plant matter).
A tiny amount of carbon-14 is produced naturally in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, and living things incorporate some of it into their tissues, building up to a constant, although very low, level.
Once a living thing dies, however, it no longer acquires carbon-14, and as time passes, the carbon-14 that was in the tissues decays.
If a once-living artifact is discovered and analyzed many years after its death, with the remaining carbon-14 compared to the known constant Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 543  level, an approximate age of the artifact can be determined.
Using such methods, scientists determined that the age of the Shroud of Turin (made of linen, which comes from the flax plant, and purported by some to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ; Figure 11.3 "Shroud of Figure 11.3 Shroud of Turin") is about 600–700 y, not 2,000 y as claimed by Turin some.
Scientists were also able to use radiocarbon dating to show that the age of a mummified body found in the ice of the Alps was 5,300 y.
The radiation emitted by some radioactive substances can be used to kill microorganisms on a variety of foodstuffs, which extends the shelf life of these products.
Produce such as tomatoes, mushrooms, sprouts, and berries are irradiated with the emissions from cobalt-60 or cesium-137.
This exposure kills a lot of the bacteria that cause spoilage, so the produce stays fresh longer.
Eggs and some meat, such as beef, pork, In 1989, several groups and poultry, can also be irradiated.
Contrary to the of scientists used belief of some people, irradiation of food does carbon-14 dating to not make the food itself radioactive.

significant concentration of iodine.
To evaluate thyroid activity, a measured dose of iodine-131 is administered to a patient, and the next day a scanner is used to measure the amount of radioactivity in the thyroid gland.
The amount of radioactive iodine that collects there is directly Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 544  related to the activity of the thyroid, allowing trained physicians to diagnose both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.
Iodine-131 has a half-life of only 8 d, so the potential for damage due to exposure is minimal.
Technetium-99 can also be used to test thyroid function.
Bones, the heart, the brain, the liver, the lungs, and many other organs can be imaged in similar ways by using the appropriate radioactive isotope.
Figure 11.4 Medical Diagnostics Radioactive iodine can be used to image the thyroid gland for diagnostic purposes.

Very little radioactive material is needed in these diagnostic techniques because the radiation emitted is so easy to detect.
However, therapeutic applications usually require much larger doses because their purpose is to preferentially kill diseased tissues.
For example, if a thyroid tumor is detected, a much larger infusion (thousands of rem, as opposed to a diagnostic dose of less then 40 rem) of iodine-131 could help destroy the tumor cells.
Similarly, radioactive strontium is used to not only detect but also ease the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 545  pain of bone cancers.

Cobalt-60 is a useful isotope for this kind of procedure.
To Your Health: Positron Emission Tomography Scans One relatively rare form of radioactivity is called positron emission.
It is similar to beta particle emission, except that instead of emitting an electron, a nucleus emits a positively charged electron, called a positron.
A positron is actually a piece of antimatter; therefore, when a positron encounters an electron, both particles are converted into high-energy gamma radiation.
Isotopes that emit positrons can be employed in a medical imaging technique called positron emission tomography (PET).
A patient receives a compound containing a positron-emitting isotope, either intravenously or by ingestion.
The radioactive compound travels throughout the body, and the patient is then pushed slowly through a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 546  ring of sensors that detect the gamma radiation given off by the annihilation of positrons and electrons.
A computer connected to the sensors constructs a three- dimensional image of the interior of part or all of the patient’s body, allowing doctors to see organs or tumors or regulate the function of various organs (such as the brain or the heart) to diagnose the medical condition of the patient.
Two isotopes that undergo positron emission are carbon-11 and fluorine-18, with half- lives of 20.4 and 110 min, respectively.
Both isotopes can be incorporated into sugar molecules and introduced into the body.
Doctors can use the intensity of gamma ray emission to find tissues that metabolize the sugar faster than other tissues; fast- metabolizing tissue is one sign of a malignant (i.e., cancerous) tumor.
Researchers use similar techniques to map areas of the brain that are most active during specific tasks, such as reading or speaking.
PET is one of many diagnostic and treatment methods that physicians use to improve the quality of our lives.
It is one of the many positive uses of radioactivity in society.

Explain where nuclear energy comes from.
2.
Describe the difference between fission and fusion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 549  Nuclear changes occur with a simultaneous release of energy.
Where does this energy come from?
If we could precisely measure the masses of the reactants and the products of a nuclear reaction, we would notice that the amount of mass drops slightly in the conversion from reactants to products.
Consider the following nuclear reaction, in which the molar mass of each species is indicated to four decimal places: If we compare the mass of the reactant (235.0439) to the masses of the products (sum = 234.8605), we notice a mass difference of −0.1834 g, or −0.0001834 kg.
Where did this mass go?
According to Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, energy (E) and mass (m) are related by the following equation: E = mc2 where c is the speed of light, or 3.00 × 108 m/s.
In the course of the uranium nuclear chemical reaction, the mass difference is converted to energy, which is given off by the reaction: E = (−0.0001834 kg)(3.00 × 108 m/s)2 = −1.65 × 1013 J = −1.65 × 1010 kJ That is, 16.5 billion kJ of energy are given off every time 1 mol of uranium-235 undergoes this nuclear reaction.
This is an extraordinary amount of energy.
Compare it to combustion reactions of hydrocarbons, which give off about 650 kJ/mol of energy for every CH unit in the hydrocarbon—on the order of hundreds of kilojoules per mole.
2 Nuclear reactions give off billions of kilojoules per mole.
If this energy could be properly harvested, it would be a significant source of energy for our society.
Nuclear energy involves the controlled harvesting of energy from fission reactions.
The reaction can be controlled because the fission of uranium-235 (and a few other isotopes, such as plutonium-239) can be artificially initiated by injecting a neutron into a uranium nucleus.
The overall nuclear equation, with energy included as a product, is then as follows: 235U + 1n → 139Ba + 94Kr + 31n + energy Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 550  Thus, by the careful addition of extra neutrons into a sample of uranium, we can control the fission process and obtain energy that can be used for other purposes.
Note Artificial or induced radioactivity was first demonstrated in 1934 by Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot, the daughter and son-in-law of Marie Curie.
EXAMPLE 5 Plutonium-239 can absorb a neutron and undergo a fission reaction to produce an atom of gold-204 and an atom of phosphorus-31.
Write the balanced nuclear equation for the process and determine the number of neutrons given off as part of the reaction.
Solution Using the data given, we can write the following initial equation: In balanced nuclear equations, the sums of the subscripts on each sides of the equation are the same, as are the sums of the superscripts.
The subscripts are already balanced: 0 + 94 = 94 and 79 + 15 = 94.
The superscripts on the left equal 240 (1 + 239) but equal 235 (204 + 31) on the right.
We need five more mass number units on the right.
Five neutrons should be the products of the process for the mass numbers to balance.
(Because the atomic number of a neutron is zero, including five neutrons on the right does not change the overall sum of the subscripts.)
Thus, the balanced nuclear equation is as follows: We predict that the overall process will give off five neutrons.

Uranium-238 can absorb a neutron and undergo a fission reaction to produce an atom of cesium-135 and an atom of rubidium-96.
Write the balanced nuclear equation for the process and determine the number of neutrons given off as part of the reaction.
A nuclear reactor is an apparatus designed to carefully control the progress of a nuclear reaction and extract the resulting energy for useful purposes.
Figure 11.5 "A Diagram of a Nuclear Power Plant for Generating Electricity" shows a simplified diagram of a nuclear reactor.
The energy from the controlled nuclear reaction converts liquid water into high-pressure steam, which is used to run turbines that generate electricity.
Figure 11.5 A Diagram of a Nuclear Power Plant for Generating Electricity Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 552  The two main components of the power plant are the nuclear reactor itself and the steam-driven turbine and electricity generator.
Notice that the fission of uranium produces two more free neutrons than were present to begin with.
These neutrons can themselves stimulate other uranium nuclei to undergo fission, releasing yet more energy and even more neutrons, which can in turn induce even more uranium fission.
A single neutron can thus begin a process that grows exponentially in a phenomenon called a chain reaction: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 → 1,024 → 2,048 → 4,096 → 8,192 → 16,384 →… Because energy is produced with each fission event, energy is also produced exponentially and in an uncontrolled fashion.
The quick production of energy creates an explosion.
This is the mechanism behind the atomic bomb.
Note The first controlled chain reaction was achieved on December 2, 1942, in an experiment supervised by Enrico Fermi in a laboratory underneath the football stadium at the University of Chicago.
Although fairly simple in theory, an atomic bomb is difficult to produce, in part because uranium-235, the isotope that undergoes fission, makes up only 0.7% of natural uranium; the rest is mostly uranium-238, which does not undergo fission.
(Remember that the radioactive process that a nucleus undergoes is characteristic of the isotope.)
To make uranium useful for nuclear reactors, the uranium in uranium-235 must be enriched to about 3%.
Enrichment of uranium is a laborious and costly series of physical and chemical separations.
To be useful in an atomic bomb, the uranium in uranium-235 must be enriched to 70% or more.
At lesser concentrations, the chain reaction cannot sustain itself, so no explosion is produced.
Fusion is another nuclear process that can be used to produce energy.
In this process, smaller nuclei are combined to make larger nuclei, with an accompanying release of energy.
One example is the hydrogen fusion, which makes helium.
While the steps of the process are complicated, the net reaction is: 41H → 4He + 2.58 × 1012 J Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 553  Notice that the amount of energy given off per mole of reactant is only a fraction of the amount given off by the fission of 1 mol of uranium-235.
On a mass (per gram) basis, however, the hydrogen fusion emits many times more energy than fission does.
In addition, the product of fission is helium gas, not a wide range of isotopes (some of which are also radioactive) produced by fission.
The practical problem is that to perform fusion, extremely high pressures and temperatures are necessary.
Currently, the only known stable systems undergoing fusion are the interiors of stars.
The conditions necessary for fusion can be created using an atomic bomb, but the resulting fusion is uncontrollable (and the basis for another type of bomb, a hydrogen bomb).
Currently, researchers are looking for safe, controlled ways of producing useful energy using fusion.
Career Focus: Nuclear Medicine Technologist Generally speaking, a radiological technician deals with X ray equipment and procedures.
A nuclear medicine technologist has similar responsibilities, using compounds containing radioactive isotopes to help diagnose and treat disease.
Nuclear medicine technologists administer the substances containing the radioactive isotope and subsequently operate the apparatus that detects the radiation produced by radioactive decay.
The apparatus may be as simple as a piece of photographic film or as complex as a series of computer-controlled electronic detectors.
The images obtained by the technologist are interpreted by a specially trained physician.
One of the chief responsibilities of a nuclear medicine technologist is safety.
Improper exposure to radioactivity can be harmful to both patient and technologist alike.
Therefore, the technologist must adhere to strict safety standards to keep unnecessary exposure as low as possible.
The technologist must also know how to dispose of waste materials safely and appropriately.

11.6 End-of-Chapter Material Chapter Summary To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that emit particles and high-energy electromagnetic radiation to form new elements that are more stable.
This emission of particles and electromagnetic radiation is called radioactivity.
There are three main types of spontaneous radioactive emission: alpha particles, which are equivalent to helium nuclei; beta particles, which are electrons; and gamma radiation, which is high- energy electromagnetic radiation.
Another type of radioactive process is spontaneous fission, in which large nuclei spontaneously break apart into smaller nuclei and, often, neutrons.
In all forms of radioactivity, new elements are formed from the radioactive reactants.
Radioactive isotopes decay at different rates.
The rate of an isotope’s decay is expressed as a half-life, which is the amount of time required for half of the original material to decay.
The length of its half-life is a characteristic of the particular isotope and can range from less than microseconds to billions of years.
Amounts of radioactivity are measured in several different ways.
A becquerel is equal to one radioactive decay per second.
A curie represents 3.7 × 1010 decays per second.
Other units describe the amount of energy absorbed by body tissues.
One rad is equivalent to 0.01 joule of energy absorbed per gram of tissue.
Different tissues react differently to different types of radioactivity.
The rem unit takes into account not only the energy absorbed by the tissues, but also includes a numerical multiplication factor to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 557  account for the type of radioactivity and the type of tissue.
The average annual radiation exposure of a person is less than 360 millirem, over 80% of which is from natural sources.
Radioactivity can be detected using photographic film or other devices such as Geiger counters.
Radioactive isotopes have many useful applications.
They can be used as tracersto follow the journey of a substance through a system, like an underground waterway or a metabolic pathway.
Radioactive isotopes can be used to date objects, since the amount of parent and daughter isotopes can sometimes be measured very accurately.
Radioactive emission can be used to sterilize food for a longer edible lifetime.
There are also a number of diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications for radioactive isotopes.
Radioactive processes occur with simultaneous changes in energy.
This nuclear energy can be used to generate power for human use.
Nuclear reactors use the energy released by fission of large isotopes to generate electricity.
When carefully controlled, fission can produce a chain reaction that facilitates the continuous production of energy.
If not carefully controlled, a very quick production of energy can result, as in an atomic bomb.
Natural uranium does not contain enough of the proper isotope of uranium to work in a nuclear reactor, so it must first beenriched in uranium-235.
Forcing small nuclei together to make larger nuclei, a process called fusion, also gives off energy; however, scientists have yet to achieve a controlled fusion process.

These effects depend on the size of the hydrocarbon molecules and where on or in the body they are applied.
Alkanes of low molar mass—those with from 1 to approximately 10 or so carbon atoms—are gases or light liquids that act as anesthetics.
Inhaling (“sniffing”) these hydrocarbons in gasoline or aerosol propellants for their intoxicating effect is a major health problem that can lead to liver, kidney, or brain damage or to immediate death by asphyxiation by excluding oxygen.
Swallowed, liquid alkanes do little harm while in the stomach.
In the lungs, however, they cause “chemical” pneumonia by dissolving fatlike molecules from cell membranes in the tiny air sacs (alveoli).
The lungs become unable to expel fluids, just as in pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses.
People who swallow gasoline or other liquid alkane mixtures should not be made to vomit, as this would increase the chance of getting alkanes into the lungs.
(There is no home-treatment antidote for gasoline poisoning; call a poison control center.)
Liquid alkanes with approximately 5–16 carbon atoms per molecule wash away natural skin oils and cause drying and chapping of the skin, while heavier liquid alkanes (those with approximately 17 or more carbon atoms per molecule) act as emollients (skin softeners).
Such alkane mixtures as mineral oil and petroleum jelly can be applied as a protective film.
Water and aqueous solutions such as urine will not dissolve such a film, which explains why petroleum jelly protects a baby’s tender skin from diaper rash.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 561  We begin our study of organic chemistry with the alkanes, compounds containing only two elements, carbon and hydrogen, and having only single bonds.
There are several other kinds of hydrocarbons, distinguished by the types of bonding between carbon atoms and by the properties that result from that bonding.
In Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons" we will examine hydrocarbons with double bonds, with triple bonds, and with a special kind of bonding called aromaticity.
Then in Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen" we will study some compounds considered to be derived from hydrocarbons by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms with an oxygen- containing group.
Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives" focuses on organic acids and bases, after which we will be ready to look at the chemistry of life itself—biochemistry—in the remaining five chapters.
12.1 Organic Chemistry LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Recognize the composition and properties typical of organic and inorganic compounds.
Scientists of the 18th and early 19th centuries studied compounds obtained from plants and animals and labeled them organic because they were isolated from “organized” (living) systems.
Compounds isolated from nonliving systems, such as rocks and ores, the atmosphere, and the oceans, were labeled inorganic.
For many years, scientists thought organic compounds could be made by only living organisms because they possessed a vital force found only in living systems.
The vital force theory began to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 562  decline in 1828, when the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea from inorganic starting materials.
He reacted silver cyanate (AgOCN) and ammonium chloride (NH Cl), expecting to get ammonium cyanate (NH OCN).
What he expected is 4 4 described by the following equation.
AgOCN + NH Cl → AgCl + NH OCN 4 4 Instead, he found the product to be urea (NH CONH ), a well-known organic material 2 2 readily isolated from urine.
This result led to a series of experiments in which a wide variety of organic compounds were made from inorganic starting materials.
The vital force theory gradually went away as chemists learned that they could make many organic compounds in the laboratory.
Today organic chemistry is the study of the chemistry of the carbon compounds, and inorganic chemistry is the study of the chemistry of all other elements.
It may seem strange that we divide chemistry into two branches—one that considers compounds of only one element and one that covers the 100-plus remaining elements.
However, this division seems more reasonable when we consider that of tens of millions of compounds that have been characterized, the overwhelming majority are carbon compounds.
Note The word organic has different meanings.
Organic fertilizer, such as cow manure, is organic in the original sense; it is derived from living organisms.
Organic foods generally are foods grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers.
Organic chemistry is the chemistry of compounds of carbon.
Carbon is unique among the other elements in that its atoms can form stable covalent bonds with each other and with atoms of other elements in a multitude of variations.
The resulting molecules can contain from one to millions of carbon atoms.
In Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons" through Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", we survey organic chemistry by dividing its compounds into families based on functional groups.
(For general information about organic functional groups, see Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", Section 4.6 "Introduction to Organic Chemistry".)
We Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 563  begin with the simplest members of a family and then move on to molecules that are organic in the original sense—that is, they are made by and found in living organisms.
These complex molecules (all containing carbon) determine the forms and functions of living systems and are the subject of biochemistry, a topic presented in Chapter 16 "Carbohydrates" through Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism".
Organic compounds, like inorganic compounds, obey all the natural laws.
Often there is no clear distinction in the chemical or physical properties among organic and inorganic molecules.
Nevertheless, it is useful to compare typical members of each class, as in Table 12.1 "General Contrasting Properties and Examples of Organic and Inorganic Compounds".
(Keep in mind, however, that there are exceptions to every category in this table.)
To further illustrate typical differences among organic and inorganic compounds, Table 12.1 "General Contrasting Properties and Examples of Organic and Inorganic Compounds" also lists properties of the inorganic compound sodium chloride (common table salt, NaCl) and the organic compound hexane (C H ), a solvent that is 6 14 used to extract soybean oil from soybeans (among other uses).
Many compounds can be classified as organic or inorganic by the presence or absence of certain typical properties, as illustrated in Table 12.1 "General Contrasting Properties and Examples of Organic and Inorganic Compounds".

Identify and name simple (straight-chain) alkanes given formulas and write formulas for straight-chain alkanes given their names.
We began our study of organic chemistry in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds" with the hydrocarbons, the simplest organic compounds, which are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms only.
As we noted, there are several different kinds of hydrocarbons.
They are distinguished by the types of bonding between Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 567  carbon atoms and the properties that result from that bonding.
Hydrocarbons with only carbon-to-carbon single bonds (C–C) and existing as a continuous chain of carbon atoms also bonded to hydrogen atoms are called alkanes (or saturated hydrocarbons).
Saturated, in this case, means that each carbon atom is bonded to four other atoms (hydrogen or carbon)—the most possible; there are no double or triple bonds in the molecules.
Note The word saturated has the same meaning for hydrocarbons as it does for the dietary fats and oils: the molecule has no carbon-to-carbon double bonds (C=C).
(For more information about fats and oils, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.1 "Fatty Acids" and Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils".)
We introduced the three simplest alkanes—methane (CH ), ethane (C H ), and propane 4 2 6 (C H )—in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds",Section 4.6 3 8 "Introduction to Organic Chemistry".
They are shown again in Figure 12.1 "The Three Simplest Alkanes".
The flat representations shown do not accurately portray bond angles or molecular geometry.
Methane has a tetrahedral shape that chemists often portray with wedges indicating bonds coming out toward you and dashed lines indicating bonds that go back away from you.
(For more information about the shape of molecules, see Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", Section 4.5 "Characteristics of Molecules".)
An ordinary solid line indicates a bond in the plane of the page.
Figure 12.1 The Three Simplest Alkanes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 568  Recall from Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", Section 4.5 "Characteristics of Molecules" that the VSEPR theory correctly predicts a tetrahedral shape for the methane molecule (Figure 12.2 "The Tetrahedral Methane Molecule").
Figure 12.2 The Tetrahedral Methane Molecule Methane (CH ), ethane (C H ), and propane (C H ) are the beginning of a series of 4 2 6 3 8 compounds in which any two members in a sequence differ by one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms—namely, a CH unit.
The first 10 members of this series are given 2 in Table 12.2 "The First 10 Straight-Chain Alkanes".

The sequence starts with C H , and a CH unit is added in each step moving up the series.
Any family 3 8 2 of compounds in which adjacent members differ from each other by a definite factor (here a CH group) is called a homologous series.
The members of such a series, 2 called homologs, have properties that vary in a regular and predictable manner.
The principle of homology gives organization to organic chemistry in much the same way that the periodic table gives organization to inorganic chemistry.
Instead of a bewildering array of individual carbon compounds, we can study a few members of a homologous series and from them deduce some of the properties of other compounds in the series.
Figure 12.3 Members of a Homologous Series Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 570  Each succeeding formula incorporates one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms more than the previous formula.
The principle of homology allows us to write a general formula for alkanes: C H .
n 2n+ 2 Using this formula, we can write a molecular formula for any alkane with a given number of carbon atoms.
For example, an alkane with eight carbon atoms has the molecular formula C H = C H .

What compounds contain five to eight carbon atoms and are homologs of C H ?
4 10 ANSWER 1.
CH and C H 4 2 6 12.3 Branched-Chain Alkanes LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Learn how alkane molecules can have branched chains and recognize compounds that are isomers.
We can write the structure of butane (C H ) by stringing four carbon atoms in a row, 4 10 –C–C–C–C– and then adding enough hydrogen atoms to give each carbon atom four bonds: The compound butane has this structure, but there is another way to put 4 carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen atoms together.
Place 3 of the carbon atoms in a row and then branch the fourth one off the middle carbon atom: Now we add enough hydrogen atoms to give each carbon four bonds.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 572  There is a hydrocarbon that corresponds to this structure, which means that two different compounds have the same molecular formula: C H .
The two compounds have 4 10 different properties—for example, one boils at −0.5°C; the other at −11.7°C.
Different compounds having the same molecular formula are called isomers.
The compound with this branched chain is called isobutane (Figure 12.4 "Butane and Isobutane").
Figure 12.4 Butane and Isobutane The ball-and-stick models of these two compounds show them to be isomers; both have the molecular formula C H .
4 10 Notice that C H is depicted with a bent chain in Figure 12.4 "Butane and Isobutane".
4 10 The four-carbon chain may be bent in various ways because the groups can rotate freely about the C–C bonds.
However, this rotation does not change the identity of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 573  compound.
It is important to realize that bending a chain does not change the identity of the compound; all of the following represent the same compound: The formula of isobutane shows a continuous chain of three carbon atoms only, with the fourth attached as a branch off the middle carbon atom of the continuous chain.
Unlike C H , the compounds methane (CH ), ethane (C H ), and propane (C H ) do 4 10 4 2 6 3 8 not exist in isomeric forms because there is only one way to arrange the atoms in each formula so that each carbon atom has four bonds.
Next beyond C H in the homologous series is pentane.
Each compound has the same 4 10 molecular formula: C H .
(Table 12.2 "The First 10 Straight-Chain Alkanes"has a 5 12 column identifying the number of possible isomers for the first 10 straight-chain alkanes.)
The compound at the far left is pentane because it has all five carbon atoms in a continuous chain.
The compound in the middle is isopentane; like isobutane, it has a one CH branch off the second carbon atom of the continuous chain.
The compound at 3 the far right, discovered after the other two, was named neopentane (from the Greek neos, meaning “new”).
Although all three have the same molecular formula, they have different properties, including boiling points: pentane, 36.1°C; isopentane, 27.7°C; and neopentane, 9.5°C.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 574  Note A continuous (unbranched) chain of carbon atoms is often called a straight chaineven though the tetrahedral arrangement about each carbon gives it a zigzag shape.
Straight- chain alkanes are sometimes called normal alkanes, and their names are given the prefix n-.
For example, butane is called n-butane.
We will not use that prefix here because it is not a part of the system established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.

Write condensed structural formulas for alkanes given complete structural formulas.
2.
Draw line-angle formulas given structural formulas.
We use several kinds of formulas to describe organic compounds.
A molecular formula shows only the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule.
For example, the molecular formula C H tells us there are 4 carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen atoms in a molecule, 4 10 but it doesn’t distinguish between butane and isobutane.
A structural formula shows all the carbon and hydrogen atoms and the bonds attaching them.
Thus, structural formulas identify the specific isomers by showing the order of attachment of the various atoms.
Unfortunately, structural formulas are difficult to type/write and take up a lot of space.
Chemists often use condensed structural formulas to alleviate these problems.
The condensed formulas show hydrogen atoms right next to the carbon atoms to which they are attached, as illustrated for butane: The ultimate condensed formula is a line-angle formula, in which carbon atoms are implied at the corners and ends of lines, and each carbon atom is understood to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to give each carbon atom four bonds.
For example, we can represent pentane (CH CH CH CH CH ) and isopentane [(CH ) CHCH CH ] as 3 2 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 578  Note Parentheses in condensed structural formulas indicate that the enclosed grouping of atoms is attached to the adjacent carbon atom.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 580  12.5 IUPAC Nomenclature LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Name alkanes by the IUPAC system and write formulas for alkanes given IUPAC names.
As noted in Table 12.2 "The First 10 Straight-Chain Alkanes", the number of isomers increases rapidly as the number of carbon atoms increases.
There are 3 pentanes, 5 hexanes, 9 heptanes, and 18 octanes.
It would be difficult to assign unique individual names that we could remember.
A systematic way of naming hydrocarbons and other organic compounds has been devised by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
These rules, used worldwide, are known as the IUPAC System of Nomenclature.
(Some of the names we used earlier, such as isobutane, isopentane, and neopentane, do not follow these rules and are calledcommon names.)
A stem name (Table 12.3 "Stems That Indicate the Number of Carbon Atoms in Organic Molecules") indicates the number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain (LCC).
Atoms or groups attached to this carbon chain, calledsubstituents, are then named, with their positions indicated by numbers.
For now, we will consider only those substituents called alkyl groups.
Table 12.3 Stems That Indicate the Number of Carbon Atoms in Organic Molecules Stem Number meth- 1 eth- 2 prop- 3 but- 4 pent- 5 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 581  Stem Number hex- 6 hept- 7 oct- 8 non- 9 dec- 10 An alkyl group is a group of atoms that results when one hydrogen atom is removed from an alkane.
The group is named by replacing the -ane suffix of the parent hydrocarbon with -yl.
For example, the CH group derived from methane (CH ) results 3 4 from subtracting one hydrogen atom and is called a methyl group.
The alkyl groups we will use most frequently are listed in Table 12.4 "Common Alkyl Groups".
Alkyl groups are not independent molecules; they are parts of molecules that we consider as a unit to name compounds systematically.
Table 12.4 Common Alkyl Groups Co nde nse d Str uct ura l For mul Parent Alkane Alkyl Group a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 582  Co nde nse d Str uct ura l For mul Parent Alkane Alkyl Group a methan CH 3 e methyl – CH 3 CH 2 ethane ethyl – CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 propane propyl – (CH isopro ) C 3 2 pyl H– Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 583  Co nde nse d Str uct ura l For mul Parent Alkane Alkyl Group a CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 butane butyl* – *There are four butyl groups, two derived from butane and two from isobutane.
We will introduce the other three where appropriate.
Simplified IUPAC rules for naming alkanes are as follows (demonstrated in Example 12.1).
1.
Name alkanes according to the LCC of carbon atoms in the molecule (rather than the total number of carbon atoms).
This LCC, considered the parent chain, determines the base name, to which we add the suffix -ane to indicate that the molecule is an alkane.
2.
If the hydrocarbon is branched, number the carbon atoms of the LCC.Numbers are assigned in the direction that gives the lowest numbers to the carbon atoms with attached substituents.
Hyphens are used to separate numbers from the names of substituents; commas separate numbers from each other.
(The LCC need not be written in a straight line; for example, the LCC in the following has five carbon atoms.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 584  3.
Place the names of the substituent groups in alphabetical order before the name of the parent compound.
If the same alkyl group appears more than once, the numbers of all the carbon atoms to which it is attached are expressed.
If the same group appears more than once on the same carbon atom, the number of that carbon atom is repeated as many times as the group appears.
Moreover, the number of identical groups is indicated by the Greek prefixes di-, tri-, tetra-, and so on.
These prefixes are not considered in determining the alphabetical order of the substituents.
For example, ethyl is listed before dimethyl; the di- is simply ignored.
The last alkyl group named is prefixed to the name of the parent alkane to form one word.
When these rules are followed, every unique compound receives its own exclusive name.
The rules enable us to not only name a compound from a given structure but also draw a structure from a given name.
The best way to learn how to use the IUPAC system is to put it to work, not just memorize the rules.
It’s easier than it looks.
EXAMPLE 1 Name each compound.
1.
2.
3.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 585  Solution 1.
The LCC has five carbon atoms, and so the parent compound is pentane (rule 1).
There is a methyl group (rule 2) attached to the second carbon atom of the pentane chain.
The name is therefore 2-methylpentane.
2.
The LCC has six carbon atoms, so the parent compound is hexane (rule 1).
Methyl groups (rule 2) are attached to the second and fifth carbon atoms.
The name is 2,5- dimethylhexane.
3.
The LCC has eight carbon atoms, so the parent compound is octane (rule 1).
There are methyl and ethyl groups (rule 2), both attached to the fourth carbon atom (counting from the right gives this carbon atom a lower number; rule 3).
The correct name is thus 4-ethyl-4-methyloctane.

4-ethyl-2-methylheptane Solution In drawing structures, always start with the parent chain.
1.
The parent chain is butane, indicating four carbon atoms in the LCC.
Then add the groups at their proper positions.
You can number the parent chain from either direction as long as you are consistent; just don’t change directions before the structure is done.
The name indicates two methyl (CH ) groups, one on the second 3 carbon atom and one on the third.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 587  Finally, fill in all the hydrogen atoms, keeping in mind that each carbon atom must have four bonds.
2.
The parent chain is heptane in this case, indicating seven carbon atoms in the LCC.
–C–C–C–C–C–C–C– Adding the groups at their proper positions gives Filling in all the hydrogen atoms gives the following condensed structural formulas: Note that the bonds (dashes) can be shown or not; sometimes they are needed for spacing.

Common names are widely used but not very systematic; IUPAC names identify a parent compound and name other groups as substituents.
12.6 Physical Properties of Alkanes LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Identify the physical properties of alkanes and describe trends in these properties.
Because alkanes have relatively predictable physical properties and undergo relatively few chemical reactions other than combustion, they serve as a basis of comparison for the properties of many other organic compound families.
Let’s consider their physical properties first.
Table 12.5 "Physical Properties of Some Alkanes" describes some of the properties of some of the first 10 straight-chain alkanes.
Because alkane molecules are nonpolar, they are insoluble in water, which is a polar solvent, but are soluble in nonpolar and slightly polar solvents.
(For more information about solubility, see Chapter 9 "Solutions", Section 9.2 "Concentration".)
Consequently, alkanes themselves are commonly used as solvents for organic substances of low polarity, such as fats, oils, and waxes.
Nearly all alkanes have densities less than 1.0 g/mL and are therefore less dense Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 593  than water (the density of H O is 1.00 g/mL at 20°C).
These properties explain why oil 2 and grease do not mix with water but rather float on its surface.
Table 12.5 Physical Properties of Some Alkanes Molecular Melting Point Boiling Point Density Physical State Name Formula (°C) (°C) (20°C)* (at 20°C) methane CH –182 –164 0.668 g/L gas 4 ethane C H –183 –89 1.265 g/L gas 2 6 propane C H –190 –42 1.867 g/L gas 3 8 butane C H –138 –1 2.493 g/L gas 4 10 pentane C H –130 36 0.626 g/mL liquid 5 12 hexane C H –95 69 0.659 g/mL liquid 6 14 octane C H –57 125 0.703 g/mL liquid 8 18 decane C H –30 174 0.730 g mL liquid 10 22 *Note the change in units going from gases (grams per liter) to liquids (grams per milliliter).
Gas densities are at 1 atm pressure.
Looking Closer: Gas Densities and Fire Hazards Table 12.5 "Physical Properties of Some Alkanes" indicates that the first four members of the alkane series are gases at ordinary temperatures.
Natural gas is composed chiefly of methane, which has a density of about 0.67 g/L.
The density of air is about 1.29 g/L.
Because natural gas is less dense than air, it rises.
When a natural-gas leak is detected and shut off in a room, the gas can be removed by opening an upper window.
On the other hand, bottled gas can be either propane (density 1.88 g/L) or butanes (a mixture of butane and isobutane; density about 2.5 g/L).
Both are much heavier than air (density 1.2 g/L).
If bottled gas escapes into a building, it collects near the floor.
This presents a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 594  much more serious fire hazard than a natural-gas leak because it is more difficult to rid the room of the heavier gas.
As shown in Table 12.5 "Physical Properties of Some Alkanes", the boiling points of the straight-chain alkanes increase with increasing molar mass.
This general rule holds true for the straight-chain homologs of all organic compound families.
Larger molecules have greater surface areas and consequently interact more strongly; more energy is therefore required to separate them.
For a given molar mass, the boiling points of alkanes are relatively low because these nonpolar molecules have only weak dispersion forces to hold them together in the liquid state.
Looking Closer: An Alkane Basis for Properties of Other Compounds An understanding of the physical properties of the alkanes is important in that petroleum and natural gas and the many products derived from them—gasoline, bottled gas, solvents, plastics, and more—are composed primarily of alkanes.
This understanding is also vital because it is the basis for describing the properties of other organic and biological compound families.
For example, large portions of the structures of lipids consist of nonpolar alkyl groups.
Lipids include the dietary fats and fatlike compounds called phospholipids and sphingolipids that serve as structural components of living tissues.
(For more information about lipids, seeChapter 17 "Lipids".).
These compounds have both polar and nonpolar groups, enabling them to bridge the gap between water-soluble and water-insoluble phases.
This characteristic is essential for the selective permeability of cell membranes.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 595  Tripalmitin (a), a typical fat molecule, has long hydrocarbon chains typical of most lipids.
Compare these chains to hexadecane (b), an alkane with 16 carbon atoms.

Identify the main chemical properties of alkanes.
Alkane molecules are nonpolar and therefore generally do not react with ionic compounds such as most laboratory acids, bases, oxidizing agents, or reducing agents.
Consider butane as an example: Neither positive ions nor negative ions are attracted to a nonpolar molecule.
In fact, the alkanes undergo so few reactions that they are sometimes called paraffins, from the Latin parum affinis, meaning “little affinity.” Two important reactions that the alkanes do undergo are combustion and halogenation.
Nothing happens when alkanes are merely mixed with oxygen (O ) at room 2 temperature, but when a flame or spark provides the activation energy, a highly exothermic combustion reaction proceeds vigorously.
For methane (CH ), the reaction is 4 as follows: CH + 2O → CO + 2H O + heat 4 2 2 2 If the reactants are adequately mixed and there is sufficient oxygen, the only products are carbon dioxide (CO ), water (H O), and heat—heat for cooking foods, heating homes, 2 2 and drying clothes.
Because conditions are rarely ideal, however, other products are frequently formed.
When the oxygen supply is limited, carbon monoxide (CO) is a by- product: 2CH + 3O → 2CO + 4H O 4 2 2 This reaction is responsible for dozens of deaths each year from unventilated or improperly adjusted gas heaters.
(Similar reactions with similar results occur with kerosene heaters.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 598  Alkanes also react with the halogens chlorine (Cl ) and bromine (Br ) in the presence of 2 2 ultraviolet light or at high temperatures to yield chlorinated and brominated alkanes.
For example, chlorine reacts with excess methane (CH ) to give methyl chloride (CH Cl).
4 3 CH + Cl → CH Cl + HCl 4 2 3 With more chlorine, a mixture of products is obtained: CH Cl, CH Cl , CHCl , and CCl .
3 2 2 3 4 Fluorine (F ), the lightest halogen, combines explosively with most hydrocarbons.
2 Iodine (I ) is relatively unreactive.
Fluorinated and iodinated alkanes are produced by 2 indirect methods.
We will discuss the names and uses of halogenated hydrocarbons in Section 12.8 "Halogenated Hydrocarbons".

Name halogenated hydrocarbons given formulas and write formulas for these compounds given names.
Many organic compounds are closely related to the alkanes.
As we noted in Section 12.7 "Chemical Properties of Alkanes", alkanes react with halogens to produce halogenated hydrocarbons, the simplest of which have a single halogen atom substituted for a hydrogen atom of the alkane.
Even more closely related are the cycloalkanes, compounds in which the carbon atoms are joined in a ring, or cyclic fashion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 600  The reactions of alkanes with halogens produce halogenated hydrocarbons, compounds in which one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon have been replaced by halogen atoms: The replacement of only one hydrogen atom gives an alkyl halide (or haloalkane).
The common names of alkyl halides consist of two parts: the name of the alkyl group plus the stem of the name of the halogen, with the ending -ide.
The IUPAC system uses the name of the parent alkane with a prefix indicating the halogen substituents, preceded by number indicating the substituent’s location.
The prefixes are fluoro- ,chloro-, bromo-, and iodo-.
Thus CH CH Cl has the common name ethyl chloride and 3 2 the IUPAC name chloroethane.
Alkyl halides with simple alkyl groups (one to four carbon atoms) are often called by common names.
Those with a larger number of carbon atoms are usually given IUPAC names.
EXAMPLE 3 Give the common and IUPAC names for each compound.
1.
CH CH CH Br 3 2 2 2.
(CH ) CHCl 3 2 Solution 1.
The alkyl group (CH CH CH –) is a propyl group, and the halogen is bromine (Br).
The 3 2 2 common name is therefore propyl bromide.
For the IUPAC name, the prefix for bromine (bromo) is combined with the name for a three-carbon chain (propane), preceded by a number identifying the carbon atom to which the Br atom is attached, so the IUPAC name is 1-bromopropane.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 601  2.
The alkyl group [(CH ) CH–] has three carbon atoms, with a chlorine (Cl) atom 3 2 attached to the middle carbon atom.
The alkyl group is therefore isopropyl, and the common name of the compound is isopropyl chloride.
For the IUPAC name, the Cl atom (prefix chloro-) attached to the middle (second) carbon atom of a propane chain results in 2-chloropropane.

A wide variety of interesting and often useful compounds have one or more halogen atoms per molecule.
For example, methane (CH ) can react with chlorine (Cl ), 4 2 replacing one, two, three, or all four hydrogen atoms with Cl atoms.
Several halogenated products derived from methane and ethane (CH CH ) are listed in Table 12.6 "Some 3 3 Halogenated Hydrocarbons", along with some of their uses.

An example is carbon tetrachloride (CCl ), once used as a dry-cleaning solvent 4 and in fire extinguishers but no longer recommended for either use.
Even in small amounts, its vapor can cause serious illness if exposure is prolonged.
Moreover, it reacts with water at high temperatures to form deadly phosgene (COCl ) gas, which makes the 2 use of CCl in fire extinguishers particularly dangerous.
4 Ethyl chloride, in contrast, is used as an external local anesthetic.
When sprayed on the skin, it evaporates quickly, cooling the area enough to make it insensitive to pain.
It can also be used as an emergency general anesthetic.
Bromine-containing compounds are widely used in fire extinguishers and as fire retardants on clothing and other materials.
Because they too are toxic and have adverse effects on the environment, scientists are engaged in designing safer substitutes for them, as for many other halogenated compounds.
To Your Health: Chlorofluorocarbons and the Ozone Layer Alkanes substituted with both fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) atoms have been used as the dispersing gases in aerosol cans, as foaming agents for plastics, and as refrigerants.
Two Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 605  of the best known of these chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are listed in Table 12.6 "Some Halogenated Hydrocarbons".
Chlorofluorocarbons contribute to the greenhouse effect in the lower atmosphere.
They also diffuse into the stratosphere, where they are broken down by ultraviolet (UV) radiation to release Cl atoms.
These in turn break down the ozone (O ) molecules that 3 protect Earth from harmful UV radiation.
Worldwide action has reduced the use of CFCs and related compounds.
The CFCs and other Cl- or bromine (Br)-containing ozone- destroying compounds are being replaced with more benign substances.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), such as CH FCF , which have no Cl or Br to form radicals, 2 3 are one alternative.
Another is hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), such as CHCl CF .
2 3 HCFC molecules break down more readily in the troposphere, and fewer ozone- destroying molecules reach the stratosphere.
Ozone in the upper atmosphere shields Earth’s surface from UV radiation from the sun, which can cause skin cancer in humans and is also harmful to other animals and to some plants.
Ozone “holes” in the upper atmosphere (the gray, pink, and purple areas at the center) are large areas of substantial ozone depletion.
They occur mainly over Antarctica from late August through early October and fill in about mid-November.
Ozone depletion has also been Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 606  noted over the Arctic regions.
The largest ozone hole ever observed occurred on 24 September 2006.

Name cycloalkanes given their formulas and write formulas for these compounds given their names.
The hydrocarbons we have encountered so far have been composed of molecules with open-ended chains of carbon atoms.
When a chain contains three or more carbon atoms, the atoms can join to form ring or cyclic structures.
The simplest of these cyclic hydrocarbons has the formula C H .
Each carbon atom has two hydrogen atoms 3 6 attached (Figure 12.6 "Ball-and-Spring Model of Cyclopropane") and is called cyclopropane.
Figure 12.6 Ball-and-Spring Model of Cyclopropane The springs are bent to join the carbon atoms.
To Your Health: Cyclopropane as an Anesthetic With its boiling point of −33°C, cyclopropane is a gas at room temperature.
It is also a potent, quick-acting anesthetic with few undesirable side effects in the body.
It is no longer used in surgery, however, because it forms explosive mixtures with air at nearly all concentrations.
The cycloalkanes—cyclic hydrocarbons with only single bonds—are named by adding the prefix cyclo- to the name of the open-chain compound having the same number of carbon atoms as there are in the ring.
Thus the name for the cyclic compound C H is 4 8 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 609  cyclobutane.
The carbon atoms in cyclic compounds can be represented by line-angle formulas that result in regular geometric figures.
Keep in mind, however, that each corner of the geometric figure represents a carbon atom plus as many hydrogen atoms as needed to give each carbon atom four bonds.
Some cyclic compounds have substituent groups attached.
Example 5 interprets the name of a cycloalkane with a single substituent group.
EXAMPLE 5 Draw the structure for each compound.
1. cyclopentane 2. methylcyclobutane Solution 1.
The name cyclopentane indicates a cyclic (cyclo) alkane with five (pent-) carbon atoms.
It can be represented as a pentagon.

The name methylcyclobutane indicates a cyclic alkane with four (but-) carbon atoms in the cyclic part.
It can be represented as a square with a CH group attached.
3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 610  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Draw the structure for each compound.
a. cycloheptane b. ethylcyclohexane The properties of cyclic hydrocarbons are generally quite similar to those of the corresponding open-chain compounds.
So cycloalkanes (with the exception of cyclopropane, which has a highly strained ring) act very much like noncyclic alkanes.
Cyclic structures containing five or six carbon atoms, such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane, are particularly stable.
We will see in Chapter 16 "Carbohydrates" that some carbohydrates (sugars) form five- or six-membered rings in solution.
Note The cyclopropane ring is strained because the C–C–C angles are 60°, and the preferred (tetrahedral) bond angle is 109.5°.
(This strain is readily evident when you try to build a ball-and-stick model of cyclopropane; see Figure 12.6 "Ball-and-Spring Model of Cyclopropane".)
Cyclopentane and cyclohexane rings have little strain because the C–C– C angles are near the preferred angles.

Most are made from petroleum.
In Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons" we noted that alkanes—saturated hydrocarbons—have relatively few important chemical properties other than that they undergo combustion and react with halogens.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons—hydrocarbons with double or triple bonds—on the other hand, are quite reactive.
In fact, they serve as building blocks for many familiar plastics—polyethylene, vinyl plastics, acrylics—and other important synthetic materials (e.g., alcohols, antifreeze, and detergents).
Aromatic hydrocarbons have formulas that can be drawn as cyclic alkenes, making them appear unsaturated, but their structure and properties are generally quite different, so they are not considered to be alkenes.
Aromatic compounds serve as the basis for many drugs, antiseptics, explosives, solvents, and plastics (e.g., polyesters and polystyrene).
The two simplest unsaturated compounds—ethylene (ethene) and acetylene (ethyne)— were once used as anesthetics and were introduced to the medical field in 1924.
However, it was discovered that acetylene forms explosive mixtures with air, so its medical use was abandoned in 1925.
Ethylene was thought to be safer, but it too was implicated in numerous lethal fires and explosions during anesthesia.
Even so, it remained an important anesthetic into the 1960s, when it was replaced by nonflammable anesthetics such as halothane (CHBrClCF ).
3 13.1 Alkenes: Structures and Names LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Name alkenes given formulas and write formulas for alkenes given names.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 621  As we noted in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", alkenes are hydrocarbons with carbon-to-carbon double bonds (R C=CR ) and 2 2 alkynes are hydrocarbons with carbon-to-carbon triple bonds (R–C≡C–R).
Collectively, they are called unsaturated hydrocarbons because they have fewer hydrogen atoms than does an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms, as is indicated in the following general formulas: Some representative alkenes—their names, structures, and physical properties—are given in Table 13.1 "Physical Properties of Some Selected Alkenes".
Table 13.1 Physical Properties of Some Selected Alkenes IUPAC Molecular Condensed Structural Melting Boiling Name Formula Formula Point (°C) Point (°C) ethene C H CH =CH –169 –104 2 4 2 2 propene C H CH =CHCH –185 –47 3 6 2 3 1-butene C H CH =CHCH CH –185 –6 4 8 2 2 3 1-pentene C H CH =CH(CH ) CH –138 30 5 10 2 2 2 3 1-hexene C H CH =CH(CH ) CH –140 63 6 12 2 2 3 3 1-heptene C H CH =CH(CH ) CH –119 94 7 14 2 2 4 3 1-octene C H CH =CH(CH ) CH –102 121 8 16 2 2 5 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 622  We used only condensed structural formulas in Table 13.1 "Physical Properties of Some Selected Alkenes".
Thus, CH =CH stands for 2 2 The double bond is shared by the two carbon atoms and does not involve the hydrogen atoms, although the condensed formula does not make this point obvious.
Note that the molecular formula for ethene is C H , whereas that for ethane is C H .
2 4 2 6 The first two alkenes in Table 13.1 "Physical Properties of Some Selected Alkenes"— ethene and propene (Figure 13.1 "Ethene and Propene")—are most often called by their common names—ethylene and propylene, respectively.
Ethylene is a major commercial chemical.
The US chemical industry produces about 25 billion kilograms of ethylene annually, more than any other synthetic organic chemical.
More than half of this ethylene goes into the manufacture of polyethylene, one of the most familiar plastics.
(For more information about polymers and plastics, see Section 13.5 "Polymers".)
Propylene is also an important industrial chemical.
It is converted to plastics, isopropyl alcohol, and a variety of other products.
(For more information about alcohols, see Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen", Section 14.2 "Alcohols: Nomenclature and Classification".)
Figure 13.1 Ethene and Propene Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 623  The ball-and-spring models of ethene/ethylene (a) and propene/propylene (b) show their respective shapes, especially bond angles.
Note Although there is only one alkene with the formula C H (ethene) and only one with the 2 4 formula C H (propene), there are several alkenes with the formula C H .
Section 13.2 3 6 4 8 "Cis-Trans Isomers (Geometric Isomers)" begins a discussion of butenes.
Here are some basic rules for naming alkenes from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC): 1.
The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the double bond is considered the parent chain.
It is named using the same stem as the alkane having the same number of carbon atoms but ends in -ene to identify it as an alkene.
Thus the compound CH =CHCH is propene.
2 3 2.
If there are four or more carbon atoms in a chain, we must indicate the position of the double bond.
The carbons atoms are numbered so that the first of the two that are doubly bonded is given the lower of the two possible numbers.
The compound CH CH=CHCH CH , for example, has the double bond between the 3 2 3 second and third carbon atoms.
Its name is 2-pentene (not 3-pentene).
3.
Substituent groups are named as with alkanes, and their position is indicated by a number.
Thus, is 5-methyl-2-hexene.
Note that the numbering of the parent chain is always done in such a way as to give the double bond the lowest number, even if that causes a substituent to have a higher number.
The double bond always has priority in numbering.
EXAMPLE 1 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 624  Name each compound.
1.
2.
Solution 1.
The longest chain containing the double bond has five carbon atoms, so the compound is a pentene (rule 1).
To give the first carbon atom of the double bond the lowest number (rule 2), we number from the left, so the compound is a 2-pentene.
There is a methyl group on the fourth carbon atom (rule 3), so the compound’s name is 4-methyl-2-pentene.
2.
The longest chain containing the double bond has four carbon atoms, so the parent compound is a butene (rule 1).
(The longest chain overall has five carbon atoms, but it does not contain the double bond, so the parent name is notpentene.)
To give the first carbon atom of the double bond the lowest number (rule 2), we number from the left, so the compound is a 1-butene.
There is an ethyl group on the second carbon atom (rule 3), so the compound’s name is 2-ethyl-1-butene.

Recognize that alkenes that can exist as cis-trans isomers.
2.
Classify isomers as cis or trans.
3.
Draw structures for cis-trans isomers given their names.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 631  As noted in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch12, there is free rotation about the carbon-to-carbon single bonds (C–C) in alkanes.
In contrast, the structure of alkenes requires that the carbon atoms of a double bond and the two atoms bonded to each carbon atom all lie in a single plane, and that each doubly bonded carbon atom lies in the center of a triangle.
This part of the molecule’s structure is rigid; rotation about doubly bonded carbon atoms is notpossible without rupturing the bond.
Look at the two chlorinated hydrocarbons in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch13_s02_f01.
Figure 13.2 Rotation about Bonds In 1,2-dichloroethane (a), free rotation about the C–C bond allows the two structures to be interconverted by a twist of one end relative to the other.
In 1,2-dichloroethene (b), restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond are significant.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 632  In 1,2-dichloroethane (part (a) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch13_s02_f01), there is free rotation about the C–C bond.
The two models shown represent exactly the same molecule; they are not isomers.
You can draw structural formulas that look different, but if you bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bonds, you should recognize that these two structures represent the same molecule: In 1,2-dichloroethene (part (b) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch13_s02_f01), however, restricted rotation about the double bond means that the relative positions of substituent groups above or below the double bond become significant.
This leads to a special kind of isomerism.
The isomer in which the two chlorine (Cl) atoms lie on the same side of the molecule is called the cis isomer (Latin cis, meaning “on this side”) and is named cis-1,2-dichloroethene.
The isomer with the two Cl atoms on opposite sides of the molecule is the trans isomer (Latin trans, meaning “across”) and is named trans- 1,2-dichloroethene.
These two compounds are cis-trans isomers (or geometric isomers), compounds that have different configurations (groups permanently in different places in space) because of the presence of a rigid structure in their molecule.
Consider the alkene with the condensed structural formula CH CH=CHCH .
We could 3 3 name it 2-butene, but there are actually two such compounds; the double bond results in cis-trans isomerism (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch13_s02_f02).
Figure 13.3 Ball-and-Spring Models of (a) Cis-2-Butene and (b) Trans-2-Butene Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 633  Cis-trans isomers have different physical, chemical, and physiological properties.
Cis-2-butene has both methyl groups on the same side of the molecule.
Trans-2-butene has the methyl groups on opposite sides of the molecule.
Their structural formulas are as follows: Note, however, that the presence of a double bond does not necessarily lead to cis-trans isomerism.
We can draw two seemingly different propenes: However, these two structures are not really different from each other.
If you could pick up either molecule from the page and flip it over top to bottom, you would see that the two formulas are identical.
Thus there are two requirements for cis-trans isomerism: Rotation must be restricted in the molecule.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 634  There must be two nonidentical groups on each doubly bonded carbon atom.
In these propene structures, the second requirement for cis-trans isomerism is not fulfilled.
One of the doubly bonded carbon atoms does have two different groups attached, but the rules require that both carbon atoms have two different groups.
In general, the following statements hold true in cis-trans isomerism: Alkenes with a C=CH unit do not exist as cis-trans isomers.
2 Alkenes with a C=CR unit, where the two R groups are the same, do not exist as cis- 2 trans isomers.
Alkenes of the type R–CH=CH–R can exist as cis and trans isomers; cis if the two R groups are on the same side of the carbon-to-carbon double bond, and trans if the two R groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-to-carbon double bond.
Cis-trans isomerism also occurs in cyclic compounds.
In ring structures, groups are unable to rotate about any of the ring carbon–carbon bonds.
Therefore, groups can be either on the same side of the ring (cis) or on opposite sides of the ring (trans).
For our purposes here, we represent all cycloalkanes as planar structures, and we indicate the positions of the groups, either above or below the plane of the ring.

Identify the physical properties of alkenes and describe trends in these properties.
The physical properties of alkenes are similar to those of the alkanes.
Table 13.1 "Physical Properties of Some Selected Alkenes" (in Section 13.1 "Alkenes: Structures and Names") shows that the boiling points of straight-chain alkenes increase with increasing molar mass, just as with alkanes.
For molecules with the same number of carbon atoms and the same general shape, the boiling points usually differ only slightly, just as we would expect for substances whose molar mass differs by only 2 u (equivalent to two hydrogen atoms).
Like other hydrocarbons, the alkenes are insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents.
Looking Closer: Environmental Note Alkenes occur widely in nature.
Ripening fruits and vegetables give off ethylene, which triggers further ripening.
Fruit processors artificially introduce ethylene to hasten the ripening process; exposure to as little as 0.1 mg of ethylene for 24 h can ripen 1 kg of tomatoes.
Unfortunately, this process does not exactly duplicate the ripening process, and tomatoes picked green and treated this way don’t taste much like vine-ripened tomatoes fresh from the garden.
Other alkenes that occur in nature include 1-octene, a constituent of lemon oil, and octadecene (C H ) found in fish liver.
Dienes (two double bonds) and polyenes (three 18 36 or more double bonds) are also common.
Butadiene (CH =CHCH=CH ) is found in 2 2 coffee.
Lycopene and the carotenes are isomeric polyenes (C H ) that give the 40 56 attractive red, orange, and yellow colors to watermelons, tomatoes, carrots, and other fruits and vegetables.
Vitamin A, essential to good vision, is derived from a carotene.
The world would be a much less colorful place without alkenes.

Write equations for the addition reactions of alkenes with hydrogen, halogens, and water.
Alkenes are valued mainly for addition reactions, in which one of the bonds in the double bond is broken.
Each of the carbon atoms in the bond can then attach another atom or group while remaining joined to each other by a single bond.
Perhaps the simplest addition reaction is hydrogenation—a reaction with hydrogen (H ) 2 in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel (Ni) or platinum (Pt).
The product is an alkane having the same carbon skeleton as the alkene.
(The use of hydrogenation to convert unsaturated vegetable oils to saturated fats is discussed inChapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils".)
Alkenes also readily undergo halogenation—the addition of halogens.
Indeed, the reaction with bromine (Br ) can be used to test for alkenes.
Bromine solutions are 2 brownish red.
When we add a Br solution to an alkene, the color of the solution 2 disappears because the alkene reacts with the bromine: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 643  Another important addition reaction is that between an alkene and water to form an alcohol.
This reaction, called hydration, requires a catalyst—usually a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid (H SO ): 2 4 The hydration reaction is discussed further in Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen", Section 14.4 "Reactions That Form Alcohols", where we deal with this reaction in the synthesis of alcohols.

13.5 Polymers LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Draw structures for monomers that can undergo addition polymerization and for four- monomer-unit sections of an addition polymer.
The most important commercial reactions of alkenes are polymerizations, reactions in which small molecules, referred to in general as monomers (from the Greek monos, meaning “one,” and meros, meaning “parts”), are assembled into giant molecules referred to as polymers (from the Greek poly, meaning “many,” and meros, meaning “parts”).
A polymer is as different from its monomer as a long strand of spaghetti is from a tiny speck of flour.
For example, polyethylene, the familiar waxy material used to make plastic bags, is made from the monomer ethylene—a gas.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 647  The Production of Polyethylene There are two general types of polymerization reactions: addition polymerization and condensation polymerization.
(For more information about condensation polymerization, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s08.)
In addition polymerization, the monomers add to one another in such a way that the polymer contains all the atoms of the starting monomers.
Ethylene molecules are joined together in long chains.
The polymerization can be represented by the reaction of a few monomer units: The bond lines extending at the ends in the formula of the product indicate that the structure extends for many units in each direction.
Notice that all the atoms—two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms—of each monomer molecule are incorporated into the polymer structure.
Because displays such as the one above are cumbersome, the polymerization is often abbreviated as follows: Note Many natural materials—such as proteins, cellulose and starch, and complex silicate minerals—are polymers.
(For more information about proteins and cellulose/starch, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 648  and http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s07, respectively.)
Artificial fibers, films, plastics, semisolid resins, and rubbers are also polymers.
More than half the compounds produced by the chemical industry are synthetic polymers.
Some common addition polymers are listed in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch13_s05_t01.
Note that all the monomers have carbon-to-carbon double bonds.
Many polymers are mundane (e.g., plastic bags, food wrap, toys, and tableware), but there are also polymers that conduct electricity, have amazing adhesive properties, or are stronger than steel but much lighter in weight.
Table 13.2 Some Addition Polymers Polymer Monomer Polymer Name Some Uses plastic bags, bottles, toys, ~CH CH CH CH CH CH electrical 2 2 2 2 2 CH =CH ~ polyethylene insulation 2 2 2 carpeting, bottles, CH =CHC luggage, exercise 2 H polypropylene clothing 3 bags for intravenous solutions, pipes, polyvinyl tubing, floor CH =CHCl chloride coverings 2 nonstick coatings, polytetrafluor electrical CF =CF ~CF CF CF CF CF CF ~ oethylene insulation 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Medical Uses of Polymers Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 649  An interesting use of polymers is the replacement of diseased, worn out, or missing parts in the body.
For example, about a 250,000 hip joints and 500,000 knees are replaced in US hospitals each year.
The artificial ball-and-socket hip joints are made of a special steel (the ball) and plastic (the socket).
People crippled by arthritis or injuries gain freedom of movement and relief from pain.
Patients with heart and circulatory problems can be helped by replacing worn out heart valves with parts based on synthetic polymers.
These are only a few of the many biomedical uses of polymers.
Figure 13.4 Hip Joint Replacement Synthetic polymers are an important part of a hip joint replacement.
The hip is much like a ball-and-socket joint, and total hip replacements mimic this with a metal ball that fits in a plastic cup.

2.
Name alkynes given formulas and write formulas for alkynes given names.
The simplest alkyne—a hydrocarbon with carbon-to-carbon triple bond—has the molecular formula C H and is known by its common name—acetylene (Figure 13.5 2 2 "Ball-and-Spring Model of Acetylene").
Its structure is H–C≡C–H.
Figure 13.5 Ball-and-Spring Model of Acetylene Acetylene (ethyne) is the simplest member of the alkyne family .
Note Acetylene is used in oxyacetylene torches for cutting and welding metals.
The flame from such a torch can be very hot.
Most acetylene, however, is converted to chemical intermediates that are used to make vinyl and acrylic plastics, fibers, resins, and a variety of other products.
Alkynes are similar to alkenes in both physical and chemical properties.
For example, alkynes undergo many of the typical addition reactions of alkenes.
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names for alkynes parallel those of alkenes, except that the family ending is -yne rather than -ene.
The IUPAC name for acetylene is ethyne.
The names of other alkynes are illustrated in the following exercises.

Describe the bonding in benzene and the way typical reactions of benzene differ from those of the alkenes.
Next we consider a class of hydrocarbons with molecular formulas like those of unsaturated hydrocarbons, but which, unlike the alkenes, do not readily undergo addition reactions.
These compounds comprise a distinct class, called aromatic hydrocarbons, with unique structures and properties.
We start with the simplest of these compounds.
Benzene (C H ) is of great commercial importance, but it also has 6 6 noteworthy health effects (see “To Your Health: Benzene and Us”).
The formula C H seems to indicate that benzene has a high degree of unsaturation.
6 6 (Hexane, the saturated hydrocarbon with six carbon atoms has the formula C H —eight 6 14 more hydrogen atoms than benzene.)
However, despite the seeming low level of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 654  saturation, benzene is rather unreactive.
It does not, for example, react readily with bromine, which, as mentioned in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch13_s01, is a test for unsaturation.
Note Benzene is a liquid that smells like gasoline, boils at 80°C, and freezes at 5.5°C.
It is the aromatic hydrocarbon produced in the largest volume.
It was formerly used to decaffeinate coffee and was a significant component of many consumer products, such as paint strippers, rubber cements, and home dry-cleaning spot removers.
It was removed from many product formulations in the 1950s, but others continued to use benzene in products until the 1970s when it was associated with leukemia deaths.
Benzene is still important in industry as a precursor in the production of plastics (such as Styrofoam and nylon), drugs, detergents, synthetic rubber, pesticides, and dyes.
It is used as a solvent for such things as cleaning and maintaining printing equipment and for adhesives such as those used to attach soles to shoes.
Benzene is a natural constituent of petroleum products, but because it is a known carcinogen, its use as an additive in gasoline is now limited.
To explain the surprising properties of benzene, chemists suppose the molecule has a cyclic, hexagonal, planar structure of six carbon atoms with one hydrogen atom bonded to each.
We can write a structure with alternate single and double bonds, either as a full structural formula or as a line-angle formula: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 655  However, these structures do not explain the unique properties of benzene.
Furthermore, experimental evidence indicates that all the carbon-to-carbon bonds in benzene are equivalent, and the molecule is unusually stable.
Chemists often represent benzene as a hexagon with an inscribed circle: The inner circle indicates that the valence electrons are shared equally by all six carbon atoms (that is, the electrons are delocalized, or spread out, over all the carbon atoms).
It is understood that each corner of the hexagon is occupied by one carbon atom, and each carbon atom has one hydrogen atom attached to it.
Any other atom or groups of atoms substituted for a hydrogen atom must be shown bonded to a particular corner of the hexagon.
We use this modern symbolism, but many scientists still use the earlier structure with alternate double and single bonds.
To Your Health: Benzene and Us Most of the benzene used commercially comes from petroleum.
It is employed as a starting material for the production of detergents, drugs, dyes, insecticides, and plastics.
Once widely used as an organic solvent, benzene is now known to have both short- and long-term toxic effects.
The inhalation of large concentrations can cause nausea and even death due to respiratory or heart failure, while repeated exposure leads to a progressive disease in which the ability of the bone marrow to make new blood cells is eventually destroyed.
This results in a condition called aplastic anemia, in which there is a decrease in the numbers of both the red and white blood cells.
CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
How do the typical reactions of benzene differ from those of the alkenes?
2.
Briefly describe the bonding in benzene.
3.
What does the circle mean in the chemist’s representation of benzene?
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 656  ANSWERS 1.
Benzene is rather unreactive toward addition reactions compared to an alkene.
2.
Valence electrons are shared equally by all six carbon atoms (that is, the electrons are delocalized).
3.
The six electrons are shared equally by all six carbon atoms.
KEY TAKEAWAY Aromatic hydrocarbons appear to be unsaturated, but they have a special type of ` bonding and do not undergo addition reactions.

13.8 Structure and Nomenclature of Aromatic Compounds LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 657  1.
Recognize aromatic compounds from structural formulas.
2.
Name aromatic compounds given formulas.
3.
Write formulas for aromatic compounds given their names.
Historically, benzene-like substances were called aromatic hydrocarbons because they had distinctive aromas.
Today, an aromatic compound is any compound that contains a benzene ring or has certain benzene-like properties (but not necessarily a strong aroma).
You can recognize the aromatic compounds in this text by the presence of one or more benzene rings in their structure.
Some representative aromatic compounds and their uses are listed in Table 13.3 "Some Representative Aromatic Compounds", where the benzene ring is represented as C H .

In the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system, aromatic hydrocarbons are named as derivatives of benzene.
Figure 13.6 "Some Benzene Derivatives" shows four examples.
In these structures, it is immaterial whether the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 660  single substituent is written at the top, side, or bottom of the ring: a hexagon is symmetrical, and therefore all positions are equivalent.
Figure 13.6 Some Benzene Derivatives These compounds are named in the usual way with the group that replaces a hydrogen atom named as a substituent group: Cl as chloro, Br as bromo, I as iodo, NO as nitro, 2 and CH CH as ethyl.
3 2 Although some compounds are referred to exclusively by IUPAC names, some are more frequently denoted by common names, as is indicated in Table 13.3 "Some Representative Aromatic Compounds".
When there is more than one substituent, the corners of the hexagon are no longer equivalent, so we must designate the relative positions.
There are three possible disubstituted benzenes, and we can use numbers to distinguish them (Figure 13.7 "The Three Isomeric Dichlorobenzenes").
We start numbering at the carbon atom to which Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 661  one of the groups is attached and count toward the carbon atom that bears the other substituent group by the shortest path.
Figure 13.7 The Three Isomeric Dichlorobenzenes In Figure 13.7 "The Three Isomeric Dichlorobenzenes", common names are also used: the prefix ortho (o-) for 1,2-disubstitution, meta (m-) for 1,3-disubstitution, and para(p- ) for 1,4-disubstitution.
The substituent names are listed in alphabetical order.
The first substituent is given the lowest number.
When a common name is used, the carbon atom that bears the group responsible for the name is given the number 1: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 662  EXAMPLE 6 Name each compound using both the common name and the IUPAC name.

Solution 1.
The benzene ring has two chlorine atoms (dichloro) in the first and second positions.
The compound is o-dichlorobenzene or 1,2-dichlorobenzene.
2.
The benzene ring has a methyl (CH ) group.
The compound is therefore named as a 3 derivative of toluene.
The bromine atom is on the fourth carbon atom, counting from the methyl group.
The compound is p-bromotoluene or 4-bromotoluene.
3.
The benzene ring has two nitro (NO ) groups in the first and third positions.
It ism- 2 dinitrobenzene or 1,3-dinitrobenzene.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 663  Note The nitro (NO ) group is a common substituent in aromatic compounds.
Many nitro 2 compounds are explosive, most notably 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 664  Sometimes an aromatic group is found as a substituent bonded to a nonaromatic entity or to another aromatic ring.
The group of atoms remaining when a hydrogen atom is removed from an aromatic compound is called an aryl group.
The most common aryl group is derived from benzene (C H ) by removing one hydrogen atom (C H ) and is 6 6 6 5 called a phenyl group, from pheno, an old name for benzene.
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Some common aromatic hydrocarbons consist of fused benzene rings—rings that share a common side.
These compounds are called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
The three examples shown here are colorless, crystalline solids generally obtained from coal tar.
Naphthalene has a pungent odor and is used in mothballs.
Anthracene is used in the manufacture of certain dyes.
Steroids, a large group of naturally occurring substances, contain the phenanthrene structure.
(For more information about steroids, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.4 "Steroids".)
To Your Health: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Cancer The intense heating required for distilling coal tar results in the formation of PAHs.
For many years, it has been known that workers in coal-tar refineries are susceptible to a type of skin cancer known as tar cancer.
Investigations have shown that a number of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 665  PAHs are carcinogens.
One of the most active carcinogenic compounds, benzopyrene, occurs in coal tar and has also been isolated from cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust gases, and charcoal-broiled steaks.
It is estimated that more than 1,000 t of benzopyrene are emitted into the air over the United States each year.
Only a few milligrams of benzopyrene per kilogram of body weight are required to induce cancer in experimental animals.
Biologically Important Compounds with Benzene Rings Substances containing the benzene ring are common in both animals and plants, although they are more abundant in the latter.
Plants can synthesize the benzene ring from carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic materials.
Animals cannot synthesize it, but they are dependent on certain aromatic compounds for survival and therefore must obtain them from food.
Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (essential amino acids) and vitamins K, B (riboflavin), and B (folic acid) all contain the benzene ring.
(For 2 9 more information about vitamins, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes", Section 18.9 "Enzyme Cofactors and Vitamins".)
Many important drugs, a few of which are shown in Table 13.4 "Some Drugs That Contain a Benzene Ring", also feature a benzene ring.
Note So far we have studied only aromatic compounds with carbon-containing rings.
However, many cyclic compounds have an element other than carbon atoms in the ring.
These compounds, called heterocyclic compounds, are discussed inChapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", Section 15.13 "Amines as Bases".
Some of these are heterocyclic aromatic compounds.

Any hydrocarbon containing either a double or triple bond is an unsaturated hydrocarbon.
Alkenes have a carbon-to-carbon double bond.
The general formula for alkenes with one double bond is C H .
Alkenes can be straight chain, branched n 2n chain, or cyclic.
Simple alkenes often have common names, but all alkenes can be named by the system of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
Cis-trans isomers (or geometric isomers) are characterized by molecules that differ only in their configuration around a rigid part of the structure, such as a carbon– to-carbon double bond or a ring.
The molecule having two identical (or closely related) atoms or groups on the same side is the cis isomer; the one having the two groups on opposite sides is the trans isomer.
The physical properties of alkenes are quite similar to those of alkanes.
Like other hydrocarbons, alkenes are insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents.
More reactive than alkanes, alkenes undergo addition reactions across the double bond: Addition of hydrogen (hydrogenation): Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 675  CH =CH + H → CH CH 2 2 2 3 3 Addition of halogen (halogenation): CH =CH + X → XCH CH X 2 2 2 2 2 where X = F, Cl, Br, or I.
Addition of water (hydration): CH =CH + HOH → HCH CH OH 2 2 2 2 Alkenes also undergo addition polymerization, molecules joining together to form long-chain molecules.
…CH =CH + CH =CH + CH =CH +…→…CH CH –CH CH –CH CH –… 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 The reactant units are monomers, and the product is a polymer.
Alkynes have a carbon-to-carbon triple bond.
The general formula for alkynes is C H n 2n− .
The properties of alkynes are quite similar to those of alkenes.
They are named much 2 like alkenes but with the ending -yne.
The cyclic hydrocarbon benzene (C H ) has a ring of carbon atoms.
The molecule seems 6 6 to be unsaturated, but it does not undergo the typical reactions expected of alkenes.
The electrons that might be fixed in three double bonds are insteaddelocalized over all six carbon atoms.
A hydrocarbon containing one or more benzene rings (or other similarly stable electron arrangements) is an aromatic hydrocarbon, and any related substance is an aromatic compound.
One or more of the hydrogen atoms on a benzene ring can be replaced by other atoms.
When two hydrogen atoms are replaced, the product name is based on the relative position of the replacement atoms (or atom groups).
A 1,2- disubstituted benzene is designated as an ortho (o-) isomer; 1,3-, a meta (m-) isomer; and 1,4-, a para (p-) isomer.
An aromatic group as a substituent is called an aryl group.
A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) has fused benzene rings sharing a common side.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 682  Chapter 14 Organic Compounds of Oxygen Opening Essay One of the more familiar chemical compounds on Earth is ethyl alcohol (ethanol).
As the intoxicant in alcoholic beverages, ethanol is often simply called alcohol.
If ethanol is diluted, as it is in wine, beer, or mixed drinks with about 1 oz of liquor, and if it is consumed in small quantities, it is relatively safe.
In excess—four or more drinks in a few hours—it causes intoxication, which is characterized by a loss of coordination, nausea and vomiting, and memory blackouts.
Excessive ingestion of ethanol over a long period of time leads to cirrhosis of the liver, alteration of brain cell function, nerve damage, and strong physiological addiction.
Alcoholism—an addiction to ethanol—is the most serious drug problem in the United States.
Heavy drinking shortens a person’s life span by contributing to diseases of the liver, the cardiovascular system, and virtually every other organ of the body.
In small quantities—one or two drinks a day—ethanol might promote health.
In addition to the possible benefits of modest amounts of ethanol, a chemical in red wines, resveratrol, is thought to lower the risk of heart disease.
Resveratrol, found in red grapes, is an antioxidant.
It inhibits the oxidation of cholesterol and subsequent clogging of the arteries.
One need not drink wine to get the benefits of resveratrol, however.
It can be obtained by eating the grapes or drinking red grape juice.
Ethanol and resveratrol, a phenol, are representatives of two of the families of oxygen- containing compounds that we consider in this chapter.
Two other classes, aldehydes and ketones, are formed by the oxidation of alcohols.
Ethers, another class, are made by the dehydration of alcohols.
14.1 Organic Compounds with Functional Groups LEARNING OBJECTIVE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 683  1.
Describe functional groups and explain why they are useful in the study of organic chemistry.
In Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons" and Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", we considered several kinds of hydrocarbons.
Now we examine some of the many organic compounds that contain functional groups.
We first introduced the idea of the functional group, a specific structural arrangement of atoms or bonds that imparts a characteristic chemical reactivity to the molecule, in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", Section 4.6 "Introduction to Organic Chemistry".
If you understand the behavior of a particular functional group, you will know a great deal about the general properties of that class of compounds.
In this chapter and Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", we make a brief yet systematic study of some of organic compound families.
Each family is based on a common, simple functional group that contains an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom.
Some common functional groups are listed in Table 14.1 "Selected Organic Functional Groups".

Identify the general structure for an alcohol.
2.
Identify the structural feature that classifies alcohols as primary, secondary, or tertiary.
3.
Name alcohols with both common names and IUPAC names.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 686  As noted in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds", an alcohol is an organic compound with a hydroxyl (OH) functional group on an aliphatic carbon atom.
Because OH is the functional group of all alcohols, we often represent alcohols by the general formula ROH, where R is an alkyl group.
(For more information about alkyl groups, see Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons", Section 12.5 "IUPAC Nomenclature".
Table 12.4 "Common Alkyl Groups" presents some common alkyl groups.)
Alcohols are common in nature.
Most people are familiar with ethyl alcohol (ethanol), the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, but this compound is only one of a family of organic compounds known as alcohols.
The family also includes such familiar substances as cholesterol and the carbohydrates.
As we noted in Chapter 4 "Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds",Section 4.6 "Introduction to Organic Chemistry", methanol (CH OH) and 3 ethanol (CH CH OH) are the first two members of the homologous series of alcohols.
3 2 Nomenclature of Alcohols Alcohols with one to four carbon atoms are frequently called by common names, in which the name of the alkyl group is followed by the word alcohol: According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), alcohols are named by changing the ending of the parent alkane name (Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons", Section 12.5 "IUPAC Nomenclature") to -ol.
Here are some basic IUPAC rules for naming alcohols: 1.
The longest continuous chain (LCC) of carbon atoms containing the OH group is taken as the parent compound—an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms.
The chain is numbered from the end nearest the OH group.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 687  2.
The number that indicates the position of the OH group is prefixed to the name of the parent hydrocarbon, and the -e ending of the parent alkane is replaced by the suffix -ol.
(In cyclic alcohols, the carbon atom bearing the OH group is designated C1, but the 1 is not used in the name.)
Substituents are named and numbered as in alkanes.
3.
If more than one OH group appears in the same molecule (polyhydroxy alcohols), suffixes such as -diol and -triol are used.
In these cases, the -e ending of the parent alkane is retained.
Figure 14.1 "IUPAC Rules for Alcohols" shows some examples of the application of these rules.
Figure 14.1 IUPAC Rules for Alcohols The names and structures of some alcohols demonstrate the use of IUPAC rules.
EXAMPLE 1 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 688  Give the IUPAC name for each compound.

2.
HOCH CH CH CH CH OH 2 2 2 2 2 Solution 1.
Ten carbon atoms in the LCC makes the compound a derivative of decane (rule 1), and the OH on the third carbon atom makes it a 3-decanol (rule 2).
The carbon atoms are numbered from the end closest to the OH group.
That fixes the two methyl (CH ) groups at the sixth and eighth positions.
The name is 6,8-dimethyl-3- 3 decanol (not 3,5-dimethyl-8-decanol).
2.
Five carbon atoms in the LCC make the compound a derivative of pentane.
Two OH groups on the first and fifth carbon atoms make the compound a diol and give the name 1,5-pentanediol (rule 3).

The 2 indicates that the OH group is attached to the second carbon atom.
Finally, we add enough hydrogen atoms to give each carbon atom four bonds.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 690  2.
The ending -ol indicates an OH functional group, and the pent- stem tells us that there are five carbon atoms in the LCC.

3-heptanol 2.
2-methyl-3-hexanol Classification of Alcohols Some of the properties of alcohols depend on the number of carbon atoms attached to the specific carbon atom that is attached to the OH group.
Alcohols can be grouped into three classes on this basis.
A primary (1°) alcohol is one in which the carbon atom (in red) with the OH group is attached to one other carbon atom (in blue).
Its general formula is RCH OH.
2 A secondary (2°) alcohol is one in which the carbon atom (in red) with the OH group is attached to two other carbon atoms (in blue).
Its general formula is R CHOH.
2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 691  A tertiary (3°) alcohol is one in which the carbon atom (in red) with the OH group is attached to three other carbon atoms (in blue).
Its general formula is R COH.
3 Table 14.2 "Classification and Nomenclature of Some Alcohols" names and classifies some of the simpler alcohols.
Some of the common names reflect a compound’s classification as secondary (sec-) or tertiary (tert-).
These designations are not used in the IUPAC nomenclature system for alcohols.
Note that there are four butyl alcohols in the table, corresponding to the four butyl groups: the butyl group (CH CH CH CH ) 3 2 2 2 introduced in Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons", Section 12.5 "IUPAC Nomenclature", and three others: Table 14.2 Classification and Nomenclature of Some Alcohols Condensed Structural Class of Common Formula Alcohol Name IUPAC Name CH OH — methyl alcohol methanol 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 692  Condensed Structural Class of Common Formula Alcohol Name IUPAC Name CH CH OH primary ethyl alcohol ethanol 3 2 CH CH CH OH primary propyl alcohol 1-propanol 3 2 2 isopropyl (CH ) CHOH secondary alcohol 2-propanol 3 2 CH CH CH CH OH primary butyl alcohol 1-butanol 3 2 2 2 sec-butyl CH CH CHOHCH secondary alcohol 2-butanol 3 2 3 isobutyl 2-methyl-1- (CH ) (CH ) CHCH OH primary alcohol propanol 3 2 3 2 2 tert-butyl 2-methyl-2- (CH ) COH tertiary alcohol propanol 3 3 cyclohexyl secondary alcohol cyclohexanol CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.

Explain why the boiling points of alcohols are higher than those of ethers and alkanes of similar molar masses.
2.
Explain why alcohols and ethers of four or fewer carbon atoms are soluble in water while comparable alkanes are not soluble.
Alcohols can be considered derivatives of water (H O; also written as HOH).
2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 697  Like the H–O–H bond in water, the R–O–H bond is bent, and alcohol molecules are polar.
This relationship is particularly apparent in small molecules and reflected in the physical and chemical properties of alcohols with low molar mass.
Replacing a hydrogen atom from an alkane with an OH group allows the molecules to associate through hydrogen bonding (Figure 14.2 "Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding in Methanol").
Recall from Chapter 8 "Solids, Liquids, and Gases" that physical properties are determined to a large extent by the type of intermolecular forces.
Table 14.3 "Comparison of Boiling Points and Molar Masses" lists the molar masses and the boiling points of some common compounds.
The table shows that substances with similar molar masses can have quite different boiling points.
Alkanes are nonpolar and are thus associated only through relatively weak dispersion forces.
Alkanes with one to four carbon atoms are gases at room temperature.
In contrast, even methanol (with one carbon atom) is a liquid at room temperature.
Hydrogen bonding greatly increases the boiling points of alcohols compared to hydrocarbons of comparable molar mass.
The boiling point is a rough measure of the amount of energy necessary to separate a liquid molecule from its nearest neighbors.
If the molecules interact through hydrogen bonding, a relatively large quantity of energy must be supplied to break those intermolecular attractions.
Only then can the molecule escape from the liquid into the gaseous state.
Figure 14.2 Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding in Methanol Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 698  The OH groups of alcohol molecules make hydrogen bonding possible.

Thus, whereas the hydrocarbons are insoluble in water, alcohols with one to three carbon atoms are completely soluble.
As the length of the chain increases, however, the solubility of alcohols in water decreases; the molecules become more like hydrocarbons and less like water.

CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
Why is ethanol more soluble in water than 1-hexanol?
2.
Why does 1-butanol have a lower boiling point than 1-hexanol?
ANSWERS 1.
Ethanol has an OH group and only 2 carbon atoms; 1-hexanol has one OH group for 6 carbon atoms and is thus more like a (nonpolar) hydrocarbon than ethanol is.
2.
The molar mass of 1-hexanol is greater than that of 1-butanol.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 701  KEY TAKEAWAYS Alcohols have higher boiling points than do ethers and alkanes of similar molar masses  because the OH group allows alcohol molecules to engage in hydrogen bonding.
Alcohols of four or fewer carbon atoms are soluble in water because the alcohol  molecules engage in hydrogen bonding with water molecules; comparable alkane molecules cannot engage in hydrogen bonding.

1-octanol < 1-butanol < methanol 14.4 Reactions That Form Alcohols LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe how to prepare alcohols from alkenes.
Methanol is prepared by combining hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst composed of zinc oxide (ZnO) and chromium oxide (Cr O ) catalyst: 2 3 Methanol is an important solvent and is used as an automotive fuel, either as the pure liquid—as in some racing cars—or as an additive in gasoline.
Note Nearly 2 billion gallons of methanol are produced each year in the United States by the catalytic reduction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen gas.
Many simple alcohols are made by the hydration of alkenes.
(For more information about the hydration of alkenes, see Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", Section 13.4 "Chemical Properties of Alkenes".)
Ethanol is made by the hydration of ethylene in the presence of a catalyst such as sulfuric acid (H SO ).
2 4 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 703  In a similar manner, isopropyl alcohol is produced by the addition of water to propene (propylene).
Note Additional Exercise 19 describes how to use a generalization called Markovnikov’s rule to predict the results when the addition of water to an alcohol has two possible products.
EXAMPLE 3 Write the equation for the reaction of 2-butene with water to form 2-butanol.
Indicate that sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst.
Solution First write the condensed structural formula of 2-butene and indicate that it reacts with water.
Then write the condensed structural formula of 2-butanol after the reaction arrow to indicate that it is the product.
Finally, write the formula for the catalyst above the arrow.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 704  SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Write the equation for the reaction of cyclopentene with water to form cyclopentanol.
Indicate that phosphoric acid (H PO ) is used as a catalyst.
3 4 Note Many OH compounds in living systems are formed by alkene hydration.
Here is an example that occurs in the Krebs cycle: fumarate is hydrated to form malate.
(For more information about the Krebs cycle, see Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism", Section 20.4 "Stage III of Catabolism".)
In addition to its preparation from ethylene, ethanol is made by the fermentation of sugars or starch from various sources (potatoes, corn, wheat, rice, etc.).
Fermentation is catalyzed by enzymes found in yeast and proceeds by an elaborate multistep mechanism.
We can represent the overall process as follows: To Your Health: The Physiological Effects of Alcohols Methanol is quite poisonous to humans.
Ingestion of as little as 15 mL of methanol can cause blindness, and 30 mL (1 oz) can cause death.
However, the usual fatal dose is 100 to 150 mL.
The main reason for methanol’s toxicity is that we have liver enzymes that catalyze its oxidation to formaldehyde, the simplest member of the aldehyde family (Section 14.9 "Aldehydes and Ketones: Structure and Names"): Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 705  Formaldehyde reacts rapidly with the components of cells, coagulating proteins in much the same way that cooking coagulates an egg.
This property of formaldehyde accounts for much of the toxicity of methanol.
Note Organic and biochemical equations are frequently written showing only the organic reactants and products.
In this way, we focus attention on the organic starting material and product, rather than on balancing complicated equations.
Ethanol is oxidized in the liver to acetaldehyde: The acetaldehyde is in turn oxidized to acetic acid (HC H O ), a normal constituent of 2 3 2 cells, which is then oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.
Even so, ethanol is potentially toxic to humans.
The rapid ingestion of 1 pt (about 500 mL) of pure ethanol would kill most people, and acute ethanol poisoning kills several hundred people each year—often those engaged in some sort of drinking contest.
Ethanol freely crosses into the brain, where it depresses the respiratory control center, resulting in failure of the respiratory muscles in the lungs and hence suffocation.
Ethanol is believed to act on nerve cell membranes, causing a diminution in speech, thought, cognition, and judgment.
Rubbing alcohol is usually a 70% aqueous solution of isopropyl alcohol.
It has a high vapor pressure, and its rapid evaporation from the skin produces a cooling effect.
It is toxic when ingested but, compared to methanol, is less readily absorbed through the skin.
CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 706  1.
Why is methanol more toxic than ethanol?
2.
How does rubbing alcohol cool a feverish patient?
ANSWERS 1.
Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde, which destroys tissue; ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde and then acetic acid, a normal metabolite.
2.
Evaporation removes heat.

ANSWER 1. ethylene; CH =CH 2 2 14.5 Reactions of Alcohols LEARNING OBJECTIVES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 707  1.
Give two major types of reactions of alcohols.
2.
Describe the result of the oxidation of a primary alcohol.
3.
Describe the result of the oxidation of a secondary alcohol.
Chemical reactions in alcohols occur mainly at the functional group, but some involve hydrogen atoms attached to the OH-bearing carbon atom or to an adjacent carbon atom.
Of the three major kinds of alcohol reactions, which are summarized in Figure 14.4 "Reactions of Alcohols", two—dehydration and oxidation—are considered here.
The third reaction type—esterification—is covered in Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", Section 15.8 "Preparation of Esters".
Figure 14.4 Reactions of Alcohols Oxidation and dehydration of alcohols are considered here.
Dehydration As noted in Figure 14.4 "Reactions of Alcohols", an alcohol undergoes dehydration in the presence of a catalyst to form an alkene and water.
The reaction removes the OH group from the alcohol carbon atom and a hydrogen atom from an adjacent carbon atom in the same molecule: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 708  Under the proper conditions, it is possible for the dehydration to occur between twoalcohol molecules.
The entire OH group of one molecule and only the hydrogen atom of the OH group of the second molecule are removed.
The two ethyl groups attached to an oxygen atom form an ether molecule.
(Ethers are discussed in Section 14.4 "Reactions That Form Alcohols".)
Thus, depending on conditions, one can prepare either alkenes or ethers by the dehydration of alcohols.
Note Both dehydration and hydration reactions occur continuously in cellular metabolism, with enzymes serving as catalysts and at a temperature of about 37°C.
(For more information about hydration reactions, see Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", Section 13.4 "Chemical Properties of Alkenes".)
The following reaction occurs in the Embden–Meyerhof pathway.
(For more information about metabolic reactions, see Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism".)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 709  Although the participating compounds are complex, the reaction is the same: elimination of water from the starting material.
The idea is that if you know the chemistry of a particular functional group, you know the chemistry of hundreds of different compounds.
Oxidation Primary and secondary alcohols are readily oxidized.
We saw earlier how methanol and ethanol are oxidized by liver enzymes to form aldehydes.
Because a variety of oxidizing agents can bring about oxidation, we can indicate an oxidizing agent without specifying a particular one by writing an equation with the symbol [O] above the arrow.
For example, we write the oxidation of ethanol—a primary alcohol—to form acetaldehyde— an aldehyde—as follows: We shall see (in Section 14.9 "Aldehydes and Ketones: Structure and Names") that aldehydes are even more easily oxidized than alcohols and yield carboxylic acids.
Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones.
The oxidation of isopropyl alcohol by potassium dichromate (K Cr O ) gives acetone, the simplest ketone: 2 2 7 Unlike aldehydes, ketones are relatively resistant to further oxidation (Section 14.9 "Aldehydes and Ketones: Structure and Names"), so no special precautions are required to isolate them as they form.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 710  Note that in oxidation of both primary (RCH OH) and secondary (R CHOH) alcohols, 2 2 two hydrogen atoms are removed from the alcohol molecule, one from the OH group and other from the carbon atom that bears the OH group.
Note These reactions can also be carried out in the laboratory with chemical oxidizing agents.
One such oxidizing agent is potassium dichromate.
The balanced equation (showing only the species involved in the reaction) in this case is as follows: Alcohol oxidation is important in living organisms.
Enzyme-controlled oxidation reactions provide the energy cells need to do useful work.
One step in the metabolism of carbohydrates involves the oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in isocitric acid to a ketone group: Note that the overall type of reaction is the same as that in the conversion of isopropyl alcohol to acetone.
(For more information on metabolic reactions, see Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism".)
Tertiary alcohols (R COH) are resistant to oxidation because the carbon atom that 3 carries the OH group does not have a hydrogen atom attached but is instead bonded to other carbon atoms.
The oxidation reactions we have described involve the formation of a carbon-to-oxygen double bond.
Thus, the carbon atom bearing the OH group must be able to release one of its attached atoms to form the double bond.
The carbon-to- hydrogen bonding is easily broken under oxidative conditions, but carbon-to-carbon bonds are not.
Therefore tertiary alcohols are not easily oxidized.
EXAMPLE 4 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 711  Write an equation for the oxidation of each alcohol.
Use [O] above the arrow to indicate an oxidizing agent.
If no reaction occurs, write “no reaction” after the arrow.
a. CH CH CH CH CH OH 3 2 2 2 2 b. c. Solution The first step is to recognize the class of each alcohol as primary, secondary, or tertiary.
1.
This alcohol has the OH group on a carbon atom that is attached to onlyone other carbon atom, so it is a primary alcohol.
Oxidation forms first an aldehyde and further oxidation forms a carboxylic acid.
2.
This alcohol has the OH group on a carbon atom that is attached to three other carbon atoms, so it is a tertiary alcohol.
No reaction occurs.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 712  3.
This alcohol has the OH group on a carbon atom that is attached to two other carbon atoms, so it is a secondary alcohol; oxidation gives a ketone.

14.6 Glycols and Glycerol LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe the structure and uses of some common polyhydric alcohols.
Alcohols with two OH groups on adjacent carbon atoms are commonly known as glycols.
The most important of these is 1,2-ethanediol (the common name is ethylene glycol), a sweet, colorless, somewhat viscous liquid.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 716  Another common glycol, 1,2-propanediol, is commonly called propylene glycol.
Its physical properties are quite similar to those of ethylene glycol.
Commonly called glycerol or glycerin, 1,2,3-propanetriol is the most important trihydroxy alcohol.
Like the two glycols, it is a sweet, syrupy liquid.
Glycerol is a product of the hydrolysis of fats and oils.
(For more information about fats and oils, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils".)
Ethylene glycol is the main ingredient in many antifreeze mixtures for automobile radiators.
The two OH groups lead to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
This results in a high boiling point—198°C; thus ethylene glycol does not boil away when it is used as an antifreeze.
It is also completely miscible with water.
A solution of 60% ethylene glycol in water freezes at −49°C (−56°F) and thus protects an automobile radiator down to that temperature.
Ethylene glycol is also used in the manufacture of polyester fiber and magnetic film used in tapes for recorders and computers.
To Your Health: Glycols and Human Health Ethylene glycol is quite toxic.
Because it is sweet, pets often lap up spills of leaked antifreeze from a garage floor or driveway.
Sometimes people, especially children, drink it.
As with methanol, its toxicity is due to a metabolite.
Liver enzymes oxidize ethylene glycol to oxalate ion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 717  In the kidneys, the oxalate ion combines with the calcium (Ca2+) ion, precipitating as calcium oxalate (CaC O ).
2 4 Ca2+(aq) + C O 2−(aq) → CaC O (s) 2 4 2 4 These crystals cause renal damage and can lead to kidney failure and death.
Although propylene glycol has physical properties much like those of ethylene glycol, its physiological properties are quite different.
Propylene glycol is essentially nontoxic, and it can be used as a solvent for drugs and as a moisturizing agent for foods.
Like other alcohols, propylene glycol is oxidized by liver enzymes.
In this case, however, the product is pyruvate ion, a normal intermediate in carbohydrate metabolism.
(For more information about metabolic reactions, seeChapter 20 "Energy Metabolism".)
Glycerol, a product of fat metabolism, is essentially nontoxic.

14.7 Phenols LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe the structure and uses of some phenols.
Compounds in which an OH group is attached directly to an aromatic ring are designated ArOH and called phenols.
Phenols differ from alcohols in that they are slightly acidic in water.
They react with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form salts.
ArOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → ArONa(aq) + H O 2 The parent compound, C H OH, is itself called phenol.
(An old name, emphasizing its 6 5 slight acidity, was carbolic acid.)
Phenol is a white crystalline compound that has a distinctive (“hospital smell”) odor.
To Your Health: Phenols and Us Phenols are widely used as antiseptics (substances that kill microorganisms on living tissue) and as disinfectants (substances intended to kill microorganisms on inanimate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 720  objects such as furniture or floors).
The first widely used antiseptic was phenol.
Joseph Lister used it for antiseptic surgery in 1867.
Phenol is toxic to humans, however, and can cause severe burns when applied to the skin.
In the bloodstream, it is a systemic poison—that is, one that is carried to and affects all parts of the body.
Its severe side effects led to searches for safer antiseptics, a number of which have been found.
One safer phenolic antiseptic is 4-hexylresorcinol (4-hexyl-1,3-dihydroxybenzene; resorcinol is the common name for 1,3-dihydroxybenzene, and 4-hexylresorcinol has a hexyl group on the fourth carbon atom of the resorcinol ring).
It is much more powerful than phenol as a germicide and has fewer undesirable side effects.
Indeed, it is safe enough to be used as the active ingredient in some mouthwashes and throat lozenges.
CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
How do phenols differ from alcohols in terms of structure and properties?

How do phenols differ in properties from aromatic hydrocarbons?

14.8 Ethers LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the structural difference between an alcohol and an ether that affects physical characteristics and reactivity of each.
2.
Name simple ethers.
3.
Describe the structure and uses of some ethers.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 724  With the general formula ROR′, an ether may be considered a derivative of water in which both hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups.
It may also be considered a derivative of an alcohol (ROH) in which the hydrogen atom of the OH group is been replaced by a second alkyl or aryl group: Simple ethers have simple common names, formed from the names of the groups attached to oxygen atom, followed by the generic name ether.
For example, CH –O– 3 CH CH CH is methyl propyl ether.
If both groups are the same, the group name should 2 2 3 be preceded by the prefix di-, as in dimethyl ether (CH –O–CH ) and diethyl ether 3 3 CH CH –O–CH CH .
3 2 2 3 Ether molecules have no hydrogen atom on the oxygen atom (that is, no OH group).
Therefore there is no intermolecular hydrogen bonding between ether molecules, and ethers therefore have quite low boiling points for a given molar mass.
Indeed, ethers have boiling points about the same as those of alkanes of comparable molar mass and much lower than those of the corresponding alcohols (Table 14.4 "Comparison of Boiling Points of Alkanes, Alcohols, and Ethers").

Consequently, an ether has about the same solubility in water as the alcohol that is isomeric with it.
For example, dimethyl ether and ethanol (both having the molecular formula C H O) are completely soluble in water, whereas diethyl 2 6 ether and 1-butanol (both C H O) are barely soluble in water (8 g/100 mL of water).

To Your Health: Ethers as General Anesthetics A general anesthetic acts on the brain to produce unconsciousness and a general insensitivity to feeling or pain.
Diethyl ether (CH CH OCH CH ) was the first general 3 2 2 3 anesthetic to be used.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 727  William Morton, a Boston dentist, introduced diethyl ether into surgical practice in 1846.
This painting shows an operation in Boston in 1846 in which diethyl ether was used as an anesthetic.
Inhalation of ether vapor produces unconsciousness by depressing the activity of the central nervous system.
Source: Painting of William Morton by Ernest Board, fromhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Morton_Ether_1846.jpg.
Diethyl ether is relatively safe because there is a fairly wide gap between the dose that produces an effective level of anesthesia and the lethal dose.
However, because it is highly flammable and has the added disadvantage of causing nausea, it has been replaced by newer inhalant anesthetics, including the fluorine-containing compounds halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane.
Unfortunately, the safety of these compounds for operating room personnel has been questioned.
For example, female operating room workers exposed to halothane suffer a higher rate of miscarriages than women in the general population.
These three modern, inhalant, halogen-containing, anesthetic compounds are less flammable than diethyl ether.

Explain.
3 2 2 2 ANSWERS Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 728  1.
Diethyl ether has no intermolecular hydrogen bonding because there is no OH group; 1- butanol has an OH and engages in intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
2.
Ethyl methyl ether (three carbon atoms, one oxygen atom) is more soluble in water than 1-butanol (four carbon atoms, one oxygen atom), even though both can engage in hydrogen bonding with water.
KEY TAKEAWAYS To give ethers common names, simply name the groups attached to the oxygen atom,  followed by the generic name ether.
If both groups are the same, the group name should be preceded by the prefix di-.
Ether molecules have no OH group and thus no intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Ether molecules have an oxygen atom and can engage in hydrogen bonding with water  molecules.
An ether molecule has about the same solubility in water as the alcohol that is isomeric with it.

14.9 Aldehydes and Ketones: Structure and Names LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Identify the general structure for an aldehyde and a ketone.
2.
Use common names to name aldehydes and ketones.
3.
Use the IUPAC system to name aldehydes and ketones.
The next functional group we consider, the carbonyl group, has a carbon-to-oxygen double bond.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 731  Carbonyl groups define two related families of organic compounds: the aldehydes and the ketones.
Note The carbonyl group is ubiquitous in biological compounds.
It is found in carbohydrates, fats, proteins, nucleic acids, hormones, and vitamins—organic compounds critical to living systems.
In a ketone, two carbon groups are attached to the carbonyl carbon atom.
The following general formulas, in which R represents an alkyl group and Ar stands for an aryl group, represent ketones.
In an aldehyde, at least one of the attached groups must be a hydrogen atom.
The following compounds are aldehydes: In condensed formulas, we use CHO to identify an aldehyde rather than COH, which might be confused with an alcohol.
This follows the general rule that in condensed structural formulas H comes after the atom it is attached to (usually C, N, or O).
The carbon-to-oxygen double bond is not shown but understood to be present.
Because they contain the same functional group, aldehydes and ketones share many common properties, but they still differ enough to warrant their classification into two families.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 732  Naming Aldehydes and Ketones Both common and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names are frequently used for aldehydes and ketones, with common names predominating for the lower homologs.
The common names of aldehydes are taken from the names of the acids into which the aldehydes can be converted by oxidation.
(For more information about carboxylic acids, see Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", Section 15.2 "Carboxylic Acids: Structures and Names" through Section 15.4 "Physical Properties of Carboxylic Acids".)
Note The stems for the common names of the first four aldehydes are as follows: 1 carbon atom: form- 2 carbon atoms: acet- 3 carbon atoms: propion- 4 carbon atoms: butyr- Because the carbonyl group in a ketone must be attached to two carbon groups, the simplest ketone has three carbon atoms.
It is widely known as acetone, a unique name unrelated to other common names for ketones.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 733  Generally, the common names of ketones consist of the names of the groups attached to the carbonyl group, followed by the word ketone.
(Note the similarity to the naming of ethers.)
Another name for acetone, then, is dimethyl ketone.
The ketone with four carbon atoms is ethyl methyl ketone.
EXAMPLE 6 Classify each compound as an aldehyde or a ketone.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 734  Solution 1.
This compound has the carbonyl group on an end carbon atom, so it is an aldehyde.
2.
This compound has the carbonyl group on an interior carbon atom, so it is a ketone.
Both alkyl groups are propyl groups.
The name is therefore dipropyl ketone.
3.
This compound has the carbonyl group between two alkyl groups, so it is a ketone.
One alkyl group has three carbon atoms and is attached by the middle carbon atom; it is an isopropyl group.
A group with one carbon atom is a methyl group.
The name is therefore isopropyl methyl ketone.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Classify each compound as an aldehyde or a ketone.
Give the common name for each ketone.
a. b. c. Here are some simple IUPAC rules for naming aldehydes and ketones: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 735  The stem names of aldehydes and ketones are derived from those of the parent alkanes, defined by the longest continuous chain (LCC) of carbon atoms that contains the functional group.
For an aldehyde, drop the -e from the alkane name and add the ending -al.
Methanal is the IUPAC name for formaldehyde, and ethanal is the name for acetaldehyde.
For a ketone, drop the -e from the alkane name and add the ending -one.
Propanone is the IUPAC name for acetone, and butanone is the name for ethyl methyl ketone.
To indicate the position of a substituent on an aldehyde, the carbonyl carbon atom is always considered to be C1; it is unnecessary to designate this group by number.
To indicate the position of a substituent on a ketone, number the chain in the manner that gives the carbonyl carbon atom the lowest possible number.
In cyclic ketones, it is understood that the carbonyl carbon atom is C1.
EXAMPLE 7 Give the IUPAC name for each compound.
1.
2.
3.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 736  Solution 1.There are five carbon atoms in the LCC.
The methyl group (CH ) is a substituent on the 3 second carbon atom of the chain; the aldehyde carbon atom is always C1.
The name is derived from pentane.
Dropping the -e and adding the ending -algives pentanal.
The methyl group on the second carbon atom makes the name 2-methylpentanal.
2.
There are five carbon atoms in the LCC.
The carbonyl carbon atom is C3, and there are methyl groups on C2 and C4.
The IUPAC name is 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone.
3.
There are six carbon atoms in the ring.
The compound is cyclohexanone.
No number is needed to indicate the position of the carbonyl group because all six carbon atoms are equivalent.

Explain why the boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than those of ethers and alkanes of similar molar masses but lower than those of comparable alcohols.
2.
Compare the solubilities in water of aldehydes and ketones of four or fewer carbon atoms with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols.
3.
Name the typical reactions take place with aldehydes and ketones.
4.
Describe some of the uses of common aldehydes and ketones.
The carbon-to-oxygen double bond is quite polar, more polar than a carbon-to-oxygen single bond.
The electronegative oxygen atom has a much greater attraction for the bonding electron pairs than does the carbon atom.
The carbon atom has a partial positive charge, and the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 742  In aldehydes and ketones, this charge separation leads to dipole-dipole interactions that are great enough to significantly affect the boiling points.
Table 14.5 "Boiling Points of Compounds Having Similar Molar Masses but Different Types of Intermolecular Forces" shows that the polar single bonds in ethers have little such effect, whereas hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules is even stronger.
Table 14.5 Boiling Points of Compounds Having Similar Molar Masses but Different Types of Intermolecular Forces Molar Type of Intermolecular Boiling Point Compound Family Mass Forces (°C) CH CH CH CH alkane 58 dispersion only –1 3 2 2 3 CH OCH CH ether 60 weak dipole 6 3 2 3 CH CH CHO aldehyde 58 strong dipole 49 3 2 CH CH CH OH alcohol 60 hydrogen bonding 97 3 2 2 Formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature.
Acetaldehyde boils at 20°C; in an open vessel, it boils away in a warm room.
Most other common aldehydes are liquids at room temperature.
Note Although the lower members of the homologous series have pungent odors, many higher aldehydes have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and artificial flavorings.
As for the ketones, acetone has a pleasant odor, but most of the higher homologs have rather bland odors.
The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group engages in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 743  The solubility of aldehydes is therefore about the same as that of alcohols and ethers.
Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone are soluble in water.
As the carbon chain increases in length, solubility in water decreases.
The borderline of solubility occurs at about four carbon atoms per oxygen atom.
All aldehydes and ketones are soluble in organic solvents and, in general, are less dense than water.
Oxidation of Aldehydes and Ketones Aldehydes and ketones are much alike in many of their reactions, owing to the presence of the carbonyl functional group in both.
They differ greatly, however, in one most important type of reaction: oxidation.
Aldehydes are readily oxidized to carboxylic acids, whereas ketones resist oxidation.
The aldehydes are, in fact, among the most easily oxidized of organic compounds.
They are oxidized by oxygen (O ) in air to carboxylic acids.
2 2RCHO + O → 2RCOOH 2 The ease of oxidation helps chemists identify aldehydes.
A sufficiently mild oxidizing agent can distinguish aldehydes not only from ketones but also from alcohols.
Tollens’ reagent, for example, is an alkaline solution of silver (Ag+) ion complexed with ammonia (NH ), which keeps the Ag+ ion in solution.
3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 744  H N—Ag+—NH 3 3 When Tollens’ reagent oxidizes an aldehyde, the Ag+ ion is reduced to free silver (Ag).
Deposited on a clean glass surface, the silver produces a mirror (Figure 14.5 "Aldehyde Reactions").
Ordinary ketones do not react with Tollens’ reagent.
Figure 14.5 Aldehyde Reactions A reaction related to the Tollens’ reaction is often used to silver mirrors.
These ornaments were silvered by such a reaction.
Glucose, a simple sugar with an aldehyde functional group, is used as the reducing agent.

Although ketones resist oxidation by ordinary laboratory oxidizing agents, they undergo combustion, as do aldehydes.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 745  Some Common Carbonyl Compounds Formaldehyde has an irritating odor.
Because of its reactivity, it is difficult to handle in the gaseous state.
For many uses, it is therefore dissolved in water and sold as a 37% to 40% aqueous solution called formalin.
Formaldehyde denatures proteins, rendering them insoluble in water and resistant to bacterial decay.
(For more information about proteins, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes", Section 18.4 "Proteins".)
For this reason, formalin is used in embalming solutions and in preserving biological specimens.
Aldehydes are the active components in many other familiar substances.
Large quantities of formaldehyde are used to make phenol-formaldehyde resins for gluing the wood sheets in plywood and as adhesives in other building materials.
Sometimes the formaldehyde escapes from the materials and causes health problems in some people.
While some people seem unaffected, others experience coughing, wheezing, eye irritation, and other symptoms.
Acetaldehyde is an extremely volatile, colorless liquid.
It is a starting material for the preparation of many other organic compounds.
Acetaldehyde is formed as a metabolite in the fermentation of sugars and in the detoxification of alcohol in the liver.
Aldehydes are the active components of many other familiar materials (Figure 14.6 "Some Interesting Aldehydes").
Note The odor of green leaves is due in part to a carbonyl compound, cis-3-hexenal, which with related compounds is used to impart a “green” herbal odor to shampoos and other products.
Figure 14.6 Some Interesting Aldehydes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 746  (a) Benzaldehyde is an oil found in almonds; (b) cinnamaldehyde is oil of cinnamon; (c) vanillin gives vanilla its flavor; (d) cis-3-hexenal provides an herbal odor; and (e)trans-2-cis-6-nonadienal gives a cucumber odor.
Acetone is the simplest and most important ketone.
Because it is miscible with water as well as with most organic solvents, its chief use is as an industrial solvent (for example, for paints and lacquers).
It is also the chief ingredient in some brands of nail polish remover.
To Your Health: Acetone in Blood, Urine, and Breath Acetone is formed in the human body as a by-product of lipid metabolism.
(For more information about metabolic reactions, see Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism".)
Normally, acetone does not accumulate to an appreciable extent because it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.
The normal concentration of acetone in the human body is less than 1 mg/100 mL of blood.
In certain disease states, such as uncontrolled diabetes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 747  mellitus, the acetone concentration rises to higher levels.
It is then excreted in the urine, where it is easily detected.
In severe cases, its odor can be noted on the breath.
Ketones are also the active components of other familiar substances, some of which are noted in the accompanying figure.
Some ketones have interesting properties: (a) Butter flavoring comes from 2,3- butanedione; (b) β-ionone is responsible for the odor of violets; (c) muscone is musk oil, an ingredient in perfumes; and (d) camphor is used in some insect repellents.
Note Certain steroid hormones have the ketone functional group as a part of their structure.
Two examples are progesterone, a hormone secreted by the ovaries that stimulates the growth of cells in the uterine wall and prepares it for attachment of a fertilized egg, and testosterone, the main male sex hormone.
These and other sex hormones affect our development and our lives in fundamental ways.
(For more information about the sex hormones, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.4 "Steroids".)

Identify thiols (mercaptans) by the presence of an SH group.
2.
The mild oxidation of thiols gives disulfides.
Because sulfur is in the same group (6A) of the periodic table as oxygen, the two elements have some similar properties.
We might expect sulfur to form organic compounds related to those of oxygen, and indeed it does.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 751  Thiols (also called mercaptans), which are sulfur analogs of alcohols, have the general formula RSH.
Methanethiol (also called methyl mercaptan), has the formula CH SH.
3 Ethanethiol (ethyl mercaptan) is the most common odorant for liquid propane (LP) gas.
The mild oxidation of thiols gives compounds called disulfides.
As we note in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04, the amino acids cysteine [HSCH CH(NH )COOH] and methionine [CH SCH CH CH(NH )COOH] 2 2 3 2 2 2 contain sulfur atoms, as do all proteins that contain these amino acids.
Disulfide linkages (–S–S–) between protein chains are extremely important in protein structure.
Thioethers, which are sulfur analogs of ethers, have the form general formula RSR′.
An example is dimethylsulfide (CH SCH ), which is responsible for the sometimes 3 3 unpleasant odor of cooking cabbage and related vegetables.
Note that methionine has a thioether functional group.
Career Focus: Paramedic Paramedics are highly trained experts at providing emergency medical treatment.
Their critical duties often include rescue work and emergency medical procedures in a wide variety of settings, sometimes under extremely harsh and difficult conditions.
Like other science-based professions, their work requires knowledge, ingenuity, and complex thinking, as well as a great deal of technical skill.
The recommended courses for preparation in this field include anatomy, physiology, medical terminology, and—not surprisingly—chemistry.
An understanding of basic principles of organic chemistry, for example, is useful when paramedics have to deal with such traumas as burns from fuel (hydrocarbons) or solvent (alcohols, ethers, esters, and so on) fires and alcohol and drug overdoses.
To become a paramedic requires 2–4 y of training and usually includes a stint as an emergency medical technician (EMT).
An EMT provides basic care, can administer certain medications and treatments, such as oxygen for respiratory problems and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 752  epinephrine (adrenalin) for allergic reactions, and has some knowledge of common medical conditions.
A paramedic, in contrast, must have extensive knowledge of common medical problems and be trained to administer a wide variety of emergency drugs.
Paramedics usually work under the direction of a medical doctor with a title such as “medical director.” Some paramedics are employed by fire departments and may work from a fire engine that carries medical equipment as well as fire-fighting gear.
Some work from hospital-sponsored ambulances and continue to care for their patients after reaching the hospital emergency room.
Still other paramedics work for a government department responsible for emergency health care in a specific geographical area.
Finally, some work for private companies that contract to provide service for a government body.
An experienced paramedic has a broad range of employment options, including training for mountain or ocean rescue, working with police department special weapons and tactics (SWAT) teams, or working in isolated settings such as on oil rigs.
With their expertise at treating and stabilizing patients before quickly moving them to a hospital, paramedics often provide the first critical steps in saving an endangered life.
The following quotation, inscribed on the Arlington National Cemetery headstone of Army Lieutenant R. Adams Cowley, who is often called the “father” of shock trauma medicine, serves as the motto for many paramedic units: “Next to creating a life the finest thing a man can do is save one.” —Abraham Lincoln CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.

(CH ) CSH 3 3 14.12 End-of-Chapter Material Chapter Summary To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the following bold terms in the summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.
A functional group is any atom or atom group that confers characteristic properties to a family of compounds.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 754  The hydroxyl group (OH) is the functional group of the alcohols.
The alcohols are represented by the general formula ROH.
Alcohols are derived from alkanes by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms by an OH group.
A primary (1°) alcohol (RCH OH) has the OH group on a carbon atom attached to one other carbon atom; 2 a secondary (2°) alcohol (R CHOH) has the OH group on a carbon atom attached to 2 two other carbon atoms; and a tertiary (3°) alcohol (R COH) has the OH group on a 3 carbon atom attached to three other carbon atoms.
The ability to engage in hydrogen bonding greatly increases the boiling points of alcohols compared to hydrocarbons of comparable molar mass.
Alcohols can also engage in hydrogen bonding with water molecules, and those with up to about four carbon atoms are soluble in water.
Many alcohols can be synthesized by the hydration of alkenes.
Common alcohols include methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol.
Methanol is quite poisonous.
It can cause blindness or even death.
Ethanol can be prepared from ethylene or made by fermentation.
It is the “alcohol” in alcoholic beverages.
On occasion, people drink methanol by mistake, thinking it is the beverage alcohol.
On occasion, unscrupulous bootleggers, sell methanol to unsuspecting customers.
In either case, the results are often tragic.
Rubbing alcohol is usually a 70% aqueous solution of isopropyl alcohol.
Ethanol is also used in some rubbing alcohol formulations.
When water is removed from an alcohol in a dehydration step, the result is either an alkene or an ether, depending on the reaction conditions.
Primary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones.
Tertiary alcohols are not easily oxidized.
Alcohols containing two OH groups on adjacent carbon atoms are called glycols.
Phenols (ArOH) are compounds having the OH group attached to an aromatic ring.
Ethers (ROR′, ROAr, ArOAr) are compounds in which an oxygen atom is joined to two organic groups.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 755  The carbonyl group, a carbon-to-oxygen double bond, is the defining feature ofaldehydes and ketones.
In aldehydes at least one bond on the carbonyl group is a carbon-to-hydrogen bond; in ketones, both available bonds on the carbonyl carbon atom are carbon-to-carbon bonds.
Aldehydes are synthesized by the oxidation of primary alcohols.
The aldehyde can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid.
Ketones are prepared by the oxidation of secondary alcohols.
Mild oxidizing agents oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic acids.
Ketones are not oxidized by these reagents.
A thiol is a compound with an SH functional group.

When water is added to ethylene in the presence of an acid catalyst, only one product— ethanol—is possible.
However, when water is added to propylene, two products are possible—1-propanol and 2-propanol—but only 2-propanol is formed.
In 1870, the Russian chemist Vladimir V. Markovnikov proposed a rule to predict the products of such reactions: Considering water to be HOH, the hydrogen atom of water goes on the carbon atom (of the two involved in the double bond) that has the most hydrogen Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 759  atoms already bonded to it.

27. sulfide, amino, and carboxylic acid Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 764  Chapter 15 Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives Opening Essay Organic acids have been known for ages.
Prehistoric people likely made acetic acid when their fermentation reactions went awry and produced vinegar instead of wine.
The Sumerians (2900–1800 BCE) used vinegar as a condiment, a preservative, an antibiotic, and a detergent.
Citric acid was discovered by an Islamic alchemist, Jabir Ibn Hayyan (also known as Geber), in the 8th century, and crystalline citric acid was first isolated from lemon juice in 1784 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.
Medieval scholars in Europe were aware that the crisp, tart flavor of citrus fruits is caused by citric acid.
Naturalists of the 17th century knew that the sting of a red ant’s bite was due to an organic acid that the ant injected into the wound.
The acetic acid of vinegar, the formic acid of red ants, and the citric acid of fruits all belong to the same family of compounds—carboxylic acids.
Soaps are salts of long-chain carboxylic acids.
(For more information about soaps, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils".)
Prehistoric people also knew about organic bases—by smell if not by name; amines are the organic bases produced when animal tissue decays.
The organic compounds that we consider in this chapter are organic acids and bases.
We will also consider two derivatives of carboxylic acids: esters and amides.
An esteris derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.
Fats and oils are esters, as are many important fragrances and flavors.
(For more information about fats and oils, seeChapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils".)
An amide is derived from a carboxylic acid and either ammonia or an amine.
Proteins, often called “the stuff of life,” are polyamides.
(For more information about proteins, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes", Section 18.4 "Proteins".)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 765  15.1 Functional Groups of the Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Identify the general structure for a carboxylic acid, an ester, an amine, and an amide.
2.
Identify the functional group for a carboxylic acid, an ester, an amine, and an amide.
We introduced the carbonyl group (C=O)—the functional group of aldehydes and ketones—in Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen".
The carbonyl group is also found in carboxylic acids, esters, and amides.
However, in these compounds, the carbonyl group is only part of the functional group.
A carboxylic acid is an organic compound that has a carboxyl group.
The carboxyl group is a functional group that contains a carbon–oxygen double bond and an OH group also attached to the same carbon atom, but it has characteristic properties of its own.
As with aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acid formulas can be written to show the carbon-to- oxygen double bond explicitly, or the carboxyl group can be written in condensed form on one line.
In general, carboxylic acids are represented by the formula RCOOH, where R is a hydrocarbon group.
Esters are represented by the formula RCOOR’, where R and R’ are hydrocarbon groups.
The ester, which is organic compound derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in which the OH of the acid is replaced by an OR group, looks somewhat like an ether and also somewhat like a carboxylic acid.
Even so, compounds in this group react neither like carboxylic acids nor like ethers; they make up a distinctive family.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 766  Unlike ethers, esters have a carbonyl group.
Unlike carboxylic acids, esters have no acidic hydrogen atom; they have a hydrocarbon group in its place.
An amine is a compound derived from ammonia (NH ); it has one, two, or all three of 3 the hydrogen atoms of NH replaced by an alkyl (or an aryl) group.
Like NH , amines 3 3 are weak bases.
The functional group of an amine is a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons and with one, two, or three alkyl or aryl groups attached.
The amide functional group has a carbonyl group joined to a nitrogen atom from ammonia or an amine.
The properties of the amide functional group differ from those of the simple carbonyl group, NH , and amines.
3 Esters and amides are considered to be derivatives of carboxylic acids because the OH in the carboxyl group is replaced with another group.
These functional groups are listed in Table 15.1 "Organic Acids, Bases, and Acid Derivatives", along with an example (identified by common and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry [IUPAC] names) for each type of compound.
Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 767  Most familiar carboxylic acids have an even number of carbon atoms.
As we shall see in Chapter 17 "Lipids", these acids—called fatty acids—are synthesized in nature by adding two carbon atoms at a time.

Name carboxylic acids with common names.
2.
Name carboxylic acids according to IUPAC nomenclature.
Carboxylic acids occur widely in nature, often combined with alcohols or other functional groups, as in fats, oils, and waxes.
They are components of many foods, medicines, and household products (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s02_f01).
Not surprisingly, many of them are best known by common names based on Latin and Greek words that describe their source.
What you learn in this chapter about the chemistry of carboxylic acids will help you understand biochemistry (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch16 through http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch20).
The simplest carboxylic acid, formic acid (HCOOH), was first obtained by the distillation of ants (Latin formica, meaning “ant”).
The bites of some ants inject formic acid, and the stings of wasps and bees contain formic acid (as well as other poisonous materials).
The next higher homolog is acetic acid, which is made by fermenting cider and honey in the presence of oxygen.
This fermentation produces vinegar, a solution containing 4%– Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 771  10% acetic acid, plus a number of other compounds that add to its flavor.
Acetic acid is probably the most familiar weak acid used in educational and industrial chemistry laboratories.
Note Pure acetic acid solidifies at 16.6°C, only slightly below normal room temperature.
In the poorly heated laboratories of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in northern North America and Europe, acetic acid often “froze” on the storage shelf.
For that reason, pure acetic acid (sometimes called concentrated acetic acid) came to be known as glacial acetic acid, a name that survives to this day.
The third homolog, propionic acid (CH CH COOH), is seldom encountered in everyday 3 2 life.
The fourth homolog, butyric acid (CH CH CH COOH), is one of the most foul- 3 2 2 smelling substances imaginable.
It is found in rancid butter and is one of the ingredients of body odor.
By recognizing extremely small amounts of this and other chemicals, bloodhounds are able to track fugitives.
Models of the first four carboxylic acids are shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s02_f02.
Figure 15.2 Ball-and-Stick Models of Carboxylic Acids Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 772  Carboxylic acids feature a carbon atom doubly bonded to an oxygen atom and also joined to an OH group.
The four acids illustrated here are formic acid (a), acetic acid (b), propionic acid (c), and butyric acid (d).
The acid with the carboxyl group attached directly to a benzene ring is called benzoic acid (C H COOH).
6 5 The common names of carboxylic acids use Greek letters (α, β, γ, δ, and so forth), not numbers, to designate the position of substituent groups in acids.
These letters refer to the position of the carbon atom in relation to the carboxyl carbon atom.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 773  In the nomenclature system of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the parent hydrocarbon is the one that corresponds to the longest continuous chain (LCC) containing the carboxyl group.
The -e ending of the parent alkane is replaced by the suffix -oic and the word acid.
For example, the carboxylic acid derived from pentane is pentanoic acid (CH CH CH CH COOH).
As with aldehydes, the 3 2 2 2 carboxyl carbon atom is counted first; numbers are used to indicate any substituted carbon atoms in the parent chain.
Note Greek letters are used with common names; numbers are used with IUPAC names.

Describe the preparation of carboxylic acids.
As we noted in Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen", the oxidation of aldehydes or primary alcohols forms carboxylic acids: In the presence of an oxidizing agent, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde, which is then oxidized to acetic acid.
This process also occurs in the liver, where enzymes catalyze the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid.
Acetic acid can be further oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

Compare the boiling points of carboxylic acids with alcohols of similar molar mass.
2.
Compare the solubilities of carboxylic acids in water with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols in water.
Many carboxylic acids are colorless liquids with disagreeable odors.
The carboxylic acids with 5 to 10 carbon atoms all have “goaty” odors (explaining the odor of Limburger cheese).
These acids are also produced by the action of skin bacteria on human sebum (skin oils), which accounts for the odor of poorly ventilated locker rooms.
The acids with more than 10 carbon atoms are waxlike solids, and their odor diminishes with increasing molar mass and resultant decreasing volatility.
Carboxylic acids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.
They therefore have high boiling points compared to other substances of comparable molar mass.
The carboxyl group readily engages in hydrogen bonding with water molecules (Figure 15.3 "Hydrogen Bonding between an Acetic Acid Molecule and Water Molecules").
The acids with one to four carbon atoms are completely miscible with water.
Solubility decreases as the carbon chain length increases because dipole forces become less important and dispersion forces become more predominant.
Hexanoic acid [CH (CH ) COOH] is barely soluble in water (about 1.0 g/100 g of water).
Palmitic acid 3 2 4 [CH (CH ) COOH], with its large nonpolar hydrocarbon component, is essentially 3 2 14 insoluble in water.
The carboxylic acids generally are soluble in such organic solvents as ethanol, toluene, and diethyl ether.
Figure 15.3 Hydrogen Bonding between an Acetic Acid Molecule and Water Molecules Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 781  Carboxylic acids of low molar mass are quite soluble in water.
Table 15.2 "Physical Constants of Carboxylic Acids" lists some physical properties for selected carboxylic acids.
The first six are homologs.
Notice that the boiling points increase with increasing molar mass, but the melting points show no regular pattern.

3 2 2 3 15.5 Chemical Properties of Carboxylic Acids: Ionization and Neutralization LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Name the typical reactions that take place with carboxylic acids.
2.
Describe how carboxylic acids react with basic compounds.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 784  Water-soluble carboxylic acids ionize slightly in water to form moderately acidic solutions.
Their aqueous solutions exhibit the typical properties of acids, such as changing litmus from blue to red.
Note The anion formed when a carboxylic acid dissociates is called the carboxylateanion (RCOO−).
Whether soluble in water or not, carboxylic acids react with aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium carbonate (Na CO ), and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO ) to 2 3 3 form salts: RCOOH + NaOH(aq) → RCOO−Na+(aq) + H2O2 RCOOH + Na CO (aq) → 2RCOO−Na+(aq) + H O + CO (g) 2 3 2 2 RCOOH + NaHCO (aq) → RCOO−Na+(aq) + H O + CO (g) 3 2 2 In these reactions, the carboxylic acids act like inorganic acids: they neutralize basic compounds.
With solutions of carbonate (CO ) and bicarbonate (HCO ) ions, they also 3 3 form carbon dioxide gas.
Carboxylic acid salts are named in the same manner as inorganic salts: the name of the cation is followed by the name of the organic anion.
The name of the anion is obtained by dropping the -ic ending of the acid name and replacing it with the suffix -ate.
This rule applies whether we are using common names or International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names: Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 785  The salts of long-chain carboxylic acids are called soaps.
We discuss the chemistry of soaps further in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch17, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch17_s02.

Identify the general structure for an ester.
2.
Use common names to name esters.
3.
Name esters according to the IUPAC system.
Esters have the general formula RCOOR′, where R may be a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, or an aryl group, and R′ may be an alkyl group or an aryl group but not a hydrogen atom.
(If it were hydrogen atom, the compound would be a carboxylic acid.
)Figure 15.4 "The Structure of Esters" shows models for two common esters.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 790  Figure 15.4 The Structure of Esters Esters feature a carbon-to-oxygen double bond that is also singly bonded to a second oxygen atom, which is then joined to an alkyl or an aryl group.
The esters shown here are ethyl acetate (a) and methyl butyrate (b).
Esters occur widely in nature.
Unlike carboxylic acids, esters generally have pleasant odors and are often responsible for the characteristic fragrances of fruits and flowers.
Once a flower or fruit has been chemically analyzed, flavor chemists can attempt to duplicate the natural odor or taste.
Both natural and synthetic esters are used in perfumes and as flavoring agents.
Note Fats and vegetable oils are esters of long-chain fatty acids and glycerol.
Esters of phosphoric acid are of the utmost importance to life.
(For more information about Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 791  fats/oils and esters, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils", andSection 15.10 "Esters of Phosphoric Acid", respectively.)
Names of Esters Although esters are covalent compounds and salts are ionic, esters are named in a manner similar to that used for naming salts.
The group name of the alkyl or aryl portion is given first and is followed by the name of the acid portion.
In both common and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature, the - ic ending of the parent acid is replaced by the suffix -ate (Table 15.3 "Nomenclature of Esters").

a. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 792  b.
Solution a.
The alkyl group attached directly to the oxygen atom is a butyl group (in green).
The part of the molecule derived from the carboxylic acid (in red) has three carbon atoms.
It is called propionate (common) or propanoate (IUPAC).
The ester is therefore butyl propionate or butyl propanoate.
2.
An alkyl group (in green) is attached directly to the oxygen atom by its middle carbon atom; it is an isopropyl group.
The part derived from the acid (that is, the benzene ring and the carbonyl group, in red) is benzoate.
The ester is therefore isopropyl benzoate (both the common name and the IUPAC name).

Compare the boiling points of esters with alcohols of similar molar mass.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 797  2.
Compare the solubilities of esters in water with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols in water.
Ester molecules are polar but have no hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen atom.
They are therefore incapable of engaging in intermolecular hydrogen bonding with one another and thus have considerably lower boiling points than their isomeric carboxylic acids counterparts.
Because ester molecules can engage in hydrogen bonding with water molecules, however, esters of low molar mass are somewhat soluble in water.
Borderline solubility occurs in those molecules that have three to five carbon atoms.
http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s07_t01lists the physical properties of some common esters.
Note Esters are common solvents.
Ethyl acetate is used to extract organic solutes from aqueous solutions—for example, to remove caffeine from coffee.
It also is used to remove nail polish and paint.
Cellulose nitrate is dissolved in ethyl acetate and butyl acetate to form lacquers.
The solvent evaporates as the lacquer “dries,” leaving a thin film on the surface.
High boiling esters are used as softeners (plasticizers) for brittle plastics.

3 2 3 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 800  15.8 Preparation of Esters LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Identify and describe the substances from which most esters are prepared.
Some esters can be prepared by esterification, a reaction in which a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, heated in the presence of a mineral acid catalyst, form an ester and water: The reaction is reversible.
As a specific example of an esterification reaction, butyl acetate can be made from acetic acid and 1-butanol.
A Closer Look: Condensation Polymers A commercially important esterification reaction is condensation polymerization, in which a reaction occurs between a dicarboxylic acid and a dihydric alcohol (diol), with the elimination of water.
Such a reaction yields an ester that contains a free (unreacted) carboxyl group at one end and a free alcohol group at the other end.
Further condensation reactions then occur, producing polyester polymers.
The most important polyester, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is made from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol monomers: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 801  Polyester molecules make excellent fibers and are used in many fabrics.
A knitted polyester tube, which is biologically inert, can be used in surgery to repair or replace diseased sections of blood vessels.
PET is used to make bottles for soda pop and other beverages.
It is also formed into films called Mylar.
When magnetically coated, Mylar tape is used in audio- and videocassettes.
Synthetic arteries can be made from PET, polytetrafluoroethylene, and other polymers.

Describe the typical reaction that takes place with esters.
2.
Identify the products of an acidic hydrolysis of an ester.
3.
Identify the products of a basic hydrolysis of an ester.
Esters are neutral compounds, unlike the acids from which they are formed.
In typical reactions, the alkoxy (OR′) group of an ester is replaced by another group.
One such reaction is hydrolysis, literally “splitting with water.” The hydrolysis of esters is catalyzed by either an acid or a base.
Acidic hydrolysis is simply the reverse of esterification.
The ester is heated with a large excess of water containing a strong-acid catalyst.
Like esterification, the reaction is reversible and does not go to completion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 804  As a specific example, butyl acetate and water react to form acetic acid and 1-butanol.
The reaction is reversible and does not go to completion.
EXAMPLE 7 Write an equation for the acidic hydrolysis of ethyl butyrate (CH CH CH COOCH CH ) and 3 2 2 2 3 name the products.
Solution Remember that in acidic hydrolysis, water (HOH) splits the ester bond.
The H of HOH joins to the oxygen atom in the OR part of the original ester, and the OH of HOH joins to the carbonyl carbon atom: The products are butyric acid (butanoic acid) and ethanol.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
Write an equation for the acidic hydrolysis of methyl butanoate and name the products.
When a base (such as sodium hydroxide [NaOH] or potassium hydroxide [KOH]) is used to hydrolyze an ester, the products are a carboxylate salt and an alcohol.
Because soaps are prepared by the alkaline hydrolysis of fats and oils, alkaline hydrolysis of esters is called saponification (Latin sapon, meaning “soap,” and facere, meaning “to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 805  make”).
In a saponification reaction, the base is a reactant, not simply a catalyst.
The reaction goes to completion: As a specific example, ethyl acetate and NaOH react to form sodium acetate and ethanol: EXAMPLE 8 Write an equation for the hydrolysis of methyl benzoate in a potassium hydroxide solution.
Solution In basic hydrolysis, the molecule of the base splits the ester linkage.
The acid portion of the ester ends up as the salt of the acid (in this case, the potassium salt).
The alcohol portion of the ester ends up as the free alcohol.

Describe phosphate esters.
2.
Understand why phosphate esters are important in living cells.
Just as carboxylic acids do, inorganic acids such as nitric acid (HNO ), sulfuric acid 3 (H SO ), and phosphoric acid (H PO ) also form esters.
The esters of phosphoric acid 2 4 3 4 are especially important in biochemistry.
A phosphoric acid molecule can form a monoalkyl, a dialkyl, or a trialkyl ester by reaction with one, two, or three molecules of an alcohol.
Esters of pyrophosphoric acid and triphosphoric acid are also important in biochemistry.
Esters of these acids are present in every plant and animal cell.
They are biochemical intermediates in the transformation of food into usable energy.
The bonds between phosphate units in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are called phosphoanhydride bonds.
These are high-energy bonds that store energy from the metabolism of foods.
Hydrolysis of ATP releases energy as it is needed for biochemical processes (for instance, for muscle contraction).
Phosphate esters are also important structural constituents of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 809  phospholipids and nucleic acids.
(For more information about phospholipids and nucleic acids, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.3 "Membranes and Membrane Lipids", and Chapter 19 "Nucleic Acids", respectively.)
Note The explosive nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) is an ester formed from glycerol and nitric acid.
It is used in medicine to relieve chest pain in heart disease.

Identify the functional group for amines.
Determine the structural feature that classifies amines as primary, secondary, or tertiary.
Use nomenclature systems to name amines.
Amines are classified according to the number of carbon atoms bonded directly to the nitrogen atom.
A primary (1°) amine has one alkyl (or aryl) group on the nitrogen atom, a secondary (2°) amine has two, and a tertiary (3°) amine has three (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s11_f01).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 812  Figure 15.5 The Structure of Amines Compared to Water, an Alcohol, and an Ether Note To classify alcohols, we look at the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon atom bearing the OH group, not the oxygen atom itself.
Thus, although isopropylamine looks similar to isopropyl alcohol, the former is a primary amine, while the latter is a secondary alcohol.
The common names for simple aliphatic amines consist of an alphabetic list of alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, followed by the suffix -amine.
(Systematic names are often used by some chemists.)
The amino group (NH ) is named as a substituent in 2 more complicated amines, such as those that incorporate other functional groups or in which the alkyl groups cannot be simply named.

There are two methyl groups and one ethyl group on the nitrogen atom.
The compound is ethyldimethylamine, a tertiary amine.
3.
There are two ethyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom; the amine is secondary, so the compound is diethylamine.

Explain why the boiling points of primary and secondary amines are higher than those of alkanes or ethers of similar molar mass but are lower than those of alcohols.
2.
Compare the boiling points of tertiary amines with alcohols, alkanes, and ethers of similar molar mass.
3.
Compare the solubilities in water of amines of five or fewer carbon atoms with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols in water.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 823  Primary and secondary amines have hydrogen atoms bonded to an nitrogen atom and are therefore capable of hydrogen bonding (part (a) of Figure 15.6 "Hydrogen Bonding"), although not as strongly as alcohol molecules (which have hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom, which is more electronegative than nitrogen).
These amines boil at higher temperatures than alkanes but at lower temperatures than alcohols of comparable molar mass.
For example, compare the boiling point of methylamine (CH NH ; −6°C) with those of ethane (CH CH ; −89°C) and methanol (CH OH; 65°C).
3 2 3 3 3 Tertiary amines have no hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom and so cannot participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
They have boiling points comparable to those of ethers (Table 15.5 "Physical Properties of Some Amines and Comparable Oxygen-Containing Compounds").

Amines of low molar mass are quite soluble in water; the borderline of solubility in water is at five or six carbon atoms.
To Your Health: Amines in Death and Life Amines have “interesting” odors.
The simple ones smell very much like ammonia.
Higher aliphatic amines smell like decaying fish.
Or perhaps we should put it the other way around: Decaying fish give off odorous amines.
The stench of rotting fish is due in part to two diamines: putrescine and cadaverine.
They arise from the decarboxylation of ornithine and lysine, respectively, amino acids that are found in animal cells.
(For more information about lysine, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes", Section 18.1 "Properties of Amino Acids".)
Aromatic amines generally are quite toxic.
They are readily absorbed through the skin, and workers must exercise caution when handling these compounds.
Several aromatic amines, including β-naphthylamine, are potent carcinogens.

Name the typical reactions that take place with amines.
2.
Describe heterocyclic amines.
Recall that ammonia (NH ) acts as a base because the nitrogen atom has a lone pair of 3 electrons that can accept a proton.
Amines also have a lone electron pair on their nitrogen atoms and can accept a proton from water to form substituted ammonium (NH +) ions and hydroxide (OH−) ions: 4 As a specific example, methylamine reacts with water to form the methylammonium ion and the OH− ion.
Nearly all amines, including those that are not very soluble in water, will react with strong acids to form salts soluble in water.
Amine salts are named like other salts: the name of the cation is followed by the name of the anion.
EXAMPLE 15 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 829  What are the formulas of the acid and base that react to form [CH NH CH CH ]+CH COO−?
3 2 2 3 3 Solution The cation has two groups—methyl and ethyl—attached to the nitrogen atom.
It comes from ethylmethylamine (CH NHCH CH ).
The anion is the acetate ion.
It comes from 3 2 3 acetic acid (CH COOH).
3 SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE What are the formulas of the acid and base that react to form (CH CH CH ) NH+I−?
3 2 2 3 To Your Health: Amine Salts as Drugs Salts of aniline are properly named as anilinium compounds, but an older system, still in use for naming drugs, identifies the salt of aniline and hydrochloric acid as “aniline hydrochloride.” These compounds are ionic—they are salts—and the properties of the compounds (solubility, for example) are those characteristic of salts.
Many drugs that are amines are converted to hydrochloride salts to increase their solubility in aqueous solution.
Heterocyclic Amines Looking back at the various cyclic hydrocarbons introduced in Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons" and Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", we see that all the atoms in the rings of these compounds are carbon atoms.
In other cyclic compounds, called heterocyclic compounds (Greek heteros, meaning “other”), nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or some other atom is incorporated in the ring.
Many heterocyclic compounds are important in medicine and biochemistry.
Some compose part of the structure of the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 830  nucleic acids, which in turn compose the genetic material of cells and direct protein synthesis.
(For more information about nucleic acids, see Chapter 19 "Nucleic Acids".)
Many heterocyclic amines occur naturally in plants.
Like other amines, these compounds are basic.
Such a compound is an alkaloid, a name that means “like alkalis.” Many alkaloids are physiologically active, including the familiar drugs caffeine, nicotine, and cocaine.
To Your Health: Three Well-Known Alkaloids Caffeine is a stimulant found in coffee, tea, and some soft drinks.
Its mechanism of action is not well understood, but it is thought to block the activity of adenosine, a heterocyclic base that acts as a neurotransmitter, a substance that carries messages across a tiny gap (synapse) from one nerve cell (neuron) to another cell.
The effective dose of caffeine is about 200 mg, corresponding to about two cups of strong coffee or tea.
Nicotine acts as a stimulant by a different mechanism; it probably mimics the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
People ingest this drug by smoking or chewing tobacco.
Its stimulant effect seems transient, as this initial response is followed by depression.
Nicotine is highly toxic to animals.
It is especially deadly when injected; the lethal dose for a human is estimated to be about 50 mg. Nicotine has also been used in agriculture as a contact insecticide.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 831  Cocaine acts as a stimulant by preventing nerve cells from taking up dopamine, another neurotransmitter, from the synapse.
High levels of dopamine are therefore available to stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain.
The enhancement of dopamine action is thought to be responsible for cocaine’s “high” and its addictive properties.
After the binge, dopamine is depleted in less than an hour.
This leaves the user in a pleasureless state and (often) craving more cocaine.
Cocaine is used as the salt cocaine hydrochloride and in the form of broken lumps of the free (unneutralized) base, which is called crack cocaine.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 832  Because it is soluble in water, cocaine hydrochloride is readily absorbed through the watery mucous membranes of the nose when it is snorted.
Crack cocaine is more volatile than cocaine hydrochloride.
It vaporizes at the temperature of a burning cigarette.
When smoked, cocaine reaches the brain in 15 s. CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
Explain the basicity of amines.
2.
Contrast the physical properties of amines with those of alcohols and alkanes.
3.
What is a heterocyclic compound?
ANSWERS 1.
Amines have a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom and can thus act as proton acceptors (bases).
2.
The solubilities of amines are similar to those of alcohols; the boiling points of primary and secondary amines are similar to those of alcohols; the boiling points of tertiary amines, which cannot engage in hydrogen bonding because they do not have a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen atom, are comparable to those of alkanes.
3.
Heterocyclic compounds are ring compounds with atoms other than carbon atoms in the ring.
KEY TAKEAWAYS Amines are bases; they react with acids to form salts.

3.
Names amides with common names.
4.

The amide functional group has an nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl carbon atom.
If the two remaining bonds on the nitrogen atom are attached to hydrogen atoms, the compound is a simple amide.
If one or both of the two remaining bonds on the atom are attached to alkyl or aryl groups, the compound is a substituted amide.
Note The carbonyl carbon-to-nitrogen bond is called an amide linkage.
This bond is quite stable and is found in the repeating units of protein molecules, where it is called a peptide linkage.
(For more about peptide linkages, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s03.)
Simple amides are named as derivatives of carboxylic acids.
The -ic ending of the common name or the -oic ending of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name of the carboxylic acid is replaced with the suffix -amide.

Compare the boiling points of amides with alcohols of similar molar mass.
2.
Compare the solubilities in water of amides of five or fewer carbon atoms with the solubilities of comparable alkanes and alcohols in water.
With the exception of formamide (HCONH ), which is a liquid, all simple amides are 2 solids (Table 15.6 "Physical Constants of Some Unsubstituted Amides").
The lower members of the series are soluble in water, with borderline solubility occurring in those that have five or six carbon atoms.
Like the esters, solutions of amides in water usually are neutral—neither acidic nor basic.

These characteristics and their solubility in water result from the polar nature of the amide group and hydrogen bonding (Figure 15.7 "Hydrogen Bonding in Amides").
(Similar hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in determining the structure and properties of proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], ribonucleic acid [RNA], and other giant molecules so important to life processes.

Describe the preparation procedure for amides.
The addition of ammonia (NH ) to a carboxylic acid forms an amide, but the reaction is 3 very slow in the laboratory at room temperature.
Water molecules are split out, and a bond is formed between the nitrogen atom and the carbonyl carbon atom.
In living cells, amide formation is catalyzed by enzymes.
Proteins are polyamides; they are formed by joining amino acids into long chains.
In proteins, the amide functional group is called a peptide bond.
(For more information about proteins, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes", Section 18.4 "Proteins".)
Polyamides Just as the reaction of a diol and a diacid forms a polyester (Section 15.8 "Preparation of Esters"), the reaction of a diacid and a diamine yields a polyamide.
The two difunctional monomers often employed are adipic acid and 1,6-hexanediamine.
The monomers condense by splitting out water to form a new product, which is still difunctional and thus can react further to yield a polyamide polymer.
Some polyamides are known as nylons.
Nylons are among the most widely used synthetic fibers—for example, they are used in ropes, sails, carpets, clothing, tires, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 844  brushes, and parachutes.
They also can be molded into blocks for use in electrical equipment, gears, bearings, and valves.

Identify the typical reaction that amides undergo.
Generally, amides resist hydrolysis in plain water, even after prolonged heating.
In the presence of added acid or base, however, hydrolysis proceeds at a moderate rate.
In living cells, amide hydrolysis is catalyzed by enzymes.
Amide hydrolysis is illustrated in the following example: Note Hydrolysis of an amide in acid solution actually gives a carboxylic acid and the salt of ammonia or an amine (the ammonia or amine initially formed is neutralized by the acid).
Basic hydrolysis gives a salt of the carboxylic acid and ammonia or an amine.
EXAMPLE 17 Write the equation for the hydrolysis of each compound.
a. butyramide b. benzamide Solution a.
The hydrolysis of a simple amide produces an organic acid and ammonia.
Butyramide thus yields butyric acid and ammonia.

The athletic trainer’s role is to recognize, evaluate, and provide immediate care for athletic injuries; prevent athletic injuries by taping, bandaging, and bracing vulnerable body parts; make referrals to medical doctors when necessary; and rehabilitate injured athletes.
Athletic trainers work in high schools, colleges, and other organizations where athletics programs are found.
Athletic trainers usually have a degree from an accredited athletic training program whose curriculum includes such basic science courses as biology, chemistry, and physics.
These studies provide the necessary background for more applied courses, such as anatomy and physiology, exercise physiology, kinesiology, and nutrition.
Knowledge of chemistry is necessary for understanding pharmacological and medical terminology.
For example, athletic trainers must understand the action of numerous drugs, many of which are esters, amines, or amides like those mentioned in this chapter.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 847  Athletic trainers may have administrative duties, such as the responsibility for ordering supplies.
They also need to be able to evaluate nutritional supplements because providing the wrong one can get an athlete banned from competition and may bring sanctions against a school.
In short, the athletic trainer is responsible for the overall health and well-being of the athletes in his or her charge.

A carboxylic acid (RCOOH) contains the functional group COOH, called thecarboxyl group, which has an OH group attached to a carbonyl carbon atom.
An ester (RCOOR′) has an OR′ group attached to a carbonyl carbon atom.
Anamine is derived from ammonia (NH ), with one, two, or all three of the hydrogen atoms of 3 NH replaced by an alkyl (or an aryl) group.
The amidefunctional group has a carbonyl 3 group joined to a nitrogen atom from NH or an amine.
3 There are many familiar carboxylic acids.
The R group may be a hydrogen atom (as in formic acid, HCOOH), an alkyl group (as in acetic acid, CH COOH), or an aryl group (as 2 in benzoic acid, C H COOH).
The location of substituents along the carbon chain is 6 5 indicated by a Greek letter (for common names) or a number (for names from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry).
A carboxylic acid is formed by the oxidation of an aldehyde with the same number of carbon atoms.
Because aldehydes are formed from primary alcohols, these alcohols are also a starting material for carboxylic acids.
Carboxylic acids have strong, often disagreeable, odors.
They are highly polar molecules and readily engage in hydrogen bonding, so they have relatively high boiling points.
Carboxylic acids are weak acids.
They react with bases to form salts and with carbonates and bicarbonates to form carbon dioxide gas and the salt of the acid.
Esters are pleasant-smelling compounds that are responsible for the fragrances of flowers and fruits.
They have lower boiling points than comparable carboxylic acids because, even though ester molecules are somewhat polar, they cannot engage in hydrogen bonding.
However, with water, esters can engage in hydrogen bonding; consequently, the low molar mass esters are soluble in water.
Esters can be synthesized by esterification, in which a carboxylic acid and an alcohol are combined under acidic Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 850  conditions.
Esters are neutral compounds that undergo hydrolysis, a reaction with water.
Under acidic conditions, hydrolysis is essentially the reverse of esterification.
When carried out under basic conditions, the process is called saponification.
Inorganic acids also react with alcohols to form esters.
Some of the most important esters in biochemistry are those formed from phosphoric acid.
Amines are nitrogen-containing organic molecules derived from ammonia (NH ).
3 A primary (1°) amine (RNH ) has one organic group bonded to the nitrogen atom, 2 a secondary (2°) amine (R NH) has two organic groups bonded to the nitrogen atom, 2 and a tertiary (3°) amine (R N) has three organic groups bonded to the nitrogen 3 atom.
Amines are basic compounds that react with strong acids to produce ammonium (NH +) salts.
A cyclic compound in which the ring contains one or more noncarbon 4 atoms is called a heterocyclic compound.
There are many heterocyclic amines, including many physiologically important ones.
Alkaloids are heterocyclic amines found in many plants.
Caffeine, nicotine, and cocaine are familiar alkaloids.
Organic compounds containing a carbonyl group bonded to a nitrogen atom are amides, and the carbon-to-nitrogen bond is an amide linkage (or a peptide linkage).
Most amides are colorless and odorless, and the lighter ones are soluble in water.
Because they are polar molecules, amides have comparatively high boiling points and melting points.
Amides are synthesized from carboxylic acids and NH or amines.
Amides are 3 neutral compounds.
They resist hydrolysis in water, but acids, bases, and enzymes catalyze the reaction.

20.0 mL Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 856  Chapter 16 Carbohydrates Opening Essay In the United States, 17.9 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, and experts estimate that at least another 5.7 million people have the disease but have not been diagnosed.
In 2006, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death, listed on 72,507 death certificates.
Moreover, it was a contributing factor in over 200,000 deaths in which the cause was listed as something else, such as heart or kidney disease.
People with diabetes are impaired in their ability to metabolize glucose, a sugar needed by the body for energy; as a result, excessive quantities of glucose accumulate in the blood and the urine.
The characteristic symptoms of diabetes are weight loss, constant hunger, extreme thirst, and frequent urination (the kidneys excrete large amounts of water in an attempt to remove the excess sugar from the blood).
An important diagnostic test for diabetes is the oral glucose tolerance test, which measures the level of glucose in blood plasma.
A first measurement is made after a fast of at least 8 h, followed by another measurement 2 h after the person drinks a flavored solution of 75 g of glucose dissolved in water.
At the second measurement, the glucose plasma level should be no higher than 139 mg/dL.
Individuals with a value between 140 and 199 mg/dL are diagnosed with prediabetes, while those with a value of 200 mg/dL or above are diagnosed with diabetes.
Following a diagnosis of diabetes a person will need to monitor his or her blood glucose levels daily (or more often) using a glucose meter.
Glucose is one of the carbohydrates you will learn about in this chapter as we begin the study of biochemistry—the chemistry of molecules found in living organisms.
Later we will study the other three major types of macromolecules found in living organisms: lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 857  16.1 Carbohydrates LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Recognize carbohydrates and classify them as mono-, di-, or polysaccharides.
All carbohydrates consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms and are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or are compounds that can be broken down to form such compounds.
Examples of carbohydrates include starch, fiber, the sweet-tasting compounds called sugars, and structural materials such as cellulose.
The term carbohydrate had its origin in a misinterpretation of the molecular formulas of many of these substances.
For example, because its formula is C H O , glucose was once 6 12 6 thought to be a “carbon hydrate” with the structure C ·6H O.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 858  2.

Solution 1.
This is a carbohydrate because the molecule contains an aldehyde functional group with OH groups on the other two carbon atoms.
2.
This is not a carbohydrate because the molecule does not contain an aldehyde or a ketone functional group.
3.
This is a carbohydrate because the molecule contains a ketone functional group with OH groups on the other two carbon atoms.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 859  4.
This is not a carbohydrate; although it has a ketone functional group, one of the other carbons atoms does not have an OH group attached.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Which compounds would be classified as carbohydrates?

4.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 860  Green plants are capable of synthesizing glucose (C H O ) from carbon dioxide (CO ) 6 12 6 2 and water (H O) by using solar energy in the process known as photosynthesis: 2 6CO + 6H O + 686 kcal → C H O + 6O 2 2 6 12 6 2 (The 686 kcal come from solar energy.)
Plants can use the glucose for energy or convert it to larger carbohydrates, such as starch or cellulose.
Starch provides energy for later use, perhaps as nourishment for a plant’s seeds, while cellulose is the structural material of plants.
We can gather and eat the parts of a plant that store energy—seeds, roots, tubers, and fruits—and use some of that energy ourselves.
Carbohydrates are also needed for the synthesis of nucleic acids and many proteins and lipids.
Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water and are therefore dependent on the plant kingdom to provide these vital compounds.
We use carbohydrates not only for food (about 60%–65% by mass of the average diet) but also for clothing (cotton, linen, rayon), shelter (wood), fuel (wood), and paper (wood).
The simplest carbohydrates—those that cannot be hydrolyzed to produce even smaller carbohydrates—are called monosaccharides.
Two or more monosaccharides can link together to form chains that contain from two to several hundred or thousand monosaccharide units.
Prefixes are used to indicate the number of such units in the chains.
Disaccharide molecules have two monosaccharide units, trisaccharide molecules have three units, and so on.
Chains with many monosaccharide units joined together are called polysaccharides.
All these so-called higher saccharides can be hydrolyzed back to their constituent monosaccharides.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 861  Note Compounds that cannot be hydrolyzed will not react with water to form two or more smaller compounds.
CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
Why is photosynthesis important?
2.
Identify the differences among monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
ANSWERS 1.
Photosynthesis is the process by which solar energy is used to reduce carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, which are needed for energy by plants and other living organisms that eat plants.
2.
A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and cannot be hydrolyzed to produce a smaller carbohydrate; a disaccharide is composed of two monosaccharide units; and a polysaccharide contains many saccharide units.
KEY TAKEAWAYS Carbohydrates are an important group of biological molecules that includes sugars and  starches.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use energy from sunlight to synthesize  carbohydrates.
A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and cannot be hydrolyzed to produce a  smaller carbohydrate molecule.
Disaccharides contain two monosaccharide units, and polysaccharides contain many monosaccharide units.
EXERCISES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 862  1.
When an aqueous solution of trehalose is heated, two molecules of glucose are produced for each molecule of trehalose.
Is trehalose a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, or a polysaccharide?
2.
When an aqueous solution of arabinose is heated, no other molecules are produced.
Is arabinose a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, or a polysaccharide?
ANSWER 1.
Trehalose is a disaccharide because it is hydrolyzed into two molecules of glucose (a monosaccharide).
16.2 Classes of Monosaccharides LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Classify monosaccharides as aldoses or ketoses and as trioses, tetroses, pentoses, or hexoses.
2.
Distinguish between a D sugar and an L sugar.
The naturally occurring monosaccharides contain three to seven carbon atoms per molecule.
Monosaccharides of specific sizes may be indicated by names composed of a stem denoting the number of carbon atoms and the suffix -ose.
For example, the terms triose, tetrose, pentose, and hexose signify monosaccharides with, respectively, three, four, five, and six carbon atoms.
Monosaccharides are also classified as aldoses or ketoses.
Those monosaccharides that contain an aldehyde functional group are called aldoses; those containing a ketone functional group on the second carbon atom are Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 863  ketoses.
Combining these classification systems gives general names that indicate both the type of carbonyl group and the number of carbon atoms in a molecule.
Thus, monosaccharides are described as aldotetroses, aldopentoses, ketopentoses, ketoheptoses, and so forth.
Glucose and fructose are specific examples of an aldohexose and a ketohexose, respectively.
EXAMPLE 2 Draw an example of each type of compound.
1. a ketopentose 2. an aldotetrose Solution 1.
The structure must have five carbon atoms with the second carbon atom being a carbonyl group and the other four carbon atoms each having an OH group attached.
Several structures are possible, but one example is shown.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 864  2.
The structure must have four carbon atoms with the first carbon atom part of the aldehyde functional group.
The other three carbon atoms each have an OH group attached.
Several structures are possible, but one example is shown.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Draw an example of each type of compound.
1. an aldohexose 2. a ketotetrose The simplest sugars are the trioses.
The possible trioses are shown in part (a) of Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses"; glyceraldehyde is an aldotriose, while dihydroxyacetone is a ketotriose.
Notice that two structures are shown for glyceraldehyde.
These structures are stereoisomers, isomers having the same structural formula but differing in the arrangement of atoms or groups of atoms in three-dimensional space.
If Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 865  you make models of the two stereoisomers of glyceraldehyde, you will find that you cannot place one model on top of the other and have each functional group point in the same direction.
However, if you place one of the models in front of a mirror, the image in the mirror will be identical to the second stereoisomer in part (b) of Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses".
Molecules that are nonsuperimposable (nonidentical) mirror images of each other are a type of stereoisomer called enantiomers (Greek enantios, meaning “opposite”).
Note Cis-trans (geometric) isomers were discussed in Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", Section 13.2 "Cis-Trans Isomers (Geometric Isomers)".
These are another type of stereoisomers.
Figure 16.2 Structures of the Trioses Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 866  (a) D- and L-glyceraldehyde are mirror images of each other and represent a pair of enantiomers.
(b) A ball-and-stick model of D-glyceraldehyde is reflected in a mirror.
Note that the reflection has the same structure as L-glyceraldehyde.
A key characteristic of enantiomers is that they have a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached.
Note, for example, the four different groups attached to the central carbon atom of glyceraldehyde (part (a) of Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses").
A carbon atom that has four different groups attached is a chiral carbon.
If a molecule contains one or more chiral carbons, it is likely to exist as two or more stereoisomers.
Dihydroxyacetone does not contain a chiral carbon and thus does not exist as a pair of stereoisomers.
Glyceraldehyde, however, has a chiral carbon and exists as a pair of enantiomers.
Except for the direction in which each enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light, these two molecules have identical physical properties.
One enantiomer has a specific rotation of +8.7°, while the other has a specific rotation of −8.7°.
H. Emil Fischer, a German chemist, developed the convention commonly used for writing two-dimensional representations of the monosaccharides, such as those in part (a) of Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses".
In these structural formulas, the aldehyde group is written at the top, and the hydrogen atoms and OH groups that are attached to each chiral carbon are written to the right or left.
(If the monosaccharide is a ketose, the ketone functional group is the second carbon atom.)
Vertical lines represent bonds pointing away from you, while horizontal lines represent bonds coming toward you.
The formulas of chiral molecules represented in this manner are referred to as Fischer projections.
The two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde are especially important because monosaccharides with more than three carbon atoms can be considered as being derived from them.
Thus, D- and L-glyceraldehyde provide reference points for designating and drawing all other monosaccharides.
Sugars whose Fischer projections terminate in the same configuration as D-glyceraldehyde are designated as D sugars; those derived from L-glyceraldehyde are designated as L sugars.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 867  Note By convention, the penultimate (next-to-last) carbon atom has been chosen as the carbon atom that determines if a sugar is D or L. It is the chiral carbon farthest from the aldehyde or ketone functional group.
Looking Closer: Polarized Light A beam of ordinary light can be pictured as a bundle of waves; some move up and down, some sideways, and others at all other conceivable angles.
When a beam of light has been polarized, however, the waves in the bundle all vibrate in a single plane.
Light altered in this way is called plane-polarized light.
Much of what chemists know about stereoisomers comes from studying the effects they have on plane-polarized light.
In this illustration, the light on the left is not polarized, while that on the right is polarized.
Sunlight, in general, is not polarized; light from an ordinary light bulb or an ordinary flashlight is not polarized.
One way to polarize ordinary light is to pass it through Polaroid sheets, special plastic sheets containing carefully oriented organic compounds that permit only light vibrating in a single plane to pass through.
To the eye, polarized light doesn’t “look” any different from nonpolarized light.
We can detect polarized light, however, by using a second sheet of polarizing material, as shown here.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 868  In the photo on the left, two Polaroid sheets are aligned in the same direction; plane- polarized light from the first Polaroid sheet can pass through the second sheet.
In the photo on the right, the top Polaroid sheet has been rotated 90° and now blocks the plane-polarized light that comes through the first Polaroid sheet.
Certain substances act on polarized light by rotating the plane of vibration.
Such substances are said to be optically active.
The extent of optical activity is measured by a polarimeter, an instrument that contains two polarizing lenses separated by a sample tube, as shown in the accompanying figure.
With the sample tube empty, maximum light reaches the observer’s eye when the two lenses are aligned so that both pass light vibrating in the same plane.
When an optically active substance is placed in the sample tube, that substance rotates the plane of polarization of the light passing through it, so that the polarized light emerging from the sample tube is vibrating in a different direction than when it entered the tube.
To see the maximum amount of light when the sample is in place, the observer must rotate one lens to accommodate the change in the plane of polarization.
Figure 16.3 Diagram of a Polarimeter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 869  Some optically active substances rotate the plane of polarized light to the right (clockwise) from the observer’s point of view.
These compounds are said to be dextrorotatory; substances that rotate light to the left (counterclockwise) are levorotatory.
To denote the direction of rotation, a positive sign (+) is given to dextrorotatory substances, and a negative sign (−) is given to levorotatory substances.

Identify the structures of D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose and describe how they differ from each other.
Although a variety of monosaccharides are found in living organisms, three hexoses are particularly abundant: D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s03_f01).
Glucose and galactose are both aldohexoses, while fructose is a ketohexose.
Glucose D-Glucose, generally referred to as simply glucose, is the most abundant sugar found in nature; most of the carbohydrates we eat are eventually converted to it in a series of biochemical reactions that produce energy for our cells.
It is also known by three other names: dextrose, from the fact that it rotates plane-polarized light in a clockwise (dextrorotatory) direction; corn sugar because in the United States cornstarch is used in the commercial process that produces glucose from the hydrolysis of starch; andblood sugar because it is the carbohydrate found in the circulatory system of animals.
Normal blood sugar values range from 70 to 105 mg glucose/dL plasma, and normal urine may contain anywhere from a trace to 20 mg glucose/dL urine.
The Fischer projection of D-glucose is given in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s04_f01.
Glucose is a D sugar because the OH group on the fifth carbon atom (the chiral center farthest from the carbonyl group) is on the right.
In fact, all the OH groups except the one on the third carbon atom are to the right.
Galactose Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 875  D-Galactose does not occur in nature in the uncombined state.
It is released when lactose, a disaccharide found in milk, is hydrolyzed.
The galactose needed by the human body for the synthesis of lactose is obtained by the metabolic conversion of D-glucose to D-galactose.
Galactose is also an important constituent of the glycolipids that occur in the brain and the myelin sheath of nerve cells.
(For more information about glycolipids, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch17, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch17_s03.)
For this reason it is also known as brain sugar.
The structure of D-galactose is shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s03_f01.
Notice that the configuration differs from that of glucose only at the fourth carbon atom.
Fructose D-Fructose, also shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch16_s03_f01, is the most abundant ketohexose.
Note that from the third through the sixth carbon atoms, its structure is the same as that of glucose.
It occurs, along with glucose and sucrose, in honey (which is 40% fructose) and sweet fruits.
Fructose (from the Latin fructus, meaning “fruit”) is also referred to as levulosebecause it has a specific rotation that is strongly levorotatory (−92.4°).
It is the sweetest sugar, being 1.7 times sweeter than sucrose, although many nonsugars are several hundred or several thousand times as sweet (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch16_s03_s03_t01).
Table 16.1 The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100) Compound Relative Sweetness lactose 16 maltose 32 glucose 74 sucrose 100 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 876  Compound Relative Sweetness fructose 173 aspartame 18,000 acesulfame K 20,000 saccharin 30,000 sucralose 60,000 Looking Closer: Artificial Sweeteners Although sweetness is commonly associated with mono- and disaccharides, it is not a property found only in sugars.
Several other kinds of organic compounds have been synthesized that are far superior as sweetening agents.
These so-called high-intensity or artificial sweeteners are useful for people with diabetes or other medical conditions that require them to control their carbohydrate intake.
The synthetic compounds are noncaloric or used in such small quantities that they do not add significantly to the caloric value of food.
The first artificial sweetener—saccharin—was discovered by accident in 1879.
It is 300 times sweeter than sucrose, but it passes through the body unchanged and thus adds no calories to the diet.
After its discovery, saccharin was used until it was banned in the early 1900s.
However, during the sugar-short years of World War I, the ban was lifted and was not reinstated at the war’s end.
One drawback to the use of saccharin is its bitter, metallic aftertaste.
The initial solution to this problem was to combine saccharin with cyclamate, a second artificial sweetener discovered in 1937.
In the 1960s and 1970s, several clinical tests with laboratory animals implicated both cyclamate and saccharin as carcinogenic (cancer-causing) substances.
The results from the cyclamate tests were completed first, and cyclamate was banned in the United States in 1969.
Then a major study was released in Canada in 1977 indicating that saccharin Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 877  increased the incidence of bladder cancer in rats.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a ban on saccharin that raised immediate public opposition because saccharin was the only artificial sweetener still available.
In response, Congress passed the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act in 1977, permitting the use of saccharin as long as any product containing it was labeled with a consumer warning regarding the possible elevation of the risk of bladder cancer.
Today this warning is no longer required; moreover, the FDA is currently reviewing the ban on cyclamate, as 75 additional studies and years of usage in other countries, such as Canada, have failed to show that it has any carcinogenic effect.
A third artificial sweetener, aspartame, was discovered in 1965.
This white crystalline compound is about 180 times sweeter than sucrose and has no aftertaste.
It was approved for use in 1981 and is used to sweeten a wide variety of foods because it blends well with other food flavors.
Aspartame is not used in baked goods, however, because it is not heat stable.
In the body (or when heated), aspartame is initially hydrolyzed to three molecules: the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine and an alcohol methanol.
Repeated controversy regarding the safety of aspartame arises partly from the fact that the body metabolizes the released methanol to formaldehyde.
It should be noted, though, that a glass of tomato juice has six times as much methanol as a similar amount of a diet soda containing aspartame.
The only documented risk connected to aspartame use is for individuals with the genetic diseasephenylketonuria (PKU); these individuals lack the enzyme needed to metabolize the phenylalanine released when aspartame is broken down by the body.
Because of the danger to people with PKU, all products containing aspartame must carry a warning label.
Acesulfame K, discovered just two years after aspartame (1967), was approved for use in the United States in 1988.
It is 200 times sweeter than sugar and, unlike aspartame, is heat stable.
It has no lingering aftertaste.
One of the newest artificial sweeteners to gain FDA approval (April 1998) for use in the United States is sucralose, a white crystalline solid approximately 600 times sweeter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 878  than sucrose.
Sucralose is synthesized from sucrose and has three chlorine atoms substituted for three OH groups.
It is noncaloric because it passes through the body unchanged.
It can be used in baking because it is heat stable.
All of the extensive clinical studies completed to date have indicated that these artificial sweeteners approved for use in the United States are safe for consumption by healthy individuals in moderate amounts.

Define what is meant by anomers and describe how they are formed.
2.
Explain what is meant by mutarotation.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 881  So far we have represented monosaccharides as linear molecules, but many of them also adopt cyclic structures.
This conversion occurs because of the ability of aldehydes and ketones to react with alcohols: In some cases, OH and carbonyl groups on the same molecule are able to react with one another in an intramolecular reaction.
Thus, monosaccharides larger than tetroses exist mainly as cyclic compounds (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s04_f01).
You might wonder why the aldehyde reacts with the OH group on the fifth carbon atom rather than the OH group on the second carbon atom next to it.
Recall from http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch12, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch12_s09, that cyclic alkanes containing five or six carbon atoms in the ring are the most stable.
The same is true for monosaccharides that form cyclic structures: rings consisting of five or six carbon atoms are the most stable.
Figure 16.5 Cyclization of D-Glucose Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 882  D-Glucose can be represented with a Fischer projection (a) or three dimensionally (b).
By reacting the OH group on the fifth carbon atom with the aldehyde group, the cyclic monosaccharide (c) is produced.
When a straight-chain monosaccharide, such as any of the structures shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s03_f01, forms a cyclic structure, the carbonyl oxygen atom may be pushed either up or down, giving rise to two stereoisomers, as shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s04_f02.
The structure shown on the left side of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s04_f02, with the OH group on the first carbon atom projected downward, represent what is called the alpha (α) form.
The structures on the right side, with the OH group on the first carbon atom pointed upward, is the beta (β) form.
These two stereoisomers of a cyclic monosaccharide are known as anomers; they differ in structure around the anomeric carbon—that is, the carbon atom that was the carbonyl carbon atom in the straight- chain form.
Figure 16.6 Monosaccharides Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 883  In an aqueous solution, monosaccharides exist as an equilibrium mixture of three forms.
The interconversion between the forms is known as mutarotation, which is shown for D-glucose (a) and D-fructose (b).
It is possible to obtain a sample of crystalline glucose in which all the molecules have the α structure or all have the β structure.
The α form melts at 146°C and has a specific rotation of +112°, while the β form melts at 150°C and has a specific rotation of +18.7°.
When the sample is dissolved in water, however, a mixture is soon produced containing both anomers as well as the straight-chain form, in dynamic equilibrium (part (a) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s04_f02).
You can start with a pure crystalline sample of glucose consisting entirely of either anomer, but as soon as the molecules dissolve in water, they open to form the carbonyl group and then reclose to form either the α or the β anomer.
The opening and closing repeats continuously in an ongoing interconversion between anomeric forms and is referred to as mutarotation (Latin mutare, meaning “to change”).
At equilibrium, the mixture consists of about 36% α-D-glucose, 64% β-D-glucose, and less than 0.02% of the open- chain aldehyde form.
The observed rotation of this solution is +52.7°.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 884  Even though only a small percentage of the molecules are in the open-chain aldehyde form at any time, the solution will nevertheless exhibit the characteristic reactions of an aldehyde.
As the small amount of free aldehyde is used up in a reaction, there is a shift in the equilibrium to yield more aldehyde.
Thus, all the molecules may eventually react, even though very little free aldehyde is present at a time.
In http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch16_s04_f01and http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch16_s04_f02, and elsewhere in this book, the cyclic forms of sugars are depicted using a convention first suggested by Walter N. Haworth, an English chemist.
The molecules are drawn as planar hexagons with a darkened edge representing the side facing toward the viewer.
The structure is simplified to show only the functional groups attached to the carbon atoms.
Any group written to the right in a Fischer projection appears below the plane of the ring in a Haworth projection, and any group written to the left in a Fischer projection appears above the plane in a Haworth projection.
The difference between the α and the β forms of sugars may seem trivial, but such structural differences are often crucial in biochemical reactions.
This explains why we can get energy from the starch in potatoes and other plants but not from cellulose, even though both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides composed of glucose molecules linked together.
We will examine the effects of these differences more closely in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s07and when we discuss enzyme specificity in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s05.

16.5 Properties of Monosaccharides LEARNING OBJECTIVE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 887  1.
Identify the physical and chemical properties of monosaccharides.
Monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose are crystalline solids at room temperature, but they are quite soluble in water, each molecule having several OH groups that readily engage in hydrogen bonding.
The chemical behavior of these monosaccharides is likewise determined by their functional groups.
An important reaction of monosaccharides is the oxidation of the aldehyde group, one of the most easily oxidized organic functional groups.
Aldehyde oxidation can be accomplished with any mild oxidizing agent, such as Tollens’ reagent or Benedict’s reagent.
(For more information about aldehyde oxidation, see Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen", Section 14.5 "Reactions of Alcohols".)
With the latter, complexed copper(II) ions are reduced to copper(I) ions that form a brick-red precipitate [copper(I) oxide; Figure 16.7 "Benedict’s Test"].
Any carbohydrate capable of reducing either Tollens’ or Benedict’s reagents without first undergoing hydrolysis is said to be a reducing sugar.
Because both the Tollens’ and Benedict’s reagents are basic solutions, ketoses (such as fructose) also give positive tests due to an equilibrium that exists between ketoses and aldoses in a reaction known as tautomerism.
Figure 16.7 Benedict’s Test Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 888  Benedict’s test was performed on three carbohydrates, depicted from left to right: fructose, glucose, and sucrose.
The solution containing sucrose remains blue because sucrose is a nonreducing sugar.
These reactions have been used as simple and rapid diagnostic tests for the presence of glucose in blood or urine.
For example, Clinitest tablets, which are used to test for sugar in the urine, contain copper(II) ions and are based on Benedict’s test.
A green color indicates very little sugar, whereas a brick-red color indicates sugar in excess of 2 g/100 mL of urine.

16.6 Disaccharides LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Identify the structures of sucrose, lactose, and maltose.
2.
Identify the monosaccharides that are needed to form sucrose, lactose, and maltose.
In Section 16.4 "Cyclic Structures of Monosaccharides", you learned that monosaccharides can form cyclic structures by the reaction of the carbonyl group with an OH group.
These cyclic molecules can in turn react with another alcohol.
Disaccharides (C H O ) are sugars composed of two monosaccharide units that are 12 22 11 joined by a carbon–oxygen-carbon linkage known as a glycosidic linkage.
This Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 891  linkage is formed from the reaction of the anomeric carbon of one cyclic monosaccharide with the OH group of a second monosaccharide.
The disaccharides differ from one another in their monosaccharide constituents and in the specific type of glycosidic linkage connecting them.
There are three common disaccharides: maltose, lactose, and sucrose.
All three are white crystalline solids at room temperature and are soluble in water.
We’ll consider each sugar in more detail.
Maltose Maltose occurs to a limited extent in sprouting grain.
It is formed most often by the partial hydrolysis of starch and glycogen.
In the manufacture of beer, maltose is liberated by the action of malt (germinating barley) on starch; for this reason, it is often referred to as malt sugar.
Maltose is about 30% as sweet as sucrose.
The human body is unable to metabolize maltose or any other disaccharide directly from the diet because Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 892  the molecules are too large to pass through the cell membranes of the intestinal wall.
Therefore, an ingested disaccharide must first be broken down by hydrolysis into its two constituent monosaccharide units.
In the body, such hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed by enzymes such as maltase.
The same reactions can be carried out in the laboratory with dilute acid as a catalyst, although in that case the rate is much slower, and high temperatures are required.
Whether it occurs in the body or a glass beaker, the hydrolysis of maltose produces two molecules of D-glucose.
Maltose is a reducing sugar.
Thus, its two glucose molecules must be linked in such a way as to leave one anomeric carbon that can open to form an aldehyde group.
The glucose units in maltose are joined in a head-to-tail fashion through an α-linkage from the first carbon atom of one glucose molecule to the fourth carbon atom of the second glucose molecule (that is, an α-1,4-glycosidic linkage; see Figure 16.8 "An Equilibrium Mixture of Maltose Isomers").
The bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit is directed downward, which is why this is known as an α- glycosidic linkage.
The OH group on the anomeric carbon of the second glucose can be in either the α or the β position, as shown in Figure 16.8 "An Equilibrium Mixture of Maltose Isomers".
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 893  Figure 16.8 An Equilibrium Mixture of Maltose Isomers Lactose Lactose is known as milk sugar because it occurs in the milk of humans, cows, and other mammals.
In fact, the natural synthesis of lactose occurs only in mammary tissue, whereas most other carbohydrates are plant products.
Human milk contains about 7.5% lactose, and cow’s milk contains about 4.5%.
This sugar is one of the lowest ranking in terms of sweetness, being about one-sixth as sweet as sucrose (seeTable 16.1 "The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100)" in Section 16.3 "Important Hexoses").
Lactose is produced commercially from whey, a by-product in the manufacture of cheese.
It is important as an infant food and in the production of penicillin.
Lactose is a reducing sugar composed of one molecule of D-galactose and one molecule of D-glucose joined by a β-1,4-glycosidic bond (the bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit being directed upward).
The two monosaccharides are obtained from lactose by acid hydrolysis or the catalytic action of the enzyme lactase: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 894  Many adults and some children suffer from a deficiency of lactase.
These individuals are said to be lactose intolerant because they cannot digest the lactose found in milk.
A more serious problem is the genetic disease galactosemia, which results from the absence of an enzyme needed to convert galactose to glucose.
Certain bacteria can metabolize lactose, forming lactic acid as one of the products.
This reaction is responsible for the “souring” of milk.
EXAMPLE 3 1.
For this trisaccharide, indicate whether each glycosidic linkage is α or β. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 895  Solution The glycosidic linkage between sugars 1 and 2 is β because the bond is directed up from the anomeric carbon.
The glycosidic linkage between sugars 2 and 3 is α because the bond is directed down from the anomeric carbon.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
For this trisaccharide, indicate whether each glycosidic linkage is α or β.
To Your Health: Lactose Intolerance and Galactosemia Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 896  Lactose makes up about 40% of an infant’s diet during the first year of life.
Infants and small children have one form of the enzyme lactase in their small intestines and can digest the sugar easily; however, adults usually have a less active form of the enzyme, and about 70% of the world’s adult population has some deficiency in its production.
As a result, many adults experience a reduction in the ability to hydrolyze lactose to galactose and glucose in their small intestine.
For some people the inability to synthesize sufficient enzyme increases with age.
Up to 20% of the US population suffers some degree of lactose intolerance.
In people with lactose intolerance, some of the unhydrolyzed lactose passes into the colon, where it tends to draw water from the interstitial fluid into the intestinal lumen by osmosis.
At the same time, intestinal bacteria may act on the lactose to produce organic acids and gases.
The buildup of water and bacterial decay products leads to abdominal distention, cramps, and diarrhea, which are symptoms of the condition.
The symptoms disappear if milk or other sources of lactose are excluded from the diet or consumed only sparingly.
Alternatively, many food stores now carry special brands of milk that have been pretreated with lactase to hydrolyze the lactose.
Cooking or fermenting milk causes at least partial hydrolysis of the lactose, so some people with lactose intolerance are still able to enjoy cheese, yogurt, or cooked foods containing milk.
The most common treatment for lactose intolerance, however, is the use of lactase preparations (e.g., Lactaid), which are available in liquid and tablet form at drugstores and grocery stores.
These are taken orally with dairy foods—or may be added to them directly—to assist in their digestion.
Galactosemia is a condition in which one of the enzymes needed to convert galactose to glucose is missing.
Consequently, the blood galactose level is markedly elevated, and galactose is found in the urine.
An infant with galactosemia experiences a lack of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and jaundice.
The disease may result in impaired liver function, cataracts, mental retardation, and even death.
If galactosemia is recognized in early infancy, its effects can be prevented by the exclusion of milk and all other sources of galactose from the diet.
As a child with galactosemia grows older, he or she usually Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 897  develops an alternate pathway for metabolizing galactose, so the need to restrict milk is not permanent.
The incidence of galactosemia in the United States is 1 in every 65,000 newborn babies.
Sucrose Sucrose, probably the largest-selling pure organic compound in the world, is known asbeet sugar, cane sugar, table sugar, or simply sugar.
Most of the sucrose sold commercially is obtained from sugar cane and sugar beets (whose juices are 14%–20% sucrose) by evaporation of the water and recrystallization.
The dark brown liquid that remains after the recrystallization of sugar is sold as molasses.
The sucrose molecule is unique among the common disaccharides in having an α-1,β-2- glycosidic (head-to-head) linkage.
Because this glycosidic linkage is formed by the OH group on the anomeric carbon of α-D-glucose and the OH group on the anomeric carbon of β-D-fructose, it ties up the anomeric carbons of both glucose and fructose.
This linkage gives sucrose certain properties that are quite different from those of maltose and lactose.
As long as the sucrose molecule remains intact, neither monosaccharide “uncyclizes” to form an open-chain structure.
Thus, sucrose is incapable of mutarotation and exists in only one form both in the solid state and in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 898  solution.
In addition, sucrose does not undergo reactions that are typical of aldehydes and ketones.
Therefore, sucrose is a nonreducing sugar.
The hydrolysis of sucrose in dilute acid or through the action of the enzyme sucrase(also known as invertase) gives an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose.
This 1:1 mixture is referred to as invert sugar because it rotates plane-polarized light in the opposite direction than sucrose.
The hydrolysis reaction has several practical applications.
Sucrose readily recrystallizes from a solution, but invert sugar has a much greater tendency to remain in solution.
In the manufacture of jelly and candy and in the canning of fruit, the recrystallization of sugar is undesirable.
Therefore, conditions leading to the hydrolysis of sucrose are employed in these processes.
Moreover, because fructose is sweeter than sucrose, the hydrolysis adds to the sweetening effect.
Bees carry out this reaction when they make honey.
The average American consumes more than 100 lb of sucrose every year.
About two- thirds of this amount is ingested in soft drinks, presweetened cereals, and other highly processed foods.
The widespread use of sucrose is a contributing factor to obesity and tooth decay.
Carbohydrates such as sucrose, are converted to fat when the caloric intake exceeds the body’s requirements, and sucrose causes tooth decay by promoting the formation of plaque that sticks to teeth.

Compare and contrast the structures and uses of starch, glycogen, and cellulose.
The polysaccharides are the most abundant carbohydrates in nature and serve a variety of functions, such as energy storage or as components of plant cell walls.
Polysaccharides are very large polymers composed of tens to thousands of monosaccharides joined together by glycosidic linkages.
The three most abundant polysaccharides are starch, glycogen, and cellulose.
These three are referred to ashomopolymers because each yields only one type of monosaccharide (glucose) after complete hydrolysis.
Heteropolymers may contain sugar acids, amino sugars, or noncarbohydrate substances in addition to monosaccharides.
Heteropolymers are common in nature (gums, pectins, and other substances) but will not be discussed Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 905  further in this textbook.
The polysaccharides are nonreducing carbohydrates, are not sweet tasting, and do not undergo mutarotation.
Starch Starch is the most important source of carbohydrates in the human diet and accounts for more than 50% of our carbohydrate intake.
It occurs in plants in the form of granules, and these are particularly abundant in seeds (especially the cereal grains) and tubers, where they serve as a storage form of carbohydrates.
The breakdown of starch to glucose nourishes the plant during periods of reduced photosynthetic activity.
We often think of potatoes as a “starchy” food, yet other plants contain a much greater percentage of starch (potatoes 15%, wheat 55%, corn 65%, and rice 75%).
Commercial starch is a white powder.
Starch is a mixture of two polymers: amylose and amylopectin.
Natural starches consist of about 10%–30% amylase and 70%–90% amylopectin.
Amylose is a linear polysaccharide composed entirely of D-glucose units joined by the α-1,4-glycosidic linkages we saw in maltose (part (a) of Figure 16.9 "Amylose").
Experimental evidence indicates that amylose is not a straight chain of glucose units but instead is coiled like a spring, with six glucose monomers per turn (part (b) of Figure 16.9 "Amylose").
When coiled in this fashion, amylose has just enough room in its core to accommodate an iodine molecule.
The characteristic blue-violet color that appears when starch is treated with iodine is due to the formation of the amylose-iodine complex.
This color test is sensitive enough to detect even minute amounts of starch in solution.
Figure 16.9 Amylose Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 906  (a) Amylose is a linear chain of α-D-glucose units joined together by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds.
(b) Because of hydrogen bonding, amylose acquires a spiral structure that contains six glucose units per turn.
Amylopectin is a branched-chain polysaccharide composed of glucose units linked primarily by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds but with occasional α-1,6-glycosidic bonds, which are responsible for the branching.
A molecule of amylopectin may contain many thousands of glucose units with branch points occurring about every 25–30 units (Figure 16.10 "Representation of the Branching in Amylopectin and Glycogen").
The helical structure of amylopectin is disrupted by the branching of the chain, so instead of the deep blue-violet color amylose gives with iodine, amylopectin produces a less intense reddish brown.
Figure 16.10 Representation of the Branching in Amylopectin and Glycogen Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 907  Both amylopectin and glycogen contain branch points that are linked through α-1,6- linkages.
These branch points occur more often in glycogen.
Dextrins are glucose polysaccharides of intermediate size.
The shine and stiffness imparted to clothing by starch are due to the presence of dextrins formed when clothing is ironed.
Because of their characteristic stickiness with wetting, dextrins are used as adhesives on stamps, envelopes, and labels; as binders to hold pills and tablets together; and as pastes.
Dextrins are more easily digested than starch and are therefore used extensively in the commercial preparation of infant foods.
The complete hydrolysis of starch yields, in successive stages, glucose: starch → dextrins → maltose → glucose In the human body, several enzymes known collectively as amylases degrade starch sequentially into usable glucose units.
Glycogen Glycogen is the energy reserve carbohydrate of animals.
Practically all mammalian cells contain some stored carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, but it is especially abundant in the liver (4%–8% by weight of tissue) and in skeletal muscle cells (0.5%–1.0%).
Like starch in plants, glycogen is found as granules in liver and muscle cells.
When fasting, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 908  animals draw on these glycogen reserves during the first day without food to obtain the glucose needed to maintain metabolic balance.
Note About 70% of the total glycogen in the body is stored in muscle cells.
Although the percentage of glycogen (by weight) is higher in the liver, the much greater mass of skeletal muscle stores a greater total amount of glycogen.
Glycogen is structurally quite similar to amylopectin, although glycogen is more highly branched (8–12 glucose units between branches) and the branches are shorter.
When treated with iodine, glycogen gives a reddish brown color.
Glycogen can be broken down into its D-glucose subunits by acid hydrolysis or by the same enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of starch.
In animals, the enzyme phosphorylase catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to phosphate esters of glucose.
Cellulose Cellulose, a fibrous carbohydrate found in all plants, is the structural component of plant cell walls.
Because the earth is covered with vegetation, cellulose is the most abundant of all carbohydrates, accounting for over 50% of all the carbon found in the vegetable kingdom.
Cotton fibrils and filter paper are almost entirely cellulose (about 95%), wood is about 50% cellulose, and the dry weight of leaves is about 10%–20% cellulose.
The largest use of cellulose is in the manufacture of paper and paper products.
Although the use of noncellulose synthetic fibers is increasing, rayon (made from cellulose) and cotton still account for over 70% of textile production.
Like amylose, cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose.
It differs, however, in that the glucose units are joined by β-1,4-glycosidic linkages, producing a more extended structure than amylose (part (a) of Figure 16.11 "Cellulose").
This extreme linearity allows a great deal of hydrogen bonding between OH groups on adjacent chains, causing them to pack closely into fibers (part (b) of Figure 16.11 "Cellulose").
As a result, cellulose exhibits little interaction with water or any other solvent.
Cotton and wood, for example, are completely insoluble in water and have considerable mechanical strength.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 909  Because cellulose does not have a helical structure, it does not bind to iodine to form a colored product.
Figure 16.11 Cellulose (a) There is extensive hydrogen bonding in the structure of cellulose.
(b) In this electron micrograph of the cell wall of an alga, the wall consists of successive layers of cellulose fibers in parallel arrangement.
Cellulose yields D-glucose after complete acid hydrolysis, yet humans are unable to metabolize cellulose as a source of glucose.
Our digestive juices lack enzymes that can hydrolyze the β-glycosidic linkages found in cellulose, so although we can eat potatoes, we cannot eat grass.
However, certain microorganisms can digest cellulose because they make the enzyme cellulase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of cellulose.
The presence of these microorganisms in the digestive tracts of herbivorous animals (such as cows, horses, and sheep) allows these animals to degrade the cellulose from plant material Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 910  into glucose for energy.
Termites also contain cellulase-secreting microorganisms and thus can subsist on a wood diet.
This example once again demonstrates the extreme stereospecificity of biochemical processes.
Career Focus: Certified Diabetes Educator Certified diabetes educators come from a variety of health professions, such as nursing and dietetics, and specialize in the education and treatment of patients with diabetes.
A diabetes educator will work with patients to manage their diabetes.
This involves teaching the patient to monitor blood sugar levels, make good food choices, develop and maintain an exercise program, and take medication, if required.
Diabetes educators also work with hospital or nursing home staff to improve the care of diabetic patients.
Educators must be willing to spend time attending meetings and reading the current literature to maintain their knowledge of diabetes medications, nutrition, and blood monitoring devices so that they can pass this information to their patients.

16.8 End-of-Chapter Material Chapter Summary To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.
Carbohydrates, a large group of biological compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, include sugars, starch, glycogen, and cellulose.
All carbohydrates contain alcohol functional groups, and either an aldehyde or a ketone group (or a functional group that can be converted to an aldehyde or ketone).
The simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides.
Those with two monosaccharide units are disaccharides, and those with many monosaccharide units are polysaccharides.
Most sugars are either monosaccharides or disaccharides.
Cellulose, glycogen, and starch are polysaccharides.
Many carbohydrates exist as stereoisomers, in which the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the atoms in space is the only difference between the isomers.
These particular stereoisomers contain at least one chiral carbon, a carbon atom that has four different groups bonded to it.
A molecule containing a chiral carbon is nonsuperimposable on its mirror image, and two molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are a special type of stereoisomer called enantiomers.
Enantiomers have the same physical properties, such as melting point, but differ in the direction they rotate polarized light.
A sugar is designated as being a D sugar or an L sugar according to how, in a Fischer projection of the molecule, the hydrogen atom and OH group are attached to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 913  the penultimate carbon atom, which is the carbon atom immediately before the terminal alcohol carbon atom.
If the structure at this carbon atom is the same as that of D- glyceraldehyde (OH to the right), the sugar is a D sugar; if the configuration is the same as that of L-glyceraldehyde (OH to the left), the sugar is an L sugar.
Monosaccharides of five or more carbons atoms readily form cyclic structures when the carbonyl carbon atom reacts with an OH group on a carbon atom three or four carbon atoms distant.
Consequently, glucose in solution exists as an equilibrium mixture of three forms, two of them cyclic (α- and β-) and one open chain.
In Haworth projections, the alpha form is drawn with the OH group on the “former” carbonyl carbon atom (anomeric carbon) pointing downward; thebeta form, with the OH group pointing upward; these two compounds are stereoisomers and are given the more specific term of anomers.
Any solid sugar can be all alpha or all beta.
Once the sample is dissolved in water, however, the ring opens up into the open-chain structure and then closes to form either the α- or the β-anomer.
These interconversions occur back and forth until a dynamic equilibrium mixture is achieved in a process called mutarotation.
The carbonyl group present in monosaccharides is easily oxidized by Tollens’ or Benedict’s reagents (as well as others).
Any mono- or disaccharide containing a free anomeric carbon is a reducing sugar.
The disaccharide maltose contains two glucose units joined in an α-1,4-glycosidic linkage.
The disaccharide lactosecontains a galactose unit and a glucose unit joined by a β-1,4-glycosidic linkage.
Both maltose and lactose contain a free anomeric carbon that can convert to an aldehyde functional group, so they are reducing sugars; they also undergo mutarotation.
Many adults, and some children, have a deficiency of the enzyme lactase (which is needed to break down lactose) and are said to be lactose intolerant.
A more serious problem is the genetic disease galactosemia, which results from the absence of an enzyme needed to convert galactose to glucose.
The disaccharide sucrose (table sugar) consists of a glucose unit and a fructose unit joined by a glycosidic linkage.
The linkage is designated as an α-1,β-2-glycosidic linkage because it involves the OH group on the first carbon atom of glucose and the OH group Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 914  on the second carbon atom of fructose.
Sucrose is not a reducing sugar because it has no anomeric carbon that can reform a carbonyl group, and it cannot undergo mutarotation because of the restrictions imposed by this linkage.
Starch, the principal carbohydrate of plants, is composed of the polysaccharides amylose (10%–30%) and amylopectin (70%–90%).
When ingested by humans and other animals, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose and becomes the body’s energy source.
Glycogen is the polysaccharide animals use to store excess carbohydrates from their diets.
Similar in structure to amylopectin, glycogen is hydrolyzed to glucose whenever an animal needs energy for a metabolic process.
The polysaccharide cellulose provides structure for plant cells.
It is a linear polymer of glucose units joined by β-1,4-glycosidic linkages.
It is indigestible in the human body but digestible by many microorganisms, including microorganisms found in the digestive tracts of many herbivores.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 922  Chapter 17 Lipids Opening Essay On July 11, 2003, the Food and Drug Administration amended its food labeling regulations to require that manufacturers list the amount of trans fatty acids on Nutrition Facts labels of foods and dietary supplements, effective January 1, 2006.
This amendment was a response to published studies demonstrating a link between the consumption of trans fatty acids and an increased risk of heart disease.
Trans fatty acids are produced in the conversion of liquid oils to solid fats, as in the creation of many commercial margarines and shortenings.
They have been shown to increase the levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)—complexes that are often referred to as bad cholesterol—in the blood.
In this chapter, you will learn about fatty acids and what is meant by a trans fatty acid, as well as the difference between fats and oils.
You will also learn what cholesterol is and why it is an important molecule in the human body.
Fats and oils, found in many of the foods we eat, belong to a class of biomolecules known as lipids.
Gram for gram, they pack more than twice the caloric content of carbohydrates: the oxidation of fats and oils supplies about 9 kcal of energy for every gram oxidized, whereas the oxidation of carbohydrates supplies only 4 kcal/g.
Although the high caloric content of fats may be bad news for the dieter, it says something about the efficiency of nature’s designs.
Our bodies use carbohydrates, primarily in the form of glucose, for our immediate energy needs.
Our capacity for storing carbohydrates for later use is limited to tucking away a bit of glycogen in the liver or in muscle tissue.
We store our reserve energy in lipid form, which requires far less space than the same amount of energy stored in carbohydrate form.
Lipids have other biological functions besides energy storage.
They are a major component of the membranes of the 10 trillion cells in our bodies.
They serve as Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 923  protective padding and insulation for vital organs.
Furthermore, without lipids in our diets, we would be deficient in the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Lipids are not defined by the presence of specific functional groups, as carbohydrates are, but by a physical property—solubility.
Compounds isolated from body tissues are classified as lipids if they are more soluble in organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, than in water.
By this criterion, the lipid category includes not only fats and oils, which are esters of the trihydroxy alcohol glycerol and fatty acids, but also compounds that incorporate functional groups derived from phosphoric acid, carbohydrates, or amino alcohols, as well as steroid compounds such as cholesterol.
(Figure 17.1 "Lipid Organization Based on Structural Relationships" presents one scheme for classifying the various kinds of lipids.)
We will discuss the various kinds of lipids by considering one subclass at a time and pointing out structural similarities and differences as we go.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 924  Figure 17.1 Lipid Organization Based on Structural Relationships 17.1 Fatty Acids LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Recognize the structures of common fatty acids and classify them as saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated.
Fatty acids are carboxylic acids that are structural components of fats, oils, and all other categories of lipids, except steroids.
More than 70 have been identified in nature.
They usually contain an even number of carbon atoms (typically 12–20), are generally Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 925  unbranched, and can be classified by the presence and number of carbon-to-carbon double bonds.
Thus, saturated fatty acids contain no carbon-to-carbon double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids contain one carbon-to-carbon double bond, and polyunsaturated fatty acids contain two or more carbon-to-carbon double bonds.
Table 17.1 "Some Common Fatty Acids Found in Natural Fats" lists some common fatty acids and one important source for each.
The atoms or groups around the double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids can be arranged in either the cis or transisomeric form.
Naturally occurring fatty acids are generally in the cis configuration.
(For more information about cis-trans isomerism, see Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", Section 13.2 "Cis-Trans Isomers (Geometric Isomers)".)

Both substances are required for normal growth and development, but the human body does not synthesize them.
The body uses linoleic acid to synthesize many of the other unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, a precursor for the synthesis of prostaglandins.
In addition, the essential fatty acids are necessary for the efficient transport and metabolism of cholesterol.
The average daily diet should contain about 4– 6 g of the essential fatty acids.
To Your Health: Prostaglandins Prostaglandins are chemical messengers synthesized in the cells in which their physiological activity is expressed.
They are unsaturated fatty acids containing 20 carbon atoms and are synthesized from arachidonic acid—a polyunsaturated fatty acid— when needed by a particular cell.
They are called prostaglandins because they were originally isolated from semen found in the prostate gland.
It is now known that they are synthesized in nearly all mammalian tissues and affect almost all organs in the body.
The five major classes of prostaglandins are designated as PGA, PGB, PGE, PGF, and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 927  PGI.
Subscripts are attached at the end of these abbreviations to denote the number of double bonds outside the five-carbon ring in a given prostaglandin.
The prostaglandins are among the most potent biological substances known.
Slight structural differences give them highly distinct biological effects; however, all prostaglandins exhibit some ability to induce smooth muscle contraction, lower blood pressure, and contribute to the inflammatory response.
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen, obstruct the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, the enzyme needed for the initial step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.
Their wide range of physiological activity has led to the synthesis of hundreds of prostaglandins and their analogs.
Derivatives of PGE are now used in the United States 2 to induce labor.
Other prostaglandins have been employed clinically to lower or increase blood pressure, inhibit stomach secretions, relieve nasal congestion, relieve asthma, and prevent the formation of blood clots, which are associated with heart attacks and strokes.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 928  Although we often draw the carbon atoms in a straight line, they actually have more of a zigzag configuration (part (a) of Figure 17.2 "The Structure of Saturated Fatty Acids").
Viewed as a whole, however, the saturated fatty acid molecule is relatively straight (part (b) of Figure 17.2 "The Structure of Saturated Fatty Acids").
Such molecules pack closely together into a crystal lattice, maximizing the strength of dispersion forces and causing fatty acids and the fats derived from them to have relatively high melting points.
In contrast, each cis carbon-to-carbon double bond in an unsaturated fatty acid produces a pronounced bend in the molecule, so that these molecules do not stack neatly.
As a result, the intermolecular attractions of unsaturated fatty acids (and unsaturated fats) are weaker, causing these substances to have lower melting points.
Most are liquids at room temperature.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 929  Figure 17.2 The Structure of Saturated Fatty Acids (a) There is a zigzag pattern formed by the carbon-to-carbon single bonds in the ball- and-stick model of a palmitic acid molecule.
(b) A space-filling model of palmitic acid shows the overall straightness of a saturated fatty acid molecule.
Waxes are esters formed from long-chain fatty acids and long-chain alcohols.
Most natural waxes are mixtures of such esters.
Plant waxes on the surfaces of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits protect the plant from dehydration and invasion by harmful microorganisms.
Carnauba wax, used extensively in floor waxes, automobile waxes, and furniture polish, is largely myricyl cerotate, obtained from the leaves of certain Brazilian palm trees.
Animals also produce waxes that serve as protective coatings, keeping the surfaces of feathers, skin, and hair pliable and water repellent.
In fact, if the waxy coating on the feathers of a water bird is dissolved as a result of the bird swimming in an oil slick, the feathers become wet and heavy, and the bird, unable to maintain its buoyancy, drowns.

Why do unsaturated fatty acids have lower melting points than saturated fatty acids?
ANSWERS 1. a. stearic acid (answers will vary) b. linoleic acid (answers will vary) c. palmitoleic acid (answers will vary) 2.
Unsaturated fatty acids cannot pack as tightly together as saturated fatty acids due to the presence of the cis double bond that puts a “kink” or bend in the hydrocarbon chain.

17.2 Fats and Oils LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain why fats and oils are referred to as triglycerides.
2.
Explain how the fatty acid composition of the triglycerides determines whether a substance is a fat or oil.
3.
Describe the importance of key reactions of triglycerides, such as hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and oxidation.
Fats and oils are the most abundant lipids in nature.
They provide energy for living organisms, insulate body organs, and transport fat-soluble vitamins through the blood.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 934  Structures of Fats and Oils Fats and oils are called triglycerides (or triacylcylgerols) because they are esters composed of three fatty acid units joined to glycerol, a trihydroxy alcohol: If all three OH groups on the glycerol molecule are esterified with the same fatty acid, the resulting ester is called a simple triglyceride.
Although simple triglycerides have been synthesized in the laboratory, they rarely occur in nature.
Instead, a typical triglyceride obtained from naturally occurring fats and oils contains two or three different fatty acid components and is thus termed a mixed triglyceride.
A triglyceride is called a fat if it is a solid at 25°C; it is called an oil if it is a liquid at that temperature.
These differences in melting points reflect differences in the degree of unsaturation and number of carbon atoms in the constituent fatty acids.
Triglycerides obtained from animal sources are usually solids, while those of plant origin are generally oils.
Therefore, we commonly speak of animal fats and vegetable oils.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 935  No single formula can be written to represent the naturally occurring fats and oils because they are highly complex mixtures of triglycerides in which many different fatty acids are represented.
Table 17.2 "Average Fatty Acid Composition of Some Common Fats and Oils (%)*" shows the fatty acid compositions of some common fats and oils.
The composition of any given fat or oil can vary depending on the plant or animal species it comes from as well as on dietetic and climatic factors.
To cite just one example, lard from corn-fed hogs is more highly saturated than lard from peanut-fed hogs.
Palmitic acid is the most abundant of the saturated fatty acids, while oleic acid is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid.

†Coconut oil is highly saturated.
It contains an unusually high percentage of the low-melting C , C , and C saturated fatty acids.
8 10 12 Terms such as saturated fat or unsaturated oil are often used to describe the fats or oils obtained from foods.
Saturated fats contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, while unsaturated oils contain a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids.
The high consumption of saturated fats is a factor, along with the high consumption of cholesterol, in increased risks of heart disease.
(For more information about cholesterol, see Section 17.4 "Steroids".)
Physical Properties of Fats and Oils Contrary to what you might expect, pure fats and oils are colorless, odorless, and tasteless.
The characteristic colors, odors, and flavors that we associate with some of them are imparted by foreign substances that are lipid soluble and have been absorbed by these lipids.
For example, the yellow color of butter is due to the presence of the pigment carotene; the taste of butter comes from two compounds—diacetyl and 3- hydroxy-2-butanone—produced by bacteria in the ripening cream from which the butter is made.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 937  Fats and oils are lighter than water, having densities of about 0.8 g/cm3.
They are poor conductors of heat and electricity and therefore serve as excellent insulators for the body, slowing the loss of heat through the skin.
Chemical Reactions of Fats and Oils Fats and oils can participate in a variety of chemical reactions—for example, because triglycerides are esters, they can be hydrolyzed in the presence of an acid, a base, or specific enzymes known as lipases.
The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base is used to make soap and is called saponification.
Today most soaps are prepared through the hydrolysis of triglycerides (often from tallow, coconut oil, or both) using water under high pressure and temperature [700 lb/in2 (∼50 atm or 5,000 kPa) and 200°C].
Sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide is then used to convert the fatty acids to their sodium salts (soap molecules): Looking Closer: Soaps Ordinary soap is a mixture of the sodium salts of various fatty acids, produced in one of the oldest organic syntheses practiced by humans (second only to the fermentation of sugars to produce ethyl alcohol).
Both the Phoenicians (600 BCE) and the Romans made soap from animal fat and wood ash.
Even so, the widespread production of soap did not begin until the 1700s.
Soap was traditionally made by treating molten lard or tallow with a slight excess of alkali in large open vats.
The mixture was heated, and steam was bubbled through it.
After saponification was completed, the soap was precipitated from the mixture by the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), removed by filtration, and washed several times with water.
It was then dissolved in water and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 938  reprecipitated by the addition of more NaCl.
The glycerol produced in the reaction was also recovered from the aqueous wash solutions.
Pumice or sand is added to produce scouring soap, while ingredients such as perfumes or dyes are added to produce fragrant, colored soaps.
Blowing air through molten soap produces a floating soap.
Soft soaps, made with potassium salts, are more expensive but produce a finer lather and are more soluble.
They are used in liquid soaps, shampoos, and shaving creams.
Dirt and grime usually adhere to skin, clothing, and other surfaces by combining with body oils, cooking fats, lubricating greases, and similar substances that act like glues.
Because these substances are not miscible in water, washing with water alone does little to remove them.
Soap removes them, however, because soap molecules have a dual nature.
One end, called the head, carries an ionic charge (a carboxylate anion) and therefore dissolves in water; the other end, the tail, has a hydrocarbon structure and dissolves in oils.
The hydrocarbon tails dissolve in the soil; the ionic heads remain in the aqueous phase, and the soap breaks the oil into tiny soap-enclosed droplets called micelles, which disperse throughout the solution.
(For more information about cell structure, see Section 17.3 "Membranes and Membrane Lipids".)
The droplets repel each other because of their charged surfaces and do not coalesce.
With the oil no longer “gluing” the dirt to the soiled surface (skin, cloth, dish), the soap-enclosed dirt can easily be rinsed away.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 939  The double bonds in fats and oils can undergo hydrogenation and also oxidation.
The hydrogenation of vegetable oils to produce semisolid fats is an important process in the food industry.
Chemically, it is essentially identical to the catalytic hydrogenation reaction described for alkenes in Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons", Section 13.4 "Chemical Properties of Alkenes".
In commercial processes, the number of double bonds that are hydrogenated is carefully controlled to produce fats with the desired consistency (soft and pliable).
Inexpensive and abundant vegetable oils (canola, corn, soybean) are thus transformed into margarine and cooking fats.
In the preparation of margarine, for example, partially hydrogenated oils are mixed with water, salt, and nonfat dry milk, along with flavoring agents, coloring agents, and vitamins A and D, which are added to approximate the look, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 940  taste, and nutrition of butter.
(Preservatives and antioxidants are also added.)
In most commercial peanut butter, the peanut oil has been partially hydrogenated to prevent it from separating out.
Consumers could decrease the amount of saturated fat in their diet by using the original unprocessed oils on their foods, but most people would rather spread margarine on their toast than pour oil on it.
Many people have switched from butter to margarine or vegetable shortening because of concerns that saturated animal fats can raise blood cholesterol levels and result in clogged arteries.
However, during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, an isomerization reaction occurs that produces the trans fatty acids mentioned in the opening essay.
However, studies have shown that trans fatty acids also raise cholesterol levels and increase the incidence of heart disease.
Trans fatty acids do not have the bend in their structures, which occurs in cis fatty acids and thus pack closely together in the same way that the saturated fatty acids do.
Consumers are now being advised to use polyunsaturated oils and soft or liquid margarine and reduce their total fat consumption to less than 30% of their total calorie intake each day.
Fats and oils that are in contact with moist air at room temperature eventually undergo oxidation and hydrolysis reactions that cause them to turn rancid, acquiring a characteristic disagreeable odor.
One cause of the odor is the release of volatile fatty acids by hydrolysis of the ester bonds.
Butter, for example, releases foul-smelling butyric, caprylic, and capric acids.
Microorganisms present in the air furnish lipases that catalyze this process.
Hydrolytic rancidity can easily be prevented by covering the fat or oil and keeping it in a refrigerator.
Another cause of volatile, odorous compounds is the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acid components, particularly the readily oxidized structural unit in polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids.
One particularly offensive product, formed by the oxidative cleavage of both double bonds in this unit, is a compound called malonaldehyde.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 941  Rancidity is a major concern of the food industry, which is why food chemists are always seeking new and better antioxidants, substances added in very small amounts (0.001%–0.01%) to prevent oxidation and thus suppress rancidity.
Antioxidants are compounds whose affinity for oxygen is greater than that of the lipids in the food; thus they function by preferentially depleting the supply of oxygen absorbed into the product.
Because vitamin E has antioxidant properties, it helps reduce damage to lipids in the body, particularly to unsaturated fatty acids found in cell membrane lipids.

17.3 Membranes and Membrane Lipids LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Identify the distinguishing characteristics of membrane lipids.
2.
Describe membrane components and how they are arranged.
All living cells are surrounded by a cell membrane.
Plant cells (Figure 17.3 "An Idealized Plant Cell") and animal cells (Figure 17.4 "An Idealized Animal Cell") contain a cell nucleus that is also surrounded by a membrane and holds the genetic information for the cell.
(For more information about genetics and DNA, see Chapter 19 "Nucleic Acids".)
Everything between the cell membrane and the nuclear membrane—including Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 947  intracellular fluids and various subcellular components such as the mitochondria and ribosomes—is called the cytoplasm.
The membranes of all cells have a fundamentally similar structure, but membrane function varies tremendously from one organism to another and even from one cell to another within a single organism.
This diversity arises mainly from the presence of different proteins and lipids in the membrane.
Figure 17.3 An Idealized Plant Cell Not all the structures shown here occur in every type of plant cell.
Figure 17.4 An Idealized Animal Cell Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 948  The structures shown here will seldom all be found in a single animal cell.
The lipids in cell membranes are highly polar but have dual characteristics: part of the lipid is ionic and therefore dissolves in water, whereas the rest has a hydrocarbon structure and therefore dissolves in nonpolar substances.
Often, the ionic part is referred to as hydrophilic, meaning “water loving,” and the nonpolar part as hydrophobic, meaning “water fearing” (repelled by water).
When allowed to float freely in water, polar lipids spontaneously cluster together in any one of three arrangements: micelles, monolayers, and bilayers (Figure 17.5 "Spontaneously Formed Polar Lipid Structures in Water: Monolayer, Micelle, and Bilayer").
Micelles are aggregations in which the lipids’ hydrocarbon tails—being hydrophobic—are directed toward the center of the assemblage and away from the surrounding water while the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 949  hydrophilic heads are directed outward, in contact with the water.
Each micelle may contain thousands of lipid molecules.
Polar lipids may also form a monolayer, a layer one molecule thick on the surface of the water.
The polar heads face into water, and the nonpolar tails stick up into the air.
Bilayers are double layers of lipids arranged so that the hydrophobic tails are sandwiched between an inner surface and an outer surface consisting of hydrophilic heads.
The hydrophilic heads are in contact with water on either side of the bilayer, whereas the tails, sequestered inside the bilayer, are prevented from having contact with the water.
Bilayers like this make up every cell membrane (Figure 17.6 "Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane").
Figure 17.5 Spontaneously Formed Polar Lipid Structures in Water: Monolayer, Micelle, and Bilayer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 950  Figure 17.6 Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane The membrane enclosing a typical animal cell is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded cholesterol and protein molecules.
Short oligosaccharide chains are attached to the outer surface.
In the bilayer interior, the hydrophobic tails (that is, the fatty acid portions of lipid molecules) interact by means of dispersion forces.
The interactions are weakened by the presence of unsaturated fatty acids.
As a result, the membrane components are free to mill about to some extent, and the membrane is described as fluid.
The lipids found in cell membranes can be categorized in various ways.
Phospholipids are lipids containing phosphorus.
Glycolipids are sugar-containing lipids.
The latter are found exclusively on the outer surface of the cell membrane, acting as distinguishing surface markers for the cell and thus serving in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication.
Sphingolipids are phospholipids or glycolipids that contain the unsaturated amino alcohol sphingosine rather than glycerol.
Diagrammatic structures of representative membrane lipids are presented in Figure 17.7 "Component Structures of Some Important Membrane Lipids".
Figure 17.7 Component Structures of Some Important Membrane Lipids Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 951  Phosphoglycerides (also known as glycerophospholipids) are the most abundant phospholipids in cell membranes.
They consist of a glycerol unit with fatty acids attached to the first two carbon atoms, while a phosphoric acid unit, esterified with an alcohol molecule (usually an amino alcohol, as in part (a) of Figure 17.8 "Phosphoglycerides") is attached to the third carbon atom of glycerol (part (b) ofFigure 17.8 "Phosphoglycerides").
Notice that the phosphoglyceride molecule is identical to a triglyceride up to the phosphoric acid unit (part (b) of Figure 17.8 "Phosphoglycerides").
Figure 17.8 Phosphoglycerides Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 952  (a) Amino alcohols are commonly found in phosphoglycerides, which are evident in its structural formula (b).
There are two common types of phosphoglycerides.
Phosphoglycerides containing ethanolamine as the amino alcohol are called phosphatidylethanolamines orcephalins.
Cephalins are found in brain tissue and nerves and also have a role in blood clotting.
Phosphoglycerides containing choline as the amino alcohol unit are called phosphatidylcholines or lecithins.
Lecithins occur in all living organisms.
Like cephalins, they are important constituents of nerve and brain tissue.
Egg yolks are especially rich in lecithins.
Commercial-grade lecithins isolated from soybeans are widely used in foods as emulsifying agents.
An emulsifying agent is used to stabilize an emulsion—a dispersion of two liquids that do not normally mix, such as oil and water.
Many foods are emulsions.
Milk is an emulsion of butterfat in water.
The emulsifying agent in milk is a protein called casein.
Mayonnaise is an emulsion of salad oil in water, stabilized by lecithins present in egg yolk.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 953  Sphingomyelins, the simplest sphingolipids, each contain a fatty acid, a phosphoric acid, sphingosine, and choline (Figure 17.9 "Sphingolipids").
Because they contain phosphoric acid, they are also classified as phospholipids.
Sphingomyelins are important constituents of the myelin sheath surrounding the axon of a nerve cell.
Multiple sclerosis is one of several diseases resulting from damage to the myelin sheath.
Figure 17.9 Sphingolipids Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 954  (a) Sphingosine, an amino alcohol, is found in all sphingolipids.
(b) A sphingomyelin is also known as a phospholipid, as evidenced by the phosphoric acid unit in its structure.
Most animal cells contain sphingolipids called cerebrosides (Figure 17.10 "Cerebrosides").
Cerebrosides are composed of sphingosine, a fatty acid, and galactose or glucose.
They therefore resemble sphingomyelins but have a sugar unit in place of the choline phosphate group.
Cerebrosides are important constituents of the membranes of nerve and brain cells.
Figure 17.10 Cerebrosides Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 955  Cerebrosides are sphingolipids that contain a sugar unit.
The sphingolipids called gangliosides are more complex, usually containing a branched chain of three to eight monosaccharides and/or substituted sugars.
Because of considerable variation in their sugar components, about 130 varieties of gangliosides have been identified.
Most cell-to-cell recognition and communication processes (e.g., blood group antigens) depend on differences in the sequences of sugars in these compounds.
Gangliosides are most prevalent in the outer membranes of nerve cells, although they also occur in smaller quantities in the outer membranes of most other cells.
Because cerebrosides and gangliosides contain sugar groups, they are also classified as glycolipids.
Membrane Proteins If membranes were composed only of lipids, very few ions or polar molecules could pass through their hydrophobic “sandwich filling” to enter or leave any cell.
However, certain charged and polar species do cross the membrane, aided by proteins that move about in the lipid bilayer.
The two major classes of proteins in the cell membrane are integral proteins, which span the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer, and peripheral proteins, which are more loosely associated with the surface of the lipid bilayer (Figure 17.6 "Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane").
Peripheral proteins may be attached to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 956  integral proteins, to the polar head groups of phospholipids, or to both by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces.
Small ions and molecules soluble in water enter and leave the cell by way of channels through the integral proteins.
Some proteins, called carrier proteins, facilitate the passage of certain molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, by specific interactions between the protein and the molecule being transported.

Lecithin acts as an emulsifying agent that aids in the mixing of the hot cocoa mix with water and keeps the cocoa mix evenly distributed after stirring.

Identify the functions of steroids produced in mammals.
All the lipids discussed so far are saponifiable, reacting with aqueous alkali to yield simpler components, such as glycerol, fatty acids, amino alcohols, and sugars.
(For more information about saponification, see Section 17.2 "Fats and Oils".)
Lipid samples extracted from cellular material, however, also contain a small but important fraction that does not react with alkali.
The most important nonsaponifiable lipids are the steroids.
These compounds include the bile salts, cholesterol and related compounds, and certain hormones (such as cortisone and the sex hormones).
Figure 17.11 Steroids (a) The four-fused-ring steroid skeleton uses letter designations for each ring and the numbering of the carbon atoms.
(b) The cholesterol molecule follows this pattern.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 961  Steroids occur in plants, animals, yeasts, and molds but not in bacteria.
They may exist in free form or combined with fatty acids or carbohydrates.
All steroids have a characteristic structural component consisting of four fused rings.
Chemists identify the rings by capital letters and number the carbon atoms as shown in part (a) of Figure 17.11 "Steroids".
Slight variations in this structure or in the atoms or groups attached to it produce profound differences in biological activity.
Cholesterol Cholesterol (part (b) of Figure 17.11 "Steroids") does not occur in plants, but it is the most abundant steroid in the human body (240 g is a typical amount).
Excess cholesterol is believed to be a primary factor in the development of atherosclerosis and heart disease, which are major health problems in the United States today.
About half of the body’s cholesterol is interspersed in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes (Figure 17.6 "Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane").
Much of the rest is converted to cholic acid, which is used in the formation of bile salts.
Cholesterol is also a precursor in the synthesis of sex hormones, adrenal hormones, and vitamin D. Excess cholesterol not metabolized by the body is released from the liver and transported by the blood to the gallbladder.
Normally, it stays in solution there until being secreted into the intestine (as a component of bile) to be eliminated.
Sometimes, however, cholesterol in the gallbladder precipitates in the form of gallstones.
Indeed, the name cholesterol is derived from the Greek chole, meaning “bile,” and stereos, meaning “solid.” To Your Health: Cholesterol and Heart Disease Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that heart disease claimed 631,636 lives in the United States (26% of all reported deaths) in 2006.
Scientists agree that elevated cholesterol levels in the blood, as well as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and cigarette smoking, are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
A long-term investigation by the National Institutes of Health showed that among men ages 30 to 49, the incidence of heart disease was five times greater for those whose cholesterol levels were above 260 mg/100 mL of serum than for those with Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 962  cholesterol levels of 200 mg/100 mL or less.
The cholesterol content of blood varies considerably with age, diet, and sex.
Young adults average about 170 mg of cholesterol per 100 mL of blood, whereas males at age 55 may have cholesterol levels at 250 mg/100 mL or higher because the rate of cholesterol breakdown decreases with age.
Females tend to have lower blood cholesterol levels than males.
To understand the link between heart disease and cholesterol levels, it is important to understand how cholesterol and other lipids are transported in the body.
Lipids, such as cholesterol, are not soluble in water and therefore cannot be transported in the blood (an aqueous medium) unless they are complexed with proteins that are soluble in water, forming assemblages called lipoproteins.
Lipoproteins are classified according to their density, which is dependent on the relative amounts of protein and lipid they contain.
Lipids are less dense than proteins, so lipoproteins containing a greater proportion of lipid are less dense than those containing a greater proportion of protein.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 963  Research on cholesterol and its role in heart disease has focused on serum levels of low- density lipoproteins (LDLs) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).
One of the most fascinating discoveries is that high levels of HDLs reduce a person’s risk of developing heart disease, whereas high levels of LDLs increase that risk.
Thus the serum LDL:HDL ratio is a better predictor of heart disease risk than the overall level of serum cholesterol.
Persons who, because of hereditary or dietary factors, have high LDL:HDL ratios in their blood have a higher incidence of heart disease.
How do HDLs reduce the risk of developing heart disease?
No one knows for sure, but one role of HDLs appears to be the transport of excess cholesterol to the liver, where it can be metabolized.
Therefore, HDLs aid in removing cholesterol from blood and from the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall.
Dietary modifications and increased physical activity can help lower total cholesterol and improve the LDL:HDL ratio.
The average American consumes about 600 mg of cholesterol from animal products each day and also synthesizes approximately 1 g of cholesterol each day, mostly in the liver.
The amount of cholesterol synthesized is controlled by the cholesterol level in the blood; when the blood cholesterol level exceeds 150 mg/100 mL, the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis is halved.
Hence, if cholesterol is present in the diet, a feedback mechanism suppresses its synthesis in the liver.
However, the ratio of suppression is not a 1:1 ratio; the reduction in biosynthesis does not equal the amount of cholesterol ingested.
Thus, dietary substitutions of unsaturated fat for saturated fat, as well as a reduction in consumption of trans fatty acids, is recommended to help lower serum cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
Steroid Hormones Hormones are chemical messengers that are released in one tissue and transported through the circulatory system to one or more other tissues.
One group of hormones is known as steroid hormones because these hormones are synthesized from cholesterol, which is also a steroid.
There are two main groups of steroid hormones: adrenocortical hormones and sex hormones.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 964  The adrenocortical hormones, such as aldosterone and cortisol (Table 17.3 "Representative Steroid Hormones and Their Physiological Effects"), are produced by the adrenal gland, which is located adjacent to each kidney.
Aldosterone acts on most cells in the body, but it is particularly effective at enhancing the rate of reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidney tubules and increasing the secretion of potassium ions and/or hydrogen ions by the tubules.
Because the concentration of sodium ions is the major factor influencing water retention in tissues, aldosterone promotes water retention and reduces urine output.
Cortisol regulates several key metabolic reactions (for example, increasing glucose production and mobilizing fatty acids and amino acids).
It also inhibits the inflammatory response of tissue to injury or stress.
Cortisol and its analogs are therefore used pharmacologically as immunosuppressants after transplant operations and in the treatment of severe skin allergies and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Table 17.3 Representative Steroid Hormones and Their Physiological Effects Hormone Effect regulates salt metabolism; stimulates kidneys to retain sodium and excrete potassium stimulates the conversion of proteins to carbohydrates Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 965  Hormone Effect regulates the menstrual cycle; maintains pregnancy stimulates female sex characteristics; regulates changes during the menstrual cycle stimulates and maintains male sex characteristics The sex hormones are a class of steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (ovaries or testes), the placenta, and the adrenal glands.
Testosterone and androstenedione are the primary male sex hormones, or androgens, controlling the primary sexual Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 966  characteristics of males, or the development of the male genital organs and the continuous production of sperm.
Androgens are also responsible for the development of secondary male characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle strength.
Two kinds of sex hormones are of particular importance in females: progesterone, which prepares the uterus for pregnancy and prevents the further release of eggs from the ovaries during pregnancy, and the estrogens, which are mainly responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and increased deposition of fat tissue in the breasts, the buttocks, and the thighs.
Both males and females produce androgens and estrogens, differing in the amounts of secreted hormones rather than in the presence or absence of one or the other.
Sex hormones, both natural and synthetic, are sometimes used therapeutically.
For example, a woman who has had her ovaries removed may be given female hormones to compensate.
Some of the earliest chemical compounds employed in cancer chemotherapy were sex hormones.
For example, estrogens are one treatment option for prostate cancer because they block the release and activity of testosterone.
Testosterone enhances prostate cancer growth.
Sex hormones are also administered in preparation for sex-change operations, to promote the development of the proper secondary sexual characteristics.
Oral contraceptives are synthetic derivatives of the female sex hormones; they work by preventing ovulation.
Bile Salts Bile is a yellowish green liquid (pH 7.8–8.6) produced in the liver.
The most important constituents of bile are bile salts, which are sodium salts of amidelike combinations of bile acids, such as cholic acid (part (a) of Figure 17.12 "Bile Acids") and an amine such as the amino acid glycine (part (b) of Figure 17.12 "Bile Acids").
They are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and then secreted in bile into the small intestine.
In the gallbladder, the composition of bile gradually changes as water is absorbed and the other components become more concentrated.
Figure 17.12 Bile Acids Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 967  (a) Cholic acid is an example of a bile acid.
(b) Sodium glycocholate is a bile salt synthesized from cholic acid and glycine.
Because they contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, bile salts are highly effective detergents and emulsifying agents; they break down large fat globules into smaller ones and keep those smaller globules suspended in the aqueous digestive environment.
Enzymes can then hydrolyze fat molecules more efficiently.
Thus, the major function of bile salts is to aid in the digestion of dietary lipids.
Note Surgical removal is often advised for a gallbladder that becomes infected, inflamed, or perforated.
This surgery does not seriously affect digestion because bile is still produced Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 968  by the liver, but the liver’s bile is more dilute and its secretion into the small intestine is not as closely tied to the arrival of food.

17.5 End-of-Chapter Material Chapter Summary To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.
Lipids, found in the body tissues of all organisms, are compounds that are more soluble in organic solvents than in water.
Many of them contain fatty acids, which are carboxylic acids that generally contain an even number of 4–20 carbon atoms in an unbranched chain.
Saturated fatty acids have no carbon-to-carbon double bonds.
Monounsaturated fatty acids have a single carbon-to-carbon double bond, while polyunsaturated fatty acids have more than one carbon-to-carbon double bond.
Linoleic and linolenic acid are known asessential fatty acids because the human body cannot synthesize these polyunsaturated fatty acids.
The lipids known as fats and oils are triacylglycerols, more commonly called triglycerides—esters composed of three fatty acids joined to the trihydroxy alcohol glycerol.
Fats are triglycerides that are solid at room temperature, and oils are triglycerides that are liquid at room temperature.
Fats are found mainly in animals, and oils found mainly in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 971  plants.Saturated triglycerides are those containing a higher proportion of saturated fatty acid chains (fewer carbon-to-carbon double bonds); unsaturated triglyceridescontain a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acid chains.
Saponification is the hydrolysis of a triglyceride in a basic solution to form glycerol and three carboxylate anions or soap molecules.
Other important reactions are the hydrogenation and oxidation of double bonds in unsaturated fats and oils.
Phospholipids are lipids containing phosphorus.
In phosphoglycerides, the phosphorus is joined to an amino alcohol unit.
Some phosphoglycerides, like lecithins, are used to stabilize an emulsion—a dispersion of two liquids that do not normally mix, such as oil and water.
Sphingolipids are lipids for which the precursor is the amino alcohol sphingosine, rather than glycerol.
A glycolipidhas a sugar substituted at one of the OH groups of either glycerol or sphingosine.
All are highly polar lipids found in cell membranes.
Polar lipids have dual characteristics: one part of the molecule is ionic and dissolves in water; the rest has a hydrocarbon structure and dissolves in nonpolar substances.
Often, the ionic part is referred to as hydrophilic (literally, “water loving”) and the nonpolar part as hydrophobic (“water fearing”).
When placed in water, polar lipids disperse into any one of three arrangements: micelles,monolayers, and bilayers.
Micelles are aggregations of molecules in which the hydrocarbon tails of the lipids, being hydrophobic, are directed inward (away from the surrounding water), and the hydrophilic heads that are directed outward into the water.
Bilayers are double layers arranged so that the hydrophobic tails are sandwiched between the two layers of hydrophilic heads, which remain in contact with the water.
Every living cell is enclosed by a cell membrane composed of a lipid bilayer.
In animal cells, the bilayer consists mainly of phospholipids, glycolipids, and the steroid cholesterol.
Embedded in the bilayer are integral proteins, andperipheral proteins are loosely associated with the surface of the bilayer.
Everything between the cell membrane and the membrane of the cell nucleus is called the cytoplasm.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 972  Most lipids can be saponified, but some, such as steroids, cannot be saponified.
The steroid cholesterol is found in animal cells but never in plant cells.
It is a main component of all cell membranes and a precursor for hormones, vitamin D, and bile salts.
Bile salts are the most important constituents of bile, which is a yellowish-green liquid secreted by the gallbladder into the small intestine and is needed for the proper digestion of lipids.

Why is it important to determine the ratio of LDLs to HDLs, rather than just the concentration of serum cholesterol?
ANSWERS 1. a. Stearic acid has the highest melting point, followed by elaidic acid, and then oleic acid with the lowest melting point.
Elaidic acid is a trans fatty acid, and the carbon chains can pack together almost as tightly as those of the saturated stearic acid.
Oleic acid is a cis fatty acid, and the bend in the hydrocarbon chain keeps these carbon chains from packing as closely together; fewer interactions lead to a much lower melting point.
b.
The melting point of palmitelaidic acid should be lower than that of elaidic acid because it has a shorter carbon chain (16, as compared to 18 for elaidic acid).
The shorter the carbon chain, the lower the melting point due to a decrease in intermolecular interactions.

In 1958, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Frederick Sanger for his discoveries concerning the structure of proteins and, in particular, the structure of insulin.
What is so important about insulin that two Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on this protein?
Insulin is a hormone that is synthesized in the pancreas.
(For more information about hormones, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.4 "Steroids".)
Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into cells throughout the body and the storage of glucose as glycogen.
People with diabetes do not produce insulin or use it properly.
The isolation of insulin in 1921 led to the first effective treatment for these individuals.
Proteins may be defined as compounds of high molar mass consisting largely or entirely of chains of amino acids.
Their masses range from several thousand to several million daltons (Da).
In addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, all proteins contain nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and many also contain phosphorus atoms and traces of other elements.
Proteins serve a variety of roles in living organisms and are often classified by these biological roles, which are summarized in Table 18.1 "Classification of Proteins by Biological Function".
Muscle tissue is largely protein, as are skin and hair.
Proteins are present in the blood, in the brain, and even in tooth enamel.
Each type of cell in our bodies makes its own specialized proteins, as well as proteins common to all or most cells.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 978  18.1 Properties of Amino Acids LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Recognize amino acids and classify them based on the characteristics of their side chains.
The proteins in all living species, from bacteria to humans, are constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids, so called because each contains an amino group attached to a carboxylic acid.
(For more information about amino groups, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch15, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s01.)
The amino acids in proteins are α-amino acids, which means the amino group is attached to the α- carbon of the carboxylic acid.
(For more information about the α-carbon, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s02.)
Humans can synthesize only about half of the needed amino acids; the remainder must be obtained from the diet and are known as essential amino acids.
Note Two more amino acids have been found in limited quantities in proteins.
Selenocysteine was discovered in 1986, while pyrrolysine was discovered in 2002.
The amino acids are colorless, nonvolatile, crystalline solids, melting and decomposing at temperatures above 200°C.
These melting temperatures are more like those of inorganic salts than those of amines or organic acids and indicate that the structures of the amino acids in the solid state and in neutral solution are best represented as having both a negatively charged group and a positively charged group.
Such a species is known as a zwitterion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 979  Classification In addition to the amino and carboxyl groups, amino acids have a side chain or R group attached to the α-carbon.
Each amino acid has unique characteristics arising from the size, shape, solubility, and ionization properties of its R group.
As a result, the side chains of amino acids exert a profound effect on the structure and biological activity of proteins.
Although amino acids can be classified in various ways, one common approach is to classify them according to whether the functional group on the side chain at neutral pH is nonpolar, polar but uncharged, negatively charged, or positively charged.
The structures and names of the 20 amino acids, their one- and three-letter abbreviations, and some of their distinctive features are given in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s01_s01_t01.

It was obtained from protein found in asparagus juice (hence the name).
Glycine, the major amino acid found in gelatin, was named for its sweet taste (Greek glykys, meaning “sweet”).
In some cases an amino acid found in a protein is actually a derivative of one of the common 20 amino acids (one such derivative is hydroxyproline).
The modification occurs after the amino acid has been assembled into a protein.
Configuration Notice in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s01_s01_t01that glycine is the only amino acid whose α-carbon is not chiral.
Therefore, with the exception of glycine, the amino acids could theoretically exist in either the D- or the L-enantiomeric form and rotate plane-polarized light.
As with sugars, chemists use glyceraldehyde as Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 987  the reference compound for the assignment of configuration to amino acids.
(For more information about stereoisomers and configuration, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch16, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16_s02.)
Its structure closely resembles an amino acid structure except that in the latter, an amino group takes the place of the OH group on the chiral carbon of the sugar.
We learned in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch16that all naturally occurring sugars belong to the D series.
It is interesting, therefore, that nearly all known plant and animal proteins are composed entirely of L-amino acids.
However, certain bacteria contain D-amino acids in their cell walls, and several antibiotics (e.g., actinomycin D and the gramicidins) contain varying amounts of D-leucine, D- phenylalanine, and D-valine.

Explain how an amino acid can act as both an acid and a base.
The structure of an amino acid allows it to act as both an acid and a base.
An amino acid has this ability because at a certain pH value (different for each amino acid) nearly all the amino acid molecules exist as zwitterions.
If acid is added to a solution containing the zwitterion, the carboxylate group captures a hydrogen (H+) ion, and the amino acid becomes positively charged.
If base is added, ion removal of the H+ ion from the amino group of the zwitterion produces a negatively charged amino acid.
In both Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 992  circumstances, the amino acid acts to maintain the pH of the system—that is, to remove the added acid (H+) or base (OH−) from solution.
EXAMPLE 1 1.
Draw the structure for the anion formed when glycine (at neutral pH) reacts with a base.
2.
Draw the structure for the cation formed when glycine (at neutral pH) reacts with an acid.
Solution 1.

Draw the structure for the cation formed when valine (at neutral pH) reacts with an acid.
2.
Draw the structure for the anion formed when valine (at neutral pH) reacts with a base.
The particular pH at which a given amino acid exists in solution as a zwitterion is called the isoelectric point (pI).
At its pI, the positive and negative charges on the amino acid balance, and the molecule as a whole is electrically neutral.
The amino acids whose side chains are always neutral have isoelectric points ranging from 5.0 to 6.5.
The basic amino acids (which have positively charged side chains at neutral pH) have relatively high pIs.
Acidic amino acids (which have negatively charged side chains at neutral pH) have quite low pIs (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s02_t01).
Table 18.3 pIs of Some Representative Amino Acids Amino Acid Classification pI alanine nonpolar 6.0 valine nonpolar 6.0 serine polar, uncharged 5.7 threonine polar, uncharged 6.5 arginine positively charged (basic) 10.8 histidine positively charged (basic) 7.6 lysine positively charged (basic) 9.8 aspartic acid negatively charged (acidic) 3.0 glutamic acid negatively charged (acidic) 3.2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 994  Amino acids undergo reactions characteristic of carboxylic acids and amines.
The reactivity of these functional groups is particularly important in linking amino acids together to form peptides and proteins, as you will see later in this chapter.
Simple chemical tests that are used to detect amino acids take advantage of the reactivity of these functional groups.
An example is the ninhydrin test in which the amine functional group of α-amino acids reacts with ninhydrin to form purple-colored compounds.
Ninhydrin is used to detect fingerprints because it reacts with amino acids from the proteins in skin cells transferred to the surface by the individual leaving the fingerprint.

ANSWER 1. a. b. c. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 997  18.3 Peptides LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain how a peptide is formed from individual amino acids.
2.
Explain why the sequence of amino acids in a protein is important.
Two or more amino acids can join together into chains called peptides.
In http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch15_s16, we discussed the reaction between ammonia and a carboxylic acid to form an amide.
In a similar reaction, the amino group on one amino acid molecule reacts with the carboxyl group on another, releasing a molecule of water and forming an amide linkage: An amide bond joining two amino acid units is called a peptide bond.
Note that the product molecule still has a reactive amino group on the left and a reactive carboxyl Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 998  group on the right.
These can react with additional amino acids to lengthen the peptide.
The process can continue until thousands of units have joined, resulting in large proteins.
A chain consisting of only two amino acid units is called a dipeptide; a chain consisting of three is a tripeptide.
By convention, peptide and protein structures are depicted with the amino acid whose amino group is free (the N-terminal end) on the left and the amino acid with a free carboxyl group (the C-terminal end) to the right.
The general term peptide refers to an amino acid chain of unspecified length.
However, chains of about 50 amino acids or more are usually called proteins or polypeptides.
In its physiologically active form, a protein may be composed of one or more polypeptide chains.
For peptides and proteins to be physiologically active, it is not enough that they incorporate certain amounts of specific amino acids.
The order, or sequence, in which the amino acids are connected is also of critical importance.
Bradykinin is a nine-amino acid peptide produced in the blood that has the following amino acid sequence: arg-pro-pro-gly-phe-ser-pro-phe-arg This peptide lowers blood pressure, stimulates smooth muscle tissue, increases capillary permeability, and causes pain.
When the order of amino acids in bradykinin is reversed, arg-phe-pro-ser-phe-gly-pro-pro-arg the peptide resulting from this synthesis shows none of the activity of bradykinin.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 999  Just as millions of different words are spelled with our 26-letter English alphabet, millions of different proteins are made with the 20 common amino acids.
However, just as the English alphabet can be used to write gibberish, amino acids can be put together in the wrong sequence to produce nonfunctional proteins.
Although the correct sequence is ordinarily of utmost importance, it is not always absolutely required.
Just as you can sometimes make sense of incorrectly spelled English words, a protein with a small percentage of “incorrect” amino acids may continue to function.
However, it rarely functions as well as a protein having the correct sequence.
There are also instances in which seemingly minor errors of sequence have disastrous effects.
For example, in some people, every molecule of hemoglobin (a protein in the blood that transports oxygen) has a single incorrect amino acid unit out of about 300 (a single valine replaces a glutamic acid).
That “minor” error is responsible for sickle cell anemia, an inherited condition that usually is fatal.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1002  Each of the thousands of naturally occurring proteins has its own characteristic amino acid composition and sequence that result in a unique three-dimensional shape.
Since the 1950s, scientists have determined the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional conformation of numerous proteins and thus obtained important clues on how each protein performs its specific function in the body.
Proteins are compounds of high molar mass consisting largely or entirely of chains of amino acids.
Because of their great complexity, protein molecules cannot be classified on the basis of specific structural similarities, as carbohydrates and lipids are categorized.
The two major structural classifications of proteins are based on far more general qualities: whether the protein is (1) fiberlike and insoluble or (2) globular and soluble.
Some proteins, such as those that compose hair, skin, muscles, and connective tissue, are fiberlike.
These fibrous proteins are insoluble in water and usually serve structural, connective, and protective functions.
Examples of fibrous proteins are keratins, collagens, myosins, and elastins.
Hair and the outer layer of skin are composed of keratin.
Connective tissues contain collagen.
Myosins are muscle proteins and are capable of contraction and extension.
Elastins are found in ligaments and the elastic tissue of artery walls.
Globular proteins, the other major class, are soluble in aqueous media.
In these proteins, the chains are folded so that the molecule as a whole is roughly spherical.
Familiar examples include egg albumin from egg whites and serum albumin in blood.
Serum albumin plays a major role in transporting fatty acids and maintaining a proper balance of osmotic pressures in the body.
Hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are important for binding oxygen, are also globular proteins.
Levels of Protein Structure The structure of proteins is generally described as having four organizational levels.
The first of these is the primary structure, which is the number and sequence of amino acids in a protein’s polypeptide chain or chains, beginning with the free amino group and maintained by the peptide bonds connecting each amino acid to the next.
The Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1003  primary structure of insulin, composed of 51 amino acids, is shown in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f01.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1004  Figure 18.2 Primary Structure of Human Insulin Human insulin, whose amino acid sequence is shown here, is a hormone that is required for the proper metabolism of glucose.
A protein molecule is not a random tangle of polypeptide chains.
Instead, the chains are arranged in unique but specific conformations.
The term secondary structure refers to the fixed arrangement of the polypeptide backbone.
On the basis of X ray studies, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey postulated that certain proteins or portions of proteins twist into a spiral or a helix.
This helix is stabilized by intrachain hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen atom of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen atom four amino acids up the chain (located on the next turn of the helix) and is known as a right- handed α-helix.
X ray data indicate that this helix makes one turn for every 3.6 amino acids, and the side chains of these amino acids project outward from the coiled backbone (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f02).
The α- keratins, found in hair and wool, are exclusively α-helical in conformation.
Some proteins, such as gamma globulin, chymotrypsin, and cytochrome c, have little or no Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1005  helical structure.
Others, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, are helical in certain regions but not in others.
Figure 18.3 A Ball-and-Stick Model of an α-Helix This ball-and-stick model shows the intrachain hydrogen bonding between carbonyl oxygen atoms and amide hydrogen atoms.
Each turn of the helix spans 3.6 amino acids.
Note that the side chains (represented as green spheres) point out from the helix.
Another common type of secondary structure, called the β-pleated sheet conformation, is a sheetlike arrangement in which two or more extended polypeptide chains (or separate regions on the same chain) are aligned side by side.
The aligned segments can run either parallel or antiparallel—that is, the N-terminals can face in the same direction on adjacent chains or in different directions—and are connected byinterchain hydrogen bonding (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f03).
The β- pleated sheet is particularly important in structural proteins, such as silk fibroin.
It is also seen in portions of many enzymes, such as carboxypeptidase A and lysozyme.
Figure 18.4 A Ball-and-Stick Model of the β-Pleated Sheet Structure in Proteins Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1006  The side chains extend above or below the sheet and alternate along the chain.
The protein chains are held together by interchain hydrogen bonding.
Tertiary structure refers to the unique three-dimensional shape of the protein as a whole, which results from the folding and bending of the protein backbone.
The tertiary structure is intimately tied to the proper biochemical functioning of the protein.http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f04shows a depiction of the three-dimensional structure of insulin.
Four major types of attractive interactions determine the shape and stability of the tertiary structure of proteins.
You studied several of these in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch08, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch08_s01.
1.
Ionic bonding.
Ionic bonds result from electrostatic attractions between positively and negatively charged side chains of amino acids.
For example, the mutual attraction between an aspartic acid carboxylate ion and a lysine ammonium ion helps to maintain a particular folded area of a protein (part (a) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f05).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1007  2.
Hydrogen bonding.
Hydrogen bonding forms between a highly electronegative oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom attached to another oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom, such as those found in polar amino acid side chains.
Hydrogen bonding (as well as ionic attractions) is extremely important in both the intra- and intermolecular interactions of proteins (part (b) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f05).
3.
Disulfide linkages.
Two cysteine amino acid units may be brought close together as the protein molecule folds.
Subsequent oxidation and linkage of the sulfur atoms in the highly reactive sulfhydryl (SH) groups leads to the formation of cystine (part (c) ofhttp://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f05).
Intrachain disulfide linkages are found in many proteins, including insulin (yellow bars in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f01) and have a strong stabilizing effect on the tertiary structure.
4.
Dispersion forces.
Dispersion forces arise when a normally nonpolar atom becomes momentarily polar due to an uneven distribution of electrons, leading to an instantaneous dipole that induces a shift of electrons in a neighboring nonpolar atom.
Dispersion forces are weak but can be important when other types of interactions are either missing or minimal (part (d) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f05).
This is the case with fibroin, the major protein in silk, in which a high proportion of amino acids in the protein have nonpolar side chains.
The term hydrophobic interaction is often misused as a synonym for dispersion forces.
Hydrophobic interactions arise because water molecules engage in hydrogen bonding with other water molecules (or groups in proteins capable of hydrogen bonding).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1008  Because nonpolar groups cannot engage in hydrogen bonding, the protein folds in such a way that these groups are buried in the interior part of the protein structure, minimizing their contact with water.
Figure 18.6 Tertiary Protein Structure Interactions Four interactions stabilize the tertiary structure of a protein: (a) ionic bonding, (b) hydrogen bonding, (c) disulfide linkages, and (d) dispersion forces.
When a protein contains more than one polypeptide chain, each chain is called asubunit.
The arrangement of multiple subunits represents a fourth level of structure, the quaternary structure of a protein.
Hemoglobin, with four polypeptide chains or subunits, is the most frequently cited example of a protein having quaternary structure Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1009  (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f06).
The quaternary structure of a protein is produced and stabilized by the same kinds of interactions that produce and maintain the tertiary structure.
A schematic representation of the four levels of protein structure is in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s04_s01_f07.

The resulting peptide chain can twist into an α-helix, which is one type of secondary structure.
This helical segment is incorporated into the tertiary structure of the folded polypeptide chain.
The single polypeptide chain is a subunit that constitutes thequaternary structure of a protein, such as hemoglobin that has four polypeptide chains.
Denaturation of Proteins The highly organized structures of proteins are truly masterworks of chemical architecture.
But highly organized structures tend to have a certain delicacy, and this is true of proteins.
Denaturation is the term used for any change in the three- dimensional structure of a protein that renders it incapable of performing its assigned function.
A denatured protein cannot do its job.
(Sometimes denaturation is equated with the precipitation or coagulation of a protein; our definition is a bit broader.)
A wide variety of reagents and conditions, such as heat, organic compounds, pH changes, and heavy metal ions can cause protein denaturation (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s02_t01).
Table 18.4 Protein Denaturation Methods Method Effect on Protein Structure Heat above 50°C or Heat or UV radiation supplies kinetic energy to protein ultraviolet (UV) molecules, causing their atoms to vibrate more rapidly radiation and disrupting relatively weak hydrogen bonding and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1011  Method Effect on Protein Structure dispersion forces.
These compounds are capable of engaging in Use of organic intermolecular hydrogen bonding with protein compounds, such as molecules, disrupting intramolecular hydrogen bonding ethyl alcohol within the protein.
Salts of heavy metal These ions form strong bonds with the carboxylate ions, such as mercury, anions of the acidic amino acids or SH groups of silver, and lead cysteine, disrupting ionic bonds and disulfide linkages.
Alkaloid reagents, such as tannic acid (used in These reagents combine with positively charged amino tanning leather) groups in proteins to disrupt ionic bonds.
Anyone who has fried an egg has observed denaturation.
The clear egg white turns opaque as the albumin denatures and coagulates.
No one has yet reversed that process.
However, given the proper circumstances and enough time, a protein that has unfolded under sufficiently gentle conditions can refold and may again exhibit biological activity (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s02_f01).
Such evidence suggests that, at least for these proteins, the primary structure determines the secondary and tertiary structure.
A given sequence of amino acids seems to adopt its particular three-dimensional arrangement naturally if conditions are right.
Figure 18.9 Denaturation and Renaturation of a Protein Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1012  The denaturation (unfolding) and renaturation (refolding) of a protein is depicted.
The red boxes represent stabilizing interactions, such as disulfide linkages, hydrogen bonding, and/or ionic bonds.
The primary structures of proteins are quite sturdy.
In general, fairly vigorous conditions are needed to hydrolyze peptide bonds.
At the secondary through quaternary levels, however, proteins are quite vulnerable to attack, though they vary in their vulnerability to denaturation.
The delicately folded globular proteins are much easier to denature than are the tough, fibrous proteins of hair and skin.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1016  18.5 Enzymes LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain the functions of enzymes.
2.
Explain how enzymes are classified and named.
A catalyst is any substance that increases the rate or speed of a chemical reaction without being changed or consumed in the reaction.
Enzymes are biological catalysts, and nearly all of them are proteins.
The reaction rates attained by enzymes are truly amazing.
In their presence, reactions occur at rates that are a million (106) or more times faster than would be attainable in their absence.
What is even more amazing is that enzymes perform this function at body temperature (~37°C) and physiological pH (pH ~7), rather than at the conditions that are typically necessary to increase reaction rates (high temperature or pressure, the use of strong oxidizing or reducing agents or strong acids or bases, or a combination of any of these).
In addition, enzymes are highly specific in their action; that is, each enzyme catalyzes only one type of reaction in only one compound or a group of structurally related compounds.
The compound or compounds on which an enzyme acts are known as its substrates.
Hundreds of enzymes have been purified and studied in an effort to understand how they work so effectively and with such specificity.
The resulting knowledge has been used to design drugs that inhibit or activate particular enzymes.
An example is the intensive research to improve the treatment of or find a cure for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Researchers are studying the enzymes produced by this virus and are developing drugs intended to block the action of those enzymes without interfering with Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1017  enzymes produced by the human body.
Several of these drugs have now been approved for use by AIDS patients.
The first enzymes to be discovered were named according to their source or method of discovery.
The enzyme pepsin, which aids in the hydrolysis of proteins, is found in the digestive juices of the stomach (Greek pepsis, meaning “digestion”).
Papain, another enzyme that hydrolyzes protein (in fact, it is used in meat tenderizers), is isolated from papayas.
As more enzymes were discovered, chemists recognized the need for a more systematic and chemically informative identification scheme.
In the current numbering and naming scheme, under the oversight of the Nomenclature Commission of the International Union of Biochemistry, enzymes are arranged into six groups according to the general type of reaction they catalyze (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s05_t01), with subgroups and secondary subgroups that specify the reaction more precisely.
Each enzyme is assigned a four-digit number, preceded by the prefix EC—for enzyme classification—that indicates its group, subgroup, and so forth.
This is demonstrated in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s05_t02for alcohol dehydrogenase.
Each enzyme is also given a name consisting of the root of the name of its substrate or substrates and the -ase suffix.
Thus urease is the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea.
Table 18.5 Classes of Enzymes Type of Reaction Class Catalyzed Examples Dehydrogenases catalyze oxidation- reduction reactions involving hydrogen oxidation-reduction and reductases catalyze reactions in oxidoreductases reactions which a substrate is reduced.
Transaminases catalyze the transfer of transfer reactions of amino group, and kinases catalyze the groups, such as transferases transfer of a phosphate group.
methyl, amino, and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1018  Type of Reaction Class Catalyzed Examples acetyl Lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of lipids, and proteases catalyze the hydrolases hydrolysis reactions hydrolysis of proteins reactions in which groups are removed without hydrolysis or addition of groups to a Decarboxylases catalyze the removal of lyases double bond carboxyl groups.
Isomerases may catalyze the conversion of an aldose to a ketose, and reactions in which a mutases catalyze reactions in which a compound is functional group is transferred from isomerases converted to its isomer one atom in a substrate to another.
reactions in which new bonds are formed between carbon and Synthetases catalyze reactions in which another atom; energy two smaller molecules are linked to ligases is required form a larger one.

Describe the interaction between an enzyme and its substrate.
Enzyme-catalyzed reactions occur in at least two steps.
In the first step, an enzyme molecule (E) and the substrate molecule or molecules (S) collide and react to form an intermediate compound called the enzyme-substrate (E–S) complex.
(This step is reversible because the complex can break apart into the original substrate or substrates and the free enzyme.)
Once the E–S complex forms, the enzyme is able to catalyze the formation of product (P), which is then released from the enzyme surface: S + E → E–SE–S → P + E Hydrogen bonding and other electrostatic interactions hold the enzyme and substrate together in the complex.
The structural features or functional groups on the enzyme that participate in these interactions are located in a cleft or pocket on the enzyme surface.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1022  This pocket, where the enzyme combines with the substrate and transforms the substrate to product is called the active site of the enzyme (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s06_f01).
It possesses a unique conformation (including correctly positioned bonding groups) that is complementary to the structure of the substrate, so that the enzyme and substrate molecules fit together in much the same manner as a key fits into a tumbler lock.
In fact, an early model describing the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex was called the lock-and-key model (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s06_f02).
This model portrayed the enzyme as conformationally rigid and able to bond only to substrates that exactly fit the active site.
Figure 18.10 Substrate Binding to the Active Site of an Enzyme The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase is shown with one of its substrates: NADP+ (a) unbound and (b) bound.
The NADP+ (shown in red) binds to a pocket that is complementary to it in shape and ionic properties.
Figure 18.11 The Lock-and-Key Model of Enzyme Action Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1023  (a) Because the substrate and the active site of the enzyme have complementary structures and bonding groups, they fit together as a key fits a lock.
(b) The catalytic reaction occurs while the two are bonded together in the enzyme-substrate complex.
Working out the precise three-dimensional structures of numerous enzymes has enabled chemists to refine the original lock-and-key model of enzyme actions.
They discovered that the binding of a substrate often leads to a large conformational change in the enzyme, as well as to changes in the structure of the substrate or substrates.
The current theory, known as the induced-fit model, says that enzymes can undergo a change in conformation when they bind substrate molecules, and the active site has a shape complementary to that of the substrate only after the substrate is bound, as shown for hexokinase in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s06_f03.
After catalysis, the enzyme resumes its original structure.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1024  Figure 18.12 The Induced-Fit Model of Enzyme Action (a) The enzyme hexokinase without its substrate (glucose, shown in red) is bound to the active site.
(b) The enzyme conformation changes dramatically when the substrate binds to it, resulting in additional interactions between hexokinase and glucose.
The structural changes that occur when an enzyme and a substrate join together bring specific parts of a substrate into alignment with specific parts of the enzyme’s active site.
Amino acid side chains in or near the binding site can then act as acid or base catalysts, provide binding sites for the transfer of functional groups from one substrate to another or aid in the rearrangement of a substrate.
The participating amino acids, which are usually widely separated in the primary sequence of the protein, are brought close together in the active site as a result of the folding and bending of the polypeptide chain or chains when the protein acquires its tertiary and quaternary structure.
Binding to enzymes brings reactants close to each other and aligns them properly, which has the same effect as increasing the concentration of the reacting compounds.

Suggest an amino acid whose side chain might be in the active site of an enzyme and form the type of interaction you just identified.
Solution 1.
An OH group would most likely engage in hydrogen bonding with an appropriate functional group present in the active site of an enzyme.
2.
Several amino acid side chains would be able to engage in hydrogen bonding with an OH group.
One example would be asparagine, which has an amide functional group.

What type of interaction would occur between an COO− group present on a substrate molecule and a functional group in the active site of an enzyme?
2.
Suggest an amino acid whose side chain might be in the active site of an enzyme and form the type of interaction you just identified.
One characteristic that distinguishes an enzyme from all other types of catalysts is itssubstrate specificity.
An inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid can be used to increase the reaction rates of many different reactions, such as the hydrolysis of disaccharides, polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins, with complete impartiality.
In contrast, enzymes are much more specific.
Some enzymes act on a single substrate, while other enzymes act on any of a group of related molecules containing a similar functional group or chemical bond.
Some enzymes even distinguish between D- and L-stereoisomers, binding one stereoisomer but not the other.
Urease, for example, is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a single substrate—urea—but not the closely related compounds methyl urea, thiourea, or biuret.
The enzyme carboxypeptidase, on the other Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1026  hand, is far less specific.
It catalyzes the removal of nearly any amino acid from the carboxyl end of any peptide or protein.
Enzyme specificity results from the uniqueness of the active site in each different enzyme because of the identity, charge, and spatial orientation of the functional groups located there.
It regulates cell chemistry so that the proper reactions occur in the proper place at the proper time.
Clearly, it is crucial to the proper functioning of the living cell.
CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
Distinguish between the lock-and-key model and induced-fit model of enzyme action.
2.
Which enzyme has greater specificity—urease or carboxypeptidase?
Explain.
ANSWERS 1.
The lock-and-key model portrays an enzyme as conformationally rigid and able to bond only to substrates that exactly fit the active site.
The induced fit model portrays the enzyme structure as more flexible and is complementary to the substrate only after the substrate is bound.
2.
Urease has the greater specificity because it can bind only to a single substrate.
Carboxypeptidase, on the other hand, can catalyze the removal of nearly any amino acid from the carboxyl end of a peptide or protein.

18.7 Enzyme Activity LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe how pH, temperature, and the concentration of an enzyme and its substrate influence enzyme activity.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1029  The single most important property of enzymes is the ability to increase the rates of reactions occurring in living organisms, a property known as catalytic activity.
Because most enzymes are proteins, their activity is affected by factors that disrupt protein structure, as well as by factors that affect catalysts in general.
Factors that disrupt protein structure, as we saw in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04, include temperature and pH; factors that affect catalysts in general include reactant or substrate concentration and catalyst or enzyme concentration.
The activity of an enzyme can be measured by monitoring either the rate at which a substrate disappears or the rate at which a product forms.
Concentration of Substrate In the presence of a given amount of enzyme, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases as the substrate concentration increases until a limiting rate is reached, after which further increase in the substrate concentration produces no significant change in the reaction rate (part (a) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s07_s01_f01).
At this point, so much substrate is present that essentially all of the enzyme active sites have substrate bound to them.
In other words, the enzyme molecules are saturated with substrate.
The excess substrate molecules cannot react until the substrate already bound to the enzymes has reacted and been released (or been released without reacting).
Figure 18.13 Concentration versus Reaction Rate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1030  (a) This graph shows the effect of substrate concentration on the rate of a reaction that is catalyzed by a fixed amount of enzyme.
(b) This graph shows the effect of enzyme concentration on the reaction rate at a constant level of substrate.
Let’s consider an analogy.
Ten taxis (enzyme molecules) are waiting at a taxi stand to take people (substrate) on a 10-minute trip to a concert hall, one passenger at a time.
If only 5 people are present at the stand, the rate of their arrival at the concert hall is 5 people in 10 minutes.
If the number of people at the stand is increased to 10, the rate increases to 10 arrivals in 10 minutes.
With 20 people at the stand, the rate would still be 10 arrivals in 10 minutes.
The taxis have been “saturated.” If the taxis could carry 2 or 3 passengers each, the same principle would apply.
The rate would simply be higher (20 or 30 people in 10 minutes) before it leveled off.
Concentration of Enzyme When the concentration of the enzyme is significantly lower than the concentration of the substrate (as when the number of taxis is far lower than the number of waiting passengers), the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is directly dependent on the enzyme concentration (part (b) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s07_s01_f01).
This is true for any catalyst; the reaction rate increases as the concentration of the catalyst is increased.
Temperature Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1031  A general rule of thumb for most chemical reactions is that a temperature rise of 10°C approximately doubles the reaction rate.
To some extent, this rule holds for all enzymatic reactions.
After a certain point, however, an increase in temperature causes a decrease in the reaction rate, due to denaturation of the protein structure and disruption of the active site (part (a) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s07_s03_f01).
For many proteins, denaturation occurs between 45°C and 55°C.
Furthermore, even though an enzyme may appear to have a maximum reaction rate between 40°C and 50°C, most biochemical reactions are carried out at lower temperatures because enzymes are not stable at these higher temperatures and will denature after a few minutes.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1032  Figure 18.14 Temperature and pH versus Concentration (a) This graph depicts the effect of temperature on the rate of a reaction that is catalyzed by a fixed amount of enzyme.
(b) This graph depicts the effect of pH on the rate of a reaction that is catalyzed by a fixed amount of enzyme.
At 0°C and 100°C, the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions is nearly zero.
This fact has several practical applications.
We sterilize objects by placing them in boiling water, which denatures the enzymes of any bacteria that may be in or on them.
We preserve our food by refrigerating or freezing it, which slows enzyme activity.
When animals go into hibernation in winter, their body temperature drops, decreasing the rates of their metabolic processes to levels that can be maintained by the amount of energy stored in the fat reserves in the animals’ tissues.
Hydrogen Ion Concentration (pH) Because most enzymes are proteins, they are sensitive to changes in the hydrogen ion concentration or pH.
Enzymes may be denatured by extreme levels of hydrogen ions (whether high or low); any change in pH, even a small one, alters the degree of ionization of an enzyme’s acidic and basic side groups and the substrate components as well.
Ionizable side groups located in the active site must have a certain charge for the enzyme to bind its substrate.
Neutralization of even one of these charges alters an enzyme’s catalytic activity.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1033  An enzyme exhibits maximum activity over the narrow pH range in which a molecule exists in its properly charged form.
The median value of this pH range is called theoptimum pH of the enzyme (part (b) of http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s07_s03_f01).
With the notable exception of gastric juice (the fluids secreted in the stomach), most body fluids have pH values between 6 and 8.
Not surprisingly, most enzymes exhibit optimal activity in this pH range.
However, a few enzymes have optimum pH values outside this range.
For example, the optimum pH for pepsin, an enzyme that is active in the stomach, is 2.0.
CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.
The concentration of substrate X is low.
What happens to the rate of the enzyme- catalyzed reaction if the concentration of X is doubled?
2.
What effect does an increase in the enzyme concentration have on the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction?
ANSWERS 1.
If the concentration of the substrate is low, increasing its concentration will increase the rate of the reaction.
2.
An increase in the amount of enzyme will increase the rate of the reaction (provided sufficient substrate is present).
KEY TAKEAWAYS Initially, an increase in substrate concentration leads to an increase in the rate of an  enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
As the enzyme molecules become saturated with substrate, this increase in reaction rate levels off.
The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with an increase in the  concentration of an enzyme.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1034  At low temperatures, an increase in temperature increases the rate of an enzyme-  catalyzed reaction.
At higher temperatures, the protein is denatured, and the rate of the reaction dramatically decreases.
An enzyme has an optimum pH range in which it exhibits maximum activity.
 EXERCISES 1.
In non-enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the reaction rate increases as the concentration of reactant is increased.
In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the reaction rate initially increases as the substrate concentration is increased but then begins to level off, so that the increase in reaction rate becomes less and less as the substrate concentration increases.
Explain this difference.
2.
Why do enzymes become inactive at very high temperatures?
3.
An enzyme has an optimum pH of 7.4.
What is most likely to happen to the activity of the enzyme if the pH drops to 6.3?
Explain.
4.
An enzyme has an optimum pH of 7.2.
What is most likely to happen to the activity of the enzyme if the pH increases to 8.5?
Explain.
ANSWERS 1.
In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the substrate binds to the enzyme to form an enzyme- substrate complex.
If more substrate is present than enzyme, all of the enzyme binding sites will have substrate bound, and further increases in substrate concentration cannot increase the rate.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1035  3.
The activity will decrease; a pH of 6.3 is more acidic than 7.4, and one or more key groups in the active site may bind a hydrogen ion, changing the charge on that group.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1036  18.8 Enzyme Inhibition LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Explain what an enzyme inhibitor is.
2.
Distinguish between reversible and irreversible inhibitors.
3.
Distinguish between competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors.
In http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s07, we noted that enzymes are inactivated at high temperatures and by changes in pH.
These are nonspecific factors that would inactivate any enzyme.
The activity of enzymes can also be regulated by more specific inhibitors.
Many compounds are poisons because they bind covalently to particular enzymes or kinds of enzymes and inactivate them (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s08_t01).
Table 18.7 Poisons as Enzyme Inhibitors Example of Enzyme Poison Formula Inhibited Action substitute glyceraldehyde 3- s for phosphate phosphat arsenate AsO 3− dehydrogenase e 4 binds to triose phosphate cysteine iodoacetate ICH COO− dehydrogenase SH group 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1037  Example of Enzyme Poison Formula Inhibited Action diisopropylfluor binds to o-phosphate serine (DIFP; a nerve acetylcholinestera OH poison) se group Irreversible Inhibition: Poisons An irreversible inhibitor inactivates an enzyme by bonding covalently to a particular group at the active site.
The inhibitor-enzyme bond is so strong that the inhibition cannot be reversed by the addition of excess substrate.
The nerve gases, especially DIFP, irreversibly inhibit biological systems by forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex with a specific OH group of serine situated at the active sites of certain enzymes.
The peptidases trypsin and chymotrypsin contain serine groups at the active site and are inhibited by DIFP.
Reversible Inhibition A reversible inhibitor inactivates an enzyme through noncovalent, more easily reversed, interactions.
Unlike an irreversible inhibitor, a reversible inhibitor can dissociate from the enzyme.
Reversible inhibitors include competitive inhibitors and noncompetitive inhibitors.
(There are additional types of reversible inhibitors.)
A competitive inhibitor is any compound that bears a structural resemblance to a particular substrate and thus competes with that substrate for binding at the active site Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1038  of an enzyme.
The inhibitor is not acted on by the enzyme but does prevent the substrate from approaching the active site.
The degree to which a competitive inhibitor interferes with an enzyme’s activity depends on the relative concentrations of the substrate and the inhibitor.
If the inhibitor is present in relatively large quantities, it will initially block most of the active sites.
But because the binding is reversible, some substrate molecules will eventually bind to the active site and be converted to product.
Increasing the substrate concentration promotes displacement of the inhibitor from the active site.
Competitive inhibition can be completely reversed by adding substrate so that it reaches a much higher concentration than that of the inhibitor.
Studies of competitive inhibition have provided helpful information about certain enzyme-substrate complexes and the interactions of specific groups at the active sites.
As a result, pharmaceutical companies have synthesized drugs that competitively inhibit metabolic processes in bacteria and certain cancer cells.
Many drugs are competitive inhibitors of specific enzymes.
A classic example of competitive inhibition is the effect of malonate on the enzyme activity of succinate dehydrogenase (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch18_s08_s02_f01).
Malonate and succinate are the anions of dicarboxylic acids and contain three and four carbon atoms, respectively.
The malonate molecule binds to the active site because the spacing of its carboxyl groups is not greatly different from that of succinate.
However, no catalytic reaction occurs because malonate does not have a CH CH group to convert to CH=CH.
This reaction will also be discussed in connection 2 2 with the Krebs cycle and energy production.
(For more information about the Krebs cycle, see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob- ch20, http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch20_s04.)
Figure 18.15 Competitive Inhibition Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1039  (a) Succinate binds to the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase.
A dehydrogenation reaction occurs, and the product—fumarate—is released from the enzyme.
(b) Malonate also binds to the active site of succinate dehydrogenase.
In this case, however, no subsequent reaction occurs while malonate remains bound to the enzyme.
To Your Health: Penicillin Chemotherapy is the strategic use of chemicals (that is, drugs) to destroy infectious microorganisms or cancer cells without causing excessive damage to the other, healthy cells of the host.
From bacteria to humans, the metabolic pathways of all living organisms are quite similar, so the search for safe and effective chemotherapeutic agents is a formidable task.
Many well-established chemotherapeutic drugs function by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the cells of the invading organism.
An antibiotic is a compound that kills bacteria; it may come from a natural source such as molds or be synthesized with a structure analogous to a naturally occurring antibacterial compound.
Antibiotics constitute no well-defined class of chemically related substances, but many of them work by effectively inhibiting a variety of enzymes essential to bacterial growth.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1040  Penicillin, one of the most widely used antibiotics in the world, was fortuitously discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, when he noticed antibacterial properties in a mold growing on a bacterial culture plate.
In 1938, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey began an intensive effort to isolate penicillin from the mold and study its properties.
The large quantities of penicillin needed for this research became available through development of a corn-based nutrient medium that the mold loved and through the discovery of a higher-yielding strain of mold at a United States Department of Agriculture research center near Peoria, Illinois.
Even so, it was not until 1944 that large quantities of penicillin were being produced and made available for the treatment of bacterial infections.
Penicillin functions by interfering with the synthesis of cell walls of reproducing bacteria.
It does so by inhibiting an enzyme—transpeptidase—that catalyzes the last step in bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis.
The defective walls cause bacterial cells to burst.
Human cells are not affected because they have cell membranes, not cell walls.
Several naturally occurring penicillins have been isolated.
They are distinguished by different R groups connected to a common structure: a four-member cyclic amide (called a lactam ring) fused to a five-member ring.
The addition of appropriate organic compounds to the culture medium leads to the production of the different kinds of penicillin.
The penicillins are effective against gram-positive bacteria (bacteria capable of being stained by Gram’s stain) and a few gram-negative bacteria (including the intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli).
They are effective in the treatment of diphtheria, gonorrhea, pneumonia, syphilis, many pus infections, and certain types of boils.
Penicillin G was the earliest penicillin to be used on a wide scale.
However, it cannot be administered orally because it is quite unstable; the acidic pH of the stomach converts it to an inactive derivative.
The major oral penicillins—penicillin V, ampicillin, and amoxicillin—on the other hand, are acid stable.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1041  Some strains of bacteria become resistant to penicillin through a mutation that allows them to synthesize an enzyme—penicillinase—that breaks the antibiotic down (by cleavage of the amide linkage in the lactam ring).
To combat these strains, scientists have synthesized penicillin analogs (such as methicillin) that are not inactivated by penicillinase.
Some people (perhaps 5% of the population) are allergic to penicillin and therefore must be treated with other antibiotics.
Their allergic reaction can be so severe that a fatal coma may occur if penicillin is inadvertently administered to them.
Fortunately, several other antibiotics have been discovered.
Most, including aureomycin and streptomycin, are the products of microbial synthesis.
Others, such as the semisynthetic penicillins and tetracyclines, are made by chemical modifications of antibiotics; and some, like chloramphenicol, are manufactured entirely by chemical synthesis.
They are as effective as penicillin in destroying infectious microorganisms.
Many of these antibiotics exert their effects by blocking protein synthesis in microorganisms.
Initially, antibiotics were considered miracle drugs, substantially reducing the number of deaths from blood poisoning, pneumonia, and other infectious diseases.
Some seven Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1042  decades ago, a person with a major infection almost always died.
Today, such deaths are rare.
Seven decades ago, pneumonia was a dreaded killer of people of all ages.
Today, it kills only the very old or those ill from other causes.
Antibiotics have indeed worked miracles in our time, but even miracle drugs have limitations.
Not long after the drugs were first used, disease organisms began to develop strains resistant to them.
In a race to stay ahead of resistant bacterial strains, scientists continue to seek new antibiotics.
The penicillins have now been partially displaced by related compounds, such as the cephalosporins and vancomycin.
Unfortunately, some strains of bacteria have already shown resistance to these antibiotics.
Some reversible inhibitors are noncompetitive.
A noncompetitive inhibitor can combine with either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex because its binding site on the enzyme is distinct from the active site.
Binding of this kind of inhibitor alters the three-dimensional conformation of the enzyme, changing the configuration of the active site with one of two results.
Either the enzyme-substrate complex does not form at its normal rate, or, once formed, it does not yield products at the normal rate.
Because the inhibitor does not structurally resemble the substrate, the addition of excess substrate does not reverse the inhibitory effect.
Feedback inhibition is a normal biochemical process that makes use of noncompetitive inhibitors to control some enzymatic activity.
In this process, the final product inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in a series of reactions.
Feedback inhibition is used to regulate the synthesis of many amino acids.
For example, bacteria synthesize isoleucine from threonine in a series of five enzyme-catalyzed steps.
As the concentration of isoleucine increases, some of it binds as a noncompetitive inhibitor to the first enzyme of the series (threonine deaminase), thus bringing about a decrease in the amount of isoleucine being formed (http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s08_s02_f02).
Figure 18.16 Feedback Inhibition of Threonine Deaminase by Isoleucine Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1043  Threonine deaminase is the first enzyme in the conversion of threonine to isoleucine.

ANSWER 1. serine 18.9 Enzyme Cofactors and Vitamins LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Explain why vitamins are necessary in the diet.
Many enzymes are simple proteins consisting entirely of one or more amino acid chains.
Other enzymes contain a nonprotein component called a cofactor that is necessary for the enzyme’s proper functioning.
There are two types of cofactors: inorganic ions [e.g., zinc or Cu(I) ions] and organic molecules known as coenzymes.
Most coenzymes are vitamins or are derived from vitamins.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1045  Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential in very small (trace) amounts for the maintenance of normal metabolism.
They generally cannot be synthesized at adequate levels by the body and must be obtained from the diet.
The absence or shortage of a vitamin may result in a vitamin-deficiency disease.
In the first half of the 20th century, a major focus of biochemistry was the identification, isolation, and characterization of vitamins.
Despite accumulating evidence that people needed more than just carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in their diets for normal growth and health, it was not until the early 1900s that research established the need for trace nutrients in the diet.
Because organisms differ in their synthetic abilities, a substance that is a vitamin for one species may not be so for another.
Over the past 100 years, scientists have identified and isolated 13 vitamins required in the human diet and have divided them into two broad categories: the fat-soluble vitamins, which include vitamins A, D, E, and K, and the water-soluble vitamins, which are the B complex vitamins and vitamin C. All fat- soluble vitamins contain a high proportion of hydrocarbon structural components.
There are one or two oxygen atoms present, but the compounds as a whole are nonpolar.
In contrast, water-soluble vitamins contain large numbers of electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms, which can engage in hydrogen bonding with water.
Most water-soluble vitamins act as coenzymes or are required for the synthesis of coenzymes.
The fat- soluble vitamins are important for a variety of physiological functions.
The key vitamins and their functions are found in Table 18.8 "Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Physiological Functions" and Table 18.9 "Water-Soluble Vitamins and Physiological Functions".

Antioxidants prevent damage from free radicals, which are molecules that are highly reactive because they have unpaired electrons.
Free radicals are formed not only through metabolic reactions involving oxygen but also by such environmental factors as radiation and pollution.
Note β-carotene is known as a provitamin because it can be converted to vitamin A in the body.
Free radicals react most commonly react with lipoproteins and unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, removing an electron from those molecules and thus generating a new free radical.
The process becomes a chain reaction that finally leads to the oxidative degradation of the affected compounds.
Antioxidants react with free radicals to stop these chain reactions by forming a more stable molecule or, in the case of vitamin E, a free radical that is much less reactive.
(Vitamin E is converted back to its original form through interaction with vitamin C.) CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISES 1.

A protein is a large biological polymer synthesized from amino acids, which are carboxylic acids containing an α-amino group.
Proteins have a variety of important roles in living organisms, yet they are made from the same 20 L-amino acids.
About half of these amino acids, the essential amino acids, cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained from the diet.
In the solid state and in neutral solutions, amino acids exist as zwitterions, species that are charged but electrically neutral.
In this form, they behave much like inorganic salts.
Each amino acid belongs to one of four classes depending on the characteristics of its R group or amino acid side chain: nonpolar, polar but neutral, positively charged, and negatively charged.
Depending on Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1051  the conditions, amino acids can act as either acids or bases, which means that proteins act as buffers.
The pH at which an amino acid exists as the zwitterion is called theisoelectric point (pI).
The amino acids in a protein are linked together by peptide bonds.
Protein chains containing 10 or fewer amino acids are usually referred to as peptides, with a prefix such as di- or tri- indicating the number of amino acids.
Chains containing more than 50 amino acid units are referred to as proteins orpolypeptides.
Proteins are classified globular or fibrous, depending on their structure and resulting solubility in water.
Globular proteins are nearly spherical and are soluble in water; fibrous proteins have elongated or fibrous structures and are not soluble in water.
Protein molecules can have as many as four levels of structure.
The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in the chain.
The secondary structure is the arrangement of adjacent atoms in the peptide chain; the most common arrangements are α-helices or β-pleated sheets.
The tertiary structureis the overall three-dimensional shape of the molecule that results from the way the chain bends and folds in on itself.
Proteins that consist of more than one chain have quaternary structure, which is the way the multiple chains are packed together.
Four types of intramolecular and intermolecular forces contribute to secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure: (1) hydrogen bonding between an oxygen or a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom, either on the same chain or on a neighboring chain; (2) ionic bondingbetween one positively charged side chain and one negatively charged side chain; (3) disulfide linkages between cysteine units; and (4) dispersion forcesbetween nonpolar side chains.
Because of their complexity, protein molecules are delicate and easy to disrupt.
Adenatured protein is one whose conformation has been changed, in a process called denaturation, so that it can no longer do its physiological job.
A variety of conditions, such as heat, ultraviolet radiation, the addition of organic compounds, or changes in pH can denature a protein.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1052  An enzyme is an organic catalyst produced by a living cell.
Enzymes are such powerful catalysts that the reactions they promote occur rapidly at body temperature.
Without the help of enzymes, these reactions would require high temperatures and long reaction times.
The molecule or molecules on which an enzyme acts are called its substrates.
An enzyme has an active site where its substrate or substrates bind to form an enzyme- substrate complex.
The reaction occurs, and product is released: E + S → E–S → E + P The original lock-and-key model of enzyme and substrate binding pictured a rigid enzyme of unchanging configuration binding to the appropriate substrate.
The newer induced-fit model describes the enzyme active site as changing its conformation after binding to the substrate.
Most enzymes have maximal activity in a narrow pH range centered on anoptimum pH.
In this pH range, the enzyme is correctly folded, and catalytic groups in the active site have the correct charge (positive, negative, or neutral).
For most enzymes, the optimum pH is between 6 and 8.
Substances that interfere with enzyme function are called inhibitors.
Anirreversible inhibitor inactivates enzymes by forming covalent bonds to the enzyme, while a reversible inhibitor inactivates an enzyme by a weaker, noncovalent interaction that is easier to disrupt.
A competitive inhibitor is a reversible inhibitor that is structurally similar to the substrate and binds to the active site.
When the inhibitor is bound, the substrate is blocked from the active site and no reaction occurs.
Because the binding of such an inhibitor is reversible, a high substrate concentration will overcome the inhibition because it increases the likelihood of the substrate binding.
A noncompetitive inhibitor binds reversibly at a site distinct from the active site.
Thus, it can bind to either the enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex.
The inhibitor changes the conformation of the active site so that the enzyme cannot function properly.
Noncompetitive inhibitors are important in feedback inhibition, in which the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1053  amount of product produced by a series of reactions is carefully controlled.
The final product in a series of reactions acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the initial enzyme.
Simple enzymes consist entirely of one or more amino acid chains.
Complex enzymes are composed of one or more amino acid chains joined to cofactors—inorganic ions or organic coenzymes.
Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential in very small amounts for the maintenance of normal metabolism and generally cannot be synthesized at adequate levels by the body.
Vitamins are divided into two broad categories: fat-soluble vitamins and water-solublevitamins.
Many of the water-soluble vitamins are used for the synthesis of coenzymes.

Bradykinin would be positively charged; all of the amino acids, except for arginine, have R groups that do not become either positively or negatively charged.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1059  Chapter 19 Nucleic Acids Opening Essay Following the initial isolation of insulin in 1921, diabetic patients could be treated with insulin obtained from the pancreases of cattle and pigs.
Unfortunately, some patients developed an allergic reaction to this insulin because its amino acid sequence was not identical to that of human insulin.
In the 1970s, an intense research effort began that eventually led to the production of genetically engineered human insulin—the first genetically engineered product to be approved for medical use.
To accomplish this feat, researchers first had to determine how insulin is made in the body and then find a way of causing the same process to occur in nonhuman organisms, such as bacteria or yeast cells.
Many aspects of these discoveries are presented in this chapter on nucleic acids.

Dogs have puppies that grow up to be dogs.

From viruses to humans, each species reproduces after its own kind.
Furthermore, within each multicellular organism, every tissue is composed of cells specific to that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1060  tissue.
What accounts for this specificity at all levels of reproduction?
How does a fertilized egg “know” that it should develop into a kangaroo and not a koala?
What makes stomach cells produce gastric acid, whereas pancreatic cells produce insulin?
The blueprint for the reproduction and the maintenance of each organism is found in the nuclei of its cells, concentrated in elongated, threadlike structures calledchromosomes.
These complex structures, consisting of DNA and proteins, contain the basic units of heredity, called genes.
The number of chromosomes (and genes) varies with each species.
Human body cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes having 20,000–40,000 different genes.
Sperm and egg cells contain only a single copy of each chromosome; that is, they contain only one member of each chromosome pair.
Thus, in sexual reproduction, the entire complement of chromosomes is achieved only when an egg and sperm combine.
A new individual receives half its hereditary material from each parent.
Calling the unit of heredity a “gene” merely gives it a name.
But what really are genes and how is the information they contain expressed?
One definition of a gene is that it is a segment of DNA that constitutes the code for a specific polypeptide.
If genes are segments of DNA, we need to learn more about the structure and physiological function of DNA.
We begin by looking at the small molecules needed to form DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid)—the nucleotides.
19.1 Nucleotides LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Identify the different molecules that combine to form nucleotides.
The repeating, or monomer, units that are linked together to form nucleic acids are known as nucleotides.
The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a typical mammalian cell contains about 3 × 109 nucleotides.
Nucleotides can be further broken down to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1061  phosphoric acid (H PO ), a pentose sugar (a sugar with five carbon atoms), and a 3 4 nitrogenous base (a base containing nitrogen atoms).
If the pentose sugar is ribose, the nucleotide is more specifically referred to as a ribonucleotide, and the resulting nucleic acid is ribonucleic acid (RNA).
If the sugar is 2- deoxyribose, the nucleotide is a deoxyribonucleotide, and the nucleic acid is DNA.
The nitrogenous bases found in nucleotides are classified as pyrimidines or purines.
Pyrimidines are heterocyclic amines with two nitrogen atoms in a six-member ring and include uracil, thymine, and cytosine.
(For more information about heterocyclic amines, see Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", Section 15.13 "Amines as Bases".)
Purines are heterocyclic amines consisting of a pyrimidine ring fused to a five-member ring with two nitrogen atoms.
Adenine and guanine are the major purines found in nucleic acids (Figure 19.2 "The Nitrogenous Bases Found in DNA and RNA").
Figure 19.2 The Nitrogenous Bases Found in DNA and RNA Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1062  The formation of a bond between C1′ of the pentose sugar and N1 of the pyrimidine base or N9 of the purine base joins the pentose sugar to the nitrogenous base.
In the formation of this bond, a molecule of water is removed.
Table 19.1 "Composition of Nucleotides in DNA and RNA" summarizes the similarities and differences in the composition of nucleotides in DNA and RNA.
Note The numbering convention is that primed numbers designate the atoms of the pentose ring, and unprimed numbers designate the atoms of the purine or pyrimidine ring.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1063  Figure 19.3 The Pyrimidine and Purine Nucleotides Apart from being the monomer units of DNA and RNA, the nucleotides and some of their derivatives have other functions as well.
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), shown in Figure 19.4 "Structures of Two Important Adenine-Containing Nucleotides", have a role in cell metabolism that we will discuss in Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism".
Moreover, a number of coenzymes, including flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and coenzyme A, contain adenine nucleotides as structural components.
(For more information on coenzymes, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes",Section 18.9 "Enzyme Cofactors and Vitamins".)

Identify the two types of nucleic acids and the function of each type.
2.
Describe how nucleotides are linked together to form nucleic acids.
3.
Describe the secondary structure of DNA and the importance of complementary base pairing.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1072  Nucleic acids are large polymers formed by linking nucleotides together and are found in every cell.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the nucleic acid that stores genetic information.
If all the DNA in a typical mammalian cell were stretched out end to end, it would extend more than 2 m. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the nucleic acid responsible for using the genetic information encoded in DNA to produce the thousands of proteins found in living organisms.
Primary Structure of Nucleic Acids Nucleotides are joined together through the phosphate group of one nucleotide connecting in an ester linkage to the OH group on the third carbon atom of the sugar unit of a second nucleotide.
This unit joins to a third nucleotide, and the process is repeated to produce a long nucleic acid chain (Figure 19.5 "Structure of a Segment of DNA").
The backbone of the chain consists of alternating phosphate and sugar units (2- deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA).
The purine and pyrimidine bases branch off this backbone.
Note Each phosphate group has one acidic hydrogen atom that is ionized at physiological pH.
This is why these compounds are known as nucleic acids.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1073  Figure 19.5 Structure of a Segment of DNA A similar segment of RNA would have OH groups on each C2′, and uracil would replace thymine.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1074  Like proteins, nucleic acids have a primary structure that is defined as the sequence of their nucleotides.
Unlike proteins, which have 20 different kinds of amino acids, there are only 4 different kinds of nucleotides in nucleic acids.
For amino acid sequences in proteins, the convention is to write the amino acids in order starting with the N- terminal amino acid.
In writing nucleotide sequences for nucleic acids, the convention is to write the nucleotides (usually using the one-letter abbreviations for the bases, shown in Figure 19.5 "Structure of a Segment of DNA") starting with the nucleotide having a free phosphate group, which is known as the 5′ end, and indicate the nucleotides in order.
For DNA, a lowercase d is often written in front of the sequence to indicate that the monomers are deoxyribonucleotides.
The final nucleotide has a free OH group on the 3′ carbon atom and is called the 3′ end.
The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA segment shown in Figure 19.5 "Structure of a Segment of DNA" would be written 5′-dG- dT-dA-dC-3′, which is often further abbreviated to dGTAC or just GTAC.
Secondary Structure of DNA The three-dimensional structure of DNA was the subject of an intensive research effort in the late 1940s to early 1950s.
Initial work revealed that the polymer had a regular repeating structure.
In 1950, Erwin Chargaff of Columbia University showed that the molar amount of adenine (A) in DNA was always equal to that of thymine (T).
Similarly, he showed that the molar amount of guanine (G) was the same as that of cytosine (C).
Chargaff drew no conclusions from his work, but others soon did.
At Cambridge University in 1953, James D. Watson and Francis Crick announced that they had a model for the secondary structure of DNA.
Using the information from Chargaff’s experiments (as well as other experiments) and data from the X ray studies of Rosalind Franklin (which involved sophisticated chemistry, physics, and mathematics), Watson and Crick worked with models that were not unlike a child’s construction set and finally concluded that DNA is composed of two nucleic acid chains running antiparallel to one another—that is, side-by-side with the 5′ end of one chain next to the 3′ end of the other.
Moreover, as their model showed, the two chains are twisted to form a double helix—a structure that can be compared to a spiral staircase, with the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1075  phosphate and sugar groups (the backbone of the nucleic acid polymer) representing the outside edges of the staircase.
The purine and pyrimidine bases face the inside of the helix, with guanine always opposite cytosine and adenine always opposite thymine.
These specific base pairs, referred to as complementary bases, are the steps, or treads, in our staircase analogy (Figure 19.6 "DNA Double Helix").
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1076  Figure 19.6 DNA Double Helix (a) This represents a computer-generated model of the DNA double helix.
(b) This represents a schematic representation of the double helix, showing the complementary bases.
The structure proposed by Watson and Crick provided clues to the mechanisms by which cells are able to divide into two identical, functioning daughter cells; how genetic Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1077  data are passed to new generations; and even how proteins are built to required specifications.
All these abilities depend on the pairing of complementary bases.Figure 19.7 "Complementary Base Pairing" shows the two sets of base pairs and illustrates two things.
First, a pyrimidine is paired with a purine in each case, so that the long dimensions of both pairs are identical (1.08 nm).
If two pyrimidines were paired or two purines were paired, the two pyrimidines would take up less space than a purine and a pyrimidine, and the two purines would take up more space, as illustrated in Figure 19.8 "Difference in Widths of Possible Base Pairs".
If these pairings were ever to occur, the structure of DNA would be like a staircase made with stairs of different widths.
For the two strands of the double helix to fit neatly, a pyrimidine must always be paired with a purine.
The second thing you should notice in Figure 19.7 "Complementary Base Pairing" is that the correct pairing enables formation of three instances of hydrogen bonding between guanine and cytosine and two between adenine and thymine.
The additive contribution of this hydrogen bonding imparts great stability to the DNA double helix.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1078  Figure 19.7 Complementary Base Pairing Complementary bases engage in hydrogen bonding with one another: (a) thymine and adenine; (b) cytosine and guanine.

b Which type of nucleic acid stores genetic information in the cell?
2.

3.
Why is it structurally important that a purine base always pair with a pyrimidine base in the DNA double helix?
ANSWERS 1. a. deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) b. DNA 2. the specific base pairings in the DNA double helix in which guanine is paired with cytosine and adenine is paired with thymine 3.

Describe how a new copy of DNA is synthesized.
2.
Describe how RNA is synthesized from DNA.
3.
Identify the different types of RNA and the function of each type of RNA.
We previously stated that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) stores genetic information, while ribonucleic acid (RNA) is responsible for transmitting or expressing genetic information by directing the synthesis of thousands of proteins found in living organisms.
But how do the nucleic acids perform these functions?
Three processes are required: (1) replication, in which new copies of DNA are made; (2) transcription, in which a segment of DNA is used to produce RNA; and (3) translation, in which the information in RNA is translated into a protein sequence.
(For more information on protein sequences, see Section 19.4 "Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code".)
Replication New cells are continuously forming in the body through the process of cell division.
For this to happen, the DNA in a dividing cell must be copied in a process known as replication.
The complementary base pairing of the double helix provides a ready model for how genetic replication occurs.
If the two chains of the double helix are pulled apart, disrupting the hydrogen bonding between base pairs, each chain can act as a template, or pattern, for the synthesis of a new complementary DNA chain.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1086  The nucleus contains all the necessary enzymes, proteins, and nucleotides required for this synthesis.
A short segment of DNA is “unzipped,” so that the two strands in the segment are separated to serve as templates for new DNA.
DNA polymerase, an enzyme, recognizes each base in a template strand and matches it to the complementary base in a free nucleotide.
The enzyme then catalyzes the formation of an ester bond between the 5′ phosphate group of the nucleotide and the 3′ OH end of the new, growing DNA chain.
In this way, each strand of the original DNA molecule is used to produce a duplicate of its former partner (Figure 19.9 "A Schematic Diagram of DNA Replication").
Whatever information was encoded in the original DNA double helix is now contained in each replicate helix.
When the cell divides, each daughter cell gets one of these replicates and thus all of the information that was originally possessed by the parent cell.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1087  Figure 19.9 A Schematic Diagram of DNA Replication DNA replication occurs by the sequential unzipping of segments of the double helix.
Each new nucleotide is brought into position by DNA polymerase and is added to the growing strand by the formation of a phosphate ester bond.
Thus, two double helixes form from one, and each consists of one old strand and one new strand, an outcome called semiconservative replications.
(This representation is simplified; many more proteins are involved in replication.)
EXAMPLE 1 A segment of one strand from a DNA molecule has the sequence 5′-TCCATGAGTTGA-3′.
What is the sequence of nucleotides in the opposite, or complementary, DNA chain?
Solution Knowing that the two strands are antiparallel and that T base pairs with A, while C base pairs with G, the sequence of the complementary strand will be 3′-AGGTACTCAACT-5′ (can also be written as TCAACTCATGGA).
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1088  1.
A segment of one strand from a DNA molecule has the sequence 5′-CCAGTGAATTGCCTAT-3′.
What is the sequence of nucleotides in the opposite, or complementary, DNA chain?
What do we mean when we say information is encoded in the DNA molecule?
An organism’s DNA can be compared to a book containing directions for assembling a model airplane or for knitting a sweater.
Letters of the alphabet are arranged into words, and these words direct the individual to perform certain operations with specific materials.
If all the directions are followed correctly, a model airplane or sweater is produced.
In DNA, the particular sequences of nucleotides along the chains encode the directions for building an organism.
Just as saw means one thing in English and was means another, the sequence of bases CGT means one thing, and TGC means something different.
Although there are only four letters—the four nucleotides—in the genetic code of DNA, their sequencing along the DNA strands can vary so widely that information storage is essentially unlimited.
Transcription For the hereditary information in DNA to be useful, it must be “expressed,” that is, used to direct the growth and functioning of an organism.
The first step in the processes that constitute DNA expression is the synthesis of RNA, by a template mechanism that is in many ways analogous to DNA replication.
Because the RNA that is synthesized is a complementary copy of information contained in DNA, RNA synthesis is referred to as transcription.
There are three key differences between replication and transcription: (1) RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules; only a portion of one DNA strand is copied or transcribed to make an RNA molecule.
(2) RNA is built from ribonucleotides rather than deoxyribonucleotides.
(3) The newly synthesized RNA strand does not remain associated with the DNA sequence it was transcribed from.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1089  The DNA sequence that is transcribed to make RNA is called the template strand, while the complementary sequence on the other DNA strand is called the coding or informational strand.
To initiate RNA synthesis, the two DNA strands unwind at specific sites along the DNA molecule.
Ribonucleotides are attracted to the uncoiling region of the DNA molecule, beginning at the 3′ end of the template strand, according to the rules of base pairing.
Thymine in DNA calls for adenine in RNA, cytosine specifies guanine, guanine calls for cytosine, and adenine requires uracil.
RNA polymerase—an enzyme—binds the complementary ribonucleotide and catalyzes the formation of the ester linkage between ribonucleotides, a reaction very similar to that catalyzed by DNA polymerase (Figure 19.10 "A Schematic Diagram of RNA Transcription from a DNA Template").
Synthesis of the RNA strand takes place in the 5′ to 3′ direction, antiparallel to the template strand.
Only a short segment of the RNA molecule is hydrogen-bonded to the template strand at any time during transcription.
When transcription is completed, the RNA is released, and the DNA helix reforms.
The nucleotide sequence of the RNA strand formed during transcription is identical to that of the corresponding coding strand of the DNA, except that U replaces T. Figure 19.10 A Schematic Diagram of RNA Transcription from a DNA Template Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1090  The representation of RNA polymerase is proportionately much smaller than the actual molecule, which encompasses about 50 nucleotides at a time.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1091  EXAMPLE 2 A portion of the template strand of a gene has the sequence 5′-TCCATGAGTTGA-3′.
What is the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA that is formed from this template?
Solution Four things must be remembered in answering this question: (1) the DNA strand and the RNA strand being synthesized are antiparallel; (2) RNA is synthesized in a 5′ to 3′ direction, so transcription begins at the 3′ end of the template strand; (3) ribonucleotides are used in place of deoxyribonucleotides; and (4) thymine (T) base pairs with adenine (A), A base pairs with uracil (U; in RNA), and cytosine (C) base pairs with guanine (G).
The sequence is determined to be 3′-AGGUACUCAACU-5′ (can also be written as 5′-UCAACUCAUGGA-3′).
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
A portion of the template strand of a gene has the sequence 5′-CCAGTGAATTGCCTAT-3′.
What is the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA that is formed from this template?
Threetypes of RNA are formed during transcription: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).
These three types of RNA differ in function, size, and percentage of the total cell RNA (Table 19.2 "Properties of Cellular RNA in ").
mRNA makes up only a small percent of the total amount of RNA within the cell, primarily because each molecule of mRNA exists for a relatively short time; it is continuously being degraded and resynthesized.
The molecular dimensions of the mRNA molecule vary according to the amount of genetic information a given molecule contains.
After transcription, which takes place in the nucleus, the mRNA passes into the cytoplasm, carrying the genetic message from DNA to the ribosomes, the sites of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1092  protein synthesis.
In Section 19.5 "Mutations and Genetic Diseases", we shall see how mRNA directly determines the sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis.
Table 19.2 Properties of Cellular RNA in Escherichia coli Approximate Number of Percentage of Type Function Nucleotides Total Cell RNA mRNA codes for proteins 100–6,000 ~3 rRNA component of ribosomes 120–2900 83 adapter molecule that brings the amino acid to the tRNA ribosome 75–90 14 Ribosomes are cellular substructures where proteins are synthesized.
They contain about 65% rRNA and 35% protein, held together by numerous noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, in an overall structure consisting of two globular particles of unequal size.
Molecules of tRNA, which bring amino acids (one at a time) to the ribosomes for the construction of proteins, differ from one another in the kinds of amino acid each is specifically designed to carry.
A set of three nucleotides, known as a codon, on the mRNA determines which kind of tRNA will add its amino acid to the growing chain.
(For more information on sequences, see Section 19.4 "Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code".)
Each of the 20 amino acids found in proteins has at least one corresponding kind of tRNA, and most amino acids have more than one.
The two-dimensional structure of a tRNA molecule has three distinctive loops, reminiscent of a cloverleaf (Figure 19.11 "Transfer RNA").
On one loop is a sequence of three nucleotides that varies for each kind of tRNA.
This triplet, called the anticodon, is complementary to and pairs with the codon on the mRNA.
At the opposite end of the molecule is the acceptor stem, where the amino acid is attached.
Figure 19.11 Transfer RNA Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1093  (a) In the two-dimensional structure of a yeast tRNA molecule for phenylalanine, the amino acid binds to the acceptor stem located at the 3′ end of the tRNA primary sequence.

(c) This shows a space-filling model of the tRNA.

Describe the characteristics of the genetic code.
2.
Describe how a protein is synthesized from mRNA.
One of the definitions of a gene is as follows: a segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carrying the code for a specific polypeptide.
Each molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a transcribed copy of a gene that is used by a cell for synthesizing a polypeptide chain.
If a protein contains two or more different polypeptide chains, each chain is coded by a different gene.
We turn now to the question of how the sequence of nucleotides in a molecule of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is translated into an amino acid sequence.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1096  How can a molecule containing just 4 different nucleotides specify the sequence of the 20 amino acids that occur in proteins?
If each nucleotide coded for 1 amino acid, then obviously the nucleic acids could code for only 4 amino acids.
What if amino acids were coded for by groups of 2 nucleotides?
There are 42, or 16, different combinations of 2 nucleotides (AA, AU, AC, AG, UU, and so on).
Such a code is more extensive but still not adequate to code for 20 amino acids.
However, if the nucleotides are arranged in groups of 3, the number of different possible combinations is 43, or 64.
Here we have a code that is extensive enough to direct the synthesis of the primary structure of a protein molecule.
The genetic code can therefore be described as the identification of each group of three nucleotides and its particular amino acid.
The sequence of these triplet groups in the mRNA dictates the sequence of the amino acids in the protein.
Each individual three-nucleotide coding unit, as we have seen, is called a codon.
Protein synthesis is accomplished by orderly interactions between mRNA and the other ribonucleic acids (transfer RNA [tRNA] and ribosomal RNA [rRNA]), the ribosome, and more than 100 enzymes.
The mRNA formed in the nucleus during transcription is transported across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes—carrying with it the genetic instructions.
The process in which the information encoded in the mRNA is used to direct the sequencing of amino acids and thus ultimately to synthesize a protein is referred to as translation.
Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, it must be attached to its unique tRNA.
This crucial process requires an enzyme known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Figure 19.12 "Binding of an Amino Acid to Its tRNA").
There is a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid.
This high degree of specificity is vital to the incorporation of the correct amino acid into a protein.
After the amino acid molecule has been bound to its tRNA carrier, protein synthesis can take place.
Figure 19.13 "The Elongation Steps in Protein Synthesis" depicts a schematic stepwise representation of this all-important process.
Figure 19.12 Binding of an Amino Acid to Its tRNA Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1097  Figure 19.13 The Elongation Steps in Protein Synthesis Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1098  Early experimenters were faced with the task of determining which of the 64 possible codons stood for each of the 20 amino acids.
The cracking of the genetic code was the joint accomplishment of several well-known geneticists—notably Har Khorana, Marshall Nirenberg, Philip Leder, and Severo Ochoa—from 1961 to 1964.
The genetic dictionary they compiled, summarized in Figure 19.14 "The Genetic Code", shows that 61 codons code for amino acids, and 3 codons serve as signals for the termination of polypeptide Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1099  synthesis (much like the period at the end of a sentence).
Notice that only methionine (AUG) and tryptophan (UGG) have single codons.
All other amino acids have two or more codons.
Figure 19.14 The Genetic Code Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1100  EXAMPLE 3 A portion of an mRNA molecule has the sequence 5′-AUGCCACGAGUUGAC-3′.
What amino acid sequence does this code for?
Solution Use Figure 19.14 "The Genetic Code" to determine what amino acid each set of three nucleotides (codon) codes for.
Remember that the sequence is read starting from the 5′ end and that a protein is synthesized starting with the N-terminal amino acid.
The sequence 5′-AUGCCACGAGUUGAC-3′ codes for met-pro-arg-val-asp.
SKILL-BUILDING EXERCISE 1.
A portion of an RNA molecule has the sequence 5′-AUGCUGAAUUGCGUAGGA-3′.
What amino acid sequence does this code for?
Further experimentation threw much light on the nature of the genetic code, as follows: The code is virtually universal; animal, plant, and bacterial cells use the same 1. codons to specify each amino acid (with a few exceptions).
2.
The code is “degenerate”; in all but two cases (methionine and tryptophan), more than one triplet codes for a given amino acid.
3.
The first two bases of each codon are most significant; the third base often varies.
This suggests that a change in the third base by a mutation may still permit the correct incorporation of a given amino acid into a protein.
(For more information on mutations, see Section 19.5 "Mutations and Genetic Diseases".)
The third base is sometimes called the “wobble” base.
4.
The code is continuous and nonoverlapping; there are no nucleotides between codons, and adjacent codons do not overlap.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1101  5.
The three termination codons are read by special proteins called release factors, which signal the end of the translation process.
6.
The codon AUG codes for methionine and is also the initiation codon.
Thus methionine is the first amino acid in each newly synthesized polypeptide.
This first amino acid is usually removed enzymatically before the polypeptide chain is completed; the vast majority of polypeptides do not begin with methionine.

Explain how viruses reproduce in cells.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1104  Infectious diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and are among the most significant health problems in our society.
Viruses are infectious agents far smaller and simpler than bacteria that are composed of a tightly packed central core of nucleic acids enclosed in a protective shell.
The shell consists of layers of one or more proteins and may also have lipid or carbohydrate molecules on the surface.
Because of their simplicity, viruses must invade the cells of other organisms to be able to reproduce.
Viruses are visible only under an electron microscope.
They come in a variety of shapes, ranging from spherical to rod shaped.
The fact that they contain either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA)—but never both—allows them to be divided into two major classes: DNA viruses and RNA viruses (Figure 19.17 "Viruses").
Figure 19.17 Viruses Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1105  Viruses come in a variety of shapes that are determined by their protein coats.
A DNA virus enters a host cell and induces the cell to replicate the viral DNA and produce viral proteins.
These proteins and DNA assemble into new viruses that are released by the host cell, which may die in the process.
The new viruses can then invade other cells and repeat the cycle.
Cell death and the production of new viruses account for the symptoms of viral infections.
Most RNA viruses use their nucleic acids in much the same way as the DNA viruses, penetrating a host cell and inducing it to replicate the viral RNA and synthesize viral proteins.
The new RNA strands and viral proteins are then assembled into new viruses.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1106  Some RNA viruses, however, called retroviruses (Figure 19.18 "Life Cycle of a Retrovirus"), synthesize DNA in the host cell, in a process that is the reverse of the DNA- to-RNA transcription that normally occurs in cells.
(See Figure 19.10 "A Schematic Diagram of RNA Transcription from a DNA Template" for the transcription process.)
The synthesis of DNA from an RNA template is catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1107  Figure 19.18 Life Cycle of a Retrovirus Perhaps the best-known retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.
It is estimated that there are about 33 million people worldwide testing positive for HIV infections, many of whom have developed AIDS as a result.
In 2007 alone, 2.7 million people became infected with HIV, and in the same year, AIDS caused the deaths of approximately 2 million people.
The virus uses glycoproteins on its outer surface to attach to receptors on the surface of T cells, a group of white blood cells that normally help protect the body from infections.
The virus then enters the T cell, where it replicates and eventually destroys the cell.
With his or her T cells destroyed, the AIDS victim is at increased risk of succumbing to pneumonia or other infectious diseases.
In 1987, azidothymidine (AZT, also known as zidovudine or the brand name Retrovir) became the first drug approved for the treatment of AIDS.
It works by binding to reverse transcriptase in place of deoxythymidine triphosphate, after which, because AZT does not have a 3′OH group, further replication is blocked.
In the past 10 years, several other drugs have been approved that also act by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1108  As part of HIV reproduction in an infected cell, newly synthesized viral proteins must be cut by a specific viral-induced HIV protease to form shorter proteins.
An intensive research effort was made to design drugs that specifically inhibited this proteolytic enzyme, without affecting the proteolytic enzymes (like trypsin) that are needed by the host.
In December 1995, saquinavir (brand names Invirase and Fortovase) was approved for the treatment of AIDS.
This drug represented a new class of drugs known as protease inhibitors.
Other protease inhibitors soon gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval: ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and nelfinavir (Viracept).
Raltegravir (Isentress) is a newer anti-AIDS drug that was approved by the FDA in October 2007.
This drug inhibits the integrase enzyme that is needed to integrate the HIV DNA into cellular DNA, an essential step in the production of more HIV particles.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1109  A major problem in treating HIV infections is that the virus can become resistant to any of these drugs.
One way to combat the problem has been to administer a “cocktail” of drugs, typically a combination of two reverse transcriptase inhibitors along with a protease inhibitor.
These treatments can significantly reduce the amount of HIV in an infected person.

A cell’s hereditary information is encoded in chromosomes in the cell’s nucleus.
Each chromosome is composed of proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
The chromosomes contain smaller hereditary units called genes, which are relatively short segments of DNA.
The hereditary information is expressed or used through the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA).
Both nucleic acids—DNA and RNA—are polymers composed of monomers known as nucleotides, which in turn consist of phosphoric acid (H PO ), a nitrogenous base, and a pentose sugar.
3 4 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1112  The two types of nitrogenous bases most important in nucleic acids are purines— adenine (A) and guanine (G)—and pyrimidines—cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U).
DNA contains the nitrogenous bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, while the bases in RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil.
The sugar in the nucleotides of RNA is ribose; the one in DNA is 2-deoxyribose.
The sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid defines the primary structure of the molecule.
RNA is a single-chain nucleic acid, whereas DNA possesses two nucleic-acid chains intertwined in a secondary structure called a double helix.
The sugar-phosphate backbone forms the outside the double helix, with the purine and pyrimidine bases tucked inside.
Hydrogen bonding between complementary bases holds the two strands of the double helix together; A always pairs with T and C always pairs with G. Cell growth requires replication, or reproduction of the cell’s DNA.
The double helix unwinds, and hydrogen bonding between complementary bases breaks so that there are two single strands of DNA, and each strand is a template for the synthesis of a new strand.
For protein synthesis, three types of RNA are needed:messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).
All are made from a DNA template by a process called transcription.
The double helix uncoils, and ribonucleotides base-pair to the deoxyribonucleotides on one DNA strand; however, RNA is produced using uracil rather than thymine.
Once the RNA is formed, it dissociates from the template and leaves the nucleus, and the DNA double helix reforms.
Translation is the process in which proteins are synthesized from the information in mRNA.
It occurs at structures called ribosomes, which are located outside the nucleus and are composed of rRNA and protein.
The 64 possible three-nucleotide combinations of the 4 nucleotides of DNA constitute thegenetic code that dictates the sequence in which amino acids are joined to make proteins.
Each three-nucleotide sequence on mRNA is a codon.
Each kind of tRNA molecule binds a specific amino acid and has a site containing a three-nucleotide sequence called an anticodon.
The general term for any change in the genetic code in an organism’s DNA is mutation.
A change in which a single base is substituted, inserted, or deleted is a point Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1113  mutation.
The chemical and/or physical agents that cause mutations are called mutagens.
Diseases that occur due to mutations in critical DNA sequences are referred to as genetic diseases.
Viruses are infectious agents composed of a tightly packed central core of nucleic acids enclosed by a protective shell of proteins.
Viruses contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material but not both.
Some RNA viruses, calledretroviruses, synthesize DNA in the host cell from their RNA genome.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1119  Chapter 20 Energy Metabolism Opening Essay The discovery of the link between insulin and diabetes led to a period of intense research aimed at understanding exactly how insulin works in the body to regulate glucose levels.
Hormones in general act by binding to some protein, known as the hormone’s receptor, thus initiating a series of events that lead to a desired outcome.
In the early 1970s, the insulin receptor was purified, and researchers began to study what happens after insulin binds to its receptor and how those events are linked to the uptake and metabolism of glucose in cells.
The insulin receptor is located in the cell membrane and consists of four polypeptide chains: two identical chains called α chains and two identical chains called β chains.
The α chains, positioned on the outer surface of the membrane, consist of 735 amino acids each and contain the binding site for insulin.
The β chains are integral membrane proteins, each composed of 620 amino acids.
The binding of insulin to its receptor stimulates the β chains to catalyze the addition of phosphate groups to the specific side chains of tyrosine (referred to as phosphorylation) in the β chains and other cell proteins, leading to the activation of reactions that metabolize glucose.
In this chapter we will look at the pathway that breaks down glucose—in response to activation by insulin—for the purpose of providing energy for the cell.
Figure 20.1 Model of the Structure of the Insulin Receptor Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1120  Life requires energy.
Animals, for example, require heat energy to maintain body temperature, mechanical energy to move their limbs, and chemical energy to synthesize the compounds needed by their cells.
Living cells remain organized and functioning properly only through a continual supply of energy.
But only specific forms of energy can be used.
Supplying a plant with energy by holding it in a flame will not prolong its life.
On the other hand, a green plant is able to absorb radiant energy from the sun, the most abundant source of energy for life on the earth.
Plants use this energy first to form glucose and then to make other carbohydrates, as well as lipids and proteins.
Unlike plants, animals cannot directly use the sun’s energy to synthesize new compounds.
They must eat plants or other animals to get carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and the chemical energy stored in them (Figure 20.2 "Some Energy Transformations in Living Systems").
Once digested and transported to the cells, the nutrient molecules can be used in either of two ways: as building blocks for making new cell parts or repairing old ones or “burned” for energy.
Figure 20.2 Some Energy Transformations in Living Systems Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1121  Plants and animals exist in a cycle; each requires products of the other.
The thousands of coordinated chemical reactions that keep cells alive are referred to collectively as metabolism.
In general, metabolic reactions are divided into two classes: the breaking down of molecules to obtain energy is catabolism, and the building of new molecules needed by living systems is anabolism.
Note Any chemical compound that participates in a metabolic reaction is a metabolite.
Most of the energy required by animals is generated from lipids and carbohydrates.
These fuels must be oxidized, or “burned,” for the energy to be released.
The oxidation process ultimately converts the lipid or carbohydrate to carbon dioxide (CO ) and water 2 (H O).
2 Carbohydrate: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + 670 kcal Lipid: C H O + 23O → 16CO + 16H O + 2,385 kcal 16 32 2 2 2 2 These two equations summarize the biological combustion of a carbohydrate and a lipid by the cell through respiration.
Respiration is the collective name for all metabolic processes in which gaseous oxygen is used to oxidize organic matter to carbon dioxide, water, and energy.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1122  Like the combustion of the common fuels we burn in our homes and cars (wood, coal, gasoline), respiration uses oxygen from the air to break down complex organic substances to carbon dioxide and water.
But the energy released in the burning of wood is manifested entirely in the form of heat, and excess heat energy is not only useless but also injurious to the living cell.
Living organisms instead conserve much of the energy respiration releases by channeling it into a series of stepwise reactions that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or other compounds that ultimately lead to the synthesis of ATP.
The remainder of the energy is released as heat and manifested as body temperature.
Section 20.1 "ATP—the Universal Energy Currency" examines the structure of ATP and begins to explore its role as the chemical energy carrier of the body.
20.1 ATP—the Universal Energy Currency LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe the importance of ATP as a source of energy in living organisms.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide composed of adenine, ribose, and three phosphate groups, is perhaps the most important of the so-called energy-rich compounds in a cell.
Its concentration in the cell varies from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/mL of cell fluid.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1123  Energy-rich compounds are substances having particular structural features that lead to a release of energy after hydrolysis.
As a result, these compounds are able to supply energy for biochemical processes that require energy.
The structural feature important in ATP is the phosphoric acid anhydride, or pyrophosphate, linkage: The pyrophosphate bond, symbolized by a squiggle (~), is hydrolyzed when ATP is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
In this hydrolysis reaction, the products contain less energy than the reactants; there is a release of energy (> 7 kcal/mol).
One reason for the amount of energy released is that hydrolysis relieves the electron-electron repulsions experienced by the negatively charged phosphate groups when they are bonded to each other (Figure 20.3 "Hydrolysis of ATP to Form ADP").
Figure 20.3 Hydrolysis of ATP to Form ADP Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1124  Energy is released because the products (ADP and phosphate ion) have less energy than the reactants [ATP and water (H O)].
2 The general equation for ATP hydrolysis is as follows: ATP + H O → ADP + P + 7.4 kcal/mol 2 i If the hydrolysis of ATP releases energy, its synthesis (from ADP) requires energy.
In the cell, ATP is produced by those processes that supply energy to the organism (absorption of radiant energy from the sun in green plants and breakdown of food in animals), and it is hydrolyzed by those processes that require energy (the syntheses of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins; the transmission of nerve impulses; muscle contractions).
In fact, ATP is the principal medium of energy exchange in biological systems.
Many scientists call it the energy currency of cells.
Note P is the symbol for the inorganic phosphate anions H PO − and HPO 2−.
i 2 4 4 ATP is not the only high-energy compound needed for metabolism.
Several others are listed in Table 20.1 "Energy Released by Hydrolysis of Some Phosphate Compounds".
Notice, however, that the energy released when ATP is hydrolyzed is approximately midway between those of the high-energy and the low-energy phosphate compounds.
This means that the hydrolysis of ATP can provide energy for the phosphorylation of the compounds below it in the table.
For example, the hydrolysis of ATP provides sufficient energy for the phosphorylation of glucose to form glucose 1-phosphate.
By the same Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1125  token, the hydrolysis of compounds, such as creatine phosphate, that appearabove ATP in the table can provide the energy needed to resynthesize ATP from ADP.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1126  Table 20.1 Energy Released by Hydrolysis of Some Phosphate Compounds CONCEPT REVIEW EXERCISE Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1127  1.

3. a. yes b. no c. yes 20.2 Stage I of Catabolism LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe how carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are broken down during digestion.
We have said that animals obtain chemical energy from the food—carbohydrates, fats, and proteins—they eat through reactions defined collectively as catabolism.
We can think of catabolism as occurring in three stages (Figure 20.4 "Energy Conversions").
In stage I, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are broken down into their individual monomer units: carbohydrates into simple sugars, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids.
One part of stage I of catabolism is the breakdown of food molecules by hydrolysis reactions into the individual monomer units—which occurs in the mouth, stomach, and small intestine—and is referred to as digestion.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1129  In stage II, these monomer units (or building blocks) are further broken down through different reaction pathways, one of which produces ATP, to form a common end product that can then be used in stage III to produce even more ATP.
In this chapter, we will look at each stage of catabolism—as an overview and in detail.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1130  Figure 20.4 Energy Conversions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1131  The conversion of food into cellular energy (as ATP) occurs in three stages.
Digestion of Carbohydrates Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth (Figure 20.5 "The Principal Events and Sites of Carbohydrate Digestion"), where salivary α-amylase attacks the α-glycosidic linkages in starch, the main carbohydrate ingested by humans.
Cleavage of the glycosidic linkages produces a mixture of dextrins, maltose, and glucose.
(For more information about carbohydrates, see Chapter 16 "Carbohydrates".)
The α-amylase mixed into the food remains active as the food passes through the esophagus, but it is rapidly inactivated in the acidic environment of the stomach.
Figure 20.5 The Principal Events and Sites of Carbohydrate Digestion Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1132  The primary site of carbohydrate digestion is the small intestine.
The secretion of α- amylase in the small intestine converts any remaining starch molecules, as well as the dextrins, to maltose.
Maltose is then cleaved into two glucose molecules by maltase.
Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are not digested until they reach the small intestine, where they are acted on by sucrase and lactase, respectively.
The major Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1133  products of the complete hydrolysis of disaccharides and polysaccharides are three monosaccharide units: glucose, fructose, and galactose.
These are absorbed through the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream.
Digestion of Proteins Protein digestion begins in the stomach (Figure 20.6 "The Principal Events and Sites of Protein Digestion"), where the action of gastric juice hydrolyzes about 10% of the peptide bonds.
Gastric juice is a mixture of water (more than 99%), inorganic ions, hydrochloric acid, and various enzymes and other proteins.
Note The pain of a gastric ulcer is at least partially due to irritation of the ulcerated tissue by acidic gastric juice.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1134  Figure 20.6 The Principal Events and Sites of Protein Digestion The hydrochloric acid (HCl) in gastric juice is secreted by glands in the stomach lining.
The pH of freshly secreted gastric juice is about 1.0, but the contents of the stomach may raise the pH to between 1.5 and 2.5.
HCl helps to denature food proteins; that is, it unfolds the protein molecules to expose their chains to more efficient enzyme action.
The principal digestive component of gastric juice is pepsinogen, an inactive enzyme Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1135  produced in cells located in the stomach wall.
When food enters the stomach after a period of fasting, pepsinogen is converted to its active form—pepsin—in a series of steps initiated by the drop in pH.
Pepsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide linkages within protein molecules.
It has a fairly broad specificity but acts preferentially on linkages involving the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, as well as methionine and leucine.
Protein digestion is completed in the small intestine.
Pancreatic juice, carried from the pancreas via the pancreatic duct, contains inactive enzymes such as trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen.
They are activated in the small intestine as follows (Figure 20.7 "Activation of Some Pancreatic Enzymes in the Small Intestine"): The intestinal mucosal cells secrete the proteolytic enzyme enteropeptidase, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin; trypsin then activates chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin (and also completes the activation of trypsinogen).
Both of these active enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in protein chains.
Chymotrypsin preferentially attacks peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine).
Trypsin attacks peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of the basic amino acids (lysine and arginine).
Pancreatic juice also contains procarboxypeptidase, which is cleaved by trypsin to carboxypeptidase.
The latter is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide linkages at the free carboxyl end of the peptide chain, resulting in the stepwise liberation of free amino acids from the carboxyl end of the polypeptide.
Figure 20.7 Activation of Some Pancreatic Enzymes in the Small Intestine Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1136  Aminopeptidases in the intestinal juice remove amino acids from the N-terminal end of peptides and proteins possessing a free amino group.
Figure 20.8 "Hydrolysis of a Peptide by Several Peptidases" illustrates the specificity of these protein-digesting enzymes.
The amino acids that are released by protein digestion are absorbed across the intestinal wall into the circulatory system, where they can be used for protein synthesis.
Figure 20.8 Hydrolysis of a Peptide by Several Peptidases Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1137  This diagram illustrates where in a peptide the different peptidases we have discussed would catalyze hydrolysis the peptide bonds.
Digestion of Lipids Lipid digestion begins in the upper portion of the small intestine (Figure 20.9 "The Principal Events and Sites of Lipid (Primarily Triglyceride) Digestion").
A hormone secreted in this region stimulates the gallbladder to discharge bile into the duodenum.
The principal constituents of bile are the bile salts, which emulsify large, water-insoluble lipid droplets, disrupting some of the hydrophobic interactions holding the lipid molecules together and suspending the resulting smaller globules (micelles) in the aqueous digestive medium.
(For more information on bile salts, see Chapter 17 "Lipids", Section 17.4 "Steroids".)
These changes greatly increase the surface area of the lipid particles, allowing for more intimate contact with the lipases and thus rapid digestion of the fats.
Another hormone promotes the secretion of pancreatic juice, which contains these enzymes.
Figure 20.9 The Principal Events and Sites of Lipid (Primarily Triglyceride) Digestion Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1138  The lipases in pancreatic juice catalyze the digestion of triglycerides first to diglycerides and then to 2-monoglycerides and fatty acids: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1139  The monoglycerides and fatty acids cross the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides and transported as lipoprotein complexes known as chylomicrons.
Phospholipids and cholesteryl esters undergo similar hydrolysis in the small intestine, and their component molecules are also absorbed through the intestinal lining.
The further metabolism of monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids released in stage I of catabolism occurs in stages II and III of catabolism.

Describe the role of acetyl-CoA in metabolism.
A metabolic pathway is a series of biochemical reactions by which an organism converts a given reactant to a specific end product.
As you will learn in Section 20.5 "Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism" through Section 20.7 "Stage II of Protein Catabolism", there are specific metabolic pathways—which are different for carbohydrates, triglycerides, and proteins—that break down the products of stage I of catabolism (monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids) to produce a common end product, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in stage II of catabolism.
Acetyl-CoA is shown in Figure 20.10 "The Structure of Acetyl-Coenzyme A (Acetyl- CoA)".
The acetyl unit, derived (as we will see) from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, is attached to coenzyme A, making the acetyl unit more reactive.
Acetyl-CoA is used in a myriad of biochemical pathways.
For example, it may be used as the starting material for the biosynthesis of lipids (such as triglycerides, phospholipids, or cholesterol and other steroids).
Most importantly for energy generation, it may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, if energy is needed and oxygen is available.
The various fates or uses of acetyl-CoA are summarized in Figure 20.11 "Cell Chemistry".

Describe the reactions of the citric acid cycle.
2.
Describe the function of the citric acid cycle and identify the products produced.
3.
Describe the role of the electron transport chain in energy metabolism.
4.
Describe the role of oxidative phosphorylation in energy metabolism.
The acetyl group enters a cyclic sequence of reactions known collectively as the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle).
The cyclical design of this complex series of reactions, which bring about the oxidation of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide and water, was first proposed by Hans Krebs in 1937.
(He was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.)
Acetyl-CoA’s entrance into the citric acid cycle is the beginning of stage III of catabolism.
The citric acid cycle produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH ), and metabolic 2 intermediates for the synthesis of needed compounds.
Steps of the Citric Acid Cycle At first glance, the citric acid cycle appears rather complex (Figure 20.12 "Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle").
All the reactions, however, are familiar types in organic Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1146  chemistry: hydration, oxidation, decarboxylation, and hydrolysis.
Each reaction of the citric acid cycle is numbered, and in Figure 20.12 "Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle", the two acetyl carbon atoms are highlighted in red.
Each intermediate in the cycle is a carboxylic acid, existing as an anion at physiological pH.
All the reactions occur within the mitochondria, which are small organelles within the cells of plants and animals.
We will look more closely at the structure of mitochondria in Section 20.5 "Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism".
Figure 20.12 Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle In the first reaction, acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, and the acetyl group is transferred onto oxaloacetate, yielding citrate.
Note that this step releases coenzyme A.
The reaction is catalyzed by citrate synthase.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1147  In the next step, aconitase catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate.
In this reaction, a tertiary alcohol, which cannot be oxidized, is converted to a secondary alcohol, which can be oxidized in the next step.
Isocitrate then undergoes a reaction known as oxidative decarboxylation because the alcohol is oxidized and the molecule is shortened by one carbon atom with the release of carbon dioxide (decarboxylation).
The reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the product of the reaction is α-ketoglutarate.
An important reaction linked to this is the reduction of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH.
The NADH is ultimately reoxidized, and the energy released is used in the synthesis of ATP, as we shall see.
The fourth step is another oxidative decarboxylation.
This time α-ketoglutarate is converted to succinyl-CoA, and another molecule of NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
The α- ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes this reaction.
This is the only irreversible reaction in the citric acid cycle.
As such, it prevents the cycle from operating in the reverse direction, in which acetyl-CoA would be synthesized from carbon dioxide.
Comment: So far, in the first four steps, two carbon atoms have entered the cycle as an acetyl group, and two carbon atoms have been released as molecules of carbon dioxide.
The remaining reactions of the citric acid cycle use the four carbon atoms of the succinyl group to resynthesize a molecule of oxaloacetate, which is the compound needed to combine with an incoming acetyl group and begin another round of the cycle.
In the fifth reaction, the energy released by the hydrolysis of the high-energy thioester bond of succinyl-CoA is used to form guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase.
This step is the only reaction in the citric acid cycle that directly forms a high-energy phosphate compound.
GTP can readily transfer its terminal phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to generate ATP in the presence of nucleoside diphosphokinase.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1148  Succinate dehydrogenase then catalyzes the removal of two hydrogen atoms from succinate, forming fumarate.
This oxidation-reduction reaction uses flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), rather than NAD+, as the oxidizing agent.
Succinate dehydrogenase is the only enzyme of the citric acid cycle located within the inner mitochondrial membrane.
We will see soon the importance of this.
In the following step, a molecule of water is added to the double bond of fumarate to form L-malate in a reaction catalyzed by fumarase.
One revolution of the cycle is completed with the oxidation of L-malate to oxaloacetate, brought about by malate dehydrogenase.
This is the third oxidation-reduction reaction that uses NAD+ as the oxidizing agent.
Oxaloacetate can accept an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA, allowing the cycle to begin again.
Cellular Respiration Respiration can be defined as the process by which cells oxidize organic molecules in the presence of gaseous oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of ATP.
We have seen that two carbon atoms enter the citric acid cycle from acetyl-CoA (step 1), and two different carbon atoms exit the cycle as carbon dioxide (steps 3 and 4).
Yet nowhere in our discussion of the citric acid cycle have we indicated how oxygen is used.
Recall, however, that in the four oxidation-reduction steps occurring in the citric acid cycle, the coenzyme NAD+ or FAD is reduced to NADH or FADH , 2 respectively.
Oxygen is needed to reoxidize these coenzymes.
Recall, too, that very little Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1149  ATP is obtained directly from the citric acid cycle.
Instead, oxygen participation and significant ATP production occur subsequent to the citric acid cycle, in two pathways that are closely linked: electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.
All the enzymes and coenzymes for the citric acid cycle, the reoxidation of NADH and FADH and the production of ATP are located in the mitochondria, which are small, 2, oval organelles with double membranes, often referred to as the “power plants” of the cell (Figure 20.13 "Respiration").
A cell may contain 100–5,000 mitochondria, depending on its function, and the mitochondria can reproduce themselves if the energy requirements of the cell increase.
Figure 20.13 Respiration Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria.
Figure 20.13 "Respiration" shows the mitochondrion’s two membranes: outer andinner.
The inner membrane is extensively folded into a series of internal ridges calledcristae.
Thus there are two compartments in mitochondria: the intermembrane space, which lies between the membranes, and the matrix, which lies inside the inner membrane.
The Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1150  outer membrane is permeable, whereas the inner membrane is impermeable to most molecules and ions, although water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide can freely penetrate both membranes.
The matrix contains all the enzymes of the citric acid cycle with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, which is embedded in the inner membrane.
The enzymes that are needed for the reoxidation of NADH and FADH and ATP production 2 are also located in the inner membrane.
They are arranged in specific positions so that they function in a manner analogous to a bucket brigade.
This highly organized sequence of oxidation-reduction enzymes is known as the electron transport chain (or respiratory chain).
Electron Transport Figure 20.14 "The Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthase"illustrates the organization of the electron transport chain.
The components of the chain are organized into four complexes designated I, II, III, and IV.
Each complex contains several enzymes, other proteins, and metal ions.
The metal ions can be reduced and then oxidized repeatedly as electrons are passed from one component to the next.
Recall from Chapter 5 "Introduction to Chemical Reactions", Section 5.5 "Oxidation- Reduction (Redox) Reactions", that a compound is reduced when it gains electrons or hydrogen atoms and is oxidized when it loses electrons or hydrogen atoms.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1151  Figure 20.14 The Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthase The red line shows the path of electrons.
Electrons can enter the electron transport chain through either complex I or II.
We will look first at electrons entering at complex I.
These electrons come from NADH, which is formed in three reactions of the citric acid cycle.
Let’s use step 8 as an example, the reaction in which L-malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate and NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
This reaction can be divided into two half reactions: Oxidation half-reaction: Reduction half-reaction: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1152  In the oxidation half-reaction, two hydrogen (H+) ions and two electrons are removed from the substrate.
In the reduction half-reaction, the NAD+ molecule accepts both of those electrons and one of the H+ ions.
The other H+ ion is transported from the matrix, across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and into the intermembrane space.
The NADH diffuses through the matrix and is bound by complex I of the electron transport chain.
In the complex, the coenzyme flavin mononucleotide (FMN) accepts both electrons from NADH.
By passing the electrons along, NADH is oxidized back to NAD+ and FMN is reduced to FMNH (reduced form of flavin mononucleotide).
Again, 2 the reaction can be illustrated by dividing it into its respective half-reactions.
Oxidation half-reaction: Reduction half-reaction: Complex I contains several proteins that have iron-sulfur (Fe·S) centers.
The electrons that reduced FMN to FMNH are now transferred to these proteins.
The iron ions in the 2 Fe·S centers are in the Fe(III) form at first, but by accepting an electron, each ion is reduced to the Fe(II) form.
Because each Fe·S center can transfer only one electron, two centers are needed to accept the two electrons that will regenerate FMN.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1153  Oxidation half-reaction: FMNH → FMN + 2H+ + 2e− 2 Reduction half-reaction: 2Fe(III) · S + 2e− → 2Fe(II) · S Electrons from FADH , formed in step 6 of the citric acid cycle, enter the electron 2 transport chain through complex II.
Succinate dehydrogenase, the enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes the formation of FADH from FAD is part of complex II.
The 2 electrons from FADH are then transferred to an Fe·S protein.
2 Oxidation half-reaction: FADH → FAD + 2H+ + 2e− 2 Reduction half-reaction: 2Fe(III) · S + 2e− → 2Fe(II) · S Electrons from complexes I and II are then transferred from the Fe·S protein to coenzyme Q (CoQ), a mobile electron carrier that acts as the electron shuttle between complexes I or II and complex III.
Note Coenzyme Q is also called ubiquinone because it is ubiquitous in living systems.
Oxidation half-reaction: 2Fe(II) · S → 2Fe(III) · S + 2e− Reduction half-reaction: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1154  Complexes III and IV include several iron-containing proteins known as cytochromes.
The iron in these enzymes is located in substructures known as iron porphyrins (Figure 20.15 "An Iron Porphyrin").
Like the Fe·S centers, the characteristic feature of the cytochromes is the ability of their iron atoms to exist as either Fe(II) or Fe(III).
Thus, each cytochrome in its oxidized form—Fe(III)—can accept one electron and be reduced to the Fe(II) form.
This change in oxidation state is reversible, so the reduced form can donate its electron to the next cytochrome, and so on.
Complex III contains cytochromes b and c, as well as Fe·S proteins, with cytochrome c acting as the electron shuttle between complex III and IV.
Complex IV contains cytochromes a and a in an enzyme 3 known as cytochrome oxidase.
This enzyme has the ability to transfer electrons to molecular oxygen, the last electron acceptor in the chain of electron transport reactions.
In this final step, water (H O) is formed.
2 Oxidation half-reaction: 4Cyt a –Fe(II) → 4Cyt a –Fe(III) + 4e− 3 3 Reduction half-reaction: O + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H O 2 2 Figure 20.15 An Iron Porphyrin Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1155  Iron porphyrins are present in cytochromes as well as in myoglobin and hemoglobin.
Oxidative Phosphorylation Each intermediate compound in the electron transport chain is reduced by the addition of one or two electrons in one reaction and then subsequently restored to its original form by delivering the electron(s) to the next compound along the chain.
The successive electron transfers result in energy production.
But how is this energy used for the synthesis of ATP?
The process that links ATP synthesis to the operation of the electron transport chain is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation.
Electron transport is tightly coupled to oxidative phosphorylation.
The coenzymes NADH and FADH are oxidized by the respiratory chain only if ADP is simultaneously 2 phosphorylated to ATP.
The currently accepted model explaining how these two processes are linked is known as the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which was proposed by Peter Mitchell, resulting in Mitchell being awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Looking again at Figure 20.14 "The Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthase", we see that as electrons are being transferred through the electron transport chain, hydrogen (H+) ions are being transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix to the intermembrane space.
The concentration of H+ is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1156  already higher in the intermembrane space than in the matrix, so energy is required to transport the additional H+ there.
This energy comes from the electron transfer reactions in the electron transport chain.
But how does the extreme difference in H+concentration then lead to ATP synthesis?
The buildup of H+ ions in the intermembrane space results in an H+ ion gradient that is a large energy source, like water behind a dam (because, given the opportunity, the protons will flow out of the intermembrane space and into the less concentrated matrix).
Current research indicates that the flow of H+ down this concentration gradient through a fifth enzyme complex, known as ATP synthase, leads to a change in the structure of the synthase, causing the synthesis and release of ATP.
In cells that are using energy, the turnover of ATP is very high, so these cells contain high levels of ADP.
They must therefore consume large quantities of oxygen continuously, so as to have the energy necessary to phosphorylate ADP to form ATP.
Consider, for example, that resting skeletal muscles use about 30% of a resting adult’s oxygen consumption, but when the same muscles are working strenuously, they account for almost 90% of the total oxygen consumption of the organism.
Experiment has shown that 2.5–3 ATP molecules are formed for every molecule of NADH oxidized in the electron transport chain, and 1.5–2 ATP molecules are formed for every molecule of FADH oxidized.
Table 20.2 "Maximum Yield of ATP from the 2 Complete Oxidation of 1 Mol of Acetyl-CoA" summarizes the theoretical maximum yield of ATP produced by the complete oxidation of 1 mol of acetyl-CoA through the sequential action of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.

20.5 Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Describe the function of glycolysis and identify its major products.
2.
Describe how the presence or absence of oxygen determines what happens to the pyruvate and the NADH that are produced in glycolysis.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1161  3.
Determine the amount of ATP produced by the oxidation of glucose in the presence and absence of oxygen.
In stage II of catabolism, the metabolic pathway known as glycolysis converts glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound with three carbon atoms) with the corresponding production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
The individual reactions in glycolysis were determined during the first part of the 20th century.
It was the first metabolic pathway to be elucidated, in part because the participating enzymes are found in soluble form in the cell and are readily isolated and purified.
The pathway is structured so that the product of one enzyme-catalyzed reaction becomes the substrate of the next.
The transfer of intermediates from one enzyme to the next occurs by diffusion.
Steps in Glycolysis The 10 reactions of glycolysis, summarized in Figure 20.16 "Glycolysis", can be divided into two phases.
In the first 5 reactions—phase I—glucose is broken down into two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
In the last five reactions—phase II—each glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is converted into pyruvate, and ATP is generated.
Notice that all the intermediates in glycolysis are phosphorylated and contain either six or three carbon atoms.
Figure 20.16 Glycolysis Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1162  When glucose enters a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated to form glucose 6- phosphate, in the first reaction of phase I.
The phosphate donor in this reaction is ATP, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1163  and the enzyme—which requires magnesium ions for its activity—is hexokinase.
In this reaction, ATP is being used rather than being synthesized.
The presence of such a reaction in a catabolic pathway that is supposed to generate energy may surprise you.
However, in addition to activating the glucose molecule, this initial reaction is essentially irreversible, an added benefit that keeps the overall process moving in the right direction.
Furthermore, the addition of the negatively charged phosphate group prevents the intermediates formed in glycolysis from diffusing through the cell membrane, as neutral molecules such as glucose can do.
In the next reaction, phosphoglucose isomerase catalyzes the isomerization of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate.
This reaction is important because it creates a primary alcohol, which can be readily phosphorylated.
The subsequent phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to form fructose 1,6- bisphosphate is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase, which requires magnesium ions for activity.
ATP is again the phosphate donor.
Note When a molecule contains two phosphate groups on different carbon atoms, the convention is to use the prefix bis.
When the two phosphate groups are bonded to each other on the same carbon atom (for example, adenosine diphosphate [ADP]), the prefix is di.
Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is enzymatically cleaved by aldolase to form two triose phosphates: dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
Isomerization of dihydroxyacetone phosphate into a second molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the final step in phase I.
The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is triose phosphate isomerase.
Comment: In steps 4 and 5, aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase effectively convert one molecule of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
Thus, phase I of glycolysis requires energy in the form of two molecules of ATP and releases none of the energy stored in glucose.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1164  In the initial step of phase II, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is both oxidized and phosphorylated in a reaction catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as the oxidizing agent and inorganic phosphate as the phosphate donor.
In the reaction, NAD+ is reduced to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and 1,3- bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) is formed.
BPG has a high-energy phosphate bond (see Table 20.1 "Energy Released by Hydrolysis of Some Phosphate Compounds") joining a phosphate group to C1.
This phosphate group is now transferred directly to a molecule of ADP, thus forming ATP and 3- phosphoglycerate.
The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is phosphoglycerate kinase, which, like all other kinases, requires magnesium ions to function.
This is the first reaction to produce ATP in the pathway.
Because the ATP is formed by a direct transfer of a phosphate group from a metabolite to ADP—that is, from one substrate to another— the process is referred to as substrate-level phosphorylation, to distinguish it from the oxidative phosphorylation discussed in Section 20.4 "Stage III of Catabolism".
In the next reaction, the phosphate group on 3-phosphoglycerate is transferred from the OH group of C3 to the OH group of C2, forming 2-phosphoglycerate in a reaction catalyzed by phosphoglyceromutase.
A dehydration reaction, catalyzed by enolase, forms phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), another compound possessing a high-energy phosphate group.
The final step is irreversible and is the second reaction in which substrate-level phosphorylation occurs.
The phosphate group of PEP is transferred to ADP, with one molecule of ATP being produced per molecule of PEP.
The reaction is catalyzed bypyruvate kinase, which requires both magnesium and potassium ions to be active.
Comment: In phase II, two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are converted to two molecules of pyruvate, along with the production of four molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH.
To Your Health: Diabetes Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1165  Most of the chapter-opening essays in Chapter 16 "Carbohydrates" throughChapter 20 "Energy Metabolism" have touched on different aspects of diabetes and the role of insulin in its causation and treatment.
Although medical science has made significant progress against this disease, it continues to be a major health threat.
Some of the serious complications of diabetes are as follows:  It is the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States.
 It is the leading cause of blindness in adults over age 20.
 It is the leading cause of kidney failure.
 It increases the risk of having a heart attack or stroke by two to four times.
Because a person with diabetes is unable to use glucose properly, excessive quantities accumulate in the blood and the urine.
Other characteristic symptoms are constant hunger, weight loss, extreme thirst, and frequent urination because the kidneys excrete large amounts of water in an attempt to remove excess sugar from the blood.
There are two types of diabetes.
In immune-mediated diabetes, insufficient amounts of insulin are produced.
This type of diabetes develops early in life and is also known as Type 1 diabetes, as well as insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes.
Symptoms are rapidly reversed by the administration of insulin, and Type 1 diabetics can lead active lives provided they receive insulin as needed.
Because insulin is a protein that is readily digested in the small intestine, it cannot be taken orally and must be injected at least once a day.
In Type 1 diabetes, insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the body’s immune system.
Researchers are still trying to find out why.
Meanwhile, they have developed a simple blood test capable of predicting who will develop Type 1 diabetes several years before the disease becomes apparent.
The blood test reveals the presence of antibodies that destroy the body’s insulin-producing cells.
Type 2 diabetes, also known as noninsulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes, is by far the more common, representing about 95% of diagnosed diabetic cases.
(This translates to about 16 million Americans.)
Type 2 diabetics usually produce sufficient amounts of insulin, but either the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas do not release enough of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1166  it, or it is not used properly because of defective insulin receptors or a lack of insulin receptors on the target cells.
In many of these people, the disease can be controlled with a combination of diet and exercise alone.
For some people who are overweight, losing weight is sufficient to bring their blood sugar level into the normal range, after which medication is not required if they exercise regularly and eat wisely.
Those who require medication may use oral antidiabetic drugs that stimulate the islet cells to secrete insulin.
First-generation antidiabetic drugs stimulated the release of insulin.
Newer second-generation drugs, such as glyburide, do as well, but they also increase the sensitivity of cell receptors to insulin.
Some individuals with Type 2 diabetes do not produce enough insulin and thus do not respond to these oral medications; they must use insulin.
In both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, the blood sugar level must be carefully monitored and adjustments made in diet or medication to keep the level as normal as possible (70–120 mg/dL).
Metabolism of Pyruvate The presence or absence of oxygen determines the fates of the pyruvate and the NADH produced in glycolysis.
When plenty of oxygen is available, pyruvate is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide, with the release of much greater amounts of ATP through Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1167  the combined actions of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.
(For more information about oxidative phosphorylation, see Section 20.4 "Stage III of Catabolism".)
However, in the absence of oxygen (that is, under anaerobic conditions), the fate of pyruvate is different in different organisms.
In vertebrates, pyruvate is converted to lactate, while other organisms, such as yeast, convert pyruvate to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
These possible fates of pyruvate are summarized in Figure 20.17 "Metabolic Fates of Pyruvate".
The conversion to lactate or ethanol under anaerobic conditions allows for the reoxidation of NADH to NAD+ in the absence of oxygen.
Figure 20.17 Metabolic Fates of Pyruvate ATP Yield from Glycolysis The net energy yield from anaerobic glucose metabolism can readily be calculated in moles of ATP.
In the initial phosphorylation of glucose (step 1), 1 mol of ATP is expended, along with another in the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate (step 3).
In step 7, 2 mol of BPG (recall that 2 mol of 1,3-BPG are formed for each mole of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1168  glucose) are converted to 2 mol of 3-phosphoglycerate, and 2 mol of ATP are produced.
In step 10, 2 mol of pyruvate and 2 mol of ATP are formed per mole of glucose.
For every mole of glucose degraded, 2 mol of ATP are initially consumed and 4 mol of ATP are ultimately produced.
The net production of ATP is thus 2 mol for each mole of glucose converted to lactate or ethanol.
If 7.4 kcal of energy is conserved per mole of ATP produced, and the total amount of energy that can theoretically be obtained from the complete oxidation of 1 mol of glucose is 670 kcal (as stated in the chapter introduction), the energy conserved in the anaerobic catabolism of glucose to two molecules of lactate (or ethanol) is as follows: Thus anaerobic cells extract only a very small fraction of the total energy of the glucose molecule.
Contrast this result with the amount of energy obtained when glucose is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation as summarized in Table 20.3 "Maximum Yield of ATP from the Complete Oxidation of 1 Mol of Glucose".
Note the indication in the table that a variable amount of ATP is synthesized, depending on the tissue, from the NADH formed in the cytoplasm during glycolysis.
This is because NADH is not transported into the inner mitochondrial membrane where the enzymes for the electron transport chain are located.
Instead, brain and muscle cells use a transport mechanism that passes electrons from the cytoplasmic NADH through the membrane to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecules inside the mitochondria, forming reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH ), which then feeds the electrons 2 into the electron transport chain.
This route lowers the yield of ATP to 1.5–2 molecules of ATP, rather than the usual 2.5–3 molecules.
A more efficient transport system is found in liver, heart, and kidney cells where the formation of one cytoplasmic NADH molecule results in the formation of one mitochondrial NADH molecule, which leads to the formation of 2.5–3 molecules of ATP.

In comparison, automobiles are only about 20%–25% efficient in using the energy released by the combustion of gasoline.
As indicated earlier, the 58% of released energy that is not conserved enters the surroundings (that is, the cell) as heat that helps to maintain body temperature.
If we are exercising strenuously and our metabolism speeds up to provide the energy needed for muscle contraction, more heat is produced.
We begin to perspire to dissipate some of that heat.
As the perspiration evaporates, the excess heat is carried away from the body by the departing water vapor.

20.6 Stage II of Lipid Catabolism LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.
Describe the reactions needed to completely oxidize a fatty acid to carbon dioxide and water.
Like glucose, the fatty acids released in the digestion of triglycerides and other lipids are broken down in a series of sequential reactions accompanied by the gradual release of usable energy.
Some of these reactions are oxidative and require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).
The enzymes that participate in fatty acid catabolism are located in the mitochondria, along with the enzymes of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.
This localization of enzymes in the mitochondria is of the utmost importance because it facilitates efficient utilization of energy stored in fatty acids and other molecules.
Fatty acid oxidation is initiated on the outer mitochondrial membrane.
There the fatty acids, which like carbohydrates are relatively inert, must first be activated by conversion to an energy-rich fatty acid derivative of coenzyme A called fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA).
The activation is catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase.
For each molecule of fatty acid activated, one molecule of coenzyme A and one molecule of adenosine triphosphate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1175  (ATP) are used, equaling a net utilization of the two high-energy bonds in one ATP molecule (which is therefore converted to adenosine monophosphate [AMP] rather than adenosine diphosphate [ADP]): The fatty acyl-CoA diffuses to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it combines with a carrier molecule known as carnitine in a reaction catalyzed by carnitine acyltransferase.
The acyl-carnitine derivative is transported into the mitochondrial matrix and converted back to the fatty acyl-CoA.
Steps in the β-Oxidation of Fatty Acids Further oxidation of the fatty acyl-CoA occurs in the mitochondrial matrix via a sequence of four reactions known collectively as β-oxidation because the β-carbon undergoes successive oxidations in the progressive removal of two carbon atoms from the carboxyl end of the fatty acyl-CoA (Figure 20.18 "Fatty Acid Oxidation").
Figure 20.18 Fatty Acid Oxidation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1176  The fatty acyl-CoA formed in the final step becomes the substrate for the first step in the next round of β-oxidation.
β-oxidation continues until two acetyl-CoA molecules are produced in the final step.
The first step in the catabolism of fatty acids is the formation of an alkene in an oxidation reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
In this reaction, the coenzyme FAD accepts two hydrogen atoms from the acyl-CoA, one from the α-carbon and one from the β-carbon, forming reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH ).
2 Note Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1177  The FADH is reoxidized back to FAD via the electron transport chain.
(For more 2 information about the electron transport chain, see Section 20.4 "Stage III of Catabolism".)
This supplies energy to form 1.5–2 molecules of ATP.
Next, the trans-alkene is hydrated to form a secondary alcohol in a reaction catalyzed by enoyl-CoA hydratase.
The enzyme forms only the L-isomer.
The secondary alcohol is then oxidized to a ketone by β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, with NAD+ acting as the oxidizing agent.
The reoxidation of each molecule of NADH to NAD+ by the electron transport chain furnishes 2.5–3 molecules of ATP.
The final reaction is cleavage of the β-ketoacyl-CoA by a molecule of coenzyme A.
The products are acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA that has been shortened by two carbon atoms.
The reaction is catalyzed by thiolase.
The shortened fatty acyl-CoA is then degraded by repetitions of these four steps, each time releasing a molecule of acetyl-CoA.
The overall equation for the β-oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA (16 carbon atoms) is as follows: Note Because each shortened fatty acyl-CoA cycles back to the beginning of the pathway, β- oxidation is sometimes referred to as the fatty acid spiral.
The fate of the acetyl-CoA obtained from fatty acid oxidation depends on the needs of an organism.
It may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, it may be used for the formation of water-soluble derivatives known as ketone bodies, or it may serve as the starting material for the synthesis of fatty acids.
(For more information about the citric acid cycle, see Section 20.4 "Stage III of Catabolism".)
Looking Closer: Ketone Bodies Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1178  In the liver, most of the acetyl-CoA obtained from fatty acid oxidation is oxidized by the citric acid cycle.
However, some of the acetyl-CoA is used to synthesize a group of compounds known as ketone bodies: acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone.
Two acetyl-CoA molecules combine, in a reversal of the final step of β-oxidation, to produce acetoacetyl-CoA.
The acetoacetyl-CoA reacts with another molecule of acetyl-CoA and water to form β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is then cleaved to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA.
Most of the acetoacetate is reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate, while a small amount is decarboxylated to carbon dioxide and acetone.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1179  The acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate synthesized by the liver are released into the blood for use as a metabolic fuel (to be converted back to acetyl-CoA) by other tissues, particularly the kidney and the heart.
Thus, during prolonged starvation, ketone bodies provide about 70% of the energy requirements of the brain.
Under normal conditions, the kidneys excrete about 20 mg of ketone bodies each day, and the blood levels are maintained at about 1 mg of ketone bodies per 100 mL of blood.
In starvation, diabetes mellitus, and certain other physiological conditions in which cells do not receive sufficient amounts of carbohydrate, the rate of fatty acid oxidation increases to provide energy.
This leads to an increase in the concentration of acetyl-CoA.
The increased acetyl-CoA cannot be oxidized by the citric acid cycle because of a decrease in the concentration of oxaloacetate, which is diverted to glucose synthesis.
In response, the rate of ketone body formation in the liver increases further, to a level much higher than can be used by other tissues.
The excess ketone bodies accumulate in the blood and the urine, a condition referred to as ketosis.
When the acetone in the blood reaches the lungs, its volatility causes it to be expelled in the breath.
The sweet smell of acetone, a characteristic of ketosis, is frequently noticed on the breath of severely diabetic patients.
Because two of the three kinds of ketone bodies are weak acids, their presence in the blood in excessive amounts overwhelms the blood buffers and causes a marked decrease in blood pH (to 6.9 from a normal value of 7.4).
This decrease in pH leads to a serious condition known as acidosis.
One of the effects of acidosis is a decrease in the ability of hemoglobin to transport oxygen in the blood.
In moderate to severe acidosis, breathing becomes labored and very painful.
The body also loses fluids and becomes dehydrated as the kidneys attempt to get rid of the acids by eliminating large quantities of water.
The lowered oxygen supply and dehydration lead to depression; even mild acidosis leads to lethargy, loss of appetite, and a generally run-down feeling.
Untreated patients may go into a coma.
At that point, prompt treatment is necessary if the person’s life is to be saved.
ATP Yield from Fatty Acid Oxidation Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1180  The amount of ATP obtained from fatty acid oxidation depends on the size of the fatty acid being oxidized.
For our purposes here.
we’ll study palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms, as a typical fatty acid in the human diet.
Calculating its energy yield provides a model for determining the ATP yield of all other fatty acids.
The breakdown by an organism of 1 mol of palmitic acid requires 1 mol of ATP (for activation) and forms 8 mol of acetyl-CoA.
Recall from Table 20.2 "Maximum Yield of ATP from the Complete Oxidation of 1 Mol of Acetyl-CoA" that each mole of acetyl-CoA metabolized by the citric acid cycle yields 10 mol of ATP.
The complete degradation of 1 mol of palmitic acid requires the β-oxidation reactions to be repeated seven times.
Thus, 7 mol of NADH and 7 mol of FADH are produced.
Reoxidation of these compounds 2 through respiration yields 2.5–3 and 1.5–2 mol of ATP, respectively.
The energy calculations can be summarized as follows: 1 mol of ATP is split to AMP and 2P −2 ATP i 8 mol of acetyl-CoA formed (8 × 12) 96 ATP 7 mol of FADH formed (7 × 2) 14 ATP 2 7 mol of NADH formed (7 × 3) 21 ATP Total 129 ATP Note The number of times β-oxidation is repeated for a fatty acid containing n carbon atoms is n/2 – 1 because the final turn yields two acetyl-CoA molecules.
The combustion of 1 mol of palmitic acid releases a considerable amount of energy: C H O + 23O → 16CO + 16H O + 2,340 kcal 16 32 2 2 2 2 The percentage of this energy that is conserved by the cell in the form of ATP is as follows: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1181  The efficiency of fatty acid metabolism is comparable to that of carbohydrate metabolism, which we calculated to be 42%.
For more information about the efficiency of fatty acid metabolism, see Section 20.5 "Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism".)
Note The oxidation of fatty acids produces large quantities of water.
This water, which sustains migratory birds and animals (such as the camel) for long periods of time.

Describe how excess amino acids are degraded.
The liver is the principal site of amino acid metabolism, but other tissues, such as the kidney, the small intestine, muscles, and adipose tissue, take part.
Generally, the first step in the breakdown of amino acids is the separation of the amino group from the carbon skeleton, usually by a transamination reaction.
The carbon skeletons resulting from the deaminated amino acids are used to form either glucose or fats, or they are converted to a metabolic intermediate that can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle.
The latter alternative, amino acid catabolism, is more likely to occur when glucose levels are low—for example, when a person is fasting or starving.
Transamination Transamination is an exchange of functional groups between any amino acid (except lysine, proline, and threonine) and an α-keto acid.
The amino group is usually Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1185  transferred to the keto carbon atom of pyruvate, oxaloacetate, or α-ketoglutarate, converting the α-keto acid to alanine, aspartate, or glutamate, respectively.
Transamination reactions are catalyzed by specific transaminases (also called aminotransferases), which require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme.
(For more information about coenzymes, see Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes",Section 18.9 "Enzyme Cofactors and Vitamins".)
Alanine and aspartate then undergo a second transamination reaction, transferring their amino groups to α-ketoglutarate and forming glutamate (Figure 20.19 "Two Transamination Reactions").
Note In an α-keto acid, the carbonyl or keto group is located on the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group of the acid.
(For more information about acid carboxyl groups, see Chapter 15 "Organic Acids and Bases and Some of Their Derivatives", Section 15.2 "Carboxylic Acids: Structures and Names".)
Figure 20.19 Two Transamination Reactions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1186  In both reactions, the final acceptor of the amino group is α-ketoglutarate, and the final product is glutamate.
Oxidative Deamination In the breakdown of amino acids for energy, the final acceptor of the α-amino group is α-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate.
Glutamate can then undergo oxidative deamination, in which it loses its amino group as an ammonium (NH +) 4 ion and is oxidized back to α-ketoglutarate (ready to accept another amino group): Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1187  This reaction occurs primarily in liver mitochondria.
Most of the NH + ion formed by 4 oxidative deamination of glutamate is converted to urea and excreted in the urine in a series of reactions known as the urea cycle.
The synthesis of glutamate occurs in animal cells by reversing the reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase.
For this reaction nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) acts as the reducing agent.
The synthesis of glutamate is significant because it is one of the few reactions in animals that can incorporate inorganic nitrogen (NH +) into an α-keto acid to form an amino acid.
The amino group can then be passed 4 on through transamination reactions, to produce other amino acids from the appropriate α-keto acids.
The Fate of the Carbon Skeleton Any amino acid can be converted into an intermediate of the citric acid cycle.
Once the amino group is removed, usually by transamination, the α-keto acid that remains is catabolized by a pathway unique to that acid and consisting of one or more reactions.
For example, phenylalanine undergoes a series of six reactions before it splits into Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1188  fumarate and acetoacetate.
Fumarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, while acetoacetate must be converted to acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and then to acetyl-CoA before it enters the citric acid cycle.
Those amino acids that can form any of the intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism can subsequently be converted to glucose via a metabolic pathway known as gluconeogenesis.
These amino acids are called glucogenic amino acids.
Amino acids that are converted to acetoacetyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA, which can be used for the synthesis of ketone bodies but not glucose, are called ketogenic amino acids.
Some amino acids fall into both categories.
Leucine and lysine are the only amino acids that are exclusively ketogenic.
Figure 20.20 "Fates of the Carbon Skeletons of Amino Acids"summarizes the ultimate fates of the carbon skeletons of the 20 amino acids.

Metabolism is the general term for all chemical reactions in living organisms.
The two types of metabolism are catabolism—those reactions in which complex molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) are broken down to simpler ones with the concomitant release of energy—and anabolism—those reactions that consume energy to build complex molecules.
Metabolism is studied by looking at individual metabolic pathways, which are a series of biochemical reactions in which a given reactant is converted to a desired end product.
The oxidation of fuel molecules (primarily carbohydrates and lipids), a process called respiration, is the source of energy used by cells.
Catabolic reactions release energy from food molecules and use some of that energy for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP); anabolic reactions use the energy in ATP to create new compounds.
Catabolism can be divided into three stages.
In stage I, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are broken down into their individual monomer units—simple sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids, respectively.
In stage II, these monomer units are broken down by specific metabolic pathways to form a common end product acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA).
In stage III, acetyl-CoA is completely oxidized to form carbon dioxide and water, and ATP is produced.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1193  The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth as α-amylase breaks glycosidic linkages in carbohydrate molecules.
Essentially no carbohydrate digestion occurs in the stomach, and food particles pass through to the small intestine, where α-amylase and intestinal enzymes convert complex carbohydrate molecules (starches) to monosaccharides.
The monosaccharides then pass through the lining of the small intestine and into the bloodstream for transport to all body cells.
Protein digestion begins in the stomach as pepsinogen in gastric juice is converted to pepsin, the enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds.
The partially digested protein then passes to the small intestine, where the remainder of protein digestion takes place through the action of several enzymes.
The resulting amino acids cross the intestinal wall into the blood and are carried to the liver.
Lipid digestion begins in the small intestine.
Bile salts emulsify the lipid molecules, and then lipases hydrolyze them to fatty acids and monoglycerides.
The hydrolysis products pass through the intestine and are repackaged for transport in the bloodstream.
In cells that are operating aerobically, acetyl-CoA produced in stage II of catabolism is oxidized to carbon dioxide.
The citric acid cycle describes this oxidation, which takes place with the formation of the coenzymes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH ).
The sequence of reactions 2 needed to oxidize these coenzymes and transfer the resulting electrons to oxygen is called the electron transport chain, or the respiratory chain.
The compounds responsible for this series of oxidation-reduction reactions include proteins known ascytochromes, Fe·S proteins, and other molecules that ultimately result in the reduction of molecular oxygen to water.
Every time a compound with two carbon atoms is oxidized in the citric acid cycle, a respiratory chain compound accepts the electrons lost in the oxidation (and so is reduced) and then passes them on to the next metabolite in the chain.
The energy released by the electron transport chain is used to transport hydrogen (H+) ions from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.
The flow of H+ back through ATP synthase leads to the synthesis and release of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions (P) in a process known i Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1194  as oxidative phosphorylation.
Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation are tightly coupled to each other.
The enzymes and intermediates of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation are located in organelles calledmitochondria.
The oxidation of carbohydrates is the source of over 50% of the energy used by cells.
Glucose is oxidized to two molecules of pyruvate through a series of reactions known as glycolysis.
Some of the energy released in these reactions is conserved by the formation of ATP from ADP.
Glycolysis can be divided into two phases: phase I consists of the first five reactions and requires energy to “prime” the glucose molecule for phase II, the last five reactions in which ATP is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation.
The pyruvate produced by glycolysis has several possible fates, depending on the organism and whether or not oxygen is present.
In animal cells, pyruvate can be further oxidized to acetyl-CoA and then to carbon dioxide (through the citric acid cycle) if oxygen supplies are sufficient.
When oxygen supplies are insufficient, pyruvate is reduced to lactate.
In yeast and other microorganisms, pyruvate is not converted to lactate in the absence of oxygen but instead is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
The amount of ATP formed by the oxidation of glucose depends on whether or not oxygen is present.
If oxygen is present, glucose is oxidized to carbon dioxide, and 36–38 ATP molecules are produced for each glucose molecule oxidized, using the combined pathways of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.
Thus, approximately 42% of the energy released by the complete oxidation of glucose is conserved by the synthesis of ATP.
In the absence of oxygen, only 2 molecules of ATP are formed for each molecule of glucose converted to lactate (2 molecules), and the amount of energy conserved is much less (2%).
Fatty acids, released by the degradation of triglycerides and other lipids, are converted to fatty acyl-CoA, transported into the mitochondria, and oxidized by repeated cycling through a sequence of four reactions known as β-oxidation.
In each round of β- oxidation, the fatty acyl-CoA is shortened by two carbon atoms as one molecule of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 1195  acetyl-CoA is formed.
The final round of β-oxidation, once the chain has been shortened to four carbon atoms, forms two molecules of acetyl-CoA.
β-oxidation also forms the reduced coenzymes FADH and NADH, whose reoxidation through the electron 2 transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation leads to the synthesis of ATP.
The efficiency of fatty acid oxidation in the human body is approximately 41%.
Amino acids from the breakdown of proteins can be catabolized to provide energy.
Amino acids whose carbon skeletons are converted to intermediates that can be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis are known as glucogenic amino acids.
Amino acids whose carbon skeletons are broken down to compounds used to form ketone bodies are known as ketogenic amino acids.
The first step in amino acid catabolism is separation of the amino group from the carbon skeleton.
In a transamination, the amino acid gives its NH to pyruvate, α- 2 ketoglutarate, or oxaloacetate.
The products of this reaction are a new amino acid and an α-keto acid containing the carbon skeleton of the original amino acid.
Pyruvate is transaminated to alanine, α-ketoglutarate to glutamate, and oxaloacetate to aspartate.
The amino groups used to form alanine and aspartate are ultimately transferred to α- ketoglutarate, forming glutamate.
The glutamate then undergoes oxidative deamination to yield α-ketoglutarate and ammonia.

The periodic table lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number (that is, the number of protons in the nucleus).
The periodic table is arguably the best tool in all of science; no other branch of science can summarize its fundamental constituents in such a concise and useful way.
Many of the physical and chemical properties of the elements are either known or understood based on their positions on the periodic table.
Periodic tables are available with a variety of chemical and physical properties listed in each element’s box.
What follows here is a relatively simple version.
The Internet is a great place to find periodic tables that contain additional information.
One item on most periodic tables is the atomic mass of each element.
For many applications, only one or two decimal places are necessary for the atomic mass.
However, some applications (especially nuclear chemistry; see http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch11) require more decimal places.
The atomic masses in http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch21_t01represent the number of decimal places recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the worldwide body that develops standards for chemistry.
The atomic masses of some elements are known very precisely, to a large number of decimal places.
The atomic masses of other elements, especially radioactive elements, are not known as precisely.
Some elements, such as lithium, can have varying atomic masses depending on how their isotopes are isolated.
The web offers many interactive periodic table resources.
