Microsoft® Office contains a variety of tools that help people accomplish many personal and professional objectives.
Microsoft Excel is perhaps the most versatile and widely used of all the Office applications.
No matter which career path you choose, you will likely need to use Excel to accomplish your professional objectives, some of which may occur daily.
This chapter provides an overview of the Excel application along with an orientation for accessing the commands and features of an Excel workbook.
Making Decisions with Excel Follow-along file: Not needed for this skill Taking a very simple view, Excel is a tool that allows you to enter quantitative data into an electronic spreadsheet to apply one or many mathematical computations.
These computations ultimately convert that quantitative data into information.
The information produced in Excel can be used to make decisions in both professional and personal contexts.
For example, employees can use Excel to determine how much inventory to buy for a clothing retailer, how much medication to administer to a patient, or how much Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 4 money to spend to stay within a budget.
With respect to personal decisions, you can use Excel to determine how much money you can spend on a house, how much you can spend on car lease payments, or how much you need to save to reach your retirement goals.
We will demonstrate how you can use Excel to make these decisions and many more throughout this text.
Figure 1.1 "Example of an Excel Worksheet with Embedded Chart" shows a completed Excel worksheet that will be constructed in this chapter.
The information shown in this worksheet is top-line sales data for a hypothetical merchandise retail company.
The worksheet data can help this retailer determine the number of salespeople needed for each month, how much inventory is needed to satisfy sales, and what types of products should be purchased.
Notice that the embedded chart makes it very easy to see which months have the highest unit sales.
Figure 1.1 Example of an Excel Worksheet with Embedded Chart Starting Excel Follow-along file: Not needed for this skill Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 5 The following steps will guide you in starting the Excel application.

A workbook is an Excel file that contains one or more worksheets (sometimes referred to as spreadsheets).
Excel will assign a file name to the workbook, such as Book1, Book2, Book3, and so on, depending on how many new workbooks are opened.
Figure 1.3 "Blank Workbook" shows a blank workbook after starting Excel.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 7 Figure 1.3 Blank Workbook Your workbook should already be maximized (or shown at full size) once Excel is started, as shown in Figure 1.3 "Blank Workbook".
However, if your screen looks like Figure 1.4 "Restored Worksheet" after starting Excel, you should click the Maximize button, as shown in the figure.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 8 Figure 1.4 Restored Worksheet Navigating Worksheets Follow-along file: Not needed for this skill Data are entered and managed in an Excel worksheet.
The worksheet contains several rectangles called cells for entering numeric and nonnumeric data.
Each cell in an Excel worksheet contains an address, which is defined by a column letter followed by a row number.
For example, the cell that is currently activated in Figure 1.4 "Restored Worksheet" is A1.
This would be referred to as cell location A1 or cell reference A1.
The following steps explain how you can navigate in an Excel worksheet: 1.
Place your mouse pointer over cell D5 and left click.
2.
Check to make sure column letter D and row number 5 are highlighted in orange, as shown in Figure 1.5 "Activating a Cell Location".
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 9 Figure 1.5 Activating a Cell Location 1.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 25 1.2 Entering, Editing, and Managing Data LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Understand how to enter data into a worksheet.
2.
Examine how to edit data in a worksheet.
3.
Examine how Auto Fill is used when entering data.
4.
Understand how to delete data from a worksheet and use the Undo command.
5.
Examine how to adjust column widths and row heights in a worksheet.
6.
Understand how to hide columns and rows in a worksheet.
7.
Examine how to insert columns and rows into a worksheet.
8.
Understand how to delete columns and rows from a worksheet.
9.
Learn how to move data to different locations in a worksheet.
In this section, we will begin the development of the workbook shown in Figure 1.1 "Example of an Excel Worksheet with Embedded Chart".
The skills covered in this section are typically used in the early stages of developing one or more worksheets in a workbook.
Entering Data Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (This is a blank workbook that was named in the previous section.
If you skipped the previous section, open a new workbook and save it with the file name “Excel Objective 1.0.”) We will begin building the workbook shown in Figure 1.1 "Example of an Excel Worksheet with Embedded Chart" by manually entering data into the worksheet.
There are other ways in which you can bring data into an Excel worksheet, such as importing data from a website or a Microsoft Access database.
However, we will demonstrate these other methods later.
The following steps explain how the column headings in Row 2 are typed into the worksheet: 1.
Activate cell location A2 on the worksheet.
2.
Type the word Month.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 26 3.
Press the RIGHT ARROW key.
This will enter the word into cell A2 and activate the next cell to the right.
4.
Type Unit Sales and press the RIGHT ARROW key.
5.
Repeat step 4 for the words Average Price and Sales Dollars.
Figure 1.17 "Entering Column Headings into a Worksheet" shows how your worksheet should appear after you have typed the column headings into Row 2.
Notice that the word Price in cell location C2 is not visible.
This is because the column is too narrow to fit the entry you typed.
We will examine formatting techniques to correct this problem in the next section.
Figure 1.17 Entering Column Headings into a Worksheet Integrity Check Column Headings It is critical to include column headings that accurately describe the data in each column of a worksheet.
In professional environments, you will likely be sharing Excel workbooks with coworkers.
Good column headings reduce the chance of someone misinterpreting the data contained in a worksheet, which could lead to costly errors depending on your career.
1.
Activate cell location B3.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 27 2.
Type the number 2670 and press the ENTER key.
After you press the ENTER key, cell B4 will be activated.
Using the ENTER key is an efficient way to enter data vertically down a column.
3.
Repeat step 7 by entering the following numbers in cells B4 through B14:2160, 515, 590, 1030, 2875, 2700, 900, 775, 1180, 1800, and 3560.
Why?
Avoid Formatting Symbols When Entering Numbers When typing numbers into an Excel worksheet, it is best to avoid adding any formatting symbols such as dollar signs and commas.
Although Excel allows you to add these symbols while typing numbers, it slows down the process of entering data.
It is more efficient to use Excel’s formatting features to add these symbols to numbers after you type them into a worksheet.
4.
Activate cell location C3.
5.
Type the number 9.99 and press the ENTER key.
6.
Repeat step 10 by entering the following numbers in cells C4 through C14:12.49, 14.99, 17.49, 14.99, 12.49, 9.99, 19.99, 19.99, 19.99, 17.49, and14.99.
7.
Activate cell location D3.
8.
Type the number 26685 and press the ENTER key.
9.
Repeat step 13 by entering the following numbers in cells D4 through D14:26937, 7701, 10269, 15405, 35916, 26937, 17958, 15708, 23562,31416, and 53370.
Integrity Check Data Entry It is very important to proofread your worksheet carefully, especially when you have entered numbers.
Transposing numbers when entering data manually into a worksheet is a common error.
For example, the number 563 could be transposed to 536.
Such errors can seriously compromise the integrity of your workbook.
Figure 1.18 "Completed Data Entry for Columns B, C, and D" shows how your worksheet should appear after entering the data.
Check your numbers carefully to make sure they are accurately entered into the worksheet.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 28 Figure 1.18 Completed Data Entry for Columns B, C, and D Editing Data Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.01 if you are starting with this skill.)
Data that has been entered in a cell can be changed by double clicking the cell location or using the Formula Bar.
You may have noticed that as you were typing data into a cell location, the data you Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 29 typed appeared in the Formula Bar.
The Formula Bar can be used for entering data into cells as well as for editing data that already exists in a cell.
The following steps provide an example of entering and then editing data that has been entered into a cell location: 1.
Activate cell A15 in the Sheet1 worksheet.
2.
Type the abbreviation Tot and press the ENTER key.
3.
Click cell A15.
4.
Move the mouse pointer up to the Formula Bar.
You will see the pointer turn into a cursor.
Move the cursor to the end of the abbreviation Tot and left click.

3.
Press the ENTER key.
Mouseless Command Editing Data in a Cell  Activate the cell that is to be edited and press the F2 key on your keyboard.
Auto Fill Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.02 if you are starting with this skill.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 31 The Auto Fill feature is a valuable tool when manually entering data into a worksheet.
This feature has many uses, but it is most beneficial when you are entering data in a defined sequence, such as the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on, or nonnumeric data such as the days of the week or months of the year.
The following steps demonstrate how Auto Fill can be used to enter the months of the year in Column A: 1.
Activate cell A3 in the Sheet1 worksheet.
2.
Type the word January and press the ENTER key.
3.
Activate cell A3 again.
4.
Move the mouse pointer to the lower right corner of cell A3.
You will see a small square in this corner of the cell; this is called the Fill Handle (seeFigure 1.20 "Fill Handle").
When the mouse pointer gets close to the Fill Handle, the white block plus sign will turn into a black plus sign.
Figure 1.20 Fill Handle 1.
Left click and drag the Fill Handle to cell A14.
Notice that the Auto Fill tip box indicates what month will be placed into each cell (see Figure 1.21 "Using Auto Fill to Enter the Months of the Year").
Release the left mouse button when the tip box reads “December.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 32 Figure 1.21 Using Auto Fill to Enter the Months of the Year Once you release the left mouse button, all twelve months of the year should appear in the cell range A3:A14, as shown in Figure 1.22 "Auto Fill Options Button".
You will also see the Auto Fill Options button.
By clicking this button, you have several options for inserting data into a group of cells.

Deleting Data and the Undo Command Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.03 if you are starting with this skill.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 34 There are several methods for removing data from a worksheet, a few of which are demonstrated here.
With each method, you use the Undo command.
This is a helpful command in the event you mistakenly remove data from your worksheet.
The following steps demonstrate how you can delete data from a cell or range of cells: 1.
Activate cell C2 by placing the mouse pointer over the cell and clicking the left mouse button.
2.
Press the DELETE key on your keyboard.
This removes the contents of the cell.
3.

Figure 1.24 Clear Command Drop-Down Menu Adjusting Columns and Rows Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.03 if you are starting with this skill.)
In Figure 1.22 "Auto Fill Options Button", there are a few entries that appear cut off.
For example, the last letter of the word September cannot be seen in cell A11.
This is because the column is too narrow for this word.
The columns and rows on an Excel worksheet can be adjusted to accommodate the data that is being entered into a cell.
The following steps explain how to adjust the column widths and row heights in a worksheet: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 37 1.
Bring the mouse pointer between Column A and Column B in the Sheet1 worksheet, as shown in Figure 1.25 "Adjusting Column Widths".
You will see the white block plus sign turn into double arrows.
2.
Left click and drag the column to the right so the entire word September in cell A11 can be seen.
As you drag the column, you will see the column width tip box.
This box displays the number of characters that will fit into the column using the Calibri 11-point font.
3.
Release the left mouse button.
Figure 1.25 Adjusting Column Widths Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 38 You may find that using the click-and-drag method is inefficient if you need to set a specific character width for one or more columns.
Steps 4 through 7 illustrate a second method for adjusting column widths when using a specific number of characters: 4.
Activate any cell location in Column A by moving the mouse pointer over a cell location and clicking the left mouse button.
You can highlight cell locations in multiple columns if you are setting the same character width for more than one column.

For example, if you are moving a column of data, make sure the column heading is included.
Also, make sure all values are highlighted in the column before moving it.
Deleting Columns and Rows Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.05 if you are starting with this skill.)
You may need to delete entire columns or rows of data from a worksheet.
This need may arise if you need to remove either blank columns or rows from a worksheet or columns and rows that contain data.
The methods for removing cell contents were covered earlier and can be used to delete unwanted data.

The skills introduced in this section will give you powerful tools for analyzing the data that we have been working with in this workbook and will highlight how Excel is used to make key decisions in virtually any career.
Formatting Data and Cells Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.04 if you are starting with this skill.)
Enhancing the visual appearance of a worksheet is a critical step in creating a valuable tool for you or your coworkers when making key decisions.
The following steps demonstrate several fundamental formatting skills that will be applied to the workbook that we are developing for this chapter.
Several of these formatting skills are identical to ones that you may have already used in other Microsoft applications such as Microsoft® Word® or Microsoft® PowerPoint®.
1.

Notice that there is a drop-down arrow next to the Underline button.
This is for selecting a double underline format, which is common in careers that deal with accounting or budgeting activities.
Mouseless Command Italics Format  Hold the CTRL key while pressing the letter I on your keyboard.
Mouseless Command Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 55 Underline Format  Hold the CTRL key while pressing the letter U on your keyboard.
Why?
Format Column Headings and Totals Applying formatting enhancements to the column headings and column totals in a worksheet is a very important technique, especially if you are sharing a workbook with other people.
These formatting techniques allow users of the worksheet to clearly see the column headings that define the data.
In addition, the column totals usually contain the most important data on a worksheet with respect to making decisions, and formatting techniques allow users to quickly see this information.
7.
Highlight the range B3:B14 by placing the mouse pointer over cell B3 and left clicking and dragging down to cell B14.
8.
Click the Comma Style button in the Number group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.37 "Number Group of Commands").
Figure 1.37 Number Group of Commands 9.
Click the Decrease Decimal button in the Number group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.37 "Number Group of Commands").
10.
The numbers will also be reduced to zero decimal places.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 56 11.
Highlight the range C3:C14 by placing the mouse pointer over cell C3 and left clicking and dragging down to cell C14.
12.
Click the Accounting Number Format button in the Number group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.37 "Number Group of Commands").

This format is common when working with pricing data.
13.
Highlight the range D3:D14 by placing the mouse pointer over cell D3 and left clicking and dragging down to cell D14.
14.
Again, this will add the US currency symbol to the values as well as two decimal places.
15.
Click the Decrease Decimal button in the Number group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
16.
This will add the US currency symbol to the values and reduce the decimal places to zero.
17.
Highlight the range A1:D1 by placing the mouse pointer over cell A1 and left clicking and dragging over to cell D1.
18.
Click the down arrow next to the Fill Color button in the Font group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.38 "Fill Color Palette").
Figure 1.38 Fill Color Palette Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 57 19.
Click the Aqua, Accent 5, Darker 25% color from the palette (see Figure 1.38 "Fill Color Palette").
Notice that as you move the mouse pointer over the color palette, you will see a preview of how the color will appear in the highlighted cells.
20.
Click the down arrow next to the Font Color button in the Font group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.36 "Font Group of Commands").

24.
Click the drop-down arrow on the right side of the Font button in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.36 "Font Group of Commands").
25.
Notice that as you move the mouse pointer over the font style options, you can see the font change in the highlighted cells.
26.
Expand the row width of Column D to 10 characters.
Why?
Pound Signs (####) Appear in Columns When a column is too narrow for a long number, Excel will automatically convert the number to a series of pound signs (####).
In the case of words or text data, Excel will only show the characters that fit in the column.
However, this is not the case with numeric data because it can give the appearance of a number that is much smaller than what is actually in the cell.
To remove the pound signs, increase the width of the column.
Figure 1.39 "Formatting Techniques Applied" shows how the Sheet1 worksheet should appear after the formatting techniques are applied.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 58 Figure 1.39 Formatting Techniques Applied Data Alignment (Wrap Text, Merge Cells, and Center) Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.06 if you are starting with this skill.)
The skills presented in this segment show how data are aligned within cell locations.
For example, text and numbers can be centered in a cell location, left justified, right justified, and so on.
In some cases you may want to stack multiword text entries vertically in a cell instead of expanding the width of a column.
This is referred to as wrapping text.
These skills are demonstrated in the following steps: 1.
Highlight the range B2:D2 by placing the mouse pointer over cell B2 and left clicking and dragging over to cell D2.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 59 2.
Click the Center button in the Alignment group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.40 "Alignment Group in Home Tab").
This will center the column headings in each cell location.
Figure 1.40 Alignment Group in Home Tab 3.
Click the Wrap Text button in the Alignment group (see Figure 1.40 "Alignment Group in Home Tab").
The height of Row 2 automatically expands, and the words that were cut off because the columns were too narrow are now stacked vertically (see Figure 1.42 "Sheet1 with Data Alignment Features Added").
Mouseless Command Wrap Text  Press the ALT key and then the letters H and W one at a time.
Why?
Wrap Text Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 60 The benefit of using the Wrap Text command is that it significantly reduces the need to expand the column width to accommodate multiword column headings.
The problem with increasing the column width is that you may reduce the amount of data that can fit on a piece of paper or one screen.
This makes it cumbersome to analyze the data in the worksheet and could increase the time it takes to make a decision.
4.
Highlight the range A1:D1 by placing the mouse pointer over cell A1 and left clicking and dragging over to cell D1.
5.
Click the down arrow on the right side of the Merge & Center button in the Alignment group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
6.
Left click the Merge & Center option (see Figure 1.41 "Merge Cell Drop-Down Menu").
This will create one large cell location running across the top of the data set.
Mouseless Commands Merge Commands  Merge & Center: Press the ALT key and then the letters H, M, and C one at a time.
 Merge Cells: Press the ALT key and then the letters H, M, and M one at a time.
 Unmerge Cells: Press the ALT key and then the letters H, M, and U one at a time.
Figure 1.41 Merge Cell Drop-Down Menu Why?
Merge & Center Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 61 One of the most common reasons the Merge & Center command is used is to center the title of a worksheet directly above the columns of data.
Once the cells above the column headings are merged, a title can be centered above the columns of data.
It is very difficult to center the title over the columns of data if the cells are not merged.
Figure 1.42 "Sheet1 with Data Alignment Features Added" shows the Sheet1 worksheet with the data alignment commands applied.
The reason for merging the cells in the range A1:D1 will become apparent in the next segment.

Borders (Adding Lines to a Worksheet) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 64 Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.08 if you are starting with this skill.)
In Excel, adding custom lines to a worksheet is known as adding borders.
Borders are different from the grid lines that appear on a worksheet and that define the perimeter of the cell locations.
The Borders command lets you add a variety of line styles to a worksheet that can make reading the worksheet much easier.
The following steps illustrate methods for adding preset borders and custom borders to a worksheet: 1.
Note that when you click on cell A1, cells B1:D1 will also activate since they are merged.
2.
Click the down arrow to the right of the Borders button in the Font group of commands in the Home page of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.44 "Borders Drop-Down Menu").

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 69 Inserting a Column Chart Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.10 if you are starting with this skill.)
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, Excel serves as a critical tool for making decisions in both personal and professional contexts.
Charts are a powerful tool in Excel that allow you to graphically display the data in a worksheet.
Graphical displays allow the reader to immediately identify key trends and behaviors in the data that is being analyzed.
For the workbook that we are using for this chapter, understanding the trends in monthly sales data is critical for making decisions such as how many staff members to assign to the store for each month as well as supplying the store with enough inventory to accommodate expected sales.
To assist the reader in analyzing this data, a column chart will be created to graphically display the data.
It is important for you to plan which type of chart will best display the data so your readers can quickly see key trends.
More details on creating charts and on chart types will be presented in a later chapter.
The following steps are an introduction to creating the column chart required for this chapter’s objective: 1.
Highlight the range A2:B14.
2.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Column button (see Figure 1.49 "Column Chart Drop-Down Menu").
This will open the column chart drop-down menu of options.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 70 Figure 1.49 Column Chart Drop-Down Menu 4.
Select the Clustered Column option from the list of column chart options (see Figure 1.49 "Column Chart Drop-Down Menu").
This will create an embedded chart in the Sheet1 worksheet (see Figure 1.50 "Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1").
Figure 1.50 "Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1" shows the column chart that is created once a selection is made from the column chart drop-down menu.
Notice that there are three new tabs added to the Ribbon.
These tabs contain features for enhancing the appearance and construction of Excel charts.
These commands will be covered in more detail in a later chapter.
For now, you will see that Excel places the chart over the data in the worksheet.
The following steps explain how to move and resize the chart: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 71 Figure 1.50 Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1 5.
The block white plus sign will become black cross arrows (see Figure 1.50 "Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1").
6.
Left click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is placed in the middle of cell F1 (see Figure 1.51 "Moving an Embedded Chart").
Figure 1.51 Moving an Embedded Chart 7.
Place the mouse pointer over the top center sizing handle (see Figure 1.50 "Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1").
You will see the mouse pointer change from a white block plus sign to a vertical double Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 72 arrow.
Make sure the mouse pointer is not in the cross arrow mode as shown in Figure 1.50 "Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1" as this will move the chart instead of resizing it.
8.
While holding down the ALT key on your keyboard, left click and drag the mouse pointer slightly up.
The chart will automatically adjust up to the top of Row 1.
9.
Place the mouse pointer over the left center sizing handle.
10.
While holding down the ALT key on your keyboard, left click and drag the mouse slightly toward the left.
The chart will automatically adjust to the left side of Column F. 11.
Place the mouse pointer over the lower center sizing handle.
12.
While holding down the ALT key on your keyboard, left click and drag the mouse slightly down.
The chart will automatically adjust to the bottom of Row 14.
13.
Place the mouse pointer over the right center sizing handle.
14.
While holding down the ALT key on your keyboard, left click and drag the mouse slightly to the right.
The chart will automatically adjust to the right side of Column M. Why?
There Are No Sizing Handles on a Chart If you do not see the dots or sizing handles around the perimeter of a chart, it could be that the chart is not activated.
To activate a chart, left click anywhere on the chart.
Figure 1.52 "Embedded Chart Moved and Resized" shows the column chart moved and resized.
Notice that the sizing handles are not visible around the perimeter of the chart.
This is because the chart is not activated.
Once you click anywhere on the worksheet outside the chart area, the chart is automatically deactivated.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 73 Figure 1.52 Embedded Chart Moved and Resized Why?
Use the ALT Key When Resizing a Chart Using the ALT key while resizing an embedded chart locks the perimeter of the chart to the columns and rows of the worksheet.
This gives you the ability to adjust the chart to precise sizes as you adjust the width and height of the worksheet rows and columns.
As shown in Figure 1.50 "Embedded Column Chart in Sheet1", when a chart is created, three tabs are added to the Ribbon.
The following steps explain how to use a few of the formatting and design features in these tabs: 15.
Check to make sure the column chart in Sheet1 is activated.
To activate the chart, left click anywhere on the chart.
16.
Click the Design tab under the Chart Tools set of tabs on the Ribbon.
17.
Click the down arrow on the right side of the Chart Styles section (see Figure 1.53 "Chart Styles in the Design Tab").
Figure 1.53 Chart Styles in the Design Tab Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 74 18.
Click Style 44 in the Chart Styles section.
This style has a black background with red columns (see Figure 1.53 "Chart Styles in the Design Tab").
19.
Click the Format tab under the Chart Tools set of tabs on the Ribbon.
20.
Click the down arrow on the right side of the WordArt Styles section (seeFigure 1.54 "WordArt Styles in the Format Tab").
Figure 1.54 WordArt Styles in the Format Tab Click the Blue, Accent 1, Inner Shadow option (see Figure 1.54 "WordArt Styles in the Format Tab").
Notice that as you move the mouse pointer over the WordArt Styles options, the format of the chart title as well as the X and Y axis titles changes.
Figure 1.55 "Formatting Features Applied to the Column Chart" shows the embedded column chart with the formatting features applied.
This chart is very effective in displaying the Unit Sales trends for this company.
You can see very quickly that the tallest bar in the chart is the month of December, followed by the months of June, July, January, and February.

Sorting Data (One Level) Follow-along file: Excel Objective 1.0 (Use file Excel Objective 1.12 if you are starting with this skill.)
As mentioned earlier in this section, a chart is a tool that enables worksheet readers to analyze data quickly to spot key trends or patterns.
Another powerful tool that provides similar benefits is the Sort command.
This feature ranks the rows of data in a worksheet based on designated criteria.
The following steps demonstrate how the Sort command is used to rank the data in the Sheet2 worksheet: 1.
In the Sheet2 worksheet, highlight the range A2:D14.
2.
Click the Data tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Sort button in the Sort & Filter group of commands.
This will open the Sort dialog box (see Figure 1.57 "Sort & Filter Group of Commands").
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 78 Figure 1.57 Sort & Filter Group of Commands 4.

8.
Click the OK button at the bottom of the Sort dialog box.
The data in the range A2:D14 will now be sorted in descending order based on the values in the Unit Sales column.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 79 Integrity Check Sorting Data Carefully check the highlighted range of the data you are sorting.
It is critical that all columns in a contiguous range of data are highlighted before sorting.
If you do not sort all the columns in a data set, the data could become corrupted in such a way that it may not be corrected.
If Excel detects that you are trying to sort only part of a contiguous range of data, it will give you a warning dialog box.
Figure 1.59 "Data Sorted Based on Unit Sales" shows the data in the Sheet2 worksheet sorted based on the values in the Unit Sales column.
Similar to the chart, the Sort command makes it easy to identify the months of the year with the highest unit sales.

KEY TAKEAWAYS  Formatting skills are critical for creating worksheets that are easy to read and have a professional appearance.
 A series of pound signs (####) in a cell location indicates that the column is too narrow to display the number entered.
 Using the Wrap Text command allows you to stack multiword column headings vertically in a cell location, reducing the need to expand column widths.
 Use the Merge & Center command to center the title of a worksheet directly over the columns that contain data.
 Adding borders or lines will make your worksheet easier to read and helps to separate the data in each column and row.
 Effective charts enable readers to immediately identify key trends in the data you are displaying.
 Check to make sure all the data in a contiguous range of cells is highlighted before using the Sort command.
Highlighting and sorting only part of a contiguous data set could corrupt your data in such a way that its integrity may not be restored.
 You cannot use the Undo command to bring back a worksheet that has been deleted.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 102 Chapter 2 Mathematical Computations Perhaps the most valuable feature of Excel is its ability to produce mathematical outputs using the data in a workbook.
This chapter reviews several mathematical outputs that you can produce in Excel through the construction of formulas and functions.
The chapter begins with the construction of formulas for basic and complex mathematical computations.
The second section reviews statistical functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX, which can be applied to a range of cells.
The last section of the chapter addresses functions used to calculate mortgage and lease payments as well as the valuation of investments.
This chapter also shows how you can use data from multiple worksheets to construct formulas and functions.
These skills will be demonstrated in the context of a personal cash budget, which is a vital tool for managing your money for long-term financial security.
The personal budget objective will also provide you with several opportunities to demonstrate Excel’s what-if scenario capabilities, which highlight how formulas and functions automatically produce new outputs when one or more inputs are changed.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 103 2.1 Formulas LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Learn how to create basic formulas.
2.
Understand relative referencing when copying and pasting formulas.
3.
Work with complex formulas by controlling the order of mathematical operations.
4.
Understand formula auditing tools.
This section reviews the fundamental skills for entering formulas into an Excel worksheet.
The objective used for this chapter is the construction of a personal cash budget.
Most financial advisors recommend that all households construct and maintain a personal budget to achieve and maintain strong financial health.
Organizing and maintaining a personal budget is a skill you can practice at any point in your life.
Whether you are managing your expenses during college or maintaining the finances of a family of four, a personal budget can be a vital tool when making financial decisions.
Excel can make managing your money a fun and rewarding exercise.
Figure 2.1 "Completed Personal Cash Budget Workbook" shows the completed workbook that will be demonstrated in this chapter.
Notice that this workbook contains four worksheets.
The first worksheet, Budget Summary, contains formulas that utilize or reference the data in the other three worksheets.
As a result, the Budget Summary worksheet serves as an overview of the data that was entered and calculated in the other three worksheets of the workbook.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 104 Figure 2.1 Completed Personal Cash Budget Workbook Creating a Basic Formula Follow-along file: Excel Objective 2.00 Formulas are used to calculate a variety of mathematical outputs in Excel and can be used to create virtually any custom calculation required for your objective.
Furthermore, when constructing a formula in Excel, you use cell locations that, when added to a formula, become cell references.
This means that Excel uses, or references, the number entered into the cell location when calculating a mathematical output.
As a result, when the numbers in the cell references are changed, Excel automatically produces a new output.
This is what gives Excel the ability to create a variety of what-if scenarios, which will be explained later in the chapter.
To demonstrate the construction of a basic formula, we will begin working on the Budget Detail worksheet in the Personal Budget workbook, which is shown in Figure 2.2 "Budget Detail Worksheet".
To complete this worksheet, we will add several formulas and functions.
Table 2.1 "Spend Category Definitions" provides definitions for each of the spend categories listed in the range A3:A11.
When you develop a personal budget, these categories are defined on the basis of how you spend your money.
It is likely that every person could have different categories or define the same categories Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 105 differently.
Therefore, it is important to review the definitions in Table 2.1 "Spend Category Definitions" to understand how we are defining these categories before proceeding.
Figure 2.2 Budget Detail Worksheet Table 2.1 Spend Category Definitions Category Definition Household Utilities Money spent on electricity, heat, and water and on cable, phone, and Internet access Food Money spent on groceries, toiletries, and related items Gasoline Money spent on fuel for automobiles Clothes Money spent on clothes, shoes, and accessories Insurance Money spent on homeowner’s or automobile insurance Money spent on school and property taxes (this example of the personal budget assumes Taxes that we own property).
Money spent on entertainment, including dining out, movie and theater tickets, parties, Entertainment and so on Vacation Money spent on vacations Includes any other spending categories, such as textbooks, software, journals, school or Miscellaneous work supplies, and so on Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 106 The first formula that we will add to the Budget Detail worksheet will calculate the Monthly Spend values.
The formula will be constructed so that it takes the values in the Annual Spend column and divides them by 12.
This will show how much money will be spent per month for each of the categories listed in Column A.
The following explains how this formula is created: 1.
Click the Budget Detail worksheet tab to open the worksheet.
2.
Click cell C3.
3.
Type an equal sign (=).
When the first character entered into a cell location is an equal sign, it signals Excel to perform a calculation or produce a logical output.
4.
Type D3.
This adds D3 to the formula, which is now a cell reference.
Excel will use whatever value is entered into cell D3 to produce an output.
5.
Type the slash symbol (/).
This is the symbol for division in Excel.
As shown in Table 2.2 "Excel Mathematical Operators", the mathematical operators in Excel are slightly different from those found on a typical calculator.
6.
Type the number 12.
This divides the value in cell D3 by 12.
In this formula, a number, or constant, is used instead of a cell reference because it will not change.
In other words, there will always be 12 months in a year.
7.
Press the ENTER key.
Table 2.2 Excel Mathematical Operators Symbol Operation + Addition − Subtraction / Division * Multiplication ^ Power/Exponent Why?
Use Cell References Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 107 Cell references enable Excel to dynamically produce new outputs when one or more inputs in the referenced cells are changed.
Cell references also allow you to trace how outputs are being calculated in a formula.
As a result, you should never use a calculator to determine a mathematical output and type it into the cell location of a worksheet.
Doing so eliminates Excel’s cell-referencing benefits as well as your ability to trace a formula to determine how outputs are being produced.
Figure 2.3 "Adding a Formula to a Worksheet" shows how the formula appears in cell C3 before you press the ENTER key.
Figure 2.4 "Formula Output for Monthly Spend" shows the output of the formula after you press the ENTER key.
The monthly spend for Household Utilities is $250 because the formula is taking the Annual Spend in cell D3 and dividing it by 12.
If the value in cell D3 is changed, the formula automatically produces a new output.
We are calculating the spend per month for each category because people often get paid and are billed for these items on a monthly basis.
This formula allows you to compare your monthly income to your monthly bills to determine whether you have enough income to pay these expenses.
Figure 2.3 Adding a Formula to a Worksheet Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 108 Figure 2.4 Formula Output for Monthly Spend Why?
Use Universal Constants If you are using constants, or numerical values, in an Excel formula, they should be universal constants that do not change, such as the number of days in a week, weeks in a year, and so on.
Do not type the values that exist in cell locations into an Excel formula.
This will eliminate Excel’s cell- referencing benefits, which means if the value in the cell location you are using in a formula is changed, Excel will not be able to produce a new output.
Relative References (Copying and Pasting Formulas) Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.01 if starting here.)
Once a formula is typed into a worksheet, it can be copied and pasted to other cell locations.
For example, Figure 2.4 "Formula Output for Monthly Spend" shows the output of the formula that was entered into cell C3.
However, this calculation needs to be performed for the rest of the cell locations in Column C. Since we used the D3 cell reference in the formula, Excel automatically adjusts that cell reference when the formula is copied and pasted into the rest of the cell locations in the column.
This is called relative referencing and is demonstrated as follows: 1.
Click cell C3.
2.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 109 3.
Highlight the range C4:C11.
4.
Click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
5.
Double click cell C6.
Notice that the cell reference in the formula is automatically changed to D6.
6.
Press the ENTER key.
Figure 2.5 "Relative Reference Example" shows the outputs added to the rest of the cell locations in the Monthly Spend column.
For each row, the formula takes the value in the Annual Spend column and divides it by 12.
You will also see that cell D6 has been double clicked to show the formula.
Notice that Excel automatically changed the original cell reference of D3 to D6.
This is the result of relative referencing, which means Excel automatically adjusts a cell reference relative to its original location when it is pasted into new cell locations.
In this example, the formula was pasted into eight cell locations below the original cell location.
As a result, Excel increased the row number of the original cell reference by a value of one for each row it was pasted into.
Figure 2.5 Relative Reference Example Why?
Use Relative Referencing Relative referencing is a convenient feature in Excel.
When you use cell references in a formula, Excel automatically adjusts the cell references when the formula is pasted into new cell locations.
If this feature Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 110 were not available, you would have to manually retype the formula when you want the same calculation applied to other cell locations in a column or row.
Creating Complex Formulas (Controlling the Order of Operations) Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.02 if starting here.)
The next formula to be added to the Personal Budget workbook is the percent change over last year.
This formula determines the difference between the values in the LY (Last Year) Spend column and shows the difference in terms of a percentage.
This requires that the order of mathematical operations be controlled to get an accurate result.
Table 2.3 "Standard Order of Mathematical Operations" shows the standard order of operations for a typical formula.
To change the order of operations shown in the table, we use parentheses to process certain mathematical calculations first.
This formula is added to the worksheet as follows: 1.
Click cell F3 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Type an open parenthesis (().
4.
Click cell D3.
This will add a cell reference to cell D3 to the formula.
When building formulas, you can click cell locations instead of typing them.
5.
Type a minus sign (−).
6.
Click cell E3 to add this cell reference to the formula.
7.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
8.
Type the slash (/) symbol for division.
9.
Click cell E3.
This completes the formula that will calculate the percent change of last year’s actual spent dollars vs. this year’s budgeted spend dollars (see Figure 2.6 "Adding the Percent Change Formula").
10.
Press the ENTER key.
11.
Click cell F3 to activate it.
12.
Place the mouse pointer over the Auto Fill Handle.
13.
When the mouse pointer turns from a white block plus sign to a black plus sign, click and drag down to cell F11.
This pastes the formula into the range F4:F11.

Override Standard Order: Any mathematical computations placed in parentheses are performed first and override the standard order of operations.
If there are layers of parentheses used in a formula, ( ) Excel computes the innermost parentheses first and the outermost parentheses last.
Figure 2.6 "Adding the Percent Change Formula" shows the formula that was added to the Budget Detail worksheet to calculate the percent change in spending.
The parentheses were added to this formula to control the order of operations.
Any mathematical computations placed in parentheses are executed first before the standard order of mathematical operations (see Table 2.3 "Standard Order of Mathematical Operations").
In this case, if parentheses were not used, Excel would produce an erroneous result for this worksheet.
Figure 2.6 Adding the Percent Change Formula Figure 2.7 "Removing the Parentheses from the Percent Change Formula" shows the result of the percent change formula if the parentheses are removed.
The formula produces a result of a 299900% increase.
Since there is no change between the LY spend and the budget Annual Spend, the result should be 0%.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 112 However, without the parentheses, Excel is following the standard order of operations.
This means the value in cell E3 will be divided by E3 first (3,000/3,000), which is 1.
Then, the value of 1 will be subtracted from the value in cell D3 (3,000−1), which is 2,999.
Since cell F3 is formatted as a percentage, Excel expresses the output as an increase of 299900%.
Figure 2.7 Removing the Parentheses from the Percent Change Formula Integrity Check Does the Output of Your Formula Make Sense?
It is important to note that the accuracy of the output produced by a formula depends on how it is constructed.
Therefore, always check the result of your formula to see whether it makes sense with data in your worksheet.
As shown in Figure 2.7 "Removing the Parentheses from the Percent Change Formula", a poorly constructed formula can give you an inaccurate result.
In other words, you can see that there is no change between the Annual Spend and LY Spend for Household Utilities.
Therefore, the result of the formula should be 0%.
However, since the parentheses were removed in this case, the formula is clearly producing an erroneous result.

Excel provides a few tools that you can use to review the formulas entered into a worksheet.
For example, instead of showing the outputs for the formulas used in a worksheet, you can have Excel show the formula as it was entered in the cell locations.
This is demonstrated as follows: 1.
With the Budget Detail worksheet open, click the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
2.
Click the Show Formulas button in the Formula Auditing group of commands.
This displays the formulas in the worksheet instead of showing the mathematical outputs.
3.
Click the Show Formulas button again.
The worksheet returns to showing the output of the formulas.
Figure 2.8 "Show Formulas Command" shows the Budget Detail worksheet after activating the Show Values command in the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
As shown in the figure, this command allows you to view and check all the formulas in a worksheet without having to click each cell individually.
After activating this command, the column widths in your worksheet increase significantly.
The column widths were adjusted for the worksheet shown inFigure 2.8 "Show Formulas Command" so all columns can be seen.
The column widths return to their previous width when the Show Formulas command is deactivated.

Mouseless Commands Show Formulas  Hold down the CTRL key while pressing the accent symbol (`).
Two other tools in the Formula Auditing group of commands are the Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents commands.
These commands are used to trace the cell references used in a formula.
The Trace Dependents command shows where any given cell is referenced in a formula.
The Trace Precedents command shows what cells have been referenced in a formula that exists in an activated cell.
The following is a demonstration of these commands: 1.
Click cell D3 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Trace Dependents button in the Formula Auditing group of commands in the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
A double blue arrow appears, pointing to cell locations C3 and F3 (see Figure 2.9 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 115 "Trace Dependents Example").
This indicates that cell D3 is referenced in formulas that are entered in cells C3 and F3.
3.

KEY TAKEAWAYS  Mathematical computations are conducted through formulas and functions.
 An equal sign (=) precedes all formulas and functions.
 Formulas and functions must be created with cell references to conduct what-if scenarios where mathematical outputs are recalculated when one or more inputs are changed.
 Mathematical operators on a typical calculator are different from those used in Excel.
Table 2.2 "Excel Mathematical Operators" lists Excel mathematical operators.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 117  When using numerical values in formulas and functions, only use universal constants that do not change, such as days in a week, months in a year, and so on.
 Relative referencing automatically adjusts the cell references in formulas and functions when they are pasted into new locations on a worksheet.
This eliminates the need to retype formulas and functions when they are needed in multiple rows or columns on a worksheet.
 Parentheses must be used to control the order of operations when necessary for complex formulas.
 Formula auditing tools such as Trace Dependents, Trace Precedents, and Show Formulas should be used to check the integrity of formulas that have been entered into a worksheet.

In addition to formulas, another way to conduct mathematical computations in Excel is through functions.
Statistical functions apply a mathematical process to a group of cells in a worksheet.
For example, the SUM function is used to add the values contained in a range of cells.
A list of commonly used statistical functions is shown in Table 2.4 "Commonly Used Statistical Functions".
Functions are more efficient than formulas when you are applying a mathematical process to a group of cells.
If you use a formula to add the values in a range of cells, you would have to add each cell location to the formula one at a time.
This can be very time-consuming if you have to add the values in a few hundred cell locations.
However, when you use a function, you can highlight all the cells that contain values you wish to sum in just one step.
This section demonstrates a variety of statistical functions that we will add to the Personal Budget workbook.
In addition to demonstrating functions, this section also reviews percent of total calculations and the use of absolute references.
Table 2.4 Commonly Used Statistical Functions Function Output ABS The absolute value of a number AVERAGE The average or arithmetic mean for a group of numbers COUNT The number of cell locations in a range that contain a numeric character COUNTA The number of cell locations in a range that contain a text or numeric character MAX The highest numeric value in a group of numbers Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 120 Function Output The middle number in a group of numbers (half the numbers in the group are higher than the MEDIAN median and half the numbers in the group are lower than the median) MIN The lowest numeric value in a group of numbers MODE The number that appears most frequently in a group of numbers PRODUCT The result of multiplying all the values in a range of cell locations SQRT The positive square root of a number STDEV.S The standard deviation for a group of numbers based on a sample SUM The total of all numeric values in a group The SUM Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.03 if starting here.)
The SUM function is used when you need to calculate totals for a range of cells or a group of selected cells on a worksheet.
With regard to the Budget Detailworksheet, we will use the SUM function to calculate the totals in row 12.
It is important to note that there are several methods for adding a function to a worksheet, which will be demonstrated throughout the remainder of this chapter.
The following illustrates how a function can be added to a worksheet by typing it into a cell location: 1.
Click the Budget Detail worksheet tab to open the worksheet.
2.
Click cell C12.
3.
Type an equal sign (=).
4.
Type the function name SUM.
5.
Type an open parenthesis (().
6.
Click cell C3 and drag down to cell C11.
This places the range C3:C11 into the function.
7.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
8.
Press the ENTER key.
The function calculates the total for the Monthly Spend column, which is $1,496.
Figure 2.11 "Adding the SUM Function to the Budget Detail Worksheet" shows the appearance of the SUM function added to the Budget Detail worksheet before pressing the ENTER key.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 121 Figure 2.11 Adding the SUM Function to the Budget Detail Worksheet As shown in Figure 2.11 "Adding the SUM Function to the Budget Detail Worksheet", the SUM function was added to cell C12.
However, this function is also needed to calculate the totals in the Annual Spend and LY Spend columns.
The function can be copied and pasted into these cell locations because of relative referencing.
Relative referencing serves the same purpose for functions as it does for formulas.
The following demonstrates how the total row is completed: 1.
Click cell C12 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Highlight cells D12 and E12.
4.
Click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
This pastes the SUM function into cells D12 and E12 and calculates the totals for these columns.
5.
Click cell F11.
6.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
7.
Click cell F12, then click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Since we now have totals in row 12, we can paste the percent change formula into this row.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 122 Figure 2.12 "Results of the SUM Function in the Budget Detail Worksheet" shows the output of the SUM function that was added to cells C12, D12, and E12.
In addition, the percent change formula was copied and pasted into cell F12.
Notice that this version of the budget is planning a 1.7% decrease in spending compared to last year.
Figure 2.12 Results of the SUM Function in the Budget Detail Worksheet Integrity Check Cell Ranges in Statistical Functions When you intend to use a statistical function on a range of cells in a worksheet, make sure there are two cell locations separated by a colon and not a comma.
If you enter two cell locations separated by a comma, the function will produce an output but it will be applied to only two cell locations instead of a range of cells.
For example, the SUM function shown in Figure 2.13 "SUM Function Adding Two Cell Locations" will add only the values in cells C3 and C11, not the range C3:C11.
Figure 2.13 SUM Function Adding Two Cell Locations Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 123  Absolute References (Calculating Percent of Totals) Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.04 if starting here.)
Since totals were added to row 12 of the Budget Detail worksheet, a percent of total calculation can be added to Column B beginning in cell B3.
The percent of total calculation shows the percentage for each value in the Annual Spend column with respect to the total in cell D12.
However, after the formula is created, it will be necessary to turn off Excel’s relative referencing feature before copying and pasting the formula to the rest of the cell locations in the column.
Turning off Excel’s relative referencing feature is accomplished through an absolute reference.
The following steps explain how this is done: 1.
Click cell B3 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Click cell D3.
4.
Type a forward slash (/).
5.
Click cell D12.
6.
Press the ENTER key.
You will see that Household Utilities represents 16.7% of the Annual Spend budget (see Figure 2.14 "Adding a Formula to Calculate the Percent of Total").
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 124 Figure 2.14 Adding a Formula to Calculate the Percent of Total Figure 2.14 "Adding a Formula to Calculate the Percent of Total" shows the completed formula that is calculating the percentage that Household Utilities Annual Spend represents to the total Annual Spend for the budget (see cell B3).
Normally, we would copy this formula and paste it into the range B4:B11.
However, because of relative referencing, both cell references will increase by one row as the formula is pasted into the cells below B3.
This is fine for the first cell reference in the formula (D3) but not for the second cell reference (D12).Figure 2.15 "#DIV/0 Error from Relative Referencing" illustrates what happens if we paste the formula into the range B4:B12 in its current state.
Notice that Excel produces the #DIV/0 error code.
This means that Excel is trying to divide a number by zero, which is impossible.
Looking at the formula in cell B4, you see that the first cell reference was changed from D3 to D4.
This is fine because we now want to divide the Annual Spend for Insurance by the total Annual Spend in cell D12.
However, Excel has also changed the D12 cell reference to D13.
Because cell location D13 is blank, the formula produces the #DIV/0 error code.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 125 Figure 2.15 #DIV/0 Error from Relative Referencing To eliminate the divide-by-zero error shown in Figure 2.15 "#DIV/0 Error from Relative Referencing", we must add an absolute reference to cell D12 in the formula.
An absolute reference prevents relative referencing from changing a cell reference in a formula.
This is also referred to as locking a cell.
The following explains how this is accomplished: 1.
Double click cell B3.
2.
Place the mouse pointer in front of D12 and click.
The blinking cursor should be in front of the D in the cell reference D12.
3.
Press the F4 key.
You will see a dollar sign ($) added in front of the column letter D and the row number 12.
You can also type the dollar signs in front of the column letter and row number.
4.
Press the ENTER key.
5.
Click cell B3.
6.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
7.
Highlight the range B4:B11.
8.
Click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 126 Figure 2.16 "Adding an Absolute Reference to a Cell Reference in a Formula" shows the percent of total formula with an absolute reference added to D12.
Notice that in cell B4, the cell reference remains D12 instead of changing to D13 as shown in Figure 2.15 "#DIV/0 Error from Relative Referencing".
Also, you will see that the percentages are being calculated in the rest of the cells in the column, and the divide-by- zero error is now eliminated.

Click in front of the column letter of a cell reference in a formula or function that you do not want altered when the formula or function is pasted into a new cell location.
2.
Press the F4 key or type a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of the cell reference.
The COUNT Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.05 if starting here.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 127 The next function that we will add to the Budget Detail worksheet is the COUNT function.
The COUNT function is used to determine how many cells in a range contain a numeric entry.
For the Budget Detail worksheet, we will use the COUNT function to count the number of items that are planned in the Annual Spend column (Column D).
The following explains how the COUNT function is added to the worksheet by using the function list: 1.
Click cell D13 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Type the letter C. 4.
Click the down arrow on the scroll bar of the function list (see Figure 2.17 "Using the Function List to Add the COUNT Function") and find the wordCOUNT.
5.
Double click the word COUNT from the function list.
6.
Highlight the range D3:D11.
7.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
8.
Press the ENTER key.
The function produces an output of 9 since there are 9 items planned on the worksheet.
Figure 2.17 "Using the Function List to Add the COUNT Function" shows the function list box that appears after completing steps 2 and 3 for the COUNT function.
The function list provides an alternative method for adding a function to a worksheet.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 128 Figure 2.17 Using the Function List to Add the COUNT Function Figure 2.18 "Completed COUNT Function in the Budget Detail Worksheet" shows the output of the COUNT function after pressing the ENTER key.
The function counts the number of cells in the range D3:D11 that contain a numeric value.
The result of 9 indicates that there are 9 categories planned for this budget.
Figure 2.18 Completed COUNT Function in the Budget Detail Worksheet Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 129 The AVERAGE Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.06 if starting here.)
The next function we will add to the Budget Detail worksheet is the AVERAGE function.
This function is used to calculate the arithmetic mean for a group of numbers.
For the Budget Detail worksheet, we will use the function to calculate the average of the values in the Annual Spend column.
We will add this to the worksheet by using the Function Library.
The following steps explain how this is accomplished: 1.
Click cell D14 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
3.
Click the More Functions button in the Function Library group of commands.
4.
Place the mouse pointer over the Statistical option from the drop-down list of options.
5.

This opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
6.
Click the Collapse Dialog button in the Function Arguments dialog box (seeFigure 2.20 "Function Arguments Dialog Box").
7.
Highlight the range D3:D11.
8.
Click the Expand Dialog button in the Function Arguments dialog box (seeFigure 2.21 "Selecting a Range from the Function Arguments Dialog Box").
You can also press the ENTER key to get the same result.
9.
Click the OK button on the Function Arguments dialog box.
This adds the AVERAGE function to the worksheet.
Figure 2.19 "Selecting the AVERAGE Function from the Function Library"illustrates how a function is selected from the Function Library in the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 130 Figure 2.19 Selecting the AVERAGE Function from the Function Library Figure 2.20 "Function Arguments Dialog Box" shows the Function Arguments dialog box.
This appears after a function is selected from the Function Library.
The Collapse Dialog button is used to hide the dialog box so a range of cells can be highlighted on the worksheet and then added to the function.
Figure 2.20 Function Arguments Dialog Box Figure 2.21 "Selecting a Range from the Function Arguments Dialog Box" shows how a range of cells can be selected from the Function Arguments dialog box once it has been collapsed.

The dialog box shows the result of the function before it is added to the cell location.
This allows you to assess the function output to determine whether it makes sense before adding it to the worksheet.
Figure 2.22 Function Arguments Dialog Box after a Cell Range Is Defined for a Function Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 132 Figure 2.23 "Completed AVERAGE Function" shows the completed AVERAGE function in the Budget Detail worksheet.
The output of the function shows that on average we expect to spend $1,994 for each of the categories listed in Column A of the budget.
This average spend calculation per category can be used as an indicator to determine which categories are costing more or less than the average budgeted spend dollars.

(Use file Excel Objective 2.07 if starting here.)
The final two statistical functions that we will add to the Budget Detailworksheet are the MAX and MIN functions.
These functions identify the highest and lowest values in a range of cells.
The following steps explain how to add these functions to the Budget Detail worksheet: 1.
Click cell D15 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.

Copy and Paste Formulas (Pasting without Formats) Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.08 if starting here.)
As shown in Figure 2.25 "MAX Function Added to the Budget Detail Worksheet", the COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX functions are summarizing the data in the Annual Spend column.
You will also notice that there is space to copy and paste these functions under the LY Spend column.
This allows us to compare what we spent last year and what we are planning to spend this year.
Normally, we would simply copy and paste these functions into the range E13:E16.
However, you may have noticed the double-line style border that was used around the perimeter of the range B13:E16.
If we used the regular Paste command, the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 135 double line on the right side of the range E13:E16 would be replaced with a single line.
Therefore, we are going to use one of the Paste Special commands to paste only the functions without any of the formatting treatments.
This is accomplished through the following steps: 1.
Highlight the range D13:D16 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click cell E13.
4.
Click the down arrow below the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
5.
Click the Formulas option from the drop-down list of buttons (see Figure 2.26 "Paste Formulas Option").
Figure 2.26 "Paste Formulas Option" shows the list of buttons that appear when you click the down arrow below the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
One thing to note about these options is that you can preview them before you make a selection by dragging the mouse pointer over the options.
As shown in the figure, when the mouse pointer is placed over the Formulas button, you can see how the functions will appear before making a selection.
Notice that the double-line border does not change when this option is previewed.
That is why this selection is made instead of the regular Paste option.

Sorting Data (Multiple Levels) Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.09 if starting here.)
The Budget Detail worksheet shown in Figure 2.26 "Paste Formulas Option" is now producing several mathematical outputs through formulas and functions.
The outputs allow you to analyze the details and identify trends as to how money is being budgeted and spent.
Before we draw some conclusions from this worksheet, we will sort the data based on the Percent of Total column.
As mentioned in Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills", sorting is a powerful tool that enables you to analyze key trends in any data set.
We demonstrated the process of executing a single-level sort in Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills".
For the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 137 purposes of the Budget Detail worksheet, we need to set multiple levels for the sort order.
This is accomplished through the following steps: 1.
Highlight the range A2:F11 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Data tab in the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Sort button in the Sort & Filter group of commands.
This opens the Sort dialog box, as shown in Figure 2.27 "Sort Dialog Box".

Figure 2.28 "Budget Detail Worksheet after Sorting" shows the Budget Detail worksheet after it has been sorted.
Notice that there are three identical values in the Percent of Total column.
This is why a second sort level had to be created for this worksheet.
The second sort level arranges the values of 8.4% based on the values in the LY Spend column in ascending order.
Excel gives you the option to set as many sort levels as necessary for the data contained in a worksheet.

Now that the Budget Detail worksheet is sorted, a few key trends can be easily identified.
The worksheet clearly shows that the top three categories as a percentage of total budgeted spending for the year are Taxes, Household Utilities, and Food.
All three categories are necessities (or realities) of life and typically require a significant amount of income for most households.
Looking at the Percent Change column, we can see how our planned spending is expected to change from last year.
This is perhaps the most import column on the worksheet because it allows you to assess whether your plan is realistic.
You will see that there are no changes planned for Taxes and Household Utilities.
While Taxes can change from year to year, it is not too difficult to predict what they will be.
In this case, we are assuming that there are no changes to the tax costs for our budget.
We are also planning no change in Household Utilities.
These costs can fluctuate from year to year as well.
However, you can take measures to reduce costs, such as using less electricity, turning off heat when no one is in the house, keeping track of your wireless minutes so you do not go over the maximum allowed in your plan, and so on.
As a result, there is no change in planned spending for Household Utilities because we will assume that any rate increases will be offset with a decrease in usage.
The third item that is planned not to change is Insurance.
Insurance policies for cars and homes can change, but as is true for taxes, the changes are predictable.
Therefore, we are assuming no changes in our insurance policy.
The first big change that is noticeable in the worksheet is the Food and Entertainment categories in rows 5 and 6 (see definitions in Table 2.1 "Spend Category Definitions").
The Percent Change column indicates that there is an 11.1% decrease in Entertainment spending and an 11.1% increase in Food spending.
This is logical because if you plan to eat in restaurants less frequently, you will be eating at home more frequently.
Although this makes sense in theory, it may be hard to do in practice.
Dinners and parties with friends may be tough to turn down.
However, the entire process of maintaining a budget is based on discipline, and it certainly takes a significant amount of discipline to plan targets for yourself and stick to them.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 140 A few other points to note are the changes in the Gasoline and Vacation categories.
If you commute to school or work, the price of gas can have a significant impact on your budget.
It is important to be realistic if gas prices are increasing, and you should reflect these increases in your budget.
To compensate for the increased spending for gas, the spending plan for vacations has been reduced by 25%.
Budgeting often requires a certain degree of creativity.
Although the Vacation budget has been reduced, there is still money you can set aside to make plans for spring break or winter break.
Finally, the budget shows a decrease in Miscellaneous spending of 19.8%.
This was defined as a group containing several expenses, such as textbooks, school supplies, software updates, and so on (see Table 2.1 "Spend Category Definitions").
You may be able to reduce your spending in this category if you can use items such as online textbooks.
This reduction in spending can free up funds for Clothes, a spend category that has increased by 20%.
We will continue to develop the Personal Budget workbook further in Section 2.3 "Functions for Personal Finance".
KEY TAKEAWAYS  Statistical functions are used when a mathematical process is required for a range of cells, such as summing the values in several cell locations.
For these computations, functions are preferable to formulas because adding many cell locations one at a time to a formula can be very time-consuming.
 Statistical functions can be created using cell ranges or selected cell locations separated by commas.
Make sure you use a cell range (two cell locations separated by a colon) when applying a statistical function to a contiguous range of cells.
 To prevent Excel from changing the cell references in a formula or function when they are pasted to a new cell location, you must use an absolute reference.
You can do this by placing a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of a cell reference.
 The #DIV/0 error appears if you create a formula that attempts to divide a constant or the value in a cell reference by zero.
 The Paste Formulas option is used when you need to paste formulas without any formatting treatments into cell locations that have already been formatted.
 You need to set multiple levels, or columns, in the Sort dialog box when sorting data that contains several duplicate values.

Notable items that are missing from the Budget Detail worksheet are the payments you might make for a car or a home.
In addition, you may want to set and track a savings goal.
This section demonstrates Excel functions used to calculate lease payments for a car, to calculate mortgage payments for a house, and to project future savings based on regular contributions and an average rate of return.
This section also discusses the scenario capabilities of Excel once the Personal Budget workbook is complete.
The Fundamentals of Loans and Leases Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.10 if starting here.)
One of the functions we will add to the Personal Budget workbook is the PMT function.
This function calculates the payments required for a loan or a lease.
However, before demonstrating this function, it is important to cover a few fundamental concepts on loans and leases.
A loan is a contractual agreement in which money is borrowed from a lender and paid back over a specific period of time.
The amount of money that is borrowed from the lender is called the principal of the loan.
The borrower is usually required to pay the principal of the loan plus interest.
When you borrow money to buy a house, the loan is referred to as a mortgage.
This is because the house being purchased also serves as collateral to ensure payment.
In other words, the bank can take possession of your house if you fail to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 144 make loan payments.
As shown in Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases", there are several key terms related to loans and leases.
Table 2.5 Key Terms for Loans and Leases Term Definition Collateral Any item of value that is used to secure a loan to ensure payments to the lender Down The amount of cash paid toward the purchase of a house.
If you are paying 20% down, you are Payment paying 20% of the cost of the house in cash and are borrowing the rest from a lender.
Interest Rate The interest that is charged to the borrower as a cost for borrowing money Mortgage A loan where property is put up for collateral Principal The amount of money that has been borrowed Residual Value The estimated selling price of a vehicle at a future point in time Terms The amount of time you have to repay a loan Figure 2.29 "Example of an Amortization Table" shows an example of an amortization table for a loan.
A lender is required by law to provide borrowers with an amortization table when a loan contract is offered.
The table in the figure shows how the payments of a loan would work if you borrowed $100,000 from a lender and agreed to pay it back over 10 years at an interest rate of 5%.
You will notice that each time you make a payment, you are paying the bank an interest fee plus some of the loan principal.
Each year the amount of interest paid to the bank decreases and the amount of money used to pay off the principal increases.
This is because the bank is charging you interest on the amount of principal that has not been paid.
As you pay off the principal, the interest rate is applied to a lower number, which reduces your interest charges.
Finally, the figure shows that the sum of the values in the Interest Payment column is $29,505.
This is how much it costs you to borrow this money over 10 years.
Indeed, borrowing money is not free.
It is important to note that to simplify this example, the payments were calculated on an annual basis.
However, most loan payments are made on a monthly basis.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 145 Figure 2.29 Example of an Amortization Table A lease is a contract in which you, the lessee, use an asset such as a car or a piece of equipment and you agree to make regular payments to the owner or the lessor.
When you lease a car, the manufacturer or a leasing company retains ownership of the vehicle and you agree to make regular payments for a specific period of time.
The amount of money you pay depends on the price of the car, the terms of the lease contract, and the car’s expected residual value at the end of the lease.
The calculation of lease payments is similar to the calculation of loan payments.
However, when you lease a car, you pay only the value of the car that is used.
For example, suppose you are leasing a car that is priced at $25,000.
The lease contract is for 4 years at an interest rate of 5%.
The residual value of the car is $10,000.
This means the car will lose $15,000 of its value over 4 years.
Another way to state this is that the car will depreciate $15,000.
A lease will be structured so that you pay this $15,000 in depreciation.
However, the interest charges will be Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 146 based on the purchase price of $25,000.
We will look at a demonstration of leasing a car as well as buying a home in the next section.
The PMT (Payment) Function for Loans Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.10 if starting here.)
If you own a home, your mortgage payments are a major component of your household budget.
If you are planning to buy a home, having a clear understanding of your monthly payments is critical for maintaining strong financial health.
In Excel, mortgage payments are conveniently calculated through the PMT (payment) function.
This function is more complex than the statistical functions covered in Section 2.2 "Statistical Functions".
With statistical functions, you are required to add only a range of cells or selected cells within the parentheses of the function.
With the PMT function, you must accurately define a series of arguments in order for the function to produce a reliable output.
Table 2.6 "Arguments for the PMT Function" lists the arguments for the PMT function.
It is helpful to review the key loan and lease terms in Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases" before reviewing the PMT function arguments.
Table 2.6 Arguments for the PMT Function Argument Definition This is the interest rate the lender is charging the borrower.
The interest rate is usually quoted in Rate annual terms, so you have to divide this rate by 12 if you are calculating monthly payments.
The argument letters stand for number of periods.
This is the term of the loan, which is the amount of time you have to repay the bank.
This is usually quoted in years, so you have to Nper multiply the years by 12 if you are calculating monthly payments.
The argument letters stand for present value.
This is the principal of the loan or the amount of money that is borrowed.
When defining this argument, a minus sign must precede the cell location Pv or value.
For leases, this argument is used for the price of the item being leased.
The argument letters stand for future value.
The brackets around the argument indicate that it is not always necessary to define it.
It is used if there is a lump-sum payment that will be made at the end of the loan terms.
This is also used for the residual value of a lease.
If it is not defined, Excel [Fv] will assume that it is zero.
This argument can be defined with either a 1 or a 0.
The number 1 is used if payments are made at the beginning of each period.
A 0 is used if payments are made at the end of each period.
The argument is in brackets because it does not have to be defined if payments are made at the end of [Type] each period.
Excel assumes that this argument is 0 if it is not defined.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 147 We will use the PMT function in the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the monthly mortgage payments for a house.
These calculations will be made in the Mortgage Payments worksheet and then displayed in the Budget Summary worksheet through a cell reference link.
So far we have demonstrated several methods for adding functions to a worksheet.
The following steps explain a new method using the Insert Function command for adding the PMT function: 1.
Click the Mortgage Payments worksheet tab.
2.
Click cell B5.
3.
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
4.
Click the Insert Function button (see Figure 2.30 "Mortgage Payments Worksheet").
This opens the Insert Function dialog box, which can be used for searching all functions in Excel.

Click cell B3 on the worksheet.
This is the rate being charged on the loan.
11.
Type a forward slash (/) for division.
12.
Type the number 12.
Since our goal is to calculate the monthly payments for the loan, we need to divide the rate, which is stated in annual terms, by 12.
This converts the annual rate to a monthly rate.
13.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
This returns the Function Arguments dialog box to its expanded form.
You will also see that the Rate argument is now defined.
14.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Nper argument in the Function Arguments dialog box.
This is the second argument we define in the function.
15.
Click cell B4 on the worksheet.
This is the term or the amount of time we have to repay the loan.
16.
Type an asterisk (*) for multiplication.
17.
Type the number 12.
Since our goal is to calculate the monthly payments for the loan, we need to multiply the terms of the loan by 12.
This converts the terms of the loan from years to months.
18.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
This returns the Function Arguments dialog box to its expanded form.
You will also see that the Nper argument is now defined.
19.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Pv argument in the Function Arguments dialog box.
This is the third argument we will define in the function.
20.
Type a minus sign (−).
When defining the Pv argument of the PMT function, any cell location or value must be preceded with a minus sign.
21.
Click cell B2 on the worksheet.
This is the principal of the loan.
22.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
You will now see the Rate, Nper, and Pv arguments defined for the function.
23.
Click the OK button at the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box.
The function will now be placed into the worksheet.
Since we are not paying any lump sums of money at the end of the loan, there is no need to define the Fv argument.
Also, we will assume that the monthly mortgage payments will be made at the end of each month.
Therefore, there is no need to define the Type argument.

Notice that the dialog box shows the values for the Rate and Nper arguments.
The Rate is divided by 12 to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate.
The Nper argument is multiplied by 12 to convert the terms of the loan from years to months.
Finally, the dialog box provides you with a definition for each argument.
The definition appears when you click in the input box for the argument.

In addition to calculating the mortgage payments for a home, the PMT function will be used in the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the lease payments for a car.
The details for the lease payments are found in the Car Lease Payments worksheet.
Similar to the statistical functions, we can type the PMT function directly into a cell.
However, you must know the definitions for each argument of the function and understand how these arguments need to be defined based on your objective.
The terms for loans and leases are in Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases", and the definitions for the arguments of the PMT function are in Table 2.6 "Arguments for the PMT Function".
The following steps explain how the PMT function is added to the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the lease payments for a car: 1.

7.
Type the number 12.
Since our goal is to calculate the monthly lease payments, we divide the interest rate by 12 to convert the annual rate to a monthly rate.
8.
Type a comma.
When you type a function containing arguments, you must separate each argument with a comma.
This signals to Excel that one argument has been defined and you are ready to define the next argument in the function.
9.
Click cell B5.
This is the term or the length of time for the lease contract.
Since the term is already expressed in months, we can just reference cell B5 and move to the next argument.
10.
Type a comma.
This advances the function to the Pv argument.
11.
Type a minus sign (−).
Remember that cell locations or values used to define the Pv argument must be preceded with a minus sign.
12.
Click cell B2 on the worksheet, which is the price of the car.
13.
Type a comma.
This advances the function to the [Fv] argument.

So far we have used cell references in formulas and functions, which allow Excel to produce new outputs when the values in the cell references are changed.
Cell references can also be used to display values or the outputs of formulas and functions in cell locations on other worksheets.
This is how data will be displayed on the Budget Summary worksheet in the Personal Budget workbook.
Outputs from the formulas and functions that were entered into the Budget Detail, Mortgage Payments, and Car Lease Payments worksheets will be displayed on the Budget Summary worksheet through the use of cell references.

When the mouse pointer turns to a black plus sign, left click and drag down to cell E7.
This copies and pastes the formula into cell E7.
Figure 2.39 "Calculating the Savings Rate" shows the output of the formulas calculating the spending rate and savings rate as a percentage of net income.
The absolute reference shown for cell D2 prevents the cell from changing when the formula is copied from cell E6 and pasted into cell E7.
The results of the formula show that our current budget allows for a savings rate of 5.9%.
This is a fairly good savings rate.
In the next section we will discuss how these savings can grow over time by exploring the time value of money concepts.
Figure 2.39 Calculating the Savings Rate Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 160 Time Value of Money Concepts Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.13 if starting here.)
In reviewing the Budget Summary worksheet in Figure 2.39 "Calculating the Savings Rate", you will notice that the range B9:D14 contains data that can be used to assess a savings plan.
We can project how much money can be saved over a specific period of time given set contributions and a rate of return.
This calculation is accomplished through the future value, or FV, function.
We will use the FV function in cell D10 of the Budget Summary worksheet to calculate our savings plan projection.
However, before we use the FV function, it is important to review a few basic concepts regarding the time value of money, as shown in Table 2.7 "Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts".
Table 2.7 Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts Argument Definition An investment that is made in regular payments over a period of time.
For example, depositing Annuity $100 a month into an interest-bearing bank account or mutual fund is considered an annuity.
An investment in which you lend money to a company or government entity.
The borrower agrees to pay you interest over a specific period time.
At the end of the bond agreement, the amount of money that was borrowed, or your initial investment, is returned to you.
Most bonds Bonds are considered a lower risk investment but offer a lower rate of return than stocks offer.
A collection of similar investments managed by a financial professional called a fund manager.
Mutual funds allow you to invest in several stocks or bonds without having to make many Mutual individual investments.
They also allow you to reduce your risk and take advantage of the Funds investment expertise of a professional.
The percentage gained or lost on an investment.
Investments that offer a high predicted rate of Rate of return often carry a higher risk of losing money.
Investments that offer a lower predicted rate of Return return often carry a lower risk of losing money.
An investment in which you own a portion of a company.
The value of this investment increases as the company produces higher profits.
Most stocks are expected to generate a higher rate of return than bonds generate.
However, the risk of losing money on a stock investment is much Stocks greater than the risk for bonds.
Table 2.7 "Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts" provides definitions for several terms used when addressing the time value of money concepts.
The time value of money is the opportunity to grow your money over time given a constant or average rate of return.
For example, consider the data shown in Figure 2.40 "Time Value of Money Example for a One-Time Investment".
This data assumes that a person makes a one-time investment of $100 in a bond mutual fund that returns 5% interest per year.
Notice that Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 161 the interest paid in Column E increases every year.
This is because the interest is reinvested in the mutual fund, which increases the total value of the investment.
For example, the interest earned in year 1 is based on a $100 investment.
Therefore, the interest paid is $5.00, or 5% of $100.
However, in year 2, when the $5.00 interest payment is reinvested, the total investment increases to $105.
Therefore, in year 2 the interest paid increases to $5.25, or 5% of $105.
The value of the investment at the end of 5 years is $127.63.
This is the value that can be calculated using the FV function.
Figure 2.40 Time Value of Money Example for a One-Time Investment Figure 2.41 "Time Value of Money Example for an Annuity Investment" shows another example demonstrating the time value of money concept.
Instead of making a one-time investment, we will assume that a person invests $100 at the beginning of every year in the same bond mutual fund.
This is referred to as an annuity because the person is making reoccurring investments over a specific period of time.
Notice that the value of this investment after 5 years is $580.19.
Also, the total interest earned on this investment is $80.19 as opposed to the $27.63 earned on the one-time investment in Figure 2.40 "Time Value of Money Example for a One-Time Investment".
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 162 Figure 2.41 Time Value of Money Example for an Annuity Investment The FV (Future Value) Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.13 if starting here.)
Establishing a personal savings plan is one of the most important financial exercises you can do.
For example, a savings plan is critical for establishing financial security for your retirement years.
Many people mistakenly believe that saving for retirement is something you do when you get older.
However, the greatest financial gains for your retirement can be achieved if you start saving in the earliest years of your career.
Now that you have an understanding of the time value of money, you can see that the more years you can earn interest on your investments and reinvest those earnings, the more money you will have when you retire.
Savings plans are also important for other key life events, such as going to college or buying a home.
The FV function is a convenient tool that can help you establish savings goals and project the value of your investments over time.
Similar to the PMT function, the FV function requires you to accurately define specific arguments in order to produce a reliable result.
Table 2.8 "Arguments for the FV Function" provides definitions for each of the arguments in the FV function.
It is helpful to review the time value of money terms in Table 2.7 "Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts" before using the FV function.
Table 2.8 Arguments for the FV Function Argument Definition This is the rate of return you expect to earn on an investment over time.
This rate is usually quoted Rate in annual terms, so you have to divide by 12 if you are calculating the value of an annuity making Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 163 Argument Definition investments on a monthly basis.
The argument letters stand for number of periods.
This is the amount of time you are using to measure the value of an investment.
The amount of time used to define this argument must be comparable to the Rate argument.
For example, if the rate is stated in terms of months, the amount Nper of time used to define this argument must be in months.
The argument letters stand for payment.
This argument is used if you are measuring the value of an annuity investment.
The argument is defined with the value of the investment that is made for each measure of time used to define the Nper argument.
For example, if the Nper argument is expressed in terms of months, you must define this argument with the investment value that is Pmt made every month.
The argument letters stand for present value.
The brackets around the argument indicate that it is not always necessary to define it.
Excel assumes zero if the argument is not defined.
The argument is used when measuring the value of a one-time investment.
Both this argument and the Pmt argument will be defined if an annuity investment has a beginning balance or includes a [Pv] beginning one-time lump-sum investment.
This argument can be defined with either a 1 or a 0.
The number 1 is used if investments are made at the beginning of each period used to define the Nper argument.
A 0 is used if the investments are made at the end of each period.
The argument is in brackets because it does not have to be defined if your investments are made at the end of each period.
Excel assumes that this argument [Type] is 0 if it is not defined.
With respect to the Personal Budget workbook, we will use the FV function to project the value of the savings plan in 10 years.
We will type the function directly into the Personal Budget worksheet for this demonstration.
However, you can use any of the methods demonstrated in this chapter for future use.
The following steps explain how this function is added to the worksheet: 1.
Click cell D10 in the Budget Summary worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Type the letters FV followed by an open parenthesis (().
4.
Click cell D13.
This is the expected rate of return for the investments.
5.
Type a comma.
6.
Click cell D12.
This is the amount of time the investments are expected to grow.
7.
Type a comma.
8.
Type a minus sign (−).
All values or cell locations used to define the Pmt argument must be preceded by a minus sign.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 164 9.
Click cell D7.
This is the change in cash that was calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the net income.
We are expecting to save this amount of money for the 10-year period this investment is being measured.
10.
Type a comma.
11.
Type a minus sign (−).
All values and cell locations used to define the Pv argument must be preceded by a minus sign.
12.
Click cell D14.
Since the savings plan has a current balance, we use this to define the Pv argument of the function.
This is equivalent to starting with a lump-sum investment.
13.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
There is no need to define the last argument of the function because we will assume that the savings in cash achieved in our budget will be invested at the end of each year of the savings plan.
14.
Press the ENTER key.
Check that cell D11 is activated.
15.
Type an equal sign (=).
16.
Click cell D10.
17.
Type a minus sign (−) and then click cell D9.
This subtracts the savings plan from the current savings plan projection.
18.
Press the ENTER key.
Integrity Check PMT and FV Functions Produce Negative Results If the results of the PMT function or FV function are negative, check the Pv or Pmt arguments.
Remember that these arguments must be preceded by a minus sign.
If the minus sign is omitted, the functions produce a negative output.
Figure 2.42 "Results of the Savings Plan Projections" shows the results of the FV function.
Notice that the current savings plan projection is $25,606.
This is $606 higher than the target of $25,000 entered into cell D9, which shows that the current budget is working to achieve the goals of this savings plan.
In other words, given the current net income, we are saving enough money to achieve our savings plan goals.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 165 There are two important factors to notice with regard to this plan.
The first factor is that our spending plan allows us to save enough money so that it can be invested to achieve our target of $25,000.
The second factor is that the expected rate of return is 3.5%.
This is a relatively low expected rate of return and could be achieved by investing in relatively low-risk investments such as bonds as opposed to stocks.
This rate can be considered good because we can achieve our savings goals without having to make high-risk investments that could result in a significant loss of our savings.
Figure 2.42 Results of the Savings Plan Projections Skill Refresher: FV Function 1.
Type an equal sign (=).
2.
Type the letters FV followed by an open parenthesis, or double click the function name from the function list.

Goal Seek (What-If Scenarios) Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 2.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 2.14 if starting here.)
We used several formulas and functions to complete the Personal Budget workbook shown in Figure 2.42 "Results of the Savings Plan Projections".
All the formulas and functions entered contain cell references that allow for a variety of what-if scenarios.
Goal Seek is a tool that can be used in the process of conducting these what-if scenarios.
Goal Seek maximizes the benefits of Excel’s cell-referencing capabilities by changing inputs to precise values to achieve specific outputs produced by formulas or functions.
We will begin by changing one of the inputs in the Personal Budget workbook through the following steps: 1.
Click the Budget Detail worksheet tab.
2.
Click cell D9.
3.
Type the number 2000.
Instead of planning a decrease in our vacation spending, we will see what happens to our budget if we spend the same amount as last year, which was $2,000.
4.
Press the ENTER key.
Figure 2.43 "Budget Detail Worksheet " and Figure 2.44 "Budget Detail Worksheet " show the Budget Detail worksheet before and after the change in the annual vacation budget.
By comparing these two figures you can see that by changing just one input, many of the outputs produced by the formulas and functions in the worksheet changed.
The following is a list of the changes that occurred in the worksheet: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 167  The formula output in cell F12 now shows that we are planning a 1.1% increase in our total spending as opposed to a −1.7% decrease.
 The formula output in cell F9 changes from −25% to 0%.
 The SUM function in cell D12 changes from $17,950 to $18,450.
 The SUM function in cell C12 changes from $1,496 to $1,538.
 The AVERAGE function in cell D14 changes from $1,994 to $2,050.
Figure 2.43 Budget Detail Worksheet before Changing the Annual Vacation Budget Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 168 Figure 2.44 Budget Detail Worksheet after Changing the Annual Vacation Budget In addition to the changes in the Budget Detail worksheet, outputs of formulas and functions on the Budget Summary worksheet also change when the Annual Spend for the Vacation category was increased.
To see the changes, compare Figure 2.42 "Results of the Savings Plan Projections" to Figure 2.45 "Budget Summary Worksheet ".
There were a total of fourteen changes in the outputs of formulas and functions on the Budget Summary worksheet.
In total, there were twenty-one outputs that changed in the Personal Budget workbook as a result of changing just one input.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 169 Figure 2.45 Budget Summary Worksheet after Changing the Annual Vacation Budget One of the most notable changes on the Budget Summary worksheet is the Savings Projection in cell D10.
By spending an additional $500 a year on vacation plans, the projected savings value in 10 years decreases by $5,865.
However, what if the rate of return were to increase?
An increase in the rate of return could recover the decrease in the future value of our savings plan.
We can use a tool such as Goal Seek to determine exactly how much the rate of return would have to increase to achieve our savings plan target of $25,000.
The following steps explain how to use Goal Seek to accomplish this goal: 1.
Click the Budget Summary worksheet tab.
2.
Click the Data tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the What-If Analysis button in the Data Tools group of commands.
4.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 171 Figure 2.47 Final Settings for the Goal Seek Dialog Box Figure 2.48 "Solution Calculated by Goal Seek" shows the solution Goal Seek calculated for the rate of return.
Notice that in order to achieve the target savings plan of $25,000, the rate of return must increase to 7.8%.
Initially, it appears that we can spend the additional $500 a year on vacations and still achieve our savings goal of $25,000.
However, achieving a 7.8% annual rate of return will require us to make riskier investments with our savings.
Thus, there is a greater possibility that we could lose a substantial amount of our savings.
This is the downside of decreasing your overall savings rate.
If you save less money, it forces you to take higher risks with the money you have in order to achieve higher rates of return.
Unfortunately, many people end up on the losing end of these risks, which severely compromises their ability to reach their savings goals.

KEY TAKEAWAYS  The PMT function can be used to calculate the monthly mortgage payments for a house or the monthly lease payments for a car.
 When using the PMT or FV functions, each argument must be separated by a comma.
 When using the PMT or FV functions, the arguments must be defined in comparable terms.
For example, when using the FV function, if the Pmt argument is defined using monthly payments, the Rate and Nper arguments must be defined in terms of months.
 The FV function is used to calculate the value an investment at a future point in time given a constant rate of return.
 The PMT and FV functions produce a negative output if the Pmt or Pv arguments are not preceded by a minus sign.
 Goal Seek is a valuable tool for creating what-if scenarios by changing the value in a cell location referenced in either a formula or a function.

These range from running your own bed and breakfast to a management position at a large hotel corporation.
No matter what hotel management career you choose to pursue, understanding the costs for any hotel operation is critical to running a successful operation.
This exercise examines the relationship between cleaning expenses and the occupancy rate of a small hotel.
Cleaning expenses are obviously influenced by the occupancy rate of the hotel.
As more rooms need to be cleaned, the amount of overall cleaning expenses increases.
However, to accurately estimate these expenses, you need to know whether there is a baseline, or fixed portion, of these expenses that does not change no matter how many rooms need to be cleaned.
In other words, if you pay a cleaning staff a fixed salary, it does not matter if they clean 1 room or 100 rooms; their salary will remain the same.
However, you may need more cleaning supplies as the number of rooms that need to be cleaned increases.
In addition, the replacement of guest necessities such as soap, shampoo, lotions, and so on will also increase as the number of rooms to be cleaned increases.
This exercise will demonstrate how these costs can be estimated through a technique called the high-low method.
Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 2.
1.
Enter a formula in cell C5 on the Historical Costs worksheet to calculate the January capacity for the hotel.
The capacity is calculated by multiplying the occupants per room (cell C3) by the number of rooms in the hotel (cell C2).
This result is then multiplied by the number of days in the month (cell C5).
Construct this formula so that relative referencing does not change cells C3 and C2 when the formula is pasted into other cell locations in Column C. 2.
Copy the formula in cell C5 and paste it into the range C6:C16.
Use a paste method that does not remove the border at the bottom of cell C16.
3.
Enter a formula in cell E5 on the Historical Costs worksheet to calculate the occupancy capacity of the hotel.
Your formula should divide the Hotel Capacity into the Actual Capacity.
Format your result to a percentage with two decimal places.
Then copy and paste the formula into the range E6:E16.
Use a paste method that does not remove the border at the bottom of cell E16.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 181 4.
Enter a function in cell C17 on the Historical Costs worksheet that sums the values in the range C5:C16.
Copy the function and paste it into cells D17 and F17.
Use a paste method that does not change the border on the right side of cell F17.
5.
Copy the formula in cell E16 and paste it into cell E17.
Use a paste method that does not change the border at the bottom of cell E17.
6.
Sort the data in the Historical Costs worksheet based on the values in the Actual Occupancy column in descending order (largest to smallest).
For any duplicate values in the Actual Occupancy column, sort using the values in the Cleaning Expenses column in descending order.
7.
On the Cost Analysis worksheet, enter a function into cell B3 that shows the highest value in the range D5:D16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the Historical Costs worksheet.
8.
On the Cost Analysis worksheet, enter a function into cell B4 that shows the lowest value in the range D5:D16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the Historical Costs worksheet.
9.
On the Cost Analysis worksheet, enter a function into cell C3 that shows the highest value in the range F5:F16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the Historical Costs worksheet.
10.
On the Cost Analysis worksheet, enter a function into cell C4 that shows the lowest value in the range F5:F16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the Historical Costs worksheet.
11.
On the Cost Analysis worksheet, format cells B3 and B4 with a comma and zero decimal places.
Format cells C3 and C4 with US dollars with zero decimal places.
12.
On the Cost Analysis worksheet, enter a formula in cell B5 that subtracts the lowest actual occupancy value from the highest actual occupancy value.
Copy this formula and paste it into cell C5.
13.
Enter a formula in cell C6 on the Cost Analysis worksheet that calculates that variable cost portion for the cleaning expenses per month.
As mentioned in the introduction to this exercise, the cleaning expense contains costs that increase with each room that is cleaned.
This is known as a variable expense and can be estimated by dividing the Actual Occupancy High Low Difference (cell B5) into the Cleaning Expenses High Low Difference (cell C5).
Format the output of this formula to US dollars with two decimal places.
14.
Enter a formula in cell C7 on the Cost Analysis worksheet that calculates the fixed cost portion for the cleaning expenses per month.
This is the amount of money that will be spent on cleaning Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 182 expenses no matter how many rooms are cleaned.
Since we have calculated the variable cost portion of the cleaning expense, we can now use it to calculate the fixed expense.
To do this, subtract from the High Cleaning Expense (cell C3) the result of multiplying the variable expense (cell C6) by the High Actual Occupancy (cell B3).
Format the result of the formula to US dollars with zero decimal places.
15.
Enter the number 3500 in cell C2 on the Cleaning Cost Estimatesworksheet.
Format the number with commas and zero decimal places.
16.
Apply a yellow fill color to cell C2 on the Cleaning Cost Estimatesworksheet.
This is being formatted to indicate to the user of this worksheet that a number is to be entered into the cell.
17.
On the Cleaning Cost Estimates worksheet, enter a formula in cell C3 that calculates the estimated cleaning expenses given the number that was entered into cell C2.
Now that we have calculated the variable and fixed expenses on the Cost Analysis worksheet, we can use the results to estimate the cleaning expenses.
The formula is a + bX, wherea is the fixed cost, b is the variable cost, and X is the activity level that is typed into cell C2.
The fixed cost is added to the result of multiplying the variable cost by the activity level in cell C2.
Format the output of the formula to US dollars with zero decimal places.

Read the scenario below, then open the Excel workbook related to this exercise.
You will find a worksheet in the workbook named AnswerSheet.
This worksheet is to be used for any written responses required for this exercise.
Scenario Your friend is working on a few financial calculations in Excel and is asking for your assistance.
The workbook that was given to you contains calculations for estimating the future value of investments and monthly mortgage calculations for purchasing a home.
Your friend explained the following in an e-mail that was sent with the workbook:  You will see in the Investment Plan worksheet that I have estimated the value of my investments in 5 years.
My company is taking money out of my paycheck at the end of every Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 186 month and investing it in the funds I have listed in Column A. I am pretty sure I did this right, but all my results in Column E are negative.
I am not sure why this is happening.
 In the Mortgage Payments worksheet, I am trying to calculate the monthly payments for a house I am thinking about buying.
However, the output of the function in cell B6 seems really high.
There is no way I would be paying over $9,000 a month in mortgage payments.
Something must be wrong.
 I don’t want to spend more than $775 a month for a mortgage.
I thought I would be able to use Excel to determine what my target price for the house should be.
My agent said that the current owners were probably willing to negotiate on the asking price for the house.
Assignment 1.
Look at the FV function that was entered into cell E3 on theInvestment Plan worksheet.
Why is the output for this function negative?
2.
Assume that the output of the FV function in cell E3 was a positive $17,385 instead of negative.
Does it make sense that given a 4.5% annual rate of return, starting balance of $10,000, and an ongoing investment of $900 per month that the value of the investment would be $17,385 after 5 years?
3.
Look at the PMT function in cell B6 on the Mortgage Payments worksheet.
Is the function set up to calculate monthly payments?
4.
You friend states that the target monthly mortgage payment is $775.
What Excel tool could you use to change the price in cell B2 on the Mortgage Payments worksheet so the mortgage payment is equal to $775?
5.
Based on your friend’s comments, make any necessary corrections to all the functions in the Investment Plan and Mortgage Payments worksheets.
Set the price of the home in cell B2 on the Mortgage Payments worksheet so the monthly payment equals $775.

Applying Excel Skills Lease vs. Buy Starter File: None Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 187 Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate You are in the process of getting a new car but are not sure if you should buy or lease.
The price of the car you want is $18,000, but you do not want to spend more than $250 a month on car payments.
If you lease the car, the terms of the lease will be 48 months at an annual interest rate of 5%.
The residual value of the car will be set at $9,000.
If you buy the car, your bank will offer you a 7-year loan at an annual interest rate of 6%.
You are not required to make a down payment with either the lease or loan options, and payments are made at the end of the month for both options.
Should you lease or buy the car given your budget limit of $250 a month?
Create a new workbook and design a worksheet that shows the difference between leasing and buying the car in terms of monthly payments.
Use proper formatting so your worksheet is easy to read.
Remember to use column and row headings, add a title to your worksheet, and rename the worksheet tab with an appropriate label.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 191 Chapter 3 Logical and Lookup Functions Going beyond the basic computational tools of Excel unlocks unlimited potential for processing and analyzing data.
This chapter takes you beyond basic Excel computations by introducing logical functions and lookup functions.
Logical functions are used to assess the contents within cell locations and produce custom outputs or mathematical computations.
We will look at two types of logical functions in this chapter.
The first is the IF function, which uses a logical test to evaluate the contents in a cell location.
The OR and AND functions also use logical tests to evaluate the contents in a cell location and are often used within the IF function.
The second type of logical function that we will look at are statistical IF functions.
These functions combine the logical test feature of the IF function with the mathematical computation features of statistical functions (which were reviewed in Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations").
The last section of this chapter demonstrates the use of two lookup functions.
These functions are used to find data in one worksheet and display it in another.
We will demonstrate the skills for this chapter through the construction of a personal investment portfolio.
This theme builds on the personal budget project introduced in Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations".
In the personal budget project, we analyzed the impact of investing money in an account that provides a continuous rate of return.
In this chapter we look at how you can decide where to invest your money and how to analyze the performance of those investments.

This section reviews the use of logical functions in Excel through the construction of an investment portfolio.
Although it may seem that managing investments is a specialized career choice, the reality is that almost everyone will become an investor at some point in their lives.
Many companies offer employees retirement savings benefits through 401(k) or 403(b) plans.
These plans allow you to deduct money from your paycheck every month, tax-free, and invest it.
In addition to the tax benefits afforded by such plans, many employers match a percentage of your monthly savings or deposit money into your retirement account as an added form of compensation.
When you sign up for these savings plans, your company will give you a list of options as to how your money can be invested, and you choose the type of investments you would like the company to make on your behalf.
As a result of this process, you become an investor.
Excel can be an extremely valuable tool to help you make these investment decisions and analyze the performance of the money you have invested.
Figure 3.1 "Completed Personal Investment Portfolio Workbook" shows the completed investment portfolio workbook that we will complete in this chapter.
Similar to the personal budget example in Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations", the Portfolio Summary worksheet contains a Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 193 summary of the data entered or calculated in other worksheets in the workbook.
This project begins by building on the Investment Detail worksheet.
Figure 3.1 Completed Personal Investment Portfolio Workbook Freeze Panes Follow-along file: Excel Objective 3.00 The Investment Detail worksheet shown in Figure 3.2 "Investment Detail Worksheet" contains the majority of the information used to create the Portfolio Summary worksheet shown in Figure 3.1 "Completed Personal Investment Portfolio Workbook".
When you first open the worksheet, you will notice it is not possible to view all twenty-four columns on your computer screen.
As you scroll to the right to view the rest of the columns, you will lose site of the row headings in Columns A and B.
The headings in these columns show the investment that pertains to the data in Columns C through X.
To solve this problem of viewing the row headings while scrolling through the remaining columns in the worksheet, we will use the Freeze Panes command.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 194 Figure 3.2 Investment Detail Worksheet The Freeze Panes command allows you to scroll across the Investment Detail worksheet while keeping the row headings in Columns A and B locked in place.
The following steps explain how to do this: 1.
Click cell C4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
We select this cell because the Freeze Panes option locks the columns to the left of the activated cell as well as the rows above the activated cell.
2.
Click the View tab on the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Freeze Panes button (see Figure 3.3 "Freeze Panes Command").
4.
Click the Freeze Panes option from the drop-down list of options.

Since this is a large worksheet, you may find it easier to navigate the columns by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
However, since rows 1 and 2 contain merged cells, make sure a cell location is activated below Row 2 before you begin using the arrow keys.
Figure 3.4 "Freeze Panes Command Activated on the Investment Detail Worksheet" shows the appearance of the Investment Detail worksheet after the Freeze Panes command has been activated.
To deactivate the Freeze Panes command, click the Freeze Panes button again and select the Unfreeze Panes option.

(Use file Excel Objective 3.01 if starting here.)
We will begin developing the personal investment portfolio workbook by adding several formulas and functions.
The formulas and functions we will add were illustrated in detail in Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations".
Therefore, the steps provided in this chapter will be brief.
After the formulas and functions are added to the Investment Detail worksheet, we can add the logical and lookup functions.
However, before proceeding, let’s review the investment type definitions in Table 3.1 "Investment Types in Column A of the Investment Detail Worksheet".
Table 3.1 "Investment Types in Column A of the Investment Detail Worksheet" provides a definition for each of the investment types listed in Column A of the Investment Detail worksheet.
This project assumes that the personal investment portfolio comprises four types of investments.
The reason we include a variety of investment types in any portfolio is to manage our total risk, or potential of losing money.
When building an investment portfolio, it is important to keep in mind that investments of all types can dramatically increase or decrease in value over a short period of time.
Managing risk requires that your money is not concentrated in one type of investment.
Table 3.1 Investment Types in Column A of the Investment Detail Worksheet Category Definition A mutual fund consisting of a variety of bonds.
The benefit of buying shares of a fund as opposed to a specific bond is that doing so allows you to spread your investment over Bond Fund several bonds instead of concentrating your investment in just one bond.
Domestic Stock A mutual fund consisting of several domestic stocks.
Buying shares of a stock mutual fund Fund provides the benefit of investing your money over several stocks.
International Stock Fund Same as a domestic stock fund but contains a variety of non-US or foreign stocks.
The stock for one specific company.
In addition to mutual funds, this chapter’s portfolio will include a few individual stocks for public companies.
When you purchase shares of a Individual Stock specific company, such as IBM, you become a partial owner of that company.
We will begin adding formulas and functions to the Investment Detail worksheet in sections.
If you scroll across all the columns in the worksheet, you will notice the worksheet includes five distinct sections.
Four of the five sections contain columns that need to be completed with formulas and functions before Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 197 we can add the logical and lookup functions.
Table 3.2 "Definitions for Columns A through G of the Investment Detail Worksheet" contains definitions for each of the columns in the Descriptive Information section (Columns A through D) and the Purchase section (Columns E through G).
It will be helpful to understand the purpose of these columns as we complete this worksheet.
Table 3.2 Definitions for Columns A through G of the Investment Detail Worksheet Category Definition The type of investment with regard to bonds and stocks.
A definition for each of the investment types used in this portfolio can be found in Table 3.1 "Investment Types in Investment Type Column A of the Investment Detail Worksheet".
The symbol that represents a mutual fund or stock.
This symbol can be used to research Symbol the profile or current trading price on any website that provides stock quotes.
The company name for an individual stock or a description of the type of investments Description made by a mutual fund.
The amount of interest earned on a bond or bond fund or the amount of earnings Dividend/Yield distributed per share for an individual stock or stock fund.
Shares Purchased The amount of shares purchased for a mutual fund or individual stock.
Purchase Price The price paid for the shares purchased for the mutual funds and individual stocks in the per Share portfolio.
The number of shares purchased multiplied by the purchase price per share.
This represents your base investment and is used to determine how much money has been Cost of Purchase gained or lost.
The Descriptive Information section of the Investment Detail worksheet (Columns A through D) contains only one blank column, which will be completed using a lookup function.
Therefore, we will proceed to the Purchase section (Columns E through G) where the Cost of Purchase column is blank.
The following steps explain how to enter the formula into this column: 1.

Figure 3.5 "Completed Formula in the Cost of Purchase Column" shows the formula that was entered into cell G4 in the Purchase section of the Investment Detail worksheet.
You can also see the results of the formula after it is pasted into the range G5:G18.
The Paste Formulas option was used to paste the formula into this range so the borders would not be altered.
Figure 3.5 Completed Formula in the Cost of Purchase Column Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 199 Table 3.3 "Definitions for Columns H through K of the Investment Detail Worksheet" shows the definitions for the Current Value section (Columns H through K) of the Investment Detail worksheet.
Table 3.3 Definitions for Columns H through K of the Investment Detail Worksheet Category Definition Current Price The current price of an individual stock or the current net asset value of a mutual fund.
Current Purchase Value The number of shares purchased multiplied by the current price.
The estimated amount of money paid for the interest on a bond fund or the dividends paid Estimated on a stock or stock fund.
The future value function is used to estimate these payments.
For Dividend an actual portfolio, real monetary distributions can be added to the current purchase value of Payments the investment to calculate the total value of an investment.
Current The current purchase value plus the estimated dividend payments.
The current investment Investment value is compared with the cost of purchase to determine how much money is gained or Value lost.
We will add a basic formula to the Current Purchase Value and Current Investment Value columns.
For the Estimated Dividend Payments column, we will use the FV (future value) function to estimate the dividend payments.
The following explains how we add the FV function to the Estimated Dividend Payments column: 1.
Click cell J4 and type an equal sign (=).
2.
Type the function name FV followed by an open parenthesis (().
3.
Click cell D4, type a forward slash (/) for division, and then type 12.
This divides the rate in the Dividend/Yield column by 12.
The length of ownership of an investment is expressed in terms of months in Column Q.
Therefore, the rate for the FV function must be expressed in terms of months by dividing the annual rate by 12.
4.
Type a comma.
5.
Click cell Q4, which contains the number of months owned or the term of the future value calculation.
6.
Type a comma followed by a zero (,0).
We are not calculating an annuity or periodic investment in this example, so the PMT argument will be defined with a zero.
Type a comma to advance the function to the Pv argument.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 200 7.
Type a minus sign (−) and click cell G4.
This is the cost of the investment purchase previously calculated.
8.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
9.
Type a minus sign (−) and click cell G4.
By itself, the FV function is calculating the total value of the investment with dividends or interest earned.
To show only the amount of dividends or interest earned, we subtract the cost of the investment purchase in G4 from the result of the FV function.
10.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
11.
Adjust the decimal places for the output of the FV function to zero.
12.
Copy the FV function in cell J4 and paste it into the range J5:J18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Figure 3.6 "Completed FV Function in the Estimated Dividend Payments Column" shows the completed FV function in cell J4 of the Estimated Dividend Payments column.
It is important to reduce the decimal places to zero after you enter the function into cell J4.
Excel does not display the result of the function until the decimal places are removed because of the column width.
Figure 3.6 Completed FV Function in the Estimated Dividend Payments Column The following steps explain how to add the formulas for the Current Purchase Value and Current Investment Value columns: 1.
Click cell I4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 201 2.
Enter a formula that multiplies the Current Price in cell H4 by the Shares Purchased in cell E4.
3.
Copy the formula in cell I4 and paste it into the range I5:I18 using the Paste Formulas command.
4.
Click cell K4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
5.
Enter a formula that adds the Current Purchase Value in cell I4 to the Estimated Dividend Payments in cell J4.
6.
Copy the formula in cell K4 and paste it into the range K5:K18 using the Paste Formulas command.
7.
Click cell K19 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
8.
Enter a SUM function that adds the values in the range K4:K18.
Figure 3.7 "Completed Current Value Section of the Investment Detail Worksheet" shows the completed columns of the Current Value section in theInvestment Detail worksheet.
The formula used to calculate the Current Investment Value illustrates why we used the FV function to calculate the estimated dividend or interest payments for an investment.
Investments that earn interest or dividends can achieve growth in two ways.
The first way is through interest or dividend payments.
The second way is through changes in the price paid for the investment.
The formula used to calculate the Current Purchase Value is taking the number of shares purchased for each investment and multiplying it by the current market price.
Therefore, the Current Investment Value takes into account any changes in the investment price by adding the purchase value at the current market price to any dividends or interest payments earned.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 202 Figure 3.7 Completed Current Value Section of the Investment Detail Worksheet Table 3.4 "Definitions for Columns L through R of the Investment Detail Worksheet" provides definitions for the Percent of Portfolio section of the Investment Detail worksheet (Columns L through R).
Table 3.4 Definitions for Columns L through R of the Investment Detail Worksheet Category Definition Current Percent of Portfolio The current investment value divided by the total current value of the investment portfolio.
Target Percent of Portfolio The planned percentage each investment is intended to have for the entire portfolio.
Current vs.
The difference between the Current Percent of Portfolio column and the Target Percent of Target Portfolio column.
Shows which investments do not match the target percentage of the portfolio.
For example, as one investment increases in value due to an increase in market price, it will comprise a greater percentage of the portfolio.
This may require that some shares of this asset be sold and invested in other areas that may have decreased in value.
This is known as rebalancing Rebalance the portfolio, and it helps you sell investments when prices are high and buy investments Indicator when prices are low.
Buy/Sell Based on the results of the Rebalance Indicator, a logical function is used to indicate whether Indicator an investment should be purchased or sold.
Shows how many months an investment is owned.
The length of ownership is expressed in Months terms of months since dividend payments on stock funds and interest payments on bond Owned funds are distributed monthly.
Long/Short Shows whether an investment has been owned long enough to qualify as a long-term Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 203 Category Definition Indicator investment, which is greater than twelve months.
The amount of taxes paid on the amount of money gained for a short-term investment is greater than a long-term investment.
Therefore, there is a tax incentive to hold investments for more than twelve months.
The Percent of Portfolio section of the Investment Detail worksheet (Columns L through R) requires two formulas and one function.
The following steps explain how we add them to the worksheet: 1.
Click cell L4 in the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Enter a formula that divides the Current Investment Value in cell K4 by the total in cell K19.
3.
Place an absolute reference on cell K19 in the formula by placing the cursor in front of the column letter and pressing the F4 key on your keyboard.
4.
Copy the formula and paste it into the range L5:L18 using the Paste Formulas command.
5.
Click cell N4 in the Investment Detail worksheet.
6.
Enter a formula that subtracts the Target Percent of Portfolio (cell M4) from the Current Percent of Portfolio (cell L4): L4−M4.
7.
Copy the formula and paste it into the range N5:N18 using the Paste Formulas command.
8.
Click cell Q19 in the Investment Detail worksheet.
9.
Enter an AVERAGE function that calculates the average of the values in the range Q4:Q18.
Figure 3.8 "Percent of Portfolio Section of the Investment Detail Worksheet"shows the results of adding two formulas and a function to the Percent of Portfolio section of the Investment Detail worksheet.
Notice the absolute reference added to the cell reference for K19 in the formula in the Current Percent of Portfolio column.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 204 Figure 3.8 Percent of Portfolio Section of the Investment Detail Worksheet Table 3.5 "Definitions for Columns S through X of the Investment Detail Worksheet" provides definitions for the columns in the Performance Analysis section of the Investment Detail worksheet.
Table 3.5 Definitions for Columns S through X of the Investment Detail Worksheet Category Definition Unrealized The amount of money gained or lost on an investment.
It is considered unrealized Gain/Loss because the loss or gain does not actually occur until the investment is sold.
The percentage increase or decrease based on the unrealized gain/loss and the purchase Percent Gain/Loss value of an investment.
The expected annual growth rate for an investment.
All investments are expected to Target Annual grow over time.
The rate of growth depends on the amount of risk taken.
Investments Growth Rate that are a higher risk are expected to pay a higher rate of return.
Actual Annual The percentage gain/loss divided by the amount of time an investment is owned Growth Rate expressed in terms of years.
Target vs. Actual Growth Rate The difference between the actual annual growth rate and the target annual growth rate.
Performance A logical function will be used to indicate which investments are underperforming with Indicator respect to the target vs. actual growth rate.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 205 Most of the columns in the Performance Analysis section of the Investment Detail worksheet will be completed with formulas and functions.
The following steps explain how we add them to the worksheet: 1.
Click cell S4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Enter a formula that subtracts the value in the Cost of Purchase column (cell G4) from the value in the Current Investment Value column (cell K4):K4−G4.
3.
Copy the formula and paste it into the range S5:S19 using the Paste Formulas command.
Note that this formula will be used to calculate the output for the Total row in this column.
The results of the formula are showing how much money has been earned or lost for each investment.
It is important to note that these gains or losses do not actually happen unless the investment is sold.
4.
Click cell T4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
5.
Enter a formula that divides the Unrealized Gain/Loss (cell S4) by the Cost of Purchase (cell G4): S4/G4.
6.
Copy the formula in cell T4 and paste it into the range T5:T19 using the Paste Formulas command.
7.
Click cell V4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
8.
Enter a formula that divides the Percent Gain/Loss (cell T4) by the result of dividing the Months Owned (cell Q4) by 12: T4/(Q4/12).
Dividing the Months Owned value by 12 expresses the amount of time an investment has been owned in terms of years.
The benchmark growth rates for most investments are expressed in terms of annual return rates.
Therefore, this formula must first express the amount of time an investment has been owned in terms of years.
Then the total percentage gain or loss for each investment is divided by the length of ownership in years to calculate the actual annual rate of return.
9.
Copy the formula in cell V4 and paste it into the range V5:V19 using the Paste Formulas command.
10.
Click cell W4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
11.
Enter a formula that subtracts the Target Annual Growth Rate (cell U4) from the Actual Annual Growth Rate (cell V4): V4−U4.
12.
Copy the formula in cell W4 and paste it into the range W5:W18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 206 Figure 3.9 "Performance Analysis Section of the Investment Detail Worksheet" shows the results of the formulas added to the Performance Analysis section of the Investment Detail worksheet.
This completes the required formulas and functions necessary to add before moving on to the logical and lookup functions of the chapter.
Figure 3.9 Performance Analysis Section of the Investment Detail Worksheet The Logical Test Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.02 if starting here.)
A key component for the logical functions that will be demonstrated in this section is the logical test.
A logical test is used in logical functions to evaluate the contents of a cell location.
The results of the logical test can be either true or false.
For example, the logical test C7 = 25 (read as “if the value in cell C7 is equal to 25”) can be either true or false depending on the value that is entered into cell C7.
A logical test can be constructed with a variety of comparison operators, as shown in Table 3.6 "Comparison Operator Symbols and Definitions".
These comparison operators will be used in the logical test arguments for the logical functions demonstrated in this chapter.
Table 3.6 Comparison Operator Symbols and Definitions Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 207 Symbol Definition = Equal To > Greater Than > Less Than < > Not Equal To > = Greater Than or Equal To < = Less Than or Equal To A logical test will be used to evaluate the contents of a cell location in the Investment Detail worksheet.
We will first demonstrate how the logical test is used to evaluate the contents of a cell location.
Then we will use this logical test in the IF function, which will be demonstrated next.
The following steps explain how the logical test is constructed: 1.
Click cell R4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Click cell Q4.
4.
Type the greater than sign (>) followed by an equal sign (=).
5.
Type the number 12.
This completes the logical test, which is shown inFigure 3.10 "Logical Test Entered into the Investment Detail Worksheet".
The logical test would be stated as: “If the value in cell Q4 is greater than or equal to 12.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 208 Figure 3.10 Logical Test Entered into the Investment Detail Worksheet 6.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
Notice that the output of the logical test is the word TRUE.
This is because the value in cell Q4 is 48, which is greater than 12 (see Figure 3.11 "Output of the Logical Test").
7.
Copy the logical test in cell R4 and paste it into the range R5:R18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Figure 3.11 "Output of the Logical Test" shows the results of the logical test after it is pasted into the range R5:R18.
Notice that for any values that are less than 12 in the range Q4:Q18, the logical test produces an output of FALSE.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 209 Figure 3.11 Output of the Logical Test IF Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.03 if starting here.)
The IF function is used to produce a custom output based on the results of a logical test.
If the results of the logical test are TRUE, the IF function can display a specific number or text, or perform a calculation.
If the results of the logical test are FALSE, the IF function can display a different number or text, or perform a different calculation.
The arguments of the IF function are defined inTable 3.7 "Arguments for the IF Function".
Table 3.7 Arguments for the IF Function Argument Definition A test used to evaluate the contents of a cell location.
This argument typically utilizes Logical_test comparison operators, which are defined in Table 3.6 "Comparison Operator Symbols and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 210 Argument Definition Definitions".
The results of the test can be either true or false.
For example, the test C7>25 would be read as if C7 is greater than 25.
If the number 30 is entered into cell C7, the logical test is true.
If you are evaluating a cell that contains text data, the text in the logical test must be placed inside quotation marks.
For example, if you wanted to test if the word Long is in cell C7, the logical test would be C7 = “Long”.
The output that will be displayed by the function or the calculation that will be performed by the function if the results of the logical test are true.
This argument can be defined with a formula, function, number, or text.
However, when defining this argument with a text output [Value_if_true] such as the word Long, it must be placed inside quotation marks (“Long”).
The output that will be displayed by the function or the calculation that will be performed by the function if the results of the logical test are false.
This argument can be defined with a formula, function, number, or text.
However, when defining this argument with a text output [Value_if_false] such as the word Long, it must be placed inside quotation marks (“Long”).
We will use the IF function in the Percent of Portfolio section of the Investment Detail worksheet.
We will use the logical test that was previously demonstrated within the IF function to determine if an investment has been held for a short or long period of time.
For tax purposes, an investment is considered short-term if it is held less than twelve months.
This requires the investor to pay a higher tax percentage for any profit earned on the investment.
An investment held twelve months or longer is considered a long- term investment.
The following explains how the IF function is used to identify which investments are long term or short term: 1.
Highlight the range R4:R18 on the Investment Detail worksheet and press the DELETE key on your keyboard.
This will remove the logical test and allow us to replace it with an IF function.
2.
Click cell R4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
3.
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
4.
Click the Logical button in the Function Library group of commands.
5.
Click the IF function from the list of functions (see Figure 3.12 "Selecting the IF Function from the Function Library").
This opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 211 Figure 3.12 Selecting the IF Function from the Function Library 6.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Logical_test argument (seeFigure 3.13 "Logical_Test Argument Defined").
7.
Click cell Q4 and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
8.
Type the greater than sign (>) followed by an equal sign (=).
9.
Type the number 12.
Figure 3.13 "Logical_Test Argument Defined" shows the appearance of the IF Function Arguments dialog box after defining the Logical_test argument.
Notice that next to the Logical_test input box, Excel shows that the results of the test are true.
This makes sense given that the value in cell Q4 is 48, which is greater than 12.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 212 Figure 3.13 Logical_Test Argument Defined 10.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the next argument, which is Value_if_true.
11.
Type the word Long in quotation marks.
If you forget to put words or text in quotation marks using the Function Arguments dialog box, Excel will insert the quotation marks for you.
12.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the next argument, which is Value_if_false.
13.
Type the word Short in quotation marks.
14.
Click the OK button on the Function Arguments dialog box to complete the function.
15.
Copy the IF function in cell R4 and paste it into the range R5:R18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Integrity Check Placing Text in Quotation Marks for Logical Functions If you are using a logical function to evaluate text data in a cell location, or if you are using a logical function to output text data, the text must be placed inside quotation marks.
For example, if you are using a logical function to evaluate whether the word Long is entered into cell B5, the logical test must appear as follows: B5= “Long”.
If you omit the quotation marks, the function may produce an erroneous false result for the test.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 213 Figure 3.14 "Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the IF Function"shows the completed Function Arguments dialog box for the IF function.
Notice that the results of the function are displayed in the dialog box.
Since the value in cell Q4 is greater than 12, the word Long will be displayed in cell R4.
Figure 3.14 Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the IF Function Figure 3.15 "IF Function Output" shows the completed Long/Short Indicator column on the Investment Detail worksheet.
Notice the word Short is displayed for any investment held less than twelve months.

Type an equal sign (=).
2.
Type the function name IF followed by an open parenthesis (().
3.
Define the logical_test argument to evaluate the contents of a cell location such that the result of the test is either true or false.
4.
Define the value_if_true argument, which will be the output of the function if the results of the logical test are true.
5.
Define the value_if_false argument, which will be the output of the function if the results of the logical test are false.
This argument can also be defined by starting another IF function if you are nesting IF functions.
6.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
In the case of nested IF functions, type a closing parenthesis for every IF function that was started.
7.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The OR Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.04 if starting here.)
The OR function is similar to the IF function in that it uses a logical test to evaluate the contents of a cell location.
However, the OR function allows you to define several logical tests as opposed to just one.
If one of the logical tests is true, the output of the function will be the word TRUE.
If all the logical tests are false, the output of the function will be the word FALSE.
This differs from the IF function because the output of the function is only the word TRUE or the wordFALSE.
As a result, the OR function is commonly used within the IF function to enable specific outputs to be defined.
We will use the OR function in the Performance Indicator column on theInvestment Detail worksheet.
The purpose of this column is to identify any investment where either the Unrealized Gain/Loss is less than zero or the Target vs. Actual Growth Rate is less than –1%.
We will use the function in the logical test of an IF function so we can define a specific output based on the results of the OR function.
However, we will first demonstrate how the OR function works by itself, which is outlined in the following steps: 1.
Click cell X4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 215 2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Type the function name OR followed by an open parenthesis (().
4.
Click cell S4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
5.
Type the less than symbol (<) followed by a zero.
This completes the first logical test, which is evaluating if the value in cell S4 is less than zero.
6.
Type a comma.
This advances the function to a second logical test.
7.
Click cell W4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
8.
Type the less than symbol (<) followed by −1%.
Be sure to include the minus sign and percent symbol.
This completes the second logical test, which is evaluating if the value in cell W4 is less than –1%.
9.
Type a closing parenthesis ()) and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
10.
Copy the OR function in cell X4 and paste it into the range X5:X18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Figure 3.16 Completed OR Function by Itself Figure 3.16 "Completed OR Function by Itself" shows the construction and result of the OR function by itself.
Notice that the only output of the function is the word TRUE or the word FALSE.
If either the Unrealized Gain/Loss is less than zero or the Target vs. Actual Growth Rate is less than −1%, the function shows the word TRUE.
However, these descriptions will not be helpful for the person using this worksheet.
Displaying the words OK or Warning would be far more helpful in identifying investments Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 216 that need to be evaluated.
We can do this if we use the OR function in the logical test argument of the IF function.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Highlight the range X4:X18 on the Investment Detail worksheet and press the DELETE key on your keyboard.
We are going to start over by creating an IF function.
2.
Click cell X4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
3.
Type an equal sign (=).
4.
Type the function name IF followed by an open parenthesis (().
5.
Type the function name OR followed by an open parenthesis (().
The OR function is being placed into the logical_test argument of this IF function.
6.
Click cell S4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
7.
Type the less than symbol (<) followed by a zero.
8.
Type a comma.
This advances the function to a second logical test.
9.
Click cell W4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
10.
Type the less than symbol (<) followed by −1%.
11.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
12.
Type an equal sign (=).
13.
Type the word TRUE.
Do not put the word inside quotation marks.
14.
Type a comma.
This completes the logical_test argument of the IF function.
We can now go on to define the value_if_true and thevalue_if_false arguments.
This will allow us to specify what the output of the function should be instead, using the OR function outputs of either TRUE or FALSE.
15.
Type the word Warning.
Be sure to enclose the word in quotation marks.
16.
Type a comma.
This will advance the function to the value_if_falseargument.
17.
Type the word OK. Be sure to enclose the word in quotation marks.
18.
Type a closing parenthesis ())and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
19.
Copy the IF function in cell X4 and paste it into the range X5:X18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 217 Figure 3.17 "OR Function in the Logical Test of the IF Function" shows the OR function within the logical_test argument of the IF function.
The logical test of the IF function is now evaluating if the results of the OR function are true.
Figure 3.17 OR Function in the Logical Test of the IF Function Skill Refresher: OR Function 1.
Type an equal sign (=).
2.
Type the function name OR followed by an open parenthesis (().
3.
Define the logical_test argument to evaluate the contents of a cell location such that the result of the test is either true or false.
4.
Define additional logical test arguments as needed.
The output of the function will be TRUE if any of the logical tests are true.
5.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
6.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The AND Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.05 if starting here.)
The AND function is almost identical to the OR function in that it is composed of only logical tests and produces one of two possible outputs: TRUE or FALSE.
However, all logical tests defined for the AND Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 218 function must be true in order to produce a TRUE output.
If one logical test is false, the function will produce a FALSE output.
We will use the AND function to complete the Buy/Sell Indicator column on the Investment Detail worksheet.
This column will show either the word Buy or the words Hold or Sell based on the results of the logical test argument of an IF function.
We will use the AND function to define the logical test argument of the IF function.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Click cell P4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Type the function name IF followed by an open parenthesis (().
4.
Type the function name AND followed by an open parenthesis (().
The AND function is being placed into the logical_test argument of this IF function.
5.
Click cell N4 and then type the less than symbol (<</b>).
6.
Type a minus sign (−) followed by the number 1 and a percent symbol: (−1%).
7.
Type a comma.
This advances the AND function to the second logical test.
8.
Click cell S4.
9.
Type a greater than symbol (>) followed by an equal sign (=).
These symbols are used to evaluate if the value in a cell location is greater than or equal to a target value.
10.
Type a zero followed by a closing parenthesis ()).
11.
Type an equal sign (=) followed by the word TRUE.
Do not enclose the word in quotation marks.
Figure 3.18 "AND Function Placed in the Logical Test of an IF Function"shows the appearance of the AND function that has been added to the logical test of the IF function.
The AND function will produce a true output if the value in cell N4 is <−1% and the value in cell S4 is greater than or equal to 0.
Figure 3.18 AND Function Placed in the Logical Test of an IF Function Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 219 12.
Type a comma.
This advances the IF function to the value_if_trueargument.
13.
Type the word Buy enclosed in quotation marks as shown in Figure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function".
If the Current vs. Target value is less than −1% and the Unrealized Gain/Loss is greater than or equal to zero, the function will show the word Buy.
In other words, if the investment is less than the desired percentage for the total portfolio and it is currently not losing money, we will buy more of that investment so it is in line with the target percentage of the portfolio.
14.
Type a comma.
15.
Type the words Hold or Sell enclosed in quotation marks as shown inFigure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function".
For all other investments that are not designated with a Buyindicator, the function will show the words Hold or Sell.
This indicates that an investment could either be held or sold.
16.
Type a closing parenthesis ()) and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
17.
Copy the IF function in cell P4 and paste it into the range P5:P18 using the Paste Formulas command.
18.
Increase the width of Column P to 12 points.
Figure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function" shows the results of the completed AND function within an IF function after it is copied and pasted into the range P5:P18.

3.
Define the logical_test argument to evaluate the contents of a cell location such that the result of the test is either true or false.
4.
Define additional logical test arguments as needed.
The output of the function will be TRUE if ALL of the logical tests are true.
5.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
6.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
Nested IF Functions Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.

When constructing the IF function, the logical test can produce only two potential outcomes when evaluating the data in a cell.
In addition, the function can produce only two possible outputs, which are defined in thevalue_if_true and value_if_false arguments.
However, there may be situations when Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 221 you need to test for several possible outcomes, which may require more than two possible outputs.
To accomplish this, you need to create a nested IF function.
A nested IF function is when either the value_if_trueor value_if_false arguments are defined with another IF function.
For the Personal Investment workbook, a nested IF function is required to complete the Rebalance Indicator column (Column O) on the Investment Detail worksheet (see Figure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function").
The purpose of this column is to indicate where the portfolio needs to be rebalanced.
Looking at the Current vs. Target column (Column N) shown in Figure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function", you can see that several investments have a significant negative number where the investment value has fallen below the target percentage for the portfolio.
Other investments have a significant positive number where the investment has exceeded the target percentage for the portfolio.
For this portfolio, a number greater than 1% or less than –1% will be considered significant.
Therefore, we will need to assess three possible outcomes when creating a logical test that evaluates the values in Column N. The first test will be if the value is greater than 1%.
The second test will be if the value is less than –1%.
The third test will be if both the first test and the second test are false.
This is why we need to construct a nested IF function to produce the outputs in the Rebalance Indicator column.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Click cell O4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Type an equal sign (=).
3.
Type the function name IF followed by an open parenthesis (().
4.
Click cell N4.
5.
Type the greater than symbol (>) followed by the number 1%.
It is important to use the percent symbol (%) after the number 1.
If you omit the percent symbol, Excel will test if the value in cell N4 is greater than 100%.
6.
Type a comma.
7.
Type the word Rebalance inside quotation marks.
When using text data to define any of the arguments for the IF function, the text must be placed inside quotation marks.
8.
Type a comma.
9.
Start another IF function by typing the function name IF followed by an open parenthesis (().
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 222 10.
Click cell N4.
11.
Type the less than symbol (<) followed by −1%.
12.
Type a comma.
13.
Type the word Rebalance inside quotation marks.
14.
Type a comma.
15.
Type the word OK inside quotation marks.
16.
Type two closing parentheses ())).
Since two IF functions were started, there are two open parentheses in the function.
As a result, we need to add two closing parentheses; otherwise, Excel will produce an error message stating that a closing parenthesis is missing.
17.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
18.
Copy the nested IF function in cell O4 and paste it into the range O5:O18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Integrity Check Using Logical Functions to Evaluate Percentages If you are using a logical function to evaluate percentages in a cell location, be sure to use the percent symbol when defining the logical test.
For example, if you are testing cell location B5 to determine if the value is greater than 10%, the logical test should appear as follows: B5>10%.
If you omit the percent sign, the logical test will evaluate cell B5 to see if the value is greater than 1000%.
This may erroneously force the function to produce the value_if_false output.
You can also convert the percentage to a decimal in the logical test.
For example, in decimal form, the logical test can be constructed as follows: B5>.10.
Figure 3.20 "Completed Nested IF Function" shows how the completed nested IF function should appear in cell O4 of the Investment Detail worksheet.
In addition, we see the results of the function after it was pasted into the range O5:O18.
Notice that for any investment where the Current vs. Target value is between plus or minus 1%, the word OK appears.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 223 Figure 3.20 Completed Nested IF Function Why?
Use AND or OR functions within IF functions The benefit of using the AND or OR functions within the IF function is that doing so reduces the need to construct lengthy nested IF functions.
It becomes increasingly difficult to manage the accuracy of lengthy nested IF functions.
The AND and OR functions allow you to test for a variety of conditions in a cell location, which can reduce the need to nest multiple IF functions.
Examine the nested if function in cell O4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
Can you recreate this without nesting the IF function?
Basic Conditional Formats Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.07 if starting here.)
A feature related to the skills used to create logical functions is conditional formatting.
Conditional formats allow you to apply a variety of formatting treatments based on the contents of a cell location.
A logical test similar to the ones used in the IF, AND, and OR functions is used to evaluate the contents of a cell and apply a designated formatting treatment.
For example, looking atFigure 3.20 "Completed Nested IF Function", you will notice that the Unrealized Gain/Loss column is formatted using the accounting number format.
Negative numbers are enclosed in parentheses.
However, to make these numbers stand out, we can use conditional formatting to change the font color to red.
We Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 224 will do this for the Unrealized Gain/Loss and Percent Gain/Loss columns.
The following steps explain how conditional formats are applied to the cell locations in these columns: 1.
Highlight the range S4:T18 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Conditional Formatting button in the Styles group of commands on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the New Rule command from the list of options (see Figure 3.21 "Conditional Formatting Options List").
This will open the New Formatting Rule dialog box.

Click the second option that states “Format only cells that contain.” 5.
In the lower portions of the New Formatting Rule dialog box, you will see several drop-down boxes under the heading Edit the Rule Description.
Make sure the first drop-down box is set to Cell Value.
6.
Click the second drop-down box in the Edit the Rule Description section of the New Formatting Rule dialog box and select the “less than” option.
7.
Click in the input box, which is next to the drop-down box that was set in the previous step, and type a zero.
This completes the logical test of the conditional format, which is going to evaluate if the value in any of the cells in the range S4:T18 is less than zero.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 225 8.
Click the Format button, which is near the bottom of the New Formatting Rule dialog box.

KEY TAKEAWAYS Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 228  The Freeze Panes command should be used to lock column and row headings in place while scrolling through large worksheets.
 The IF function is used to evaluate the contents of a cell location using a logical test.
Based on the results of the logical test, you designate a custom output or calculation to be performed by the function.
 When using text, or nonnumeric data, to define any argument of the IF function, it must be placed inside quotation marks.
 A nested IF function is used when more than one logical test and more than two outputs are required for a project.
Either the Value_if_true or theValue_if_false arguments can be defined with an IF function.
 When using percentages in any logical test or formula, you must use the percent symbol (%) or convert the percentage to a decimal.
For example, 10% can also be expressed as .10.
 The OR function is used when many logical tests are required to evaluate the contents of a cell location.
The OR function will produce a TRUE output if one of the logical tests is true.
 The AND function is used when many logical tests are required to evaluate the contents of a cell location.
The AND function will produce a TRUE output if all of the logical tests are true.
 To minimize the complexity of nested IF functions, the OR and AND functions should be used when possible to define the logical_test argument of the IF function.

Use the COUNTIF function to count selected nonblank cells in a range based on one criteria argument.
2.
Use the AVERAGEIF function to calculate the average of selected cells in a range based on the values in an alternate range of cells and one criteria argument.
3.
Use the SUMIF function to calculate the sum of selected cells in a range based on the values in an alternate range of cells and one criteria argument.
4.
Use the COUNTIFS function to count selected nonblank cells in a range based on more than one criteria argument that utilizes a logical test.
5.
Use the AVERAGEIFS function to calculate the average of selected cells in a range based on the values in an alternate range of cells using more than one criteria argument that utilizes a logical test.
6.
Use the SUMIFS function to calculate the sum of selected cells in a range based on the values in an alternate range of cells using more than one criteria argument that utilizes a logical test.
This section will demonstrate the use of statistical IF functions.
Statistical IF functions provide you with the ability to evaluate the contents in a cell location before including them in a mathematical calculation.
This allows you to selectively include targeted cell locations when executing statistical calculations such as sum, average, count, and so on.
We will use several statistical IF functions to construct the Portfolio Summary worksheet shown in Figure 3.1 "Completed Personal Investment Portfolio Workbook", which contains two main sections.
The Total Summary section (Rows 2 through 8) shows an overview for all investments in the portfolio by investment type.
This will allow us to compare the growth performance among the Bond Funds, Domestic Stock Funds, and others.
The Poor Performing Investments section (Rows 9 through 15) will provide an overview of poor performing investments by investment type.
For the purposes of this exercise, we will define a poor performing investment as one where the growth rate is below the target growth rate by more than 1% (see Column W on the Investment Detail worksheet).
The statistical IF functions will allow us to establish criteria to select targeted investments that can be included in the calculations for each section of the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
The COUNTIF Function Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 231 Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.08 if starting here.)
The COUNTIF function differs from the regular COUNT function in two ways.
First, the regular COUNT function counts only the number of cells in a range that contain numeric data.
The COUNTIF function counts the number of cells in a range that contain numeric or text data.
Second, the COUNTIF function allows you to selectively count the cells in a range based on specific criteria.
The COUNTIF function contains two arguments: range and criteria.
The range argument is defined with the range of cells that will be counted.
The criteria argument is defined with the criteria that will be used to decide if a cell in the range should be included in the output of the function.
The following steps explain how we can use the COUNTIF function to calculate the number of investments by investment type on the Portfolio Summary worksheet: 1.
Click cell B4 on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
2.
Click the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the More Functions button in the Function Library group of commands.
4.
Place the mouse pointer over the Statistical option from the drop-down list.
5.
Click the scroll down arrow on the second drop-down list to find the COUNTIF function (see Figure 3.25 "Selecting the COUNTIF Function from the Function Library").
6.
Click the COUNTIF function.
This will open the Function Arguments dialog box.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 232 Figure 3.25 Selecting the COUNTIF Function from the Function Library 7.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Range argument on the Function Arguments dialog box (see Figure 3.26 "Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the COUNTIF Function").
8.
Click the Investment Detail worksheet tab.
9.
Highlight the range A4:A18 on the Investment Detail worksheet and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
10.
Click in the Range argument input box and place an absolute reference on the range A4:A18.
This is done by typing a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number for both cells in the range.
Alternatively, place the insertion point after the 4 in cell reference A4 and press the F4 key on your keyboard.
Then place the insertion point after the 8 in cell reference A18 and press the F4 key.
This will add the $ to the appropriate positions automatically.
11.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the next argument, which is the Criteria argument.
Then type the cell location A4.
The criteria for the function will be the investment type entered into cell A4 on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
12.
Click the OK button at the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box.
Figure 3.26 "Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the COUNTIF Function" shows the completed Function Arguments Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 233 dialog box for the COUNTIF function.
Notice the absolute references that were placed on each cell location in the range that was used to define the Range argument.
TheCriteria argument is defined with the cell A4, which means the function will only count cell locations in the range A4:A18 where the contents in the cell match the contents in cell A4.

Copy the function in cell B4 and paste it into the range B5:B7 using the Paste Formulas command.
14.
Enter a SUM function in cell B8 that sums the values in the range B4:B7.
Figure 3.27 "COUNTIF Function Output in the Portfolio Summary Worksheet"shows the results of the COUNTIF function after it is pasted into the range B5:B7.
Because of relative referencing, the cell location used in the criteriaargument is changed after the function is pasted into the range B5:B7.
For example, in cell B6, the function is counting the cell locations in the range A4:A18 where the contents match the contents of cell A6.
This allows you to use the function to count the number of investments per investment type.
As shown in the figure, the range B4:B7 now shows the number of investments in this portfolio by investment type.

The AVERAGEIF Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.09 if starting here.)
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 235 The AVERAGEIF function performs the identical mathematical calculation as the regular AVERAGE function.
However, similar to the COUNTIF function, it allows you to define criteria that will select cells in a range that will be used in the function output.
The AVERAGEIF function differs from the COUNTIF function in that it allows you to define two cell ranges instead of one.
The first range pertains to the criteria that will be used to select cells for the function output.
The second range contains the values that will be used to calculate the arithmetic mean.
Table 3.8 "Arguments for the AVERAGEIF and SUMIF Functions" provides definitions for the arguments contained in the AVERAGEIF and SUMIF functions.
Table 3.8 Arguments for the AVERAGEIF and SUMIF Functions Argument Definition Range Range of cells that will be evaluated by the criteria argument.
Criteria that will be used to evaluate the range of cells that is used to define the Range argument.
This argument can be defined with a cell location, formula, number, text, or logical test.
Note that text and logical tests must be enclosed in Criteria quotation marks.
Range of cells that will be used to calculate the average when using the AVERAGEIF function, or the sum when using the SUMIF function.
This argument is enclosed in [Average_range] or brackets because it does not always need to be defined.
If this argument is omitted, the [Sum_range] function will use the range of cells in the Range argument to calculate the output.
The AVERAGEIF function will be used in the Portfolio Summary worksheet to calculate the average length of time that investments for each investment type are held.
The following steps explain how to add this function to the worksheet: 1.
Click cell C4 on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
2.
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
3.

Figure 3.28 "Defined Arguments for the AVERAGEIF Function" shows the Function Arguments dialog box for the AVERAGEIF function that will be input into cell C4.
Notice that absolute references are placed on the cell locations used to define the Range and Average_range arguments.
The function will evaluate the cells in the range A4:A18 using the value that exists in cell A4 on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
When a cell in the range A4:A18 meets the criteria, the function will pull the cell location in the same row from the range Q4:Q18 and include it in the average calculation.

The function calculates the average months owned in Column Q on the Investment Detailworksheet where the investment type is equal to the description entered in the range A4:A7 on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 238 Figure 3.29 AVERAGEIF Function Output on the Portfolio Summary Worksheet Integrity Check Matching Row Numbers for the Range and Average_range (or Sum_range) Arguments When defining the Average_range argument for the AVERAGEIF function or the Sum_range argument for the SUMIF function, it is good practice to make sure the row numbers match the row numbers used in the Rangeargument.
For example, if the Range argument is defined with the range A4:A12, the range used to define the Average_range or Sum_rangeargument should begin with Row 4 and end with Row 12.
If the row numbers in these two arguments do not match, Excel will include the values only in the rows used to define the Range argument.
For example, if theRange argument is defined with the range A4:A12 and theAverage_range (or Sum_range) argument is defined with the range D4:D20, only the values in cells D4:D12 will be included in the function output.

The SUMIF Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.10 if starting here.)
The SUMIF function performs the same mathematical calculation as the regular SUM function.
However, similar to the AVERAGEIF function, this function allows you to select specific cells from a range that will be used in the output.
The arguments for the SUMIF function are identical to the AVERAGEIF function (see Table 3.8 "Arguments for the AVERAGEIF and SUMIF Functions").
We will use the SUMIF function in two columns on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
The first column will show the total investment cost for each investment type.
The second column will show the total current value for each investment type.

(Use file Excel Objective 3.11 if starting here.)
Up to this point, the statistical IF functions that were demonstrated provided the ability to define one criteria or logical test used to select cells from a targeted range.
The next set of statistical functions that will be demonstrated provides the ability to define multiple sets of criteria for selecting cells from a targeted range.
We will begin with the COUNTIFS function.
It is easy to distinguish the difference between a statistical IF function that allows one criteria argument to be defined and one that allows multiple criteria arguments.
If the IF at the end of the function name is plural, you can define multiple sets of criteria arguments.
Therefore, the COUNTIFS function provides the option of defining multiple sets of criteria for selecting cells from a targeted range that will be used in the function output.
The arguments for the COUNTIFS function are established in pairs.
For example, the first arguments for the function are Criteria_range1 and Criteria1.
The function will use theCriteria1 argument to select cells in the Criteria_range1 argument.
A second pair of arguments, Criteria_range2 and Criteria2, can be defined to select a subset of cell locations that were selected in the Criteria_range1 andCriteria1 arguments.
This process can be repeated for several pairs of criteria arguments.
We will continue to work on the Portfolio Summary worksheet by adding the COUNTIFS function to count the number of poor performing investments by investment type.
The following steps explain how to add this function to the worksheet: 1.
Click cell B11 on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 247 Why?
Use Statistical IF Functions for a Summary Worksheet When creating a summary worksheet that summarizes detailed data from other worksheets, such as the Portfolio Summary worksheet in Figure 3.32 "Completed Annual Growth Column in the Portfolio Summary Worksheet", it is best to use statistical IF functions.
If data is added to the detailed worksheet that is being summarized, the statistical IF functions will automatically include the new data in the summary worksheet.
For example, suppose a row is added below Row 7 on the Investment Detail worksheet (see Figure 3.24 "Conditional Format Applied to the Range S4:T18") and another bond investment is added.
The statistical IF functions will automatically pick up the new investment and include it in the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
If regular statistical functions or formulas are used, the summary worksheet can easily become inaccurate if new data is added to the detailed worksheet or if the sort order is changed.
Figure 3.33 "Defined Arguments for the COUNTIFS Function" shows the completed arguments for the COUNTIFS function in the Function Arguments dialog box.
Notice the scroll bar that appears on the right side of the Function Arguments dialog box.

Integrity Check Error Message for Statistical IF Functions If you receive an error message when attempting to enter a statistical IF function into a cell location, check to make sure any criteria using a comparison operator is enclosed in quotation marks.
For example, if you are assessing a range of cells to see if the values are greater than or equal to zero, you must define Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 260 the Criteria argument as follows: “>=0”.
If you do not use the quotation marks, Excel will not accept the function in the cell location and will display an error message.
Figure 3.41 "Completed Poor Performing Investments Section of the Portfolio Summary Worksheet" shows the completed Poor Performing Investments section on the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
Notice that even though an investment is considered “poor performing” it does not mean that money is lost on the investment.
As shown in the figure, only one investment in the International Stock Fund category is losing money, with an annual growth rate of −5.4%.
However, the total annual growth rate for all investments in the Poor Performing section is 2.2% (see cell F15).
This is less than half the growth rate for the overall portfolio, which is 6.2% (see cell F8).
A final observation is that all the investments in the Domestic Stock Fund category are “poor performing.” The same number of investments in the Total Summary section appears in the Poor Performing Investments section.
This completes the Portfolio Summary worksheet with the exception of one column.
We will complete this column in the next section with a lookup function.

KEY TAKEAWAYS  The COUNTIF, SUMIF, and AVERAGEIF functions can select specific cell locations from a range to compute an output using one criteria argument.
 The COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, and AVERAGEIFS functions can select specific cell locations from a range to compute an output using multiple sets of criteria arguments.
 When using the AVERAGEIF and SUMIF functions, the row numbers used in the ranges to define the Range argument and the Average_range orSum_range arguments must be identical.
 The benefit of using statistical functions when creating a summary worksheet is that if rows of data are added to the detail worksheet, the new data will automatically be included in the function output.
 When using statistical IF functions, the logical test used to define a criteria argument must be enclosed in quotation marks.

Create a web query that imports stock price data into a worksheet from a website.
The final section of this chapter addresses lookup functions.
Lookup functions are typically used to search for and display data located in other worksheets or workbooks.
The two lookup functions we will use in our example of the personal investment portfolio are the VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions.
In addition to demonstrating these functions, we will also show how we can enhance the personal investment portfolio workbook with a web query.
Web queries are used to bring live or current data into a worksheet from a website.
The VLOOKUP Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.14 if starting here.)
The VLOOKUP function is typically used to access and display data located in another worksheet or workbook.
The function can also be used to access and display data located in the same worksheet.
This is a very powerful and versatile function because it eliminates the need to copy or recreate data that exists in other worksheets or workbooks.
It is called a VLOOKUP function because the function will search vertically down the first column of a range of cells to find what is called a lookup value.
This process is very similar to the statistical IF functions in Section 3.2 "Statistical IF Functions".
You will recall that these functions used criteria to select cells from a range that was used in the mathematical output.
The VLOOKUP function is essentially performing the same process; however, instead of selecting multiple cells from a range, the function is only looking for one specific cell location.
Once the function finds the specific cell location, it will display the contents of that cell location or another cell location in the range.
Before using the VLOOKUP function in the personal investment portfolio workbook, it is Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 265 strongly recommended that you carefully read the definitions for the function arguments listed in Table 3.10 "Arguments for the VLOOKUP Function".
Table 3.10 Arguments for the VLOOKUP Function Argument Definition This argument is typically defined with a cell location, number, or text.
Text data must be enclosed in quotation marks for this argument.
The function will search for the criteria entered into this argument in the first column of the range used to define theTable_array argument.
For example, if the word Hat is used to define this argument, the function will search for the word Hat in the first column of the range used to define Lookup_value the Table_arrayargument.
Range of cells that contain data you wish the VLOOKUP function to search though (Lookup_value) and display.
This cell range mustcontain the criteria used to define the Lookup_value in the first column.
For example, if the range A2:D15 is used to define this argument, the criteria used to define the Lookup_valueargument must exist in Column Table_array A.
This is the column index number argument.
It is defined with the number of columns to the right of the first column in the range used to define the Table_array argument that contains the data you wish to display.
For example, suppose the data you wish the function to display is contained in Column C. If the range used to define the Table_array argument is A2:D15, then the column index number will be 3.
Counting the columns to the right of the first column in this range, Column A would be 1, Column B would be 2, and Column C would Col_index_num be 3.
It is important to remember to count the first column in the table array range as 1.
This argument is defined with either the word TRUE or the wordFALSE.
When this argument is defined with the word FALSE, the function will look for an exact match to the criteria used to define the Lookup_value argument in the first column of the table array range.
It is important to note the function will search the entire range to find a match.
If this argument is defined with the wordTRUE, the function will look for a value that is an exact match or the closest match that is less than the lookup value.
For example, if the lookup value is 80 and the highest value in the first column of the table array range is a 78, the function will consider 78 a match for the number 80.
However, if the lookup value is 80 and the lowest number in the first column of the table array range is 85, the function will produce an error.
This is because the number 80 and any value less than 80 do not exist in the first column of the table array range.
It is important to note that if you define this argument with the word TRUE, the data in the table array range must be sorted in ascending order.
This is because the function will stop searching for a match once the value in the first column exceeds the lookup value.
If the data in the table array range is not sorted, the function can either produce an error code or display an erroneous result.
This argument is in brackets because if it is not defined it will automatically be defined with the [Range_lookup] wordTRUE.
Integrity Check Using a TRUE Range Lookup for VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 266 If you are defining the Range_lookup argument with the word TRUE for either the VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP function, the range used to define theTable_array argument must be sorted in ascending order.
For the VLOOKUP function, the table array range must be sorted from smallest to largest or from A to Z based on the values in the first column.
For the HLOOKUP function, the table array range must be sorted from left to right based on the values in the first row, from smallest to largest or A to Z.
You may have noticed that on the Investment Detail worksheet, the Description column is blank (see Figure 3.2 "Investment Detail Worksheet").
Descriptions for several investments are included in the workbook in the Investment List worksheet as shown in Figure 3.42 "Investment List Worksheet".
The VLOOKUP function will be used to search for a specific symbol in Column A of the Investment List worksheet and display the description for that symbol located in Column B.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: Figure 3.42 Investment List Worksheet 1.
Click cell C4 on the Investment Detail worksheet.
2.
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 267 3.
Click the Lookup & Reference button in the Function Library group of commands.
4.
Select the VLOOKUP function from the list of functions.
Use the scroll bar to scroll down to the bottom of the list.
This will open the Function Arguments dialog box for the VLOOKUP function.
5.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Lookup_value argument on the Function Arguments dialog box.
6.
Click cell B4 and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The symbol in cell B4 is the lookup value that will be searched in the first column of the range defined for the Table_array argument.
7.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Table_array argument on the Function Arguments dialog box.
8.
Click the Investment List worksheet tab.
9.
Highlight the range A3:F23 on the Investment List worksheet and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The function will look in Column A of this range for the lookup value.
10.
Click in the input box for the Table_array argument and place an absolute reference on the range A3:F23.
This is done by typing a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of each cell location in the range.
11.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the Col_index_numargument and type the number 2.
Once the function finds the lookup value in Column A of the range A3:F23, it will display the description that is in Column B of the same row.
12.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the Range_lookupargument and type the word FALSE.
This will direct the function to search for only exact matches to lookup value.
13.
Click the OK button at the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box.
14.
Copy the VLOOKUP function in cell C4 and paste it into the range C5:C18 using the Paste Formulas command.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 268 Figure 3.43 "Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the VLOOKUP Function" shows the completed Function Arguments dialog box for the VLOOKUP function.
Notice that the Range_lookup argument is defined with the word FALSE.
This will direct the function to search for an exact match to the lookup value and will also direct the function to search the entire first column of the table array range.
Finally, it is important to note the absolute reference on the table array range.
This will prevent the table array range from changing when the function is pasted into other cell locations.
Figure 3.43 Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the VLOOKUP Function Figure 3.44 "Results of the VLOOKUP Function in the Investment Detail Worksheet" shows the results of the VLOOKUP function in the Investment Detail worksheet.
The function is searching for each symbol in Column B of theInvestment Detail worksheet in Column A of the Investment Listworksheet.
When the function finds a match, it will display whatever is in the cell location two columns to the right, or Column B, in the Investment Listworksheet.
For example, the symbol VDMIX, which is in cell B8 on theInvestment Detail worksheet (see Figure 3.44 "Results of the VLOOKUP Function in the Investment Detail Worksheet"), is also in cell A15 on theInvestment List worksheet (see Figure 3.42 "Investment List Worksheet").
As a result, the function is displaying whatever is in cell B15 on the Investment List worksheet, which is the description “Developed Markets.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 269 Figure 3.44 Results of the VLOOKUP Function in the Investment Detail Worksheet Integrity Check Absolute References on the Table Array Range for the VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP Functions If you are copying and pasting a VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP function, you will most likely need to place an absolute reference on the range used to define the Table_array argument.
The table array range will change because of relative referencing once the function is pasted to new cell locations.
This may result in an error output for either the VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP function.
This is because the function will not be able to find the lookup value since the range has been adjusted.
If you are defining theRange_lookup argument with the word TRUE, an adjustment in the table array range may result in an erroneous output.
Skill Refresher: VLOOKUP Function 1.
Type an equal sign (=).
2.
Type the function name VLOOKUP followed by an open parenthesis (().
3.

7.
Define the Col_index_num argument with a number that designates the columns to the right in the table array range that will be displayed by the function.
Count the first column of the table array range as 1.
8.
Type a comma.
9.
Define the Range_lookup argument with either the word FALSE or the word TRUE.
The word FALSE will search for exact matches to the lookup value.
The word TRUE will search for an exact or closest match less than the lookup value.
Excel will define this argument as TRUE if it is omitted.
10.
Type a closing parenthesis ()).
11.
Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The HLOOKUP Function Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 3.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 3.15 if starting here.)
The HLOOKUP function serves the same purpose as the VLOOKUP function.
The HLOOKUP function can be used to display data from another worksheet or workbook.
However, instead of searching for the lookup value vertically down the first column of the table array range, the HLOOKUP function searches horizontally across the first row of the table array range.
When the function finds a match for the lookup value, it will display the contents in a cell location based on a row index number.
This number designates how many rows below the first row of the table array range the function should display.
Table 3.11 "Arguments for the HLOOKUP Function" provides a definition for each argument of the HLOOKUP function.
It is best to review the definitions of these arguments carefully before using the function.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 271 Table 3.11 Arguments for the HLOOKUP Function Argument Definition This argument is typically defined with a cell location, number, or text.
Text data must be enclosed in quotation marks for this argument.
The function will search for the criteria entered into this argument in the first row of the range used to define theTable_array argument.
For example, if the word Hat is used to define this argument, the function will search for the word Hat in the first row of the range used to define Lookup_value the Table_arrayargument.
Range of cells that contain data you wish the HLOOKUP function to search though (Lookup_value) and display.
This cell range mustcontain the criteria used to define the Lookup_value in the first row.
For example, if the range A2:D15 is used to define this Table_array argument, the criteria used to define the Lookup_valueargument must exist in Row 2.
This is the row index number argument.
It is defined with the number of rows below the first row in the range used to define the Table_array argument that contains the data you wish to display.
For example, suppose the data you wish the function to display is contained in Row 5.
If the range used to define theTable_array argument is A2:D15, then the column index number will be 4.
Counting the rows below the first row in this range, Row 2 would be 1, Row 3 would be 2, Row 4 would be 3, and Row 5 would be 4.
It is Row_index_num important to remember to count the first row in the table array range as 1.
This argument is defined with either the word TRUE or the wordFALSE.
When this argument is defined with the word FALSE, the function will look for an exact match to the criteria used to define the Lookup_value argument in the first row of the table array range.
It is important to note the function will search the entire range to find a match.
If this argument is defined with the wordTRUE, the function will look for a value that is an exact match or the closest match that is less than the lookup value.
For example, if the lookup value is 80 and the highest value in the first row of the table array range is a 78, the function will consider 78 a match for the number 80.
However, if the lookup value is 80 and the lowest number in the first row of the table array range is 85, the function will produce an error.
This is because the number 80 and any value less than 80 do not exist in the first row of the table array range.
It is important to note that if you define this argument with the word TRUE, the data in the table array range must be sorted based on the values in the first row in ascending order from left to right.
This is because the function will stop searching for a match once the value in the first row exceeds the lookup value.
If the data in the table array range is not sorted, the function can either produce an error code or display an erroneous result.
This argument is in brackets because if it is not defined it will [Range_lookup] automatically be defined with the word TRUE.
The HLOOKUP function will be used on the Portfolio Summary worksheet to display the benchmark growth rates in the range G4:G7.
A benchmark is a value that can be used as a standard point of comparison.
The Benchmarks worksheet contains growth rates at different year intervals for the benchmarks that will be used to compare the performance for each investment type (seeFigure 3.45 "Benchmarks Worksheet").
For the purposes of this workbook, we will be comparing the growth rates for each investment type to the 5-year average growth rate for the benchmarks categories listed in the range Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 272 H4:H7.
The following steps explain how to construct the HLOOKUP function to display the 5-year benchmark values in the Portfolio Summary worksheet: Figure 3.45 Benchmarks Worksheet 1.
Click cell G4 in the Portfolio Summary worksheet.
2.
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Lookup & Reference button in the Function Library group of commands.
4.
Select the HLOOKUP function from the list of functions.
This will open the Function Arguments dialog box for the HLOOKUP function.
5.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Lookup_value argument on the Function Arguments dialog box.
6.
Click cell H4 and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The description in cell H4 will be the lookup value that will be searched in the first row of the range defined for the Table_array argument.
7.
Click the Collapse Dialog button next to the Table_array argument on the Function Arguments dialog box.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 273 8.
Click the Benchmarks worksheet tab.
9.
Highlight the range B2:E6 on the Benchmarks worksheet and press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
The function will look in Row 2 of this range for the lookup value.
10.
Click in the input box for the Table_array argument and place an absolute reference on the range B2:E6.
This is done by typing a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of each cell location in the range.
11.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the Row_index_num argument and type the number 4.
Once the function finds the lookup value in Row 2 of the range B2:E6, it will display the value that is in Row 5 of the same column.
Remember that Row 2 is counted as Row 1 for the row index number in this example.
12.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the Range_lookup argument on the Function Arguments dialog box and type the word FALSE.
This will direct the function to search for only exact matches of the lookup value.
13.
Click the OK button at the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box.
14.
Copy the HLOOKUP function in cell G4 and paste it into the range G5:G7 using the Paste Formulas command.
Figure 3.46 "Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the HLOOKUP Function" shows the completed Function Arguments dialog box for the HLOOKUP function.
The row index number 4 indicates that the function will display the contents of the cell location in the fourth row of the table array range.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 274 Figure 3.46 Completed Function Arguments Dialog Box for the HLOOKUP Function Figure 3.47 "Completed Portfolio Summary Worksheet" shows the output of the HLOOKUP function.
Notice that the output of the function in cell G4 is 6.0%.
This is because the lookup value was defined with the entry in cell H4, which is the Barclays index.
Looking at Figure 3.45 "Benchmarks Worksheet", if you count the first row of the table array range as Row 1, the value 6.03% is the fourth row in the Barclays column.
Since the values in Column G on the Portfolio Summary worksheet are set to 1 decimal place, the value is displayed as 6.0%.
Figure 3.47 Completed Portfolio Summary Worksheet Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 275 Integrity Check #N/A and #REF!
Errors with Lookup Functions If you receive the #N/A error code when using the VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP function, it indicates that Excel cannot find the lookup value in the table array range.
Check that the lookup value exists in the first column for the VLOOKUP, or the first row for the HLOOKUP, in the range used to define the Table_array argument.
You may also see this error code if you copy and paste the function and forget to put an absolute reference on the range used to define the Table_array argument.
The #REF!
error code indicates that the column index number or row index number exceeds the number of columns or rows in the range used to define the Table_array argument.

EXERCISES Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 283 1.
Which of the following is true with respect to the range of cells used to define the Table_array argument when using the VLOOKUP function?
a.
The lookup value must exist in the first row of this range.
b.
The lookup value must exist in the first column of this range.
c. This range must be sorted in ascending order if the Range_lookup argument is defined with the word FALSE.
d. The range used to define the Table_array argument is the lookup value.
1.
Assume that the range B3:E23 is used to define the Table_array argument for an HLOOKUP function.
How should the Row_index_num argument be defined if the output of the function should be the contents of the cell location in Row 15 in the same column as the lookup value?
a. with the number 15 b. with the range B3:B15 c. with cell location B15 d. with the number 13 1.
Column A contains values that will be used to define the Lookup_value argument of a VLOOKUP function.
The function will search for an exact match to the lookup value in the range A2:D15 in the Description List worksheet.
The output of the function should be the contents in the cell location in Column C of the same row as the lookup value.
Once the function is created, it will be copied and pasted to other cell locations in the same column.

Careers in Practice (Skills Review) Retail Inventory Analyst (Comprehensive Review Part A) Starter File: Chapter 3 CiP Exercise 1 Difficulty: Level 1 Easy The challenge of pursuing any position in a retail career is analyzing large volumes of data to measure the financial performance of the business.
Large retail corporations may service thousands of customers in hundreds of stores every day.
This creates an enormous amount of sales data that is typically stored in large database systems.
A retail analyst is typically asked to make sense of all this data and develop reports for other managers in the company.
In fact, a retail analyst is often asked to prepare sales reports for the most senior executives in a retail corporation.
The skills covered in this chapter are extremely valuable in helping a retail analyst summarize large volumes of data that allow other managers to understand the financial performance of the company and make critical decisions every day.
In this exercise, you will create a sales report similar to one that is commonly used in a retail career.
This part of the exercise utilizes the IF function to analyze the sales and inventory data by store.
The information created from this analysis can be shared with a manager in the shipping department.

Figure 3.57Completed CiP Exercise 2 Payroll Details Worksheet (Columns G–O) Figure 3.58Completed CiP Exercise 2 Payroll Summary Worksheet Integrity Check Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 299 Starter File: Chapter 3 IC Exercise 3 Difficulty: Level 3 Difficult The purpose of this exercise is to analyze a worksheet to determine whether there are any integrity flaws.
Read the scenario that follows and then open the Excel workbook related to this exercise.
You will find a worksheet in the workbook named AnswerSheet.
This worksheet is to be used for any written responses required for this exercise.
Scenario You recently became the inventory director for a medium-size apparel retail company.
The company relies on you to keep a very close watch on the inventory levels for all the items the company sells.
Any apparel inventory that is left unsold after the current season will have to be sold at a significant discount.
Large excess amounts of inventory can result in drastic profit losses for the company.
The company analyzes inventory based on a sell-through rate, which is the weekly unit sales divided by the current inventory units.
A sell-through percentage between 12% and 15% is considered normal.
At this rate the company will sell all inventory for an item in 6 to 8 weeks.
However, a sell-through rate that is outside of this range will require immediate action.
An analyst has e-mailed you an inventory status report based on the company’s inventory management guidelines.
He explains the following in his e-mail:  The Status column of the inventory contains a function I put together that tells us where we have issues.
The company suggests that we put a “rush priority” on any inventory orders for more than 100 units in a week and for which the sell-through rate is greater than or equal to 20%.
 If the sell-through rate for any item is less than 10%, we have to work with the buyers to see if any incoming orders can be cancelled.
The function I created indicates any slow-selling items with a “cancel warning” description.
 Overall, it looks like our biggest problem is that we don’t have enough inventory.
In fact, most of the items on the report are showing a “rush priority.” I guess this is a good problem to have.
Assignment Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 300 1.
Look at the Status column (Column E) for the first few items on the inventory report.
Does the output of the function created by the analyst make sense given the company’s guidelines for managing inventory?
Document your observation in the AnswerSheet worksheet.
2.
Evaluate the construction of the IF function in the Status column for the first item.
Does the function accurately evaluate the Sell Through percentages in Column D?
Document your observation in the AnswerSheet worksheet.
3.
The company suggests that a rush priority be placed on any orders if the unit sales for an item are greater than 100 and the sell-through rate is greater than or equal to 20%.
Does the IF function in the Status column accurately account for this condition?
Document your observation in the AnswerSheet worksheet.
4.
Enter a new IF function in the Status column to accurately assess the inventory for each item based on the company’s inventory policies.
Make any other adjustments to the worksheet so that it is easy to see all items that require “Rush Priorities” as well “Cancel Warnings.” Applying Excel Skills Keeping a Stock Portfolio Current with Web Queries Starter File: Chapter 3 AES Assignment 1 Difficulty: Level 3 Difficult The purpose of this exercise is to create a worksheet that tracks a small stock portfolio by utilizing web queries to bring in current price data from the web.

A Second Look at Federal Income Taxes Starter File: Chapter 3 AES Assignment 2 Difficulty: Level 3 Difficult The purpose of this assignment is to revisit the federal payroll tax calculations that were demonstrated in the Careers in Practice: Payroll for a Medical Group exercise.
In that exercise, we assumed that if the employee’s weekly income was less than or equal to $1,150, the federal tax was estimated at 20%.
For any income over $1,150, the federal tax was estimated at 25%.
However, the IRS publishes tables that provide more details as to how federal taxes should be calculated and withheld for weekly payrolls.
The Excel workbook for this assignment contains two worksheets.
ThePayroll Details worksheet is a subset of the data that was used for the Careers in Practice exercise.
The Withholding Table worksheet contains part of an Excel worksheet that was published by the IRS.
There are six levels of weekly income in Columns A and B of the worksheet.
Columns C and D provide information for calculating the amount of federal tax that should be withheld.
For example, if an employee’s weekly salary is $200, you would use Row 3 to calculate the amount of federal tax that should be withheld.
This means you would first subtract the value in cell C3 from the weekly salary, which is: 200 − 111.15 = 88.85.
Then the result of 88.85 is multiplied by the percentage in cell D3, which is: 88.85 × .10 = 8.885.
Therefore, the federal tax that should be withheld for an employee who is paid $200 a week is $8.885.
Expressed as a formula, the calculation would be as follows: (200 − 111.15) × .10.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 302 Your assignment is to complete the Federal Tax calculations in Column F of the Payroll Details worksheet.
You are required to reference the data in the Withholding Table worksheet such that if the tax rates change in the future (a very common occurrence), your federal tax calculations will automatically be updated.
Hint: You will need to use the VLOOKUP function twice in your formula.
Follow the example calculation carefully and manually check the output of your formula to determine whether you are producing an accurate result.
The Smart Grade Book Starter File: Chapter 3 AES Assignment 3 Difficulty: Level 3 Difficult The Excel workbook for this assignment contains a partially completed grade book for a typical college- level course.
The Grade Detailsworksheet contains a list of hypothetical students who were enrolled in the course as well as the grades they received for each course requirement.
Column H contains a formula that calculates the final grade for each student.
Table 3.12 "Final Grade Calculation" shows information that was included in the course syllabus that shows students how their final grades will be calculated.
Table 3.12 Final Grade Calculation Requirement Percent of Final Grade Paper 1 10 Paper 2 10 Class Participation 15 Quizzes 10 Midterm Exam 20 Final Exam 35 Special Note A final grade below a 70 will require that this course be repeated for credit.
The Excel skills demonstrated in this chapter can be used to create a dynamic and “smart” grade book for any academic course.
Your assignment is to complete the grade book using several of the Excel skills that you have learned so far.
Open the Excel workbook for this assignment and complete the grade book based on the following requirements: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 303 1.
It is very important to make sure a student’s grade is accurately calculated.
One area that must be checked often when calculating final grades is the percentages assigned to each requirement in the course.
One way to do this is to see if the percentages add up to 100%.
Use an IF function in the merged cells H2 and I2 on the Grade Detailsworksheet to determine if the percentages in the range B2:G2 add up to 100%.
If the percentages do not add up to 100%, show the phrase “Percentages do not equal 100%.” Otherwise, leave the cell blank (use two quotation marks: “”).
Use the results of your IF function to make any necessary adjustments to the grade book (refer to Table 3.12 "Final Grade Calculation" as needed).
2.
Calculate class averages in Row 29 for each course requirement as well as the final grades in Columns B through H. 3.
Use a VLOOKUP function to display the appropriate letter grade for each student in Column I.
The Grade Table worksheet contains data that show how the letter grades should be assigned for the numeric grades.
4.
Complete the Class Grade Distribution in the range I32:I43 on theGrade Details worksheet.
The purpose of this area is to show how many students received the grades listed in the range H32:H43.
For example, how many students receive an A, A−, and so on.
Include a percent of total for each grade.
Hint: This can be accomplished using the COUNTIF function if you successfully complete the VLOOKUP function in step 3.
If you are unable to complete step 3, you can still complete this step using the COUNTIFS function.
5.
Add any formatting enhancements to the Grade Details worksheet that would make the worksheet easier to read and use.
Consider the “Special Note” in Table 3.12 "Final Grade Calculation".

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 307 Chapter 4 Presenting Data with Charts Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills" provided a brief introduction to creating charts in Excel.
This chapter provides more details for enhancing the appearance of your charts and addresses how to choose the best chart type for your data.
One of the most important things to consider when using charts in Excel is that they are intended to be used for communicating an idea to an audience.
Your audience can be reading your charts in a written document or listening to you in a live presentation.
In fact, Excel charts are often imported or pasted into Word documents or PowerPoint slides, which serve this very purpose of communicating ideas to an audience.
Although there are no rules set in stone for using specific charts for certain data types, some chart types are designed to communicate certain messages better than others.
This chapter explores numerous charts that can be used for a variety of purposes.
In addition, we will examine formatting charts and using those charts in Word and PowerPoint documents.

This section reviews the most commonly used Excel chart types.
To demonstrate the variety of chart types available in Excel, it is necessary to use a variety of data sets.
Therefore, instead of addressing a specific theme, we will use a variety of themes.
This is necessary not only to demonstrate the construction of charts but also to explain how to choose the right type of chart given your data and the idea you intend to communicate.
Before we begin, let’s review a few key points you need to consider before creating any chart in Excel.
The first is identifying your idea or message.
It is important to keep in mind that the primary purpose of a chart is to present quantitative information to an audience.
Therefore, you must first decide what message or idea you wish to present.
This is critical in helping you select specific data from a worksheet that will be used in a chart.
Throughout this chapter, we will reinforce the intended message first before creating each chart.
The second key point is selecting the right chart type.
The chart type you select will depend on the data you have and the message you intend to communicate.
The third key point is identifying the values that should appear on the X and Y axes.
One of the ways to identify which values belong on the X and Y axes is to sketch the chart on paper first.
If you can visualize what your chart is supposed to look like, you will have an easier time using Excel to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 309 construct an effective chart that accurately communicates your message.
Table 4.1 "Key Steps before Constructing an Excel Chart" provides a brief summary of these points.
Integrity Check Carefully Select Data When Creating a Chart Just because you have data in a worksheet does not mean it must all be placed onto a chart.
When creating a chart, it is common for only specific data points to be used.
To determine what data should be used when creating a chart, you must first identify the message or idea that you want to communicate to an audience.

Time Series Trend: Line Chart 1 Follow-along file: Excel Objective 4.00 The first chart we will demonstrate is a line chart.
Figure 4.1 "52 Week Data for the S&P 500 and Microsoft" shows part of the data that will be used to create two line charts.
The first line chart will show the trend of the S&P 500 stock index.
This is an aggregate price index of five hundred of the largest publicly traded companies.
This chart will be used to communicate a simple message: to show how the index has performed over a fifty-two-week period.
We can use this chart in a presentation to show Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 310 whether stock prices have been increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over the designated period of time.
Figure 4.1 52 Week Data for the S&P 500 and Microsoft Before we create the line chart, it is important to identify why it is an appropriate chart type given the message we wish to communicate and the data we have.
When presenting the trend for any data over a designated period of time, the most commonly used chart types are the line chart and the column chart.
With the column chart, you are limited to a certain number of bars or data points.
As you increase the number of bars on a column chart, it becomes increasingly difficult to read.
As you scroll through the data on the worksheet shown in Figure 4.1 "52 Week Data for the S&P 500 and Microsoft", you will see that there are fifty-two points of data used to construct the chart.
This is generally too many data points to put on a column chart, which is why we are using a line chart.
Our line chart will show the closing price for the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 311 S&P 500 on the Y axis and the week number on the X axis.
The following steps explain how to construct this chart: 1.
Highlight the range A3:B55 on the Stock Trend worksheet.
2.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Line button in the Charts group of commands (see Figure 4.2 "Selecting the Basic Line Chart").
4.
Click the first option from the list, which is a basic line chart (see Figure 4.2 "Selecting the Basic Line Chart").
This adds, or embeds, the line chart to the worksheet, as shown in Figure 4.3 "Embedded Line Chart in the Stock Trend Worksheet".
Figure 4.2 Selecting the Basic Line Chart Why?
Line Chart vs.
Column Chart Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 312 We can use both a line chart and a column chart to illustrate a trend over time.
However, a line chart is far more effective when there are many periods of time being measured.
For example, if we are measuring fifty-two weeks, a column chart would require fifty-two bars.
A general rule of thumb is to use a column chart when twenty bars or less are required.
A column chart becomes difficult to read as the number of bars exceeds twenty.
Figure 4.3 "Embedded Line Chart in the Stock Trend Worksheet" shows the embedded line chart in the Stock Trend worksheet.
Notice that three additional tabs, or contextual tabs, are added to the Ribbon.
We will demonstrate the commands in these tabs throughout this chapter.
These tabs appear only when the chart is activated.
Figure 4.3 Embedded Line Chart in the Stock Trend Worksheet As shown in Figure 4.3 "Embedded Line Chart in the Stock Trend Worksheet", the embedded chart is not placed in an ideal location on the worksheet since it is covering several cell locations that contain data.
The following steps demonstrate common adjustments that are made when working with embedded charts: Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 313 1.
Moving a chart: Click and drag the upper left corner of the chart to the center of cell H2.
2.
Resizing a chart: Place the mouse pointer over the left middle sizing handle, hold down the ALT key on your keyboard, and click and drag the chart so it “snaps” to the left side of Column H. 3.
Repeat step 2 to resize the chart so the top “snaps” to the top of Row 2, the bottom “snaps” to the bottom of Row 17, and the right side “snaps” to the right side of Column P. 4.
Adjusting the chart title: Click the chart title once.
Then click in front of the letter S. You should see a blinking cursor in front of the letter S. This allows you to modify the title of the chart.
5.
Type the following in front of the letter S in the chart title: 52 Week Trend for the.
6.
Removing the legend: Click the legend once and press the DELETE key on your keyboard.
This removes the legend from the chart.
Since the chart contains only one data series, the legend is not necessary.
Once you remove the legend, the plot area automatically expands.
Figure 4.4 "Line Chart Moved and Resized" shows the line chart after it is moved and resized.
You can also see that the title of the chart has been edited to read52 Week Trend for the S&P 500.
Also notice that the sizing handles do not appear around the perimeter of the chart.
This is because the chart has been deactivated.
To activate the chart, click anywhere inside the chart perimeter.
Figure 4.4 Line Chart Moved and Resized Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 314 Integrity Check The X Axes on Line Charts Use Labels, Not Values When using line charts in Excel, keep in mind that anything placed on the X axis is considered a descriptive label, not a numeric value.
This is important because there will never be a change in the spacing of any items placed on the X axis of a line chart.
If you need to create a line chart using numeric data on the X axis, you must use a scatter chart type.
Skill Refresher: Inserting a Line Chart 1.
Highlight a range of cells that contain data that will be used to create the chart.
2.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Line button in the Charts group.
4.
Select a format option from the Line Chart drop-down menu.
Adjusting the Y Axis Scale Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.01 if starting here.)
After creating an Excel chart, you may find it necessary to adjust the scale of the Y axis.
Excel automatically sets the maximum value for the Y axis based on the data used to create the chart.
However, the minimum value is usually set to zero.
Depending on the data you are using to create the chart, setting the minimum value to zero can substantially minimize the graphical presentation of a trend.
For example, the trend shown in Figure 4.4 "Line Chart Moved and Resized" appears to be increasing slightly.
However, the S&P 500 increased by over 20% during this period, which is substantial.
The presentation of this trend can be improved if the minimum value started at eight hundred.
While it is certainly possible for the S&P 500 to fall below eight hundred, it is most likely remote.
The following steps explain how to make this adjustment to the Y axis: 1.
Click anywhere on the Y axis on the 52 Week Trend for the S&P 500 line chart (Stock Trend worksheet).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 315 2.
Click the Format tab in the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Format Selection button in the Current Selection group of commands (see Figure 4.5 "Format Axis Dialog Box").
This opens the Format Axis dialog box.
Figure 4.5 Format Axis Dialog Box 4.
Click the Fixed option next to the “Minimum” axis option in the Format Axis dialog box.
5.
Click the input box for the “Minimum” axis option and delete the zero.
Then type the number 800.
As soon as you make this change, the Y axis on the chart adjusts.
6.
Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Axis dialog box.
Figure 4.6 "Adjusted Y Axis for the S&P 500 Chart" shows the change in the presentation of the trendline.
Notice that with the Y axis starting at 800, the trend for the S&P 500 is more pronounced and reflects the substantial increase over the 52-week period.
This adjustment makes it easier for the audience to see the magnitude of the trend.

2.
Click the Format tab in the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Format Selection button in the Current Selection group of commands.
4.
In the Format Axis dialog box, click the Fixed option next to any axis option where you wish to change the value.
5.
Click in the input box next to the desired axis option and then type the new scale value.
6.
Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Axis dialog box.
Trend Comparisons: Line Chart 2 Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.02 if starting here.)
We will now create a second line chart using the data in the Stock Trendworksheet.
The purpose of this chart is to compare two trends: the change in value for the S&P 500 and the Microsoft common stock.
Chapter 3 "Logical and Lookup Functions" presented a personal investment portfolio where the investments were compared to a benchmark.
The S&P 500 is a benchmark that is commonly used to judge Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 318 the performance of individual stocks.
The purpose and message of this chart is to show whether Microsoft is performing better or worse than the S&P 500 index.
This type of analysis can be used to determine whether a stock should be sold, purchased, or held.
Before creating the chart to compare the S&P 500 and Microsoft, it is important to review the data in the range E4:F55 on the Stock Trend worksheet.
We cannot use the price data for Microsoft and the S&P 500 because the values are not comparable.
That is, the data for Microsoft is in a range of $22.00 to $28.00, but the data for the S&P 500 is in a range of 1,022 to 1,363.
If we used these values to create a chart, we would not be able to see any substantial change in the trend for either the S&P 500 or Microsoft.
Therefore, formulas were used to calculate the percent change in value for the S&P 500 and Microsoft for each week.
For example, looking at cells E5 and F5 on the Stock Trend worksheet, you see that the S&P 500 increased 2.4% in week 2, whereas Microsoft increased 3.1%.
The percent change calculations now provide an appropriate method of comparison.
This is a very important step to consider when comparing trends.
The construction of this second line chart will be similar to the first line chart.
The X axis will be the 52 weeks in the range A4:A55.
However, the Y axis will be the percentages in the range E4:F55.
This creates a problem because Columns B, C, and D will not be used in this chart.
Therefore, we cannot simply highlight one contiguous range of cells to create the chart.
In this chapter we will demonstrate two options for charting data that is not in a contiguous range.
The following steps demonstrate the first option: 1.
Highlight the range A3:A55 on the Stock Trend worksheet.
2.
Hold down the CTRL key on your keyboard and highlight the range E3:F55.
3.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
4.
Click the Line button in the Charts group of commands.
5.
Click the first option from the list, which is a basic line chart.
Figure 4.7 "Trend Comparison Line Chart" shows the appearance of the line chart comparing the S&P 500 and Microsoft before it is moved and resized.
Notice that Excel does not add a title to the chart.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 319 Figure 4.7 Trend Comparison Line Chart 6.
Move the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H20.
7.
Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column H, the right side is locked to the right side of Column P, the top is locked to the top of Row 20, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 35.
8.
Click the Layout tab in the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
9.
Click the Chart Title button in the Labels group of commands.
Select the Above Chart option from the drop-down list (see Figure 4.8 "Adding a Title to a Chart").
This adds a generic title above the plot area of the chart.
10.
Click in the text box containing the chart title.
Delete the generic chart title and replace it with the following: 52 Week Trend Comparison.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 320 Figure 4.8 Adding a Title to a Chart Figure 4.9 "Final Trend Comparison Line Chart" shows that Microsoft has not performed as well as the S&P 500 benchmark.
From week 31 to week 52, Microsoft is showing a significant decline compared to the S&P 500, which continues to grow.
What makes this chart effective is that an audience can quickly see how Microsoft compares with the S&P 500 over the 52-week period.
Figure 4.9 Final Trend Comparison Line Chart Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 321 Integrity Check Comparing Trends with Incompatible Values When creating a chart to compare the trends of two or more data series, the values for each data series must be compatible.
In other words, the values for each data series must be within a reasonable range in order for an effective comparison to be made.
If the variance between the values in your data series is never less than a multiple of 2 (i.e., 500 × 2 = 1000 or 1000 ÷ 2 = 500), calculate the percent change for each point in time on your worksheet.
The percent change must be calculated with respect to the first data point for each series.
Then create your chart using the percentages instead of the actual values for each data series.
Frequency Distribution: Column Chart 1 Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.03 if starting here.)
A column chart is commonly used to show trends over time so long as the data are limited to approximately twenty points or less.
For example, in Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills" we showed a sales trend over a twelve-month period.
Another common use for column charts is frequency distributions.
Afrequency distribution shows the number of occurrences by established categories.
For example, a common frequency distribution used in most academic institutions is a grade distribution.
A grade distribution shows the number of students that achieve each level of a typical grading scale (A, A−, B+, B, etc.).
The Grade Distribution worksheet contains final grades for a hypothetical academic class.
To show the grade frequency distribution, the numbers of students appear on the Y axis and the grade categories appear on the X axis.
The following steps explain how to create this chart: 1.
Highlight the range A3:B8 on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
Column B shows the number of students that achieved a grade within the grade category shown in Column A.
2.
Click the Column button in the Charts group section on the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
Select the first format from the drop-down list of options, which is the Clustered Column format.
3.
Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H2.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 322 4.
Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column H, the right side is locked to the right side of Column P, the top is locked to the top of Row 2, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 16.
5.
Click the legend one time and press the DELETE key on your keyboard.
Since the chart presents only one data series, the legend is not necessary.
6.
Click the title of the chart twice so the cursor is placed in front of the word Class.
7.
Type the following in front of the word Class: Final Grades for the.
8.
Click any cell location on the Grade Distribution worksheet to deactivate the chart.
Figure 4.10 "Grade Frequency Distribution Chart" shows the completed grade frequency distribution chart.
By looking at the chart, you can immediately see that the greatest number of students earned a final grade in the B+ to B− or theC+ to C− categories.
Figure 4.10 Grade Frequency Distribution Chart Why?
Column Chart vs. Bar Chart Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 323 When using charts to show frequency distributions, the difference between a column chart and a bar chart is really a matter of preference.
Both are very effective in showing frequency distributions.
However, if you are showing a trend over a period of time, a column chart is preferred over a bar chart.
This is because a period of time is typically shown horizontally, with the oldest date on the far left and the newest date on the far right.
Therefore, the descriptive categories for the chart would have to fall on the X axis, which is the configuration of a column chart.
On a bar chart, the descriptive categories are displayed vertically along the Y axis.
Creating a Chart Sheet Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.04 if starting here.)
The charts we have created up to this point have been added to, or embedded in, an existing worksheet.
Charts can also be placed in a dedicated worksheet called a chart sheet.
It is called a chart sheet because it can contain only an Excel chart.
Chart sheets are useful if you need to create several charts using the data in a single worksheet.
If you embed several charts in one worksheet, it can be cumbersome to navigate and browse through the charts.
It is easier to browse through charts when they are moved to a chart sheet because a separate sheet tab is added to the workbook for each chart.
The following steps explain how to move the grade frequency distribution chart to a dedicated chart sheet: 1.
Click anywhere on the Final Grades for the Class chart on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
2.
Click the Move Chart button in the Design tab of the Chart Tools set of commands.
This opens the Move Chart dialog box.
You can use this dialog box to move the chart to a different worksheet or create a dedicated chart sheet.
3.
Click the New sheet option on the Move Chart dialog box.
4.
The entry in the input box for assigning a name to the chart sheet tab should automatically be highlighted once you click the New sheet option (see Figure 4.11 "Moving a Chart to a Chart Sheet").
Type Class Grades.
This replaces the generic name in the input box.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 324 5.
Click the OK button at the bottom of the Move Chart dialog box.
This adds a new chart sheet to the workbook with the name Class Grades.
Figure 4.11 Moving a Chart to a Chart Sheet Figure 4.12 "Chart Sheet Added to the Workbook" shows the Final Grades for the Class column chart in a separate chart sheet.
Notice the new sheet tab added to the workbook matches the tab name entered into the Move Chart dialog box.
Since the chart is moved to a separate chart sheet, it no longer is displayed in the Grade Distribution worksheet.
Figure 4.12 Chart Sheet Added to the Workbook Frequency Comparison: Column Chart 2 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 325 Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.05 if starting here.)
We will create a second column chart to show a comparison between two frequency distributions.
Column C on the Grade Distribution worksheet contains data showing the number of students who received grades within each category for the entire college.
We will use a column chart to compare the grade distribution for the class (Column B) with the overall grade distribution for the college (Column C).
However, since the number of students in the class is significantly different from the total number of students in the college, we must calculate percentages in order to make an effective comparison.
The following steps explain how to calculate the percentages: 1.
Highlight the range B9:C9 on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
2.
Click the AutoSum button in the Editing group of commands on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
This automatically adds SUM functions that sum the values in the range B4:B8 and C4:C8.
3.
Activate cell E4 on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
4.
Enter a formula that divides the value in cell B4 by the total in cell B9.
Add an absolute reference to cell B9 in the formula =B4/$B$9.
5.
Copy the formula in cell E4 and paste it into the range E5:E8 using the Paste Formulas command.
6.
Activate cell F4 on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
7.
Enter a formula that divides the value in cell C4 by the total in cell C9.
Add an absolute reference to cell C9 in the formula =C4/$C$9.
8.
Copy the formula in cell F4 and paste it into the range F5:F8 using the Paste Formulas command.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 326 Figure 4.13 Completed Grade Distribution Percentages Figure 4.13 "Completed Grade Distribution Percentages" shows the completed percentages added to the Grade Distribution worksheet.
The column chart uses the grade categories in the range A4:A8 on the X axis and the percentages in the range E4:F8 on the Y axis.
Similar to the trend comparison line chart, this chart uses data that is not in a contiguous range.
The following steps explain a second method for creating charts with data that is not in a contiguous range: 1.
Activate cell H2 on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
It is important to note that this is a blank cell that is not adjacent to any data on the worksheet.
2.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Column button in the Charts group of commands.
Select the first option from the drop-down list of chart formats, which is the Clustered Column.
This adds a blank chart to the worksheet.
4.
Click and drag the blank chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H2.
5.
Resize the blank chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column H, the right side is locked to the right side of Column P, the top is locked to the top of Row 2, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 16.

Figure 4.16 "Completed Grade Distribution Column Chart" shows the final appearance of the column chart.
The column chart is an appropriate type for this data because there are fewer than twenty data points and we can easily see the comparison for each category.
An audience can quickly see that the class issued fewer As compared to the college.
However, the class had more Bs and Cs compared with the college population.
Figure 4.16 Completed Grade Distribution Column Chart Integrity Check Too Many Bars on a Column Chart?
Although there is no specific limit for the number of bars you should use on a column chart, a general rule of thumb is twenty bars or less.
Figure 4.17 "Poor Use of a Column Chart" contains a total of thirty-two bars.
This is considered a poor use of a column chart because it is difficult to identify meaningful trends or Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 330 comparisons.

Percent of Total: Pie Chart Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.06 if starting here.)
The next chart we will demonstrate is a pie chart.
A pie chart is used to show a percent of total for a data set at a specific point in time.
The data we will use to demonstrate a pie chart is related to the overall spending activity in the health-care industry.
The Health Care worksheet contains data that shows total spending in the United States for the years 1969 and 2009.
In 1969, the total amount spent in the United States for health-related expenses was over $66 billion.
The pie chart shows how this $66 billion was funded.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Highlight the range A2:B7 on the Health Care worksheet.
2.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Pie button in the Charts group of commands.
4.
Select the “Exploded pie in 3-D” option from the drop-down list of options.
5.
Click and drag the pie chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell E2.
6.
Resize the pie chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column E, the right side is locked to the right side of Column M, the top is locked to the top of Row 2, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 17 (see Figure 4.18 "Pie Chart Moved and Resized").
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 332 Figure 4.18 Pie Chart Moved and Resized 7.
Click the chart legend once and press the DELETE key on your keyboard.
A pie chart typically shows labels next to each wedge.
Therefore, the legend is not needed.
8.
Click the Data Labels button in the Layout tab of the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
9.
Select More Data Label Options from the drop-down list.
This opens the Format Data Labels dialog box.

Click the chart title twice.
16.
Click in front of the year 1969 and type Health Care Spending by Source:.
Figure 4.20 "Final Health Care Pie Chart" shows the completed pie chart.
You can quickly see that Health Insurance and Out of Pocket made up the majority of health-care spending in 1969.
Similar to the column chart, the key to creating an effective pie chart is the number of categories presented on the chart.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 334 Although there are no specific limits for the number of categories you can use on a pie chart, a good rule of thumb is ten or less.
As the number of categories exceeds ten, it becomes more difficult to identify key categories that make up the majority of the total.
In this example, it is easy to see that two categories compose 75% of the total.

Percent of Total Trend: Stacked Column Chart Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.07 if starting here.)
The last chart type we will demonstrate is the stacked column chart.
We use a stacked column chart to show how a percent of total changes over time.
For example, the data on the Health Care worksheet shows spending by source for 1969 and 2009.
A stacked column chart can show whether there is any change in the percent of total for each source between the two years.
The Y axis of the chart shows the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 335 percentage from 0% to 100%.
The X axis shows the two years: 1969 and 2009.
The following steps explain how to create this chart: 1.
Highlight the range A2:C7 on the Health Care worksheet.
2.
Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
3.
Click the Column button in the Charts group of commands.
Select the 100% Stacked Column format option from the drop-down list (see Figure 4.21 "Selecting the 100% Stacked Column Format").
Figure 4.21 Selecting the 100% Stacked Column Format Figure 4.22 "Initial Construction of the 100% Stacked Column Chart" shows the column chart that is created after selecting the 100% Stacked Column format option.
As mentioned, the goal of this chart is to Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 336 show the percentages on the Y axis and the years 1969 and 2009 on the X axis.
However, notice that Excel places the spend sources on the X axis.
The remaining steps explain how to correct this problem and complete the chart: Figure 4.22 Initial Construction of the 100% Stacked Column Chart 4.
Click the Switch Row/Column button in the Design tab on the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
This reverses the legend and current X axis categories (see Figure 4.22 "Initial Construction of the 100% Stacked Column Chart").

11.
Select the Above Chart option for the drop-down menu.
12.
Click the chart title two times.
Delete the generic chart title name and typeChange in Health Care Spend Source.
Figure 4.23 "Final 100% Stacked Column Chart" shows the final stacked column chart.
Notice that the Out of Pocket category, or the amount of cash people paid for health-care expenses, decreased significantly from 1969 to 2009.
However, the Health Insurance category increased significantly from 1969 to 2009.
Overall, the chart shows that the total out-of-pocket and health insurance expense increased significantly from 1969 to 2009.
These two categories made up approximately 75% of total health-care spending in 1969.
By 2009, these two categories increased to over 80% of total health-care spending.

KEY TAKEAWAYS  Identifying the message you wish to convey to an audience is a critical first step in creating an Excel chart.
 Both a column chart and a line chart can be used to present a trend over a period of time.
However, a line chart is preferred over a column chart when presenting data over long periods of time.
 The number of bars on a column chart should be limited to approximately twenty bars or less.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 339  For column, line, and bar charts, the X axis can be used only for labels, not for numeric values.
 When creating a chart to compare trends, the values for each data series must be within a reasonable range.
If there is a wide variance between the values in the two data series (two times or more), the percent change should be calculated with respect to the first data point for each series.
 When working with frequency distributions, the use of a column chart or a bar chart is a matter of preference.
However, a column chart is preferred when working with a trend over a period of time.
 A pie chart is used to present the percent of total for a data set.
 A stacked column chart is used to show how a percent total changes over time.

Apply formatting commands to the X and Y axes.
2.
Enhance the visual appearance of the chart title and chart legend by using various formatting techniques.
3.
Assign titles to the X and Y axes that clarify labels and numeric values for the reader.
4.
Apply labels and formatting techniques to the data series in the plot area of a chart.
5.
Apply formatting commands to the chart area and the plot area of a chart.
6.
Employ series lines and annotations to enhance trends and provide additional information on a chart.
You can use a variety of formatting techniques to enhance the appearance of a chart once you have created it.
Formatting commands are applied to a chart for the same reason they are applied to a worksheet: they make the chart easier to read.
However, formatting techniques also help you qualify and explain the data in a chart.
For example, you can add footnotes explaining the data source as well as notes that clarify the type of numbers being presented (i.e., if the numbers in a chart are truncated, you can state whether they are in thousands, millions, etc.).
These notes are also helpful in answering questions if you are using charts in a live presentation.
We will demonstrate these formatting techniques using the column chart and stacked column chart from the previous section.
X and Y Axis Formats Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.08 if starting here.)
There are numerous formatting commands we can apply to the X and Y axes of the chart.
Although adjusting the font size, style, and color are common, many more options are available through the Format Axis dialog box (see Figure 4.5 "Format Axis Dialog Box").
The following steps demonstrate a few of these formatting techniques on the Grade Distribution Comparison chart: 1.

Data Series Labels and Formats Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.11 if starting here.)
Adding labels to the data series of a chart is a key formatting feature.
A data series is the item that is being displayed graphically on a chart.
For example, the blue bars on the Grade Distribution Comparison chart represent one data series.
We can add labels at the end of each bar to show the exact percentage the bar Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 351 represents.
In addition, we can add other formatting enhancements to the data series, such as changing the color of the bars or adding an effect.
The following steps explain how to add these labels and formats to the chart: 1.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 365 4.3 The Scatter Chart LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.
Construct a scatter chart to show the supply and demand curves for a market.
2.
Learn how to adjust the scale of the X and Y axes of a scatter chart.
3.
Add a trendline and line equation to a data series on a scatter chart.
This section focuses on the scatter chart type.
What makes this chart different from the other charts demonstrated in this chapter is that values are used on both the X and Y axes.
So far, the charts we have demonstrated in this chapter use categories or qualitative labels for the X axis.
This means that the distance between each category on the X axis will always be the same, even if numbers are used.
In a scatter chart, the X axis operates just like the Y axis.
In other words, the distance between the values on the X axis will vary depending on the value of the number.
Depending on the format, we can create the scatter chart to look just like a line chart.
Since both the X and Y axes contain quantitative values, the scatter chart is a valuable tool for studying various shapes or functional forms for a line chart.
In fact, a common feature used with the scatter chart is the trendline and equation.
Excel can evaluate the line that is produced on a scatter chart and produce a mathematical equation.
We will demonstrate these features in this section.
Supply and Demand: The Scatter Chart Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.14 if starting here.)
A common use for a scatter chart is the study of supply and demand curves.
This is because the data points for both the supply and demand lines require quantitative values on both the X and Y axes.
The Y axis contains the price of a certain good or item; the X axis contains the quantity sold for that good or item.
Fundamental economic laws state that as prices rise, sellers are willing to increase supply and sell more goods.
However, the reverse is true for consumers.
As prices rise, consumers purchase fewer goods.
The Supply & Demand worksheet contains hypothetical data for the supply and demand of breakfast cereal.
There are ten data points to show the change in supply and demand as the price changes in Column A.
The values you see in Columns A through C are formula outputs that are driven by the Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 366 percentage in cell C14.
For example, if the percentage in cell C14 is changed to 10, each price listed in Column A will increase, as shown in Figure 4.45 "Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data".
Figure 4.45 Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data We will use the scatter chart to study the change in quantity supplied and demanded as the price increases over ten data points, as shown in Figure 4.45 "Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data".
For many of the charts demonstrated in this chapter, we were able to highlight a range of cells and insert the chart type we needed.
This was especially the case when the data was in a contiguous range of cells.
However, this method rarely works when creating a scatter chart, even if the data are in a contiguous range.
As a result, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 367 the method we present here starts with a blank chart and demonstrates how each data series is added to the chart individually.
The following steps explain how we create this chart: 1.
Change the value in cell C14 on the Supply & Demand worksheet to zero.
2.
Activate cell E1 on the Supply & Demand worksheet.
It is important to note that this cell location is not adjacent to any data on the worksheet.
3.
Click the Scatter button from the Charts group of commands on the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
4.
Select the Scatter with Smooth Lines and Markers format from the drop-down list of options (see Figure 4.46 "Selecting a Scatter Chart Format").
This adds a blank chart to the worksheet.

Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the center of cell E2.
6.
Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column E, the right side is locked to the right side of Column M, the top is locked to the top of Row 2, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 17.

Then click the Select Data button in the Data group of commands.
This opens the Select Data Source dialog box.
8.
Click the Add button on the left side of the Select Data Source dialog box.
This opens the Edit Series dialog box.
Notice on this dialog box there are inputs for defining values for both the X and Y axes.
Charts that we previously created using this method only had an input for putting values on the Y axis.
9.
Type the series name Demand.
This should appear in the Series name input box.
10.
Press the TAB key on your keyboard to advance to the Series X values input box on the Edit Series dialog box.

Why?
For Scatter Charts, Start with a Blank Chart When creating a scatter chart, it is best to start with a blank chart and add each data series individually.
This is because Excel will not always guess correctly which values belong on the X and Y axes since both contain numbers.
For other chart types, such as column or line charts, the X axis contains nonnumeric data so it’s easy for Excel to configure the chart you need.
Figure 4.48 "Scatter Chart Showing One Price" shows the appearance of the scatter chart before any formatting enhancements are applied.
Notice only two plot points are located on the chart.
This is because the price change value in cell C14 is still zero.
Therefore, the data are not reflecting any change in price, quantity demanded, or quantity supplied.
The chart shows that at the current price of $1.50, suppliers are willing to provide fewer units compared with the number of units consumers are willing to buy.
Figure 4.48 Scatter Chart Showing One Price The following steps explain the formatting enhancements we will apply to the scatter chart shown in Figure 4.48 "Scatter Chart Showing One Price": Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 371 1.

Change the value one more time to 14.
As you change the values in cell C14, you will see the lines change on the chart.
Figure 4.50 "Scatter Chart with Price Change at 2%" shows the completed scatter chart when the Price Change is set to 2%, and Figure 4.51 "Scatter Chart with Price Change at 14%" shows the same chart when the Price Change is set to 14%.
The point at which the demand and supply lines intersect on Figure 4.51 "Scatter Chart with Price Change at 14%" is known as the market equilibrium point.
The market equilibrium is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a specific price.
The price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied is referred to as the equilibrium price.

Changing the Scale of the X and Y Axes Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.15 if starting here.)
For all the charts demonstrated in this chapter, Excel has automatically established the scale for the Y axis.
For scatter charts, Excel has also established the scale for the X axis.
The axis scale is the minimum and maximum value that appears on an axis.
For example, in Figure 4.51 "Scatter Chart with Price Change at 14%", the Y axis scale is set to a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 6.00.
Although this is a very convenient feature of Excel, you may want to change the scale in some instances.
If you change the value in cell C14 on the Supply & Demand worksheet, the lines jump or shift on the plot area of the chart.
This is because Excel keeps rearranging the scale of both the X and Y axes.
When studying the shape of lines, it is best to set the scale so it does not change.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Change the value in cell C14 on the Supply & Demand worksheet to zero.
2.
Click anywhere on the Y axis of the chart.
3.
Click the Format Selection button in the Layout tab of the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
This opens the Format Axis dialog box.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 375 4.
Click the Fixed option next to the Minimum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.
This ensures that the minimum value for the Y axis will always be zero.
5.
Click the Fixed option next to the Maximum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.
6.
Click in the input box next to the Maximum setting.
Remove the 1.6 and enter the number 5.0.
We will not be studying the behavior of supply and demand beyond a $5.00 price point, so there is no need to extend the Y axis beyond this point.
7.
Click the Fixed option next to the Major Unit setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.
8.
Click in the input box next to the Major Unit setting and change the value from 0.2 to 0.5 (see Figure 4.52 "Setting the Y Axis Scale").
This allows us to measure the plot points in $0.50 intervals along the Y axis.
When the axis extends to $5.00, $0.20 intervals may place too many values along the Y axis, making it difficult to read.
9.
Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Axis dialog box.
Figure 4.52 Setting the Y Axis Scale Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 376 10.

11.
Click the Format Selection button in the Layout tab of the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.
This opens the Format Axis dialog box for the X axis.
12.
Click the Fixed option next to the Minimum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.
This ensures that the minimum value for the X axis will always be zero.
13.
Click the Fixed option next to the Maximum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.
14.
Click in the input box next to the Maximum setting.
Remove the 500.0 and enter the number 450.0.
The number of units supplied or demanded will not exceed 450 based on the price points in our study.
There is no need to extend the X axis to 500.
15.
Click the Fixed option next to the Major Unit setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.
16.
Click in the input box next to the Major Unit setting and change the value from 100.0 to 50.0.
This allows us to measure the plot points in 50-unit intervals along the X axis.
17.
Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Axis dialog box.
18.
Change the value in cell C14 to 2.
Then change it to 4 and then to 8.
Change the value one more time to 14.
As you change the values in cell C14, the lines change but they no longer jump or shift since the scale of both axes is fixed.
Figure 4.53 "Final Appearance of the Scatter Chart" shows the final appearance of the scatter chart after the scale is set for both the X and Y axes.
Notice that market equilibrium is achieved at a price of approximately $2.50.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 377 Figure 4.53 Final Appearance of the Scatter Chart Adding a Trendline and Equation Follow-along file: Continue with Excel Objective 4.00.
(Use file Excel Objective 4.16 if starting here.)
A trendline can be applied to a chart to estimate or predict where plot points may occur at various points along the X and Y axes.
Excel enables you to add a trendline to a chart and also provides the equation you can use to plot additional points.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Set the value in cell C14 on the Supply & Demand worksheet to 14.
2.
Click anywhere in the chart area of the scatter chart to activate it.
3.
Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon.
Select the Linear Trendline option from the drop-down list.
4.
Select the Demand option from the Add Trendline dialog box and click the OK button.
This adds a new line to the plot area of the chart as well as the legend.
5.
Figure 4.54 "Adding a Linear Trendline" shows the scatter chart after adding a linear trendline.
Notice that the line goes through only two points on the demand line.
This indicates that this trendline may not be a good fit for the line that has been created on the chart.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 378 Figure 4.54 Adding a Linear Trendline 6.
Finding the right shape for a trendline may require trying a few different options.
As shown in Figure 4.54 "Adding a Linear Trendline", the linear trendline is not a good fit for the shape of the demand line.
The remaining steps will demonstrate how to remove a trendline and access more trendline options: 7.
Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon.
Select the None option from the drop- down list.
This removes the trendline from the chart.
8.
Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon again.
This time, select More Trendline Options from the drop-down list.
9.
Select the Demand option from the Add Trendline dialog box and click OK.
This opens the Format Trendline dialog box.
10.
Select the Power option from the Format Trendline dialog box.
11.
Click the “Display Equation on chart” option at the bottom of the Format Trendline dialog box (see Figure 4.55 "The Format Trendline Dialog Box").
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 379 12.
Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Trendline dialog box.
Figure 4.55 The Format Trendline Dialog Box Figure 4.56 "Scatter Chart with a Power Trendline" shows the scatter chart with the Power trendline added for the demand series.
Notice that the line fits perfectly over the demand series in the plot area.
In fact, it may be difficult to see the line in the figure.
This indicates that the trendline is an excellent fit for the demand line.
As a result, we can be confident in using this line to predict other demand values along the X and Y axes.
You can also see that the equation for this trendline has been added to the plot area of the chart.
We can use the equation to calculate the price for each quantity value substituted for X.
For example, if the number 150 is substituted for X in the equation, the result is a price of $2.59.
Based on the values used to create the chart, this result appears to be accurate.

5.
Select a data series in the Add Trendline dialog box and click the OK button.
6.
Select the “Display Equation on chart” option from the Format Trendline dialog box to add the trendline equation to the chart.
7.
Click the Close button at the bottom of the dialog box.
KEY TAKEAWAYS  When creating a scatter chart, it is best to start with a blank chart and add each data series individually.
The highlight and click method is less reliable since numeric values are assigned to both the X and Y axes.
As a result, Excel often guesses incorrectly which values are assigned to the X and Y axes.
 Finding the best fit for a trendline is often a matter of trial and error.
You may have to try a few different trendlines to determine which form is the best fit for your data series.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 381  You must open the Format Trendline dialog box to add the line equation to the plot area of the chart.

Learn how to paste an image of an Excel chart into a Word document.
2.
Learn how to paste a link to an Excel chart into a PowerPoint slide.
Charts that are created in Excel are commonly used in Microsoft Word documents or for presentations that use Microsoft PowerPoint slides.
Excel provides options for pasting an image of a chart into either a Word document or a PowerPoint slide.
You can also establish a link to your Excel charts so that if you change the data in your Excel file, it is automatically reflected in your Word or PowerPoint files.
We will demonstrate both methods in this section.
Pasting a Chart Image into Word Follow-along file: Excel Objective 4.17 Excel charts can be valuable tools for explaining quantitative data in a written report.
Reports that address business plans, public policies, budgets, and so on all involve quantitative data.
For this example, we will assume that the Change in Health Care Spend Source stacked column chart (see Figure 4.44 "Completed Stacked Column Chart with Annotations") is being used in a written policy report.
The following steps demonstrate how to paste an image, or picture, of this chart into a Word document: 1.
Click below the figure heading in the Word document that reads: Figure 6: Health Care Spending in the U.S.
The image of the stacked column chart will be placed below this heading.
2.
Open the Excel Objective 4.16 follow-along file.
3.
Activate the Change in Health Care Spend Source chart in the Health Spending Chart worksheet.
4.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
5.

Click the down arrow on the Shape Width button in the Size group of commands (see Figure 4.58 "Changing the Size of a Picture in Word").
Continue to click the down arrow until the width of the picture is 5.5.
As you reduce the width of the picture, the height is automatically reduced as well.
Figure 4.58 Changing the Size of a Picture in Word Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 384 Figure 4.59 "Final Appearance of Pasting a Chart Image into Word" shows the final appearance of the Change in Health Care Spend Source chart pasted into a Word document.
It is best to use either the Shape Width or Shape Height buttons to reduce the size of the chart.
Using either button automatically reduces the height and width of the chart in proper proportion.
If you choose to use the sizing handles to resize the chart, holding the SHIFT key while clicking and dragging on a corner sizing handle will also keep the chart in proper proportion.

Pasting a Linked Chart Image into PowerPoint Follow-along file: Excel Objective 4.18 Microsoft PowerPoint is perhaps the most commonly used tool for delivering live presentations.
The charts used in a live presentation are critical for efficiently delivering your ideas to an audience.
Similar to written documents, a wide range of presentations may require the explanation of quantitative data.
This demonstration includes a PowerPoint slide that could be used in a presentation for setting prices for a hypothetical breakfast cereal company.
We will paste the scatter chart showing the supply and demand for breakfast cereal into this PowerPoint slide.
However, instead of pasting an image, as demonstrated in the Word document, we will establish a link to the Excel file.
As a result, if we change the chart in the Excel file, the change will be reflected in the PowerPoint file.
The following steps explain how to accomplish this: 1.
Open the Excel Objective 4.16 follow-along file.
2.
Activate the scatter chart in the Supply & Demand worksheet.
3.
Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
4.
Go back to the Excel Objective 4.18 PowerPoint file by clicking the file in the taskbar.
5.

The change made in the Excel workbook is now reflected on the PowerPoint slide.
Integrity Check Refreshing Linked Charts in PowerPoint and Word When creating a link to a chart in Word or PowerPoint, you must refresh the data if you make any changes in the Excel workbook.
This is especially true if you make changes in the Excel file prior to opening the Word or PowerPoint file that contains a link to a chart.
To refresh the chart, make sure it is activated, then click the Refresh Data button in the Design tab of the Ribbon.
Forgetting this step can result in old or erroneous data being displayed on the chart.

When creating a link to an Excel chart in Word or PowerPoint, you must keep the Excel workbook in its original location on your computer or network.
If you move or delete the Excel workbook, you will get an error message when you try to update the link in your Word or PowerPoint file.
You will also get an error if the Excel workbook is saved on a network drive that your computer cannot access.
These errors occur because the link to the Excel workbook has been severed.
Therefore, if you know in advance that you will be using a USB drive to pull up your documents or presentation, move the Excel workbook to your USB drive before you establish the link in your Word or PowerPoint file.

Careers in Practice (Skills Review) Fashion Industry Size Analysis (Comprehensive Review Part A) Starter File: Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 1 Difficulty: Level 1 Easy If you are contemplating a career in the fashion industry, you will likely be working with an apparel size analysis report.
Understanding the most commonly purchased sizes is critical for any company in the fashion industry.
For example, in the apparel manufacturing industry, you have to know how many units to manufacture in each size for a particular garment.
In addition, you have to know the exact garment specifications for the sizes small, medium, large, and so on.
If you are pursuing a career on the retail side of the fashion industry, your job may be a little more complicated.
You have to know how many units of each size of a particular garment to ship to each store.
There is nothing more devastating to a fashion company’s sales than luring customers into a store with a great-looking garment and not having their sizes available.
The charts presented in this chapter can be valuable tools in analyzing size information for garments.
This exercise uses the concept of the frequency distribution and frequency comparison to analyze demand by garment size for the knit tops department of an apparel manufacturing company.
The information displayed on these charts can be used to establish the production plan for manufacturing the garments for this department.
Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 1.

When an item is marked down, the price is reduced by a certain amount with the expectation that it will increase the number of units sold.
This is also known as putting an item on sale.
You have probably seen, and perhaps taken advantage of, these sales during a visit to your local mall.
A surplus of inventory can present considerable losses for a fashion retailer.
Therefore, the timing and the amount of discount taken on an item is critical in managing the inventory for these companies.
The increase in the number of units sold will depend on the size of the discount offered on a particular item.
The scatter chart demonstrated in this chapter is a valuable tool in analyzing the rate at which unit sales increase when discounts are offered on an item.

Figure 4.66Completed Scatter Chart CiP Exercise 1 Careers in Practice (Skills Review) Personal Spending and Savings Plan Starter File: Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 2 Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate Excel can be a valuable tool for constructing a personal budget.
As mentioned in Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations", developing a personal budget is an important exercise for establishing a path to financial Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 398 security.
One of the benefits of developing and maintaining a personal budget is that it allows you to maintain a healthy level of savings.
Money that you save can be used to buy personal items.
However, it can also be used to sustain your everyday expenses in the event you lose a job or source of income.
Without a reasonable level of savings, you may be forced to borrow money, which could come at very high interest expenses in the form of credit cards.
Once you accumulate large debt balances at high interest rates, it can take years to pay off that debt, and the interest expense that you pay reduces savings for more important purposes such as college or retirement.
What most people do not realize is that even what appears to be the most trivial overage in spending can rapidly eliminate any savings and quickly turn into debt.
The purpose of this exercise is to use the charts in this chapter to evaluate a personal expense plan and to analyze the relationship that spending and net income have on your ability to save money.
Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 2.
1.
Create a pie chart using the data in the Expense Plan worksheet.
The chart should show the percent of total for the categories in the range A3:A10 based on the Annual Spend values in the range D3:D10.
Use the Exploded Pie in 3-D format.
2.
Move the pie chart to a separate chart sheet.
The tab name for the chart sheet should read Expense Chart.
3.
Remove the legend from the chart.
4.
Edit the title of the chart to read Personal Expenses.
Format the chart title with an Arial font style, bold, italics, and font size of 20 points.
5.
Add data labels to each section of the pie chart.
Show only the category name and the percentage.
Format the percentage to show one decimal place.
6.
Format the data labels with an Arial font style, bold, and font size of 14 points.
Notice that the mortgage and tax categories make up over 50% of total expenses.
7.
Enter a formula into cell D4 on the Savings worksheet.
Your formula should add to the savings balance in cell D2 the result of subtracting the spending value in cell C4 from the net income value in cell B4.
8.
Enter a formula into cell D5 on the Savings worksheet.
Your formula should add to the output in cell D4 the result of subtracting the spending value in cell C5 from the net income value in cell B5.
Copy this formula and paste it into the range D6:D15 using the Paste Formulas command.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 399 9.
Create a line chart using the data in the Savings worksheet.
The chart should show the months in the range A4:A15 along the X axis.
The Y axis should show the dollar amounts in the range B4:D15.
There should be three data series displayed on the chart: Net Income, Spending, and Savings.
Use the Line with Markers format option.
10.
Move the chart so the upper left corner is in the center of cell F3.
11.
Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column F, the right side is locked to the right side of Column O, the top is locked to the top of Row 3, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 18.
12.
Add a chart title above the plot area that reads Savings Analysis.
Format the title with the Subtle Effect - Red, Accent 2 preset shape style.
Then change the font style to Arial, bold, and italics.
13.
Add a title to the Y axis that reads After Tax Dollars.
Use the Rotated Title alignment option.
Format the title with the Subtle Effect - Red, Accent 2 preset shape style.
Then, change the font style to Arial and change the font size to 12 points.
Move the title if needed so it is on the far left of the chart area and centered along the Y axis.
14.
Format the X and Y axes by changing the font style to Arial, making the font bold, and changing the font size to 12 points.
15.
Change the scale of the Y axis so the minimum value is set to −500.
16.
Move the legend up so it is aligned with the $4,500 line of the plot area.
Expand the width of the legend so it extends to the far right side of the chart area.
Then format the legend by changing the font style to Arial and making the font bold.
17.
Change the color of the chart area to White, Background 1, Darker 15%, which is a shade of gray.
18.
Add an annotation that begins approximately one inch above the Dec label on the X axis.
The annotation should extend approximately one and one-quarter inches wide and approximately one- quarter inch in height.
The annotation should read Debt Incurred.
Format the annotation by changing the font style to Arial, bold, italics, and font size of 12 points.

You will find a worksheet in Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 401 the workbook named AnswerSheet.
This worksheet is to be used for any written responses required for this exercise.
Scenario You are working as the director of investment research for a small wealth management firm.
Your firm helps people make investment decisions and establish plans for key life events such as saving for college, retirement, and so on.
An intern who is working for the firm is evaluating the profit trends for two companies: Big Company and Goode Company.
He sends you an Excel workbook and explains the following with respect to his analysis:  I put a chart together to compare the earnings for the two companies.
There is really nothing to look at.
Big Company’s profits are so much larger than those for the Goode Company.
Based on this chart, I don’t see how we would advise our clients to invest in the Goode Company.
We should probably stick with the Big Company.
 Just so you know, the profit numbers on the chart are in thousands.
Otherwise, it is a pretty straightforward column chart.
I put the profits the companies earned for each quarter on the Y axis and the quarters are shown on the X axis.
