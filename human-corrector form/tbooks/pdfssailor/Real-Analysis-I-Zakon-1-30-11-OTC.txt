One of our main objectives is updating the undergraduate analysis as a rigorous postcalculus course.
While such excellent books as Dieudonn´e’s Foundations of Modern Analysis are addressed mainly to graduate students, we try to simplify the modern Bourbaki approach to make it accessible to suﬃciently advanced undergraduates.
(See, for example, 4 of Chapter 5.)
§ On the other hand, we endeavor not to lose contact with classical texts, still widely in use.
Thus, unlike Dieudonn´e, we retain the classical notion of a derivative as a number (or vector), not a linear transformation.
Linear maps are reserved for later (Volume II) to give a modern version of diﬀerentials.
Nor do we downgrade the classical mean-value theorems (see Chapter 5, 2) or § Riemann–Stieltjes integration, but we treat the latter rigorously in Volume II, insideLebesgue theory.
First, however, wepresent themodernBourbakitheory of antidiﬀerentiation (Chapter 5, 5 ﬀ.
), adapted to an undergraduate course.
§ Metric spaces (Chapter 3, 11 ﬀ.)
are introduced cautiously, after the n- § space En, with simple diagrams in E2 (rather than E3), and many “advanced calculus”-type exercises, along with only a few topological ideas.
With some adjustments, the instructor may even limit all to En or E2 (but not just to the real line, E1), postponing metric theory to Volume II.
We do not hesitate to deviate from tradition if this simpliﬁes cumbersome formulations, unpalatable to undergraduates.
Thus we found useful some consistent, though not very usual, conventions (see Chapter 5, 1 and the end of Chapter 4, 4), and § § an early use of quantiﬁers (Chapter 1, 1–3), even in formulating theorems.
§ Contrary to some existing prejudices, quantiﬁers are easily grasped by students after some exercise, and help clarify all essentials.
Several years’ class testing led us to the following conclusions: (1) Volume I can be (and was) taught even to sophomores, though they only gradually learn to read and state rigorous arguments.
A sophomore often does not even know how to start a proof.
The main stumbling block remains the ε, δ-procedure.
As a remedy, we provide most exercises with explicit hints, sometimes with almost complete solutions, leaving only tiny “whys” to be answered.
(2) Motivations are good if they are brief and avoid terms not yet known.
Diagrams are good if they are simple and appeal to intuition.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundationx Preface (3) Flexibility is a must.
One must adapt the course to the level of the class.
“Starred” sections are best deferred.
(Continuity is not aﬀected.)
(4) “Colloquial” language fails here.
We try to keep the exposition rigorous and increasingly concise, but readable.
(5) It is advisable to make the students preread each topic and prepare ques- tions in advance, to be answered in the context of the next lecture.
(6) Some topological ideas (such as compactness in terms of open coverings) are hard on the students.
Trial and error led us to emphasize the se- quential approach instead (Chapter 4, 6).
“Coverings” are treated in § Chapter 4, 7 (“starred”).
§ (7) To students unfamiliar with elements of set theory we recommend our Basic Concepts of Mathematics for supplementary reading.
(At Windsor, this text was used for a preparatory ﬁrst-year one-semester course.)
The ﬁrst two chapters and the ﬁrst ten sections of Chapter 3 of the present text are actually summaries of the corresponding topics of the author’s Basic Concepts of Mathematics, to which we also relegate such topics as the construction of the real number system, etc.
For many valuable suggestions and corrections we are indebted to H. Atkin- son, F. Lemire, and T. Traynor.
Thanks!

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor FoundationAbout the Author Elias Zakon was born in Russia under the czar in 1908, and he was swept along in the turbulence of the great events of twentieth-century Europe.
Zakon studied mathematics and law in Germany and Poland, and later he joined his father’s law practice in Poland.
Fleeing the approach of the German Army in 1941, he took his family to Barnaul, Siberia, where, with the rest of the populace, they endured ﬁve years of hardship.
The Leningrad Institute of Technology was also evacuated to Barnaul upon the siege of Leningrad, and there he met the mathematician I. P. Natanson; with Natanson’s encourage- ment, Zakon again took up his studies and research in mathematics.
Zakon and his family spent the years from 1946 to 1949 in a refugee camp in Salzburg, Austria, where he taught himself Hebrew, one of the six or seven languages in which he became ﬂuent.
In 1949, he took his family to the newly created state of Israel and he taught at the Technion in Haifa until 1956.
In Israel he published his ﬁrst research papers in logic and analysis.
Throughout his life, Zakon maintained a love of music, art, politics, history, law, and especially chess; it was in Israel that he achieved the rank of chess master.
In 1956, Zakon moved to Canada.
As a research fellow at the University of Toronto, heworkedwithAbrahamRobinson.
In 1957, hejoined themathemat- ics faculty at the University of Windsor, where the ﬁrst degrees in the newly established Honours program in Mathematics were awarded in 1960.
While at Windsor, he continued publishing his research results in logic and analysis.
In this post-McCarthy era, he often had as his house-guest the proliﬁc and eccentric mathematician Paul Erd˝os, who was then banned from the United States for his political views.
Erd˝os would speak at the University of Windsor, where mathematicians from the University of Michigan and other American universities would gather to hear him and to discuss mathematics.
WhileatWindsor, Zakondevelopedthreevolumesonmathematicalanalysis, which were bound and distributed to students.
His goal was to introduce rigorous material as early as possible; later courses could then rely on this material.
We are publishing here the latest complete version of the second of these volumes, which was used in a two-semester class required of all second- year Honours Mathematics students at Windsor.

Sets and Operations on Sets.
Quantiﬁers A set is a collection of objects of any speciﬁed kind.
Sets are usually denoted by capitals.
The objects belonging to a set are called its elements or members.
We write x A if x is a member of A, and x A if it is not.
∈ 6∈ A = a, b, c, ... means that A consists of the elements a, b, c, ....
In { } particular, A = a, b consists of a and b; A = p consists of p alone.
The { } { } empty or void set, , has no elements.
Equality (=) means logical identity.
∅ If all members of A are also in B, we call A a subset of B (and B a superset of A), and write A B or B A.
It is an axiom that the sets A and B are ⊆ ⊇ equal (A = B) if they have the same members, i.e., A B and B A.
⊆ ⊆ If, however, A B but B A (i.e., B has some elements not in A), we call A ⊆ 6⊆ a proper subset of B and write A B or B A.
“ ” is called the inclusion ⊂ ⊃ ⊆ relation.
Set equality is not aﬀected by the order in which elements appear.
Thus a, b = b, a .
Not so for ordered pairs (a, b).1 For such pairs, { } { } (a, b) = (x, y) iﬀ2 a = x and b = y, but not if a = y and b = x.
Similarly, for ordered n-tuples, (a , a , ..., a ) = (x , x , ..., x ) iﬀ a = x , k = 1, 2, ..., n. 1 2 n 1 2 n k k We write x P(x) for “the set of all x satisfying the condition P(x).” { | } Similarly, (x, y) P(x, y) is the set of all ordered pairs for which P(x, y) { | } holds; x A P(x) is the set of those x in A for which P(x) is true.
{ ∈ | } 1See Problem 6 for a deﬁnition.
2Short for if and only if; also written .

Set Theory For any sets A and B, we deﬁne their union A B, intersection A B, ∪ ∩ diﬀerence A B, and Cartesian product (or cross product) A B, as follows: − × A B is the set of all members of A and B taken together: ∪ x x A or x B .3 { | ∈ ∈ } A B is the set of all common elements of A and B: ∩ x A x B .
{ ∈ | ∈ } A B consists of those x A that are not in B: − ∈ x A x B .
{ ∈ | 6∈ } A B is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y), with x A and y B: × ∈ ∈ (x, y) x A, y B .
{ | ∈ ∈ } Similarly, A A A is the set of all ordered n-tuples (x , ..., x ) such 1 2 n 1 n × ×···× that x A , k = 1, 2, ..., n. We write An for A A A (n factors).
k k ∈ × ×···× A and B are said to be disjoint iﬀ A B = (no common elements).
∩ ∅ Otherwise, we say that A meets B (A B = ).
Usually all sets involved are ∩ 6 ∅ subsets of a “master set” S, called the space.
Then we write X for S X, − − and call X the complement of X (in S).
Various other notations are likewise − in use.
Examples.
Let A = 1, 2, 3 , B = 2, 4 .
Then { } { } A B = 1, 2, 3, 4 , A B = 2 , A B = 1, 3 , ∪ { } ∩ { } − { } A B = (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4) .
× { } If N is the set of all naturals (positive integers), we could also write A = x N x < 4 .
{ ∈ | } Theorem 1.
(a) A A = A; A A = A; ∪ ∩ (b) A B = B A, A B = B A; ∪ ∪ ∩ ∩ (c) (A B) C = A (B C); (A B) C = A (B C); ∪ ∪ ∪ ∪ ∩ ∩ ∩ ∩ (d) (A B) C = (A C) (B C); ∪ ∩ ∩ ∪ ∩ (e) (A B) C = (A C) (B C).
∩ ∪ ∪ ∩ ∪ 3The word “or” is used in the inclusive sense: “P or Q” means “P or Q or both.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation1–3.
Sets and Operations on Sets.
Quantiﬁers 3 §§ The proof of (d) is sketched in Problem 1.
The rest is left to the reader.
Because of (c), we may omit brackets in A B C and A B C; similarly ∪ ∪ ∩ ∩ for four or more sets.
More generally, we may consider whole families of sets, i.e., collections of many (possibly inﬁnitely many) sets.
If is such a family, M we deﬁne its union, , to be the set of all elements x, each belonging to at M least one set of the family.
The intersection of , denoted , consists of S M M those x that belong to all sets of the family simultaneously.
Instead, we also T write X X and X X , respectively.
{ | ∈ M} { | ∈ M} [ \ Often we can number the sets of a given family: A , A , ..., A , .... 1 2 n More generally, we may denote all sets of a family by some letter (say, X) M with indices i attached to it (the indices may, but need not, be numbers).
The family then is denoted by X or X i I , where i is a variable index i i M { } { | ∈ } ranging over a suitable set I of indices (“index notation”).
In this case, the union and intersection of are denoted by such symbols as M X i I = X = X = X ; i i i i { | ∈ } i i I [ [ [ [∈ X i I = X = X = X .

S S Before proving these laws, we introduce some useful notation.
Logical Quantiﬁers.
From logic we borrow the following abbreviations.
“( x A) ...” means “For each member x of A, it is true that ....” ∀ ∈ “( x A) ...” means “There is at least one x in A such that ....” ∃ ∈ “( !x A) ...” means “There is a unique x in A such that ....” ∃ ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation4 Chapter 1.
Set Theory The symbols “( x A)” and “( x A)” are called the universal and ∀ ∈ ∃ ∈ existential quantiﬁers, respectively.
If confusion is ruled out, we simply write “( x),” “( x),” and “( !x)” instead.
For example, if we agree that m, n ∀ ∃ ∃ denote naturals, then “( n) ( m) m > n” ∀ ∃ means “For each natural n, there is a natural m such that m > n.” We give some more examples.
Let = A i I be an indexed set family.
By deﬁnition, x A i i M { | ∈ } ∈ means that x is in at least one of the sets A , i I.
In other words, there is at i ∈ S least one index i I such that x A ; in symbols, i ∈ ∈ ( i I) x A .
i ∃ ∈ ∈ Thus we note that x A iﬀ [( i I) x A ].
i i ∈ ∃ ∈ ∈ i I [∈ Similarly, x A iﬀ [( i I) x A ].
i i ∈ ∀ ∈ ∈ i \ Also note that x / A iﬀ x is in none of the A , i.e., i i ∈ S ( i) x / A .
i ∀ ∈ Similarly, x / A iﬀ x fails to be in some A , i.e., i i ∈ T ( i) x / A .
(Why?)
i ∃ ∈ We now use these remarks to prove Theorem 2(i).
We have to show that S A has the same elements as (S A ), i.e., that x S A iﬀ i i i − − ∈ − x (S A ).
But, by our deﬁnitions, we have i ∈ S − T S T x S A [x S, x / A ] i i ∈ − ⇐⇒ ∈ ∈ [ ( i) [x S,[x A ] i ⇐⇒ ∀ ∈ 6∈ ( i) x S A i ⇐⇒ ∀ ∈ − x (S A ), i ⇐⇒ ∈ − \ as required.
One proves part (ii) of Theorem 2 quite similarly.
(Exercise!)
We shall now dwell on quantiﬁers more closely.
Sometimes a formula P(x) holds not for all x A, but only for those with an additional property Q(x).
∈ This will be written as ( x A Q(x)) P(x), ∀ ∈ | Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation1–3.
Sets and Operations on Sets.
Quantiﬁers 5 §§ where the vertical stroke stands for “such that.” For example, if N is again the naturals, then the formula ( x N x > 3) x 4 (1) ∀ ∈ | ≥ means “for each x N such that x > 3, it is true that x 4.” In other words, ∈ ≥ for naturals, x > 3 = x 4 (the arrow stands for “implies”).
Thus (1) can ⇒ ≥ also be written as ( x N) x > 3 = x 4.
∀ ∈ ⇒ ≥ In mathematics, we often have to form the negation of a formula that starts with one or several quantiﬁers.
It is noteworthy, then, that each universal quantiﬁer is replaced by an existential one (and vice versa), followed by the negation of the subsequent part of the formula.
For example, in calculus, a real number p is called the limit of a sequence x , x , ..., x , ... iﬀ the following 1 2 n is true: For every real ε > 0, there is a natural k (depending on ε) such that, for all natural n > k, we have x p < ε. n | − | If we agree that lower case letters (possibly with subscripts) denote real num- bers, and that n, k denote naturals (n, k N), this sentence can be written ∈ as ( ε > 0) ( k) ( n > k) x p < ε.
(2) n ∀ ∃ ∀ | − | Here the expressions “( ε > 0)” and “( n > k)” stand for “( ε ε > 0)” ∀ ∀ ∀ | and “( n n > k)”, respectively (such self-explanatory abbreviations will also ∀ | be used in other similar cases).
Now, since (2) states that “for all ε > 0” something (i.e., the rest of (2)) is true, the negation of (2) starts with “there is an ε > 0” (for which the rest of the formula fails).
Thus we start with “( ε > 0)”, and form the negation of ∃ what follows, i.e., of ( k) ( n > k) x p < ε. n ∃ ∀ | − | This negation, in turn, starts with “( k)”, etc.
Step by step, we ﬁnally arrive ∀ at ( ε > 0) ( k) ( n > k) x p ε. n ∃ ∀ ∃ | − | ≥ Note that here the choice of n > k may depend on k. To stress it, we often write n for n. Thus the negation of (2) ﬁnally emerges as k ( ε > 0) ( k) ( n > k) x p ε.
(3) ∃ ∀ ∃ k | nk − | ≥ The order in which the quantiﬁers follow each other is essential.
For exam- ple, the formula ( n N) ( m N) m > n ∀ ∈ ∃ ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation6 Chapter 1.
Set Theory (“each n N is exceeded by some m N”) is true, but ∈ ∈ ( m N) ( n N) m > n ∃ ∈ ∀ ∈ is false.
However, two consecutive universal quantiﬁers (or two consecutive existential ones) may be interchanged.
We brieﬂy write “( x, y A)” for “( x A) ( y A),” ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ and “( x, y A)” for “( x A) ( y A),” etc.
∃ ∈ ∃ ∈ ∃ ∈ We conclude with an important remark.
The universal quantiﬁer in a for- mula ( x A) P(x) ∀ ∈ does not imply the existence of an x for which P(x) is true.
It is only meant to imply that there is no x in A for which P(x) fails.
The latter is true even if A = ; we then say that “( x A) P(x)” is ∅ ∀ ∈ vacuously true.
For example, the formula B, i.e., ∅ ⊆ ( x ) x B, ∀ ∈ ∅ ∈ is always true (vacuously).

Mappings In 1–3, we have already considered sets of ordered pairs, such as Cartesian §§ products A B or sets of the form (x, y) P(x, y) (cf.
1–3, Problem 7).
× { | } §§ If the pair (x, y) is an element of such a set R, we write (x, y) R, ∈ treating (x, y) as one thing.
Note that this does not imply that x and y taken separately are members of R (in which case we would write x, y R).
We call ∈ x, y the terms of (x, y).
In mathematics, it is customary to call any set of ordered pairs a relation.
For example, all sets listed in Problem 7 of 1–3 are relations.
Since relations §§ are sets, equality R = S for relations means that they consist of the same elements (ordered pairs), i.e., that (x, y) R (x, y) S. ∈ ⇐⇒ ∈ If (x, y) R, we call y an R-relative of x; we also say that y is R-related ∈ to x or that the relation R holds between x and y (in this order).
Instead of (x, y) R, we also write xRy, and often replace “R” by special symbols like ∈ <, , etc.
Thus, in case (i) of Problem 7 above, “xRy” means that x < y.
∼ Replacing all pairs (x, y) R by the inverse pairs (y, x), we obtain a new ∈ relation, called the inverse of R and denoted R 1.

We shall now consider an especially important kind of relation.
Deﬁnition 3.
A relation R is called a mapping (map), or a function, or a transfor- mation, iﬀ every element x D has a unique R-relative, so that R[x] R ∈ consists of a single element.
This unique element is denoted by R(x) and iscalled the function value at x (under R).
Thus R(x)isthe only member of R[x].1 If, in addition, diﬀerent elements of D have diﬀerent images, R is called a R one-to-one (or one-one) map.
In this case, x = y (x, y D ) implies R(x) = R(y); R 6 ∈ 6 equivalently, R(x) = R(y) implies x = y.
In other words, no two pairs belonging to R have the same left, or the same right, terms.
ThisshowsthatR is one to one iﬀ R 1, too, is a map.2 Mappings − are often denoted by the letters f, g, h, F, ψ, etc.
1Equivalently, R is a map iﬀ (x, y) R and (x, z) R implies that y =z.
(Why?)
∈ ∈ 2Note that R−1 always exists as a relation, but it need not be a map.

Mappings 11 §§ A mapping f is said to be “from A to B” iﬀ D = A and D B; we then f f′ ⊆ write f: A B (“f maps A into B”).
→ If, in particular, D = A and D = B, we call f a map of A onto B, and we f f′ write f: A B (“f maps A onto B”).
−on→to If f is both onto and one to one, we write f: A B ←on→to (f: A B means that f is one to one).
←→ All pairs belonging to a mapping f have the form (x, f(x)) where f(x) is the function value at x, i.e., the unique f-relative of x, x D .
Therefore, in f ∈ order to deﬁne some function f, it suﬃces to specify its domain D and the f function value f(x) for each x D .
We shall often use such deﬁnitions.
It is f ∈ customary to say that f is deﬁned on A (or “f is a function on A”) iﬀ A = D .
f Examples.
(a) The relation R = (x, y) x is the wife of y { | } is a one-to-one map of the set of all wives onto the set of all husbands.
R 1 is here a one-to-one map of the set of of all husbands (= D ) onto − R′ the set of all wives (= D ).
R (b) The relation f = (x, y) y is the father of x { | } is a map of the set of all people onto the set of their fathers.
It is not one to one since several persons may have the same father (f-relative), and so x = x does not imply f(x) = f(x ).

(As noted above, these formulas may serve to deﬁne g.) It is not one to one since g(1) = g(2), so g 1 is not a map.

Set Theory (d) Consider f: N N, with f(x) = 2x for each x N.3 → ∈ By what was said above, f is well deﬁned.
It is one to one since x = y 6 implies 2x = 2y.
Here D = N (the naturals), but D consists of even 6 f f′ naturals only.
Thus f is not onto N (it is onto a smaller set, the even naturals); f 1 maps the even naturals onto all of N. − The domain and range of a relation may be quite arbitrary sets.
In partic- ular, we can consider functions f in which each element of the domain D is f itself an ordered pair (x, y) or n-tuple (x , x , ..., x ).
Such mappings are 1 2 n called functions of two (respectively, n) variables.
To any n-tuple (x , ..., x ) 1 n that belongs to D , the function f assigns a unique function value, denoted by f f(x , ..., x ).
It is convenient to regard x , x , ..., x as certain variables; 1 n 1 2 n then the function value, too, becomes a variable depending on the x , ..., x .
1 n Often D consists of all ordered n-tuples of elements taken from a set A, f i.e., D = An (cross-product of n sets, each equal to A).
The range may f be an arbitrary set B; so f: An B.
Similarly, f: A B C is a function → × → of two variables, with D = A B, D C. f × f′ ⊆ Functions of two variables are also called (binary) operations.
For example, addition of natural numbers may be treated as a map f: N N N, with × → f(x, y) = x+y.
Deﬁnition 4.
A relation R is said to be (i) reﬂexive iﬀ we have xRx for each x D ; R ∈ (ii) symmetric iﬀ xRy always implies yRx; (iii) transitive iﬀ xRy combined with yRz always implies xRz.
R is called an equivalence relation on a set A iﬀ A = D and R has all the R three properties (i), (ii), and (iii).
For example, such is the equality relation on A (also called the identity map on A) denoted I = (x, y) x A, x = y .
A { | ∈ } Equivalence relations are often denoted by special symbols resembling equality, such as , , , etc.
The formula xRy, where R is such a symbol, is read ≡ ≈ ∼ “x is equivalent (or R-equivalent) to y,” 3This is often abbreviated by saying “consider the function f(x) = 2x on N.” However, one should remember that f(x) is actually not the function f (a set of ordered pairs) but only a single element of the range of f. A better expression is “f is the map x 2x on N” → or “f carries x into 2x (x N).” ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation4–7.

Mappings 13 §§ and R[x] = y xRy (i.e., the R-image of x) is called the R-equivalence class { | } (brieﬂy R-class) of x in A; it consists of all elements that are R-equivalent to x and hence to each other (for xRy and xRz imply ﬁrst yRx, by symmetry, and hence yRz, by transitivity).
Each such element is called a representative of the given R-class, or its generator.
We often write [x] for R[x].
Examples.
(a ) The inequality relation < between real numbers is transitive since ′ x < y and y < z implies x < z; it is neither reﬂexive nor symmetric.

(b ) The inclusion relation between sets is reﬂexive (for A A) and tran- ′ ⊆ ⊆ sitive (for A B and B C implies A C), but it is not symmetric.

An R-class here consists of all k lines parallel to a given line in the plane.

′ Theorem 1.
If R (also written ) is an equivalence relation on A, then all ≡ R-classes are disjoint from each other, and A is their union.
Proof.
Take two R-classes, [p] = [q].
Seeking a contradiction, suppose they 6 are not disjoint, so ( x) x [p] and x [q]; ∃ ∈ ∈ i.e., p x q and hence p q.
But then, by symmetry and transitivity, ≡ ≡ ≡ y [p] y p y q y [q]; ∈ ⇔ ≡ ⇔ ≡ ⇔ ∈ i.e., [p] and [q] consist of the same elements y, contrary to assumption [p] = [q].
6 Thus, indeed, any two (distinct) R-classes are disjoint.
Also, by reﬂexivity, ( x A) x x, ∀ ∈ ≡ i.e., x [x].
Thus each x A is in some R-class (namely, in [x]); so all of A is ∈ ∈ in the union of such classes, A R[x].

Sequences 1 By an inﬁnite sequence (brieﬂy sequence) we mean a mapping (call it u) whose domain is N (all natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ...); D may also contain 0. u 1This section may be deferred until Chapter 2, 13.
§ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation16 Chapter 1.
Set Theory A ﬁnite sequence is a map u in which D consists of all positive (or non- u negative) integers less than a ﬁxed integer p. The range D of any sequence u u′ may be an arbitrary set B; we then call u a sequence of elements of B, or in B.
For example, 1 2 3 4 ... n ... u = (1) 2 4 6 8 ... 2n ... (cid:18) (cid:19) is a sequence with D = N = 1, 2, 3, ... u { } and with function values u(1) = 2, u(2) = 4, u(n) = 2n, n = 1, 2, 3, ....
Instead of u(n) we usually write u (“index notation”), and call u the nth n n term of the sequence.
If n is treated as a variable, u is called the general term n of the sequence, and u is used to denote the entire (inﬁnite) sequence, as n { } well as its range D (whichever is meant, will be clear from the context).
The u′ formula u B means that D B, i.e., that u is a sequence in B.
To { n} ⊆ u′ ⊆ determine a sequence, it suﬃces to deﬁne its general term u by some formula n or rule.2 In (1) above, u = 2n.
n Often we omit the mention of D = N (since it is known) and give only the u range D .
Thus instead of (1), we brieﬂy write u′ 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, ... or, more generally, u , u , ..., u , .... 1 2 n Yet it should be remembered that u is a set of pairs (a map).
Ifallu aredistinct (diﬀerent fromeach other), u isa one-to-one map.
How- n ever, this need not be the case.
It may even occur that all u are equal (then u n is said to be constant); e.g., u = 1 yields the sequence 1, 1, 1, ..., 1, ..., i.e., n 1 2 3 ... n ... u = .
(2) 1 1 1 ... 1 ... (cid:18) (cid:19) Note that here u is an inﬁnite sequence (since D = N), even though its u range D has only one element, D = 1 .
(In sets, repeated terms count u′ u′ { } as one element; but the sequence u consists of inﬁnitely many distinct pairs (n, 1).)
Ifallu arerealnumbers, wecalluareal sequence.
Forsuchsequences, n we have the following deﬁnitions.
2However, such a formula may not exist; the un may even be chosen “at random.” Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation8.
Sequences 17 § Deﬁnition 1.
A real sequence u is said to be monotone (or monotonic) iﬀ it is either n { } nondecreasing, i.e., ( n) u u , n n+1 ∀ ≤ or nonincreasing, i.e., ( n) u u .
n n+1 ∀ ≥ Notation: u and u , respectively.
If instead we have the strict n n { }↑ { }↓ inequalities u < u (respectively, u > u ), we call u strictly n n+1 n n+1 n { } monotone (increasing or decreasing).
A similar deﬁnition applies to sequences of sets.
Deﬁnition 2.
A sequence of sets A , A , ..., A , ... is said to be monotone iﬀ it is 1 2 n either expanding, i.e., ( n) A A , n n+1 ∀ ⊆ or contracting, i.e., ( n) A A .
n n+1 ∀ ⊇ Notation: A and A , respectively.
For example, any sequence of n n { }↑ { }↓ concentric solid spheres (treated as sets of points), with increasing radii, is expanding; if the radii decrease, we obtain a contracting sequence.
Deﬁnition 3.
Let u be any sequence, and let n { } n < n < < n < 1 2 k ··· ··· be a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers.
Select from u n { } those terms whose subscripts are n , n , ..., n , .... Then the sequence 1 2 k u so selected (with kth term equal to u ), is called the subsequence { nk} nk of u , determined by the subscripts n , k = 1, 2, 3, .... n k { } Thus (roughly) a subsequence is any sequence obtained from u by drop- n { } ping some terms, without changing the order of the remaining terms (this is ensured by the inequalities n < n < < n < where the n are the 1 2 k k ··· ··· subscripts of the remaining terms).
For example, let us select from (1) the subsequence of terms whose subscripts are primes (including 1).
Then the subsequence is 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 22, ..., i.e., u , u , u , u , u , u , .... 1 2 3 5 7 11 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation18 Chapter 1.
Set Theory All these deﬁnitions apply to ﬁnite sequences accordingly.
Observe that every sequence arises by “numbering” the elements of its range (the terms): u 1 is the ﬁrst term, u is the second term, and so on.
By so numbering, we put 2 the terms in a certain order, determined by their subscripts 1, 2, 3, ... (like the numbering of buildings in a street, of booksin a library, etc.).
The question now arises: Given a set A, is it always possible to “number” its elements by integers?
As we shall see in 9, this is not always the case.
This leads us to § the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.
A set A is said to be countable iﬀ A is contained in the range of some sequence (brieﬂy, the elements of A can be put in a sequence).
If, in particular, this sequence can be chosen ﬁnite, we call A a ﬁnite set.
(The empty set is ﬁnite.)
Sets that are not ﬁnite are said to be inﬁnite.
Sets that are not countable are said to be uncountable.
Note that all ﬁnite sets are countable.
The simplest example of an inﬁnite countable set is N = 1, 2, 3, ... .
{ } §9.
Some Theorems on Countable Sets 1 We now derive some corollaries of Deﬁnition 4 in 8.

If A is uncountable (or just inﬁnite), so is any superset B A.

× Proof.
If A or B is , then A B = , and there is nothing to prove.
∅ × ∅ Thus let A and B be nonvoid and countable.
We may assume that they ﬁll two inﬁnite sequences, A = a , B = b (repeat terms if necessary).
Then, n n { } { } by deﬁnition, A B is the set of all ordered pairs of the form × (a , b ), n, m N. n m ∈ Call n+m the rank of the pair (a , b ).

Some Theorems on Countable Sets 19 § We now put all pairs (a , b ) in one sequence as follows.
We start with n m (a , b ) 1 1 as the ﬁrst term; then take the two pairs of rank three, (a , b ), (a , b ); 1 2 2 1 then the three pairs of rank four, and so on.
At the (r 1)st step, we take all − pairs of rank r, in the order indicated in (1).
Repeating this process for all ranks ad inﬁnitum, we obtain the sequence of pairs (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), ..., 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 2 3 1 in which u = (a , b ), u = (a , b ), etc.
1 1 1 2 1 2 Byconstruction, thissequencecontainsall pairs of all ranks r, henceallpairs that form the set A B (for every such pair has some rank r and so it must eventually occur in t×he sequence).
Thus A B can be put in a sequence.

The set R of all rational numbers2 is countable.
Proof.
Consider ﬁrst the set Q of all positive rationals, i.e., n fractions , with n, m N. m ∈ We may formally identify them with ordered pairs (n, m), i.e., with N N. × We call n+m the rank of (n, m).

From the proof it also follows that the range of any double se- quence a is countable.

nm nm To prove the existence of uncountable sets, we shall now show that the interval [0, 1) = x 0 x < 1 { | ≤ } of the real axis is uncountable.
We assume as known the fact that each real number x [0, 1) has a unique ∈ inﬁnite decimal expansion 0.x , x , ..., x , ..., 1 2 n where the x are the decimal digits (possibly zeros), and the sequence x n n { } does not terminate in nines (this ensures uniqueness).3 Theorem 3.
The interval [0, 1) of the real axis is uncountable.

We must show that no sequence can comprise all of [0, 1).
Indeed, given any u , write each term u as an inﬁnite decimal fraction; say, n n { } u = 0.a , a , ..., a , .... n n1 n2 nm Next, construct a new decimal fraction z = 0.x , x , ..., x , ..., 1 2 n choosing its digits x as follows.
n If a (i.e., the nth digit of u ) is 0, put x = 1; if, however, a = 0, put nn n n nn 6 x = 0.
Thus, in all cases, x = a , i.e., z diﬀers from each u in at least one n n nn n 6 decimal digit (namely, the nth digit).
It follows that z is diﬀerent from all u n and hence is not in u , even though z [0, 1).
n { } ∈ Thus, no matter what the choice of u was, we found some z [0, 1) not n in the range of that sequence.

Axioms and Basic Deﬁnitions Real numbers can be constructed step by step: ﬁrst the integers, then the rationals, and ﬁnally the irrationals.1 Here, however, we shall assume the set of all real numbers, denoted E1, as already given, without attempting to reduce this notion to simpler concepts.
We shall also accept without deﬁnition (as primitive concepts) the notions of the sum (a+b) and the product, (a b) · or (ab), of two real numbers, as well as the inequality relation < (read “less than”).
Note that x E1 means “x is in E1,” i.e., “x is a real number.” ∈ It is an important fact that all arithmetic properties of reals can be deduced from several simple axioms, listed (and named) below.

An additional axiom will be stated in 8–9.
§§ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation1–4.
Axioms and Basic Deﬁnitions 25 §§ Note 1.
The uniqueness assertions in Axioms IV and V are actually re- dundant since they can be deduced from other axioms.
We shall not dwell on this.
Note 2.
Zero has no reciprocal; i.e., for no x is 0x = 1.
In fact, 0x = 0.
For, by Axioms VI and IV, 0x+0x = (0+0)x = 0x = 0x+0.
Cancelling 0x (i.e.,adding 0x on bothsides), we obtain0x = 0, by AxiomsIII − and V(a).
Note 3.
Due to Axioms VII and VIII, real numbers may be regarded as given in a certain order under which smaller numbers precede the larger ones.
(This is why we speak of “axioms of order.”) The ordering of real numbers can be visualized by “plotting” them as points on a directed line (“the real axis”) in a well-known manner.
Therefore, E1 is also often called “the real axis,” and real numbers are called “points”; we say “the point x” instead of “the number x.” Observethattheaxiomsonlystatecertainpropertiesofrealnumbers without specifying what these numbers are.
Thus we may treat the reals as just any mathematical objects satisfying our axioms, but otherwise arbitrary.
Indeed, our theory also applies to any other set of objects (numbers or not), provided they satisfy our axioms with respect to a certain relation of order (<) and certain operations (+) and ( ), which may, but need not, be ordinary addition · and multiplication.
Such sets exist indeed.
We now give them a name.
Deﬁnition 1.
A ﬁeld is any set F of objects, with two operations (+) and ( ) deﬁned · in it in such a manner that they satisfy Axioms I–VI listed above (with E1 replaced by F, of course).
If F is also endowed with a relation < satisfying Axioms VII to IX, we call F an ordered ﬁeld.
In this connection, postulates I to IX are called axioms of an (ordered) ﬁeld.
By Deﬁnition 1, E1 is an ordered ﬁeld.
Clearly, whatever follows from the axioms must hold not only in E1 but also in any other ordered ﬁeld.
Thus we shall henceforth state our deﬁnitions and theorems in a more general way, speaking of ordered ﬁelds in general instead of E1 alone.
Deﬁnition 2.
An element x of an ordered ﬁeld is said to be positive if x > 0 or negative if x < 0.
Here and below, “x > y” means the same as “y < x.” We also write “x y” for “x < y or x = y”; similarly for “x y.” ≤ ≥ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation26 Chapter 2.

Fields Deﬁnition 3.
For any elements x, y of a ﬁeld, we deﬁne their diﬀerence x y = x+( y).
− − If y = 0, we also deﬁne the quotient of x by y 6 x = xy 1, − y also denoted by x/y.
Note 4.
Division by 0 remains undeﬁned.
Deﬁnition 4.
For any element x of an ordered ﬁeld, we deﬁne its absolute value, x if x 0 and x = ≥ | | x if x < 0.
(cid:26) − It follows that x 0 always; for if x 0, then | | ≥ ≥ x = x 0; | | ≥ and if x < 0, then x = x > 0.

| | − Moreover, x x x , −| | ≤ ≤ | | for, if x 0, then x = x; ≥ | | and if x < 0, then x < x since x > 0.
| | | | Thus, in all cases, x x .
≤ | | Similarly one shows that x x.
−| | ≤ As we have noted, all rules of arithmetic (dealing with the four arithmetic operations and inequalities) can be deduced from Axioms I through IX and thus apply to all ordered ﬁelds, along with E1.
We shall not dwell on their deduction, limiting ourselves to a few simple corollaries as examples.2 2For more examples, see the author’s Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chapter 2, 3–4.

Fields If this process is continued indeﬁnitely, we obtain what is called the set N of all natural elements in the given ﬁeld F. In particular, the natural elements of E1 are called natural numbers.
Note that ( n N) n+1 N. ∀ ∈ ∈ A more precise approach to natural elements is as follows.1 A subset S of ∗ a ﬁeld F is said to be inductive iﬀ (i) 1 S and ∈ (ii) ( x S) x+1 S. ∀ ∈ ∈ Such subsets certainly exist; e.g., the entire ﬁeld F is inductive since 1 F and ( x F) x+1 F. ∈ ∀ ∈ ∈ Deﬁne N as the intersection of all inductive sets in F. Theorem 1.
The set N so deﬁned is inductive itself.
In fact, it is the “small- ∗ est” inductive subset of F (i.e., contained in any other such subset).
Proof.
We have to show that (i) 1 N, and ∈ (ii) ( x N) x+1 N. ∀ ∈ ∈ Now, by deﬁnition, the unity 1 is in each inductive set; hence it also belongs to the intersection of such sets, i.e., to N. Thus 1 N, as claimed.
∈ Next, take any x N. Then, by our deﬁnition of N, x is in each inductive ∈ set S; thus, by property (ii) of such sets, also x + 1 is in each such S; hence x+1 is in the intersection of all inductive sets, i.e., x+1 N, ∈ and so N is inductive, indeed.
Finally, by deﬁnition, N is the common part of all such sets and hence contained in each.
(cid:3) For applications, Theorem 1 is usually expressed as follows.
′ Theorem 1 (ﬁrst induction law).
A proposition P(n) involving a natural n holds for all n N in a ﬁeld F if ∈ (i) it holds for n = 1, i.e., P(1) is true; and (ii) whenever P(n) holds for n = m, it holds for n = m+1, i.e., P(m) = P(m+1).

{ ∈ | } We have to show that actually each n N is in S, i.e., N S. ∈ ⊆ First, we show that S is inductive.

≥ Our next theorem states the so-called well-ordering property of N. Theorem 2 (well-ordering of N).
In an ordered ﬁeld, each nonvoid set A N ⊆ has a least member (i.e., one that exceeds no other element of A).
2 Proof outline.
Given = A N, let P(n) be the proposition “Any subset ∅ 6 ⊆ of A containing elements n has a least member” (n N).
Use Theorem 1 ′ and Example (e).
(cid:3) ≤ ∈ This theorem yields a new form of the induction law.
′ Theorem 2 (second induction law).
A proposition P(n) holds for all n N ∈ in an ordered ﬁeld if (i ) P(1) holds and ′ (ii ) whenever P(n) holds for all naturals less than some m N, then P(n) ′ ∈ also holds for n = m. Proof.
Assume (i ) and (ii ).
Seeking a contradiction,3 suppose there are some ′ ′ n N (call them “bad”) for which P(n) fails.
Then these “bad” naturals form ∈ a nonvoid subset of N, call it A.
2Foramoredetailedproof,seeBasicConceptsofMathematics,Chapter2, 5,Theorem2.
§ 3We are using a “proof by contradiction” or “indirect proof.” Instead of proving our assertion directly, we show that the opposite is impossible, being contradictory.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation5–6.
Natural Numbers.
Induction 31 §§ By Theorem 2, A has a least member m. Thus m is the least natural for which P(n) fails.
It follows that all n less than m do satisfy P(n).
But then, by our assumption (ii ), P(n) also holds for n = m, which is impossible for, by ′ construction, m is “bad” (it is in A).
This contradiction shows that there are no “bad” naturals.
Thus all is proved.
(cid:3) Note 1.
All the preceding arguments hold also if, in our deﬁnition of N and all formulations, the unity 1 is replaced by 0 or by some k ( k N).
± ∈ Then, however, the conclusions must be changed to say that P(n) holds for all integers n k (instead of “n 1”).
We then say that “induction starts with ≥ ≥ k.” An analogous induction law also applies to deﬁnitions of concepts C(n).
A notion C(n) involving a natural n is regarded as deﬁned for each n N ∈ (in E1) if (i) it is deﬁned for n = 1 and (ii) some rule is given that expresses C(n+1) in terms of C(1), ..., C(n).
(Note 1 applies here, too.)
C(n) itself need not be a number; it may be of quite general nature.
We shall adopt this principle as a kind of logical axiom, without proof (though it can be proved in a similar manner as Theorems 1 and 2 ).
The un- ′ ′ derlying intuitive idea is a “step-by-step” process—ﬁrst, we deﬁne C(1); then, as C(1) is known, we may use it to deﬁne C(2); next, once both are known, we may use them to deﬁne C(3); and so on, ad inﬁnitum.
Deﬁnitions based on that principle are called inductive or recursive.
The following examples are important.
Examples (continued).
(f) For any element x of a ﬁeld, we deﬁne its nth power xn and its n-multiple nx by (i) x1 = 1x = x; (ii) xn+1 = xnx (respectively, (n+1)x = nx+x).

{ ∈ | } Theorem 1.
If a and b are integers (or rationals) in F, so are a+b and ab.
Proof.
For integers, this follows from Examples (a) and (d) in 5–6; one only §§ has to distinguish three cases: (i) a, b N; ∈ (ii) a N, b N; − ∈ ∈ (iii) a N, b N. ∈ − ∈ The details are left to the reader (see Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chap- ter 2, 7, Theorem 1).

Then, as is easily seen, ∈ 6 ps qr pr a b = ± and ab = , ± qs qs where qs = 0; and qs and pr are integers by the ﬁrst part of the proof (since 6 p, q, r, s J).
∈ Thus a b and ab are fractions with integral numerators and denominators.
Hence, by±deﬁnition, a b R and ab R. (cid:3) ± ∈ ∈ Theorem 2.
In any ﬁeld F, the set R of all rationals is a ﬁeld itself, under the operations deﬁned in F, with the same neutral elements 0 and 1.
Moreover, R is an ordered ﬁeld if F is.
(We call R the rational subﬁeld of F.) Proof.
We have to check that R satisﬁes the ﬁeld axioms.
The closure law I follows from Theorem 1.
Axioms II, III, and VI hold for rationals because they hold for all elements of F; similarly for Axioms VII to IX if F is ordered.
Axiom IV holds in R because the neutral elements 0 and 1 belong to R; indeed, they are integers, hence certainly rationals.
To verify Axiom V, we must show that x and x 1 belong to R if x does.

Upper and Lower Bounds.
Completeness Axiom A subset A of an ordered ﬁeld F is said to be bounded below (or left bounded) iﬀ there is p F such that ∈ ( x A) p x; ∀ ∈ ≤ A is bounded above (or right bounded) iﬀ there is q F such that ∈ ( x A) x q.
∀ ∈ ≤ In this case, p and q are called, respectively, a lower (or left) bound and an upper (or right) bound, of A.
If both exist, we simply say that A is bounded (by p and q).
The empty set is regarded as (“vacuously”) bounded by any p ∅ and q (cf.
the end of Chapter 1, 3).
§ The bounds p and q may, but need not, belong to A.
If a left bound p is itself in A, we call it the least element or minimum of A, denoted minA.
Similarly, if A contains an upper bound q, we write q = maxA and call q the largest element or maximum of A.
However, A may well have no minimum or maximum.

Fields upper bound v and a greatest lower bound u.
These are abbreviated lubA and glbA and are also called the supremum and inﬁmum of A, respectively; brieﬂy, v = supA, u = infA.
However, this assertion, though valid in E1, fails to materialize in many other ﬁelds such as the ﬁeld R of all rationals (cf.
11–12).
Even for E1, it §§ cannot be proved from Axioms I through IX.
On the other hand, this property is of utmost importance for mathematical analysis; so we introduce it as an axiom (for E1), called the completeness axiom.
It is convenient ﬁrst to give a general deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.
An ordered ﬁeld F is said to be complete iﬀ every nonvoid right-bounded subset A F has a supremum (i.e., a lub) in F. ⊂ Note that we use the term “complete” only for ordered ﬁelds.
With this deﬁnition, we can give the tenth and ﬁnal axiom for E1.
X (completeness axiom).
The real ﬁeld E1 is complete in the above sense.
That is, each right-bounded set A E1 has a supremum (supA) in E1, ⊂ provided A = .
6 ∅ The corresponding assertion for inﬁma can now be proved as a theorem.
Theorem 1.
In a complete ﬁeld F (such as E1), every nonvoid left-bounded subset A F has an inﬁmum (i.e., a glb).
⊂ Proof.
Let B be the (nonvoid) set of all lower bounds of A (such bounds exist since A is left bounded).
Then, clearly, no member of B exceeds any member of A, and so B is right bounded by an element of A.
Hence, by the assumed completeness of F, B has a supremum in F, call it p. We shall show that p is also the required inﬁmum of A, thus completing the proof.
Indeed, we have (i) p is a lower bound of A.
For, by deﬁnition, p is the least upper bound of B.
But, as shown above, each x A is an upper bound of B.
Thus ∈ ( x A) p x.
∀ ∈ ≤ (ii) p is the greatest lower bound of A.
For p = supB is not exceeded by any member of B.
But, by deﬁnition, B contains all lower bounds of A; so p is not exceeded by any of them, i.e., p = glbA = infA.
(cid:3) Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation8–9.
Upper and Lower Bounds.
Completeness Axiom 39 §§ Note 4.
The lub and glb of A (if they exist) are unique.
For infA is, by deﬁnition, the maximum of the set B of all lower bounds of A, and hence unique, by Note 2; similarly for the uniqueness of supA.
Note 5.
Unlike minA and maxA, the glb and lub of A need not belong to A.
For example, if A is the interval (a, b) in E1 (a < b) then, as is easily seen, a = infA and b = supA, though a, b / A.
Thus supA and infA may exist, though maxA and minA do ∈ not.
On the other hand, if q = maxA (p = minA), then also q = supA (p = infA).
(Why?)
Theorem 2.
In an ordered ﬁeld F, we have q = supA (A F) iﬀ ⊂ (i) ( x A) x q and ∀ ∈ ≤ (ii) each ﬁeld element p < q is exceeded by some x A; i.e., ∈ ( p < q) ( x A) p < x.
∀ ∃ ∈ Equivalently, (ii ) ( ε > 0) ( x A) q ε < x; (ε F).
′ ∀ ∃ ∈ − ∈ Similarly, p = infA iﬀ ( x A) p x and ( ε > 0) ( x A) p+ε > x.
∀ ∈ ≤ ∀ ∃ ∈ Proof.
Condition (i) states that q is an upper bound of A, while (ii) implies that no smaller element p is such a bound (since it is exceeded by some x in A).
When combined, (i) and (ii) state that q is the least upper bound.
Moreover, any element p < q can be written as q ε (ε > 0).
Hence (ii) can − be rephrased as (ii ).
′ The proof for infA is quite analogous.
(cid:3) Corollary 1.
Let b F and A F in an ordered ﬁeld F. If each element ∈ ⊂ x of A satisﬁes x b (x b), so does supA (infA, respectively), provided it ≤ ≥ exists in F. In fact, the condition ( x A) x b ∀ ∈ ≤ means that b is a right bound of A.
However, supA is the least right bound, so supA b; similarly for infA.

Some Consequences of the Completeness Axiom The ancient Greek geometer and scientist Archimedes was ﬁrst to observe that even a large distance y can be measured by a small yardstick x; one only has to mark x oﬀ suﬃciently many times.
Mathematically, this means that, given any x > 0 and any y, there is an n N such that nx > y.
This fact, known as ∈ the Archimedean property, holds not only in E1 but also in many other ordered ﬁelds.
Such ﬁelds are called Archimedean.
In particular, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
Any complete ﬁeld F (e.g., E1) is Archimedean.1 That is, given any x, y F (x > 0) in such a ﬁeld, there is a natural n F ∈ ∈ such that nx > y.
Proof by contradiction.
Suppose this fails.
Thus, given y, x F (x > 0), ∈ assume that there is no n N with nx > y.
∈ Then ( n N) nx y; ∀ ∈ ≤ i.e., y is an upper bound of the set of all products nx (n N).
Let ∈ A = nx n N .
{ | ∈ } Clearly, A is bounded above (by y) and A = ; so, by the assumed com- 6 ∅ pleteness of F, A has a supremum, say, q = supA.
As q is an upper bound, we have (by the deﬁnition of A) that nx q for all ≤ n N, hence also (n+1)x q; i.e., ∈ ≤ nx q x ≤ − for all n N (since n N n+1 N).

Fields Thus q x (which is less than q for x > 0) is another upper bound of all nx, − i.e., of the set A.
This is impossible, however, since q = supA is the least upper bound of A.
This contradiction completes the proof.
(cid:3) Corollary 1.
In any Archimedean (hence also in any complete) ﬁeld F, the set N of all natural elements has no upper bounds, and the set J of all integers has neither upper nor lower bounds.
Thus ( y F) ( m, n N) m < y < n. ∀ ∈ ∃ ∈ − Proof.
Given any y F, one can use the Archimedean property (with x = 1) ∈ to ﬁnd an n N such that ∈ n 1 > y, i.e., n > y.
· Similarly, there is an m N such that ∈ m > y, i.e., m < y.
− − This proves our last assertion and shows that no y F can be a right bound of N (for y < n N), or a left bound of J (for y > ∈m J).
(cid:3) ∈ − ∈ Theorem 2.
In any Archimedean (hence also in any complete) ﬁeld F, each left (right) bounded set A of integers ( = A J) has a minimum (maximum, ∅ 6 ⊂ respectively).

Suppose = A J, and A has a lower bound y.
∅ 6 ⊆ Then Corollary 1 (last part) yields a natural m, with m < y, so that − ( x A) m < x, ∀ ∈ − and so x+m > 0.

Any element x of an Archimedean ﬁeld F has an integral part [x].
It is the unique integer n such that n x < n+1.
≤ (It exists, by Theorem 2.)
Any ordered ﬁeld has the so-called density property: If a < b in F, there is x F such that a < x < b; e.g., take ∈ a+b x = .
2 We shall now show that, in Archimedean ﬁelds, x can be chosen rational, even if a and b are not.
We refer to this as the density of rationals in an Archimedean ﬁeld.
Theorem 3 (density of rationals).
Between any elements a and b (a < b) of an Archimedean ﬁeld F (such as E1), there is a rational r F with ∈ a < r < b.
Proof.
Let p = [a] (the integral part of a).
The idea of the proof is to start with p and to mark oﬀ a small “yardstick” 1 < b a n − several (m) times, until m p+ lands inside (a, b); n then r = p+ m is the desired rational.
n We now make it precise.
As F is Archimedean, there are m, n N such ∈ that 1 n(b a) > 1 and m > a p. − n − (cid:16) (cid:17) We ﬁx the least such m (it exists, by Theorem 2 in 5–6).

First of all, we have the following theorem.
§§ Theorem 1.
Given a 0 in a complete ﬁeld F, and a natural number n E1, ≥ ∈ there always is a unique element p F, p 0, such that ∈ ≥ pn = a.

We shall give a simpler proof in Chapter 4, 9, Example (a).
At § present, we omit it and temporarily take Theorem 1 for granted.
Hence we obtain the following result.
Theorem 2.
Every complete ﬁeld F (such as E1) has irrational elements, i.e., elements that are not rational.
In particular, √2 is irrational.1 Proof.
By Theorem 1, F has the element p = √2 with p2 = 2.

Irrationals 47 §§ Seeking a contradiction, suppose √2 is rational, i.e., m √2 = n for some m, n N in lowest terms (see 7, ﬁnal note).
∈ § Then m and n are not both even (otherwise, reduction by 2 would yield a smaller n).
From m/n = √2, we obtain m2 = 2n2; so m2 is even.
Only even elements have even squares, however.2 Thus m itself must be even; i.e., m = 2r for some r N. It follows that ∈ 4r2 = m2 = 2n2, i.e., 2r2 = n2 and, by the same argument, n must be even.
This contradicts the fact that m and n are not both even, and this contra- diction shows that √2 must be irrational.
(cid:3) Note 1.
Similarly, one can prove the irrationality of √a where a N and ∈ a is not the square of a natural.
See Problem 3 below for a hint.
Note 2.
Theorem 2 shows that the ﬁeld R of all rationals is not com- plete (for it contains no irrationals), even though it is Archimedean (see Prob- lem 6).
Thus the Archimedean property does not imply completeness (but see Theorem 1 of 10).
§ Next, we deﬁne ar for any rational number r > 0.
Deﬁnition 1.
Given a 0 in a complete ﬁeld F, and a rational number ≥ m r = (m, n N E1), n ∈ ⊆ we deﬁne ar = √n am.
Here we must clarify two facts.
(1) If n = 1, we have ar = am/1 = √1 am = am.

Real Numbers.
Fields If m = 1, we get ar = a1/n = √n a.
Thus Deﬁnition 1 agrees with our previous deﬁnitions of am and √n a (m, n N).
∈ (2) If r is written as a fraction in two diﬀerent ways, m p r = = , n q then, as is easily seen, √n am = √q ap = ar, and so our deﬁnition is unambiguous (independent of the particular rep- resentation of r).
Indeed, m p = implies mq = np, n q whence amq = apn, i.e., (am)q = (ap)n; cf.
5–6, Problem 6.
§§ By deﬁnition, however, (√n am)n = am and (√q ap)q = ap.
Substituting this in (am)q = (ap)n, we get (√n am)nq = (√q ap)nq, whence √n am = √q ap.
Thus Deﬁnition 1 is valid, indeed.
By using the results of Problems 4 and 6 of 5–6, the reader will easily §§ obtain analogous formulas for powers with positive rational exponents, namely, aras = ar+s; (ar)s = ars; (ab)r = arbr; ar < as if 0 < a < 1 and r > s; (1) a < b iﬀ ar < br (a, b, r > 0); ar > as if a > 1 and r > s; 1r = 1 Henceforth we assume these formulas known, for rational r, s > 0.
Next, we deﬁne ar for any real r > 0 and any element a > 1 in a complete ﬁeld F. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation11–12.
Powers With Arbitrary Real Exponents.
Irrationals 49 §§ Let A denote the set of all members of F of the form ax, with x R and ar ∈ 0 < x r; i.e., ≤ A = ax 0 < x r, x rational .
ar { | ≤ } By the density of rationals in E1 (Theorem 3 of 10), such rationals x do exist; § thus A = .
ar 6 ∅ Moreover, A is right bounded in F. Indeed, ﬁx any rational number y > r. ar By the formulas in (1), we have, for any positive rational x r, ≤ ay = ax+(y x) = axay x > ax − − since a > 1 and y x > 0 implies − ay x > 1.
− Thus ay is an upper bound of all ax in A .
ar Hence, by the assumed completeness of F, supA exists.
So we may deﬁne ar ar = supA .3 ar We also put 1 a r = .
− ar If 0 < a < 1 (so that 1 > 1), we put a 1 r 1 ar = − and a r = , − a ar (cid:16) (cid:17) where 1 r = supA , 1/a,r a (cid:16) (cid:17) as above.
Summing up, we have the following deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.
Given a > 0 in a complete ﬁeld F, and r E1, we deﬁne the following.
∈ (i) If r > 0 and a > 1, then ar = supA = sup ax 0 < x r, x rational .
ar { | ≤ } (ii) If r > 0 and 0 < a < 1, then ar = 1 , also written (1/a) r. (1/a)r − (iii) a r = 1/ar.
(This deﬁnes powers with negative exponents as well.)
− 3Note that, if r is a positiverational itself, thenar isthe largest ax with x r (where ar ≤ and ax are as in Deﬁnition 1); thus ar = maxAar = supAar, and so our present deﬁnition agrees with Deﬁnition 1.
This excludes ambiguities.

Real Numbers.
Fields We also deﬁne 0r = 0 for any real r > 0, and a0 = 1 for any a F, a = 0; ∈ 6 00 remains undeﬁned.
The power ar is also deﬁned if a < 0 and r is a rational m with n odd n because ar = √n am has sense in this case.
(Why?)
This does not work for other values of r. Therefore, in general, we assume a > 0.
Again, it is easy to show that theformulas in (1)remain also validfor powers with real exponents (see Problems 8–13 below), provided F is complete.

Upper and Lower Limits of Sequences I.
The Inﬁnities.
As we have seen, a set A = in E1 has a lub (glb) if A 6 ∅ is bounded above (respectively, below), but not otherwise.
In order to avoid this inconvenient restriction, we now add to E1 two new objects of arbitrary nature, and call them “minus inﬁnity” ( ) and “plus −∞ inﬁnity” (+ ), with the convention that < + and < x < + for ∞ −∞ ∞ −∞ ∞ all x E1.
∈ It is readily seen that with this convention, the laws of transitivity and trichotomy (Axioms VII and VIII) remain valid.
The set consisting of all reals and the two inﬁnities is called the extended real number system.
We denote it by E and call its elements extended real ∗ numbers.
The ordinary reals are also called ﬁnite numbers, while are the ±∞ only two inﬁnite elements of E .
(Caution: They are not real numbers.)
∗ At this stage we do not deﬁne any operations involving .

However, the notions of upper and lower bound, maximum, Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation54 Chapter 2.
Real Numbers.
Fields minimum, supremum, and inﬁmum are deﬁned in E exactly as in E1.
In ∗ particular, = minE and + = maxE .
∗ ∗ −∞ ∞ Thus in E all sets are bounded.
∗ It follows that in E every set A = has a lub and a glb.
For if A has none ∗ 6 ∅ in E1, it still has the upper bound + in E , which in this case is the unique ∗ ∞ (hence also the least) upper bound; thus supA = + .1 Similarly, infA = ∞ −∞ if there is no other lower bound.2 As is readily seen, all properties of lub and glb stated in 8–9 remain valid in E (with the same proof).
The only exception ∗ §§ is Theorem 2(ii ) in the case q = + (respectively, p = ) since + ε ′ ∞ −∞ ∞ − and +ε make no sense.
Part (ii) of Theorem 2 is valid.
−∞ We can now deﬁne intervals in E exactly as in E1 ( 8–9, Example (3)), ∗ §§ allowing also inﬁnite values of a, b, x.
For example, ( , a) = x E < x < a = x E1 x < a ; ∗ −∞ { ∈ | −∞ } { ∈ | } (a, + ) = x E1 a < x ; ∞ { ∈ | } ( , + ) = x E < x < + = E1; ∗ −∞ ∞ { ∈ | −∞ ∞} [ , + ] = x E x + ; etc.
∗ −∞ ∞ { ∈ | −∞ ≤ ≤ ∞} Intervals with ﬁnite endpoints are said to be ﬁnite; all other intervals are called inﬁnite.
The inﬁnite intervals ( , a), ( , a], (a, + ), [a, + ), a E1, −∞ −∞ ∞ ∞ ∈ are actually subsets of E1, as is ( , + ).
Thus we shall speak of inﬁnite −∞ ∞ intervals in E1 as well.

The interpretation of (3) is analogous.

We have q = limx in E iﬀ n ∗ limx = limx = q. n n Proof.
Suppose limx = limx = q. n n If q E1, then every G is an interval (a, b), a < q < b; therefore, Corol- q ∈ lary 2(ii) and its analogue for limx imply (with q treated as both limx and n n limx ) that n a < x < b for all but ﬁnitely many n. n Thus by Deﬁnition 2, q = limx , as claimed.
n Conversely, if so, then any G (no matter how small) contains all but ﬁnitely q many x .
Hence so does any interval (a, b) with a < q < b, for it contains some n small G .

Metric Spaces n §§1–3.
The Euclidean n-Space, E By deﬁnition, the Euclidean n-space En is the set of all possible ordered n- tuples of real numbers, i.e., the Cartesian product E1 E1 E1 (n times).
× ×···× In particular, E2 = E1 E1 = (x, y) x, y E1 , × { | ∈ } E3 = E1 E1 E1 = (x, y, z) x, y, z E1 , × × { | ∈ } and so on.
E1 itself is a special case of En (n = 1).
In a familiar way, pairs (x, y) can be plotted as points of the xy-plane, or as “vectors” (directed line segments) joining (0, 0) to such points.
Therefore, the pairs (x, y) themselves are called points or vectors in E2; similarly for E3.
In En (n > 3), there is no actual geometric representation, but it is con- venient to use geometric language in this case, too.
Thus any ordered n-tuple (x , x , ..., x ) of real numbers will also be called a point or vector in En, and 1 2 n the single numbers x , x , ..., x are called its coordinates or components.
A 1 2 n point in En is often denoted by a single letter (preferably with a bar or an arrow above it), and then its n components are denoted by the same letter, with subscripts (but without the bar or arrow).
For example, x¯ = (x , ..., x ), ~u = (u , ..., u ), etc.
; 1 n 1 n x¯ = (0, 1, 2, 4) is a point (vector) in E4 with coordinates 0, 1, 2, and 4 − − (in this order).
The formula x¯ En means that x¯ = (x , ..., x ) is a point 1 n ∈ (vector) in En.

Lines and Planes in E I.
To obtain a line in E2 or E3 passing through two points a¯ and ¯b, we take the vector ~u = −a→b =¯b a¯ − and, so to say, “stretch” it indeﬁnitely in both directions, i.e., multiply ~u by all possible scalars t E1.
Then the set of all points x¯ of the form ∈ x¯ = a¯+t~u is the required line.
It is natural to adopt this as a deﬁnition in En as well.

As the vector ~u is anyway being multiplied by all real numbers t, the line (as a set of points) will not change if ~u is replaced by some c~u (c E1, ∈ c = 0).
In particular, taking c = 1/ ~u , we may replace ~u by ~u/ ~u , a unit 6 | | | | vector.
We may as well assume that ~u is a unit vector itself.
Ifwelet tvary not overallofE1 but onlyover someinterval inE1, weobtain what is called a line segment.1 In particular, we deﬁne the open line segment L(a¯, ¯b), the closed line segment L[a¯, ¯b], the half-open line segment L(a¯,¯b], and the half-closed line segment L[a¯,¯b), as we did for E1.

A set A En is a plane (hyperplane) iﬀ A is exactly the set of ⊆ all x¯ En satisfying (4) for some ﬁxed c E1 and ~u = (u , ..., u ) = ¯0.
1 n ∈ ∈ 6 Proof.
Indeed, as we saw above, each plane has an equation of the form (4).
Conversely, any equation of that form (with, say, u = 0) can be written as 1 6 c u x +u x +u x + +u x = 0.

(cid:3) 1 n Thus, brieﬂy, planes are exactly all sets with linear equations (4).
In this connection, equation (4) is called the general equation of a plane.
The vector ~u is said to be normal to the plane.
Clearly, if both sides of (4) are multiplied by a nonzero scalar q, one obtains an equivalent equation (representing the same set).
Thus we may replace u by qu , i.e., ~u by q~u, without aﬀecting the plane.
k k In particular, we may replace ~u by the unit vector ~u/ ~u , as in lines (this is | | called the normalization of the equation).
Thus ~u (x¯ a¯) = 0 (5) ~u · − | | and ~u x¯ = a¯+t (6) ~u | | are the normalized (or normal) equations of the plane (3) and line (1), respec- tively.
Note 2.
The equation x = c (for a ﬁxed k) represents a plane orthogonal k to the basic unit vector ~e or, as we shall say, to the kth axis.
The equation k results from (4) if we take ~u = ~e so that u = 1, while u = 0 (i = k).
For k k i 6 example, x = c is the equation of a plane orthogonal to ~e ; it consists of all 1 1 x¯ En, with x = c (while the other coordinates of x¯ are arbitrary).
In E2, it 1 ∈ is a line.
In E1, it consists of c alone.

A plane ~u x¯ = c is said to be perpendicular to a line · x¯ = a¯+t~v iﬀ ~u ~v; the line and the plane are parallel iﬀ ~u ~v.
k ⊥ Note 3.
When normalizing, as in (5) or (6), we actually have two choices of a unit vector, namely, ~u/ ~u .
If one of them is prescribed, we speak of a ± | | directed plane (respectively, line).
Examples.
(a) Let a¯ = (0, 1, 2), ¯b = (1, 1, 1), and c¯= (3, 1, 1) in E3.
Then the line − − ¯ ab has the parametric equation x¯ = a¯+t(b a¯) or, in coordinates, writing − x, y, z for x , x , x , 1 2 3 x = 0+t(1 0) = t, y = 1+2t, z = 2 t. − − − This may be rewritten x y +1 z 2 t = = = − , 1 2 1 − where ~u = (1, 2, 1) is the direction vector (composed of the denomina- − tors).
Normalizing and dropping t, we have x y +1 z 2 = = − 1/√6 2/√6 1/√6 − (the so-called symmetric form of the normal equations).
Similarly, for the line bc, we obtain x 1 y 1 z 1 t = − = − = − , 2 0 2 − where “t = (y 1)/0” stands for “y 1 = 0.” (It is customary to use this − − notation.)
(b) Let a¯ = (1, 2, 0, 3) and ~u = (1, 1, 1, 1) in E4.
Then the plane normal − to ~u through a¯ has the equation (x¯ a¯) ~u = 0, or − · (x 1) 1+(x +2) 1+(x 0) 1+(x 3) 1 = 0, 1 2 3 4 − · · − · − · or x + x + x + x = 2.
Observe that, by formula (4), the coeﬃ- 1 2 3 4 cients of x , x , x , x are the components of the normal vector ~u (here 1 2 3 4 (1, 1, 1, 1)).
Now deﬁne a map f: E4 E1 setting f(x¯) = x +x +x +x (the 1 2 3 4 → left-hand side of the equation).
This map is called the linear functional corresponding tothegivenplane.

The interval A is said to be degenerate iﬀ b = a for some k, in which case, clearly, k k n volA = (b a ) = 0. k k − k=1 Y Note 1.
We have x¯ (a¯, ¯b) iﬀ the inequalities a < x < b hold simul- k k k ∈ taneously for all k. This is impossible if a = b for some k; similarly for the k k inequalities a < x b or a x < b .
Thus a degenerate interval is k k k k k k empty, unless it is clos≤ed (in which≤case it contains a¯ and ¯b at least).

In E3, this is done by a plane orthogonal to one of the axes of the form x = c (see 4–6, Note 2), with a < c < b .
In particular, if k k k §§ c = 1(a +b ), the plane bisects the kth edge of A; and so the kth edge-length 2 k k of P (and Q) equals 1ℓ = 1(b a ).
If A is closed, so is P or Q, depending 2 k 2 k − k on our choice.

The resulting two subinter- vals P and Q then are cut by the plane x = c , bisecting the sec- 2 2 a¯ ond edge in each of them.
Thus we get four subintervals (see Figure 3 for ¯0 X E2).
Each successive plane doubles Figure 3 the number of subintervals.
After n steps, we thus obtain 2n disjoint intervals, with all edges ℓ bisected.

Complex Numbers With all the operations deﬁned in 1–3, En (n > 1) is not yet a ﬁeld because §§ of the lack of a vector multiplication satisfying the ﬁeld axioms.
We shall now deﬁne such a multiplication, but only for E2.
Thus E2 will become a ﬁeld, which we shall call the complex ﬁeld, C. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation8.
Complex Numbers 81 § We make some changes in nota- tion and terminology here.
Points of Y z E2, when regarded as elements of C, will be called complex numbers (each being an ordered pair of real num- 0 X bers).
We denote them by single let- ters (preferably z) without a bar or z an arrow.
For example, z = (x, y).
Figure 5 We preferably write (x, y) for (x , x ).
If z = (x, y), then x and y are called 1 2 the real and imaginary parts of z, respectively,1 and z¯ denotes the complex number (x, y), called the conjugate of z (see Figure 5).
− Complex numbers with vanishing imaginary part, (x, 0), are called real points of C. For brevity, we simply write x for (x, 0); for example, 2 = (2, 0).
In particular, 1 = (1, 0) = θ¯ is called the real unit in C. Points with van- 1 ishing real part, (0, y), are called (purely) imaginary numbers.
In particular, θ¯ = (0, 1) is such a number; we shall now denote it by i and call it the imag- 2 inary unit in C. Apart from these peculiarities, all our former deﬁnitions of 1–3 remain valid in E2 = C. In particular, if z = (x, y) and z = (x , y ), we ′ ′ ′ §§ have z z = (x, y) (x , y ) = (x x , y y ), ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ± ± ± ± ρ(z, z ) = (x x )2 +(y y )2, and ′ ′ ′ − − pz = x2 +y2.

We only must show that multiplication obeys Axioms I–VI of the ﬁeld axioms.
Note that for addition, all is proved in Theorem 1 of 1–3.

It only shows that C cannot be made an ordered ﬁeld.
However, the “real points” in C form a subﬁeld that can be ordered by setting (x, 0) < (x , 0) iﬀ x < x in E1.2 ′ ′ Then this subﬁeld behaves exactly like E1.3 Therefore, it is customary not to distinguish between “real points in C” and “real numbers,” identifying (x, 0) with x.
With this convention, E1 simply is a subset (and a subﬁeld) of C. Henceforth, we shall simply say that “x is real” or “x E1” instead of “x = ∈ (x, 0) is a real point.” We then obtain the following result.
Theorem 2.
Every z C has a unique representation as ∈ z = x+yi, 2The proof is left as an exercise (Problem 1′ below).
3This can be made precise by using the notion of isomorphism (see Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chapter 2, 14).
We shall not go deeper into this topic here.
§ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation8.
Complex Numbers 83 § where x and y are real and i = (0, 1).
Speciﬁcally, z = x+yi iﬀ z = (x, y).
Proof.
By our conventions, x = (x, 0) and y = (y, 0), so x+yi = (x, 0)+(y, 0)(0, 1).
Computing the right-hand expression from deﬁnitions, we have for any x, y ∈ E1 that x+yi = (x, 0)+(y 0 0 1, y 1+0 1) = (x, 0)+(0, y) = (x, y).
· − · · · Thus (x, y) = x+yi for any x, y E1.
In particular, if (x, y) is the given ∈ number z C of the theorem, we obtain z = (x, y) = x+yi, as required.
∈ To prove uniqueness, suppose that we also have z = x +y i with x = (x , 0) and y = (y , 0).
′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ Then, as shown above, z = (x , y ).
Since also z = (x, y), we have (x, y) = ′ ′ (x , y ), i.e., the two ordered pairs coincide, and so x = x and y = y after ′ ′ ′ ′ all.
(cid:3) Geometrically, instead of Carte- Y sian coordinates (x, y), we may also z use polar coordinates r, θ, where y r = x2 +y2 = z r | | and θ is the (pcounterclockwise) rota- tion angle from the x-axis to the di- θ rected line −0→z; see Figure 6.
Clearly, 0 x X z is uniquely determined by r and θ, Figure 6 but θ is not uniquely determined by z; indeed, thesamepointofE2 resultsifθ isreplaced byθ+2nπ (n = 1, 2, ...).
(If z = 0, then θ is not deﬁned at all.)
The values r and θ are called, respec- tively, the modulus and argument of z = (x, y).
By elementary trigonometry, x = rcosθ and y = rsinθ.
Substituting in z = x+yi, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2. z = r(cosθ +isinθ) (trigonometric or polar form of z).

Euclidean Spaces I.
We shall now follow the pattern of En to obtain the general notion of a vector space (just as we generalized E1 to deﬁne ﬁelds).
Let V be a set of arbitrary elements (not necessarily n-tuples), called “vec- tors” or “points,” with a certain operation (call it “addition,” +) somehow deﬁned in V. Let F be any ﬁeld (e.g., E1 or C); its elements will be called scalars; its zero and unity will be denoted by 0 and 1, respectively.
Suppose that yet another operation (“multiplication of scalars by vectors”) has been deﬁned that assigns to every scalar c F and every vector x V a certain ∈ ∈ vector, denoted cx or xc and called the c-multiple of x.
Furthermore, sup- pose that this multiplication and addition in V satisfy the nine laws speciﬁed in Theorem 1 of 1–3.
That is, we have closure: §§ ( x, y V) ( c F) x+y V and cx V. ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∈ ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation86 Chapter 3.
Vector Spaces.
Metric Spaces Vector addition is commutative and associative.
There is a unique zero-vector, ~0, such that ( x V) x+~0 = x, ∀ ∈ and each x V has a unique inverse, x, such that ∈ − x+( x) =~0.
− We have distributivity: a(x+y) = ax+ay and (a+b)x = ax+bx.
Finally, we have 1x = x and (ab)x = a(bx) (a, b F; x, y V).
∈ ∈ In this case, V together with these two operations is called a vector space (or a linear space) over the ﬁeld F; F is called its scalar ﬁeld, and elements of F are called the scalars of V. Examples.
(a) En is a vector space over E1 (its scalar ﬁeld).
(a ) Rn, the set of all rational points of En (i.e., points with rational coordi- ′ nates) is a vector space over R, the rationals in E1.
(Note that we could take R as a scalar ﬁeld for all of En; this would yield another vector space, En over R, not to be confused with En over E1, i.e., the ordinary En.)
(b) LetF beanyﬁeld, andletFn bethesetofallorderedn-tuplesofelements of F, with sums and scalar multiples deﬁned as in En (with F playing the role of E1).
Then Fn is a vector space over F (proof as in Theorem 1 of 1–3).
§§ (c) Each ﬁeld F is a vector space (over itself) under the addition and multi- plication deﬁned in F. Verify!
(d) Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld F, and let W be the set of all possible mappings f: A V → from some arbitrary set A = into V.

Complex spaces can always be transformed into real ones by restricting their scalar ﬁeld C to E1 (treated as a subﬁeld of C).

An important example of a complex linear space is Cn, the set of all ordered n-tuples x = (x , ..., x ) 1 n ofcomplex numbers x (nowtreatedasscalars), withsumsandscalar multiples k deﬁned as in En.
In order to avoid confusion with conjugates of complex numbers, we shall not use the bar notation x¯ for a vector in this section, writing simply x for it.
Dot products in Cn are deﬁned by n x y = x y¯ , k k · k=1 X where y¯ is the conjugate of the complex number y (see 8), and hence a scalar k k § in C. Note that y¯ = y if y E1.
Thus, for vectors with real components, k k k ∈ n x y = x y , k k · k=1 X as in En.

Sometimes (but not always) dot products can also be deﬁned in real or complex linear spaces other than En or Cn, in such a manner as to satisfy the laws (i)–(v), hence also (v ), listed above, with C replaced by E1 if the space ′ is real.
If these laws hold, the space is called Euclidean.
For example, En is a real Euclidean space and Cn is a complex one.

Normed Linear Spaces 91 § Examples.
(A) Each Euclidean space ( 9), such as En or Cn, is a normed space, with § norm deﬁned by x = √x x, | | · as follows from formulas (a )–(c ) in 9.
In En and Cn, one can also ′ ′ § equivalently deﬁne n x = x 2, k | | | | s k=1 X where x = (x , ..., x ).
This is the so-called standard norm, usually 1 n presupposed in En (Cn).
(B) One can also deﬁne other, “nonstandard,” norms on En and Cn.
For example, ﬁx some real p 1 and put ≥ 1 n p x = x p .
p k | | | | (cid:18)k=1 (cid:19) X One can show that x so deﬁned satisﬁes (i)–(iii) and thus is a norm p | | (see Problems 5–7 below).
(C) Let W be the set of all bounded maps f: A E → from a set A = into a normed space E, i.e., such that 6 ∅ ( t A) f(t) c ∀ ∈ | | ≤ for some real constant c > 0 (dependent on f but not on t).
Deﬁne f +g and af as in Example (d) of 9 so that W becomes a vector space.
Also, § put f = sup f(t) , k k | | t A ∈ i.e., the supremum of all f(t) , with t A.
Due to boundedness, this | | ∈ supremum exists in E1, so f E1.
k k ∈ It is easy to show that f is a norm on W. For example, we verify k k (iii) as follows.
By deﬁnition, we have for f, g W and x A, ∈ ∈ (f +g)(x) = f(x)+g(x) | | | | f(x) + g(x) ≤ | | | | (1) sup f(t) +sup g(t) ≤ | | | | t A t A ∈ ∈ = f + g .

Formula (1) also shows that the map f +g is bounded and hence is a member of W. Quite similarly we see that af W for any scalar a and ∈ f W. Thus we have the closure laws for W. The rest is easy.
∈ In every normed (in particular, in each Euclidean) space E, we deﬁne dis- tances by ρ(x, y) = x y for all x, y E. | − | ∈ Such distances depend, of course, on the norm chosen for E; thus we call them norm-induced distances.

Metric Spaces 95 § §11.
Metric Spaces I.

k k − | − | s k=1 X This actually amounts to deﬁning a certain function ρ of two variables x¯, y¯ ∈ En.
We also showed that ρ obeys the three laws of Theorem 5 there.
(We call them metric laws.)
Now, as will be seen, such functions ρ can also be deﬁned in other sets, using quite diﬀerent deﬁning formulas.
In other words, given any set S = 6 ∅ of arbitrary elements, one can deﬁne in it, so to say, “fancy distances” ρ(x, y) satisfying the same three laws.
It turns out that it is not the particular formula used to deﬁne ρ but rather the preservation of the three laws that is most important for general theoretical purposes.
Thus we shall assume that a function ρ with the same three properties has been deﬁned, in some way or other, for a set S = , and propose to study the 6 ∅ consequences of the three metric laws alone, without assuming anything else.
(In particular, no operations other than ρ, or absolute values, or inequalities <, need be deﬁned in S.) All results so obtained will, of course, apply to distances in En (since they obey the metric laws), but they will also apply to other cases where the metric laws hold.
TheelementsofS (thougharbitrary)willbecalled“points,”usuallydenoted by p, q, x, y, z (sometimes with bars, etc.
); ρ is called a metric for S. We symbolize it by ρ: S S E1 × → since it is function deﬁned on S S (pairs of elements of S) into E1.
Thus we × are led to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.
A metric space is a set S = together with a function 6 ∅ ρ: S S E1 × → (called a metric for S) satisfying the metric laws (axioms): For any x, y, and z in S, we have (i) ρ(x, y) 0, and (i’) ρ(x, y) = 0 iﬀ x = y; ≥ (ii) ρ(x, y) = ρ(y, x) (symmetry law); and (iii) ρ(x, z) ρ(x, y)+ρ(y, z) (triangle law).

Vector Spaces.
Metric Spaces Thus a metric space is a pair (S, ρ), namely, a set S and a metric ρ for it.
In general, one can deﬁne many diﬀerent metrics ρ, ρ , ρ , ... ′ ′′ for the same S. The resulting spaces (S, ρ), (S,ρ ), (S,ρ ), ... ′ ′′ then are regarded as diﬀerent.
However, if confusion is unlikely, we simply write S for (S, ρ).
We write “p (S, ρ)” for “p S with metric ρ,” and ∈ ∈ “A (S, ρ)” for “A S in (S, ρ).” ⊆ ⊆ Examples.
(1) In En, we always assume ρ(x¯, y¯) = x¯ y¯ (the “standard metric”) | − | unless stated otherwise.1 By Theorem 5 in 1–3, (En, ρ) is a metric §§ space.
(2) However, one can deﬁne for En many other “nonstandard” metrics.
For example, n 1/p ρ (x¯, y¯) = x y p for any real p 1 ′ k k | − | ≥ (cid:18)k=1 (cid:19) X likewise satisﬁes the metric laws (a proof is suggested in 10, Problems 5– § 7); similarly for Cn.
(3) Any set S = can be “metrized” (i.e., endowed with a metric) by setting 6 ∅ ρ(x, y) = 1 if x = y, and ρ(x, x) = 0.
6 (Verify the metric laws!)
This is the so-called discrete metric.
The space (S, ρ) so deﬁned is called a discrete space.
(4) Distances (“mileages”) on the surface of our planet are actually measured along circles ﬁtting in the curvature of the globe (not straight lines).
One can show that they obey the metric laws and thus deﬁne a (nonstandard) metric for S = (surface of the globe).
(5) A mapping f: A E1 is said to be bounded iﬀ → ( K E1) ( x A) f(x) K. ∃ ∈ ∀ ∈ | | ≤ 1Similarly in other normed spaces ( 10), such as Cn.

§ II.
We now deﬁne “balls” in any metric space (S, ρ).
Deﬁnition 2.
Given p (S, ρ) and a real ε > 0, we deﬁne the open ball or globe with ∈ center p and radius ε (brieﬂy “ε-globe about p”), denoted G or G (ε) or G(p;ε), p p to be the set of all x S such that ∈ ρ(x, p) < ε.
Similarly, the closed ε-globe about p is G = G (ε) = x S ρ(x, p) ε .
p p { ∈ | ≤ } The ε-sphere about p is deﬁned by S (ε) = x S ρ(x, p) = ε .
p { ∈ | } Note.
An open globe in E3 is an ordinary solid sphere (without its surface S (ε)), as known from geometry.
In E2, an open globe is a disc (the interior p of a circle).
In E1, the globe G (ε) is simply the open interval p (p ε, p+ε), − while G (ε) is the closed interval p [p ε, p+ε].
− The shape of theglobes and spheres depends on the metric ρ.
It may become rather strange for various unusual metrics.
For example, in the discrete space (Example (3)), any globe of radius < 1 consists of its center alone, while G (2) p contains the entire space.
(Why?)
See also Problems 1, 2, and 4.
III.
Now take any nonempty set A (S, ρ).
⊆ The distances ρ(x, y) in S are, of course, also deﬁned for points of A (since A S), and the metric laws remain valid in A.
Thus A is likewise a (smaller) ⊆ metric space under the metric ρ “inherited” from S; we only have to restrict the domain of ρ to A A (pairs of points from A).
The set A with this metric × Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation98 Chapter 3.
Vector Spaces.
Metric Spaces is called a subspace of S. We shall denote it by (A, ρ), using the same letter ρ, or simply by A.
Note that A with some other metric ρ is not called a subspace ′ of (S, ρ).
Bydeﬁnition, pointsin(A, ρ)havethesamedistancesasin(S, ρ).
However, globes and spheres in (A, ρ) must consist of points from A only, with centers in A. Denoting such a globe by G (ε) = x A ρ(x, p) < ε , ∗p { ∈ | } we see that it is obtained by restricting G (ε) (the corresponding globe in S) p to points of A, i.e., removing all points not in A.
Thus G (ε) = A G (ε); ∗p ∩ p similarly for closed globes and spheres.
A G (ε) is often called the relativized p ∩ (to A) globe G (ε).
Note that p G (ε) since ρ(p, p) = 0 < ε, and p A. p ∈ ∗p ∈ For example, let R be the subspace of E1 consisting of rationals only.
Then the relativized globe G (ε) consists of all rationals in the interval ∗p G (ε) = (p ε, p+ε), p − and it is assumed here that p is rational itself.
IV.
A few remarks are due on the extended real number system E (see ∗ Chapter 2, 13).
As we know, E consists of all reals and two additional ∗ § elements, , with the convention that < x < + for all x E1.
±∞ −∞ ∞ ∈ The standard metric ρ does not apply to E .
However, one can metrize E in ∗ ∗ variousother ways.
Themost commonmetric ρ issuggested inProblems 5and ′ 6 below.
Under that metric, globes turn out to be ﬁnite and inﬁnite intervals in E .
∗ Instead of metrizing E , we may simply adopt the convention that intervals ∗ of the form (a, + ] and [ , a), a E1, ∞ −∞ ∈ will be called “globes” about + and , respectively (without specifying ∞ −∞ any “radii”).
Globes about ﬁnite points may remain as they are in E1.
This convention suﬃces for most purposes of limit theory.
We shall use it often (as we did in Chapter 2, 13).

Let A be an open globe in (S, ρ) or an open interval (a¯, ¯b) in En.
Then every p A can be enclosed in a small globe G (δ) A (Figures 7 and 8).
p ∈ ⊆ (This would fail for “boundary” points; but there are none inside an open G q ¯ or (a¯, b).)
¯b A A q p p a¯ Figure 7 Figure 8 This suggests the following ideas, for any (S, ρ).
Deﬁnition 1.
A point p is said to be interior to a set A (S, ρ) iﬀ A contains some ⊆ G ; i.e., p, together with some globe G , belongs to A.
We then also say p p that A is a neighborhood of p. The set of all interior points of A (“the interior of A”) is denoted A0.
Note: 0 = and S0 = S.1 ∅ ∅ Deﬁnition 2.
A set A (S, ρ) is said to be open iﬀ A coincides with its interior ⊆ (A0 = A).
Such are and S. ∅ 1Indeed, has no points at all, and henceno interiorpoints; i.e., 0 isvoid.
On the other ∅ ∅ hand, S contains any Gp.
Thus any p is interior to S; i.e., S0 =S.

Vector Spaces.
Metric Spaces Examples.
(1) As noted above, an open globe G (r) has interior points only, and thus q is an open set in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.
(See Problem 1 for a proof.)
(2) The same applies to an open interval (a¯, ¯b) in En.
(See Problem 2.)
(3) The interior of any interval in En never includes its endpoints a¯ and ¯b.
In fact, it coincides with the open interval (a¯, ¯b).
(See Problem 4.)
(4) The set R of all rationals in E1 has no interior points at all (R0 = ) ∅ because it cannot contain any G = (p ε, p + ε).
Indeed, any such p − G contains irrationals (see Chapter 2, 11–12, Problem 5), so it is not p §§ entirely contained in R. Theorem 1 (Hausdorﬀ property2).
Any two points p and q (p = q) in (S, ρ) 6 are centers of two disjoint globes.
More precisely, ( ε > 0) G (ε) G (ε) = .
p q ∃ ∩ ∅ Proof.
As p = q, we have ρ(p, q) > 0 by metric axiom (i ).
Thus we may put ′ 6 1 ε = ρ(p, q) > 0.
2 It remains to show that with this ε, G (ε) G (ε) = .
p q ∩ ∅ Seeking a contradiction, suppose this fails.
Then there is x G (ε) G (ε) p q ∈ ∩ so that ρ(p, x) < ε and ρ(x, q) < ε.
By the triangle law, ρ(p, q) ρ(p, x)+ρ(x, q) < ε+ε = 2ε; i.e., ρ(p, q) < 2ε, ≤ which is impossible since ρ(p, q) = 2ε.

Open and Closed Sets.
Neighborhoods 103 § Deﬁnition 3.
A set A (S, ρ) is said to be closed iﬀ its complement A = S A is ⊆ − − open, i.e., has interior points only.
That is, each p A (outside A) is in some globe G A so that p ∈ − ⊆ − A G = .
p ∩ ∅ Examples (continued).
(5) The sets and S are closed, for their complements, S and , are open, as ∅ ∅ noted above.
Thus a set may be both closed and open (“clopen”).
(6) All closed globes in (S, ρ) and all closed intervals in En are closed sets by ¯ Deﬁnition 3.
Indeed (see Figures 9 and 10), if A = G (r) or A = [a¯, b], q then any point p outside A can be enclosed in a globe G (δ) disjoint from p A; so, by Deﬁnition 3, A is closed (see Problem 12).
(7) A one-point set q (also called “singleton”) in (S, ρ) is always closed, for { } any p outside q (p = q) is in a globe disjoint from q by Theorem 1.
{ } 6 { } In a discrete space ( 11, Example (3)), q is also open since it is an § { } open globe, q = G (1) (why?
); so it is “clopen.” Hence, in such a space, { } q 2 all sets are “clopen”.
For p A implies p = G (1) A; similarly for ∈ { } p 2 ⊆ A.
Thus A and A have interior points only, so both are open.
− − (8) The interval (a, b] in E1 is neither open nor closed.

(The rest of this section may be deferred until Chapter 4, 10.)
∗ § Theorem 2.
The union of any ﬁnite or inﬁnite family of open sets A (i I), i ∈ denoted A , i i I [∈ is open itself.
So also is n A i i=1 \ for ﬁnitely many open sets.
(This fails for inﬁnitely many sets A ; see Prob- i lem 11 below.)
Proof.
We must show that any point p of A = A is interior to A. i i Now if p A , p is in some A , and it is an interior point of A (for A ∈ i i i S i i is open, by assumption).
Thus there is a globe S G A A, p i ⊆ ⊆ as required.

Vector Spaces.
Metric Spaces For ﬁnite intersections, it suﬃces to consider two open sets A and B (for n sets, all then follows by induction).
We must show that each p A B is ∈ ∩ interior to A B.
∩ Now as p A and A is open, we have some G (δ ) A.
Similarly, there is p ′ ∈ ⊆ G (δ ) B.
Then the smaller of the two globes, call it G , is in both A and p ′′ p ⊆ B, so G A B p ⊆ ∩ and p is interior to A B, indeed.
(cid:3) ∩ Theorem 3.
If the sets A (i I) are closed, so is i ∈ A i i I \∈ (even for inﬁnitely many sets).
So also is n A i i=1 [ for ﬁnitely many closed sets A .
(Again, this fails for inﬁnitely many sets A .)
i i Proof.
Let A = A .
To prove that A is closed, we show that A is open.
i I i − ∈ Now by set theory (see Chapter 1, 1–3, Theorem 2), T §§ A = A = ( A ), i i − − − i i \ [ where the ( A ) are open (for the A are closed).
Thus by Theorem 2, A is i i − − open, as required.
The second assertion (as to n A ) follows quite similarly.
(cid:3) i=1 i Corollary 1.
A nonempty setSA (S, ρ) is open iﬀ A is a union of open ⊆ globes.
For if A is such a union, it is open by Theorem 2.
Conversely, if A is open, then each p A is in some G A.
All such G (p A) cover all of A, so p p ∈ ⊆ ∈ A G .
Also, G A since all G are in A.
Thus ⊆ p A p p A p ⊆ p ∈ ∈ S S A = G .

Open and Closed Sets.
Neighborhoods 105 § Note.
The family of all open sets in a given space (S, ρ) is denoted by ; G that of all closed sets, by .
Thus “A ” means that A is open; “A ” F ∈ G ∈ F means that A is closed.
By Theorems 2 and 3, we have ( A, B ) A B and A B ; ∀ ∈ G ∪ ∈ G ∩ ∈ G similarly for .
This is a kind of “closure law.” We say that and are F F G “closed under ﬁnite unions and intersections.” In conclusion, consider any subspace (A, ρ) of (S, ρ).
As we know from 11, § it is a metric space itself, so it has its own open and closed sets (which must consist of points of A only).
We shall now show that they are obtained from those of (S, ρ) by intersecting the latter sets with A. Theorem 4.
Let (A, ρ) be a subspace of (S, ρ).
Then the open (closed) sets in (A, ρ) are exactly all sets of the form A U, with U open (closed) in S. ∩ Proof.
Let G be open in (A, ρ).
By Corollary 1, G is the union of some open globes G (i I) in (A, ρ).
(For brevity, we omit the centers and radii; we ∗i ∈ also omit the trivial case G = .)
∅ As was shown in 11, however, G = A G , where G is an open globe in § ∗i ∩ i i (S, ρ).
Thus G = G = (A G ) = A G , ∗i ∩ i ∩ i i i i [ [ [ by set theory (see Chapter 1, 1–3, Problem 9).
§§ Again by Corollary 1, U = G is an open set in (S, ρ).
Thus G has the i i form S A G = A U, i ∩ ∩ i [ with U open in S, as asserted.
Conversely, assume the latter, and let p G. Then p A and p U.
As ∈ ∈ ∈ U is open in (S, ρ), there is a globe G in (S, ρ) such that p G U.
As p p ∈ ⊆ p A, we have ∈ p A G A U. p ∈ ∩ ⊆ ∩ However, A G is a globe in (A, ρ), call it G .
Thus ∩ p ∗p p G A U = G; ∈ ∗p ⊆ ∩ i.e., p is an interior point of G in (A, ρ).
We see that each p G is interior to ∈ G, as a set in (A, ρ), so G is open in (A, ρ).
This proves the theorem for open sets.
Now let F be closed in (A, ρ).
Then by Deﬁnition 3, A F is open in (A, ρ).
(Of course, when working in (A, ρ), − we replace S by A in taking complements.)
Let G = A F, so F = A G, and − − G is open in (A, ρ).

In an open globe in En, there is no “maximum” distance (why?
), but we still may consider the supremum of alldistances inside theglobe.
Moreover, thismakessense inany set A (S, ρ).
⊆ Thus we accept it as a general deﬁnition, for any such set.

Bounded Sets.
Diameters 109 § Deﬁnition 1.
The diameter of a set A = in a metric space (S, ρ), denoted dA, is the 6 ∅ supremum (in E ) of all distances ρ(x, y), with x, y A;1 in symbols, ∗ ∈ dA = sup ρ(x, y).
x,y A ∈ If A = , we put dA = 0.
If dA < + , A is said to be bounded (in ∅ ∞ (S, ρ)).
Equivalently, we could deﬁne a bounded set as in the statement of the fol- lowing theorem.
Theorem 1.
A set A (S, ρ) is bounded iﬀ A is contained in some globe.
If ⊆ so, the center p of this globe can be chosen at will.
Proof.
If A = , all is trivial.
∅ Thus let A = ; let q A, and choose 6 ∅ ∈ any p S. Now if A is bounded, then ∈ dA < + , so we can choose a real ε > ∞ ε ρ(p, q)+dAasasuitableradiusforaglobe Gp(ε) A (see Figure 11 for motivation).
A ⊇ Nowifx A, thenbythedeﬁnitionofdA, ∈ p q ρ(q, x) dA; so by the triangle law, ≤ ρ(p, x) ρ(p, q)+ρ(q, x) ≤ Figure 11 ρ(p, q)+dA < ε; ≤ i.e.,x G (ε).
Thus( x A)x G (ε), p p ∈ ∀ ∈ ∈ as required.
Conversely, if A G (ε), then any x, y A are also in G (ε); so ρ(x, p) < ε p p ⊆ ∈ and ρ(p, y) < ε, whence ρ(x, y) ρ(x, p)+ρ(p, y) < ε+ε = 2ε.
≤ Thus 2ε is an upper bound of all ρ(x, y) with x, y A.
Therefore, ∈ dA = supρ(x, y) 2ε < + ; ≤ ∞ i.e., A is bounded, and all is proved.
(cid:3) As a special case we obtain the following.
Theorem 2.
A set A En is bounded iﬀ there is a real K > 0 such that ⊆ ( x¯ A) x¯ < K ∀ ∈ | | (similarly in Cn and other normed spaces).
∗ 1Recall that the supremum always exists in E∗ (ﬁnite or not); see Chapter 2, 13.
§ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation110 Chapter 3.
Vector Spaces.
Metric Spaces Proof.
By Theorem 1 (choosing ¯0 for p), A is bounded iﬀ A is contained in some globe G (ε) about ¯0.
That is, ¯0 ( x¯ A) x¯ G (ε) or ρ(x¯, ¯0) = x¯ < ε.
¯0 ∀ ∈ ∈ | | Thus ε is the required K. ( The proof for normed spaces is the same.)
(cid:3) ∗ Note 1.
In E1, this means that ( x A) K < x < K; ∀ ∈ − i.e., A is bounded by K and K. This agrees with our former deﬁnition, given − in Chapter 2, 8–9.
§§ Caution: Upper and lower bounds are not deﬁned in (S, ρ), in general.
Examples.
(1) is bounded, with d = 0, by deﬁnition.
∅ ∅ (2) Let A = [a¯, ¯b] in En, with d = ρ(a¯, ¯b) its diagonal.
By Corollary 1 in 7, § d is the largest distance in A.
In nonclosed intervals, we still have d = sup ρ(x, y) = dA < + (see Problem 10(ii)).
∞ x,y A ∈ Thus all intervals in En are bounded.
(3) Each globe G (ε) in (S, ρ) is bounded, with dG (ε) 2ε < + , as was p p ≤ ∞ shown in the proof of Theorem 1.
See, however, Problems 5 and 6 below.
(4) All of En isnot bounded, under thestandard metric, for ifEn had a ﬁnite diameter d, no distance in En would exceed d; but ρ( de¯ , de¯ ) = 2d, a 1 1 − contradiction!
(5) On the other hand, under the discrete metric ( 11, Example (3)), any set § (even the entire space) is contained in G (3) and hence bounded.
The p same applies to the metric ρ deﬁned for E in Problem 5 of 11, since ′ ∗ § distances under that metric never exceed 2, and so E G (3) for any ∗ p ⊆ choice of p. Note 2.
This shows that boundedness depends on the metric ρ.
A set may be bounded under one metric and not bounded under another.
A metric ρ is said to be bounded iﬀ all sets are bounded under ρ (as in Example (5)).
Problem 9 of 11 shows that any metric ρ can be transformed into a bounded § one, evenpreservingallsuﬃcientlysmallglobes; inpart(i)oftheproblem, even the radii remain the same if they are 1.

A sequence x (S, ρ) is said to be bounded iﬀ its range is bounded m { } ⊆ in (S, ρ), i.e., iﬀ all its terms x are contained in some globe in (S, ρ).

Note 4.
If S = E1 or S = E , we may also speak of upper and lower ∗ bounds.
It is customary to call supf[B] also the supremum of f on B and denote it by symbols like supf(x) or sup f(x) x B .
{ | ∈ } x B ∈ In the case of sequences, we often write sup x or supx instead; similarly m m m for inﬁma, maxima, and minima.

This map is bounded on each ﬁnite interval B = (a, b) since f[B] = (2a, 2b) is itself an interval and hence bounded.
However, f is not bounded on all of E1 since f[E1] = E1 is not a bounded set.
(d) Under a bounded metric ρ, all functions f: A (S, ρ) are bounded.
→ (e) The so-called identity map on S, f: S (S, ρ), is deﬁned by → f(x) = x.
Clearly, f carries each set B S onto itself; i.e., f[B] = B.
Thus f is ⊆ bounded on B iﬀ B is itself a bounded set in (S, ρ).
(f) Deﬁne f: E1 E1 by → f(x) = sinx.
Then f[E1] = [ 1, 1] is a bounded set in the range space E1.
Thus f is − bounded on E1 (brieﬂy, bounded).

Cluster Points.
Convergent Sequences 115 § Deﬁnition 1.
A set, or sequence, A (S, ρ) is said to cluster at a point p S (not ⊆ ∈ necessarily p A), and p is called its cluster point or accumulation point, ∈ iﬀ every globe G about p contains inﬁnitely many points (respectively, p terms) of A.
(Thus only inﬁnite sets can cluster.)
Note 1.
In sequences (unlike sets) an inﬁnitely repeating term counts as inﬁnitely many terms.
For example, the sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, ... clusters at 0 and 1 (why?
); but its range, 0, 1 , has no cluster points (being ﬁnite).
This { } distinctionis, however, irrelevant if allterms x are distinct, i.e.,diﬀerent from m each other.
Then we may treat sequences and sets alike.
Deﬁnition 2.
A sequence x (S, ρ) is said to converge or tend to a point p in S, m { } ⊆ and p is called its limit, iﬀ every globe G (ε) about p (no matter how p small) contains all but ﬁnitely many terms x .2 In symbols, m ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) x G (ε), i.e., ρ(x , p) < ε.
(1) m p m ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ If such a p exists, we call x a convergent sequence (in (S, ρ)); m { } otherwise, a divergent one.
The notation is x p, or limx = p, or lim x = p. m m m → m →∞ In En,3 ρ(x¯ , p¯) = x¯ p¯; thus formula (1) turns into m m | − | x¯ p¯ in En iﬀ ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) x¯ p¯ < ε.
(2) m m → ∀ ∃ ∀ | − | Since “all but ﬁnitely many” (as in Deﬁnition 2) implies “inﬁnitely many” (as in Deﬁnition 1), any limit is also a cluster point.
Moreover, we obtain the following result.
Corollary 1.
If x p, then p is the unique cluster point of x .
(Thus a m m → { } sequence with two or more cluster points, or none at all, diverges.)
For if p = q, the Hausdorﬀ property (Theorem 1 of 12) yields an ε such 6 § that G (ε) G (ε) = .
p q ∩ ∅ As x p, G (ε) leaves out at most ﬁnitely many x , and only these can m p m → possibly be in G (ε).
(Why?)
Thus q fails to satisfy Deﬁnition 1 and hence is q no cluster point.
Hence limx (if it exists) is unique.
m 2That is, Gp(ε) leaves out at most ﬁnitely many terms xm, say, x1, x2, ..., xk, whereas in Deﬁnition 1, Gp(ε) may leave out even inﬁnitely many points of A.

{ mk} Note 2.
A similar argument shows that the convergence or divergence of x , and its limit or cluster points, are not aﬀected by dropping or adding m { } a ﬁnite number of terms; similarly for cluster points of sets.
For example, if x tends to p, so does x (the same sequence without x ).
m m+1 1 { } { } We leave the following two corollaries as exercises.
Corollary 4.
If x splits into two subsequences, each tending to the same m { } limit p, then also x p. m → Corollary 5.
If x convergesin (S, ρ), it is bounded there.
(See Problem 4.)
m { } Of course, the convergence or divergence of x and its clustering depend m { } on the metric ρ and the space S. Our theory applies to any (S, ρ).
In particu- lar, it applies to E , with the metric ρ of Problem 5 in 11.
Recall that under ∗ ′ § that metric, globes about have the form (a, + ] and [ , a), respec- ±∞ ∞ −∞ tively.
Thus limits and cluster points in (E , ρ ) coincide with those deﬁned ∗ ′ in Chapter 2, 13, (formulas (1)–(3) and Deﬁnition 2 there).4 Our theory then § applies to inﬁnite limits as well, and generalizes Chapter 2, 13.
§ Examples.
(a) Let x = p for all m m (such sequences are called constant).
As p G , any G contains all p p ∈ x .
Thus x p, by Deﬁnition 2.
We see that each constant sequence m m → converges to the common value of its terms.

Cluster Points.
Convergent Sequences 117 § (b) In our introductory example, we showed that 1 lim = 0 in E1 m m →∞ and that 0 is the (unique) cluster point of the set A = 1, 1, ... .
Here { 2 } 0 / A.
∈ (c) The sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, ... has two cluster points, 0 and 1, so it diverges by Corollary 1.
(It “os- cillates” from 0 to 1.)
This shows that a bounded sequence may diverge.
The converse to Corollary 5 fails.
(d) The sequence x = m m (or the set N of all naturals) has no cluster points in E1, for a globe of radius < 1 (with any center p E1) contains at most one x , and hence 2 ∈ m no p satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1 or 2.
However, x does cluster in (E , ρ ), and even has a limit there, m ∗ ′ { } namely + .
(Prove it!)
∞ (e) The set R of all rationals in E1 clusters at each p E1.
Indeed, any ∈ globe G (ε) = (p ε, p+ε) p − contains inﬁnitely many rationals (see Chapter 2, 10, Theorem 3), and § this means that each p E1 is a cluster point of R. ∈ (f) The sequence 1 1 1 1, 1, 2, , 3, , ... (with x = and x = k) 2k 2k 1 2 3 k − has only one cluster point, 0, in E1; yet it diverges, being unbounded (see Corollary 5).
In (E , ρ ), it has two cluster points, 0 and + .
(Verify!)
∗ ′ ∞ (g) The lim and lim of any sequence in E are cluster points (cf.
Chapter 2, ∗ 13, Theorem 2 and Problem 4).
Thus in E , all sequences cluster.
∗ § (h) Let A = [a, b], a < b.
Then A clusters exactly at all its points, for if p A, then any globe ∈ G (ε) = (p ε, p+ε) p − overlaps with A (even with (a, b)) and so contains inﬁnitely many points of A, as required.
Even the endpoints a and b are cluster points of A (and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation118 Chapter 3.

On the other hand, no point outside A is a cluster point.
(Why?)
(i) In a discrete space ( 11, Example (3)), no set can cluster, since small § globes, such as G (1), are singletons.
(Explain!)
p 2 Example (h) shows that a set A may equal the set of its cluster points (call it A ); i.e., ′ A = A .
′ Such sets are said to be perfect.
Sometimes we have A A , A A, A = S ′ ′ ′ ⊆ ⊆ (as in Example (e)), or A = .
We conclude with the following result.
′ ∅ Corollary 6.
A set A (S, ρ) clusters at p iﬀ each globe G (about p) contains p ⊆ at least one point of A other than p.5 Indeed, assume the latter.
Then, in particular, each globe 1 G , n = 1, 2, ..., p n (cid:16) (cid:17) contains some point of A other than p; call it x .
We can make the x distinct n n by choosing each time x closer to p than x is.
It easily follows that each n+1 n G (ε) contains inﬁnitely many points of A (the details are left to the reader), p as required.
The converse is obvious.

Operations on Convergent Sequences 121 § (ii) a x aq; m m → x q m (iii) if a = 0 and for all m 1, a = 0. m a → a 6 ≥ 6 m This also holds if the x , y , q, and r are vectors in En ( or in another normed m m ∗ space), while the a and a are scalars for that space.
m Proof.
(i) By formula (2) of 14, we must show that § ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) x y (q r) < ε. m m ∀ ∃ ∀ | ± − ± | Thus we ﬁx an arbitrary ε > 0 and look for a suitable k. Since x q and m → y r, there are k and k such that m ′ ′′ → ε ( m > k ) x q < ′ m ∀ | − | 2 and ε ( m > k ) y r < ′′ m ∀ | − | 2 (as ε is arbitrary, we may as well replace it by 1ε).
Then both inequalities hold 2 for m > k, k = max(k , k ).
Adding them, we obtain ′ ′′ ( m > k) x q + y r < ε. m m ∀ | − | | − | Hence by the triangle law, x q (y r) < ε, i.e., x y (q r) < ε for m > k, m m m m | − ± − | | ± − ± | as required.
(cid:3) This proof of (i) applies to sequences of vectors as well, without any change.
The proof of (ii) and (iii) is sketched in Problems 1–4 below.
Note 1.
By induction, parts (i) and (ii) hold for sums and products of any ﬁnite (but ﬁxed) number of suitable convergent sequences.
Note 2.
The theorem does not apply to inﬁnite limits q, r, a.
Note 3.
The assumption a = 0 in Theorem 1(iii) is important.
It ensures 6 not only that q/a is deﬁned but also that at most ﬁnitely many a can vanish m (see Problem 3).
Since we may safely drop a ﬁnite number of terms (see Note 2 in 14), we can achieve that no a is 0, so that x /a is deﬁned.
It is with m m m § this understanding that part (iii) of the theorem has been formulated.
The next two theorems are actually special cases of more general propositions to be proved in Chapter 4, 3 and 5.
Therefore, we only state them here, leaving §§ the proofs as exercises, with some hints provided.
Theorem 2 (componentwise convergence).
We have x¯ p¯ in En ( Cn) iﬀ m ∗ → each of the n components of x¯ tends to the corresponding component of p¯, m i.e., iﬀ x p , k = 1, 2, ..., n, in E1(C).
(See Problem 8 for hints.)

Metric Spaces Theorem 3.
Every monotone sequence x E has a ﬁnite or inﬁnite n ∗ { } ⊆ limit, which equals sup x if x and inf x if x .
If x is monotone n n { n}↑ n n { n}↓ { n} and bounded in E1, its limit is ﬁnite (by Corollary 1 of Chapter 2, 13).
§ The proof was requested in Problem 9 ofChapter 2, 13.
See also Chapter 4, § 5, Theorem 1.
An important application is the following.
§ Example (the number e).
1 n Let x = 1+ in E1.
By the binomial theorem, n n (cid:16) (cid:17) n(n 1) n(n 1)(n 2) x = 1+1+ − + − − + n 2!n2 3!n3 ··· n(n 1) (n (n 1)) + − ··· − − n!nn 1 1 1 2 1 = 2+ 1 + 1 1 + − n 2!

− n − n ··· − n n!
(cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17) If n is replaced by n + 1, all terms in this expansion increase, as does their number.
Thus x < x , i.e., x .
Moreover, for n > 1, n n+1 n { }↑ 1 1 1 1 2 < x < 2+ + + 2+ + + n 2!
··· n!
≤ 2 ··· 2n 1 − 1 n 1 1 − 1 1 1 − 2 = 2+ 1+ + = 2+ < 2+1 = 3.
2 ··· 2n 2 2 (cid:16)1(cid:17) − (cid:16) (cid:17) 2 Thus 2 < x < 3 for n > 1.
Hence 2 < sup x 3; and by Theorem 3, n n n ≤ sup x = limx .
This limit, denoted by e, plays an important role in n n n analysis.
It can be shown that it is irrational, and (to within 10 20) − e = 2.71828182845904523536....
In any case, 1 n 2 < e = lim 1+ 3.

m m ≤ ≥ ≤ ≥ One can prove this from Corollary 1, with y = c (or x = c) for all m. m m Corollary 3 (rule of intermediate sequence).

More on Cluster Points and Closed Sets.
Density I.
The notions of cluster point and closed set ( 12, 14) can be characterized §§ in terms of convergent sequences.
We start with cluster points.
Theorem 1.
(i) A sequence x (S, ρ) clusters at a point p S iﬀ it has a subsequence m { } ⊆ ∈ x converging to p.1 { mn} (ii) A set A (S, ρ) clusters at p S iﬀ p is the limit of some sequence x n ⊆ ∈ { } of points of A other than p; if so, the terms x can be made distinct.
n Proof.
(i) If p = lim x , then by deﬁnition each globe about p contains n mn →∞ all but ﬁnitely many x , hence inﬁnitely many x .
Thus p is a cluster point.
mn m Conversely, if so, consider in particular the globes 1 G , n = 1, 2, .... p n (cid:16) (cid:17) By assumption, G (1) contains some x .
Thus ﬁx p m x G (1).
m1 ∈ p Next, choose a term 1 x G with m > m .
m2 ∈ p 2 2 1 (cid:16) (cid:17) (Such terms exist since G (1) contains inﬁnitely many x .)
Next, ﬁx p 2 m 1 x G , with m > m > m , m3 ∈ p 3 3 2 1 (cid:16) (cid:17) and so on.
Thus, step by step (inductively), select a sequence of subscripts m < m < < m < 1 2 n ··· ··· that determines a subsequence (see Chapter 1, 8) such that § 1 1 ( n) x G , i.e., ρ(x , p) < 0, ∀ mn ∈ p n mn n → (cid:16) (cid:17) 1Therefore, cluster points of xm are also called subsequential limits.

(cid:3) 1 2 § ··· Examples.
(a) Recall that the set R of all rationals clusters at each p E1 ( 14, ∈ § Example (e)).
Thus by Theorem 1(ii), each real p is the limit of a se- quence of rationals.
See also Problem 6 of 12 for p¯ in En.
§ (b) The sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, ... has two convergent subsequences, x = 1 1 and x = 0 0.
2n 2n 1 → − → Thus by Theorem 1(i), it clusters at 0 and 1.
Interpret Example (f) and Problem 10(a) in 14 similarly.
§ As we know, even inﬁnite sets may have no cluster points (take N in E1).
However, a bounded inﬁnite set or sequence in En ( or Cn) must cluster.
This ∗ important theorem (due to Bolzano and Weierstrass) is proved next.
Theorem 2 (Bolzano–Weierstrass).
(i) Each bounded inﬁnite set or sequence A in En ( or Cn) has at least one ∗ cluster point p¯ there (possibly outside A).
(ii) Thus each bounded sequence in En ( Cn) has a convergent subsequence.
∗ Proof.
Take ﬁrst a bounded sequence z [a, b] in E1.
Let m { } ⊆ p = limz .
m By Theorem 2(i) of Chapter 2, 13, z clusters at p. Moreover, as m § { } a z b, m ≤ ≤ we have a infz p supz b m m ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ by Corollary 1 of Chapter 2, 13.
Thus § p [a, b] E1, ∈ ⊆ and so z clusters in E1.
m { } Assertion (ii) now follows—for E1—by Theorem 1(i) above.
Next, take z¯ E2, z¯ = (x , y ); x , y E1.

Let m m { } ¯ a¯ = (a , a ) and b = (b , b ).
1 2 1 2 Then a x b and a y b in E1.
1 m 1 2 m 2 ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ Thus by the ﬁrst part of the proof, x has a convergent subsequence m { } x p for some p [a , b ].
mk → 1 1 ∈ 1 1 For simplicity, we henceforth write x for x , y for y , and z¯ for z¯ .
m mk m mk m mk Thus z¯ = (x , y ) is now a subsequence, with x p , and a y b , m m m m 1 2 m 2 → ≤ ≤ as before.
We now reapply this process to y and obtain a subsubsequence m { } y p for some p [a , b ].
mi → 2 2 ∈ 2 2 The corresponding terms x still tend to p by Corollary 3 of 14.
Thus we mi 1 § have a subsequence z¯ = (x , y ) (p , p ) in E2 mi mi mi → 1 2 by Theorem 2 in 15.
Hence p¯= (p , p ) is a cluster point of z¯ .
Note that 1 2 m p¯ [a¯, ¯b] (see abo§ve).
This proves the theorem for sequences{in E}2 (hence in ∈ C).
The proof for En is similar; one only has to take subsequences n times.
( The same applies to Cn with real components replaced by complex ones.)
∗ Now take a bounded inﬁnite set A En ( Cn).
Select from it an inﬁnite ∗ ⊂ sequence z¯ of distinct points (see Chapter 1, 9, Problem 5).
By what was m { } § shown above, z¯ clusters at some point p¯, so each G contains inﬁnitely m p¯ many distinct p{oin}ts z¯ A.
Thus by deﬁnition, A clusters at p¯.
(cid:3) m ∈ Note 1.
We have also proved that if z¯ [a¯, ¯b] En, then z¯ has a m m cluster point in [a¯, ¯b].

Forexample, ∗ in a discrete space, all sets are bounded, but no set can cluster.
II.
Cluster points are closely related to the following notion.
Deﬁnition 1.
The closure of a set A (S, ρ), denoted A, is the union of A and the set ⊆ of all cluster points of A (call it A ).
Thus A = A A .
′ ′ ∪ Theorem 3.

(Here, however, the § x need not be distinct or diﬀerent from p.) The details are left to the reader.
n This also yields the following new characterization of closed sets (cf.
12).
§ Theorem 4.
A set A (S, ρ) is closed iﬀ one of the following conditions ⊆ holds.
(i) A contains all its cluster points (or has none); i.e., A A .
′ ⊇ (ii) A = A.
(iii) A contains the limit of each convergent sequence x A (if any).2 n { } ⊆ Proof.
Parts (i) and (ii) are equivalent since A A A = A A = A.
(Explain!)
′ ′ ⊇ ⇐⇒ ∪ Now let A be closed.
If p / A, then p A; therefore, by Deﬁnition 3 in ∈ ∈ − 12, some G fails to meet A (G A = ).
Hence no p A is a cluster point, p p § ∩ ∅ ∈ − or the limit of a sequence x A.
(This would contradict Deﬁnitions 1 and n { } ⊆ 2 of 14.)
Consequently, all such cluster points and limits must be in A, as § claimed.
Conversely, suppose A is not closed, so A is not open.
Then A has a − − noninterior point p; i.e., p A but no G is entirely in A.
This means that p ∈ − − each G meets A.
Thus p p A (by Theorem 3), ∈ and p = lim x for some x A (by the same theorem), n n n { } ⊆ →∞ even though p / A (for p A).
∈ ∈ − We see that (iii) and (ii), hence also (i), fail if A is not closed and hold if A is closed.
(See the ﬁrst part of the proof.)
Thus the theorem is proved.

A B = A B (the closure of A B equals the union of A and ∪ ∪ ∪ B).
III.
As we know, the rationals are dense in E1 (Theorem 3 of Chapter 2, 10).
This means that every globe G (δ) = (p δ, p + δ) in E1 contains p § − rationals.
Similarly (see Problem 6 in 12), the set Rn of all rational points is § dense in En.
We now generalize this idea for arbitrary sets in a metric space (S, ρ).
Deﬁnition 2.
Given A B (S, ρ), we say that A is dense in B iﬀ each globe G , p ⊆ ⊆ p B, meets A.

Cauchy Sequences.
Completeness A convergent sequence is characterized by the fact that its terms x become m (andstay) arbitrarilycloseto itslimit, as m + .
Due to this, however, they → ∞ also get close to each other; in fact, ρ(x , x ) can be made arbitrarily small m n for suﬃciently large m and n. It is natural to ask whether the latter property, in turn, implies the existence of a limit.
This problem was ﬁrst studied by Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857).
Thus weshall call such sequences Cauchy sequences.
More precisely, we formulate the following.
Deﬁnition 1.
A sequence x (S, ρ) is called a Cauchy sequence (we brieﬂy say m { } ⊆ that “ x is Cauchy”) iﬀ, given any ε > 0 (no matter how small), we m { } have ρ(x , x ) < ε for all but ﬁnitely many m and n. In symbols, m n ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m, n > k) ρ(x , x ) < ε.

Metric Spaces Observe that here we only deal withterms x , x , not with any other point.
m n The limit (if any) is not involved, and we do not have to know it in advance.
We shall now study the relationship between property (1) and convergence.
Theorem 1.
Every convergent sequence x (S, ρ) is Cauchy.
m { } ⊆ Proof.
Let x p. Then given ε > 0, there is a k such that m → ε ( m > k) ρ(x , p) < .
m ∀ 2 As this holds for any m > k, it also holds for any other term x with n > k. n Thus ε ε ( m, n > k) ρ(x , p) < and ρ(p, x ) < .
m n ∀ 2 2 Adding and using the triangle inequality, we get ρ(x , x ) ρ(x , p)+ρ(p, x ) < ε, m n m n ≤ and (1) is proved.
(cid:3) Theorem 2.
Every Cauchy sequence x (S, ρ) is bounded.
m { } ⊆ Proof.
We must show that all x are in some globe.
First we try an arbitrary m radius ε.
Then by (1), there is k such that ρ(x , x ) < ε for m, n > k. Fix m n some n > k. Then ( m > k) ρ(x , x ) < ε, i.e., x G (ε).
∀ m n m ∈ xn Thus the globe G (ε) contains all x except possibly the k terms x , ..., x .
xn m 1 k To include them as well, we only have to take a larger radius r, greater than ρ(x , x ), m = 1, ..., k. Then all x are in the enlarged globe G (r).
(cid:3) m n m xn Note 1.
InE1, underthestandardmetric, onlysequenceswithﬁnite limits are regarded as convergent.
If x , then x is not even a Cauchy n n → ±∞ { } sequence in E1 (in view of Theorem 2); but in E , under a suitable metric ∗ (cf.
Problem 5 in 11), it is convergent (hence also Cauchy and bounded).
§ Theorem 3.
If a Cauchy sequence x clusters at a point p, then x p. m m { } → Proof.
We want to show that x p, i.e., that m → ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) ρ(x , p) < ε. m ∀ ∃ ∀ Thus we ﬁx ε > 0 and look for a suitable k. Now as x is Cauchy, there is m { } a k such that ε ( m, n > k) ρ(x , x ) < .
m n ∀ 2 Also, as p is a cluster point, the globe G (ε) contains inﬁnitely many x , so we p 2 n can ﬁx one with n > k (k as above).

It follows that a Cauchy sequence can have at most one cluster point p, for p is also its limit and hence unique; see 14, Corollary 1.
§ These theorems show that Cauchy sequences behave very much like conver- gent ones.
Indeed, our next theorem (a famous result by Cauchy) shows that, in En ( and Cn) the two kinds of sequences coincide.
∗ Theorem 4 (Cauchy’s convergence criterion).
A sequence x¯ in En ( or m ∗ { } Cn) converges if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof.
If x converges, it is Cauchy by Theorem 1. m { } Conversely, let x be a Cauchy sequence.
Then by Theorem 2, it is m { } bounded.
Hence by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (Theorem 2 of 16), it § has a cluster point p¯.
Thus by Theorem 3 above, it converges to p¯, and all is proved.
(cid:3) Unfortunately, this theorem (along with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem used in its proof) does not hold in all metric spaces.
It even fails in some subspaces of E1.
For example, we have 1 x = 0 in E1.
m m → By Theorem 1, this sequence, being convergent, is also a Cauchy sequence.
Moreover, it still preserves (1) even if we remove the point 0 from E1 since the distances ρ(x , x ) remain the same.
However, in the resulting subspace m n S = E1 0 , the sequence no longer converges because its limit (and unique −{ } cluster point) 0 has disappeared, leaving a “gap” in its place.
Thus we have a Cauchy sequence in S, without a limit or cluster points, so Theorem 4 fails in S (along with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem).
Quite similarly, both theorems fail in (0, 1) (but not in [0, 1]) as a subspace of E1.
By analogy to incomplete ordered ﬁelds, it is natural to say that S is “incomplete” because of the missing cluster point 0, and call a space (or subspace) “complete” if it has no such “gaps,” i.e., if Theorem 4 holds in it.
Thus we deﬁne as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.
A metricspace (orsubspace) (S, ρ)issaidto becomplete iﬀevery Cauchy sequence in S converges to some point p in S. Similarly, a set A (S, ρ) is called complete iﬀ each Cauchy sequence ⊆ x A converges to some point p in A, i.e., iﬀ (A, ρ) is complete as a m { } ⊆ metric subspace of (S,ρ).
In particular, En ( and Cn) are complete by Theorem 4.
The sets (0, 1) ∗ and E1 0 are incomplete in E1, but [0, 1] is complete.
Indeed, we have the −{ } following theorem.

∗ (i) Every closed set in a complete space is complete itself.
(ii) Every complete set A (S, ρ) is necessarily closed.1 ⊆ Proof.
(i) Let A be a closed set in a complete space (S, ρ).
We have to show that Theorem 4 holds in A (as it does in S).
Thus we ﬁx any Cauchy sequence x A and prove that it converges to some p in A. m { } ⊆ Now, since S is complete, the Cauchy sequence x has a limit p in S. As m { } A is closed, however, that limit must be in A by Theorem 4 in 16.
Thus (i) § is proved.
(ii) Now let A be complete in a metric space (S, ρ).
To prove that A is closed, we again use Theorem 4 of 16.
Thus we ﬁx any convergent sequence § x A, x p S, and show that p must be in A. m m { } ⊆ → ∈ Now, since x converges in S, it is a Cauchy sequence, in S as well as m { } in A.
Thus by the assumed completeness of A, it has a limit q in A.
Then, however, the uniqueness of lim x (in S) implies that p = q A, so that p is m in A, indeed.

Basic Deﬁnitions We shall now consider functions whose domains and ranges are sets in some ﬁxed (but otherwise arbitrary) metric spaces (S, ρ) and (T, ρ ), respectively.
′ We write f: A (T, ρ ) ′ → for a function f with D = A (S, ρ) and D (T, ρ ).
S is called the f ⊆ f′ ⊆ ′ domain space, and T the range space, of f. I.
Given such a function, we often have to investigate its “local behavior” near some point p S. In particular, if p A = D (so that f(p) is deﬁned) we f ∈ ∈ may ask: Is it possible to make the function values f(x) as near as we like (“ε- near”) to f(p) by keeping x suﬃciently close (“δ-close”) to p, i.e., inside some suﬃciently small globe G (δ)?1 If this is the case, we say that f is continuous p at p. More precisely, we formulate the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.
A function f: A (T, ρ ), with A (S, ρ), is said to be continuous at ′ → ⊆ p iﬀ p A and, moreover, for each ε > 0 (no matter how small) there is ∈ δ > 0 such that ρ (f(x), f(p)) < ε for all x A G (δ).
In symbols, ′ p ∈ ∩ ρ (f(x), f(p)) < ε, or ′ ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x A G (δ)) (1) p ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ f(x) G (ε).
(cid:26) ∈ f(p) If (1) fails, we say that f is discontinuous at p and call p a discontinuity point of f. This is also the case if p / A (since f(p) is not deﬁned).
∈ If (1) holds for each p in a set B A, we say that f is continuous on B.
If ⊆ this is the case for B = A, we simply say that f is continuous.
1Of course, for f(x) to exist, x must also be in A=Df; thus x A Gp(δ).
We say that ∈ ∩ x is δ-close to p iﬀ ρ(x, p)<δ.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation150 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity Sometimes we prefer to keep x near p but diﬀerent from p. We then replace G (δ) in (1) by the set G (δ) p , i.e., the globe without its center, denoted p p −{ } G (δ) and called the deleted δ-globe about p. This is even necessary if p / D .
p f ¬ ∈ Replacing f(p) in (1) by some q T, we then are led to the following deﬁnition.
∈ Deﬁnition 2.
Given f: A (T, ρ ), A (S, ρ), p S, and q T, we say that f(x) ′ → ⊆ ∈ ∈ tends to q as x tends to p (f(x) q as x p) iﬀ for each ε > 0 there is → → δ > 0 such that ρ (f(x), q) < ε for all x A G (δ).
In symbols, ′ p ∈ ∩ ¬ ρ (f(x), q) < ε, i.e., ′ ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x A G (δ)) (2) p ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ f(x) G (ε).
(cid:26) ∈ q This means that f(x) is ε-close to q when x is δ-close to p and x = p.2 6 If (2) holds for some q, we call q a limit of f at p. There may be no such q.
We then say that f has no limit at p, or that this limit does not exist.
If there is only one such q (for a given p), we write q = lim f(x).
x p → Note 1.
Formula (2) holds “vacuously” (see Chapter 1, 1–3, end remark) §§ if A G (δ) = for some δ > 0.
Then any q T is a limit at p, so a limit p ∩ ¬ ∅ ∈ exists but is not unique.
(We discard the case where T is a singleton.)
Note 2.
However, uniqueness is ensured if A G (δ) = for all δ > 0, as p ∩ ¬ 6 ∅ we prove below.
Observe that by Corollary 6 of Chapter 3, 14, the set A clusters at p iﬀ § ( δ > 0) A G (δ) = .
(Explain!)
p ∀ ∩ ¬ 6 ∅ Thus we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1.
If A clusters at p in (S, ρ), then a function f: A (T, p ) can ′ → have at most one limit at p; i.e., lim f(x) is unique (if it exists).3 x p → In particular, this holds if A (a, b) E1 (a < b) and p [a, b].
⊇ ⊂ ∈ Proof.
Suppose f has two limits, q and r, at p. By the Hausdorﬀ property, G (ε) G (ε) = for some ε > 0. q r ∩ ∅ Also, by (2), there are δ , δ > 0 such that ′ ′′ ( x A G (δ )) f(x) G (ε) and p ′ q ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ ∈ ( x A G (δ )) f(x) G (ε).
p ′′ r ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ ∈ 2Observe that the choice of δ depends on ε in both (1) and (2).
3Because of this, some authors restrict Deﬁnition 2 to the case where A clusters at p. However, this has its disadvantages (e.g., Corollary 2 fails).
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation1.
Basic Deﬁnitions 151 § Let δ = min(δ , δ ).
Then for x A G (δ), f(x) is in both G (ε) and G (ε), ′ ′′ p q r ∈ ∩ ¬ and such an x exists since A G (δ) = by assumption.
p But this is impossible since∩G¬(ε) 6G∅(ε) = (a contradiction!).
(cid:3) q r ∩ ∅ For intervals, see Chapter 3, 14, Example (h).
§ Corollary 2. f is continuous at p (p D ) iﬀ f(x) f(p) as x p. f ∈ → → The straightforward proof from deﬁnitions is left to the reader.
Note 3.
In formula (2), we excluded the case x = p by assuming that x A G (δ).
This makes the behavior of f at p itself irrelevant.
Thus for p ∈ ∩ ¬ the existence of a limit q at p, it does not matter whether p D or whether f ∈ f(p) = q.
But both conditions are required for continuity at p (see Corollary 2 and Deﬁnition 1).
Note 4.
Observe that if (1) or (2) holds for some δ, it certainly holds for any δ δ.
Thus we may always choose δ as small as we like.
Moreover, as ′ ≤ x is limited to G (δ), we may disregard, or change at will, the function values p f(x) for x / G (δ) (“local character of the limit notion”).
p ∈ II.
Limits in E .
If S or T is E (or E1), we may let x or ∗ ∗ → ±∞ f(x) .
For a precise deﬁnition, we rewrite (2) in terms of globes G and p → ±∞ G : q ( G ) ( G ) ( x A G ) f(x) G .
(2 ) q p p q ′ ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ ∈ This makes sense also if p = or q = .
We only have to use our ±∞ ±∞ conventions as to G , or the metric ρ for E , as explained in Chapter 3, 11.
′ ∗ ±∞ § For example, consider “f(x) q as x + ” (A S = E , p = + , q (T, ρ )).
∗ ′ → → ∞ ⊆ ∞ ∈ HereG hastheform (a, + ], a E1, and G = (a, + ), whileG = G (ε), p p q q as usual.
Noting that x G∞ m∈eans x > a (¬x E1), w∞e can rewrite (2 ) as p ′ ∈ ¬ ∈ ( ε > 0) ( a E1) ( x A x > a) f(x) G (ε), or ρ (f(x), q) < ε.
(3) q ′ ∀ ∃ ∈ ∀ ∈ | ∈ This means that f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to q for large x (x > a).
Next consider “f(x) + as x .” Here G = ( , a) and p → ∞ → −∞ ¬ −∞ G = (b,+ ].
Thus formula (2 ) yields (with S = T = E , and x varying over q ′ ∗ ∞ E1) ( b E1) ( a E1) ( x A x < a) f(x) > b; (4) ∀ ∈ ∃ ∈ ∀ ∈ | similarly in other cases, which we leave to the reader.
Note 5.
In (3), we may take A = N (the naturals).
Then f: N (T, ρ ) ′ → is a sequence in T. Writing m for x, set u = f(m) and a = k N to obtain m ∈ ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) u G (ε); i.e., ρ (u , q) < ε. m q ′ m ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation152 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity This coincides with our deﬁnition of the limit q of a sequence u (see m { } Chapter 3, 14).
Thus limits of sequences are a special case of function limits.
§ Theoremsonsequences canbeobtainedfromthoseonfunctions f: A (T, ρ ) ′ → by simply taking A = N and S = E as above.
∗ Note 6.
Formulas (3) and (4) make sense also if S = E1 (respectively, S = T = E1) since they do not involve any mention of .
We shall use such ±∞ formulas also for functions f: A T, with A S E1 or T E1, as the → ⊆ ⊆ ⊆ case may be.
III.
Relative Limits and Continuity.
Sometimes the desired result (1) or (2) does not hold in full, but only with A replaced by a smaller set B A.
⊆ Thus we may have ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x B G (δ)) f(x) G (ε).
p q ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ ∈ In this case, we call q a relative limit of f at p over B and write “f(x) q as x p over B” → → or lim f(x) = q (if q is unique); x p,x B → ∈ B is called the path over which x tends to p. If, in addition, p D and f ∈ q = f(p), we say that f is relatively continuous at p over B; then (1) holds with A replaced by B.
Again, if this holds for every p B, we say that f ∈ is relatively continuous on B.
Clearly, if B = A = D , this yields ordinary f (nonrelative) limits and continuity.
Thus relative limits and continuity are more general.
Note that for limits over a path B, x is chosen from B or B p only.
− { } Thus the behavior of f outside B becomes irrelevant, and so we may arbitrarily redeﬁne f on B.
For example, if p / B but lim f(x) = q exists, we x p,x B − ∈ → ∈ may deﬁne f(p) = q, thus making f relatively continuous at p (over B).
We also may replace (S, ρ) by (B, ρ) (if p B), or restrict f to B, i.e., replace ∈ f by the function g: B (T, ρ ) deﬁned by g(x) = f(x) for x B (brieﬂy, ′ → ∈ g = f on B).4 A particularly important case is A S E , e.g., S = E1.
∗ ⊆ ⊆ Then inequalities are deﬁned in S, so we may take B = x A x < p (points in A, preceding p).
{ ∈ | } 4The functiong is calledthe restrictionof f to B denotedf or f .
Thus f is relatively B B | continuous on B iﬀ f is continuous.
B Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation1.
Basic Deﬁnitions 153 § Then, writing G for G (ε) and a = p δ, we obtain from formula (2) q q − ( G ) ( a < p) ( x A a < x < p) f(x) G .
(5) q q ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ | ∈ If (5) holds, we call q a left limit of f at p and write “f(x) q as x p ” (“x tends to p from the left”).
− → → If, in addition, q = f(p), we say that f is left continuous at p. Similarly, taking B = x A x > p , { ∈ | } we obtain right limits and continuity.
We write f(x) q as x p+ → → iﬀ q is a right limit of f at p, i.e., if (5) holds with all inequalities reversed.
If the set B in question clusters at p, the relative limit (if any) is unique.
We then denote the left and right limit, respectively, by f(p ) and f(p+), and − we write lim f(x) = f(p ) and lim f(x) = f(p+).
(6) − x p− x p+ → → Corollary 3.
With the previous notation, if f(x) q as x p over a path → → B, and also over D, then f(x) q as x p over B D. → → ∪ Hence if D E and p E , we have f ∗ ∗ ⊆ ∈ q = lim f(x) iﬀ q = f(p ) = f(p+).

− x p → We now illustrate our deﬁnitions by a diagram in E2 representing a function f: E1 E1 by its graph, i.e., points (x, y) such that y = f(x).
→ Here G (ε) = (q ε, q +ε) q − is an interval on the y-axis.
The dotted lines show how to construct an interval (p δ, p+δ) = G p − on the x-axis, satisfying formula (1) in Figure 13, formulas (5) and (6) in Figure 14, or formula (2) in Figure 15.
The point Q in each diagram belongs to the graph; i.e., Q = (p, f(p)).

No matter how small δ is, the globe G (δ) = (p δ, p+δ) p − (even the deleted globe) contains both rationals and irrationals.
Thus as x varies over G (δ), f(x) takes on both values, 0 and 1, many times and p so gets out of a¬ny G (ε), with q E1, ε < 1. q ∈ 2 Hence for any q, p E1, formula (2) fails if we take ε = 1, say.

Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity 161 § §2.
Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity I.
In 1 we gave the so-called “ε, δ” deﬁnition of continuity.
Now we present § another (equivalent) formulation, known as the sequential one.
Roughly, it states that f is continuous iﬀ it carries convergent sequences x D into m f { } ⊆ convergent “image sequences” f(x ) .
More precisely, we have the following m { } theorem.
Theorem 1 (sequential criterion of continuity).
(i) A function f: A (T, ρ ), with A (S, ρ), ′ → ⊆ is continuous at a point p A iﬀ for every sequence x A such that m ∈ { } ⊆ x p in (S, ρ), we have f(x ) f(p) in (T, ρ ).
In symbols, m m ′ → → ( x A x p) f(x ) f(p).
(1 ) m m m ′ ∀{ } ⊆ | → → (ii) Similarly, a point q T is a limit of f at p (p S) iﬀ ∈ ∈ ( x A p x p) f(x ) q.
(2 ) m m m ′ ∀{ } ⊆ −{ } | → → Note that in (2 ) we consider only sequences of terms other than p. ′ Proof.
We ﬁrst prove (ii).
Suppose q is a limit of f at p, i.e.
(see 1), § ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x A G (δ)) f(x) G (ε).
(2) p q ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ ∈ Thus, given ε > 0, there is δ > 0 (henceforth ﬁxed) such that f(x) G (ε) whenever x A, x = p, and x G (δ).
(3) q p ∈ ∈ 6 ∈ We want to deduce (2 ).
Thus we ﬁx any sequence ′ x A p , x p.1 m m { } ⊆ −{ } → Then ( m) x A and x = p, m m ∀ ∈ 6 and G (δ) contains all but ﬁnitely many x .
Then these x satisfy the con- p m m ditions stated in (3).
Hence f(x ) G (ε) for all but ﬁnitely many m. As ε m q ∈ is arbitrary, this implies f(x ) q (by the deﬁnition of lim f(x )), as is m m → m required in (2′).
Thus (2) = (2′).
→∞ ⇒ Conversely, suppose (2) fails, i.e., its negation holds.
(See the rules for forming negations of such formulas in Chapter 1, 1–3.)
Thus §§ ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x A G (δ)) f(x) / G (ε) (4) p q ∃ ∀ ∃ ∈ ∩ ¬ ∈ 1If no such sequence exists, then (2′) is vacuously true and there is nothing to prove.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation162 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity by the rules for quantiﬁers.
We ﬁx an ε satisfying (4), and let 1 δ = , m = 1, 2, .... m m By (4), for each δ there is x (depending on δ ) such that m m m 1 x A G (5) m p ∈ ∩ ¬ m (cid:16) (cid:17) and f(x ) / G (ε), m = 1, 2, 3, ... (6) m q ∈ We ﬁx these x .
As x A and x = p, we obtain a sequence m m m ∈ 6 x A p .
m { } ⊆ −{ } Also, as x G ( 1 ), we have ρ(x , p) < 1/m 0, and hence x p. m ∈ p m m → m → On the other hand, by (6), the image sequence f(x ) cannot converge to q m { } (why?
), i.e., (2 ) fails.
Thus we see that (2 ) fails or holds accordingly as (2) ′ ′ does.
This proves assertion (ii).
Now, by setting q = f(p) in (2) and (2 ), we also ′ obtain the ﬁrst clause of the theorem, as to continuity.
(cid:3) Note 1.
The theorem also applies to relative limits and continuity over a path B (just replace A by B in the proof), as well as to the cases p = ±∞ and q = in E (for E can be treated as a metric space; see the end of ∗ ∗ ±∞ Chapter 3, 11).
§ If the range space (T, ρ ) is complete (Chapter 3, 17), then the image ′ § sequences f(x ) converge iﬀ they are Cauchy.
This leads to the following m { } corollary.
Corollary 1.
Let (T, ρ ) be complete, such as En.
Let a map f: A T with ′ → A (S, ρ) and a point p S be given.
Then for f to have a limit at p, ⊆ ∈ it suﬃces that f(x ) be Cauchy in (T, ρ ) whenever x A p and m ′ m { } { } ⊆ − { } x p in (S, ρ).
m → Indeed, as noted above, all such f(x ) converge.
Thus it only remains to m { } show that they tend to one and the same limit q, as is required in part (ii) of Theorem 1.
We leave this as an exercise (Problem 1 below).
Theorem 2 (Cauchy criterionfor functions).
With the assumptions of Corol- ∗ lary 1, the function f has a limit at p iﬀ for each ε > 0, there is δ > 0 such that ρ (f(x), f(x )) < ε for all x, x A G (δ).2 ′ ′ ′ p ∈ ∩ ¬ In symbols, ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x, x A G (δ)) ρ (f(x), f(x )) < ε.
(7) ′ p ′ ′ ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ 2That is, f(x) is ε-close to f(x′) when x and x′ are δ-close to p, but not equal to p. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation2.
Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity 163 § Proof.
Assume (7).
To show that f has a limit at p, we use Corollary 1.
Thus we take any sequence x A p with x p m m { } ⊆ −{ } → and show that f(x ) is Cauchy, i.e., m { } ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m,n > k) ρ (f(x ), f(x )) < ε.
′ m n ∀ ∃ ∀ To do this, ﬁx an arbitrary ε > 0.
By (7), we have ( x, x A G (δ)) ρ (f(x), f(x )) < ε, (7 ) ′ p ′ ′ ′ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ for some δ > 0.
Now as x p, there is k such that m → ( m, n > k) x , x G (δ).
m n p ∀ ∈ As x A p , we even have x , x A G (δ).
Hence by (7 ), m m n p ′ { } ⊆ −{ } ∈ ∩ ¬ ( m, n > k) ρ (f(x ), f(x )) < ε; ′ m n ∀ i.e., f(x ) is Cauchy, as required in Corollary 1, and so f has a limit at p. m { } This shows that (7) implies the existence of that limit.
The easy converse proof is left to the reader.
(See Problem 2.)

The composite of two functions f: S T and g: T U, → → denoted g f (in that order), ◦ is by deﬁnition a map of S into U given by (g f)(x) = g(f(x)), s S. ◦ ∈ Our next theorem states, roughly, that g f is continuous if g and f are.
We ◦ shall use Theorem 1 to prove it.
Theorem 3.
Let (S, ρ), (T, ρ ), and (U, ρ ) be metric spaces.
If a function ′ ′′ f: S T is continuous at a point p S, and if g: T U is continuous at the → ∈ → point q = f(p), then the composite function g f is continuous at p. ◦ Proof.
The domain of g f is S. So take any sequence ◦ x S with x p. m m { } ⊆ → As f is continuous at p, formula (1 ) yields f(x ) f(p), where f(x ) is in ′ m m → T = D .
Hence, as g is continuous at f(p), we have g g(f(x )) g(f(p)), i.e., (g f)(x ) (g f)(p), m m → ◦ → ◦ and this holds for any x S with x p. Thus g f satisﬁes condition m m (1 ) and is continuous a{t p.} ⊆(cid:3) → ◦ ′ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation164 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity Caution: The fact that lim f(x) = q and lim g(y) = r x p y q → → does not imply lim g(f(x)) = r x p → (see Problem 3 for counterexamples).
Indeed, if x S p andx p, weobtain, asbefore, f(x ) q, but m m m { } ⊆ −{ } → → not f(x ) = q.
Thus we cannot re-apply formula (2 ) to obtain g(f(x )) r m ′ m 6 → since (2 ) requires that f(x ) = q.
The argument still works if g is continuous ′ m 6 at q (then (1 ) applies) or if f(x) never equals q (then f(x ) = q).
It even ′ m 6 suﬃces that f(x) = q for x in some deleted globe about p (see 1, Note 4).
6 § Hence we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2.
With the notation of Theorem 3, suppose f(x) q as x p, and g(y) r as y q.
→ → → → Then g(f(x)) r as x p, → → provided, however, that (i) g is continuous at q, or (ii) f(x) = q for x in some deleted globe about p, or 6 (iii) f is one to one, at least when restricted to some G (δ).
p ¬ Indeed, (i) and (ii) suﬃce, as was explained above.
Thus assume (iii).
Then f can take the value q at most once, say, at some point x G (δ).
0 p ∈ ¬ As x = p, let 0 6 δ = ρ(x , p) > 0.
′ 0 Then x / G (δ ), so f(x) = q on G (δ ), and case (iii) reduces to (ii).
0 p ′ p ′ ∈ ¬ 6 ¬ We now show how to apply Corollary 2.
Note 2.
Suppose we know that r = lim g(y) exists.
y q → Using this fact, we often pass to another variable x, setting y = f(x) where f is such that q = lim f(x) for some p. We shall say that the substitution (or x p → Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation2.
Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity 165 § “change of variable”) y = f(x) is admissible if one of the conditions (i), (ii), or (iii) of Corollary 2 holds.3 Then by Corollary 2, lim g(y) = r = lim g(f(x)) y q x p → → (yielding the second limit).
Examples.
(A) Let 1 x h(x) = 1+ for x 1. x | | ≥ (cid:16) (cid:17) Then lim h(x) = e. x + → ∞ For a proof, let n = f(x) = [x] be the integral part of x.
Then for x > 1, 1 n 1 n+1 1+ h(x) 1+ .
(Verify!)
(8) n+1 ≤ ≤ n (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17) As x + , n tends to + over integers, and by rules for sequences, → ∞ ∞ 1 n+1 1 1 n 1 n lim 1+ = lim 1+ 1+ = 1 lim 1+ = 1 e = e, n n n n n ·n n · →∞ →∞ →∞ (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17) with e as in Chapter 3, 15.
Similarly one shows that also § 1 n lim 1+ = e. n n+1 →∞ (cid:16) (cid:17) Thus (8) implies that also lim h(x) = e (see Problem 6 below).
x + → ∞ Remark.
Here we used Corollary 2(ii) with 1 n f(x) = [x], q = + , and g(n) = 1+ .
∞ n (cid:16) (cid:17) The substitution n = f(x) is admissible since f(x) = n never equals + , its ∞ limit, thus satisfying Corollary 2(ii).
(B) Quite similarly, one shows that also 1 x lim 1+ = e. x x →−∞ (cid:16) (cid:17) See Problem 5.
3In particular, the so-called linear substitution y = ax+b (a, b E1, a = 0) is always ∈ 6 admissible since f(x)=ax+b yields a one-to-one map.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation166 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity (C) In Examples (A) and (B), we now substitute x = 1/z.
This is admissible by Corollary 2(ii) since the dependence between x and z is one to one.
Then 1 z = 0+ as x + , and z 0 as x .
− x → → ∞ → → −∞ Thus (A) and (B) yield lim (1+z)1/z = lim (1+z)1/z = e. z 0+ z 0− → → Hence by Corollary 3 of 1, we obtain § lim(1+z)1/z = e. (9) z 0 → More Problems on Limits and Continuity 1.

Operations on Limits.
Rational Functions I.
A function f: A T is said to be real if its range D lies in E1, complex → f′ if D C, vector valued if D is a subset of En, and scalar valued if D lies in f′ ⊆ f′ f′ the scalar ﬁeld of En.
( In the latter two cases, we use the same terminology if ∗ En is replaced by some other (ﬁxed) normed space under consideration.)
The domain A may be arbitrary.
For such functions one can deﬁne various operations whenever they are de- ﬁned for elements of their ranges, to which the function values f(x) belong.
ThusasinChapter3, 9, wedeﬁnethefunctionsf g, fg,andf/g “pointwise,” § ± setting f f(x) (f g)(x) = f(x) g(x), (fg)(x) = f(x)g(x), and (x) = ± ± g g(x) (cid:16) (cid:17) whenever the right side expressions are deﬁned.
We also deﬁne f : A E1 | | → by ( x A) f (x) = f(x) .
∀ ∈ | | | | In particular, f g is deﬁned if f and g are both vector valued or both scalar ± valued, and fg is deﬁned if f is vector valued while g is scalar valued; similarly for f/g.
(However, the domain of f/g consists of those x A only for which ∈ g(x) = 0.)

So also is ∈ ± f/h, provided h(p) = 0; similarly for relative continuity over B A.

If the range space of f is En ( or Cn), then each function value f(x) is ∗ a vector in that space; thus it has n real ( respectively, complex) components, ∗ denoted f (x), k = 1, 2, ..., n. k Here we may treat f as a mapping of A = D into E1 ( or C); it carries k f ∗ each point x A into f (x), the kth component of f(x).
In this manner, each k ∈ function f: A En (Cn) → uniquely determines n scalar-valued maps f : A E1 (C), k → called the components of f. Notation: f = (f , ..., f ).
1 n Conversely, given n arbitrary functions f : A E1 (C), k = 1, 2, ..., n, k → one can deﬁne f: A En (Cn) by setting → f(x) = (f (x), f (x), ..., f (x)).

k Theorem 2 (componentwise continuity and limits).
For any function f: A → En (Cn), with A (S, ρ) and with f = (f , ..., f ), we have that 1 n ⊆ (i) f is continuous at p (p A) iﬀ all its components f are, and k ∈ (ii) f(x) q¯ as x p (p S) iﬀ → → ∈ f (x) q as x p (k = 1, 2, ..., n), k k → → i.e., iﬀ each f has, as its limit at p, the corresponding component of q¯.
k Similar results hold for relative continuity and limits over a path B A.
⊆ We prove (ii).
If f(x) q¯as x p then, by deﬁnition, → → n ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x A G (δ)) ε > f(x) q¯ = f (x) q 2; p k k ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ | − | s | − | k=1 X in turn, the right-hand side of the inequality given above is no less than each f (x) q , k = 1, 2, ..., n. k k | − | Thus ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x A G (δ)) f (x) q < ε; p k k ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ ¬ | − | i.e., f (x) q , k = 1, ..., n. k k → Conversely, if each f (x) q , then Theorem 1(ii) yields k k → n n e¯ f (x) e¯ q .1 k k k k → k=1 k=1 X X n By formula (1), then, f(x) q¯ (for e¯ q = q¯).

Rational Functions 173 § Example.
The complex exponential is the function f: E1 C deﬁned by → f(x) = cosx+i sinx, also written f(x) = exi.
· As we shall see later, the sine and the cosine functions are continuous.
Hence so is f by Theorem 2.
III.
Next, consider functions whose domain is a set in En ( or Cn).
We call ∗ them functions of n real ( or complex) variables, treating x¯ = (x , ..., x ) as ∗ 1 n a variable n-tuple.
The range space may be arbitrary.
In particular, a monomial in n variables is a map on En ( or Cn) given by ∗ a formula of the form n f(x¯) = axm1xm2 xmn = a xmk, 1 2 ··· n · k k=1 Y where the m are ﬁxed integers 0 and a E1 ( or a C).2 If a = 0, the k ∗ sum m = n m is called the d≥egree of th∈e monomial.∈Thus 6 k=1 k P f(x, y, z) = 3x2yz3 = 3x2y1z3 deﬁnes a monomial of degree 6, in three real (or complex) variables x, y, z.
(We often write x, y, z for x , x , x .)
1 2 3 A polynomial is any sum of a ﬁnite number of monomials; its degree is, by deﬁnition, that of its leading term, i.e., the one of highest degree.
(There may be several such terms, of equal degree.)
For example, f(x, y, z) = 3x2yz3 2xy7 − deﬁnes a polynomial of degree 8 in x, y, z. Polynomials of degree 1 are some- times called linear.
A rational function is the quotient f/g of two polynomials f and g on En ( or Cn).3 Its domain consists of those points at which g does not vanish.
For ∗ example, x2 3xy h(x, y) = − xy 1 − deﬁnes a rational function on points (x, y), with xy = 1.
Polynomials and 6 monomials are rational functions with denominator 1.
Theorem 3.
Any rational function (in particular, every polynomial) in one or several variables is continuous on all of its domain.
2We also allow a to be a vector, while the x are scalars.
k 3This is valid also if one allows the coeﬃcients of f to be vectors (provided those of g, and the variables x , remain scalars).
k Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation174 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity Proof.
Consider ﬁrst a monomial of the form f(x¯) = x (k ﬁxed); k it is called the kth projection map because it “projects” each x¯ En ( Cn) ∗ ∈ onto its kth component x .
k Given any ε > 0 and p¯, choose δ = ε.
Then n ( x¯ G (δ)) f(x¯) f(p¯) = x p x p 2 = ρ(x¯, p¯) < ε. p¯ k k i i ∀ ∈ | − | | − | ≤ | − | s i=1 X Hence by deﬁnition, f is continuous at each p¯.
Thus the theorem holds for projection maps.
However, any other monomial, given by f(x¯) = axm1xm2 xmn, 1 2 ··· n is the product of ﬁnitely many (namely of m = m +m + +m ) projection 1 2 n ··· maps multiplied by a constant a.
Thus by Theorem 1, it is continuous.
So also is any ﬁnite sum of monomials (i.e., any polynomial), and hence so is the quotient f/g of two polynomials (i.e., any rational function) wherever it is deﬁned, i.e., wherever the denominator does not vanish.
(cid:3) IV.
For functions on En ( or Cn), we often consider relative limits over a ∗ line of the form x¯ = p¯+t~e (parallel to the kth axis, through p¯); k see Chapter 3, 4–6, Deﬁnition 1.
If f is relatively continuous at p¯ over that §§ line, we say that f is continuous at p¯in the kth variable x (because the other k components of x¯ remain constant, namely, equal to those of p¯, as x¯ runs over that line).
Asopposed to this, wesay that f iscontinuous atp¯in all n variables jointly if it is continuous at p¯ in the ordinary (not relative) sense.
Similarly, we speak of limits in one variable, or in all of them jointly.
Since ordinary continuity implies relative continuity over any path, joint continuity in all n variables always implies that in each variable separately, but the converse fails (see Problems 9 and 10 below); similarly for limits at p¯.

↑ Let p E and B = x A x < p .
Put q = supf[B] (this sup always ∗ ∈ { ∈ | } exists in E ; see Chapter 2, 13).
We shall show that q is a left limit of f at p ∗ § (i.e., a left limit over B).
There are three possible cases: (1) If q is ﬁnite, any globe G is an interval (c, d), c < q < d, in E1.
As q c < q = supf[B], c cannot be an upper bound of f[B] (why?
), so c is exceeded by some f(x ), x B.
Thus 0 0 ∈ c < f(x ), x < p. 0 0 Hence as f , we certainly have ↑ c < f(x ) f(x) for all x > x (x B).
0 0 ≤ ∈ Moreover, as f(x) f[B], we have ∈ f(x) supf[B] = q < d, ≤ so c < f(x) < d; i.e., f(x) (c, d) = G .
q ∈ We have thus shown that ( G ) ( x < p) ( x B x < x) f(x) G , q 0 0 q ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ | ∈ so q is a left limit at p. (2) If q = + , the same proof works with G = (c, + ].

Monotone Functions 183 § i.e., f(x) , so f(x) = (constant) on B.
Hence q is also a left ≤ −∞ −∞ limit at p ( 1, Example (a)).
§ In particular, if f on A = (a, b) with a, b E and a < b, then B = ∗ ↑ ∈ (a, p) for p (a, b].
Here p is a cluster point of the path B (Chapter 3, 14, ∈ § Example (h)), so a unique left limit f(p ) exists.
By what was shown above, − q = f(p ) = supf[B] = sup f(x), as claimed.
− a<x<p Thus all is proved for left limits.
The proof for right limits is quite similar; one only has to set B = x A x > p , q = inff[B].
(cid:3) { ∈ | } Note 1.
The second clause of Theorem 1 holds even if (a, b) is only a subset of A, for the limits in question are not aﬀected by restricting f to (a, b).
(Why?)
The endpoints a and b may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
Note 2.
If D = A = N (the naturals), then by deﬁnition, f: N E is a f ∗ → sequence with general term x = f(m), m N (see 1, Note 2).
Then setting m ∈ § p = + in the proof of Theorem 1, we obtain Theorem 3 of Chapter 3, 15.
∞ § (Verify!)
Example.
The exponential function F : E1 E1 to the base a > 0 is given by → F(x) = ax.
It is monotone (Chapter 2, 11–12, formula (1)), so F(0 ) and F(0+) − §§ exist.
Bythesequentialcriterion(Theorem 1of 2), wemayuseasuitable § sequence to ﬁnd F(0+), and we choose x = 1 0+.
Then m m → 1 F(0+) = lim F = lim a1/m = 1 m m m →∞ →∞ (cid:16) (cid:17) (see Chapter 3, 15, Problem 20).

Thus m −m → − − F(0+) = F(0 ) = lim F(x) = lim ax = 1.

Function Limits and Continuity As lim F(x) = F(p), F is continuous at each p E1.
Thus all x p → ∈ exponentials are continuous.
Theorem 2.
If a function f: A E (A E ) is nondecreasing on a ﬁnite ∗ ∗ → ⊆ or inﬁnite interval B = (a, b) A and if p (a, b), then ⊆ ∈ f(a+) f(p ) f(p) f(p+) f(b ), (1) − − ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ and for no x (a, b) do we have ∈ f(p ) < f(x) < f(p) or f(p) < f(x) < f(p+);1 − similarly in case f (with all inequalities reversed).
↓ Proof.
By Theorem 1, f on (a, p) implies ↑ f(a+) = inf f(x) and f(p ) = sup f(x); − a<x<p a<x<p thus certainly f(a+) f(p ).
As f , we also have f(p) f(x) for all x − ≤ ↑ ≥ ∈ (a, p); hence f(p) sup f(x) = f(p ).
− ≥ a<x<p Thus f(a+) f(p ) f(p); − ≤ ≤ similarly for the rest of (1).
Moreover, if a < x < p, then f(x) f(p ) since − ≤ f(p ) = sup f(x).
− a<x<p If, however, p x < b, then f(p) f(x) since f .
Thus we never have ≤ ≤ ↑ f(p ) < f(x) < f(p).
Similarly, one excludes f(p) < f(x) < f(p+).
This − completes the proof.
(cid:3) Note 3.
If f(p ), f(p+), and f(p) exist (all ﬁnite), then − f(p) f(p ) and f(p+) f(p) − | − | | − | are called, respectively, the left and right jumps of f at p; their sum is the (total) jump at p. If f is monotone, the jump equals f(p+) f(p ) .
− | − | For a graphical example, consider Figure 14 in 1.
Here f(p) = f(p ) (both − § ﬁnite), so the left jump is 0.
However, f(p+) > f(p), so the right jump is greater than 0.
Since f(p) = f(p ) = lim f(x), − x p− → f is left continuous (but not right continuous) at p. 1In other words, the interval [f(p−), f(p+)] contains no f(x) except f(p).

Monotone Functions 185 § Theorem 3.
If f: A E is monotone on a ﬁnite or inﬁnite interval (a, b) ∗ → contained in A, then all its discontinuities in (a, b), if any, are “jumps,” that is, points p at which f(p ) and f(p+) exist, but f(p ) = f(p) or f(p+) = f(p).2 − − 6 6 Proof.
By Theorem 1, f(p ) and f(p+) exist at each p (a, b).
− ∈ If, in addition, f(p ) = f(p+) = f(p), then − lim f(x) = f(p) x p → by Corollary 3 of 1, so f is continuous at p. Thus discontinuities occur only if f(p ) = f(p) or§f(p+) = f(p).

Restate Theorem 3 for the case where f is monotone on A, where A is a (not necessarily open) interval.

§6.
Compact Sets We now pause to consider a very important kind of sets.
In Chapter 3, 16, we showed that every sequence z¯ taken from a closed interval [a¯, ¯b] in§En m { } must cluster in it (Note 1 of Chapter 3, 16).1 There are other sets with the § same remarkable property.
This leads us to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.
A set A (S, ρ) is said to be sequentially compact (brieﬂy compact) iﬀ ⊆ every sequence x A clusters at some point p in A. m { } ⊆ If all of S is compact, we say that the metric space (S, ρ) is compact.2 Examples.
(a) Each closed interval in En is compact (see above).
(a ) However, nonclosed intervals, and En itself, are not compact.
′ For example, the sequence x = 1/n is in (0, 1] E1, but clusters n ⊂ only at 0, outside (0, 1].
As another example, the sequence x = n has n no cluster points in E1.
Thus (0, 1] and E1 fail to be compact (even though E1 is complete); similarly for En ( and Cn).
∗ (b) Any ﬁnite set A (S, ρ) is compact.
Indeed, an inﬁnite sequence in such ⊆ a set must have at least one inﬁnitely repeating term p A.
Then by ∈ deﬁnition, this p is a cluster point (see Chapter 3, 14, Note 1).
§ (c) The empty set is “vacuously” compact (it contains no sequences).
(d) E is compact.
See Example (g) in Chapter 3, 14.
∗ § Other examples can be derived from the theorems that follow.
1Think of [a¯, ¯b] as of a container so “compact” that it “squeezes” into clustering any sequence that is inside it, and it supplies the cluster point.

Compact Sets 187 § Theorem 1.
If a set B (S, ρ) is compact, so is any closed subset A B.
⊆ ⊆ Proof.
We must show that each sequence x A clusters at some p A. m { } ⊆ ∈ However, as A B, x is also in B, so by the compactness of B, it clusters m ⊆ { } at some p B.
Thus it remains to show that p A as well.
∈ ∈ Now by Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, 16, x has a subsequence x p. § { m} mk → As x A and A is closed, this implies p A (Theorem 4 in Chapter 3, 16){.
m(cid:3)k} ⊆ ∈ § Theorem 2.
Every compact set A (S, ρ) is closed.
⊆ Proof.
Given that A is compact, we must show (by Theorem 4 in Chapter 3, 16) that A contains the limit of each convergent sequence x A. m § { } ⊆ Thus let x p, x A.
As A is compact, the sequence x clusters m m m → { } ⊆ { } at some q A, i.e., has a subsequence x q A.
However, the limit of the ∈ mk → ∈ subsequence must be the same as that of the entire sequence.
Thus p = q A; i.e., p is in A, as required.
(cid:3) ∈ Theorem 3.
Every compact set A (S, ρ) is bounded.
⊆ Proof.
By Problem 3 in Chapter 3, 13, it suﬃces to show that A is contained § in some ﬁnite union of globes.
Thus we ﬁx some arbitrary radius ε > 0 and, seeking a contradiction, assume that A cannot be covered by any ﬁnite number of globes of that radius.
Then if x A, the globe G (ε) does not cover A, so there is a point x A 1 ∈ x1 2 ∈ such that x / G (ε), i.e., ρ(x , x ) ε.
2 ∈ x1 1 2 ≥ By our assumption, A is not even covered by G (ε) G (ε).
Thus there is a x1 ∪ x2 point x A with 3 ∈ x / G (ε) and x / G (ε), i.e., ρ(x , x ) ε and ρ(x , x ) ε.
3 ∈ x1 3 ∈ x2 3 1 ≥ 3 2 ≥ Again, A is not covered by 3 G (ε), so there is a point x A not in that i=1 xi 4 ∈ union; its distances from x , x , and x must therefore be ε.
1 2 3 S ≥ Since A is never covered by any ﬁnite number of ε-globes, we can continue this process indeﬁnitely (by induction) and thus select an inﬁnite sequence x A, with all its terms at least ε-apart from each other.
m { } ⊆ Now as A is compact, this sequence must have a convergent subsequence x , which is then certainly Cauchy (by Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, 17).
This { mk} § is impossible, however, since its terms are at distances ε from each other, ≥ contrary to Deﬁnition 1 in Chapter 3, 17.
This contradiction completes the proof.
(cid:3) § Note 1.
We have actually proved more than was required, namely, that no matter how small ε > 0 is, A can be covered by ﬁnitely many globes of radius Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation188 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity ε with centers in A.
This property is called total boundedness (Chapter 3, 13, § Problem 4).
Note 2.
Thus all compact sets are closed and bounded.
The converse fails in metric spaces in general (see Problem 2 below).
In En ( and Cn), however, ∗ the converse is likewise true, as we show next.
Theorem 4.
In En ( and Cn) a set is compact iﬀ it is closed and bounded.
∗ Proof.
In fact, if a set A En ( Cn) is bounded, then by the Bolzano– ∗ ⊆ Weierstrass theorem, each sequence x A has a convergent subsequence m { } ⊆ x p. If A is also closed, the limit point p must belong to A itself.
mk → Thus each sequence x A clusters at some p in A, so A is compact.
m { } ⊆ The converse is obvious.
(cid:3) Note 3.
In particular, every closed globe in En ( or Cn) is compact since ∗ it is bounded and closed (Chapter 3, 12, Example (6)), so Theorem 4 applies.
§ We conclude with an important theorem, due to G. Cantor.
Theorem 5 (Cantor’s principle of nested closed sets).
Every contracting se- quence of nonvoid compact sets, F F F , 1 2 m ⊇ ⊇ ··· ⊇ ⊇ ··· in a metric space (S, ρ) has a nonvoid intersection; i.e., some p belongs to all F .
m For complete sets F , this holds as well, provided the diameters of the sets m F tend to 0: dF 0. m m → Proof.
We prove the theorem for complete sets ﬁrst.
As F = , we can pick a point x from each F to obtain a sequence m m m 6 ∅ x , x F .
Since dF 0, it is easy to see that x is a Cauchy m m m m m { } ∈ → { } sequence.
(The details are left to the reader.)
Moreover, ( m) x F F .
m m 1 ∀ ∈ ⊆ Thus x is a Cauchy sequence in F , a complete set (by assumption).
m 1 { } Therefore, by the deﬁnition of completeness (Chapter 3, 17), x has a m § { } limit p F .
This limit remains the same if we drop a ﬁnite number of terms, 1 ∈ say, the ﬁrst m 1 of them.
Then we are left with the sequence x , x , ..., m m+1 − which, by construction, is entirely contained in F (why?
), with the same limit m p. Then, however, the completeness of F implies that p F as well.
As m m m ∈ is arbitrary here, it follows that ( m) p F , i.e., m ∀ ∈ ∞ p F , as claimed.
m ∈ m=1 \ The proof for compact sets is analogous and even simpler.

Function Limits and Continuity ∗ §7.
More on Compactness Another useful approach to compactness is based on the notion of a covering of a set (already encountered in Problem 10 in 6).
We say that a set F is § covered by a family of sets G (i I) iﬀ i ∈ F G .
i ⊆ i I [∈ If this is the case, G is called a covering of F. If the sets G are open, we i i { } call the set family G an open covering.
The covering G is said to be ﬁnite i i { } { } (inﬁnite, countable, etc.)
iﬀ the number of the sets G is.
i If G is an open covering of F, then each point x F is in some G and is i i { } ∈ its interior point (for G is open), so there is a globe G (ε ) G .
In general, i x x i ⊆ the radii ε of these globes depend on x, i.e., are diﬀerent for diﬀerent points x x F. If, however, they can be chosen all equal to some ε, then this ε is called ∈ a Lebesgue number for the covering G (so named after Henri Lebesgue).
i { } Thus ε is a Lebesgue number iﬀ for every x F, the globe G (ε) is contained x ∈ in some G .
We now obtain the following theorem.
i Theorem 1 (Lebesgue).
Every open covering G of a sequentially compact j { } set F (S, ρ) has at least one Lebesgue number ε.
In symbols, ⊆ ( ε > 0) ( x F) ( i) G (ε) G .
(1) x i ∃ ∀ ∈ ∃ ⊆ Proof.
Seeking a contradiction, assume that (1) fails, i.e., its negation holds.
As was explained in Chapter 1, 1–3, this negation is §§ ( ε > 0) ( x F) ( i) G (ε) G ∀ ∃ ε ∈ ∀ xε 6⊆ i (where we write x for x since here x may depend on ε).
As this is supposed ε to hold for all ε > 0, we take successively 1 1 ε = 1, , ..., , .... 2 n Then, replacing “x ” by “x ” for convenience, we obtain ε n 1 ( n) ( x F) ( i) G * G .
(2) ∀ ∃ n ∈ ∀ xn n i (cid:16) (cid:17) Thus for each n, there is some x F such that the globe G (1) is not n ∈ xn n contained in any G .

xn n i This contradiction completes the proof.
(cid:3) Our next theorem might serve as an alternative deﬁnition of compactness.
In fact, in topology (which studies spaces more general than metric spaces), this is is the basic deﬁnition of compactness.
It generalizes Problem 10 in 6.
§ Theorem 2 (generalized Heine–Borel theorem).
A set F (S, ρ) is compact ⊆ iﬀ every open covering of F has a ﬁnite subcovering.
That is, whenever F is covered by a family of open sets G (i I), F can i ∈ also be covered by a ﬁnite number of these G .
i Proof.
Let F be sequentially compact, and let F G , all G open.
We i i ⊆ have to show that G reduces to a ﬁnite subcovering.
i { } S By Theorem 1, G has a Lebesgue number ε satisfying (1).
We ﬁx this i { } ε > 0.
Now by Note 1 in 6, we can cover F by a ﬁnite number of ε-globes, § n F G (ε), x F. ⊆ xk k ∈ k=1 [ Also by (1), each G (ε) is contained in some G ; call it G .
With the G so xk i ik ik ﬁxed, we have n n F G (ε) G .
⊆ xk ⊆ ik k=1 k=1 [ [ Thus the sets G constitute the desired ﬁnite subcovering, and the “only if” ik in the theorem is proved.
Conversely, assume the condition stated in the theorem.
We have to show that F is sequentially compact, i.e., that every sequence x F clusters at m { } ⊆ some p F. ∈ Seekinga contradiction, suppose F containsno cluster pointsof x .
Then m { } by deﬁnition, each point x F is in some globe G containing at most ﬁnitely x ∈ many x .
The set F is covered by these open globes, hence also by ﬁnitely m many of them (by our assumption).
Then, however, F contains at most ﬁnitely many x (namely, those contained in the so-selected globes), whereas the m Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation194 Chapter 4.

Continuity on Compact Sets.
Uniform Continuity I.
Some additional important theorems apply to functions that are contin- uous on a compact set (see 6).
§ Theorem 1.
If a function f: A (T, ρ ), A (S, ρ), is relatively continuous ′ → ⊆ on a compact set B A, then f[B] is a compact set in (T, ρ ).
Brieﬂy, ′ ⊆ the continuous image of a compact set is compact.
Proof.
To show that f[B] is compact, we take any sequence y f[B] and m { } ⊆ prove that it clusters at some q f[B].
∈ As y f[B], y = f(x ) for some x in B.
We pick such an x B for m m m m m ∈ ∈ each y , thus obtaining a sequence x B with m m { } ⊆ f(x ) = y , m = 1, 2, .... m m Now by the assumed compactness of B, the sequence x must cluster at m { } some p B.
Thus it has a subsequence x p. As p B, the function f ∈ mk → ∈ is relatively continuous at p over B (by assumption).
Hence by the sequential criterion ( 2), x p implies f(x ) f(p); i.e., § mk → mk → y f(p) f[B].
mk → ∈ Thus q = f(p) is the desired cluster point of y .
(cid:3) m { } This theorem can be used to prove the compactness of various sets.
Examples.
(1) A closed line segment L[a¯, ¯b] in En ( and in other normed spaces) is ∗ compact, for, by deﬁnition, ¯ ¯ L[a¯, b] = a¯+t~u 0 t 1 , where ~u = b a¯.
{ | ≤ ≤ } − Thus L[a¯, ¯b] is the image of the compact interval [0, 1] E1 under the ⊆ map f: E1 En, given by f(t) = a¯ + t~u, which is continuous by → Theorem 3 of 3.
(Why?)
§ (2) The closed solid ellipsoid in E3, x2 y2 z2 (x, y, z) + + 1 , a2 b2 c2 ≤ n (cid:12) o is compact, being the image(cid:12)of a compact globe under a suitable contin- (cid:12) uous map.

Continuity on Compact Sets.
Uniform Continuity 195 § Lemma 1.
Every nonvoid compact set F E1 has a maximum and a mini- ⊆ mum.
Proof.
By Theorems 2 and 3 of 6, F is closed and bounded.
Thus F has an § inﬁmum and a supremum in E1 (by the completeness axiom), say, p = infF and q = supF.
It remains to show that p, q F. ∈ Assume the opposite, say, q / F. Then by properties of suprema, each globe ∈ G (δ) = (q δ, q +δ) contains some x B (speciﬁcally, q δ < x < q) other q − ∈ − than q (for q / B, while x B).
Thus ∈ ∈ ( δ > 0) F G (δ) = ; q ∀ ∩ ¬ 6 ∅ i.e., F clusters at q and hence must contain q (being closed).
However, since q / F, this is the desired contradiction, and the lemma is proved.
(cid:3) ∈ The next theorem has many important applications in analysis.
Theorem 2 (Weierstrass).
(i) If a function f: A (T, ρ ) is relatively continuous on a compact set ′ → B A, then f is bounded on B; i.e., f[B] is bounded.
⊆ (ii) If, in addition, B = and f is real (f: A E1), then f[B] has a 6 ∅ → maximum and a minimum; i.e., f attains a largest and a least value at some points of B.
Proof.
Indeed, by Theorem 1, f[B] is compact, so it is bounded, as claimed in (i).
If further B = and f is real, then f[B] is a nonvoid compact set in E1, so by Lemma 1, it6 ha∅s a maximum and a minimum in E1.
Thus all is proved.
(cid:3) Note 1.
This and the other theorems of this section hold, in particular, if B is a closed interval in En or a closed globe in En ( or Cn) (because these ∗ sets are compact—see the examples in 6).
This may fail, however, if B is ¯ § not compact, e.g., if B = (a¯, b).
For a counterexample, see Problem 11 in Chapter 3, 13.
§ Theorem 3.
If a function f: A (T, ρ ), A (S, ρ), is relatively continuous ′ → ⊆ on a compact set B A and is one to one on B (i.e., when restricted to B), ⊆ then its inverse, f 1, is continuous on f[B].1 − Proof.
To show that f 1 is continuous at each point q f[B], we apply the − ∈ sequential criterion (Theorem 1 in 2).
Thus we ﬁx a sequence y f[B], m § { } ⊆ y q f[B], and prove that f 1(y ) f 1(q).
m − m − → ∈ → 1Note that f need not be one to one on all of its domain A, only on B.
Thus f−1 need not be a mapping on f[A], but it is one on f[B].
(We use “f−1” here to denote the inverse of f so restricted.)

Function Limits and Continuity Let f 1(y ) = x and f 1(q) = p so that − m m − y = f(x ), q = f(p), and x , p B. m m m ∈ We have to show that x p, i.e., that m → ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) ρ(x , p) < ε. m ∀ ∃ ∀ Seeking a contradiction, suppose this fails, i.e., its negation holds.
Then (see Chapter 1, 1–3) there is an ε > 0 such that §§ ( k) ( m > k) ρ(x ,p) ε, (1) ∀ ∃ k mk ≥ wherewewrite“m ”for“m”tostressthatthem maybediﬀerent fordiﬀerent k k k. Thus by (1), we ﬁx some m for each k so that (1) holds, choosing step by k step, m > m , k = 1, 2, .... k+1 k Then the x form a subsequence of x , and the corresponding y = mk { m} mk f(x ) form a subsequence of y .
Henceforth, for brevity, let x and mk { m} { m} y themselves denote these two subsequences.
Then as before, x B, m m { } ∈ y = f(x ) f[B], and y q, q = f(p).
Also, by (1), m m m ∈ → ( m) ρ(x ,p) ε (x stands for x ).
(2) ∀ m ≥ m mk Now as x B and B is compact, x has a (sub)subsequence m m { } ⊆ { } x p for some p B. mi → ′ ′ ∈ As f is relatively continuous on B, this implies f(x ) = y f(p ).
mi mi → ′ However, the subsequence y must have the same limit as y , i.e., f(p).
{ mi} { m} Thus f(p ) = f(p), whence p = p (for f is one to one on B), so x p = p. ′ ′ mi → ′ This contradicts (2), however, and thus the proof is complete.2 (cid:3) Examples (continued).
(3) For a ﬁxed n N, deﬁne f: [0, + ) E1 by ∈ ∞ → f(x) = xn.
Then f is one to one (strictly increasing) and continuous (being a mono- mial; see 3).
ThusbyTheorem3,f 1 (thenthrootfunction)isrelatively − § continuous on each interval f[[a, b]] = [an, bn], hence on [0, + ).

§ II.
Uniform Continuity.

(3) p ′ ∀ ∀ ∈ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ Here, in general, δ depends on both ε and p (see Problem 4 in 1); that is, given § ε > 0, some values of δ may ﬁt a given p but fail (3) for other points.
It may occur, however, that one and the same δ (depending on ε only) satisﬁes (3) for all p B simultaneously, so that we have the stronger formula ∈ ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( p, x B ρ(x, p) < δ) ρ (f(x), f(p)) < ε.3 (4) ′ ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ | Deﬁnition 1.
If (4) is true, we say that f is uniformly continuous on B.
Clearly, this implies (3), but the converse fails.4 Theorem 4.
If a function f: A (T, ρ ), A (S, ρ), is relatively continuous ′ → ⊆ on a compact set B A, then f is also uniformly continuous on B.
⊂ Proof (by contradiction).
Suppose f is relatively continuous on B, but (4) fails.
Then there is an ε > 0 such that ( δ > 0) ( p, x B) ρ(x, p) < δ, and yet ρ (f(x), f(p)) ε; ′ ∀ ∃ ∈ ≥ here p and x depend on δ.
We ﬁx such an ε and let 1 1 δ = 1, , ..., , .... 2 m Then for each δ (i.e., each m), we get two points x , p B with m m ∈ 1 ρ(x , p ) < (5) m m m and ρ (f(x ), f(p )) ε, m = 1, 2,.... (6) ′ m m ≥ Thus we obtain two sequences, x and p , in B.
As B is compact, m m { } { } x has a subsequence x q (q B).
For simplicity, let it be x itself; { m} mk → ∈ { m} thus x q, q B. m → ∈ 3In other words, f(x) and f(p) are ε-close for any p, x B with ρ(p, x)<δ.

Function Limits and Continuity Hence by (5), it easily follows that also p q (because ρ(x , p ) 0; see m m m → → Problem 4 in Chapter 3, 17).
By the assumed relative continuity of f on B, § it follows that f(x ) f(q) and f(p ) f(q) in (T, ρ ).
m m ′ → → This, in turn, implies that ρ (f(x ), f(p )) 0, which is impossible, in view ′ m m of (6).
This contradiction completes the proo→f.
(cid:3) One type of uniformly continuous functions are so-called contraction map- pings.
Wedeﬁne theminExample(a)below andhence deriveafew noteworthy special cases.
Some of them are so-called isometries (see Problems, footnote 5).
Examples.
(a) A function f: A (T, ρ ), A (S, ρ), is called a contraction map (on ′ → ⊆ A) iﬀ ρ(x, y) ρ (f(x), f(y)) for all x, y A.
′ ≥ ∈ Any such map is uniformly continuous on A.
In fact, given ε > 0, we simply take δ = ε.
Then ( x, p A) ∀ ∈ ρ(x, p) < δ implies ρ (f(x), f(p)) ρ(x, p) < δ = ε, ′ ≤ as required in (3).
(b) As a special case, consider the absolute value map (norm map) given by f(x¯) = x¯ on En ( or another normed space).
∗ | | It is uniformly continuous on En because x¯ p¯ x¯ p¯, i.e., ρ (f(x¯), f(p¯)) ρ(x¯, p¯), ′ | |−| | ≤ | − | ≤ (cid:12) (cid:12) which sho(cid:12)ws that(cid:12)f is a contraction map, so Example (a) applies.
(c) Other examples of contraction maps are (1) constant maps (see 1, Example (a)) and § (2) projection maps (see the proof of Theorem 3 in 3).

Geometrically, if A E1, this means that the curve y = f(x) meets all ⊆ horizontal lines y = q, for q between f(p) and f(p ).
For example, in Figure 13 1 in 1, we have a “smooth” curve that cuts each horizontal line y = q between § f(0) and f(p ); so f has the Darboux property on [0, p ].

The Intermediate Value Property 205 § Lemma 1 (principle of nested line segments).
Every contracting sequence of closed line segments L[p¯ , q¯ ] in En ( or in any other normed space) has a m m ∗ nonvoid intersection; i.e., there is a point ∞ p¯ L[p¯ , q¯ ].
m m ∈ m=1 \ Proof.
Use Cantor’s theorem (Theorem 5 of 6) and Example (1) in 8.
(cid:3) § § We are now ready for Bolzano’s theorem.
The proof to be used is typical of so-called “bisection proofs.” (See also 6, Problems 9 and 10 for such proofs.)
§ Theorem 1.
If f: B E1 is relatively continuous on a polygon-connected → set B in En ( or in another normed space), then f has the Darboux property ∗ on B.
In particular, if B is convex and if f(p¯) < c < f(q¯) for some p¯, q¯ B, then ∈ there is a point r¯ L(p¯, q¯) such that f(r¯) = c. ∈ Proof.
First, let B be convex.
Seeking a contradiction, suppose p¯, q¯ B with ∈ f(p¯) < c < f(q¯), yet f(x¯) = c for all x¯ L(p¯, q¯).
6 ∈ Let P be the set of all those x¯ L[p¯, q¯] for which f(x¯) < c, i.e., ∈ P = x¯ L[p¯, q¯] f(x¯) < c , { ∈ | } and let Q = x¯ L[p¯, q¯] f(x¯) > c .
{ ∈ | } Then p¯ P, q¯ Q, P Q = , and P Q = L[p¯, q¯] B.
(Why?)
∈ ∈ ∩ ∅ ∪ ⊆ Now let 1 r¯ = (p¯+q¯) 0 2 be the midpoint on L[p¯, q¯].
Clearly, r¯ is either in P or in Q.
Thus it bisects 0 L[p¯, q¯] into two subsegments, one of which must have its left endpoint in P and its right endpoint in Q.2 We denote this particular closed segment by L[p¯ , q¯ ], p¯ P, q¯ Q.
We 1 1 1 1 ∈ ∈ then have 1 L[p¯ , q¯ ] L[p¯, q¯] and p q = p¯ q¯.
(Verify!)
1 1 1 1 ⊆ | − | 2| − | Now we bisect L[p¯ , q¯ ] and repeat the process.
Thus let 1 1 1 r¯ = (p¯ +q¯ ).

If r¯ Q, take L[p¯, r¯ ].

Continuing this process indeﬁnitely, we 2 2 obtain an inﬁnite contracting sequence of closed line segments L[p¯ , q¯ ] such m m that ( m) p¯ P, q¯ Q, m m ∀ ∈ ∈ and 1 p¯ q¯ = p¯ q¯ 0 as m + .

m m ∈ m=1 \ This implies that ( m) r¯ p¯ p¯ q¯ 0, m m m ∀ | − | ≤ | − | → whence p¯ r¯.
Similarly, we obtain q¯ r¯.
m m → → Now since r¯ L[p¯, q¯] B, the function f is relatively continuous at r¯ over ∈ ⊆ B (by assumption).
By the sequential criterion, then, f(p¯ ) f(r¯) and f(q¯ ) f(r¯).
m m → → Moreover, f(p¯ ) < c < f(q¯ ) (for p¯ P and q¯ Q).
Letting m + , m m m m ∈ ∈ → ∞ we pass to limits (Chapter 3, 15, Corollary 1) and get § f(r¯) c f(r¯), ≤ ≤ so that r¯ is neither in P nor in Q, which is a contradiction.
This completes the proof for a convex B.
The extension to polygon-connected sets is left as an exercise (see Problem 2 below).
Thus all is proved.
(cid:3) Note 2.
In particular, the theorem applies if B is a globe or an interval.
Thus continuity on an interval implies the Darboux property.
The converse fails, as we have noted.
However, for monotone functions, we obtain the fol- lowing theorem.
Theorem 2.
If a function f: A E1 is monotone and has the Darboux → property on a ﬁnite or inﬁnite interval (a, b) A E1, then it is continuous ⊆ ⊆ on (a, b).
Proof.
Seeking a contradiction, suppose f is discontinuous at some p (a, b).
∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation9.
The Intermediate Value Property 207 § For deﬁniteness, let f on (a, b).
Then by Theorems 2 and 3 in 5, we ↑ § have either f(p ) < f(p) or f(p) < f(p+) or both, with no function values in − between.
On the other hand, since f has the Darboux property, the function values f(x) for x in (a, b) ﬁll an entire interval (see Note 1).
Thus it is impossible for f(p) to be the only function value between f(p ) and f(p+) unless f is − constant near p, but then it is also continuous at p, which we excluded.
This contradiction completes the proof.3 (cid:3) Note 3.
The theorem holds (with a similar proof) for nonopen intervals as well, but the continuity at the endpoints is relative (right at a, left at b).
Theorem 3.
If f: A E1 is strictly monotone and continuous when re- → stricted to a ﬁnite or inﬁnite interval B A E1, then its inverse f 1 has − ⊆ ⊆ the same properties on the set f[B] (itself an interval, by Note 1 and Theo- rem 1).4 Proof.
It is easy to see that f 1 is increasing (decreasing) if f is; the proof is − left as an exercise.
Thus f 1 is monotone on f[B] if f is so on B.
To prove − the relative continuity of f 1, we use Theorem 2, i.e., show that f 1 has the − − Darboux property on f[B].
Thus let f 1(p) < c < f 1(q) for some p, q f[B].
We look for an r f[B] − − ∈ ∈ such that f 1(r) = c, i.e., r = f(c).
Now since p, q f[B], the numbers f 1(p) − − ∈ and f 1(q) are in B, an interval.
Hence also the intermediate value c is in B; − thus it belongs to the domain of f, and so the function value f(c) exists.
It thus suﬃces to put r = f(c) to get the result.
(cid:3) Examples.
(a) Deﬁne f: E1 E1 by → f(x) = xn for a ﬁxed n N. ∈ As f is continuous (being a monomial), it has the Darboux property on E1.
By Note 1, setting B = [0, + ), we have f[B] = [0, + ).
∞ ∞ (Why?)
Also, f is strictly increasing on B.
Thus by Theorem 3, the inverse function f 1 (i.e., the nth root function) exists and is continuous − on f[B] = [0, + ).
∞ If n is odd, then f 1 has these properties on all of E1, by a similar − proof; thus √n x exists for x E1.

By the Darboux ↑ { | } § property, f(x)=c for some x (a, b), but this contradicts Theorem 2 in 5.

Function Limits and Continuity nential function given by F(x) = ax (a > 0) is continuous and strictly monotone on E1.5 Its inverse, F 1, is called − the logarithmic function to the base a, denoted log .
By Theorem 3, it is a continuous and strictly monotone on F[E1].
To ﬁx ideas, let a > 1, so F and (F 1) .
By Note 1, F[E1] is an − ↑ ↑ interval with endpoints p and r, where p = infF[E1] = inf ax < x < + { | −∞ ∞} and r = supF[E1] = sup ax < x < + .
{ | −∞ ∞} Now by Problem 14(iii) of 2 (with q = 0), § lim ax = + and lim ax = 0. x + ∞ x → ∞ →−∞ As F , we use Theorem 1 in 5 to obtain ↑ § r = supax = lim ax = + and p = lim ax = 0. x + ∞ x → ∞ →−∞ Thus F[E1], i.e., the domain of log , is the interval (p, r) = (0, + ).
It a ∞ follows that log x is uniquely deﬁned for x in (0, + ); it is called the a ∞ logarithm of x to the base a.
The range of log (i.e.
of F 1) is the same as the domain of F, i.e., E1.
a − Thus if a > 1, log x increases from to + as x increases from 0 to a −∞ ∞ + .
Hence ∞ lim log x = + and lim log x = , x + a ∞ x 0+ a −∞ → ∞ → provided a > 1.
If 0 < a < 1, the values of these limits are interchanged (since F in ↓ this case), but otherwise the results are the same.
If a = e, we write lnx or logx for log x, and we call lnx the natural a logarithm of x.
Its inverse is, of course, the exponential f(x) = ex, also written exp(x).
Thus by deﬁnition, lnex = x and x = exp(lnx) = elnx (0 < x < + ).

For x > 0, we have xa = exp(lnxa) = exp(a lnx).
· Thus by the rules for composite functions (Theorem 3 and Corollary 2 in 2), the continuity of g on (0, + ) follows from that of exponential and § ∞ log functions.

Connected Sets 211 § §10.
Arcs and Curves.
Connected Sets A deeper insight into continuity and the Darboux property can be gained by generalizing the notions of a convex set and polygon-connected set to obtain so-called connected sets.
I.
As a ﬁrst step, we consider arcs and curves.
Deﬁnition 1.
A set A (S, ρ) is called an arc iﬀ A is a continuous image of a compact ⊆ interval [a, b] E1, i.e., iﬀ there is a continuous mapping ⊂ f: [a, b] A.
−on→to If, in addition, f is one to one, A is called a simple arc with endpoints f(a) and f(b).
If instead f(a) = f(b), we speak of a closed curve.
A curve is a continuous image of any ﬁnite or inﬁnite interval in E1.
Corollary 1.
Each arc is a compact (hence closed and bounded) set (by Theorem 1 of 8).
§ Deﬁnition 2.
A set A (S, ρ) is said to be arcwise connected iﬀ every two points ⊆ p, q A are in some simple arc contained in A.
(We then also say the p ∈ and q can be joined by an arc in A.)
Examples.
(a) Every closed line segment L[a¯, ¯b] in En ( or in any other normed space) ∗ is a simple arc (consider the map f in Example (1) of 8).
§ (b) Every polygon m 1 − A = L[p¯, p¯ ] i i+1 i=0 [ is an arc (see Problem 18 in 8).
It is a simple arc if the half-closed § segments L[p¯, p¯ ) do not intersect and the points p¯ are distinct, for i i+1 i then the map f in Problem 18 of 8 is one to one.
§ (c) It easily follows that every polygon-connected set is also arcwise con- nected; one only has to show that every polygon joining two points p¯ , p¯ 0 m can be reduced to a simple polygon (not a self-intersecting one).
See Problem 2.
However, the converse is false.
For example, two discs in E2 connected by a parabolic arc form together an arcwise- (but not polygonwise-) con- nected set.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation212 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity (d) Let f , f , ..., f be real continuous functions on an interval I E1.
1 2 n ⊆ Treat them as components of a function f: I En, → f = (f , ..., f ).
1 n Then f is continuous by Theorem 2 in 3.
Thus the image set f[I] is a § curve in En; it is an arc if I is a closed interval.
Introducing a parameter t varying over I, we obtain the parametric equations of the curve, namely, x = f (t), k = 1, 2, ..., n. k k Then as t varies over I, the point x¯ = (x , ..., x ) describes the curve 1 n f[I].
This is the usual way of treating curves in En ( and Cn).
∗ It is not hard to show that Theorem 1 in 9 holds also if B is only arcwise § connected (see Problem 3 below).
However, much more can be proved by introducing the general notion of a connected set.
We do this next.
II.
For this topic, we shall need Theorems 2–4 of Chapter 3, 12, and ∗ § Problem 15 of Chapter 4, 2.
The reader is advised to review them.
In partic- § ular, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
A function f: (A, ρ) (T, ρ ) is continuous on A iﬀ f 1[B] is ′ − → closed in (A, ρ) for each closed set B (T, ρ ); similarly for open sets.
′ ⊆ Indeed, this is part of Problem 15 in 2 with (S, ρ) replaced by (A, ρ).
§ Deﬁnition 3.
A metric space (S, ρ) is said to be connected iﬀ S is not the union P Q ∪ of any two nonvoid disjoint closed sets; it is disconnected otherwise.1 Aset A (S, ρ)iscalledconnectediﬀ(A, ρ)isconnectedas a subspace ⊆ of (S, ρ); i.e., iﬀ A is not a union of two disjoint sets P, Q = that are 6 ∅ closed (hence also open) in (A, ρ), as a subspace of (S, ρ).
Note 1.
By Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, 12, this means that § P = A P and Q = A Q 1 1 ∩ ∩ for some sets P , Q that are closed in (S, ρ).
Observe that, unlike compact 1 1 sets, a set that is closed or open in (A, ρ) need not be closed or open in (S, ρ).
Examples.
(a ) is connected.
′ ∅ (b ) So is any one-point set p .
(Why?)
′ { } 1The term “closed” may be replaced by “open” here, for P and Q are open as well, each being the complement of the other closed set.
Similarly,if they are open, they are both open and closed (brieﬂy, “clopen”).

Arcs and Curves.
Connected Sets 213 § (c ) Any ﬁnite set of two or more points is disconnected.
(Why?)
′ Other examples are provided by the theorems that follow.
Theorem 2.
The only connected sets in E1 are exactly all convex sets, i.e., ﬁ- nite and inﬁnite intervals, including E1 itself.
Proof.
The proof that such intervals are exactly all convex sets in E1 is left as an exercise.
We now show that each connected set A E1 is convex, i.e., that a, b A ⊆ ∈ implies (a, b) A.
⊆ Seeking a contradiction, suppose p / A for some p (a, b), a, b A.
Let ∈ ∈ ∈ P = A ( , p) and Q = A (p, + ).
∩ −∞ ∩ ∞ Then A = P Q, a P, b Q, and P Q = .
Moreover, ( , p) and ∪ ∈ ∈ ∩ ∅ −∞ (p, + ) are open sets in E1.
(Why?)
Hence P and Q are open in A, each ∞ being the intersection of A with a set open in E1 (see Note 1 above).
As A = P Q, with P Q = , it follows that A is disconnected.
This shows that ∪ ∩ ∅ if A is connected in E1, it must be convex.
Conversely, let A be convex in E1.
The proof that A is connected is an almost exact copy of the proof given for Theorem 1 of 9, so we only brieﬂy § sketch it here.2 If A were disconnected, then A = P Q for some disjoint sets P, Q = , ∪ 6 ∅ both closed in A.
Fix any p P and q Q.
Exactly as in Theorem 1 of 9, ∈ ∈ § select a contracting sequence of line segments (intervals) [p , q ] A such m m ⊆ that p P, q Q, and p q 0, and obtain a point m m m m ∈ ∈ | − | → ∞ r [p , q ] A, m m ∈ ⊆ m=1 \ so that p r, q r, and r A.
As the sets P and Q are closed in m m → → ∈ (A, ρ), Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, 16 shows that both P and Q must contain the § common limit r of the sequences p P and q Q.
This is impossible, m m { } ⊆ { } ⊆ however, since P Q = , by assumption.
This contradiction shows that A cannot be disconn∩ected.
T∅hus all is proved.
(cid:3) Note 2.
By the same proof, any convex set in a normed space is connected.
In particular, En and all other normed spaces are connected themselves.3 Theorem 3.
If a function f: A (T, ρ ) with A (S, ρ) is relatively con- ′ → ⊆ tinuous on a connected set B A, then f[B] is a connected set in (T, ρ ).4 ′ ⊆ 2Note that the same proof holds also for A in any normed space.
3See also Corollary 3 below (note that it presupposes Corollary 2, hence Theorem 2).
4Brieﬂy, any continuous image of a connected set is connected itself.

Function Limits and Continuity Proof.
By deﬁnition ( 1), relative continuity on B becomes ordinary continu- § ity when f is restricted to B.
Thus we may treat f as a mapping of B into f[B], replacing S and T by their subspaces B and f[B].
Seeking a contradiction, suppose f[B] is disconnected, i.e., f[B] = P Q ∪ for some disjoint sets P, Q = closed in (f[B], ρ ).
Then by Theorem 1, with ′ 6 ∅ T replaced by f[B], the sets f 1[P] and f 1[Q] are closed in (B, ρ).
They also − − are nonvoid and disjoint (as are P and Q) and satisfy B = f 1[P Q] = f 1[P] f 1[Q] − − − ∪ ∪ (see Chapter 1, 4–7, Problem 6).
Thus B is disconnected, contrary to as- sumption.
(cid:3) §§ Corollary 2.
All arcs and curves are connected sets (by Deﬁnition 2 and Theorems 2 and 3).
Lemma 1.
A set A (S, ρ) is connected iﬀ any two points p, q A are in ⊆ ∈ some connected subset B A.
Hence any arcwise connected set is connected.
⊆ Proof.
Seeking a contradiction, suppose the condition stated in Lemma 1 holds but A is disconnected, so A = P Q for some disjoint sets P = , Q = , ∪ 6 ∅ 6 ∅ both closed in (A, ρ).
Pick any p P and q Q.
By assumption, p and q are in some connected ∈ ∈ set B A.
Treat (B, ρ) as a subspace of (A, ρ), and let ⊆ P = B P and Q = B Q.
′ ′ ∩ ∩ Then by Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, 12, P and Q are closed in B.
Also, they ′ ′ § are disjoint (for P and Q are) and nonvoid (for p P , q Q ), and ′ ′ ∈ ∈ B = B A = B (P Q) = (B P) (B Q) = P Q .
′ ′ ∩ ∩ ∪ ∩ ∪ ∩ ∪ Thus B is disconnected, contrary to assumption.
This contradiction proves the lemma (the converse proof is trivial).
In particular, if A is arcwise connected, then any points p, q in A are in some arc B A, a connected set by Corollary 2.
Thus all is proved.
(cid:3) ⊆ Corollary 3.
Any convex or polygon-connected set (e.g., a globe) in En (or in any other normed space) is arcwise connected, hence connected.
Proof.
Use Lemma 1 and Example (c) in part I of this section.
(cid:3) Caution: The converse fails.
A connected set need not be arcwise connected, let alone polygon connected (see Problem 17).
However, we have the following theorem.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation10.
Arcs and Curves.
Connected Sets 215 § Theorem 4.
Every open connected set A in En ( or in another normed space) ∗ is also arcwise connected and even polygon connected.
Proof.
If A = , this is “vacuously” true, so let A = and ﬁx a¯ A.
∅ 6 ∅ ∈ Let P be the set of all p¯ A that can be joined with a¯ by a polygon K A.
∈ ⊆ Let Q = A P. Clearly, a¯ P, so P = .
We shall show that P is open, − ∈ 6 ∅ i.e., that each p¯ P is in a globe G P. p¯ ∈ ⊆ Thus we ﬁx any p¯ P. As A is open and p¯ A, there certainly is a globe ∈ ∈ G contained in A.
Moreover, as G is convex, each point x¯ G is joined p¯ p¯ p¯ ∈ with p¯by the line segment L[x¯, p¯] G .
Also, as p¯ P, some polygon K A p¯ ⊆ ∈ ⊆ joins p¯ with a¯.
Then K L[x¯, p¯] ∪ is a polygon joining x¯ and a¯, and hence by deﬁnition x¯ P. Thus each x¯ G p¯ ∈ ∈ is in P, so that G P, as required, and P is open (also open in A as a p¯ ⊆ subspace).
Next, we show that the set Q = A P is open as well.
As before, if Q = , − 6 ∅ ﬁx any q¯ Q and a globe G A, and show that G Q.
Indeed, if some q¯ q¯ ∈ ⊆ ⊆ x¯ G were not in Q, it would be in P, and thus it would be joined with a¯ q¯ ∈ (ﬁxed above) by a polygon K A.
Then, however, q¯ itself could be so joined ⊆ by the polygon L[q¯, x¯] K, ∪ implying that q¯ P, not q¯ Q.
This shows that G Q indeed, as claimed.
q¯ ∈ ∈ ⊂ Thus A = P Q with P, Q disjoint and open (hence clopen) in A.
The ∪ connectedness of A then implies that Q = .
(P is not empty, as has been ∅ ¯ noted.)
Hence A = P. By the deﬁnition of P, then, each point b A can be joined to a¯ by a polygon.
As a¯ A was arbitrary, A is polygon con∈nected.
(cid:3) ∈ Finally, we obtain a stronger version of the intermediate value theorem.
Theorem 5.
If a function f: A E1 is relatively continuous on a connected → set B A (S, ρ), then f has the Darboux property on B.

Product Spaces.
Double and Iterated Limits Given two metric spaces (X, ρ ) and (Y, ρ ), we may consider the Cartesian 1 2 product X Y, suitably metrized.
Two metrics for X Y are suggested in × × Problem 10 in Chapter 3, 11.
We shall adopt the ﬁrst of them as follows.
§ Deﬁnition 1.
By the product of two metric spaces (X, ρ ) and (Y, ρ ) is meant the 1 2 space (X Y, ρ), where the metric ρ is deﬁned by × ρ((x, y), (x , y )) = max ρ (x, x ), ρ (y, y ) (1) ′ ′ 1 ′ 2 ′ { } for x, x X and y, y Y.
′ ′ ∈ ∈ Thusthe distance between(x, y) and (x , y ) is the larger of the two distances ′ ′ ρ (x, x ) in X and ρ (y, y ) in Y.
1 ′ 2 ′ The veriﬁcation that ρ in (1) is, indeed, a metric is left to the reader.
We now obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
(i) A globe G (ε) in (X Y, ρ) is the Cartesian product of the correspond- (p,q) × ing ε-globes in X and Y, G (ε) = G (ε) G (ε).
(p,q) p q × (ii) Convergence of sequences (x , y ) in X Y is componentwise.
That m m { } × is, we have (x , y ) (p, q) in X Y iﬀ x p in X and y q in Y. m m m m → × → → Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation∗ 11.
Product Spaces.
Double and Iterated Limits 219 § Again, the easy proof is left as an exercise.
In this connection, recall that by Theorem 2 of Chapter 3, 15, convergence § in E2 is componentwise as well, even though the standard metric in E2 is not the product metric (1); it is rather the metric (ii) of Problem 10 in Chapter 3, 11.
We might have adopted this second metric for X Y as well.
Then part § × (i) of Theorem 1 would fail, but part (ii) would still follow by making ε ε ρ (x , p) < and ρ (y , q) < .
1 m 2 m √2 √2 It follows that, as far as convergence is concerned, the two choices of ρ are equivalent.
Note 1.
More generally, two metrics for a space S are said to be equivalent iﬀexactlythesamesequences converge (tothesamelimits)under bothmetrics.
Then also all function limitsare the same since they reduce to sequential limits, by Theorem 1 of 2; similarly for such notions as continuity, compactness, § completeness, closedness, openness, etc.
In view of this, we shall often call X Y a product space (in the wider sense) × even if its metric is not the ρ of formula (1) but equivalent to it.
In this sense, E2 is the product space E1 E1, and X Y is its generalization.
× × Various ideas valid in E2 extend quite naturally to X Y.
Thus functions × deﬁned on a set A X Y may be treated as functions of two variables x, ⊆ × y such that (x, y) A.
Given (p, q) X Y, we may consider ordinary or ∈ ∈ × relative limits at (p, q), e.g., limits over a path B = (x, y) X Y y = q { ∈ × | } (brieﬂy called the “line y = q”).
In this case, y remains ﬁxed (y = q) while x p; we then speak of limits and continuity in one variable x, as opposed to → those in both variables jointly, i.e., the ordinary limits (cf.
3, part IV).
§ Some other kinds of limits are to be deﬁned below.
For simplicity, we con- sider only functions f: (X Y) (T, ρ ) deﬁned on all of X Y.
If confusion ′ × → × is unlikely, we write ρ for all metrics involved (such as ρ in T).
Below, p and q ′ always denote cluster points of X and Y, respectively (this justiﬁes the “lim” notation).
Of course, our deﬁnitions apply in particular to E2 as the simplest special case of X Y.
× Deﬁnition 2.
A function f: (X Y) (T, ρ ) is said to have the double limit s T ′ × → ∈ at (p, q), denoted s = lim f(x, y), x p y→q → iﬀ for each ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that f(x, y) G (ε) whenever s ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation220 Chapter 4.

Then we would have ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( (x,y) G (δ)) f(x, y) G (ε).

(4) q ∀ ∈ ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ¬ Here, in general, δ depends on both ε and x.
However, in some cases (re- sembling uniform continuity), one and the same δ (depending on ε only) ﬁts all choices of x from B.
This suggests the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.
With the previous notation, suppose lim f(x, y) = g(x) exists for each x B (B X).
y q ∈ ⊆ → We say that this limit is uniform in x (on B), and we write “g(x) = lim f(x, y) (uniformly for x B),” y q ∈ → iﬀ for each ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that ρ(g(x), f(x, y)) < ε for all x B and all y G (δ).

Double and Iterated Limits 221 § Usually, the set B in formulas (4) and (5) is a deleted neighborhood of p in X, e.g., B = G (r), or B = X p .
p ¬ −{ } Assume (4) for such a B, so lim f(x, y) = g(x) exists for each x B. y q ∈ → If, in addition, lim g(x) = s x p → exists, we call s the iterated limit of f at (p, q) (ﬁrst in y, then in x), denoted lim lim f(x, y).
x py q → → This limit is obtained by ﬁrst letting y q (with x ﬁxed) and then letting → x p. Quite similarly, we deﬁne → lim lim f(x, y).
y qx p → → In general, the two iterated limits (if they exist) are diﬀerent, and their existence does not imply that of the double limit (2), let alone (3), nor does it imply the equality of all these limits.
(See Problems 4ﬀ below.)
However, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 2 (Osgood).
Let (T, ρ ) be complete.
Assume the existence of the ′ following limits of the function f: X Y T: × → (i) lim f(x, y) = g(x) (uniformly for x X p ) and y q ∈ −{ } → (ii) lim f(x, y) = h(y) for y Y q .1 x p ∈ −{ } → Then the double limit and the two iterated limits of f at (p, q) exist and all three coincide.
Proof.
Let ε > 0.
By our assumption (i), there is a δ > 0 such that ε ( x X p ) ( y G (δ)) ρ(g(x), f(x,y)) < (cf.
(5)).

Double and Iterated Limits 223 § (Chapter 1, 9).
Writing m and n for x and y, and u for f(x, y), we then mn § obtain Osgood’s theorem for double sequences (also called the Moore–Smith theorem) as follows.
Theorem 2 .
Let u be a double sequence in a complete space (T, ρ ).
If ′ mn ′ { } lim u = q exists for each m mn m n →∞ and if lim u = p (uniformly in n) likewise exists, mn n m →∞ then the double limit and the two iterated limits of u exist and mn { } lim u = lim lim u = lim lim u .
mn mn mn m n m m n n→∞ →∞ →∞ →∞ →∞ →∞ Here the assumption that lim u = p (uniformly in n) means, by m mn n →∞ (5), that ( ε > 0) ( k) ( n) ( m > k) ρ(u , p ) < ε.
(7) mn n ∀ ∃ ∀ ∀ Similarly, the statement “ lim u = s” (see (2)) is tantamount to mn m n→∞ →∞ ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m, n > k) ρ(u , s) < ε.
(8) mn ∀ ∃ ∀ Note 4.
Given any sequence x (S, ρ), we may consider the double m { } ⊆ limit lim ρ(x , x ) in E1.
By using (8), one easily sees that m n m n→∞ →∞ lim ρ(x , x ) = 0 m n m n→∞ →∞ iﬀ ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m, n > k) ρ(x , x ) < ε, m n ∀ ∃ ∀ i.e., iﬀ x is a Cauchy sequence.
Thus Cauchy sequences are those for which m { } lim ρ(x , x ) = 0. m n m n→∞ →∞ Theorem 3.
In every metric space (S, ρ), the metric ρ: (S S) E1 is a × → continuous function on the product space S S. × Proof.

Function Limits and Continuity depends on ε only; i.e., given ε > 0, one and the same k ﬁts all x in B.

(2) ′ m ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∀ Of course, (2) implies (1), but the converse fails (see examples below).
This suggests the following deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1.
With the above notation, we call f the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions f on a set B (B A) iﬀ m ⊆ f(x) = lim f (x) for all x in B; m m →∞ i.e., formula (1) holds.
We then write f f (pointwise) on B. m → In case (2), we call the limit uniform (on B) and write f f (uniformly) on B. m → II.
If the f are real, complex, or vector valued ( 3), we can also deﬁne m m § s = f (= sum of the ﬁrst m functions) for each m, so m k=1 k m P ( x A) ( m) s (x) = f (x).
m k ∀ ∈ ∀ k=1 X The s form a new sequence of functions on A.
The pair of sequences m ( f , s ) m m { } { } is called the (inﬁnite) series with general term f ; s is called its mth partial m m sum.
The series is often denoted by symbols like f , f (x), etc.
m m Deﬁnition 2.
P P The series f on A is said to converge (pointwise or uniformly) to a m function f on a set B A iﬀ the sequence s of its partial sums does m P ⊆ { } as well.
We then call f the sum of the series and write ∞ ∞ f(x) = f (x) or f = f = lims k m m k=1 m=1 X X (pointwise or uniformly) on B.
Note that series of constants, c , may be treated as series of constant m functions f , with f (x) = c for x A. m m m P ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation12.
Sequences and Series of Functions 229 § If the range space is E1 or E , we also consider inﬁnite limits, ∗ lim f (x) = .
m m ±∞ →∞ However, a series for which ∞ f = lims m m m=1 X is inﬁnite for some x is regarded as divergent (i.e., not convergent) at that x. III.
Since convergence of series reduces to that of sequences s , we shall m { } ﬁrst of all consider sequences.
The following is a simple and useful test for uniform convergence of sequences f : A (T, ρ ).
m ′ → Theorem 1.
Given a sequence of functions f : A (T, ρ ), let B A and m ′ → ⊆ Q = supρ (f (x), f(x)).
m ′ m x B ∈ Then f f (uniformly on B) iﬀ Q 0. m m → → Proof.
If Q 0, then by deﬁnition m → ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) Q < ε. m ∀ ∃ ∀ However, Q is an upper bound of all distances ρ (f (x), f(x)), x B.
Hence m ′ m ∈ (2) follows.
Conversely, if ( x B) ρ (f (x), f(x)) < ε, ′ m ∀ ∈ then ε supρ (f (x), f(x)), ′ m ≥ x B ∈ i.e., Q ε.
Thus (2) implies m ≤ ( ε > 0) ( k) ( m > k) Q ε m ∀ ∃ ∀ ≤ and Q 0.

n We have f 0 (pointwise) on C and f f (pointwise) on B, with n n → → f(x) = 0 for x C and f(1) = 1.
However, the limit is not uniform on ∈ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation230 Chapter 4.
Function Limits and Continuity C, let alone on B.
Indeed, Q = sup f (x) f(x) = 1 for each n.2 n n | − | x C ∈ Thus Q does not tend to 0, and uniform convergence fails by Theorem 1. n (b) In Example (a), let D = [0, a], 0 < a < 1.
Then f f (uniformly) on n → D because, in this case, Q = sup f (x) f(x) = sup xn 0 = an 0. n n | − | | − | → x D x D ∈ ∈ (c) Let sinnx f (x) = x2 + , x E1.

Also, n(cid:12)→ (cid:12) sinnx 1 f (x) f(x) = .
n | − | n ≤ n (cid:12) (cid:12) Thus ( n) Q 1 0.
By Theo(cid:12)rem 1,(cid:12)the limit is uniform on all of ∀ n ≤ n → (cid:12) (cid:12) E1.
Note 1.
Example (a) shows that the pointwise limit of a sequence of con- tinuous functions need not be continuous.
Not so for uniform limits, as the following theorem shows.
Theorem 2.
Let f : A (T, ρ ) be a sequence of functions on A (S, ρ).
If m ′ → ⊆ f f (uniformly) on a set B A, and if the f are relatively (or uniformly) m m → ⊆ continuous on B, then the limit function f has the same property.
Proof.
Fix ε > 0.
As f f (uniformly) on B, there is a k such that m → ε ( x B) ( m k) ρ (f (x), f(x)) < .
(3) ′ m ∀ ∈ ∀ ≥ 4 Take any f with m > k, and take any p B.
By continuity, there is δ > 0, m ∈ with ε ( x B G (δ)) ρ (f (x), f (p)) < .
(4) p ′ m m ∀ ∈ ∩ 4 2Here Qn = sup xn 0 = sup xn = lim xn =1 x∈C| − | 0≤x<1 x→1 by Theorem 1 of 5, because xn increases with x 1, i.e., each fn is a monotone function § ր on C. Note that all fn are continuous on B =[0, 1], but f =limfn is discontinuous at 1.
Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation12.
Sequences and Series of Functions 231 § ε Also, setting x = p in (3) gives ρ (f (p), f(p)) < .
Combining this with ′ m 4 (4) and (3), we obtain ( x B G (δ)) p ∀ ∈ ∩ ρ (f(x), f(p)) ρ (f(x), f (x))+ρ (f (x), f (p))+ρ (f (p), f(p)) ′ ′ m ′ m m ′ m ≤ ε ε ε < + + < ε.
4 4 4 We thus see that for p B, ∈ ( ε > 0) ( δ > 0) ( x B G (δ)) ρ (f(x), f(p)) < ε, p ′ ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∩ i.e., f is relatively continuous at p (over B), as claimed.
Quite similarly, the reader will show that f is uniformly continuous if the f are.
(cid:3) n Note 2.
A similar proof also shows that if f f (uniformly) on B, and m → if the f are relatively continuous at a point p B, so also is f. m ∈ Theorem 3 (Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence).
Let (T, ρ ) be com- ′ plete.
Then a sequence f : A T, A (S,ρ), converges uniformly on a set m → ⊆ B A iﬀ ⊆ ( ε > 0) ( k) ( x B) ( m,n > k) ρ (f (x), f (x)) < ε.
(5) ′ m n ∀ ∃ ∀ ∈ ∀ Proof.
If (5) holds then, for any (ﬁxed) x B, f (x) is a Cauchy sequence m ∈ { } of points in T, so by the assumed completeness of T, it has a limit f(x).
Thus we can deﬁne a function f: B T with → f(x) = lim f (x) on B. m m →∞ To show that f f (uniformly) on B, we use (5) again.
Keeping ε, k, m → x, and m temporarily ﬁxed, we let n so that f (x) f(x).
Then by n → ∞ → Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, 15, ρ (f (x), f (x)) p (f(x), f (x)).
Passing to ′ m n ′ m § → the limit in (5), we thus obtain (2).
The easy proof of the converse is left to the reader (cf.
Chapter 3, 17, Theorem 1).
(cid:3) § IV.
If the range space (T, ρ ) is E1, C, or En ( or another normed space), ′ ∗ the standard metric applies.

Theorem 3 .
Let the range space of f , m = 1, 2, ..., be E1, C, or En ( or ′ m ∗ another complete normed space).

Formulate it!

This property is stated P more precisely in the following theorem.

If f or f con- m m | | verges on B (pointwise or uniformly), then f 0 on B (in the same sense).
m | | → P P Thus a series cannot converge unless its general term tends to 0 (respec- tively, ¯0).
Proof.
If f = f, say, then s f and also s f. Hence m m m 1 → − → P s s f f = ¯0.
m m 1 − − → − However, s s = f .
Thus f ¯0, and f 0, as claimed.

Derivatives of Functions of One Real Variable In this chapter, “E” will always denote any one of E1, E , C (the complex ∗ ﬁeld), En, or another normed space.
We shall consider functions f: E1 E ∗ → of one real variable with values in E. Functions f: E1 E (admitting ﬁnite ∗ → and inﬁnite values) are said to be extended real.
Thus f: E1 E may be real, → extended real, complex, or vector valued.
Operations in E were deﬁned in Chapter 4, 4.
Recall, in particular, our ∗ § conventions (2 ) there.
Due to them, addition, subtraction, and multiplication ∗ are always deﬁned in E (with sums and products possibly “unorthodox”).
∗ To simplify formulations, we shall also adopt the convention that f(x) = 0 unless deﬁned otherwise.
(“0” stands also for the zero-vector in E if E is a vector space.)
Thus each function f is deﬁned on all of E1.
For convenience, we call f(x) “ﬁnite” if f(x) = (also if it is a vector).
6 ±∞ Deﬁnition 1.
For each function f: E1 E, we deﬁne its derived function f : E1 E ′ → → by setting, for every point p E1, ∈ f(x) f(p) lim − if this limit exists (ﬁnite or not); f′(p) = x p x p (1)  → − 0, otherwise.
 Thus f′(p)is always deﬁned.
If the limit in (1) exists, we call it the derivative of f at p. If, in addition, this limit is ﬁnite, we say that f is diﬀerentiable at p. If this holds for each p in a set B E1, we say that f has a deriva- ⊆ tive (respectively, is diﬀerentiable) on B, and we call the function f the ′ Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/ The Saylor Foundation252 Chapter 5.
Diﬀerentiation and Antidiﬀerentiation derivative of f on B.1 If the limit in (1) is one sided (with x p or x p+), we call it a − → → one-sided (left or right) derivative at p, denoted f or f .
′ +′ − Note that the formula f (p) = 0 holds also if f has no derivative at p. On ′ the other hand, f (p) = 0 implies that f (p) is a genuine derivative.
′ ′ 6 Deﬁnition 2.
Givenafunctionf: E1 E,wedeﬁneitsnth derived function (orderived → function of order n), denoted f(n): E1 E, by induction: → f(0) = f, f(n+1) = [f(n)] , n = 0, 1, 2, .... ′ Thus f(n+1) is the derived function of f(n).
By our conventions, f(n) is deﬁned on all of E1 for each n and each function f: E1 E. We have → f(1) = f , and we write f for f(2), f for f(3), etc.
We say that f has n ′ ′′ ′′′ derivatives at a point p iﬀ the limits f(k)(x) f(k)(q) lim − x q x q → − exist for all q in a neighborhood G of p and for k = 0, 1, ..., n 2, and also p − f(n 1)(x) f(n 1)(p) − − lim − x p x p → − exists.
If all these limits are ﬁnite, we say that f is n times diﬀerentiable on I; similarly for one-sided derivatives.
It is an important fact that diﬀerentiability implies continuity.
Theorem 1.
If a function f: E1 E is diﬀerentiable at a point p E1, it is → ∈ continuous at p, and f(p) is ﬁnite (even if E = E ).
∗ Proof.
Setting ∆x = x p and ∆f = f(x) f(p), we have the identity − − ∆f f(x) f(p) = (x p) for x = p. (2) | − | ∆x · − 6 (cid:12) (cid:12) By assumption, (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) ∆f f (p) = lim ′ x p ∆x → exists and is ﬁnite.

If f (p) > 0 at some p E1, then ′ ∈ x < p < y implies f(x) < f(p) < f(y) for all x, y in a suﬃciently small globe G (δ) = (p δ, p+δ).1 p − Similarly, if f (p) < 0, then x < p < y implies f(x) > f(p) > f(y) for x, y ′ in some G (δ).

If f(p) is the maximum or minimum value of f(x) for x in some G (δ), then f (p) = 0; i.e., f has a zero derivative, or none at all, at p. p ′ For, by Lemma 1, f (p) = 0 excludes a maximum or minimum at p.

Thus f (p) = 0 is a necessary condition for a local maximum or ′ minimum at p. It is insuﬃcient, however.

Applying the previous argument to each of the ≤ ≤ intervals [a, x], [a, y], [x, y], and [x, b] (now using that m = f(a) < f(b) = M), we ﬁnd that f(a) f(x) < f(y) f(b).

Thus Q(x) is deﬁned for m m ∈ all x I.

Letting x r in (4) and using the continuity of f at r, we obtain (2).
Thus → r is “good” itself.
Then, however, Lemma 1 yields a new interval (r, q) of “good” points.
Hence [a, q) has no “bad” points, and so q is a lower bound of the set B of “bad” points in I, contrary to q > r = glbB.
This contradiction shows that b must be “good,” i.e., f(b) f(a) g(b) g(a)+[b a+Q(b)]ε.

Diﬀerentiation and Antidiﬀerentiation §5.
Antiderivatives (Primitives, Integrals) Given f: E1 E, we often have to ﬁnd a function F such that F = f on I, ′ → or at least on I Q.1 We also require F to be relatively continuous and ﬁnite − on I.
This process is called antidiﬀerentiation or integration.
Deﬁnition 1.
We call F: E1 E a primitive, or antiderivative, or an indeﬁnite inte- → gral, of f on I iﬀ (i) F is relatively continuous and ﬁnite on I, and (ii) F is diﬀerentiable, with F = f, on I Q at least.
′ − We then write F = f, or F(x) = f(x)dx, on I.
Z Z (The latter is classical notation.)
If such an F exists (which is not always the case), we shall say that f exists on I, or that f has a primitive (or antiderivative) on I, or that f is primitively integrable (brieﬂy integrable) on I. R If F = f on a set B I, we say that f is exact on B and call F an ′ ⊆ exact primitive on B.
Thus if Q = , f is exact on all of I.
∅ R Note 1.
Clearly, if F = f, then also R(F + c) = f for a ﬁnite constant ′ ′ c. Thus the notation F = f is rather incomplete; it means that F is one of many primitives.
We now show that all of them have the form F + c (or R f +c).
Theorem 1.
If F and G are primitive to f on I, then G F is constant on I. R − Proof.
By assumption, F and G are relatively continuous and ﬁnite on I; hence so is G F. Also, F = f on I Q and G = f on I P. (Q and P are ′ ′ − − − countable, but possibly Q = P.) 6 Hence both F and G equal f on I S, where S = P Q, and S is countable ′ ′ − ∪ itself by Theorem 2 of Chapter 1, 9.
§ Thus by Corollary 3 in 4, F = G on I S implies G F = c (constant) ′ ′ on each [x, y] I; hence G§ F = c (or G =−F +c) on I.

(1) Za Za − (cid:12)a (cid:12) 1In this section, Q, P, and S shall denote countable sets, F′, G′, an(cid:12)d H′ are ﬁnite derivatives, and I is a ﬁnite or inﬁnite nondegenerate interval in E1.

Antiderivatives (Primitives, Integrals) 279 § This expression is called the deﬁnite integral of f from a to b.2 The deﬁnite integral of f from a to b is independent of the particular choice of the primitive F for f, and thus unambiguous, for if G is another primitive, Theorem 1 yields G = F +c, so G(b) G(a) = F(b)+c [F(a)+c] = F(b) F(a), − − − and it does not matter whether we take F or G. b b Note that f(x)dx, or f, is a constant in the range space E (a vector a a b if f is vector valued).
The “x” in f(x)dx is a “dummy variable” only, and R R a it may be replaced by any other letter.
Thus R b b f(x)dx = f(y)dy = F(b) F(a).
− Za Za On the other hand, the indeﬁnite integral is a function: F: E1 E. → Note 2.
We may, however, vary a or b (or both) in (1).
Thus, keeping a ﬁxed and varying b, we can deﬁne a function t G(t) = f = F(t) F(a), t I.
− ∈ Za Then G = F = f on I, and G(a) = F(a) F(a) = 0.
Thus if f exists ′ ′ − on I, f has a (unique) primitive G on I such that G(a) = 0.

It is customary to write df for f (p)∆x and x p ′ o(∆x) for→δ(x)∆x;1 df is called the diﬀerential of f (at p and x).
Thus ∆f = df +o(∆x); i.e., df approximates ∆f to within o(∆x).
More generally, given any function f: E1 E and p,x E1, we deﬁne → ∈ dnf = dnf(p, x) = f(n)(p)(x p)n, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., (1) − 1This is the so-called “little o” notation.

Theorem 2.
Let f: E1 E be of class CDn on G (δ) for an even number ∗ p → n 2, and let ≥ f(k)(p) = 0 for k = 1, 2, ..., n 1, − while f(n)(p) < 0 (respectively, f(n)(p) > 0).
Then f(p) is the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of f on some G (ε), p ε δ.
≤ If, however, these conditions hold for some odd n 1 (i.e., the ﬁrst non- ≥ vanishing derivative at p is of odd order), f has no maximum or minimum at p. Proof.
As f(k)(p) = 0, k = 1, 2, ..., n 1, − Theorem 1 (with n replaced by n 1) yields ′ − (x p)n f(x) = f(p)+f(n)(q ) − for all x G (δ), n p n!

If, however, n is odd, then (x p)n is negative for x < p but positive for − x > p. The same argument then shows that f(x) < f(p) on one side of p and f(x) > f(p) on the other side; thus no local maximum or minimum can exist at p. This completes the proof.

The Total Variation (Length) of a Function f : E → E 1 The question that we shall consider now is how to deﬁne reasonably (and precisely) the notion of the length of a curve (Chapter 4, 10) described by a § function f: E1 E over an interval I = [a, b], i.e., f[I].
→ We proceed as follows (see Figure 24).1 Subdivide [a, b] by a ﬁnite set of points P = t , t , ..., t , with 0 1 m { } q =f(c) a = t0 t1 tm = b; q2 =f(t2) ≤ ≤ ··· ≤ q =f(t ) 1 1 P is called a partition of [a, b].
Let q = f(t ), i = 1, 2, ..., m, i i f: E1 E2 → and, for i = 1, 2, ..., m, ∆ f = q q i i i 1 q =f(t ) − − 3 3 = f(t ) f(t ).
i − i−1 q0 =f(t0) We also deﬁne Figure 24 m m S(f, P) = ∆ f = q q .
i i i 1 | | | − − | i=1 i=1 X X Geometrically, ∆ f = q q is the length of the line segment L[q , q ] i i i 1 i 1 i | | | − − | − in E, and S(f, P) is the sum of such lengths, i.e., the length of the polygon m W = L[q , q ] i 1 i − i=1 [ inscribed into f[I]; we denote it by ℓW = S(f, P).
Now suppose we add a new partition point c, with t c t .
i 1 i − ≤ ≤ Then we obtain a new partition P = t , ..., t , c, t , ..., t , c 0 i 1 i m { − } calleda reﬁnement of P, and a new inscribed polygonW inwhich L[q , q ] is c i 1 i − replacedbytwo segments, L[q , q]andL[q, q ], whereq = f(c); seeFigure 24. i 1 i − Accordingly, the term ∆ f = q q in S(f, P) is replaced by i i i 1 | | | − − | q q + q q q q (triangle law).

The Total Variation (Length) of a Function f: E1 E 301 § → It follows that S(f, P) S(f, P ); i.e., ℓW ℓW .
c c ≤ ≤ Hence we obtain the following result.
Corollary 1.
The sum S(f, P) = ℓW cannot decrease when P is reﬁned.
Thus when new partition points are added, S(f, P) grows in general; i.e., it approaches some supremum value (ﬁnite or not).
Roughly speaking, the inscribed polygon W gets “closer” to the curve.
It is natural to deﬁne the desired length of the curve to be the lub of all lengths ℓW, i.e., of all sums S(f, P) resulting from the various partitions P. This supremum is also called the total variation of f over [a, b], denoted V [a, b].2 f Deﬁnition 1.
Given any function f: E1 E, and I = [a, b] E1, we set → ⊂ m V [I] = V [a, b] = supS(f, P) = sup f(t ) f(t ) 0 in E , (1) f f i i 1 ∗ P P | − − | ≥ i=1 X where the supremum is over all partitions P = t , ..., t of I.
We call 0 m { } V [I] the total variation, or length, of f on I. Brieﬂy, we denote it by V .
f f Note 1.
If f is continuous on [a, b], the image set A = f[I] is an arc (Chapter 4, 10).
It is customary to call V [I] the length of that arc, denoted f § ℓ A or brieﬂy ℓA.
Note, however, that there may well be another function f g, continuous on an interval J, such that g[J] = A but V [I] = V [J], and f g 6 so ℓ A = ℓ A.
Thus it is safer to say “the length of A as described by f on f g 6 I.” Only for simple arcs (where f is one to one), is “ℓA” unambiguous.
(See Problems 6–8.)
In the propositions below, f is an arbitrary function, f: E1 E. → Theorem 1 (additivity of V ).
If a c b, then f ≤ ≤ V [a, b] = V [a, c]+V [c, b]; f f f i.e., the length of the whole equals the sum of the lengths of the parts.
Proof.
Take any partition P = t , ..., t of [a, b].
If c / P, reﬁne P to 0 m { } ∈ P = t , ..., t , c, t , ..., t .
c 0 i i m { } Then by Corollary 1, S(f, P) S(f, P ).
c ≤ Now P splits into partitions of [a, c] and [c, b], namely, c P = t , ..., t , c and P = c, t , ..., t , ′ 0 i 1 ′′ i m { − } { } 2We also call it the length of f over [a, b].
Observe that, for real f: E1 E1, this is not → the length of the graph in the usual sense (which is a curve in E2).

Absolute Continuity 311 § Corollary 1.
If f is real and absolutely continuous on I = [a, b] (weakly), so are the nondecreasing functions g and h (f = g h) deﬁned in Theorem 3 − of 7.
§ Indeed, the function g as deﬁned there is simply v .
Thus it is relatively f continuous and ﬁnite on I by Theorem 1.
Hence so also is h = f g. Both are − of bounded variation (monotone!)
and hence absolutely continuous (weakly).
Note 1.
The proof of Theorem 1 shows that (weak) absolute continuity implies uniform continuity.
The converse fails, however (see Problem 1(iv) in 7).

Curves in E2 are often given in nonpara- k metric form as y = F(x), F: E1 E1.

To apply (5) here, we ﬁrst replace “y = F(x)” by suitable parametric equations, x = f (t) and y = f (t); 1 2 i.e., we introduce a function f: E1 E, with f = (f , f ).
An obvious (but 1 2 → not the only) way of achieving it is to set x = f (t) = t and y = f (t) = F(t) 1 2 so that f = 1 and f = F .

Regulated Functions 323 § Deﬁnition 1.
A function f: E1 (T, p) is said to be regulated on an interval I E1, → ⊆ with endpoints a < b, iﬀ the limits f(p ) and f(p+), other than ,1 − ±∞ exist at each p I.
However, at the endpoints a, b, if in I, we only ∈ require f(a+) and f(b ) to exist.
− Examples.
(a) If f is relatively continuous and ﬁnite on I, it is regulated.
(b) Everyrealmonotonefunctionisregulated(seeChapter4, 5, Theorem 1).
§ (c) If f: E1 En ( Cn) has bounded variation on I, it is regulated ( 7, ∗ → § Theorem 4).2 (d) The characteristic function of a set B, denoted C , is deﬁned by B C (x) = 1 if x B and C = 0 on B.
B B ∈ − For any interval J E1, C is regulated on E1.
J ⊆ (e) A function f is called a step function on I iﬀ I can be represented as the union, I = I , of a sequence of disjoint intervals I such that f is con- k k k stant and = on each I .
Note that some I may be singletons, p .3 k k 6 S±∞ { } If the number of the I is ﬁnite, we call f a simple step function.

Theorem 2.
If f: E1 E is regulated on an interval I E1 and if E is → ⊆ complete, then f exists on I, exact at every continuity point of f in I0.
In particular, all continuous maps f: E1 En ( Cn) have exact primitives.
R → ∗ Proof.
In view of Problem 14 of 5, it suﬃces to consider closed intervals.
§ Thus let I = [a, b], a < b, in E1.
Suppose ﬁrst that f is the char- Y acteristic function C of a subinter- J d val J I with endpoints c and d ⊆ (a c d b), so f = 1 on J, ≤ ≤ ≤ c and f = 0 on I J.
We then deﬁne − F(x) = x on J, F = c on [a, c], and F = d on [d, b] (see Figure 25).
Thus F is continuous (why?

Moreover, f is exact at continuity points of f in I0 (Problem 10 in R 5).
(cid:3) § R In view of the suﬃcient condition expressed in Theorem 2, we can now re- place the assumption “ f exists” in our previous theorems by “f is regulated” (provided E is complete).
For example, let us now review Problems 7 and 8 R in 5.
§ Theorem 3 (weighted law of the mean).
Let f: E1 E (E complete) and → g: E1 E1 be regulated on I = [a, b], with g 0 on I.5 Then the following → ≥ are true: (i) There is a ﬁnite c E (called the “g-weighted mean of f on I”) such ∈ b b that gf = c g. a a (ii) If f,Rtoo, is reRal and has the Darboux property on I, then c = f(q) for some q I.

Indeed, as f and g are regulated, so is gf by Theorem 1.
Hence by Theorem 2, f and gf exist on I.
The rest follows as in Problems 7 and 8 of 5.

Integral Deﬁnitions of Some Functions By Theorem 2 in 10, f exists on I whenever the function f: E1 E is § → regulated on I, and E is complete.

We start by setting 1 f(t) = , t E1, t = 0, t ∈ 6 and f(0) = 0.
Then f is continuous on I = (0, + ) and J = ( , 0), so it has an exact ∞ −∞ primitive on I and J separately (not on E1).

One uses the techniques from that section to prove it ﬁrst for rational §§ r, and then it follows for all real r by continuity.
However, we prefer not to use this now.
Next, we deﬁne the exponential function (“exp”) to be the inverse of the log function.
This inverse function exists; it is continuous (even diﬀerentiable) and strictly increasing on its domain (by Theorem 3 of Chapter 4, 9 and § Theorem 3 of Chapter 5, 2) since the log function has these properties.

· If the deﬁnitions and rules of Chapter 2, 11–12 are used, this proof even §§ works for any r by Note 1.
Thus our new deﬁnition of exp agrees with the old one.
Our next step is to give a new deﬁnition of ar, for any a, r E1 (a > 0).
∈ We set ar = exp(r loga) or (7) · logar = r loga (r E1).
(8) · ∈ In case r N, (8) becomes Theorem 1(vi).

Diﬀerentiation and Antidiﬀerentiation Note 2.
In classical analysis, the last integrals are regarded as so-called improper integrals, i.e., limits of integrals rather than integrals proper.
In our theory, this is unnecessary since F is a genuine primitive of f on I.
0 For each integer n (negatives included), we now deﬁne F : E1 E1 by n → F (x) = nπ +( 1)nF (x) for x I = [ 1, 1], n 0 − ∈ − (12) F = 0 on I. n − F is called the nth branch of the arcsine.
Figure 26 shows the graphs of F n 0 and F (that of F is dotted).
We now obtain the following theorem.

(i) Each F is diﬀerentiable on I = ( 1, 1) and relatively continuous on n − I = [ 1, 1].

Assertion (iv) ensures 0 that the graphs of the F add up to one Y n curve.
By (ii), each F is one to one 3π n (strictly monotone) on I.
Thus it has a 2 strictly monotone inverse on the interval J = F [[ 1, 1]], i.e., on the F -image of n n n − I.

Integral Deﬁnitions of Some Functions 337 § On the rest of E1, we deﬁne sinx and cosx periodically by setting sin(x+2nπ) = sinx and cos(x+2nπ) = cosx, n = 0, 1, 2, .... (15) ± ± Note that by Theorem 3(iv), π π F 1 = F 1 = 1.

We also have 1 π 3π sin = sin = 1, −2 2 − (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:16) (cid:17) in agreement with (15).
Thus the sine and cosine functions (brieﬂy, s and c) are well deﬁned on E1.
Theorem 4.
The sine and cosine functions (s and c) are diﬀerentiable, hence continuous, on all of E1, with derivatives s = c and c = s; that is, ′ ′ − (sinx) = cosx and (cosx) = sinx.
′ ′ − Proof.
Itsuﬃces toconsider theintervalsJ andJ , for, by(15), allproperties 0 1 of s and c repeat themselves, with period 2π, on the rest of E1.
By (13), π π s = F 1 on J = , , 0− 0 −2 2 h i where F is diﬀerentiable on I = ( 1, 1).
Thus Theorem 3 of 2 shows that s 0 − § is diﬀerentiable on J = ( π/2, π/2) and that 0 − 1 s (q) = whenever p I and q = F (p); ′ 0 F (p) ∈ 0′ i.e., q J and p = s(q).
However, by Theorem 3(iii), ∈ 1 F (p) = .

Diﬀerentiation and Antidiﬀerentiation on noting that s′ = c = (1 s2)21 on J0.
Similarly, using (14), one proves that − s = c and c = s on J (interior of J ).
′ ′ 1 1 − Next, let q be an endpoint, say, q = π/2.
We take the left derivative s(x) s(q) s (q) = lim − , x J .

However, s = F 1 is left continuous at q (why?
); hence so ′ 0 0− is c = √1 s2.
(Why?)
Therefore, − s (q) = lim c(x) = c(q), as required.
′ − x q− → Similarly, one shows that s (q) = c(q).
Hence s (q) = c(q) and c (q) = s(q), as before.
