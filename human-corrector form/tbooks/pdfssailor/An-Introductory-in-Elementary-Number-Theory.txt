An Introductory Course in Elementary Number Theory Wissam Raji2 Preface These notes serve as course notes for an undergraduate course in number the- ory.
Most if not all universities worldwide offer introductory courses in number theoryformathmajorsandinmanycasesasanelectivecourse.
Thenotescontainausefulintroductiontoimportanttopicsthatneedtobead- dressed in a course in number theory.
Proofs of basic theorems are presented in an interesting and comprehensive way that can be read and understood even by non-majors with the exception in the last three chapters where a background in analysis, measure theory and abstract algebra is required.
The exercises are care- fully chosen to broaden the understanding of the concepts.
Moreover, these notes shed light on analytic number theory, a subject that is rarely seen or approached by undergraduate students.
One of the unique characteristics of these notes is the carefulchoiceoftopicsanditsimportanceinthetheoryofnumbers.
Thefreedom is given in the last two chapters because of the advanced nature of the topics that arepresented.

1616 CONTENTSChapter 1 Introduction Integers are the building blocks of the theory of numbers.
This chapter contains somewhat very simple and obvious observations starting with properties of inte- gersandyettheproofsbehindthoseobservationsarenotassimple.
Inthischapter weintroducebasicoperationsonintegersandsomealgebraicdeﬁnitionsthatwill be necessary to understand basic concepts in this book.
We then introduce the Well ordering principle which states basically that every set of positive integers hasasmallestelement.
Proofbyinductionisalsopresentedasanefﬁcientmethod for proving several theorems throughout the book.
We proceed to deﬁne the con- cept of divisibility and the division algorithm.
We then introduce the elementary but fundamental concept of a greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers, and the Euclidean algorithm for ﬁnding the gcd of two integers.
We end this chap- ter with Lame’s Lemma on an estimate of the number of steps in the Euclidean algorithmneededtoﬁndthegcdoftwointegers.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Algebraic Operations With Integers The set Z of all integers, which this book is all about, consists of all positive and negativeintegersaswellas0.
ThusZisthesetgivenby Z = {...,−4,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,4,...}.
(1.1) Whilethesetofallpositiveintegers,denotedbyN,isdeﬁnedby N = {1,2,3,4,...}.
(1.2) On Z, there are two basic binary operations, namely addition (denoted by +) and multiplication (denoted by ·), that satisfy some basic properties from which everyotherpropertyforZemerges.

TheCommutativitypropertyforadditionandmultiplication a+b = b+a a·b = b·a 2.
Associativitypropertyforadditionandmultiplication (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) (a·b)·c = a·(b·c) 3.

ThesetZallowsadditiveinversesforitselements,inthesensethatforevery a ∈ ZthereexistsanotherintegerinZ,denotedby−a,suchthat a+(−a) = 0.
(1.3) While for multiplication, only the integer 1 has a multiplicative inverse in the sensethat1istheonlyintegerasuchthatthereexistsanotherinteger,denotedby a−1 orby1/a,(namely1itselfinthiscase)suchthat a·a−1 = 1.
(1.4) From the operations of addition and multiplication one can deﬁne two other operations on Z, namely subtraction (denoted by −) and division (denoted by /).
Subtraction is a binary operation on Z, i.e.
deﬁned for any two integers in Z, while division is not a binary operation and thus is deﬁned only for some speciﬁc coupleofintegersinZ.

1.2 The Well Ordering Principle and Mathematical Induction Inthissection,wepresentthreebasictoolsthatwilloftenbeusedinprovingprop- erties of the integers.
We start with a very important property of integers called10 CHAPTER1.
INTRODUCTION the well ordering principle.
We then state what is known as the pigeonhole prin- ciple, and then we proceed to present an important method called mathematical induction.
1.2.1 The Well Ordering Principle TheWellOrderingPrinciple: Aleastelementexistinanynonemptysetofpos- itiveintegers.
This principle can be taken as an axiom on integers and it will be the key to proving many theorems.
As a result, we see that any set of positive integers is wellorderedwhilethesetofallintegersisnotwellordered.
1.2.2 The Pigeonhole Principle The Pigeonhole Principle: If s objects are placed in k boxes for s > k, then at leastoneboxcontainsmorethanoneobject.
Proof.
Supposethatnoneoftheboxescontainsmorethanoneobject.
Thenthere are at most k objects.
This leads to a contradiction with the fact that there are s objectsfors > k. 1.2.3 The Principle of Mathematical Induction Wenowpresentavaluabletoolforprovingresultsaboutintegers.

The First Principle of Mathematical Induction: If a set of positive integers has the property that, if it contains the integer k, then it also contains1.2.

Weusethewellorderingprincipletoprovetheﬁrstprincipleofmathematical induction Proof.
LetS bethesetofpositiveintegerscontainingtheinteger1,andtheinteger k + 1 whenever it contains k. Assume also that S is not the set of all positive integers.
As a result, there are some integers that are not contained in S and thus those integers must have a least element α by the well ordering principle.
Notice that α (cid:54)= 1 since 1 ∈ S. But α−1 ∈ S and thus using the property of S, α ∈ S. ThusS mustcontainallpositiveintegers.

The second principle of induction is also known as the principle of strong induction.
Also, the ﬁrst principle of induction is known as the principle of weakinduction.

Proof.
Let T be a set of integers containing 1 and such that for every positive integer k, if it contains 1,2,...,k, then it contains k + 1.
Let S be the set of all positive integers k such that all the positive integers less than or equal to k are in T. Then 1 is in S, and we also see that k +1 is in S. Thus S must be the set of all positive integers.
Thus T must be the set of all positive integers since S is a subsetofT.1.3.

1.3 Divisibility and the Division Algorithm Wenowdiscusstheconceptofdivisibilityanditsproperties.
1.3.1 Integer Divisibility Deﬁnition 1.
If a and b are integers such that a (cid:54)= 0, then we say ”a divides b” if thereexistsanintegerk suchthatb = ka.
If a divides b, we also say ”a is a factor of b” or ”b is a multiple of a” and we write a | b.
If a doesn’t divide b, we write a (cid:45) b.
For example 2 | 4 and 7 | 63, while5 (cid:45) 26.
Example 3. a) Note that any even integer has the form 2k for some integer k, while any odd integer has the form 2k + 1 for some integer k. Thus 2|n if n is even,while2 (cid:45) nifnisodd.14 CHAPTER1.

Ifa,bandcareintegerssuchthata | bandb | c,thena | c. Proof.
Since a | b and b | c, then there exist integers k and k such that b = k a 1 2 1 andc = k b. Asaresult,wehavec = k k aandhencea | c. 2 1 2 Example4.
Since6 | 18and18 | 36,then6 | 36.
The following theorem states thatif an integer divides two otherintegers then itdividesanylinearcombinationoftheseintegers.
Theorem 4.
If a,b,c,m and n are integers, and if c | a and c | b, then c | (ma+nb).
Proof.
Since c | a and c | b, then by deﬁnition there exists k and k such that 1 2 a = k candb = k c. Thus 1 2 ma+nb = mk c+nk c = c(mk +nk ), 1 2 1 2 andhencec | (ma+nb).

If a | b ,a | b ,...,a | b 1 2 n then n (cid:88) a | k b (1.6) j j j=1 for any set of integers k ,··· ,k ∈ Z.
It would be a nice exercise to prove the 1 n generalizationbyinduction.1.3.

Theorem5.
TheDivisionAlgorithmIfaandbareintegerssuchthatb > 0,then thereexistuniqueintegersq andr suchthata = bq +r where0 ≤ r < b.
Proof.
Consider the set A = {a − bk ≥ 0 | k ∈ Z}.
Note that A is nonempty since for k < a/b, a − bk > 0.
By the well ordering principle, A has a least element r = a−bq for some q.
Notice that r ≥ 0 by construction.
Now if r ≥ b then(sinceb > 0) r > r−b = a−bq −b = a−b(q +1) =≥ 0.
This leads to a contradiction since r is assumed to be the least positive integer of theformr = a−bq.
Asaresultwehave0 ≤ r < b.
We will show that q and r are unique.
Suppose that a = bq + r and a = 1 1 bq +r with0 ≤ r < band0 ≤ r < b. Thenwehave 2 2 1 2 b(q −q )+(r −r ) = 0.
1 2 1 2 Asaresultwehave b(q −q ) = r −r .
1 2 2 1 Thuswegetthat b | (r −r ).
2 1 And since −max(r ,r ) ≤ |r − r | ≤ max(r ,r ), and b > max(r ,r ), then 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 r −r must be 0, i.e.
r = r .
And since bq +r = bq +r , we also get that 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 q = q .
Thisprovesuniqueness.

1.4 Representations of Integers in Different Bases In this section, we show how any positive integer can be written in terms of any positive base integer expansion in a unique way.
Normally we use decimal nota- tion to represent integers, we will show how to convert an integer from decimal notation into any other positive base integer notation and vise versa.
Using the1.4.

16 1.5 The Greatest Common Divisor In this section we deﬁne the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers and discuss its properties.
We also prove that the greatest common divisor of two integersisalinearcombinationoftheseintegers.
Twointegersaandb,notboth0,canhaveonlyﬁnitelymanydivisors,andthus can have only ﬁnitely many common divisors.
In this section, we are interested in the greatest common divisor of a and b.
Note that the divisors of a and that of | a |arethesame.
Deﬁnition 2.
The greatest common divisor of two integers a and b is the greatest integerthatdividesbothaandb.
We denote the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b by (a,b).
We alsodeﬁne(0,0) = 0.
Example 8.
Note that the greatest common divisor of 24 and 18 is 6.
In other words(24,18) = 6.
There are couples of integers (e.g.
3 and 4, etc...) whose greatest common divisoris1sowecallsuchintegersrelativelyprimeintegers.

Note that every integer has positive and negative divisors.
If a is a positive divisor of m, then −a is also a divisor of m. Therefore by our deﬁnition of the greatestcommondivisor,wecanseethat(a,b) = (| a |,| b |).

If(a,b) = dthen(a/d,b/d) = 1.

Then(a,b) = (a+cb,b).
Proof.
We will show that every divisor of a and b is also a divisor of a+cb and b and vise versa.
Hence they have exactly the same divisors.
So we get that the greatest common divisor of a and b will also be the greatest common divisor of a+cb and b.
Let k be a common divisor of a and b.
By Theorem 4, k | (a+cb)22 CHAPTER1.

Example10.
Noticethat(4,14) = (4,14−3·4) = (4,2) = 2.
We now present a theorem which proves that the greatest common divisor of twointegerscanbewrittenasalinearcombinationofthetwointegers.
Theorem 9.
The greatest common divisor of two integers a and b, not both 0 is theleastpositiveintegersuchthatma+nb = dforsomeintegersmandn.
Proof.
Assume without loss of generality that a and b are positive integers.
Con- sider the set of all positive integer linear combinations of a and b.
This set is non emptysincea = 1·a+0·bandb = 0·a+1·barebothinthisset.
Thusthisset hasa leastelementdbythe well-ordering principle.
Thusd = ma+nbforsome integers m and n. We have to prove that d divides both a and b and that it is the greatestdivisorofaandb.
Bythedivisionalgorithm,wehave a = dq +r, 0 ≤ r < d. Thuswehave r = a−dq = a−q(ma+nb) = (1−qm)a−qnb.
We then have that r is a linear combination of a and b.
Since 0 ≤ r < d and d is the least positive integer which is a linear combination of a and b, then r = 0 and a = dq.
Hence d | a.
Similarly d | b.
Now notice that if there is a divisor c that divides both a and b.
Then c divides any linear combination of a and b by Theorem 4.
Hence c | d. This proves that any common divisor of a and b divides d. Hencec ≤ d,anddisthegreatestdivisor.1.5.
THEGREATESTCOMMONDIVISOR 23 As a result, we conclude that if (a,b) = 1 then there exist integers m and n suchthatma+nb = 1.

Theintegers2,3,5,7,11areprimeintegers.
Note that any integer greater than 1 that is not prime is said to be a composite number.
We now present the sieve of Eratosthenes.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient method of ﬁnding prime numbers up to a speciﬁed integer.
This method wasinventedbytheancientGreekmathematicianEratosthenes.

Lemma3.
Everyintegergreaterthanonehasaprimedivisor.
Proof.
We present the proof of this Lemma by contradiction.
Suppose that there is an integer greater than one that has no prime divisors.
Since the set of integers with elements greater than one with no prime divisors is nonempty, then by the well ordering principle there is a least positive integer n greater than one that has noprimedivisors.
Thusniscompositesincendividesn.
Hence n = abwith 1 < a < nand 1 < b < n. Notice that a < n and as a result since n is minimal, a must have a prime divisor whichwillalsobeadivisorofn.
Theorem 12.
If n is a composite integer, then n has a prime factor not exceeding √ n. Proof.
Since n is composite, then n = ab, where a and b are integers with 1 < √ a ≤ b < n. Supposenowthata > n,then √ n < a ≤ b andasaresult √ √ ab > n n = n.2.1.

There are several ways to prove this result.
An alternative proof to the one presented here is given as an exercise.
The proof we will provide was presented by Euclid in his book the Elements.

Consider the integer Q such 1 2 n that Q = p p ...p +1.
1 2 n By Lemma 3, Q has at least a prime divisor, say q.
If we prove that q is not one of the primes listed then we obtain a contradiction.

2.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is one of the most important results in thischapter.
Itsimplysaysthateverypositiveintegercanbewrittenuniquelyasa product of primes.
The unique factorization is needed to establish much of what comes later.
There are systems where unique factorization fails to hold.
Many of these examples come from algebraic number theory.
We can actually list an easy examplewhereuniquefactorizationfails.
Consider the class C of positive even integers.
Note that C is closed under multiplication,whichmeansthattheproductofanytwoelementsinC isagainin C. Suppose now that the only number we know are the members of C. Then we have12 = 2.6iscompositewhereas14isprimesinceitisnottheproductoftwo numbersinC.

PRIMENUMBERS 2.3.1 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic To prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we need to prove some lemmas aboutdivisibility.
Lemma4.
Ifa,b,carepositiveintegerssuchthat(a,b) = 1anda | bc,thena | c. Proof.
Since (a,b) = 1, then there exists integers x,y such that ax+by = 1.
As a result, cax + cby = c. Notice that since a | bc, then by Theorem 4, a divides cax+cby andhenceadividesc.
We can generalize the above lemma as such: If (an ) = 1 for every i = , i 1,2,··· ,n and a | n n ···n , then a | n .
We next prove a case of this 1 2 k+1 k+1 generalizationandusethistoprovethefundamentaltheoremofarithmetic.
Lemma 5.
If p divides n n n ...n , where p is a prime and n > 0 for all 1 ≤ 1 2 3 k i i ≤ k,thenthereisanintegerj with1 ≤ j ≤ k suchthatp | n .
j Proof.
We present the proof of this result by induction.
For k = 1, the result is trivial.
Assume now that the result is true for k. Consider n n ...n that is 1 2 k+1 divisiblebyp.
Noticethateither (p,n n ...n ) = 1 or (p,n n ...n ) = p. 1 2 k 1 2 k Now if (p,n n ...n ) = 1 then by Lemma 4, p | n .
Now if p | n n ...n , then 1 2 k k+1 1 2 k bytheinductionhypothesis,thereexistsanintegerisuchthatp | n .
i We now state the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and present the proof usingLemma5.
Theorem 15.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic Every positive integer differentfrom1canbewrittenuniquelyasaproductofprimes.2.3.
THEFUNDAMENTALTHEOREMOFARITHMETIC 37 Proof.
If n is a prime integer, then n itself stands as a product of primes with a single factor.
If n is composite, we use proof by contradiction.
Suppose now that there is some positive integer that cannot be written as the product of primes.
Let n be the smallest such integer.
Let n = ab, with 1 < a < n and 1 < b < n. As a result a and b are products of primes since both integers are less than n. As a result, n = ab is a product of primes, contradicting that it is not.

Dirichlet proved this theorem using complex analysis, but the proof is so chal- lenging.
As a result, we will present a special case of this theorem and prove that there are inﬁnitely many primes in a given arithmetic progression.
Before stating the theorem about the special case of Dirichlet’s theorem, we prove a lemma that willbeusedintheproofofthementionedtheorem.

Let 1 2 n N = 4p p ...p +3.

Then there is at least one prime in the prime factorization of N of the form 4n + 3, as otherwise, by Lemma 7, N will be in the form 4n+1.
We wish to prove that this prime in the factorizationofN isnoneofp = 3,p ,p ,...,p .

The function [x] represents the largest integer not exceeding x.
In otherwords,forrealx,[x]istheuniqueintegersuchthat x−1 < [x] ≤ x < [x]+1.
We also deﬁne ((x)) to be the fractional part of x.
In other words ((x)) = x−[x].
We now list some properties of [x] that will be used in later or in more advanced coursesinnumbertheory.

Using the deﬁnition of [x], it will be easy to see that the above properties are directconsequencesofthedeﬁnition.
We now deﬁne some symbols that will be used to estimate the growth of number theoreticfunctions.
Thesesymbolswillbenotbereallyappreciatedinthecontext ofthisbookbuttheseareoftenusedinmanyanalyticproofs.
2.6.2 The ”O” and ”o” Symbols Let f(x) be a positive function and let g(x) be any function.
Then O(f(x)) (pro- nounced ”big-oh” of f(x))denotes the collection of functions g(x) that exhibit a growth that is limited to that of f(x) in some respect.
The traditional notation for statingthatg(x)belongstothiscollectionis: g(x) = O(f(x)).
Thismeansthatforsufﬁcientlylargex, | g(x) | < M, (2.3) |f(x)| whereM issomepositivenumber.
Example21.
sin(x) = O(x),andalsosin(x) = O(1).
Now, the relation g(x) = o(f(x)), pronounced ”small-oh” of f(x), is used to indicatethatf(x)growsmuchfasterthang(x).
Itformallysaysthat g(x) lim = 0.
(2.4) x→∞ f(x) Moregenerally,g(x) = o(f(x))atapointbif g(x) lim = 0.
(2.5) x→b f(x)48 CHAPTER2.
PRIMENUMBERS Example 22. sin(x) = o(x) at ∞, and xk = o(ex) also at ∞ for every constant k. The notation that f(x) is asymptotically equal to g(x) is denoted by ∼.
For- mallyspeaking,wesaythatf(x) ∼ g(x)if f(x) lim = 1.
(2.6) x→∞ g(x) Example23.
[x] ∼ x.
The purpose of introducing these symbols is to make complicated mathemat- ical expressions simpler.
Some expressions can be represented as the principal part that you need plus a remainder term.
The remainder term can be expressed using the above notations.
So when you need to combine several expressions, the remainder parts involving these symbols can be easily combined.
We will state now some properties of the above symbols without proof.
These properties are easytoproveusingthedeﬁnitionsofthesymbols.
1.
O(O(f(x))) = O(f(x)), 2. o(o(f(x))) = o(f(x)).
3.
O(f(x))±O(f(x)) = O(f(x)), 4. o(f(x)±o(f(x)) = o(f(x)), 5.
O(f(x))±O(g(x)) = O(max(f(x),g(x))), There are some other properties that we did not mention here, properties that are rarelyusedinnumbertheoreticproofs.

THEOREMSANDCONJECTURESINVOLVINGPRIMENUMBERS 49 2.7 Theorems and Conjectures involving prime num- bers We have proved that there are inﬁnitely many primes.
We have also proved that there are arbitrary large gaps between primes.
The question that arises naturally hereisthefollowing: Canweestimatehowmanyprimesaretherelessthanagiven number?
Thetheoremthatanswersthisquestionistheprimenumbertheorem.
We denote by π(x) the number of primes less than a given positive number x.
Many mathematicians worked on this theorem and conjectured many estimates before Chebyshev ﬁnally stated that the estimate is x/logx.
The prime number theorem was ﬁnally proved in 1896 when Hadamard and Poussin produced independent proofs.
Before stating the prime number theorem, we state and prove a lemma involvingprimesthatwillbeusedinthecomingchapters.

Thenthehighestpowerofpdividing m!is ∞ (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:88) m pi i=1 (cid:104) (cid:105) Proof.
Among all the integers from 1 till m, there are exactly m integers that p (cid:104) (cid:105) (cid:104) (cid:105) are divisible by p. These are p,2p,..., m p. Similarly we see that there are m p pi integersthataredivisiblebypi.

PRIMENUMBERS So this theorem says that you do not need to ﬁnd all the primes less than x to ﬁnd out their number, it will be enough to evaluate x/logx for large x to ﬁnd an estimate for the number of primes.

We now present a theorem that will show one difference between equations and congruences.
In equations, if we divide both sides of the equation by a non- zero number, equality holds.
While in congruences, it is not necessarily true.
In other words, dividing both sides of the congruence by the same integer doesn’t preservethecongruence.

Dividing both sides by d, we get (c/d)(a − b) = k(m/d).
Since (m/d,c/d) = 1, it follows that m/d | (a − b).
Hencea ≡ b(modm/d).

CONGRUENCES Proof.
We will prove this lemma by contradiction.
Suppose that the set of m integersdoesnotformacompleteresiduesystemmodulom.
Thenwecanﬁndat least one integer a that is not congruent to any element in this set.
Hence non of the elements of this set is actually congruent to the remainder when a is divided by m. Thus dividing by m yields to at most m−1 remainders.
Therefore by the pigeonhole principle, atleast two integers inthe set that have thesame remainder modulom.

The Euler φ-function of a positive integer n, denoted by φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n. Example 28.

Theorem 26.
Let a,b and m be integers such that m > 0 and let c = (a,m).
If c does not divide b, then the congruence ax ≡ b(mod m) has no solutions.
If c | b, then ax ≡ b(modm) hasexactlycincongruentsolutionsmodulom.
Proof.
As we mentioned earlier, ax ≡ b(mod m) is equivalent to ax−my = b.
By Theorem 19 on Diophantine equations, we know that if c does not divide b, then the equation, ax − my = b has no solutions.

Remark 2.
Notice that if c = (a,m) = 1, then there is a unique solution modulo mfortheequationax ≡ b(modm).
Example 29.
Let us ﬁnd all the solutions of the congruence 3x ≡ 12(mod 6).
Notice that (3,6) = 3 and 3 | 12.
Thus there are three incongruent solutions modulo 6.
We use the Euclidean algorithm to ﬁnd the solution of the equation 3x − 6y = 12 as described in chapter 2.
As a result, we get x = 6.
Thus the 0 threeincongruentsolutionsaregivenbyx = 6(mod6),x = 6+2 = 2(mod6) 1 1 andx = 6+4 = 4(mod6).

3.5 Theorems of Fermat, Euler, and Wilson In this section we present three applications of congruences.
The ﬁrst theorem is Wilson’s theorem which states that (p−1)!+1 is divisible by p, for p prime.
Next, we present Fermat’s theorem, also known as Fermat’s little theorem which states that ap and a have the same remainders when divided by p where p (cid:45) a. FinallywepresentEuler’stheoremwhichisageneralizationofFermat’stheorem anditstatesthatforanypositiveintegermthatisrelativelyprimetoanintegera, aφ(m) ≡ 1(mod m) where φ is Euler’s φ-function.
We start by proving a theorem abouttheinverseofintegersmoduloprimes.
Theorem 28.
Let p be a prime.
A positive integer m is its own inverse modulo p ifandonlyifpdividesm+1orpdividesm−1.
Proof.
Supposethatmisitsowninverse.
Thus m.m ≡ 1(modp).
Hencep | m2 −1.
Asaresult, p | (m−1)or p | (m+1).3.5.
THEOREMSOFFERMAT,EULER,ANDWILSON 65 Wegetthatm ≡ 1(modp)orm ≡ −1(modp).
Conversely,supposethat m ≡ 1(modp)or m ≡ −1(modp).
Thus m2 ≡ 1(modp).
Theorem29.
Wilson’sTheoremIfpisaprimenumber,thenpdivides(p−1)!+1.
Proof.
When p = 2, the congruence holds.
Now let p > 2.
Using Theorem 26, we see that for each 1 ≤ m ≤ p, there is an inverse 1 ≤ m¯ ≤ p such that mm¯ ≡ 1(mod p).
Thus by Theorem 28, we see that the only two integers that have their own inverses are1 and p−1.
Hence after coupling the integers from 2 top−2eachwithitsinverse,weget 2.3.....(p−2) ≡ 1(modp).
Thusweget 1.2.3.....(p−2)(p−1) ≡ (p−1)(modp) Asaresult,wehave(p−1)!
≡ −1(modp).
NotealsothattheconverseofWilson’stheoremalsoholds.
Theconversetells uswhetheranintegerisprimeornot.
Theorem30.
Ifmisapositiveintegerwithm ≥ 2suchthat (m−1)!+1 ≡ 0(modm) thenmisprime.66 CHAPTER3.
CONGRUENCES Proof.
Supposethatmhasaproperdivisorc andthat 1 (m−1)!+1 ≡ 0(modm).
That is m = c c where 1 < c < m and 1 < c < m. Thus c is a divisor of 1 2 1 2 1 (m−1)!.
Also,since m | ((m−1)!+1), weget c | ((m−1)!+1).
1 Asaresult,byTheorem4,wegetthat c | ((m−1)!+1−(m−1)!
), 1 whichgivesthatc | 1.
Thisisacontradictionandhencemisprime.
1 We now present Fermat’s Theorem or what is also known as Fermat’s Little Theorem.
It states that the remainder of ap−1 when divided by a prime p that doesn’t divide a is 1.
We then state Euler’s theorem which states that the remain- der of aφ(m) when divided by a positive integer m that is relatively prime to a is 1.
We prove Euler’s Theorem only because Fermat’s Theorem is nothing but a specialcaseofEuler’sTheorem.
Thisisduetothefactthatforaprimenumberp, φ(p) = p−1.

WenowpresentacoupleoftheoremsthataredirectconsequencesofFermat’s theorem.
The ﬁrst states Fermat’s theorem in a different way.
It says that the remainderofap whendividedbypisthesameastheremainderofawhendivided by p. The other theorem determines the inverse of an integer a modulo p where p (cid:45) a. Theorem 32.
If p is a prime number and a is a positive integer, then ap ≡ a(modp).
Proof.
Ifp (cid:45) a,byFermat’stheoremweknowthat ap−1 ≡ 1(modp).
Thus,weget ap ≡ a(modp).68 CHAPTER3.

Theorem37.
Letpbeaprimeandmapositiveinteger,thenφ(pm) = pm−pm−1.

Note that all integers that are relatively prime to pm and that are less than pm are those that are not multiple of p. Those integers are p,2p,3p,...,pm−1p.
There are pm−1 of those integers that are not relatively prime to pm and that are lessthanpm.
Thus φ(pm) = pm −pm−1.74 CHAPTER4.

Denoteφ(m)bysandletk ,k ,...,k beareducedresiduesystemmodulo 1 2 s m. Similarly, denote φ(n) by t and let k(cid:48),k(cid:48),...,k(cid:48) be a reduced residue system 1 2 t modulon.
Noticethatifxbelongstoareducedresiduesystemmodulomn,then (x,m) = (x,n) = 1.
Thus x ≡ k (modm)and x ≡ k(cid:48)(modn) i j forsomei,j.
Conversely,if x ≡ k (modm)and x ≡ k(cid:48)(modn) i j somei,j then(x,mn) = 1andthusxbelongstoareducedresiduesystemmodulo mn.
Thus a reduced residue system modulo mn can be obtained by by determin- ing all x that are congruent to k and k(cid:48) modulo m and n respectively.
By the i j Chineseremaindertheorem,thesystemofequations x ≡ k (modm)and x ≡ k(cid:48)(modn) i j has a unique solution.
Thus different i and j will yield different answers.

4.4 Perfect, Mersenne, and Fermat Numbers Integers with certain properties were studied extensively over the centuries.
We present some examples of such integers and prove theorems related to these inte- gersandtheirproperties.
Westartbydeﬁningperfectnumbers.
Deﬁnition24.
Apositiveintegerniscalledaperfectnumberifσ(n) = 2n.4.4.
PERFECT,MERSENNE,ANDFERMATNUMBERS 83 In other words, a perfect number is a positive integer which is the sum of its properdivisors.
Example 43.
The ﬁrst perfect number is 6, since σ(6) = 12.
You can also view this as 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.
The second perfect number is 28, since σ(28) = 56 or 28 = 1+2+4+7+14.
Thefollowingtheoremtellsuswhichevenpositiveintegersareperfect.
Theorem49.
Thepositiveintegernisanevenperfectnumberifandonlyif n = 2l−1(2l −1), wherel isanintegersuchthatl ≥ 2and2l −1isprime.
Proof.
We show ﬁrst that if n = 2l−1(2l − 1) where l is an integer such that l ≥ 2 and 2l − 1 is prime then n is perfect.
Notice that 2l − 1 is odd and thus (2l−1,2l −1) = 1.
Also,noticethatσ isamultiplicativefunctionandthus σ(n) = σ(2l−1)σ(2l −1).
Noticethatσ(2l−1) = 2l−1andsince2l−1isprimewegetσ(2l−1) = 2l.
Thus σ(n) = 2n.
We now prove the converse.
Suppose that n is a perfect number.
Let n = 2rs, wherer andsarepositiveintegersandsisodd.
Since(2r,s) = 1,weget σ(n) = σ(2r)σ(s) = (2r+1 −1)σ(s).
Sincenisperfect,weget (2r+1 −1)σ(s) = 2r+1s.
Notice now that (2r+1 −1,2r+1) = 1 and thus 2r+1 | σ(s).
Therefore there exists anintegerq suchthatσ(s) = 2r+1q.
Asaresult,wehave (2r+1 −1)2r+1q = 2r+1s84 CHAPTER4.
MULTIPLICATIVENUMBERTHEORETICFUNCTIONS andthusweget (2r+1 −1)q = s Sowegetthatq | s. Weaddq tobothsidesoftheaboveequationandweget s+q = (2r+1 −1)q +q = 2r+1q = σ(s).
We have to show now that q = 1.
Notice that if q (cid:54)= 1, then s will have three divisors and thus σ(s) ≥ 1 + s + q.
Hence q = 1 and as a result s = 2r+1 − 1.
Also notice that σ(s) = s+1.
This shows that s is prime since the only divisors ofsare1ands.
Asaresult, n = 2r(2r+1 −1), where(2r+1 −1)isprime.
In theorem 50, we see that to determine even perfect numbers, we need to ﬁnd primes of the form 2l − 1.
It is still unknown whether there are odd perfect numbersornot.
Theorem50.
If2l−1isprimewherel isapositiveinteger,thenl mustbeprime.
Proof.
Suppose that l is composite, that is l = rs where 1 < r < m and 1 < s < m. Thusafterfactoring,wegetthat 2m −1 = (2r −1)(2r(s−1) +2r(s−2) +...+2r +1) Noticethatthetwofactorsabovearebothgreaterthan1.

Also,itiseasytoseethat 1 (2p −1,2p1−1 −1) = 2(p,p1−1) −1.
Sincep isacommondivisorof2p−1and2p1−1−1andthusnotrelativelyprime.

PRIMITIVEROOTSANDQUADRATICRESIDUES by the well ordering principle, there is a least positive integer x that satisﬁes this congruenceax ≡ 1(modn).
Deﬁnition 1.
Let (a,b) = 1.
The smallest positive integer x such that ax ≡ 1(mod b) is called the order of a modulo b.
We denote the order of a modulo b by ord a. b Example 46. ord 2 = 3 since 23 ≡ 1(mod 7) while 21 ≡ 2(mod 7) and 22 ≡ 7 4(mod7).

Since ord a, we get r = 0. b Thusx = q.ord aandhenceord a | x. b b Example 47.
Since ord 2 = 3, then 215 ≡ 1(mod 7) while 10 is not a solution 7 for2x ≡ 1(mod7).

Hence b ai = aj+k.ordba = aj(aordba)k ≡ aj(modb).
Assumenowthatai ≡ aj(modb)withi ≥ j. Thuswehave ai ≡ ajai−j ≡ aj(modb) Since(a,b) = 1,wehave(aj,b) = 1andthusbyTheorem22,weget ai−j ≡ 1(modb).
Bytheorem54,wegetthatord a | (i−j)andhencei ≡ j(modb).

In one of the exer- cises, one is asked to prove that if aand b are relatively prime then ord a | φ(b).

PRIMITIVEROOTSANDQUADRATICRESIDUES Proof.
To prove that the set {r1,r2,...rφ(m)} form a reduced residue set modulo m we need to show that every two of them are relatively prime and that no two of them are congruent modulo m. Since (r,m) = 1, it follows that (rn,m) = 1 forallpositiveintegersn.

m Proof.
Let v = ord (au), w = (t,u), t = t wand u = u w. m 1 1 Noticethat(t ,u ) = 1.
1 1 Because t = t/(t,u), we want to show that ord (au) = t .

HencebyTheorem54,wehavev | t .
Nowontheotherhand,since 1 (au)v = auv ≡ 1(modm), we know that t | uv.
Hence t w | u wv and hence t | u v. Because (t ,u ) = 1, 1 1 1 1 1 1 we see that t | v. Since v | t and t | v, we conclude that v = t = t/w = 1 1 1 1 t/(t,u).5.1.

Let p be a prime and let m be a positive integer such that p−1 = mk for some integer k. Let F(m) be the number of positive integers of order m modulo p that are less than p. The order modulo p of an integer not divisible by p divides p−1,itfollowsthat (cid:88) p−1 = F(m).

PRIMITIVEROOTSANDQUADRATICRESIDUES 5.3 The Existence of Primitive Roots In this section, we demonstrate which integers have primitive roots.
We start by showing that every power of an odd prime has a primitive root and to do this we startbyshowingthateverysquareofanoddprimehasaprimitiveroot.
Theorem 62.
If p is an odd prime with primitive root r, then one can have either r orr+pasaprimitiverootmodulop2.
Proof.
Noticethatsincer isaprimitiverootmodulop,then ord r = φ(p) = p−1.
p Letm = ord r,then p2 rm ≡ 1(modp2).
Thus rm ≡ 1(modp).
ByTheorem54,wehave p−1 | m. ByExercise7ofsection6.1,wealsohavethat m | φ(p2).
Also,φ(p2) = p(p−1)andthusmeitherdividesporp−1.
Andsincep−1 | m thenwehave m = p−1 or m = p(p−1).
If m = p(p−1) and ord r = φ(p2) then r is a primitive root modulo p2.
Other- p2 wise,wehavem = p−1andthus rp−1 ≡ 1(modp2).5.3.
THEEXISTENCEOFPRIMITIVEROOTS 99 Let s = r + p. Then s is also a primitive root modulo p. Hence, ord s equals p2 eitherp−1orp(p−1).
Wewillshowthatord s (cid:54)= p−1sothatord s = p(p−1).
p2 p2 Notethat sp−1 = (r+p)p−1 = rp−1 +(p−1)rp−2p+...+pp−1 = rp−1 +(p−1)p.rp−2(modp2).
Hence p2 | sp−1 −(1−prp−2.
Notealsothatif p2 | (sp−1 −1), then p2 | prp−2.
Thuswehave p | rp−2 whichisimpossiblebecausep (cid:45) r. Becauseord s (cid:54)= p−1,wecanconcludethat p2 ord s = p(p−1) = φ(p2).
p2 Thus,s = r+pisaprimitiverootofp2.
Example 51.
Notice that 7 has 3 as a primitive root.
Either ord 3 = 6 or 49 ord 3 = 42.
But since 36 (cid:54)≡ 1(mod 49).
Hence ord 3 = 42.
Hence 3 is a 49 49 primitiverootof49.
Wenowshowthatanypowerofanoddprimehasaprimitiveroot.
Theorem 63.
Let p be an odd prime.
Then any power of p is a primitive root.
Moreover, if r is a primitive root modulo p2, then r is a primitive root modulo pm forallpositiveintegersm.100 CHAPTER5.
PRIMITIVEROOTSANDQUADRATICRESIDUES Proof.
By Theorem 62, we know that any prime p has a primitive root r which is alsoaprimitiverootmodulop2,thus p2 (cid:45) (rp−1 −1).
(5.1) Wewillprovebyinductionthat pm (cid:45) (rpm−2(p−1) −1) (5.2) for all integers m ≥ 2.
Once we prove the above congruence, we show that r is also a primitive root modulo pm.
Let n = ord r. By Theorem 54, we know that pm n | φ(pm).
Also,weknowthatφ(pm) = pm(p−1).
Hencen | pm(p−1).
Onthe otherhand,because pm | (rn −1), wealsoknowthat p | (rn −1).
Since φ(p) = p − 1, we see that by Theorem 54, we have n = l(p − 1).
also n | pm−1(p − 1), we have that n = ps(p − 1), where 0 ≤ s ≤ m − 1.
If n = ps(p−1)withs ≤ m−2,then pk | rpm−2(p−1) −1, whichisacontradiction.
Hence ord r = φ(pm).
pm We prove now (7.5) by induction.
Assume that our assertion is true for all m ≥ 2.
Then pm (cid:45) (rpm−2(p−1) −1).
Because (r,p) = 1, we see that (r,pm−1) = 1.
We also know from Euler’s theoremthat pm−1 | (rpm−2(p−1) −1).5.3.
THEEXISTENCEOFPRIMITIVEROOTS 101 Thusthereexistsanintegerk suchthat rpm−2(p−1) = 1+kpm−1.
wherep (cid:45) k becauserpm−2(p−1) (cid:54)≡ 1(modpm).
Thuswehavenow rpm−1(p−1) = (1+kpm−1)p ≡ 1+kpm(modpm+1) Becausep (cid:45) k,wehave pm+1 (cid:45) (rpm−1(p−1) −1).
Example 52.
Since 3 is a primitive root of 7, then 3 is a primitive root for 7k for allpositiveintegersk.
Inthefollowingtheorem,weprovethatnopowerof2,otherthan2or4,hasa primitive root and that is because when m is an odd integer, ordkm (cid:54)= φ(2k) and 2 thisisbecause2k | (aφ(2k)/2 −1).

Gauss’s Lemma Let p (cid:54)= 2 be a prime and a a relatively prime integer to p. If k counts the number of least positive residues of the integers a,2a,...,((p−1)/2)athataregreaterthanp/2,then (cid:18) (cid:19) a = (−1)k. p Proof.

So we shall show that no two integers of these are congruent modulo p, be- cause there are exactly (p−1)/2 numbers in the set, and all are positive integers less than or equal to (p−1)/2.
Notice that m (cid:54)≡ m ( mod p) for all i (cid:54)= j and i j n (cid:54)≡ n ( mod p) for all i (cid:54)= j.
If any of these congruences fail, then we will i j have that r ≡ s(mod p) assuming that ra ≡ sa(mod p).
Also any of the integers p − m can be congruent to any of the n ’s.
Because if such congruence holds, i i thenwehavera ≡ p−sa(modp),sothatra ≡ −sa(modp).
Becausep (cid:45) a,this impliesthatr ≡ −s(modp),whichisimpossible.

PRIMITIVEROOTSANDQUADRATICRESIDUESChapter 6 Introduction to Continued Fractions In this chapter, we introduce continued fractions, prove their basic properties and apply these properties to solve some problems.
Being a very natural object, con- tinued fractions appear in many areas of Mathematics, sometimes in an unex- pectedway.
TheDutchmathematicianandastronomer,ChristianHuygens(1629- 1695),madetheﬁrstpracticalapplicationofthetheoryof”anthyphaeireticratios” (the old name of continued fractions) in 1687.
He wrote a paper explaining how to use convergents to ﬁnd the best rational approximations for gear ratios.
These approximationsenabledhimtopickthegearswiththebestnumbersofteeth.
His work was motivated by his desire to build a mechanical planetarium.
Further continued fractions attracted attention of most prominent mathematicians.
Euler, Jacobi,Cauchy,Gaussandmanyothersworkedwiththesubject.
Continuedfrac- tions ﬁnd their applications in some areas of contemporary Mathematics.
There are mathematicians who continue to develop the theory of continued fractions nowadays, The Australian mathematician A.J.
van der Poorten is, probably, the mostprominentamongthem.

k It is not difﬁcult to expand any rational number α into a continued fraction.
Indeed, let a = [α] be the greatest integer not exceeding α.
Thus the difference 0 δ = α − a < 1 and, of course, δ ≥ 0.
If δ = 0 then we are done.
Otherwise 0 put r = 1/δ, ﬁnd a = [r ] and non-negative δ = α − a < 1.
Continue the 1 1 1 1 1 procedureuntilyouobtainδ = 0.
Example 59.
Consider the continued fraction expansion for 42/31.
We obtain a = [42/31] = 1, δ = 42/31 − 1 = 11/31.
Now r = 1/δ = 31/11 and 0 1 a = [α ] = [31/11] = 2.
Thenewδ = 31/11−2 = 9/11.
Nowr = 1/δ = 11/9 1 1 2 and a = [α ] = [11/9] = 1.
It follows that δ = 11/9 − 1 = 2/9.

A rational number a/b is referred to as a ”good” approximation to anumberα if c a (cid:54)= and 0 < d ≤ b d b imply |dα−c| > |bα−a|.

Naively, this deﬁnition means that a/b approximates α better then any other rational number whose denominator does not exceed b.
There is another, more6.3.
VERYGOODAPPROXIMATION 131 common, deﬁnition of ”the best approximation”.
A rational number x/y is re- ferredtoas”thebestapproximationoftheﬁrstkind”ifc/d (cid:54)= x/y and0 < d ≤ y imply |α − c/d| > |α − x/y|.
In other words, x/y is closer to α than any ratio- nal number whose denominator does not exceed y.
In our deﬁnition we consider a slightly different measure of approximation, which takes into the account the denominator, namely b|α − a/b| = |bα − a| instead of taking just the distance |α−a/b|.

AFORMULAOFGAUSS,ATHEOREMOFKUZMINANDLE´VIANDAPROBLEMOFARNOLD133 Solution.
Since123456/121169isagood(justinanaivesense)approximation to α, it should be among its convergents.
This is not an exact statement, but it offersahope!
Wehave α = [1;52,1,53,2,4,1,2,1,68110,4,1,2,106,22,3,1,1,10,2,1,3,1,3,4,2,11].
We are not going to check all convergents, because we notice the irregularity: oneelement,68110isfarmorethantheothers.
Inordertoexplainthisweusethe leftinequalityfromTheorem79togetherwiththeformula(6.5).
Indeed,wehave an approximation of α which is unexpectedly good: |α−p /q | is very small (it k k isaround10−15)andwithamodestq too.
Wehave k q (q +q ) = q (a q +q ) = q2(a +q /q ) k k+1 k k k+1 k k−1 k k+1 k−1 k and (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) pk(cid:12) 1 (cid:12)α− (cid:12) ≥ .
(cid:12) q (cid:12) q2(a +q /q ) k k k+1 k−1 k It follows that 1/q2(a +q /q ) is small (smaller than 10−15) and therefore, k k+1 k−1 k a shouldbebig.
Thisisexactlywhatwesee.
Ofcourse,ourguessiscorrect: k+1 123456 = [1,52,1,53,2,4,1,2,1].
121169 In this way we conclude that in general an unexpectedly big element allows to cut the continued fraction (right before this element) and to guess the exact rationalquantity.

INTRODUCTIONTOCONTINUEDFRACTIONSChapter 7 Introduction to Analytic Number Theory The distribution of prime numbers has been the object of intense study by many modern mathematicians.
Gauss and Legendre conjectured the prime number the- orem which states that the number of primes less than a positive number x is asymptotic to x/logx as x approaches inﬁnity.
This conjecture was later proved by Hadamard and Poisson.
Their proof and many other proofs lead to the what is knownasAnalyticNumbertheory.
In this chapter we demonstrate elementary theorems on primes and prove el- ementary properties and results that will lead to the proof of the prime number theorem.
7.1 Introduction It is well known that the harmonic series (cid:80)∞ 1 diverges.
We therefore deter- n=1 n mine some asymptotic formulas that determines the growth of the (cid:80) 1.
We n≤x n start by introducing Euler’s summation formula that will help us determine the asymptoticformula.

We deﬁne the characteristic function χ(n) to be 1 if n is prime and 0 oth- erwise.
As a result, we can see from the deﬁnition of π(x) and θ(x) that they can be represented in terms of the characteristic function χ(n).
This representation will enable use to apply Abel’s summation formula where f(n) = χ(n) for θ(x) andwheref(n) = χ(n)lognforπ(x).

INTRODUCTIONTOANALYTICNUMBERTHEORYChapter 8 Other Topics in Number Theory This chapter discusses various topics that are of profound interest in number the- ory.
Section 1 on cryptography is on an application of number theory in the ﬁeld ofmessagedecoding,whiletheothersectionsonellipticcurvesandtheRiemann zeta function are deeply connected with number theory.
The section on Fermat’s last theorem is related, through Wile’s proof of Fermat’s conjecture on the non- existence of integer solutions to xn + yn = zn for n > 2, to the ﬁeld of elliptic curves(andthustosection2).
8.1 Cryptography In this section we discuss some elementary aspects of cryptography, which con- cernsthecodinganddecodingofmessages.
Incryptography,a(word)messageis transformedintoa sequenceaofintegers, byreplacing each letterin the message by a speciﬁc and known set of integers that represent this letter, and thus forming a large integer a by concatenation.
Then this integer a is transformed (i.e.
coded) into another integer b by using a congruence of the form b = ak(mod m) for some chosen k and m, as described below, with k unknown except to the sender and receiver.
b is then sent to the receiver who decodes it into a again by using 151152 CHAPTER8.
OTHERTOPICSINNUMBERTHEORY a congruence of the form a = bk¯(mod m), where k¯ is related to k and is itself only known to the sender and receiver, and then simply transforms the integers in a back to letters and reveals the message again.
In this procedure, if a third partyinterceptstheintegerb,thechanceoftransformingthisintoa,evenifmand the integers that represent the letters of the alphabet are exactly known, is almost impossible to do (i.e.
has a fantastically small probability of being achieved) if k isnotknown,thatpracticallythetransformedmessagewillnotberevealedexcept totheintendedreceiver.
The basic results on congruences to allow for the above procedure are in the followingtwolemmata,whereφinthestatementsisEuler’sφ-function.
Lemma 16.
Let a and m be two integers, with m positive and (a,m) = 1.
If k andk¯ arepositiveintegerswithkk¯ = 1(modφ(m)),thenakk¯ = a(modm).
Proof.
kk¯ = 1(mod φ(m)) thus kk¯ = qφ(m) + 1 (q ≥ 0).
Hence akk¯ = aqφ(m)+1 = aqφ(m)a.
But by Euler’s Theorem, if (a,m) = 1 then aφ(m) = 1(modm).
Thisgivesthat (aφ(m))qa = 1(modm)a = a(modm), (8.1) andhencethatakk¯ = a(modm),andtheresultfollows.
Wealsoneedthefollowing.
Lemma17.
Letmbeapositiveinteger,andletr ,r ,··· ,r beareducedresidue 1 2 n system modulo m (i.e.
with n = φ(m) and (r ,m) = 1 for i = 1,··· ,n).
If k is i an integer such that (k,φ(m)) = 1, then rk,rk,··· ,rk forms a reduced residue 1 2 n systemmodulom.
Before giving the proof, one has to note that the above lemma is in fact an if-and-only-if statement, i.e.
(k,φ(m)) = 1 if and only if rk,rk,··· ,rk forms a 1 2 n reduced residue system modulo m. However we only need the if part, as in the lemma.8.1.
CRYPTOGRAPHY 153 Proof.
Assumeﬁrstthat(k,φ(m)) = 1.
We show thatrk,rk,··· ,rk is a reduced 1 2 n residue system modulo m. Assume otherwise, i.e.
assume that ∃i,j such that rk = rk(modm),inwhichcaserk andrk wouldbelongtothesameclassandthus i j i j rk,rk,··· ,rk wouldnotformareducedresiduesystem.
Then,since(k,φ(m)) = 1 2 n ¯ ¯ 1,∃k withkk = 1(modφ(m)),andso rkk¯ = r (modm) and rkk¯ = r (modm) (8.2) i i j j by the previous lemma.
But if rk = rk(mod m) then (rk)k¯ = (rk)k¯(mod m), and i j i j sincerkk¯ = r (modm)andrkk¯ = r (modm),thenr = r (modm)givingthatr i i j j i j i andr belongtothesameclassmodulom,contradictingthatr ,r ,··· ,r forma j 1 2 n reducedresiduesystem.
Thusr (cid:54)= r impliesthatrk (cid:54)= rk if(k,φ(m)) = 1. i j i j Now to do cryptography, one proceeds as follows.
Let S be a sentence given intermsoflettersandspacesbetweenthewordsthatisintendedtobetransformed to a destination with the possibility of being intercepted and revealed by a third party.
1.
TransformS intoa(large)integerabyreplacingeachletterandeachspace between words by a certain representative integer (e.g.
three or four digit integers for each letter).
a is formed by concatenating the representative integersthatareproduced.
2.
Chooseacouplep andp ofverylargeprimenumbers,each(forexample) 1 2 of the order of a hundred digit integer, and these should be strictly kept known only to the sender and receiver.
Then form the product m = p p , 1 2 whichisitselfaverylargenumbertothepointthatthechancesofsomeone revealingtheprimenumberfactorizationp p ofmisincrediblysmall,even 1 2 if they know this integer m. Now one has, by standard results concerning the φ-function, that φ(p ) = p − 1 and φ(p ) = p − 1, and that, since 1 1 2 2 p and p are relatively prime, φ(m) = φ(p )φ(p ) = (p − 1)(p − 1).
1 2 1 2 1 2 Thus φ(m) is a very large number, of the order of m itself, and hence m154 CHAPTER8.
OTHERTOPICSINNUMBERTHEORY has a reduced residue system that contains a very large number of integers of the order of m itself.
Hence almost every integer smaller than m, with a probability of the order 1 − 1/10100 (almost 1), is in a reduced residue system r ,r ,··· ,r of m. Thus almost every positive integer smaller 1 2 φ(m) thanmisrelativelyprimewithm,withprobabilityoftheorder1−1/10100.
3.
Now given that almost every positive integer smaller than m is relatively prime with m, the integer a itself is almost certainly relatively prime with m, and hence is in a reduced residue system for m. Hence, by lemma 17 above, if k is a (large) integer such that (k,φ(m)) = 1, then ak belongs to areducedresiduesystemform,andthereexistsauniquepositivebsmaller thanmwithb = ak(modm).
4.
Sendbtothedestinationwhereφ(m)andk areknown.
Thedestinationcan ¯ ¯ determineaksuchthatkk = 1(modφ(m)),andthenﬁndstheuniquecsuch that c = bk¯(mod m).
Now since, almost certainly, (a,m) = 1, then almost certainly c = a since c = bk¯(mod m) = (ak)k¯(mod m) = akk¯(mod m), and which by lemma 16, is given by a(mod m) almost certainly since (a,m) = 1 almost certainly.
Now the destination translates a back to letters and spaces to reveal the sentence S. Note that if any third party intercepts b, they almost certainly cannot reveal the integer a since the chance of them knowing φ(m) = p p is almost zero, even if they know 1 2 ¯ m and k. In this case they practically won’t be able to determine a k with ¯ kk = 1(modφ(m)),toretrieveaandtransformittoS.
8.2 Elliptic Curves Elliptic curves in the xy-plane are the set of points (x,y) ∈ R × R that are the zeros of special types of third order polynomials f(x,y), with real coefﬁcients, in the two variables x and y.
These curves turn out to be of fundamental interest8.2.
ELLIPTICCURVES 155 in analytic number theory.
More generally, one can deﬁne similar curves over arbitrary algebraic ﬁelds as follows.
Let f(x,y) be a polynomial of any degree in two variables x and y, with coefﬁcients in an algebraic ﬁeld F. We deﬁne the algebraiccurveC (F)overtheﬁeldF by f C (F) = {(x,y) ∈ F ×F : f(x,y) = 0 ∈ F}.
(8.3) f Of course one can also similarly deﬁne the algebraic curve C (Q) over a ﬁeld Q, f where Q is either a subﬁeld of the ﬁeld F where the coefﬁcients of f exist, or is an extension ﬁeld of F. Thus if f ∈ F[x,y], and if Q is either an extension or a subﬁeldofF,thenonecandeﬁneC (Q) = {(x,y) ∈ Q×Q : f(x,y) = 0}.
Our f maininterestinthissectionwillbeinthirdorderpolynomials(cubiccurves) f(x,y) = ax3 +bx2y +cxy2 +dy3 +ex2 +fxy +gy2 +hx+iy +j, (8.4) with coefﬁcientsinR, with the associatedcurves C (Q)overtheﬁeldof rational f numbers Q ⊂ R. Thus, basically, we will be interested in points (x,y) ∈ R2 that have rational coordinates x and y, and called rational points, that satisfy f(x,y) = 0.
Of course one can ﬁrst imagine the curve f(x,y) = 0 in R2, i.e.
the curve C (R) over R, and then choosing the points on this curve that have ra- f tionalcoordinates.
ThiscansimplybeexpressedbywritingthatC (Q) ⊂ C (R).
f f It has to be mentioned that ”rational curves” C (Q) are related to diophantine f equations.
This is in the sense that rational solutions to equations f(x,y) = 0 produce integer solutions to equations f(cid:48)(x,y) = 0, where the polynomial f(cid:48) is very closely related to the polynomial f, if not the same one in many cases.
For example every point in C (Q), where f(x,y) = xn +yn, i.e.
every rational solu- f tiontof(x,y) = xn+yn = 0,producesanintegersolutiontoxn+yn = 0.
Thus algebraiccurvesC (Q)canbeofgenuineinterestinthissense.
f InapossibleproceduretoconstructthecurveC (Q)forapolynomialf(x,y) ∈ f R[x,y] with real coefﬁcients, one considers the possibility that, given one ratio- nal point (x,y) ∈ C (Q) ⊂ C (R), a straight line with a rational slope m might f f156 CHAPTER8.
OTHERTOPICSINNUMBERTHEORY intersect the curve C (R) in a point (x(cid:48),y(cid:48)) that is also in C (Q).
This possibility f f comes from the simple fact that if (x,y),(x(cid:48),y(cid:48)) ∈ C (Q), then the slope of the f straight line that joins (x,y) and (x(cid:48),y(cid:48)) is a rational number.
This technique, of determiningonepointinC (Q)fromanotherbyusingstraightlinesasmentioned, f worksverywellinsomecasesofpolynomials,especiallythoseofseconddegree, andworksreasonablywellforthirdorderpolynomials.
Two aspects of this technique of using straight lines to determine points in C (Q), and which will be needed for deﬁning elliptic curves, are the following.
f Theﬁrstisillustratedbythefollowingexample.
Consider the polynomial f(x,y) = y2 − x2 + y = (y − x + 1)(y + x).
The curve C (R) contains the two straight lines y = x − 1 and y = −x.
The f point (2,1) ∈ C (Q), and if one tries to ﬁnd the intersection of the particular line f y = x−1 that passes through (2,1) with C (R), one ﬁnds that this includes the f whole line y = x − 1 itself, and not just one or two other points (for example).
This result is due to the fact that f is a reducible polynomial, i.e.
that can be factoredintheformf = f(cid:48)f(cid:48)(cid:48) withf andf(cid:48)(cid:48) notjustrealnumbers.
Inthisdirectiononehasthefollowinggeneraltheoremconcerningthenumber ofintersectionpointsbetweenastraightlineLandanalgebraiccurveC (R): f Theorem 89.
If f ∈ R[x,y] is a polynomial of degree d, and the line L, which is deﬁned by the zeros of g(x,y) = y − mx − b ∈ R[x,y], are such that L ∩ C (R) contains more than d points (counting the multiplicities of intersections) f then in fact L = C (R) ⊂ C (R), and f can be written in the form f(x,y) = g f g(x,y)p(x,y),wherep(x,y)issomepolynomialofdegreed−1.
Inconnectionwiththeabovetheorem,andindeﬁninganellipticcurveC (R), f where f is a polynomial of degree three, we shall require that this curve be such that any straight line that passes through two points (x ,y ),(x ,y ) ∈ C (R), 1 1 2 2 f wherethetwopointscouldbethesamepointifthecurveatoneofthemisdiffer- entiablewiththetangentatthatpointtothecurvehavingsameslopeasthatofthe8.2.

By the above theorem, 3 3 if a line intersects the curve C (R) associated with the third order polynomial f f in more than three points, then the line itself is a subset of C (R).
This will be f excluded for the kind of third degree polynomials f whose associated algebraic curvesshallbecalledellipticcurves.
One other thing to be excluded, to have third order curves characterized as elliptic curves, is the existence of singular points on the curve, where a singular pointisonewherethecurvedoesnotadmitauniquetangent.
It has to be mentioned that in the previous discussion, the points on the curve C (R) may lie at inﬁnity.
To deal with this situation we assume that the curve is f in fact a curve in the real projective plane P (R).
We now can deﬁne an elliptic 2 curve C (R) as being such that f(x,y) is an irreducible third order polynomial f withC (R)havingnosingularpointsinP (R).
f 2 Themainideabehindtheabovedeﬁnitionforellipticcurvesistohaveacurve wherebyanytwopointsAandB onthecurvecandetermineauniquethirdpoint, to be denoted by AB, using a straight line joining A and B.
The possibilities are as follows: If the line joining A and B is not tangent to the curve C (R) at f anypoint,thenthelineintersectsthecurveinexactlythreedifferentpointstwoof which are A and B while the third is AB.

Thisbinary operation in turn produces, as will be described next, another binary operation, denoted by +, that deﬁnes a group structure on C (R) that is associated with the f158 CHAPTER8.
OTHERTOPICSINNUMBERTHEORY straight-lineconstructiondiscussedsofar.
A group structure on an elliptic curve C (R) is deﬁned as follows: Consider f an arbitrary point, denoted by 0, on C (R).
We deﬁne, for any two points A and f B onC (R),thepointA+B by f A+B = 0(AB), (8.5) meaning that we ﬁrst determine the point AB as above, then we determine the point0(AB)correspondingto0andAB.

(8.6) Thisshowsthatthevariousgroupstructuresthatcanbedeﬁnedonanellipticcurve by considering all possible points 0 and associated operations +, are essentially thesame,uptoa”translation”.
Lemma18.
ConsiderthegroupstructureonanellipticcurveC (R),correspond- f ing to an operation + with identity element 0.
If the cubic polynomial f has rational coefﬁcients, then the subset C (Q) ⊂ C (R) of rational solutions to f f f(x,y) = 0 forms a subgroup of C (R) if and only if 0 is itself a rational point f (i.e.
arationalsolution).
Proof.
If C (Q) is a subgroup of C (R), then it must contain the identity 0, and f f thus 0 would be a rational point.
Conversely, assume that 0 is a rational point.8.2.
ELLIPTICCURVES 159 First, since f has rational coefﬁcients, then for any two rational points A and B in C (Q) one must have that AB is also rational, and thus (since 0 is assumed f rational) that 0(AB) is rational, making A + B = 0(AB) rational.
Thus C (Q) f would be closed under +.
Moreover, since for every A ∈ C (Q) one has that f −A = A(00), then −A is also rational, which makes C (Q) closed under inver- f sion.
HenceC (Q)isasubgroup.
f Thus by lemma 18, the set of all rational points on an elliptic curve form a subgroup of the group determined by the curve and a point 0, if and only if the identity element 0 is itself a rational point.
In other words, one ﬁnds that if the elliptic curve C (R) contains one rational point p, then there exists a group f structure on C (R), with 0 = p and the corresponding binary operation +, such f thatthesetC (Q)ofallrationalpointsonC (R)isagroup.
f f One thing to note about rational solutions to general polynomial functions f(x,y), is that they correspond to integer solution to a corresponding homoge- neous polynomial h(X,Y,Z) in three variables, and vice-verse, where homoge- neous practically means that this function is a linear sum of terms each of which hasthesamepowerwhenaddingthepowersofthevariablesinvolvedinthisterm.
ForexampleXY2 −2X3 +XYZ +Z3 ishomogeneous.
In fact a rational solution x = a/b and y = c/d for f(x,y) = 0, where a,b,c,d are integers, can ﬁrst be written as x = ad/bd and y = cb/bd, and thus one can always have this solution in the form x = X/Z and y = Y/Z, where X = ad,Y = cb and Z = bd.
If x = X/Z and y = Y/Z are replaced in f(x,y) = 0, one obtains a new version h(X,Y,Z) = 0 of this equation written in terms of the new variables X,Y,Z.
One can immediately see that this new polynomial function h(X,Y,Z) is homogeneous in X,Y,Z.
The homogeneous function h(X,Y,Z) in X,Y,Z is the form that f(x,y) takes in projective space, where in this case the transformations x = X/Z and y = Y/Z deﬁne the projec- tivetransformationthattakef(x,y)toh(X,Y,Z).
If we now go back to cubic equation f(x,y) = 0, one can transform this160 CHAPTER8.
OTHERTOPICSINNUMBERTHEORY functionintoitscubichomogeneousformh(X,Y,Z) = 0,where h(X,Y,Z) = aX3 + bX2Y +cXY2 +dY3 +eX2Z + fXYZ +gY2Z +hXZ2 +iYZ2 +jZ3, (8.7) by using the projective transformation x = X/Z and y = Y/Z.
Then, by impos- ingsomeconditions,suchasrequiringthatthepoint(1,0,0)(inprojectivespace) satisfy this equation, and that the line tangent to the curve at the point (1,0,0) be the Z-axis that intersects the curve in the point (0,1,0), and that the X-axis is the line tangent to the curve at (0,1,0), then one can immediately show that the homogeneouscubicequationabovebecomesoftheform h(X,Y,Z) = cXY2 +eX2Z +fXYZ +hXZ2 +iYZ2 +jZ3.
(8.8) Which, by using the projective transformation again, and using new coefﬁcients, givesthatpointsonthecurveC (R)arepreciselythoseonthecurveC (R),where f h h(x,y) = axy2 +bx2 +cxy +dx+ey +f.
(8.9) And with further simple change of variables (consisting of polynomial functions inxandywithrationalcoefﬁcients)oneobtainsthatthepointsonthecurveC (R) f arepreciselythoseonC (R)where g g(x,y) = y2 −4x3 +g x−g , (8.10) 2 3 i.e.
that C (R) = C (R).
The equation g(x,y) = 0, where g is given in (8.10), f g is said to be the Weierstrass normal form of the equation f(x,y) = 0.
Thus, in particular, any elliptic curve deﬁned by a cubic f, is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve deﬁned by a polynomial g(x,y) as above.
Birational equivalence between curves is deﬁned here as being a rational transformation, together with its inverse transformation, that takes the points on one curve to another, and vice- versa.8.3.
THERIEMANNZETAFUNCTION 161 8.3 The Riemann Zeta Function The Riemann zeta function ζ(z) is an analytic function that is a very important function in analytic number theory.
It is (initially) deﬁned in some domain in the complexplanebythespecialtypeofDirichletseriesgivenby ∞ (cid:88) 1 ζ(z) = , (8.11) nz n=1 whereRe(z) > 1.
Itcanbereadilyveriﬁedthatthegivenseriesconvergeslocally uniformly, and thus that ζ(z) is indeed analytic in the domain in the complex plane C deﬁned by Re(z) > 1, and that this function does not have a zero in this domain.
WeﬁrstprovethefollowingresultwhichiscalledtheEulerProductFormula.
Theorem91.
ζ(z),asdeﬁnedbytheseriesabove,canbewrittenintheform ∞ (cid:89) 1 ζ(z) = , (8.12) (cid:16) (cid:17) 1− 1 n=1 pz n where{p }isthesequenceofallprimenumbers.

knowingthatif|x| < 1then ∞ 1 (cid:88) = xk, (8.13) 1−x k=0 oneﬁndsthateachterm 1 inζ(z)isgivenby 1−p1zn ∞ 1 (cid:88) 1 = , (8.14) 1− 1 pkz pzn k=0 n162 CHAPTER8.
OTHERTOPICSINNUMBERTHEORY sinceevery|1/pz| < 1ifRe(z) > 1.
ThisgivesthatforanyintegerN n N N (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:89) 1 (cid:89) 1 1 = 1+ + +··· (cid:16) (cid:17) n=1 1− p1z n=1 pzn p2nz n (cid:88) 1 = (8.15) pk1z···pkjz n1 ni (cid:88) 1 = nz where i ranges over 1,··· ,N, and j ranges from 0 to ∞, and thus the integers n in the third line above range over all integers whose prime number factorization consist of a product of powers of the primes p = 2,··· ,p .
Also note that each 1 N suchintegernappearsonlyonceinthesumabove.
Now since the series in the deﬁnition of ζ(z) converges absolutely and the order of the terms in the sum does not matter for the limit, and since, eventu- ally, every integer n appears on the right hand side of 8.15 as N −→ ∞, then lim (cid:2)(cid:80) 1 (cid:3) = ζ(z).
Moreover, lim (cid:81)N 1 exists, and the re- N→∞ nz N N→∞ n=1 (cid:16)1−p1zn(cid:17) sultfollows.
TheRiemannzetafunctionζ(z)asdeﬁnedthroughthespecialDirichletseries above, can be continued analytically to an analytic function through out the com- plex plane C except to the point z = 1, where the continued function has a pole of order 1.
Thus the continuation of ζ(z) produces a meromorphic function in C withasimplepoleat1.
Thefollowingtheoremgivesthisresult.
Theorem 92. ζ(z), as deﬁned above, can be continued meromorphically in C, andcanbewrittenintheformζ(z) = 1 +f(z),wheref(z)isentire.
z−1 Given this continuation of ζ(z), and also given the functional equation that is satisﬁedbythiscontinuedfunction,andwhichis (cid:16)πz(cid:17) ζ(z) = 2zπz−1sin Γ(1−z)ζ(1−z), (8.16) 28.3.
THERIEMANNZETAFUNCTION 163 (seeaproofin[3]),whereΓisthecomplexgammafunction,onecandeducethat the continued ζ(z) has zeros at the points z = −2,−4,−6,··· on the negative real axis.
This follows as such: The complex gamma function Γ(z) has poles at the points z = −1,−2,−3,··· on the negative real line, and thus Γ(1−z) must have poles at z = 2,3,··· on the positive real axis.
And since ζ(z) is analytic at (cid:0) (cid:1) these points, then it must be that either sin πz or ζ(1 − z) must have zeros at 2 the points z = 2,3,··· to cancel out the poles of Γ(1 − z), and thus make ζ(z) (cid:0) (cid:1) analytic at these points.
And since sin πz has zeros at z = 2,4,···, but not at 2 z = 3,5,···, then it must be that ζ(1−z) has zeros at z = 3,5,···.
This gives thatζ(z)haszerosatz = −2,−4,−6···.
It also follows from the above functional equation, and from the above men- tionedfactthatζ(z)hasnozerosinthedomainwhereRe(z) > 1,thatthesezeros at z = −2,−4,−6··· of ζ(z) are the only zeros that have real parts either less that 0, or greater than 1.
It was conjectured by Riemann, The Riemann Hypothe- sis,thateveryotherzeroofζ(z)intheremainingstrip0 ≤ Re(z) ≤ 1,allexiston the vertical line Re(z) = 1/2.
This hypothesis was checked for zeros in this strip with very large modulus, but remains without a general proof.
It is thought that the consequence of the Riemann hypothesis on number theory, provided it turns outtobetrue,isimmense.164 CHAPTER8.
